Looks like he has not configured the paper size to letter.

Message-ID: <20041102111545.149CF630A4@statpc9>


Hi all,

I have played a little with texdocpk on TL2004.
Some documentation files are not found.
The main cause for that is that most .dvi files have been 
replaced by .ps or .pdf ones following the guidelines given 
to package maintainers, and, in some cases only, texdodpk 
is not aware of these changes,  examples:
-- amsldoc.dvi  (not found, replaced by amsldoc.pdf)
-- amsthdoc.dvi (not found, replaced by amsthdoc.pdf)
-- grfguide.dvi (not found, replaced by grfguide.ps)

In some cases, neither the .dvi nor the .pdf doc-file exists,
examples :
-- no fancyvrb.dvi, no fancyvrb.pdf
-- no colortbl.dvi, no colortbl.pdf

I have also noticed that amsclass.faq, present on TL2003 is
no longer on TL2004, so textdoctk returns an error for that file.

I have not checked every package, just tried some at random.
Is there a systematic way of finding all packages for which
textdoctk will fail?

Message-ID: <20041102233422.GA2812@muisje>

I downloaded the test image and tried to install under Debian
Linux/ppc. I first installed texmf trees and then installed
binaries from source.

`make all' went fine. `make install' went haywire: generation of
LaTeX formats failed over a missing ..hyph.tex file. For the
xmltex format, a latex format is needed so another attempt was
made to generate a latex format. Somehow, recursion happened and
lots of pdfetex- and fmtutil processes got spawned.

I may try later this week what happens if I install all hyphenation
files.

dont even think about it. move the binary directory over to
where the other TL binaries are, no more and no less.

I know "make install" _should_ work, but it won't.

It was just recently fixed in texconfig (2004/10/28) that the formats
are regenerated after pdftexconfig.tex is changed by texconfig.

Without the fix, it was possible to
  texconfig pdftex paper letter
without any immediate effect...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0411032318240.18228-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

I received 2 messages concerning install-tl.sh (TL2003).
The script didn't install the binaries on Debian Sarge and Slackware 10.
The installation succeded only when exporting LC_ALL=C (Slackware user
tried also LANG=POSIX, since the default LANG=us_US also failed).
Both users have bash.
This is very strange because I tried different LANG and LC_ALL on many 
RedHat equiped machines and installing TL2003 went always smoothly.

Could someone check if the current install-tl.sh works also on such
modern Linux systems? Anyway, it is interesting why locales can have
any impact on bash script...

Thanks,

common.sh now sets LC_ALL=C, so we should be ok this year.

I don't have access to any machines running those versions to test on
for sure.

It seems that when Sebastian updated the carlisle packages for a bug fix
in typecase on oct7, the pdf's I had previously created were deleted,
and pspicture.ps reinstated in the wrong place (doc instead of
dvips/carlisle).  I put things to rights.  Sebastian, maybe ctan2tds can
be fixed?

    I have also noticed that amsclass.faq, present on TL2003 is
    no longer on TL2004, so textdoctk returns an error for that file.

It seems the AMS deleted the file from the distribution on CTAN.
I re-added it by hand for now.

    to package maintainers, and, in some cases only, texdodpk 
    is not aware of these changes,  examples:
    -- amsldoc.dvi  (not found, replaced by amsldoc.pdf)
    -- amsthdoc.dvi (not found, replaced by amsthdoc.pdf)
    -- grfguide.dvi (not found, replaced by grfguide.ps)

I am sad that texdoctk apparently requires manual maintenance of every
single doc file.  This does not seem like a good idea.  Why not search
for both .dvi and .pdf, at the very least?  And surely subdir searching
would be a much better mechanism than explicitly specifying every
directory.  Wow.

Staszek, I think you've talked with the texdoctk maintainer before.
Would you like to bring up this problem, maybe show them Thomas's
script, etc.?  I am not inclined to hack up texdoctk.dat myself.

Thanks,

I think that is rather hard to guess which doc files should be generated
by P.T. TL Team. For some packages we have ready made dvi|ps|pdf files
already on CTAN (or only text files), for other only .dtx which can 
(always should?) be processed.

Nobody knows if that deletion was intentional, so I'd suggest to stick
to what we have on CTAN.

Ps. As for texdoctk.dat, I corrected it mainly for the changed layout,
esp. texmf-doc/ guides, faq etc. (I wrote about that a month ago).
Perhaps the script proposed by Thomas can cure that somehow better.

Fortunatelly, texdoctk doesn't use absolute path and works now with 
differents trees (texmf/doc/, texmf-dist/doc/ and texmf-doc/doc/ so we 
have some progress...

Sure. It it somehow tedious work. Kaja spent a lot of time last year
for correcting it by hand. Anyway, it would be welcome if someone 
can follow Thomas' ideas and take this part (Daniel, can you help?).

I would still put a copy of the latest version on the TL distribution
as it is intended for people not having a good connection to Internet.
TL users would at least have a (not too old) version of this FAQ
at hand.

Sure. It it somehow tedious work. Kaja spent a lot of time last year
for correcting it by hand. Anyway, it would be welcome if someone 
can follow Thomas' ideas and take this part (Daniel, can you help?).

I am not fond of hacking texdoctk.dat either. I fully agree

    I think that is rather hard to guess which doc files should be generated
    by P.T. TL Team. 

What is P.T.?

    For some packages we have ready made dvi|ps|pdf files
    already on CTAN (or only text files), 

I was under the impression that the CTAN maintainers now require pdf doc
to be included when installing/updating packages.  Although carlisle
seems to have been an exception :).

    for other only .dtx which can 
    (always should?) be processed.

Sebastian's ctan2tds script does in fact always process a .dtx (into .dvi).

not quite. I hacked a perl script which parsed the texdoctk database
and the doc tree (only one last year) to delete from texdoctk.dat files 
no longer present in texmf/doc and add the .dvi, .ps and .pdf files 
from master doc tree which were not found in texdoctk.dat. which I suspect
is what Thomas's grep is doing :)

I have no idea where I have this, so no promises. at the moment, I sync 
the Master tree (24K + of log file already) and pay attention to my
new office machine which runs Fedora: pleasant, but also full of surprises.

actually it's a document property and as such it should be defined in the 
document anyway; so the predefined valus is just a fallback

Dear TeX Live builders --

Tigran, Gerbek, Norbert, Olaf, Maksym -- there have been minor fixes to
dvips, makeindex, and tex4ht.  If you could do one more rebuild, that
would be ideal.  It's not completely critical.  It should not matter
whether you build from source or source.development.

Fabrice -- can you upload your sources?

Baden -- if no luck with i386-solaris in the next few days, I'll remove
it from the repository and we can put it on the web if you ever get the
binaries done.

Manfred -- I believe the FreeBSD binaries are a couple more revisions
behind, not including that final bug fix to e-TeX.  So doing one more
rebuild there would be a very good thing.

Also, I gather from Klaus that you (Manfred) hope to start the
production work in a week or so?  That would be very good.  The sooner
the better :).

Thanks,
karl

They are being kept in sync at the moment, so it doesn't matter which is
used.  At least that's the idea.  I've been checking that from time to
time, I'll do it again now.

    (note: is it a good idea that paper size for pdftex ends up in the 
    format file while for tex+dvips it is set and read runtime by dvips? 

One of the fundamental differences between tex and pdftex is that pdftex
has to know the characteristics of the document output, since it is
producing the final output.  Thus, page size, page offsets, resolution,
and other parameters that are left to DVI processing when tex is used
must be given up front to pdftex.  (This is explained, tersely, in the
pdftex manual.)

    Personally my first idea would be that such settings indeed should be 
    read by pdftex from a config file and thus not require a format 
    rebuild)

As I expect you know, that's how it used to be until this year -- what
used to be set in pdftex.cfg is now set with pdfTeX primitives.  There
are pros and cons.  As Hans said, it's a document-level thing anyway.

Thanks,

Hi (probably Olaf),

When openin_any = p we get:

pdfetex: Not writing to /somepath/www.pragma-pod.com/someplace/somefile 
(openin_any = p).

The message is kind of wrong, since it should be "Not reading from".

I wonder why this file is not read since it's not something

.
./
../
whatever/../../../

or: shouldn't period prevention be limited to the occurence of . and .. path 
segments only? Nowadays paths with periods in it are rather common.

Hans

actually, the page format has to be known at any stage since the page 
construction (as done by macros) may depend on it; in dvi one can use specials 
to communicate the page characteristics; the main difference between dvi and pdf 
is the reference point, which in pdf is at the lower left corner, which makes it 
more sensitive to a non specified paper size since it needs to know the height 
of the page.

    I am looking for a plain TeX equivalent of the file testpage.tex. I 

This is not equivalent, but it's a subset in seven lines:

\output={\shipout\box255}
\vsize=9in \advance\vsize by .8pt
\topskip=0pt
\hrule      % should be 1in from top & left/right, 6.5in wide
\vskip9in
\hrule      % should be 1in from bottom & left/right, 6.5in wide
\end

That is, if the system is set up for letter paper by default.

This ignores the .4pt height of the rules itself.

HTH,

actually,

./whatever.tex
somepath/./whatever.tex

are valid as well (contrary to .whatever.tex)

What are the precise rules applied now?

It is easy enough for me to produce a new setup. But if Fabrice is

Currently I use:

His sources are solely for win32.  Thus building everything else from

We (I at least) are still waiting for a fix from Tomas R. about a bug
related to subsetting a font which is additionally used in included
eps graphics. So, if we are going for a rebuild, we should ask Tomas
whether he is close to fixing this bug...

I'm still working on it.  Given the nature of the required change I'd
be tempted not to wait on it for the build.  It may be a relatively
simple change, but I'm a bit afraid of upsetting the applecart so I
want to build a test suite that considers a bunch of different
combinations that I can test before and after.  I would estimate I
may have a solution to this problem within a week or two.

(Details:  dvips is stupid.  It has already decided to download that
font for inclusion in the document, possibly partially, when suddenly
it encounters a PostScript graphics file that requires the font, and
thus it needs to change its mind, download the font in its entirety
as a header and be done with it.  This *should* be straightforward,
once I get my head wrapped around the code I wrote once again.)

The period is not the reason: you've specified an absolute path for
which TEXINPUTS doesn't contain a "root".

Sorry, did this off the top of my head: the real reason is that this
is an absolute path not rooted in $TEXMFOUTPUT.  From the manual:

----------------
  TeX can write output files, via the `\openout' primitive; this opens
a security hole vulnerable to Trojan horse attack: an unwitting user
could run a TeX program that overwrites, say, `~/.rhosts'.  (MetaPost
has a `write' primitive with similar implications).  To alleviate this,
there is a configuration variable `openout_any', which selects one of
three levels of security.  When it is set to `a' (for "any"), no
restrictions are imposed.  When it is set to `r' (for "restricted"),
filenames beginning with `.' are disallowed (except `.tex' because
LaTeX needs it).  When it is set to `p' (for "paranoid") additional
restrictions are imposed: an absolute filename must refer to a file in
(a subdirectory) of `TEXMFOUTPUT', and any attempt to go up a directory
level is forbidden (that is, paths may not contain a `..'  component).
The paranoid setting is the default.  (For backwards compatibility, `y'
and `1' are synonyms of `a', while `n' and `0' are synonyms for `r'.)

Then what is the way to add something to texinput without patching texmf.cnf?

Maybe we need something --extrainputs={abc,def,gef}//  which is internally 
prepended to the texinputs var of the specific progname; a feature like that is 
needed in order to be able to use resources that are not present in the 
texmftree but still have some of the security provided by paranoid inclusion, 
something like

   -include-directory=

in miktex.

Subject: [tex-live] omega and antomega
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0411061753360.2990-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

I've observed that antomega on p4 is not updated from CTAN (some 
obsolete files were removed, some added, other changed, etc.). Moreover
some antomega files belong on TL depot to the omega package, because they 
share the same directories, eg. 
texmf-dist/omega/ocp/char2uni/
texmf-dist/omega/ocp/uni2char/
texmf-dist/omega/otp/char2uni/
texmf-dist/omega/otp/uni2char/
texmf-dist/tex/generic/omegahyph/

So the question: can some files from different packages share the same
directory (which seems quite natural*) and how that could influence the 
automation of building packages? I think that we have more similar examples.

*) to avoid making TDS tree more complicated; we can already declare
that antomega is dependent on omega.

Of course I can update and repair antomega and omega by hand but I want 
to know the exact rule to follow.

Thanks,

gmtr is missing in cbgreek.map maybe as there is no Type1 version.

mktexmf is missing the entry regarding gm.r:

  g[lorst][ijmtwx][cinou]*)
    # A small superset of the names of the cbgreek fonts.

--->

  g[lmorst][ijmtwx][cinoru]*)

then it creates a pk font. fuzzy logic... :-)

    gmtr is missing in cbgreek.map maybe as there is no Type1 version.

Right, this is intentional.  (And it was a pain to do.)  We had to leave
out some of cbgreek so the CD would stay within bounds.

    mktexmf is missing the entry regarding gm.r:

Thanks very much, I made that change in source, source.development, and
all the bin directories ...

Following the suggestions from Giusepppe and the current teTeX state
I've changed soft links lambda->omega and added lamed->aleph
(btw. we have now 234 files in bin/<unix>/ altogether, fdf2tex was added
some days ago). Consequently changed:
fmtutil.in (in source and source.development)
Master/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
Master/texmf/tpm/bin-aleph.tpm and bin-omega.tpm

Fabrice, can you follow that for win32?
Thanks,

Which still leaves me baffled.

I cannot compile the teubner-doc.tex document, even with the cb/greek  
fonts and map installed and activated.

When compiling with pdflatex, I get

  g[lmorst][ijmtwx][cinoru]*)

--->

  g[lmorst][ijmtwx][cilnoru]*)

also, for best results, do:

rm /var/tmp/texfonts/source/public/cbgreek/*
rm /var/tmp/texfonts/tfm/public/cbgreek/*

then it runs teubner-doc ok here.

Cilnoru!

just looked to these many cbgreek fonts. Seems they are made from a
small group of sources, with slight adaptions to various design sizes.
But they share the same internal structures. See what happens if one
does a tar, tar c, tar j on the pfb's (cb.t*) and on versions
disassembled by t1disasm (cbasm.t*):

-rw-r--r--    1 hahe     hahe     64573440 11-07 12:07 cbasm.tar
-rw-r--r--    1 hahe     hahe      5561066 11-07 12:11 cbasm.tgj
-rw-r--r--    1 hahe     hahe      8888786 11-07 12:08 cbasm.tgz
-rw-r--r--    1 hahe     hahe     19240960 11-07 12:03 cb.tar
-rw-r--r--    1 hahe     hahe     17805859 11-07 12:12 cb.tgj
-rw-r--r--    1 hahe     hahe     18200123 11-07 12:04 cb.tgz

so maybe one could (not now) distribute them in disassembled/tgj form,
and run a script to re-create the pfb's?

Same here. I patched mktexmf already in perforce. One question, though:

There are still some pk fonts loaded for the document:
	gmtr1000
	grml1000
	gmtr1200
	grml1200

But the pfb files are there, e.g. (never mind the location)

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/type1/public/cb/gmtr1000.pfb
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/type1/public/cb/grml1000.pfb
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/type1/public/cb/gmtr1200.pfb
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/type1/public/cb/grml1200.pfb

So, the map file must be the cuplrit, and it is:

No gmtr and grml entries in the map file, but the pfb files are  
available.

Do I understand it correcty that the cbgreek.map file is intentionally  
incomplete because not all the stuff in Master is copied to the CD?  
Should we then not call it indeed cdgreek.map and have a real  
cbgreek.map?

I have no opinion if it makes sense to have two map files or not. But,
it if must be two: please don't choose two names that are *that* hard
to distinguish.

Maybe, cdgreek.map / cbgreek-cd.map.

Silly, me (but it shows that the names are really too close)! Sould
have been
  cbgreek.map / cbgreek-cd.map
of course.

Dear TexLive List,


       In order to discover TeX (and LateX) I decided to become a member of the Gutenberg association and therefore I received the 2CDs+DVD (Edition 9/2003). I work with Windows 98. The installation works with no error message. I can launch Xemacs but there is no Latex menu as it is said in the documentation of TexLive to test the installation with the file sample2e.tex. With WinShell I have no problem to do the test but I want to discover also Xemacs because in the future I would like to use in the same time TeX, R and Splus (statistical softwares).

   Is there anybody to help me ?

thanks beforehand.

Best regards

    and run a script to re-create the pfb's?

Interesting idea.

It sounds very nice, but (to my knowledge) none of the programs are set
up to run a (hypothetical) mktextype1 script to make a pfb on the fly.
So it would be a lot of work.  And the mktex* scripts are already cause
of endless confusion and problems, not to mention a portability
nightmare ...

No.

We have the same cbgreek pfb's and map for the cd and the dvd.  Although
it would be nice to have the full cbgreek on the dvd and only omit stuff
for the cd, the infrastructure is not set up to handle such a thing.

The fact that those pfb's are in Master and not in cbgreek.map is simply
a bug.  I will add them to cbgreek.map later today, and check the map
files (once again) for consistency.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0411070854130.24788@cerberus.cwmannwn.nowhere>

texdoctk gives a "no selection" error when using the current Tk.pm.
The problem is described by texdoc Tk::804delta:

     curselection of Tk::Listbox now returns an array reference in
     scalar  context. This means you have to write

                my(@selected) = $listbox->curselection

        or

                my(@selected) = @{ $listbox->curselection }


"curselection" is used once in texdoctk -- the corrected line is:

   $tplist->bind('<Button-1>'=>sub{my ($slctind)=$tplist->curselection();

This works with older versions of Tk.pm.  Note that there are versions of
the perl script in the bin directory for each *n*x platform as well as
the one in texmf/scripts/tetex, I presume because some Win32 stuff fails
with *n*x.

Thomas Ruedas has send me that fix and I have checked it in for TeX Live.
teTeX-2.99.2 (beta) has the corrected version, too.

Thanks for providing us that fix!

I corrected accordingly texmf/scripts/tetex/texdoctk.pl (#6427) which is
used for win32. It works quite well, except loading TDK_OWN viewer for
text files. I could change texdocrc-win32.defaults for e.g. notepad.exe
but notepad dispays badly text files with LF-only line endings. 
Ehh... crazy windows.

So what's the recipe for cleaning the mess with omega and antomega

	Vazeni kolegove!
Na muj predchozi bug report odpovedel F. Popineau v tom smyslu, ze

- vetsiny problemu si neni vedom a nikdo mu je nehlasil (asi mi ani neveri, ze to je 
bezne; ja je mam uz na tretim pocitaci),
- davno ho to nezajima, protoze pouziva PDF,
- jako alternativu doporucuje MikTeX.

Na takovy nazor mu nelze brat narok.
V tom pripade vsak jeste vic prekvapuje, ze CSTUG s TeXem distribuuje prohlizec, o 
jehoz chabou funkcnost se nikdo nezajima a zajimat nebude.
Patrne sdilite nazor, ze DVI je zastaraly format nehodny zajmu  (ja se s tim 
neztotoznuji; prinejmensim potrebuji neco, cim bych si prohlizel DVI od svych kolegu, 
kteri se s tim teprv naucili pracovat; nehodlam zahodit nasbiranou knihovnu clanku).
Asi v tomto usili zustanu osamocen a i ja budu muset zahlcovat disky formaty, ktere 
znovu a znovu ukladaji ty same fonty.

Prece bych vsak povazoval za solidni upozornit toho, kdo si instaluje TeX-live, ze 
format DVI neni nadale podporovan a ze vam k tomu zrejme nema ani posilat 
pripominky.

prevent me from using this program. These are, among others:

1. Refresh sometimes does not work (and the button has no effect).

2. Even windows (the second, the fourth, ...) cannot be resized - only maximized or 
minimized, otherwise they are not displayed. This surprisingly does not apply to odd 
windows.

3. It happened to me that a log file has been displayed with abundance of error 
messages.
OK, this may be caused by a mistake in fonts installation. The problem is that it was 
impossible to stop error messages regularly and close the window; I had to interrupt the 
windvi process. 

4. Printing succeeds, but it is accompanied by an error message: 
missing gsdll32.dll

5. The configuration changed spontaneously (antialiasing switched off) and the 
attempts to change it back produced only an error message.

I am surprised that CSTUG repeatedly distributes this program with TeX without any 
update.

Do you, please, know of an upgrade of this program or an alternative solution?
	Yours sincerely

Hi Karl,

I have downloaded the latest sources and will build x86_64 binaries 
tonight, when I come back home.

Kind regards

Does anyone know if the Mathematica support in TL is actually useful?
Would it be better to just remove it, as this user suggests?

He previously sent a revised .map file with more entries, but I don't
think we want to install it.  The new fonts are not Mathememata-specific
-- Janson Text, Adobe Garamond, etc.  I'll attach it for the record.

I am not sure that is a good idea. If the old wolfram.map file is 
"wrong" (i.e. produce incorrect tex output) those files too are likely 
to be out of date, and confuse rather than help users.

I suggest if you cannot put up to date versions in, then throw them 
away. That way, at least if users with Mathematica put the files in for 
themselves, they wont clash with any out of date ones in texlive.

    So what's the recipe for cleaning the mess with omega and antomega
    (and updating the later from ctan)?

What is the mess you want to clean up?

It is rather late to be making large scale changes.  Do we have to do
anything?  Is it really any worse than previous years?  omega can
typeset hello world, isn't that good enough?

Sebastian, antomega is apparently multilingual support for lambda,

I assume its probably not working in the real world,
if its related to Omega?

if its addons for Omega, isnt it easy to work out which directories it goes
in?

Actually, more or less the other way round.  It is adding the pieces
necessary for using Omega in the real world.  The kind of stuff that
the Omega developers can't be bothered with since the next version of
Omega will be much better and completely different.

Sounds good, but unless/until someone is clear on exactly what changes
are needed and exactly what the consequences are, I suggest we do
nothing.  Now is not the time to experiment.  I wish it had come up
earlier.

I don't understand.  antomega is a bunch of style files (at well as
some otps), like Babel is a bunch of style files.  There is nothing
needed in the way of "experimenting" except placing the files
somewhere in Omega's input tree.

What exactly is the problem right now?

Ehh... have you read my message from 6 Nov? The problem was how to clearly
separate/distinguish antomega as *package* from "omega" and "lambda",
then update "antomega" from CTAN. The first turn was made by Sebastian
(thanks, btw). I've spent some time to finish that, mostly cleaning
omega and lambda from old antomega stuff.
As antomega is some addition to lambda, all input files goes to
tex/lambda/antomega/ following TDS (exactly like packages in tex/latex/).
Foolowing that I've moved doc/omega/antomega to doc/lambda/antomega
(the same for source/omega/antomega -> source/lambda/antomega ).
Change #6441 (and really headache).

As Ralf has already mentioned, I have put the support files for Mathematica 
from the Mathematica CD. This is because they are included in every new 
release so I don't want to look into it what they have changed. So I don't 
use the TL ones, I have deleted them.

In my distribution of Mathematica 4, Adobe Garamond, Linotype Optima or 
Jason etc. are not included. Nevertheless this fonts are copyrighted 
material so who is using them can include them in his maps. But I don't 
have this fonts so such entries would be useless for me.

And Ralph wrotes:

>>I suggest if you cannot put up to date versions in, then throw them
>>away. That way, at least if users with Mathematica put the files in for

But older Mma versions have other versions so I have to include the one I 
need (e.g. on my old Mac this is Mathematica 3 and there I have to use the 
corrected ones from the Wolfram web site) and not the "up to date" ones for 
the actual version. Now version 5 is the actual Mathematica release and I'm 
still using version 4 so I cannot use the TL distribution if the newest 
ones are included.

On the other hand there is a good explanation on the Wolfram web site how 
to include the fonts to a TeX distribution for different Mathematica 
versions, see
http://support.wolfram.com/mathematica/interface/export/
so it should be not to complicated do adopt it to the used TL distribution.

Best regards, Harald

    Now version 5 is the actual Mathematica release and I'm

... or (presumably) the current support in TL, which is for version 3.

So I deleted the mma support.  Always happy to make the distribution
smaller :).

Subject: [tex-live] binaries "unification"
Message-ID: <87r7n1e7lq.fsf@vvv.vsu.ru>

Hi!

i've made a few "unifying" changes in binaries:

1) the following files were regular scripts, instead of symlinks to
   "texexec":

  alpha-linux/fdf2tex
  alpha-linux/pdfcrop
  powerpc-darwin6.8/mptopdf
  powerpc-darwin6.8/thumbpdf

   I've make them symlinks to "texexec" as in all other architectures.

2) Added missing symlinks (which are present in all other
   architectures and are generated by build, but nevertheless were
   not submitted):

  i386-freebsd4.10/fdf2tex
  powerpc-darwin6.8/fdf2tex
  sparc-solaris2.7/fdf2tex

3) deleted x86_64-linux/xdvi-xaw.bin

   x86_64-linux contained both xdvi-motif.bin and xdvi-xaw.bin
   xdvi-motif.bin was recently updated, while xdvi-xaw.bin was left
   from older build.
   (And "xdvi" script in x86_64-linux uses xdvi-motif.bin)

Now, all unix binary directories contain the same set of files
(modulo xdvi-xaw.bin or xdvi-motif.bin).

The ONLY exception is the powerpc-darwin6.8 directory. It differs from
other unix directories in the following ways:

1) it contains the following additional copies of altpdf* script which
   are not present in other architectures (and are not generated by
   standard build):

  altpdfcont-de
  altpdfcont-en
  altpdfcont-nl
  altpdflambda
  altpdfomega

2) it lacks the file

  altpdfcontext

   which is present in all other directories (and is generated by
   standard build)

3) it contains the ttf2tex script (from CTAN:support/ttf2tex ?)

My questions are:

1) could we please use the same set of altpdf* scripts everywhere?

2) Gerben, could you please consider getting rid of this bunch of
   scripts (which are copies of each other) in favor of having only
   one script named "altpdf", which will accept the "engine" as it's
   first argument? E.g. instead of

  altpdflambda [options and parameters]

   you would use

  altpdf lambda [options and parameters]

   and similar for all other altpdf* scripts.

   That will allow to avoid silly copies of the same script and having
   to add/remove the new altpdf* scripts once and for all.

3) could we please either remove powerpc-darwin6.8/ttf2tex or add it
   to all other unix directories?

Best,
v.

    i've made a few "unifying" changes in binaries:

Thank you for doing all that.  The missing fdf2tex was my fault when I
submitted the latest binaries.  I thought I had p4 added it, but
obviously not.

    1) could we please use the same set of altpdf* scripts everywhere?

Desirable in principle, but I don't think the extra scripts in darwin
really hurt anything.  They've always been there.

    3) could we please either remove powerpc-darwin6.8/ttf2tex or add it
       to all other unix directories?

It's part of bin-pdftex.tpm, for some reason.  I don't know how that
came about.  Seems like it should be its own package, ultimately.

Meanwhile, the version in darwin is identical to the version to
ctan:support/ttf2tex, so I see no harm in making it available on all the
platforms.  I did that.

Thanks,
karl

Is there any reason why dvipdfmx is not in TeXlive?  This program is
*far* superior to dvipdfm (especially its ability to produce much
smaller output files).

Well, it's too late now, I fear.

In my case, this is how it is submitted by me. See

http://tug.org/i-packages/tex.ii2/tex.16.tar.bz2

which is what I submit to Sebastian or Karl.

I did not notice that this was teh case. I do a TL build under Mac OS X
10.2.8 which is followed by some fixes, like the ttf2tex and altpdf* which
is added from my local development setup.

What I submit is what is in my i-Package. This is based on TL with a few
changes.

It is weird that these are copies. They should all be symlinks to
altpdftex. It seems that there inclusion in the directories (which I have
never done myself) somehow changes this.

The problem with that approach is that altpdftex and friends are meant to
be a direct replacement for pdftex and friends.

Hence, you can run
    pdflatex foo
and
    altpdflatex foo

and get the same result only via tex+dvips+distiller.

That is nice too and it is indeed a better interface.

However, I would like to follow whatever TeX does. If all of TeX changes to

    pdfetex lambda ....

I will too ;-)

I think that you should submit additional stuff to all architectures
(i.e. into the source tree, rather than into your bin directory), or
else just distribute additional stuff yourself. It is not good to add
something from your local development setup, into just one of the unix
architectures.

Again, it's better to make changes not in your bin directory, but in
the source tree. Otherwise we will end up with each binary directory
containing it's own set of files added by someone who happened to
build it for TeX Live.

Having them as symlinks wouldn't be any better, i'm afraid.

1) You have altpdfcont-en. Do you have cont-en binary? ;-)

2) Why you added only a few altpdf* scripts? A lot of them are
   missing! Then add a few more dozens of them for all other formats. ;-)

So just get rid of this silliness, and use just one altpdf script. :-)

I apologize for this phrase which may look rude (which was not
intentional, and i realized that after sending the message).

I just wanted to say that it does not make sense to have tons of
altpdf*** scripts for several reasons (main of which is that you
cannot guarantee to have altpdf*** for every possible format; also it
bloats the binary dirs), and it is much better to use just one script.

I agree. Note we do not disagree that one scritp is better.

altpdftex was written originally when also for TeX Live we had a system 
where you had multiple links to the same program. The texlinks program 
is even still in TeX Live.

Though I agree that your idea is better (in fact I argued the same with 
respect to tex4ht a year ago and Eitan made the switch), I'd hate to do 
that now. The reason is that I ship a distribution which has both 
TL2003 and TL2004 available so users can go back to TL2003 if they have 
problems with TL2004. But if both would have a different calling 
sequence for altpdf, the current frontends would have to be reworked, 
in other words, it would immediately stop working with existing 
frontends. I'd hate to put that to my unsuspecting and *very* 
atechnical users.

A migration would entail for me to produce an alternate, say 
newaltpdftex with your syntax, the release that side by side with the 
current setup and then end support for the old stuff a year from now to 
give everybody (frontend designers who rely on altpdflatex and friends 
to be available) time to migrate.

It is a good plan, and I'll look into this. But not immediately 
(pressed for time), sorry.

kpsewhich does not set $engine. The real engines do:
  TEXFORMATS=.;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//

With an empty $engine, this gives
  TEXFORMATS=.;$TEXMF/web2c/{,}//

Maybe kpathsea could optimize and remove duplicates from further down 
the line in an expansion. They are useless anyway.

E.g. {aap,noot,,aap,} would become {aap,noot,}

what about switching to new way in TeX Live? it doesn't contain your
frontends; you may still distribute old altpdf*** files in your
distribution?

to switch to new calling convention, it is sufficient to change

calledas=`basename "$0"`

in the beginning of the script to

calledas="altpdf$1"
shift

(and update doc strings).

Also, it seems a good idea to have
	engine = unset
in texmf.cnf just like
	progname = unset

I will have to do it slightly differently. I can make the new behaviour 
depending on the name (I just can't think of a new name since altpdftex 
is already taken). You can then have both behaviours in one script. I 
won't change the behaviour of the current script names, but a new 
script name with different behaviour is OK. altpdftex will then be 
removed from TeX Live sources and replaced with a new name script.

I'll look into it.

    Also, it seems a good idea to have

    in texmf.cnf just like
            progname = unset

Sounds sensible.  I did it, for the TeX Live texmf.cnf in Master.

Most likely german's catcode settings for " interfere here (german.sty
is notorious to cause trouble with quite a few packages for this
reason).

I'd recommend using
\usepackage[german]{babel} % or ngerman for NDR
instead which switches the active characters on only at the start of
the document.

*May be* the reason is that german.sty makes " active : so hexa codes 
("a9, eg) can't be defined after loading german.sty.

Solution use \usepackage[german]{babel} or load german the last or use 
only decimal codes in the package.

Of course I am not quite sure that this is the reason of the clash...

Is there any reason why doc/latex/emp/manual.ps.gz isn't actually
called empman.ps.gz (given that the DVI file is called empman.dvi)?
Saying `texdoc empman' would then immediately give the expected
result.

You must be using an old version of microtype.
In the latest version (1.3) from CTAN, this has already been solved.

FYI, the announcement from Klaus to the TeX user groups asking for the orders.

It will take several days to put the disc images together, as usual.  So
I'd like to make this Sunday the final cutoff for changes, including the
doc translations.  (This is the same time the user groups need to send
their orders by.)  It almost always takes several iterations on the doc,

Subject: [tug-board] LUG-boards: TeX Collection: Call for orders (first and
	last one)

Dear LUG leader,
dear reader,

we are in the final stage of the production of 
   TeX-Collection 2004 (proTeXt+CTAN+TeXLive)

As last year there will be a production of TeX Collection, but there are
some news:

This time, DVD and CDs are packaged seperately and can be ordered
individually.

TeX Collection will be a single DVD-9 (double layered DVD), consisting
of
- proTeXt, a TeX distribution based on MiKTeX, WinEdt(eval version)/
  TeXnicCenter, Ghostscript/GSview, put together by University of Hagen,
  Germany
- CTAN snapshot as usual
- TeXLive in the state of in about two weeks.

TeX Collection will be packed in a single cardbox (again: no more CDs
included in TeX Collection) and be produced by Lehmanns bookstore in
Germany.
The price for user groups will be approx. 0.70 Euro (0.90 USD) plus shipping.
Orders from EU countries will be plus VAT if you don't supply a valid
VAT number.

Additional to TeX Collection there will be two CDs:
One CD with proTeXt (TeX for Windows based on MiKTeX as explained above),
one CD with TeX Live.
Each of them will be in a single cardbox, too. The price for user groups
will be approx. 0.50 Euro (0.70 USD) per CD, plus shipping plus the
VAT thing for EU orders as explained above.
Remind that the contents of both CDs is already included on DVD.

Production is scheduled for end of this month, so hopefuly they will be
ready in early december. To hold this deadline it is important that you
place your orders as soon as possible, latest Sunday, Nov. 21 or
Monday, Nov. 22 morning.
Please send an email to cdrom@dante.de with the following data:
Numbers of pieces for TeX Collection DVD, proTeXt CD and TeX Live CD,
shipping address and VAT number (for EU orders, otherwise you will be
charged VAT).

For those who miss CTAN snapshot on CDs: There will be no production of
CTAN CD sets by Lehmanns this year as nobody wanted last year's set.
But there will be a small production by TUG, so if you want CTAN on CDs,
please address to TUG.

The cover drafts aren't ready yet but expect them to be announced the next
days.

Regards
Klaus
vice president of DANTE

I can add to this that the same problem does *not* appear on the same

problem with TL2004/pdfLaTeX/png on Mac OS X.

A bug in libpng-1.2.7.
Please try libpng-1.2.8beta4.

Dear all,

This Saturday, Nov 20, starting at 08.00 MET, the central DAIMI server 
room will be shut down in order to install an UPS (emergency power supply).
The electricians will probably finish their work within a couple of
hours. Afterwards, the servers will have to be restarted. Additionally,
the mail filtering machine will be upgraded. It is therefore difficult
to give an exact estimate of the total duration of the service interruption.

Given that this is the case. Is this a bug serious enough to warrant a

If the fix was easy, we could consider recompiling.

But inserting a beta libpng library is not easy, and in any case, is
likely to lead to more problems than it solves.

So I think we're going to have live with this one.

libpng 1.2.8beta4 is available. I find this a difficult call. I think I 
am not in favour of putting a beta library in, but I am in favour of 
getting Thanh's last fixes in. Thos will be important for people who 
use pdfTeX.

If there is a libpng on the system outside the TeXLive tree, will it be 
used?

No. Our binaries are typically statically linked against our
libraries.

    I am in favour of getting Thanh's last fixes 

Oh, I'm in favor "in theory", but it's not a simple patch + recompile.
>From what I gather from Martin, there is a pdftex beta cycle to go

period (certainly weeks, probably months).

And I'm really not in favor of just slamming in a beta libpng library
(let alone a whole new pdftex source) at the last second.

No release is ever perfect, and there's always going to be another one ...

Oh well, I can adapt easily enough when it does change.

I do suggest (as I have done earlier) a 3-tier source release
1. A source freeze in a tar.bz2 which accompanies the iso image (if the 
image not already contains the sources, I have not checked this)
2. source, the directory with a stable release. This may change over 
the year and stuff goes in there when source.development is considered 
to contain a stable release.
3. source.development, the work directory

Adapting source over the year (just as Master is maintained) gives 
redistributors like me the possibility to have a more finegrained 
*stable* release policy.

In short: I am advocating a 'source' directory upgrade policy where it 
contains a stable situation (but with updates since the last CD 
release) whereas source.development does not need to be stable.

Only 4.5 people use Thanh's protruding characters, and they are all more 
than
capable of upgrading their binaries after release. My instinct is to say no.

Uh what?  The pdfcprot package is in pretty common use and is probably
the most important reason in the first place that TeXlive and teTeX
have changed to use the pdftex executable also for "normal" LaTeX.

With all due respect, but you are quite off kilter with your reasoning
here, Sebastian.

You are mistaken. In the Mac world there are quite a few people using 
it (and the microtype package).

And most of them would not know where to begin upgrading their pdfTeX 
from source.

I already fixed the PNG bug for my release by installing libpng 
1.2.8beta4 (seems to be a bugfix-only release with respect to 1.2.7, 
quite saf) on my system, configuring my TL2004 run to compile against 
the system png library.

As soon as pdfTeX is updated, I can do the same.

It is commonly referred to in the Usenet groups I frequent, and I use
it myself commonly in production-quality work.  This includes setups
for which the customer has installed TeXlive.

Pass.  I just wanted to state that if your above reason was the only
one to live with a possibly broken pdfTeX, I would consider it quite
dubious.

I can't say anything about other possibly valid reasons.

hm, you're not telling that the latex users would have stuck to dvitex if 
protruding was not part of the game? lucky us then that that decision was made 
by sebastian and not 'the abstract cohort of tex users'

anyhow, indeed the interest in esp protruding is quite large

well, make it 4.5 percent of the texies and it already sounds better; i think 
that sebastian was refering to the xml world, where micro typography is not an 
issue at all -)

Message-ID: <200411161832.iAGIWG807945@f7.net>

    I do suggest (as I have done earlier) a 3-tier source release
    1. A source freeze in a tar.bz2 which accompanies the iso image (if the 
    image not already contains the sources, I have not checked this)

It does.  But having the released .tar.bz2 in the source repository is
good, anyway.

(Except for Fabrice's sources -- Fabrice, can you *please* upload them
or make them available somewhere?  Once again, I'm not asking you to do
anything except make a zip file ...)

    2. source, the directory with a stable release. This may change over 
    the year and stuff goes in there when source.development is considered 
    to contain a stable release.

That makes sense to me.  If (after the release, if we ever get to make
one) changes in source would help you (or anyone else), please propose
them.

The only issue is that there is only one Master and one set of installed
binaries, and they would (presumably) come from source.development.  So
a new infrastructure (with the released Master) would have to be
constructed to do any testing.

Best,
k

There is no real issue. Because it is always to draw from p4 with a 
certain date. For TL2003 I draw from source @ some date in sep 2003, 
for TL2004 I will then draw from some other date. What is a possible 
problem then is that I need two accounts, I guess, because switching 
would be very expensive, build-wise.

Master is not a problem for another reason. Packages that are updated 
often are compatible with older versions of TeX. So my "TL2003" based 
setup has some parts that are from today. So far I have no problems 
with that approach.

The problem is that the bold font is set up inside the tabular
environment, where `&' has a different meaning. When microtype tries to
set the protrusion factors for the ampersand, it stumbles. The solution,
for now, is to load the bold font manually earlier; to be on the safe
side, you can even do that in the preamble (after microtype):

 > %---------------------  snip!  --------------------------
\documentclass{article}

\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ppl}
\usepackage[DVIoutput,expansion=false]{microtype}

{\fontfamily{\rmdefault}\bfseries\selectfont}

\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{c}
     \textbf{Ha!}
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
 > %---------------------  snap!  ---------------------------

Then, the bold font doesn't need to be set up inside the tabular
environment.

I'll upload a bug fix version soon (poor Jim, who's just announced the
latest version today).

Robert.

Message-ID: <15DB8D1A-387F-11D9-B645-003065B3343E@rna.nl>

I would like to propose the following directory structure for TL2005 
and teTeX (in the hope that they will finally become unified and I can 
have a real link between TL and teTeX and my installation stuff so that 
they are interchangeable):

	.../programs/<archname>/bin (contains binaries like pdfetex)
	.../programs/<archname>/lib (contains libkpathsea.a)
	.../programs/include
	.../programs/man
	.../programs/info
	.../programs/texmf (contains .tcx and .pool files)
	.../foundation/texmf-dist (contains basic support stuff, like it is 
now)
	.../foundation/texmf-foo (any other separate tree maintained by a 
redistributor, like me)
	.../local/texmf (where local changes and additions are made)

The reasons are:
1. Make a clear separation between stuff that is hardware architecture 
dependent and that what is not
2. Make a clear separation between the programs (TeX is a compiler 
after all) and the macro packages and stuff
3. Make a clear separation between local and installed
4. Unify TL and teTeX

this assumes that the architectures are in sync, so if this is the way to go, i 
suggest:

     .../programs/<archname>/texmf (contains .tcx and .pool and .fmt files)

(well, there can be an engine subpath as well)

(for years now i use texmf-<arch> here which makes it possible to have out of 
sync architectures)

I see no reason at all to distribute
  .../programs/<archname>/lib (contains libkpathsea.a)
with TeX Live or teTeX.

I see no reason to distribute
  .../programs/include
At the very least, kpathsea incluse directory is also architecture dependent,
do you should then put it in .../programs/<archname>/include
But again, there's no need to distribute this with TeX Live or teTeX.

I personally don't see much gain in introducing the "programs",
"foundation" and "local" directories.

What I wanted to propose is to create a separate directory with script
binaries, instead of duplicating them in each architecture.

Are we going to move to CVS instead of perforce after this year release?
If so, wouldn't it be more natural to get rid of source.development
and use only one source, but control the development and stable sources
as branches?

so after the move to CVS, there will be no separate source.development

i don't care either. i think any of CVS or SVN will be much better

IIRC, sebastian suggested to use svn, but others didn't want to use is (II also 
RC, my first though was that sebastians vote should be fevoured)

svn is quite nice (esp the latest file system additions) [on windows esp nice in 
combination with tortoise]

The file that you mention are independend of the architecture. I think
that you are misusing the term "<arch>" for some kind of versioning.

The technical merits of the different source control systems is beside
the point.  I have not argued for cvs on those grounds, it is probably
the least advanced of any of them (although still actively maintained).

However, cvs has two major advantages:

1) far more people know cvs than any other system, so the pool of
   potential contributors to the project is greatly enlarged.

2) sarovar supports it right now, and so we can have a public project
   using the most commonly available tools, again hopefully enlarging
   the pool of contributors.

Since Subversion is pretty much command line compatible, this is not
much of a concern in itself.

Well, I think TeXlive would be a good project for giving Subversion a
try: it would appear _very_ painful to use a version control system
uncapable of moving files around for TeXlive, like CVS.

hm, i consider them part of the binary, the fact that for some reason tex keeps 
its strings (pool) ourside the binary and loves to dump is not common practice 
for programs; and ... since on a server, serving several platforms, binaries can 
be out of sync ... pool files can be out of sync ... and format files can be 
incompatible

versioning is another matter; i guess you're not suggesting that we should use a 
version subpath to distinguish versions (per arch).

Right, but these files are architecture independend. When derived from the
same version of the sources, they can be shared by different platforms.

You can get "out of sync", but only by using the wrong version. You
don't get "out of sync" by using the wrong architecture.

So, in fact, you are using multiple versions of these files; each of
them would work on any platform (if used with the right vresion of
the binaries).

This is what I mean by saying that your texmf-<arch> is in reality more
a texmf-<some-version>.

indeed, but i often use different versions of binaries so that's why i put those 
file in the bin related trees; i can often get linux, windows, mac binaries, but 
  for or instance the 64 bit ones i'm more dependent; also, thanh makes me djgpp 
binaries of experimental versions,

this makes me wonder, since web2c converts ... is it difficult to get rid of the 
pool file by just moving the strings in the c code?

if Thomas is willing, it sounds reasonable. The move away from Perforce
would be a good time to make a rearrangement like this.

I don't like the word "foundation", though.  I would prefer "base".

Talking of the transition from Perforce, I suspect this is best done
by one person who can concentrate on it for  a couple of days. Would
anyone like to volunteer? I am assuming at this point that we would
lose the history from Perforce, and make a clean start. To preserve
the history is doable, but will require someone to write a non-trivial 
script.

No, but consider building pdftex without png (and other image formats)
in the future.  There is a big industry exploiting bugs in image
libraries that result in too much churn.  Image manipulations, including
conversion to pdf, are best done elsewhere.  I view the png support
in pdftex as a convenience, but even a great convenience to me is not
worth a minute of the time of the people who maintain pdftex and the
distros.  I'd rather see pdftex issue an informative message when
someone tries to use a graphics library:

   "This version of pdftex does not support inclusion of XXX images.
    Consider using other tools to convert your images to PDF format."

Or use a png->pdf tool, of which there are many that are well
supported by people who know knowing about TeX.  This

This was discussed at the DANTE meeting in Darmstadt: It's
probably easy, but there are installations where translated pool
files are used.

yes (it's a kind of repackaging) and no (transformation needed in most cases)

there are a couple of axis involved when including bitmaps: compression, 
colorspace, depth, predictors; so, it's probably best to talk of png, tiff, jpeg 
compression and not so much in terms of 'embedding as png' (it's mostly png 
predictors that pdf thinks of); so, during embedding some kind of conversion can 
take place, although sometimes the bitstream can be passed on (used) directly.

png does not need that much handling, tiff is worse: of the hundreds of variants 
only a few are supported (the fax ones for instance, high b/w compression, 
probably there for this 'use pdf as container for scanned documents' game)

concerning png inclusion: the most prominent problem there is in transparant 
(and masking) applications, since then it has to be hooked into the pdftex 
resource (dict) handling and such; that kind of interplay will always be needed 
when embedding graphics

concerning inclusion: so far we could get away with the fuzzy grouping stuff 
(probably something closely related to editing in illustrator)

Dear all,
I am trying to install the new texlive2003 from the CD install (I had an 
old 1998 version) on an alpha Compaq server with Tru64 Unix operating 
system, which is not belonging to the group of the supported one. None of 
the possible options appearing in the manual seem to be working. Not even 
the compilation of the sources from scratch. Yet, the old 1998 version I 
was able to install it with no problem into a similar (older) machine.
Any possible suggestions/tips/tricks would be greatly appreciated!
Many thanks in advance.
Best.

Please try downloading the current test ISO for 2004 from
http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Images/test-texlive-inst.iso.

You will definitely need to compile from the sources.  If the
compilation fails, send the commands you ran and the error messages that
resulted, etc.

If you do eventually get binaries, we'd like to distribute them from the
TeX Live web site.  (It's too late to put them on the CD for this year.)
Would that be ok with you?  And if you'd like to compile Alpha binaries
in general for future releases, I can keep you informed ...

Thanks,
karl

Thanks for writing.  Regrettably, there will not be a Windows installer

Windows binaries included, but they can only be installed from Unix,
paradoxically enough.)

If you'd like to test the protext release, which is a project built on
miktex and which we are going to include, please see
http://tug.org/protext for information and links to the latest test
version for download.

    Just out of curiosity how close is it to being complete?

We sincerely hope to start making the final images next week.  Just a
hope, no promises, you understand :).

There are many shades of "understanding".  pdftexdir/writepng.c uses 
libpng (image.h pulls in png.h) to parse the PNG file for the color model 
and get the image data, which are uncompressed and then recompressed, so 
zlib is used via libpng.  Not all png files are supported (does PDF handle 
16-bit images?).  TeX users are better off saving their images as PDF
directly and bypassing the PNG format.  In a perfiect world PNG files
would be 1-page PDF's that contain only images -- maybe this will
be the turbo-PNG format.

Since you have to do the install with *n*x, I don't think there has been 
much testing on Windows XP SP2.  Here is what I did:

1.  start with a minimal install of TL2003 to get the registry and path
    settings.

2.  On linux mount the .iso with a loop device, run the install script and
    ask for the Win32 binaries and xemtex

3. copy the resulting tree over to a Win32 system (preferrably one already
    running TL2003 so you can just edit the existing registry entries for
    the new path).

This is very nice for sites that have been using TL2003 on Win32 and want 
to keep texmf trees consistent between *n*x and Win32. Anyone who doesn't 
like it really should consider dumping Win32 and running linux.

OK, I'm being grumpy because a Win32 virus just zapped a PC (supposedly 
protected by automatic updates) being used by a PhD student in the 
final hours of preparing for an important workshop.

It's probably a well-known problem, but just downloaded test TL 2004 
(20041120).

When installing the "inst" version, just changing the installation 
directory, i get the following types of errors on FC3.

Unpacking zip files for packages...

and ultimately the file attributes are wrong on those files.

When installing the larger "live" version, everything runs smoothly.

As I said, it's probably documented somewhere, and given that it's a 
test build, you should know what you're doing, but assumed it would be 
mentioned somewhere.

Nope, never saw it before.  Glad you looked, we are close to burning the

    Unpacking zip files for packages...

It only complained about those four symbolic links?  Because there are a
lot more than that.

    and ultimately the file attributes are wrong on those files.

Meaning what?  It doesn't create a symlink?

In any case, I surmise this is something about the unzip in Fedora Core 3
and the zip we used to create them (see below) not being compatible.  Sigh.
I'm not sure what we can do about it or how to work around it.

The inst image basically just contains zip files of the various
packages (while the live image leaves them uncompressed).  These zip
files are in the archive/ directory at the top level, for instance,
bin-amstex.i386-linux.zip.  Are there any options or compatibility
settings or anything which get the right results?

Thanks,
karl

For what it's worth, the zip files are being created with:

Can you grab some of the zip files by hand from the CD and test them? 
The only
two possibilities are that the zip files are genuinely corrupt (seems 
very unlikely)
or that your copy of unzip is weird. Again, given the stability of zip 
over quite some years,
this too seems unlikely.

we have changed nothing of this part of the system, and I have not seen any
report before like this, so its puzzling. FC3 should not be that 
different from
other systems.

Hope that helps.

            UnZip 5.51 of 22 May 2004, by Info-ZIP.  Maintained by C. Spieler.
            
A new version of unzip et al.  Very interesting.

I download the original unzip 5.51 source from 
  http://sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch/ftp/mirror/infozip/src/
and compiled it on a machine running Red Hat workstation 2.1, using
gcc 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.2 2.96-128.7.2) for Unix (Linux ELF) on Nov 21 2004.

The resulting unzip binary was able to unpack bin-amstex.i386-linux.zip
without an error:

$ unzip -v $einst/archive/*amstex*i386-linux*
Archive:  /home/ftp/texlive/Contents/testinst/archive/
  inflating: bin/i386-linux/altpdfamstex  
    linking: bin/i386-linux/amstex   -> pdfetex 
  inflating: texmf/lists/bin-amstex.i386-linux  
finishing deferred symbolic links:
  bin/i386-linux/amstex  -> pdfetex

This seems to indicate that the bug is in some change that RH has made
to the original source, or (less likely) a compiler bug.

Could you try compiling the original source on FC3 and see if that
works?  And if it does, report the bug to RH? 

Thanks,
k

Unbelievable.  I downloaded the original sources, as suggested, and 
unzipped one of the problem files.  It works properly, just as it did 
for you.  I don't know how FC can break something like unzip.

Original unzip gives the following:
$ unzip-5.51/unzip bin-latex.i386-linux.zip
    Archive:  bin-latex.i386-linux.zip
        linking: bin/i386-linux/latex    -> pdfetex
      inflating: texmf/lists/bin-latex.i386-linux
    finishing deferred symbolic links:
      bin/i386-linux/latex   -> pdfetex

FC3 unzip gives the following:
$ unzip bin-latex.i386-linux.zip
    Archive:  bin-latex.i386-linux.zip
        linking: bin/i386-linux/latex    warning:  symbolic link 
(bin/i386-linux/latex) failed
    error:  zipfile probably corrupt (segmentation violation)

Sorry about bringing up something that is specific to FC3.

Subject: Bug, presumably in texlive 2004

I have just tried typesetting a paper which worked OK before, and 
works OK with dvips etc, but with texLive 2004, I am getting 
messages of the form (when typesetting with TeX + Ghostscript)

! LaTeX Error: Unknown graphics extension: .Sketch.ps.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type H <return> for immediate help.
 ...

l.127 ...ics[width=1.0in]{Sashikumar02.Sketch.ps}}


It seems the name a.b.ps is confusing it, where it thinks that the 
extension is .b.ps instead of .ps (its looking at the first "." 
instead of the last ".").

It seems to me that texlive 2004 should behave like other tex 
systems (eg texlive 2003), and use the last .  not the first, to 
determine the extension.


Best wishes

Ralph

Something is going on, but it might be a bug in another class.

A testcase can be found here

	ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/testcase.zip

This example works fine in TL2003 but it does not in TL2004. It seems 
to me the class in the test case has some parts that might need 
updating (e.g. it contains its own copy of verbatim.sty and it does 
some \ifpdf stuff), but I have no idea what causes the problem.

probably this behavior occurs because we switched to pdfetex as our
engine for latex (and because of some unportable code which tests for
\pdfoutput in egpubl_SM.cls).

but, my testing with TeX Live 2004 does not show this error. I suspect
that your latex format file was not generated properly (i.e. via
fmtutil, without pdftex-dvi.tex included).

Thanks for the test file.

I suspect that the following is going on:

1) latex in TeX Live 2004 is based on pdfetex engine

2) your latex.fmt file was not generated properly (i.e. by calling
   "fmtutil --byfmt latex"). As a result, the \pdfoutput macro
   remained defined, because pdftex-dvi.tex was not read when making a
   format file.

3) the egpubl_SM.cls file contains some inportable code like this:

\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined \pdffalse % we are not running PDFLaTeX
\else
  \pdfoutput=1 % we are running PDFLaTeX
  \pdftrue
\fi

   This makes the graphics package think that we're running under
   pdflatex, instead of latex. As a result, you get an error, because
   pdflatex does not understand PS or EPS files.

To solve this problem, please try to re-generate the latex format
prolerly, i.e. by running "fmtutil --byfmt latex".

Best,
v.

If Ralph is running TL2004 from my redistribution, the fmt files are 
generated by fmtutil --all. I do not think this could be a problem.

I think this is the likely reason.

Thanks. Now I can say that the error comes because of the file
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/config/latex.ini
included in your TeX distribution.

The file latex.ini which is included into TeX Live 2004 distribution
contains the following:

===============================
% Thomas Esser, 1998. public domain.

\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined \else
  \ifx\pdfoutput\relax \else
    % We're building the latex format with the pdfetex engine (started 2004).
    % See this file for details.
    \input pdftex-dvi.tex
  \fi
\fi

% the usual format initialization.
\scrollmode
\input latex.ltx
\endinput
===============================

I think that the file latex.ini in your TeX distribution (is it from
Gerben's TeX distribution?) is not the same, and should be replaced
with the correct version.

In other words, your TeX distribution is not a TeX Live 2004
distribution, but some mix of old stuff with new stuff.

Best,
v.

My distribution is based on TL2004 and teTeX (for the texmf tree). My  
texmf tree is based on tetex-texmf-2.99.3.20041109-beta.tar.gz, or the  
beta from Nov 8. If anything (see dates in header) it looks newer but  
it *is* different.

My redistribution is based on a combination of TeX Live and teTeX (for  
the texmf tree, because Thomas' texmf tree is well balanced and has a  
size that can be handled by internet downloads (which is not true for  
TeX Live)). Not so much old and new. Both are from november 2004.

So, the result is, \pdfoutput ends up being defined in pdfetex-based
latex in gwTeX?  That is indeed like teTeX.  So that is fine/your
choice, and the input file will have to be fixed.

Problems like Ralph's are exactly why we chose to do the pdftex-dvi
thing for TL, to retain compatible behavior with umpteen years of
existing files.

I'm pretty sure I junked my old texlive 2003 stuff, and did a fresh

TeX will read anything (e.g., foo.bar), though.  The extension only
matters if trying to find it by default.

I don't think there has ever been support for case-folding on extensions.
For example:

    $ touch xx.TEX
    $ tex xx
    ...
    ! I can't find file `xx'.

And, more analogously to your TTF case:

    $ cp `kpsewhich cmr10.tfm` foobar.TFM
    $ tex
    **\font\x=foobar \relax
    ...
    ! Font \x=foobar not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.

It seems like a reasonable feature to add, though, at first blush.

Yes it's not critical at all. It's just that still many TTF fonts come
with large letters (maybe by MSDOS tradition), and then even when its in
the current directory and you see it (ls) and tell its complete name,
ttf2afm still can't find it - which might astonish casual users. I won't
care for kpathsea not finding it elsewhere. But in the current dir... (i
thought that there would be just a switch for it.)

this is one reason why i always dowcase all font file names, font vendors are 
very creative

(actually, i downcase the whole texmftree occasionally -)

All the TL documentation translations are now in the depot.  (Thanks

As far as I know, the only outstanding issue are the bzip2/gzip Windows

I am updating the images now, should be done in about an hour.  Please

I think we should make no more changes unless they are really absolutely

Let's plan to give the final image to Manfred tomorrow, barring disaster.

Yet another interesting bug (presumably in pdftex-1.20a):
When a word is hyphenated automatically, the resulting
hyphen is correctly protruded into the right margin,
but a hyphen part of a compung word in French is not protruded
at all. Looks _really_ bad when both kinds of hyphens
occure on two consecutive lines...
 
Here is a test file showing the problem:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\setlength\textwidth{12,5cm}
\setlength\parindent{0cm}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}

\usepackage[protrusion=true,expansion=false]{microtype}

\end{document}

The bug _does not_ occur with TL2003 (pdftex 1.11a)...
I was told it is corrected in pdfTeX-1.20b, anybody can
confirm?

Your example gives the same protrusoin for both hyphens using pdfeTeX,

the problem for making an installer is that it has to either read zip 
files, or the filesystem. do you have
ideas on how to do that?

Making it do both ZIPs and filesystem would probably require hard coding 
everything and then simply checking which version of TeXLive is on the 
CD-ROM, but since you already have a Unix-based script to do this have you 
considered perhaps converting everything to Perl (or other scripting 
language) and making a Win32 GUI front end for it? This would probably be 
the easiest as you'd really only have to maintain one install script for all 
OS's and the OS dependent Win32 GUI would provide the necessary feedback 
like required dependancies, etc, all fed from the master script.

Have a look at: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ it is an open source script 
based installer but provides a GUI interface, many open source projects use 
this as the installer tool. Have a look at the screen shots: 
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/features/screenshots/ these are of projects done 
with it.

Hi Jason,

Thanks very much for writing.  This is a big subject.

    I am interested in making a Windows installer (using InstallShield
    or the free Nullsoft NSIS) of TexLive 2004 for Windows. 

FWIW, Fabrice Popineau (long-time maintainer of fpTeX, more or less the
Windows branch of TeX Live) has been working on an InstallShield-based
installer for most of the year.  Perhaps you could help (I'm not sure if
it's in a state where a collaborative effort is possible).

    Could you tell me what steps are required to install a TeXLive
    distribution?

The easiest way to understand this is to do it.  I think the best place
to download TL 2003 for Windows would be from fptex.org.  There were
updates since the actual 2003 discs were cut.

Reading the TL 2003 doc will also give you a sense of what it's about,
there are long sections on the Windows install and maintenance.
http://www.fptex.org/fptex/fptex.html

The TL 2003 doc is at:
http://tug.org/ftp/historic/systems/texlive/2003/live.pdf
(there are images in that same dir)

    What did the old 2003 installer do? 

I know it was homegrown and not based on InstallShield or anything else,
and that's about the extent of my knowledge.  Fabrice approximately
GUIfied the Unix installer, so doing a Unix TL install would also be
good experience.

    Did it create any registry keys, etc?

Perhaps Fabrice can answer (I don't know).

    Sebastian> the problem for making an installer is that it has to
    either read zip files, or the filesystem. do you have ideas on how
    to do that?

Seb, the existence of the two different distributions doesn't seem like
that big of a problem?  Clearly a Windows installer can/must do
different things from the different sources, just like the Unix installer.

The stopper, in my recollection, is that Fabrice found that
InstallShield cannot feasibly support .zip files, or anything but .cab,
and there no libraries or utilities for Unix supporting compressed .cab,
only uncompressed.  Therefore the same compressed distribution cannot be
used for both Windows and Unix anyway.

However, this NSIS thing apparently supports zlib, bzip, and (something
new to me) lzma.  So that seems promising.
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/features/

    Jason> have you considered perhaps converting everything to Perl (or
    other scripting language)

Yes, I've considered rewriting the installer in Perl.  But in the
absence of a compelling reason to do so, I/we have spent our time on
other things.  The idea that such an installer could actually work (in
practice) on win32 seemed remote.

    and making a Win32 GUI front end for it?
    
Well that would be a compelling reason.  Is it really possible? 

After poking around their web pages, I am not clear on what NSIS really
is (although it sounds great :).  A library that an application links
with?  An application that produces another application (the installer)?
Written in C?  C++?  Can it glue into Perl reasonably?


P.S. Everyone, I updated the images one more (last?) time.  Manfred is
putting together the final production set tomorrow at noon, German time ...

Try it!  The old TL installer offered a couple defaults or could present
a huge tree of packages to select, similar to cygwin's setup.  It was
fragile and in my experience most users found the tree too hard to 
navigate, so if they needed a particular package that wasn't in the
default configuration, they would get the macros from CTAN or a
co-author and copy them into texmf-local.

With disk space, bandwidth costs, and resources for maintaining TL all on 
the decline, it is reasonable to take a very coarse grained approach. 
Install everything with a "1-click" tool and, if you need changes, 
uninstall and "redo from start".  Isn't this what most Windows packages do 
anyway? For the minority who have more limited resources, suggest they 
use linux and then provide instructions for manually installing updated 
packages from the .zip files.

Managing TeX is a difficult problem because the existing base of macro 
packages and tools contains diverse approaches to installation and 
documentation.  TL is a valiant effort to address this, but part of any 
long term solution should be some effort to provide package authors with 
guidelines for making packages TL-ready so the TL team doesn't have to do 
as much work.

TL2003's installer does create registry keys as well as adjusting the PATH 
variable.  Once you have the registry keys, you can switch between TL2003 
and TL2004 by swapping directory trees.  On *n*x you can switch between TL 
versions by editing the PATH, although some documentation (man pages, 
info) need other changes (e.g., to /etc/man.conf) to keep the docs in sync 
with the version you are running.  You can share texmf trees on the 
network between all your systems (linux, unix, OS-X, and Win32).

TeX doesn't seem to get along with any of the unix package management 
systems: linux distros put all of teTeX in a small number of packages. 
There is considerable interest in much finer control.  To me the biggest 
practical issue arises when a user needs a new version of some latex macro 
package or even a bigger package like ConTeXt, installs it in $HOME/texmf 
or (texmf-local on a PC), and then either a) discovers they were given bad 
advice and need to remove the package, or b) 2 years later has a problem 
and discovers they aren't getting the same version of the package others 
have.  Finding all the files that need to removed can be difficult. 
There has been talk of tools to help manage texmf trees.  It would be nice 
to have a database of file locations (e.g., ls-R) that also includes the 
"package" name, md5sum, and version of each file.

One model is the R stats package.  This has two elements: a base package 
that is installed using "standard" tools, and a method to install updates. 
On unix, however, R updates are .tar.gz files and require development 
tools while many Win32 updates are available in "pre-compiled" .zip form.
I think R would benefit from having a bundled "developers" package to
make it easier for users to do more extensive debugging, etc.  R has a
fined-grained way to load packages at run-time, so the issue of removing
a package that conflicts with something else is not as critical.

Its been talked about several times. But no-one has ever found the 
energy to tackle it.
The current script dates back to TeX Live 1, when Thomas created first 
version.
It has not changed dramatically since then. Yes, it could be rewritten 
in Perl, though
you'd have to assume everyone had Perl installed. Putting a GUI on it 
would be good,
of course.

The bottom line is that production of TeX Live has been a matter of 
firefighting for the
last 4-5 years; people who have worked on it (and a lot of effort has 
been expended!)
have been improving the product itself, and no-one has wanted to take on
a rewrite of the installer.

I freely confess that I personally don't want to work on the installer, 
as I'd
rather concentrate on producing Linux .deb or .rpm packages.

If you have some time to spend on a new portable install script, it 
would be a really
excellent contribution.

Hello,

I was using TeX Live 2004 development snapshots very happily and was not 
planning to upgrade to the final official version because those snapshots 
were only a few weeks old (the time when Karl Berry requested the re-build 
of binaries).

However, a friend of mine whom I advised to upgrade from TeX Live 2003 to 
TeX Live 2004 reported a huge performance increase for the sort of stuff 
he was doing (which is quite similar to my stuff as he is also doing 
Bibles, only interlinear russian-greek ones whilst mine are in greek and 
hebrew).

Now I am hesitating whether I should upgrade as well? The reason I am 
asking here is because sometimes (e.g. for Linux kernel development) the 
software contains various "debug checks" which are enabled during 
development and disabled in the final release which can cause a serious 
performance increase even though the software is otherwise exactly the 
same.

So, I am asking TeX Live experts --- are there any such things practiced 
here? I.e. could it be that the final official iso is much faster than a 
development snapshot taken almost immediately before because of such 
"debug code" being disabled?

Kind regards
Tigran

    here? I.e. could it be that the final official iso is much faster than a 
    development snapshot taken almost immediately before because of such 
    "debug code" being disabled?

No, we don't do anything like that.  The binaries in the release are
exactly the ones you built.

Perhaps your friend's installation is much faster simply because he did
it from scratch or something, and the ls-R files are getting built now?
Or maybe it's a matter of the compilers being better?  Or if he's on
x86_64, maybe your binaries are a lot faster than the generic i386-linux
ones?  Just wild guesses ...

However, I still advise upgrading to the final release, not for the sake
of the binaries, since they are unchanged, but because there were
numerous small fixes to packages and documentation since then.  It's
unlikely that the inconsistency would ever cause trouble, but it could
save you some time in the unlikely event ...

Cheers,
k

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2004 final vs development: speed of TeX
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1101825246.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

Tigran Aivazian <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk> asks about the speed of
TeX in the final TeX Live 2004 release.

The most likely cause of slowdown for TeX is excessive searching for
files.  Remember, TeX is just a filter: its processing time in most
cases is almost linear in the input size, and all of its activity,
except for file access, is in memory, and its memory footprint is
relatively small (a few MB) by today's standards.  Thus, it is
unlikely to be swapped out to disk during execution.

TeX is fast: on high-end Intel IA-32 systems, TeX typesets the TeXbook
at more than 670 pages/second (3.2GHz Xeon) --- less than a second for
a complex book is pretty amazing.

To record file access patterns of ANY program, not just TeX, the best
tool on Unix systems is a system-call tracer: strace on GNU/Linux,
truss on Solaris, ktrace on {Free,Net,Open}BSD, par on SGI IRIX, and
trace on ancient SunOS.  Here is a typical run on GNU/Linux:

	strace -f -o foo.log tex myfile.tex

Then search the log file for instances of file-related system calls:

	egrep 'open|access' foo.log

If your ls-R caches are out-of-date, or you are searching directory
trees (directories ending with // in a search path), then you may be
surprised at how many file-related system calls are being made.  In
particular, look at the ones that failed with ENOENT:

26514 access("./ls-R", R_OK)            = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

If there are a lot of them, then path searching can probably be
optimized by updating the ls-R caches and adjusting search paths.

maybe a smaller tree, smaller trees run much faster

concerning 64 bit: tests here demonstrate that 64 bit runs upto 30% faster than 
32 bit

if pdftex is used: pdftex's new map file handling mechanism speeds up font 
inclusion significantly esp when huge map files are used

Just to add one thing: when using pdftex, the new map file loading code
(using avl trees) also gives a significant speedup if large map files
are being loaded.

It makes sense to keep support for commercial fonts if it is complete
(besides the .pfb /pfa's) and up-to-date. I agree that it is better to
remove partial/outdated font support.

That reminds me: teTeX just has a wolfram.map and no metrics. That makes
no sense and is not useful. I will remove wolfram.map from teTeX.
