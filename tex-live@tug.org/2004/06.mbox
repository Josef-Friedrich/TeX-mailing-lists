i'll look into it as soon as there are binaries for windows/linux/darwin; 
the main problem with such changes is that users need to update binaries 
and tools in sync; my biggest problem currently is that i cannot make a new 
distribution when i have no binaries to test them on

(btw, for context users i'll provide a 
'fix-the-texmf-tree-to-the-latest-specs' utility)

Seems the path has become too long for the static text control.

There is a much more annoying bug for TL2003 by which in maintenance mode,
the tree of packages may be display only partly (or not at all). I have not
been able to find any clue about it. (As usual, it is difficult to debug
something that never happens on your machine). Anyway, if someone
experienced this bug and/or has an idea about it I'll be glod to hear him.

Next release will have an MSI installer and TeXSetup.exe will be defunct.

For my part, I'm still finding (and having people point out to me)
nits in the current web2c code (Staszek found a couple that would have
been showstoppers), which is why I'm doing the occasional checkin, and
haven't done the formal release yet.  Right now I'm arguing with
Fabrice about the code that allows spaces in "-quoted filenames (as
the windows corner is pushing that hardest).

That's the main part of what's kept me from going into a complete
source freeze on the web2c part.  It looks to me like the big changes
I put in have had some shakedown now, but I'd like to see more reports
from testing, for which (I assume) we need binaries to be built.

Is the lack of formal source freeze for web2c holding up testing or
other things?

no, whats holding it up at present is making the install and TPM

Hello,
  I'm afraid this was discussed ad nausea; please point me to a FAQ if
it exists somewhere.
  The TeXlive licence info says that its contents is available under
various licences, which are all Free (as defined by FSF or DFSG).
But according to my information the macros from plain.tex are not
"free software" (as defined by FSF), because if I reuse them, the
file may not be named "plain.tex".
  I understand that stating that TeXlive is free software is a nice
advertising clause, but it's not true.  I'm afraid TeXlive copyright
notice should say that the licences are free, but some packages
(as the core TeX) bear a requirement that any modified version has
to have different name.
  This arrangement would be much mor fair than the current one.

As you might know, this discussion was triggered by problems with
a macro package written by Petr Olsak.  Petr Olsak is definitely the
best TeXpert in Czech Republic, kind of "local Knuth".  ;-)
He decided to follow Knuth's example with the licensing model, and
I'd think it wouldn't be honest to let him contribute to TeXlive
under this model.  (Though I personally wouldn't choose such licence
for my works.)
  If TeXlive is built on TeX, I think it's bound to accept "Knuthian"
from everyone, not only from DEK himself.

I understand things would be much less complicated if the TeX licence
were different, but that's not the case.

Have a nice day,

I don't agree. I see no reason at all to copy Knuth's historical mistakes.
I agree that his stuff on TL is anomalous, but it is a known weirdness. 
Personally,
I think that cult of personality which pervades the TeX world is one of its
biggest problems.

OK, thanks for explanation.

The fact that OFS won't be included on TeXlive causes bad feelings against
free software community among Czech TeX users.

I have to understant that there are problems which don't have good solution
in this imperfect world.

Thank you for quick response to my mail.

perhaps one of the Czech TeX users would like to do some research
into the many TeX packages licensed with an accepted open source
license, and see whether there is a recorded case of "abuse"
which would be prevented by the Olsak license?

If everyone else involved in TeX Live says we should include OFS, I
am not a dictator. Others should say what they think.

packages that don't conform to the rules that sebastian has set for the 
main tree, can go into texmf-extra on the dvd, as was done with the 
utopia/fourier font collection; that way the package is distributed and 
users can copy texmf-extra over their main tree if they are satisfied with 
his rules for usage and so get rid of their bad feelings

(in that case, manfred is probably the one to handle that)

Give the man a break.  He is one of the founding fathers of Computer
Science.  He writes mathematical books that are a joy to read.  And
because he found that the second edition of the Art of Computer
Programming failed to be a joy to read, he wrote TeX.  And as one of
the earliest attempts at readable programming.

He is a pioneer in more than one area.  There is nothing wrong with
admiring him.  The main complaint I have about his dealing with TeX is
that he let himself be persuaded to write TeX-3.x, creating a 90%
there solution to 80% of its users that gives the illusion of being
something more than a tool for typesetting TAOCP.  If he hadn't done
that, perhaps the threshold of pain had carried through more serious
changes to TeX.  It might have caused community efforts to take up
serious development of the core as well as the packages on top of it.
Omega has more or less fallen victim to the "good enough for us"
mentality: it is frustrating to work on something for which people
tell you there is no pressing need.  

Han The Thanh is one of the few persons that managed to get one of
several single-person projects off the ground and actually used.  And
eTeX (which is pretty much dead seemingly as well) has managed to get
its extensions accepted as desirable long after nobody actively cared
for it anymore.

I don't see a problem with a Knuth cult: if people actually listened
to him, they'd get the message clear enough that TeX has been
abandoned by him as a project and that he considers it a curiosity
that people cling to it in the manner they do.

If he is going to fix the remaining bugs of TeX (instead of declaring
them "features"), it is going to take years.  Maybe they'll never get
fixed at all.  Where do I turn if I need new features to make it into
TeX?  The eTeX team?  Who is that?  Peter?  To Han The Thanh?
Guiseppe?  John?  Karel?  Michael?  The main "advances" nowadays
happen outside of TeX proper, as in kpathsea.  Which deals with the
problem of most conveniently collapsing an artfully structured
directory tree into a flat namespace.

No, a Knuth cult is not the problem.  What is hindering the TeX world
from progressing is a TeX cult, and a good-enough cult.  We need to
leave TeX behind.  And Knuth is doing his part in that: he has nailed
TeX down and has stated repeatedly, definitely, that it is not going
to move anymore.  It's just that nobody listens to him.

I am working with all of the junk.  Who do I ask for new stuff?  I
want John to get Omega into useful state.  It is a waste of resources
to have LaTeX, PDFTeX, eTeX and others all forked off from something
which does not even deal with character sets in a sane way.
Guiseppe's Aleph is at least an attempt to get something workable
again, but of course it misses PDFTeX functionality.

And, of course, all of the stuff is impossible to maintain.  Add a
feature and recompile?  Good luck.

Maybe one day TeXlive will come without TeX.

Omega is a  textbook example of a project which has done the wrong
thing is almost every conceivable way :-} One could write a book on open

    But according to my information the macros from plain.tex are not
    "free software" (as defined by FSF), 

That's incorrect.  The "Knuth license" where something must be renamed
before it can be modified, is free software according to the FSF.  (Not
GPL-compatible, but that's a different story.)  This is implicit because
rms has always said that the GNU system will (and does) include TeX.  He
also stated that the LPPL (even the first version) was free software.

Not that I'm saying he likes or recommends the "must rename" licenses;
he doesn't.  But he still considers them free.

    I understand that stating that TeXlive is free software is a nice
    advertising clause, but it's not true.  

Yes it is, to the best of our knowledge.  Please don't state opinions as
facts.

    If TeXlive is built on TeX, I think it's bound to accept "Knuthian"
    from everyone, not only from DEK himself.

What gets into TL is a judgment by Sebastian, there is no other
authority.  (Yes you are a dictator, Sebastian, although a pretty
benevolent one. :)

I agree with Sebastian that the "must rename" license is problematic in
practice and does not actually prevent any abuses.  However, it is still
free (and I didn't see anything from Sebastian stating the contrary).

For myself, I see no problem with including OFS in TL, except possibly
lack of space.

As Hans said, it will be included on the DVD (as part of CTAN and/or
texmf-extra) in any case.

I would have never expected you to make the mistake to stack 
LaTeX (a format) together with pdfTeX and eTeX (engines). This 
is one of the main problems of Omega latests (post 1.15), its 
being too format-centric.

If I could dedicate myself to Aleph full time, pdfTeX 
functionality would be there. I can't, because I'm working on 
my PhD. Sorry, you'll have to wait another couple of years.

This little discussion suggests to me that I was likely wearing
the wrong hat when I made that decision about OFS; normally I think
in "open source" world, but Karl is reminding me that TeX Live is
actually in "free software" world, and that I am applying the wrong 
criteria.

So shall we just put in OFS after all?

I apologize for my statements.  Thank you, Karl, for educating me.

Petr was a bit disappointed, wrote a message and there was a kind of
feeling here in Czech Republic that it's a shame that Olsak's work won't
be on CTAN and TeXlive.

I didn't want just to mourn that "they" discriminate Petr, so I tried to
do something about it.  As you observe, my way of "doing something" was
perhaps useful, but surely far from ideal.

Have a nice day,

Because TeX does not deal with character sets in a sane way, LaTeX
has to bumble around.  Of course it is a mistake to have LaTeX deal
with what the TeX engine should cater for itself.

But it is not my mistake.

    be on CTAN and TeXlive.

1) It is on CTAN.

2) We're discussing right now whether it will be on TL.  Why are you
jumping to the conclusion that it won't be?

Anyway, no problem.  Thanks for bringing it up.

BTW, I'm very interested in the software itself; Petr already pointed me
to some possibilities for publication in TUGboat ...

Are you talking about the (stupid, IMHO) official open source "mark"?
It's true that TeX doesn't have that, of course.

My belief is that "open source" and "free software" emphasize two very
different things, but are very close to accepting the same set of
licenses.  Open source is, I guess, a mild superset:
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html

Anyway, all that's an aside.

    So shall we just put in OFS after all?

I say yes.

    PS if I was a dictator, I'd like to throw out all the LaTeX packages 
    called "somethingX" or "newX", 

That wouldn't be benevolent :).

(I know what you mean -- but hey, that's the price we pay for having a
"community" that is really thousands of individuals just trying to get
their jobs done ...)

of course I understand the joke but perhaps it's not wise to say such
things anyway.

The tendencies to be "holier than Stallman" cause bad perception of free
software community and confuse people.  Only a few hours ago I thought
that Knuth's licence is not free.

Karl had to explain it to me:

During the hot discussion  in cstex list I mentioned in my earlier mails,
someone said that he is afraid that free sw community will come with a
TNT (TNT's not TeX) as an echt-free replacement for TeX.

That's why I think these times are not good for such jokes...

Have a nice day,

Get off it.  "Wise", my foot.  Is there a Stiff Fine (TM) for saying
such things?

We are already obsoleting the genuine TeX engine (LaTeX recommends
eTeX as a base, ConTeXt similarly), and the licence is the least
important of all reasons for that.

while I meant

(It's a typical example of Czenglish.)

I meant that we were under impression that OFS would be omitted.

Sorry, for the confusion.  I'm happy that it's resolved so nicely.

stupid it may be, but it is the sort of thing that gets 
written into contracts. indeed, I am writing a document 
myself recommending that as a strategy. if it aint on the 
OSI list, it aint "open source" in this government world.

be glad. government is doing open source. but they need 
formal bodies to approve things.

I've studied TeX for years, but this "state of things"
account has really helped solidify what I've been
feeling intuitively.  The fractured (forked)
attention seems exhausting even to me, a mere user.  
Thank you, David, for your review.

It's a shame I won't be at this year's TeX conference
in Greece (other commitments).  But, the discussion
on "TeX's future in the digital age" would be *very*
interesting to me.

IMHO, yes, there *is* a future for high quality
typesetting as TeX provides.  The rapid surge in HTML
popularity doesn't mean HTML displaces typesetting
(fads and technology come and go... all the HTML
authored intranets of the 1990's are dying now).
But, it does seem that the TeX community has got to
be a little clearer regarding direction, or at least
agreement of enumerated merits/costs associated with
different projects with different directions.

I still have questions about other parts of the 
landscape:  What about some of the 'commercial'
distributions?  What about alternative typesetting
technologies?  It seems that any "big-eyed discussion"
ought to also account for the full appraisal of
the market, including the current costs/benefits
of what works *now* and what we *might want*.

I'm aware of many of the issues (character
representation, Unicode and internationalization,
colors, images, etc.)  However, I'm not sufficiently
versed in typesetting academics to fully evaluate
many of the feature issues.  But, I'm a strong
programmer and would be interested in understanding
more about what we *have* and what we *might want*.

At present, I feel utterly unqualified to comment
because after reading *every* *single* *post* to 
this list for the past year (and most of the
other lists on CTAN), so much of the TeX install
and configuration issues are still a mystery to
me, as well as an understanding of what packages
might be considered "standard", as well as when 
to leverage one engine over another.  The only thing
I've learned as a user and reader of this list is
that I'd be *crazy* to walk away from one of the
big TeX distros that's already tried to solve these
problems for me.

I appreciate the very hard work by many on this
list, and I recognize many of the "big name"
contributors.  I don't have a good handle on where
this type of strategic discussion takes place,
though.  Is there a list to talk about these
'possible strategic directions' or archives that I
could peruse?

are being replaced by? services that deliver stuff to you
using (X)HTML, perhaps?  I would argue very strongly that
the web _has_ done away with, probably for ever, a large
proportion of the uses for TeX in its first 20 years.

the publishing world is getting behind XSL FO slowly.
its not TeX, but several of the implementations use
some of the TeX algorithms (paragraph makeup, hyphenation).

TeX lists tends to start with the assumption that "we've got 
TeX, we've got some problems, let's fix TeX". Other lists
might be more like "we've got problems, what software is out 
there to solve them". See, its hard to find a really 
objective forum.

This week I spent some time investigating the possibility of having
spaces in filenames.  The simple case is done, in that

	\input "foo bar"

works about as well as you'd expect.  The hard part is making sure
that (for example) LaTeX's

	\input{foo bar}

would also work.  It turns out to be surprisingly hard to get this
right even in most cases, and then you need to tack on another bunch
on heuristics so that things like

	cmr10 at 5pt

aren't interpreted as a single filename.  I decided that it wasn't
worth the trouble and risk of introducing obscure bugs, so

	\input{"foo bar"}

is what you'll have to use in LaTeX.  My conclusion is that if you
really want spaces in filenames in a natural manner, the current TeX
internals are the wrong place to start from.

I really admire Han The Thanh for doing pdfTeX with TeX as the
starting point.

And I personally believe that this can be generalized: the algorithms
TeX uses for typesetting are still very good and useful.  However, it
would be a mistake, IMAO, for a successor to TeX to be based on TeX's
internals.  I'd like any such hypothetical system to be fairly
modular: a central typesetting core, with different front-ends for
various input languages (TeX's macro language, XML, ...) and different
back-ends for various output languages (PDF, PS, DVI, XML, ...).  This
is why the actual NTS project was a bit of a disappointment to me.

There have been changes in tex.ch that should probably be merged into

They are in the area addressed by comw32.ch -- much of what was in

Yes, it's largely that.  But, that's an artifact
of 'publishing' in the sense of 'interachange'.
Much of the world has moved to dynamic generation of
content on-the-fly.  The 'storage' format varies, and
the mechanism for the 'content of record' varies.
The (X)HTML only kicks in because it's reasonably
fast to generate and trade, and it's a reasonably
agreed upon format with widely available (dynamic)
rendering engines built for speed and feature, and
not quality of the output.  TeX (and high quality
typesetting in general) will never compete with that,
but it wasn't meant to.

In contrast, I see typesetting as still relevant
for high quality offline rendering (speed is always
nice, but we render offline and merely distribute the
fully typeset result).  The continuing prevolence of
PDF and printed documentation seem to justify that
paradigm as well.

I suppose it's possible that (X)HTML could be
'extended' in some 'well known way' to provide
additional typesetting instruction, but it wasn't
meant for that and I don't see any interest nor
discussion in the (X)HTML camps in ever going there.
They generally don't deal with concepts like Tables
of Contents, nested section numbering, indices, nor
even footnotes.

I suppose that's true, especially in light of
dynamic media, video, hyperlinks, and
internationalization (not things TeX is known for).
But, just as PDF is a good rendered specification,
it seems like there should be a good 'to-be-typeset'
specification also.  I'm not real impressed with FO,
but maybe that's the direction.  We still need a
rendering engine.

Ok.  I find the commercial XSL FO tools are ok,
but the open source ones are pretty broken.  The
quality of the output isn't nearly as good as 
through today's TeX, IMHO.  I'm reluctant to give
up that quality of output.

<sigh>.  I guess I could be a forum of just me, 
but I don't yet have ideas of what to push yet.
And, I probably wouldn't agree with them anyway.  ;-)

Thanks for the thoughts.  I'll think on this some
more.

agreed. but 10-15 years ago quite a few people were using (La)TeX
for the purposes we now rightly use HTML for

The key word there is "prevalence". I'd argue with it. I'd say that  yes 
there is much PDF around,
but its getting less as the web improves. I, like many another person, 
deliver PDF versions of my web pages
as PDF dynamically (using TeX, in fact), but its very much a niche thing 
which doesnt get used much.

and we have quite a few engines which implement XSL FO. three good 
commerical ones, three bad
open source ones, at least

    because after reading *every* *single* *post* to this list for the

    install and configuration issues are still a mystery to me, 

What kind of install/configuration issues are a mystery?
Do you have any specifics in mind?  Is the TL installation documentation
not helpful?  I substantially rewrote it last year, ideas for
improvement are welcome.

Technically, it is not really that complex, in the end, at least if you
restrict your attention to one implementation, say web2c/kpathsea/unix.
There are zillions of files and zillions of details, but it comes down
to search paths (texmf.cnf) and finding files along those paths.  But
you've probably gathered that much already, and it's the zillions of
details that are the problem ...

    as well as an understanding of what packages might be considered
    "standard",

Ah, well, you see, there is no standard.  It's kind of like having a
reference implementation for a language: if a package is included in TeX
Live, well then, you could say it's standard in TeX Live.  Self-defining
and not very useful.  There is no overarching list of "standard" LaTeX
packages which all implementations try to adhere to.  We put new random
packages in TL when people ask for them, basically.

    'possible strategic directions' or archives that I
    could peruse?

This list is as good as any; you might find the TDS list/archives
interesting, or you might not.  There is no single list devoted to
"TeX strategy".  There is no TeX strategy.  There is no single TeX
community, or project, or anything else.  Both a strength and a weakness.

    more about what we *have* and what we *might want*.

I think handling Unicode is the biggest thing we might want.
Current Omega does not suffice.

The latest thing I read on that was Plaice/Haralambous/et al.'s
contribution to TUG 2003, which outlines an incredibly general
strategy to doing this, kind of like what Olaf was talking about.
There's a preprint somewhere on http://tug.org/tug2003.

However, you'll find that doesn't get you any closer to some project you
can contribute to on the ground, it's the view from 10,000 feet.  Aleph
(aka e-omega) is, from all I've seen, by far the most realistic/workable
project in this area.  The principal maintainer (Giuseppe Bilotta) is on
this list; maybe you could contribute there.


Best,
karl

No, most of them simply smell very funny because they have fallen
way behind.

BSR, Y&Y, PCTeX and TrueTeX to me seem to be in different stages
of becoming obsolete as TeX installations (e.g. no adoption to
new OSs and/or no direkt PDF). None of these IMHO can compete
with MikTeX or TeXshop. But they have nice fonts. :-)

But there is BaKoMa, which seems to be all-singing, all-dancing.
And MicroPress with VTeX, which has an integrated PS-RIP and does
PDF. And Scientific Word/Workplace, which ships with web2c.

Subject: [tex-live] tpm regeneration
Message-ID: <200406042346.i54Nkup30798@f7.net>

Ah, I realized that most of the problems were due to the lists/* files
not being regenerated after the tpm update.  So I did that (Sebastian, I
made some changes to Tools/update and *2list.xsl to avoid hardwiring
/texlive as the working directly, although nothing that will interfere
with your habits, I think).

Now the only errors are the ones from tar and sed below.  I'll look at
them over the next few days, I hope, unless someone else gets there
first (I can always hope :).

I hope to start regenerating the tpms and lists/ files from cron this
weekend, but we'll see.

Yes, I guess that's consistent with many open

maintenance level).

Perfect!  That was *exactly* what I needed.  I know
I didn't do a good job asking for it, but I was
after the 'design theory of operation' for these
assorted projects.  That paper gave it to me for
revised direction on Omega.  THANKS.

I guess I'm still missing that kind of thing with
projects like xmlroff.  Simply going to SourceForge
to see '7 bugs, one unassignned' and '12 feature
requests' didn't give me enough understanding of
what's going on.  Reading about Sun open sourcing
the project in 2002 with Tony working on it 
regularly didn't help me understand how it's supposed
to really work (simply saying it's an implementation
of the W3C pattern for XML->XSL->FO->PDF wasn't
enough).  At the lowest level, it somehow has to
mention concepts for 'glue', char and glyph 
translation, theory for object translation to 
real estate, etc.  Being implemented in Java, I'm 
assuming the higher-level document structure and
basic Unicode support trumps by far any concerns for
lower-level typesetting based on context (but that's
just a guess).

I'm actually quite interested and excited about what
[Plaice, Swoboda, Haralambous, Rowley, et al.] were
talking about in the paper you mention.  Now THAT'S
something I can understand:  Not a mere brute-force
push, but a reasoned theory of operation that may
yield significant features.

That's what attracted me to TeX:  Its academic
completeness made it an elegant solution to the 
problem it tried to solve.  It just never tried
to solve for localization (and so many other
things relevant today).  Fundamentally, we're
talking about some honestly hard problems, and I've
found that incremental discovery requires a
tremendously disciplined and clean approach or
you hit the wall far too soon.  The world is full
of software projects that just can't go any
further.

IMHO, computer science remains the only field I know
where, "ideas are cheap, and implementation is
[profoundly] expensive".  ;-)

Rather than continue rambling, I'll keep looking
for information on projects in general, and study
Omega in particular.  THANKS!  You gave me what I
needed.

It would be better if the CTAN structure or the TeX Live structure 
would enable an implementation of the sort of installation mechanism 
that MiKTeX has. That is, keep date stamps of packages (so you can see 
what has been updated when) and have them available for 'direct' 
install without going through the source-to-final hoops.

LaTeX and ConTeXt walk around the problems with different 
methods. Not that I see why TeX should care at all about 
character sets.

Because it writes messages to the terminal and to temporary files that
need to get reread.  Because it outputs the contents of boxes, like
with overfull box messages and when using \showbox, and it would be
nice if the output was at all readable.  Because decoding stuff like
input characters is inefficient, error-prone, and fragile.  Because it
makes it impossible to have working non-English error messages,
terminal output, control sequence names, labels and so on.

Need I continue?  Surprising that I should have to explain this to
the author of Aleph.

ANT?

Anyway, please let them. I'm really to curious what they will

    Can you send me a diff? I'm not comfortable enough with 
    perforce yet to know how to track changes.

p4 filelog <somefile> will show you the list of checkins and log msgs.

In this case, since Olaf said to look at the changes in revision 21 and
later:
tug$ p4 diff tex.ch#21

The output is below.

FWIW, you can also browse the sources at
http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source.development/TeX/texk/web2c/

Don't spend a lot of time mastering p4.  We will still plan to move to
CVS after this year's release.

HTH,

I just noticed that Master/texmf/tpm/hyphen-russian.tpm is incorrect:
somehow it says that texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/ruhyph.tex is part of
that collection, but in fact there is no such file - russian
hyphenation pattern files are located at
texmf-dist/tex/generic/ruhyphen directory (and there are several files
there).

hyphen-ukrainian.tpm is similarly broken. I wonder how it is
constructed?

Hmm, strange that there was no error somewhere along the way.  I'll look

    I wonder how it is constructed?

Here's what I ran:

       --clean \
       --arch=all \

I hope to check in a front-end script to make this more convenient soon.

In fact, the file appears in the RunPatterns section, but not in the

I'm still waiting for a good way to handle hyphenation files.

Would it be a good time to introduce a versioning and 
ready-downloadable (if not already present) approach for the Master 
tree? Or better, get CTAN somehow to have such a setup that it can be 
used as the MiKTeX repository is used, for automatic updating over the

Surprising where? I have not "authored" anything. I just 
grabbed two handfuls of .ch files to a .web file and made sure 
they clicked together. I didn't even need to have a full 
understanding of what each single line of code did, to do that.

MiKTeX (http://miktex.sourceforge.net) keeps a set of .cab files (some 
sort of archive format for windows) which are submitted by a community. 
These archive files are on every CTAN mirror, btw. There is probably 
also an index somewhere. A MiKTeX installation knows which versions of 
those archives it has installed and can thus detect if there is a newer 
version of a (La)TeX package available. It can even install a missing 
package when this is detected during a TeX run. It does not rely on 
source distribution for (La)TeX packages as there is no generic way of 
installing these. Not all have a "install.ins" file for instance and 
some even require some technical intervention. Hence, MiKTeX lets its 
developer community do the install, create an archive for that and 
distribute *that*.

So, what is needed is a set of archives (not unpacked as implementing 
downloading will be a problem) that can be installed in a texmf tree 
and that have versioning.

you have the information needed for that in TL already. for package X, 
read the corrresponding TPM file, which has
the dates in. Compare with your local copy of the TPM file. If needed, 
fetch the files.

you say "not unpacked as implementing downloading will be a problem"; if 
thats an issue, write a service on a TL mirror
which packages up files in a zip or cab format on demand.

Yes, I know this needs several utility packages to be written, and I am 
not volunteering, but it strikes me
as fairly straightforward to implement.

Sebastian is correct.  The cult of the personality has been a very
important factor in limiting Omega development and deployment.
When I went to the 1993 TUG meeting in Birmingham, UK, the response
from many was of the sort "How dare you modify TeX?"

The cult ensured that the NTS project was stillborn, by insisting
that 100% TeX compatibility be maintained, right down to the structure
of error messages!

A personality cult is a complex phenomenom.  Often the cult prevents
the followers or the disciples from listening to what the subject
of the cult is actually saying.  The fact that Knuth has repeatedly
said that he is not going to improve or transform TeX is interpreted
by the cultists as "No-one should improve or transform TeX".

Progress takes place when nothing is considered to be sacrosanct.
I see a complete TeX rewrite, that goes well beyond TeX, and without
the cult of 100% TeX compatibility, taking place within 3 years,
at the very most.

Regards,

John Plaice

Sometimes it takes years to really figure out what is wrong...
With software, once a clear design comes up, the implementation
moves quickly assuming you have skilled programmers around you.
I believe that with Omega we have reached that point...

All of TeXLive will be available via CVS after this years release is 
finished. The absolute priority for TL now is to get
it stable again, so that people can test a release; all else (like the 
switch to CVS)) must take a back seat.

Thanks Olaf, thanks Karl. It seems to me I don't have much to 
with the Aleph and Omega base ... the changes are of three 
groups:

* (minor) TEX_(POOL|ENGINE)_NAME changed to TEXMF_\1_NAME

This is already implemented in Aleph, it seems.

* ML-TeX and enc-TeX related stuff, plus dumping and undumping 
of TCX files

I don't really think these have any meaning for Omega and 
Aleph, since I doubt those TeX extension are compatible with it

* spaces in filename

I just noticed that most of the code added to tex.ch is already 
present in the "w32" changefiles for Omega, which if I'm not 
mistaked is the set of fpTeX-specific changes. Looks like I'll 
just have to move it to all platforms.

Hmm. Let's see if I understand this. We have CTAN, TeX Live's Master 
tree is taken from CTAN (right?) and the TPM's are maintained by the 
TeX Live crew. MiKTeX's repository is taken from TeX Live. MiKTeX's 
repository then is reinserted in another branch of CTAN (win32).

teTeX's texmf tree is (Thomas informs me) taken from CTAN (largely) 
with a bit of hand work thrown in.

Is this in fact how it is?

CTAN, and maybe other places too if needed. TL's job is to take a raw 
package and coerce it into
a consistent TDS layout

Which implies that MiKTeX's basic repository is two steps away from 
CTAN (TL being the first step). Anyway, this sounds like a far from 
ideal situation.

Shouldn't we go for one TDS-compliant repository (read: CTAN which is 
mirrored everywhere) and have the TPM files included in CTAN? That way 
we could remove one repository alltogether and TL could draw directly 
from CTAN without having to maintain its own Master tree (except as a 
copy for building the images).

CTAN is welcome to maintain a daily snapshot of the TL package tree; the 
thing has to be maintained _somewhere_, after all, in a version control 
system. thats all TL is, really

I am not suggesting theat Christian should use CTAN as is now.

It makes sense to have the archive in one place. I agree that 
versioning is important. However, as it is now, *CTAN* is the main 
source for packages, without versioning afaik, TL is built from there 
and then makes it TDS conformant and versions it (maintenance by hand).

It could be a lot simpler if we had one repository with versioning and 
'quality control' (read TDS conformance). Or in other words, CTAN is 
only usable for geeks (read the install docs, run scripts, makefiles, 
etc) but a true repository could be used automatically by software 
without simple users being confronted with technical stuff. A bit like 
the MiKTeX cache in CTAN is.

Not really, because you also edit stuff and make it TDS conformant and 
you add the TPM's. And besides, it is like I maintain an archive of 
software but only in the "current state", then you draw a copy, edit it 
and add versioning. You suggest then that I should then again mirror 
your result. My idea woul dbe to consolidate that all in one 
repository. It would mean only one place to maintain, not two.

The situation is now the opposite of logical and it results in 
maintenance in more than one place. That is a waste of energy.

Surely we already have what you want? we have the geeks resource in 
CTAN, and the quality-controlled, TDS-ized subset in TeX Live.
All that is missing is replication of TL as a public resource, and a web 
service front end for TL.

I agree. TL only covers a subset of what is on CTAN; doing the rump 
properly would be very hard work

This point is wrong. MikTeX's packages are updated independendly from
TL. One example is memoir. TL's master tree does not yet have the current
version (last updated on CTAN: 2004/05/25).

MikTeX's package (systems/win32/miktex/tm/packages/memoir.cab from
2004/06/01) has the current version (I just have looked at the cab file
with cabextract).

So, in fact, we have people working on "Total MikTeX", "TeX Live" and
teTeX, all taking files from CTAN and putting the result back to CTAN.
Total MikTeX and TeX Live are TPM based, teTeX is not (yet).

Using a single source of packages for all distributions would mean
  - to agree on a common namespace
  - to agree on a common format for the packages (zip / cab / whatever)
  - to agree on line ends (if the package forma  does not support
    conversion on extraction)
  - and much much more...

I have just spent many hours updating TeX Live from CTAN, and I am now 
moderately
up to date. If people on this list would like to start checking up, I'd 
be very glad.

The following packages are not updated, because I don't feel strong enough
to look at them and understand what they are etc. are they exciting?

 acrotex arabtex bardiag barr bibweb cheq chroma cm-lgc cmastro
 easylatex euroitc eurosans grkfinst latexmk makecirc metatex
 mimetex ntgclass ofntinst png2pdf psgreek psnfss-source slantsc

is ArabTeX free of license problems now?

we had a suggestion from christian, while we were in darmstadt, that we
consider a programmable front end for ctan.  i see no difficulty in
principle in creating a soap service that would sit (at least) on the
main ctan sites.

if we can see our way to getting the texlive tree available for
mirroring, i see no difficulty (now that i've a user-group supplied
machine at last) in making room for that tree on ctan sites.  (dunno
about mirroring).

so the question is, do we need to maintain the "geek" archive?

well, yes, i would say.  tex live is never going to offer all the odds
and ends that ctan has; we don't all have the sort of energy sebastian
(must have) had when he started tex live ... for me, starting on
"quality assurance" of everything left behind by tex live is
unthinkable.

i think the issue here is how to deal with the ctan holdings of things
that _are_ in the tex live repository.  i can think of arguments in
almost all directions about this...

i'm not qualified to speak here: i don't have a clear idea of how people
use the tl repository?  do christian and his merry men(man?) use tl, or
do they work elsewhere?  the results appear on different timetables for
miktex and fptex, for sure.

ntgclass is a regular latex package with ins file; nothing special. It

As usual: when running a diff between our texmf trees, I also find a

I can run the ins file, but I can't process the documentation.
I have written an email to JLBraams@cistron.nl about 4 weeks ago.
No response.

I agree that the package is broken.

    if we can see our way to getting the texlive tree available for
    mirroring

Although I haven't announced it before now, I guess it is worth
mentioning at this point: you can get TL via rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc.
This is the raw master current sources tree, synced to the p4 repository
every few minutes.  (It's /home/tlprod locally on tug.org, for those who
might be interested.)

There's also rsync://tug.org/texlive2003-Contents and -Images for the
last release, among a couple other things.  rsync tug.org:: will get the list.

Thanks to Kaja for getting the firewall opened.

(Hans, I hope this will suit your needs.)

cyrillic is a mandatory part of latex. The cyrillic package on CTAN does not
work with the lh fonts on CTAN... :-(

I don't recall what I did 4 weeks ago. I think that I have traced it
all down to a simple document that did run with the old version of the
generated class file, but not with the new one. Maybe an incompatibility
with current latex.

of course, with the various clients falling at the wayside, i've got

ooh, how things have progressed since i started cooking.

i agree with sebastian's last point -- plainly silly to change in the
middle of a cycle.  but let's think in terms of reviewing the field
before we put everything up.  fwiw, some of our research groups seem to
fancy svn for new projects, though i don't think any of the existing cvs
repositories have switched.

Yes. I can redistribute for CTAN not-gziped version, if it would be
more convinient. The question: should we have afm.gz files for TL

I understood that you would keep it on sun.dante.de. After all, we have
this NAS box sitting there, with an empty filesystem.

My outsider impression of the Omega project is that it is not as much
in need of skilled programmers as of a nanny.

Clicking on the "CVS" link on the Omega home page gives you a
non-HTML-recognized page.  Following the instructions for anonymous
CVS access gives:

bash-2.05b$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@omega.cse.unsw.edu.au:/home/cvs/root login 
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@omega.cse.unsw.edu.au:2401/home/cvs/root
CVS password: 
Fatal error, aborting.
anonymous: no such user
bash-2.05b$ 

That's not likely to get too many people interested.  One year ago, I
had managed to get hold of a volunteer for writing up user-level
instructions for Omega use which I considered sorely lacking (the most
simple example of writing a trivial Omega/Lambda document in some
encoding is just not there.  Instructions for switching encodings and
what they are are not there.  Instead some very basic instructions for
_writing_ OTPs and stuff.  That's not interesting to a user).  Well I
asked around several people and on the Omega list.  I finally had to
give up.  Nobody was interesting in even slightly coaching a volunteer
to write up sorely needed documentation.

The last mailing list entry from the Omega mailing list is from last
July.  The last entry from the Omega developers mailing list is from
last April.

John, for all practical purposes of normal users Omega is dead.
Whether or not there may be code backing up the design representations
on TeX conferences is irrelevant for the user as long as he has no
chance to ever see or use it.

If you take a project like the Hurd, it has a working web site at
<URL:http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd>.  It has cross references,
articles and stuff.  It has documentation.  It has a publicly
accessible CVS archive that actually works.  It has task files, TODO
lists, mailing lists.  Why, even in the June 2004 archive there are
already messages that are actually on-topic and not SPAM.

If you want to get anywhere in a free software project without a
particular large-scale sponsor with specific needs, things like that
are pretty much mandatory to keep the ball rolling.  The FSF learned
its lesson a bit late.

In contrast, we still have a gaping hole in the TeX world, for a
robust maintainable extendible code base.  I just doubt that Omega2
will ever make it there.  Not because it would not be needed or
technically inferior or whatever, but simply because it stays
completely out of any involvement with actual users and outside
developers.  It won't get friends if it doesn't play with the other
kids, staying indoors and planning the greatest presents to hand out
eventually.  It needs to get out in the streets.

Omega2 is not there, and the Omega developers refuse to even help
people writing generally usable documentation for Omega1's encoding
stuff because it will be obsolete anytime soon.  Or so we hear.

I am afraid that Omega has done its fair share of holding up TeX
development by now, probably surpassing the damage of the "Knuth
cult".  A lot of work has not been tackled since "it will become
obsolete with Omega".

Maybe we will see some usable code base in a tolerably manageable
language for extending TeX into the twenty-first century in the next
three years, like you claim.  But I'd not bet big money on it being
Omega, sadly.

Nicely expressed, David! In one my incarnations, I run an open source 
advisory service
for UK higher and further education, and we have a standard presentation 
we give to
developers who want to "be the next 
Apache/Mozilla/OpenOffice/Gimp/whatever".  We say just
the same things as David:

It's hard to think of any successful open source projects still 
operating in the extreme "cathedral" mode.
TeX world seems entirely out of sync with the world in this respect.

Intertesting that David mentions the Hurd; one might have cited that as 
a project which failed
for the same reasons David is castigating Omega. I am glad to hear it is 
not after all dead :-}

Well, it has been buried, and its property has been split among the
heirs and their pet penguins.  So it would have a hard time getting
into any respected position nowadays: Zombies without property have a
hard stand in today's world.  Even though the Hurd still wears tidy
clothes on its web site, CVS, mailing lists.

In contrast, the property of Omega has not been claimed as to now.
While the TeX/Unicode world is in flirtation with several candidates,
there is no serious commitment yet.  So there is still a way open into
respectable society.

Something like that.  I am not known for sane analogies.

Sorry for that.

For running LaTeX3 on Omega2, Hurd1 would seem just perfect.

If you create a programmable front end does that mean you need to run

Message-ID: <40C39C27.6080307@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

as my last checkin of the day (change number 5000),
I have put a tar.bz2 of the current source.development into the
master tree, in order to test making CD images.

all being well, the Master texmf* trees are now stable and up to date 
with CTAN.

we now need four things to happen:

 a) source freeze by Olaf., Martin and Thanh, followed by new 
compilation all around
 b) new Windows install for live system from Fabrice
 c) Karl/Sebastian to work out how to make .cab files for the compressed 
CD [1], Fabrice
     to provide installer based on those, Karl/Sebastian to finish Linux 
installer
 d) lots of TESTING

I am making a "live" image now, which will be in place in 10-15 minutes,
and would very much welcome comments on the texmf trees, and on the 
placement
of packages in collections.

If it seems like I was busy this weekend, it is true. With my family 
away I have spent 2 days
solidly on TeX Live. The bad news is that I now have to revert to normal 
mode of half an hour
here and there each week. So don't expect much response from me :-}

(replacing the use of zip,  to let the horrid Microsoft software have 
its way. sadly, making
compressed cabs under Linux is far from easy, if even possible)

ideally, only the main CTAN nodes would run the software, handle all 
requests, and pass
the heavy lifting onto a local mirror transparently. so the mirrors 
would not need to be intelligent.

I'm not holding my breath waiting for someone to implement this :-}

I'm accessing as root? I think I'm accessing as 'oblomov' ...

I access it using the following script:

# envvars for .profile:
P4PORT=sun.dante.de:1666; export P4PORT
P4USER=oblomov; export P4USER
P4PASSWD=(a real password here); export P4PASSWD
P4CLIENT=oblomov; export P4CLIENT

aiui, yes.  just like anything that offers an http service has to run an
http server.

however, without any discussion of what this service is going to do for
us, it's not clear to me what machines it would be _sensible_ to run the
service on.

it's just worth letting your imagination loose on functionality you may
be interested in.  i interpreted christian's request as "let's have a
cleaner protocol to implement than ftp", and i guess we can manage that.
beyond that, i've not really thought (i've been rather distracted with
implementing a new server, and "real" work).

The impression I got from John's talk at BachoTeX was that O2 is
to be released at TUG2004 and then the O2-team will move on
developing something much better which is not hampered by
compatiblity to TeX. And O2 will be left as a monument.

    I am making a "live" image now, which will be in place in 10-15 minutes,

"in place" currently means:

Bzipped version coming soon, along with nightly builds, I hope.

So the winner in p4 #5000 is Sebastian! 
Congratulations and many thanks!
Just uploaded some changed binaries for i386-linux #5003, and deleted
texmf/web2c/pdftex.pool (#5004). Please exclude it in tpm files.

Still interesting that I have pdfetex rc4 for win32 from Fabrice,
but compiled for linux is rc3-2.1

well, installing it on a live tex system is just a matter of running
inst-lh.sh script which shouldn't be hard to do. :)

sut i agree that it should be put on CTAN which i hope will be done
soon (there's a newer version which will be put on CTAN).

sorry for inconvenience...

Under unix. And even if you speak about "installing at TL production time"
that would be best if all packages installed the same way.

what is innovation  ...  maybe 20 years from now rendering docs will be 
obsolete anyway

with respect to 'fallen behind', as long as they serve an audience the 
people working on it can make a living; the is not that much difference 
from a couple of families living of a commercial (maybe old fashioned)  
distribution on the one hand, and 10 families living from using the 
'modern' pdftex as hidden engine  in a page imposition program; once an 
author starts writing the only thing that mattersis that his tex 
environment works: most time is spent on writing; actually the same is 
true for goin gfrom input to output (say tex/xml -> pdf): most time goes 
into solving problems and of course a language/system may help, but in 
my daily live, dealing with  funny input (in spite of being validated) 
and  inconsistent designs (in spite of all those dtp programs) takes 
most of the time -)

also, i'm always puzzled by the 'one and only best sulution' approach; 
why  one tex instead of many tex's, why one  kind of fo-xml instead of  
many  xml-mapping languages; solving everything in one solution is bound 
to fail some time (watch all those big applications getting more and 
more complex); why the monopolies etc; kind of interesting that in a 
'free world' there is always that tendency to 'the one and only 
application'  (kind of applying communism in a capatalist environment)

I haven't seen anyone saying anything about latexmk ...

In short latexmk is a perl script for ensuring full update of latex files.
That is making sure all crossreferences and citations and indexes are upto
date, that is running latex the apropriate number of times needed.

Basically http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/ says it all

I find it very usefull and have taught several people to use it with great
succes. Particularly the continuously preview is nice to have when
correcting spelling errors.

Though it needs a perl installation.

Well, one attraction of free software is that it is legally possible
to join several branches of extensions when the need arises.  And it
is an attraction because it leads to a unification of efforts: more
often than not, there is a scarcity of developers and developer
time.  If the work of a developer benefits all users and not just the
users from a particular vendor, this is more efficient.

Ehm ... now it seems I can't even *read* the repository :) I 
don't know if the problem is on my side, but if I try to sync 
my local copy I get lots of

one for each file that should be updated (on my copy). I 
haven't touched the files since the last sync, so I really 
don't know what could be wrong ...

you have done something to amke the file writeable locally. 
do a chmod -R u-w on all of them if you have not changed them

Many organizations are still strongly biased against software they can't 
pay for.  Linux distributors have been providing out-dated, partly broken 
TeX configurations and many people feel they have to live with that.

TeX is one of those technologies that is sufficiently advanced to as to 
appear like magic to many users, the ones who use the same document 
template year after year (and complain on c.t.t about problems with 
epsf.sty).  As long as users expect they will need wizardly incantations 
to make a new TeX system work, they will be reluctant to change.

If they can't make a decision about which solution to use on some rational 
criterion, most people will try to determine what is most popular, maybe 
thinking that if others can get it working it should work for them as 
well.  Many people are so accustomed to hearing horror stories about
software incompatibility that they just assume it will be impossible to
format a .tex file that works with XXTeX under ZZTeX, so give up
after the first error.

It is hard for free-software to overcome the mindset that has been 
fostered by commercial software vendors with big advertising budgets. 
The latter group needs people to live in fear of change.  And since the 
successful companies in each category have bigger advertising budgets, 
they promote the idea that software is magical and that you will suffer 
dreaded "incompatibilty" conflicts if you make the wrong choice.

People be more willing to "take chances" with TeX it was easier to
switch between distros and better tools to debug texmf trees.

1. more attention to the tools that allow multiple TeX distro's to
    coexist.  On unix the environment-modules tools provide a simple
    mechanism to adjust environments and paths in an organized way.
    This lets you do:

$ module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
           1) modules       2) SGI_fw        3) TeX/TL2003
$ pdflatex sample2e
This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.11b-2.1 (Web2C 7.5.2)
[...]
$ mkdir TL2003
$ mv *.log *.pdf *.aux TL2003
$ module switch TeX/TL2003 TeX/teTeX3
Switching 'TeX/TL2003' to 'TeX/teTeX3'...ok.
$ pdflatex sample2e
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.20a-rc3-2.1 (Web2C 7.5.3)
[...]
$ diff sample2e.log TL2003/sample2e.log

    Is there a similar tool for Win32?

2. a gui search tool for texmf trees that would let you choose the
    filetype, progname, etc. from lists.

3. tools to maintain/debug texmf trees.  A lot of the magic would go
    away if users had better information about the status of their
    texmf trees.

    There should be a sort of checkpointing for the texmf trees to allow
    installing new versions and backing out if problems occur.  Keeping
    texmf-dist as a read-only tree will help, but it would be useful to
    have tools to

    a.  list changes from the installation
    b.  list duplicate filenames
    c.  checkpoint a tree
    d.  restore a tree to a previous checkpoint
    e.  compare two trees

hm, i need to look into that; probably under 2000/xp local environments 
are possible;

currently i use a simple bat/sh file, something

setuptex /someplace/sometree

and that works ok for unix as well as windows

indeed, maybe something for the new kpse library

I'd be content to witness a Zombie crawling from a graveyard.  John,
with all due respect, you misestimate the problems of Omega.  If you
want to get a clue about what problems Omega2 is up to, you need to
look no further than Omega1.

When Omega1 came out, it tackled several problems for typesetting
that had been ailing TeX.  Why didn't it take on?

a) LaTeX support.  LaTeX offers its own ways of dealing with input
encodings.  One would need to come up with some conventions or
packages for dealing with LaTeX-related input.  This entails talking
with developers and having programmer-accessible documentation.

I am not the most stupid person on Earth, and I tried for some days
at that time to get a hang of OTP, sufficient for getting a clue how
one would integrate them with LaTeX, and failed.

b) output driver support.  One needed special programs oxdvi, odvips
and so on to deal with Omega.  The respective changes should have
been submitted to and folded back into the main drivers.  From time
to time, compliance with Omega should have been rechecked.

c) user support.  Users need instructions and example files to get
systems working.  My attempts to find such instructions, or even get
volunteers accepted for _creating_ such stuff were futile.

d) accountability.  Whenever somebody would have dared saying
something like "I want to base a major system off Omega.  If I
encounter problems, what do I do?".  With Knuth, the answer is that he
will pay a finder's fee for any bug.  The maintanance intervals
nowadays have reached a proportion where it is clear that the effort
is fading out, but it was there initially.  With Omega, the answer was
"Don't bother us with that.  With the next big rising from the ashes,
it will all be obsolete, anyhow."  So we do not even have a proper
multilingual LaTeX format integrated with Omega.

All of these problems will be _exactly_ the same when (and if ever)
Omega2 will magically appear in fully functional glory out of the
void.

Maybe I am factually mistaken about some of the above points.  But if
I am, there is nothing on record to _show_ me wrong.  Even if some of
my impressions might possibly be wrong here, there is nothing I can
find published or in common knowledge to dispell them.  And in the
end, this is what counts.

I am maintainer of several TeX-related projects.  I am a lousy
maintainer, and a lousy worker.  I have moved AUCTeX (a project more
or less abandoned by Per Abrahamsen) to a much more visible place,
have got it accepted as a GNU project, have garnered visibility.  I am
blowing all my self-inflicted release deadlines, but the thing still
moves on.  People have come onboard that finish what I considered my
duties but didn't.  Stuff gets implemented where I am just standing
by.

Take a look at Linus Torvalds: how much actual programming is he
actually doing these days?  His time and expertise is too valuable for
that.  He is a full-time manager mostly, instead, and only actually
touches code when it is of vital importance.

A user and developer community does not magically appear with the
release of a package.  You have to prepare for it and work for it.

With AUCTeX, I have perhaps a user base of 10000 people or more, and
maybe 4 actively visible developers.  I am working on increasing those
numbers while balancing the development process.

With Omega, you have maybe 4 actively visible users (Yannis, Idris,
and who else?).  Regardless of whether they are using Omega1 or
Omega2, this will get you nowhere.  You need to cooperate with driver
authors, library maintainers and so on to make sure that switching to
Omega becomes a well-understood step and process.  And something that
will cause minimal pain when Omega2 will appear.  You can easily make
sure that by the time it appears, its requirements will be met by
xdvik, dvips, and other tools.  And, more importantly, you can make
sure that people _know_ this.  By having alpha testing, by gathering
experience, by trying to have people adapt it to macro packages and so
on.

Which would probably be a pity.  But I feel incapable of checking
that.

This works quite well (on a 4096 mbit connection) using compression and 
checksum testing: 

Number of files: 54260
Number of files transferred: 49532
Total file size: 1045634451 bytes
Total transferred file size: 1045631218 bytes

Matched data: 0 bytes
File list size: 1745134
Total bytes written: 792608
Total bytes read: 574648912

wrote 792608 bytes  read 574648912 bytes  273693.95 bytes/sec
total size is 1045634451  speedup is 1.82

It gives me a comfortable feeling to be able to sync this way.  

A few remarks: 

(1) i miss the tree: texmf-extra 

(2) when watching the file list fly by i saw that there are still gzipped afm files

(3) since the whole latex documentation seems to be there, if needed i can provide a complete set of context documentation -) 

(4) quite some big fonts/../cb|cm-super files: it's that i know tex otherwise i would be puzzled if all of those sizes make sense

lm fonts, at least, are delivered compressed from CTAN. 
should we uncompress?

yes please! I never know what to get or how. I'll make it a

unpacks into a doc/context tree

Here are additional changes that should catch some of the cases I
overlooked earlier in my eagerness to get the overly-intrusive code
out.  Some of it is rather ugly.  :-(

Corresponding changes for mf and mpost have still to be done.  (Same
for omega, aleph.)

Change 5025 on 2004/06/07 by olaf@olaf

        More changes to support spaces in filenames.  In particular, keep
        quotes around |cur_name|, |cur_ext|, and |cur_area| iff these
        contain spaces.  This incurs complications because we re-parse
        |name_of_file| into these components after opening a file.  The
        file-printing routine is changed to ensure that we print quotes
        if needed, but do not print any quotes contained in the parameters
        themselves.

        This fixes a problem reported by Akira Kakuto where LaTeX would
        be confused by an unquoted space in \jobname.

Um, this is what happened last year.  It is not new.

And it's not about disc formats, it's about licensing.  The stuff that

The problem is that this way we loose utopia and fourier which is a pitty since it a nice alternative for math typesetting. 

Say that we explicitly define texmf-extra as something not tex live but which can go on the cd that is distributed to the users, say that it's called: 

  tex-live + extras (something tex-live^{++} or tex-live^{#}) 
 
so, tex live is still the all-free stuff but users get some goodies. Whoever else than user groups decides to distribute tex live can omit that tree (tl's in in books and such).  

btw, are those utopia fonts really that much a problem?

I put fourier in TL at the weekend, having forgotten the licensing. 
issue of it :-}

I suppose I had better delete it. sigh.

Hi,

A few remarks:

- i synced the trees and in the root (same level as Master etc) there is 
a path tug2002 which to me looks out of place; maybe some leftover
- dvipdfmx is only available under windows, while it's quite actively 
meintained version and needed for cjk & pdf
- if space becomes a problem: there is a huge file dataII.tgz (30Meg) 
under the pstricks path
- there are quit esome pl/rb/py/sh scrips not moved to the scripts path 
yet, so they will not be found with kpsewhich if needed

yes, it shouldn't be there at all. I tried to delete it
with perforce, but I'm not sure whether it worked.

depends if tug wants it being published (i remember some issues with 
authors and permissions)

minor glytch: (dunno what it means):

   rename .nul.001496 -> nul : File exists

a few in in the main tree:

in the texmf-dist tree there are many more, also duplicates (like vpe.pl)

there is a bunch in texmf-doc but documentation is kind of special i guess

(will dist be cleaned up or is it a kind of garbage can?)

Imho, texmf-dist will be "clean" (in some sense at least) the day people
will submit packages in TDS form to CTAN and TeX distributions will be able
to download them "as-is" (ie: preinstalled).

It means that command line is crappy under Windows and makes any .nul* name
equivalent to 'nul', which is the /dev/null under Unix. You can't delete
such a file by normal means. Try from perl/ruby/whatever to unlink it.

Certainly yes, once the usual autoconf/automake stuff is in place.

This is data to test the pst-geo package.

I doubt you use that in your normal job. Actually I listed all the *.pl *.rb
*.py *.sh files and most of them are dedicated to tests or installation
(generation of files).

If someone feels that he can sort them out, it is easy to move those scripts
to texmf-dist/scripts/<package>/... but Sebastian's script will have to do
the same, else the changes will be lost at next package upgrade.

[ This is why it won't be clean until we give clear rules to package
maintainers and they do the job themselves. ]

quite a few packages have scripts coming with them. its up 
the reader to work out whether they are of any use at all.

eh? texmf-dist consists of packages from CTAN. why do you 
think its garbage? because the authors submit garbage to 
CTAN.....

at first sight, pretty much a disaster. the "demo" CD has

100 megabytes over target.

    the "demo" CD has about 500 megabytes too much, 

The demo CD is not being produced this year; instead, we'll include the
miktex CD (on its own, as is, no integration).  At least, I thought we
had all agreed on this.  Do we have to discuss it again?
    
    and the compressed CD is over 100 megabytes over target.

How can that be?  Is there that much more than last year?  Any hope of
comparing?

Getting rid of the 30mb data file for pstricks that Hans found would be
a start :).

I think there are less widely useful things to omit before cm-super.

see. the heat has addled my brain.

LOADS more. people keep producing these wretched packages, 
and Fabrice installs more and more Windows software...

grab a TL2003 and produce a listing of the zip files, I guess

I'd rate the data file above cm-super :-}

Subject: [tex-live] volunteer to implement lcab compression?
Message-ID: <200406081338.i58DcZG14423@f7.net>

For TL 2004, we want/need to use .cab files instead of .zip files on the
inst (compressed) CD, because .cab is what the Microsoft installer
supports, and Fabrice intends to replace TeXSetup with the MSI.  At the
same time, it is convenient to do the infrastructure rebuilds on our
Unix machines.

There's a program lcab, formerly cablinux, for Linux, which can write
cabinet files.  There are two implementations, one in C and one in Perl.
  http://www.geekshop.be/rien/lcab/

However ... it does not support writing of compressed cab files, which
is, of course, crucial.  Several algorithms are allowed, ZIP is probably
the easiest.  I wrote the author a few days ago but he has not
responded.

Can anyone here volunteer to add compression support to lcab?
Like, soon?  Either in the perl version or the C version, it doesn't
matter as long as it works :).

Of course it's not a matter of implementing a compression algorithm from
scratch, there are plenty of libraries and examples out there.  It just
has to be pulled together in whatever way .cab wants.

We (Sebastian and I) have not found any other programs to write .cab
files under Unix (many programs support reading .cab's).  There is a
library libmspack, but it doesn't yet support compression writing either.

Thanks,
k

What kind of compression is needed?  I've been on a C/Perl XS kick
lately, so perhaps I can get to this...

however you look at at, cb and cm-super are simply being greedy.

why not define compressed as "no dvi's when there are pdf's", actually, 
in that case the non pdf files in the doc tree can be compressed as well

so we should look into what is really used of the fonts (e.g. cmsuper/gb afm files are not used at all i think sincethe encodings are frozen and no afm2tfm is used there; afm files of generic type1 -like the urw fonts- are used) 

and, are all those design sizes really needed? if lm is set up right, plr, csr, aer can go as well 

how about all those mf files? and files under source?

I know this is not a first class solution. But would it be possible to
use MAKECAB.EXE from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncabsdk/html/cabdl.asp
which runs under windows and using wine it also runs under Linux or

Subject: [tex-live] Aleph RC3 committed
Message-ID: <MPG.1b3002c0f062c0e19896c5@news.gmane.org>

I *think* I have committed Aleph RC3 (ChangeSet 5054), which 
features OTP-related fixes and brings it in sync with the 
latest web2c changes (well, almost the latest, I just found out 
Olaf made some more changes).

Since this has been the first time I touched p4 actively, I 
*might* have fscked up something badly --I think not, but you 
never know.

The release of Aleph is RC3 even though the filenames are still 
called -rc2 (there is an eomem-rc3 but it is not used). I think 
it's time to start cleaning things up, which means:

1. it's time to remove the eomegadir directory;
2. the old -rc1 files can be removed;
3. the -rc2 files should be renamed stripping -rc2 and the 
Makefile be updated accordingly;
4. with the latest updates, Fabrice mentioned that the -w32 
files could be removed.

Now, I'm not comfortable enough with this kind of stuff 
(renaming etc); any pointers, so that I may try 3.? (deleting 
is probably easier than renaming, so 2. I think I can do with 
no problems).

Fabrice, can you please try a Windows build and see what is 
needed? Then we will know more precisely what can be removed (I 
think that the .ch[0-2] can go just now).

Which is already quite large. But your afm files are of no use in their
compressed form. TeXLive is supposed to be usable "as-is".

I think that AFM files which are contained in the cm-super can be safely
removed from the TeX Live which will save about 9Mb. They aren't needed
for TeX&friends and were added only to make the fonts usable with non-TeX
related applications.

Another option, of course, is to remove cm-super as a whole package. :-)

Best,

Cab format is intended for Windows platform. Therefore it doesn't know
about permissions and ownership.

I'd say yes because CABARC.EXE seems to treat files as binary. 

I did a small test like this:

This were the testfiles I put into a cabinet file:
CABARC.EXE:    MS Windows PE 32-bit Intel 80386 console executable
ci:            ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1
(FreeBSD), for FreeBSD 4.9, dynamically linked (uses shared libs),
stripped glossary.rdoc: ASCII English text
rake:          ASCII text
stats.ini:     ASCII English text
tcpdump:       ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

After extracting using cabextract md5 showed the same check sums as
before.

I do believe these will prove easier to insert.  And both my testing
and by Akira Kakuto indicates that for a change these actually work.

The format allows for additional data to be stored per cab file header
(CFHEADER), folder header (CFFOLDER), and data block (CFDATA), but not
per file header (CFFILE).

However, the additional data in a folder header is the same size for
all folders in the CAB file.  And the same goes for the additional
data per data block.

A data block can contain data of more than one file.

All of which taken together means that there is no really suitable
place to put additional per-file data in a CAB file -- you'd have to
resort to indirect methods like packaging an additional "file" with
the data.

In all it is not a very good distribution format for unix-like
systems.

Um, this means "no" as Thomas was asking about automatic translation
of NL to CRNL or CR, and all that.  And the answer is that for CAB
extractors the CAB file really contains a number of bytestreams, which
are not interpreted or changed.  (Personally, I like that.)

Basically, CAB does some tricks to get better compression than ZIP
will for the case with many small files, and is as far as I can tell
about equal on large files.

See my other mail as well.

No, the file format isn't good enough for that.  However, for our
purposes, when distribution stuff that goes into a texmf tree, we do
not care about ownership (we can install as the current user) and do
not care about permissions either, with the singular exception of
exectuables.

It seems to me we can simply 'chmod +x' everything in texmf*/scripts.
The problematic cases are non-windows executables that are (i)
distributed in CAB files, and (ii) in odd locations.

It seems to me we'd be using 'tar.gz' or 'zip' for the unix binaries,
which ought to leave only the scripts in texmf/web2c as odd ones out.
Correct?

Nope.

what I want to see is cm-super release a subset of itself,

I can't delete bits of peoples packages. it is against the rules.

as for the .mf files, don't lets start that war again :-}

Personally, I like the .pkg format of MacOS X with its BOM (bill of
materials, giving us the granularity we need for permissions of
files/directories), and its use of pax.  Only problem is that the
BOM format doesn't support LFS.  Not that we have a 4 GB file in
TeXLive...

And it so happens thaat mkbom and pax are part of *BSD variants, so
the source code is out there (to be ported to whichever platforms).

Or are we looking at CAB files for the MSI installer Fabrice is
working on?

Tom

Its easy enough for me to store .tar.gz for all the binary
packages, and .cab for all the text packages. Well, fiddly,
but doable. Fabrice will just ignore the .tar.gz anyway.
Adding a chmod +x for the scripts directory is OK. 

the ownership of files will presumably default to the 
person doing the install

the underlying question is: are we letting the Microsoft dog wag
the tail here? the only reason for using .cab is that Fabrice
says he wants to switch the MSI stuff, which only groks cab.
so the rest of the world suffers along.

if we don't find a resolution relatively easily, we'll have to
revert to the backup strategy, which is to not have a Windows installer
on the compressed CD at all. That would give us

  Live DVD: for everyone
  Compressed CD: for *Nix, and for Windows folk willing to hand unpack
  Extra CD: MikTeX

Or, indeed, forget about the compressed CD, and deliver just
MiKTeX and TL on a DVD.

Or, omit the compressed CD, and revert to a demo CD
with an even smaller subset.

Geez. Let's not start that discussion again this week?

the idea was that the latin modern would replace plr/csr/aer and part of

why not play dicatator a bit and announce to throw them out unless it

well, sometimes one gets away with just starting a war and removing unwanted elements from the scenery 

btw, since it's scripts doing the automatic mf to pk thing (in case of missing fonts), couldn't those tools just gunzip the files before they are used? kind of what the new kpse library will do

Well, at least it ran under wine on my system. Different wines could
give you different results :-), although CABARC.EXE seems to be
relatively harmless in a sense of challenging Wine.

Here's my environment where it ran successfully:
FreeBSD 4.10-STABLE
wine-20040505

Eeek!  Seeking around in a compressed file is not easy at all.

I know that it would be relatively easy to implement ZIP compression
in lcab, with the understanding that separate files go into separate
data blocks (i.e., no one file is split between data blcoks), but I
am not sure if the tools out there in *NIX land grok these types of
cabinet files...

As for convincing Fabrice about ZIP inside CAB:  we could then get around
implementing ZIP compression in lcab, but then Fabrice's installer would
have to postprocess the ZIP archive.  Not sure how easy that is/isn't in
the MSI framework...

I agree fully as CAB format is meant for Windows. IMHO it is problematic
to use it for Unix like systems.

Thomas's questions surely were valid and helpful. I was just kidding

I seriously doubt that compressing the .mf files save much space

please lets remember that all this compression talk is to
get stuff on a CD for delivery; once its installed its back
to normal.

The cab works is that the files to be compressed are bundled into
"folders" -- concatenated, really.  These folders are compressed in
blocks of 32.  Among the data provided is where each file starts and
ends in the uncompressed data stream, and to which part of the
uncompressed stream each data block corresponds.  I think this means
you can skip to the right block, start decompression there, and drop

That would almost certainly be invalid under the CAB specs.

Of interest:

<http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/cab/2.0/w98nt42kmexp/en-us/Cabsdk.exe>

Latter is just a self-extracting ZIP.

Not only once.  Problem is that more and more packages come with PDF
documentation files as to the new CTAN policy.  That means that we
get cm-super probably half a gazillion times, and the Type1 cm fonts
another half gazillion times.

With DVI at least we did not get those fonts time and again.

All is in the subject. There is another reason why it wouldn't work. The
layout of the files needed for the MSI installer doesn't fit either with
what has been done until now. I doubt any body wants to see that kind of
things:

This is the aeguill package ready for use with the MSI installer.

So forget about it under Unix. I'm investigating another option using
something more standard.

I don't see automatic translation as a problem. TeXLive under win32 does not
need it. The only files requiring cr-lf are .bat files, but if they are
coded this way and the archive takes them as binary files, then it will
work.

I may have found a workaround to use zip files. But it needs a little bit of
testing. And I'm afraid I won't be able to give it a try before next week.

The cab stuff is not the way to go: files are stored in a manner that is too
dependent of the rest of the msi file. That makes it impracticable for unix.
Sorry for not having stopped down this sooner.

I know this is not a first class solution. But would it be possible to
use MAKECAB.EXE from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncabsdk/html/cabdl.asp
which runs under windows and using wine it also runs under Linux or

I *strongly* oppose any solution that makes no use of an open source tool,
even more one that *only* works in a Windows environment.

I also wonder if cab is such a good idea if it (as I understand it) does
not support permissions.

As far as I'm concerned we should *not* use the cab format unless we have
an open source portable tool to create them. And as I understand it,
Fabrice can use zip inside cab, so he can go ahewd with zip on the Windows
platform.

Hi again,

I have a kind of recovery mode in texexec that generates formats when
they are not found. For that I run "kpsewhich cont-en.efmt"; of course
that will fail in the new fmt regime. The new cnf file says:

% Dump files (fmt/base/mem) for vir{tex,mf,mp} to read (see web2c/INSTALL),
% and string pools (.pool) for ini{tex,mf,mp}.  It is silly that we have six
% paths and directories here (they all resolve to a single place by
default),
% but historically ...
TEXFORMATS =            .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//
MFBASES    =            $TEXFORMATS
MPMEMS     =            $TEXFORMATS
TEXPOOL    =            $TEXFORMATS
MFPOOL     =            $TEXFORMATS
MPPOOL     =            $TEXFORMATS

since we're breaking with the past and since this new setting will
undoubtely interfere with existing older installations (i.e. when one
sets the env var without engine in which case he/she will find out that
multiple engines will clash) ... why not break abit more with the past
and get rid of the 5 duplicates; or maybe even use a new variable

TEXMFDUMPS

When defined, that one is used, otherwise the old ones are used. This
permits new versions (distributions) to start using the $engine system,
while older binaries will not fail on it since they don't know about
this new engine regime.

breaking existing setups (old binaries quit on an unknown flag); so, i
wonder if it is possible (for the sake of future extensions, as well as
for the sake of disappearing flags (oem and such) to let the binaries
ignore unknown flags (a warning at most); now we have the problem that
newer trees (e.g containing a newer texexec or other tex calling
program) will no longer work with an old set of binaries.

(also, is there a well defined return code scheme, so that one can see
why a program quits? like, 1 = error, 2 = missing format/mem/base, 3 =
mismatching kpse, etc)

btw:

- how do older engines react on $engine?
- and is $engine defined in the tds standard ... (in the past some
pdftex was used next to pdfetex as well as for both engines, e.g for map
files)
- don't we need some kind of 'registration' system for that: tex etex
pdftex pdfetex pdfetex-pl (what is the convention for such language
things?) omega aleph xetex pdfxtex (the 'known' ones)

Hi,

- windows binaries : still tl80 prefix for dll's (should be 90)
- mpost does not provide the -8bit switch yet (so i cannot patch/upload
context/texexec yet, sorry)
- -oem is still there, wasn't that to go?

for fabrice: mpost.exe is not in the static binary path

Just providing a warning is easy, though options with arguments are
problematic if the -option=argument syntax isn't used, because the
program doesn't 'skip' the argument in that case.

No.

They don't set it, shouldn't see it.

It is specific to web2c, so not defined/covered by the TDS.

The engine name is hard-coded in the binary.  The current list of
known engines lives in texmfmp.h.  I'm not sure exactly how the *-pl
variants differ from the standard ones, so I cannot say at present
whether things need to be done differently.

So it works right now, without any setlocale calls?  I assume that
means we're depending on "CharToOem" doing the right thing by default.

There are still "space in file name" issues with mf, mpost in the main
sources.

The setlocale() used to force the code page. CharToOem() will work with the
user's defaults.

Right. Will you fix them the same way you did it with tex?

In texmfmp.c when doing the call to makempx, filenames have to be quoted if
they have spaces. In makempx.c, it is the same when calling mpto.

Ah yes, I see we're using system() there...

cp8bit used to be the default (without the need for a -8bit switch), so 
now everything that does not use fmtutil has to be adapted
(i wonder how this influences miktex)

What in TeX Live does not use fmtutil?  I was under the impression this
was the only way formats got created.

Hello Hans,

> cp8bit used to be the default (without the need for a -8bit switch),
> so now everything that does not use fmtutil has to be adapted

If you want the same for texexec, then make this -8bit available via
setting in your config file (context/config/texexec.ini). People who have
a new engine can make use of the new option. teTeX's and TL's version
of this config file can ship with the new configuration.

If you want to support old binaries as well and if you don't want to
rely on fmtutil, you have to provide both ways for creating the formats.

If you don't want that the user has to set an option for this, you have
to detect the engine yourself (e.g. parse "pdfetex --help").

> (i wonder how this influences miktex)

In no way. MikTeX has its own implementation of TeX.

The *-pl variants just use the standard engines with localized pool files.

fmtutil assumes a unique format name, while some ConTeXt users
want to use the same format name with the other engine.
Therefore Olaf introduced $engine when he unified the
format suffix (.fmt).
Thomas decided not to support the $engine mechanism in
fmtutil because most people may not need the mechanism,
and because it is a bit complicated.

remark: context formats are on a per-interface basis:

cont-en -> english user interface
cont-nl -> dutch user interface

etc. Since drivers are loaded dynamically there is no need to have 
formats for dvi and pdf (so no pdfcont-en and dvicont-en which makes no 
sense anyway)

texexec --make  [en nl ... metafun mptopdf]

wil generate formats after updates; normally on tetex it will use 
fmtutil, unless --alone is specified; this also works for miktex (i 
don't know if fmtutil nowadays generates metapost formats as well, but 
there were times when only plain mp was shipped);

(i have noticed that many tex users don't know the difference between a 
format and a program (using a format); one reason for handling things 
this way was that i could bypass complex explanations)

hm, although this is web2c specific, i consider the structure under the web2c path in the tds conforming tds tree to be kind of a standard; if the standard is that flexible, i wonder why i conformed and moved stuff to the scripts path (thereby crippling some things since it splits packages in an unnatural way)

well, you know how linux distributions work: they ship old tex's while 
users want new macros (no problem since they can update that part in a 
local tree) ; also, there is the "unwilling to update sysadm" problem -)

last night i spent some time on that issue,

i thought about parsing the banner, but then i depend on

- the engine having that name
- the  keeping the same format (or adapt at each new version)

and so i rejected that option;

i decided for this year to use --translate-file=natural.tcx in 
texexec.ini and next year to switch to --8bit

(i hope that live will be more comfortable when the new kpse libraryis 
there and can be accessed as a deamon)

Hi,

When trying to implement something downward compatible i found out that

it looks like something gets lost as well as that we're still living in

Also, is it possible to have something

  kpsewhich --release

which report a number which increments with each major change for which 
we can make a list, like:

release       feature

2004.05.12    new texmf.cnf with enc/map paths
2004.05.13    --texmfscripts
2004.05.28    --8bit
2004.05.29    $engine

That way tools can quickly test for the state of features.

Yes, my fault. Will be fixed in the next binaries. You should get something

I bought the book latex2e by thomas demmig together with a cd.
I am using windows at my computer and I would like
to install latex.
I think I managed the first part, but the problem is xemacs.
I am used to this editor (which I used in Linux during my PhD) and I
would actually like to keep using this one. But unfortunately there is not a
single
sentence in te book that gives any hint of how to install this editor.
could you please help me further?

yours sincerely,

meike akveld

      kpsewhich --release

Please don't invent a new option.  If the information is to be supplied,
I strongly urge that it be added to --version.  That's what --version is for.

    That way tools can quickly test for the state of features.

It would be nice, but I really doubt it would ever be reliable.  No
program on earth does it this nicely, to my knowledge.

    i consider the structure under the web2c path in the tds conforming
    tds tree to be kind of a standard

No.  It's web2c-specific.  That's why it's under web2c/ :).

    i wonder why i conformed and moved stuff to the scripts path

scripts is in TDS (not just web2c).
Of course, all standards are voluntary, and the TDS more than most, but
that's another story.

    (thereby crippling some things since it
    splits packages in an unnatural way)

As you know perfectly well, the whole TDS is set up to divide things by
file type (not my choice), thus "crippling" and "splitting" packages in
an "unnatural" way.

I see nothing that can be done about it at this late date, except to
start over completely.  Feel free.

When using the adobe plugin for acrobat reader (in my case version 5.0.5
and mozilla firefox on Linux)

The plugin fails to display some pdf files made using pdflatex. they end
up just being blank or just showing a few words or characters.

I just wanted to know wheter other people have had the same experiences

And if anyone had any idea what's causing this.

Downloading the file to disk and then launching acrobat works fine.

I hadn't experienced the problem on Linux before, but
problem has also been reported on windows using IE

Great right after I had send this mail I found a hint (the READme file
from AR 5.0.8.

I have to upgrade my webserver, Apaches below version 1.3.17 can cause
problems like the above in combination with the AR plugin.

Sorry for the inconvenience

    bound that to new features, whil eversion is for new builds and such. 

I don't think this idea is practical.  Releases are what matter;
potentially, new features could be included there.  However, I am
doubtful even of that, because "feature" is so ill-defined, has
different incarnations, different bugs, etc.

The date that Olaf checks in a new feature into development code is
irrelevant and useless, seems to me.

The only reliable way I can think of to do this is the autoconf method
-- write code that tests exactly the feature you need.  (Not claiming
this is easy.)  Hoping to be able grep some text description for your
precise need seems to me like pure fantasy.

    hm, i fear you're right, which is probably why software will be
    short-live until that is sorted out

Yep.  We're doing our best to make even TeX be incompatible :).

XEmacs for Windows is part of the TeX Live distribution, and is in fact
a basic part of it.  It should simply be a package to install.

You may also want to get the latest from fptex.org.

There's also the possibility of getting the original xemacs distribution
itself from xemacs.org.

Hope this helps.

Just woundering, why was NTEmacs abandoned in TL 2003? None of my users
are using Xemacs, in fact I think I only know one XEmacs user. A lot of my
users rely on the fact that the Emacs version/flavor they use one their
windows systems behave and look exactly like the one they use on our Linux
system. (well preview-latex doesn work yet... on windows)

I usualy just let them borrow a copy of TL 7 just to get the NTEmacs
(because it alrady has Auc TeX installed)

It works, but only with developer versions of Emacs.  And the same
goes for the toolbar.  Now if you stipulate that working versions of
the toolbar and preview-latex might be important to Windows users,
then you are caught in the dilemma of picking an underfeatured and
somewhat outdated version of Emacs, or a judiciously selected
developer snapshot of Emacs, or both.  You would need a competent
Emacs/TeX/Windows user to make sure to get a reasonably working and
well-configured pick.  And Fabrice uses XEmacs.

I don't think that a full-fledged Emacs release will happen in time
before TL2004.  But I'll be quite cross if TL2005 comes without Emacs.

You might want to take a look at the NTEmacs developer snapshots that
somebody does every few months or so.

Not at all. I don't think we have any users using preview-latex (my fault
I guess, I normally just use gv and perhaps latexmk)

I just wanted a version of NTEmacs and Auc TeX of course to be on the CD.
That's all my users need.

Most people here don't use all of the hidden potential in Auc TeX, most
just just it to insert environments, sections fontcommands and to compile
the file and perhaps contert it into ps, that all.

I hope to have the time to do a long LaTeX introduction again this fall,
in which I'll demonstrate preview-latex. But the users here basically just
do what ever I tell them to do ;-) ...

I found that I had screwed up, and was a) copying binaries  multiple 
times. and b) not using the flag on "zip" which tops
symbolic links being expanded. Combined with the death of "demo" means 
that the compressed CD (loads of zip files) is
about 600 Mbytes, and the live one for DVD is about 1.3 Gbytes

the problem won't go away, but for this year lets assume all is OK.

now that the .CAB spectre has receded,  we are left with

 *  Olaf/Thomas/Thanh/Martin/Fabrice agreeing on a stable source
 *  Sebastian/Karl  checking Unix install
 *  Fabrice finding way to use zip files in an install
 *  Compiling binaries

which isn't so bad, really. then it comes back to
  * Documentation
  * Testing

Sebastian brought up the subject of binaries, so its time to review the
situation for TL2004.

Here's what we shipped for TL2003:

TeXLive2003
===========
i386-linux (i386 Linux)
powerpc-darwin6.3 (MacOSX)
win32 (32-bit Windows, i.e., 9X and later)
alpha-linux (HP Alpha Linux)
i386-freebsd (i386 FreeBSD)
i386-openbsd (i386 OpenBSD)
i386-solaris (Sun i386 Solaris)
mips-irix (SGI IRIX)
powerpc-aix (IBM RS/6000 AIX)
sparc-solaris (Sun Sparc Solaris)
sparc64-linux (Sparc Linux)

Other available options that I'm aware of or have local access to:

opteron64-linux (AMD64 AMD 64-bit Opteron Linux 2.4 SuSE 8 ES)
powerpc-darwin (PowerPC Apple Mac G4 Mac OS X Mac OS X Server Edition with
Fink)
i386-linux (x86 dual Intel Pentium III Linux 2.4 Red Hat Linux 7.3)
i386-linux (x86 dual Intel Pentium III Linux 2.2 Debian GNU/Linux 2.2)
alpha-linux (Alpha DEC Alpha EV67 Linux 2.2 Debian GNU/Linux 3.0)
sparc64-linux (Sparc64 Sun Ultra 60 Linux 2.4 Debian GNU/Linux 3.0)
sparc-solaris (Sparc Sun Ultra Enterprise R220 Solaris Sun Solaris 8)
strongarm-linux (StrongARM CerfCube SA1110 Linux 2.4 Debian GNU/Linux 3.0)
power4-aix

Can we work out who is going to handle binaries for the respective
platforms ? From memory Gerben handles powerpc-darwin, Norbert handles
i386-linux ...

Regards

Bear space considerations in mind. The compressed CD is now running at 
600 mbytes, so we have
50 left to play with at most. This is compressed, so you can afford to 
add perhaps 3 more platforms (a typical set
comes in at about 25 mbytes)

I can do these:

sparc-solaris (Sun Sparc Solaris)

But i don't have time, so i'll wait until sources stabilize a bit to
avoid multiple builds.

I'm not excited about adding more (relatively) obscure platforms.  It is
hard enough to manage the ones we have.  Also, filling up the compressed
CD so that we're perpetually having to hack at a package here and a
package there to reduce the size, as we had to do with demo, sounds like
a big time sink to me, with little gain.  

Binaries for any platform can be made available on the web.
We've done that before.

Yes.

I believe Staszek does i386-linux, and Norbert alpha-linux.

win32 -> Fabrice.

i386-*bsd -> Sebastian, as I recall (or someone at Sebastian's work)

Looking at the p4 logs, Staszek also checked in sparc64-linux.

It seems the mips-irix binaries are deleted (according to p4 fstat), I
don't know why.  (And p4 doesn't delete the files, although sync says
everything is up to date.  Argh.  I will never understand.)

The biggest time sink occurs when things don't build cleanly.  If 
you do succeed in building on an obscure platform I'd rather see that
documented than get your binaries.  There is something to be said for
encouraging more people to learn how to install a TeX distro from sources.

Binaries are really only necessary for those platforms (Win32, Mac OS) 
where the majority of users lack tools required to build a disto. 
I'd rather see the effort managing binaries and deciding which 
packages to delete from the CD go towards testing/documenting what works 
for the obscure platforms.

This automatic loading of cp8bit was not univerally implemented. It was
in TeX live, but never in any version of teTeX.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.56.0406141056220.14954@mulga.cs.mu.OZ.AU>


So summarising the binary situation, here's what I see currently.

Proposed TeXLive2004 Binary List for live and inst
==================================================
i386-linux (i386 Linux)			Staszek
powerpc-darwin6.3 (MacOSX)		Gerben
win32 (32-bit Windows, i.e., 9X and later)	Fabrice
alpha-linux (HP Alpha Linux)		Norbert
i386-freebsd (i386 FreeBSD)		Sebastian ? TBC
i386-openbsd (i386 OpenBSD)		Sebastian ? TBC
i386-solaris (Sun i386 Solaris)		Baden
mips-irix (SGI IRIX)			Kaja ? TBC
powerpc-aix (IBM RS/6000 AIX)		Vladimir
sparc-solaris (Sun Sparc Solaris)	Vladimir
sparc64-linux (Sparc Linux)		Staszek

I'm under the impression that we can fit 2 or 3 more binary sets on the
CDROM as it stands. Anything else should be released online.

I can't see any glaring absences here (except if Sebastian can't produce
*bsd binaries), so I'm inclined to say that's it for this year. Comments ?

The only others which come to mind are: opteron64-linux and power4-aix -
both of which I can take care of if there's interest. I can probably arrange *bsd binaries if
Sebastian can't thistime around.

Regards

Baden

If required I can produce FreeBSD 4.10 (which currently is stable)
binaries.

hm, such differences make support painful; the best i could come up with is to let context report if 8 bit support is enabled (but the message probably goes unnoticed)

I have a proposed fix for that.  makempx also needs a few quotes here
and there to become "space-clean".

(Btw, I'm not completely happy with the code in mp.ch, but got weird
errors when I tried to move the re-parsing of name_of_file to
make_name_string, something which went smoothly with tex and mf.  If
anyone can puzzle out how to do that...)

Hey, I did complain but only later

For our HPUX 10.20+11 it needs to be compiled, which I have done by
hand the last few years. TL 7 was a pain in the b** because of the broken
source.

As long as I can compile it here I don't mind simply leaving it out of TL,
we're outfacing the HP system (using Linux instead) so hopefully in the
future I will not need it.

I managed to compile TL 2003 with a few problems (for some reason it will
only compile om HPUX 10.20, but I think this has to do with our setup) and
it's very very slow (I did one test where my test document compiled within
0.5 sec on a Linux server and 20-30 secs on our HPUX 10.20), but I don;t
mind I only use Linux and when people complain about the speed on HPUX I
just ask them to use a Linux server, and I never hear them complain again
;-)

Hello,
it runs nicely here. Looks like some misconfiguration in your installation.
What gives 
	kpsewhich CJK.enc	
	kpsewhich CJK.sty 
?
Is CJK in your TEXMF tree? Where is CJK.enc found, after you type it in?
Is the error message correct? It can't find CJK.en (?)

Good luck

No need to count me in here, as long as I can compile the binaries for
HPUX here that's all I need. and for what I know I'm the only one who need
a TL version of TL.

I would like to see whether the current source code compiles for HPUX, but
I don't have access to them.

Yes!  This is the very mystery!  How is the final `c' dropped?  Typing
in `CJK.enc' makes latex continue.

(1)\input CJK.enc%
(2)\input CJK.encX
(3)\input CJK.enc\relax
(4)\input "CJK.enc"
All succeed. (2) is particularly interesting: X is dropped.
Side effects of pace code support in file name?

It is related to the spaces-in-filenames code (of course).  What
happens is that code that keeps TeX from going beyond the end of the
buffer when filenames are quoted misfires.  That particular bit of
code is there to provide some sanity in cases where the quotes are
unbalanced.

This table is a bit premature -- first you need a list of systems
where TL builds and has been (properly) tested.

But you can make sure the individual components that go into TL work: 
e.g., teTeX, tex4ht, and also 3rd party utilities (perl, ImageMagick, 
ruby, ghostscript, xpdf?).  If you are confident all these packages build 
on your system, then it shouldn't take much to work out the remaining 
glitches in a pre-release snapshot.

I've been playing with builds on IRIX (and encountering some glitches
and problems requiring manual intervention).  But before I try to
submit anything I'd like to be certain that I know how to do a
"canonical" build for TeX-live, and what I should do to verify that
the build is complete.

OK so a requirement is a basic build instruction set for TL2004. Such a
thing existed in the TL2003 docs, but I'm not sure how much, if any that's
changed for TL2004.

Sebastian, when you build, what do you do ? That's a starting point.

He also pointed out that this new subdirectory should be added to
TEXPSHEADERS (and TEXPSHEADERS.gsftopk).  

I've now done this.  Change #5109, to Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.
I hope that's the right place ...

I often get completely meaningless logging messages after saying

  p4 changes -l

Example:

  Change 5108 on 2004/06/18 by karl@karltug

          regen

  Change 5107 on 2004/06/17 by karl@karltug

          regen

Is it possible to either make this a complete sentence, or, in case a
script is doing this change, add the affected file name to the entry?

BTW, is there a better way to see Changes in a list together with the
changed files (with or without a diff)?  `p4 changes' is not verbose
enough -- I consider this as a weakness of p4.  I only know of `p4
describe #' which gives the list for just a single entry.  Given the
big number of changes recently, it is a tedious job to check all
changes manually...

              regen

Well, obviously that is quite terse :), but I don't think it is
"completely" meaningless.  It tells you the file was regenerated via a
script, not edited by hand.

Anyway, it was actually only yesterday that I figured out how to
automatically submit the changes to p4, and there was still a bug in it
today, (which is why I hadn't announced anything yet), so I was typing
the "regen" by hand.  In my automated version (Master/Tools/tlrebuild),
the submit message will be a little more verbose:
  regenerated by $0
I don't see any point to making it a complete English sentence.

    add the affected file name to the entry?

I submit everything at once, could be hundreds of files.  The list of
affected files is, of course, already being given to p4 in the
changelist.  It seems silly to repeat the information in the log message
when it's already there.

HP machines were phased out at my dept in 2003 - the last

I sent a note on the subject a few months ago... I was able to make 
mips-irix binaries until TL2003; this year, SGI has been discontinued
at my dept. If we need irix binaries someone else will need to step in.

Current tendency here seems to be Windows and Linux...

Help is always welcome. What sort of setup do you have? is it easy for 
you to download a
650 megabyte ISO image file, mount it,. and see how well the install

Inspite of its name, german.sty and ngerman.sty work with both plain

I'm not sure about the hyphxmpl.tex file, but I think it should go to

Similarly, the documentation files should be moved from

That's also the location that I have given these files in teTeX (generic,
not latex). Same for the documentation.

hyphxmpl.cfg? I have it in only in texmf/source, not in texmf/tex. I

Message-ID: <200406192317.i5JNH3c11842@f7.net>

Regarding the \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined issue.

To implement what we've discussed at length, I've created a file
texmf-dist/tex/latex/config/pdftex-dvi.ini which disables the relevant
primitives (still leaving them accessible as \normalFOO).

I changed latex.ini to input this file only if pdftex is in fact being
used, as Thomas outlined.  Change #5137.

What I'm wondering now is what other formats need the same treatment.
Below is a list of all the (non-pdf) */config/.ini files.  I guess I'm
responsible myself for Eplain and Texinfo; I don't think the pdftex-dvi
compatibility is needed for either.

Can whoever is responsible for any of the others chime in?  mex and
amstex seem particularly likely to me, but it's not my place ...

Seems perfectly done. Many thanks, Karl.
I'd only suggest another localisation:
texmf/tex/generic/config/pdftex-dvi.tex (please observe: not .ini)
along with pdftexconfig.tex (it will serve not only for latex).
Moreover it should belong to the core distribution.

One more small correction in latex.ini (and other files):
< % We're building the latex format with the pdftex engine (started 2004).    
> % We're building the latex format with the pdfetex engine (started 2004).
                                               ===
The same comment should be used in pdftex-dvi.tex
(at first latex switched to etex engine, then to pdfetex, not pdftex).

I've just built the iso image after last changes (5137) and started
testing installations on linux:

sed: can't read /usr/TeX/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf: No such file...
the same with texmf.cnf

as a result texmf/ and texmf-dist/ contain only (incomplete) configuration
files, no binaries, macros, fonts, etc. :(
Seems that temporary list of packages to be installed is removed before

My personal view is that only LaTeX is widely-enough used to warrant the 
extra step of compatibility
with the old world; perhaps some of the language-specific variants too, 
but users of the resr can adapt.

just my view, though.

from the compressed CD,  you mean? I have only just got that install at

I am not surprised if there are errors. I am trying now

If its the "live" install, please tell me, as that should be working

Thanks to Dylan Thurston at Debian, John Hobby has released the sources
to the base metapost documentation, mpman and mpgraph, under a free
(same as metapost itself) license.  Hobby originally write them for
LaTeX 2.09; Dylan updated them to LaTeX 2e, and Hobby has approved the
current versions.

I checked them in to Master/texmf-dist/doc/metapost/base[/source], and
rearranged that directory considerably, as well as hacked the index.html
there, etc.  Sorry, Ulrich, I did not integrate the Makefiles; there's a
simple one for mpman and mpgraph, but I didn't touch yours for mpintro
and grdemo.  If you or anyone would like to finish that up, it would be
great.

If/when it looks ok, I guess I'll submit to CTAN, unless someone else
would like to take responsibility for this area ...

there is no special treatment needed for context since it's designed to 
handle any driver/backend without the need for special format creation;  
for the sake of  conforming  what users expect from tex (context), it 
should default to dvi output (the output driver defaults to dvips; 
needed for special mp processing purposes; changing that would force me 
and users to patch mptex calls);

so: dvi output and all primitives present

OK. I tried with another tl-compressed made after #5137
and installed using default settings (recommended scheme). 
Some notes what has failed
1.in texmf-var/: 
a. building global map files
b. language.dat
c. fmtutil.cnf
d. config.ps (not copied to texmf-var/)

2. in texmf/
a. in doc/ we have man/man3/zlib only? 
b. web2c/texmf.cnf 0 bytes

every subdirectory in texmf-local/ has redundant local/ subdirectory
(I think that texmf-local is enough local ;-)

It is somehow strange that on linux I have xemtex/man/ installed,
containing cjpeg etc., libpng and png manuals.
man pages in so many directories seems to me hardly usable on linux/unix,
I cannot expect the users want to adapt their MANPATH to every directory.

[As for me I would prefer merging the installed stuff into one texmf/
but I'm scared to start any new discussion. It is so difficult to check
the completness, what goes where, etc...]

When making tl-compressed we don't need texmf-var/ on the CD. Moreover
texmf-doc/ should contain not only texlive-en but also other 
translations. The cd has also empty tpm/ directory (?) but lists/
are gathered only in texmf/

I can expect one more problem: the current texconfig makes working
copies of configuration files and language.dat in texmf-local/ (not in 
texmf-var/ !),
texmf-var/web2c/ contains *only* format files and another copy 
of updmap.cfg (!). Having working installation (not that the above one)
I've just failed to run updmap...
As stated in many places, texmf-var/ *is* dedicated for working
configuration files and format files generated by the user.
I investigated many people and they tend (like me) to keep all such stuff
(config files and formats) in texmf-var/, leaving texmf-local/ for
user's macros&fonts. Now we have some mess in that (e.g. Win32 
still uses texmf-var/ for cnf&fmt). I'd be really happy if we could
keep compatibility between different platforms...
Thomas, we discussed that problem, perhaps it is good time to reconsider
that on TL forum?

Voila, for "live" image":
Before displaying menu:
ls: collection*tpm: No such file...

Preparing list of files works extremelly slowly (e.g. I see Czech/Slovak
about 1 min., PC 1.8Mhz machine)

Too many errors like:
/bin/gtar: *Size\: 1048: Cannot stat...
/bin/gtar: *Size\: 1271: Cannot stat...
/bin/gtar: *Title\: Base documentation: Cannot stat...
/bin/gtar: *Title\: Essential programs and files: Cannot stat...
/bin/gtar: -bin-tex: Cannot stat...

Compared to tl-compr. (installed 156 binaries) I have now only 107.
Anyway, macros and fonts seems to be better installed then for compressed, 
except missing contex, obsolete texmf-dist/omega/ (recommended scheme), etc.

Since install-tl.sh runs texconfig init, we have config files in texmf-var/
and in texmf-local/ and that's really problem. I'm writing that not because
I love being show stopper and not because I love starting discussions :(

Yes, texmf-var now contains the automatically generaled stuff. TEXMFLOCAL
contains the local additions and customization. That sounds logical
to me...

So it does to me... Let's keep it this way, if possible. As it happens,
that's how I've kept our texmf-var and texmf-local here for years :-)
Along this line, it'd be logical to initialise texmf-local as an empty directory
to start with...

this is a generic qx.enc used for many fonts.
Karl, do you want to include the documentation to fontinst?

Good point! But from practical and simple user's point of view for TL
installation it is now obligatory having not only VARTEXMF but also
TEXMFLOCAL (not to mention texmf, texmf-dist and texmf-doc installed). 
I played with different (strange?) settings like removing TEXMFLOCAL in
texmf.cfg (why not?) and it seems that now I have to copy to VARTEXMF all
needed config files by hand (I ignore here the current state of what was
made by install-tl, anyway incomplete in that regard; I can also consider
that TEXMFMAIN could be RO for the user).  

Thomas, having in mind your good arguments (I received some more directly,
many thanks), the question is: should TL (or teTeX) be more friendly and
easy to maintain for the admin or for the simple user? I have several
experiences that the admins just ignore (or not understand) the TeX world
and install the TeX stuff _as is_ (teTeX from strange linux distributions
or even TL). I still think that for such reasons it would be much more
easy for the user having (and maintaining) just one /home/texmf directory
(or VARTEXMF for single user system) for not only private macros but also
for the format file with needed hyphention patterns and some config files.
It would be easier when (one needed) format and config files could be kept
in the same tree as it would be more natural an understandable.

texmf-local is not only empty now, but contains customization files.
The problem is to find an agreement which could satisfy both admins
and simple users.
Anyway, if we're going to switch to the current bahaviour (*hot* files
like formats only in VARTEXMF, config files in TEXMFLOCAL), we (who?)
have to rewrite many documentation files for TL...

Hope not annoying,

Hi friends!

After three weeks of being off line working in foreign countries, I have
done now a recompile on alpha-linux and submitted new binaries. Now
there are 229 files in alpha-linux. Compared to i386-linux with 228
files there is kpsereadlink missing in i386-linux

here i have been using the following policy:

- texmf         => the official stuff, i.e. the latest official tex live
- texmf-local   => updates
- texmf-project => project related files 
- texmf-fonts   => commercial fonts and generated metrics 
- texmf-mswin/macosx/linux => binaries and formats (so that trees can be shared, i.e. a linux server can serve windows clients) 

- texmf-var => not used since it may end up in strange places (temp user paths and such, in which case things go unnoticed)

(so, i have to adopt config files anyway)

The following map files are missing but mentioned in updmap.cfg:
mapWarn notFound context.map
mapWarn notFound nnt.map

Should these lines be removed from updmap.cfg or the map files added?

Probably removed, but when I added the existing map files from ConTeXt, I
got lots of duplicates. I didn't investigated it that much however.

there is no need to add those file to the cfg file since [dependin gon the way a user sets up his cont-sys file] context loads those map files on demand (bypassing the big file)

Great, but then the setup has to be reviewed because it didn't work out of
the box for me when I tried it last week.

By the way, I think context should be given default config files on texlive.

    it is now obligatory having not only VARTEXMF but also
    TEXMFLOCAL 

That was not how I read Thomas's note:

TE> Yes, texmf-var now contains the automatically generaled stuff. 
TE> TEXMFLOCAL contains the local additions and customization. That 
TE> sounds logical to me...

I read this as saying texmf-local is for, well, local stuff.  You don't
have any local stuff that you did yourself, you don't need texmf-local.


Oh, I see (I think), Thomas was considering the texconfig run to be a
local customization, hence in texmf-local.  That's true, in a way, but
in practice, Thomas, I don't see how it helps.  It splits up changes
made by "the system" into both texmf-var and texmf-local.  People run
texconfig as part of the system installation.  Why not keep texmf-local
for the stuff the user installs personally?  That makes it a clean and
understandable separation.

We've been using texmf-var for all such automatically updated stuff for
years.  Why change now?  Who benefits?

    should TL (or teTeX) be more friendly and
    easy to maintain for the admin or for the simple user? 

Well, we try to make everyone as happy as possible, you know that :).
Not that's possible.

    experiences that the admins just ignore (or not understand) the TeX
    world and install the TeX stuff _as is_

Certainly, that is what most people do.  

    easy for the user having (and maintaining) just one /home/texmf directory

That makes it simpler to do an installation in any single year, but it
makes updates basically impossible.  Thus I do not think we should
recommend that.

    The problem is to find an agreement which could satisfy both admins
    and simple users.

As I implied in my other msg, I don't see how admins benefit from having
texconfig-generated config files in TEXMFLOCAL.  I just want to go back
to the way we've always done it ...

    Anyway, if we're going to switch to the current bahaviour (*hot* files
    like formats only in VARTEXMF, config files in TEXMFLOCAL), we (who?)

Ultimately, I guess I am responsible for live.tex.  Not that I wouldn't
love to give it up.

I always advise people against configuration files in texmf-local:
configuration files syntax and semantics have changed over the years, people
tend to put tailored configuration in TEXMFLOCAL and forget about them.

IMHO:
- configuration files should be copied to VARTEXMF
- user (or admin) may do some hand editing on them
- any installer should be allowed to overwrite configuration files when
updating (from TL2003 to TL2004),
- people should be warned they may have to apply their changes in case of
upgrade
- no configuration file should occur in TEXMFLOCAL or outside VARTEXMF and
TEXMFMAIN.

        New binaries for IRIX 6.5.  You need to have patch 5377 installed
        on IRIX 6.5.18 or older in order to be able to run these.

This patch installs the MIPSpro 7.4 runtimes needed by the C++-based
binaries.  If this is considered unacceptable, I can recompile with
older compilers/libraries.  Otherwise we may want this added to the

Message-ID: <87pt7rk6l4.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

When creating a static library with C++ objects on IRIX, you're
supposed to use 'CC -ar -o lib.a' instead or 'ar cr lib.a'.  Otherwise
the library objects are not "prelinked", which means that templates
used just in the library do not get instantiated, and the build fails
on undefined symbols.

For my build I fixed this by putting in suitable definitions for AR
and AFLAGS in lcdf-typetools/{libefont,liblcdf}/Makefile after
configure had run.

It looks like current libtool gets this right, so completely
libtoolizing lcdf-typetools is probably a better fix.

Yes. When you run texconfig for the first time it makes the whole
texmf-local tree and copy here config files. I'd love if texconfig
can make the local tree as an option...

oops, sorry didn't know that. Simple solution is to use either your
pdf(e)tex.min or pregenerated pdf(e)tex.man delivered together with the
.m4 source. But the .man is already outdated e. g. regarding .efmt, and
pdfetex.man should mention also Petr Olsak. What would you prefer:
Either use yours, or I would try (this week) to combine your with my
cruft :-) version? (just to avoid double work)

Best Regards

At present, I'd probably prefer the use of my manual pages (I'll
update the .min ones to what they are in the web2c sources).  But I'd
appreciate it if you'd look them over and let me know whether changes
need to be made.

If you run with `-sync', does it abort and does the core show the
call that's causing the problem? What's the output of xdpyinfo?
Does running with `-expertmode 20' cause the error too?
Otherwise, what's the output of xwininfo for the xdvi window?

I had a bug report about this before on Solaris but the user
wasn't able to track it down. It works for me on XFree/Linux.

Building on IRIX outside the source tree I get all kinds of weird
failures if I try to use either 'make' or 'smake'.  For better or
worse, it looks like TeX-live effectively requires GNU make to
build.

I am not surprised. Does it really matter? is it worth working around? 
I'd say not.

I want to define a really mininal TeX setup. You know what that means, 
just the pdftex engine, metapost, Type1 fonts only, etc.
My current "minimal" setup clocks in at 96 megabytes, which is ridiculous!

I wonder what people feel about breaking the "cm" package in two, so 
that the Metafont sources
are a separate package (which I can omit)? would that cause howls of 
protest? or shall I not have "cm"
at all, and just have "lmodern"?

Realistically, are .afm files ever used these days by normal users? I 
mean the .afm files
for cm, lmodern etc

Fabrice, all the packages like lib-png and lib-zlib, are they used by 
pdftex?

Sebastian

PS why do I want this? because I maintain a Knoppix customization. I'd 
quite like a basic
TeX on there (it's been banished from the normal Knoppix), but I have 
very little space to spare.

As a general rule, I do not want to depend on the GNU-specific
versions of tools to be able to build stuff (like GNU m4, GNU sed,
bash, etc...).

However, I make an exception for GNU make because working around all
variations of brokeness in all variations of make in all variations of
building source to just too much.

I'm not sure I understand: if you don't have metafont there, were are
there metafont sources at all in your minimalistic tree?

It seems to me that the people who'd need afm files would be able to

I have set up a cron job that runs nightly at 03:13 Denmark time, from
the same checkout (/home/tlprod on tug.org) which is accessible in other
ways.  It rebuilds the TPM files, Unix installer list files, mktexlsr,
and then makes the ISO images.

The script is Master/Tools/tlrebuild.  It calls various others.

If anyone notices problems, let me know.

I see no harm in it.

    or shall I not have "cm" at all, and just have "lmodern"?

You still have to have cm, or basically no existing documents will be
processable.  LM is not a drop-in replacement for CM.  It doesn't
have a cmr10.tfm, for instance, and anyway the metrics are slightly
different (and better).

    Realistically, are .afm files ever used these days by normal users?
    I mean the .afm files for cm, lmodern etc

I can't imagine why.  I don't ever use them, at least.

By the way, note that on this system (an O2) the default visual ID is
8 bits PseudoColor, the visual id of the root window is also 8 bits
PseudoColor, but differs from the default, and xdvi-motif ends up
using a 24 bits TrueColor visual.  All of which is perfectly proper
and reasonable for this type of box, but can play havoc with
applications that are even the slightest bit sloppy in this area.

People would have to use the LM fonts explicitly. I agree, it'd be a 
pain not to be able to run
"pdflatex sample2e" as is.

trouble is, splitting eg "lm" into the daily use part and the "source" 
part (ie afm) makes
package management and the relationship with the upstream source 
problematic. I suppose
I can assume Knuth doesn't care how I package CM

they'd just have to install a more complete scheme from TL. I want to 
regard TL as the backup resource from
which I can derive subsets, and point people at the master.

Can we agree to support standard "make" (whatever this may be) for
building inside the source tree as well?

fyi: such a minimal tree for context contains around 40 Meg (without 
binaries, e.g. linux binaries take some 2.5 M)

sounds right to me, if you want a quick and dirty replacement for 
plr/csr/aer, you can remap those onto lm in map files (good enough for 
single language purposes)

eh ... this is not true. it does not need a cmr10.tfm because all you 
need to do is to change the lines in your map files

the metrics are taken from the good old cmr10.tfm  (but other 
afm's/tfm's may provide better ones; same for kerning and such); in 
principle we can drop cmr10.pfb; we only need to keep the math fonts

You may be mixing Motif versions.  If you have the feature stream
or the 6.5.22 merged stream you probably have:

$ versions | grep 'Motif.*Combined'
I motif_eoe 04/30/2004 IRIX IM Execution Software (Motif 1.2 and 2.1 
Combined) for 6.5.22

I got xdvi-motif.bin to run (it seems to display files OK, but dumps
core if I choose "cancel" without selecting a file, so is a bit fragile)
for teTeX-3beta using:

CC='c99 -mips4 -g -O2 -D_BSD_COMPAT -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500' \
CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/freeware/include -I/usr/Motif-2.1/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/freeware/lib32 -rpath /usr/local/lib:/usr/freeware/lib32" \
./configure  --prefix=/opt/tex/tetex-3

I used c99 mainly to try and break things -- -D_BSD_COMPAT is needed to 
get select for X.

This error resulted from the different color depths of the root
window and the xdvi window, as indicated by Olaf; I'm currently
working on a patch.

Olaf got this one too - do you have `nm' on IRIX? If so, what's
the output of
$ nm xdvi-motif.bin | grep XtAppAddTimeOut
?

This bug may have been fixed in 22.84; tetex-beta/TeXLive is
still at 22.82, we'll need to think about how/when to update
it when the visual bug is fixed.

Why should you be different? So many apps have the "visula bug" that just 
last week I finally gave up fighting it and set my root window to a 
truecolor visual.  Xdvi-motif worked before I made the change, but many 
other apps that use low-level Xt calls did not.

Sorry for perhaps silly questions...
I still cannot catch how things can be and should be done.
An example: I updated finally kpsereadlink for i386-linux
and also updated man pages (eg removed readlink.1 and added 
kpsereadlink.1, some other man pages were also added). As I can see,
running existing scripts automatically cannot resolve such situation
(eg lists/bin-kpathsea still doesn't contain kpsereadlink.1, so in 
consequence it cannot be installed). Questions:
1. should I touch tmp files by hand (eg remove readlink.1 and add 
kpsereadlink.1); there are no "patterns" for such things.
2. can we have a recipe what to do if some files dissapear from
the package and some other are added?

    Sorry for perhaps silly questions...

It's not silly.

    (eg lists/bin-kpathsea still doesn't contain kpsereadlink.1, so in 
    consequence it cannot be installed). 

The lists files are 100% generated from the tpm's.

    1. should I touch tmp files by hand (eg remove readlink.1 and add 
    kpsereadlink.1); there are no "patterns" for such things.

What tmp files?  You mean the lists files?  The right thing to do is
edit the tpms, then run update-lists.

If that's too slow/annoying, you can just edit the lists files, but
they'll get overwritten by the nightly build, so the tpm's have to be
changed as well.

    2. can we have a recipe what to do if some files dissapear from
    the package and some other are added?

Assuming you're talking about packages in texmf, then you do still have
to edit texmf/tpm/whatever.tpm (bin-kpathsea.tpm in this case), adding
or removing pattern entries and file entries.

Then, you can run tpm-check to check the consistency of patterns with
 files with the actual checked-out tree.
Then update-tpm to regenerate the tpm's (run until its output is silent,
 might take 4 iterations).
Then update-lists to regenerate the lists files.

None of these will do p4 submit's, you still have to do that.

This process is exactly what the tlrebuild script does (plus the submit).

Does that help?  (BTW, I wrote some of this (even more tersely) in
tools/README, FWIW.)

the TPM files for the binaries (the "TLCore" package)
have to updated  by hand in the patterns section,
as they are not rebuilt in auto mode. so "kpsereadlink"
had to be added explicitly. I hope thats OK now.
I suspect the same is true of the man pages

I can try to make the scheme more flexible in the following way:
  - formats will always and up in VARTEXMF if this is set, else in TEXMFMAIN
    (I think that we all agree on this)
  - config files are no longer copied automatically; I make this a step that
    the user (or the installation procedure) has to take explicitly
  - I introduce a special variable TEXMFCONFIG (argh, this is close to
    TEXMFCNF and TEXCONFIG...), so people are not forced to use
    either TEXMFLOCAL or VARTEXMF for this. TeX Live's setup can use
    TEXMFCONFIG=$VARTEXMF is this is what everybody wants.

Sounds good?

That describes the ideas in a good way. I see a different quality of
config files and format files ending in some tree. Some user might want to
keep the locally changed config files but also to replace the format files
when upgrading (or when sharing files accross multiple installations).

That's why I have suggested that I make texconfig aware of this situation
and to let it support these two concepts. Then, the decision to make
it one way or the other becomes con simple change in the configuration
rather than a script rewrite. I don't even mind if TeX Live's default
setup is different from teTeX's.

Personally, I don't see a problem if there a a few
prefix/share/texmf-something trees as long as it is clear what goes
where...

I can't do any serious work to texconfig in the next two weeks. So, it
would be good if that part of the documentation can be deferred until
we know what we want...

the right thing there (at least this year). I think that this question
has to be answered for each system separately.

Hi all,

I have just tried to install texlive2004 both from
the CD and from the DVD images dated 2004/06/25.

When I install from the DVD, *no binaries at all are installed*
the platform (i386-linux) is detected properly though.
A friend of mine reported to me that he had the same problem
installing TL2003 from the DVD... only the CD-inst installation
worked for him.

The installation ends with this:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Testing for /usr/local/TeX/TL2004/bin//texconfig....

See ./index.html for links to documentation.
The TeX Live web site (http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
will contain any updates and corrections.

Welcome to TeX Live!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Nothing tells the user that the installation failed in fact!
When the check for 'texconfig' fails, an error message
should be issued to tell the user that the installation failed
(OK, this case should never occur but ;-), "Welcome to TeX Live!"
is very misleading.

Let me point out another strange thing occuring only with the DVD
image, 
under the root directory (/usr/local/TeX/TL2004 for me) I have only
3 directories:  texmf, texmf-var and xemtex

With the CD installation (GUTengerg scheme, same options), I get
  bin, texmf, texmf-dist, texmf-doc, texmf-var and xemtex
which is normal... except for xemtex I did not ask for installation.

Stuff going (this year) to texmf-dist, appears in texmf (as in the
2003 edition) when the installation is done from the TL2004 DVD.

I guess you're right. FWIW, I just released xdvik-22.84.1 that
should fix the bugs reported. AFAIK TeXLive is still at 22.82, it
would be great if somebody with perforce access could update the
repository (recompiling will be needed too ...)

Best,
Stefan

I have: Testing for /usr/local/TeX/TL2004/bin/i386-linux/texconfig
Have you selected also other binaries for installing?

For GUTenberg scheme I have also texmf-dist, texmf-doc and texmf-local
For "TL live" only failed building map files in texmf-var/

It contains only some man pages for cjpeg, libpng and png, etc.

I have only (already reported) problem with "TL inst": since it doesn't 
contain kpathsea.zip, some config files cannot be installed.
I don't know why generic bin-kpathsea, etc. packages aren't ziped.
Only have platform dependent stuff (eg. bin-kpathsea-i386-linux.zip
etc.

No, just i386-linux.
I have performed the installation again, this time with the standard
scheme, and still get no binary installed when I use the DVD image.
The CD image works for me (except for the map problems already
reported), with the CD
image the binaries are installed.

My system is Debian (sarge). Here is what I do and what
I see on the screen:

root# unset TEXMFCNF
root# echo $PATH
/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/
bin

Note: /usr/sbin/texconfig exists (tetex is part of my Debian distrib).

As you can see above, the installation process claims that binaries

      - formats will always and up in VARTEXMF if this is set, else in
      TEXMFMAIN (I think that we all agree on this)

Yes.

      - config files are no longer copied automatically; I make this a
      step that the user (or the installation procedure) has to take
      explicitly

Ok, I guess.

      - I introduce a special variable TEXMFCONFIG (argh, this is close to
        TEXMFCNF and TEXCONFIG...), so people are not forced to use
        either TEXMFLOCAL or VARTEXMF for this. TeX Live's setup can use
        TEXMFCONFIG=$VARTEXMF is this is what everybody wants.

That sounds fine, but it would be even better if teTeX and TeX Live do
the same thing.  Would you be willing to have teTeX use VARTEXMF by
default also?

I can agree that "some users" might find it useful to keep the locally
changed config files, if they hand-edited them, but I think this is far,
far, less common than just installing the package, running texconfig,
and that's it, never hand-editing anything.

If the config file tree is settable from the cmd line, one way or
another, as I assume it will be, then users (or TL's install scripts)
can conveniently override the default, in any case, and we can document
the possibilities.

Thanks,
k

the problem is here - no binaries detected at all on the DVD! this means

Thanks, it now works well. Only missing
texmf-var/dvipdfm/config/config
texmf-var/dvips/config/config.ps
texmf-var/web2c/mktex.cnf

What can be wrong with preparing "inst" (missing some compressed
packages)?

I think this is what I want in TL. When we install, we set things up 
right, and
can then call texconfig safely, knowing that it will not duplicate our work.

In fact, I have commented out the call to texconfig  from the install 
scripts entirely, for the
moment.  It is not clear to me that it did anything useful at that point.

It's updated nightly.

Thanks, it works. Only some warnings:
cannot stat `/mnt/cdrom/texmf-dist/dvipdfm/config/config ...
cannot stat `/mnt/cdrom/texmf-dist/web2c/mktex.cnf ...
cannot stat `/mnt/cdrom/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg ...

but those files are well placed in texmf-var/
Seems that we need 2 more files copied to texmf-var/:
tex/context/config/cont-usr.tex
tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
both are in fact configuration files to be modified by the user.

No trouble there: it seems xpdf makes no use of templates, and this
prelinking is a required for template instantiation.

The bin directory on the DVD image is not empty, all the subdirs,
including i386-linux, are there and hold over 50 binaries.
But the bin directory on the disk is not created at all.

Hmm... I'd like to find a good compromise for both teTeX and TL. Since
teTeX hasn't installation script, may I suggest adding to texconfig one
more item: "copy config files" to whatever was in advance set as
TEXMFCONFIG (as Thomas suggested). In such a way we can avoid any action
"behind the scene". Making such a copy of config files would be
appreciated by teTeX users.

That's OK, but the first run of texconfig still makes copies in
TEXMFLOCAL. Fortunatelly language.dat, fmtutil.cnf etc. are edited in
VARTEXMF, thanks to the precedance of texmf- trees.

Hope we are more close to any consent. Thanks,

could texconfig only copy files to LOCAL if they cannot be found in VAR?

    could texconfig only copy files to LOCAL if they cannot be found in VAR?

I'm not sure texconfig's action should depend on what previously exists.
That hasn't been suggested before.

To reiterate my own suggestion: (1) as Thomas proposed, make the target
directory for the copy be a variable, choosable at runtime (I mean,
without having to edit the script), and (2) make the default target, for
both teTeX and TeX Live, be texmf-var.

Unfortunately there had been a misunderstanding between Olaf and
me as to whether the changes had been tested on IRIX.  We're
currently sorting it out via email and there will be a new

I've compared scheme-basic.scheme and scheme-minimal.scheme
(btw why we need ".scheme" suffix in lists/ ? ;-).
It could be somehow missleading for the user.
scheme-minimal contains e.g. metapost, but without base macros even .mem
cannot be made.

When removing from the scheme-basic collection-doc-english (and
collection-context), we can have quite the same result as for
scheme-minimal, but more complete and working. Anyway such setup can be
used only for English documents, so it should be stated in description
field and in the documentation.

so, please, help me correct it. what package has base MP macros?

because of hyphenation, you mean? thats true of "basic" too

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406301556351.2731-100000@einstein.homenet>

Hello,

I am curious if there is a working TeX Live distribution compiled for 
x86_64 architecture? I asked Sebastian this directly but I understand 
(from reading tex-live archives) that he is extremely busy, so I thought I 
should ask this question here, perhaps someone knows.

I see there is a tetex distribution compiled for x86_64 as included in 
Fedora Core 2, but, as was usual the case with Red Hat, the version 
included is very old, so I would rather use even the 32bit TeX Live 2003 
instead of the native x86_64 old version included in Fedora. But, 
obviously, much better option is to run the native x86_64 TeX Live...

Kind regards
Tigran

Hi Sebastian,

Yes, I have checked my inbox again and there was no reply from you, so it
may have been delayed by the provider (it happens from time to time to
me). I may still get in the next couple of days :)

Thank you, I will follow your suggestion and let you know if I have any

Not yet, probably because nobody has a machine. Could you provide
binaries?

I also doubt that any of the programs in TL will benefit from
64bit; many are not even 16bit proper. :-)

it may even be worse because tex leaves much of the 32/64 bits unused and allocates most of its mem in advance; on the other hand, graphic inclusion in pdftex and the other c-only code (fonts) may benefit from more power.

And from more mem. It's probably possible to have graphics
inclusion in pdfTeX where pdfTeX needs more than 4G. But I doubt
that we'll see those cases in the wild in the near future. :-)

Then Build complains about not finding texmf tree. Should I sync with the 
Master/texmf one? (but then I will presumably need to point to it somehow, 
since it is outside source.development directory?)

Do I need anything else for successful Build? (other than a normal C
development environment obviously)

If I waste your time with these questions, maybe there is some README I 
should read, for newbies who try to compile TeX Live?

(as a test exercise I decided to build it on normal IA-32 Linux 2.4.26 
machine, to make sure everything compiles OK, before I copy the sources to 
x86_64 and compile them there).

Kind regards

Subject: [tex-live] Timeline graphic for TeX and TeX-based/inspired systems?
Message-ID: <1088615942.1527.156.camel@pc118>

Is there a timeline graphic for TeX and TeX-based/inspired systems (and
perhaps contributed components?), along the lines of the (normally
vertical) timelines for Unix-derived systems that one sometimes sees
(e.g. ?ric L?v?nez's http://www.levenex.com/unix/)? Many such systems
are included in TeXLive, of course, and I think something like this
would be a useful aid for beginning users to help them understand how
the particular system they are using fits into the TeX world. Perhaps
systems (such as Omega) would be distinguished from formats (such as
LaTeX). Might formats, contributions of fonts etc, be shown as lines
merging into a line representing a system, and new systems as lines
diverging from the parent system line?

I might draw up an initial draft (for comment) of such a timeline if
there isn't already one - except that I'm about to go on holiday for two
weeks, so someone can beat me to it. Also. I'm not a real TeX expert,
despite many years of using TeX and associated systems! What notation
would be most suitable? ?ric L?v?nez uses FrameMaker on NeXTSTEP
(http://www.levenez.com/gen/build.html).

I'm not putting myself foward as a qualified volunteer for such a
project, mind you!

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with \usepackage{mathbbol} - bug?
Message-ID: <1088618313.1527.183.camel@pc118>

Someone here reported a Metafont problem with this small LaTeX source
file when given as input to latex(1) from TeXLive 200309 being run on
Slackware Linux 9.0:

\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}
\usepackage{mathbbol}

$\mathbb{[]}$

The problem can be reproduced with Metafont on its own:

$ mf
** \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; input bbold11

The problem doesn't happen with latex or mf from tetex 2.0.2 as
distributed with Slackware 9.0.
