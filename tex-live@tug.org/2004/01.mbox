Well, there is no diffrence between what you have sugested and
  .;$TEXMF/metapost//
as long as the file names below metapost// are unique. Let's better try
to keep using unique filenames rather than introducing complicated search
paths without any need.

Donald Arseneau <asnd@triumf.ca> responded to a problem report with
url.sty version 1.5:

>> Please upgrade

OK.

There are two versions of url.sty in the CTAN tree, one new, and one old:

-r--r--r--  1 mirror mirror 20460 Nov 25 19:45 tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty
-r--r--r--  1 mirror mirror 12674 Jan 24  1997 tex-archive/support/ltx2x/url.sty

They are versions 3.0 and 1.1 respectively.

I'll replace our installed version 1.5 with the 3.0.

On the TeXLive 9/2003 DVD, there are three versions, all out-of-date:

==> /cdrom/dvd/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty <==
% url.sty  ver 1.5    28-Mar-1999   Donald Arseneau   asnd@triumf.ca

That's why I suggested to install IE4.0 : it updates much more than
winsock. So that's fixed.

The log file is created only once the copying occur. If something fails
before I must admit that many cases of failure are not reported.

Yes, at least 95 and 98. It wasn't reported clearly before, but I can
agree on the diagnosis. No idea if a workaround is possible
however. Next installer will be MSI based (the M$ installer platform).

Lately I removed a few dependencies of xemacs on functions that are not
used and found only in recent versions of dlls. You need to do the
upgrade to get the most recent version of xemacs. I fixed it at least
for NT4.0, I haven't tried it under w95.

To be sure, I ran a make distclean in the Build/source directory and

I'd like to propose the following rough schedule for TeX Live in 2004.

>From the point of view of our members, it would be *so* wonderful if we
could get the final discs out in summer.  So I picked 6/30 for a final
date, as something to shoot for.

6/30 - send final images to production
5/30 - start producing cover art (klaus)
5/30 - start ctan/dvd building (manfred) (not freezing the final
       versions, of course, just revving up the infrastructure)
4/15 - finish english doc (karl),
       thus start doc translations in earnest (doc workers)
3/15 - major development done (significant new features, etc.),
       thus start qa in earnest (besides Staszek, push people who reported bugs
                                 this year to test in *advance* next year)
       Then the next couple months can be devoted to stability and bug fixes.

Reactions?

I'll try, but I have no ETA for PDF 1.5 (I'm counting on xpdf to

What was broken? I am at the point of buildling an upgrade and since

Thanks, Karl. The schedule sounds fine and reasonable to me. it all depends
on whether Fabrice thinks so too, of course!

the schedules sort of 'happened', thanks to Sebastian's knowledge of

so having a sharp schedule this year seems like a very good idea.

Message-ID: <20040104202501.GC6226@fute.lan>

Hello, 

I searched through the ML archives if anyone thought about jigdo 
[ http://atterer.net/jigdo/ ] to download the various .iso files. I
didn't find any mails about it. 

So I asked myself : why not ?

Since TeX-Live is mostly assembling files which are also available from
the various CTAN servers, it make IMHO a very good candidate of this way
to download ISOs. 

I'm looking forward any advice, I trying to have enough disk space to
make a .jido & .template to serve as a proof of concept.

TL is a _lot_ more complicated than downloading files from CTAN. A 
typical LaTeX macro package,
for instance, is stored on CTAN as one .dtx file and one .sty file. 
These have to be processed,
and the resulting files placed in the right places in a hierarchy. 
Documentation files are run to PDF,
font metrics are created etc. And that's just for a simple package... 

So using jigdo to talk to CTAN would not work. However, it might work as 
a distribution mechanism
from the copy of the TeX Live master tree on tug.org.

To be honest, I don't really understand what jigdo is doing after a 
quick read of the web page, and the dark green background makes it too 
hard work for now :-} But if you'd like to demonstrate how it might 
work, and have space
on your server to make an experiment (the master is currently 1.19 
Gbytes), I could show you how to grab a copy
of TL and keep in sync with it.

Ah .. tex driving disks and processors crazy .. this should go somewhere in

   we have reports of crashing disks and overheated chipset .... you cannot

TeXLive as a new kind of virus!

My understanding of jigdo ist that instead of for instance downloading one fat 
(in our case 1.19 GB  file ) it enables you to downloading the contents of 
the big iso file, i.e. the files of the cd image themselves.  jigdo is able 
to assemble the stuff on your local harddisk and to keep track about the 
progress.  

This way jigdo can easily resume a download. I don't know what is actually 
required to be done on the server's side.

since bachotek (early may) is a moment when a lot of texies meet, that's 
probbably a good moment to bring documentation in sync

another sync moment can be the febr/march dante meeting, e.g. major 
decisions about what extras go on the dvd can be discussed live there

Do you mean that they're not identical between CTAN & TL ?

In *very* short : 
You give Jidgo an .iso file and a bunch of files (on a local fs, feedind
jigdo with something like "find -type f"). Since an ISO is somewhat an
aggregate of many files, it tries to find parts of the iso that are also
in the files. That way it only creates a .template with all the ISO
parts that are not contained in files, and a .jigdo where it stores the
path and the offset of the parts that are in files...

So, in *very* short, the more you have unchanged files available via
http or ftp, the smaller the .template.

[ Hope that you can understand what I explained... it's maybe not on a
dark green background, but it's somewhat more mixed-up ;-)) ]

Sure !. Actually, I don't need to have the whole 1.19 TL *online*, just
the .jigdo and the .template :-). They'll point to the master TL
server...

I thought about grabbing it stupidly via mirror(1). Keeping in sync
isn't one of my highest priority... Yet ?...

And thx for your fast reply ;-)

Exactly.

> I don't know what is actually required to be done on the server's side.

You only need to generate the 2 jigdo files : 
- .jigdo [ contains metadata : URLs, offsets, md5, etc ]
- .template [ zipped, contains everything that isn't in the .jigdo ]
Then, you only need to make the 2 files available [ and maybe distribute 
the .jigdo URL ;-) ]

CTAN is available via rsync(1). _Much_ better than mirror(1).

rsync is indeed great (although in the case of ctan i wonder what will 
happen if many user start syncing using checksum calculations)

Doesn't it put a _big_ I/O & CPU load on the server ?
And are the file updated or are new files either put on another dir or
in the same dir but with a new name ?

In the latter case (files are not updated), mirror(1) can also do the
trick. Since AFAIK i don't think rsync can correctly handle a renamed
file.

Actually, i'll try to jigdo-ize the TL2003-inst.iso, and I'll see if
it's do-able and if it's interesting.

web2c/pdftexdir/tex.pch and web2c/tex.ch in source were out of
sync (and in sync in source.development). :-(

I fixed it for pdftex. I suspect that the broken tex.ch is the
cause of the problems with Omega.

Did you try a make (dist)clean in between? The Makefiles are not 
reliable with respect to recreating stuff when they should, so you 
might still be compiling old stuff even if you have synced.

No, I did not. However, I have startet in a new and empty build directory.
There is nothing from an old build lying around. To be 100% sure, I'll
redo this after a
  "rm -rf /t/texlive/Build/source; p4 sync -f /t/texlive/Build/source/...".

OK, I did the same thing. Removed the entire source/... tree and 
resynced it (what the use is of a source maintenance system if I have 
to do this to trust the outcome is unclear to me). Note that this may 
mask an actual error in the sources (see below).

A fresh build ends in an error as well:

It seems cweb.c is downloaded but with a time stamp that lets make try 
to remake this read-only file. So I touched cweb.c and went ahead. (the 
same happened to me with source/TeX/texk/cjkutils/hbf2gf/hbf2gf.c)

NOTE:

The fact that I do not have the problem now, corroborates my hunch that 
there *is* something wrong. After all, this way of removing all files 
and resyncing them with p4 gives you not only base files, but it also 
gives you intermediate results (like cweb.c) that are stored in 
perforce. So, you *cannot* be sure that the files you get are actually 
used (there may be a different version of a web file around which is 
not used because the sync ships you a resulting C file with a newer 
time stamp but which is actually older. That is why getting everything 
clean is not really clean. I guess a 'make distclean' is clean, but 
that I am not even certain of (is everything intermediary indeed 
removed?). I have no time now to test the make distclean route (have to 
run), but I know that in the current state of the perforce tree (which 
holds intermediary files) we are never certain we actually use the 
latest modifications. In fact, that I ran into this problem suggests 
that a basic source file was adapted and may contain a problem, but 
that nobody notices it because during a compile, the old intermediary 
file keeps getting used.

So, I still think that with generally fast computers today, there 
should be *no* intermediate files in the source trees.

I have it in my source.development tree. I intend to upload a couple of
patches to the source tree quite soon. It may end up there if it is not
yet available.

Mostly win32 related.

texmf.cnf :
I had to add the 'map' subdirectory to fonts/{enc,type1} in TEXPSHEADERS
else pdftex does not want to find pdftex.map anymore.

I have fixed all the tpm files. On TL2003, unfortunately the Date field
is meaningless for many of them. Now, it should state the date of the
most recent file in the package.

New win32 binaries. I have fixed an issue with spaces in pathnames in
tex engines. With TL2003, if you run :
tex -ini "\input tex.ini"
then you end up with a Program.fmt format file (parsing the full path
name will stop at first space). On the other hand you
get tex.fmt if you use :
tex -ini tex.ini
or
tex -ini -jobname=tex "\input tex.ini"
It should give the right name in all cases by now.

I have upgraded xemacs to the latest beta (but actually stable enough, I
use it 7/7days).

Greetings,

Not for me. Do you use the right options to preserve the timestamps as
they are on the server? Do you have acurate time on your local machine?
Do you use nfs for storing the files?

That is a bug. cweb.c should not be there. The file usually gets removed
by a "make clean".

hbf2gf.c gets removed by "make distclean". It is a bug that the file
exists in the perforce repository.

I think that we can solve this by the following "rule": never add files
to p4 before "make distclean".

For teTeX, I always build outside the source directory. A following
"make distclean" must remove every file, so that only directories are
left. I do check this for every teTeX release.

Maybe, for TeX Live, more checking by the developers is needed. We have
to ensure, that
  touch foo; ./configure; make; make distclean; find . -newer foo -type f
gives empty output in the find-run. That's easy enough to check...

I am cleaning up source.development now, to try and get this right once 
and for all. I suggest
we not worry about "source" for now, but work on getting 
"source.development" in trim

Martin, do you want take the development pdftex out of beta now, so we 
can make a clean
start?

The 1.11c we now have is just 1.11b minus two or three typos. I
don't want to release that. :-)

If you want you can take the beta and move it to source (as a
beta). The problem I fixed in source is in tex.pch

I can now check out source.development, build it end to end with all 
files read-only,
do a "make distclean" and then build again successfully. Maybe you could 
try, Gerben?
If that is OK, I am inclined to base future work on this tree, and not 
worry about current "source"
now.

I am also inclined, in a week or two, to put this tree into CVS on Berlios,
and keep Perforce only for the Master tree.

Has the move to Berlios been discussed somewhere? Because I
strongly disagree with it. We _should_ move to something like
Sourceforge, but Berlios offers much too few services. 

The options for Open Source software development web sites
(OSSDWS) I know of are
- sourceforge.net
  the first and the largest. Also offers the most services.
  Licenses must be OSI-certified, which (now) rules out LPPL. Run
  by a corporation (VA Software). Integrated with OSDN
  (freshmeat, slashdot, newsforge).
- savannah.gnu.org
  sourceforge done by GNU. Some minor technical differences.
  Licenses must be OSI-certified, which (now) rules out LPPL.
- sarovar.org
  OSSDWS run by TUGIndia with a completely different software
  than sourceforge and savannah. Offers fewer services (e.g. no
  web interface to CVS). No problems with licenses.
- berlios
  uncertain future and few services (e.g. no way to get mail
  about new bugs). No problem with licenses. Located in Germany.
- doing it ourself (DANTE & TUG)
  failed because of manpower shortage

I will investigate this in more depth (in time for DANTE
Darmstadt), but I didn't know that TL is moving now.

For now my favourite is sourceforge, simply because it's the
largest and offers the most services.

    Has the move to Berlios been discussed somewhere? 

I mentioned it in private email to a few people, including Sebastian.

I didn't mention it on the list yet because I thought -- and still think
-- it is premature to consider moving to CVS.  We have to move the
sources and make sure things still work for the principal p4 users
before we can say we "have moved".  In other words, no decision has been
made, at least to my mind.

However, now that it's been brought up, I will write a separate message
with my thoughts on the matter.

sourceforge didnt reply to Karl when he applied, I think. Also, the LPPL 
thing license rules
out using it for the texmf tree, right?

by the way, is there now a definitive statement from somewhere saying 
that LPPL
is ruled out? I

Can I add the pdftex patches by Hartmut Henkel for a faster access to
dictionaries using avl trees  to source.development ? It speeds up
pdftex quite a lot.

For the record, see also
http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/versions/exhost_diff_0.03_0.02.htm,
although you've listed all the principal hosting providers.

We (mainly Sebastian and I) felt sourceforge, savannah, and sarovar
would not work because, principally, they are too far away.  Almost all
the principal TL developers are in Europe.  (I have other issues with
all three, but I won't bother enumerating them.)  

Doing it ourselves is out because, as you say, we don't even have time
to do a bang-up job with TL, let alone developing a whole hosting
infrastructure.  We will just keep limping along as we are if we do
nothing else.

I asked sunsite.dk, but they didn't respond for a month, and anyway upon
reflection they offered almost no standard services.  More geared
towards special-case projects.  (Sebastian, I never asked sourceforge; I
asked sunsite.dk.)

That leaves berlios.  I was not aware they had an "uncertain" future.
Is there a definite death date or something?  When I looked around on
the net, they seemed no more uncertain than anything else.

Anyway, I've used berlios since the savannah crack for Texinfo.  They
have their share of problems, but they approved the project right away
and have been fairly responsive to my various support requests.

They also approved a texlive project.
  http://developer.berlios.de/projects/texlive/
I've just been playing around with it -- put the schedule into their
"task manager", and have been putting a few bugs in.  I've been getting
email with new or changed bugs, so perhaps they fixed the problem you
noted.

If anyone wants to bother to create an account at berlios for further
testing, obviously Seb or I will set up developer permissions or
whatever.


Anyway, as I said before, I think moving the sources to cvs needs
testing, which Seb or I will try to pursue.  But I see no particular
harm in using berlios for the infrastructure stuff it provides.

Please. I have a project at Berlios and will investigate the

Ask Frank. :-)
AFAIK the new version of the LPPL (to be released RSN) is
approved by debian-legal. The next step would be to get it
OSI-certified. THEN we could move texmf to sourceforge or
savannah. source is probably not a problem anywhere.

See above. Savannah is realy sourceforge done by GNU/FSF. Even
more troubels with licenses, slightly less services.

Ping it. It's hosted at an ISP, so it's fast enough. And you have
millions of potential developers near it. :-)

Good question. They got public funding to start it (the idea was
to have an OSSDWS? and promote OSS in Germany), but the funding
has run out.

We are using it, but improvements are impossible. I asked for
something like syncmail and viewcvs and after months was told
that neither Rainer nor Reinhard have the time for it. My problem
is not p4 (which is fine), but support.

I feel sure that the revised LPPL will be ok, when Frank releases the
new LaTeX.  Even Debian is ok with it.

However, I think sourceforge will be problematic from Europe.  I also
find it very troublesome philosophically, but that's a different story.

    so we cant use that either?

We don't want to use savannah.  Ignoring any licensing issues, I doubt
they can support a multi-gigabyte project, and their hardware (or maybe
it's their net connection) is relatively slow.

    its using Perforce. We could just switch to CVS on sun.dante.de.

1) When the p4 license expires (which is when ...?), are you going to be
able to get a renewal?  If that is so, it is news to me, and makes
switching to CVS (or something) imperative, not just "worth testing".

2) I see no win to doing cvs on sun.dante.de.  If we go to the pain of
   switching to cvs, we might as well use berlios and get all the
   web-cvs stuff for free.  If berlios dies (or gets cracked or
   whatever), we can put the tree somewhere else then.

We can sit around debating forever.  It's already set up at berlios.  If
anyone has time to experiment, let's experiment there, and not to try to
make final decisions in a vacuum.

Yes. But can we postpone that decision for at least 48 hours? I
want to have a look at the patch first.

IMHO the problem with sf and savannah are the licenses for texmf;
and for sarovar the location (it's slower) and the interface.

It's just manpower. Technically it's not a problem -- get a
hosting somewhere. But the manpower is the showstopper.

Me neither. I just didn't know the background of the decision.

Moving to CVS will be a lot of work. :-(

At my end, work on kpse is taking precedence.  If it looks like that
cannot be finished in time, that will be suspended to make room for
things like encTeX.

I can vouch for sarovar.org.  If you want additional servers,
services, TUGIndia can provide it.  As Martin told, it is hosted at an
ISP which is hardly a km away from my work.

Were we also going to revisit cp8bit.tcx and 8-bit mapping in general?
Are there outstanding problems we need to devise a better solution to?

I just fixed that.

Makefile.in, config.h.in, configure must not be taken out, since we can't
assume that users have autoconf installed. If you get modifications on
these files, it means that autoconf has been run, which should not be.

Timestamps again... I think that I have fixed that by change #4235:

  touch /tmp/foo
  p4 edit /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/t1utils/configure
  rm -rf /build/X; mkdir -p /build/X; cd /build/X
  /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/t1utils/configure; make   # this calls automake
  rm -rf /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/t1utils/autom4te.cache
  find /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/t1utils -type f -newer /tmp/foo | xargs p4 edit
  p4 submit     # change #4235

Sebastian, maybe, you should change Build:

  rm -rf build; mkdir build; cd build;
  ../configure --prefix=`pwd` --datadir=`pwd` --enable-multiplatform &&
    make world 

That way, build results will all be in a directory of their own... This
requires GNU make, I think, but I thing that this is no real matter for
TL developers.

As I noted in another mail, I'm currently preoccupied with kpse, and
being rather small-minded I can handle only one such preoccupation at
a time.

Well, that's a bug in pdftex, then. pdftex should have used
kpse_dvips_config_format, not the kpse_tex_ps_header_format for accessing
the map files. It only worked, because both search paths have been so
similar (and both searched below texmf/dvips//). If we fix it now,
we'll of course change that to kpse_fontmap_format.

Ok, since this mail goes to the texlive list, I tell the full story now:

TDS-1.0 has introduced new locations for fontmap files (*.map) and font
encoding files (*.enc). Their proper place is below texmf/fonts/map
and texmf/fonts/enc. These files have been retrieved by the formats
kpse_dvips_config_format (map files for dvips, gsftopk, updmap, mktexpk,
...), kpse_fontmap_format (texmf/fontname files used by tex and dvi
drivers) and kpse_tex_ps_header_format (enc files by dvips, pdftex,
gsftopk, ...).

The search paths in texmf.cnf have been adjusted to look at the new
locations, too, so all correct applications should continue to work.

Additionally, we have set up new kpathsea formats:
  kpse_enc_format        for font encoding files
  kpse_cmap_format       for CMap files (e.g. needed by dvipdfmx)
  kpse_sfd_format        for subfont definition files (e.g. needed by dvipdfmx)
  kpse_opentype_format   for opentype fonts

  kpse_fontmap_format    not really new, but files will be rearranged
                         in the texmf tree, so that *all* map files (not
                         only the files from the fontname distribution)
                         can (and should!) be accessed by this format

kpathsea based applications that access map / enc files should be changed
to use the new formats kpse_fontmap_format and kpse_enc_format instead
of kpse_dvips_config_format / kpse_tex_ps_header_format.

I know that dvips uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for everything that is
downloaded to the output file, so it might not be easy to use different
formats for prologues, enconding files and type 1 fonts. This means,
that the kpse_tex_ps_header_format will be messy for some time(*) or
even forever. On the other hand, I think that we can change all access
to map files quite easily (even in dvips), so that kpse_fontmap_format
will sonn be the only format used to access fontmap files. Then, we can
change TEXCONFIG to .;$TEXMF/dvips//.

Thomas

(*) messy in the sense that it is used for (at least) three different kind
of files and three different places: texmf/dvips//, texmf/fonts/type1//,
texmf/fonts/enc//.

Donald Arseneau <asnd@triumf.ca> responded to a problem report with
url.sty version 1.5:

>> Please upgrade

OK.

There are two versions of url.sty in the CTAN tree, one new, and one old:

-r--r--r--  1 mirror mirror 20460 Nov 25 19:45 tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty
-r--r--r--  1 mirror mirror 12674 Jan 24  1997 tex-archive/support/ltx2x/url.sty

They are versions 3.0 and 1.1 respectively.

I'll replace our installed version 1.5 with the 3.0.

On the TeXLive 9/2003 DVD, there are three versions, all out-of-date:

==> /cdrom/dvd/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty <==

There is, of course, a lot to say for using sarovar.org, since it is run 
by friends.

Maybe Karl and Martin between them can draw up a list of features we 
really do need,
and check whether Sarovar could supply?

It would be interesting to put our source tree into CVS in India and 
Germany,
and see whether the response from England, France and the USA is acceptable.

I am assuming, by the way, that this switch to CVS would _not_ include 
history, for the
source tree at least. The Perforce stuff would remain readable into the 
foreseeable future,
if needed.

The license is always a year at a time. it expires in March; but I 
assume they'll give us another one.
However, they can pull the plug any time they feel like it.

I want to move to a sourceforge-like CVS environment for 3 reasons
 *  Perforce may decide to abandon their policy of free licenses
 *  We badly want cheap and easy anonymous checkout
 *  We want the extra facilities

Can we make a slightly more formal list of which facilities we are going 
to use on Berlios, SF, Sarovar, or whatever?
If I check in the source tree into Berlios, which facilities shall we 
play with?

Looks like the usual sf-based thing, bug, support, patches, task mgr,
etc.  Seems fine.

Yes, that is the critical question.

BTW, there's already a TeXLive project sarovar, which I guess cvr
created to hold ISO images.  Its CVS is empty.

    However, they can pull the plug any time they feel like it.

Do you think it would be a good idea to ask them now if they will renew?
I'd rather know now than March.

    If I check in the source tree into Berlios, which facilities shall we 
    play with?

The main "facility" *is* cvs.  If you check in the sources at berlios,
the next question will be if Fabrice, Thomas, et al., can check it out,
if response is ok, etc.  By virtue of checking it in, it will
automatically be visible on the web.

The other facilities, for bug tracking and other mgmt stuff, are
independent of CVS, and we can use them whether or not the sources are
there.  All the hosting providers (except sunsite.dk) have them.

Did you have the impression there was something else magical going to
happen regarding the sources?

how about compile farms?

are there variants on CVS web displayers? any better than others?

can we automate the building of ISO images on the system? or do we 
continue that on tug.org?

if its owned by CVR, maybe he could make me an admin, and I could use it 
for a trial run
with no further admin. If we did a checkin to Berlios and to Sarovar, we 
could compare them
fairly informally for a few weeks.

Not that I see :(.  I think maybe only sourceforge provides that.

    are there variants on CVS web displayers? 

Of course, everyone feels compelled to tweak ...

    any better than others?

Not appreciably, in my experience.  They all do the same basic thing,
the one on berlios seems as good as any to me.

Maybe others know about certain features that are only at some sites.

    can we automate the building of ISO images on the system? or do we 
    continue that on tug.org?

Users get shell accounts (you can log in to shell.berlios.de as rahtz),
so we could do it there if we wish.  I was more or less figuring it
would continue on tug.

True.

No problems. Please register yourself as a user at sarovar and let me
know.

Well, one of the developers of viewcvs is my boss. :-)

It boils down to perl (cvsweb) or python (viewcvs).

isos produce _much_ traffic. That should stay at tug/dante.

Of course. Only fools would try to recreate the p4 history in
cvs.

Let's make a suggestion schedule: any move from perforce to CVS should 
happen immediately after the final release of TL2004. That is when 
sources are cleanest and we will then not mix a production and a move 
operation. During a move, any updates on the sources is out of the 
question.

Secondly, for me in The Netherlands, US sites are generally faster than 
BRD sites (or any other Eu site except The Netherlands).

I never use the Build script, because I need settings that are not 
standard. E.g. I need to disable mkstemps() because otherwise the 
binaries I produce will not work on some earlier versions of Mac OS X. 
Here is a snippet of my main Makefile:

in not using the new functionality, for instance, if no-one uses the 
additional map command syntax, then it behaves like the old method; also, 
between tl releases we're in beta-testing stage anyway

The encTeX patches to web2c version 7.5.2 are ready on my web:
www.olsak.net/enctex.html since March 2003.

It was promised that the next version of web2c will
include encTeX patch in March 2003. I dont know how it is so long.

Many users ask me why the new TeXlive does not include encTeX,
many users on our Czech email-list ask to include encTeX to standard
web2c sources.

For example, to reach tug.org you'd have to go via Stockholm.

I do not care where the source tree repository is at, as long as the speed

We are switching to Subversion from Perforce at work. It has not gone 
well :-}
Basically, Subversion had performance problems (possibly related to 
dbxml), and
landed me in trouble (long story). We hope that new releases will have 
fixed the problems this week.

but we dont have a choice, do we? unless CVR wants to run a Subversion 
sevice on Sarovar.

it is equally arguable that we should start with a clean slate in CVS 
now before real work starts on this year's release...

This isn't exactly a problem, it's a request for
information, namely if you have any concerns about
berlios's long-term viability.  We were hoping berlios
would be a more-or-less permanent home (at least for
the next several years) for TeX Live, but concerns have
been raised that berlios may have to close down.

I know nothing is certain in this life, but are you
reasonably secure at the moment?  Can you allay such fears?

I've looked around on your web site and on the
Internet, but can't find anything recent that seems
especially authoritative.

Thanks.

Basically, I haven't put anything new up since 7.5.2, so in that sense
you're still on track to make the next version.

FYI, I've set up a separate mailing list tldoc@tug.org, since there
were/are so many doc-specific details to discuss that really don't
affect anything else, so I see no reason to inflict them on the whole
list.

I initially subscribed the people I knew who worked on the doc last year:
borisv@lk.net
chlebikj@dcs.fmph.uniba.sk
daniel.flipo@univ-lille1.fr
fabrice.popineau@supelec.fr
karl@freefriends.org
pragma@wxs.nl
sojka@fi.muni.cz
staw@gust.org.pl
volker@dante.de

Of course anyone who's interested is welcome to join (or leave :).


The first thing I plan to do in this regard is see if there are any
(new) volunteers who are interested in translating the doc into more
languages.

Yes, the compile farm is apparently only offered by SourceForge (although
project specific, I'm also involved in the Samba one and its much more extensive).

A quick comparison on the compile farm from for SourceForge and the
current binaries released for TeXLive2003 is as follows:

TeXLive2003
===========
i386-linux (i386 Linux)
powerpc-darwin6.3 (MacOSX)
win32 (32-bit Windows, i.e., 9X and later)
alpha-linux (HP Alpha Linux)
i386-freebsd (i386 FreeBSD)
i386-openbsd (i386 OpenBSD)
i386-solaris (Sun i386 Solaris)
mips-irix (SGI IRIX)
powerpc-aix (IBM RS/6000 AIX)
sparc-solaris (Sun Sparc Solaris)
sparc64-linux (Sparc Linux)

SourceForge Compile Farm
========================

opteron64-linux (AMD64 AMD 64-bit Opteron Linux 2.4 SuSE 8 ES)
powerpc-darwin (PowerPC Apple Mac G4 Mac OS X Mac OS X Server Edition with
Fink)
i386-linux (x86 dual Intel Pentium III Linux 2.4 Red Hat Linux 7.3)
i386-linux (x86 dual Intel Pentium III Linux 2.2 Debian GNU/Linux 2.2)
alpha-linux (Alpha DEC Alpha EV67 Linux 2.2 Debian GNU/Linux 3.0)
sparc64-linux (Sparc64 Sun Ultra 60 Linux 2.4 Debian GNU/Linux 3.0)
sparc-solaris (Sparc Sun Ultra Enterprise R220 Solaris Sun Solaris 8)
strongarm-linux (StrongARM CerfCube SA1110 Linux 2.4 Debian GNU/Linux 3.0)

In other words, the SourceForge compile far would meet only some of the
binary requirements for the current TL2003. While this would be
convenient, it doesn't solve the requirement to ship binaries for quite a
range of platforms we already have some arrangements for.

(BTW: I volunteer to keep a track of binaries for TL2004, hence
my interest in working out which facilities are available)

I have implemented, in changes 4248 to 4259, Thomas' work on 
reorganizing the texmf tree:

  - killed some duplicates
  - *.enc and *.map now in fonts/map//$package and fonts/enc//$package
  - texmf/{omega,pdftex,mltex,etc,pdfetex) all removed where they only 
contain TeX-ish input files, merged into texmf/tex


This is a serious set of changes! It might well have broken something,
so proceed with caution. Don't blindly put this lot in your production 
systems....

Thomas, can you make the simplications to texmf.cnf now?

I can only support Sebastian's statement: "This is a serious set
of changes!". So, please, everybody is welcome to check the new
organization (esp. in texmf/tex; this is where I had most doubts about
correct placement for the new files, especially from the omega tree).

> Thomas, can you make the simplications to texmf.cnf now?

I'll happily do this (not right now, but soon). Maybe, we can get an
update for pdftex in time (which helps with cleaning up TEXINPUTS for
pdftex based formats). The changes to pdftex are just a few lines,
but I want that Martin approves what I plan to do.

No. What's more interesting is the response time for typical

It  took about 10mn from user  time  to get source.development from home
(512K cable connexion). But it aborted because of a  case problem (?) in
the name of the file source.development/build. As  I understand it, both
Build and build are checked in.

Do you intend to push the whole tree under cvs ? I mean Master and Build
directories ?

Yes, please. I registered at Berlios with name tetex (te was too short).

I am at present more interested in the source tree only; if we have a 
successful experiment there, we can move over the Master tree. but now 
now, I think.

dvips can easily be changed regarding the map file issue (I have done
this in my private copy) and adjusting afm2tfm is trivial, too, but
getting the enc / type1 / prologues sorted right, is harder, I think. I
didn't even dream of getting it for this release, but if you could do it,
that would be wonderful!

The main problem are routines which don't distinguish between the file
types, e.g.
  search(headerpath, s, READBIN);
in output.c which is called for enc files, type1 fonts and
prologues/headers. For enc files and type1 fonts, we now have more
"specialized" kpathsea formats which could be used instead.

If we can't fix all drivers, we'll have to live with e.g.
  TEXPSHEADERS = .;$TEXMF/{fonts/{enc,type1},dvips,tex}//
instead of
  TEXPSHEADERS = .;$TEXMF/dvips//

I think that tex// is needed for pdftex only which uses TEXPSHEADERS
for graphics. Hm...

actually very impressive, considering how far the bits have to come

> Thomas, can you make the simplications to texmf.cnf now?

I have carefully eliminated all "engines" in TEXINPUTS except "tex" and
"pdftex". We can take out pdftex, after pdftex is changed and no longer
uses kpse_tex_format for accessing the config file. (I am still waiting
for Martin's response on this.)

We can't simplify TEXPSHEADERS and TEXCONFIG until we have "fixed"
all applications that use these formats.

Analysys of applications that use these formats:
  hbf2gf (from cjkutils): already perfect. Only uses the old formats,
     with old versions of kpathsea. Well done!
  dvipdfm: uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for enc files; trivial to fix
  dvipdfmx: uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for enc files; trivial to fix
    More changes might be desirable to make the application aware of
    other new kpse formats
  dvipsk: well, I said something about this.
  ps2pkm: uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for enc files; trivial to fix
  ttf2pfb: already perfect. Uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for getafm.ps
    which is ok.
  ttf2pk: uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for enc files; trivial to fix
    Searches for sfd and map files using kpse_program_text_format which
    should be changed, too.
  metapost: uses kpse_dvips_config_format for map file; should be changed
  pdftex: trivial changes to mapfile.c, ttf2afm.c, writet1.c, config.c
    needed
  windvi: I let Fabrice look after this :-)
  xdvik: uses kpse_tex_ps_header_format for enc files; funny that it
    already uses kpse_fontmap_format for looking up map files as fallback
    if lokkup with kpse_program_text_format fails. Map files used not
    to be found using kpse_fontmap_format, but now this is what works
    and what we want! :-)
  updmap: kpsewhich --format='dvips config' has to be changed to
    kpsewhich --format=map

dvips and pdftex are maintained *primary* here in out perforce tree,
so I think that we'll leave it up to the maintainers to do the changes
(I am of course giving any help that I can give). I want to leave
windvi to Fabrice, too.

Since the changes to the other programs are rather small and simple,
I suggest that I just make them in out tree and send the authors the
diffs. Ok? The situation is somewhat strange, because outside our group,
the new kpathsea formats are not yet available... I have asked Olaf for
them and he has given them to me and I have put them into our tree...

Kaja/Karl, can you try sarovar, and see if Thomas has unusually poor speed?

XS4ALL (via KPN) is my ADSL provider.  The adsl-modem/firewall is the
first hop.  :-) I put a break at the point where my route begins to
match Thomas'.

This time it took considerably longer for me compared to the previous
time, but still only 1/3rd of the time Thomas needed.

I really wonder where the difference is -- can there be caching of the
compressed files?

Anyway, I promise to stop torturing that poor machine.

Roughly consistent -- my view some 20 ms better -- with my AS6453 view
(passing 
over Singtel). Are we planning to host it over there,... Or are we doing
rough 
Compare and extrapolate eval.? (Sorry, if I haven't followed the thread
close 
Enough..)

One thing I am fairly sure of is that we want to move to public 
repository sometime this year.
The question is which one. The contrast is between a machine in Germany 
which is close to many developers,
and one in India. How much does location matter?

The attraction of Sarovar is that it is run by a TeX insider in a nice 
country....

For "global reach" quite a bit, IMHO.

Shared opinion. 


Would we have the means of using our own box? I might be able to find it a
few rack units
close to the core...

Thats what I don't have a feeling for,  ie how slow it gets before it is 
annoying.

my initial feeling is that when Thomas sends me an email saying "I have 
fixed that, try now", and
I do a "cvs update" to see what he has changed, a minute or two does not 
matter much. Mainly
because this is not my real job, and I don't do it intensively all day. 
During the day, I want
a much faster response when I access our local version control system to 
fix a web page, but sitting
down in the evening to try and solve a TeX Live problem, link time with 
CVS or Perforce does not matter so much.
After all, nearly all ones working time is spent offline on this project.

OK. But 350 ms and more is quite much... Synch. Will roughly work, but take 
it's time.

Yes, surely you can treat Sarovar in that way, I am only happy.  But
the sad part is the speed which is sickeningly slow for you fortunate
people and this is beyond my control.

However, I would love to see Sarovar used in some manner. BerliOS
seems to be the right option and Sarovar could be a backup setup.  If
at all something goes wrong with BerliOS, Sarovar could help then.

That would be very nice! The email from Berlios, which Karl posted 
recently on this list, gave me an impression that Berlios has funds 
for 1 year, but nothing certain after that. So something might, 
potentially, go wrong.

Btw, has anyone looked into opendarwin.org suggested by Gerben?

I have no objection to opendarwin, it looked very nice, but does it
offer anything the others do not?  I didn't see anything.  We could
check its speed I suppose.

All else being equal, I think we'd all prefer to use sarovar, since it's
run by friends of TeX :).  The problem is, all else isn't equal --
accessing India is slower than Germany, no surprise there.

So the bottom line, to my mind, is whether the principal checker-inners
(Thomas, Martin, Staszek, Sebastian, ...), who are all in Europe (that I
can think of), can stand the slowness to India.  If they can, seems we
should use sarovar.

If it's just too painful, then we can investigate opendarwin, and/or
just use berlios.  I have not been impressed with berlios's reliability,
but at least they seem to be pretty quick about fixing things.

One relevant technical thing about cvs, which perhaps not everyone is
aware of -- p4 sync always updates the whole tree.  With cvs, if you run
cvs update in some subdirectory, it'll just update that directory and
all its subdirectories.  Since most changes are localized, this can save
quite some time.  My own approach is to run a cron job every night that
does a full update, and usually just do local updates as needed.

i think that funding a dedicated machine is no problem for user groups (one 
of those 2.4 G / 1 G mem/ three times 36 Gig SCSI with software raid dell 
rack machines of say 3000 EUR), given that it can be put somewhere on a 
fast line (probably at some european university or so), and given that 
someone maintains it; if it's tex-live-cvs only, maintaining is probably 
quite doable,

Hi,

On our 4096/640 ADSL line:

A fresh start (empty dir):

hagen@server-2:~> time cvs -z9 -Q 
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.texlive.berlios.de:/cvsroot/texlive co 
source.development

real    2m12.172s
user    0m9.780s
sys     0m2.980s

An update after that:

hagen@server-2:~> time cvs -z9 -Q 
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.texlive.berlios.de:/cvsroot/texlive co 
source.development

real    0m12.650s
user    0m0.270s
sys     0m0.100s


sarovar: Roundtrip time to 61.95.175.38,           average = 417ms, min = 
417ms, max = 426ms -- 09-Jan-04 18:46:06
berlios: Roundtrip time to cvs.texlive.BERLIOS.DE, average =  31ms, min 
=  30ms, max =  32ms -- 09-Jan-04 18:48:22

so that's quite a difference. I wonder how fast the darwin alternative is.

    i think that funding a dedicated machine is no problem for user

Buying a machine is no problem.  But maintaining it is another matter
altogether.  One of the principal advantages of using an existing
hosting facility is that there are people paid to monitor it, maintain
it, and improve it, it's not just done on a volunteer basis.  That's
what we're doing now, and while it obviously works well enough to get
workk done, none of us have time or ever will have time to build a real
community infrastructure.  Nor do I see any reason why we should
reimplement when there are so many choices already out there.

As I wrote earlier today, to my mind the determining factor is whether
the slowness to India is acceptable to the people who do actually lots
of source checkins and updates.  If it is, then we're done - let's use
sarovar.  If it isn't, then we might as well compare opendarwin and
berlios, having come this far.

Renting a server at an ISP is _much_ cheaper and simpler.
2.4G/512M/80G with 100GB traffic is 39/month
(http://www.hetzner.de). And if you want backup you get two of
them. :-)

I wouldn't mind India, but I think we should start with Berlios
and keep Sarvoar as a backup. We could even do an automatic
syncing between two repositories and use both (if there are
enough asians who want to use the repository and find India
faster).

Our main asset is the repository: Once we have that organized, we
can easily switch hosts.

    but I think we should start with Berlios

If/since sarovar is not sufficiently "close" for you and others, can we
try opendarwin before making a final decision?  At least, I don't see
any a priori reason to exclude it.

    Seems that sarovar.org is unreachable from France :

That just means a router along the way is blocking ICMP.
You can get to http://www.sarovar.org in a browser right?

Yes, you are right. Sorry. I wonder what's the purpose of not allowing a
traceroute but well ... I guess it could work from here the same way as
from Germany anyway.

Of course. We must also check that they have no problem with the
licenses for texmf...

Seems that palo-alto doesn't like requests from tracert ;-))
I have the same from Windows, but traceroute from Linux is OK...

Interesting that even having the shortest way from Poland to India,
I use similar route:

It's 'cause off different implementation. Anyway, potential ('cause other
reasons might 
be the case) filtering parts of ICMP does not imply that relevant services
are filtered.

P.S. Some of us tend to be restrictive replying to, for example, echo reply,

Whats is strange and the reason I didn't even try to open the web site
in my browser :

C:\>ping texlive.sarovar.org

Pinging texlive.sarovar.org [202.88.238.22] with 32 bytes of data:

Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.

Ping statistics for 202.88.238.22:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),

I failed (and I'm still failing) to ping it, and tracert was unable to
reach it either.

perhaps someone could create a project at Darwin?

but, to be honest, I think it would look a little odd to tie ourselves to a
site so closely associated with one operating system, and a company which
is not known for its open source credentials. yes, I am sure Apple are 
being good
people these days, but you cannot get rid of historial baggage that quickly.

I am afraid I see no evidence yet that Perforce is not, technically, 
much better than CVS!

Anyway, I just spent my own pennies on a book about CVS, in the 
expectation of having to use it. Sigh.
Its bad enough at work having to learn Subversion.

It works, albeit quite slower. I didn't do any timing however.

It is (and I _know_ CVS). But CVS is known to more people; and I
find the branching and tagging in CVS much simpler than in p4.

Obviously one of these is much faster than the other (Berlios).

For comparison, checking out a very similar sized project from SourceForge takes approximately 50%
of the time of the Berlios test above.

The way I view this it probably doesn't matter where the CVS repository
lives as long as the facilities on which it is hosted are reliable and
redundant (multi-homed networks, high availability storage etc) . Added
bonuses are things like project management tools and build farms, but there's no particular reason why these all need to be in
the same place (apart from convenience).

That is a good point. OTOH it is Open and it is probably the widest 
spread desktop unix around these days. Personally, I think this is the 
point to consider. Attaching TeX to OpenDarwin has the disadvantage of 
connecting it to one particular OS (an open OS btw, you can run Darwin 
on Intel boxes, just like you can FreeBSD and friends, the fact that 
Mac OS X *uses* Darwin is slightly a different situation.) The 
advantage is that you make use of better funded circumstances.

Come on. This is not really helpful, is it? Why act negative? If we 
were talking SCO, Microsoft, I would agree. But Apple today is more a 
policy child of NeXT than of Apple before Jobs' return. And NeXT 
already in 1989 used GNU tools and played ball in providing the 
Objective-C compiler part back to GCC. That was before anyone had 
seriously heard of free unix and Minix was copyright protected by 
Prentice Hall (which triggered Linus Thorvalds to write Linux).

In this case, I would be glad that Unix people have a look at the patch
in the texk/web2c/tex-supp-w32.ch file in the texlive source tree. It
implements this support for filenames with spaces using the same method
as MiKTeX does (or close to it). I would like to see that not being
system dependent anymore.

I must move in different circles from you. I don't know anyone with
a Mac these days; wait, I can think of 1 person in the building
who uses Mac. as opposed to 6 or 7 with Linux. oh well.

I am merely reporting my perception. In open source circles, I don't see 
much mention of Apple at all. IBM, Sun, maybe Novell, but
Apple are just ageing hippies who sell expensive over-designed boxes, 
aren't they? :-}

I can't get over the fact that Macs never have been useable by me since 
the very early days; I thought Illustrator and Pagemaker were fun in 
about 1986, but I quickly tired of the gimmicks and got fed up with the 
slow hardware. Whenever anyone tells me different, I try a Mac around 
the place again, and its still incomprensible and still slow. And I 
still associate them with people like the awful Douglas Adams (there, 
have I offended the whole list now?)

sorry, I am a dinosaur!

How about another tack: shouldn't we be operating a cultural boycott of 
the USA these days?

As far as the test goes, only when it actually tests for space in a 
file name and barfs, it will fail. license, no comment, but somehow 
such complete rigidity does not appeal to my senses. The computing 
world has changed since 1978 and if you force yourself to stay at that 
point in all ways, you actually actively are helping TeX in its grave.

lets remember that LaTeX is already predicated on e-TeX,
which we *can* change. AAARGH no we can't, as e-TeX has that
ridiculous Knuth-like license. Or are you happy to work around that, 
Olaf? If so, why not apply Fabrice's fix to e-TeX only?

Then I would investigate talking seriously with Knuth about this.. 
Maybe Knuth would be willing to secede control to a foundation with a 
charter that protects TeX while giving it possibilities to adapt to 
necessary changes in the computing world.

Or else going on without Knuth (if at all possible, license wise)

You _do_ move in different circles. :-)

Apple notebooks are the choice for unix geeks as OSX is just a
very nice unix with a wonderfull GUI. Go to an open source
conference. Come to BachoTeX! :-)

It is possible a new approach to Knuth might have an effect, but I doubt 
it. So far as I can tell, DEK is simply not interested in this problem. 
He made TeX, it is what it is. It is like telling David Hockney to go 
back and touch up his early work, because we don't like that shade of 
pink now. TeX is a frozen art work, not a living tool...

> Or else going on without Knuth (if at all possible, license wise)

That's what Omega, e-TeX and pdfTeX are. Unfortunately, e-TeX is also 
effectively dead (its authors seem to have lost interest some years ago, 
and they also have a crazy non-license).
Omega is, well, who knows, alive, dead, gone to the moon; perhaps
most accurately characterized as sitting in an opium den in a 
drug-crazed dream...  (hello, all Omega developers who read this :-}).

pdfTeX is alive and well, and the best place to work, IMHO, but
it sits on top of eTeX and TeX, and it would be better to make changes 
lower down like this.

Oh, I am enjoying myself today.

You _can_ adapt TeX, but you must rename it. E.g. to pdfTeX. :-) 

eTeX is a different problem: It just moves much too slow (if at
all).

My local head of Unix/Linux tried this for all of last year, and is now 
selling his Mac notebook. He says it is just enough different from Linux 
to be annoying, and the GUI in practice does nothing he wants. I suspect 
I'd feel the same.

that's not the way boycotts work. we should all start now boycotting all 
things from the USA in the (very faint) hope they'll cast their votes 
against that evil man they have in the white house.

so, no more TeX, I am afraid....

oh damn, or XML either.

How about we be really radical on TeX Live this year
and only ship pdfTeX? no "real" TeX at all

Apropos of nothing, by the way, people interested in source compiling
should get the latest source.development from Perforce, where Thomas
has been working hard. With the rearrangement of the texmf tree, the 
sooner this is all tested the better.

  you should take a look at what's happened with Apple - 
        http://www.apple.com/hardware/video/virginiatech/


they've made a cluster of macs and it ranks as the 3rd most
powerful "supercomputer" in the world !!!    

apples are no longer "toys"  ;-)

So, someone tell me why I should want a supercomputer? I am sure someone 
does,
but it still seems to me like toys for a few over-indulged scientists.

I found a nice `bug': After p4 sync and using the supplied binaries for
i386-linux, I called
	texconfig init
and it came into an endless loop makeing latex.fmt, never finding huhyph
(instead of the current huhyphn). I am not sure wether this was a
misconfiguration from my side, but then, at the end, it was a nice
endless loop ;-)

you have a "language.dat" somewhere which is out of date. "huhyph.tex" 
should be "huhyphn.tex" now,
the Hungarians produced new patterns

this loop is normal, I think; ie it always behaved like that.

Why, technically speaking,? what have Apple done better that the PC

Hm... WHat causes this loop? If I create an "invalid" language.dat and run
"texconfig init", I get something like:

VTI expects "big Mac" to allow them to bring enough new contract money to
pay back the cost in a few years.  There are many fields where useful
insights can be obtained from large scale computations.  As the
cost/performance of these large systems comes down, more people
are finding ways to benefit from them, and even more people are
under pressure to have supercomputer projects even if they don't have
a clue what they are doing.  The advantage of working for the clueless
on big, expensive, projects (like, say, a missle defense system)
is that they can't tell if you are giving them garbage results.

All of which has nothing to do with finding a good home for TL2004, but
does serve to raise the point that the pro bono efforts of over-indulged
scientists is not enough to produce a good distribution.  TL needs real
(but small), stable long-term financial support to ensure the code is
accessible to maintainers thru a decent source-code control system.

Participants in this forum should be testing and coding, not worrying
about finding a free host site.  The AMS is the obvious candidate to
provide long-term administrative support, but other societies that use TeX
for publications should help defer the costs.

I don't know. I cannot reproduce it now, though I am sure I have seen 
it. Gerben thinks it
is when format A is requested which depends on format B, and that cant 
be made. But that
works ok as well.

Maybe we need more info from Norbert again.

To be fair, this conversation is mostly idle fun; it is not a big worry 
which is wasting lots of
our time. We definitely have Berlios and Sarovar available, which meet 
all our needs, and we
could also probably get space on Darwin. In a way, we are wasting time 
discussing it because
we have too much choice.

What we *should* be looking at is the changed texmf tree....

Here is the fault: It is connected with jadetex needing latex, AFAIS:

Since the hardware comes from only one vendor, it's integrated
better with the OS. Fewer driver problems.

The OS _is_ better (unix) and the GUI still is better. Even
Office is better on Mac than on W$n. Not that _that_ matters. :-)

Filenames have always been system-dependent.  We can certainly allow
\input "foo bar.tex"
in base TeX without violating anyone's license, spirit or letter.

We are not obliged to support all Unix shell conventions (which vary
among shells anyway).  We get to decide what is reasonable and so it.
\input "foo bar.tex" seems perfectly reasonable to me.

I don't think it's necessary to go to the trouble of supporting both "
and spaces simultaneously in filenames.  Although I certainly agree in
theory that "all characters should be supported", it seems like way more
work than it's worth.  Whereas putting the "..." patch into the main
source is both simple and useful.

    to devise a TeXish way of supporting them, perhaps {foo bar.tex} ?

That we cannot do in core TeX, it changes the meaning of the \input
primitive.

Fabrice, Hans, Sebastian -- I hope you are not serious.  Although you
personally may never use anything but PDF, please consider the TeX user
constituency, and keep TL useful to everyone.  We must continue to
include DVI support.

Just as one small example, in every TUGboat issue there are a few
articles which do not run with pdftex for whatever reason.

Don't panic yet. pdftex emits DVI as well as PDF, no problem. If you remake
all the symlinks to point to "pdfetex" instead of "tex", and remake 
format files,
I think you'll find no change at all.

It is a serious suggestion. The only arguments against it are

 * the "must keep Knuth's legacy intact" attitude.
 * any ways in which pdfeTeX does NOT give identical results

if the second of these applies, clearly thats  an end to the suggestion

    I think you'll find no change at all.

So, for example, if I run pdfetex with DVI enabled instead of pdf,
pstricks will work?  I suppose so -- it's just falling back on the
original code, essentially, right?

     * any ways in which pdfeTeX does NOT give identical results
    if the second of these applies, clearly thats  an end to the suggestion

So, the change must be made early, and advertised widely, and people
given a chance to test.

But even with all that, it would seem odd to me to do this in TL if the
underlying releases don't.  How about making teTeX/fpTeX/gwTeX releases
implementing this change (with pretesting, etc.)?  And at least
mentioning it on their respective technical lists.

yes. I'd be very surprised indeed if this did not work as expected. It's

it certainly needs much more discussion. probably, in fact, premature 
for this year, as it
buys us nothing but disk space and elegance. Getting encTeX will make 
more people happier.

pdf[e]tex already has dvi support.  The bigger issue to me is that
pdftex is linked to additional libraries (zlib, libpng, etc. needed
to support images) and in the past has broken when these libraries
were changed (e.g., to fix bugs affecting security).  I hope a
pdfetex-only texlive won't become the starting point for adding
all of photoshop's capabilities to pdfetex (but I would support
efforts to add support for tagged-pdf).

In pdf mode -- if there are problems using dvi mode we need to address
them.

we *are serious* especially since pdf(e)tex outputs dvi as any tex does, 
actually, even features like character protruding work in dvi mode

some persistent myths:

(1) pdftex, another kind of tex (fact: an extension in the spirit of knuth)
(2) context, a macro package depending on pdfetex (mentioned in linux 
distribution) (fact: just a macro package that runs with any tex)
(3) pdflatex, not latex, yet another program (fact: just a format loaded in 
the tex program)
(4) cmr fonts are bitmaps (fact: there have been outlines for ages)

personally i think that much of the confusion comes from the fact that less 
users understand the difference between stubs, programs, format files etc.

So, no matter how strange we may behave occasionally, this time we're 
deadly serious,

Hans

The problems have been (if at all) pre2003. The currently
distributed binaries are not dynamically linked against different
libraries than tex.

Why fiddle around with symlinks? Just replace tex, etex and pdftex by
pdfetex in the fmtutil configuration:
   fmtutil --edit; fmtutil --all; texlinks -m

For these reasons it seems clear that if we're to support anything

Yes, but if I'm right, the original code is written in such a way
that a filename is parsed in 2 places : one in which the length
is not known, the other one where it is known. There are clearly 2 ways
to feed TeX with a filename, one where

foo bar

is parsable  because something is used to  delimit it (braces ?) and one

mandatory everywhere.

Just FYI, there is no such thing as gwTeX. What I distribute roughly is
	TeX Live (for the bin, lib, include, man directories mainly)
	teTeX (for the main texmf tree)
	Some additional packages that are not part of teTeX's texmf treee 
(=gwTeX)

If I encounter something problematic or I want different, I generally 
do not change something myself (as that gives a lot of maintenance), I 
harass some nice people about it (like Thomas) until it is part of the 
general distribution.

Hence, if TL changes to pdftex only, I will follow automatically.

Any chance for 'serialized PDF' (or whatever its real name)?

Huh?  Are you thinking of \input{..} in which the braces are required?
I don't think that that was what the original poster had in mind.

I don't see any essential difference between \input with optional braces,
and \input with optional quotes.

But, why not lean toward whatever mechanism is used for outputting
special characters in \special{} and \write{} and \message{}?

    I don't see any essential difference between \input with optional braces,
    and \input with optional quotes.

I suppose not, technically.  But I still think quotes are better,
because 1) braces are special to TeX and using optional braces to
delimit the filename seems like a great source of confusion, and 2)
fpTeX and MikTeX already use quotes.  Why be gratitiously incompatible
with existing practice?

    But, why not lean toward whatever mechanism is used for outputting
    special characters in \special{} and \write{} and \message{}?

Because people want to say \input "foo bar" and not have to mess around
with getting a special space expanded in their filename?  They just want
it to work.  That's my understanding anyway.

As I can see, this thread has been messed to both mailing lists...
1. (about the above) just only "very" short notes:

Accepted. But we have been discussing ways to specify the config
file at the pdfTeX invocation -- that way this problem could be
solved by having a pdtex-dvi.cfg and a pdftex-pdf.cfg

Strange indeed, i've always objected to this, and never understood the 
reason for defaulting to pdf mode; it's up to the macro package (i.e. user) 
to choose the output format, one good reason being that only that way the 
right initializations can take place for the chosen backend. In Context, 
one of the first thing that happens is to set pdfoutput to zero. In the 
case of latex: if pdflatex is used i guess that pdf can be enabled in the 
format; so ... in any case pdf(e)tex should default to dvi output.

hm, since pdf is more resticted it's in many cases more robust than ps 
code! actually, one reason for us to switch to pdf was that there were too 
many problems with ps (especially fonts); the problem with pdf is not in 
pdftex, since the pdf code conforms to pdf/x, a standardized subset and the 
code resulting from the tex part is not tricky at all; the problem is in 
pdf code that is included (graphics): and in that respect pdftex is 
dependent on quality of third party data in a similar way as dvips is 
dependent of (e)ps code by third parties (e.g. the output produced by 
illustrator can be problematic in both eps as pdf format).

but, as said before: pdftex can produce 100% compatible dvi code, so users 
can still use that output format (also, dvips still has to be part of tex 
live, if only because it permits dvi -> ps -> pstoedit -> metapost cycles -)

since big texmf trees are much slower than small ones (which is why i use a 
small subsets for production jobs) it makes sense to move much of the mf 
related things to a separate texmf tree, probably one that will seldom 
change; that way tex live can provide -at installation time- the option to 
use that tree or not; we should consider using more trees anyway, since 
this is one of the strong points of web2c:

texmf-unsupported
texmf-metafonts
texmf-experimental
texmf-main
texmf-notsognu

indeed, (although i guess that those who make " active are users of 
macropackages that can handle that situation); maybe the " should be an 
option, and then it could be disabled for plain tex.

it would not be the default. it would depend on what command you used

hmm. I don't think history will support you. PostScript started off 
clean, turned into an extended mess, and now looks frozen. PDF started 
clean, and has remained clean, with incremental development. more or 
less ;_]

interesting idea. but I wonder how much of the tree has Metafont-related 
stuff? there are 5090 .mf source files, and only about 12 PKs these days.

its not as simple as that. when you install TL, you decide which 
packages you want installed. each package may populate or not one of 
your trees. if you don't want Metafont stuff, don't install those font 
packages....

it might make sense to have a texmf-srcdoc tree, in which we place
all the source and documentation files so
you only get them with specific commands. That would cut down
the size of the working tree considerably. Since its under package 
control, it would not be that big a deal for us to organize.

texmf/doc         272812
texmf/source       73716
texmf/fonts/source 39644

what do others think of that idea? would one put fonts/source in that 
separate tree, or one of its own? does anyone but Metafont read a .mf file?

Static linking is not a good solution, and becomes less so as you increase
the number of image formats supported.  It would be better it pdftex could
be used without the image format libraries, but support a mechanism for
adding image manipulations without recompiles for those who insist on
the ability to place images.

Are the various linux distro's self-contained (redhat, fedora, mdk,
debian, SUSE, SGI Freeware, etc.)?  I know from sad experience that the
SGI freeware distro, put together from teTeX-2.02 by volunteers, has an
enormous set of dependencies, including many libraries as well as
standalone utilities.

Why that ??? It is the only bullet proof solution against strange or

One static pdfetex binary would remove some of those dependencies.

I have made test compilations (gcc 3.3.2) in source.development
on two platforms: Solaris (2.9) and Linux (RedHat 9). 

RedHat 9

Compiled cleanly, producing 248 programs.

Comparing with Martin's message:

to move on, I tried different recompilations (--without-dtl etc)
and finally found that my problem had something to do with the
texk/devnag/configure file. at least manual removal of devnag from 
texk/configure (there is no global --without-devnag option) made 
it all fly (247 programs, one less than linux because of devnag). 
does anyone have a hint what could be wrong?

I did not attemp the compilation for irix: we are in the process
of phasing out our SGI machines...

The OS versions I used are newer than what we use for TL, so I'm not 
sure you want the files checked in.

I, myself, no longer provide binaries. I just provide the source code.
People building the binaries can decide what to do. The default configure
script already supports a lot of options for handling libraries and the
source package comes with several libraries: libpng, libwww, ncurses,
xpdf, zlib and a library for handling type1 fonts (split into t1lib
/ type1).

So, if you actually build teTeX on your own, you do not need to have
these libraries to be installed. However, if you already have some of
them on your system, you can use them instead of building them again.

Back to the packaging problem.

I wonder if we are not simply wasting our energy in trying to let
everybody choosing the smallest part of this big texmf tree to tailor
his installation, trying to spare a few kb. I'm pretty sure the grain
size is much too small. I don't know if there is another solution easily
reachable but we could  save energy by thinking about it.

Maybe a topic for Dante'04 (Darmstadt) ?

If the output mode is dumped in the format, why not remove it from the
.cfg file and put it in the .ini file. This way latex.fmt would set
output mode to 0 and pdflatex to 1 ... ?

It would be the best solution which can retain simple linking 
latex->pdfetex,
I think that output mode=0 should also ignore reading .cfg file at all.
At the moment there is no command line for output format or switching to
another config file...

i'm not sure about that, since it may concern (future) settings with

at the collection level, we are talking about 58 items. I don't think 
that is too small, at all. If anything
it should be bigger.

the package system tracks things at the level of work of individual 
authors. for good or bad,
something like "prosper"  _is_ a unit, and it's worth recording as such.

This looks like a bash or ksh feature in the configuration file; the
Red Hat /bin/sh is actually bash: when  invoked under the name sh, it
conforms to POSIX sh, but POSIX contains extensions over traditional sh.

Here is an example:

On Solaris and HP/Compaq/DEC OSF/1 4.x and 5.x:

	% ~/foo.sh

On Solaris with a POSIX sh:

	% /usr/xpg4/bin/sh < ~/foo.sh
	This is a nested echo

The same output is obtained on Solaris with /usr/bin/ksh (all Solaris
versions) and /usr/bin/bash (Solaris 2.8 or later).

On GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and IBM AIX:

	~/foo.sh
	This is a nested echo

SGI IRIX 6.5 produces completely different output:

	~/foo.sh
	$(echo This is a nested echo)

The syntax to use that works everywhere is the backquoted form:

	echo `echo This is a tested echo`

I agree. I was mainly targeting dependencies. The collection level is
fine for me. It would be even nicer if I was sure that collections can
be installed independently one from the other.

Subject: [tex-live] problems with fptex texmf-local style file not found
Message-ID: <5.2.0.9.2.20040115005117.009f87f0@131.188.3.51>

Hi!

(System: Windows 98/II)

My problem is: I have uninstalled TeX Live 7 (2002er version from CD) and 
installed the new TeXLive from the CD 09/2003 I received from Dante. And I 
have done the online updates as described on 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html and http://www.fptex.org/upgrade.html.

But Latex is still unable to find my personal style files saved in 
TeXLive\texmf-local\latex\harald even after installing all updates and 
doing all maintenace features as rebuilding ls-R filenames databases.

If I put the style files in the directory where I my source tex-file is, 
all is working. But if the style file is in texmf-local (or even if I put 
it in texmf and rebuilding ls-R database) the file is not found.

The style file I use is the hint from Gerd Neugebauer in "Die TeXnische 
Kommoedie" from Dante, issue 2/1996, pg. 44 ff. for using amssymb and bbold 
for double stroked numers. Here is the relevant code I use in the style 
file bbbold.sty:

\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{bbbold}[1994/04/06 Bbbold symbol package]
\newcommand{\bbbfamily}{\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{bbold}\selectfont}
\newcommand{\textbbb}[1]{{\bbbfamily#1}}
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathbbb}{U}{bbold}{m}{n}
\endinput

With the 2002er Version of TeXLive I don't have any problems but here I'm 
am helpless. (BTW: Why is the file still not found after putting it in the 
texmf file structure? And it happens with all other style files I've 
created, too.)

Errors:

but I'm unable to find bbbold.sty (I can put it in whatever directory I

Could this problem be a result of deinstalling the 2002er Version (I have 
afterwards removed the complete directory) and the installing the new 
version so that there could be a file I have forgotten to delete? 
Autoexec.bat seems to be o.k. after putting the fpTeX-variables on top as I 
have done with the old version:

Thank you very much for your help!

You can also check whether you have texmf-local included to the list
of used TeX trees:
kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMF

Actually hardware is not a problem since Apple switched to IDE and 
developed excellent Firewire and USB support. I have seen many 
combinations of hardware on Macs in the last six or so years. The 
reality is that all OSs have hardware limitations and MacOS is no 
better or worse than any other.

Office 2004 has been set for release in the first of this year.

Ahhh! I asked several times how that protrusion can be used. Martin 
told me that only Hans could answer... ;-}
The most strange thing is that pdftex.cfg is even needed for 
generating the format. For what damn reason?
I recall that Pawel Jackowski reported that many times: he wanted to build
any special XXX.efmt, but failed since pdftex.cfg was not found.
It is not so easy to build just latex.efmt with pdfetex engine. Even
after puting in latex.ini \pdfoutput=0, fmtutil run still tries to load
pdftex.cfg. So actually we can switch to the DVI output _only_
in the input file.
Please consider that transition to pdfetex as the default engine
should be easy and transparent for the BLU user, so any playing with
command line etc. would be hardly acceptable. Sight.

Just answering this point: pdftex.cfg is no longer searched using
TEXINPUTS, and has its own search path:
  PDFTEXCONFIG = .;$TEXMF/pdftex/{$progname,}//
which no longer depends on the right something.$progname setting in
texmf.cnf.

Because no normal LaTeX user needs them. They _are_ possible in
pdfTeX, but it takes some wizardry with \pdfliteral.

Now could we please continue _this_ discussion _only_ on the pdfTeX
list, where it belongs?

surely pdftex.cfg does not _have_ to have that line in?

Thank you, texmf-local is included!

Thank you very much for the help! O.k, I was _very_ lazy with putting style

i guess that he was right in saying that the unix build was broken...

it would be REALLY nice to make sure that ALL source files have

I did fix this in source.development. Sebastian should take that over to source.

Once again ... I have applied my fix-eol.bat script on all the files I
have submitted. I'm afraid I didn' touch at all this file. What could
have happen how ever is that it got converted in my back because I'm the
one who uploaded the whole lcdf tree. The problem is that we can't
remove ^M from all the files in the source tree. Some of them need them.

Thanks. I compiled from source.development 1.11c-beta, changed the layout
of all .ini files according to P4 depot, but when preparing the formats
pdfetex still loads pdftex.cfg. Here is the current problem:
how to avoid reading pdftex.cfg while running pdf(e)tex --ini
I would vote for dumping the *default* output to the format, say
latex will use \pdfoutput=0, pdflatex will use \pdfoutput=1
So latex etc. could be linked just to pdfetex, without any other
command line switch (anyway not yet available). For such command&format
I'd suggest not reading pdftex.cfg at all (it sets things rather
concerned to pdf output).

Sebastian Rahtz wrote:
> surely pdftex.cfg does not _have_ to have that line in?

I don't think so. pdftex.cfg should be left as it is for commands&formats
which use pdf output by default. Just to avoid a mess with new
command line parameters for pdf(e)tex, more config files, 
and... for transparent use as (e)tex replacement as the main 
engine (actually not true).
In consequence we can just leave tex (for archeologists, like me ;-)
and pdfetex, and forget pdftex, etex etc. with all those variants like
ini... and vir...

this discussion does suggest that a new command-line option will
be needed, to give the user yet another tool to switch output formats.

Subject: [tex-live] hosting decisions
Message-ID: <200401181607.i0IG7hd03986@f7.net>

Back on TeX Live hosting.  Unfortunately it seems opendarwin is not a
viable option, since I've been unable to even get an account so I can
apply for the project.  (You have to put in a mentor username; the guy
who wrote Gerben told me his username to use, but it didn't work, and he
hasn't replied to my queries since.  If it's this hard just to get an
account ...)

So, here is my take on the situation:

If we are switching to CVS right now, then it seems (regrettably)
berlios is preferable to sarovar because it is faster for most TL
developers, network-wise.  But see my closing comment.

If we are not switching to CVS right now, but will in the future, then
I'd like to try to use berlios to track bugs, etc.  That is, ultimately
it seems it will be best if CVS and bugs+ were at the same place.

If we are not switching to CVS, ever, then we might as well use sarovar
for the bug tracking and project admin.

I am agnostic on whether we switch to CVS this year, since time is
passing quickly, but I would like to do so for next year, if not this.
We know that perforce will renew its license for TL this year (and
indefinitely), so we don't have to feel rushed in making a decision.


My biggest concern about berlios is reliability.  I've been using them
for a couple of months for Texinfo, and I don't think there has been a
week without an outage -- usually relatively short, but still.  The one
we experienced during our testing was unusual, in that the web server
was dead; usually it's only CVS, and it's not that the machine itself
completely dies, but rather some configuration issue or another.  Thus,
I do not have warm fuzzy feelings.

CVR, I wonder if you could speak a little about sarovar's CVS uptime?
(Web stuff is relatively unimportant.)

Reliability might trump efficiency, but it's definitely subjective.

Hi,

Just got some files to test (from fabrice),

Since in the past (and therefore in local trees) map files could end up on

Subject: [tex-live] path search 
Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20040118213116.01ddf560@localhost>

Hi,

When i say

   \input ./whateverfile

(or \openin) i expect tex (or mp) to take that literally, i.e. when no file 
is found, it should see an empty file.

This used to work (at least some tex lives back, when i wrote the context 
file handlers). I went to a lot of trouble to make sure that i could bypass 
the path searching in controlled situations, but now it seems that in the 
case of an explicit path ( here ./ ) still the path searching is used. I 
think that when one provides an explicit path, i.e. when the filename 
starts with one of

  .
  /
  <char>:

no path searching should take place. (unless maybe a filename end with // -)

reason: imagine that i generate a mp graphic [or whatever temp file; 
context loves buffers] at runtime, and that graphic is empty, for instance 
because there is an error in the mp code; in that case i now get any file 
that matches the name, instead of no result (and therefore no indication of 
an error);

reason: when i started with mp support, i used temp files called 
mpgraph.mp; this worked ok, till tex distributions started to distribute 
hobbies manual and documentation which had a file with the same name; then, 
i suddenly got side effects (i.e. i had to generate empty files, just to 
make sure that a run that didn't have graphics embedded, didn't result in 
hobbies manual to be processed); explicit filenames (./mpgraph) were a way 
out; but now ...

Can someone shed some light on this (was it changed, when, how do i find 
out, how to prevent, etc)

Btw, there are situations when one would like to be more specific in the 
path search; i fear the moment that files with the same names end up in 
context trees, which is possible when users have their own extensions (e.g. 
symbol definitions, typescripts, modules); currently i can handle that with 
a rigurous name scheme but ...; maybe there should be some option like

\input [tex/context/private/]thisorthatfile

(not an explicit path since it has [] which are not used by tex users for 
filenames i guess)

i.e. [...] tells the kpse library that tex/context/private/thisorthat is to 
be searched (in the tree), not to be confused with an explicit path under 
the current directory.

so:

   \input thisorthat                           : search controlled by kpse 
variables
   \input ./thisorthat                         : search controlled by user 
(first example)
   \input ../figures/thisorthat                : search controlled by user 
(second example)
   \input [somewhere;somewhereelse]/thisorthat : a combination

I can even imagine:

   \input [*somewhere]/thisorthat              : with *somewhere being 
$somehwere, i.e. an env/kpse variable

[ ] and * are not used in filenames normally so ...

I agree.  My in-development code handles this case by checking the
given name: if it is absolute or explicit relative ("./<name>") it
constructs a one-element path that will be used to search in.  (Some
kind of search is still necessary because several suffixes may be
possible.)

It looks like the logic that ought to accomplish the same in
libkpathsea is broken.  :-(

Interesting.  It looks quite doable to fit something like this in the
new code, though I do believe some details would still have to be
sorted out.

Certainly.  In my original code, I went to a lot of trouble to make
absolute or explicitly relative paths not use the search paths (not in
the same Olaf is, though, which sounds cleaner).  I don't know when or
how the behavior changed ... Anyway ...

Fabrice sent me a guess in private mail that's almost certainly
correct.  It is my fault, of course.

due to vacation my remark comes a bit late, but never the less...

if you look on the TeX Collection DVD, there is a directory named
"texmf-extra". I asked Michel Bovani to supply all font necessary for
the use of Fourier, and we put them in this directory on the DVD.
Just include texmf-extra in your path and everything is there to use.

I have sent this mail a few ours ago when I wasn't yet subscribed to the
mailing list. Thus, please excuse me if you get it twice.


I have one problem with the TeXLive 8 installation for Linux (with
Windows, I have not tested it):

For many packages, the documentation is not installed (in the
directory $TEXMF/doc/latex) although I have selected to install
documentation. I do not have a detailed list of packages where this
happens, but here are some examples:

numprint:
  installed: README numprinttest.dvi numprinttest.tex
  missing:   numprint.pdf

babelbib:
  installed: README  babelbibtest.dvi  babelbibtest.tex
  missing:   babelbib.dvi

cmbright:
  installed: copyrite.txt  manifest.txt  readme
  missing:   cmbright.dvi

multibib:
  installed: README
  missing:   multibib.dvi

changebar:
  installed: 00readme.txt  catalog.txt  changebar.bug  chbar.1  manifest.txt
  missing:   changebar.dvi

This is just a small list. This bug cause ?texdoc? not to work as
expected. When calling ?texdoc numprint? for instance, a netscape window
opens with the catalogue entry instead of the documentation.

For some packages, the documentation is installed as requested.

Is there a possibility to fix that problem without waiting for the next
release of TeXLive? Is there an easy and quick way to install the missing
documentation files for all installed packages?

Yours
Harald

I am not entirely surprised. I am continually culling
files to fit on the CD... I'll try to do better next time


...

You have to bear in mind that packages from CTAN are run through
a "sausage machine" to make TL packages. I do not (cannot) read
the documentation, Makefiles etc, so sometimes I don't do what the
author intended.

no. because there is no formal record of what documentation should be 
available for a package. it only exists in ad hoc formats or buried in 
README files.

Yes, that is evident. Is there a possibility to ensure that some files are
surely included? May be you could define a special file provided by
the package authors that specifies which files have to be included in the
tex, doc, and source sections.

For example, the package author could include a file 'tlfiles.txt' similar
to this one:

tex: numprint.sty numprint032.sty
doc: numprint.pdf README
source: numprint.dtx numprint032.dtx numprint.ins numprinttest.tex \
  getversion.tex Makefile
catalogue: numprint.xml


An approach like this may ease to build the archives and tpm files. The
package authors could also provide tpm files by themselves. But then,
there should be some documentation how to write a tpm file available.

Yours
Harald

of course, I could try. I could start off my testing for a TL manifest
file. but it gets complicated. many packages need compiling in some way
before the files exist, so the manifest has to say "first run pdflatex, 
then makeindex, then bibtex etc etc".

thats the problem. lack of time to document anything!

Yes, you are right. And it needed too much space in the CTAN network if
each package provided the documentation in pre-compiled format, I think.

I've been too lazy to learn XML, yet. :-(
And if the package authors provide a shell script or a Makefile that
generate the documentation and package. It could be done this way:
If a Makefile exists that has the target "texlive" this is used. This
target has to produce some directories, e.g., "doc", "tex", and "source",
and generates/copies the needed files there. Many Windows users may not know
about that but this is better than nothing, I think.

Sarovar hasn't suffered any downtime during last year except for two
hours or so for rack maintenance by the ISP.  Sarovar is not a huge
setup like Sourceforge, but has only 436 usrs and 82 projects. We
started around beginning of April 2003.

During last year we had stopped twice ssh and CVS for a day each when
root exploit was reported and consequently Linux kernel was upgraded
or patched.

Otherwise, Sarovar is going strong without any hitch so far.

We have waited a year to follow the TDS standard. At some point we have to
drop backward compatibility, else the search paths are getting more and
more complicated. The search paths have already been complicated and we
have rearranged things -- if we want to be "old texmf tree" compatible,
the search paths have to be set up even more complicated than they have
ever been before.

The map file stuff is not the only point, we also no longer search
texmf/pdftex or texmf/etex for tex input stuff. We have done this to be
able to simplify the search paths. I don't see the point in keeping the
search paths compatible. If we do this, people will not rearrange the
files in their local tree and they will be hit next year.

My opinion is to meke a clear cut now and to write some notes about the
changes into the documentation. We should even drop texmf/fontname from
TEXFONTMAPS and just go with
  TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map//
.

i agree with the statement that we should not be rigid in backward 
compatibility, but the problem here is "ho wis someone supposed to know 
that already a year ago there was a change in tds", actually, if that is 
the case, why wasn't pdftex adapted to it before tex live went to iso-image

(some time ago the dutch hyphenation filename changed, and i as well 
asother dutch language support people ended up answering questions why 
things didn't work any more; in general, the problem is: how do we reach 
those who need to know what to change)

that's ok since there is nothing in there and context (and probably also 
latex) does not use the etex src files; actually, my local texmf.cnf files 
often drop even more funny paths -)

my main concern is fonts, and not tex files or graphics; fonts often end up 
in a local tree, but document sources in a user specific path; since tex 
already has a bad reputation of installing fonts and get 'm working, such a 
change could ruin the reputation even more

sure, but we can only do that when we have a mechanism for announcing that 
in place, e.g. a place on a web page (of user groups) explaining that the 
*next* tex live will drop this or that compatibility so that one has one 
year to prepare; actually, on the cover there should be a reference 
pointing to a file.

one year should then be enough to let users adapt scripts etc etc

in spite of tex running out of the box, i find myself too often explaining 
(even to experienced users) why a file (format or whatever) is not found 
and how the tree is organized (not neccessarily related to context); i fear 
that (since quite some context users use commercial fonts or fonts that 
come with the system) i'll have to answer all kind fo questions with 
regards to "it used to work but ..." (happened before when some tfm/pfb 
names changed and afm files became gzipped and unreadable).

i never understood the purpose of texmf/fontname so i have no problems with 
dropping that -)

maybe we should consider (in pdftex) an option: \pdfmapfilepath {some 
syntax that works ok with the $NAMES}, but then, how to feed that back into 
kpse ...

(given this thread, i'm seriously considering to drop map files and define 
map entries dynamically, since this is what pdftex can do nowadays, but i 
have to find time to play with that in more detail)

You can always only reach a small fraction of all TeX users. That's why
I suggest to make these changes now and not in a year.

Well, but that is just your point of view. I can well imagine that
some people have installed additional macro packages for pdftex into
texmf/pdftex in their local tree.

You want to ignore their problems, but not yours!? Basically, it is the
same kind of problem and I'd like to handle them in the same way.

I think that it helps to tell people *one* place where to put map files,
not two or three. Same for enc files etc. We are on the right way to
make things easier. But, only if we simplify the search paths.

If we had that possibility to inform most TeX users, I'd agree. But,
we don't really have it and that's why I prefer to make the change now.
Maybe, it would help to put a warning message into the updmap program.
People are supposed to run it to "register" their map files. It could
generate a prominent warning about a search path change if it cannot
find a listed map file.

> one year should then be enough to let users adapt scripts etc etc

All these changes have little impact on user's work. They don't need a
year to rearrange their files or adjust their scripts. It took me about
two evenings to make the transition for TeX Live (scripts, drivers and
texmf tree). And, some of this time was merely a general removal of
duplicates and cleanup before I started the real work.

> in spite of tex running out of the box, i find myself too often explaining

Well, I think that we have solved a great ammount of that by making a new
kpse_pdftex_config_format, so finding pdftex.cfg now works independent
of TEXINPUTS.$progname and the right setting of progname.

See, by putting the files to the right place and by using the right search
paths, things become more simple.

gzipped afm files are off-topic here.

Well, you might well do your own thing about map file entries at pdftex
macro level, but for me, this is no solution. I always suggest that my
users (be it teTeX or TeX Live) make their ps fonts known to updmap. That
way, they can use the fonts with pdftex, dvips, xdvi, dvipdfm etc etc. All
that you can offer is a pdftex-only solution. Any you suffer from the
problem that your macros don't know which names the font files have on
the target system.

There are many users who still expect TeX to use one env't variable
to point to a directory where it will load inputs, based on a dog-eared
copy of the "local guide" from the uni. where they did their PhD.

The TeX user community is more likely to read and understand documentation
than most, and most people who develop for TeX do make an effort to
provide documentation, but you can't expect people who are taking time
away from their day jobs to take the time to document changes for every
new TeX release.  To some extent, this is a question of organization and
style -- many documents don't adequately separate basic concepts from
things that are liable to change with new OS's and or TeX systems, which
can leave users in a state of confusion when the current distro departs
from the behaviour described in the documents they use.

Maybe the doc tree could be split between those that are distribution-
neutral or have been updated to to the current distro, and those that
contain outdated information.  Finding things in the doc tree is, however,
way too hard -- most users find texdoc and even texdoctk almost useless.
The 4allTeX book was very popular with users at my site.

A statistician colleague would like to see stats packages require users
to answer skill-testing questions before they can enter data.  Many
packages require users to "accept" a license agreement before installing.
TL2004's installer could present a "README" file warning of
the incompatible changes, followed by a pop quiz on the contents of the
README -- no install until the questions are answered correctly.

And eat up more of the time of people who support TeX users, usenet
bandwidth, etc.  It would be great to have a carefully written tutorial
that emphasizes diagnostic tools (like the books on debugging networks).

The current system is a real problem when you need to modify a document
generate a few years back -- people never think to preserve the map file
with the document sources.  I've started using small map files that I load
explicitly in the document so they can be archived with a project.

no, it's more that i (wildly) guess that users put their tex file in a 
local place or tree, while tex related font files are placed in the tree by 
programs; so i expect less problems with tex files than with the lesser 
known files (that are magically produced by utilities and so)

get me right, i agree with you on making things simple; i only want to make 
sure that for some time old things keep working; most users kno wwhat to do 
when they get a message that a tex file is not found (tex simply waits) but 
everything related to fonts is more depressing and obscure (e.g. you find 
out too late that an encoding vector or map file has changed and that the 
wrong one was used, or a file cannot be found (it takes a while to know if 
the vf or tfm file is the troublemaker) or ...

so, it's the *font* aspect that troubles me, since that's for most users 
the most difficult and obscure part of tex

sure, and when pdftex does no longer aborts when no cfg file is found that 
will not bring troubles for (context) users since the config file is kind 
of redundant

i used them as an illustration of a change in the distribiution that broke 
things; it also demonstrates that (and i fall into that trap more often 
than i want) something that works here not need to work there (in that 
respect it is already a miricle that te/fp/*tex work the way they do)

which has the danger of getting conflicts in the file since the current 
naming scheme permits the same name for fonts (esp slanted and caps) which 
in fact may differ and have different metrics (ok, i know that this is off 
topic, but it's one reason for problematic pdf/ps files being around)

hm, i wonder why people always think that i'm only aware of pdftex; i use 
dvips in mp related trickery; and, dvipdfmx is quite well supported as 
well; i would not be surprised if Chof will also support the pdftex map 
control features (just as dvipdfmx supports all other pdftex features, 
which means that context files work equally well with both systems, and for 
cjk even better with dvipdfmx -)

indeed a problem

On the other hand, much more people add texinput related stuff to their
TeX system than font related stuff; I don't think that you can make a
point here.

Again, you are argueing about time. I don't think that the situation in
a year is significantly different as far as the knowledge/information
level of TeX users are concerned if we keep the paths compatible.

On the other hand, if we allow only *one* place, people will quickly adopt
to this.

Why does that matter? Or, do you want to say that I don't know what I am
talking about?

Anyway:

   2794    2794  109365

There are already systems out that follow the new directory scheme
introduced by tds 1.0, e.g. vtex. The idea of the tds is that all
distributions should follow. The sooner we make clear where the files
need to be put, the less trouble we will have.

Well, that argument shows me that you don't know what updmap is
doing. That tool knows that pdftex has a problem and removes the psname
from those entries (which have ExtendFont / SlantFont; I don't know of
any problem with caps).

the main tree? if so, then it would be interesting to know how updating 
takes place, e.g. do people copy old things first, or just run an update 
script or ... maybe the user groups that distribute tex live should 
consider a survey (could be interesting anyway, to have a kind of feedback 
of the average user with regards to what they see as difficult; for 
instance, George W made a remark about users who freeze their perception to 
thesis-time; personally i'm curious to know how many members really update 
their systems)

>talking about?

i know that you know what you are talking about; i'm more thinking of 
organizations that have things like a house-style (with fonts etc), or 
multiple trees for different projects; for those situations [i.e. the 
systems beyond control of the main organization tex guru] there may be 
problems; i have no idea how this is normally organized, e.g. one main tree 
on a central server, with small personal trees on users system; what i do 
know is that i run into people who have big troubles to convince sysadms to 
update, and i'm not sure if sysadms (who are not tex users themselves) will 
deal with changes;

so, what i'm saying is that 'we' (the people on this list) may not be the 
best examples of the average user;

This brings me to a possible way out: can the tex live installation scripts 
provide a solution here? Say that after the installation the scripts 
(installers) report tex/map/enc files that are in odd places and suggests 
to move them?

sure, but i was more thinking of:

font xyzo (oblique variant of xyz) with slant 1.67  (in a map file)

font xyzo (oblique variant of xyz) with slant 1.78  (in another map file)

in that case one needs to control map file loading

so: same name, different metrics (so, there i have to use the map file 
specific to a project/slant); this is not so much a updmap problem as well 
a limitation in the font name scheme (pseudo caps can also come in 
different sizes); this is one of the reasons why pdftex now can load map 
files (after page 1) and overload previously loaded entries; just in case 
one has a project specific file with the same names but different metrics 
(of course all font files then are probably in some special place)

anyhow, this is rather off topic

>Oh, I don't even have a problem if you direct those questions directly to me.

i know that you're always very helpful, which is one reason why i want to 
predict/prevent problems and thereby overloading; if the installer ("do you 
want to upgrade your tree") can handle that ..  (hm, maybe i'll write a 
script for that)

Sorry, I did not notice that you were talking about the main tree. Which
programs install map / enc files there?

Well, if map / enc files are stored into the main tree by programs, the
same question comes up.

Maybe, I still did not get what you are talking about...

Good point. I think that the TeX Live documentation for the next release
should have precise instructions for people who want to adopt their local
tree to the new release. These instructions need to be clear enough even
for sysadmins without a TeX background.

Something like:
  TeX Live follows a chnage of the TeX Directory Standard made in
  Feb. 2003 which means that you need to rearrange your local texmf
  trees if they still use the old organization.

  If you have map files inside the dvips or pdftex directory tree, move
  them to fonts/map. If you have enc files inside the dvips directory
  tree, move them to fonts/enc. If you have input files for etex, mltex,
  omega and pdftex at top-level in your directory tree, move them to
  the tex tree. Try to preserve the structore that was below the old
  tree, e.g.  move pdftex/foo/baa/x.tex to tex/foo/baa/x.tex.

Yes, another good point. Maybe, it would be helpful enough to prompt
the user for a list of local trees where we just look for problematic
files and issue a warning?

Ok, I see what you neen. Most tools cannot handle that at all. Still,
off-topic...

any font installing script when no texmf-local is set (like texfont, 
although i patch that to font/map and font/enc and ask the lcd people what 
to do with the open type and special font stuff)

good! the user groups journals should out that on a page of its own

This could be scripted.

I went through a rearrange for my users a while back (splitting texmf 
in texmf and texmf.tetex) and I think hardly anybody noticed it. These 
changes here are more extensive, but it could be interactively scripted 
for the large part.
