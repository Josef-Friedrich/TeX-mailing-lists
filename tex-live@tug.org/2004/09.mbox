Could you consider including the following patch? It makes Aleph banner more
consistant with the other engines. Also, the lib/printversion.c C code
parses your banner, but assumes that there is no space char in it (which is
not true in your case), so 'aleph --version' results in incorrect output.

Best,

Fabrice

May I offer a counter proposal?

I think that the various version_strings should *not* contain 
the leading hyphen, so I would rather change the banner to read

> @d banner=='This is Aleph, Version 3.141592-',Omega_version_string,'-',eTeX_version_string,'-',Aleph_version_string {printed when \TeX\ starts}

but I would rather not touch the version_strings (except for 
the Aleph_version_string so as to remove the space).

I've seen that e-TeX, pdf-TeX etc go the "leading hyphen" way 
too. For them, I would suggest putting the hyphens in the 
'constant' string of the banner, removing them from the version 
strings.

What do you think?

I care very little one way or the other, though it is clear we'll have
to be consistent.  A few changes will have to be made in etex.mk and
pdftex.mk and some other locations, but it is all doable.

Please do drop the double-hypens from the aleph version string though,
it is mainly seen on the terminal, and very ugly there.

IMO it's more cleaner to have the hyphens in the banner rather 
than in the version_strings.

No problem with that. I won't be able to checkin before Friday 
though, probably.

Talking about version numbers and revisions, is there a reason why 

\eTeXrevision has a period in it, like .2 

Hardly useful, that period (well, it means that one can test for 

  \ifnum\eTeXversion\eTeXrevision pt>2.2pt

or

  \ifnum\eTeXrevision pt>.2pt

but in that case \eTeXversion could have been 2.2 -)   

A consistent versioning system among etex pdftex aleph etc would make sense

I'll just note that for e-TeX 2.1 the value was ".1".  So likely a
carryover from that.

Subject: [tex-live] reducing cbgreek needs .fd's 
Message-ID: <200409021316.i82DGoT31544@f7.net>

The cbgreek fonts are one of the largest components in TeX Live, as
we've discussed from time to time.

Claudio (Beccari, the author) has agreed that it makes sense to have a
reduced set for distribution on physical media.  Hans has prepared
such a set:
http://www.pragma-pod.com/downloads/temp/cbsmall.zip

It includes 8/10/12pt design sizes of the commonly-used fonts, leaving
the rest to be scaled, and omitting invisible/upright fonts.  There are
plenty of other options for how to do the reduction, of course, but this
is the one that Claudio, Hans, Sebastian, and I reached consensus on.  I
suppose we can discuss if anyone feels strongly.

What's needed before we replace the current cbgreek are appropriate
LaTeX .fd files.  (Hans made the ConTeXt support files, not
surprisingly.)  It shouldn't be a big job to make the .fd's, for people
familiar with them.  Can anyone volunteer to do this (soon)?

Thanks,
karl

I updated those files in TeX Live (in

To solve the (in)compatibilities between Omega and e-TeX in the 
versioning system, Aleph comes with a whole BUNCH of version 
primitives:

\OmegaVersion returns the string 1.15
\AlephVersion returns the string 0-rc3

\eTeXversion returns the *number* 2
\Omegaversion returns the *number* 1
\Alephversion returns the *number* 0

\eTeXminorversion returns the *number* 1
\Omegaminorversion returns the *number* 15
\Alephminorversion returns the *number* 0

\eTeXrevision returns the string .1
\Omegarevision returns the string .15
\Alephrevision returns the string rc3


Note that this doesn't break backwards compatibility with any 
of Omega or e-TeX, so we may want to ask Peter to add 
eTeXminorversion to eTeX?

IIRC, it is also consistent with version numbers in pdf-TeX.

You do NOT want "release candidate" numbers like 'rc3' in
\Alephrevision.  A release candidate had better pretend in all but its
banner to the release.

    You do NOT want "release candidate" numbers like 'rc3' in
    \Alephrevision.  A release candidate had better pretend in all but its
    banner to the release.

Why do you say this?  It seems to me that the whole point of a version
number is to uniquely identify the release.

If you fake the version number to say it's version 2 when it's really

IMHO a "release candidate" specifically should have the behaviour of
the final product, with the exception of some printed banners.

But a release candidate for version two of an interpreter should, for
the purpose of (say) scripts that run on this interpreter, claim to
_be_ version two.  Otherwise the scripts are misled, or worse, the
scripts have to be made aware of the (typically non-standard and
non-numerical) version identification scheme used for "release
candidates".

Hi Martin,

Back on your 8/27 mail ...

    We have two open bugs, but I don't think they are showstoppers.

Does that mean you'll do the release with these present?

    I'm waiting for eTeX to do a release. 

As far as I can see, that could be months away.  I believe peb is still
away and anyway he'll want to thoroughly review/change/test things
before making any release.  So I think it is not feasible to wait.
(Bernd, if you think otherwise, please say ...)

Christian Schenk just wrote me saying that he's only waiting for the
pdftex update to do the miktex release ...

thanks,

Hi Daniel (and all),

    2) The script updmap is not launched automatically either.

I cannot reproduce this one.  As far as I can see, updmap is getting run
in either inst or live installs -- as long as texconfig gets installed.
I made some changes to the install-*.sh scripts to report it somewhat
more explicitly.  (I also made a lot of internal changes to unify common
code, please see if anything's newly broken.)

    3) When launching updmap by hand some entries are missing in
       pdftex.map and in psfonts.map:

Indeed yes.  Besides the ones you mentioned, there are half a dozen or
so others, notably including pl.map.  (Staszek, I was surprised --
should I not have added the TPM:Execute for pl.map?)  Complete list of
the tpm's I touched below.

I also deleted pandora and webomints, since their licenses are clearly
nonfree.

Please test again (after the rebuilds tonight) and see if problems
persist.  If updmap is still not getting run, please tell me exactly
what you're typing to the install script.

Thanks much,
karl

pdftex and could do a release immediately.

Hi Martin,

Message-ID: <87fz5ugdll.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

The etexdir subtree is updated to Peter Breitenlohner's latest
source.  Barring calamity this _is_ eTeX 2.2.

Following his lead, I've made an update to etc/autoconf/acspecific.m4:

        * etc/autoconf/acspecific.m4: Fix an ancient autoconf-2.13 bug
        (INSTALL_SCRIPT should default to INSTALL instead of
        INSTALL_PROGRAM, in case INSTALL_PROGRAM is defined as
        '${INSTALL} -s' from the command line or via "install-strip").

So configure scripts need to be regenerated (unless we decide we can
live with this as we have for quite some time).  The configure scripts
for texk, texk/kpathsea, and texk/web2c have been regenerated already.

Other source differences between the web2c master and TeX-live were
also fixed, though with some exceptions: certain windows-related files
were left alone (as I think this can be sorted out later) and
non-essential differences in depend.mk files are tolerated.

I've just submited new binaries for i386-linux.
We're still searching anybody who can build on sparc64-linux
(not to mention other platforms not updated since TL2003).

Thanks in advance for any help in that matter.

It seems to me Aleph is the last missing piece right now; though my

We have the TexLive distribution., which appears not to have the source
code for the latex command.

We are in need of an enhancement to the LaTeX command-line so that it will
read a list of tex filenames from either STDIN or disk and, for each
filename in the list, create a DVI file without forking and execing each
time.    We have 80,000 tex files to process for a typical run to create
80,000 dvi files.   Alternately, we could give it the name of a directory
and expect latex to process all the tex files in the directory.

We have the C expertise to make such an enhancement.

Please advise.     Thanks.

Hello,
I might sound harsh, but I doubt that the C expertise will be sufficient:
You should have found out meanwhile that latex isn't a program itself, but it 
is usually a link to a tex (or etex)-executable. Your TeXLive distribution 
certainly has the source files, could be in something named "CWEB" or "WEB". 
When all tex files use the same packages, you might be better off by 
generating a format file, which has all these packages preloaded, so that 
LaTeX doesn't need to read these every time. You could also prepare a minimal 
texmf tree, which contains just the necessary files for the run and hold it 
on a ram disk, that would speed up the process.

it might be just as easier to get a faster processor so that the execing

If you have 80,000 tex files. I don't mind betting that they are generated
by something. Rather than trying to change TeX to process multiple files,
you might go back in the process and create one huge file, run TeX on that,
and then split the dvi file into 80,000 small files using  a dvi 
manipulator,
or the like.

One is tempted to ask what you'll do with 80,000 dvi files, mind.

I agree with Sebastian on this.

I wrote a program, dvichop, that does just this.

It's on sourceforge, part of pytex.

Here's a couple of google links.

You might also want to consider running TeX as a daemon.

    which appears not to have the source
    code for the latex command.

It was left off the inst and demo discs by (a very bad) mistake.
It's on the live disc.  You can also download it, of course.
http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/live/source/ or from CTAN
(systems/texlive/Source).

However, as others have already suggested, I doubt you will find that
modifying the source to be a fruitful exercise.

     forking and execing each time.

My experience is that, these days, fork/exec are phenomenally fast and
almost never the bottleneck.  What is more likely the bottleneck is disk
accesses and the startup overhead of reading the databases, etc.
Reprogramming that would be a huge, huge, huge, job.  Being a C expert
is just the beginning.

Sebastian's idea of making one (or a few) big file(s) and splitting up
the result, and/or Alois's idea of putting everything on a ram disk,
seems more likely to accomplish what you need, with a lot less work.


Good luck,

Now, please.

    We're still searching anybody who can build on sparc64-linux

I thought Vladimir could do that.  Vladimir, are you there?
Tigran, can do you do x86_64-linux?
Baden, can you hook up i386-solaris and/or openbsd?
Manfred, freebsd?

I'll write Gerben now about the Mac build, he's been away.

Thanks,

Yes, I can do that. Though, I'm now in Palo Alto, CA where i'll be for

That should teach me to send the messages earlier ...

I checked in the update. Please note that the changes had to be 
slightly different than what I initially though, because of the 
way TeX hadles strings. I had to separate the strings in the 
pool file (the one returned by \<something>Version) from the 
ones that appear in the banner.

Let me know if I messed up badly with something.

(BTW, how do you *close* files you opened without submitting 
any changes, in perforce?)

alpha-linux is there.

What other architectures are missing, which one do not have a `builder'?
I have some space left so I can set up a minimal system here.

I have asked around here for
	i386-openbsd
	powerpc-aix (IBM RS/6000 AIX)
	sparc-solaris (Sun Sparc Solaris)
	sparc64-linux (Sparc Linux)
maybe I find a nice guy giving me an account here at the university at
one of the above archs where I can build the stuff.

I will report back.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0409082348550.23985-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

I'd like to sort out (at least for myself) doc trees layouts.
1. do we have any list of documentation files to be updated from the 
   sources in many texmf trees? Eg. NEWS and pdf-syntax.txt are updated
   only in the source tree.
2. some examples:
   texmf/doc/ contains doc files copied or prepared from the sources,
     right? The documentation here mostly describes the programs, like
     bibtex8, dvips, etc. and more general web2c and kpathsea.
   texmf-dist/doc/aleph and bibtex (but they are also programs).
   texmf-doc/doc/pdftex/ contains 3 files copied from the source tree 
     (NEWS, README and pdf-syntax.txt, not yet updated).
     I think that those files should be consequently in texmf/doc/
     or the whole pdftex/ should be rather moved to texmf-dist/doc/

Last thing: texmf-doc/ tree isn't declared in $TEXMF (texmf.cnf), so
texdoctk has no chance finding the files. I'm affraid that all
texmf* trees should be declared at least in texdocrc.defaults. Am I right?
Any idea?

    1. do we have any list of documentation files to be updated from the 
       sources in many texmf trees? 

Not that I know of :(.

       Eg. NEWS and pdf-syntax.txt are updated
       only in the source tree.

Hartmut has actually prepared a new version of the pdftex manual,
including pdf-syntaxt.txt.  I'll take care of checking that in when it
is stable.

   texmf/doc/ contains doc files copied or prepared from the sources,
     right? The documentation here mostly describes the programs, like
     bibtex8, dvips, etc. and more general web2c and kpathsea.

Right.

And texmf-dist contains documentation for the packages in texmf-dist,
and texmf-doc contains standalone documentation not part of any other
package.  That's the theory.  Implementation is, as always, imperfect.

   texmf-dist/doc/aleph and bibtex (but they are also programs).

The Aleph files should definitely be moved to texmf/doc, in my opinion.

Bibtex, hmm.  The base/ files seem like they should be moved to texmf.
(BTW, I just made btxhak.pdf and btxdoc.pdf.)

But the gost files don't seem like they belong in texmf.  Perhaps they
should be in texmf-dist/doc/latex/gost, instead of anything/bibtex?
How does that sound?

   texmf-doc/doc/pdftex/ contains 3 files copied from the source tree 
     (NEWS, README and pdf-syntax.txt, not yet updated).
     I think that those files should be consequently in texmf/doc/
     or the whole pdftex/ should be rather moved to texmf-dist/doc/

Moving all of texmf-doc/doc/english/pdftex to texmf/doc/pdftex (not
texmf-dist) sounds ok to me.  It is essentially documentation that comes
with the distribution.

    Last thing: texmf-doc/ tree isn't declared in $TEXMF (texmf.cnf), so
    texdoctk has no chance finding the files. I'm affraid that all
    texmf* trees should be declared at least in texdocrc.defaults. Am I right?

I've never used texdoctk, but what you say sounds plausible.  I don't
*think* we want to add texmf-doc into $TEXMF ... but maybe we should.

texdoctk searches in doc/ subtrees?  (Unlike everything else?)

If you'd like to move this stuff around, that would be great.

Thanks always,
karl

Akira Kakuto kindly submitted a patch that merged the latest changes
in tex.ch into omega and aleph, bringing all engines to the same point
for things like spaces in filenames and file:line:error style
messages.  The changes were reviewed by me and Giuseppe Bilotta.  I've
used the opportunity to bump the last digit of the omega version, so
we now have 1.23.2.3.  The 4-digit numbers in the description are

Do you really want to use LaTeX for this?  LaTeX carries a lot of 
overhead that makes like easier for writers, but I suspect those
80,000 tex files are being generated by some program.  In your place
I'd be looking at writing a minimal macro package as well as the
suggestions to combine files and split the .dvi later.  Is .dvi really
the final format?  Processing .dvi to PS or PDF is not easy -- I think
dvips has more lines of code than tex, and dealign with fonts is never
simple.

I found it comparing the output from strings: both programs have

No, because Aleph is still based on the 2.1 code :)

I hope to find the time to upgrade the codebase to version 2.2,
but I don't know when that will happen.

> btw. is there any ChangeLog or NEWS for Aleph? 

I try to keep eover.ch (eover-rc2.ch for the moment) up to date
with notes on what has been changed in each release.

Aleph does not use files in etexdir, and Giuseppe Bilotta
does not have changed etex-related codes.

Hi!

while building on AIX, i've got a bunch of errors while compiling
lcdf-typetools. It looks like the version in the source.development is
outdated (1.97, compared to current 2.12).

Could someone please grab the current lcdf-typetools package from
http://www.lcdf.org/type/ and put it into the texlive
source.development tree? That may resolve the compilation issues.

with regards to the fixes in etex .. aleph is not that sensitive for it since it uses the omega 32K register code (so it's no showstopper -)

Possibly, there is a libz 1.1.3 on Mac OS X 10.3.5. But since TeX Live 
carries its own libz, doesn't that mean that TL configure doesn't setup 
thihngs correctly?

Also part of TL. There is a libGoo.a in my TL tree. Another configure 
problem?

Possibly...  what you need to find out is where these symbols are
requested.  _That_ part may have been linked against the too-old libz.

>>> GHash::removeInt(GString*)

Check with 'nm' (or whatever) whether these symbols are defined in
libGoo.a.  They should be in GHash.o.  You may have to give an option
like '-C' to nm to get it to demangle symbols.

Also possible is that libfofi.a and libGoo.a should be on the link
line _in that order_.  (Ordering of libraries can matter.)

Message-ID: <MPG.1bafe8d131df07d79896e8@news.gmane.org>

Hello,

concerning the dumping of LaTeX-based formats, I have a (rather 
simple) requirement (I can't do the change myself because I 
don't have access to the .cnf files on the repository, I only 
have room for the /Build stuff on my HD :)).

"lambda" should still be dumped by Omega, and the Aleph format 
should be named "lamed" (I think that it's temporarily called 
alambda?). IOW, fmtutil.cnf should read

omega           omega           -       omega.ini
lambda          omega           language.dat    lambda.ini
lamed           aleph           language.dat    *lambda.ini

(and the Makefiles should be changed accordingly).

Subject: [tex-live] vptovf bug on Solaris platform
Message-ID: <OFE47629CA.44EA4D72-ON88256F0E.007674A1-88256F0E.007674A2@css.sfu.ca>

Hi TUG,

On July 30th, I reported a bug in the Solaris version of vptovf
in TeXLive 2003.  I received a message back stating that this is
a well-known bug, and referring me to
http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html.  From there, one can
download replacement binaries for mf, mf-nowin, gftopk, and
pktogf, but *not* vptovf.  Is there a replacement available
for vptovf?

Thanks,

John

Thanks Karl.  The older version of vptovf seems to work okay for
us.  We'll use that until TeX_Live_2004 comes out.

I think there is a layout-inconsistency here in TeX Live. The tool  
fmtutil is installed like the tool updmap from the Makefile in  
texk/tetex, but fmtutil.cnf is installed from texk/web2c and updmap.cfg  
is not installed at all.

I think it would be cleanest if fmtutil.cnf and updmap.cfg should be  
installed from texk/tetex's Makefile in combination with the tools  
(fmtutil and updmap), but I can live with any fix that makes the  
install work in a clean environment.

    Is there a replacement available for vptovf?

Sorry, I guess your message wasn't read carefully enough to realize that
the compiler bug affected vptovf as well.  All the other programs
were doing gf output.

I'll attach an older version of vptovf, maybe it will work for you.
sparc-solaris hasn't been recompiled since 2003, but it should happen soon.

Sorry for the trouble.

access was renamed to kpseaccess
readlink was renamed to kpsereadlink

This because the names collided with "standard" binaries on some
systems.

The installation on Solaris did not succeed. Here is a part of the error
message:

Updating filename database with mktexlsr...
/soft/texlive/bin/sparc-solaris2.7/mktexlsr: readlink: not found
/soft/texlive/bin/sparc-solaris2.7/mktexlsr: readlink: not found
/soft/texlive/bin/sparc-solaris2.7/mktexlsr: access: not found

Seems that mktexlsr still searches for readlink and access instead of
kpsereadlink and kpseaccess. And, Andreas told me that on his computer,
even kpsereadlink and kpseaccess are missing.

Yours

Weird.

That's an old mktexlsr script, as the current one really doesn't refer
to either 'access' or 'readlink'.  And the lack of both 'kpseaccess'
and 'kpsereadlink' suggests they were not installed from texk/kpathsea
for some reason.

The IRIX machine I do builds on does not have TeX-live installed at
all, and builds complete fine.  (I used to have to run 'make world'
twice but that seems to be fixed now.)

AFAIK updmap.cfg should already be in the texmf/web2c tree.  Arguably,
the same should hold for fmtutil.cnf.

I'd rather not see them installed from the source tree, for the same
reason I'd rather not see texmf.cnf installed from the source tree.
The versions we want are likely to be somewhat specific to TeX-live.

Did you resolve this?  Are changes required to the TeX-live sources to
keep this from happening a second time?

There is an entry in the web2c Makefile to put fmtutil.cnf there but 
updmap.cfg is not installed. Hence if updmap is called later it fails 
and so does the whole make process.

Certainly, but a 'make install' should work in a clean situation (it 
always did thusfar, including the creation of a texmf.cnf and a 
fmtutil.cnf). 'Make install' tries to run updmap and thus 'make 
install' needs a updmap.cfg (the same as with fmtutil). As it is now, a 
'make install' on my system fails because I run this in a 100% clean 
environment.

    Seems that mktexlsr still searches for readlink and access instead of
    kpsereadlink and kpseaccess. And, Andreas told me that on his computer,
    even kpsereadlink and kpseaccess are missing.

I believe sparc-solaris (among others) has simply not yet been
recompiled/reinstalled for 2004.  Vladimir said he would try to do that.

If anyone else can volunteer to do sparc-solaris (hopefully 2.6 or 2.7),
vvv might welcome the relief.

Vladimir, if you've gotten an unfair load in your hands, I'll have
a shot at sparc-solaris. I've been landed a huge project at work
and didn't think that would be possible; it might be, though.
This said, it'd have to be 2.8 or 2.9, as I have no 2.6 nor 2.7.
Comments?

Ok.  What I do to compile TeX-live is make sure that links to
texmf-dist (and texmf-doc) ara available, as well as a copy (writable)
of texmf and texmf-var.  This makes the compilation go smoothly.

A completely clean texmf will be lacking certain files, at present (in
particular, I think, the tcx files and updmap.cfg).

Note that I have no intention whatsoever of going back to shipping the
tcx files in the web2c source tarballs.  But arguably these should be
moved into texmf-dist/web2c (which currently doesn't exist at all).

For the config files that _can_ be installed from the source tree,
something like the code for texmf.cnf may be appropriate:

        if grep 'original texmf.cnf --' $(web2cdir)/texmf.cnf >/dev/null 2>&1 \
           || test ! -r $(web2cdir)/texmf.cnf; then \
          $(INSTALL_DATA) texmf.cnf $(web2cdir)/texmf.cnf; \
        else true; fi

What I don't understand is what has changed.  Has updmap.cfg been
removed?  Or is the running of updmap at make install the thing that's
new?  Or?  Thomas?

Anyway, Gerben, can you work around this for now to get on with making
the new binaries?  Like, just comment out calling updmap.  I can't see
that it does much good to call updmap in a "completely clean" hierarchy
anyway, since there won't be any fonts.

The intention behind texmf-dist/ is that it will hopefully remain
distribution independent. The reason why there is nothing web2c related
there.

Subject: [tex-live] sparc solaris binaries
Message-ID: <u4qm0nizy.fsf@vsu.ru>

Hi!

I've submitted sparc solaris binaries to the texlive depot.
They were built using GCC 3.3 on Sun Ultra 10 running Sun Solaris 2.8.
Please test.

I first compiled using the latest Sun Studio compilers, but apparently
the pdfetex binary then segfaults (tex still works). Pdfetex segfaults
somewhere at the statement like "somevar[0] = <somenumber>" where
"somevar" is something related to hyphenation table, and "somenumber"
is some constant big negative number. "somevar" points to some
inaccessible pointer like 0xf0000001. Sorry that i didn't copy the
exact info... Also, building using the Sun Studio required some small
changes - i had to change "inline" to "static inline" in
texk/dvipng/font.c and texk/dvipng/fontmap.c, and also commenting out
8 lines of declarations after the /* avl.c */ comment in
texk/web2c/pdftexdir/epdf.h (otherwise, the compiler complained about
duplicate typedefs for avl_comparison_func and avl_item_func declared
in other file. But using GCC it's not necessary anyway.

I still hope to build powerpc AIX binaries in the upcoming days, but
I'd like someone to update the lcdf-typetools first, because as I've
said the current version in texlive sources causes compilation
problems on AIX.

Best,
v.

No, the build ran before Vladimir checked in the new files.  (Thanks,

You can get the up-to-the-minute tree (both binaries and source) with
rsync, if you want it.  It's a little less than 2 GB.

When testing the TeXLive 2004 test version I have noticed that many
packages are outdated. Is it planned to go through CTAN and include recent
versions of the packages before releasing the final version of TeXLive?

For example, TeXLive includes
- numprint 1.13 of 2004/04/01, the current version is 1.32 of 2004/09/13,
- babelbib 0.44 of 2004/01/06, the current version is 0.45 of 2004/04/21.

Sebastian, does the procedure using the target texlive: in the Makefiles
work as expected?

Yours

During the last weeks, I had less time to work on teTeX / TeX Live than
usually, despite the fact that I have had vacation at home.

I have even hardly had any time to answer emails, that's the reason why
I have been so "silent". :-( I hope that I can update the lcdf-typetools
soon (this evening or one of the next days).

I'll soon update the lcdf-typetools. I never compile as root, so this
should be fixed after my update.

I forwarded this to Peter, and he sent an update by return mail, which

My experience is that you can get modtime issues regardless (esp. if
the tree was freshly checked out).  If autoconf or automake is called
during the build, timestamps are off.  You should just touch
'configure', 'Makefile.am', 'Makefile.in' (if present), then rerun
configure and make.

What version number?  What file?

Also, looking at the change, I'm not sure it will help William.  No more
segfault, but the table size is apparently not actually increased, and I
thought he needed more space.  Can we go from 10000 to 20000 (or
something)?

Hey I had never noticed, otp2ocp does not have a version number

Ok, it won't *really* help him, but at leat now he would know 
what's wrong with (and yes I already told him already).

I don't know if we could go from 10000 to 20000 (or anything 
else), because before doing this change I would like to have a 
better look at the Omega/Aleph side of things to see if those 
array sizes are a problem or not. Also, I'm not 100% sure 
that's the way to go since a properly written OTP shouldn't 
need that many instructions per state :)

I finnished the updating. #5871. So, whoever builds binaries, please,
update and check if it works for you.

It could also be a problem on the submitters side. I, for example, usually
work on a copy of the source tree if I make larger changes. Later, I run
diff and check in all changed files. That way, I have missed changed
timestamps of unchanged files.  Now, that I am aware of this problem,
I also check with "find -newer" for updated timestamps.

Anyway, lets hope that e.g. the updated lcdf-typetools work...

I updated these packages in TeX Live.  Let me know if you see problems ...

Based on info Sebastian sent me, I wrote a new file cdbuild/README which

Hi Harald,

     many packages are outdated. Is it planned to go through CTAN and
    include recent versions of the packages before releasing the final
    version of TeXLive?

Well, Sebastian brought everything up to date a couple months ago, but I
guess he missed numprint/babelbib.  I don't know if he'll have time to
do it again.

There is no easy way that I know of to comprehensively "go through CTAN"
and compare to TL (at present; the idea has been discussed for umpteen
years but no one has implemented anything), so I doubt that will happen,
as such.  I believe Seb has relied on ctan-ann in the past.

Anyway, I'll see if I can do numprint and babelbib, if Seb doesn't get
there first.  If there are any others you know of, let us know.

Thanks,
k

fmtutil.cnf is created according to the configure options given in the
source tree. updmap.cfg changes with the texmf tree (e.g. if a font family
is added) and the src tarball would be the wrong place to maintain that
file. I also don't want to install a dummy by "make install", because I
consider it dangerous to have such duplicates. It might be ok for gwtex,
as you have quite a lot of control over all texmf trees, but for teTeX,
I don't know where people actually unpack the texmf tarball (they *should*
create a texmf-dist, but I can't be sure).

So, I think that there are good reasons why things are as they are.
The build issues should have been resolved now.

Here are some more remarks:

- texmf-dist/tex/latex/interactiveworkbook contains a directory
  interactiveworkbook.sty/ which itself contains two style files. I guess
  this is not wanted.
- eurosans.sty is installed twice in different versions:
  tex/latex/eurofont/eurosans.sty and tex/latex/eurosans/eurosans.sty
- hfoldsty is outdated (1.01 instead of 1.11)
- microtype.sty is missing (a nice replacement for pdfcprot)
- KOMA-Script is outdated
- wrapft.sty is installed twice (different versions).
- acronym is outdated
- contour.sty is outdated.
- framed.sty is installed in a buggy version. Donald has prepared a new,
  better version which he, I believe, have not yet uploaded to CTAN. I am
  not sure what to do.
- hfoldsty is outdated.

There is nothing wrong about it. I have had discussion with Sebastian
because of missing documentation files with many packages. And we have
decided that it could help if the package authors provide a texlive:
target in their Makefiles. But it seems that the standard script does it
job now well.

xml is okay, of course. getversion.tex rather belongs to the source
directory. I will try to avoid it at all in future versions.

Yes, I have just noticed that. I will change it in future, too.

Everything is okay.

The new(?) web directory visible to p4 has symbolic links to absolute

absolute, so will dangle on almost every client.  Second, I believe
they dangle on the main server as well (they go to texmf/doc/pdftex,

That's my fault discussing it only with Karl, Martin and Sebastian.

For the TL CD/DVD production purpose I think that:
1. pdftex documentation should be in Master/texmf/doc/pdftex/
   -- not texmf-doc/, OK?
   (updated by hand, as usual, from source.development ;-)
2. .../web/pdftex/ can contain relative links, which (I hope) could

The current state is unusable.

Subject: [tex-live] lcdf-typetools breakage
Message-ID: <87zn3qa7of.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

Several problems with lcdf-typetools come up when compiling on IRIX:

In every Makefile.in we have

	mkinstalldirs = $(mkdir_p)
	...
	mkdir_p = @mkdir_p@

but since IRIX mkdir doesn't understand --version, code in configure
(from automake's mkdirp.m4) substitutes $(mkinstalldirs) for
@mkdir_p@.  As a result, installation fails.

However, the underlying problem is that as far as I can tell,
mkinstalldirs should have been defined like this by automake:

	mkinstalldirs = $(SHELL) $(top_srcdir)/mkinstalldirs



The other problem is that in .../otftotfm/glyphfilter.hh I needed to
define

inline bool
operator!=(const GlyphFilter::Pattern& a, const GlyphFilter::Pattern& b)

because it turned out to be required during template instantiation.
This may be a problem with the MIPSpro compiler or headers.

That's something special of TeX Live. teTeX has neither the texinfo
format for the pdftexinfo. texi2dvi does not need either of them.

Hi,

our department regularly uses the old English ampersand symbol (as an Irish
`agus') symbol.  The TeX archive has a wngbr font which provides this,
though it's not part of the TeX Live system.

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/fonts/wnri/

Having done some reading and tinkering, I've got it working reasonably well
(there are a few small syntax errors in the metafont which need correcting).

>From a purely selfish perspective I'd love a working version to be in the
TeX Live as it would mean our school need not install it as a customisation
each time.  Aside from that, it seems like it would be nice for other users
(and the font's author) to have it there, easy to use.

Are there very strict requirements for inclusion in the TeX Live?  Is the
CDROM short on space right now?  Would wngbr fit?  If yes, what would be
required to get it added?

Gavin

Hi Gavin,

    Having done some reading and tinkering, I've got it working
    reasonably well (there are a few small syntax errors in the metafont
    which need correcting).

Is wnri maintained?  The files haven't been changed since 1993.  Can you
write Tom Ridgeway (I think he's still there) and see if he'll take the
updates?  Or maybe he'd like you should take over the package from him
:).

Ironically, the http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/fonts/wnri/README.top
file says:

> This software is being released during the testing phase on a
> `need-to-know'' basis; please do not re-post this message in
> the view of the general public 

Oops :).

    it would mean our school need not install it as a customisation
    each time.  

FWIW, this would not be needed anyway.  You can install stuff in a
parallel texmf-local tree that is not touched (but is nevertheless used)
by new releases.  This is the recommended approach for local additions,
and the manual goes into some detail about it.

    Are there very strict requirements for inclusion in the TeX Live?  

The biggest issue is licensing.  In this case, some of the wnri files
have no copyright, but the ones that do say GPL, so that is good.  It
would be best if every file said GPL, but we don't need to be that
persnickety about it.

    Would wngbr fit?

It is small, so I don't see a problem with adding it.

It'd be best for your updates to get onto CTAN first, but we can
manually tweak them in if need be.

Thanks,
karl

But, please note, that I had to mess a little around. I have changed
configure.in and otftotfm/Makefile.am because we don't configure against
an installed kpathsea, but use the not-yet-installed version from the
source tree. Next thing was to add support for --enable-multi-platform
(Karl, you know this from texinfo).

After these changes, I have run autoconf, aclocal and automake (latest
versions) to update all depending files.

It appears doubtful alright.  I'm not a metafont expert though so I'm not
sure if I'd be a good person to maintain the package.

This is what we do.  However, we have lots of laptops, etc aside from the
central installation.  I've tried on occasion copying the full texmf-local
over but something always seems to get broken.  This is quite likely my
fault of course.  

It's just handy in my opinion to have as much as possible in the standard
install and keep texmf-local to a minimum.  Again being entirely selfish,
it minimises the number of tricks and customisations which our school needs
to maintain independently.

Fair enough.  I'l try and chase the last maintainer.

I see.  I'll do that then to start things off.  Can you point me to a doc on
submitting a package?  Are we talking basically about a tarball with
source, tfm, sty, etc relative to the texmf/ directory?

FYI: the problem seems present in the original source as well.
However, running automake should regenate that part of Makefile.in
"from scratch".  I find it helps to either use automake 1.9 instead of
1.8, or to copy mkinstalldirs into the lcdf-typetools directory before
running automake.

    I'm not a metafont expert though so I'm not
    sure if I'd be a good person to maintain the package.

You are touching the sources.  That makes you the best candidate around :).

    I see.  I'll do that then to start things off.  

In this case, since the package is already there, it would probably be
cleaner to update the files in the existing wnri than to make a new
package.  Therefore, writing Tom seems like the best first step.  (If
Tom isn't there, Pierre Mackay might be able to help; he is also at UW.
Let me know how it goes ...)

    Can you point me to a doc on submitting a package?  

http://www.ctan.org/upload, such as it is.

    Are we talking basically about a
    tarball with source, tfm, sty, etc relative to the texmf/ directory?

That works.  Depending on how big the package is, it's also sometimes
reasonable to just plunk everything in one directory.  

Also, for TL, it may be best to leave out the TFM's and just have them
created on the fly, as needed.  We can worry about that when we get
there.  It's still nice to have the tfm's on CTAN.

Thanks,
karl

Ok, I'll fix this. Does anybody know of a current GNU mirror which offers
rsync access? If my local copy on my disk would have had automake-1.9
instead of 1.8.5, this trouble could have been avoided...

    Does anybody know of a current GNU mirror which offers

Ha!  I just found one:
rsync rsync.nic.funet.fi::ftp/pub/mirrors/ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/

(More blah blah blah, feel free to skip. :)
Another longstanding project of mine is to get the GNU mirror
situation improved.

ibiblio.org does offer rsync.  But it is not up to date.  This is
because the GNU sysadmins said they would push content to ibiblio, and
haven't.  I asked the ibiblio person to resume using wget for now, but
he hasn't.

Most mirrors are also not updated.  The only one besides funet that I
know of with updated files is aeaneas.mit.edu (although it also has
obsolete files that have been deleted from the original).
planetmirror.com reported today that they fixed their GNU archive, but
it isn't.  (I told them.)

Exacerbating the situation is that the GNU sysadmins also have not
updated any file indexes for over a year, despite my repeated pleas.
And recursive dir's do not work.

We just ordered another disk for tug.org.  Maybe then we'll have enough
space to have a GNU mirror there.


I'll update http://www.gnu.org/server/mirror.html when there is news ...

I am running the new binaries against an old-style tree setup. I do

Hi,

I've tested to install  test-texlive2004-inst-20040916 on Solaris 2.8.

The Installation works without any errors, but after all there is no 
Master/bin directory, though it says at the beginning.

It seems, that the skript is just unpacking.

I find a check before calls to "clear", but the "fatal error message
box" has no such protection. Anyway, if such a "fatal error" happens,
you have a more serious problem anyway...

> I am running the new binaries against an old-style tree setup. I do 

pdftex no longer reads pdftex.cfg. If you run with the old .ini files,
you miss some defaults which should be dumped into the format. That's
where the new .ini files and pdftexconfig.tex come in.

And, we have the rearranged layout concerning map / enc files and the
drivers now use kpse_fontmap_format instead of kpse_dvips_config_format
for accessing map files.

All in all, I don't recommend this mixture of new binaries and old-style
tree.

What fun.  Now you get to do this again for lcdf-typetools 2.14.
(Eddie updated his source tree for the same reasons, plus the fix for

It's OK now. 

It fails with the fatal error below if it attempts to run aclocal-1.8, but if the
timestamps are correct, it doesn't try to do this, and all is fine. The warnings
were not the problem, the problem is in the line following these reports:

Huh?  cweb.c is in source (an error), but not in source.development.
I don't see hbf2gf.c in either source or source.development.

I have been so free to patch fmtutil.cnf in both Master and 
source.development and changed the engine on the line for mf to 
mf-nowin from mf. This makes the file more robust for systems where X11 
is more optional than others (i.e. Mac OS X where in the standard 
situation X11 is not running but a distributed binary of mf normally 
has X11 support compiled in).

Looks like te added the missing ; already.

BTW, since you are building, I should mention that I updated the C
sources for tex4ht a little while ago.  I wasn't able to test linking,
although they compiled ok.  Also Sebastian has to finish doing the texmf
side and I have some questions in to Eitan ... anyway, hope it doesn't
totally break.

here's another compilation error i'm getting:

xlC -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../../../TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/libefont -I.. -I../../../../../TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/include  -I../../../texk -I../../../../../TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/libefont/../../../texk  -O2 -qmaxmem=32768 -qarch=com -qlanglvl=extended -qcpluscmt -c -o afmparse.o ../../../../../TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/libefont/afmparse.cc

As for the previously reported error: it occurs because of this block
in TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/include/lcdf/vector.hh:

#ifdef HAVE_NEW_HDR
# include <new>
#elif defined(HAVE_NEW_H)
# include <new.h>
#else
static inline void *operator new(size_t, void *v) { return v; }
#endif

Commenting out the line "static inline void ..." fixes the problem,
BUT also I note that both these headers do exist (and autocong
correctly sets the HAVE_NEW_HDR and HAVE_NEW_H to 1 in config.h),
and the bug occurs because vector.cc fails to include config.h,
but nevertheless tests these macros.

Best,
v.

I fixed these by moving or adding "#include <lcdf/straccum.hh>" as a
first header included after config.h in:

TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/libefont/otf.cc
TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/libefont/otfcmap.cc

TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/libefont/otfname.cc

(yes, in some cases lcdf/straccum.hh wasn't included at all, yet
StringAccum was used).

There are other errors in lcdf-typetools to follow... :-(
This package has always been creating compilation problems :-(

Re the NHASH: it was declared in private class section in permstr.hh,
but apparently used outside of a class scope in permstr.cc which
resulted in undefined symbol. As a brute-force fix, i moved this
constant definition outside of the class. After this fix, cfftot1 was
successfully linked.

Re the duplicate operator +, it seems to be declared (or instantiated)
in cfftot1.cc and maket1font.cc (i didn't check since it's a warning).

I'm not sure if these are C++ bugs in lcdf-typetools or a deficiency
in IBM's compiler, since I'm not a C++ expert. :-)

Hi!

the texi2html script which is being built and installed into
Master/bin directories, contains meaningless references to directories
where it was built:

texi2html:my $prefix = '/home/noc/vvv/src/tl/res';
texi2html:if ('/home/noc/vvv/src/tl/res' ne '@' . 'datadir@')
texi2html:    $pkgdatadir = eval '"/home/noc/vvv/src/tl/res/texi2html"';

Obviously, it makes absolutely no sense because the system where it
will be run will not contain such directories. It should be fixed.

I think those are compiling time default paths in
"statically linked" libkpathsea from kpathsea/paths.h.
I think this feature has not been changed.

I didn't use these changes while building on AIX. But it wasn't a
final build, - i.e. I will rebuild all the sparc-linux, sparc-solaris
and powerpc-aix binaries once again when sources will really stabilize
and the final build request will be announced.

I may be mistaken whether previous year's build contained pardwired
paths from the build directory or from build-time texmf location
(though, i have an impression that it was not the case at least in
2002), but ANYWAY, it's totally WRONG to put such build directory
and/or build-time texmf location into the binaries, and this should be
fixed. Why do we have all the SELFAUTO stuff, after all? It's
absolutely pointless to put the hardwired paths into the binaries,
especially into the ones built for TeX Live. It's a garbage.

And the hardwired paths in texi2html script should be removed as well.

...just submited to p4. Please observe, that we have altogether 232
files (new htcontext and httexexec). I've changed patterns in
texmf/tpm/bin-tex4htk.tpm in that regard.
btw. I have no problems nor warnings concerning lcdf. I always use
fresh copy of source.development, compile as root using 
--prefix=/usr/TeX --with-x-toolkit=xaw, then remake statically
xdvi-xaw.bin. All that (somehow time consuming;-) work for binaries
which should work with many different Linux flavours.

Akira's right, these paths come from kpathsea/paths.h and are present
is all versions of TeX-live to date.  They're the defaults kpathsea
falls back on if no definition for a path is found in texmf.cnf, or
the texmf.cnf wants a "default" setting as well.  Otherwise they're
unused.

It's going to be fixed, but it is not a particularly high priority.

    the texi2html script which is being built and installed into

    where it was built:

I reported this to the texi2html maintainer.

I agree it's wrong/bad, but as long as the script works, I can't get too

Hi Vladimir,

always in the same way you did.  Then feel free to send me the warning report if

Eddie, thanks - i've tried the vanilla version 2.15 on AIX (i only
took configure, config.sub and config.guess from TeX Live), and it
compiles without errors.

Do you think that it's worth looking at the warnings? There are
primarily link-time warnings about duplicate symbols.

Best,

Send them along -- why not?  But the duplicate symbols are your compiler's fault 
I believe, inline functions should not generate link-time warnings.

Hi, 

Installed on sparc solaris 2.7 texlive from Master tree rsync'ed 2004-09-18
I assume it is the same as installing from texlive-live CD.

1. Installation worked, although produced lot of messages 
/opt/gnu/bin/tar: texmf/xdvi/xdvi.cfg: Could not create file: Permission denied 
(script attemts to copy many of the files several times) 

2. install-pkg-live.sh does not work:
ERROR: ./install-pkg-live.sh: /nobackup/texlive/Master/texmf-dist/tpm/lists

Also, it uses grep -v, this option is not supported at least by grep from solaris 2.7

3. psnfss.tpm does not contain *.sty files

4. pdflatex (sparc solaris platform) produces pdf with errors in
embedding fonts.  Here is Acrobat Reader's error message:  "Unable to
extract the embedded font 'ZWWGZN+CMSS10'. Some characters may not
display or print correctly."

pdflatex on windows platform (same texmf tree) -- no such problem.

Test example:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
test \small\sf test
\end{document}

5. It looks like Master/source/source.tar.bz2 is outdated

Ok, I have updated the TeX Live repository. Change #5930 gives us
version 2.15.

14200   i386-solaris2.8

26860   mips-irix6.5
37724   win32
48128   powerpc-darwin6.6
109312  alpha-linux


should the alpha-linux really be so large? looks to me as
if the binaries here are not stripped......

and what about the Mac ones? is that 48 mbytes right?

we are very over-budget on space for the CD

I doubt that SUN Solaris 2.7's grep does not support the -v option.

No,

pdf created by solaris pdfetex binries cause this error 
for both Acrobat 6.0 for Windows and Acrobat Reader 4.05 
for Solaris. 

pdf created by Windows binaries does not cause this error.

Can it be the problem found last year for TL 2003?
texmf.cnf should contain:
BSTINPUTS.bibtex8 = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/{bst,csf,}//

It seems that texmf.cnf produced by build doesn't have it, so use
texmf.cnf from Master/texmf/web2c/

Anyway, building bibtex8 should be cured. Anybody can help?
Thanks,

Good idea. Thanks. Thought I cannot see that Master/doc.html (something
went wrong?). In the meanwhile I'm discussing with Thomas Ruedas
how texdoctk could work with all those texmf/doc/ texmf-dist/doc/
and texmf-doc/doc/

If you add the following lines to include/lcdf/permstr.hh, just above the 
#endif, is the problem solved?

PermString permprintf(const char *, ...);
PermString vpermprintf(const char *, va_list);
PermString permcat(PermString, PermString);
PermString permcat(PermString, PermString, PermString);

Ah yes -- vectorv.cc should begin with #include <config.h>.

With those problems solved, do you get further on?

What I do not understand is why bibtex8 would need a
	BSTINPUTS.bibtex8 = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/{bst,csf,}//
entry when there is a
	BSTINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/{bst,}//

Is this really _only_ on Solaris?

By the way, aren't the formats wrong here for the second and third
cases?  Those should be kpse_bst_format, unless we want to break out a
kpse_csf_format at this point in time...

texk/bibtex8/utils.c:

        case BIB_FILE_SEARCH_PATH:
#ifdef KPATHSEA
          status = ((full_filespec = kpse_find_file(filename, kpse_bib_format, false)) == NULL);
#else
            status = find_file (BIB_INPUT_ENVVAR, BIB_INPUT_PATH,
                                filename, full_filespec);
#endif
            break;
        case BST_FILE_SEARCH_PATH:

          status = ((full_filespec = kpse_find_file(filename, kpse_bib_format, false)) == NULL);

Since is this is obviously a bug, I've made the change without further
ado.  If you want a separate kpse_csf_format, let me know.  If this
does or doesn't fix the problem, make some noise.

Ok, by removing all
	include .deps/clp.Po
and 
	mkdir .deps
in all the subdirs of Work/.../lcdf-typetools it worked. Strange.

On Mac OS 10.2.8 (darwin 6.8) I get:
TL2003: 50MB
TL2004: 60MB
stripped:
TL2003: 37MB
TL2004: 41MB

If I look at pdfetex with otool, it turns out everything is linked in 
statically, except the system library. A shared library setup is 
dangerous for a system which is distributed as binaries, so I am 
somewhat reluctant to change this.

PS. bzipped, the binaries of TL2004 take 17MB.

    Installed on sparc solaris 2.7 texlive from Master tree rsync'ed
    2004-09-18 I assume it is the same as installing from texlive-live CD.

It is not quite the same, but it is close enough to be useful.

    1. Installation worked, although produced lot of messages 
    /opt/gnu/bin/tar: texmf/xdvi/xdvi.cfg: Could not create file: Permission denied 
    (script attemts to copy many of the files several times) 

Strangely, this does not happen for me (on i386-linux).  (It happened in
previous releases, though.)  Can you please tell me exactly what
commands you give to the install script, so I can try to reproduce?

It would be bizarre to me that it only happened on sparc, although I
suppose anything is possible.

    4. pdflatex (sparc solaris platform) produces pdf with errors in
    embedding fonts.  Here is Acrobat Reader's error message:  "Unable to
    extract the embedded font 'ZWWGZN+CMSS10'. Some characters may not
    display or print correctly."

Martin or Hans or anyone, do you have any insight into this?

Thanks,
karl

A lot of these are probably different interpretations of the C++ standard.  For 
instance the StringAccums: there WAS a previous declaration, but in a "friend 
class".  But whatever.  See next mail...

I got the same errors in i386-linux. Who can correct the sources?

I believe the build is now fixed again:

Since installing from Mater tree is not exactly the same, I  installed
from cd images  test-texlive2004-live-20040920.iso and
test-texlive2004-inst-20040919.iso. Previous installations were
completely deleted. I ran script install-tl.sh in both cases, chosen
default (did not change any suggested options). 

With test-texlive2004-inst-20040919.iso everything clean. 

With test-texlive2004-live-20040920.iso installation worked, but I got
same numeros error messages as I mentioned before, example: 
/opt/gnu/bin/tar: texmf/web2c/pdfxtex.pool: Could not create file: Permission denied

In this case, (readonly) file texmf/web2c/pdfxtex.pool was already
installed, since it is listed in several collections installed by default.



I tried install-pkg again (from both inst and live), it did not work: 

$ install-pkg.sh --listonly --collection=latexextra

ERROR: ./install-pkg.sh: /texlive/cd/texmf-dist/tpm/lists: no such directory. Are you sure this is the TeX Live CD?.
This was a fatal error. Installation aborted.

This is from source.development @2004/09/17:23:00:00 so I need to do 
this another time later to get the final version. I have updated a 
bzipped tar archive to 
ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/tl2004-macosx-build.tar.bz2. 
Contains bin, lib, man, in other words, everything created by make 
install.

Which reminds me: are we goiing to fix the inconsistency between bin 
being multiple-architecture while lib is not? It is not that crucial, 
but it has always struck me as a nonperfect situation.

Um, there has never been a lib/ in TL, that I know of?

Anyway, I don't think we should make any far-reaching structural changes

The error happens even in simplest document with one font. If file

I had been wondering about that. Why aren't the symlinks created by my 
'make install'?

Is it the first or last font in the pdf that is a problem?

Does 'pdflatex small2e' demonstrate the problem?

Does the following document demonstrate the problem?

  \documentclass{article}
  \begin{document}
  1
  \end{document}

Mostly first, but could be second or more if there are much more fonts.

Ah, now it sounds familiar. Adrian Lanz has reported the same to
pdftex@tug.org (09 Aug 2004, he uses SUN Solaris 9 / gcc 3.3.2).

Perhaps it is a compiler bug, since it does not happen on other
platforms.  As a test, can you easily try compiling the sources yourself
(since you wrote to me about this before...), with whatever gcc you
might have?  I advise no optimization.  

FWIW, the current version of gcc is 3.4.2.

    /opt/gnu/bin/tar: texmf/web2c/pdfxtex.pool: Could not create file:
    Permission denied

Is it some kind of permission problem?  In my daily test installation
(from the live tree, resulting in
ftp://tug.org/texlive/Contents/testinstalled/), the files in texmf/web2c
are installed as mode 644, so they can get overwritten without
complaint.  Are your files mode 644?  Doesn't make sense to me, though.

Do you have any other flavors of Unix on which you can?  The Windows
installation process is completely different (and in flux), so it
doesn't really help narrow down bugs in the Unix install to try it
there.

Try selecting the "basic" scheme (to minimize the install) and send me
the entire session transcript, ok?

Hmm.  If this whole process copies the same files several times, that
seems pretty bad.  I thought there was code that tried to prevent it.
Maybe that is the problem.

Thanks,
karl

well, all files are 444 on live CD and are installed with this mode 
(even if mode would be changed afterwards, same file are copied

Yes, I had exactly the same problem recently installing teTeX-beta
2.96.7.20040721. In my case, the symptom was that pdflatex run without
error, but a wrong /Length1 parameter was inserted in the PDF output
file, which evidently caused Acrobat Reader's error message (no
problem, however, with xpdf or with the "dvips -Ppdf" routine).

I think I solved the problem by changing the order and rules how
shared libraries are found and handled on my Sun Sparc Solaris 2.9
system, and/or I may have re-installed some programs and libraries
(ncurses, gettext, libiconv). I am sorry not being more specific on
what I did exactly to solve the problem (could also have been a gd
problem?). At the moment, the working configure for teTeX-beta seems
to be:

 	./configure --prefix=$MY_LOCAL/teTex$MY_TETEX_VERSION \
 	    --disable-multiplatform \
 	    --without-texinfo \
 	    --with-system-ncurses \
 	    --with-ncurses-include=$MY_LOCAL/include/ncurses \
	    --with-system-zlib \
	    --with-system-t1lib \
	    --with-system-pnglib \
	    --with-system-gd >00-configure.output 2>&1

Could be that the "--with-ncurses-include=" option is the important
one?

With regards to shared library handling, I use:

LD_RUN_PATH=<path to gcc libraries>:<library path to where I installed
many basic GNU and other tools and
programs>:/usr/lib:/usr/lib/sparcv9:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/openwin/lib/sparcv9

LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64=/usr/lib/sparcv9:/usr/openwin/lib/sparcv9

LD_CONFIG=<personal ld.conf file>

ld.conf file (using crle program): <path to gcc libraries>:<library
path to where I installed many basic GNU and other tools and
programs>:/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/local/lib:<path to
libraries of system-wide installed programs>

During installation of GNU and similar tools and programs which I
install myself, I link LD_CONFIG to an alternative ld.conf file
containing the following paths: <path to gcc libraries>:<library path
to where I installed many basic GNU and other tools and
programs>:/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib

Bye, Adrian.

What was the intention behind the changeset 5974 deleting more or less

Should I put it back in?

Seems like we might as well check in your binaries, Maksym.  (And go

This looks to be some sort of quoting bug.  I don't have a
sparc-solaris2.7 machine any more, and I couldn't reproduce in a
standalone test on 2.8, and the script seemed to work on Linux.  Does it
work for you if you run "bash install-pkg..."?

Anyway, looking at the code, the problematic construct seemed to be
  eval grep "\!"

I changed the " to '.  Maybe that will help.

If it still fails, please send me the output of sh -vx install-pkg...

Yes. And this is also how I lost the links initially, the strip command 
made a copy and thus destroyed the symlinks. So I now need to create a 
script that checks for non-symlink before trying to do the strip.

I was wondering if we could not remove the -g flag from a normal 
compile. Who is debugging anyway? Developers? But they have deep 
control over what is happening anyway. So, why shouldn't the default 
build not be without symbols and optimized?

On many platforms stripping a binary will make it smaller even if it
wasn't compiled with -g.  Trivial example:

$ cc -O2 tst.c -o tst-O2
$ cc -O2 -g tst.c -o tst-O2-g
$ ls -l tst-*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 olaf     olaf        11799 Sep 25 11:18 tst-O2*

$ strip tst-O2
$ strip tst-O2-g
$ ls -l tst-*

Thomas Ruedas kindly corrected texdoctk, so it can work now with our
texmf-dist and texmf-doc trees. I tested it on 3 linux boxes and decided
that the last version (sent by Thomas before leaving for 1.5 week)
is enought robust to add to p4 depot. I hope that Thomas Eser has no 
objections...

Change 5996 on 2004/09/26 by staw@staw

     new texdoctk working with -dist, -doc trees; changed in source,
     source.development, bin-i386-linux, texmf/scripts/tetex/texdoctk.pl;
     texmf/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat corrections

I think that texdoctk can be also propagated to other already compiled
platforms. As I see, in win32 is missing texdoctk.exe wrapper (Fabrice?).
I made also many corrections to the database (texdoctk.dat), but
not checked all items.

All the best,

formats have to be created using the right search paths. Everything
else will fail. A system taht is as large as TeX Live cannot work if
applications pick files from arbitrary places of the texmf tree.

All latex based formats (besides lambda and lamed) should have search
paths which make sure that tex/latex// is searched before tex/lambda//
and tex//.

I don't see a problem. Not even a license problem. That "strange"
ltpatch.ltx is not derived from a file which is covered by lppl, so the
lppl does not apply.

    Is this a known problem? xdvi segfaults when I hit `k' in expert
    mode (without buttons). Output:

FWIW, this does not happen for me under Red Hat 9.  (Same xdvi-xaw.bin;
I just started it, hit k; no crash.)

"omegabook" is a package I put in for the book on Omega last year
(a book which noticeably  broke the license conditions,
and whose publisher did not even bother to respond to my complaint).
I have zapped it. It is no more. It is a dead package.

Unfortunately I can't (and valgrind doesn't complain either). The
trace looks like a corrupted stack, so maybe there's something wrong
with vsnprintf() (or the way I'm using it). I'll try to send Siep
some debugging code for testing in a separate mail.

Here's an update on the xdvik segfault: Thanks to Siep, I could
find the error (multiple calls to vsnprintf() without calling
va_start()/va_end() again). I released a new version,
xdvik-22.84.4, which should fix that bug, available from the
usual places:

When compiling outside the srcdir, mksedscript does not find the CHANGES

Not to mention head -n.  Maybe both are portable enough, since we're not

Hi there,
I tried to build binaries for FreeBSD 4.10 STABLE.

Unfortunately, configure failed.

Here is what I did (I'm not quite sure if the sequence of comands is
correct):

cd /data/TeXCol/depot
rsync --recursive --exclude=Images tug.org::tldevsrc

cd Build/source
# ln ... in order to point to a texmf source tree
ln -s /usr/TeXLive/texmf texmf/

sh Build

.....
running /bin/sh ./configure  --prefix=/data/TeXCol/depot/Build/source
--datadir=/data/TeXCol/depot/Build/source --enable-multiplatform
--srcdir=.
: not found
./configure: 20: Syntax error: "elif" unexpected (expecting "then")
configure: error: ./configure failed for utils/lcdf-typetools
configure: error: ./configure failed for TeX



I also tried  from Build/source.developmen but it wasn't better.

Hi Manfred,

    cd Build/source
    ...
    : not found
    ./configure: 20: Syntax error: "elif" unexpected (expecting "then")
    configure: error: ./configure failed for utils/lcdf-typetools

Do you get the same error in source.development?  You shouldn't.  An
"elif" error in lcdf-typetools was fixed in source.development a couple
weeks ago, I presume it's the same one.  (Among other things.)

The lcdf-typetools/configure starts like this:

    ... 11 lines of comments ...
    12	if test -n "${ZSH_VERSION+set}" && (emulate sh) >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    13	  emulate sh
    14	  NULLCMD=:
    15	  # Zsh 3.x and 4.x performs word splitting on ${1+"$@"}, which
    16	  # is contrary to our usage.  Disable this feature.
    17	  alias -g '${1+"$@"}'='"$@"'
    18	elif test -n "${BASH_VERSION+set}" && (set -o posix) >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    19	  set -o posix
    20	fi

So the elif is at line 18, not 20.

Or perhaps it is a shell problem?  Can you try running bash configure in
lcdf-typetools, just to see?

Thanks,
karl

I found it: The file ./TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/configure contained dos
line ends. After running dos2unix it worked. 

I have no more error coming from another place. Have to figure out
what's going on before posting.

Hi,

I am trying to rebuild TeX Live from the latest sources and the Build 
fails with error:

# ./Build 
configure: error: can not find sources in .. or ..

Looking in the configure script I see that it checks for the file 
TeX/texk/web2c/tex.web which doesn't exist.

# ls TeX/texk/web2c/tex.web
/bin/ls: TeX/texk/web2c/tex.web: No such file or directory

I checked both Build and Master and it's not anywhere. So, how do I 
proceed? Has the build procedure changed substantially?

Kind regards
Tigran

Message-ID: <3FE1403D1498CA4EAD65CAB5B030F875016AEE@mcao5.mcao.net>

Hello,

I have intalled TeXLive edition 9/2003 to run in my Windows 2000 system. I
selected the full installation.

I am trying to have TeX (the one that is part of TeXLive) be able to find
certain macro files that I have located outside the TeXLive directories. (In
my case, they are in C: "Program Files"\PCTeX\PCTeXv5".)

I edited the TEXMF.CNF file to include the following:

TEXINPUTS.tex =
./;$ProgramFiles/PCTeX/PCTeXv5//;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//

Please note that $ProgramFiles is an environment variable that is set to
"C:\Program Files".

This much I verified with the command

Hi Tigran,

    Has the build procedure changed substantially?

No, it hasn't changed at all.

    TeX/texk/web2c/tex.web which doesn't exist.

Yes, it is there, and has never moved.

tug$ ls -l /home/tlprod/Build/source.development/TeX/texk/web2c/tex.web

I surmise something went wrong with your p4 checkout.

Maybe remove everything inside web2c, and do p4 sync [-f] again?
Or use rsync -a to get the files and forget p4.

Hope it flies ...

Hi Manfred,

    sed 's/__VERSION__/4.7/g' >texinfo.cat
    sed hangs.

BSD make apparently doesn't expand $< in regular rules, annoyingly.

I changed utils/texinfo/util/Makefile.am to avoid this.

I also changed Makefile.in, so if the timestamp gods are feeling
friendly, automake/autoconf won't have to be rerun, just configure.  You
can also just change the line:

	sed 's/__VERSION__/@VERSION@/g' $< >$@
to
	sed 's/__VERSION__/@VERSION@/g' $(srcdir)/texinfo-cat.in >$@
        
if you want.

Hope it flies ...

Not that I know of.  It would be nice.

Are there other things to change besides local map/enc files?

BSD make is different to GNU make which is the binary gmake on BSD if
installed as port: gmake-3.80_2

Did you run `mktexlsr' ?

Hi George,

    tex is unable to find the file mac1--even though it is in the
    directory tree which I specified in the TEXINPUTS variable.

I don't use Windows, so maybe someone else has a better answer, but here
are the two things that come to mind off the top of my head:


Alternative #1: put !! before the $ProgramFiles in texmf.cnf, as in:
./;!!$ProgramFiles/PCTeX/...etc...


Alternative #2: create an ls-R file in the pctex directory.

GUI: Start -> Programs -> TeXLive -> Maintenance -> Rebuild ls-R
or manually run the \file{mktexlsr} command.

I'm not sure if it will automatically notice that directory and build an
ls-R in it.  You may have to cd to it (in a DOS shell) and run :
  mktexlsr .

Hope this helps,
karl

Top-level etex, pdftex, pdfetex, omega etc. have to be merged into
top-level tex.  Maybe, I have forgotten something. I suggest that you
ask the maintainer of the tds document. He must know it ... :-)

Just "\Program Files"?
Not "C:\Program Files"?

tex -kpathsea-debug=-1 sample

will print a lot of debugging info about what is searched where.  This
may help tracking down the problem.

I guess this means I should work fast on some package updates then!

Looking closer at the texmf-dist tree I see that "empheq" and "mh" in the
doc/latex tree have been screwed up. This is my fault as I decided to move
empheq on ctan. Anyway, the empheq tree should be removed completely and
the file ntheorem.fix should be moved to tex/latex/mh as it is a runtime
file.

Would it be easier if I constructed a makefile for the next release?

Cheers,

AUCTeX has had no good release in the 11.5x series concerning XEmacs.
And preview-latex has gathered a few fixes in CVS that could make use
of pushing out (I need to do a fix still that concerns inclusion of
dvips -E generated images) before we move preview-latex completely
into AUCTeX (after which there will be construction site state for a
while to come).

What are the chances of getting fixes like that into the
XEmTeX-related parts still?

I'm writing to inquire re: licensing and obtaining the latest version
of TeXLive.

In checking the downloadable images at ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/
it looks as though there were some test-burns this morning (named
"test-texlive2004-live-20040930.iso", e.g.).  Am I to infer from this
that the 2004 distribution is due out soon?

Also, I work at an academic institution in the United States.  Re:
licensing, my understanding is that TeXLive is available under the GPL
-- and as such, am I free to install that on lab machines on my
college campus for student use (as long as the source code is made
available)?

Please let me know, and thank you in advance.

Out soon, yes, but how soon is not specified. THe binaries are not
completely rebuild, but AFAIK i386-linux, solaris, alpha-linux, and
win32 (???) builds are uptodate.

In fact all the programs and packages available on TeXlive have to be
licensed under a Debian approved license.

Yes, definitely! The source code of the binaries are included in tar.gz
on the cdroms.

Hi Adam,

We can only hope.

And/or FSF.  (There are unfortunate discrepancies between the two, but
let's not waste our time on it.)

    norbert> AFAIK i386-linux, solaris, alpha-linux, and
    norbert> win32 (???) builds are uptodate.

Not quite.

i386-linux, alpha-linux, mips-irix are up to date.

sparc-solaris, powerpc-darwin, powerpc-aix and sparc-linux are almost
up to date (just missing the xdvi fix, I think).  w32 is a bit older.

x86_64-linux, i386-freebsd, i386-solaris, i386-openbsd are all old.
(Sebastian, Baden, any hope for the latter two?)

   adam> am I free to install that on lab machines on my college campus for

Yes, although I highly recommend doing some testing first :).  Let us
know if problems.

To the best of our knowledge, everything on TL is "freely available".
It's definitely not all GPL'd, specifically -- for instance, LaTeX and
most LaTeX packages use the LPPL.  Knuth's originals have their own
unique license.  Etc.

We don't autoupdate the source.tar.bz2 file in the ISO images, although
we won't complain if that's what you tell people about.  (We should fix
this sometime.)  Meanwhile, the current sources are always available via
p4, rsync, etc., FWIW.

    Would it be easier if I constructed a makefile for the next release?

Maybe so.  The .fix file is a special case that the script won't know
how to do handle.

With input from Sebastian and Harald, I recently wrote a web page on
this; please see http://tug.org/tex-live/pkgcontrib.html for some
information and examples.  (Comments welcome.)

If there is real need for i386-openbsd, I can contact the
maintainer of the teTeX-port for openbsd like I did before.

    If there is real need for i386-openbsd, 

I have no feel for whether there are openbsd users of TeX Live or not.
I've never seen a bug report from one.  Does anyone else have any info /
intuitions?

    I can contact the maintainer of the teTeX-port for openbsd like I

Thanks Martin.

Manfred, I think the easiest way for you to get past this error will be
to simply comment out the typedef in t1asm.c.  Looks like t1disasm.c has
the same typedef, maybe other places too.

Eddie, for a long-term fix, you could either configure a check for that
type and avoid declaring it if the system does (Manfred is compiling on
FreeBSD), or, more simply, use another name for your unsigned short type
that systems will not define, like my_uint16.  <anything>_t is
technically reserved by the !@#$ standards.

Hi Karl!

I don't know what version Manfred is using, but t1utils has used the 
system uint16_t since version 1.24, in September 2001.  I suggest that 
whoever is responsible (Manfred himself or TeXlive or god knows what ;) 
) upgrade to the current 1.32.

Eddie

I'm a bit confused. Could it be that I got rubbish when I tried 
rsync -v -a --exclude=Images tug.org::tldevsrc .

I had a look at last years source.tar.bz2. There t1asm.c definitely
didn't have any typedef for uint16_t.


It seems it doesn't make sense to continue until I know what I have.

t1utils in TeX Live claims to be of version 1.31 (according to file
NEWS), but the files t1asm.c and others differ from the official
distribution's version by hacks added by Fabrice.

E.g. here is the diff of t1asm.c from t1utils-1.31 and from texlive:

I asked Fabrice long time ago about this, and he said that he needed
these changes (re CDECL) and i may have forgot, but seems that he said
that he tried to contact Eddie on this.

Apparently, Fabrice did not do a very good job in syncing his changes
with official version and forgot to remove the typedef.

This shows that it's a very bad idea to have hacked inofficial
versions in TeX Live. We should ALWAYS send the changes upstream,
otherwise it will become a maintenance nightmare.

Best,
v.

	TeX (TL7)
Message-ID: <3FE1403D1498CA4EAD65CAB5B030F875016AF3@mcao5.mcao.net>

Hello,

Thanks to all readers for the help with my initial difficulties with
TeXLive. It is working now.

I am now trying to create a Russian-English version of TeX. I think all the
pieces I need are already included in my installation (I did the full
installation), but I cannot seem to follow the instructions that I have
found within some of the separate packages. For example, the readme file of
cyrplain.

The version of TeX I wish to have will need to handle Russian and English
text with proper hyphenation. At this point, I don't have any special
requirements for encoding, as I will be simply producing Russian/English
texts with the fonts available in the TeXLive distribution of 9/2003.

I do not use LaTeX.

Could someone give me some assistance in doing this? I have the feeling it
is not that complicated because the files are already in place in my system,
however, I do not understand the jargon well enough to make use of it.

With sincere thanks,
George Stewart

Thank you for checking into this, Vladimir.
Based on that, I changed those typedef's to be #ifdef WIN32, so we can
get on with life.
(Although a cleaner solution would be to configure for uint16_t, I
guess; it wouldn't surprise me if some Unix systems lacked it as well.)

Manfred, can you try compiling again now, please?

Eddie, will you accept the changes?  The CDECL stuff is ugly but
harmless, just is an empty #define on non-Windows.  If so, Vladimir,
could you send a diff please?  Since you already have the trees set up.

Thanks,
karl

Message-ID: <3FE1403D1498CA4EAD65CAB5B030F875016AF4@mcao5.mcao.net>

This supercedes my previous message.

I am trying to make russified version of Plain TeX.  I think I have all the
files in place, after reading readme from cyrplain folder.

I edited makefmts.bat so that it makes only one format file, the one I want,
which is cyrplain.fmt.

But when I try to run the batch file, I get an error.  The batch file
contains the following command:

   tex386.exe -i -8 -o -mt18000 cyrtex.ini

However, my TL7 does not include tex386.exe instead it has tex.exe.

Additionally, the arguments to tex do not include -i and -8 and mt18000. I
assume there are equivalent arguments for the tex that I have but the  tex
-help does not tell me which to use (I assume -i equates to -ini, but
otherwise I am in the dark).

Please help.  Thanks!
George
