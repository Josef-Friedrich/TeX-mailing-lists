i just looked into the consequences and it means that i have to 
re-reorganize my trees as well as to patch texfont and friends again ... so 
before i start that advanture once more i want to make sure of a few things 
(therefore the c to the tex live list):

Can we be sure that this is the final change, i.e. we now have:

   - dvips
   - pdftex
   - dvipdfmx

since they all seems to understand the same encoding file syntax, i wonder 
what the encs do under /dvips/enc, unless we consider dvips to be generic 
like we do with tex; in the (maybe not even that far feature) there may be 
support for different font mechanisms and so i wonder if the organization 
should be more long the lines

   fonts/enc/ps
   fonts/enc/svg
   fonts/enc/cid

and alike. This would also more force applications to follow similar rules 
(syntax and so); in the end we may well end up with xml definitions and 
interfaces to 'font characteristics databases'. So, if we are now in 
'reorganization mode', why not clear up the differences between dvips, 
pdftex and dvipdfmx as well?

I ask this because in texfont, currently the enc/map subpaths are kind of 
hard coded:

my $afmpath = "$fontroot/fonts/afm/$vendor/$collection" ;
my $tfmpath = "$fontroot/fonts/tfm/$vendor/$collection" ;
my $vfpath  = "$fontroot/fonts/vf/$vendor/$collection" ;
my $pfbpath = "$fontroot/fonts/type1/$vendor/$collection" ;
my $ttfpath = "$fontroot/fonts/truetype/$vendor/$collection" ;
my $mappath = "$fontroot/fonts/map" ;
my $encpath = "$fontroot/fonts/enc" ;

I wonder what logic to apply in figuring out how to use:

my $mappath = "$fontroot/fonts/dvips/map" ;
my $encpath = "$fontroot/fonts/dvips/enc" ;

and/or:

my $mappath = "$fontroot/fonts/pdftex/map" ;
my $encpath = "$fontroot/fonts/pdftex/enc" ;

since i need to choose, should i randomly choose between them? There is no 
way to ask kpsewhich 'give me the prefered pdf map file path for this 
particular kind of map file'.

With regards to the map file, if there are differences between 
dvips/pdftex/dvipdfmx, i have a problem with putting the files under dvips 
since they are actually meant for pdftex; i'm not sure what the difference 
in syntax is you refer too, (maybe the missing FontNames, but dvips should 
be able to handle this). What is the minimal format that all those programs 
understand?

Also, if there are differences, what exactly is the 'prefered search 
structure than'?

dvips  -> first dvips  subpath, then pdftex search path, then dvipdfmx subpath
pdftex -> first pdftex subpath, then dvips  search path, then dvipdfmx subpath

etc? Or will can there be duplicate filenames in each path?

(btw, the coming version of context will, more than in the past, load 
mapfiles on demand, so in a next tex live i may as well omit the map files 
and include them in tex directly, but that would render texfont useless for 
other than context)

We also have xdvik, dvipdfm, dvipng. I am not sure if other programs
also support type1 rendering based on "dvips-like map files + enc files".

dvips/enc? I don't know what you mean.

> my $mappath = "$fontroot/fonts/map" ;

If the map files don't use specific pdftex related features, they should go
to $fontroot/fonts/map/dvips/<package>.

> my $encpath = "$fontroot/fonts/enc" ;

That should be $fontroot/fonts/enc/dvips/<package>.

> my $mappath = "$fontroot/fonts/dvips/map" ;
> my $encpath = "$fontroot/fonts/dvips/enc" ;

We have fonts/<type>, no dvips subdirectory.

> my $mappath = "$fontroot/fonts/pdftex/map" ;
> my $encpath = "$fontroot/fonts/pdftex/enc" ;

Again, fonts/<type>, no pdftex subdirectory.

> since i need to choose, should i randomly choose between them?

Choose dvips if you don't make use of specific features.

The planned new TDS says:
    The \abbr{TDS} also reserves the names \path|enc|, \path|lig|,
    and \path|map| for font encoding, ligature, and mapping files,
    respectively.  All of these directories are structured the
    same way, with \replaceable{syntax} subdirectories, and then
    \replaceable{package} subsubdirectories.  Each of these file types
    is intended to be searched along a single recursively-searched path.
    The names of the actual files must be unique within their subtree,
    as usual.

So, basically, this means that you can just access map files by their
name, regardless of their precise location.

The first level under fonts/map describes the "syntax" of the file. pdftex
has followed dvips in map file syntax (and slightly extended it), so
I recommend that map files that don't make use of any extensions should
be put into fonts/map/dvips. This does not mean that this map file is
for exclusive use of dvips.

> i'm not sure what the difference

A map file for dvips always has the FontNames and it does not make use
of the special bits that have been introduced by pdftex.

> What is the minimal format that all those programs

Look at the documentation of dvips.

> structure than'?

See above. We require that all names below fonts/map are unique.

Just forget about subpath. There is just texmf/fonts/map//.

I don't make any use of the texfont utility. On the other hand, you
don't make any use of updmap :-)

hm, so then the tds documentation should contain a table which specifies 
the differences between the three engines (i must admit that i never looked 
into what dvips really needs as a minimum)

ok, so this means that in principle the acronym "dvips" no longer stands 
for an application but for a minimal standard for map files; this is fine 
with me but then should be made official and described in a separate 
document, or an appendix to the tds document. (psmap would then be a better 
name)

indeed, so we now consider 'dvips' to be a syntax scheme (which then 
becomes frozen in order not to introduce conflicts in the future); so how 
about adding a first line to each map file as such

% generic map file, suitable for dvips and pdftex

(i'll do that anyway i think)

ok, so 'no font name' means pdftex; i can build that into texfont, sure

>Just forget about subpath. There is just texmf/fonts/map//.

so in a way we're lucky that 'dvips' precedes 'pdftex' in sorting but i'm 
not so sure about dvipdfmx, which, when map files with similar names are 
used, and we have no guarantee for that not being the case, we could be in 
trouble. So maybe a subpath {,dvips,pdftex,dvipdfmx} makes sense after all. 
I have to play with that

(sorry for bothering you, but for me clear pictures are needed in order to 
be able to sell the message)

The document does not define file formats in that detail.

It will be official as soon as the new tds document is released to
the public.

That's not a bad idea.

Right.

Forget about directory sorting. Files within texmf/fonts/map have to
have unique names. That's what tds requires.

> trouble. So maybe a subpath {,dvips,pdftex,dvipdfmx} makes sense after all. 

No, not in my opinion.

Sure, but aren't font resources shared anyway? when i run texexec 
--pdfrrange :

2,937,036 metafun-p.pdf
3,164,832 texexec.pdf

that one is run with fontnameless map files so the fonts are embedded only 
once it seems (or maybe this is the object inclusion optimizer preventing 
the duplicates)

(i wonder what happens with such names when including a file made on a mac 
in a tex job run on win/lin, esp since most fonts come in mac or win versions)

somehow i still feel a bit unsure in including the FontNames since they are 
not guaranteed unique (across font instances) and i really want to test 
that much more (the current pdftex is already pretty clever with fonts 
thanks to you)

Subject: [tex-live] TL2004: Technical problems and testing
Message-ID: <20040506222902.GA13364@lucien.kn-bremen.de>

Hi,
during BachoTeX 2004 several LUG representatives and some
developers discussed the current state of TeXLive and how to
deliver a stable product that is compatible with existing
installations.

Present were:
- Kaja Christiansen, president of DKTUG, vice-president of TUG
- Hans Hagen, president of NTG, maintainer of ConTeXt, member of
  the pdfTeX developement team
- Harald K?nig, founding member of DANTE, XFree86 core member,
  DANTE open source advisor
- Jerzy Ludwichowski, president of GUST
- Kim Roberts, committee member of UKTUG
- Volker Schaa, president of DANTE
- Martin Schr?der, maintainer of pdfTeX
- Ulrik Vieth, user with great interest in fonts
- Staszek Wawrykiewicz, TeXLive developer

The current situation was discussed and two problem groups where
raised: Technical problems which would severly loose backwards
compatibily or stability, and testing.  This was seen as a reason
for DANTE, NTG & GUST not producing this CD/DVD in the current
state because it certainly causes an enormous amount of user's
disappointment and support requirement.

For some time now the TeXLive distributions that go to the
membership of usergroups has been supported and sponsored by
Lehmans. This makes DANTE de facto responsible for providing
Lehmans with a stable TeXLive. This also means that there is a
whole group of users who are not members and will not be informed
about the changes at all. When we discussed this in the group,
DANTE, NTG & GUST suggested to let distribution depend on proper
beta testing. Only when the CD/DVD set works as expected on users
machines (pdf/dvi production as well as fonts installed by users,
i.e. the current tree in combination with other trees) we will go
forward. DANTE is willing to discuss a sligthly more liberal
schedule of publishing with Lehmans.

1. Technical changes which could cause problems
In the last months many changes have been committed to TL that
are either untested or would loose backwards compatibility.
- Search paths: The search paths for encoding files, map files
  and scripts have been changed so that existing texmf-trees must
  be reorganized. The change itself is a good thing, but giving
  up downward compatibility is too big a risk. This could ruin
  TeXLive's reputation.
  Proposed solution: Add the old locations of the files to
  texmf.cnf and if needed change kpathsea so that the old
  locations are also searched.
  We also discussed more robust ways of communicating (proposed)
  changes. No conclusions were drawn yet.
- Support for pdftex.cfg has been removed, causing compatibility
  problems with existing installations.
  Proposed solution: Keep support for pdftex.cfg, but declare it
  as deprecated and support only the mapfile entries. All other
  entries are ignore (with a warning).
- eTeX will be the only engine. This should cause no problems.
- pdfeTeX as the only engine. This could lead to several
  compatiblity problems, most with packages that are unable to
  handle pdfTeX in dvi mode.
  Proposed solution: Do not switch to pdfeTeX as the only engine
  now, but maybe in 2005.
- 8-bit-troubles (tcx): These have caused severe problems in the
  past, but are supposed to be solved.

2. Testing
TL2003 had several bugs which where caused by not testing the
product on systems of average (non TeX/os expert) users. The
proposed solution is to initiate a controlled beta-test program.
- Testers are to be searched in all LUG-mailing lists first, ctt
  later. Preference is given to people with a large number of
  files and who will actually test (power-users).
- Testers will be required to fill in an application form.
  Submissions are handled by Kim Roberts.
- A mailing list (texlive-beta) for the beta-testers will be
  created.
- Bug reports from the beta testers are to be posted to the
  mailing list. Kim Roberts screens the list and forward the bugs
  to the developers responsible.
- Iso-images and archives of binaries and pool files for the
  various plattforms are produced regularly and made available,
  via CTAN if possible, or other public ftp servers otherwise.
- If needed CDs can be burned and shipped by the DANTE office.

Time schedule:
1. 20040601: Feature freeze, beta releases ready. Beta testing
             starts.
2. 20040801: Beta testing ends, master is prepared for
             production.
3. 20040901: TL2004 ships, when all problems are resolved.

Distribution:
- live-DVD
- live-CD (runnable from CD), 700mb
- installable CD

Best regards
        Martin

    It will be official as soon as the new tds document is released to
    the public.

And the reason it isn't released yet is to give time to discuss
the implications, exactly like this :).


- Regarding the map files:
Hans, I agree with you that map/dvips is being used "generically".
The name map/generic might be better.  Thomas?

I also agree that it would be highly desirable for everything to use
*one* map file syntax.  But the reality is they don't, so we have to
conform to reality, not the other way around.


- Regarding the encoding files:
As Thomas said, we have a long history of inventing slightly new
syntaxes with each new program.  Therefore putting .enc files directly
into texmf/enc/*.enc does not seem desirable to me.

And as Hans said, the idea of (future) different enc syntaxes being in xml,
or based on the underlying format (ps, svg, ...), makes sense.  So maybe
we should have enc/ps instead of enc/dvips, since again, "dvips" is being
used generically there.


- Regarding searching:
My assumption is that if different programs require different syntaxes,
then there will be different paths.  For instance, pdftex might need
PDFTEXMAPPATH=texmf/map/pdftex:texmf/map//
(I don't know what it uses for searching now.)
Of course if the names are unique, it doesn't matter.


- In general:
The whole enc/map situation is poorly understood by users (including
me!) and poorly documented (that I've found).  Thomas/Hans, would it
possible to write something short stating exactly how to use updmap,
texfont, (other tools?), to install a new font, or list the fonts
available?  (Those are the two most common desires, in my experience.)


Thanks,
k

Hi Martin and all,

    for DANTE, NTG & GUST not producing this CD/DVD in the current state 

Obviously no one is contemplating shipping what is in perforce right now.

   Proposed solution: Add the old locations of the files to
   texmf.cnf and if needed change kpathsea so that the old
   locations are also searched.

 I don't disagree, but I guess it's Thomas who needs to be convinced.

       We also discussed more robust ways of communicating (proposed)
       changes. No conclusions were drawn yet.

What is wrong with email to tex-live@tug.org?  Everyone relevant is on
that list.  It is discussions/decisions *off* the list which cause
problems, in my experience.

Of course I know that many people on tex-live don't care about all the
ins and outs.  If you think a smaller list would serve us better, that's
fine.  Although much can be accomplished at physical meetings,
ultimately email is the only thing that can bring us together; physical
meetings, wherever in the world they are located, will necessarily
exclude many key people.  (And I do *not* mean me.)

      Proposed solution: Keep support for pdftex.cfg, but declare it
      as deprecated and support only the mapfile entries. All other
      entries are ignore (with a warning).

Sure.  But what do you (Martin) think, as you're the one who has to
implement it :)?  I assume you're ok with it or it wouldn't be getting
proposed :).

    - eTeX will be the only engine. This should cause no problems.

Well, I agree with this as stated, but I believe we currently use tex
for tex.  I personally don't feel strongly whether "tex" invokes the
original tex, or etex in compatibility mode.

    - pdfeTeX as the only engine. This could lead to several
      compatiblity problems, most with packages that are unable to
      handle pdfTeX in dvi mode.
      Proposed solution: Do not switch to pdfeTeX as the only engine
      now, but maybe in 2005.

There is another solution, as we've discussed here at length: use
pdfetex with a .ini file which undefines the pdftex extensions to
generate the non-pdf tex's.

    TL2003 had several bugs which where caused by not testing the
    product on systems of average (non TeX/os expert) users. The
    proposed solution is to initiate a controlled beta-test program.

The more testing the better, no doubt.  The problem is finding testers,
good or otherwise.

    - Testers will be required to fill in an application form.

Sorry to say so, but I think this is simply unrealistic.  Even with no
overhead of an application form, I have received only about five
responses to my repeated requests on ctt, texhax, and tug mailings for
testers.  (I had planned to email those people when there was something
to test.)  In other words, right now we are not in a position to pick
and choose.

If you can get 20 people to respond to your queries, then great, by all
means, choose the ones who will give the best reports.  It would be a
nice luxury to have.

I strongly advise we all send out queries on the membership lists to get
a sense of how many people are interested, before spending time devising
a form, which could be a huge time sink with no actual practical use.

    Time schedule:

Well, if we really cut the production cd's around 9/1, that would be ok
(not great), but I do not like the idea of *assuming* we won't ship
until 9/1.  

    1. 20040601: Feature freeze, beta releases ready. Beta testing

Ok by me, but it really depends on Olaf, Thomas, Fabrice, Gerben, and
the others who have to write the code (in the next 3 1/2 weeks,
according to this) so there is something stable to test, and Sebastian,
who puts it all together.  These "decisions" cannot be made in a vacuum.
We're all volunteers.

    2. 20040801: Beta testing ends, master is prepared for
                 production.
    3. 20040901: TL2004 ships, when all problems are resolved.

Sure, testing should take however long it takes to get a usable product.
Three months is not an unreasonable guess.  My concern is that we not
use the schedule as an excuse for doing nothing until the final
deadline.  Last year, Staszek was essentially the only tester until well
after the original agreed-on deadline was passed, causing the thing to
be 3 months late and still buggy, as we all know to our sorrow.

This year, we were doing reasonably well with the early schedule that I
circulated (and we all more or less agreed to, if you remember) earlier
until the last few weeks, when it seems little progress has been made.
I hope that will reverse.

    - Iso-images and archives of binaries and pool files for the
      various plattforms are produced regularly and made available,

By Sebastian, as has been done in the past?  Or are you proposing that
someone else is going to be responsible?  And if so, who?  

     via CTAN if possible, or other public ftp servers otherwise.

As is well known, uk-ctan does not currently have the disk space to
store any TL test images, and I doubt all the mirrors would want many
gigabytes of test images either.  So I don't think it can be distributed
via the regular CTAN mechanisms.

This is basically why the test image production happens on tug.org now.
If the test images can get distributed from another machine or two,
that's fine, whatever.  I don't think performance has been an issue.

   Distribution:
   - live-DVD
   - installable CD

Yes to those two.

   - live-CD (runnable from CD), 700mb

We have discussed this at length too, and I was under the impression
that we had all agreed to drop this in favor of a copy of the miktex cd,
basically to save the endless hassle of choosing packages.  If you are
dropping that idea, then ok, no big deal, but again, who is going to
produce it?  Are you assuming Sebastian will?


I look forward to a successful cooperative effort once again, and a
reliable TeX Live 2004 release :).

karl

Everybody is welcome to read the list archives to see the reasons why
I don't agree. I'll happily (well, not really) see a revival of this
discussion if *new* arguments come in...

One thing that I can add here is that updmap (which users are supposed to
use to "register" their map files) will get lots of new checks regarding
map file locations (making separate searches in old place and new place).
The program will also output clear warnings. Very very few people have
their own enc files in local texmf trees, so a changed location for enc
files should not be a problem hitting many people.

teTeX-3.0 (to be release *this* year) will not search the old locations,
so one argument to add is compatibility between teTeX and TeX Live.

That will give an annoying message to thousands of users. Next point:
how to handle the situation that map files can be set up in two places
(pdftexconfig.tex and pdftex.cfg)? Which overwrites what? Which has
precedence? How will users be suprised if they just know one of the two?

I really *hate* adding complexity by mixing "good old" and "new"
approaches. Fearing incompatible changes, we should not change anything
or accept the consequences. Adding complexity is the wrong way.

> - eTeX will be the only engine. This should cause no problems.

"the only engine" are the wrong words, I think. "The default engine"
is better. Else, I don't agree. Sure, it will be a problem if we remove
pdf*tex. :-)

>   Proposed solution: Do not switch to pdfeTeX as the only engine
>   now, but maybe in 2005.

teTeX-3.0 will just go that way: pdfetex will be the default engine (with
all primitives enabled). TeX Live may well follow now, later or never...
It would be easier for me if the setups could be the same.

We should help Olaf to find the right solution. The last statement from
him to me was that the automatic loading of cp8bit.tcx does not work
any more (due to encTeX) and that he rather desperately need feedback
on what to do instead.

I don't care to much about this. Both have their pro and cons. Against
"generic" is that there is nothing like a generic map file. Other
applications have their own completely different font map files (X
windows, dvipdfm). So, map/generic might ba as misleading as map/dvips.

I am no font wizard, so I'll just follow that if it makes sense. What's
"underlying format" precisely? I guess that "ps" means that these enc
files can be send to a ps interpreter.

If we can't assume unique names, we'll run into trouble. Search paths
like this look simple, but how to deal with more than one texmf tree?
People having
  map/dvips/fancy.map
in their local tree will get very suprised if pdftex reads
  map/pdftex/fancy.map
from the system's tree (with lower priority in the TEXMF list).

All I want to say is: we have to be more careful about some "hidden"
complexity.

The idea of updmap is simple. The tool comes with a configuration that
manages all map files that come with the system. The applications (pdftex,
xdvi, dvips, ...) are set up to read the map files that updmap generates;
not the small "map file modules". Users can set a few preferences, e.g.
if they want to embed the base14 fonts (for generating pdf) or if they
prefer bitmap fonts (for those cases that both formats are available).

One can list the configuration of updmap by
  updmap --listmaps | grep '^Map'
and look at the map files to find out more.

To add a map file, one just edits the config file (updmap --edit).
As an alternative, one can use a cli for updmap, e.g.
  updmap --nohash --nomkmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true
  updmap --nohash --nomkmap --enable Map fancy.map
  updmap # regenerate the map files

Well, in principle I agree with Thomas, however after many discussions
with users I'd like to find any solution which can satisfy most of them.
The main arguments are:  
1. even installing teTeX-3.0 or TL2004 the users
   can have/use some other texmf tree searched (e.g. teTeX3 with TL2003 
   from CD, etc., etc.)
2. the users (or existing installation script) still could install map/enc
   files into an old location (texmf/dvips/).

So the proposed solution for this year TL's texmf.cnf is:

< TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map//
> TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/{fonts/map,dvips}//

% this is OK:
TEXPSHEADERS =	.;$TEXMF/{fonts/{enc,type1},dvips}//

< ENCFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/enc//
> ENCFONTS = .;$TEXMF/{fonts/enc,dvips}//

Anyway, the _working/global_ map files for dvips/pdftex/dvipdfm are
maintaned by updmap and stored in $TEXMF/fonts/map/updmap/ . As I know (or
can be wrong) only dvips can load the specific .map file from the command
line (via -P config.XXX), so the above changes will work well for a font
map/enc files installed in the old (dvips/) location and even they are not
included to the global map file(s). I've just checked that.

Martin, I think that we've missanderstood that point in Bachotek.
If we upgrade to the new pdf(e)tex, we don't need pdftex.cfg anymore.

Any loading by default any cp8bit.tcx (or more transparent 8bit.tcx)
was no good idea. Hopefully tex at all doesn't load it now. The same
in regard of any experiments with locales...

I agree with Thomas that I do not like this. And let me add:
- not doing a real change remove all pressure on people to change.
- most users use a standard tree, the ones who have extra stuff are 
generally somewhat knowledgeable. This is certainly true on Mac OS X 
where I have users who start out with TeX because it produces beautiful 
output but who have trouble understanding what a program is, an editor, 
a file format, etc. This is becoming a serious problem. I have noticed 
that more complete newbies contact me these days.

Shouldn't it be possible to write a script that translates an old-style 
tree to a new-style tree?

hm, can't we then just initialize tex's internal array to being 8 bit? if 
loading a tcx file breaks we're in deep trouble; i was under the impression 
that enctex was invisible unless features were invoked; if not, it should 
(as with etex extensions)

i have been thinking about this last night; the boundary condition that 
files are unique is a dangerous one (where did it come from?); if users 
rely only on map files, and they want for instance to control font 
embedding, they need to tweak map files. Apart from the fact that they need 
to find their way to the right font name (normal, virtual, etc), they then 
have to decide what to do: make a new file, replace the old one; also, they 
have to decide where to put it, main tree, local tree, ...; in this 
process, there can be no guarantees that a file does not get the same name 
(i was bitten by this in the past when i copied psfonts.map, removed all 
the FontNames, because i ran into conflicts with inclusion; then removes 
lots of entries because they slowed down pdftex; finaly got it working when 
i renamed the file to psclean.map, which is probably not a uniaue name 
forever ...)

of course the problem is simular to 'tex files with the same name' but 
there at least we have some extra criterium built in: latex and context and 
... first search on their own paths; also, in context, there are some rules 
with regards to filenames so that context itself can apply some logic; we 
should start treating tex engines in theh same way; this could mean an 
additonal, say:

PDFTEX.MAPPATH

btw, this was one of the reasons for adding more extensive \pdfmapfile and 
\pdfmapline to pdftex; (with the options to add/remove/overload map 
entries); at least this gives us some control.

texfont:

- buy a nice font
- create a temp path (say ghz/optima-nova)
- copy the font files (floppy, cdrom) to that path
- run tex font like:

   texfont --afm2pl --encoding=texnansi --vendor=linotype 
--collection=optima-nova --remove
   texfont --afm2pl --encoding=texnansi --vendor=linotype 
--collection=optima-nova --source=ghz/optima-nova --make --install

this will install the files in the tree: pfb files, tfm files (generated 
first), if needed vf files, and of course a map file for this set; also, a 
test file will be generated that when processed will show the installed 
fonts (matrix, composed glyph support, etc).

Installing fontfont meta involves a bit more:

   texfont --afm2pl --en=texnansi --ve=fontfont --co=meta --re
   texfont --afm2pl --en=texnansi --ve=fontfont --co=meta 
--so=fontfont/meta-1 --ma --in --expert
   texfont --afm2pl --en=texnansi --ve=fontfont --co=meta

Texfont can also handle open type fonts (extension provided by apple users,

Also, texfont uses a name scheme that prevents conflicts with different 
slant versions and alike (--sl=.167, --sl=.2 are really different);

The whole idea is that one can just buy a font, run a script, and after 
telling tex how to use them (typescripts in context), can start using them.

an example: it was only after tex live was produced that i find out that 
generating a czech format fails because the hyhenation file was changes as 
well as moved; a few years before that, the dutch hyphenation file has been 
renamed which made dutch context users end up without hyphenation; 
actually, the changes in tds is another one; it was there for a year and 
only found out recently. Yet another example is the move from 8 to 7 bit 
last year (volker and i were present at the gutenberg meeting and it was 
because daniel asked us why his things failed to work that we realized the 
problem; just good luck). So, what we need is some kind of mechanism where 
'important changes that can break your system' are announced, in such a way 
that they are not burried in discussions.

i think that what we had in mind is more active than just asking; it's like 
with meetings and conferences and magazines: asking people that you know 
can do a talk or article often works better nowadays than posting a mail 
asking for that; the form then mainly serves the purpose of getting the 
info needed, esp because cd's need to be sent out

the machinery is probably already in place then; part of the discussion 
concerned a proper location since there were bandwith problems seen on the 
horizon (harrald would look into that)

i myself would like to have the option to download binaries only (linux,

pdftex can load the map file by means of the config file (old method, will 
become obsolete some day) as well as by means of \pdfmapfile (which has 
been around for a while, and which i use); dvipdfmx will support runtime 
mapfile loading as well (specials)

i think that the point was in the users who have their own map file entries 
in there; all other directives would be ignored, pdftex would still load 
the cfg file if present (which is only true if users have them in their 
local tree) and a warning would be issues; also, the option was discussed 
to collect some warning and flush them at the end of the run so that users 
will not miss seeing them.

Isn't the main problem here the forced one year cycle of new versions? I 
agree that we should be able to rigourously clean up and update (say tetex 
3) but at the same time we need to get a robust distribution in a period 
that is too short for testing all the implications of such changes. 
Unfortunately the current changes do not permit us to use updated tex/font 
files with old binaries. Fortunately we have the temf.cnf file to privide 
us backward compatibility. I can imagine that tex live ships with an 
extended texmf.cnf file (with your proposed additoons)

eh ... this depends, if tex has 8-bit-in - 8-bit-out built in by default, 
ok, else we definitely need to load the cp8bit as default. Otherwise users 
who don't load it will find themselves loosing functionality they have no 
clue of how to solve. (this was last years show stopper!).

Hi!

It seems that all are back to work now.

Here is a problem I found:
running `omega -ini   -jobname=lambda -progname=lambda lambda.ini' ...
This is Omegak, Version 3.141592--1.23.2.2 (Web2C 7.5.2) (INIOMEGA)

l.3 \input lambda.tex

Ok, it is there:
/usr/TeX/texlive-src/Master/texmf-dist/omega/lambda/base/lambda.tex

but the search path is at:
TEXINPUTS.lambda = 		.;$TEXMF/tex/{lambda,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.omega =               .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//


Are we supposed to move all the stuff out of TEXMF/omega/* into
TEXMF/tex/* ?

No, no all the stuff. ocp and otp have to stay there. lambda should go

This is a nice idea. For example to add this functionality to texhash
script. If texhash (or mktexlsr or...) is invoked and if the map etc.
files are in the old places then warning will be printed and files
will moved to new places automatically.

For example, user follows the old documentation or use old install-script.
He/she installs files to old places. Then he/she runs texhash and
corrections are made automatically, moreover, the warning is printed.

The argument that you give applies to any search path, so it can be
repeated for texmf/fonts/map/pdftex and you are nowhere else.

If we can set up TeX Live to deliver non-overlapping names for the
whole fonts/map// tree, then I see no reason to use a more complicated
search path.

I think that you have even given a good argument for this: sometimes users
want to change a global file by putting a new one into the local tree. Assume
that the file to change is
  TEXMFDIST: texmf/map/pdftex/foopkg/foo.map
and the user puts up
  TEXMFLOCAL: texmf/map/local/foo.map
and the search path is set up as
  TEXMF={$TEXMFLOCAL,$TEXMFDIST,...}
  TEXFONTMAPS=$TEXMF/fonts/map/{pdftex,}/

Guess what he'll get? ...
...
...
Answer: the file from the dist tree.

Really, if we can provide a clean tree, we should also provide simple
search paths. Users really get confused by complicated search paths.

I am surprised too. I mean that it is possible to implement things by
folowing way:

* When format is generated:
  if -enc is used then 7bit default for xprn vector is used
  (this is documented in encTex documentation)
  if no -enc is used then you can implement arbitrary behavior:
  for example: implicit tcx tale is read or 8bit default is used.

* When format is used:
  if encTeXed-formad is used then nothing special is done
  (only if explicit -translate-file is used then TCX table is read)
  if no encTeXed-format is used then you can implement the 8bit
  initilaization of xprn vector or reading an implicit tcx table.

This is up to the distribution to decide, but then you loose

Why must they change? It ain't broken, so there's no need to fix
it.

So for most users it doesn't matter what we do, and if we keep
the old stuff in we can satisfy all users.

I fully agree.  What about starting a ChangeLog file?  All
participants who can contribute to the TeXLive tree have to document
the changes *as detailed as possible*, without exception (well,
trivial changes like adding trailing whitespace or fixing some typos
are usually not worth to be mentioned).  This means discipine -- in
many cases preparing a ChangeLog entry is more work than the change
itself, but it is really worth the time.

The output which I can see using `p4 changes -l' is far too sloppy.
Have a look at, say, the ChangeLog file(s) of Emacs to see what I
mean.

Until now I haven't seen a better alternative.

    Unfortunately the current changes do not permit us to use updated
    tex/font files with old binaries. Fortunately we have the temf.cnf
    file to privide us backward compatibility.

I agree.

The main argument against it is complicated search paths.  I think that
users would be far more confused by a new release which doesn't find
their files at all.

It's true that users will have little incentive to change, but this is
the same issue as for the pdftex->dvi problem.  I think we should act
responsibly, and give responsible users (however few there are), a
chance to switch their trees.  Ie, this year we put in compatibility
kludges, and we warn about these things wherever we can.  Next year, we
take out the kludges.

That way, when people complain, we can say "hey, we told you, you had a
chance".  If we just break them without warning, then all we can say is,
"yes, we broke compatibility, and we knew it, sorry, you lose".  Not good.

Users who just use what we give them and don't have anything local (the
majority) won't care either way.


Regarding the possibility of making a tool to automatically convert
trees: by all means, let's detect the old files, let's report the old
files, let's give users an easy way to change to the new setup -- but I
don't think we should change the files out from under them.  That could
break their *old* installation and leave them with nothing working.  It
doesn't seem safe.


Thomas, I know you hate the added complexity in the paths, but the fact
is, we have 8 years of baggage to carry around.  Having a year of grace
period does not seem so horrible to me that it's worth just breaking
things without warning.

I think it is actually good that teTeX use the clean paths, while TL
uses the compatible paths.  It makes the future clear.

    We should help Olaf to find the right solution. The last statement from
    him to me was that the automatic loading of cp8bit.tcx does not work
    any more (due to encTeX) and that he rather desperately need feedback
    on what to do instead.

Olaf, where does the code stand at this point?

    This is up to the distribution to decide, but then you loose
    character protuding in dvi mode.

1) Not if those primitives aren't disabled.  The only ones known to
Staszek and myself that need to be disabled are:
\let\pdfoutput\undefined
\let\pdfpagewidth\undefined
\let\pdfpageheight\undefined
\let\pdfhorigin\undefined
\let\pdfvorigin\undefined

2) If the dvi formats are generated using etex, character protruding is
   *definitely* not available :).

The problem is that usergroups want a cd each year, else we could indeed 
skip a year and come up with the robust 2005 accompanied with reorganize 
the trees tools.

indeed; btw, the next MAPS will have an article on the coming changes, so 
we expect NTG uses to know beforehand what will happen; also that year will 
give the NTG users some time to adapt

makes me think: could kpse be extended with something:

OBSOLETEPATHS=......

which would trigger a message if one of those paths is accessed?

Time of developers and maintainers is a limiting resource, so it should be
spent carefully.  Users of free software must expect to put in some
extra effort to conform with choices made by developers and maintainers --
if they don't like those choices they can think about joining in the
development effort where they can influence decisions.

I worry that an extended texmf.cnf file will lead to a mass of problems
with trees that mix old and new directories and files.  It is better to
spend time making a robust distro that showcases the new tree.  I see
nothing wrong with a new distro that requires users to do things
differently as long as the documentation is there.

Maybe the people who oppose using the new TDS for TL2004 could produce
"TeX Dead 2004" consisting of a debugged "TeX Live 2003" (does this need
to work on Win9x?).  Then others can get on with producing "TeX Live 2005"
which would not be released until it is finished, hopefully in late 2004.

Basically, the automatic loading of cp8bit.tcx (a horrible kludge at
best) interferes with loading the xord/xchr/xprn arrays for encTeX.
The way it works, when loading a tcx you always lose whatever
xord/xchr/xprn is in the format file.  So if cp8bit.tcx is loaded by
default, then encTeX breaks.



Given the amount of feedback I've had, I've mainly gone on my sense of
what would be useful, usable, and (I think) comprehensible.

- Currently, the code distinguishes between writing to the terminal
  and log on the one hand, and other writes (\write) on the other.

- For writes to the terminal and log, isprint(3) function is used, and
  this is locale-dependent.

- For \write, the setup is as follows:

  - By default, printable means printable ASCII, codes [32..127].
    This is Knuth's original definition.  

  - Giving the -8bit option changes the default to make all characters
    printable.

  - In a TCX file you can specify a third value, to explicitly set
    a character as printable or non-printable.  This is the way to
    make characters non-printable if -8bit is used as well.

  - The xord/xchr/xprn arrays are always saved in the format, for all
    engines except those in the Omega family.  Thus, a TCX or -8bit
    given in INI mode sets the defaults for that format.

  - If a TCX is specified, it overrules whatever is in the format.

  - If -8bit is specified, it overrules whatever is in the format.

  - The \xchr, \xord, \xprn primitives are only available in encTeX.




Another issue that has come up is the extension of format files.  At
present a dump begins with a magic number ("W2TX", "W2MF", or "W2MP")
followed by the name of the engine as a <size, name> pair, with the
name terminated by one or more NUL chars to get a size rounded to a
multiple of four (as we turn out to write dumps in multiples of four
bytes).

With this, I can produce a comprehensible error message if the wrong
engine tries to load a dump, e.g:

	infovore:/home/olaf/web2c/src/texk/texk/web2c$ ./pdfetex \&latex
	This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.20a-rc1-2.1 (Web2C 7.5.3)
	 %&-line parsing enabled.
	---! latex.efmt was written by etex
	(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

What I would like to do, is to use only three extensions: .fmt for
formats, .base for bases, and .mem for mems.  If we expect that
multiple engines will want to use the same format name, we can use a
construct like this
	WEB2CDIR = .;{$TEXMF}/{$engine,}//
to get things sorted.  I've come to the conclusion that this kind of
occurrence ought to be rare, especially on systems using fmtutil, so
even that may be overkill.

Having a single extension for formats would clean up some things, but
I do not feel strongly about it.  What I do feel strongly about is
that we should either using a single extension, or have each engine
use its own extension; at present we're doing neither as pdftex uses
.fmt and pdfetex uses .efmt.

Thanks for the explanation. I conclude that texfont and updmap don't
compete. They are just doing different things. texfont helps users to
get all files in place (metrics, map files etc.). Updmap just "registers"
a map file for the system, so all application can make use of the fonts
contained there without tweeking of configurations of individual programs.

just curious: is \write16 the same as \message, or will \write16 act as any

nice and extensible; it would -for context- mean:

../texmf/aleph/cont-en.fmt (cont-nl.fmt, cont-de.fmt etc)
../texmf/pdfetex/cont-en.fmt (cont-nl.fmt, cont-de.fmt etc)
../texmf/metapost/metafun.mem (mptopdf.mem)

which is fine to me. I need to be able to distinguis between engines since 
the format name is kind of fixed for me.

(i need to patch texexec but that's no big deal; i guess that also the 
-efmt switch will become -fmt then)

maybe use 'format' instead of 'fmt' so that the new method is stressed

esp with combined engines in the end we will end up in problems; (there are 
also tex variants like xetex on the mac, which use xfmt)

\write18 should be like other writes, not like \message.  Othewise it
becomes needlessly hard to use.

good, because then users have two methods to get things to the terminal: 
locale'd and direct;

do you really mean

or
WEB2CDIR = .;{$TEXMF}/web2c/{$engine,}//

i.e. tex.fmt will be moved from $TEXMF/web2c/tex.fmt (or

Actually, it isn't like other writes, and it isn't like \message
either.  TeX doesn't ever do ^^-processing for \write18, just like it
doesn't do it for \special.

Note that we don't even do xord/xchr processing for \write18 or
\special, _and never have._

in teTeX, so maybe there is nothing more to be done at this point?

The latter of course -- good catch.  The actual definitions would be
like this:

	TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//
	MFBASES = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//
	MPMEMS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//

The formats have to go under $TEXMF/web2c as they are web2c-specific.

IIRC this separation was indeed implemented last year.  The reason for
following the locale's defn of printability being (among others) that
it should keep "raw" output from screwing up the terminal you're
working in.

I'm not sure Thomas has this working, as this version of the code is
_very_ new.

I'm not sure this is adequately documented at the moment.  I suppose
it should go into web2c.texi, at least.

That's fine with me. So, we'll have a teTeX-3.0 which forces users to
switch (and hopefully helps them with tools and documenattion).

And we might have a TeX Live sometime with something else and sometime
later with something different from then. Well, given that Sebastian has
announced to drop the leadership of this project, this has to be that
vague... Argh... TeX Live without Sebastian... I can't imagine that...

Message-ID: <200405080036.i480a1R02535@f7.net>

Martin asked on ctan-dists, I will reply on tex-live also:
    ms> Karl, where are we in the original schedule?

My original schedule is here:
http://developer.berlios.de/pm/task.php?group_project_id=416&group_id=1268&func=browse
which boils down to:

completion  task
----------  ----
2004-03-15  dev releases
2004-04-15  doc - english
2004-06-30  cd images
2004-06-30  cover art
2004-06-30  qa
2004-06-30  doc - translations

So it would seem we are about 2 months behind right now, since clearly
we are not yet at feature freeze or have a stable source.  We're still
in "dev releases" = primary development.

So, the revised schedule in your message of cutting discs in early
September, instead of early July (two months difference), is basically
in sync with that plan, adjusted for current reality.

If we have a stable platform in June to start serious testing with, I'll
be ecstatic.  And I don't mean tweaking the paths in texmf.cnf :).  I
mean the actual core source releases that we will distribute.

I do not know if that is realistic, i.e., how much more work Olaf,
Fabrice, Thomas, you (Martin), Hans, and everyone else is planning on.
Any estimates, dear developers :)?

Best,
karl

As it happens I'm in a brief window where I can do some work on this.
You'll get something that ought to be very close to webc 7.5.3 this
saturday (later today for me).  After that I'll probably be unable to
work on web2c for two weeks, but should be able to wrap things up
after that.

At present I've done:

- changes in the xord/xchr/xprn handling (decribed in greater detail
  on tex-live)
- -8bit option
- pushing $engine in the environment
- using .fmt for all TeX-family engines
- -halt-on-error option
- spaces in filenames, along the pattern provided by MikTeX,
  that is you use quotes like this:
      \input "filename with spaces"
- like MikTeX (again) if a filename with spaces is printed, quotes are
  added
- installation (by my Makefile :) of the dumps in subdirectories of
  web2c

This should take care of most of the differences with the windows code
base.  The changes touch omega and aleph as well.

To do

- some of the stuff above is not yet documented.
- Makefile glitches.

The documentation may end up being postponed a bit.

ok, so no problems there; btw, are these details documented somewhere? if 
not, maybe they should go into the web2c doc o rmaybe in a separate doc?

since pdftex is the main engine now, we can add a section to the upcoming 
updated manual (just send me a paragraph summarizing it some day)

same for me, we need him as a leader; i can't imagine that one mails makes

looking at the dates, i wonder if in the future we should not aim for a new 
version in march or november; it looks like the holidays are now in the 
middle of the important testing and production period. (Over here, 
may-august is becoming a period in which work is hard to plan)

concerning the amount of work, since it's an interplay of binaries changing 
as well as paths and so, i'm dependent of binaries; (i'd love to be able to 
download only binaries for that purpose); currently i'm working in the new 
tree with a mix of old/new binaries (unix/windows/djgpp), but i still need 
to patch texfont to the latest changes (enc/dvips|ps|generic, can you make 
a decision there? or maybe i should just decide for enc/pdftex to make 
things easier); then i can reorganize the zip; also, context is not 
sensitive for the changes in config/engine); so i think i can manage

(actually, i want the example framework to end up on tex live as well, but 
that's another story; has to do with user interfacing, using tex over the 
web, and such; in due time i'll discuss that with Thomas/Fabrice)

web2c 7.5.3 code base.  The change entry:

        A huge change, to bring the TeX-live source in sync with my
        working sources for web2c.  These changes implement:
        - ini* and vir* links are no longer created
        - xord/xchr/xprn are always dumped
        - 8bits option
        - pool_name and engine_name parametrization of mf and mp
        - halt-on-error option
        - setting $engine in the environment
        - all formats have .fmt extension
        - quoted filenames so filenames with spaces can work
        Some of these changes touch a lot of files at the same time.
        They also spilled over into omega and aleph.
        eomega builds are probably broken at this point

Please note that last point: changes I made required changes to aleph,
omega, and pdf*tex, or their builds would fail.

Except for the manual pages and some stuff in mpware my sources and

It seems to me that the current spat has in part been triggered by the
lack of progress on TeX-live during the past weeks/months.  I am
painfully aware that I am one of the sources of this lack of progress,
and that I could have done more.

For this, I apologise.

I would like to comment Martin's letter which I haven't had a chance
to read until now.

The initiative for the TeXLive meeting in Bachotek came from Staszek and 
I liked it: talking face to face is good. However, the direction taken by the
following discussion was not what I'd ever expected, as the major developers
were prevented from taking part and comment. 

Although the letter may appear as a joint recommendation, whatever,
that was not, as far as I am concerned, the case.

Finally, I asked Martin that the draft of the letter is sent to those who
were present at the meeting for a round of comments and he assured me
on a couple of occasions that this will be done. It wasn't.

So, I am dissociating myself from this letter and its message.

My apologies to everyone for not really commenting on all this
business yet, or coming to a final conclusion about my own involvement.
I am touched and humbled by Joachim's vehemence on the subject,
although it must be tempered by an understanding that if I withdraw from
TeX Live then it will be largely because of my own personal circumstances,
not because of a BachoTeX coup! As you'll have noticed, I have barely spent
an hour on the project for some months.

I'm now trying to work out in my own head what I really think about the 
direction
of TeX Live.

I didn't know that. But hdd space is cheap nowadays; surely adding
another disc is possible? We were more concerned with transfer
volume.

Are many people actually using this feature? To me it doesn't
sound terribly useful and rather difficult to implement (using
a library like libcurl or libwww?)

I'm saying this mainly because we used to have similar
functionality in xdvik (using libwww), but we finally removed it
again since it was so bloated, buggy and also generally useless
since most people are more comfortable using a real web browser
to browse the web.

I would imagine that it would be even more difficult to use in a
non-GUI program. E.g. do users get a progress indicator of the
download? What if the server doesn't respond or hangs during the
download? Can you customize the timeouts?  What if you need to
enter a password for a password-protected site?

I am sorry to say that I am unlikely to want to be involved in TeX Live

Wasn't harrald going to look into this? He saw some options to use

Staszek has some good-old system to build xdvi on. That system does
not have Motif and it has a static version of libXaw. On that system,
he manually runs

  cd TeX/texk/xdvik
  rm xdvi-xaw.bin
  make xdvi-xaw.bin kpathsea_link='$(link_command)' \
    kpathsea=../kpathsea/.libs/libkpathsea.a \
    x_tool_libs="-Wl,Bstatic -Xaw -Wl,Bdynamic -lXpm -lXmu -lXt"
  strip xdvi-xaw.bin

to produce a "compatible" version of xdvi which should run on today's
systems.

It depends on the machine where you've compiled. I've observed the 
same here on some installations: if motif libs were found than we 
have xdvi-motif.bin. As Thomas suggested, I make the compilations
on Linux using 
./configure --with-x-toolkit=xaw ...
than recompile xdvi using static xaw
Such binaries work well on many Linux flavours.

Ah, I thought that this system did not have Motif at all... Anyway,
since most systems don't have a static libXaw, we can't make improve
the situation in such a way that a good xdvi binary can be produced
everywhere. In other words, I doubt that we can do anything about it now.

OK, I'll leave it to you to build a canonical set of 
binaries when you have a moment free

which is something one does often on web pages. since I

All format files have the same extension by now. This change has
implications on fmtutil. Previously, you could generate tex.fmt and tex.efmt
in the same temp directory, then move them to their final destination. Now,
using the same extension, it is not possible anymore.

I'm wondering what's the best way to handle the --all option of fmtutil now?

That's fine, but I'm not aware of any problems with the setup that we
have now: downloading from tug.org.  At least, no one has ever
complained to me.  If we can have the test ISO's also distributed from
various other CTAN locations, so much the better.

fmtutil has not supported more than one format for a given name in the
past, too. You could only have tex or etex as engine for the "tex" format,
not two. And, even without fmtutil, one could not have an etex based latex
in addition to a pdfetex based one, too (was the same name: latex.efmt).

Yesterday, I have thought about it and I have decided to make a simple
change now (just always use .fmt instead of .afmt, .efmt etc.).  Can we
live with that for now?

it also makes it possible to fetch data from content management systems and 
databases; some control over local caching is needed then (multiple tex 
runs) but fabrice's fetcher already supports that; it opens a new world of 
apps

I think that this does not work reliably (e.g. installation issues,
incompatible versions, Motif needs more than just the libraray etc.),
so we have to provide a working binary by some other means.

Unfortunately, I don't think it is so easy.  The chances of any given
.so working on any given user system seem remote to me, even if users
knew what to do with .so's, which they don't.  (Heck, most *admins* find
them painful -- I know I do.)

We should just compile xdvi with static Xaw, or static (free) Motif.
Wasn't that the conclusion?

With respect to uploading to (or downloading from) tug.org: it was once
said that the first one is free, the other costs money (which I mentioned
in Bachotek, that why it's coming up). I checked this here today and found
it's the other way round; that is, downloading from tug.org is not a problem.
Sorry guys for a temporary confusion.

I'm interesting where should go lambda and omega stuff. We have now:
texmf-dist/omega/lambda/base/lambda.ini (and other "input" files)
texmf-dist/omega/lambda/omegabook/
texmf-dist/tex/aleph/lambda/config/lambda.ini

but texmf.cnf says:
TEXINPUTS.lambda = .;$TEXMF/tex/{lambda,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.omega  = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic}//

I think that texmf(-dist)/omega/ should contain only otp/ and ocp/
Can we move omega/lambda/ to tex/ together with lambda.ini?
In such a way aleph could be still used for making format following
the convention: tex/<format>/{base,config}/ (not tex/<egine>/config/

As for texmf-dist/tex/latex/config/latex.ini, can I change it on p4 depot
following Thomas' suggestion:
 \input pdftexconfig\pdfoutput=0
 \scrollmode
 \input latex.ini

or should we leave it at it was? Just to avoid any hot discussion...

Avoid?  Surely you jest :).

As we've discussed at length, I don't think either of the above (leave
it alone or just use pdftex "bare") is right.  I think we should play
the preserve-and-undefine-primitives trick.  I don't see any serious
downside, it's just ugly -- but compatible.  Next year we can be
incompatible.  teTeX can be incompatible this year.

Specifically, I think latex.ini (and others) should say \input
pdftex-dvi.tex, where pdftex-dvi.tex is the following.

Have we reached consensus on this?

Sounds right to me.

If you find a place for the Omega hyphen files, that would be great too ;-)

Whatever will be decided now or later about hiding pdftex related
primitives, I suggest to use the following skeleton for the formats that
default to dvi mode:

    \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
    \else
      \ifx\pdfoutput\relax
      \else
         % here goes the pdftex related code, e.g.
         % disable primitives, load defaults...
         ...
      \fi
    \fi

    % here goes the usual format initialization, e.g.
    \scrollmode
    \input latex.ltx

    \endinput

That way, people can switch to a different engine if they want.

> Have we reached consensus on this?

Speaking for myself (and only for myself) I would do it differently,
but I can live with the suggestion (plus my improvements).

tex/generic/omegahyph/   ?? We already have here some patterns.
I'm completelly messed with all that stuff related to omega and lambda.
Some of patterns are also in texmf/omega/lambda/base/ :
grmhyph.tex, inuit.hpn (?!!). Moreover bad ltpatch.tex is read when
making lambda format and this breaks compilation of binaries...

Can someone have a look at this lambda, antomega, omegabook etc. Please! 
I've never used omega ;-)

Thanks,

the problem with hyphenation patterns (currently) is that the files are tex 
files and hardly deserve the name generic

maybe -as a precursor to a better way of dealing with this- we need to consider

/texroot/texmf/hyphen/tex
/texroot/texmf/hyphen/omega

anyway, even today i think that

/texroot/tex/omega/

would be an option. omegahyph is a bad name unless we have texhyph as well

since there is a relation between font encodings and hyphenation patterns, 
it would even make sense to organize things under fonts but maybe the omega 
patterns don't have that dependency.

(i suggest that we leave cleaning up / reorganizing hyphenation stuff till 
next year, and just put the omega specific files under the main omega path)

So they should go to texmf/tex/ anyway, as other files to be input 
(see TDS). tex/generic/..../ is Ok with respect that every format
(omega, lambda) can find needed files here. See the above TEXINPUTS....
As I see, specific omega (16bit) patterns use different names.

There are quite the same exceptions like tex/generic/ruhyphen, 
tex/generic/ukrhyph

But we need working stuff, properly placed in texmf tree...

And as tex files, they need to be put somewhere into texmf/tex. If the
hyphenation files work more or less independed of the format, these files
deserve a place in texmf/tex/generic.

I don't think that texmf/tex/generic/omegahyphen (or omhyphen) is such
a bad place...

> > till next year, and just put the omega specific files under the main

There is nothing like a main omega path. Hyphenation pattern files
are read along the TEXINPUTS path by omega and we want to texmf/tex//
as the only place for those files.

FWIW, I	would prefer the Motif solution since it's more
user friendly and has a nicer GUI. But it only works correctly with
OpenMotif, not with LessTif. I guess it depends on how much space
you have to waste ...

Yes, but it is valid only when you compile for yourself. TL should
provide ready-made binary which can work on many different versions
of Linux, even somehow older.

Ummh, what I had in mind was statically linking with Motif and
the rest (like they used to do with Netscape ...)

on the other hand, we should be prepare for new incompatible tex's showing 
up (omega 2 and so); with respect to patterns, tex, etex, pdftex, *tex are 
compatible, but i i'm not that sure about omega; i suppose that in the case 
of a new omega we get OMEGAINPUTS and texmf/omega (eh ... omegamf -); 
anyhow, it's no big deal now

It is, because we just recently have moved tex input files from
texmf/{etex,pdftex,pdfetex,omega} to texmf/tex.

Again, it is a matter of search paths which should become simpler.

    OpenMotif, not with LessTif. I guess it depends on how much space

Sadly, OpenMotif is not free software, so we can't use it for TeX Live.
Its license does not allow usage on non-free operating systems, such as
Solaris, and has other restrictions.

LessTif is free, but you say that doesn't work with current xdvi.

So, are we left with Xaw, or are there other choices?

Ehmm... I hate changing someone's stuff, and... I'd prefer acting more 
carefully, so again ask people with more knowledge in Omega stuff.
I can only suggest:
1. moving texmf/omega to texmf-dist/omega (don't know why we have here 
only few otp and ocp files; the main stuff is in texmf-dist)
2. moving texmf-dist/omega/lambda to texmf-dist/tex/lambda
3. removing texmf-dist/tex/aleph/lambda
4. moving   texmf-dist/tex/aleph/plain/config/aleph.ini to
            texmf-dist/tex/plain/config/  
  (like omega.ini, etex.ini, pdftex.ini already here)
5. correcting tex/lambda/omegabook/ltpatch.ltx !
6. more cleaning needed: 
   -- moving hyphenation stuff from tex/lambda/base
      to tex/generic/omegahyph/ (not sure about that)
   -- clearly separate antomega things from lambda/omega basic packages
      (completelly don't undarstand that).

OK, I wasn't aware of that.

It has quite a few bugs that make it functionally inferior
to the Xaw variant; see
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/xdvi/xdvik/texk/xdvik/LESSTIF-BUGS?rev=1.2.2.1
for details.

> So, are we left with Xaw, or are there other choices?

No, Xaw is the only left.

What do you mean ? If there is no simple logic behind files location, I

    Ehmm... I hate changing someone's stuff, and... I'd prefer acting more 

Someone's, but whose?  Who imported Omega into TL originally?

    carefully, so again ask people with more knowledge in Omega stuff.

I know that Yannis and John are not on tex-live, and have no time for
the details like this anyway.

The only other Omega developer I know who might be able to help is
Roozbeh Pournader.  Not sure if he's still working on it, but we could
try asking him specific questions.  He's not going to be familiar
with the ins and outs of TeX Live (like texmf vs. texmf-dist), though.

Is anyone else on this list familiar with Omega installations?  

I am not.  All I can say is that your changes, to make Omega more in
line with the other formats/engines, sound correct to me, according to
the principles we've laid out.

   -- moving hyphenation stuff from tex/lambda/base
      to tex/generic/omegahyph/ (not sure about that)

Well, hyphenations don't seem like they would be lambda-specific to me,
so tex/lambda/base does not seem right.  Omega-specific, if anything.
However, collecting them under tex/generic seems good to me.

I wonder about tex/generic/hyphen instead of tex/generic/*hyph ... in
fact, the TDS even mentions tex/generic/hyphen ... doesn't really
matter.

   -- clearly separate antomega things from lambda/omega basic packages

I've never even heard of antomega.  Sorry.

I'd be in favour of dropping all those omega-related things anyway. 
unless/uintil Omega emerges from the doldrums,
its just misleading shipping it out to real people. Alelph seems a bit 
more rational.

geez, what do I know. I never used Omega for more than 5 minutes, 
because it never seemed to work :-}

What I'm saying for weeks now: if there are no rules to make connection
between package names and files (or directories), then we are bound to
maintain tpm files by hand, what I don't want to do anymore because it is
error prone. Without automation, I won't package them for a win32 installer.

OK, will do the first turn, but, my dear boss, please give me the current
recipe for tpm. In fact, I'm somehow blind what to do with all that
stuff in texmf and texmf-dist (e.g. how it will merged for the final 
release, etc.). I'd be happy to start my usual task of checking/correcting
packages but please let me know all those principles.

I'm so sorry, but I found some incompatibilities in pdfetex in dvi mode.
My silly test, attached in il1test.zip, or in case that the mailer could
remove it, available from 
ftp:/ftp.gust.org.pl/TeX/GUST/test/il1test.zip
can show you that some primitives give strange output, e.g. not expected
headlines and footers using pdfetex based latex format. This example can
be compared with 'latex' or 'pdflatex' from TeX Live 2003 against the
*current* stuff from P4 depot (pdf(e)tex 1.20b-2.1).

Ps. Martin, your 'Bye' was rejected, so I'd still like to hear your

Whatever else we may end up doing, can we agree on a short-term goal of 
getting
a  testable system based on the current web2c 7.5.3 source tree from 
Olaf, and
an uptodate texmf tree?

Could the binary compilers roll up their sleeves and generate new sets 
of binaries,
and I'll attempt to resurrect a texmf tree and an installer?

forget aboutr backward compatibility and all that for the moment; lets 
get the thing
working in its intended new way; then sit back and take stock of where 
we are. At that point
we can decide on whether to appoint a new leader, how to manage future 
change,
what the timetable should be, how to test, etc etc. But until TeX Live 
is actually *working*,
I for one cannot decide anything.

only the binary; i also made sure to keep files out of my tree because (esp 
the math->xml stuff, because a lot of unneeded things are loaded then due 
to strange automatisms)

at bachotek john told the audience that he was working on a c++ version 
that would be stable which implied that the current one is instable; afaik 
aleph is mors stable but uses an older version, which is no problem if the 
new stuff does not work right anyway;

i'd say: if no advanced omega user submits it, drop it and wait till 
someone with enough knowledge packages it for you; in the meantime ship 
guiseppe's aleph with the minimum amount of files; i suspect most omega 
users to have their own files in their local tree anyway (filters, fonts, 
macros)

i know; only non tex stuff stays there and i only wanted to point out that 
patterns are a border case (patterns packages in primitives); this would 
also mean that in pinciple the pdftex map files can go since we can build 
files like:

psfonts.tex ==

\pdfmapline{....}
\pdfmapline{....}

and put those files in some texmf/tex/pdftex path after which we got rid of 
fonts/enc/pdftex which makes live even more simple.

(in a way it's a pitty that tfm files don't go into the texinputs path as 
well because now one cannot test for their existence in convenient ways 
from within tex)

>Again, it is a matter of search paths which should become simpler.

sure, but looking at what goes into those paths (esp the kind of content in 
the 'tex' files) i get more and more lost in the logic -)

patterns, fonts and macros are different things; either we treat all things 
as equal and put them all under tex, or we organize them according to their 
function and content; i'll explain this in more detail when we meet again; 
it does not hurt tex now, and it make no sense to keep reorganizing the 
tree, but in tex-descendants things may/will be different, but then there 
will be maybe another tree altogether

concerning patterns, just look at the content, filenames and locations ... 
it's a bit of a mess; for instance, they are encoding dependent but do you 
see any relation between filenames and encodings (only ru and uk); there 
are old ane new versions, but no date of introduction; some are 
multi-encoding ones, they use their own private set of macros, some names 
have two char, some three char language codes, i see something bahyph.sh 
there (i wonder where that will end up under texmf/scripts (which subpath: 
generic, hyphen, language, enc ?)); btw, the names of files have improved 
over time; it is in itself interesting that the area that tex is strong in 
(hyphenation) is organized this way -)

There are some problems compiling (in fact configuring) on alpha (and/or
others):

configuring in xpdf
...
checking for POSIXized ISC... no
../../../../TeX/libs/xpdf/configure: AC_PROG_CC_STDC: command not found
checking for c++... c++


But worse:
configuring in utils/lcdf-typetools

checking build system type... Invalid configuration `alphapca56-unknown-linux-gnu': machine `alphapca56-unknown' not recognized
configure: error: /bin/sh ../../../../TeX/utils/lcdf-typetools/config.sub alphapca56-unknown-linux-gnu failed

Is it enough to copy config.sub from somewhere else to lcdf-typetools?

That was caused by change #4366 (Sebastian remade the configure files).
I have tried the same some days ago and TeX/libs/xpdf/configure failed
for me, too. So I did a "p4 revert TeX/libs/xpdf/configure" before
submitting stuff.

The reason for the failiure is that Martin (no offense, just a fact :-)
has used a different approach then me for adopting xpdf to our
needs. While I have eliminated checks for the xpdf viewer and adjusted
the configure.in to work with autoconf-2.13, Martin has taken a different
route.

The conclusion is that TeX/libs/xpdf/configure should be taken out of
reautoconf, because this is supposed to work with autoconf-2.13. Or,
Martin might as well decide to switch to my approach for the configure
stuff for xpdf (it is available in yesterday's teTeX-beta). I plan to
keep my approach for teTeX, so the extra work needed for the adoption
to old autoconf will be done by me anyway.

> Is it enough to copy config.sub from somewhere else to lcdf-typetools?

config.sub and config.giess should be considered as a matching pair. One
can replace them with a new version, but this should be done everywhere,
then.

Karl, do you have a good location for these files? Can you auto-update them?
In fact, I somehow thought that you were already doing this.

a TPM?

I suspect you, I and Staszek all work in different ways about the 
process of making/creating
TPM. My regular task is to take package X from CTAN and reinsert it into 
TL. Can you
outline the process you suggest I go through to do that?

Sure, you are right regarding the file contents. But, Staszek's question
was about what to do *now*. And, given today's applications which access
pattern files along the regular texinputs path, there is no other way
to go.

I am sure that you can easily write a parser for pdftex (at macro level)
that could even read the original map files (if the would exist in the

Still, that's not the question. At least: not now...

Being a TeX macro programmer, you want everything in the texinputs

Actually, it is even simpler than that. Apart from the usual bookkeeping
(looking for missing bits of info in the Catalogue, file sizes, etc), what
does tpm-factory is:

perl tpm-factory.pl --new=Package/foo

create an empty package. There is a correspondence:
Package <-> texmf-dist
Documentation <-> texmf-doc
TLCore <-> texmf

After that, it is expected that all the files for your 'foo' package are
located under directories belonging to this package and unique to it (its
namespace). If foo is a classical package, such locations are:

texmf-dist/tex/${format}/foo/*
texmf-dist/fonts/{afm,type1,vf,tfm,...}/${vendor}/foo/*
etc.

So all you have to do is to pick up a name for your package, put the files
in the tds under locations like texmf-dist/.../foo/ and tpm-factory.pl will
inspect them and build the list of files:

perl tpm-factory.pl --clean --name=Package/foo --arch=all --patterns=auto

Those rules work for texmf-dist and texmf-doc. There are no such rules for
texmf (ie: TLCore). In this case you have to rely on the patterns. Adding
files in texmf is done by editing the texmf/tpm/foo.tpm file, changing the 
patterns lists, then:

perl tpm-factory.pl --clean --name=TLCore/foo --arch=all --patterns=from

Checking, especially coverage is done by:

perl tpm-factory.pl --arch=all --type=Package --check=cov > cov.log
(use 'TLCore' and 'Documentation' respectively for --type, or even 'all').

OK, so I process my CTAN package, populate the main texmf-dist tree with 
it, and run the script. It doesn't matter if its
a new package or an old package.

What about the TPM:Execute statements? add by hand later?

    patterns, fonts and macros are different things; 

Not entirely.  Patterns and macros can both be read as (ini)tex input
files.  Fonts cannot.  This is the justification for putting patterns
under tex/.

    Karl, do you have a good location for these files? 

Ultimately, they come from the config project on savannah.
http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/config

I copy them around to various other places.

    Can you auto-update them?
    In fact, I somehow thought that you were already doing this.

I autoupdate the ones at the top level of Master.

I guess I could update every config.sub and config.guess in the tree,
or at least those in source.development.

If it is a new one, you need to create it (--new) and to clean it (--clean 
--patterns=auto).
 
> What about the TPM:Execute statements? add by hand later?

Yes, as long as you don't --new it again, these additions are preserved.

The main point it to keep connection between directories and package names.
Example: the stuff by J?rg Knappen. There are ec/fc fonts and support files
for latex. Either we create a jknappen package and it will catch all those
files or we create an ec package, and fc package and a package that can't be
called jknappen (because ec and fc are 'under' jknappen), so I called it
jknapltx for the latex support files.

Yes.  As I've noted before, it's unlikely I'll be able to do much for
about two weeks (or one-and-a-half by now).  But please try to get as
much experience with the current sources as we can in the period, and
I can use the feedback later.

Exactly.  As far as I'm concerned we should

- First get things to work at all.
- Peferably according to the new way.
- Then take stock what it would take to do things like
  - automatic conversion (or even just detection) of the old way
  - implement some backward compatibility

So lets gird our loins and go forth.  We can always resume the
fighting later.  ;-)

    Please, do not edit tpm files by hand. 

In that case, I would like to set up something that automatically
regenerates them nightly and checks in any changes.  (We should have
been doing this all along.)  Can you help me?  Or are you doing this
already?

This comes up because I just fixed a bug in install-live.sh that caused
an infinite loop on installation.  It runs to completion now, but there
are complaints about quite a few files, probably mismatches between the
tpm's and what's actually checked in.

Thanks,

Thanks.

But still, there is more:

make[2]: Leaving directory `/mirror/norbert/texlive/p4-base/Build/source.development/Work/TeX/libs/libpng'
cd libs/xpdf/xpdf; make libxpdf.a
make[2]: Entering directory `/mirror/norbert/texlive/p4-base/Build/source.development/Work/TeX/libs/xpdf/xpdf'
Makefile:23: *** missing separator.  Stop.



Makefile:23 is 
	ac_include ../../texk/make/library.mk
huu, what should be this?

And (make didn't come all the way there) at the bottom there is another:
	ac_include xpdf/depend.mk

            ac_include ../../texk/make/library.mk

Just hypothesizing wildly here ...

I invented ac_include in order to be able to include common fragments in
Makefiles (which get autoconf substitutions).  It's supposed to get
expanded by configure, but I had to hack autoconf for that, and the
feature never got into the base code.

So if a standard autoconf-generated configure is being run, the
ac_include will end up in the output.  Either the ac_include support has
to get put into configure, or the files have to get manually included in
Makefile.in before running configure.  The latter should at least let
you proceed, but it's definitely no fun.

I'm not sure what the real answer is.

Oops... Seing that
  autoconf -m ../../texk/etc/autoconf
failed and also seing that the "new" autoconf processed a configure
without error message, I thought that the new autoconf was the right
one to use.

Obviously, this was wrong, and neither version of autoconf works.
Lokks like the setup in itself has become inconsistent. Sorry for not
checking that my change really works (well, at least, I did not make it
worse -- it also did not compile before).


Given Martin's mail, I just decided to sync with my version (#4817). For
this, I have completely eliminated all source files that the library does
not need. The reason is that this allows it better to check which autoconf
tests are really needed (e.g. by grep'ing fore HAVE_ in the sources).

After that, I could compile the library successfully.

i actually did that once for another (forgotten) reason but hapilly removed

as macro programmer indeed, (i'm currently writing mostly scripts, and then 
the tds tree and searching can be a pain); for instance if fonts were in 
the texinputs path, then one could test for the presence of tfm files adn 
write more robust font systems; on the other hand, i cross my fingers with 
the current settings: if latex wouldn't use the 'sty' suffix, clashes would 
be more probable (in context i try to do restrictive searches but there are 
cases where problems may surface when files with certain names suddenly end 
up in the tree; i had that once with metapost and mpgraph.mp suddenly being 
present in the mp path)

here, i often split things up and use more paths, which is why my messy dev 
tree does not match tds;

you're lucky that i don't ask you to provide xmlinputs -)

which reminds me: we may need some place some day in tds where we put xml 
schema's (i really mean this; i now put them under ../tex); how to deal 
with suffixes and kpse is then tricky to sort our (xml, xsd, rng, ...); for 
instance, such files are not really tex files but will sometimes be read by 
tex; a bit like with graphics (eps bb parsing, pdf inclusion; and therefore 
related to texinputs;  the problem with schemata is that editors and 
parsers sometimes need them and the question is what will determine the path.

(some more control of what to read in can be reached with the next kpse lib 
esp when kpse searching can be controlled from within \input (relative 
paths, pathvar driven search and so; we really need that granularity: 
\input $xmlinputs//whatever.xml and so, but i'm told that it's coming; by 
that time i think we shoul dextend tex with a new input command as well)

I disagree with any locale dependences! I have got experiences with many
terminals, where /home is shared, tex-binary is shared, tex-data is shared
but results are different due to locales. This is very big confusion
for users.

There exist programs which scann the log output from TeX.
The results of these programs will be depend on momentary locale setting.
This is very bad idea.

TeX is system independent. I dont know, if all possible operating systems
have locale available. I mean that it si not true. Why TeX will
become locale dependent only on systems where locales are implemented?

We can compare TeX with a calculator with well defined input
and output. For example input: 1+1, otput: 2. I mean that
this conversion from input to oputput have not to
be depend on something as locales.

OK. It seems that -8bit is equivalent to -translate-file=cp8bit.

This is not actually true. It is possible to activate this conversion in
\specials (but it is not default behaviour of course). See section 4 in
encTeX documentation.

Given that TeX can auto-generate missing TFM files (calling mktextfm
on demand), the presence of the TFM files in TeX input paths would add
nothing more than extra confusion. It will not let you to find out if
a particular font is really present - it's absence may be "temporary"

The LH fonts (support for cyrillic in many encodings, many sizes etc.)
are an example. The tfm's of LH fonts are autogenerated from MF sources
because the total number of tfm's of LH fonts is very big (many hunderds
or many thousands). This behavior is currently supported on texlive 2003.

Thanks, me too. new alpha-linux binaries build on debian/woody will be
submitted in a minute.

I got 226 bins in source.development/bin/alphapca56-unknown-linux-gnu.

What I am missing is: ofm2opl opl2ofm ovf2ovp ovp2ovf

What has happened with them? It looks like the subdir omegaware in web2c
is not included in the build process. Is this true?

There are also tools to generate metrics for type1 fonts on the fly,
see Eddie Kohler's autofont:
  http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/autofont-mktextfm.1.html

Anyway, I don't think that we really want to have tfm files in the
texinputs searchpath.

That's my fault.

omegafonts/Makefile.in has a "install-links" target to create these
links, but I have disabled "install-links" in web2c/Makefile.in if
fmtutil is used.

While it is right that we don't want web2c's Makefile to create tex-engine
related links, we do want these links. So, my change to Olaf's Makefile
(disable install-links) has this drawback, but I don't see a clean
solution at the moment.  Olaf has already written to me that web2c's
Makefile does either too much (with install-links enabled) or too less.
He wants to find a better solution.

Until then, I think we can live with a work-around in TeX/Makefile.in:

        # temporary fix for missing links
        test -x texk/web2c/omegafonts/omfonts && \
          cd texk/web2c/omegafonts; $(MAKE) install-links

I am about to make that change. We can take it out if we have a better
solution inside of web2c.

Furthermore, the presence of a TFM file does not guarantee usability

    TeX is system independent.

No, TeX has always been system-dependent in the tty/log output.

I can see that having a way to achieve system-independent output may be
desirable, but I think it cannot be the priority right now.

David Kastrup has written on the tetex-pretest list:
    Uh oh.  As I said, preview-latex works by analyzing error messages.
    Those need to be in 8bit.  There are several Unix implementations with
    broken locales, and the Windows implementations tend to don't have
    anything even faintly resembling locales, too (typical for fpTeX).

    In addition, it is very common to let LaTeX run on Latin-1 texts even
    when the default system locale happens to be UTF-8.  Within Emacs, I
    just interpret the output according to the coding of the input, and
    the results look fine.

    In the case of broken or inconsistent locales, about the only workable
    alternative was to specify --translate-file=cp8bit for every call of
    TeX/LaTeX.

    The way the description of the new behavior sounds, not even this will
    help against systems with broken locale settings now: the TeX error
    messages will refuse to use the encoding of the input files even then.

In the past, he could work around any locale-dependency by adding using
cp8bit.tcx; this no longer helps. For him (resp. his software), the new
setup is a step backward :-(

Just an idea...

Also, too many people in the CC line, so I elided all of them and am using

It isn't, because cp8bit.tcx doesn't make _all_ characters printable.

It's impossible to achive this since in general it is impossible to
find out from within TeX engine what is the "meaning" (unicode value)
of a particular character used in a document or glyph in the font.

Sorry? I agree that MS doesn't implement the full set of LC_* stuff, but you
surely can change the coding use to display text on the console.

I'll have a look at preview-latex with the new tex engine.

I even wonder if it is desirable, as long as the program has to be used by
humans. I wonder if there is a single program which is system independent
and which provides interaction to the user. 

The problem is not to ignore system dependencies, but rather to integrate
them so the behavior will look as natural as possible.

Maybe that the behavior in batch interaction mode should be different than
the normal one?

I've removed them, they bore no relationship to reality.
Thanks for the report.

    When is the next update of texlive (version 2004) ?

Unknown.

I'll let you know when there's something to test, though, if you like.
Early testing is always appreciated :).

That would be very welcome.  Basically, to make it work correct with
8bit inputs, the input must be echoed cleanly in error messages, not
using things like ^^a1 or so.

>From what Thomas described, it would appear that the new Web2c engine
would make that impossible on systems without properly configured 8bit
locales (which includes a lot of proprietary Unices, and also quite a
few Linux systems with default configurations).

Fabrice, if you have any suggestions with regard to our MS-Windows
installation/usage sections in the manual and with the installation
scripts, both in preview-latex as in AUCTeX (which has completely
changed in that respect in CVS, but not yet released), they would be
very welcome: we'd like to reach a state where every fool can install
and use AUCTeX out of the box, without having to revert to something
like XemTeX.

We are currently trying to get something good and complete enough for
an intermediate AUCTeX release that should, hopefully, also work with
Windows systems.  While we have currently one tester involved with
MikTeX, fpTeX is not covered by any means.

And we are also very light on XEmacs testers: basically, if some of
the testers thinks of it, he looks whether AUCTeX at least installs on
Emacs-20.7 and XEmacs-21.4.something, and appears to work
superficially.

So if you have suggestions about where to recruit more people that
help with testing, writing installation instructions and other manual
material, that would be welcome.

Unless I'm very much mistaken, loading cp8bit.tcx would not affect
visible characters on the console in the prevous version either.  So
I don't think the new version is a regression.

OK, will try now.

So it means that the users will have installed:
texmf/
texmf-dist/
texmf-doc/

moreover, texmf-var/ (only for formats) and texmf-local/ (for _working_
configuration files and later user's additions) will be also obligatory
(texconfig on unix write formats in texmf-var/ and build texmf-local/
with copies of some conguration files).
We'll end with 5 texmf trees (not counting $HOMETEXMF). 
So complicated from the user's point of view and understanding :(

As I understand, we need the main texmf/ for compiling process, but 
without many files from texmf-dist/ it cannot be done (e.g. we need
also ..../tex/generic/ruhyphen/ etc. etc.).
Would you please enlighten me more?

As you note, this is encTeX-specific and not the default behaviour
even there.  So if we're dicussing what the behaviour used to be for
the sake of determining what requirements are imposed by backward
compatibility, then we don't need to take that into account.

To pull the locale-dependency we'd have to make this change:

@x
{ The web2c locale dependency is here -- it is correct if we assume
  that pseudoprinting goes to the terminal or log file.
  We do not have to check |special_printing| here: we never want to
  do the printable check for specials, and |selector| equals
  |new_string| whenever |special_printing| is true. }
if ((selector<no_print) and (@<Character |s| cannot be printed@>))
    or ((selector>no_print) and (selector<=pseudo) and (not isprint(xchr[s])))
then begin print_visible_char("^"); print_visible_char("^");
@y
{ We do not have to check |special_printing| here: we never want to
  do the printable check for specials, and |selector| equals
  |new_string| whenever |special_printing| is true. }
if (selector<=pseudo) and (@<Character |s| cannot be printed@>)
then begin print_visible_char("^"); print_visible_char("^");
@z

So it is pretty simple to do this.  The catch is that if you do get
unprintable stuff spewed on a terminal, the terminal's status may get
thoroughly screwed.

The build procedure writes to texmf. Reading from texmf-dist is needed if
one actually wants to create the format files during "make install". If
texmf-dist is not found during "make install" (e.g. because the prefix
points somewhere else), this causes no harm; only: you don't get any
format files.

"fmtutil --all" checks for all enabled formats if it can find the .ini
file specified in the config file. If not found, the format in question
does not get build (without error).

How would we recoginze "batch mode"?  interaction_mode in TeX?  Not
connected to a terminal?  Other?

Perhaps we should drop the locale-dependency altogether.  Opinions/Votes?

I might have missed a few beats with regard to Web2C.  And I've always
been able to pummel my own locales into submission rather than revert
to translation files.

But I know that we have recommended the --translate-file=cp8bit as a
last resort to people in the past when all other options have failed.
Sounds like this escape path is no longer open.

Anyway, with AUCTeX the interpretation of the byte stream coming from
the terminal output is done with the coding system that the original
file has been in.  In this case, I really want to have the terminal
output messages be in the same encoding as the input file, regardless
of what the system locale happens to be.  Perhaps some environment
variable might be used for indicating this mode of completely
transparent output messages?

It would appear to be the "natural" choice for usage inside of TeX
shells, and it would mean that we don't have to hand-hold people
through configuring a workable 8bit-locale even when the actual
locale is completely irrelevant for the TeX shell operation.

    unprintable stuff spewed on a terminal, the terminal's status may get
    thoroughly screwed.

Indeed.

Here are my opinions:

1) for every release of Web2c TeX and TeX Live ever made, the default
   has been to use the locale-dependent isprint to determine whether to
   use ^^ notation for the log/tty output.  Am I wrong about that?
   Assuming that is correct, I don't think we should change it for TL.

1a) If the default for encTeX has always been to have 8-bit tty/log
   output, then by all means, that should remain true -- when the enctex
   extensions are enabled.  I am assuming that enctex stuff is disabled
   by default.  Is that correct?
   
2) it is highly desirable for installers to be able to change this
   default, system-wide, with a config file option.  Can they do so now?

3) it is highly desirable for users (and programs) to be able to
   override the installed default, with a config file/runtime option as
   Thomas suggests.  Can they do so now?

I do not like the idea of the output printability algorithm depending on
the interaction mode.

The question in my mind is the one te asked dak -- how was dak getting
8-bit output on the terminal with last year's release?


I guess we have to go through this stuff at least once a year, I hope
this will be the time for this year :).

In the AUCTeX shell, we have the possibility of enabling source
specials.  Being a curious guy, I wanted to see what happens in
PDFTeX.

So I tried it:

bash-2.05b$ pdftex -src "\relax xxx"
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.11a (Web2C 7.5.2)
 Source specials enabled.
 %&-line parsing enabled.
 (/usr/local/TeX/texmf/web2c/cp8bit.tcx)
{/var/lib/texmf/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg}
Babel <v3.7j> and hyphenation patterns for english, french, german, ngerman, ca
talan, croatian, czech, danish, dutch, estonian, finnish, greek, hungarian, ita
lian, latin, mongolian, norwegian, polish, portuguese, romanian, russian, slove
ne, serbocroat, slovak, spanish, swedish, ukenglish, ukrainian, welsh, dumylang
, nohyphenation, loaded.
Segmentation fault
bash-2.05b$ 

Without Source Specials, this will work.  With PDFLaTeX, it will work
(don't know what it does, though).  But with plain PDFTeX, it dumps
core.  I regenerated formats: still dumps core on Source Specials.
It does not help to set \pdfoutput to 0.

Well, ok,

tex -src "\relax xxx"

also dumps core, so this may be expected.

I believe it was added in 7.1, requested by Bernd Raichle.  Since then
it has been heavily modified.  I suspect that -- for the original
purpuse -- the current combination of TCX plus -8bit is a better match
than locales.

Formally (from my p.o.v. at least) encTeX has only been recently added
to web2c.  encTeX is disabled by default.

The "default" is only affected by setting the locale.  I'm not sure I
really want to pile on another set of flags modifying the behaviour.
Especially since I doubt we could reach agreement on what they'd have
to be/do.

    combination of TCX plus -8bit is a better match than locales.

So you are proposing to make those options (-8bit + tcx files) also
affect tty/log file output, instead of using isprint?

I am not sure about this.  Log/tty output was never meant to be
system-independent.

Petr, you say users are confused because when everything is shared, but
the locale is different, the output is different.  I can understand
that, in a way.  But in another way, when the locale is different, why
wouldn't the tty/log output be different?  I mean, you wouldn't expect
"cp --help" to output the same string when LANG=fr and LANG=C.

Also, I suspect some users will be confused if they have LC_CTYPE=C and
get 8-bit output on their terminal *like they never did before*.

On the other hand, perhaps most users would prefer it.  I suppose 8-bit
tty/log output would not actually cause much consternation, anyway,
since it will only come about when the document is using 8-bit
characters anyway.  So I don't object vociferously.

If we do this, we should make sure there is a way to revert back to
7-bit output. I suppose --trans=7bit.tcx would suffice.

One other question: are any settings regarding this available in
texmf.cnf?  I think that could be very useful.  It can be much more
convenient to provide a config file when overrides are necessary than to
change every command line invocation, let alone rebuild formats.

That is the only serious alternative, as far as I'm concerned.

Agreed.  And they are/were intended for human consumption rather than
to be processed by a machine, which explains some of the oddities in
there.

Basically, with plain TeX mode the 8bit stuff should be off.  With
latex, my understanding is that people want it on, and same for
context.  But in both of these cases, only eight-bit input will get
you eight-bit output.

You'd have to write a 7bit.tcx that actively suppresses printability
for all but the range 32..127 inclusive.  Easy to to with the new
code, but it would have to be done.

There are currently _no_ settings for this in texmf.cnf.

    latex, my understanding is that people want it on, and same for
    context.  

Ohhh, this is yet another wrinkle.  I am not sure at all that it should
depend on the format.  I haven't heard that proposed before.

We need more input. Folks, shall we:

1) keep tty/log output locale-dependent via isprint, as it's always been
   before?  Users and systems then set LC_CTYPE (or whatever) to control it.
   Or:   

2) make -8bit + tcx files affect tty/log output, even when LANG=C?
   Would this perceived to be a general improvement for users? 
   And:

2a) If 2, should we make all the formats the same by default, or turn
   off 8bit tty/log for plain, or only turn on 8bit tty/log for latex?
   (I'm guessing context would also want 8bit tty/log, if latex does.)

Ultimately, I guess I personally don't have strong feelings about it.
It seems desirable to me for all formats to be treated the same.

    You'd have to write a 7bit.tcx that actively suppresses printability
    for all but the range 32..127 inclusive.  Easy to to with the new
    code, but it would have to be done.

Understood.

    There are currently _no_ settings for this in texmf.cnf.

Feasible to add, or not?

I'm imagining something like
translate_file = 7bit.tcx
...
(We wouldn't have any setting in there by default.)

Aleph uses *exactly* the same external files as Omega (1.15), 
so I would say it's better to keep those omega-related things 
around, at least until the Aleph project comes out with its 
own.

(Back on some older mail.)

    the boundary condition that files are unique is a dangerous one
    (where did it come from?);

It has been there since I first implemented subdirectory searching for
Web2c, what, 15 years ago or so (gadzooks!).  In any given search path,
if two files have the same name, it's indeterminate which one you'll get.

    PDFTEX.MAPPATH

Indeed, since the map files are incompatible, we could need more search
paths.  However, in practice, I note that right now there are no
filename duplications within texmf*/fonts/map.  So I guess we have
muddled through to this point.

A better solution, as many have pointed out but none have implemented,
would be to make map files more consistent between programs, with a
commonly-agreed syntax for extensions so that programs can ignore
extensions not meant for them or not implemented yet.  Unfortunately I
cannot take that on.  Is anyone inclined?

    i still need to patch texfont to the latest changes

    or maybe i should just decide for enc/pdftex to make things easier);

I guess I am inclined to keep things as they are:

fonts/enc/<package>/whatever
fonts/map/<package>/whatever

Regarding map files, no rename from dvips to generic.  As Thomas said,
there's lots of other kinds of (completely different) map files in the
world.

Regarding enc files, it doesn't seem to me that we need the additional
level of ps, truetype, svg, etc.  Encoding files in non-PostScript
formats might certainly come to exist, but they will still be installed
by/for certain packages.  Filename extensions seem like a better way to
distinguish between formats, if we need to in the future.

So unless there are objections ...

Only one question: is Aleph included in the default build?

I need to know if it builds on non-Intel-32 platforms, since 
that's the only one I can actually test it on. And if it 
doesn't I need to know what needs to be changed so that we can 
make it a standard part of the distribution.

Yes. And lambda format is built using aleph. So my previous questions 
concerned what we need for building lambda, what to do with antomega,
omegabook, etc. Also, do we need special language.dat for lambda
(with available 16-bit patterns)?

As far as, Norbert compiled it for linux on Alpha.
Of course, if we want to promote aleph, we need also some documentation 
;-)

It's part of the reason why xord/xchr/xprn are dumped in the format.
Remember that the trip test requires the original "printable ASCII"
behaviour, and that this is the documented behaviour for plain TeX as
well.  And writing to terminal and log are specifically exempted from
this requirement, though the trip test is best run in the C locale at
present.

I suspect the damage an ill-chosen default could cause would be

If the code is to be common, it might make sense to move the parser
into either web2c/lib/lib.a or into linkpathsea (the latter perhaps in
the longer run).

The main issue to figure out what has to be implemented.  Once that is
known, it shouldn't be hard.

As far as I remember, a test has been added to prevent source specials when
pdfoutput=1. However I have no clue why you get a core dump.

I made tests with the current release and got no problems. Ideally, the -src
option should do what Heiko's vpe package does and put the same information
in the pdf file.

No every releases.
Till 2002:    if no --translate-file was specified then isprint() from
              locale was activated.
              if --transalte-file was specified then TeX was fully locale
              independent.
TeXlive 2003: The tty/log output was separed from \write output.
              The --translate-file affects only \write output and
              isprint() from locales is active for tty/log output
              regardless --translate-file is specified.

This change was a source of confusions because it was not cleanly
documented. Users lose the security that if --transalte-file is used then
we are sure that all textual outputs are controlled by TCX table.

i'm no longer sure what a package is; dvips and context both are, so i had:

fonts/enc/context/...
fonts/map/context/...

but -according to posted guidelines- now changed it (for the last time) in:

fonts/enc/dvips/context/...
fonts/map/pdftex/context/...

before i post any update of context, i want to test my mini-texlive with 
new binaries first

then maybe it's time to adapt the triptest to pdfetex, i.e. pdftex etex

You are right. I just have repeated yesterday's test with
teTeX-1.0. Indeed, without tcx, everything depends on the locale.
With tcx, nothing depends on it any more.

I think, this also explains what dak has observed. So, his argument
is still valid (things becoming worse for him / his program). Only the
point of time when this (has) happened is a different one...

Hi,

It seems that the tex-live list archives at
http://tug.org/mailman
have been switched from public to private. What that to prevent
spambots from harvesting email addresses? I find it slightly
unfortunate that non-list members won't be able to search the
archives any more, that search engines like Google won't be
able to crawl the archives and that current search results
on Google now point to the dead directory tree at
www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/

Best,

cp --help is a subjet of user interface. IMHO, TeX has no user interface,
it is only convertor or calculator (as I mentioned formerly).
Locales are support for applications where user interface is implemented,
no for convertors with well defined input and output such as TeX.

I an not the advocate of the following concept:

LC_ALL=cs tex
Toto je TeX, verze 3.14159 (Web2C ...)
**\aaa
! Nedefinovana ridici sekvence.
<*> \aaa
?
*\end
Zadna strana na vystupu
Zaznam o behu je zapsan do texput.log

I am happy if TeX deals the same output to tty/log everytime.

IMHO, the unreadable terminal (very few instances) is less wrong than
locale dependency.

The readability is not better if ^^ab format is used.

I understand that some escape sequences can totally kill the terminal
but this is not the subject of our interres. The codes >= 128
are safe and cannot break any terminal.

csplain, for example, has its csTRIP test based on scanning the log
output. The log have to be 8bit for codes >=128. We reached this aim by
--translate-file setting in all previous TeXlive versions but not in
the last one. This is bad news for us.

Yes, that was the thought behind. 
Besides, the list is not of a 'texhax' type but basically devoted to the 
development/production issues and probably of little interest to non-members.

Anyone can subscribe and read the archives... And, sometimes people get
new bosses, and prefer not to have old postings plastered all over Google.
What do others think?

ok, so there's formally something called <syntax>

(Karl: you said:

   fonts/map/<package>/whatever

so you probably have to add to the documentation: <syntax> -being 
dvips|pdftex|dvipdfmx- and <package> being afm2pl|context|... )

I think so. Aleph can use TeX's 8-bit patterns, but not the 
converse. Maybe we can make Lambda look up LaTeX's language.dat 
first and then another languagesomething dot something for the 
extra patterns?

    can you fill in the next table? *=mapped ^^=escaped

Sorry, too terse, I can't make sense of "natural.tcx" or
"operating_system", and the chart was misformatted in my Emacs.

Only the behavior of log files (which wasn't in your list) and terminal
output is under discussion.  (I don't know the behavior for the other
things you list.)

I'll repeat.

The question is whether (1) to keep tty/log dependent on the system
locale, i.e., system environment variables such as LC_CTYPE, as it was
in 2003.

Or (2) to make tty/log output use the --8bit option and tcx files.  (If
neither is specified, Olaf has Knuth's definition, ie ASCII, as a
default.  It doesn't matter in practice, since the format files will get
built with 8bit.)

We know that Petr feels they should depend on --8bit/tcx.  I don't
disagree, especially since Petr has reminded us that with
--translate-file until 2002, isprint() was not used.

operating system is that what the os does with output if it does something 
at all (the locale stuff); terminal is that what tex sends to the os 
display engine

natural.tcx is the real 8 bit tcx file (not the incorrect cp8bit which is 
incomplete)

sure, but esp writes are influenced by the tcx machinery

....

i have no strong opinions on what goes to the terminal; the log -if 
possible- should honor 8 bit (imo)

Ok, I seem to have reached my goal with files and their location.

I won't claim that my perl scripts are bullet proof or well documented, but
well, at least they seem to provide the kind of functionality I was looking
for. They can handle the 50000+ files of the Master directory.

All the files in the bin/ and texmf(-dist|-doc)? Tree are handled by
Tools/tpm-factory.pl. I have another tool which allows me to 'sync' 2 trees
based on a root tpm, example: sync the texlive effective files between
c:/program files/TeXLive (destination) and c:/source/texlive/Master (depot
copie) forth and back. This was not exactly obvious to do because I wanted
it to work with the xemtex subtree of it too, so the syncing should be
intelligent enough to remove / copy files only when they are inside the
source tree, but not outside of it.

All in all, Karl, you can try to automate rebuilding of tpm files with those
lines:
TOOLS=//depot/Master/Tools
perl $(TOOLS)/tpm-factory.pl --clean --patterns=from --arch=all \
--type=TLCore
perl $(TOOLS)/tpm-factory.pl --clean --patterns=auto --arch=all \

Has anybody complained about TL7 (2002) regarding garbeled terminals
or something similar?

Locales used to be disabled if tcx was in use in that version. And
due to the automatic (fallback, if no other tcx specified) loading of
cp8bit.tcx, one can say, that the default setup in TL7 was to write
full 8bit, completely independed of any locale. So, the only way to make
characters unprintable was to specify a different tcx.

If we remove the locale dependency now, we are in no way worse than
the TL7 version (regarding the possibility to "garble" a terminal).
And, we are in many ways better (enctex, xord/xchr/xprn in the format
and thus more flexible etc.)

After that came to my mind, I vote for:
  disable locales completely, just rely on the xord/xchr/xprn arrays

Well, http://texlive.sarovar.org/ says:

   Please report problems to the tex-live mailing list, but first
   check the list of known bugs and updates.

IMHO it would make sense for people to be able to search whether
their problem has been addressed before.

However sometimes I can't remember whether a particular problem
had been reported on tetex, tetex-beta, tex-k or tex-live. In
such cases it's very convenient to be able to search multiple
resources at once.

Ummh, I for one am not working in TeX related business, but I've
never found that to be a problem ... I'd have thought most of the
contributors here had a rather obvious Google profile anyway ;-)

Subject: [tex-live] updmap update
Message-ID: <20040513222537.GA6830@dbs.uni-hannover.de>

Regarding the new locations for map files, I have implemented the
following for teTeX (and checked in for TeX Live):

Each map file is searched along the new path (--format=map, usually
$TEXMF/fonts/map//) and the old path (--format='dvips config', usually
$TEXMF/dvips//). The search in the old path is only done to warn the user
that he should do something, e.g. remove a file (if an identical version
is found in the new path) or manually resolve a conflict (old/new with
different content) or move a file (file only found in old).

The messages are like this:
    mapWarn notFound pazo.map
    mapWarn badLocation /software/oss/Text/teTeX-3.0/share/texmf-dist/dvips/pxfonts.map
    mapWarn manualResolve /software/oss/Text/teTeX-3.0/share/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/lm/ts1-lm.map /software/oss/Text/teTeX-3.0/share/texmf-dist/dvips/ts1-lm.map
    mapWarn obsoleteCopy /software/oss/Text/teTeX-3.0/share/texmf-dist/dvips/txfonts.map

    updmap: Severe problems during map file lookup. Consult the manualpage for details.

Well, the part that describes this in the manpage still has to be written,
but this will be done... :-)

The next thing to be written is a command (a special invocation of updmap,
I think) that helps the user to move his files and to clean the tree
from obsolete (identical) copies.

Even though the extra searches cost some time, I don't think that I want
to implement an option to turn this off. There are too many "ready to
install" font packages or tools or instructions that can cause map files
to be installed in the wrong place.

      disable locales completely, just rely on the xord/xchr/xprn arrays

Sounds like there is no disagreement, so I'd say, Olaf, go ahead and do
it when you have a chance.

All: Olaf questions whether plain should be 7-bit or 8-bit by default,
pointing out that the TeXbook talks about ^^ notation in tty/log output
for plain.

I see that argument, but I'm not sure if it will be better or worse for
the users to have plain different than everything else.

Thoughts?

I mean that it is possible to do it format dependent. The -8bit option can
be used during generation of a format another than plain.tex and default
(no option) can be used during plain.tex format generation. The result of
this option will be saved to .fmt file (xord/xchr/xprn vectors).

Moreover, the usage or non-usage of -8bit can be hidden from user by
fmtutil utility or such similar.

The plain.tex format is dessigned only for English language. It is frozen
by author. It means that the ^^ notation of non ASCII letters cannot
interrupt any plain.tex task.

Notice, that if -enc is used, then initial values of xord/xchr/xprn
are exactly documented in encTeX documantation: The initial values of xprn
have to be set by TeXbook: only 96 ASCII characters are printable.
EncTeX users have got the tools to change these initilas: by \xprncode
setting.

My test:

$ export PATH=/t/texlive/Master/bin/i386-linux:$PATH

$ VISUAL=cat fmtutil --edit | egrep '^(aleph|lambda)'

and this fails...

So, in my test, lambda does not build, too, but obviously, the reason
is a completely different one.

    I mean that it is possible to do it format dependent. The -8bit option can

I know it's possible, I know enctex overrides this, etc., etc.  The
question is whether we *should* build plain.fmt with -8bit or not.

I guess you and Olaf are saying no, plain should remain 7bit.

So ok, unless someone else thinks otherwise, that's the decision :).

Ok, thanks. For some reason, I believe I have seen in some Makefile that
Aleph was tangled rather than otangled. I found it strange but nevertheless
applied the change. Compilation works ok, but running it fails.

Yes, because I cannot find time to learn tmp and properly clean up texmf 
tree for omega and lambda on p4 depot (I've reported that). So for my 
compilations I use somehow corrected tree and it works.

I have just adopted fmtutil.in for that (#4841). We can change that at

Aleph builds and runs fine on my Linux box. Since I have an old 
texmf tree in place, I had to shift some format sources (this 
solved Thomas problem).

In your case, it seems more like fmtutil under Windows tries to 
replace the executable and fails?

No the problem is that I tangled both aleph.web and aleph.ch instead of

Hi Olaf,

While cleaning up some files i found this mentioned in a texmf.cnf on my 
system

% You can use brace notation, for example: /usr/local/{mytex:othertex}
% expands to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  Instead of the path
% separator you can use a comma: /usr/local/{mytex,othertex} also expands
% to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  However, the use of the comma
% instead of the path separator is deprecated.
%
% The text above assumes thet path separator is a colon (:).  Non-UNIX
% systems use different path separators, like the semicolon (;).

Is this 'deprecated' still valid? If so, doesn't that make the config file 
system dependent and non portable? Since i see that the , is still used, i 
think that instead the platform dependent seperators in specs are 
deprecated (: as well as ;) in favor or a ,

actually, i got the impression that : and ; and , are all accepted as 
separators, so maybe 'deprecated' no longer is valid; the colon is 
dangerous since it can be a drive or other specs as well and if the new 
library supports url's as well ... maybe something different is needed then 
(although i think that the , is not used in any file spec on any system 
unless you use basenames with ,'s)

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 2003 on a FAT32 file system
Message-ID: <40A88D22.10908@tuwien.ac.at>

Hello,
I tried to install the new TeXLive version in a FAT32 partition for both
Linux and Win2000. Since FAT32 doesn't accept symbolic links in Linux, I
created a small directory ~/TeXLive/bin and put there all symbolic 
links, for example
~/TeXLive/bin/latex -> /dosdisk/TeXLive/bin/i386-linux/etex
and included ~/TeXLive/bin in my PATH.
Now I face a rather strange problem, when I run latex:

latex scr
lstat(./latex) failed ...
./latex: No such file or directory
This is e-TeX, Version 3.14159-2.1 (Web2C 7.3.7x)
kpathsea: Running mktexfmt latex.efmt

If I call latex with its path, it runs fine. Even more strange: If I 
call latex from the tcsh, then it also runs fine, the problem occurs for 
bash. I upgraded bash to the most recent version, but it didn't change.

If I put a link to latex into the current directory, it is also fine.

It seems that the problem is somehow caused by the following lines in
source/TeX/texk/kpathsea/progname.c

if (lstat (pre, &st) != 0) {
fprintf (stderr, "lstat(%s) failed ...\n", pre);
perror (pre);
return NULL;
}

 From here on no environment variables are found, so texmf.cnf is missed.
Of course I do not understand why it works from the tcsh.

Can the team give any recommendations how to install TeXLive on dual 
boot machines?

Could the TeXLive team maybe rethink its handling of symbolic links? 
These links are very fine in a pure unixoid environment, but especially 
in TeXLive, which is very convenient for dual-boot systems, they cause 
problems.

Best regards
Alois Steindl

PS.: I did send this mail already end of march, but I guess that it 
didn't go through, since I did not sign up.

In my experience, dual boot machines are generally more trouble than they 
are worth (you either spend most of your time under one OS, in which case 
you probably don't need the other, or you spend too much time configuring 
and booting).  FAT32 filesystems can be exploited to bypass security and 
disk space is cheap, so those who do have to use dual boot are advised to 
use FAT32 only as a temporary transfer area -- certainly not for binaries.

Network storage is also an option for sharing files, and there are virtual 
machines that allow running WIn32 under linux or linux under Win32.

You can always convert symbolic links to real copies.

Share only texmf/. Put binaries in specific locations under each
environment. You should need to set only TEXMFCNF and PATH to get a running
system.

It is clear that FAT32 nor NTFS do support symbolic links.

Colon only works on UNIX/Linux.  Semicolon works everywhere.

What we're heading to is probably one "common" syntax combined with
some support for platform-specific syntaxes.

Dear TeXLive-developers!

We are very close to finishing a book on LaTeX in Hungarian with the title
,,LaTeX Handbook''. We would like to attach a TeXLive demo CD.
I have a question. From the page http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html
it is not clear for me, how to produce a patched demo CD.
Giving the info, how to patch through Internet is clearly a wrong
solution, as probably several readers of our book has no easy
internet-connection.

If you have any idea, please inform me!

Thanks in advance,
Ferenc

Hi Ferenc,

    We would like to attach a TeXLive demo CD.

FWIW, in general I recommend using the inst cd, not demo.
demo is not complete, because there is not enough space on a CD.

    I have a question. From the page http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html
    it is not clear for me, how to produce a patched demo CD.

True enough -- the purpose of that page is to tell TL users how to
update their installations, not to produce a new TL.

The answer is, unfortunately, there is no easy way to produce a
"patched" CD.  You can produce your own image by starting with TL 2003
and doing the updates, but there's no cookie-cutter recipe for this.

I understand from Fabrice that a somewhat updated version of TL 2003 was
produced for the LaTeX Companion second edition.  We can probably get
the image for that from Frank, if you want it.  Whether it will work
better than the original TL 2003, I don't know.

    We are very close to finishing a book on LaTeX in Hungarian with the title

On the other hand, depending on what "very close" might mean, there's a
slight chance that TL 2004 would be ready.  Usually the CD production
doesn't have to get started nearly as early as the book production.


Sorry, wish I had better news for you.

Subject: [tex-live] mf online drawing delay
Message-ID: <200405182321.i4INLG106868@f7.net>

In TL 2003 (i386-linux), the following brings up the X window, but it is
blank, no dot is displayed:
  $ mf  # same result with mfw
  This is METAFONT, Version 2.71828 (Web2C 7.5.2)
  **\drawdot(10,10);
  *showit;

After a second
  *showit;
the dot shows up.

Furthermore, with this sequence, the dot is (correctly) displayed immediately:
  $ mf
  This is METAFONT, ...
  **\drawdot(10,10);showit;

Can someone test this with the current binaries?  If it's still
happening, it should be straightforward to fix.  It's not the first time
there have been sync problems like this in the display code, I remember
well and to my sorrow.

(Unfortunately I don't currently have a practical way to test
interactive X display stuff with the dev sources.)

Thanks,
k

Hi Karl, thanks for your quick answer!

uhhh, we were hesitating, but we thought, the possible demo mode has
advantages. Probably you are right, but we have to think on it, as we
mentioned the demo in the book.

Thank you very much in advance, we may need it!

Let me change the direction of your question: when do you hope that TL
2004 will be ready? (I mean a sure latest time.) Unfortunatelly, the
publisher strongly force a very quick printing, they want to close the
book in a week, because of financial reasons, we would like to postpone a
littlebit, because there is still a lot to do. (i hope, the fight is still
open, it will turn out in a few days.)

> Sorry, wish I had better news for you.

I would have to write much earlier! Thanks for your help!

I tested it with the current Master/bin/i386-linux/mf binary and the dot
shows up immediately in the first case.

But: Interestingly, moving the window (because it is too big) makes the
dot disappear (moving, not resizing!).

True enough.  It's a tradeoff.

    Let me change the direction of your question: when do you hope that TL
    2004 will be ready? 

I "hope" by July.

    (I mean a sure latest time.) 

There is no sure latest time.  It could be November, or worse.

    book in a week, 

Oh, if you're talking about a week (or even three or four weeks), 2004
definitely won't be ready.  So forget that.

I will write Frank about the image he used, so you can have that option.
Other than that, I think the only practical choice is to go with 2003,
bugs and all :(.

That's because mf is single-threaded and doesn't handle expose events
while waiting for terminal input.  As I recall not that easy to fix.

Karl,

For some years I've got a conclussion that your html version of dvips
documentation is the best one available and the only one trying to be
up-to-date (compared to dvips.tex). Please note that info files are hardly
usable for e.g. windows users (not to mention man pages), so may I ask you 
for updating the html version? I can't dare to ask for updating
also dvips.tex, which in turn is distributed everywhere in the pdf version
(see e.g. TL2003: dvips 5.66).

Sure, I will work on regenerating the HTML files from dvips.texi.
We can also generate the PDF from that.  dvips.tex should be removed, it
is not maintained.  (Tom R. himself just updated dvips.texi!)  I'll see
if I can clean that up too.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0405231125280.26380@nymfe03.fi.muni.cz>

Hello

While using TL 2003 I've found out that the mktexnam script sometimes
returns wrong paths. Like:

# mktexnam bang10
/packages/share/texlive2003/texmf-var/fonts/pk/ljfour/bitstrea/anna/bang10.600pk:/packages/share/texlive2003/texmf-var/fonts/tfm/bitstrea/anna/bang10.tfm:/packages/share/texlive2003/texmf-var/fonts/source/bitstrea/anna/bang10.mf

while the correct subdirectory should be public/bangtex. Basically, the
script uses the fontname scheme in all cases, even when it shouldn't.

This is caused by the following statement in mktexnam, after line 130:

if test "x$MT_SUPPLIER" = xunknown \
   || test "x$MT_TYPEFACE" = xunknown; then
     MT_FEATURES="$MT_FEATURES:fontmaps"
fi

# Handle the options
test -n "$MT_MKTEXNAM_OPT" && . "$MT_MKTEXNAM_OPT"

This simply appends the string ":fontmaps" to the variable MT_FEATURES
if MT_SUPPLIER or MT_TYPEFACE are unknown and the processes the mktexnam.opt
file, which after seeing the string fontmaps as part of MT_FEATURES fills
in MT_SUPPLIER and MT_TYPEFACE according to the fontname scheme.
Unfortunately, the variable MT_FEATURES contains the string "fontmaps"
even _before_ this block is processed and so even if MT_SUPPLIER and
MT_TYPEFACE were already defined, they are rewritten.

As part of its initialization, mktexnam processes file mktex.opt, which in
turn processes mktex.cnf (around line 90). It is in this file that 
MT_FEATURES is defined as "appendonlydir:varfonts:fontmaps".
As using fontmaps is considered a last resort (by comments in mktexnam),
the initialization should be probably shortened to "appendonlydir:
varfonts", unles there's some need for "fontmaps" I overlooked by
accident.

Dear masters of TeXlive!

What is the current status of the transition to cvs? Is it put on hold
for indefinite time? Some time ago there was a long discussion about
this, but since then I didn't hear about it.

Why I ask: Our institute at the Vienna University of Technology, in fact
my fellow sysadm and me, think we can provide texlive cvs repository.

I say "We think" because -- if there is interest -- we would need an
estimation on disk space and band width.

So my questions are:
- is the search for cvs access still relevant?
- if yes, did we/you came to a decision where to put it?
- if yes, does someone know about diskspace and bandwidth usage?

Best wishes

Norbert

A very generous offer, thank you.

    What is the current status of the transition to cvs? 

As I recall, Sebastian concluded the discussion by saying we would
move to CVS after the 2004 release.

    - if yes, did we/you came to a decision where to put it?

Sebastian concluded that sarovar.org was the best choice, because it is
actually run by TeX friends in India, it already has lots of
infrastructure (as well as cvs) without anyone having to take the time
to build it, and access was acceptable.


So, while it's a very kind offer, I think your TL time is better spent
on development :).

Have you considered Subversion instead of CVS (
http://subversion.tigris.org/)? (I'm only just getting started with
Subversion myself, but people I know who have tried it consider it more
elegant in use than CVS.)

My apologies if I've overlooked a discussion of a prior instance of this
suggestion.

Hi John,

    Have you considered Subversion instead of CVS (

Yes.

    Subversion myself, but people I know who have tried it consider it more
    elegant in use than CVS.)

There are technical pros and cons to every source control system,
including p4, subversion, cvs, arch, etc., etc., etc.

In my mind, the overriding advantage of cvs is that almost everyone
knows it.  One of our biggest problems with TL, if not the biggest, is
that there are very very few developers doing virtually all of the work,
and using anything but cvs is a big barrier to entry.  (Yes, I know that
mostly you just do "svn command" instead of "cvs command". Nevertheless.)

    My apologies if I've overlooked a discussion of a prior instance of this
    suggestion.

Several, actually :).  No big deal, and I'm sure we'll have to revisit
this whole discussion at least ten more times, but for now, please,
let's focus on getting 2004 closer to release.

Thanks,
k

I think the point is that TL/TUG does not want to host
its own repository; if it did, it might well be Subversion-based.
What we want is to use the resources of somewhere like Sourceforge
or Sarovar, which provide the infrastructure of project
development; CVS or SVN is just one part of this. Although
Sourceforge made noises about SVN, I don't think they are near
changing yet.

I'd not want to choose a host solely on the basis that they
offered SVN, though it would be an interesting factor.

FWIW, we use Subversion in my day job. It does its thang
well enough; and the name is way cool.

Interesting.  mktex.cnf is of course the file that you should edit to
set (or get rid of) these kinds of options.

Well, in the kpathsea sources, mktex.cnf only contains commented-out
examples.  _I_ consider using the fontmaps a last resort because they
often give results that vary wildly from the way files are currently
placed in the texmf tree (and I don't see anyone eager to go add all
the special cases in special.map).  Evidently someone, somewhere,
disagreed with me.

My personal preference is for this default to be changed.  However, I
don't consider myself the right person to mess with that part of the
tree.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0405270222270.17905-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

I found that p4 depot has (perhaps) incorrect texmf[-dist]/scripts/ 
layout:
texmf/scripts/tetex/
texmf/scripts/tex4ht/
etc.

As I remember a discussion, it should be rather:
texmf/scripts/perl/tetex/
texmf/scripts/java/...
... etc.

Only the later layout works at least on Windows with the current binaries
(e.g. updmap). However interesting that for context scripts
texmf/scripts/context/perltk/
works well for Win32 and Linux (texexec.pl). For testing I removed
PERLINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/{perl,context}//
line from texmf.cnf for both systems as it seems obsolete now.
The question is: which layout is valid for consistence:
scripts/perl/context/ vs. scripts/context/perl/

For both systems kpsewhich --show-path=texmfscripts just expands to
texmf[...]/scripts// so perhaps only updmap.exe for win32 is too 
restrictive?

Another problem is with texdoctk: for Win32 Fabrice provides all needed
perl libraries, but standard Linux installation doesn't have eg. Tk.pm.
Having RH9.0 installed I cannot even find which package can have it :(

The current draft of the new tds has:

  The top-level \path|scripts| directory is for platform-independent
  executables, such as Perl, Python, and shell scripts, and Java class
  files.  Subdirectories under \path|scripts| are package names.  This
  ...
  We recommend using extensions specifying the language (such as
  \path|.pl|, \path|.py|, \path|.sh|) on these files, to help uniquely
  identify the name.

So, scripts/context is ok. scripts/perl is not...

Subject: [tex-live] texmf backwrad compatibility -- a proposal
Message-ID: <87hdu1u0fe.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

Today there was an NTG meeting, and among the things informally
discussed was the impact of the changes to the texmf tree on users.
Based on these discussions, we'd like to propose the following
approach:

- TeX-live gets tested with the new layout, and no backward
  compatibility in place.  This was we can be certain the new layout
  works.

- Before release we add backward compatility (at least as paths to
  texmf.cnf are concerned -- code changes may be another matter).
  This will impose the least amount of grief on the users.

Why do it like this?  If things work out, _next_ year we'll have the
new kpse library to cope with, which _will_ impose changes in config
anyway.  This would be a good excuse to make a break with past, not
just for encodings and map files, but whereever we deem this to be
desirable.  With the proposed schedule, we only impose this kind of
pain once.

Comments?

There are at least some syntax changes in the texmf.cnf (no !!
anymore, other differences in how paths are specified).  There is at
least a potential for user-level changes as a result of this.

then maybe it's already good to reserve something

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive with PS/Type1-Fonts: Proposal for an enhancement
 of the TeXLive documentation
Message-ID: <40B6497D.8060709@wenzig.de>

Hello,

first let me say, that a german translation of this text can be found below.

On de.com.text.tex we discussed [1] possibilities to install PS-Fonts in 
a win32-TeXLive-system and came to the following solution which is based 
on Walter Schmidt's font packs [2] for over 40 font families of various 
manufacturers like Adobe, Bitstream and Linotype:

1. Unzip the provided zip-File for your font family in the texmf-folder, 
rename and copy the pfb and afm files of your font in the specified 
folders as described in the documentation provided by Walter Schmidt.

2. Rebuild ls-R filenames databases with mktexlsr.exe in the maintenance 
menue ('Add Tex package').

3. Execute 'updmap --edit' from the command line and insert a line 'Map 
xyz.map' in updmap.cfg which ist opened in an editor window. After 
saving the changes and closing the editor, updmap will start and the 
fonts can be used as described in the documentation of Walter Schmidt.

So far the proposal resulting from discussion.

Let me shortly add two remarks:

1. We - especially Frank Kuester - are not sure, whether it is possible 
that updmap.cfg is overwritten by some installation/update routines of 
TeXLive.

2. There was a debate on the correct syntax of updmap. Dependent on the 
used plattform and/or distribution it seems to be correct to write 
'updmap --enable Map=xyz.map' or 'updmap --enable Map xyz.map'. Although 
this option is not necessary in the proposal (it didn't work with my 
win32/TeXLive2003-system), I want to mention this.

I hope, this proposal helps to improve further versions of TeXLive. 
Don't hesitate to contact me in case of queries.

Best regards

[1] thread: <2hh192FcoguqU1@uni-berlin.de>
[2] http://home.vr-web.de/was/fonts.html - Thess font packs are AFAIK 
especially for texts in german (umlauts). I don't know whether there are 
similar developements for texts in other languages.

Here the german translation:

Hallo,

auf de.com.text.tex haben wir diskutiert [1] wie PS-Fonts in ein 
win32-TeXLive-System installiert werden koennen und haben die folgende 
Loesung entwickelt, die auf Walter Schmidt's font packs [2] fuer ueber 
40 Schriftfamilien verschiedener Hersteller wie Adobe, Bitstream and 
Linotype basiert:

1. Die zip-Datei fuer die Schriftfamilie in den texmf-Ordner auspacken, 
die pfb- und afm-Dateien des Fonts umbenennen und in die angegebenen 
Ordner kopieren, wie es Walter Schmidt in der Dokumentation beschrieben hat.

2. Mit mktexlsr.exe im Maintenance-Menu ('Add Tex package') die 
TeX-Dateidatenbanken erneuern.

3. 'updmap --edit' als Kommandozeile ausfuehren und eine Zeile 'Map 
xyz.map' in der Datei updmap.cfg einfuegen, die in einem Editor-Fenster 
geoeffnet wird. Nach dem Abspeichern und schliessen des Fensters, 
startet updmap und die Fonts koennen genutzt werden, wie es Walter 
Schmidt in der Dokumentation beschreibt.

Lasst mich noch kurz zwei Anmerkungen machen:

1. Wir - besonders Frank Kuester - sind uns nicht sicher, ob es moeglich 
ist, dass updmap.cfg von einigen Installtions- und/oder update-Routinen 
von TeXLive ueberschrieben wird.

2. Es gab eine Debatte ueber die korrekte Syntax von updmap. Anhangig 
von der verwendeten PLattform und/oder Distribution scheint es, dass es 
richtig ist 'updmap --enable Map=xyz.map' oder 'updmap --enable Map 
xyz.map' zu schreiben. Obwohl diese Option nicht notwendig fuer den 
Vorschlag ist (sie funktionierte nicht mir meinem 
win32-TeXLive2003-System), moechte ich dies erwaehnen.

Ich hoffe, dieser Vorschlag hilft keunftige Versionen von TeXLive zu 
verbessern. Zoegert nicht, Euch mit Rueckfargen an mich zu wenden.

Beste Gruesse

Subject: [tex-live] texmf backwrad compatibility -- a proposal
In-Reply-To: <871xl5ttdu.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>
Message-ID: <200405281324.i4SDOer10836@f7.net>

    There are at least some syntax changes in the texmf.cnf (no !!
    anymore, other differences in how paths are specified).  There is at
    least a potential for user-level changes as a result of this.

I certainly agree that changes to texmf.cnf that are not
backward-compatible will have at least as much impact as moving .enc and
.map files, probably more.  That is, I would guess that more users have
their own personal or document-specific texmf.cnf's than have their own
enc/maps.

So the next question is, are such changes really necessary/desirable?
You could just accept and ignore !!, for starters.  It is probably hard
to answer such questions definitively now.


Thomas already gave various examples showing why "compatible" paths have
their own problems.  Thus, I don't think it would be desirable to just
throw in TEXMF/fonts// (or whatever) to the end of the paths at the last
minute.  I don't see any practical way to test both the compatible and
clean paths; I think we'd be better off just changing now if we're going
to change.  Personally, I hope we can stick to what we all already
agreed on.

I know it's a bit late but I haven't had time to install TL 2003 untill
now.

The problem is basically stated in the subject.

Using %&latex as a way of getting metapost to use LaTeX to typeset the
labes instead of using TeX.

This has been working at least with TL 7.

A simple example

verbatimtex
%&latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
etex
beginfig(1)
  label.rt(btex \LaTeX etex, origin);
endfig;
end

I get the error:

This is MetaPost, Version 0.641 (Web2C 7.5.2)

I don't want to inform my users that from now on you will have to either
set the TEX variable to latex or use

mpost -tex=latex

(because then I'll get questions like: why doesn't the old syntax work
anymore)

Is there no way of getting back to the old behavior, that is metapost
actually understanding the &latex line?

Change the line in texmf.cnf:

It is set to t already

And in makempx it says

metapost doesn't understand the &latex line, tex does.  So what
happens what you do "tex --parse-first-line  mpxerr.tex"?  I'm betting
this:

	infovore:/tmp$ tex --parse-first-line  mpxerr.tex
	This is TeXk, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.3)
	 %&-line parsing enabled.
	---! /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/etex/latex.fmt was written by etex
	(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

though likely without the helpful '---!' message if you're using older
binaries.

We probably ought to do is change 'makempx' to get the %& line out and
use the command it finds there.  Something like this might do:

The sed expression does the following: Check if the first line starts
with %& and matches %&<whitespace>NAME<...>, in which case we set TEX
to 'NAME --parse-first-line' (there might be more options that we
didn't copy out).

If TEX is still empty after that, use the default value.

makempx.c will have to be updated as well.  :-(

Can't we put all font related files to ${TEXMF}/fonts/supplier/typeface
regardless of their format?

This would require a change in the TDS standard but I think that it is
useful.

Message-ID: <8765afqxxf.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

I've just submitted the following changes to the repository.

Change 4889 on 2004/05/29 by olaf@olaf

         If the mpxerr.tex begins with a %&-line, get the name of the
         program to use from it.  The default 'tex' has become a problem
         now that 'latex' requires the 'etex' engine.  Reported by Lars
         Madsen <...>.

Change 4888 on 2004/05/29 by olaf@olaf

        Update the pdf*tex help strings to have the correct format
        extension in them (.fmt).

Change 4887 on 2004/05/29 by olaf@olaf

        Remove the locale-dependent code.  This includes the windows-specific
        OEM option.

Change 4886 on 2004/05/29 by olaf@olaf

        Add 'ctie' by Julian Gilbey to the distribution.

Change 4885 on 2004/05/29 by olaf@olaf

        Rename readlink to kpsereadlink.  GNU coreutils has its own
        readlink binary these days, and as with 'access', it appears
        not a good idea for a specialized package like kpathsea to
        include binaries with such generic names.

Change 4884 on 2004/05/29 by olaf@olaf

        Make the (old) variant suffixes for format files alternate suffixes.
        With the switch to using only .fmt, the rationale for having these
        as primaries is gone (and they will be completely removed later).

And look at 4890 as well, as I made a stupid error in the code I
checked in.

AFAIK, packaging mechanism of TeX Live *edits* the updmap.cfg file. I.e.
if you add a package that contains a map file, it is automatically added
(resp. enabled by removing a comment) in updmap.cfg.

Sebastian, Fabirce, Staszek should know it better, so please correct me
if I am wrong.

Only the second version is what the UNIX version supports. I think that
some version of Fabrice' Win32 port have allowed the first version.  I am
unsure if these version also support "my" calling convention.  Fabrice?

... uploaded to p4 depot (change #4897). Just to note:
removed: fontexport, fontimport
new: ctie
kpsereadlink replaced readlink

building binaries makes texmf/web2c/pdftex empty directory. As the idea
of making formats in web2c/$engine/ was abandoned (I agree with Thomas
that completely not needed), I'd suggest to correct
TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//
in texmf.cnf. 
Do we still need PDFTEXCONFIG in texmf.cnf?

Ps. Han The Thanh mentioned that pdftex is 1.20-rc4. On p4 we have still
1.20a-rc3-2.1

I also have agreed with Thomas that "most people" do
not need TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//.
However, ConTeXt people are using e.g.,
$TEXMF/web2c/aleph/cont-en.fmt,
$TEXMF/web2c/omega/cont-en.fmt,
$TEXMF/web2c/pdfetex/cont-en.fmt.
I think Olaf had introduced $engine just to distinguish
formats in that cases.

Best regards
Akira

All intentional and correct.

Hm... That should be fixed...

There are two reasons for the $engine part and one against it:
  - fmtutil does not support it
  - it is more complicated for users who put a format into their
    local tree (either by hand or by some tool/script) and this being
    "shadowed" by a format in an engine directory (which has higher
    precedence; no matter which texmf tree)
  + some people want to use a shared format name for more than one engine

If someone can give good additional arguments, these would be welcome.
For the moment, I tend to prefer the solution without the $engine
part. Maybe, texexec can solve this for context? It could place context's
formats to web2c/$engine and also overwrite the TEXFORMATS variable.

I don't know where pdftex is going to. My last question about the future
of the config file (private mail to Martin) is still unanswered.

Thanh wrote a week :-) ago:
  Please test it if you can; after about a week I will upload my changes
  to texlive p4 if no problems are found.

So, maybe, he'll make the changes in our tree very soon.

FYI, I've checked in new versions of all 1244 tpm files, regenerated
with Fabrice's tpm-factory.pl.  There are still plenty of diagnostics
during installation (I'll append for the record), but it's a start.

I'll work on the problems as I can, unless someone else gets there first :).
