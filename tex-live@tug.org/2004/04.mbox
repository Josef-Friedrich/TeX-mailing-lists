Send me the setup-*.log files found in

You are wrong. Apparently you did not read (or pay attention to)
emails with explanations sent by Olaf Weber. See

Dear Mr Rahtz:
 
I have been installing and using TeXLive on Windows for several years with
hardly a glitch.  Now I have started playing with (Redhat 9) Linux and so
wanted to install TeX there too; surprisingly, the distro lacks it.
 
I followed the instruction on the TeXLive 2003 inst CD and installed it
without any problem.  But subsequently I discovered two things:

*	I can download teTeX (2.0.2-8) RPM file(s) from the Web and install
it conveniently as RPMs are a lot easier to install (so I gather).
*	You can provide an RPM to anyone who wants it.

Therefore, could you 

1.	Instruct me on how to uninstall TeXLive on Linux so that I can
install an RPM (and, no less valuable, as a learning exercise)?
2.	Send me teTeX RPM?  Of course, I do not want to bother you if it is
older than 2.0.2-8.

Many thanks in advance.  Even if you cannot help me, I still wish to thank
you for your excellent work in bringing out TeXLive.
 
Best regards,
 
Sastry Dasigi

sorry, we have no RPM files for anything, including teTeX.

Message-ID: <6.0.1.1.2.20040401231414.01dfad90@server-1>

Hi,

Since we have a script path in tds now, the method for locating a script 
using kpse will change since scripts are no longer other text files; we 
need to keep in mind that such changes will break user scripts that use 
kpse to locate files. So, how about using 'other text files' as a fall back 
for scripts, i.e. when a script can not be found (using -format='script') 
kpsewhich should also try 'other text files' itself

Hans

(who slowly gets crazy about adapting all his scripts and trees)

Message-ID: <68640CAE-85D1-11D8-B507-000A959F31D2@fis.ucm.es>

I am trying to install TeXLive 2004 under Mac OS X 10.3.3 using the
install-tl.sh script. Everything goes well, until texconfig init is  
executed.
It produces the following error:

Error: kpsewhich cannot find config file of pdftex (pdftex.cfg)

As a consequence, no formats are generated. Updmap also
produces similar error messages:

updmap is creating new map files using the following configuration:

I am really confused, since the installation of TeXLive 2003
did not give me any problems. Does anybody have idea what could be
going on?

Message-ID: <200404040138.i341cpm30511@f7.net>

Following suggestions from Thomas Esser and others, I'd like to
circulate a new draft of the TDS document.  It has passed muster with
those on the twg-tds list, and I wanted to be sure other interested
parties had a chance to review it.  It will become tds 1.1 when
consensus is reached.

Here is the list of significant changes (also included in the document).

\item Inputs for \TeX\ extensions included under \path|tex|, instead
      of in their own top-level directories (Section~\ref{sec:Extensions})
\item New top-level directory \path|scripts| (Section~\ref{sec:Scripts}).
\item New subdirectory \path|lig| of \path|fonts|.
\item \path|enc|, \path|lig|, and \path|map| all use
      \replaceable{syntax}\path|/|\replaceable{package} subdirectories
      (Section~\ref{sec:Fonts}).
\item \path|pfm| files specified to go under \path|type1|, and
      \path|inf| files under \path|afm| (Section~\ref{sec:Fonts}).

For the sake of those on slow connections, I won't include the whole
document here.  It's at ftp://tug.org/private/tex/tds-1.093/.

Thanks,

I noticed that texmf-doc is not included in kpsewhich --show-path=ls-R
output, and thus mktexlsr does not update texmf-doc/lsR.

Perhaps texmf-doc does not need an ls-R file, since it isn't searched
for anything, it's just for humans?  Is that true?  Or should it be
added to texmf.cnf somewhere?

Message-ID: <200404041618.i34GIN304483@f7.net>

I checked in the appended change (#4677) to bin/i386-linux/mktexlsr.  I
know that's not the correct source location, but I don't know where that
is.  source.development/TeX/texk/kpathsea/mktexlsr has other changes not
in the bin/*/mktexlsr version yet.  Sigh.

Sebastian, should we try to do a nightly or at least weekly build to
avoid being so out of sync all the time?

Anyway, the change just omits directory lines like this:
./lsR12345.tmp:

as well as the file lines
lsR12345.tmp
which were already omitted.

This makes it so my update-auto cron job does not check in a new version
every day.

Thanks,
k

as I see, TL have just switched to another concept of keeping html files
along other "package" documentation, e.g.
doc/latex/base/html/ etc.
(it somehow breaks previous doc/html/index.html )

The rest looks good. Karl, many thanks for including all important changes

Hi,

Concerning loading cp8bit each time: i often have jobs that do a lot of 
metapost processing in between (sometimes hundreds) and since mp also loads 
the cp8bit this gives me an uncomfortable feeling when i look at the 
terminal: a document of 150 pages with one (cumulative) mp graphic per page 
plus some extra per chapter, times say 3 runs to get all cross refs and two 
pass info done, makes some 600 loads of cp8bit ... so, a -8bit switch with 
a preloaded 8 bit mapping makes sense, if only because it gives those who 
view such a log not an uncomfortable feeling of waste of time and 
old-fashionedness -)

On tex live 2003 the windows bin path has dvipdfmx and its companion 
dvipos; these are not in the other paths. I wonder how that happened since 
i have the impression that these things are the same for all systems. BTW, 
just like pdfetex as default engine replaces its not extended ancesters, 
dvipdfmx/dvipos for some time now can be considered the replacement for 
dvipdfm (the x one has more extensive pdf support as well as can handle the 
fonts uses in asia more comfortable (dvipdfmx is in most aspect compatible 
with pdftex in functionality; i'm currently discussing with the authors in 
getting it \pdfmapfile compatible as well); so

   pdfetex -> pdf
   pdfetex -> dvi -> dvipdfmx -> pdf

We may also consider to put more asian fonts on the tex live collection 
(now we have room for such big ones).

(i'll not bother you with how changing to pdfetex as default engine 
influences macropackages in their way of thinking about not only dvi/pdf 
but also direct versus indirect pdf -)

Subject: [tex-live] texconfig / texmf.cnf incompatibility in TeXLive 2004?
Message-ID: <5B0B03CC-87C2-11D8-B89A-000A959F31D2@fis.ucm.es>

I have recently downloaded the TeXLive 2004 install CD image dated Feb. 
16, 2004
(test-texlive2004-inst-20040216.iso), and installed it on my Mac OS X 
10.3.3 box.
The installation (via the install-tl.sh script) fails at the 
post-install phase (see my previous post).
I think the problem is that texconfig, which has been carried over 
without changes from the
TeXLive 2003 release, is not compatible with the latest texmf.cnf 
shipped with TeXLive 2004. More specifically, texconfig fails with the 
following error:

Error: kpsewhich cannot find config file of pdftex (pdftex.cfg)

The reason why pdftex.cfg is not found is, I think, that texconfig 
contains the following line

pdftex_conf=`kpsewhich -progname=pdftex --format=tex pdftex.cfg`

In the 2003 release, texmf.cnf had the following entry:

TEXINPUTS.pdftex  =  .;$TEXMF/{pdftex,tex}/{plain,generic,}//

so that pdftex.cfg was found (its path is 
$TEXMF/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg)

The new (2004) texmf.cnf, on the other hand, changes this to

TEXINPUTS.pdftex  =  .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//

so that obviously $TEXMF/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg is not found. (The 
new entry

PDFTEXCONFIG = .;$TEXMF/pdftex/{$progname,}//

which would also find pdftex.cfg, is disregarded by the "old" 
texconfig.)

There is a similar problem with map files, namely updmap (run at the 
end of the installation)
fails to find most map files:

Scanning for LW35 support files
updmap: map file `dvips35.map' not found.
updmap: map file `pdftex35.map' not found.
updmap: map file `dvipdfm35.map' not found.
updmap: map file `ps2pk35.map' not found.

Scanning for MixedMap entries:
updmap: map file `bsr-interpolated.map' not found.
updmap: map file `bsr.map' not found.
updmap: map file `eurosym.map' not found.
updmap: map file `hoekwater.map' not found.
updmap: map file `tipa.map' not found.
updmap: map file `ttcmex.map' not found.
updmap: map file `xypic.map' not found.
updmap: map file `yhmath.map' not found.

Scanning for Map entries:
updmap: map file `charter.map' not found.
updmap: map file `context.map' not found.
updmap: map file `lm.map' not found.
updmap: map file `marvosym.map' not found.
updmap: map file `pazo.map' not found.
updmap: map file `pxfonts.map' not found.
updmap: map file `qcmr.map' not found.
updmap: map file `tabvar.map' not found.
updmap: map file `txfonts.map' not found.
updmap: map file `uaq.map' not found.
updmap: map file `ugq.map' not found.
updmap: map file `zpeu.map' not found.

I think the problem might be that the map files are located at 
$TEXMFDIST/fonts/map//, but
TEXCONFIG is now defined as $TEXMF/dvips//, instead of the former 
$TEXMF/{dvips,fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,}}//.

I am probably missing something obvious here, and would really 
appreciate if somebody
more knowledgeable than I (i.e, almost anybody :-) would help me figure 
out what's going on.

The "release" that you have there is inconsistent/buggy. Maybe, you can
get a working version from taking the scripts from teTeX-beta (2.96).

Subject: [tex-live] web2c-win32 volunteer?
Message-ID: <200404101547.i3AFlYo23356@f7.net>

Bad news everyone -- Fabrice has decided not to continue maintaining
web2c-win32 (he'll keep on with his xemtex distribution with pdf and
html output only .. which, for now, unfortunately, won't keep the
general populace happy).  I know we all appreciate his heroic efforts to
date in making the distribution work under Windows.  Thank you, Fabrice.

Looking to this year's TeX Live release ... I guess the first question
is whether someone (or some group) can volunteer to take over
maintenance of web2c-win32.  If no one can step forward here, I can ask
on texhax/c.t.t.

However, since I asked for volunteers previously merely to *help*
Fabrice, and got no takers, I confess I don't feel too optimistic.  I'd
love to be proved wrong, though. :)

If no one volunteers to take over, the only alternative I can think of
is to talk with Christian Schenk about distributing miktex.  One
possibility is that TeX Collection 2004 could be one CD with Unix/Mac,
one CD with miktex, and one DVD with both plus CTAN. 

In any case, obviously miktex would not be integrated at all into the
existing unix/mac stuff as web2c-win32 is.  We would just take it as is,
with its own installation and packaging.  Perhaps in a future year the
same texmf tree could be shared, but I can't picture that happening this time.

If anyone has any other ideas, don't be shy :).

Thanks,
karl

    There is also teTeX on cygwin.

I think it would fine to provide this, if there is space on the media
(and if it's being maintained), but I don't think it solves the general
problem.  I am sure that the vast majority of Windows users need a
native distribution.

    With the exception of ConTeXt 

www.miktex.org claims that context is included:
  MiKTeX offers a complete set of utilities, macro packages and fonts,
  e.g., LaTeX, pdfTeX, ConTeXt, just to name a few.


I am still hoping for volunteer(s) to take over Fabrice's extensive work ...

Thanks,

There is also MinGW, which creates native Win32 programs.

Than used to provide MinGW executables, and I managed last year to
compile pdfetex and other pieces of teTeX 2.02 under MinGW; you can
still find the stuff at http://tex.aanhet.net/mingtex/. I will
probably try at some time to update those patches to the current
teTeX beta. But this is not an offer to take over fpTeX.

I second this.  Windows really is a hostile environment for a TeX
based on a unix distro.

There is also teTeX on cygwin.  4AllTeX (the preferred distro of our
Win32 users for years) lagged in support for pdftex and MikTeX had
conflicts (.dll versions) with some of our other apps.  Cygwin and
teTeX was the only way to accomplish certain tasks on Win32.

Xemtex is clearly differentiated from MikTeX.  With the exception of
ConTeXt and users who move between teTeX on *n*x and Win32, MikTeX
serves well.  I don't know if there are still people encountering
conflicts between MikTeX and other applications -- many of those apps
have either been replaced or now live on dedicated Win9x machines.

My guess is that it would not be too hard to provide Cygwin teTeX
together with *n*x and OSX, but it has been over a year since I used
Cygwin teTeX, so I don't know if there is a current port.

Providing executables is not the most difficult part even if it tends to become
a repetitive and boring task to patch sources and recompile.

What's more annoying for me is that it is difficult to turn this
stuff into a more real Windows application. There is no point to
distribute 300 or 400 executables: their vast majority is probably never
used. On the other hand, I would like to see people getting a (La)TeX
distribution and start to produce documents painlessly.

Recompiling the binaries using either MSVC or MinGW is not the
issue. The issue is : what to do with this stuff and how to present it
to users.

I built an MSI installer for the whole texlive. I may still provide the
whole texlive/win32 installable from the internet thanks to this
installer. But that won't fit with the 'regular' texlive distribution.

The only problem I can name with dll under windows is that you can
compile your own zlib.dll with different calling convention than the
default one. That can make another application looking for zlib.dll
crash. But MiKTeX and fpTeX are now providing those dll with their own
name (tl80zlib.dll for me) to minimize the problems.

IIRC there is an fptex mailing list.  Has this question been asked
there?

As a general rule, I think it would be good (but somewhat longer term,
I fear) to look for ways we can simplify the work of various
maintainers.

but cygwin tetex is not really that suited for more demanding apps as well 
as intergration in non cygwin editors and alike,

if we look at what is neeed for windows, we're talking about

- a bunch of binaries
- an installer

generating and maintining the binaries is -as you said- crippled by the 
hostile starting point, while the installer is crippled by complex 
dependecies and inconsistencies; simply changing to a 'simulated unix on 
windows' will not solve that problem; we have to accept that 
unix/windows/mac have their own specific demands, pro's and con's and that 
a 'generic' distrubition should address their problematic areas with equal 
priorities.

IMHO, there is an important question: how many users of TeXlive use this
distro in MS Windows? Is there some result from an enquiry?
Percentage approximation?

In 1998, in the netherlands, the ntg members reported as follows:

\plaatstabel{Besturingssystemen (n=106).}
\starttabel[|l|c|lf{\FunnyBar}|]
\HL
\NC systeem \NC \%   \NC \JustLeft{aantal} \NC\SR

\stoptabel

so, some users use more than one platform.

Now, say that os/2 users switched to 2000/xp, and dos users as well, we're 
dealing with a substantial amount of windows users. Postings on the context 
list suggest a similar trend, although the number of max users has grown 
with the advance of os-x (i know of some who moved from linux to mac-osx).

This means that the loss of fptex (in whatever form) is quite dramatic!

For a development environment, yes, but I'm told that for runtime all you
need is one .dll.  Of course, teTeX uses quite a few utilities (perl, awk,
etc.).

The problem we face is diminishing returns for maintaining less widely
used tools on Win32.  You want a way to focus efforts to provide native
Win32 tools on ones everybody needs, but there aren't the resources to
handle all the tools that are available on the other platforms.

The big stumbling block has been getting the perl scripts working.  FpTeX
gets a head start because it includes a perl runtime, but there were
problems getting the right kind of slashes in the path to kpathsea for
Win9x and with directory names that contain spaces.

Cygwin tetex has been useful for tasks that could not be accomplished
using the available Windows disto.  Recently my first inclination when a
Windows TeX falls down is to give the user a unix account and make them
figure out emacs.

In the long run, people will find ways to work with XemTeX, e.g., future
tex4ht will work without dvips and pstricks will be replaced by pgf.  If
not, at least they will know xemacs and shouldn't have much trouble
figuring out teTeX on linux.

i use rsync, unison, and ssh from cygwin and always have to fight the 
demands for dll's when i update one of them; it's very hard to update a 
piece of cygwin, so updating just tex would become painful (somehow the 
system seems to know when more than one dll of the same kind is present 
somewhere, even when a proper one is in the path of the binary)

indeed, so if we could stick to the tools really used it would already save 
a lot of troubles

indeed; i now have some solutions for that but didn't test them yet on 
win95 (i need to know what the cmd shell is capable of, so i have to 
reinstall a few old machines)

ok, so that's for those who are forced to use windows but like to use unix; 
we should keep in mind that the average user is not that fond of emacs or 
vi but prefers editors like winedt or scite

indeed

(from your mails i guess that you're one of the few who knows the problems 
of all platforms that tex runs on -)

The only thing that can break compilation is usage of omega.sty (the 
omega package for latex/lambda), since it makes use of the 
\nextfakemath primitive which is defined in Omega 1.23 but not in 
Omega 1.15 or Aleph.

so, why not add that primitive and equal it to \relax?

So omega.sty is broken (what license does it have, anyway? the
file has none) and must be fixed. Is that realistic?

given that omega is a moving target, i'd expect something

\ifx\nextfakemath\undefined
    \message{Sorry, I don't know how to fake math}
    \let\nextfakemath\relax
\fi

(or otherwise some version test like \ifnum\omegaversion>115 \fi )

in such a style; something like that is happening for pdftex for years now, 
since that is a moving target as well.

I don't have a number, but the basic answer is "zillions".  Definitely
at least a significant minority, probably a plurality.  Most of the
questions we receive from TUG members are about TL installation/usage
under Windows.

At the web2c end, my sense is that for unix installations many of the
binaries aren't much used either.  They're there because they're a
traditional part of the whole suite of tools.  I don't see having them
be there as much of a problem.

Another issue is what it means to "turn this stuff into a more real
Windows application".  I'm note sure what the expections are, and
whether the changes it implies would be useful on other platforms as
well, without unduly restricting the range of platforms we can
support.

Because it can be done at the input file level (\let\nextfakemath
\relax) :) I'd rather implement it, but I was wondering if it was 
really the case. After all, I have the strong impression that the 
result can be robustly achieved by macros, even though I haven't 
actually tried.

Fixed in the sense that \nextfakemath can be removed, yes. I have no 
idea about the licence. Anyway, omega.sty is a real mess and I don't 
like it at all. I would rather prefer the Babel system to become 
Omega/Aleph aware than add one extra multilingual layer to LaTeX.

Right now pdftex uses .fmt for its formats (e.g., latex.fmt) just as
tex does.  Similar for pdfetex and etex, which both use .efmt.  I
don't believe this is a desirable situation, and would like to change
this, possible so that

      tex      -> .fmt
      etex     -> .efmt
      pdftex   -> .pfmt
      pdfetex  -> .pefmt
      pdfxtex  -> .xfmt (could be made .pxfmt for "consistency")
      omega    -> .oft (could be made .ofmt)
      eomega   -> .eoft (could be .eofmt, but who cares)
      aleph    -> .afmt

I know that if you reduce the extension to three letters, you get
overlaps with .pfm, .ofm, .afm.  The one place this actually matters
is kpsewhich, where I've resolved this by ensuring that the mapping of
file extension to kpse_file_format_t looks at kpse_format_t last.

Thoughts?

An example of the mess is the web2c directory itself, at least on my
side: I have set it up to compile all the regular stuff + omega-1.15 and
omega-1.23 and both eomega-1.15 and eomega-1.23 and now aleph, then
pdfxtex (?) etc.

Morevover I can't use the same trick as you can in Unix: compiling
outside of the source tree. Anyway that wouldn't work because I have
more stuff than stored in the regular source tree.

No shell scripts. Turn every program into a dll  with a defined API, add
a command line interface only when needed.

Well, my working tree looks like that too, except that I've got only
one version of omega and one version of eomega compiling.

The targets I use to build a distibution tarball work only if I'm in
the source tree, and have built in the source tree.  So I work in the
source tree, and test outside-source-tree builds occasionally.  This
is one of the reasons why there are targets like vftovp-clean in the
makefiles, so I can easily target a specific binary for rebuilding.

After compilation, there are some 450 entries in my texk/web2c
directory, but I don't find that particularly difficult to deal with.
So I guess I'm not sure what the problem is with the texk/web2c
directory, unless it is related to a directory with 450+ entries being
hard to manage with graphical tools.

You can do something like that on unix, but of course it works only on
platforms that support shared libraries (which I think the patforms we
actively support do by now).  But there is a catch, in that the
details of shared library support vary considerably between systems
(apparently not all of them allow you to hide library-internal
symbols, for example).

As I remember that was consent about replacing eomega with aleph,
so now compiling for linux we have:
aleph, omega (1.23), no more ini* and vir* (except classic mf, mpost and 
tex), etex etc. linked to pdfetex.
As we're talking about TL stuff, I hope that pdfxtex can wait
for better time...

sounds ok to me, i'd opt for the longer ones (pxfmt and so)

if i remember right nts already had nfmt to avoid format name clashes

(another option is

   web2c/tex/....fmt
   web2c/etex/...fmt
   web2c/pdfetex/...fmt

)

What's the purpose? Ensure that some tex engine won't be called with a
format not created by the same engine? In this case it is not
bulletproof to store the information only in the format file name. Why
not adding a fingerprint inside the format file itself?

Mainly to help prevent accidents (like 'tex \&latex sample2e' when the
latex format is built for the pdfetex engine).  It also allows for a
degree of peaceful coexistence between formats with the same names for
different engines.

Another way to enable peaceful coexistence that has been proposed is
to separate the formats in subdirectories like this:
	texmf/web2c/tex
	texmf/web2c/etex
Each of these directories would be conform to an engine.  For that to
work best, we could have the engines define $engine like they define
$progname these days, and have something like
	TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//
in the texmf.cnf.

Putting a fingerprint in the format file itself is not mutually
exclusive with this.

The typical TeX user I encounter uses a TeX on *n*x in the lab and a
Win32 version (e.g., on their laptop) elsewhere, so the percentages are:

*n*x:  100%  (actually, many are still using teTeX until they need
              something from TL)
Win32: 100%

This likely reflects the experience level of the users and/or the
robustness of the distro in that environment.

Sure, that would work. I somehow like the other solution more (using
different extensions). My feeling is that this is easier/less tricky.

Example of how the "fingerprint" would work in case of a mismatch:

Ah, yet another directory structure :( 
Anyway it'd need changes in texmf.cnf and mainly in fmtutil (it should
made directory if needed). I don't mention changes in many documentations
(kpathsea file types, etc. etc.).
I'd prefer just different extensions...

One thing to note is that changes like these should be reflected in
the omega and aleph sources as well -- there have been times where
omega builds would have broken.  But Omega and Aleph don't use tex.ch
directly, instead typically (but not always) it is com16bit.ch that
has to be changed.  Question remains who is responsible for keeping
these bits within reasonable distance of whatever I do to tex.ch.
(I've done it in past, but somewhat haphazardly; is there anyone who
ever bothers to double-check this stuff?)

Just curious: isn't this sorted out by the kpse library? There is no 
fundamental difference between loading cmr10.tfm and whatever.fmt from the 
perspective of tex, is there, since the combination engine+settings 
determine the search?

it probably fits in the concept of sub dirs (as with fonts); actually, it 
was the only solution so far to get formats with the same names for 
different engines in the tree; context does not use this somehow strange 
pdfcont-en.fmt mlcont-en.fmt econt-en.fmt scheme but just cont-en.suffix; 
so, it's about the right time to clean up this piece of the tree

those are minor compared to those for font related manuals since there are 
more users who install fonts than users who implement new tex engines -)

btw, changes in utilities/manuals never was a reason was it (else no 
changes would have taken place at all)

>I'd prefer just different extensions...

I suppose that both could work given the right pattern in the cnf file? The 
suffix solution is ok if we force new engines to use a new suffix.

Hi,

Talking about fingerprints, something similar is needed for the font system 
as well; when one generates a font.tfm+font.vf and afterwards decides to 
use a non virtual one (i.e. regenerates a new font.tfm), the vf is still 
used since it has the same name but no longer has to be used (if one is not 
aware of that file being there ...); if such a vf would have a fingerprint 
for each referenced file (say a checksum or so), then that could be used to 
determine inconsistencies.

Ah .. so much clean up needed (like the hyphenation mess)

There is this XeTeX system (which is in beta and integrates all sorts 
of font stuff with TeX) which already uses .xfmt as an extension.
And of course there is the precedent of E-TeX and .efmt versus TeX and 
.fmt

I agree from a point of elegance. The subject addressed is binding 
format and engine. The path solution is in fact binding engine and 
path. That is a workaround more than a real binding.

But it is not a great deal either way of course.

Sorry of my off topic, but I need to respond :-)

> Win32: 100%

Strictly speaking (from mathematical point of view) You are not right:
There exist at least one user of TeXlive who _never_ used Win: me.
This implies that 100% is wrong.

More seriously:
We have results of simple opinion poll between Czech and Slovak TeX users
collected by Ladislav Bitto -- http://www.cstug.cz/novinky/anketa.pdf.
(You can skip the first page in Slovak language: the pages 2--4 are
readable without understanding Slovak: each line includes answers of one
respondend, no summary is present). Of course, the respondents are not
representative sample: They are probably internet-active people. I can
give a short summary:

Number of respondents: 55
Date:                  September 2003

Win users:             22
Linux users:           44
Other UNIXes:           5
OS/2:                   5
Dos:                    4
Mac:                    0

emTeX                                :  8

Do you get an innocuous warning "checksum mismatch in font xyz.vf
ignored"? Or "design size mismatch in font xyz.vf ignored"?

Both .tfm and .vf files normally contain the same matching checksum,
which is checked when the .vf-file is loaded. Now if they don't match,
there will be this pdftex warning, but the .vf file will be read in.
Same for a design size mismatch. So if you sometimes get such a warning
message, tuning pdftex.ch to a (silent) .vf read fail might help a
little.

But it doesn't help if you just regenerate the .tfm-file unchanged,
since then the checksum would be the same...

Message-ID: <87isfz8upc.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

It seems some changes that I could have _sworn_ I'd committed are
somehow not in the p4 repository.  In particular change set 4615
doesn't seem to be actually there, judging by what the files look like
after a 'sync -f'.  Perhaps I've done something wrong (always a
possibility) but this has me worried.

This was my log entry:

        Merge of encTeX.  Add options to help texts.  Allow a third
        number, 0 or 1, in tcx files, which specifies printability.
        (But enforce printability of 7bit ASCII.)

It's not a big disaster (it's not my primary copy that's affected) but
it does mean the changes I'm about to check in are larger than I
wanted them to be.

Change 4700, for those trying to keep track.  Note that this change
affects pdftex and pdfetex, and probably breaks pdfxtex builds.  Note
that similar changes ought to be merged into omega and aleph.
