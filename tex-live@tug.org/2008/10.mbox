there's e.g. RAR for unix which can create SFX archive (i.e. a linux
executable which, when run, will extract the contents).

unrar on linux understands SFX archives created on windows, and vice
versa.

but lzma probably doesn't have SFX (though i don't know about this).

this is probably because you were compressing using 7z, but not using
lzma, and it happened that 7z compressed the ISO image slightly better
than lzma. it is not related to usage of SFX (which always makes the
archive slightly bigger than without SFX, using the same compression
level).

Subject: [tex-live] minor build/install problems with 20080816
Message-ID: <m3k5ctuozi.fsf@multivac.cwru.edu>

I ran into a couple of problems building texlive-20080816.  The first
problem was a link command that didn't use $LDFLAGS.  That caused an
error in my case, since some dependency libraries can only be found
via the -L flags I put in $LDFLAGS.  The second problem was that
<prefix>/share/man/man5 didn't exist initially, and the Makefiles
don't create it before trying to install man pages there.  The
definition of MKDIR_P should probably come from configure, but I'm not
familiar enough with autoconf to do that myself.

Well, the documentation for 7-Zip said LZMA was the
default, but I am very happy to try again and this
time force LZMA compression.  I do think this is
worth pursuing, given the fairly obvious resistance
to non-ZIP compression in the Windows world ...

SFX facility for ZIP files comes from an old PKZIP. Although it was
not OpenSource, the description of the ZIP format was available. Thus
WinZip knows where the important headers are and can skip the SFX
code. I am not sure whether other implementations, e.g. InfoZip, can
cope with SFX files. The same holds for SFX's created by 7-zip. I do
not know whether their format is documented so that other programs
could skip the SFX code. It could be tested on a small sample file.

I can definitely confirm that LZMA  compression
has been used, and that 7-Zip can see inside the file,
bypassing its self-extracting facilities.  Here is
the output from 7-Zip "list" command with full
technical details :

What we therefore need is for one or more Unix users to
test-unpack the same file using 7-Zip under Unix.

OK, but would one need "other programs" ?  As 7-Zip is
open source, and has already been ported to Unix/Linux [1],
could it not be distributed as the general unpacker for
the (putative) texliveyyyy.lzma.exe ?

Well, I'm not sure there's such a resistance. On the contrary, I often
get .rar archives from window people. I was also under the impression
that most windows people use some kind of universal un*ziper like 7-zip.

Also, since the prefered installation method is from the network, don't
you think that the people downloading the iso are probably more expert
users, eg wanting to install on a series of machines?

Anyway:
1. I think it would be more useful to make the network installer more
windows-friendly (eg, an executalbe people can click, no need to unzip
then find install-tl.bat and click it) that working on the iso.
2. But I can test, merely out of curiousity, a small example of SFX file
to see if my linux version of unlzma can understand it.

I managed to compile 7za on CentOS 5 on x86_64. I have not tested it
yet, I have only tried that the help screen appears. the problem is
that it does not use the standard GNU infrastructure: configure - make
- make install, thus incorporation of 7z will not be that
straightforward.

Well, I'm basing my analysis partially on my own
feelings as a Windows user, but also on the recent
messages from Walter Saegesser and Eduardo Kalinowski.
They may not be "typical" Windows users but they have
very polar views, and my feeling is that we can accommodate
such people very easily without sacrificing any of the
benefits that led to the adoption of LZMA compression
in the first place.

I don't know what the typical installation time is
for a full network install, but my experiments here
with a 3Mb download speed have suggested that it is
not feasible for use during (say) a half-day visit
to a friend or colleague.  For such situations I
would want to take a DVD with me.

I'm reasonably confident that it won't.  Even the
Windows LZMA unmangler supplied as a part of the
TeX Live kit cannot see inside a 7-Zip created
SFX file, but (as I suggested in a previous
message), given the licencing and availability of
7-Zip, is it not a candidate for distribution as
the general unpacker ? [Zdenek's later comments
already noted].

Off-line, Wolfgang Fleisher has suggested that
a better approach is to mirror the TLNET branch
of CTAN (circa 1Gb) and copy that to DVD, then
use the network installer to install from DVD
rather than from network, after which one uses
"option location" to allow future updates to
come from the network.  This seems a very promising
approach, and one that I will try for my next
away-of-home installation.  If this is viable,
what are the extra features on the 2.5Gb
texlive2008-20080822.iso DVD that will be missing
from the 1Gb TLNET image ?

If you are willing to bypack a unpacker with the distribuation where is
the need for a self extracting archive?

You should also ask some windows user if they trust self extraction
archives. I at least don't like them. I prefer to look into an archive
and have an idea about the files involved and the pathes they use before
I extract the files.

On broadband (in our institute) on a linux computer with two quad core
processors: 9 minutes
At home over 2Mb ADSL on a linux computer with one dual core
processor: about 2 hours (I have just left it running during dinner so
I do not know exactly).

It is not a "need"; it is a suggestion.  As has been
frequently pointed out, Windows users like life to be
made simple; for them, a self-unpacking installer is
ideal (hence the success of commercial offerings such
as InstallShield in the Windows world).

I am not proposing to /remove/ the ability
to look inside before unpacking; rather,
I am proposing to remove the /need to/ look
inside, if one is willing to trust the distributor.

Well, changing this is no little change, and for little (imho) benefit.
Idoubt we want to do it. (As mentionned by many inc myself, the iso is
not that important.)

Yep. When I install on many machines, that's what I do : dowload the
archive subdir, unpack install-tl.zip, and put archive in this
directory. That way, you don't even need to give any option to the
installer, it does find the packages automatically. Never did a
comparative test DVD vs USB stick, but I suppose the USB stick is faster.

Excellent, can think of no possible use for that,
so will go the "download TLNET" route. [1]

Sure. But a lot of windows users don't know that they can look inside an
.exe-archive without executing it and even if they know they will
probably not know how to do it with an .exe that build on lzma. But they
know that an .exe file can be dangerous: If you sent or receive an
self-extracting file per e-mail it is often rejected. So if you really
care for *all* windows user -- not only the ones who click on every .exe
--, you will have to add an unpacker which allows them to look in the
.exe and tell them how to use it. And in this case you don't gain much
compared to the case where you add the unpacker and tell the user how to
use it to open and unpack the lzma.

self.head.wall.against.beat () :-)))

I give up : the idea would certainly do much
to pacify Messrs Saegesser, Kalinowski, et al.,
but there is sufficient resistance (or inertia)
that I do not consider it profitable to pursue
it any further (even though 7-Zip has clearly
done a better job of compressing the ISO than
the tools used to prepare the .ISO.LZMA file).

I don't want to start again a troll, but just for the record, Unix users
too. They just don't always agree about which kind of simplicity matters
most :-)

I agree on this point, but as I already said, I thinks it is relevant
only for the networks installer. The iso way won't be a
"point-and-click" way to install anyway, since you'll always need to
mount or burn the image after uncompressing it.

So, I'll stop here this discussion about self-extraction as far as the
ISO image is concerned, since it's a minor point IMO and we already
spend enough time discussing it without immediate solution.

OTOH, if you have serious hints about how to make a point-and-click
network install (just skipping the step "unzipping install-tl.zip and
findind install-tl.bat inside" and going straight to "running
install-tl.bat", I'd be interested to hear about it. (I agree with you
that there are little (from a power user's point of view) points that
can greatly change the ease of use for an average user and that we
should try to improve there.)

I am not a Windows expert but  know that there are some free tools for
making Windows installers. It would thus be possible to make setup.exe
that will put to the local HD the contents of install-tl.zip and start
install-tl.bat. Making such a setup.exe should not be difficult if you
find the right tool.

Subject: [tex-live] Install from TLNET mirror on DVD failed
Message-ID: <48E37DF6.4060009@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear Colleagues -- Pursuing Wolfgang Fleischer's
proposal (and Manuel Pegourier-Gonnard's support
for) installing from a mirror of /TLNET/2008,
I used Rsync to update my local copy and burned
a DVD.  I then appended G:\Install-TL to my path
(G: is the DVD drive) and launched it with

	Install-TL --location G:\

where G:\ contains (among other things)

	archive (directory)
	install-tl (directory)

		and

	tlpkg (directory)

All went well until the CMD window displayed the
last of the "z" modules, at which point the installation
hung.  Windows said PERL was the culprit.

Is there any possibility that Install-TL.bat
cannot be launched direct from a read-only device
such as a DVD, or is there any other obvious
reason why the installation may have hung at
this point ?

Lingtrees could be included, there is only one problem, avm.sty we
cannot since it lacks any license statement.

but there is no avm-doc.tex around on CTAN.

So we cannot distribute it without anyone hunting down the author, askin
him to upload a new version with license statement, etc.

No.

If you want to contribute to write a general

by one) please tell us and we will show you what we have ATM.

Hello all,

I don't like the way the \tilde command works in LaTeX. I'd like it to  
be a little lower, especially in the command \tilde{\ell}.

I've tried hacking in the example of the comprehensive symbols list,  
but couldn't get it to work as I wanted (I'm not an expert in TeX).  
Perhaps someone here can help me out?

What I would really want is a command \mytilde with two parameters,  
one of which controls the height of the overtilde. A problem seems to  
be the height of the limits after the new sign, they should be at the  
same height as when the tilde wouldn't have been there.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Tammo Jan.

Do not forget that LZMA has different levels of compression. Taking
this ISO (uncompressed) and compressing with -9 option

% lzma -x -9

(tightest and slowest) resulted in
-rwxr-xr-x   1 ivrii  ivrii  1220277550 Sep  2 10:44 texlive2008.iso.lzma

1,191,677 Kb

(it took looooooong)

As a Founding Member of PETMU (People for Ethical Treatment of
Microsoft Users) I request and demand to make self-extracting archive.
During the extraction the movies showing the superiority of MSW over
TeX should be shown. If extraction time is not sufficient to show all
the movies, the extraction must be slowed down:-)

Hi Phil,
installing from the DVD is quite time consuming because about 75,000
small files have to be copied.

If you have downloaded the DVD image already, you could also consider
this:

  1. Copy the content of the DVD to a writable directory.

  2. Go to the root of this directory and run

	   tlpkg/bin/tlpdb2container --all

     This will create all the .tar.lzma packages in a directory called
     archive.  This is what usually had been on TL CDs.

  3. Either copy the whole stuff to a DVD.  This DVD will then contain
     the live system and the install files.  The installer prefers the
     compressed files if they are present because it's much faster to
     install them.  You can also copy the stuff to a USB stick (>= 4 GB).

     Or, if you have a 2 GB USB stick, remove the texmf trees.  Then
     you have an "install CD" on the stick, but no live system.

I remember from TL-2007 that installing from a DVD took 50...60
minutes, installing from a CD took abt. 20...30 minutes.  It certainly
depends a bit on the hardware.

Regarding the lzma discussion, I'm a bit wondering whether it's safe
to use 7zip.  Since the file format is not settled yet, it's best to
extract the image with the same program that created it.

If this is too inconvenient, doesn't it make more sense to provide a
batch file rather than ask people to use external software?

And is there any need to download the ISO image more than once a
year?  Hopefully not.

IMO it's sufficient if the very few steps which are necessary in order
to download and decompress the ISO image are explained somewhere.  Of
course, it's more convenient if there is a batch file.  Could you
provide one?  It's better than a self extracting archive.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the patches.

    problem was a link command that didn't use $LDFLAGS.  

I wonder if the original freetype is still being maintained (to push the
change upstream).  Werner?

    Is this expected?  Should I be doing something other than "make check"
    for testing?

I'm afraid make check doesn't do anything useful.  That is, although I
long ago wrote a few commands for the check target, since they depends
on having the formats built, and the formats can't be easily built out
of the dev hier these days ... building the formats is a much better
test than the actual make check commands, anyway :).

All I can suggest is to take your binary directory and put it into an
installed hierarchy, and see if it works.  I wrote a few small tips at
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html#deploy.

Thanks,
Karl

Environment variables can be set by scripts or from the
registry.   You could use regedit to make sure it is not coming
from the registry (e.g., if you find a setting, change the name
to "REG_PERL5LIB" so you can know where it came from).
You can also try using the normal mechanism to force it to
a value that will work for TL2008.

Good suggestion, George : thank you.  In
fact, Perl5Lib turns up in the registry
at

	HKLM\System\ControlSet003\Control\SessionManager\Evironment

(see below).

I shall delete the key and see if it finally
disappears.  Many thanks for your help.

Maybe it is set via the cmd shortcut?

This is a known problem with XeTeX under Windows. We have to wait
for upstream to provide a fix, but if they can't reproduce the
problem then we may be in for a long wait.

Windows keeps several copies of -HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet
around, with names such as HKLM\System\ControlSet00[1|2|3]

I would be somewhat surprised if the value in the non-current
controlset turned out to have an effect. But I guess it is worth a
try removing PERL5LIB from all three.

Not really.  Peter Breitenlohner wanted to port ttf2pk/ttf2tfm to
FreeType?2 -- those are the last applications (of some importance)
which use FreeType?1.  I simply don't have time to do that by myself.

After about 72 hours of continuous tries, I finally
succeeded in performing a minimal TeX install on
this system (from Cambridge); I then tried to replicate
this from a local DVD, and it hung at Infra.Win32.
I then deleted the target directory and noted the
files that would not delete automatically : these
were :

	Moreverb.inst
	Xfrac.dtx
	READ.ME
	Vertex.doc
	README

(Sorry, can't say in which directories).

Despite emptying F:/TeX/Live/2008, the attempt
to install from DVD is still hanging at
Infra.Win32.  More experiments needed, but comments
on the read-only files would be appreciated.

It also hangs at the same point

this is the second system on which

at Infra.Win32, could the team cast
any light on what unusual operations
take place as this module is loaded ?

Nothing. Un-lzma, un-tar, as with all the other packages.

I have no idea what is rotten on the systems you are installing to. I
have not heard anything related to that till now.

When it hangs, can you make a copy of 
	.../2008/temp/texlive.infra*
(i.e., of all files there starting with texlive.infra) and put them up
somewhere, maybe they are corrupted.

Other than that, without any ways to debug that, I have no idea.

The \horn accent is indeed unavailable in T5 encoding: It is a virtual

The problem you experience is a bug in file `uni-1.def' from the UCS
bundle.  Below is a patch.

    Peter Breitenlohner wanted to port ttf2pk/ttf2tfm to
    FreeType??2 -- those are the last applications (of some importance)
    which use FreeType??1.

Really.  So if we fixed ttf2*, we could delete freetype[1] from TL?  That
would be most excellent.

Peter, can you swing back into action one of these days?

Message-ID: <200810022110.m92LA8X06898@f7.net>

Hello everyone,

For those willing to be guinea pigs, we've put together a simpler way to
update tlmgr and the related critical packages from the development
sources, to avoid having to get everything from svn itself.

There's a new location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical which contains
the critical packages (bin-texlive and texlive.infra), updated nightly
from svn.  The basic test would be:
  tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --list

To actually do the update, use --all instead of --list, as usual.

I intentionally made this available only by ftp; if ftp doesn't work for
you, you probably shouldn't be a guinea pig :).

It is not mirrored anywhere because (1) it is small, (2) I expect
relatively few people to use it, and (3) the whole point is to test
what's currently in the sources; mirroring delays would defeat that.

To sum up:
- if you are willing to accept breakage and other normal testing pain,
  please try to update tlmgr as above.
- if you're not, please ignore this message.

And of course, what we're most interested in is whether the new tlmgr
actually works for people in all your multitude of environments.  We
want to push it out to everyone asap.

Thanks,
Karl

Yes, so it is. I will change that message from warning to debug, so it
will not be issued under normal circumstances.

Thanks for noting that!

And this file :

UPDATER has been created, please execute tlpkg\installer\updater.bat

has not been created.  (I.e., there is no sub-directory "tlpkg"
of C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>).

Well, the message may be confusing. The file is

c:\path\ot\texlive\tlpkg\installer\updater.bat

and usually, a shortcut to this file is created on your desktop for your
convenience.

(Of course all this is windows-specific, on other systems you can

That is normal.  (Sorry, I forgot to mention that.)  But after the
update, the next tlmgr update should not display all those messages for
the non-critical packages.  That is one of the changes we made since the
initial release.

I'm not sure about this, but TL seems to have combined two different
packages and treats them as one.

On CTAN:
http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=logic
http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=gene-logic
-> the packages have different authors, licensing info and seem to
serve different purposes. One appears to be a font for use in
electronic diagrams with logic gates etc. The other appears to be a
package to ease the typesetting of formulae in formal logic.

In TL:
texlive.tlpdb lists files from both packages as belonging to the
package logic with its (lack of) licensing information etc.:

i.e., mathematical logic -- that which the electronic stuff (that
computers are made of) was named after.

> In TL:

whereas miktex puts the macro package into a bundle called gn-logic.

this stuff all dates back into history of before my time as a ctanner.
the logic font is called milstd (presumably there is or was some
military force somewhere that has a standard for logic design).  to add
to the confusion there's a latex 2.09 document style called milstd
(which contains no actual useful comments anywhere, that i've noticed,
so i don't know why it's so called).

with a clear brain and indefinite spare time i might manage to sort this
stuff out.  but given the circumstances ...

thanks for the contribution.

I think so.  The only other application of some importance which comes
to my mind is ttftot42, but this is not provided as a binary in
TeXLive.

BTW, TeXLive contains version 0.2 of ttftot42, but the latest version
available is 0.3.1:

Does it mean that it is TL admissible? I am completely confused with

OK, but suppose that the master repository were to lose
some or all of the packages that are not in Scheme: minimal;
would the new TLMGR then tacitly overlook that, and not
inform the user ?

SuSE 11.0 x86_64
TEXDIR=/usr/local/texlive/2008//

running tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --all

forces update of bin-texlive and dependent texlive.infra

_Basic test successfull!_

But I'm missing actually output of texdoc tlmgr.

BROATS
A pair of trousers with a career behind them. Broats are most commonly
seen on elderly retired army officers. Originally the brats were part
of their best suit back in the thirties; then in the fifties they were
demounted and used for gardening. Recently pensions not being what
they were, the broats have been called out of retirement and
reinstated as part of the best suit again.

That is strange, it seems when making the backup tar it uses the new
list of files instead of the old. I have to check that.

That is strange, I checked tlmgr, that happens when the backpu .tar is
made, but it is made form the OLD tlpdb, so if the file is missing, it
was missin gin the first place.

Did any one of you remove things with rm or similar?

That is strange, because it has been included since long time.

Do you have "docfiles" installation disabled?

But still, if the file is listed in your tlpdb, it should be there???

Any tinkering done on your side?

> !!!Error: non-existent tlpkg/doc/repository-setup.txt

That OTOH again points to a problem with the tar invocation, because
repository-setup.txt was only added recently, so it could not be in your
package till now.

Bummer, why???

I will investigate ... only problem I am on a train without power
source, those English trains are sooooooooo bad, on the continent most
trains nowadays have one power outlet for 1-2 places. Argggg.

If you like. I would tend to say "formal" or "symbolic" logic rather

The CTAN stuff seems correct, though, right? That distinguishes the two

OK, it now becomes clear that what is
"unique" about Infra.Win32 is that it
is the last module loaded before TLMGR
starts doing different things if one is
loading Scheme : minimal.  The corresponding
file for Scheme : full commences with "Z".
As reported yesterday, the problem originates
(at least in part) from recycling a CMD window
used previously for a TeX Live installation.
It would be beneficial to forewarn users against
trying such a thing, and advise them instead
to either launch Install-TL.bat directly from
Explorer or via a self-created shortcut.

It's a good idea. Every step towards the 'simple computer user' will
raise the chance that TeX ist used. Your work and the work of Christian
Schenk have caused that much more pupils than in the past could be
convinced to use TeX.

We have to accept that todays user does not know anything about his
computer ;-)

Hi,
does the error message mean that the the symlink is missing, or the
link target?   If the latter is meant, it seems to be correct:

hmm.  i see no reference to modification or distribution.

the examples are all taken from the clrs book, which is a standard
textbook.  should the author not have used them?  if not, how should he
have documented his macros?

istm that either you use copyright material for your examples, or you
generate trivial snippets of algorithm, which don't really give the
"feel" you need for the package.  (pretty much every published algorithm
appears either in a journal with strict republication copyright terms,
or in a book like clrs.)

there is no licence information on ctan (i though clea had found
something, but i can see no sign of those things).  i don't think it's
reasonable for me to document what happens when you put things in tex
live.

The notice is in newalg.sty. If that file is not on CTAN, neither is
the notice. It is in TeX Live, though.

texlive.infra: revision in http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
is less then local revision, not updating!


My observations show that
1) newalg was really removed (change of tlmgr behavior)
2)  pax.universal-darwin: link was broken (it was to script
pdfannotextractor.texlua) now it is fixed to pdfannotextractor.pl
3) gene-logic which belongs if I understand correct to
collection-science had  not been installed and %tlmgr install
gene-logic was required (change of tlmgr behavior):


After update --all

tlmgr show gene-logic
Package:   gene-logic
Category:  Package
ShortDesc: Typeset logic formulae, etc.
LongDesc:  The package provides a facility to typeset certain logic
formulae. It provides an environment like eqnarray, an extended
newtheorem environment, and several macros.
Installed: No
Collection:collection-science

Only after %tlmg install gene-logic Installed: No changed to Yes (I
checked also looking at files)

So we see two big changes: actual removal and  not installing new
packages into installed categories. While I understand logic beyond
removal (keeping copies consistent) it may be a problem for those who
administrate texlive for a large group of people: in my Dept there are
few my esteemed colleagues with a very little knowledge and very big
mouths who will come screaming and yelling if their favorite package
disappears and manual installation to texmf-local in 5 minutes will
not serve as excuse!

Non-installation is even more problematic: it breaks consistency.

Victor

PS Having few computers to administrate I can verify my observations easily
PPS Agreeing (probably foolishly) to administrate TL and thus
associated texmf-local on our Dept server I am not afraid of big
mouths of some of my esteemed colleagues (who will probably use
coexisting tetex not being able to switch the path) but for real
sysadmins situation could by yucky

PPPS Now a bit unrelated: Imagine large Dept with a lot of machines
running TeXLive. Now one needs to install on all these machines some
package which cannot be included to TL. It would be very nice if
1) tlmgr had a sibling which would be able to do similar things but
using texmf-local as an installation and some local Dept server as a
source
2) It would require a public release of the packager for the packages.

I mean: TL team just drops these pieces of s/w (with instructions but
without responsibility) to the public which would be free to bork
their texmf-local  using a new tool

The problem was that pdfannotextractor was a symlink to non-existent
pdfannotextractor.texlua

The "old" tlmgr neither reported an error nor fixed it
"New" tlmgr reported an error and fixed it

So it is a positive development

tlmgr should check that all the packages in the updated collection-science
are installed.  It would be nice if that can be done automatically whenever
a collection is updated.

Where I work we also have "private" packages that need to end up in
texmf-local.   Some of the issues Victor has encountered can be
avoided by using tlmgr only to maintain a "master" texlive.  Once all
is working and any private packages have been added manually, this
can be rsynced (during off hours) to the version used by others on
shared systems.  There are, however, those with personal
systems who want to manage packages themselves, but still need
texmf-local bits, and some of those bits belong to scientific organizations
with users scattered around the globe, so I'm also hoping for a way to
manage private packages with tlmgr.

tlmgr does not touch texmf-local. I noticed that our ut-thesis (Univ
of Toronto Thesis) class not in TL. I asked to put it in and (thanks
to H.Voss and R.Fairbanks) it is in CTAN more orderly and hopefully it
will come to TL soon. Thus I believe that the best policy would be to
push on TL (provided there are no problems) leaving to private
management only packages which cannot be on TL

Not sure what you mean.  I get:

Using the version of tlmgr from the tlcritical test (e.g., the
latest), update --all
did not install gene-logic, so I'm left with:

$ tlmgr check collections
Packages listed in collections but not present:
	gene-logic (collection-science)

If you made a .tar.lzma package with texm-local/... what will happen?
One issue is whether you want a completely parallel structure, e.g.
a tlmgr-local that keeps a separate database, say
tlpkg/texlive-local.tlpdb

tlmgr already supports subset repositories as with tlcritical, so if
you can live with a single texlive.tlpdb, you just have the problem
that the local packages will not be in the main repositories so will
be flagged as "removed".  You could work around that by using a
local mirror of the repository, merging a local tlpdb with the
master version, and adding your packages.

Yes. But I consider what we test as prerelease while release meant
version not from tlcritical

This was behavior of tlmgr version 10829,

After update to 10842 things may go differently. Hopefully new
packages will come soon to observe

    1) newalg was really removed (change of tlmgr behavior)

It is a desirable and intended change.

    3) gene-logic which belongs if I understand correct to
    collection-science had  not been installed 

If a collection is not installed, tlmgr will not install new packages in
that collection.  I see no rational alternative -- it can't read your
mind about what packages you want.  If you want everything, install
everything.  That is always my recommendation.

If you *did* have collection-science installed, then gene-logic should
have been installed by tlmgr update --all.

Dominique doesn't work on it any more?  I can't recall.

    Wouldn't it make more sense to have the TeXLive version the
    `official' one?

We want the master copy to be on CTAN, so that (for example) MiKTeX can
also benefit from the fix.

Anyway, I guess I will upload the change.

Thanks,
Karl

Some users can make a very big fuss out of it. It would be nice if
before removal package the prompt came: Where you want to put the
removed package (or there was an option --trash= ....)
I understand that the package remains on CTAN but not necessarily in
DTS and with some packages question what goes where is rather tricky.
TL team had resolved this question with package included by an error,
so it the efforts should not be wasted.

I did this: but it was not installed until I installed it explicitly.
However it was tlmgr 10829
Now I have 10842 and comparing via svn I see massive changes. I am
waiting for night update: hope ut-thesis will come and I will be
watching
.
In other message I reported a welcome change: error correction:
pdfannotextractor was incorrectly symlinked to pdfannotextractor.texlua
Observing on 10392 I noticed that there was neither error report and
nor correction later but on 10829 there was an error report (rather
confusing) and error was corrected. Further using 10829 to self-update
from tlcritical I got an error report and correction of the problem
(missing documentation). This is welcome behavior

>

There is another problem with removal, actually with the change of
policy: newthm (and some others) were removed from TL earlier, before
tlcritical test and they continue to sit in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/

(probably there was no docs)

Willing to be guinea pigs (Karl ask for) Victor and I found, after running 
tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --all
just for check tlcritical, that this pdf, and Karl found two others, are no 
more available on local installation.

Our emails are only made to give Karl feedback of our basic test results.

So far I understood, the missing docu in texlive/critical is already fixed.

No, this was different and actually welcomed feature:

Sometimes repackaging goes wrong: in this case no docs came with
bin-texlive, with pax at some moment came wrong symlink.

When repackaging was fixed tlmgr => 10829 reported an error and fixed
it (in both cases) but in the second case standard 10392 neither
reported nor fixed it

No explicit free licence statement means it's non-free in most
countries, anyway, so the "noinfo" tag from the catalogue is a non-free
category, right? So the question is whether it's non-free as
"other-nonfree" or as "noinfo"?

I think it's rather noinfo than other-nonfree indeed. Dosctrip default
headers cannot be regarded as a valid licence statement IMO. By the way,
if I didn't know you have already more than enough work, I would suggest
creating a "docstrip" tag for licence. Or anyway, I'd like to collect
(alone or with other's help) a list of packages with this problem and
present it to the LaTeX team once the list of verified problems gets big
enough.

Licence information in docstrip automatic headers is just plain
non-sense, cannot have any legal validity, and costs valuable
developer's time in futile investigations. I feel the LaTeX team
underestimates the problem, maybe they could change their mind if
presented with a reasonably big list of packages with this problem.

I tend to agree, except it's not what happens when *we* put it in TeX
Live, but when *anyone* tries to put it in a usable form.

(Well, I'm really tempted to change my local copy of docstrip.tex (the
licence allows this) so that it says "this file, as well as its source
\filename.dtx and the compiled documentation, can be freely used,
distributed and/or modified under the terms of the LPPL v1.3 or higher":
then a lot of packages would "become" free when processed for TL, which
clearly shows how the whole thing is non-sense.)

Actually I am more concerned with packages which are discovered to be
non-free and are removed from TL. Experimental version of TL really
removes packages and in any Math Dept (or similar structures) one can
find at least couple of users with the very small knowledge and very
large aplomb who would tear apart system manager if some package they
use suddenly disappears (as our sysadmin tells it is enough that they
come with "You modified something and the file we processed before
cannot be processed anymore!!! No, no, we modified nothing, it was
YOU!!!" -- then he restores from backup and diff shows that these guys
really modified their files". My esteemed colleagues go away grudging
something like "Next time we will get you")

current docstrip doesn't do this; if it puts anything "extra" in the
stripped file, it's what has been supplied (as \preamble ...
\endpreamble) in the .ins file.  thus, fulminations against the latex
team aren't actually appropriate here (unless you're complaining that
they made a mistake a while back, even though they've now corrected it).

[using third person here, since all this predates my time in the latex
project -- i joined in 1999.]

sure.  put it where current docstrip invents a preamble when the author
hasn't supplied one.

Yep, that's the first thing I thought of about removal, and I didn't
have strong opinion about whether is was more important than consistency
or not.

Now, I just thought of a technical argument in favour of removal: when
we merge two packages into one, it is essential that the old one is
actually removed, or chaos would ensue (a file cannot be owned by two
packages at the same time).

By the way, packages which are discovered to have no other license

Yep, at the beginning I was thinking it should maybe be an option, or...
See my answer in the other thread: sometimes we remove packages for
other reasons (merging, either on our side, or because of inclusion in a
new bundle on CTAN). So if we want to prevent non-free packages from
being removed but remove others, we have to propagate a reason fro
removal or sthg like that. I'm sure no-one in the team wants to do this.

By the way, our sysadmins at university have a quite clear policy about
upgrading software in general and TeX Live in particular: they upgrade
only once every two years or so, and when they do, they send an e-mail
to every one saying "we just upgraded, please check your documents" (not
that most users actually read the sysadmin's mails or do what it asks,
but...) While I don't like the side-effect that we are still stuck with
TL'05 for still a few months, I must admit it works pretty well.

Manuel.

Ok, thanks for the explanation and sorry for misreading the first time.

By the way, looks like it's fixed now (thanks to Karl and/or Norbert): I
just updated from tlcritical, and "texdoc tlmgr" still gives me the man
page in pdf as usual.

Btw, a strategy you could use: before update, run --dry-run update to
see what is to be removed. Then --backup it. And when you heleave
complaints (or evne before, depending on your taste), manually unpack
the backup in texmf-local.

I'm sorry to disagree, but, trying at home (with a fully up-to-date TL'08):

Now, where does the statements right after "IMPORTANT NOTICE" (which

I wouldn't complain if the mistake was only back in time. Just that, in
my experience, the mistake doesn't look as fixed. Now, quoting FM from:

http://www.latex-project.org/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?pr=latex/4019&category=anything&responsible=anyone&state=anything&keyword=&search=

(sorry fro the long line):

I disagree on this point. First, experience (I mean, actually contacting
the author and asking her about her intentions) proves that it's almost
never a conscious choice. Second and maybe more important, the
automatically inserted text depends on the settings on the computer
where the .ins file is processed, not on the author's setting, and thus
cannot have the slightest value about expressing the author's intentions.

(Of course, nothing personal in my "fulminations": I'm actually angry
about the problem, not against the persons. Sorry if it wasn't clear.)

> sure.  put it where current docstrip invents a preamble when the author

You mean, replacing lines 752 to 766 in docstrip.tex, (v 2.5d dated
2005/07/29)?

Of course I don't want to actually do it, just to illustrate the poor
legal value of any such automatic statement.

Manuel.

PS: I think the first part of the text, before "important notice" is enough:

%%
%% This is file `newalg.sty',
%% generated with the docstrip utility.
%%
%% The original source files were:
%%
%% newalg.dtx  (with options: `package')
%%

You read this you know it's a generated file and the actual licence
statement (if any) is to be searched in newalg.dtx. Period.

i don't imagine you keep your sysadmins very long...  (it's not an
environment i would care to work in.  user lunacy is bad enough here, in
a computer science department, but malicious lunacy is just too much.)

for all that, it's good practice to announce when you're going to change
the tex system (or any other system) other people's feet.  (if possible,
announce the upcoming change, having made the system available on a test
machine so that interested parties can experiment, and after the change,
leave an old system available that users can check things on.  this sort
of thing is quite easy nowadays, with virtualisation technology.)

I am in Math Dept where everybody uses LaTeX (some still use 209) even
if a significant number of my esteemed colleagues cannot switch
computer on without few unsuccessful attempts. Those who heard about
existence of texdoc are considered to be geeks. Dept is full of smart
people who are sooo smart that they never read stupid manuals or even
more stupid messages from sysadmins. This is why systadmins asked me
to take care of texlive (they know that I can always answer "I cannot
imagine why any intelligent human being need this stupid package but
TeXperts like you can always instal it into your own TDS tree" :-)

I thought about this but I don't want to populate texmf-local without
need since then I need to watch if the package has been updated on
CTAN. Since I am not sysadmin I can always say "What God gives, God
takes away; pray hard and He may be will return it to you: :-)"

No need, docstrip loads a configuration file docstrip.cfg if present.

docstrip also could provide a warning (or even error) that tells
the author about the licence trouble that comes with a missing
preamble with license information.

I need (for demo) two simple packages which are not part of TL (and
never were in TL2008, so removed packages do not fit)

Thank you in advance for suggestions

Nonfree packages must be removed.  It's purely an accident and a mistake
that they were ever in TL -- if we had discovered that package foo was
nonfree on August 3 instead of October 3, they would have not been in
the 2008 distribution; we did remove many packages found to be nonfree
over the year, so presumably your problems could occur with those just
as well as those found after the ISO image was made.  There's no
rationale for them to stay around just because we didn't realize the
problem before an arbitrary cut-off date.  In some cases, it could have
been technically illegal for us to distribute them to you in the first place.

Manuel also pointed a completely different technical reason why removals
need to happen.

If your situation is so sensitive to missing packages, then I strongly
urge that you back up the packages so you can keep them in texmf-local,
as Manuel also suggested.

Or use tlmgr update --no-remove.  Or don't update.

    No explicit free licence statement means it's non-free in most
    countries

All Berne signatories, anyway.  I don't know about Burundi and Cambodia.

    so the "noinfo" tag from the catalogue is a non-free category,
    right? 

Technically, yes.  But I asked Robin to make the noinfo tag as a more or
less temporary placeholder, so that we can go contact those authors (as
Clea has been hard at work doing).  It is virtually certain that the
authors intended their work to be freely available, so I'm being
expedient and waiting a while for the contacts to happen before removing
them all.

    I think it's rather noinfo than other-nonfree indeed. 

Yes, I agree that newalg is noinfo on CTAN.  And if you feel like
hacking ctan2tds so that it uses a docstrip.cfg that has a default of
LPPLv1.3c or later, sounds good to me :).

To finish with remove I repeat that

    pdfannotextractor was incorrectly symlinked to pdfannotextractor.texlua
    Observing on 10392 I noticed that there was neither error report and
    nor correction later 

Yes.  It's not really tlmgr's job to make sure the packages have proper
contents.  It's just supposed to install what is there.  The incorrect
symlink was unfortunate, but that's life on the bleeding edge.  I'm glad
other versions did more sensible error messages.

    actually with the change of policy: newthm (and some others) were
    removed from TL earlier,

Yeah.  After we publish the new tlmgr, perhaps I'll go back and add
those packages with a placeholder file and then remove them again, so
things will be consistent.

Subject: [tex-live] perl script to install a postscript font into texlive2008
Message-ID: <1223241696.8205.20.camel@olney>


dear texperts---has anyone created a (perl or other) script that
installs a postscript font into texlive (2008)?  I have tried to follow
two different installation instructions on the web (which is probably
what screwed me up), but so far no cigar.

logically, if I understand the font installation inputs, it would seem
to me that I need to have only two input files, a pf[ab] file and an afm
file.  everything that needs to be done with them seems to be
perl-automatable.  So, I would like to volunteer to create a perl script
that does this for me and every other neophyte.

For example, say I have cp30a____.pfb and cp30a.afm in my current
directory.  If my script works,

  $ perl texlive-install-postscript-font.pl cp30a
  Font cp30a (zpcp30ab) installed (from cp30a____.pfb and cp30a.afm).
  Try 'pdftex testzpcp30a.tex' to see that it works.
  $


Now, if I understand the steps, here is what I need (in an obvious mix
of perl and bash right now):

   my $f= $ARGV[0];  ## this is 'cp30a'
   my $f_pfab = glob("$f*.[pP][fF][bB]");  # the type 1 font
   my $f_afm = glob("$f*.[a][fF][mM]");  # the afm file
   ((-e $f_pfab) and (-e $f_afm)) or die "Need correct input files.\n";
# check that I have them

   ## we could convert $f into karl berry's scheme.
   my $kb = karlberry($f)  ## now, $f would be zpcp30ab
   ## if lazy, I could probably use my $kb= $f;

   ## the following are all system commands:

   afm2tfm $f_afm -v $kb.vpl -p texnansi.enc $kb.tfm > $kb.id
   vptovf $kb.vpl $kb.vf $kb.tfm
   #
   mkdir -p ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/afm/$kb/
   cp $f_afm ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/afm/$kb/
   #
   mkdir -p ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/tfm/$kb/
   cp $kb.tfm ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/tfm/$kb/
   #
   mkdir -p ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/type1/$kb/
   cp $f_pfab ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/type1/$kb/
   #
   mkdir -p ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/vf/$kb/
   cp $kb.vf ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/fonts/vf/$kb/
   ##
   cp $kb.id ${TEXLIVE}/texmf-local/dvips/$kb.map
   echo "Map $kb.map" >> ${TEXLIVE}/2008/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
   ##
   texhash
   updmap

   ## here I would like to create a testfile that shows
   ## how to use the font after installation
   echo "\\font\\testme = $kb at 12 pt\n Hello, your font is working. \
\bye" > test$kb.tex

   ## and tell my user how to check that it worked
   print "Font $kb installed (from $f_pfab and $f_afm).\n"
   print "Try 'pdftex test$kb.tex' to see if it works.\n"

Could someone please let me know what steps I have missed?


Actually, given that this kind of script should not be difficult for
someone to write, provided this person knows the setup, I am a bit
surprised that it does not exist just yet.  If I keep each file name in
its own map file, a "delete font" and "list font" script would also be
easy to write.

Help appreciated.

Regards,

/iaw

as you've been told on c.t.t (i think it was), if the answer were
simple, such a script would already have been written.

font installation (for use with dvips/pdftex/dvipdfm) is pretty
nightmarish, and the matter's rendered worse by the file naming issue
(you *really* don't want to use a font foundry's name for a pfb file,
and you've already been told the value of using the standard berry
scheme).

dear robin---I understand, but I need to give it a try anyway *with* the 
Karl Berry naming translations, of course.  I have no choice: I need to 
get certain new fonts installed on my system.  and, yes, I wish I did 
not need it.

Note that I do not need all generality.  I want to stick to our texlive 
distribution and standard postscript fonts only.

of all the guides to font installation on the web (I found about 5), 
which is the most definitive and straightforward (least nuances for odd 
fonts)?  I need to be able to install one font from start to end, so 
that I can get started with some script.

Why? Did it not work with the currently released xparse?

Hi David,
this is indeed quite unfortunate.  There had been a discussion about
"The Pirate Bay" on this list already, but at this time the only
concern was that it's not appropriate to use a facility whose main
purpose is to illegally distribute copyrighted material.  

Thanks to Phil Taylor and Martin Schr?der, TL is now registered at
Legit Torrents:

  http://www.legittorrents.info/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=5f37802bcabce57413a8008e1061721e694e193b

David, you are indeed the first one who reported such things.  Not
everybody is able to see what you reported.  It depends on where you
are.  I, for instance, see only advertisements in German.  Maybe this
is the reason nobody noticed it before.

IMO the situation is not acceptable.

Karl, the file acquire.html mentions both, "The Pirate Bay" and
"Legit Torrents".  I'm not a torrent expert but I assume that a link
to "Legit Torrents" is sufficient.  WDYT?

There is another problem, but I already said that I'm not a torrent
expert:

The link mentioned above contains a table entry:

  Update     http://tpb.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce

Does it mean that "Legit Torrents" depends on "The Pirate Bay"
somehow?  Hopefully not.

My computer is bored when I'm not at home.  I already considered to
install a torrent client.  But I refuse to use any software whose
purpose is to distribute files illegally.  Martin, you are much more
familiar with torrents.  Is there any way to get rid of "The Pirate
Bay" completely?   Means that "Legit Torrents" does all the
management itself.  It would be a great improvement.

David, thank you very much for reporting the problem.  It's a very big
problem indeed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, it does.  The Pirate Bay is a private tracker,
which means that it adds information to a torrent
to prevent it (The Pirate Bay) from being bypassed.
My attempt to register TUG as a content producer with
Mininova appears not to have succeeded (there has
been no reply), so unless/until TUG/CTAN is willing
to host its own tracker (or until someone else uploads
TeX Live to a tracker which is less liable to arouse
concerns amongst some visitors), I am afraid that The
Pirate Bay will remain the sole tracker for TeX Live
and friends.

I could be misremembering, but I thought that there was some sort of
warning regarding what one could expect to see when this was announced
to the list. It might have been on the MacTeX  list rather than here,
though.

I don't think that the purpose of Azureus (highly recommend this
client) is to distribute an illegal software (and I suspect that the
illegal movies/music far exceed s/w in the traffic) or of Firefox to
distribute an illegal content.

But according to my procmail log the sole purpose of Micro$oft Outlook
is to send spam/scam  :-)


Victor

PS One should remember that for decent user (not freeloader) up/down
ratio should be at least 0.9 which means that 2.44 Gb file will eat at
least 4.5 Gb of your traffic. So I think that distributing of
uncompressed ISO over WAN is not a good idea. I distribute such things
only over LAN.

Thanks for the bug report. I added \iffontchar so that the existence of 
bullet is checked and math bullet used if the former not found.

I have just uploaded a new version of gmutils to CTAN.

BTW, the ancient xparse ? 1999 present in TL2007-13 (Ubuntu package) 
collides with xkeyval, namely: that ancient xparse uses \KV at def not 
provided by (x)keyval.

So I rewrote xparse (te command declared with \DeclareDocumentCommand 
made \protected) and included it into gmutils.

Regards,
Grzegorz.

It is not censorship to select advertisements (and their prices)
according to the tolerance level of your customers and the interests of
the customers.  That's just the market at work.

If you have a childrens' book with advertisements for adult books in its
back, you'll lose a significant number of customers.  So you don't do
that.

I don't see anything wrong with changing providers if people are
bothered by the association.  I'd consider it polite to tell the
provider about the reasons for that change so that he has better
information for estimating the consequences of his advertisement
choices.

It must be noted, however, that the typical user on the look for TeX
resources will be hard put to avoid seeing sites like
<URL:http://www.latex.de> anyway.

And how can you say what advertisement suits texlive potential users? If 
the advertisement restrict the userbase for a legal reason, then it make
sense to change advertisements, but otherwise I see no reason for
discrimination, since free software is also based on non-discrimination
among uses.

That's not the question.  The question is what advertisements are
acceptable to the content providers, in this case the TeXlive team.

Most children would have little qualms accepting and enjoying adult
advertisements in their books.  But they are not the ones making the
decisions.

You are confused.  Free software gives you the freedom to use it in any
way you want.  Advertisements don't give you the freedom not to see them
in the first place.  They are designed to convey their message in 5
seconds, and the first 2 of them you can hardly avoid.

If I don't like advertisements in my free software, I can remove them,
once and for all.  If I don't like advertisements in my software
tracker, tough.

Personally, I don't use web tools for that sort of thing, so I am not
likely to see advertisements of any sort.  But if there is sufficient
annoyance among the TeXlive team about the suggested message, I can
understand the desire to look elsewhere.

This was a joke. Setting the browser to accept cookies which will be
accessible to everyone (rather than to the same server/the same
domain) means very lame security.

I find inconsistent to reject thepiratesbay but to accept mininova.org
(successor of infamous supernova) which is full of the illegal content

BTW gmail places announcements basing on the content of the thread and
I can see (very non-invasive) advertisements of latex gloves (but not
other objects made latex, at least objects probably being promoted by
the site www.latex.de). I wonder if the people exchanging emails
discussing these objects get LaTeX commercials (like "Use LaTeX to
insert formulae into Word" - actually I find them really offensive:-)

That's not something the content provider can use, whereas a software
redistributor can remove ads he does not like from free software.

I agree with David here and I know from private mail conversions that
he and I are certainly not alone.

A producer would usually like to control its sales channels which in
this particular case is where users can download the software. Does
one want a very useful and free piece of software like TeXlive to be
associated with software piracy (just the name of the website for
crying out loud!) and "instant sexual charisma" as the advert said
when I just visited the torrent? I can understand if one doesn't.

If you look at the business world, some high-end suppliers of home
entertainment refuse to sell their products in hypermarkets because it
will associate their products with what they believe to be inferior
products and buyers will be less likely to pay the extra premium for
the high-end product. Brand value and image as we would say in the
media business.

Does one wants to have a free piece of software like TeXlive to be
associated with censorship?

But texlive isn't sold (at least when distributed as a torrent), so this
doesn't really apply. Moreover I can't see the evidence you base
yourself when implying (with an analogy) that downloaders will be less 
likely to download texlive in such context. If you have no such
evidence, it seems to me that this is censorship and not a media plan.

I agree that it would be better to avoid advertisements, for the reason
you state above, but if there are some, I can't see the reason to
discriminate against different advertisements. Of course the TeXlive team
may want to, but I can't see on what grounds, except on moral and then
it is censorship (something that the TeXlive team may want to do, but it
is not obvious).

Bad advertising.

Pickiness is not the same as censorship.  It is not our duty to support
the advertising of some distributor if we don't want to.

I do not think being selective about distribution channels equals
censorship. You are of course entitled to that point of view, if that
is indeed your point of view.

I just want TeXlive to be taken seriously, not only by users but also
by the businesses some try to provide TeX-based solutions for. The
associations as I listed above in the example does not reflect
positively on the image of TeXlive.

I gave an example of image and brand value. Even if the product isn't
sold through this channel, it does not mean there is no brand value.
Take Open Office and the way they distribute their office suite,
including torrent distribution. They are concerned about brand value
and being taken serious.

Can you find a link from the Open Office site to this? With the number
of seeds and leeches, do you think this is coming from Open Office
themselves? And why only so few releases out there? Answer: Because
this torrent is created by individual users, not Open Office itself.

Interesting... but who uploaded it?

F.e. was uploaded by M$?

:-)

Probably this fellow who uploaded OO was just trying to boost
upload/download ratio

Yes, and the TeX Live torrent was created by an individual
user (me), not by a member of the TeX Live team, all of whom
are far too busy working on improving TeX Live itself to spend
time creating and uploading torrents.

Anyone with access to the ISO file can create and
upload a torrent, to any tracker to which they have
access.  If someone else would like to create a new torrent,
and upload it to a tracker that carries no dubious material
whatsoever, I am sure that TUG and the TeX Live team will
be delighted, and will link to it.

I'm a downloader who went away as soon as I connected to that site,  
and rather downloaded the MacTeX.dmg; also, the OP went away from that  
site.

openoffice has been available for p2p download for a long time:
http://distribution.openoffice.org/p2p/

maybe a way to uphold the torrent service but avoid having people  
getting offended by ads on The Pirate Bay would be to offer the  
torrent as a direct download from the TUG website. I do not think  
that just because the tracker is linked to Pirate Bay, Mininova or  
any other torrent database the whole idea of offering texlive as a  
torrent should be abandoned. The tracker itself does not carry any  
dubious material.

Best,
Alex

It may work or may not, depending how tracker is set-up.

Long-long ago the way for Soviet mathematicians to get a book
published abroad was to work as a reviewer for Math Reviews or
Zentralblatt fur Mathematik and use the (virtual) royalty to buy the
books from AMS or Springer-Verlag. So the friend of mine once ordered
the book of Spivak "The Joy of Sex" but when his order arrived he
discovered his error :-) but realized later that it was actually very
useful book. I wonder how many people downloaded the torrent assuming
that it was "Sex Live 2008" :-)

tlmgr is programmed in perl, and we never even touched Java. So these

Not with censorship, but with choices made for quality and user
convenience, yes. And that is exactly what moving away from thepriatebay
would reflect.

Beside all the good points made by others, I think it is useful to
promote legal torrent sites, and more generally to promote the idea that
downloading software without paying for it can be legal, and appreciated
by the authors of the software. This doesn't fit thepiratebay's name.

Manuel.

We don't have the bandwidth.  In fact we go to some trouble to steer
"most" downloads away from tug.org.

I guess so.  It seems a bit disingenous since it just points to Pirate
Bay, but it would reduce any unexpected shocks.  Ok, I made that
change.  Thanks.

First of all, I see that many people refer to "The TeX Live team" in
this thread.  Let me make clear that I'm not the TeX Live team.  I
just contributed a little bit but I can't speak for the team,
especially because we didn't discuss this issue internally.  What I
said/say is my personal opinion.

Patrice Dumas writes:

What I'm concerned about has nothing to do with censorship at all.  

Ideally kids learn TeX at school.  Unfortunately it's not very common,
but I'm aware of such a project in Germany.  The teacher, Andreas
Hirsch, is probably on this mailing list too.  I suppose that he gets
into trouble with parents if they recognize that their kids download
TeX Live from sites containing links to pornographic material.

That's what I'm concerened about.

And, having German law in mind, teachers who point their pupils to web
sites containing links to pornographic material will hopefully enjoy
their life in prison.  Again, it has nothing to do with censorship.

Patrice, I could re-formulate your question:

    Does one wants to have a free piece of software like TeXlive to be
    associated with pornographic material?

David (Bone), I followed the link http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html
pointing to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4370579 again and now I
also get advertisements like "Meet these girls from your area!".  Sigh!

No, censorship is something completely different. What I'm asking for
has definitely nothing to do with censorship.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The idea is to download the .torrent files from tug.org instead of
pirate bay. Surely we have the bandwidth for that? :-)

Clearly no, because it is problematic and illegal for minors and so 
discriminate against minors to be able to get texlive. However if it is
really pornographic material (at least in most countries) there should
be a opt-in screen asking whether one want to continue or not. Agreed
some ads don't follow that, and it is ok for me to avoid those. However
if the site abides to the opt-in screen (and other technical measures 
for child protection), I can't see what's the issue. 

If there is an evidence that the torrent repels more people than it attracts 
because of these ads, which may be the case, but deserves looking at 
some measures, avoiding those ads could also be conceived as an 
improvement of the market share of texlive. Also if it hurts the texlive 
brand, but here also there should be some evidence, in my opinion,
avoiding those ads makes sense.


And lastly TeXLive people may don't like pornographic ads and prefer
other ads, but then it is censorship (something they can favor, I just
find it odd, I thought that people in free software were also in favor
of free speech, any kind of speech, but that's just my opinion).

Nonsense.  Censorship is prohibiting speech to the public.  But it is
not a prohibition of speech if we choose not to hand somebody a
megaphone into our own target audience.

What we choose to offer _our_ private audience is _our_ private choice.

No, this is NOT censorship. Censorship means that we refuse someone
else's rights but no one here wrote that pornographic industry has no
right for advertisement. But people must NEVER be forced to accept any
advertisement. If you consider this as censorship, then all antispam
filters are censorship and must be forbidden. Do you still think that
you must read every byte that comes through your computer, otherwise
it is censorship?

It may work and may not work: AFAIK some trackers (don't think that
thepiratebay is among them) produce non-portable .torrent files which
work only on the computer they were cooked for (probably MAC address
is embedded).

One can  also provide the link to the torrent file directly.

<kidding>
However both ideas are no better than the piracy: poor people earn
their money from commercials and we are going to use them without
paying

Anyway, the tracker seems to be down: probably their schooner a Royal

I agree. But here the question is not ads or no ads, but which ad.
I would also prefer no ad, but if there is, discriminating against
specific ads is censorship.

So if you are wearing any clothes at all, picking a particular color is
censorship?  If you only buy particular papers rather than grabbing the
first off the counter, that is censorship?

Others call that choice.  You are arguing against us having a choice.  I
don't see what this has to do with freedom.

Your opinion does not agree with mine, and apparently with those of
others.  Repeating it is not likely to change that.

dict censorship
[...]

>From WordNet (r) 2.0 [wn]:

  censorship
       n 1: counterintelligence achieved by banning or deleting any
            information of value to the enemy [syn: {censoring}, {security
            review}]
       2: deleting parts of publications or correspondence or
          theatrical performances [syn: {censoring}]

We are not deleting anything.  We are just choosing a different channel.
The logical conclusion of your argument is that choice implies
censorship and unfreedom.

No, there is no law saying that everybody strictly MUST ACCEPT
everything which is offered. Someone offers you free hosting for
torrents but wants to put ads to your product. you then decide whether
you want to put your torrent to that particular service. It is not
discrimination, it is business agreement. There is no law forcing you
to put your SW to all servers that offer you to do it, you have right
to select. At least I believe that declaratin of human rights entitles
me with such rights and does not force me to accept pornographic
advertisement connected to my products which should be available also
for children.

Maybe censorship is not really appropriate. The right analogy, in my
opinion would be that you refuse to sell your book to a shop that also
sells book you don't like, (like porn books, for example). If this is
for a brand or for attracting customers, fine (although this is in
general forbidden, for competitivness issues, but here this is not
really relevant, texlive is free), but there should be metrics that prove 
it. Otherwise this is not direct censorship, but indirect, through 
discrimination.

Indeed, I seem to be rather alone, so I'll stop here, I feel I am
waisting my time and other people time (who are certainly better working
on texlive ;-).

Message-ID: <a6e8c1d0810080342r71e818c9m19de8d7dfa067ac1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been asked if files such as .ins files (which I assume are
sourcefiles in tlpdb terms) are required in my tex live packages. Can
I omit all sourcefiles?

Also a user who used to use Slunits.sty in the old tetex tex distro,
has found it not available in scheme-tetex in texlive. Is that
correct? Has it moved?

On a similar note I have had to move ifxetex.sty into my scheme-tetex
package, so that things like beamer will work in pdflatex for example.
A good idea for upstream?

Thanks

but the suggestion isn't that tex live shoud (by some mechanism or
other) discriminate against some ad or other.  the suggestion is that a

Not _to_ a shop, but _through_ a shop.  And exclusively.

No, it isn't.  I am free to pick distributors for my books.  I can't
prohibit the resale of books bought through channels I permitted.  But I
certainly am free to pick my original distributor any way I want.

It is one of the great evils of our times that people don't discriminate
what they support as long as makes things cheap for them.  They think
that they have no choice but support war, child labor, animal and human
torture and other things because it makes things cheaper for them, and
they should not look beyond the price for whatever misbegotten reason.

Whether or not we choose to distribute through Pirate Bay or not is a
rather unimportant choice in comparison.

But your line of argument, that one should not discriminate between
things that are different, is used for quite worse decisions and
non-decisions.  Personally, I am not bothered all too much about porn
ads but am perfectly comfortable with picking a channel that more users
and developers will feel appropriate.  But I am bothered about people
who preach ignoring one's values, conscience, and ability to choose and
make a difference.

Apathy is not a virtue.

nobody cared for scheme-tetex for some time, if you want to take over
that and suggest some PACKAGES (not single files) to be moved/added
there, fine with me.

I am still using scheme-tetex :) What are people using instead as a
semi-minimal scheme?

What all the fuss is about?

Does TL team prohibit anyone to make a torrent and upload it to
ThePirateBay, Mininova, HotBabe, PornoChicks or any other torrent site
of his/her choice?
NO

Has Webmaster of tug to provide a link to every torrent site where TL
2008 can be downloaded?
I don't think so. TUG and TL team have right to discriminate (and IMHO
they are not required to provide any explanations)

Related: I don't deny anyone rights to use any webmail or mail agent;
but I feel absolutely free to put my filters so anything mailed from
yahoo or hotmail or with Outlook is stored to SuspectedSpam (unless in
the whitelist).

No idea, scheme-medium maybe? Honestly, I don't care ;-)

In Debian we ship a package "texlive" which depends on the *recommended
collections, and that is it. I don't support full coverage of tetex.

If you distribute packages: A lot of files may not be distributed without 
their sources, e.g:

from book.cls:

  %% This file may only be distributed together with a copy of the LaTeX
  %% base system. You may however distribute the LaTeX base system without
  %% such generated files.
  %%
  %% The list of all files belonging to the LaTeX base distribution is
  %% given in the file `manifest.txt'. See also `legal.txt' for additional
  %% information.

from manifest.txt:

classes.ins

So book.cls may only be distributed together with e.g. classes.ins.

Note: IMO installation in a multi user environment is a kind of distribution.

If you do not distribute anything: you may omit all source files. Nevertheless 
some source files may contain additional information, e.g. examples or 
implementation documentation, that may be usefull in some cases.

That is true, but we on Debian have decided that the sources have to be
*available* but not necessarily being installed.

So tehy are distributed witht he cls files, but the user decided not to
install them.

Same is btw valid with TeX Live, network installation, option install
the source files or not.

well, it seems this censorship-discussion is going in circles. In the  
end it does not alter the fact that some people who followed the link  
from TUG to the Pirate Bay felt disturbed. Again, the most simple  
solution seems to be to host the .torrent file (the small one  
necessary to start the p2p download) on the TUG site and delete the  
link to Pirate Bay (or link to other torrent-providing websites).  
Leave TeXLive on the Pirate Bay, our latex-wearing friends might end  
up trying LaTeX as well.
OpenOffice really seems the example to follow, in my opinion.
In the end the fact that torrents are so criminalized is also a  
result of the little use serious programs make of it. I would  
therefore regret seeing that the option of downloading TeXLive via  
torrent is abolished all together.

Best,

Alex

Yes, I agree. Fortunately, a lot of linux distros use torrents too.

Hi,
I'm wondering whether a completely different approach is feasible,
completely avoiding torrents at all.  I just tried

   wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/Images/texlive2008-20080822.iso.lzma

and got:

Connecting to mirror.ctan.org|142.132.30.225|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found
Location: http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/mirror/ctan/systems/texlive/Images/texlive2008-20080822.iso.lzma [following]

I aborted the download and tried again.  This time mirror.ctan.org
directed me to ftp.join.uni-muenster.de.

Download speed was excellent, my DSL connection was the bottleneck.

Isn't this exactly what we need?  And nothing else?

Maybe I miss something.  But I think that this solution has a lot of
advantages:

  1. Simplicity: A link to mirror.ctan.org in texlive/acquire.html is
     sufficient.  People can click on it and get the ISO image.  No
     explanations and no extra software is needed, and no other web
     sites advertising unsolicited stuff are involved.

  2. Maintainability: The script which directs requests to CTAN to
     CTAN mirrors is obviously maintained by the CTAN team.  With
     other words, it's under their control.

  3. Independency:  Nobody else but tug.org and CTAN maintainers are
     involved.

And everything needed exists already and is well maintained.

Is it reasonable to go this way and to simply remove links to the
torrents?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, namely that wget works with reget, ie with restarting a interrupted
download, while most browsers don't do that, they overwrite and restart.

Yes, but: Do you want to fund and maintain a server without traffic limits?

DANTE's and TUG's servers have traffic limits. Serving 2G isos will
exaust them very fast.

I think the purpose of the torrent is to provide an alternative way for
users who care about the CTAN mirror's bandwidth and are willing to give
a bit of their own bandwidth, but of course everyone is free to use a
CTAN mirror (that's what I did myself btw).

Message-ID: <48ED2C2D.8030607@elzevir.fr>

Hi,

I'm quite sure the question was already asked here, but I wasn't able to
find the thread again, so...

Is there any way to create an installation profile for installing TL on
a bunch of machines without needing to manually select the collections
and options in the installer every time?

It could really help my university's students servers sysadmins if I
could generate such a profile for them. Atm, the only solution I can
imagine is creating a custom scheme by manually editing the tlpdb, but
surely there is something simpler?

Thanks,
Manuel.

Install it once, and you will have the texlive.profile in
DESTDIR/tlpkg/texlive.profile

FWIW, our current theory is that the tlmgr in tlcritical has all the
major bugs noted fixed.  We want to release it ASAP, of course.  So if
anyone else is willing to try updating from there, now would be a good
time.  To repeat the details:

  tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --list

(To actually do the update, use --all instead of --list, as usual.)

Is pdftk still maintained? Yes, it works but not perfectly (I am using

If it is maintained I will try to compile some list of not-found files

That's still normal and is going to happen on the first update (and only
the first, supposedly).  We can't change what the installed tlmgr does ...

BTW, it is important to do this :).

Norbert, I wonder if we could write out the absolute path to updater.bat
instead of this relative one?  It is not necessarily obvious to the user
where it is.

That *cannot* be changed since at that time you are using the *old*
tlmgr and are *installing* the new one.

Only *after* the installation from there it should not complain anymore!

My suggestion was not to use tug.org or CTAN at all, but to download
from mirrors.  Please read my mail again.

Most of these have traffic limits. Using torrents helps.

Hi Michael,

    tar: /dev/rmt/0: No such file or directory

This message tells me that although we attempted to make all our tar
invocations work with vendor tars, apparently we failed on your
i386-solaris system.  I'm sorry.  I'll try to reproduce on a similar
system and fix our installer.

The best way forward for you would be to install GNU tar, which can be
compiled from its original source (http://www.gnu.org/software/tar) or,
I expect, precompiled from some Solaris source.

By the way, for testing purposes, you may find it less frustrating to
use scheme=minimal than the default scheme=full, since it'll download a
tiny fraction of the full distribution before failing to install it ...

Hope this helps,
Karl

at present, my department is doing just that.  it costs us, directly,
from our budget -- the cost of the connection for the university is
shared out between departments pro rata to their amount of traffic.

yesterday, for the first time, cambridge's ftp transfers totalled more
than 100gbytes in 24 hours.  a quick glance revealed that *one* of the
clients was in a cambridge college (so not accountable, for us).

i've discussed this with my manager, and he has decided not to do
anything ... for the present (we're all very busy), but traffic shaping
is going to come, if the traffic levels remain as high as they are just
now.

the other point reinhard misses is that he's in a relatively privileged
position: able to use wget (and friends) and to pull rather quickly.
for a significant part of our user base, this simply isn't possible:
i've friends who save money by having a traffic-limited home connection
-- loading a 2gb image just isn't in their game plan, and there are
still -- gasp -- those who use dial-up or isdn connections.

    Also a user who used to use Slunits.sty in the old tetex tex distro,
    has found it not available in scheme-tetex in texlive. 

I have now added SIunits to scheme-tetex.

    I have had to move ifxetex.sty into my scheme-tetex
    package, so that things like beamer will work in pdflatex for example.

I moved ifxetex into collection-latexrecommended some time ago (after
the release, I guess), and scheme-tetex depends on
collection-latexrecommended, so that one should be all set.

Ok, then the network installer will not work because it uses the same
facilities, right?

I have had the same problem myself and forgot to report.

GUN tar is already in S10, installed as /usr/sfw/bin/gtar. I got around it
by making tar a temporary symlink to gtar.

Yes, it worked perfectly:

c:\test>tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --list
tlmgr: installation location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical
bin-texlive: local: 10306, source: 10873
texlive.infra: local: 10366, source: 10890
texlive.infra.win32: local: 10206, source: 10873

c:\test>tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --all
tlmgr: installation location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical
UPDATER has been created, please execute tlpkg\installer\updater.bat

after running updater.bat (from an icon):
c:\test>tlmgr update --all
worked well, bin-texlive and texlive-infra were omitted, as expected, so 
that's OK.
The only minor problem found:

update: fontinst (7340 -> 10781) ... done
That should not happen: fontinst.win32 mentioned somewhere, but neither 
new nor force removed, please report!

Norbert, many thanks!
All the best,

Hello,

I have been trying to install TeXLive2008 over the internet on a 
Solaris10/AMD64 box (SunOS mikefire1 5.10 Generic_137112-07 i86pc i386 i86pc) 
but the "./install-tl" script breaks after it downloads the packages, with the 
message:

Note that I've tried several times to issue the command every time checking 
all the options and using 'I'. The target platform is correctly identified.

Any help would greatly appreaciated ....

This isn't obvious apparently.  What about adding something like

  Note: while updating, the old tlmgr stuff is used, thus expect
  warnings like

    foo cannot be found in ...

  about packages not found.  In the second run, the new data is used,
  and those messages should disappear.

to a pop-up window (or whatever) before the actual updating process starts?

Karl,

thanks for the quick reply. 

Indeed using a GNU tar version did the trick for Solaris10_x86  

Thanks for all the good TeX work ....

Ettore,

thanks for the reply. I used a recent GNU tar and that did the trick on 
Solaris 10.

Michael

What about making the installer software walk over the path, searching
for GNU tar (this is, looking for `tar' and `gtar') and prefer this if
found?  Otherwise, a warning could be emitted that the system's native
`tar' might cause problems.

I compared a pdf (207 pp.) typeset in my updated laptop against the  
same typeset of my un-updated desktop: both are identical (which is,  
by the way, what I care about).

Just for my peace of mind ---no real problem here, right? Everything  
seems to be working fine, so I assumed the above is normal, is it?

Ask the current maintainer, ssteward at AccessPDF.com

It seems at least a bit stale; the latest version (1.41) is now nearly
2 years old.

Thanks! I know, but cannot compile 1.41 on MacOSX due to the lack of
library which comes with the gnome.

However I meant (but my fingers lived by their own lives :-)

No, because that is only a symptom of the testing. As soon as we move
the new stuff to tlnet/2008 these messages will go away anyway. That is
the reason why we called for guinea pigs ..

If you get it right the first time, you don't need as many updates.

pdftk is available for MacOSX via macports.  It needs libiconv.  Macports is,
however, a PITA because it provides tetex and has dependencies for it.
So far it has worked to keep macports after the texlive bin directories, so
all texing is done using TL rather than tetex versions.

Well, the ISO image is currently top
of the "new software" category; I hope
that the LZMA version and MacTeX will
shortly be joining it (all three have
been uploaded, but only the ISO has
so far appeared).

The beauty of texdoctk is that it points to the nice inner library. I
was giving demo to grads two days ago and ..

1) Search did not find amsmath
2) Chapter "Guides And Tutorials" contains no wrong links; there is a
complain that CTAN.sites is an unknown extension. It would be nice to
have it html with all the links
3) Chapter "Fundamentals" contains no wrong links but texlive is
needed (tetex is here
4) Chapters "Macro programming" and "Accessory programs" contain no bad links.


More to follow later (there was some not found link and I will find it again)

  If I'm not mistaken, /dev/rmt is the device name for the tape drives
on Solaris, and the default input / output location for Solaris tar
(Tape ARchive).  Maybe there is some switch to work around that, and we
don't need to expect "tar" to behave like GNU tar.

  On the other hand, Solaris comes with quite a lot of GNU software
nowadays (/usr/sfw contains free programs compiled by SunFreeWare); it's
probably safe to assume that if there is a "gtar" in the PATH, it's GNU
tar, and to use that one instead of "tar".

Hi Arthur, 

I ended up using a GNU version of tar and the installation proceeded 
"without a hitch" (with something like env $PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" 
./install-tl ...). 

I've been using TL2008 and so far everything looks good....

Thanks for the reply,

Michael

It is indeed true that gtar is installed (by default?) in Solaris 10 as
/usr/sfw/bin/gtar, but whether tar or gtar will be picked depends on the
relative positions of /bin and /usr/sfw/bin in PATH. It got me as well,
when I first tried. I'd say it's better to work with the vendor supplied
tar.

  Actually, my message was rather directed to the TeX Live team, in
order to find a definitive fix for this particular problem.  Of course,
in your case, since you have GNU tar installed, and you know how to use
it, you're better off using it directly.

  I've been compiling many programs on Solaris myself, and contributed
patches to makefiles and source files, and as a rule, I tried to use the
Solaris tools, but very often, it is really simpler to use the GNU
version of every program (at some point last year, I had to use two
different shells consecutively during the XeTeX build; I don't know how
Jonathan fixed the problem in the end).

Ettore,

I believe that s/w under /usr/sfw belong to the standard Solaris10  
distribution which derive from OSS sources. Indeed there is a gtar there:

mikefire1[pts/11]:~/e2 > /usr/sfw/bin/gtar --version

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv2+: GNU GPL version 2 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>

...


Vendor's tar is under "/usr/bin/tar"

Note that some times people may install OSS packages under /usr/local/bin as 
for instance packages from 'sunfreeware.com' which derive from GNU. The tar 
there is GNU tar but it is called 'tar' which may conflict with the vendor's 
tar.

Can we assume that if we are installing on solaris that
	gtar
is available? If yes, I can change the installer so that on Solaris it
uses gtar. But I don't want to add search code for binaries etc etc.

Best wishes

  You can assume that GNU tar is available in /usr/sfw/bin/gtar, exactly
at that location.  I'm not sure if it would be in the user's default
PATH, though.

There is no need to discuss the (g)tar issue further.  I will look into
the invocations and make them work with Solaris tar.  I don't expect it
to be a problem, I've done this a zillion times before.

I am an outsider in TeXlive internals, but based on my experience (with large 
UNIX/Linux SMPs), I agree with you that the native tools should be considered 
always. 

Nevertheless, I am very glad installation was successful and I am greatful to 
people who put in so many hours to keep this project moving on.

No, you cannot make that assumption.  Sun provides gtar in
/usr/sfw/bin/gtar, but only in Solaris 10.  Earlier releases of
Solaris do not have it, and even /usr/sfw may be an optional package
at some sites.  Sun also has an optional /opt/sfw tree, but that does
not have gtar.

If you need features of GNU tar, it must be made available separately
in the installation process.  But why not stick with historical tar
instead, so as to preserve maximal portability.

Ease of maintenance -- nobody has access to all the systems, so it
would be nice to keep the diversity down so you don't have to seek
out a specific platform to test/debug.  While the source scripts may
describe the way Solaris tar is expected to behave, that may not be
a lot of use next year when there is a problem on Solaris 11 and there
aren't any nearby.   In general, it is better to expect some degree of
uniformity on systems that run tex if it keeps the installer simpler.

The pax archiver seems to be widely available and, being newer,
may not suffer from the diversity of vendors' tar implementations.   Rather
than trying to support legacy tar versions, it makes more sense to
support pax.

Hi Norbert,
the code already exists:

  TeXLive::TLUtils::which()

which($program) either returns /path/to/$program or 0 (false) if
$program is not in $PATH.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update
Message-ID: <200810120002.m9C02k823369@tug.org>

We have updated the tlmgr packages (bin-texlive and texlive.infra) in
the main repository.  They will be making their way around the mirrors
over the next couple days, as usual.

So now, simply running tlmgr update --all will get the new versions.
(Once your mirror is up to date.)

That is the whole story for GNU/Linux/Unix/MacOSX/etc.

On Windows, as usual, there are special considerations.  It is not
possible to implement a normal update.  Instead, tlmgr update creates a
batch file which you yourself have to run.  (It reports all the details.)

As an alternative, we (= Norbert, as usual :) have created a
self-contained .exe updater for tlmgr using nsis.  Thus, you can simply
download and run
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.exe 
(once it's on your mirror)
and your tlmgr will be updated.

Some of the main news from the original release:
- it will not switch mirrors in the middle of the download
- if a download fails, the existing package will not be uninstalled.
- package additions/removals/updates are logged to TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr.log.
- much more I am forgetting, please read the documentation with tlmgr --help
  or online at http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html.

Fingers crossed,
Karl

They translated the OpenBSD texlive port about a year ago.

Maybe they need to update thier deps?

I can't find it on CTAN. If it isn't on CTAN, you could ask the author
to consider uploading it. My (limited) understanding suggests it is
very unlikely to be considered for inclusion if it isn't on CTAN.

Great idea to create a bloody mess: one adds a new package, then this
package is snatched but it requires another package which is not on
the computer or the newer version of the package which is already
there and in turn ... and all this is while one is traveling with no
or lousy internet connection and all this just to save a fistful of
gigs not sufficient even for  one HD movie

AFAIK auto download can be disabled in MiKTeX. It is no problem in
principle to add some configuration setting for enabling/disabling it.
Or it may say: "I am going to download a missing package. Do you want
me to do it?" All users thus can be satisfied, those who like auto
download as well as those who do not like it and wish to do it always
manually.

I don't like the idea to promote laziness :-) Not that I am very
industrious: I would like to have tlmgr sibling taking care of
texmf-local but there is a difference in the degree of the laziness
:-)

To make autoloading work you have to determine which package supplies
the missing file.   Most people only need the autodownload a few times (e.g.,
when they first load some publisher's LaTeX style or get an MS from a
colleagure).
Many of us have struggled in the past to figure out which package provides some
missing file, but the interest in autodownload would be much less if
there was a
reliable tool to identifiy the package(s) that provide(s) a missing
file.   If users
have to determine a package name they are more likely to seek a bit of
information

  I think some code has been available for years under the name "mpm"
for "MiKTeX package manager" or something like that, although I'm not
sure what it covers; and it would certainly require some effort to adapt
it to TeX Live.  But clearly, the idea sounds very valuable.

And if you are offline or have a lousy connexion? It doesn't matter
whether the download would be auto or manual. Right now, the stuff I
need is there - whether I'm on the bus, waiting in a train station, in
the library, wherever. To deal with this issue, you would need an
option *at install time* or a separate release.

And what happens when I have multiple TeX installations installed? If I
switch to TL 2007, I get the packages that came in 2007. If only some
of them were installed and a document needs something further, I'll be
getting a package which may be different - different from the one I got
on that other computer I used, say. So knowing a document compiled fine
with TL 2007 and that I've still got 2007 on my machine won't be
enough. Not unless all of the packages for previous versions are also
available and the automation is extremely smart. (Obviously this
doesn't apply to TL 2007 since that had no such automation but it would
apply to TL 200x in TL 200x+1.)

I also don't like things which try to auto download and install
software "of their own accord" and would personally never enable such
an option. (Or would do what I could to disable it.) But the
complications I'm thinking of above are independent of that concern.

You wouldn't, I would. As long as you can disable a feature it won't
hurt anyone. The only questions which would remain:
1. Is it possible to implement it?
2. Should it be "on" per default or "off" (for first
installers/beginners on would be better, if the majority are non-noobs
"off" would be better -- but they got the information of the existence
of the option beforehand anyway and watch out in my experience for new
options in the installers anyway)
3. What happens when you are offline? (how about an error that the
function is not available until you have an internet connection
available??btw. I've never seen packages that used much of space.
Usually it's just the massive amount of available packages, fonts,
binaries etc which take up so much space of a standard install)

And I don't think that this feature would bloat the install in terms
that someone would notice it. I guess the implementing question is the
biggest one because it should be implemented in a way that the tool
you use to call (your)tex can give you feedback.

mpm is part of the "miktex tools for unix" and of course of the regular
miktex. But if has nothing to do with auto-update (it is sort of the
equivalent of tlmgr).

Anyway, all of miktex source is publicly available if someone wants to
look into it for inspiration.

I am not convinced that a completely automatic
system (even with an opt-out clause) is necessarily
the best approach.  I wonder whether a semi-manual
system, requiring the insertion of code similar to
(at most one of) the following :

	\requires scheme:gutenberg
	\requires package:12many
	\requires collection:basic
	\requires class:book

and so on.  On finding that the local TeX Live installation
did not include a required module, an enhanced TeX engine
would liaise with the TLMGR to initiate its download.

The advantage of this approach is that there is no possibility
that the missing file was actually intended to be sourced
locally, since the use of \requires would be an explicit
declaration that the specified resource is a CTAN resource
rather than a local one.  With the MikTeX approach (and I am
not a MikTeX user, so I may be mistaken here), I believe it
is possible for MikTeX to inadvertently fetch a CTAN resource
when the missing resource was a (non-existent) locally-written
file of the same name as the CTAN resource.

I agree. The fact that I personally would want it off is certainly no
reason not to implement it as an option (default or o/w) if others do.
The two concerns you cut in quoting me had nothing to do with this
personal preference, though.

There are two different sorts of possible options here (not mutually
exclusive):
1. an option at install time to install everything or install a slimmed
down version;
2. given a slimmed down version, an option to have automated or manual
downloads of missing files.

I thought that (2) was being suggested as a solution to the
offline/lousy connexion issue, which it isn't. For that you need (1).
Presumably people installing for multiple users would also need the
options in (1) - at least in many cases.

But I do wonder how it could work with multiple TL installs. What would
happen if I switched to the previous year's release and typeset a file
needing an additional package? Would I get the package for the
appropriate year? I'm not saying there aren't ways of implementing that
but only that it would be another complication you'd have to take into
account in designing an implementation.

Should which aspect be on or off?
2a. Should the default install be to install TL in full or to install a
slimmer version?
2b. For slimmer installations, should automatic download and
installation be on or off by default?

Individual installations should be able to avoid this by installing TL
in full originally, I think. *If* somebody opts for the slimmed version,
this would clearly be a reasonable way of handling the lack of a
connexion when trying to download a package.

Wouldn't the idea be to slim down TL? That is, wouldn't it reduce
"bloat"? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the idea here...

This should be rather easy using texlive.tlpdb. I guess that,
independently of any auto-install feature, we could turn that into a
feature of tlmgr: something like

% tlmgr findfile hypdoc.sty
(returns oberdiek)
% tlmgr findfile --install hypdoc.sty
(installs oberdiek)

Current version of tlmgr:
tlmgr revision 10932 (2008-10-12 01:10:17 +0200)

Previous version:
tlmgr revision 10392


Using the previous version to list and then install updates, I see a 
number of complaints that packages cannot be found:
 	niceframe cannot be found in
 	http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
which I didn't see before. The previous previous version of tlmgr
reports its version as "unknown". Presumably, the additional verbosity
is due to the update to version 10392.

The current version doesn't report the packages as missing from TL when
I ask for a list of updates. Is this correct? I thought that the
current version would be more likely to report the discrepancy and
might even remove the packages.

Thanks,

It looks like current version removes packages if it has instructions
to do so, not if they are not just missing; these instructions are in
the file one downloads from the server.

Because of this (I have tested svn versions for a while) some packages
which were removed from TL before I switched to removing version are
not removed. As a result there is a discrepancy between installations
even if they have now the same version of tlmgr.

Yes, it would have removed the package, but only under very restricted
conditions:
- before the upgrade it is mentioned in a collection you have installed
- the mentioning collection is present on the remote server
- the package is not mentioned in the collection on the server
then it will be removed.

Since you already have upgrade collection-latexextra some time ago
and at that time the package wasn't removed, the test now fails the
first test, it is not mentioned in any collection.

We don't remove these packages because that could be local packages (I
can create my own repository for our department with commercial fonts).
And they should neither be listed with a warning nor removed.

I hope I explained the behaviour. Another, maybe more detailed
explanation can be found in the man page of tlmgr, or
	tlmgr help
(as usual)

It should be so and the mechanism should be quite clever. It may need
quite a lot of information. Suppose the document contains:

\usepackage{something}[yyyy/mm/dd]

The local disk contains an older version of something.sty. The system
will therefore ask upgrade. So far nice but what if the user misprints
the date and ask a new version that does not exist?

That is because you served as guinea pig testing intermediate releases.

Indeed, about 4 or 5 which have been removed in the last weeks due to
licensing issues (I try to make a list):
	niceframe
	grnumalt
	oca
	futhark
	newalg
	hilowres (that was very recent, should hit you tomorrow)

Interesting. I was more thinking of a case where the document contains:
 	\usepackage{something}
etc. and the document is known to compile with TL 2007 but not TL 2008.
If I therefore switch to TL 2007 before typesetting but package
something was never installed in my TL 2007 tree, would I be able to
count on getting the correct version of the package or would I get a
more recent version which might prevent the document compiling?

Hi,
the question is not whether a switch can be provided.  That's the
easiest thing.  TeX Live is a multi-user system and users normally
don't have write permissions to the main texmf trees.  The only
alternative would be install the packages in the user's home
directory.  But then there will be different versions of a particular
package on the system, one installed by the user and one maintained
(installed and updated) by the admin.  I fear that it leads to
confusion.

The question is whether the effort is worthwhile.  Implementation is
not trivial.  I personally fully agree with Victor.  And almost
everybody said that it is a nice feature, but there must be a way to
disable it.  I have the impression that it is just regarded as a "nice
feature" but nobody intends to make use of it.

What I'm most concerned about is that the whole TeX system becomes
more and more complex.  What we are discussing here requires a lot of
new code which has to be written and maintained.  Maybe I'm too
conservative, but I think that it makes a lot of sense to think about
new features very carefully.

There is no way to make everyone happy anyway.

TeX Live offers the concept of 'collections' and 'schemes' for years.
Even if disk space matters, it's easy enough to customize the
installation conveniently.  Isn't it sufficient?  I don't recognise
the value of downloading packages on-the-fly.  It's usually more
anoying then helpful. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, this is my concern basically.

Does it mean that these packages form a separate collection residing on
http//myserver.mydomain.org/myrepository

and they are installed-updated-removed while running

tlmgr --location=http//myserver.mydomain.org/myrepository update --all

and then they will be listed if tlmgr with

tlmgr --location=http//myserver.mydomain.org/myrepository list

while without such --location they will not be touched/listed?

Subject: [tex-live] subversion sparse checkouts
Message-ID: <200810130026.m9D0QaR25052@tug.org>

In the past, a few people asked about doing "excludes" when checking out
the subversion tree, for instance to skip all the binaries they are not
interested in.  Well, subversion still doesn't support excludes
directly, but as of 1.5 it has another way to accomplish the same end:
sparse checkouts:
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.sparsedirs.html

The idea is that you can hand-craft your checkout and avoid the
all-or-nothing recursion.

Just FYI.  I added a link on the tug.org/svn/texlive page.

there _are_ people in the tex world who will complain about distribution
of things for which the licence offers no permission.  (we had a
complaint about charging for the first ever tex live back in the 90s,
even -- there are people who watch these things.)

in general terms, things for which we don't know the licence terms
shouldn't be in tex live.  as it stands, i am currently scanning the
whole of the catalogue, checking all entries containing "licence
unknown", and checking whether this is indeed true.  when i notice one
that declares the package is not debian free, i notify this list.  in
some cases, the licence is explicitly saying that the package should not
be sold (tex live discs get sold), in others it's merely saying the
package doesn't meet the debian guidelines.  either way, the package
gets removed from tex live.

these things may seem to you like excessive creativity in the licensing;
to me they're no more than laziness on the part of the authors, who
simply can't be bothered to write a clear statement of licence
conditions.

lazy authors cause trouble, and often end up with their package removed
from tex live.  poncy complaints, suggesting i'm wasting my time, simply
make me cross.

I never made this complain; first, it is your time, second, clearing
the mess is necessary albeit unpleasant task. I use tons of packages
and not a single of them has been affected.

Hopefully with TL which IMHO made a huge step with 2008 release the
threat to be removed/not to get into it will be a sufficient
insensitive to the authors to deal with licensing in the standard
manner

Well, some operations of tlmgr only work on the local database. Listing
for example a package that is locally installed will not access the
network, so yes, it will belisted.

I fully agree here.  I tend to use the same packages over and over  
again. At the same time HD space is limited for me. I therefore  
switched to MacTeX2008 Basic, a slim TeXLive2008-based distribution.  
I had to add a few packages but that really was not a big deal. A on- 
the-fly solution would not have provided significant advantage to me.  
I am in social sciences and tend to use a limited set of packages.  
Are people in other disciplines more reliant on a very large number  
of packages for one time use only? Only in this latter case an on-the- 
fly solution would make sense in my understanding.

You are overcomplicating things. Miktex has such an on-the-fly
installation for years: If a file is missing and miktex knows through
its database in which package it is it can install it during
installation. It doesn't do it against your wishes.  You can disable the
on-the-fly installation completly, or you can setup things so that
miktex asks you before each installation. In any case you simply get the
newest version of the package -- like you would if you would install it
manually from CTAN or through the package manager.

The thing is useful to fetch packages which are new on CTAN. It is also
useful if you don't want to download and install tons of packages you
never use. It also helps to keep the list of updates small as miktex
shows me only updates for installed packages.

And if my internet connection is down or if I need an old version: I
have enough CD's and DVD's with CTAN images.

IIRC Thomas Esser years ago answered my question about a mechanism for
this in teTeX with "the hook is already there (maketex (?)), it just
needs an implementation". Now that we have a db, it shouldn't be hard
to add this.

Message-ID: <48F3146D.8090409@elvenkind.com>


Hi all,

Many of you will probably know already that I spent the last half
year converting metapost into an application library. I have not
only done that, but also converted the pascal web source code to
C web, and that means the commandline had to be re-implemented.

Now, the new mplib-based mpost commandline is not exactly the same
as the old version, and I welcome advice and thoughts on how to
proceed.

Here is an overview of the commandlines so far:

[-no]-file-line-error

-output-directory=DIR
-recorder


The missing switches were done in the web2c change file, and often
that is the only reason why they are not implemented, but there
are some exceptions. Before the official release, we should decide
which of the missing commandline switches need implementing:

-T      I thought this was ugly, so I skipped it, but it would be
         easy to reinstate. Still, I find it ugly ...

-translate-file=TCXNAME
-8bit
         Mplib has always an implicit -8bit. Everything is passed on
         as-is, except that for the terminal and log, it will print
         characters in the control range (0--31) and DEL (127) in ^^
         notation. So I do not think we need those switches back.

[-no]-parse-first-line

         This is currently always on.

[-no]-file-line-error
-halt-on-error
-output-directory=DIR
-recorder

         I have no idea what to do about these.

The new mpost ignores unknown options, so none of the above will
generate errors, but that may not be a good thing.

I am sending this to texlive as well as mp-implementors.

Best wishes,
Taco

I have no opinion on the other questions, but that one is quite useful.
I often ask people in bug reports or private communication if they have
a problem please run with -recorder and send me the output .lst file.
This way I can actually check which files are used.

Also for distribution to others -recorder comes in handy.

I would suggest implement that one.

Best wishes

I am confused, I assume that we are talking about network, albeit LAN:
You set the repository for Dept members multiple computers, with the
idea to add to their installations collection-private, right?

Anyway, at this moment it seems to be theoretical, since
package-packer s/w and/or instructions have not been released to
general public, right?

Oh, there are catches. Sometimes the installer gets confused due to name
clashes and if a new package needs another package which needs another
package etc ... the on-the-fly installation can take quite a time. And
you can use it only if you have the rights to install things in the main
folder. 

But a tool isn't useless only because it doesn't work perfectly in every
case or if doesn't solve a vital problem but makes life only a bit
easier sometimes. And a small improvement is not worthless only because
a larger one is thinkable.

also ok, fits well in the new tex engines approach too (xetex and luatex 
are 8 bit by design too)

maybe output-directory makes sense (it might be used) but things like

Ulrike Fischer a ?crit :
> You are overcomplicating things. Miktex has such an on-the-fly
> installation for years:

I agree that we should avoid discussing problems for which MikTeX
already has a solution, since we'd better just look at the solution.

OTOH, MikteX and TeX Live are used in quite different contexts. The
basic differences to me are:
1. TeX Live is often used on multi-user systems, or at least systems
where the user is not constantly logged as administrator.
2. TeX Live is used on a variety of system, and you cannot assume X11 or
any other graphical thing is available on them.

One could imagine workarounds to 1 in the following way:
- if the user cannot have sufficient privileges to write in the TL
trees, then just do nothing (tlmgr should never ever touch anything in
TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME).
- if the user can get sufficient privileges, then offer him the occasion
to do so on the fly, as other applications do (but this is a problem
since we cannot rely on uniform mechanisms such as sudo, etc) or...
- just tell the user what to do ("please run tlmgr install oberdiek with
sufficient privileges) but don't actually do anything.

Now comes the second problem: how to communicate with the user (since
obviously we should)? Here it is complicated too because if we
communicate via command line we run into the problem that most user
don't run TeX directly and read its output, but run it from an IDE,
using --batchmode and filtering the output. If we try to pop up a dialog
box like mikTeX does, we run into the problem that the we not
necessarily have a graphical environment at hand (either running on a
sever or compiling in a ssh session, or...)

I think those are the interesting problems: in which way does TL differ
from MikTeX and what does it imply concerning an possible auto-install
feature?

I honestly think (sorry to say that clearly) that comments like "I don't
want it for myself" are completely irrelevant: it's clear that it will
be an option.

Final remark: for such a feature to be useful, we don't necessarily need
to get it work all the time in every context (I think it's impossible
given the variety of uses of TL). We just need to get it work most of
the time for the target audience of the feature (most probably
single-machine users where the normal user has a way to get the
privileges needed to run tlmgr install).

I think if someone wants to propose a patch to kpse with this feature
working at least in some cases, it would indeed be interested: those who
don't want this feature just don't need to enable it.

Manuel.

ulrike expresses my thoughts about the matter precisely.

we must realise that, in the absence of a volunteer to hack at web2c,
all this argument is theoretical.  but that was always so: i speculated
what would be necessary to implement this, getting on for 10 years ago
(following a remark of sebastian's), and had realised then the extent of
the work required.  (i didn't then consider the need for a database of
file pointers ... i imagined that would be an easy business.)

we are now in a better position than ever to provide the facility,
lacking (as we do, now) only the programmer(s) to do the work.

As long as it was an option at install time, wouldn't this problem be
avoidable? Admins installing in such situations (which would include
everyone on Mac OS X as things stand since the texlive tree is
currently owned by root) should simply choose to install TL fully and
to disable the auto-installation facility. So long as the installation
options are clear, those installing should be able to avoid the
potential problems.

So long as that means it's an option to install a full TL originally
and not merely that it is an option to en/disable automatic
installation of additional packages. I hadn't had the impression before
that that was the option people were thinking of.

Or simple packages. I would do that for the tufonts package which are
not on CTAN. Or some commercial fonts, or local packages for our
university style. No need for a collection, simply
	tlmgr -location http://texlive.depart.uni.org/tl2008/ install tufonts

Well, no: All the scripts are available in the subversion repository,
and there is even a documentation available, probably already on your
computer, in tlpkg/doc/repository-setup.txt, and there is a script in
the svn repo that does that already for the ConTeXt minimals, and
ConTeXt people (esp. Mojca) is working on it to improve my script.

So there is enough info available. Just more than what I have written in
repository-setup.txt I will not and want not.

Subject: [tex-live] Trying to maintain updated TL installation on Cygwin
Message-ID: <48F3D4D5.6030809@alice.it>

Periodically I do an svn update of the source directory
(/trunk/Build/source) and build the binaries on Cygwin.

Then I do an rsync of tlnet/2008 from dante.de ftp into /tmp/texlive.

I install (at hand) the binaries (bin) in /usr/local/texlive/2008.

So I can install TL with

/tmp/texlive/2008/install-tl/install-tl -location /tmp/texlive/2008

without choosing any binary platform and accepting the defaults

And all this works...

The problems arise trying to maintain updated the installation using

tlmgr -location /tmp/texlive/2008 update -list
tlmgr -location /tmp/texlive/2008 update -all

mainly when some bin package should be updated.

For example, in the last updating, the command

tlmgr -location /tmp/texlive/2008 update -all

gives some failure (tar: Permission denied) unpacking
bin-texlive.tar.lzma for tlmgr.pl and this file was lost in the
installation...

I think this happens because Cygwin isn't yet in the distro.

Waiting for this in an official manner...

how can I add Cygwin in my local repository, /tmp/texlive/2008?

i.e. How can I create package like bin-*.i386-cigwin etc., so that I
can install TL without the above 'heavy' procedure but simply with:

/tmp/texlive/2008/install-tl/install-tl -location /tmp/texlive/2008 ?

Is there some place in which this is explained?

Thanks,
    Angelo.

Bummer. So it seems that even on cygwin open files cannot be
overwritten. This is a problem on W32 (Karl, look! ;-), and I thought
that this might not be a problem on cygwin, but it is.

The problem is that tlmgr is currently running and you try to replace
itself. That works on unix where opened files can be replaced/changed,
but W32 is just to incapable to allow that.

No, see above.

Not easy, because you have to:
- make a full svn checkout
- add your binaries to Master/bin/i386-cygwin/
- call 
	Master/tlpkg/bin/tlpsrc2tlpdb -all
- then call
	Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-containers ...with...some..args...

> Is there some place in which this is explained?

Some details are explained in tlpkg/doc/repository-setup.txt

For complteness the bin-texlive.tar.lzma package on the mirrors has
still the timestamps:

but should it be updated as reported here [1]?

Hi
does anybody know if there is a posibility to check the hosting machines
OS, so that tlmgrgui-real.pl has a little switch.
On MS Windows Vista there is still the problem that after an update you
have to patch the file by hand...
My idea now is a part in this file that works as follows

check host OS System and write in variable hostos
if hostos == vista then use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(setup_programs
platform_desc win32 debug); else use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(setup_programs
platform_desc win32);

so in further versions it could be posible to run tlmgr without editing
the file after every update by hand.

Greetings

...

Exits with 0 even though parts of the update process failed. In
particular, not all formats were successfully regenerated. (I think
this is because it is pulling in stuff from my person tex tree which is
messing things up.)

I think it should return a non-zero exit status in this case. I also
think the error messages regarding the specific failures and relevant
log location should be repeated at the end, if possible (but maybe it
isn't).

Question: how do I generate the missing formats by hand? I've never had

fmtutil-sys --missing
Is this enough? Or is a further step needed?

Hi Norbert,

the patch is to change the content of tlmgrgui-real.pl in line 27 as far
as I know from
use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(setup_programs platform_desc win32);
to
use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(setup_programs platform_desc win32 debug);

so here I thougt about the switch so that an update doesn't changes this
line again and one has to repatch the file by hand.

Best wishes

That has been fixed since quite some time. I guess you were hit by a
repository inconsistency we had. Tomorrow there should be new packages
and texlive.infra will be updated. After that you should have the fix
for that,too.

Hi Ralph,

Thanks for the reports.  What does tlmgr --version report?

    Should not happen, please report: latexmk.universal-darwin mentioned,  
    but neither new nor forcibly removed

We'll try to fix.

Did you end up with a (resolvable) latexmk symlink in your
bin/universal-darwin directly?

    update: texlive.infra (10932 -> 10960) ... !!!Error: non-existent  
    texmf/doc/man/man1/tlmgr.1
    !!!Error: non-existent texmf/doc/man/man1/tlmgr.pdf

I think this is a leftover bug from the original tlmgr, ie, it's trying
to save those doc files which didn't actually get installed (that was
the bug).  Do you actually have files like texmf/doc/man/man1/tlmgr.pdf
now?  

Thanks,
Karl

In the tlmgrgui-real.pl contained in the current version of

I'm was seeing something similar:

tlmgr update --list

tlmgr: installation location ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
hyperref: local: 10779, source: 10985

rotating: local: 9039, source: 10978
texlive.infra: local: 10932, source: 10960

I haven't actually run the update...

tlmgr --version

tlmgr revision 10932 (2008-10-12 01:10:17 +0200)
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008

> Did you end up with a (resolvable) latexmk symlink in your

Is this new? I don't have such a symlink at the moment.

I still haven't figured out how to regenerate the formats which tlmgr
failed to regenerate. I have some formats dated 16 Oct, some 4 Sep and
some 22 Aug. The ones it couldn't regenerate don't seem to be missing
altogether but they are the ones dated 22 Aug i.e. older than
everything else.

fmtutil-sys --missing (which seemed to be what tlmgr was running)
doesn't complain but doesn't seem to do anything either.

    Exits with 0 even though parts of the update process failed. In
    particular, not all formats were successfully regenerated. 

I agree it would be best for tlmgr to exit nonzero in this case.
We will try.

    fmtutil-sys --missing

That should do it.

Yes, latexmk is new, yesterday or the day before.

    fmtutil-sys --missing (which seemed to be what tlmgr was running)
    doesn't complain but doesn't seem to do anything either.

Then it doesn't think anything is missing.  You could try running
fmtutil-sys --all to regenerate all of them.

    The ones it couldn't regenerate don't seem to be missing altogether
    but they are the ones dated 22 Aug i.e. older than everything else.

Maybe they didn't need to be regenerated?  But since you say "tlmgr
failed", I guess you saw actual error messages.

Can't say much more without seeing the logs of the failures, which
should be next to the .fmt files (texmf-var/web2c/*/*.{log,fmt}).

I have not updated yet, it is not on main ctan yet but with
--location=ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
it shows the same output both on darwin and x86_64-linux

neither has latexmk symlink (but both have
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/scripts/latexmk/latexmk.pl)

For the sake of completeness...

Now, when I rsync, there is this error:

$ rsync -avz --delete ftp.dante.de::CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 
./texlive

receiving incremental file list
2008/
2008/archive/
rsync: recv_generator: mkdir "/tmp/texlive/2008/archive/...." failed: No 
such file or directory (2)
*** Skipping any contents from this failed directory ***
[...]

This happens with all ftp(s) which are just synced, for example
ftp.dante.de (16/10/2008 21:45), ftp.tex.ac.uk, tug.ctan.org... BUT not
with previous sync of these ftp(s)!

Cheers,
    Angelo.

I don't understand what you're reporting.  Do you still have a local
directory /tmp/texlive?

The directory is still there on tug and dante and (I presume) everywhere
else.  Do a direct ftp and look.

Yes. I saw messages which reported failures to create particular
formats. That is, it tried to regenerate them and could not do so.

Anyway, I used fmtutil-sys --byfmt to regenerate the two formats I saw
error messages for and that seems to have worked fine.

Thanks,

When I do [*]:

rsync -avz --delete ftp.dante.de::CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 \
./texlive

now, only after the servers have synced (for example dante.de a few
minutes ago), there is the reported message error:

rsync: recv_generator: mkdir "/tmp/texlive/2008/archive/...." failed: No
such file or directory (2)
*** Skipping any contents from this failed directory ***

and this happens both if I have a previous tree /tmp/texlive/..., both
if I start from scratch :

mkdir /work
cd /work
rsync -avz...

The message error was absent previously.

After the message, rsync continues to download the needed files.

The question is: since it seems that recently there were problems
(bin-texlive not updated etc.), are we sure that what rsync downloads is
all we need?

My post was only a suggestion to verify if all is working fine now.

No. There was no symlink before and there is no symlink now.

Certainly man tlmgr now works. It failed before because the manual page
had disappeared.

Well, the latexmk symlink is there in the latexmk.ARCH archives on tug.
Maybe it will show up at whatever mirror you are hitting in a day or
two.  Or if you go directly to tug, you should get it.

Your rsync has nothing to do with TL, per se.  I cannot say why it has
started to give that error message on your machine.  Try rsync -vvv.
Try searching around on the net for the error messages.  Nothing, to my
knowledge, has changed on the server end.

We put the files on tug.  You can ftp directly there and see them.
CTAN mirrors them from there, starting with ftp.tex.ac.uk.  You can ftp
directly to CTAN and see them.
You can get them by rsync.
You can get them by ftp.
You can get them by http://mirror.ctan.org.
You can get them however you want, it doesn't matter.

    The question is: since it seems that recently there were problems
    (bin-texlive not updated etc.), are we sure that what rsync downloads is
    all we need?

That question makes no sense to me at all.  Sorry.  The retrieval method
is irrelevant to the content of the packages.  Since you're unsure
whether your rsync is getting all the packages then I suggest logging in
to whatever server by ftp, and do an ls on the server, then do an ls in
your local dir, and compare them.  Pretty basic ...

Hope this helps,
karl

Can you please forward this to the psview author, maybe he can do
something about it.

Message-ID: <1224236550.3271.25.camel@thinktwiceVI.tm2.fh-aachen.de>

Dear TeX-Live-team,
        
first of all let me thank you for your great work, it's fine to have a
working TeX with observance to all current changes without any private
intervention.
        
- The request is concerning the tlmgr: is it possible to define a list
  of error, warning, and informational messages with their meaning at
  the end of the tlmgr help? If I read something like
        
  not reinstalling forcibly removed package texlive-en 
        (collection-documentation-base)
        
  !!!Error: non-existent tlpkg/README
        
  I can accept it, but I would prefer to understand the message: why is
  it so, is there something wrong, do I have to intervene, ...
        
- The report: at my last update I got a message
        
  Should not happen, please report: latexmk.x86_64-linux mentioned, but
  neither new nor forcibly removed
        
  So I do!
        
- Two hints:
  * at the end of tlmgr help there are the following lines:
        
    The respective locations are as follows:
           "tex/generic/config/language.dat" (and
                              "language-local.dat")
           "tex/generic/config/language.def" (and
                              "language-local.def")
           "web2c/fmtutil.cnf" (and "fmtutil-local.cnf")
           "web2c/updmap.cfg" (and "updmap-local.cnf")
                                                 ^^^
    Is that right, or should it read "cfg"?
  * on http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html the line 
        
    Fedora: yum install 'perl(Tk)'
         
    should read as 
        
    Fedora: yum install perl-Tk
        
Kind regards
Jobst

Subject: [tex-live] How to make TexLive 2008 the default TeX system?
Message-ID: <48F8BA27.7080504@gmail.com>

I have installed Tex Live 2008 and Kile 2.0 on my FreeBSD machine. Kile 
works well. But I'm not sure if Kile is using TexLive or things like tetex.

The tex version I use is rather old: kpathsea version 3.5.4. I guess 
Texlive 2008 should includes kpathsea version 3.5.7.

just check the placement of the binaries

which latex

and then make sure that the TL2008 binary path comes first in the search 
path

There are several issues to consider:

1.  you can ensure that the TL2008 programs are used by adjusting the
PATH variable.  This can get a bit tricky if you use GUI tools that you
don't run from a command line.  It is easy to check/adjust the command
line PATH, but may take some work to ensure that GUI gets the same setting.
If you want to set and forget, you should look into the shell startup files
stored in /etc.  If you need to switch back and forth, you should investigate
"environment modules".

2.  if you want to use dvi viewers other than what is available from TL2008,
you may find they have problems finding fonts that aren't installed in the
old TeX.  This might convince you to switch to using pdf(la)tex.

Kile may still invoke latex by specifying its full path, e.g.
/usr/bin/latex. Try to remove /usr/bin/latex. If kile fails, it tries
to use teTEX by specifying the full path.

I have encountered access denied errors when writing to %temp% under
vista also in other contexts. It may be a more general Vista or
Windows problem.

Subject: [tex-live] Bug and patch for updmap.pl
Message-ID: <20081017011347.49F0.2791C192@gmail.com>

Hi,

I find this bug when trying to use ADOBEkb instead of URWkb in updmap.pl.
Basically, current updmap.pl in bin-tetex treats all values as true or false
while LW35 takes URW, URWkb, ADOBE, and ADOBEkb. Such an exception
should be taken care of.

The patch is given as below.
--- updmap.pl	Wed Jul 02 02:18:44 2008
+++ updmap.pl	Fri Oct 17 01:04:00 2008
@@ -467,7 +467,7 @@
       if ($value =~ m/^(true|yes|t|y|1)$/) {

+      elsif ($value =~ m/^(false|no|f|n|0)$/) {
 	$value = 0;
       }
       last;

Although I don't think it makes any difference, my system is Vista win32.

Subject: [tex-live] getnonfreefonts script broken on w32
Message-ID: <48FA5E1A.7000906@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi all,

the getnonfreefonts(-sys).bat script is broken on win32 (WinXP SP3). It
fails with the message below [1]. For this to happen, it is irrelevant
if TL2008 was installed by DVD or through web install. On a Ubuntu VM it
worked as expected.
Unfortunately I could not track this further, as the .bat files are only
wrappers for texlua. But if getnonfreefonts can access wget (i.e. wget
is copied to the bin folder), the script complains about missing Perl.

Best regards,
 Gregor

PS: It's great that the web installer now installs dviout by default -
Many Thanks.

Thanks for the report and the log file.  I'll look into it.

One possible Solution is to copy wget.exe from the folder
"C:\texlive\2008\tlpkg\installer\wget"
to the folder
"C:\texlive\2008\bin\win32"
and it works.
The last line simply means that the wget.exe file couldn't be found in a
path environment, if you put in tin the bin\win32 folder it's in a
searchpath and can be executed. So it will work.

Would also be helpfull to add the following updmap.bat in the bin\win32
trunk. eventually somebody has some improvments to work with but on my
system it is not possible to run updmap.pl out of the program
getnonfreefonts. so here is the content of my updmap.bat and the file as
an attachment.

@echo off
perl ..\..\texmf\scripts\tetex\updmap.pl

this should work on every winsystem. Just add the file updmap.bat to
your bin\win32 folder and it sould work.

Hi Martin,
I already fixed it in the repository.  It will work when the updated
packages are on the mirrors (in a few days).

Please don't replace batch files.  If you want to fix it immediately,
install the new versions of the files:

 http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/tl-w32-texdoc-wrapper.texlua
 http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/tl-w32-wrapper.texlua

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <410-220081001954515484@earthlink.net>

I am trying to install tex-live on a Windows XP machine. I checked my PATH variable to make sure that it was not pointing to any other TEX installations.

I downloaded install-tl.zip and unpacked it such that its contents are in \Program Files\texlive\2008. The file is dated August 12, 2008. When I run the install-tl.bat file I get an error that says "The system cannot find the path specified ..." . The same thing happens if I open a command window, go to this directory, and try to run install-tl. What am I doing wrong or what do I have to do to get this install to work?

Thanks for your help.

Piotr will investigate it. However this seems a problem of Vista, eg.

This is an access denied error when trying to access the user's
_own_ temp directory. I have encountered such odd access denied
errors myself, too; in fact, I just reproduced this error. This
shouldn't require elevated permissions, unless somehow ps_view is
trying to create the directory with unavailable permissions?

Subject: [tex-live]  minor typo in tlmgr output, and broken file links
Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1224693867.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

Last night, I ran tlmgr to update our TeX Live 2008 tree, using our
local CTAN mirror as the default data source.  This morning, I got a
report from a nightly cron job that reported two new broken symlinks
in the newly-updated TeX Live tree:

    ./texlive-2008-08/texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym/mac/README: No such file or directory
    ./texlive-2008-08/texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym/vtex/README: No such file or directory

These README files are broken links to readme.txt and install.txt
respectively.

In attempting to diagnose the problem, I reran tlmgr to update from
the master site

    % tlmgr -location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 update --all

In its output is the line

    hyphen-french: revision in http://mirror.cps.cmich.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 \
    is less then local revision, not updating!

That should be "less than", not "less then".  The offending source
code line is here:

% grep -n 'less th' texlive-2008-08/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
1144:      print "$pkg: revision in $location is less then local revision, not updating!\n";

After the update run, the links are still broken, so is anyone else
seeing the same problem?

I found the missing files in the CTAN tree, and have repaired the
problem locally.

    Do I need to specify our proxy somewhere, 

Well, it's going to depend on how your network is set up.
If you can't wget any url directly, then clearly you have to do
something special.

But perhaps it is just about mirror.ctan.org's redirect being clobbered
by your firewall or whatever, in which case it would work to try a
particular mirror's url directly.  http://www.ctan.org/mirrors has the
list; choose one close to you, then use
  install-tl -location http://whatever/whatever
  
    or is just how things go (overloaded, etc) ?

No, it should work.

    install-tl:cairo> ./install-tl -v -v -v -v

FYI, only -v and -v -v make a difference; we don't plan to ever have
more levels of verbosity.

I can wget any url directly because I have my proxy information
in .wgetrc :)

Where does one specify proxy information for whatever install-tl
is doing?

I've tried 3 other mirrors in the last hour.

unusable location 
ftp://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/CTAN/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb, could not load 
any packages

unusable location http://sunsite.utk.edu/CTAN/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb, could 
not load any packages (tried this twice, same result)

Hi Nelson,
in the repository the readme files are in

  texmf-dist/doc/fonts/marvosym
                 ^^^^^

and there is only one README in the marvosym directory but none in the
{mac,vtex} subdirs.  texlive.tlpdb also looks correct (in the repository).

 > These README files are broken links to readme.txt and install.txt
 > respectively.

There should be no symlinks in the texmf trees any more because
they get lost on Windows.  And according to the output of find -type l
there are indeed no symlinks in texmf trees any more.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Jeff,
TeX Live provides its own copy of wgetrc: tlpkg/installer/wgetrc .

I'm stumped then.

TeX-Live wgetrc now:

Here's my personal one.  Same info as above.

http_proxy = http://gatekeeper.mitre.org:80/

Message-ID: <200810222035.m9MKZcx08071@f7.net>

    I can wget any url directly because I have my proxy information
    in .wgetrc :)

Ah.  As Reinhard said, we specify our own wgetrc since there was no
other rational way to control all the necessary parameters.  Sorry.
Perhaps we should revisit that.

    Where does one specify proxy information for whatever install-tl
    is doing?

A previous user (Torsten Schuetze) reported success with the following
envvar settings, using the *_proxy environment variables that wget
supports:

export http_proxy='http://sct2si1:xxxxxxxxx at 10.4.102.12:8080'
export ftp_proxy='http://sct2si1:xxxxxxxxx at 10.4.102.12:8080'
export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS='-c'

(The TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS overrides our default wget cmdline.)

Let me know if problems.  I'll add something about this to the bugs page
and/or documentation, at least.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Nelson,

        ./texlive-2008-08/texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym/mac/README: No such file or directory
        ./texlive-2008-08/texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym/vtex/README: No such file or directory

Unfortunately we simply have no practical way to go back in time and
figure out what bug caused this.  As Reinhard replied, neither those
symlinks (nor any others) exist in the master tree now, nor in the .lzma
archives for net update.

So Your best bet might be to run
  tlmgr remove marvosym
  tlmgr install marvosym

After first being sure that you are using an up-to-date mirror, such as
(presumably) your own.  Specifically, I suggest running
  tlmgr option location http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

so that tlmgr will just use your own server instead of going through the
multiplexer.  I can't imagine anything good coming of going anywhere
else.  (If you have a generic /local/path/to/your/ctan, that'd be even
faster.)

    hyphen-french: revision in http://mirror.cps.cmich.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 \
    is less then local revision, not updating!

It would seem that the mirror.cps.cmich.edu was not up to date.  I just
fixed the hyphenmin settings in hyphen-french yesterday, so it's not
surprising that some mirrors do not have the change yet.

What effect your manually-installed files will have, I cannot guess.
Probably nothing good, best to remove them again if you try the
remove/install.

Hope this helps somehow,
karl

Well, it's working now, but I am not exactly sure what solved
it.

It was either:

a) the env vars above
b) choosing to no longer use --location url_here

Subject: [tex-live] Oddities with tlmgr generate
Message-ID: <ECF168778A3140939927D6A41DE27068@PCRuben>

Having tried calling 

  tlmgr generate updmap

to no avail on my Windows XP machine (I think the Windows part is relevant),
and digging into the tlmgr code, I think I have found a bug in the kpsewhich
function in TLUtils.pm:

sub kpsewhich {
  my $var = shift;
  my $ret = `kpsewhich -var-value='$var'`;
  chomp ($ret);
  return $ret;
}

should probably read

sub kpsewhich {
  my $var = shift;
  my $ret = `kpsewhich -var-value=$var`;
  chomp ($ret);
  return $ret;
}

Note the missing single quotes. If the single quotes are present, kpsewhich
returns nothing (at least on Windows). 

The generate action is the only part of tlmgr.pl that seems to call the
kpsewhich function; the rest uses `kpsewhich -var-value=XYZ` directly
(without the quotes).

Also, to me the place of the --dest and --localcfg options seems odd: 

  tlmgr generate --dest XYZ --localcfg XYZ updmap

I think 

  tlmgr generate updmap --dest XYZ --localcfg XYZ

looks a lot more obvious (and --help seems to suggest this too).

Hi Jobst,

    - The request is concerning the tlmgr: is it possible to define a list
      of error, warning, and informational messages with their meaning at
      the end of the tlmgr help? 

Well, the messages are meant to be self-explanatory, although admittedly
they are often less than perfect in that regard.  In any case, it's not
practical to try to maintain a different list of what they "really"
mean, since the list of messages is completely open-ended and changes
frequently.  But thanks for the suggestion.

Other messages indicate bugs so there's no way to predict or explain
them in advance.
  
  not reinstalling forcibly removed package texlive-en 
        (collection-documentation-base)

Maybe you selected the option "do not install doc".  No other ideas are
coming to me.

  !!!Error: non-existent tlpkg/README

There was a bug in our original definition of the tlmgr package.
(No doubt there are still bugs in the current definition, too.)

    - The report: at my last update I got a message

      Should not happen, please report: latexmk.x86_64-linux mentioned, but
      neither new nor forcibly removed

      So I do!

Thanks.  Clearly there is some bug in tlmgr regarding this, but so far
it is eluding us.

           "web2c/updmap.cfg" (and "updmap-local.cnf")
                                                ^^^
    Is that right, or should it read "cfg"?

You are right.  Fixed.  Sharp eyes :).

    Fedora: yum install 'perl(Tk)'
    should read as 
    Fedora: yum install perl-Tk

As I recall, it was the Fedora maintainers who gave us the first
incantation.  Maybe the package has changed names.  Anyway, I listed
both now.

Thanks for all the reports.

I wonder if there would be any merit in using
VMS-style error messages, such as :

	%TLMGR-F-NOSUCHPKG, No such package found at requested location

where the part following the ", " would be taken from
a default indexed file (using "NOSUCHPKG" as key), but
with the ability to take an alternative text from
a user-defined file, such that each user could customise
the error messages to his/her taste if he/she so wishes ...

Hi Phil,
I'm pretty sure that it blows up the code while almost nobody makes
use of it.  I also think that it is highly undesirable to allow people
to post customized error messages to mailing lists.

  Reinhard

I cannot reproduce it. However, two pieces of advice:

- try with a new installer from CTAN (systems/texlive/tlnet/2008)
- don't unpack it to the future TeX Live location; the installer
  location is normally unrelated to the target location, and they
  might get in each other's way.

I tried the tlmgr remove and install (using a local svn Master copy), but
it didn't really change anything -- the symbolic links were not deleted
and the missing files were not installed.  The missing files provide
instructions for installing the fonts on particular systems, so perhaps
they are not appropriate for texmf-dist/doc on TeX Live. In that case,
the mac and vtex directories should be removed as well as the dangling
links.

Subject: [tex-live] tlive on arm ??
Message-ID: <490063F2.1080508@mac.com>

I'm toying with a somewhat geeky idea.
My primary use of my laptop (other than travel) is to work on my book at 
a coffee shop.

The other day - online I found a neat little embedded board called the 
Beagle Board and I got a wild hair brained idea -

Build a Beagle Board system, put a fairly minimal linux on it (IE 
embedded CLFS) - just enough to run texlive and emacs. I assume there 
are CF cards big enough for a minimal system plus enough of a texmf 
(full texmf maybe even, but I wouldn't need a full texmf).

Connect to the beagle from the palm using my nice foldout palm keyboard.

The advantage would be I wouldn't have to strap a laptop case to the 
back of my bicycle just to work at the coffee shop, it looks like 
everything would fit inside a fanny pack.

The disadvantage, I'm not sure how fast the thing would be at running 
pdflatex to generate my book, but 99% of the time I would be in the text 
editor anyway - I only occasionally run a compile to check my TeX syntax 
from time to time (and the real purpose is usually to just take a mental 
break from writing).

I understand checking the typesetting on a Palm is not ideal due to the 
small screen, but for draft working copies, it probably is fine.

The biggest hitch - it seems that there are not TLive 2008 binaries for 
Linux ARM. However, it looks like Debian has them, so I could probably 
steal their binaries and just make sure I have the necessary shared 
libraries.

Does this sound absolutely crazy and way too far fetched of a thing to 
try? Has anyone else done something like this?

I have built pdftex from sources on linux arm (running in
qemu) and it works fine. I have tested it on fairly complex
test files. Not sure about the other binaries, since I was
testing pdftex only.

If anyone is a glutton for punishment, I think I finally fixed the
problem that was causing the "should not happen, neither new nor removed"
complaint about the latexmk.ARCH subpackage, and failing to install the
latexmk symlink in the bin dirs.

I updated tlcritical with the current version.  It obviously didn't
happen yesterday, but I hope to push it out to the main tree tonight.

If you want to try it, the usual
  tlmgr -location ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --list
will show the updates and --all instead of --list will do them.

Thanks,
Karl

I have discovered this on Cygwin but perhaps it is general.

Today I have done a new checkout of the Build (not the Master) tree from
SVN. The build finishes with:

====================================================================

without error, but it installs only 265 binaries NOT 294 as it should:
it does not install 29 links (latex -> pdfte.exe etc.).

As you can see in the above there is:

/work/texlive-20081023-source/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/texlinks: line

and this is caused by the fact that in my PATH I have (recently)

'Programmi/MiKTeX 2.7/miktex/bin'
                 ^^^^

i.e. a directory with a space!

If in the '...texlinks -f' command line one adds the "", it works just fine:

Hi,

it seems something is broken with gmdoc and gmutils: the relevant files
end up with only root able to read them.  A simple chmod a+r helps, but
is not needed with another packages, so I guess it's a bug.  (I'm using
i386-linuix binaries, if this is important - guess not, but am including
this info just in case;)).

Thanks in advance

PS. And - in general - thanks a lot for your good work!!!

It wasn't the env vars (see below).  So, for the sake of docs,
I would just mention the bundled wgetrc file's location and
tell people to set proxy info there.  I've no idea why, yesterday,
that alone did not work for me when I tried it with --location,
but I am going to chalk it up to an error with the specific
mirrors I chose or something.

install-tl:cairo> unset http_proxy
install-tl:cairo> unset ftp_proxy

D:Download 
http://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.lzma

Okay, that's all from me on this.

Both packages were updated some days ago, and as I see, they have proper
permissions set. Please update with tlmgr.

    It wasn't the env vars (see below).  

All I can say is that did work for the previous user.

Did you edit the bundled wgetrc to insert the proxy info?
That would/should be equivalent to setting the envvars.

1) I did the --list and it showed the changes to be done; 2) then I  
did the actual update and it showed errors, but proceeded (apparently)  
with the update OK; 3) I did a --list again and it said  
``texlive.infra: revision in ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical is less  
than local revision, not updating'', which I didn't expect. See full  
report below.

Hi Marcin,

    it seems something is broken with gmdoc and gmutils: the relevant files
    end up with only root able to read them.  

To my knowledge, we never explicitly chmod anything.  And we check for
unreadable files in the tree; the gm* packages were never listed.

So I have no idea how they got that way, unless you installed as root
with a umask of 077 or some such. 

Best,
karl

I'm surprised, but ok, then I have no idea how to get rid of them except

    and the missing files were not installed.  

To the best of my knowledge, nothing is missing from the marvosym
package as it exists in tlnet now (last updated Oct 15), except for the
symlinks which exist on CTAN.  We simply remove them for TL.  The
mac/readme.txt and vtex/install.txt files are there.

    they are not appropriate for texmf-dist/doc on TeX Live. 

No, that is not the issue at all.

it's probably something very simple, but since you don't show any part
of your "real" document, it's not possible to say for sure.

however, tex-live is for discussion of the development of ... tex-live.

texhax at tug.org is a mailing list for tex support, otherwise the usenet
group comp.text.tex is a lively source of help.

_do_ create a minimum example:

Hi Robin,

 From the PostScript mentioned in the error messages I can
deduce that the figure1.mps i not generated by MetaPost,
but the "MP to PDF" converter can only handle MP output.

I suggest you rename the file to figure1.eps (and run
epstopdf on it before inclusion in your latex document)

Best wishes,

No, it was generated by MetaPost. Here are the sequence of commands I
used:

mpost --tex=latex figure1.mp
mv figure1.1 figure1.mps

figure1.mp is attached. It in turn was generated by Functional
MetaPost (from which the include file FuncMP is taken).

"epstopdf figure1.eps" outputs this error:

It seems to me that there are about 10 different purported ways to view

FuncMP.mp is the culprit here. It alters MetaPost's output via
explicit special command so that it is no longer acceptable
to the mptopdf converter.

If the document was was 'plain' metapost input, it would actually
have been possible to fix this in texlive 2008 by adding

   prologues:=3;

at the top of the figure1.mp file.

However, FuncMP.mp has redefined (via specials) the PostScript commands
like /fshow etc,. so this won't work. Also, it seems to be altering
the label typesetting so that it uses metafont bitmap (pk) fonts
instead of type1.

My advice is to look into the functional metapost documentation or
ask its author for help and guidelines on how to use the result
images in pdftex (as opposed to dvips/xdvi).

Best wishes,
Taco

The files are there, but under texmf-dist/doc/fonts/.

The dangling links were under texmf-dist/doc/latex, but now the docs
are in texmf-dist/doc/fonts/.   I don't see any mention of
texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym in the current texlive.tlpdb, so I just
zapped the texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym tree.

Yes, thanks.  It's a bug we've fixed in the current test version, but

Hmm, another weird thing to try to understand.

    texlive.infra: revision in ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical is less

You're right, that is puzzling.  I thought I had put the actual rev

I cannot find any other e-mail addresses to report this problem, so I  
send it to you. I wold like to install TeXLive 2008 to Windows XP  
(Chinese traditional).  The installer stops, as shown in the attached

(in traditional Chinese) properly and fails in mkdir.  Any  
suggestion?  Thanks.

Yes. The other change is a clean-up for rare cases and if there is some
supported shell that does not support ${var%pattern} and ${var#pattern}
substitutions, than I guess there's nothing that can be done with that case.

So I think it can be closed when the change accepted upstream hits debian.
Thanks,

Always the trailing dot!

well, since current miktex is 2.7, perhaps he's coming from the future.

Windows sometimes has inexplicable file access problems, so I am not
sure whether folder names really are the problem. I would like to
know whether anybody with a traditional Chinese Windows either did
or did not have this problem.

I am also curious whether short names, such as displayed in the
fourth column of a `dir /x' command, can contain non-ascii
characters in a CJK windows.

Just by way of observation, I occasionally receive
files that end up in directories with Japanese
characters in their names, and most (but not quite
all) Windows programs are unable to access them.

Hi,

The last time I tried, Garamond wasn't working with pdflatex and xelatex 
on a full install of texlive. Has this been fixed?

I was using

\usepackage[urw-garamond]{mathdesign}

And it would complain that some of the files were missing.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update and test
Message-ID: <200810252042.m9PKgds02468@tug.org>

I've updated the tlcritical repo again.  I once again have hopes of
updating the main repo with the new tlmgr et al. tonight.
Testing requested as always.

I noticed that things went badly awry with an installation from the DVD
image, followed by an update of bin-texlive and texlive.infra from the
network location: the tlmgr symlink in bin/PLATFORM disappeared.  I've
attempted to fix that by going back to the previous packaging, where
tlmgr was in bin-texlive.  It is ugly but evidently we cannot change it
until we freeze updates for the 2008 release and start in on 2009.

I also tried to fix the persistent !!!Errors about tlpkg/doc by simply
removing that directory from the new texlive.infra.  The original
tlpkg/doc files (that are present on the DVD) will remain in the
installed hierarchy, but they are harmless.  This was a bug in the
DVD-vintage tlmgr that affected only the texlive.infra package.

It's especially important to try to test the install-from-dvd and then
update-from-net scenario, since the physical DVD's have shipped and will
be in members' hands very soon, if not already.  FWIW, my current theory
is to recommend the following to do that:

  # Install from DVD:
  install-tl 

  # Take future updates from the net:
  tlmgr option location /home/ftp/texlive/tlnet/2008

  # Update just the infrastructure packages, before any other updates:
  tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra

It isn't an error. The licence for URW Garamond is not free so the
fonts cannot be included in TeX Live.

Or so I believe.

I usually write \TeX\ Live, allowing the line break, although I

if you have a preference for that.

I don't like \TeX Live (-> "TeXLive") or other variations without a

Hi,
URW Garamond can be used freely but you are not allowed to take
money for re-distribution.  This is the reason it cannot be part of
TeX Live.

However, it can be installed easily.  Simply run:

   getnonfreefonts garamond

on the command line.  If you want to know which fonts are supported by
getnonfreefonts, run

   getnonfreefonts -l

Of course, internet access is required.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,
another Chinese reported a similar problem with TeX Live 2007 which
had a completely different installer.  In order to avoid the problem
in TeX Live 2008, I sent him a program which converted an environment
variable containing a path into a list of bytes in hexadecimal
notation and asked him to send me the result back.

But the result was discouraging.  I had not been able to find out
which character encoding had been used.  The string contained a path
where one directory contained his name, a single Chinese character.
This character was represented by two bytes while the rest of the
string ("C:\Documents and Settings\...") had been single-byte ASCII
characters.

The problem is that Perl expects forward slashes as directory
separators.  Thus, if a path is entered in one of the menus or it's
taken from an environment variable, backslashes have to be converted
to forward slashes.  The only character encoding I'm aware of which
allows such a conversion without breaking multi-byte characters is
UTF-8.

About a year ago I discussed this issue with Hans Hagen.  He assumed
that, though Windows probably uses UTF-8 for file names internally,
the user interfaces are using character encodings based on national
standards.  This explains the result of our test.  He suggested to
convert file names to short names (Siep mentioned it already too).
Then a path containing East Asian characters will be converted to a
string containing ASCII characters only.  However, this is not always
possible because some programs have to determine how they had been
invoked.  In this case short names are not usable.

I'm sad that I can't provide better news.  I even don't know whether
this problem can be solved at all.  Maybe a Perl/Windows expert from
East Asia could provide more information.

At the moment, all I can recommend is to install TeX Live in a
directory which doesn't contain multi-byte (East Asian) characters in
its path.  It's definitely not a solution because on Vista you'll
certainly are not allowed to install TeX Live in a directory of your
choice.

Is there anybody who is experienced with Perl on Windows in China,
Japan, or Korea who can provide more information?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Are you sure that forward slashes are necessary? I do not have
experience with windows, only with OS/2 which comes almost from the
same world. The system functions recognize both forward slashes and
backslashes as path separators, only some programs complain if forward
slashes are found. It is therefore possible to use both, even the mix
of forward and back slashes in the file name. In Rexx // acts the same
way as -- meaning that this is an end of command line parameters. It
is therefore impossible to put http://www.tug.org as a parameter but
if I invoke Java program from a script written in Rexx, I can specify
http:\\www.tug.org and Java converts the backslashes to forward
slashes automatically. (I tried this both with Java from Innotek and
Java from Golden Code.)

According to the screenshot, this is about creating a directory for
shortcuts, a sub-subdirectory of c:/Documents and Settings/All Users:

...
running post install action for bin-texdoc
TK::Error: Can't mkdir 'C:/Documents and Settings/All Users/####/####/':
Invalid argument.
 TeXLive::TLUtils::mkdirhier at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 507
 TeXLive::TLWinGoo::add_menu_shortcut at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLWinGoo.pm line 897
 TeXLive::TLPostActions::do_install_bin_texdoc at
 tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPostActions.pm line 164

Your comment on problems with slash flipping may be on the mark: the
shortcuts should be created in C:/Documents and Settings/All
Users/Start Menu/Programs/TeX Live 2008, i.e. _one level deeper_,
whereas  Start Menu/Programs should already exist.

_If_ it is true that short names only contain ascii characters, then
that would be a solution, at least in this case.

I don't understand that immediately preceding line;
it appears to conflate local ("home") and remote
("ftp") elements.

Trying to test some stuff, I ran into the following:

My w2k test virtual machine still had MikTeX 2.7 installed. I didn't
bother to uninstall it first.

I installed TL08 from dvd image. In the dosbox, there were messages

running post install action for texlive.infra
running mktexlsr C:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-dist C:/Program Files/texli
ve/2008/texmf
initexmf: This utility does not accept non-option arguments.

How the hell did MikTeX's mktexlsr get invoked instead of the one
from TeX Live, or how did MikTeX's initexmf.exe get invoked by TeX
Live's mktexlsr?

When running with the -v option, the install-time path appears to be
set correctly, except for forward slashes, but forward slashes seem
to be ok for the searchpath.

Is this another permission weirdness? Like w32 thinks TL08 is busy
so it picks instead something from MikTeX, which is still on the
searchpath? Does w32 somehow remember that mktexlsr is initexmf?  (I
am clutching at straws here)

I do remember a previous occasion where an old TL07 installation
myteriously interfered.

w32 doesn't have to remember that mktexlsr is initexmf: there is a
mktexlsr.exe in the miktex bin folder and it is a alias of initexmf.

I installed TL 2008 without problems on WinXP with MiKTeX 2.7, but I
cleaned the environment before starting the installer.   Some users
also set TEX.. variables for MiKTeX (e.g., TEXINPUTS), so it is best to
scan the environment for any mention of TEX or miktex.  After
TL is installed, you can restore miktex settings and create a
.cmd files to load a command-line environment for running
either package.   So far both MikTeX and TL have been working for
basic LaTeX tasks.

I doubt forward slashes will work for all cases -- some Win32 programs
seem to do their own massaging of the PATH and may be confused.

Life is too short to work out all the foibles of WIn32, but I've installed
TL2008 on systems with existing TL2007 and MiKTeX 2.7 after removing
all traces of the existing packages from the environment.   In addition to
the PATH, check for things like PERL library paths and TEXINPUTS.

Hi Mohamed, 
this problem had been fixed last weekend.

Please run tlmgr in order to update your TL installation.

Is the following correct?
 	My TL tree contains two copies of the readme for the URW Base
 	35 fonts: .../texmf-dist/doc/fonts/antiqua/README.base35 and
 	.../texmf-dist/doc/fonts/grotesq/README.base35. But neither
 	antiqua nor grotesq are part of urw-base35 according to either
 	CTAN or the README.base35 itself.
It seems unnecessarily confusing, anyway, and it is not obvious where
to look for documentation for the fonts which are part of urw-base35.

Thanks,

Oops, this is a mistake. Thanks for reporting that. It should be (as on 
CTAN):
doc/fonts/antiqua/readme.antiqua
doc/fonts/antiqua/uaq.txt

doc/fonts/grotesq/readme.grotesq
doc/fonts/rotesq/ugq.txt

We don't know where to put README.base32 because every font from that 
bundle is an individual package on TL.

Thanks,

Yes. But they're not part of urw-base35 so README.base35 shouldn't be
in their doc directories. It should be e.g. readme.antiqua and
antiqua.txt (or uaq.txt as it seems to be on CTAN).

Hi Wolfgang,
I just uploaded a new version of getnonfreefonts to the TL svn
repository which supports brace expansion (rev. 11070).  It will be
available from the CTAN mirrors in a few days.

If you are impatient, you can download it from:

   http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/getnonfreefonts.pl

It uses the kpsewhich option --expand-path instead of --expand-var and
uses the first element found in the list.  Running getnonfreefonts
with the --debug option now results in:

$ getnonfreefonts --debug
...
DEBUG: TEXMFHOME: '/home/reinhard/texmf'.
DEBUG: TEXMFHOME='/home/reinhard/texmf'.
DEBUG: sys=false.
DEBUG: INSTALLROOT='/home/reinhard/texmf'.
...

$ getnonfreefonts-sys --debug
...
DEBUG: TEXMFLOCAL: '/usr/local/texlive/2008/../texmf-private'.
DEBUG: TEXMFLOCAL: '/usr/local/texlive/2008/../texmf-local'.
DEBUG: TEXMFLOCAL='/usr/local/texlive/2008/../texmf-private'.
DEBUG: sys=true.
DEBUG: INSTALLROOT='/usr/local/texlive/2008/../texmf-private'.
...

I also tested it with:

TEXMFLOCAL={$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-private//,$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local//}

Note the // after texmf-* .  With the --debug option activated I got a
lot of output but finally I always got:

DEBUG: INSTALLROOT='/usr/local/texlive/2008/../texmf-private'.

Leading !! are also allowed.

If something doesn't work as expected, please let me know as soon as
possible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

	texdoc tlmgr 

PLEASE and reading the pdf popping up. This command sets the default
installation source.

But it is anyway best not to use that, but what I wrote. Karl copied
just his line as he is using it on TUG.

But they are there:

  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/antiqua/uaqr8ac.pfb
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/grotesq/ugqb8a.pfb

Documentation:

  texmf-dist/doc/fonts/antiqua/antiqua.txt

So, I issued those command on my vista 64bit machine and now.

E:/Fonts: failed to write cache
...
E:/Fonts/Adobe Garamond Pro: caching, new cache contents: 6 fonts, 0 dirs
E:/Fonts/Adobe Garamond Pro: failed to write cache
FcDirCacheValid(dir) returned FcFalse.
...

fails even after I change C:\Program Files 
(x86)\texlive\2008\texmf-var\fonts\conf\fonts.conf

to include

<dir>E:/Fonts</dir>
<cachedir>c:/etc/fccache</cachedir>

I only included the latter to see if it would fail if I included the 
cache dir.


 >fc-cache -v -r -f

fails with the same thing


Please help.

As Norbert says, I mistyped it.  Should have been
tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

This morning I wrote some instructions at
http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html (pointed to from acquire.html and
bugs.html) about how to upgrade tlmgr.

I've got it working. I made a copy of each dir that it failed on, then 
pointed the fonts.conf to it, e.g.,

<dir>C:/Program Files 
(x86)/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype-copy</dir>
<dir>C:/Program Files 
(x86)/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype-copy</dir>


What an absurd workaround!

Hello,

I am trying to install TexLive-2008 on Zenwalk Snapshot. When I give the

./install-tl

I get the following error message:

TeXLive/TLUtils.pm did not return a true value at ./install-tl line 50.

What should I do?

Thanks for your help,

Hi Clea,

    tlmgr update --all ...
    Exits with 0 even though parts of the update process failed. In
    particular, not all formats were successfully regenerated.

I think I've made changes so that tlmgr will exit 1 when any of the
various subprograms it calls at the end (fmtutil, updmap, mktexlsr)
fail.

Thanks for the suggestion.

    I am trying to install TexLive-2008 on Zenwalk Snapshot. 

I've never heard of Zenwalk Snapshot, but it seems it has some
early/development version of the code.  I suggest downloading the
current install-tl from
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/ and starting with
that.

Best,

Good question.  I don't know anything about jadetex.  Offhand, I'd guess
they are related to my recently removing packages that require nonfree
fonts.  If you or anyone else wants to track it down and propose a
patch, feel free.  I'm just glad they are only warnings.

If you have a fast network connection, just unpack the network installer
and use the current already updated tlnet verson, which will be
automatically used.

If you want to use the new installer with the DVD packages, then use
	install-tl -location /path/to/your/mouted/dvd

Hi Norbert,

Thanks for your reply. But this did not work. This is what I did:

./install-tl -location /media/TexLive2008/

Then, I got this message:

Use of uninitialized value $location in concatenation (.) or string at
./install-tl line 335.
Use of uninitialized value $location in concatenation (.) or string at
./install-tl line 335.
Cannot find installation source at /media/TexLive2008/! at
./install-tl line 342.

After this I tried:

./install-tl -location /media/TexLive2008/tlpkg

After this, I got again the message:

Use of uninitialized value $location in concatenation (.) or string at
./install-tl line 335.
Use of uninitialized value $location in concatenation (.) or string at
./install-tl line 335.
Cannot find installation source at /media/TexLive2008/tlpkg! at
./install-tl line 342.

I think I cannot used install-tl script of network installer to
install from the ISO image which has been burnt on a DVD. Am I right?

Subject: [tex-live] minor problems with install-tl
Message-ID: <20081028.092507.10571427.wl@gnu.org>


During a train ride (with a slow internet connection which often
stalled because the mobile connection was changed again and again) I
tried to start `install-tl -gui' on a friend's GNU/Linux laptop.  Here
my observations.  Note that I downloaded install-tl two days ago from
tug.org.

  . The script searched for a CTAN host and downloaded the database
    before anything else.  This is bad, since later on it continued
    with text-only mode because perl-tk wasn't installed.  Any reason
    why the availability of perl-tk can't be checked immediately after
    the start?

  . Neither CTAN host searching nor downloading the database gets
    announced in advance.  With a bad connection it appears as if the
    program hangs.  So please tell the user in advance what the script
    is doing.

  . Please add a status bar which shows how much of the database has
    been downloaded.  Ideally, with -gui, this should already happen
    with a small GUI window.

Does /media/TeLive2008 exist????

Should it be /media/TeXLive2008? (Mind the X instead of x)

No, you can. The installer is always the same.

The problem could be that abs_path on your platform does not work. What
are you working on?

Can you please replace tyour install-tl script with the attached version
and show me the first view lines of output?

Thanks

=head1 NAME

install-tl - the TeX Live Cross Platform Installer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

install-tl [OPTION]...

install-tl.bat [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The TeX Live installer works across all supported platforms and allows
to install TeX Live from various media, including the network.

Post-installation configuration, packages updates, and more, are now
available through B<tlmgr>(1), the TeX Live Manager
(L<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>).

The most up-to-date version of this documentation is on the Internet at
L<http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-gui>

If possible, use the GUI installer (default on Windows).  This requires
the Perl/Tk module (L<http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk>; if
Perl/Tk is not available, installation continues in text mode.

=item B<-no-gui>

Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows).

=item B<-lang> I<2-letter lang code>

(only for GUI installer) If possible, start the installer translated into
the language specified by the 2-letter language code. Currently supported
languages: English (en, default), German (de), French (fr), Dutch (nl),
Polish (pl) and Slovenian (sl).

=item B<-location> I<url|path>

Provide an installation source, either a local directory via
C</path/to/directory> or a C<file:/> url, or a network location via
a C<http://> or C<ftp://> url.

If the location is local, the installation type (compressed or live) is
automatically determined, by checking for the presence of a
C<archive> directory relative to the root.  Compressed is
preferred if both are available, since it is faster.  Here's an example
of using a local directory:

  -location /local/TL/repository/copy

If the location is on the network, trailing C</> characters and/or
trailing C</tlpkg> and C</archive> components are ignored.  For example,
you could choose a particular CTAN mirror with something like:

  -location http://ctan.example.org/tex-archive/texlive/tlnet/2008

Of course a proper hostname and its particular top-level CTAN path
have to be specified.  (The list of CTAN mirrors is maintained at
L<http://ctan.org/mirrors>.)

The default is to pick a mirror automatically, using
L<http://mirror.ctan.org>; the chosen mirror is used for the entire
download.  (See L<http://ctan.org> for more about the CTAN mirror
services.)

=item B<-no-cls>

(only for text mode installer) do not clear the screen when entering
a new menu (for debugging purposes).

=item B<-non-admin>

For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for all users.

=item B<-portable>

Start the installer for portable use---but use the C<tl-portable>
scripts instead of this option.  See below for details.

=item B<-print-arch>

Print the detected arch-os combination and exit.

=item B<-profile> I<profile>

Load the I<profile> file for repeated installations on different systems.
A I<profile> contains the values of all necessary variable for the
installation. After normal installation has finished a profile for that
exact installation is written into DEST/tlpkg/texlive.profile. That file
can be used to do the exact same installation on a different computer.

You can also hand-craft such a profile starting from a generated one
by changing some values. Normally a profile has to contain the value 1 for
each collection that should be installed, even if the scheme is specified.
That follows from the logic of the installer that you first select a scheme
and then can change the actual collections being installed.

There is one exception to this: If the profile contains a variable for
B<selected_scheme> and I<no> collection variable is defined in the
profile, then the collections which the specified scheme requires are
installed.  Thus, a simple line C<selected_scheme scheme-medium>
together with the definitions of the paths (C<TEXDIR>, C<TEXDIRW>,
C<TEXMFHOME>, C<TEXMFLOCAL>, C<TEXMFSYSCONFIG>, C<TEXMFSYSVAR>) suffices
to install the medium scheme with all default options.

=item B<-scheme> I<scheme>

Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX Live; the
default is to use the C<full> scheme, which includes everything.  This
option overrides that default.  You can change the scheme again before
the actual installation with the usual menu.  The I<scheme> argument may
optionally have a prefix C<scheme->.  The list of supported scheme names
depends on what your installation location provides; see the interactive
menu list.

=item B<-q>

Omit normal informational messages.

=item B<-v>

Include debugging messages; repeat for maximum debugging, as in C<-v
-v>.  (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)

=item B<-logfile> I<file>

Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings) to I<file>,
in addition to standard output or standard error.

If this option is not given, the installer will create a log file
in the root of the writable installation tree,
for example, C</usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log> for the I<YYYY>
release.

=item B<--help>, B<-help>, B<-?>

Display this help and exit.

=item B<--version>, B<-version>

Output version information and exit.

=back

As usual, all options can be specified with either C<-> or C<-->, and
arguments can be be separated from their options by either a space or C<=>.

=head1 PORTABLE USE

The TeX Live root directory contains a shell script C<tl-portable.sh>
and a DOS batch file C<tl-portable.bat> which start up a new shell and
command prompt in which TeX Live can be run with minimal impact on the
host system. These files start up C<install-tl> with the
C<-portable> option for some minimal preparation. Don't use this option
directly; it makes very specific assumptions about its environment.

=head1 AUTHORS AND COPYRIGHT

There is absolutely *no* relation between these two things. Even if you
immediately go into text mode it downloads the tlpdb first. 

I don't see your problem?
- Is it that the immediate downloading, or
- is it the switch from gui to text mode
?

Well, if you want to install, then this database is needed, otherwise
the installer *simply* cannot proceed, because all the information on
what is available etc is in the database. There is *no* information
whatsoever stored in the installer itself.

Aehmm, why? The installer already tries first all possible to avoid a
network connection. It checks for presence of the CD content (in
archive/), then it checks for uncompressed files, and only if everything
local did not succeed, it continues with the network installation.

Yes, that is documented and explained, I don't see any need to announce
that.

Impossible. Downloading is down by wget, so we cannot easily provide a
statusbar.

Ok, on Unix we could, forking another thread (problematic with Perl/Tk
because it is not completely thread safe) and permanently reading the
file size, but still we don't know the final file size. Aehmmmm....

So sorry, no. Unless someone brave steps forward and rewrites the
installer.

Best wishes

If you are worried more about the internet than the train connections,
consider yourself lucky.  Just two days ago, I spent 45 minutes in the
middle of nowhere ("Hohenbudberg Bayerwerke" with no soul in sight on
Sunday) because the previous station had been announced after the fact,
and the train in the other direction was half an hour late.  Guess what
that did for the connection.  On the plus side, nobody was there to
complain about me cussing at the speaker announcements (probably from
some stations off) and blaring out on accordion and voice at full tilt.
Actually, quite better practice climate than the jam I had been at
before (a moldy-smelling bunker).

Anyway, if it the internet that is slow and often stalled instead of the
train, you are well off.  Quite a few newer trains in Germany have
mobile repeaters.  I'd prefer if they were on time instead.

Arthur's consciousness approached his body as from a great
distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in
there. Slowly, nervously, it entered and settled down into
its accustomed position.
Arthur sat up.
`Where am I?' he said.
`Lord's Cricket Ground,' said Ford.
`Fine,' said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out
again for a quick breather. His body flopped back on the
grass.

ha!  at least italy seems (vaguely) to believe in trains.  we have an
insane govt which seems to believe that flying is better than train
travel, and that ticket prices should be used to regulate crowding on
trains.

(of course, with the credit crunch, soon no-one will be able to borrow
enough to go by train at these prices, which will solve the
overcrowding.)

Message-ID: <4906FB81.5050301@imf.au.dk>

the dlfltxb bundle contains a file

dlfltxbmarkup-sample.cfg

it is currently placed inside

dlfltxb.doc.tar.lzma

and thus ends up in

texmf-dist/doc/latex/dlfltxb/dlfltxbmarkup-sample.cfg

it should be moved to

dlfltxb.tar.lzma

and placed in

texmf-dist/tex/latex/dlfltxb/

The Italian govt instead regulates by local trains which are just plain
broken. The high speed connections IC type are good and clean, the local
trains a pain. But anyway, I don't mind ;-)

Whom do you tell, Cambridge, Cardiff, I have been in several places in
the last month, and going there and back in the OffPeak time is the only
way to get decent prizes. Considering that for OffPeak from Cardiff you
need to leave at around 5, this *is* a pain.

Anyway, still I love trains much more than planes, esp because I am
close to 2m tall, which makes me fit into these chairs quite
uncomfortably.

Howdy,

Using tlmgr

tlmgr revision 11079 (2008-10-27 23:11:15 +0100)
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008
texlive-20080903

I'm still getting the message

tlmgr: should not happen, please report: latexmk.universal-darwin  
mentioned, but neither new nor forcibly removed

I thought that went away. Also, should there be a latexmk symbolic  
link to the latexmk.pl script in the /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/ 
universal.darwin/ directory? I've always assumed it should be there  
but isn't and that is what the message is all about.

Good Luck,

I would say that most cfg files are meant to be included by TeX.

dlfltxbmarkup.sty can load this file if requested (I use it for my LaTeX 
book, and other people can use it for inspiration)

it should never have been in the doc tree (I never made a tree for it 
myself)

Would you ?  Given the relative minority interest in
TeX (compared to more mainstream software), and the
fairly obvious use of "cfg" as a TLA for "configuration",
I would have expected that the vast majority of ".cfg"
files have nothing to do with TeX at all !

I have been, several times. The first time about 18 years ago. It is
fun, huge fun. Especially when you get out your stove in the compartment
and make a soup.

Any more stories needed, train rides in Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia,
Thailand, Malaysia, ...

Then please don't call it 
	....-sample.cfg
That suggests that this is only to be used as an example and thus not be
installed into the runfile tree, but into the doc hierachy.

I seriously remark NOT to use that stupid (sorry) names with -sample in
actual sty files. Either load dlfltxbmarkup.cfg and ship this file, or
ship a sample file and tell the users in the README they have to create
a file without -sample.

Thanks.

We cannot read each and every installation instructions. Something
containing "sample" in the name is treated as what it says it is, a
sample.

No, in Germany (from Koblenz to Dortmund).  I've used a data card from
a mobile phone company, not the WLAN of an ICE train.

The problem is that the warning messages w.r.t. to Perl-Tk should
*immediately* appear after starting the script, before doing anything
else.  IMHO, it's always a good idea to check the prerequisites, then
proceed.  I've specifically asked for the GUI on the command line, and
the script should response to that request as soon as possible.

Of course.  You've apparently completely misunderstood what I'm
complaining about.

If I start with -gui, I would like that a windows pops up immediately
(similar to, say, Emacs), and all future messages are echoed in that
window.  It would be fully sufficient to have something like this:

  > ./install-tl -gui

  <a window pops up>
  Searching CD...
  not found
  Searching uncompressed files...
  not found
  Searching host in internet...
  found `foobar'

  Downloading TeXLive repository database (this may take some time)...
  Done.

  ...

IMHO such messages are essential; they should be emitted even if I
don't activate a debug switch (at least for -gui).

Ok, then try to go from Naoussa to Saloniki. Felt like riding the  
cable cars in San Francisco. But then again, that was in 2004 and  
maybe railways change quicker in Greece than they used to.

Anyway, interesting to share a few experiences that are not related  
to tlmgr-problems on this list. ;-)

Ah. That's rather different !  So within that universe
of discourse, and if we assume (reasonably enough, IMHO)
that ".cfg" files are meant to be read and processed by
something (as opposed to read and understood by someone)
then I would support Lars' analysis, on the basis that
there are very few programs (qua programs) within TeX Live,
and by far the most used is the TeX engine itself.

I agree, but also agree with Norbert's remark on the -sample part.

Generally speaking, files named -sample are documentation, and cfg files
are runtime files. Mixing both in one single file name can only lead to
confusion (that's why I asked twice if it is actually a runtime file).

Done Vietnam :-)  Ha Noi to Sa Pa, about nine hours
in a sleeper.  Seemed fine at the time, but not sure
I would do it without a native speaker in the party !
But for those of a sensitive disposition (such as myself),
get clear of Sa Pa station as soon as you can.  Pigs
are sold nearby, by weight, weighed alive by having their
legs trussed and then hung upside down from a wooden pole.
Their squealing made me feel very sick, and I had to get
out of there as quickly as possible.

My version of "wget" shows a status bar or something else during a download:

Maybe redirecting this piece of information would be sufficient.

As do I, though I had to read it twice before
I was sure I agreed.  Now I am sure.

OK, but would you also agree with Norbert's pronouncement
"We cannot read each and every installation instruction." ?
That seems very unfair when the TeX Live team have themselves
been known to berate users for not reading the TeX Live
installer's instructions ...

Yep. Not that we don't want to, but we need to save time. When I can
reasonnably assume I understand how a package should be installed
without reading instructions, I proceed. I read instructions only when I
don't manage to figure out things myself. As we most probably all do.

Well, I (usually) try to read instructions before complaining on a
mailing list :-) (But there are exceptions, of course.)

I meant

Ok, but since we continue either way in text mode we have to load the
tlpdb in any case ... right?

I see that point and will try to find a solution for that. It is not
that trivial since the install-tl script can be used for many other
things, too.

Yes, probably. So what you want is that if you ask 
	install-tl -gui
and the gui cannot be loaded, then
	1) give a warning message that we drop into text mode
	2) then start loading the tlpdb
this way you could cancel the loading and first reinstall missing 
perl-tk, and then restart, without the need to download the tlpdb two
times, the first time completely useless.

Did I got it right this time?

Uhhh, maybe, but the messages would scroll by *very* fast.

I will see if I can add a temporary window that pops up that informs
users that the tlpdb is being loaded and that it might take some time.

In tlmgr we have that, but in install-tl I have to see if it fits in.

I will try.

Doesn't help. Redirecting means threads for reading/writing, it is plan
simply complicated, and will anyway not work under any circumstances on
Windows (there we cannot do fork at all in perl).

Huuu ... strange that file should have been installed with the package
	bin-kpathsea
and that should be installed in any case. Right? Does it appear in the

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

Of course.  I just ask you to change the order.

Hmm, -gui always starts up the GUI, doesn't it?  Then you always have
to check for perl-tk, right?

Perhaps with a

Exactly.  BTW, are there plans to introduce a caching mechanism, for
example, having an MD5 checksum of the tlpdb (in a separate file) to
check whether it should be downloaded again?

No, there are some cmd line arguments that do not support -gui.

Example:
you start with -gui mode but the installation breaks down out of a bug.
Then another run of install-tl -gui will realize that installation has
been aborted and will try to restart, but that will not be asked in GUI
but text mode. Currently only the interactive questions are done in GUI.
(Nothing is perfect)

Ok, noted.

No, because the tlpdb is not saved in an reliable place, so we might not
be sure.

One could think of an option like:
	install-tl --tlpdb /path/to/old/tlpdb
but the point is that we don't even *save* the tlpdb from the network,
but read it from there (wget | read loop)

The messages "Testing CD" "Testing DVD" will be shown only for a small
percentage, but ok, if they stay people are informed. As said, i will
think about it.

Hmm, my idea was rather a simple log window which you can scroll up
later on if necessary (perhaps hidden by default, and you have to
press a `more information' button to see it completely).

[ Sanjoy, that worked, thanks ]

Sorry for so many questions.  I am a sysadmin trying
to reproduce an old TeX/LaTeX install with the modern
tex-live for our users.  I've not used TeX/LaTeX as a
user in about 10 years myself.

Install destination was /afs/rcf/apps/tex-live

I then dropped all of our older site-specific stuff in
/afs/rcf/apps/tex-live/texmf-local because that seemed
like the right place:

Looks to me as if you need to regenerate
the LS-R file; I imagine that this is
an option to TLMGR.  In the Windows GUI
interface, it appears under Configuration /
Re-initialise file database, but unfortunately
"TLMGR -Help" didn't disclose how it
might be accomplished at command level.

Nope.

Just did at your suggestion.  That solved the problem.

The epsdice package in TL2008 can't find its dice.{eps,pdf} files.  For
example, the LaTeX file

     \documentclass{minimal}
     \usepackage{epsdice}
     \begin{document}
     \epsdice{6}
     \end{document}

dies with

The files are actually installed under texmf-dist/doc/latex/epsdice/, but
aren't found there by latex:

     $ kpsewhich -progname=latex dice.eps

Well, this is another (very rare) exception when .eps (or .pdf) should be 
placed in TEXINPUTS area. Such files can be found in doc/... or 
(sometimes) in source/, but ok, will do move. 
Thanks for reporting that.

I ran into that problem installing on sparc solaris.  I worked around it
by tricking install-tl to use /usr/sfw/bin/gtar (GNU tar) instead of
Sun's tar.  First, I symlinked ~/bin/gtar to /usr/sfw/bin/gtar.  Then I
ran install-tl as follows (in bash notation):

  PATH=~/bin:$PATH ./install-tl

I hope that fixes it for you too.

FWIW, the sources have not meaningfully changed since making the ISO images.

Unfortunately, I have no clue about the actual problem.  Sorry.

Yes, that could be the problem. If your system does not support all the
tar options we use from GNU tar there could be a problem.

Please try what Sanjoy suggested, and thanks Sonjoy for reminding us.

It seems you have a newer version of tlmgr, but an older version of the
tlpkg/TeXLive/*.pm files.  I can't say how it came about.

You could try this:
tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra

But probably you will get the same error.  In which case my suggestion
is to go to
ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl/tlpkg/TeXLive/
and explicitly download the *.pm files and manually put them into
tlpkg/tlpkg/TeXLive.

After that, the tlmgr update command will hopefully run ok, to get
things back in a reasonable state.

Sorry.  Maybe someone else has a better idea.

Does that file exist?  Can you read it?  Is it text all the way to the
end?  Maybe the DVD itself is corrupted somehow?  Not likely, but
possible.

Did you burn the iso image that we distribute, or something else?

Karl's advice is sound.  I encountered the same problem a few days ago
after updating from a local svn/Master mirror.  The suggested fix
worked for me then.

Strange... it looks as if the Freetype header hasn't been included, so  
FT_Library is not defined as a type, and therefore it is taken as a  
variable (implicit int) declaration. But XeTeX_ext.c definitely has
   #include <ft2build.h>
   #include FT_FREETYPE_H
which should have provided the definition of FT_Library.

So I have no idea why it's failing. What version of gcc is on that  
system -- is it particularly old or bleeding-edge new?

Are there any warnings, etc, issued during the configure process? Does  
the Freetype library build cleanly?

You could try 

	http://www.logic.at/people/preining/texlive/update-texlive-11048.run

which is a self extracting (created using makeself.sh) script that
copies all the texlive.infra and bin-texlive files to your installation.

It is NOT failsafe, it will search for
	kpsewhich -var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT
and then copy to that place all the files.

If someone wants to try it, it is here. I will do some testing etc soon.

Best wishes

Problem found: /usr/pkg/include contains FreeType 1.5 headers and is
specified on the $(CC) command as a -I directory before $(FTFLAGS)
(which is -I../../../texk/web2c/../../libs/freetype2/include above).
Not sure how to fix this correctly (besides removing the FT 1.5 headers
from /usr/pkg/include and falling back to those shipped with TL...).

It might be an idea to mention that in order for tlmgr to work properly 
then perldoc needs to be installed.

for some reason my PCLinuxOS had perl but no perldoc, and then when I 
issued

tlmgr help

it would just list the tlmgr script itself, not the POD text.

After installing perldoc, everything went fine again.

Just in case it might help someone.

BTW: great job on the new TL infrastructure, makes updating the LaTeX 
dist so much easier.

BTW2: what happens on multi user systems if a user issues tlmgr? Would 
it be safer if that command only be available for the superuser?

Well, what you describe is not untypical at markets in this region.
If you want to have a fresh chicken, why not to buy one which is still
alive?  It's always unpleasent to see how animals are tortured.  But
if you buy a piece of meat in a European super market you don't know
how this piece of meat had been produced.  And you ***definitely***
don't want to know it.  Sadly, it is by far more cruel than what
you've seen in Vietnam.  No camera team is allowed to enter one of
these slaughterhouses behind barbed wire fences for a very good
reason.

I had been in Sa Pa in summer 2004.  I took the night train from Ha
Noi to Lao Cai and expected an adventure, especially because I had no
idea how to get from Lao Cai to Sa Pa.  But I had been quite
astonished: A quite modern, comfortable, silent, very clean train with
air condition, excellent service (everybody got a blanket and a bottle
of water), the train was in schedule, and so on.

In Lao Cai people sold bus tickets to Sa Pa straight on the platform.
The bus drivers had been waiting in front of the station in order to
direct people to the right bus and in Sa Pa the bus stopped in front
of each hotel and the driver announced prizes for accommodation for
each hotel.

I never encountered a public transportation system which is so
brilliantly organized anywhere else in the world.

In contrast, I'll never forget the EuroTeX 2005 horror trip.  The
train from Pont-a-Mousson to Metz had been a few minutes late, hence I
missed the train to Frankfurt.  The next train arrived in Frankfurt
after midnight.  In Frankfurt the waiting room was closed overnight,
it had been extremely cold and windy, and I had to wait abt. 5 hours
in the cold for the next train to Hannover.  I had been pissed off.
I'll never forget this torture.

And there is one thing which describes German mentality completely:
The train from Metz to Frankfurt stopped in Saarbr?cken for 45
minutes.  The reason: One of the passengers had no ticket and the
police had to "solve" this "problem".  If there are 1000 people in a
train and one of them has no ticket, it's perfectly ok that 999 of
them have to accept the 45 minute delay because it's absolutely
unthinkable that someone who didn't pay for the trip is allowed to
reach his destination.

 > Norbert Preining wrote:

Norbert, you don't have to go so far away.  If you like adventures,
come to Germany and enjoy the German railway system.  Unfortunately
it's extremely expensive.

Hmm, ok, Karl, any idea where?

Depending on who has installed the system. The point is that we don't
have to care, since user a cannot update/remove/install anything if root
has done that, due to the permissions.

But he still can use it to search for file, packages, etc. So it is
useful for user, too.

Not for packages operations. For maintenance operations such as
regenerating the formats and map files tlmgr calls ftmutil-sys and
updmap-sys so no problem here either.

I'm wondering what we are talking about.  Of course, providing
progress bars for each package is nearly impossible and certainly not
desired. 

But isn't it quite helpful if the output of wget isn't suppressed
deliberately when the database is downloaded?   wget provides a status
bar already, no need for threads or other strange things.

 > on Windows (there we cannot do fork at all in perl).

Recent versions of Perl allow you to fork on Windows.  It's emulated
somehow. But it's not very helpful because everything else is broken. 
What is fork() good for if exec() doesn't work?

  Reinhard

You are extremely exaggerating.  I use the German trails almost daily
for longer trips, and it works very well most of the time.  The
greatest problems are `Langsamfahrstrecken' (paths which have to be
passed in a slow tempo) which get more and more during the year,
causing delays over delays.  Reason is that the German railway
management didn't take care of the railway network for many, many
years, and now fixes are overdue, and before this happens the
governmental railway department limits the tempo for security reasons.
As soon as the new time table appears (in December and June), most of
those delays disappear because the new schedule handles those
Langsamfahrstrecken appropriately.

Really?  My GNU/Linux SuSE distribution does exactly that during
installation and update, and it works very well and gives the user a

Hmm.  Almost all header files of FreeType?2 contain the following code
to abort if FreeType?1 has been loaded previously:

  #ifdef FREETYPE_H
  #error "freetype.h of FreeType 1 has been loaded!"
  #error "Please fix the directory search order for header files"
  #error "so that freetype.h of FreeType 2 is found first."
  #endif

I wonder why you haven't seen this message.

I tried to do my daily update, it ended with the error message

"kpsewhich" is not exported by the TeXLive::TLUtils module
Can't continue after import errors
at /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr line 68

I get the same message after a

I followed Karl's advice and nothing changed. What can I do now?

whereas, during the period when we had a "commercial" company running
the uk's rail tracks, we had one terrible crash which came because the
track hadn't been inspected properly (if at all).  my wife and i set off
up north, a few days later, and the train ran like a slug on
tranquillisers, stopped short of our destination[*].  that was the
beginning of the end for commerce in that area, and we now have a
marginally less incompetent national enterprise doing the job.

after tug '96 at dubna, sebastian and i went back to moscow by train,
which was interesting.  the track was obviously in a terrible state, and
the train didn't go fast at any time.  but there was more leg-room in
the carriage than i've experienced in any other transport: stretched
full out in opposite seats, our feet didn't touch, and while neither of
us is 2m tall, we're not midgets either.

i go for trains, nowadays, because no airline i could afford would offer
seats that i would likely survive (i've had two deep thromboses, and a
pulmonary embolism, which apparently predisposes me to such a death.  i
might manage eurotex 09, since i can go there by train/boat/train
(tickets sold by the shipping company).  (i could have done tug this
year, that way, but i was too ill at the time.)

Aehmm, is that with the officially distributed DVD, or did you burn it
yourself.

The only thing you can do now is:
- make a directory on your harddisk
- copy everything from the DVD *DULY* noting which files could not be
  copied due to I/O errors
- tells us and I will send you the respective files
- put them in place of the missing ones
- install from there, or burn a new DVD.

The installer is in C, and it works only on linux. While our installer
has to work on about 10+ different combinations of architectures and
operating systems.

And it is written in Perl with Tk.

And, I am not a programmer. Give me a decent Perl and Perl/Tk programmer
and we can do better, I am mathematician.

Did you install a new

I just installed Ubuntu 8.10 on a couple systems.   The standard configuration

For years I've been making the texlive tree owned by a user who is the TL
administrator.  tlmgr (together with tools like updmap and fmtutil)
are not things
that should ever be run as "root".   I would also not want to have two users
running tlmgr at the same time, so if that is a concern you might want to create
a special TL admin account where one user (the TL admin) does the updating.

It is not about running it is a root. It is only about write permissions
to TEXMFSYSVAR and TEXMFSYSCONFIG. That is all. That makes the
difference between updmap-sys and updmap.

And yes, it is a good idea to have a designated TL user ...

I don't know. It's definitely not output, thus I guess the FreeType 2
headers are not read at all because a freetype/freetype.h has already
been found.

While trying to fix this (without having much knowledge of autoconf et
al.) I noticed that if I don't explicitly set CPPFLAGS when calling TL's
Build script, autoconf tests checking for the usability of a header file
fail while the test for the presence of the same file succeeds; e.g. gd.h:

  checking gd.h usability... no
  checking gd.h presence... yes
  configure: WARNING: gd.h: present but cannot be compiled
  configure: WARNING: gd.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?
  configure: WARNING: gd.h: see the Autoconf documentation
  configure: WARNING: gd.h:     section "Present But Cannot Be Compiled"
  configure: WARNING: gd.h: proceeding with the preprocessor's result
  configure: WARNING: gd.h: in the future, the compiler will take precedence
  checking for gd.h... yes

config.log reveals:

  configure:9134: checking gd.h usability
  configure:9151: gcc -c -g -O2  conftest.c >&5
  conftest.c:68:16: error: gd.h: No such file or directory
  configure:9158: $? = 1
  configure: failed program was:

  [...]

  configure:9172: result: no

  configure:9240: checking for gd.h
  configure:9249: result: yes
  configure:9867: creating ./config.status

Notice that there is no -I option passed to gcc for the usability test,
but -I/usr/pkg/include is specified for the presence test.

Is this done deliberately? If yes, what's the reason behind this?

I agree with much of what you say, Reinhard, but I also
hope that one day the whole world will move on to a system
in which animals are treated humanely at all times, including
the VERY point of slaughter.  As to taking a live chicken home,
although I can go along with this in principle, to see a
chicken hung from its tied legs over the handlbars of
a bicycle (as I did in Lao Cai), fills me with horror and
disgust.  And I had to turn off, very quickly, two
recent programs on China being shewn on German television :
the first, "Hund, Ente, Fisch" was self-explanatory,
and I should have known what to expect, but the sight (and
sound) of the dog being picked up by iron tongs and then
dropped into a hole just made me sick beyond belief.  And
a more recent program on the Dong people of China was all
very interesting until the point where Hundefleisch was
mentioned, at which point I had to switch off (I shall
never know how the program ended).

Thank you for your help, tlmgr is working again. 

A little additional request: I had a problem to find out, which package
I had to reinstall; I finally managed that by downloading the file from
the svn repository (is that the intended way?).

So my question: in rpm-based distributions I use the command
rpm -qf <file>
to find the package, which <file> belongs to. Is something like that
possible, or intended to implement?

Happy TeXing

Can you try the current install-tl from the svn repository (or should I
send it?)? I have moved the perl-tk check before the tlpdb loading, and
wait for 3sec if it switches from GUI to Text mode ...

well, there are simpler way, but not in your case, because tlmgr was not
working ...

Normally you can do
	tlmgr search --file tlmgr
or something similar (see man page or texdoc tlmgr).

In your case because tlmgr was broken you could just open
	<ROOT>/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
(where <ROOT> is the installation directory, normally
/usr/local/texlive/2008) and search the respective file. Then scroll up
for the next 
	name XXXXXX
and XXXXX will be the package.

In short time there will be a auto-exec for unix, too...

Best wishes

Evidently your DVD is bad.  Make sure your .iso download is not corrupt,
i.e., check the md5 or whatever, and then burn another one.  Or order it

    The Metafont sources for the feyn fonts appear in texmf-dist/doc/fonts/feyn,
    not in -- as I would expect -- texmf-dist/fonts/source/feyn.  

Well, it should be a subdir of fonts/source.  Working on it.  Tx.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr not working after a "failed" tlcritical update
Message-ID: <49085E60.7010603@math.jussieu.fr>

    Dear all,

    I've encountered a strange behavior with the "tlcritical" 
repository. I've launched an update and it failed to download 
"texlive.infra" and "texlive.infra.i386-linux" with the errors below... 
Since then, tlmgr does not work anymore and exits
with
Can't locate object method "option" via package "TeXLive::TLPDB" at 
/opt/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/tlmgr line 1053.

    I think tlmgr has been only partially upgraded and as a result is 
not functioning anymore... What can I do to help solving this issue?

     Yours,

             Erwan

Subject: [tex-live] universal font incompatible with mf
Message-ID: <4909F361.70404@pakin.org>

TeX Live 2008's version of Metafont doesn't like TeX Live 2008's
version of the universal font (texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/universa).
Here's a transcript:

     $ tex testfont
     This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (Web2C 7.5.7)
     (/usr/local/stow/texlive-2008/texmf-dist/tex/plain/base/testfont.tex

     Name of the font to test = fulmr10
     Now type a test command (\help for help):)
     *\table

     *\bye

     mktexpk: `mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1+0/600; nonstopmode; input fulmr10' failed.

Basically, Metafont seems to be saying that "bye" is not permitted
within a macro definition (viz., end_font).  Is this a new Metafont
"feature"?  (The fonts are dated 1998 so I'm guessing that they didn't
suddenly add an offending "bye" command.)

As a workaround, I removed the "bye" from the definition of end_font
in unibase.mf and moved it after the call to end_font in fulmr10.mf,
etc.  Is there any chance that TeX Live could be updated to make mf
and universal play nice with each other, though?

Thanks,

Hi Oliver,

    tlmgr: installation location
    http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
    
That default url auto-redirects.  Therefore it may have redirected to
one site (up to date) for the --list and a different site (out of date)
for the --all.  I'll see about making this more explicit,

Those changes were only made a day or two ago, so it's not surprising
that not all mirrors have them yet.

Best,
Karl

Phil, I recently read a few books about the Vietnam War.  It wasn't
funny at all.  And I hope that everybody in the world learns enough
about the dark side of German history at school.  It's not funny
either.

But the biggest mistake you can do is to close your eyes if things are
displeasing.  Almost every evil in the world had been possible because
too many people looked away.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Under communism Vietnamese students had chance to study in
Czechoslovakia and due to war most of them were older than us. And
they spent one year learning Czech. I had an opportunity to talk to
one of them who was tortured in a tiger cage but he had luck, he
survived with both arms and legs and even with all fingers. If you
haven`t heard about tiger cages, look at
http://www.historiansagainstwar.org/resources/torture/luce.html but
what he told us was much worse than written in this page.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr not working after a "failed" tlcritical update
In-Reply-To: <49085E60.7010603@math.jussieu.fr>
Message-ID: <200810302325.m9UNPVg25860@f7.net>

    Can't locate object method "option" via package "TeXLive::TLPDB" at 
    /opt/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/tlmgr line 1053.

Drat.  Sorry.

My suggestion is to go to
  ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl/tlpkg/TeXLive/
and explicitly download the *.pm files and manually put them into
tlpkg/tlpkg/TeXLive.  Then visit 
  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
and manually put that into texmf/script/texlive.

After that,  tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra  will hopefully run
ok, and get things back in a reasonable state.

We're working on an easier way to recover from the "broken tlmgr"
problem, but for now, the above is it.

FYI, thanks for wanting to try it, but tlcritical doesn't currently have
any interesting differences compared to the released version (tlnet).
We pushed the changes out a couple days ago.

the bundle has been updated on CTAN, the misplaced file has been 
renamed, so it should be ready for a TL update.

Hello,

what about changing install-tl to search for lzma binaries in $PATH if
they are not found on the DVD, as it's already done with wget? (I use
this to install TL on NetBSD systems for which there are no binaries
provided.) Patch attached.

Hi Karl,

thanks for the explanation.  Perhaps it is a good idea to tell people to
choose one mirror rather than relying on the auto-redirection.  This way,
people could choose a mirror that works reasonable good for them.  Also,
there would be no need for downloading the package db each time tlmgr is
invoked.  Along the way, network traffic would be minimized.

Sorry for the noise,
 olli

Hello,

Thank you all for your help. It was just corrupted downloaded iso image file
which was causing this problem.

Now I have installed TexLive-2008 on Zenwalk Snapshot. It is working fine.

Hi guys,

What's the recommended way of installing tl2008 on Ubuntu (64 bit), from 
the dvd or from the repo?

Do I still need to run the minimals along my installation to use ConTeXt?

Hi Scott,

         ! Forbidden token found while scanning the definition of end_font.
         <inserted text>
                        enddef

                           bye
         l.139   bye

I updated the universa package in TL (and uploaded the new uni.dtx with
a one-line fix to CTAN).

The modes.mf in TL 2008 no longer defines bye and end, per Knuth's
(relatively) recent mail.  Therefore they remain outer tokens as defined
by plain.mf.  This font uses `end' in an inner context, so we have to
make inner.  

Best,
karl

The latest version translates the shortcut locations to short names.
Try the net installer at
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

The file install-tl/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLWinGoo.pm should have a date of
october 29, otherwise your mirror is has not yet been updated for
this modification and you should wait a bit longer. I hope this
solves the problem.

In further tests, more paranoid setting of the searchpath from
within the installer didn't help, but fixing the environment
beforehand did; which matches your experiences.

Hi Jukka, 

    what about changing install-tl to search for lzma binaries in $PATH 

Thanks, but I don't think it's a good idea because random versions of
lzma will likely fail in mysterious ways, due to changes in the format
and bugs in the utilities.  (Which is not the case for wget.)

It seems to me the best thing to do is get the netbsd support into the
distribution instead of trying to work around it.  Can we do that?

Best,
karl
