Well, geez, it's not like I intentionally "dropped" it.  I never heard
of it before.  I see it now, and will see about including it as teTeX
did, which looks simple enough.

    whether it's not a good idea to dump grtimes from tex-live.

Aside from any other reasons, since the doc states that grtimes requires
the (nonfree) Monotype Times font, I've removed grtimes from TL.

For dante.de, I don't think so. Security issues, what packages are 
installed, in what versions, how to handle the complaints that a 
document doesn't work; I see neither sufficient interest nor 
sufficient personal resources to maintain such a service. Hell, we 
don't even find people who contribute work on the FAQ or on DANTE's 
Web site.

Look also into

   texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/ibygrk/ibycus4.map

which is not a dvips map file but contains mf and tex code.

On CTAN it's in:

   fonts/greek/ibygrk/fonts/source/public/ibycus4/

The dvips map file is iby.map, which is installed properly in TeX
Live.

TeXLive contains pbox.sty, but not its documentation which could be
generated from pbox.dtx (also included). 

On CTAN, there's  the dtx and ins file and a pbox.pdf, which seems to
have been added in 2005. Thus it seems something needs to be done
manually?

I'm all in favour of something like that.

I've set up the MathTran server (http://www.mathtran.org) that is now
serving about 30,000 images a day, typeset from TeX notation.  It has a
capacity, after a few tweaks, of about 2,000,000 as I recall.

It uses a secure version of the plain TeX format, and runs TeX as a daemon
(which gives high performance), so dirty tricks like
  \global \let \alpha \beta
do no harm.

Its hosting costs a nominal 1,000 pounds a year, and so it's within the
budget of user groups.

The MathTran server can process documents as well as formulas, but that
interface is not exposed at present.

Doing some more search, I've also found this site:

which comes very near to what would like to have.  Unfortunately, it
isn't a complete TeXLive setup.  However, I'll write an email to

Hmm.  As a test, I tried to include

Troy Henderson has a similar site, and there are some others.  You'll find
some links that might interest you at

It says "click "back" in your browser and look into the log file.
TeXonWeb is not a complete TeXLive so I think that CJK is not
supported there.

Excuse me, Karl, I didn't know, that composing an "?" was impossible with
your keyboard.
Since "M\"unster" looks even uglier, you can keep the "Munster" or just

any plans to dump a new XeTeX version into TeXLive?  Someone

Hi Werner,

Yes, TL2008 will definitely include an updated xetex. It's already in  
TL svn, actually (in trunk/Build/source/...), as of a couple of  
months ago, but I will refresh it again before the release to catch  
additional updates.

Hi guys,

What is going on with the autoconf upgrade? I copied kpathsea

generated by autoconf 2.61a (committed by PEB, according to

That version does not seem to compile on MacOsX: I got an error
report from Yue Wang <yuleopen at gmail.com> containing this
output (I shortened the output a bit):

I emailed PEB about this on Saturday. It was reasonable that I had no
answer yet, but I was impatient, so I decided to check the repository
just now. Now it turns out I should have emailed Peter M?nster instead,
if I understand Karls comment correctly. Can someone please explain
and/or make sure that the above error report reaches the right person?

Message-ID: <8719b6240802050259t9cbce3fu2296eed7e0669668@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have developed a package for typesetting the Prague Bulletin of
Mathematical Linguistics. The package should be freely available for
all authors. The editors intend to suggest their authors to use
TeXLive. Since the autors are not TeX experts and may not be able to
install additional packages, they would be happy if the package could
be distributed with TL (and possibly with other distributions). There
is now a question of a license. The free licenses allow modification
and redistribution of modified version. However, the editors will
always use the unmodified version which will be actively maintained.
Thus I would like to know what license should be chosen for this
package so that it can be included in most TeX distributions but
reduce the risk that some authors would receive some modified version
which differs too much from the one used by the journal editors.

The LPPL exists for exactly that scenario.

I could build some (i386-linux), but I don't maintain the "canonical"  
old Linux system, libs, etc., that are used for the TL release  
binaries. So I was assuming that would happen as part of the overall  
build process as we approach release. It might only confuse things if  
I start checking in Linux binaries built on a different configuration.

WDYT? Karl? Others?

I am too lazy and too busy to read build instructions. If someone can
point me to some simple and short document, I can build versions for
i386 and x86_64 on my CentOS machines (based on RHEL4). There may only
be one problem: fontconfig in RHEL4 is old.

  I'm not sure if it's related, but right now the SVN trunk doesn't
build correctly; it stops in libs/gd (updated by Peter apparently).  It
has been so for some days already.

Message-ID: <foabjp$vrv$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi Guys:

I've been having some trouble with xdvi on Solaris and Windows in TeX 
Live 2007.  I found an Ubuntu problem that was quite similar.  There 
were a number of potential solutions and I spent some time trying them. 
  However, somebody in the forum suggested xpdf.  I hadn't tried it in 
years and I didn't like it then.  But, the new version is much, much 
better.  Is it slated for TeX Live 2008?  This would be a nice addition
IMHO.

Thanks,

Rodney

All you normally have to do is go to texlive/trunk/Build/source/ and  
run the Build script located there; this should make everything  
(within the Work dir that it creates). The binaries end up in Build/ 
source/inst/bin/<platform>.

However, it sounds like the configure scripts are undergoing some  
changes, so I don't know if the overall process works right now.

    better.  Is it slated for TeX Live 2008?

Sorry, I don't intend to include xpdf in TL 08, or any of the ten
zillion other programs that are useful in the TeX world but not specific
to TeX.  xpdf is already easily obtained and installed through normal
channels, and TL is already too big.

P.S. I'm a big fan of xpdf myself, and use it nearly exclusively.
But still!

Peter and Martin have been working hard updating things to a recent

Right.

    It might only confuse things if I start checking in Linux binaries
    built on a different configuration.

Right.  I am rather loath to start checking in new binaries at such a
random point as now.

Werner, if you really need them, Jonathan or I or whomever could build
them (once we get configure working again) and get them to you
separately.  Or you could build them yourself ...

Apparently BSD sed can't deal with these sed commands.  Martin had the
same problem.  peb wrote this:

   in texk/m4/kpse_inc.m4 there are three lines defining
   'kpse_substs="sed ...'  with this command.  A few lines earlier is
   an alternative definition, commented out by dnl. You could try to
   use this version (at least for the moment).

I'll see if I can get new versions to try checked in in the next couple
days (I'm going to be offline myself tomorrow, sigh), unless peb
(hopefully) beats me to it.

    and/or make sure that the above error report reaches the right person?

This is the right place to report TL build problems.

I think that would be a good idea, but it should first be done in the

I vote for this suggestion.
Also, how about dropping ucs completely? It's unmaintained; is it
needed for something? I find international characters to work much
better without it than with it.

In that case, we should think of a "collection-obsolete". Those who have
old documents will be annoyed if we completely remove it, and ucs.sty is
not exactly decades old. 

Having to install that collection might give people some incentive to
fix their documents...

Maybe people are using it already and did not encounter any problems.
Is there any good reason to break their documents?

The fact that it's unmaintained is not significant.  There are many
files in TeX Live or on CTAN which are unmaintained.  The main problem
is that they are not accompanied with a license file which allows
other people to take over maintenance when the original author is
unreachable or dead.

>From Dominiques homepage:

  Due to time restrictions, I am not able to maintain this package
  anymore.  New maintainer welcome.

I'm wondering why people complain that ucs is unmaintained though
everybody can take over maintenance while on the other hand nobody
asked for removing PiCTeX, which is unmaintained for decades.

What Dominique did is fine and there is absolutely nothing which
legitimates any complaints.

  Reinhard

AFAIK not before the summer. XeTeX will probably have reached version 
0.998 by then. In the meanwhile, I suggest you try installing the latest 
SVN version using these instructions:

mkdir xetex
cd xetex
svn co http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/xetex/TRUNK
./build-xetex
strip Work/texk/web2c/xetex #optional
sudo ./install-xetex
cd ..
mkdir xdvipdfmx
cd xdvipdfmx
svn co http://scripts.sil.org/svn-public/xdvipdfmx/TRUNK
./configure # you may have to add --with-kpathsea=<location of kpathsea 
library>
make
strip src/xdvipdfmx #optional
sudo make install

That will install the binaries of xetex and xdvipdfmx, rebuild the 
formats, and install the latest development versions of xelatex-related 
packages (fontspec, etc) ?under TEXMFLOCAL.

Hope it helps,

Fran?ois

Well, i didn't think about that... collection-obsolete is a better
choice then. I suggested dropping it because I find nowadays that
using inputenc with utf8 works better than inputenc utf8x and ucs.

Also, Fedora 9's texlive doesn't have ucs, if that's relevant.

Subject: [tex-live] share sub-directory
Message-ID: <20080207212952.GB18269@gaston.couberia.bzh>

Hello,

Between revision 6385 and 6514 something has happened, that makes my
texlive-build procedure fail. It's probably related to the fact, that I
copy the texmf-trees to the "prefix" instead of "prefix/share". So the
question is: Is the "share" sub-directory now mandatory, or is there a bug
in the build procedure?

Here are my commands to build texlive:

cd Master
mkdir /tmp/prefix
mv texmf texmf-dist texmf-doc /tmp/prefix
cd ../Build/source
mkdir work
cd work
../configure --prefix=/tmp/prefix --with-system-ncurses \
             --with-system-pnglib --with-system-t1lib \
             --with-system-zlib --with-system-gd \
             --with-system-freetype2 --with-system-icu \
             --with-system-freetype --disable-multiplatform
make world
find /tmp/prefix -name texmf.cnf

    Is the "share" sub-directory now mandatory, 

There was no such intention.  TL itself has no share/ subdir after all.

    kpathsea: Running mktexfmt latex.fmt

So, the question is why mktexfmt is exiting without making the fmt.  Try
running bash -vx mktexfmt latex.fmt from the shell, for starters.

I can't look at 100+ changes and magically intuit where the problem
might be :).

    I think that would be a good idea, but it should first be done in the
    upstream collections. What do others think?

I moved ucs from collection-latexrecommended to collection-latexextra in TL.

Subject: [tex-live] Help! Would like to use xdvi with TeXLive2007 in cygwin
Message-ID: <758537630802070354x39b8b00cy140509d38ee9b930@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sirs and Mesdames:

I am a heavy LaTeX user not only for English typesetting; for dealing
with the local bureaucracy, I use CJK in LaTeX [have been doing so
since CJK-4.1.2, in those days using NTU TTF fonts; today using
arphic].  I am not very programming-savvy or TeX-smart, but I had been
using tetex for a long time, both on my Linux boxes and in cygwin on
windows notebooks.  With CJK working [at least in Big5] for me in
cygwin, I am happy.  I use auctex, emacs amd xdvi for my papers, daily
correspondence and proposals.

Problem is, I bought a new laptop; for whatever reasons, the current
cygwin tetex installation is totally broken -- I cannot get it to
function at all.  When I tried to run any tex executable, it cannot
find its files.  For the last 4-5 days at least, when I deleted my
entire cygwin partition and try again, nothing happens.  Still cannot
find any of its config and map files.  No (La)TeX at all.

I got myself a TeX Live 2007 disk and installed that.  Now I can run
TeXLive, but I don't really want to use WinEdit or UltraEdit, I am too
used to emacs+auctex+xdvi.  Problem is, the TeXLive2007 windows
distribution doesn't have am xdvi.  Can someone furnish a xdvi package
compiled for cygwin, or point me to a step-by-step explanation of how
to compile one for myself.  Alternatively, can someone tell me how to
do something to the xdvi included in cygwin so that I can run it using
TeXLive's TDS.

Best wishes for the Year of the Mouse,
Bo-Yin Yang

P.S.

This is the typical error messages that happen to me when I try to run
the cygwin xdvi under texlive

mktexmf: empty or non-existent rootfile
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for ptmr7t
[lots more of the same, xdvi eventually runs and the file is displayed
after many errors]

Of course! I can help with further investigations in about 7 days.
Just one quick hint:
With revision 6385, I got the following line in
prefix/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf:
TEXMFDIST = $SELFAUTODIR/texmf-dist

With revision 6514, I get this line in prefix/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf:
TEXMFDIST = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-dist
and this line in prefix/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf:
TEXMFDIST = $SELFAUTODIR/share/texmf-dist

Output of "bash -vx mktexfmt latex.fmt":

    do something to the xdvi included in cygwin so that I can run it using
    TeXLive's TDS.

If you're lucky, perhaps simply copying the executable into the same bin
directory as the TL binaries will work.  (It can then try to find the
fonts and support files by its own location.)

Failing that, all that comes to mind is to write a batch file that sets
environment variables and then calls the cygwin xdvi.  Perhaps all that
is needed is
set TEXMFCNF=c:\your\texlive\root\web2c
but I cannot say for sure.

Best,
karl

Hi,
first of all, if you are an emacs user, you might want to use it on
Windows too even outside the Cygwin environment.  There is a Windows
version of emacs+auctex in the support directory of the TeX Live 2007
DVD already.  If you don't have the DVD you can download the latest
release from

  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/auctex/emacs+auctex-w32-2007-07-07.zip

Just unzip the file somewhere and link runemacs.exe to the start menu.

If you have TL-2007 installed you can use it immediately and almost
everything works as on Cygwin.  However, you don't have xdvi.

There are two ways to get binaries for Cygwin.  You could try to use
the binaries I compiled myself, or you can compile them yourself.

I compiled the binaries from the sources which had been in the TL svn
repository last summer.  But AFAIK nothing had been changed since
TL-2007 had been released.  I had not been able to compile xetex and
dvipdfmx, maybe some libraries are missing or had not been
up-to-date, though the version of Cygwin I used was not very old.

The binaries are not tested at all, but you can download them from:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/cyg-bin-wo-xetex.tar.bz2

Then you have to copy the texmf stuff to the Cygwin environment.
There is a difference between Windows and UNIX.  On Windows you have
something like

  texlive2007/texmf*
  texlive2007/bin/win32
  texlive2007/texmf-local

On Cygwin/Unix it should like

  /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf*
  /usr/local/texlive/2007/bin/i386-Cygwin
  /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

There is a file texmf-var/web2c/texmf.cnf which is the Windows version
of texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.  You have to remove it.

Unzip the binaries in /usr/local/texlive/2007/bin.  This creates a new
directory "i386-cygwin".  Add this directory to PATH and run texhash.

I hope it works.  If not, either I forgot something or you have to
compile it yourself.  But explain the problem here before you proceed.

It's quite easy to compile TeX Live on Cygwin.  Read
.../Build/source/README.  It's sufficient to execute the Build script
but I had to add the options --without-xetex --without-dvipdfmx.

There is a severe bug in Cygwin which you have to circumvent somehow:
Cygwin appends its own directories to the PATH it inherits from
Windows instead *pre*pending them.  I had problems with name clashes.
As a quick workaround you could do

  echo $PATH

  export PATH=< $PATH with Windows stuff removed >

in the current shell before you start the Build script.

Regards,
  Reinhard

These things are not uncommon in TeX-Live, and it is very hard to get it
right, without lumping everything together in one big collection. I'm
Cc'ing upstream in case someone has an opinion on that particular case.

As for Debian, I suggest that we gather the info from existing and
future reports like this somewhere, and then decide whether it makes
sense to add Recommends, Suggests (or even Depends). I would rather not
add a relationship for every bug report we get, for fear of getting
exactly what I said above: One big lump of files, formally divided into
packages, but not actually installable on their own.

    A typo.  I meant `FC' fonts.

Ok.

But now, I don't exactly see that there's anything to do.  Yes, fc*.tfm
have parens in the coding schemes.  But that is not disallowed in tfm's,
as far as I can see.  It is only disallowed in pl's.  And tftopl changes
() in the bcpl strings to /.  So it seems like all the programs are
doing the right thing?

I certainly agree it would be better if the original tfm's did not
contain parens, but that is not up to me.  (If Jorg agrees but doesn't
have time, I don't mind making the actual changes and re-uploading to
CTAN, but I don't want to change the tfm's just in TL.)

Dear Sirs and Mesdames:

I wrote to the list crying about how I can't get cygwin's latex to work,
and I can get texlive's binaries to work in place of cygwin's own,
but then I am missing xdvi.

Tipped off by this suggestion, I checked to see if cygwin inherited any
TEXMF
related environmental variables, and sure enough, TeXLive sets TEXMFCNF
and TEXMFTMP, which clobbers  cygwin's own TeX/LaTeX installation [tetex].

I unset those environmental variables in the .bashrc and everything can now
work, I built a tar file that will install CJK for big5 using the arphic TTF
fonts
as kai and song over the current cygwin

I put it at

http://by.iis.sinica.edu.tw/cjk-cygwin

Hope this helps someone in the future.

I still can't use cygwin's xdvi with TeXLive's other binaries,
if I get it to work, I'll let everybody know.

Subject: [tex-live] gellmu executable name conflicts?
Message-ID: <200802100041.m1A0fEB22406@f7.net>

The author of Gellmu (http://www.albany.edu/~hammond/gellmu/) and I are
contemplating putting gellmu in TeX Live.  As things stand, this would
mean several new executables (all scripts), with rather cryptic names:

lg2h
lg2s
lg2x
mmkg
umkg
mmkg-choose
lmkg
mmkgfroms
mmkgfromx
xg2pl
mkg

I'm not sure yet if all of these are completely required, but I want to
get the scoop: are there other programs by these names in existence?
Can you distro guys check, please, and let me know?
(Or if any other problems with the above.)

Thanks,
karl

Indeed these names are much too generic and too short. If it is possible
to change with something more meaningfull (especially those with 4
letters and less), it would be very nice. When I review a package for
inclusion in fedora and I see such names in a shared namespace (in
bindor, include directory or file, library name, package names), I
refuse to accept it. Other reviewers may disagree and let it pass
the review, but I think it is bad. I think we should care with existing
but also future conflicts and teach upstream to choose meaningful names.
I've been personnally bitten by these issues with tex4ht, though now
it is fixed.

I agree that such cryptic names are not good. I think I do not have
such executables but I often define such cryptic aliases to frequently
used commands requiring long arguments. I can imagine that "mkg" may
be a good candidate for such an alias. If Gellmu is installed to such
a computer, its "mkg" could not be used from the command line.

Well, yes.  Conversion gives a warning message, though.

I agree with Patrice. I couldn't find any conflicts in Debian ATM, but
still those names shouldn't be used.

I also think that it serves the users better if the programs have
self-explaining names. Like fontconvert-xg2pl (just guessing).

Are all those executables actually meant to be used directly by the
document author? If there's actually a script which calls them, one
could also consider installing them in /usr/lib/gellmu.

    Well, yes.  Conversion gives a warning message, though.

As it should.

tftopl probably shouldn't declare the tfm file "BAD" in this case, since
it isn't, but that seems too trivial a point to change the code for.

The only thing to do here is change the tfm's.  And I realized I can't
do it after all, since Jorg insists that the tfm file sizes be a
multiple of 256, and I don't run VMS :).

If it matters enough to you, I can only suggest writing Jorg again about
it.  I am a bit doubtful that any change will ensue ...

Best,

    TeXLive sets TEXMFCNF and TEXMFTMP

FWIW, canonical TeX Live does not now set any environment variables at
all.  (Definitely not on Unix, which I expect is the basic story for
Cygwin.)  They must have been left over from a previous installation, or
be something that the Cygwin people added.

Anyway, glad you found a way to get working again.

Thank you for this suggestion. I have looked at LPPL and I think that

I don't know whether this is a packaging buglet of the euenc bundle or
a problem with the ctan2tds script: In texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/euenc,
you can find the files README and README.txt which are identical.  One
of them should be removed IMHO.

While xgreek.sty (for XeLaTeX) is available in TeXLive, its source

there is just a small README.1ST file it would be even more valuable
to have it.

apostolos seems not to have provided the source (we would have installed
it for sure, if he had, but neither file is on the archive).

(some of these xetex things came to ctan from the xetex repository -- we
have been told more than once "please install this from the
respository".  since i've not investigated the repository in detail, i
don't know if sources, etc., are there; but installing -- rather than
mirroring -- is more than we ordinarily offer to do, and we ordinarily
wouldn't, anyway.)

Hi,
I installed texlive-full on my Ubuntu 7.10 by apt-get.
When I try to include an eps file, after latex the .tex file, the 
resulting dvi shows only a blank frame for the figure.

But when I transform the .eps file to a PDF file and pdflatex the .tex 
file, the output is ok.

latex test

This is true: I did not provide the source. The reason for this was that one
could typeset the document with a font that was not publicly available.
Now, I have almost finished this font so if there is still some time I can
release both the dtx file and the fonts.

What program do you use to view the dvi?

Remember that EPS inclusion is equivalent to a \special, it writes a
command to the DVI file, not the image. DVI viewers may not understand
this \special and may ignore it, some DVI viewers are able to call
ghostscript and ask it to render EPS and return it as a bitmap. In
this process some information is lost. Although it may work fine in a
great many cases, some graphical object may be damaged when displayed
in the DVI viewer but will look correctly in the PS output generated
by dvips. Imagine that you first typeset some text and you place some
vector image, eg some frame as EPS. The PS output will be correct but
since the DVI viewer gets a rectangular bitmap from ghostscript, your
text will disappear. That's why I never use DVI viewers when working
with EPS and/or PSTricks.

Hi Werner,
this is what subversion inserts if it encounters a conflict.  It
should be sufficient to run "svn update" again.  rev 6614 looks fine.

I am not sure that this helps. First, if you run "svn status", you
will see "C" in front of the file name. The reason of the conflict is
that you made (either intentionally or by mistake) local changes to
texmf-dist/ls-R ant they overlap changes made in the repository so
that they cannot be merged together. "svn update" will most probably
still leave the file in conflict because you still have your
incompatible local changes. I would suggest first deleting ls-R and
then running "svn update". If should inform you that a lost file is
being refreshed and hopefully will solve the conflict condition.

Well, I am not sure what exactly happens if you delete a file that was
in a conflict so doing it "subversion-like" would be the best method.
You certainly want to get rid of your local changes (in this case).
You acheive it by a single comand:

svn revert texmf-dist/ls-R

This even does not need to contact the server since all required

Of course.  xdvi is linked against an X11 server which is not part
of TeX Live.  You could try the xdvi* files I compiled on Cygwin last
summer:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/xdviprogs-win32.tar.gz (946 kB)

Extraxt the archive in the bin directory.  If the programs don't work,
the most likely reason is that we have different versions of the
Cygwin DLLs.

  Reinhard

Yes, the file should be removed, of course.  And then the whole tree
has to be updated because it doesn't make any sense to have a recent
ls-R file and an ancient texmf-dist tree.

Hi Pander,

    The following patch will improve ntgclass brief.cls to adhere better to

Thanks, but this needs to go to the maintainer of ntgclass or otherwise
end up on CTAN.  We try hard not to patch files in TL that have an

Because it really has to be limited in some way, and before you,
nobody had complained that 2000 was not enough.

No, it can easily be increased a bit, but we have to ask the
texlive team (tex.ch is controlled by texlive, not pdftex).

Question forwarded. I propose a max_font_max value of 5000.

    you can find the files README and README.txt which are identical.  One
    of them should be removed IMHO.

Thanks for the report.

It turns out that README is present in the euenc directory on CTAN,
while README.txt is generated by running euenc.dtx.  So I'm not inclined
to create a special case for this, the script is just doing the standard
thing (copy the directory, run the dtx's).  If it bothers you enough, I
suggest asking the author (Will Robertson) to take it out of the dtx.

Your test.dvi look fine on my Fedora 8 texlive system using
xdvi (from RH's tetex package as well as the texlive svn version)
and kdvi.   In
general, converting figures to pdf and using pdf(la)tex is less fragile,
so unless you really need .dvi and enjoy debugging other people's
code, it may not be worth the effort to track down the
problem on your system.  Pdf is used by a much larger community than
dvi, so pdf tools tend to be better tested than the tools that are specific
to TeX dvi format.

But when I transform the .eps file to a PDF file and pdflatex the .tex

It is nice to see a proper problem report with the test files.   Since the
.eps file is rendered by ghostscript, one has to consider a) bad eps, or
b) a buggy ghostscript version.   "epstool --test-eps" didn't find any
problems with test.eps, and the fact that you can convert test.eps to
pdf suggests that your ghostscript can render the file.  What does "xdvi
-debug 32 test.dvi" give?

And below are the texlive components in my machine (by dpkg -l | grep
> texlive)

I would not say that dvi tools are not well tested. The true reason is
that dvi viewers display dvi files, not eps files. Some support for
eps was introduced to some viewers but they need cooperation with
other tools (ghostscript). No support for eps in some particular dvin
viewer can just be more than expected. On the other hand, the
situation with pdf tools is not much better. I reported two bugs in
Acrobat Reader, one in January 2004, another in March 2004. They have
not been fixed yet. I know about a few more bugs but it seems that
reporting bugs to Adobe makes no sense. I have also reported pdf
related bug in ghostscript and it was fixed very quickly.

Subject: [tex-live] missing file pspicture.ps  needed by pspicture package
Message-ID: <429489.64537.qm@web58503.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi, 

When I am trying to use the pspicture package, dvips eventually 
refers to a postscript header file "pspicture.ps" 
which is not distributed in recent texlive versions (checked on 
recent Kubuntu, opensuse, mac).  With tetex releases ( at least in version 3.0) 
this file is installed at 
/usr/share/texmf/dvips/misc/pspicture.ps
It looks like it is supposed to be extracted from pspicture.dtx. 
I checked the latest texinfo sources and tried to build them but
the accompanying  style file has been checked into svn at
./Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/pspicture/pspicture.sty
and is not actually extracted from 
./Master/texmf-dist/source/latex/pspicture/pspicture.dtx
during the build.  At least I didn't find where that would happen. 
It seems the pspicture.dtx
still contains the lines that should go into pspicture.ps
but that of course is not extracted from the dtx file either.  
The question is when and how the extraction should happen 
or if  the pspicture.ps file should be checked into the svn repo. 

Thanks, 

Jean

Uh, oh.

I don't like that.

Well, they aren't dependent...

> Wdyt?

What about the following:

  . The main idea is to have copies of those two files in special
    subdirectories in the TDS:

      <TEXMF>/backup/hwkatakana/udmjff.{vf,tfm}
      <TEXMF>/backup/cjk/udmjff.{vf,tfm}

    The former two are installed by the hwkatakana package, the latter
    by the cjk package.

  . If hwkatakana gets installed, the two files (in the standard TDS
    location) are always overridden.

  . If hwkatakana gets uninstalled, restore the original files if
    copies are present in backup/cjk/.

  . If CJK gets installed or uninstalled, check whether there is
    something in backup/hwkatakana.  Otherwise, install or uninstall
    udmjff.{vf.tfm}.

To say it with a different point of view:

  CJK install:

    . Copy the two files to backup/cjk/.
    . Copy the two files to the original location if they are not
      present in backup/hwkatakana/.

  CJK uninstall:

    . Remove the two files from backup/cjk/.
    . Remove the two files from the original location if they are not
      present in backup/hwkatakana.

  hwkatakana install:

    . Copy the two files two backup/hwkatakana/.
    . Copy the two files to the original location unconditionally.

  hwkatakana uninstall:

    . Remove the two files from backup/hwkatakana/.
    . If the two files are present in backup/cjk/, copy them to the
      original locations.

> Of course, it would be better not to have this "replacement" in the

Yes, and it can't be avoided.  I can imagine that such a conflict
happens in the future too, so I've invested some time to think about a
possible generic solution.  A simplification would be to copy the
whole CJK and hwkatakana packages to backup/... during installation,
and everything gets copied back to the original places if needed, but
this is (a) a waste of disk space and (b) probably a bad idea if done
unasked -- despite of warnings, users might modify files directly in
the TDS main tree...

Of course it would be possible!  But:

  . hwkatakana is a stand-alone package and works as such.

  . CJK is basically a macro package, not a bundle for fonts.

BTW, I've made an error: It's not a problem with the `CJK' package but
with `wadalab'.

It would make sense to integrate hwkatakana into wadalab, at least on
the TeXLive side.  Hmm...  Anyway, it's still a quirky issue...

Hello all,

Sorry about the whole mess. I hope the solution proposed by Werner
will be acceptable. I'm afraid I don't have experience with automatic
installations. I assume in this mail the double quoted text is from
the original mail by Karl (Berry?).

Werner, is it not possible to integrate hwk into CJK as a matter of
cohesion? Even if you do not like half-width katakana :-)

That sounds workable to uneducated me too.

Yes, probably at any time that the hwk is out of sync with
improvements to the Wadalab fonts and/or the CJK package (because I
have to create the new VF from somewhere).

Yes, you are right. Of course: CJK depends on wadalab, and so does hwk.

To clarify:

hwk has three parts: the font part which is independent of TeX and CJK
(.pfb fonts),
a part which requires TeX to be there to use (TeX fonts) and a part
which requires CJK to be there (font definition files).

If the font parts of hwk were incorporated into the wadalab package
then the part relevant to CJK could possibly be incorporated into CJK,
perhaps?

   . The main idea is to have copies of those two files in special
     subdirectories in the TDS:

You're talking about implementing an entirely new and quite complex TL
package (un)installation method, unlike anything that's ever been done
before in TL.  Sorry, there's just no way that's going to happen,
certainly not for this year's release.

    I can imagine that such a conflict happens in the future

We've lived with the more-or-less unique name restriction for decades
now.  I don't think it's going to change.

    Well, they aren't dependent...

The actual dependency or lack thereof isn't the point.  We don't, in
general, try to track package dependencies.

The point is that anyone who installed wadalab would get the
udmjff.{vf,tfm} fonts from hwkatakana, instead of randomly getting the
one or the other.  Does that work?  (I.e., you couldn't install wadalab
without hwkatakana.)

    It would make sense to integrate hwkatakana into wadalab, at least on
    the TeXLive side.  Hmm...  Anyway, it's still a quirky issue...

If wadalab ends up incoporating the hwkatakana font files, that would be
ideal from my perspective.  Then, ipso facto, there would be only one
version of the files.

OK, I will see if I can contact the maintainer of the wadalab package.

 	deb-src http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ src/

lmodern
	deb http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ lmodern/

context
 	deb http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ context/
 	deb-src http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ context/

luatex (for etch)

Hi,

A user has posted a possible bug in tl-2007 to me. I don't have much information about this, and if it means nothing to you guys I will write a follow up mail to see if I can find out more.

Can you comment on this (apart from it looks like a corrupted diff):

Perl: /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/source/latex/feynmf/feynmf.pl
Type of arg 1 to close must be HANDLE (not <HANDLE>) at
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/source/latex/feynmf/feynmf.pl line
376, near "<LOG>)"
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/source/latex/feynmf/feynmf.pl had
compilation errors.

I have compiled the feynmf example found on ctan (feynmf.tex) without any 
issues, so I don't want to touch it without further input. It does not help 
that I do not know much perl.

Either way it looks trivial.

The Debian version of feynmf has exactely this patch (and some others),

As it happens this file is not included in the OpenBSD port, for some reason (probably a TPM
dependancy issue?). However feynmf still works. How so?

Message-ID: <42f28fe0802260750u7e850a0bnec0ceb6a080c7e7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm having some problems with a custom font that I installed.

I'm running a image-rendering server that takes chunks of LaTeX code
and renders them from .tex -> .dvi -> .png, using latex and dvipng.
We use Trebuchet MS, convert to a type1 font and installed in
texmf-var, to render our graphics.  unfortunately, all our italic
script renders as bold.

I took our texmf-var/ directory from our server, put it as my home
directory on Ubuntu, and found that the trebuchet.map file in the
dvips driver was not mapping to the right fonts.  I fixed this and was
able to get italics working after running `updmap --enable Map
trebuchet.map`.  However, this fix did not work on the server, and I
am stumped as to what the cause may be.  I disabled and re-enabled the
map after the fix, but it's still going to the wrong fonts.  What do
you guys think?

Thanks,
Paul

Try:
updmap --listavailablemaps
to see the list of the map files and
kpsewhich trebuchet.map
to see which map file is actually used. Maybe you have two files with
the same name in different locations and updmap uses the wrong
version.

Something like (assuming that "all common input" is
stored in C:\TeX\Resources\MyTeXlib.tex)

	\input c:/TeX/Resources/MyTeXlib

Would that not suffice ?

It might not work. For security reasons it may be forbidden to use
absolute path or even read a file residing in a parent directory. It
would be better to put such a file to a subdirectory under
texmf-var/tex or texmf-local/tex.

Well, leaving aside the issue of how TeX might "forbid"
such things (would it still be TeX if it did this ?),
how then can the user specify with absolute certainty
that it is /his/ "MyTeXlib[.tex]" that he wishes to
reference, rather than simply the first file of that
name found in TeX's search path ?

Sometimes by modifying texmf.cnf. This is part of my texmf.cnf in TL2007:
% Allow TeX \openin, \openout, or \input on filenames starting with `.'
% (e.g., .rhosts) or outside the current tree (e.g., /etc/passwd)?
% a (any)        : any file can be opened.
% r (restricted) : disallow opening "dotfiles".
% p (paranoid)   : as 'r' and disallow going to parent directories, and
%                  restrict absolute paths to be under $TEXMFOUTPUT.
openout_any = p
openin_any = a

OK, but isn't this answering the non-question
rather than the question ?!  In other words,
you have told me (and others) how TeX Live
allows TeX to forbid certain file paths,
without clarifying how Steve (or others)
can be sure that TeX will open /their/
MyTeXlib[.tex] rather than just the first
file of that name found in TeX's search path ...

You can try to use the full path. If it is not allowed, you will see
something like the following:

(./open.aux)pdflatex: Not reading to /opt/apache-ant-1.6.5/README
(openin_any = p).

! I can't find file `/opt/apache-ant-1.6.5/README'.
l.3 \input /opt/apache-ant-1.6.5/README

Please type another input file name:


If you set openin_any = a, TeX accepts full path in \input.

Any user can control exactly what files are found by setting the search
path (TEXINPUTS in this case).  That is the standard practice.

Of course there are defaults to make this easy and behave "reasonably"
without changing anything, but if you want to control everything, you can.

Subject: [tex-live] installing truetype fonts in texlive for latex/lyx
Message-ID: <47C4B49E.7080405@cam.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I think I know what the answer will be, but is there a
simple way to install a truetype font to use in texlive?
I'm running LyX and usually pdflatex, on Fedora 8.

I had previously managed with tetex to get glyphs to come
out the other end of pdflatex by the use of ttf2afm /
afm2tfm, guessing the best encoding vectors to use and
filling in a few face entries in the .fd files that
fontinst produced.  This is clearly not going to get me
very far.  Someone had suggested texlive might have
better support for truetype.

So, is it easier to use truetype with texlive than tetex,
and what is possible?

Thanks for your time.

I fear we are going around in circles;
I have tried to suggest to Steve how
he can achieve his aim; you have pointed
out that my solution will fail if his
texmf.cnf prohibits a reference to
an absolute file location; but you haven't
(as far as I can see) postulated a solution
to his real problem IF his texmf.cnf
forbids absolute file references.  Do
you believe that there is a solution in those
circumstances, and if so, what do you
believe it to be ?

OK, I will write it more philosophically and I will end up with some
practical suggestions. It's quite a long mail...

There are four reasons why to add files somewhere and include them
into the document:

1. The document itself is too complex and splitting to several files
helps its maintanance. In such a case the correct place of the
included files is the current directory (or subdirectories), \input
uses relative paths and the included files are not used for other
documents.

2. The user needs repeatedly a set of his/her own macros. These macros
are planned to be reused in a great many documents but are not so
generic as to publish them on CTAN. Although private the file should
have a descriptive name which is distinct enough from names of other
files. Placing the file on a separate directory helps its maintanance
but searching should be based on the filename only, not on the
directory. If you have c:/somepath/macros.tex and
c:/otherpath/macros.tex, you soon forget which is which. If the file
names are (quoting my favourite book) myowninvention.tex,
cheshirecat.tex, jabberwocky.tex, you have better chance to remember
what each of them is good for. And there is small risk that a file
with the same name will exist anywhere else along the search path.
These files therefore belong to a directory which is on the search
path.

3. There is a new version of a package that is not yet present in the
installed version but the user needs its features. It should be placed
somewhere along the search path so that it is used instead of the
installed version but will not be used in the next distribution of TL
which will probably contain yet newer version of that package.

4. The user is a developer of a package and needs always the latest
version from the repository (CVS, SVN, ...). In such a case it is
better to edit texmf.cnf and add the working copy to the beginning of
the search path. Usually the package developer knows what he or she is
doing, this topic may be beyond the scope of  normal or slightly
advanced users.

Let's return to items 2 and 3. In my opinion proper system setup is
better then relying on absolute paths. It might be necessary to move a
file from one place to another. When you later run the file trough TeX
and it expects to find another file in an absolute path that no longer
exists, it will fail. After moving the file to another place the user
would have to modify all documents. If the file is along the TeX
search path and needs to be moved elsewhere, the user just modifies
the search path setting and all documents will work. And if you need
to switch between Windows or OS/2, where drive letters are used, and
Unix, where no drive letters exist, you run into other problems. I
know what I am writing about. I still suffer from not having proper
system setup and relying on absolute paths. Fortunatelly I always used
constructions:

\def\path{e:/some/strange/directory}
...
\input \path/file1
\input \path/file2

but still making several years old documents work is often painful.

Now let's go to the practical suggestions. Suppose that the user even
does not know where the search paths are defined (kpsewhich texmf.cnf
will find the config file). He or she just wants to take advantage of
the search paths that are already set. The search path setting may be
examined by commands as:
kpsewhich -var-value TEXINPUTS.latex
kpsewhich -show-path tex -progname latex

It is easy to understand these commands after playing some time with
them even without reading the manual of kpathsea. And looking at the
output of the commands you can see that there are several areas all of
which mimic the same directory structure of texmf-dist.

A. Imagine that you work on multiuser environment and a user wants to
make a private file not visible to other users. The best place for
such files is under $HOME/texmf. Let's suppose that Tweedledum makes
his macro file /home/tweedledum/texmf/tex/newbattle/macros.tex and
Tweedledee makes his private file
/home/tweedledee/texmf/blackraven/macros.tex. When any of them writes
\input macros, he will get his own file. If they give the file to
Humpty Dumpty, it will not work because neither Tweedledum's nor
Tweedledee's  directories are on the Humpty Dumpty's search path (and
he may have his ow different macros.tex). I am not sure whether $HOME
is used in Windows. It will definitely cause problems in OS/2 and eCS.
In such a case use B or C as described below.

B. You have a file (package) that should be used by several users and
is not included in TL and will never be there. You put such a
file/package under texmf-local/tex. Remember that texmf-dist is
searched before texmf-local and texmf-local is outside the root of TL.
If the file with the same name appears in a future version of TL, your
file will be inaccessible. That's why I say that descriptive names are
important.

C. You need version 2 of package X with new important features but
TL2007 contains version 1. If you put it to texmf-local, TeX will
still see version 1. You can edit texmf.cnf so as to change the search
order but it is not a wise solution. Imagine that time passes, you
install TL2008 containing package X version 3 but if you change the
search order too, because you need version 6 of package Y, TeX will
see version 2 of package X. OK, you delete package X from texmf-local
because you no longer need it. Then you for some reason need to
process an old file with TL2007 and it will see again version 1 of
package X. It is clear that texmf-local is not a good place for such
packages. If the new version should be visible only to one user, put
it to his or her  $HOME. If the package should serve all users, put it
to texmf-var which is always below the TL root. Adopting this scenario
--- and without modifying texmf.cnf --- TeX in TL2007 will find
version 2 of package X under its texmf-var, TeX in TL2008 will find
version 3 of package X under its texmf-dist --- and it will work so
automatically without any manual administration.

Moreover, if a few users work on the document that requires such a
package or file, then each of them might have it in another path. If
the document relies on absolute paths, users will have problems. If
they decide whether it is case B or C and put the files to respective
directories on their computers, the document will be processable by
all of them. It is always wise to assume that a file, which is private
today, may become useful for someone else in the future.

I hope that this long message explains the solution.

We should rather say under TEXMFHOME, whatever that is set to.

Isn't it possible to define TEXMFHOME on a per-user-basis on any
mulituser system?  I think it should be possible even on Win95.

Dear TeX Live people,

down here in the Debian Bug Tracking System, we got a report
regarding a file missing from the packages. As the Debian TeX Live
packages are just a copy of the original TeX Live I guess it is
missing in upstream too.

Plase have a look!

I think this was a long and helpful e-mail, Zdenek, but the last sentence
of the fragments I have left intact indicates what I perceive as the
heart of the problem.  Suppose that I develop a package "Cropmarks.tex",
for my own use, and I place it "under texmf-local/tex", as you recommend.
And suppose that at some point in the future, someone else working
on the same task uploads /their/ version of "Cropmarks.tex", which
then makes its way in a subsequent release of TeX Live to texmf-dist.
At that point, I have followed all of your guidelines (especially those
recommending descriptive names and file placement), yet I can no longer
access my version of "Cropmarks.tex" as I used to be able to.

Now I am prepared to accept your argument that absolute locations
are, in general, a Bad Thing [tm] (even though that is exactly
what Steve is asking for advice about, so cannot be ignored);
yet TeX Live's default configuration of searching texmf-dist
/before/ texmf-local is surely insane.  Is it not ?

I have not designed TeX Live's search path so that I can only guess. I
think that texmf-local was intended for packages, then can be found
somewhere but for some reason cannot be included in TL (e.g. their
license does not allow redistribution). It should not matter if such a
package later becomes a pert of TL. For my own packages I created
another path, texmf-devel which is a sibling of texmf-local. After
installation of a new version of TL I just do small modifications in
texmf.cnf. I have to add my texmf-devel and a CVS working copy of the
Velthuis Devanagari package to the beginning of the search path. My
texmf.cnf thus contains:

% Devanagari CVS development
DEVNAG = /home/zw/velthuis

% My development
TEXMFDEVEL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-devel
...

% Now, list all the texmf trees. If you have multiple trees you can
% use shell brace notation, like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
% The braces are necessary.
%
% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,!!$DEVNAG,!!$TEXMFDEVEL,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

And now I see that my previous information was wrong, I was confused
by the way how language.dat is searched for. The order is ...,
texmf-var, texmf, texmf-local, texmf-dist

language.dat is in texmf/web2c, so putting it to texmf-local/web2c
does not help.

Just a small note: I use texmf-local for additional packages developed
by someone else, texmf-devel contains my own development and these
files are mirrored from SVN working copies from my private SVN server.

Sorry for confusion in my previous mail.

Sorry, as I wrote in the previous mail, after having problems with
searching for language.dat I confused texmf and texmf-dist. So the

Was there a change? With TeX-Live 2007 TEXMFDIST will be searched last and 
_after_ TEXMFLOCAL. TEXMFMAIN will be searched before TEXMFLOCAL. Only with 
the openSuSE 10.3 texlive packages TEXMFDIST will be searched before 
TEXMFLOCAL. This bug was reported to the maintainer of the openSuSE texlive 
packages.

If you are using tools provided by TeX Live, like texconfig[-sys], all
changed/generated files will go into $TEXMF[SYS]CONFIG/TEXMF[SYS]VAR.

These directories are searched before the directories containing the
files provided by TeX Live.  The reason is that the latter are
read-only on a live system, they are on a DVD.

Whether texmf-local should be searched before or after texmf-dist
is an FAQ, but there is no solution which solves all problems.  In
most cases people just put their own stuff into texmf-local and they
are aware of name clashes and use reasonable file names.  If the
default configuration is not sufficient, texmf.cnf can be customized
quite easily.  If texmf.cnf has to be customized, in most cases it
makes more sense to add directory trees to the search path instead of
changing the search order.

BTW, Zdenek's search path looks quite like mine.  Where Zdenek has
$DEVNAG I have $VNTEX.  And, curiously, both obviously point to
subversion[1] working copies. :)

    Was there a change? 

No, the search order now is the same as 2007 and there are no plans to
change this.

TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,
$TEXMFVAR,
$TEXMFHOME,     <- ~/texmf
!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,
!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,
!!$TEXMFMAIN,   <- texmf
!!$TEXMFLOCAL,  <- texmf-local
!!$TEXMFDIST}   <- texmf-dist

Before someone asks (again), the reason why texmf is before texmf-local is
that texmf primarily contains system files, some (like pools) quite
tightly tied to the current binaries.  Thomas Esser told me that in
practice the other direction caused lots of confusion and trouble.
Anyone who really wants to override such things will have no trouble
changing TEXMF in the first place.

    I would like to know how to get the latest version for Windows and Mac

The latest TeX Live release for Windows is from 2007; see
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

For Mac, you probably want to install MacTeX, which is based on TeX
Live.  There have been a few small MacTeX-specific updates since the TL
release, and you can download the latest from http://tug.org/mactex.

Hope this helps,
karl

Just for information, in fedora we have TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST
corresponding both with /usr/share/texmf, so we put TEXMFLOCAL before 
TEXMFMAIN:

TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

Subject: [tex-live] Some minor patches against Build/source and perhaps
 something more important about ICU
Message-ID: <20080229192723.1ae69f27@toz.strangled.net>

Hi all,

For the time we've been using texlive 2007 here, I've had to patch it a
(very) little bit and since I've been slacking, now I have patches
pending that I forgot to send back to you for a while :)

So here they are, of course comments are very welcome:

100_all_build_mpost_at_compile_time.patch: It has been reported that
mpost was built during make install target and not during 'make' /
'make all' target. This patch should correct this. Refs [1].


120_all_omegafonts_parallel_make.patch: It seems texk/web2c/omegafonts/
is not parallel make safe due to a dependency problem in the makefiles.
This patch should correct this. Refs [2].


Now something that is probably more important: ICU has had a security
issue recently discovered (refs [3,4,5,6]). I've never been able to
make xetex build against system icu (either it uses internal headers or
icu does not install correctly all its headers; due to some things I've
seen in their headers I tend to think its the latter but I never really
jumped into that one); anyway, the fact is that it uses its own icu
copy that is vulnerable. I've patched this locally (better safe than
sorry) but I'm not sure if this vulnerability can affect xetex or not.
I don't know if its exploitable nor anything else, but I thought it
would be good to notify you about this.

Regards,

Alexis.

Hi Alexis,

Thanks for your report - see comments below.

No, xetex cannot build against the system ICU because it uses some  
extensions to support OpenType functionality that is not (yet)  
available in the standard library. (Naturally, I hope that in due  
course the necessary features will be added in ICU, at which point  
we'll be able to use the system lib, but we're not there yet.)

I don't believe so. The issues described in these reports relate to  
regular expression processing, but xetex does not make any use of the  
ICU regex functions.

I'll be updating the ICU code to release 3.8.1 shortly (it's in place  
in the xetex repository, but the new version is not yet merged to  
texlive). I'd be happy to apply a patch for this issue, too, although  
as xetex does not use that part of ICU, it's not an urgent problem.

Jonathan
