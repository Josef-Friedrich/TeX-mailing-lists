Subject: [tex-live] updates for TeX Live 2008
Message-ID: <200808010025.m710P2M16432@f7.net>

We are nearing the end of the release cycle for TeX Live 2008.
No drop-dead date yet, but we're getting close.

So, if anyone is contemplating package updates that they'd like to see
on the DVD, please get them to CTAN as soon as possible.

At least this is less critical than it may have been in previous years,
since we can provide updates after the release that users can easily get
from the Internet, using the new dynamic package system that is the
principal new feature this year.

By the way, if anyone wants to help test before the DVD's get burned,
see http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

Thanks,
Karl

It doesn't. Is the following normal?

./install-tl --portable
Platform universal-darwin not supported

Hum, from my working copy :

mpg at thue:~/tl/svn/Master% svn log --limit 1 install-tl
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r9950 | siepo | 2008-07-31 21:04:10 +0200 (jeu, 31 jui 2008) | 2 lines

install-tl, $opt_portable: suppress spurious warning about TEXMFCNF

------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpg at thue:~/tl/svn/Master%

So it's probably not the newest (which is going its way through the mirror as
we speak, as usual).

The good news is, Norbert took care of this yesterday, so that even if the
database is "broken" (in this case, it was just a typo in a package's name) it
issues a clear error message and continues anyway.

Please try again with a newer installer, this should really work now with
Norbert's work (and since the typo in the database is fixed, too) and complain
if it doesn't.

Thanks for your report,
Manuel.

The output of "texconfig conf" starts with a section "version
information". Does TL2008 offer meaningful information there? If not,
that's the place it should be.

It's not that there is a need, and of course it's
impossible to retrospectively fix all earlier
TL release,s but if the team could agree now that
there will be one, consistent, easily interrogated,
means of ascertaining the version number / date of
release of a TL installation from now on, then
this may well prove useful.  If (and this is
a very big "if") the system could also record
and report if any incremental upgrades have been
applied since the base installation, that might
also help in debugging problems that are reported.

Aehm, I was talking about a Win32 menu item .... to cite what I wrote:

Ah ok, but what is the need for that? BTW, that is the documentation,
...
------------

My remark was about
	Start->Programs->TeX Live 2008->whatever
whatever you mentioned before.

So I still stand to my comment that I see no use to make something
special for win32 (we already do quite a lot of things) to find the
version number.

texconfig conf, AFAIR did issue the release number in the last years,
and it will do that in 2008, too.

Yes.  

Previous releases of TL did not, because I only became aware of
texconfig conf this year.  Oh well.

no idea what you mean. I beat nothing, just typed ./Build. Is there
anybody out there who _can_ compile for x86_64?

I compiled the binaries with the default configure options
(--with-cxx-runtime-hack not needed) and they are not dynamically
linked against libstdc++, libgcc_s, and libpthread.

Please update to rev 10010 and test it.

BTW, when I run xindy without any arguments I now see a help message.
The binaries provided by Vladimir crashed with an error message
complaining about a missing OS library.  Vladimir, do the new binaries
work for you?

Use
	tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev
(but ATTENTION!! That will change soon to tlnet/2008 !!!, you will have
to change it again after we have done the switch)
followed by
	tlmgr update --all

And reading 
	tlmgr --help
might help, too.

If you have perl/Tk installed (or you are running Windows) you can also
start
	tlmgr gui

Do you mean after this switch will has been done, all the packages I downloaded from the texlivetest2008 cann't be reused for the final distribution?

OK, if I start with the last point, I can then more
easily work backwards : under Win32, there is no
command "texconfig", so that route cannot be used
to ascertain the version number.  (Checked using
the 2007 release).

Which means that under Win32, an alternative route
to checking the version number is needed.  As Win32
is (as its name implies) a Windows system, a
Windows-based route (as opposed to a command-
line route) would be more natural for Windows
users.  The latter are very used to "Help / About"
displaying the version number (something I find
astonishingly counter-intuitive, I might say :
as a naive Windows user (ex-VMS) I was very
frustrated to find that the last thing that "Help
/ About" gave me was any /useful/ information
about the program !  So to summarise :

a) "texconfig" doesn't work under Win32
b) Start / Programs / TeX Live / Help / About
	would be the natural place for Windows
		users to expect to be able to
			find the version number.

Neither of these demonstrate a /need/ for this
functionality, but that was never my claim :
I simply asserted that it would be useful,
a claim to which I still stick.

which library is missing? i don't see any library in my xindy.run which
is missing compared to your xindy.run.

 RK> Vladimir, do the new binaries work for you?

yes. thanks. i replaced the binaries because the previous one was faulty
(since then i fixed this in ordrules.h, but did not yet fully analyze
the bug, and you built with the patched sources which are not fault, so
no need to replace it).

I ask to test xindy on the remaining architectures:

alpha-linux       - ?
amd64-freebsd     - ?
i386-freebsd      - ?
i386-linux        - tested, works
i386-openbsd      - ?
i386-solaris      - ?
powerpc-aix       - tested, works
powerpc-linux     - ?
sparc-linux       - ?
sparc-solaris     - tested, works
universal-darwin  - tested, works (both i386 and ppc)
win32             - tested, works
x86_64-linux      - tested, works

Phil, wouldn't be enough for you to have under windows just
Start->Programs->TeX Live 2008
                 =============
menu? We have already that. So, imho, no need to put extra
Start->Programs->TeX Live 2008->About

No, it means that only the url changes.  You can still update your
system using tlmgr.

0.999.4 was a very recent update, Jonathan, is there something broken

I just did a Build to get 0.999.4 for linux, and that appears to be working, so
this looks like a Win32 or maybe a wine issue.  I hope someone with real
Win32 can confirm the problem.

but of course this isn't the W32 build. (I didn't even know that had  
been updated already.)

I'll try to find time to look at it more later this evening....

What does the story.log file show?

Akira, could there have been some kind of problem with the W32 build?  
The latest code seems to run fine elsewhere, and I can't see why the  
(tiny) changes in 0.999.4 might have introduced this issue.

On windows XP, both of "xetex story" and "xelatex sample2e"
run fine. However on Vista, both of them sometimes succeed
and sometimes fail with access violation (weird).
I'll investigate the problem.

If it's related just to the last build, as it seems to be, we could
simply revert to the previous binaries.

It was necessary to update "dll caller" xetex.exe etc.,
since xetex.lib is largely different from the very old one,
which I was using. I think the problem is not related to
the latest update. I'm not aware of the problem, since I usually
work on XP. Anyway, xetex is now running fine on both of XP and Vista.
So I hope it will also work on wine.
New one will be in svn probably tomorrow.

Thanks,
Akira

Im using a TL 2008 distribution from Dick Koch (MacTeX), early July,

There are more differences. I don't think they are on purpose ...

Message-ID: <4894C844.5080507@free.fr>

Hi Werner and everybody,

Trying to recompile older files in modern and traditional Chinese with 
TL2008 for testing, it seems to me that the following files, present in 
Debian's TL Lenny (current version based on TL2007), are missing in 
TL2008 (2008/08/02):
-- c10gkai.fd   and c10gkai.fdx
-- c00bkai.fd  (but c00bkai.fdx is in TL2008)

Is it intended? My test files compile again and are previewed properly 
when I had the Debian's versions of these three files to my TEXMFHOME 
directory.

After installaing TL2008 as root on Linux Debian Lenny, I notice that

Hi all,

When I install the tl2008test, I meet the following info:

Couldn't find language file installer/lang/perltk-zh.pl: No such file or directory

Is this harm?   Furthmore, how can I solve this issue?

Sincerely yours,

I recommend you update the CJK to the latest version in the offical page of CJK.
To do this, just put the latest CJK to your TEXMFHOME, then update the finename databse.

Hi all,

I want to use the command:

kpsewhich --format="web2c files" updmap.cfg 

to locate the udpmap.cfg, but the above command doesn't work on windows xp.

Any hints would be appreciated.

It works here on windows xp. Did you type udpmap.cfg or updmap.cfg?

Hi Daniel,

this problem was reported on Juli 29, 2008 and should be solved soon. 
May be your mirror isn't up to date or not all containers are updated till 
now, see below.

A postscript to my previous answer : if

	Start->Programs->TeX Live 2008

launches /something/ (a program, a file,
<whatever>, then is it possible for

	Start->Programs->TeX Live 2008->TeX Live Package Manager

(for example) to work ?  My understanding was
that one could not both launch a program/file/w-h-y
from a shorter version of a Start sequence and
still be able to launch a program/file/w-h-y from
a longer version of the same sequence.

If I make a copy of that file to my TEXMFHOME dir according to the TDS structure,  then the command will find it.  But besides the dir, the command will find onthing, the same case for config.ps when using 

kpsewhich --format="dvips files" config.ps

to locate the config.ps in my windows xp box.  I don't know the reason.

Correct command is
kpsewhich --format="dvips config" config.ps

I suspect you define some of variables TEXMF, TEXMFCNF, etc. yourself.
If I'm right, please undefine all ot them.

What are the results of
kpsewhich --expand-braces "$TEXMF"
and
kpsewhich --expand-braces "$TEXMFCNF"

Thanks,
Akira

Right, we will update the containers for the rename step, but not before
not to generate useless traffic between the mirrors. It is testing still
;-) As soon as we switch to tldnet/2008 we will have 0/0 containers.

No harm at all, only that there is no translation of the installer into
that language available.

If you want to fix that, please take the attached files
(perltk-en.sample), rename it to perltk-zh, put it into
tlpkg/installer/lang, and translate the strings. The file must be saved
in UTF8. If done it would be great if you could send us back the file so
that we can include it. But please test it with the installer.

Thanks a lot and all the best

Hi all,

The  ActivePerl is a free perl engine under windows:

Can I use it to substitute the perl engine in tl2008 under windows to perform some jobs such as: updmap?

There is no source available, and we cannot ship it on a DVD to be sold
by whoever.

So no.

> Can I use it to substitute the perl engine in tl2008 under windows to perform some jobs such as: updmap?

In principle yes, but why do you want to? The shipped perl is quite
small and will not interfer in any way with the rest of the system. No
environmental variables, not path changes, nothing.

Did you do that with
	updmap-sys --enable Map XXXX.map
	updmap-sys
(the -sys variant makes it available for *all* users, ie in TEXMFCONFIG;
while the variant without -sys does the same in your home directory
%USERPROFILE%:

The output of updmap(-sys), does it list the map file you installed?

Thanks for your hint.  CJK latest version seems to be 4.8.0 on
http://cjk.ffii.org/ and on CTAN as well...  The three files I
mentionned are missing on CTAN (and thus on TL2008).  As both bkai and
gkai fonts are part of CJK, I would expect the corresponding .fd files
to be also part of CJK. Am I missing something?

Those files have never been part of TeXLive (and never been part of a
released CJK package too).  Since we now have all four Arphic fonts in
TeXLive, this is an omission.  I've fixed it in the git repository of
the CJK package; I hope to upload a new CJK version soon.

Thanks for finding this bug!

Evidently the font is not in pdftex.map.

On Unix, running updmap does update pdftex.map (and dvipdfm.map) as well
as psfonts.map for dvips.  I don't know about Windows, I've never looked
at that updmap.

Perhaps you could just copy the entries from your psfonts.map, assuming
they are there, to pdftex.map.

Good luck,

I don't know why that would be, but FYI, in TL'08, I changed kpsewhich
to know the right formats for the common config files (config.ps
dvipdfmx.cfg fmtutil.cnf glyphlist.txt mktex.cnf pdfglyphlist.txt
pdftex.cfg texmf.cnf updmap.cfg) by default, so you don't need to
specify a --format at all.

Also, you can use --all to report all the matches for a file (useful
mostly for debugging "shadow" files, as you seem to have here).
  
Finally, note that kpsewhich --debug=-1 ... will report just about
everything that is being done.

>From your message, I also discovered that something like
kpsewhich --format=junk foo.tex
does not give an error message.  (It just defaults to "tex".)  Too late
to fix that now, but I will eventually.

The cid-x.map that is in fonts/map/dvipdfm/dvipdfmx comes from, as you
might expect, dvipdfmx.

The cid-x.map that is in the cjk doc comes from, as you might expect,
CJK.

So the fact that there are differences between them does not surprise
me, given that they are maintained totally separately.

Perhaps Werner and ChoF should get together and sync the files, or
perhaps it's not worth the trouble.  I wouldn't hazard to guess.  They
are both on this list, so they can decide :).

As far as the actual running of dvipdfmx goes, only the one in texmf
matters.

Subject: [tex-live] Debian TeX packages for Etch now on backports.org
Message-ID: <20080804004643.GI8207@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

Some news concerning the backports of TeX Live 2007 Debian packages to
etch. I have stopped to provide my own binaries and switched to using
www.backports.org. Advantage of that is that we will have uptodate 
binaries for all different architectures, not only for those I manage to
compile for or ask someone to compile for.

For you that means:
- the installation source for texlive-bin has changed, please see
  http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions
  on how to use the backports service. In a nut shell:
  . add 
    deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main
    to your /etc/apt/source.list
  . call aptitude update
  . install any package with
    aptitude -t etch-backports install texlive-base-bin ....

- all arch = all packages (i.e., all the others) can be either taken
  from the testing repository with pinning (see again the above page
  for detailed descriptions), but I will continue to have them
  around in my repository on people.debian.org.

So to some the situation up:

texlive and tex-common
 	deb http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ tl2007/
 	deb-src http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ src/

texlive-bin
	deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main
	deb-src http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main
	(but the source is also available from the above location)

lmodern
	deb http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ lmodern/
	deb-src http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ lmodern/

context
  	deb http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ context/
 	deb-src http://people.debian.org/~preining/TeX/ context/


The package has been accepted into backports.org only today, so
currently there are only i386 binaries, but soon there should be all the
other archs, too.

I hope that this service integrates better into the normal backport
world most people are using.

If you have any questions, just let me know.

Best wishes

Norbert

Some time ago I added some lines of code which allows you to run the
updmap script provided by Fabrice on Unix systems too.  As far as I
remember the difference is that Fabrice's script runs "dir" always and
the script we have in TeX Live runs "ls" instead if it detects that
it's on Unix.

texmf/scripts/tetex/updmap.pl is currently used on Windows only but it
should be possible to test it on Unix systems as well.

It's not worth the trouble.  As explain in the CJK docs, the cid-x.map
file given in the doc area is for demonstration purposes only.  People
who use CJK fonts need to adjust it anyway.

Sorry this time I cannot reproduce the crash on
windows 2000, xp and vista.
It is weird that reviously "xetex story" worked on wine
"with exactly the same binaries" if you reinstall.

You mean the message "Missing character: There is no ??? in font
cmr10!"?
On miktex (xetex .992) you can avoid it by using 
\XeTeXdefaultencoding auto

But the result is the same. "Evince" instead of "kpdf" starts. What is

I can reproduce the crash on xp and w2k, although xelatex doesn't
crash on all files. On vista, sample2e is ok and story compiles the
first time around but not next times.  Deleting story.* doesn't
help, deleting xetex.fmt does help.

After a crash, the logfile mentions `access violation'.

Might it be that the new xetex depends on Windows components which
are not always present on Western Windows versions?

Hmm, reading the source code I see:
        viewer_pdf  = os.getenv ("PDFVIEWER"),
        viewer_ps   = os.getenv ("PSVIEWER"),
        viewer_dvi  = os.getenv ("DVIVIEWER"),
        viewer_html = os.getenv ("BROWSER"),
        viewer_txt  = os.getenv ("PAGER")

So I assume it should be simply
	PDFVIEWER

I try

As the result the program "Evince" starts and shows me the documentation

export TEXDOCVIEW_pdf='(kpdf %s) &'

Why doesn't start the program "kpdf"? I work on Linux with KDE 3.5.9

My older texdoc (unknown version, <= 2004) uses TEXMFDOCVIEW_pdf.

It's quite irritating if every texdoc version uses another
environment variables. I would keep TEXDOCVIEW_* and the other
if TEXDOCVIEW_* is unset. (similar to first_in_path).

  viewer_pdf = os.getenv("TEXDOCVIEW_pdf");
  if viewer_pdf == nil then viewer_pdf = os.getenv("PDFVIEWER");

(Or something more elaborate, supporting variable settings in texmf.cnf).

Famous, but still experimental. The readme discourages people to distribute it
before version 1.0, and the author indeed told me by mail that he prefers we
don't include it in TL'08, even though our new update mechanism.

The latex3 stuff is included in TeXLive and it is also experimental. I 
know that many people use biblatex. No one must do it. It would be 
necessary if I can download the package via "tlmgr".

but the latex team asked that latex the stuff be included, whereas
philipp asked that _his_ stuff not be included.

things like tex live (or ctan, for that matter) only work if we make an
effort to respect people's wishes.

Experimental or not, if it is on CTAN in principle we can include it.
Its my impression, too, that biblatex is gaining audience a lot.

Of course, we can always add that package also later to the distribution
and make it available via tlmgr, but having it in now also seems not a
too bad idea.

I leave that up to Manuel and Karl.

Technically, we can: it's free software etc (though I'd really like to see the
source of the doc one day, but this is another matter).

But I had the impression (see siunitx or I don't which one of SI* it was) that
for stuff in ctan/experimental we usually ask the author what he thinks.

Maybe it is best to include it later. This way, we make sure that the only
people ho get it form TeX Live are those who update regularly and avoid that
in two years there is still an old version in use from the people who just
install from the DVD and never update later.

I leave that to Karl :-) but my opinion is clear: I think it's a bad idea to
ignore the author's whishes. even if as a user I'd prefer to have it in TL (I
can't use "old-style" bibtex since I discovered biblatex).

Agreed. It's not event released and already many users complained. I was

In r10073:

        or os.getenv ("TEXDOCVIEW_pdf") or os.getenv ("TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF"),

The more elaborate thing is the set_config_list which eats the above list, and
takes care of merging it with what comes from the config files (envvar have
precedence). You can set the viewers in texdoc.cnf, not in texmf.cnf, since I
think it's not a very good place for user's personal settings.

The new names are not new names but established generic ones.
Personally I'd prefer using the following hierarchy:

PDFVIEWER.texdoc
TEXDOCVIEW_pdf (output warning message that it is deprecated)
PDFVIEWER

>> (Or something more elaborate, supporting variable settings in

The above scheme mimics texmf environment massaging apart from the
middle bit...

Oh really? Of course PAGER and BROWSER are well-know, nut for the others 
I searched a bit and didn't find any well-established name. I'm glad to 
learn that this choice is indeed well-established names.

Do you have references of other programs using it?

But, while I perfectly see what distincts TEXINPUTS.latex and 
TEXINPUTS.xelatex can be good for, I don't understand the purpose of 
PDFVIEWER.texdoc.  I mean, you generally have only one prefered viewer, 
don't you?

There has never been ecrm1700. Please use ecrm1728 instead. You can always
made such ecrm1700.mf, though.

Environment variables that contains "TEXDOC" (or "texdoc")
are specific for "texdoc". The "new" names are generic names
that are used for many programs (e.g. PAGER). Usually the
specific names overwrite the generic ones. Therefore I would
prefer:
  viewer_pdf = os.getenv("TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF")
               or os.getenv("TEXDOCVIEW_pdf")
               or os.getenv("PDFVIEWER);

    But I had the impression (see siunitx or I don't which one of SI* it was) 

BTW, siunitx is now in TL, per the author (the prolific Joseph Wright)'s
wishes.  And it's not in exptl any more, either.  Two non-coincidental
things ...

    for stuff in ctan/experimental we usually ask the author what he thinks.

And by default we leave it out.

And further BTW, the LaTeX 3 packages are not in exptl (any more),
though granted they are experimental in nature.

    biblatex

Right, if the author explictly does not want us to distribute it, we don't.

Hi,
first of all, it seems that David has texmf.cnf settings in mind when
he suggests "PDFVIEWER.texdoc", right?

We had a long dicussion about this.  There is only one texmf.cnf file
for all platforms but not all browsers are available on all
platforms.  Not all users have the same preferences.  texmf.cnf is not
appropriate for per-user settings.

The result of this discussion was that there is a config file now.
This is the preferred way to customize texdoc.  See:

   texmf/texdoc/texdoc.cnf

If you want to change anything, put only the variables you want to
change into $TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf.  In multi-platform
environments you can have $TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc-<platform>.cnf
which allows you to specify browsers for a particular platform.
<platform> is the name of the corresponding directory in bin/.

I usually discourage people from setting environment variables for
many reasons.

Manuel, 

 > I mean, you generally have only one prefered viewer, don't you?

the old version of texdoc pointed me to the catalogue if no
documentation for a particular package had been found.  Though my
favourite html browser is firefox, I have TEXDOCVIEW_html='lynx %s' in
my environment.  It's quite nice because lynx starts immediately in
the terminal in which I run texdoc while firefox is quite clumsy.
When I really need another browser I can simply type:
TEXDOCVIEW_html='firefox %s' texdoc foo  

David,

 > > The new names are not new names but established generic ones.

using them can be a problem.  People are not aware about env vars,
especially if they didn't define them themselves.  They might wonder
why changes in the config file have no effect if env vars overwrite
settings in the config file.  Hence I think it's better to stick with
the old vars (TEXDOCVIEW_html).  If they already exist, people had
set them deliberately and are aware of them.  I recommend to remove
these env vars though, it's cleaner to set them in the config file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I completely agree on this point. texmf.cnf is definitely not the good place
for this. But this doesn't prevent us from selecting names resembling those of
texmf.cnf, since they are familiar.

On points raised by David:
The fact that the new names are generic is intentional. As a user, I don't
want to set 42 variables for just the pager for all my favourite applications.
But you and Reinhard seem to think it is desirable to be able to override
these generic settings, so ok.

On points raised by Heiko:
I completely agree that specific settings must override generic ones. It's
just that on the beginning I didn't consider TEXDOC* as specific settings, but
as compatibility sugar to be thrown away sooner or later.

What I currently plan to do is to accept PDFVIEWER_texdoc, TEXDOCVIEW_pdf,
TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF, PDFVIEWER in this order of precedence, and issue a warning
for the 2nd and the 3rd as I keep them only for compatibility and in the long
term I definitely don't want to keep 4 variables for just one function (and
similarly for others of course).

Time to sleep now, I'll do this tomorrow so you have all the night to object
if you want to :-)

Thanks all for your comments,
Manuel.

xetex font handling is different from the rest of texlive, but I'm not sure how
much of that is used with story.tex.

In case anyone can decipher it:

I'll build new XeTeX (xetex.exe and a small xelatex.exe) tonight.
There is no xetex.dll. Please test them.

I sometimes use my system in powershadow mode (http://www.powershadow.com)  to avoid the system from virus,  in this case, I can copy all of my installed files of TL2008 from C:\Program Files to a customized folder for my testing.  When I restart my system, the perl built in TL2008 will not be found by updmap at all, so I must install a perl by myself for the purpose.

I have checked in the binaries into the TeX Live svn repository. 

The .tar.lzma will be rebuilt only tonight, and mirrored to CTAN
tomorrow, so either fetch them from the svn repository of wait until
tomorrow afternoon.

In fact, I finally find that the issue is  caused by my misspell a map file's name in the config.ps and updmap.cfg, shame on me.

Furthermore, I find other issues: 

1- If I put the config.ps and updmap.cfg according  to the TDS in the TEXMFHOME directory, than the updmap commmand will not update the corresponding map customized by me; if the  config.ps and updmap.cfg  are put into the TEXMFMAIN directory, the updmap commmand will update the corresponding map customized by me correctly.

2- Even the config.ps and updmap.cfg has been put the right place in TEXMFMAIN directory according to the TDS, the updmap-sys command will not update the corresponding map into the required files, but the updmap  command will do, why?

I've copied all of the files in the texlive directory under the C:\Program Files, is this adequate?

Did you add the

(or whatever/whereever you installed it) to the PATH environment? That
is the only thing needed.

Specifically, with macports Perl/Tk.

I just installed Perl::Tk using cpan  and /usr/bin/perl, following the
advice at:

<http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/macosx/>

With this installation, the simple test script works, and so does
"install-tk --gui".

I should mention that I'm running this from a PC with Xming, so there may still
be some issue for X11 on MacOSX.

Hi everyone,

I know it is TL2008 time, but I still get bug reports for TL2007 on
Debian.

There is one quite funny:

----- End forwarded message -----

The point is here:
- you have to use xelatex
- you have to use 
	\usepackage{fontspec}

fontspec defaults to lm-default, ie latin modern default fonts.

But why does it switch to lgr encoding.

Our current babel ships these two files (lgrlmr.fd and lgrlmro.fd), so
would it be a solution to just copy those files to the TL2007 dir and
let it be gone? Or is there a different solution possible?

Best wishes and thanks for any comments/remarks/enlightenment

Norbert

Bummer ... could that be the jadetex/latex/jadetex/latex/jadetex/latex
format creation cycle???

We had that in Debian in 2007 AFAIR. Frank hacked together some patches
to fmtutil-sys, but I am not sure.

The problem is that:
- jadetex should be built before latex
- jadetex asks for the latex format
- latex format is built but saved into a non searched place
- jadetex is tried again, again building latex
- latex format is built but saved into a non searched place
- jadetex is tried again, again building latex
- latex format is built but saved into a non searched place
...

you got the point. 

Karl, Jonathan, everyone with fmtutil mastery, can we fix that please?

Zhao, can you please send a log file of that problem?

Best wishes

Norbert

It doesn't. babel (more exactly italian.ldf) is doing it. 

I would say (I haven't checked carefully) that the problem is that
fontspec not only set the font family to latin modern but also define
lmr to be the default fall back family and so latex no longer falls back
to lgrcmr but searches lgrlmr. 

In any case: language files that set encodings are problematic in xetex,
they can break the unicode support. It is best to either avoid them (and
use polyglossia instead) or to at least to load them so early that xetex
aware packages have chance to reset and overwrite as much encoding and
definitions as possible.

In this case it is enough if babel is loaded before fontspec, then
lgrcmr.fd is loaded.

    Furthermore, I find other issues: 

If you are running the Perl version of updmap, it has not been
maintained (aside from Reinhard's small tweaks to make it runnable on
Unix) for years, and therefore is unaware of the *SYS trees.

My advice is, don't use it.

Hi all,

I want to know there is a built-in viewer in tl2008 which is versatile, e.g., block compiling, double direction search between tex source file and the dvi file, and etc., I konw, some commercial latex editors, such as winedt, has all of this capabilities.

I don't understand : you ask (in the "Subject: "
field) about a DVI viewer, then comment later
in the body that some commercial editors (such
as WinEDT) have the capabilities you seek.

As WinEDT isn't a DVI viewer, it's not clear
why you think a DVU viewer might have such
functionality : I, for one, would not expect
any DVI viewer to offer block compilation;
that is a task for a front-end/intelligent
editor such as WinEDT.

Sorry for my expression,  I want to say that, the yap, which is the dvi viewer for miktex, can be integrated into winedt seamlessly.  So is there any dvi viewer for texlive which can do the same thing?

Ah, I understand : OK, all is clear.
I must leave it to the TeX Live team
to advise on which DVI viewer(s) are
bundled with TeX Live 2008, since I'm
still using TeX Live 2007 here ...

Just started investigating TeX Live 2008,
and followed the recommendation from Tug.Org
to download the network installer.  Opened

	file:///F:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/readme.html/readme.en.html

and attempted to follow link ("TeX Live documentation (html).") to

	file:///F:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/texlive-en.html

Told "The file /F:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/texlive-en.html cannot be found.
Please check the location and try again."

In fact, all three of

     * TeX Live documentation (html).
     * Links to all included PDF and HTML documentation.
     * The English TeX FAQ (pdf also available).

results in "... cannot be found" errors.

None. Or better none is installed by default, but some are present in
the support directory of the DVD.

Network install will not bring a dvi viewer, but psv, a postscript and
pdf viewer, free.

Thanks a lot, that is fine. But still it does not answer why italian.ldf
loads greek font support. I might have lost some of my Italian language

Aehmmmm.... your log file showed only that YOU did hit

If there is something else, please sent the correct log file excerpt,
but that what you sent looks completely normal, aside the interruption.

I've translate most of the strings into simplified chinese, but I've the following issues:

1-  Some of the strings don't appear on the gui during tl2008's installation, such as:

text.infoto:       info to
text.clicknetbin:  Click for net bins
text.outof:        out of
text.collof:       collections out of
label.binsys:      Binary System(s)

At lease, I cann't see them in the testing of its installation, why?

Due to all of the above don't appear in the testing installation in my case, I cann't judge which should be their appropriate counterpart in chinese.  Would you like give me some explains on the meaning of the above  strings?

2-  What's the difference between text.manto and text.infoto?  IMO, the manpage is infopage, so I don't know how to translate both of them in order to give both of them right meanings, any hints please? 

Sincerely yours,

PS  The attachment is the translated version by me, I post here just for your information.

That is gone, forget it.

That should appear in the line just ABOVE 
	----- Directory setup -----
in something like
	"83 collections out of 85, disk space required: 1695 MB"

> label.binsys:      Binary System(s)

"info to" 
	where info pages should be linked to, asks for a directory

"out of"
	used in
		Binary System(s)     3 out of 15     Change

rest see above.

No, man pages and info pages are different things, different formats.

Can you please translate the other strings, too, and sent the final
file. That would be great.

And, if I might ask, would it be possible to translate the strings of
the TeX Live Manager?? I can send you the english strings.

Thanks a lot and all the best

The babel documentation says that italian is doing it to get guillemets
when T1-encoding is not active/present. So you can avoid lgr completly
by first loading T1, then babel, then fontspec:

 \documentclass{article}
 \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
 \usepackage[italian]{babel}
 \usepackage{fontspec}

 \title{Italian}
 \begin{document}
 Italian "< 
 \end{document}

xetex is working on my real Windows XP system.   The binaries

1) The buttons comes very close to the right-hand edge

    might be further information that cannot be seen.

2) Highlighting and overtyping C:/Program files/texlive/2008
	in the dialogue box for TEXDIR does not work; new
	characters are highlit, and therefore deleted when
	the next character is typed.

3) Attempting to cancel out of this leads to CMD-box
	errors "Can't locate object method 'cancel' via
	package 'TK::After::Cancelled' at .../Widget.pm
	line 492"

4) "Use ~ for HOME/USERPROFILE" is not meaningful (to me).

5) TEXMFHOME (...) ~/texmf : the concept of tilde is
	not a Windows concept.  I would like to specify
	"My documents/TeX/ here, but there is no browse

The section that reads "Installation

  The installation script is now named install-tl,
  and has both GUI (default on Windows) and text
  (default on everything else) operation modes.
  You can force one or the other with the options
  -gui and -no-gui, respectively. "

is likely to confuse the more naive Windows user.
In fact, the installation script (for Win/XP)
is named "install-tl.bat", whilst "install-tl"
is a 46kb file which looks (to my untrained eye)
as if it were a Unix script.

Many thanks for the prompt reply, Staszek, but
to say "it follows CTAN convention" is rather
bending the truth, isn't it ?  These fonts
are to be found on CTAN at

     (ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/ctan:)/fonts/greek/cbfonts/fonts/type1/cbgreek

with a triple tautology for "fonts" (fonts/.../cbfonts/fonts/...)
and a double one for "greek" (.../greek/.../cbgreek/).  Thank God
TL-2008 doesn't /quite/ follow CTAN's lunacy here !

It is true that the text entry widget misbehaves a bit, but I have
had no trouble entering the desired text with help a bit of
clicking. I consider this a minor annoyance. It might be possible to
fix it by updating the Tk library, but it is rather late for that.

A browse button for the parent of TEXDIR would have been nice, but
would require too much redesigning of the GUI: asking users whether
or not they want the 2008 level etc. Again, too late for this
release.

Does anybody know whether the Unix version of the directory browser
supports creating a new directory?

I really mean it's not meaningful to me, not I'm
being deliberately opaque.  Tell me what it means
in plain English, and I'll try to come up with
a reasonable way of expressing it.

OK, browse not possible in timescale, but how about
offering a default that has a meaning in the
Windows world (which ~/texmf does not).

Noting how slow a network install of Scheme:full is
(I'm up to "functan", after one failure and several
elapsed hours), I wonder whether any thought has
been given (or is being given) to the idea of
integrating an extended TeX with the TeX Live Package
Manager ?  The idea I have in mind would require
the addition of one primitive, called (say) \Requires,
which would take as parameter the name of a TeX Live
collection.  The extended TeX would then liaise with
the Package Manager to see whether the required package
wa already installed, and if not, would ask the PM to
commence the download.  The idea can obviously be
extended to allow not only collections, but other
levels of granularity (such as languages) which the
PM supports, perhaps right down to the level of
individual files.  Is this work-in-progress, does
anyone know ?

we used to have an argument with the submitter every time a package was
submitted in tds format.  this was quite wearing, and we gave up.  so
that is the source of the final "fonts".

the basic structure of the directory predates my time, and with the most
recent submission of claudio's fonts we actually removed a bunch of
aliases for the original directory.  slightly earlier, i dealt with a
bunch of other oddities there, so that what you see there is less dotty
than we used to have.

if i ruled the world, i would decree that the ctan team should have
absolute discretion on naming packages.  sadly we don't have such an
enlightened leader, so the team struggles with that which is submitted.

since the details of the behaviour of i/o isn't specified in tex, it
doesn't need an extended tex, merely a jolly good library.

what you describe is achieved by miktex.  there's a database of all
files in the set of miktex bundles, and "open file" is allowed to fork
off a network process to retrieve a known file that's not currently on
disc (in fact it retrieves the package that contains the file).  (doing
this is subject to user control -- you don't _have_ to wait while files
are retrieved: you can elect to have "file not found" errors...)

note that this scheme doesn't have to worry about dependency
relationships.  which is nice.

Windows lacks a consistent definition of a user's "home" directory.
On linux/unix/macosx
there is a concept of a "home" directory that is the current working
directory for programs
started by the user.  In general, a user can only write files under
the home directory (or
in designated temporary directories, which in many cases are placed
under that "home"
directory (e.g.,, "/Users/<username>/texmf" becomes "~/texmf" or
"$HOME/texmf".  When
you have such a special directory it is useful to have a shorthand notation,
which the the role of the "~" (tilde).   At work we have Windows XP
and each user gets a
network mount of a personal "U:" drive.  Some programs store things
under "U:\", others under
"C:\Documents and Settings\<user>", so there are at least two
legitimate notions of what "~"
could mean.

OK, sounds good : I can't decide whether
an explicit \Requires is better than an
implicit lookup on a "file not found",
but I suspect that it is, since one might
have meant (let's assume that the user
wrote "\input cropmarks.sty") that a locally-
written file of that name was to be included
rather than something found at CTAN.  If
the file has an explicit "\Requires Cropmarks",
then it could be safely inferred that this
is a CTAN package (or collection : I skip over
that distinction for simplicity).

resumed but I noticed some "failed to create

more disturbingly, the CMD window has now

Strange, on my linux box it *is* working. Do you tell me on win32 it
does *not* work that way. Bummer.

Never had that, and I cancelled quite often. Might be again a Win32
thingy. Can anyone confirm that.

%USERPROFILE% is a windows variable which normally contains
	c:\documents and settings\USER

That is the best approximation of $HOME on win32.

See above. ~ is the %USERPROFILE% on win32 and $HOME on unix.

Ok, what is meant:
	If you use ~ in the string you enter then it will be expanded
	to the current settings of $HOME (on unix) and %USERPROFILE% (on

It *HAS* a meaning and should NOT be changed!!!

The point is: Immagine a windows system with more than 1 user, which is
possible! NOw if you set
	TEXMFHOME = c:/Documents and Settings/User1
then User1 will have good luck, but User2 will have to use User1
directories for saving *his* files.

Using 
	TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf
in texmf.cnf allows that *every* user (on unix and win32) can use his 
home dir (%USERPROFILE%/texmf on win32) to put files.

That is new in the Windows world, I agree, but Windows and Unix are
coming at least in TeX Live closer together.

Yup, yes, hmm. First, we cannot start the GUI if we resume. That does
not work. But that the cmd window disappears is bad. You probably double
clicked the install.bat...

No idea if I can work around that now. Siep, do you have any idea?

Thanks a lot, but I see a problem: How to distinguish beteen siplified
and traditional?

You reported that the installer told you:
	Couldn't find language file installer/lang/perltk-zh.pl: No such
	file or directory.
So it deduced only _zh from it.

Our modules take a look into the registry to find out that value. It
goes like this:
	Look into CurrentUser/Control Panel/International//Locale
and then look up that value in 
	HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/MIME/Database/Rfc1766/

Do you have any suggestion?

I would say we install the simplfied version as
	perltk_zh.pl

Or is there any other suggestion?

Best wishes

MikTeX has it, but without reliable connections to a
CTAN server, isn't going to be much help.  If your
access is like mine, it works better in the early AM,
but then you want a program to do the transfers
automatically.

I don't think network installs are suitable for everyone.
They make sense if you have a nearby reliable server,
as in a campus network with a local CTAN mirror, but
are problematic not only for texlive, but also for linux
package managers, if your network access is not
robust.

I too found network installs of TL very painful.  I gave that up
in favor of installing (using --location) from a local svn Master
directory.  I use rsync to maintain local repositories for TeX Live
and also MikTeX.  These get updated each night.   I'm
using linux, but the same can be done on Windows.

As I understand it (I just happened to read an article about this, I
actually know nothing about it :), the newfangled way would be zh-hant
and zh-hans.  And zh-cn is usually used in practice for simplified, whil
zh-tw or zh-tw are misused for traditional.

But the real question is what codes will actually work with systems
today, so the translation files will get used.

    I would say we install the simplfied version as

I assume you mean perltk-zh.

The problem is a different one, it is what our code returns ... the code
that peeks into the registry and tries to detect the language setting.

Yup.

I have committed bot variants, and a copy of the simplified one as
perltk-zh


BTW, Zhao, your UTF8 coded files were quite strange, they had some
hidden two bytes at the beginning, file declared the UTF8 with BUM
marker.

I had to remove them (the markers) (was not easy, vim didn't show them,
I had to use an hex editor) otherwise the code in our perl script
wouldn't work properly (we are reading in in bytes and convert then to
utf8 by hand).

I also think that the disappearing cmd is caused by something like
an unintended double-click.

The `failed to create cache' message comes from fc-cache. Caching
fonts by fc-cache is supposed to speed up xetex, bu xetex should
still run without. Anyhow, a failed fc-cache doesn't abort the
installer.

Staszek has reported that even if fc-cache initially fails, a
command `fc-cache -v -r' given in a new cmd might work.

I can'r see the difference between these two.

They both appear to be abbreviations of
Zhongguo-Taiwan, which would make sense
since the Taiwanese have retained the traditional
(pre-simplified) hanzi, but I assume that one
of the two should in fact have read differently ...

OK, I tried again, this time hoping to
catch the errors.  These are the last
few lines of the CMD window, which
unfortunately disappeared while I was
pasting this text in, so I cannot be
sure what happened next.  What really
concerns me is that I can find no trace
of a log file recording the fc-cache errors :
there is an "install-tl.log" in F:\TeX\Live\2008,
but searching it for "fc-cache" (or even
just "cache" : see first error) reveals no
hits ... these errors are presumably all recorded
somewhere, but where, please ?

By the way, despite the assertion that
TEXMFCNF is set, I can find no trace
of any setting using SET :

Sorry, at the moment nobody cannot catch why fc-config fails *during* 
installation. We discussed it here several times and it seems to me
that the problem should go to texlive-bug as still not resolved with a 
hint that "it is recommended to run fc-cache -r -v after installation".
Sorry again, but we have now more serious problems with xetex in win32...

This is because you have TEXMFCNF set from TL2007, as I recall.
Anyway, the rest of your messages looks OK by me. And TEXMFCNF seems
to be removed from your environment. If not, for further work, please
remove it yoursef, as the warning say.

OK, done that. it failed again. Transcript at-end.

I had already removed it, when it first threw the error, but
it still seems to think it is defined, even though SET says
it is not ...

Really?! Have you run install-tl.bat from the same cmd (still opened)
session? I tried several times to install and having set TEXMFCNF, but
never encounter that.

    - latex format is built but saved into a non searched place

I removed my latex.fmt and jadetex.fmt and ran jadetex foo, and it
created them both in the right order and installed them both.

Er, I wasn't using fmtutil-sys, though, just fmtutil.  But if
fmtutil-sys didn't work, then our default installation of creating all
formats wouldn't work.  

Maybe it's Debian-specific?

    Frank hacked together some patches to fmtutil-sys, but I am not
    sure.

If any diffs, please post.

    Karl, Jonathan, everyone with fmtutil mastery, can we fix that please?

As I think I wrote once before, if the problem persists, it seems to me
the most reliable way to solve it would be to change *jadetex.ini to
simply \input *latex.ini instead of using &latex in fmtutil.cnf, and
thus avoid recursive format creation.  Not that I've tried it ...

(I'm rather amazed that recursive format creation works at all.)

Fortunately I've reproduced your previous crash by compiling
on vista. I've identified that the access violation is occuring at
applytfmfontmapping().  Please give me some time.
I believe it will become more stable later.

I've managed to salvage my Texlive 2008 installation. The only things
that seem to have failed were mktexlsr and updmap-sys. I ran those
manually, from Texlive's install dir.

C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich.exe plain.tex

C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>texhash
texhash: Updating C:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-config/ls-R...
[...]
C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich.exe plain.tex
c:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/plain/base/plain.tex

Also, after I ran a few test documents through luatex, luapdftex and
xetex, I decide to change my path to include Texlive 2008 instead of
Miktex 2.7. Lo and behold, that had already happened automatically. It
looks like there's some logic for changing the PATH, but it wasn't
triggered soon enough in the installation process. BTW, a warning
would be nice before changing the PATH.

There were a couple more suspicious things going on. On the fmt
creation pass, I got some "mktexupd failed", but stuff worked normally
despite that. Below is the output while initializing xetex, but luatex
and luapdftex printed the same "mktexupd failed" message:

kpathsea: Running mktexfmt xetex.fmt
Running: xetex --ini --jobname=xetex --progname=xetex -etex xetex.ini <nul

No pages of output.
Transcript written on xetex.log.

The file xetex.fmt created.
Now I check executable files...
If some executable files do not exist, you must make them
by hard link (Windows NT/2000/XP) or copying (Windows 95/98/Me).

OK. xetex.exe exists.
[...]

But like I wrote above things worked normally after that.

Also, it looks like texhash uses the new lua library since it's
insanely fast, unless it's missing a lot of files somehow...

Thanks for your suggestion.

Due to my operating system's locale is simplified chinese, so I only and can only tested the the simplified chinese version of Perltk-zh.

I have a look at the above things in windows xp, in fact, this is not the most recent tags for all of these languages.  In short, please see the following url:

http://www.iana.org/assignments/lang-tags/zh-Hans
http://www.iana.org/assignments/lang-tags/zh-Hant

Furthmore, I don't have the traditional chinese's windows xp, so I don't know the corresponding name and code in the registry for traditional chinese.

I suggest a script should be written to do following things:

1-  We firstly predefined all of these tags for all of the languages according to the latest standard, and stored them in a file for the scipt to look up.
2- We name the Perltk-** according to the predefined names in the above step.
3-  Judge the locale of the operating system and then map its locale to the appropriate Perltk-**.

I cann't say more than the above.   The latest standard and the standard which will come into effect in the future can be used, IMO.

It looks like more things were broken in the installation.

Running
>mtxrun --script fonts --list
produced an error:

MtxRun | error unable to locate texmfcnf.lua
MtxRun | skipping configuration for C:/Program

MtxRun | unknown script: fonts

Then I ran

luatools --generate
luatools --ini --compile --verbose cont-en

The 2nd command also gave an error (looks like problem with space in path name):
<<error unable to locate texmfcnf.lua>>
<<skipping configuration for C:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c
from Documents and

Please type another input file name:

but after I ran "texexec --make --all --lua" then "mtxrun --script
fonts --list" finally worked. But the system fonts were *not* listed
despite the fact that OSFONTDIR = $SystemRoot/fonts// is present in
texmf.cnf. So, the system fonts work with XeTeX, but obviously not
with LuaTeX because of this.

Also "context --make" gave the same error that "luatools --ini
--compile --verbose cont-en", so context is completely broken.

Hope this feedback helps,
Vasile

The two files is saved by me in the format UTF8 with byte order mark (BOM),  I've removed them now, plese check them.

According to the above discussion, I renamed these two files into Perltk-zh-Hans and Perltk-zh-Hant, respectively, what do you think about it?

PS.  The attachments is the new renamed and BOM-deleted files.

Context+luatex comes un-configured on purpose, see this page

   http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Running_Mark_IV

on how to set it up. One thing not yet mentioned in that page
though: luatex does not properly handle filenames with spaces
in them yet (sorry). If filenames with spaces work at all, that
is just luck, not by design.

Best wishes,

MiKTeX-XeTeX had the same issue: a crash in applytfmfontmapping. See the 
"xelatex math problem with sqrt" thread (XeTeX mailing list).

It is explained more fully later on. `install-tl' is what you would
type on the command-line. So, while some people might get confused,
I still think that the explanation is appropriate for this place in
the manual.

fc-cache doesn't do logs, but intercepting stdout/stderr during
postinstall might be a good idea.

That is strange, really strange. We do add the TeX Live bin dir to the
PATH, but we put it *at*the*beginning*:
  debug("Prepending $plat_bindir to PATH\n");
  $ENV{'PATH'}="$plat_bindir" . "$pathsep" . "$ENV{'PATH'}";
So for the following commands "our" scripts should be used. I am really
surprised if that didn't work, and why?!

As written in the other email, I am surprised that the installation did
not changes the path temporarly by prepending "our" bindir. Anyway.

Regarding the changing of the PATH. Well ... if you install TeX Live you
want it, right? I guess we have no chance now to add some more options.

Known problem, but nobody could track it down to where it comes from and
why ;-) But it seems that it never did hurt anybody.

No, it doesn't. Or at least not that I know.

I remember this thread; didn't realize we might be seeing a similar  
issue with Akira's binaries too. Did you ever determine how the  
mapping could be left uninitialized? I thought I'd checked the code  
and it was supposed to zero the appropriate entry in the array, if no  
mapping is actually loaded (and therefore zeroing the entire array  
ahead of time shouldn't be needed).

If it's possible to load a tfm without correctly setting (or zeroing)  
the font_mapping array entry, that would be a bug that could  
potentially affect any platform, and we should fix it ASAP. But when I  
reviewed this previously, I couldn't see how that would happen. Any  
further details would be very welcome.

Thanks,

Jonathan

Done that. Calling

Yesterday I found that xetex (in wine) was working for input files
that specify fonts (Charis SIL), but not for the canonical "story.tex".

I have fonts.conf in two places (this is on a real XP system):

1.  bin/win32/conf:
[...]
<dir>c:/windows/fonts</dir>
<dir>c:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
<dir>c:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>

2.  texmf-var/fonts/conf:
[...]
<dir>C:/WINDOWS/fonts</dir>
<dir>F:/TeXLive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
<dir>F:/TeXLive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>

and from texmf.cnf:

% Default settings for fontconfig library, used by Win32 versions of
% xetex/xdvipdfmx (note that fontconfig on Linux/Unix-like systems
% will ignore settings in this file)
FONTCONFIG_FILE=fonts.conf
FONTCONFIG_PATH=$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf
FC_CACHEDIR=$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/cache

F:\TeXLive>kpsewhich -expand-var=$FC_CACHEDIR
F:/TeXLive/2008/texmf-var/fonts/cache

The cache files are indeed created in the above directory.

F:\TeXLive\2008\Testing\xetex>SET TEXMFSYSVAR=f:/texlive/2008/texmf-var
F:\TeXLive\2008\Testing\xetex>SET FONTCONFIG_FILE=fonts.conf

The C:/Windows/fonts/Fonts directory contains old myriad TTF fonts, while new
OTF versions are in windows/fonts.  What does fc-cache do when it finds
multiple font files with the same font name?  When I remove the
C:/Windows/fonts/Fonts directory I get:  "fc-cache: succeeded".

Message-ID: <489AD05E.7020407@Rhul.Ac.Uk>


I'll return to the FP_Cache / extended TeX
threads later, but I now have a new idea :

is there any way of performing a peer-to-peer
install of TeX Live 2008 using the package
manager ?  Having performed a full install on
one of my (six or so) systems at home, I would
like to take advantage of that to reduce both
the load on the Cambridge CTAN node and on the
network delays that are inherent therewith.  So
is it now possible for me to install on a second
and subsequent home system(s), using the first home
systemeas the master repository ?

I have discovered that files which use OTF text fonts work when  the
original story.tex and sample2e are failing, which seems consistent
with a problem using tfm's, and might implicate text fonts (since the
math fonts seem to work in my testing).

Many thanks!! I've confirmed that the newly compiled xetex on vista
does no more crash after initializing font_mapping[]:=0.
Jonathan, please initialize font_mapping[], since I don't want
to touch xetex.ch.

Hi, tlmgr developers:

I was using the program a few weeks ago, and everything were well.
However, today I ran the program to update the distribution,
it complained that it fails to install a package (I forgot which
package, sorry).
So I ran tlmgr again. and it appeared as follows:

[yuewang at localhost ~]$ sudo tlmgr update --all
Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Installation of packages is not supported.
Please report to texlive at tug.org.

I am using FreeBSD 8-CURRENT.
What exactly information (log?) should I provide to find out the
solution of the problem? Thanks.

Thanks, I was aware of the contextgarden wiki, that's where I've got
the commands from :) The problem is that texlive 2008 (on Windows)
defaults to paths that do have spaces in them, i.e. "Program Files".
Perhaps this should be changed for the release...

Depends how yo do it. On Windows changing the PATH in the registry
does not affect programs, especially command prompts, that are already
running.

A few days ago, Norbert added a test in tlmgr to check the the necessary
programs (tar, lzma, wget) are found and working. You get this message when on
of this test fails.

> I am using FreeBSD 8-CURRENT.

However, an early version of this test assumed all tar's had a --version
option, like GNU tar, which is not the case of some BSD tar's. This is now
fixed, but it looks like you're stuck with an old version.

I suggest that you update TLUtils.pm manually from the svn, or make a fresh
install with a recent version.

As Norbert already explained, we add the TL bin dir to the PATH and put
it at the beginning for the whole install-tl run (not stored in the 
registry!), then, at postinstallation time, we add TL bin dir 
*at the end* of PATH and store it in the registry.
So if you have, eg, MiKTeX bin dir also in PATH, please change the order
for running TL. That's all up to you.

     ========= this is because MiKTeX bin dir has precedence and 
mktexlsr=initexmf.

Sorry, we cannot change that for so many reasons (please read The TL

No. THe problem is that the schemes are not download to the
texlive.tlpdb.

But there are other options: Just *copy* everything from the install
root to the other computers. Then you only have to add the bin/win32 dir
to the PATH and you are done.

But tlmgr does not allow that (and probably will never).

(Alas, it might be possible to save the scheme.tlpobj into the
texlive.tlpdb, and then allow installation from an installed system but
only the possible scheme ... but I haven'timplemented it and I am not
sure I can do that soon)

Other options would be mirroring the CTAN tlnet directory.

Aha, I think I see how this could be happening. I have made a one-line  
change to xetex.ch that I believe will solve the problem (without  
requiring you to make additional patches for W32TeX or MikTeX).  
Checked in to xetex svn and texlive svn as v0.999.5.

Thanks for the reports; sorry to be so slow identifying the real  
source of the bug (I hope it's correct now!).

Should other bin builders start the whole build script, too? Or is that
a win-only problem? AFAIS from the discussion it occurs only on win, but
*could* in principle happen everywhere, right?

Yes, I believe it could.

Let's see if we can get confirmation from Akira and/or Christian that  
the change really does solve the problem. If so, it would be good to  
update the xetex binary wherever possible, even though we don't have  
reports of failure elsewhere.

That is great, Norbert, and certainly faster than any
peer-to-peer install (I can therefore burn the entire
install root to a DVD and move things around that way).
But once I've done so, and added the "bin/win32" dir
to the path[1], can I then use the package manager
from the systems onto which I've cloned my installation ?

> Other options would be mirroring the CTAN tlnet directory.

And presumably setting up an FTP server ?  Would such
a server have to offer Unix-style directory listings
in order to work with the script (everything at home
runs Windows -- XP or Server 2003) ?

Yes. But note that I have never tried it, but I am 99% sure that it will
work.

There is one thing you might want to do if you had xetex installed:
After adding bin/win32 to the path you can run
	fc-cache -v -c

> >Other options would be mirroring the CTAN tlnet directory.

No need, you can install from a file
	install-tl.bat -location /pat/to/the/main/dir/containing/tlpkg

> [1]  Incidentally, is there any reason why

Yes, we don't want to interfere with installed perls, and we don't ship
a full featured perl. But we cannot ship ActiveState Perl. So we decided
to ship a minimal perl (self compiled) and hide it.

> PERL, and it would save me (and perhaps others) from

But you would get a decent system, not a stripped down the minimals
system.

Argh : elsewhere "/" is used as a path separator,

That part I (sort of) understand, but my point was that
"~/texmf" is not meaningful to a Windows user, even if
internally it makes sense to the system.  So from a
documentation perspective, it would be better to use
a more platform-neutral convention ...

More when I've eaten : my brain is starting to shut down
from lack of food.

Perhaps we are talking about a different document.  I am
referring to readme.en.html, where it reads : "The installation
script is now named install-tl, and has both GUI (default on
Windows) and text (default on everything else) operation modes.
You can force one or the other with the options -gui and -no-gui,
respectively."  Now there is no suggestion that any command-line
work is required at all : I, like perhaps many users, interpreted
that (a la Windows) as meaning "Double-click on the file named
"install-tl" in order to launch the installer".  Of course, seeing
both "install-tl" and "install-tl.bat", I knew enough to double-
click on the latter, but even I (no immodesty intended) didn't
realise that double-clicking was not the intended launch method
and that I should first launch a CMD window ...

The whole issue of needing to first run CMD could be avoided
if "install-tl.bat" contained (rather than its present
contents) "%ComSpec% /K Do-install", where  "Do-install.bat"
would contain the present contents of  "install-tl.bat".

Hi again - sorry for the noise, but I've just figured out what the

Rebooting isn't necessary. The installer alerts the system of
changed environment variables.

This is a manual way of accomplishing this: open My Computer, click
properties, Advanced, Environment Variables, and then OK.

But if there are system-level environment variables and if you are
only poweruser and don't have administrative privileges then you
can't remove it.

No, there were three (perhaps four) system-wide
environmental variables starting with TeX
(including "TeX" itself, translating to
"TeX.exe", which has strangely come back
again), and I deleted all of them.  Anyhow,
further tests are probably worthwhile : the
more problems that can be eliminated before
/hoi polloi/ get their grubby fingers on
TL-2008, the better !

No other installer of which I am aware would add

I don't see what is the big deal; they are trivially easy to remove.

OK, this time I believe the real bug is fixed (xetex svn r.806,  
texlive svn r.10148). I was able to reproduce the crash on a non- 
Windows platform, and verified that with the latest change it no  
longer crashes.

Note that this update includes a string change and therefore affects  
dumped formats, so they will have to be rebuilt.

I thought that the purpose of inviting test installs
was to identify problems before TL 2008 goes live.
If the TL installer does things without the users
permission, then there will be complaints.  Now is
our chance to avoid those complaints, by making the
installer ask before doing things.  I have already
seen another test-installer express concern that
the path was modified without his/her consent; we
need to /listen/ to these complaints, not dismiss
them as trivial.

In principle you are right, but even if we are in testing mode, we
cannot rework that installer. Be sure that we listen to the concerns.
But there have been long discussions before.

Do you know how much any, I repeat *ANY* installer on windows changes in
the registry?? Install Nero, install PowerDVD, install ActiveState perl,
all of them will make serious changes to the registry.

The TL2008 installer does:
- add the bin/win32 to the PATH
- creates 2 shortcuts on the desktop

I have seen *MANY* programs creating desktop shortcuts without asking,
take firefox, take thunderbird, take loads of installers.

That we do NOT consider a serious problem.

And adding bin/win32 to the path does *only* interfer with another TeX
installation, and in this case, well, if you want two systems you should
know what you are doing.

And finally, all these changes are *undone*/*removed* when you uninstall
TL2008.

We are listening, but still some complaints are trivial, sorry.

Message-ID: <F78D538B-70DA-47F5-84E4-821BE381902E@jfkew.plus.com>

In addition to the recent xetex bug-fix, I have just checked in a fix  
for xdvipdfmx to resolve a stack-smashing (buffer overflow) issue that  
could arise when printing warnings about unrecognized \special  
commands (svn r.10149), if the special contained non-ASCII characters.

ChoF, this affects the original dvipdfmx as well as xdvipdfmx, as it  
is in the print_error routine from dvipdfmx. I have taken the liberty  
of applying the fix to dvipdfmx in texlive as well; here is the change  
I made:

Installing TeX Live 2008 from the net :
a review of the steps taken and of any
problems encoountered.

1) Visit Tug.Org, follow link to "TeX Live"
(http://tug.org/texlive/)

2) thence to "Downloads and other means of obtaining TeX Live"
(http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html)

3) thence to "small bootstrap installer available on CTAN"
(http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/README)

4) thence to "install-tl.zip "
(http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/install-tl.zip)

5) Receive ZIP file, unzip using WinZip

6) Note that paths within ZIP start at "install-tl",
    so unzip into O:\TeX\Live\2008

7) WinZip opens O:\TeX\Live\2008, I get /slightly/
    confused by directory called "readme.html", but
    eventually realise that correct starting point
    is file "index.html"

8) Open "index.html", all links functional

9) Follow link to "README, English"
(file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/readme.html/readme.en.html)

10) First two links are OK, next four are broken :
	
	texmf-doc/doc/english/ hierarchy, in both html and pdf formats.
	Translations to other languages are also available under texmf-doc/doc/*.

"texmf-doc/doc/english/" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english)
"html" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/texlive-en.html)
"pdf" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/texlive-en.pdf)
"texmf-doc/doc/*" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/)

11) Next four links are OK, but it is more
than a little disingenuous to speak of "gv",
"xpdf" and "Sumatra PDF" as being "free
alternatives to Acrobat" when the Adobe Acrobat
reader is also free (as in "a free lunch", which is
how the word "free" is used in the real world).  If
they are open-source alternatives, then why
not say so. And please link to the Acrobat Reader
download on the Adobe site; this is what most of
the world uses to read PDF.

12) The next four links are broken :

     * TeX Live documentation (html).
     * Links to all included PDF and HTML documentation.
     * The English TeX FAQ (pdf also available).

"TeX Live documentation" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/texlive-en.html)
"Links to all included PDF and HTML documentation" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/doc.html)
"TeX FAQ" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/FAQ-en/html/)
"pdf" -> (file:///O:/TeX/Live/2008/install-tl/texmf-doc/doc/english/FAQ-en/newfaq.pdf)

13) I suggest changing the wording concerning the "install-tl" script
     as follows :

	"The installation script is now named install-tl,
          and has both GUI (default on Windows) and text
         (default on everything else) operation modes.
          You can force one or the other with the options
         -gui and -no-gui, respectively."

		->

	"The installation script is now named install-tl
	 for Unix-based system and install-tl.bat for
	 Windows.  The script has both GUI (default on Windows)
	 and text (default on everything else) modes of operation.
          You can force one or the other with the options
         -gui and -no-gui, respectively."

14) To avoid the "disappearing CMD window" phenomenon,
     I think we should either adopt the %ComSpec" /K approach,
     or else make it plain that the "install-tl.bat" file
     must be launched from within a CMD window.

15) I have now launched "install-tl.bat" (using
     the %ComSpec% /K approach) and told it not
     to use the same settings as before.  I notice
     that the GUI window is not automatically
     given focus : this could easily confuse a
     naive user.

16) Using the GUI interface, the lack of a browse
     feature is very noticeable on attempting to
     modify TEXDIR.

17) The prompt reads "Enter path for TEXDIR
	(Use ~ for HOME/USERPROFILE).  As
     mentioned in an earlier message, the use
     of the path separator in this message is
     /very/ confusing : I'll try to offer
     a clearer wording when I have finished this
     initial report.

18) Using click-at-end, drag to beginning, overtype
    (a fairly standard way in Windows of replacing
     an existing entry with typed input), the first
     attempt succeeded but the second resulted in
     the overtype being itself highlit and therefore
     deleted on the next character.  Attempting to
     use the cancel key had no perceivable effect,
     but after further interaction with the dialogue
     box the CMD window reported

> Tk::Error: Can't locate object method "cancel" via package "Tk::After::Cancelled
> " at O:\TeX\Live\2008\install-tl\tlpkg\installer\perllib/Tk/Widget.pm line 492,
> <RETFH> line 113918.
>  <ButtonRelease-1>
>  (command bound to event)

    It is consistent that when the text is highlit,
    <cancel> has no effect.

    The highlit overtype appears to occur when the
    drag is fast and extensive; if it is slow and
    measured, the problem does not seem to occur.

    In the absence of browse functionality, it might
    be worth suggesting that the user first browse to
    his/her preferred installation root using Explorer,
    then copy the location so that it can be pasted into
    the dialogue box.

19) Having finally coerced TEXDIR to read "O:\TeX\Live\2008",
     all following buttons shew the paths with mixed delimiters
    (e.g., TEXMFLOCAL = "O:\TeX\Live\2008/texmf-local".  If
     I then change TEXDIR to read "O:/TeX/Live/2008", a very
     significant change occurs : TEXMFLOCAL now reads
    "O:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf-local" (note that the 2008
     has disappeared) : this would seem to suggest that
     the input dialogue box parser is not recognising "\"
     as being equivalent to "/".

20) TEXMFHOME reads "~/texmf"; as discussed above, this
     won't be meaningful to a Windows user, and the
     explanatory text uses the Unix path delimiter "/"
     to indicate alternation.  As above, I will try
     to suggest a clearer, more platform-neutral,
     wording.

Enough for tonight : I now have to collect
Khanh from the station ...

Yep, but that is not as visible as a desktop icon. So psychologically, by
modifying the registry, you don't get the same effect of "how does that
installer *dare* to touch something on *MY* desktop without asking me?".
However, I agree that technically speaking, playing with the registry is much
worse than putting two desktop icons.

(And you might say that anyway windows users are used to see their computer do
things without their permission (unlike Unix), but I'd answer that as free
software developers/distributors we can take the opportunity to show them what
respecting the user means...)

Technically, the first is wanted by normal users and easily reversible by
power users. The second is easily reversible by anyone and can be useful to
some others. So I also agree that it is no *so* important, though as a user I
would prefer to have the installer ask me about the shortcuts and inform me
about the changes in the PATH.

Maybe it's not to late to add something about the PATH in the welcome message
for windows (since there's already sthg about it on Unix)?

IMHO, just informing about changes in the PATH in the welcome message doesn't
hurt in any way and can make some power users happier. Concerning the desktop
icons, I agree with both of you: it would be desirable to ask, but it's not
essential and it's not the time for this.

The path isn't necessarily restored to its previous value. Since one
cannot know what happened in between to the path, there no point in
even trying.  When installing, we remove other TeX directories from
the path, e.g. to keep the path tidy even when you repeatedly
install TeX Live without deinstalling in between.

No idea. that is probably Tk problem which cannot be solved now since
including a new Tk module will probably break about 100+ other things.

Hi Phil,
I agree with you that it is desirable that people can read the
documentation before they install anything.  Many people want to know
what had been changed, at least.

A possible solution for people using the network installer is to put
the files

   README*
   index.html
   readme.html/
   texmf-doc/doc/<language>/texlive-XX/*

into the same directory which contains the network installer.  Then
people can read the documentation *before* they download the
installer.

Karl, what do you think?  The documentation has to be updated once per
year, hence it's not much work.  I could provide a .tar.gz file which
contains all the doc files needed or maybe a script which derives
them somehow automatically next weekend.

It's very desirable IMO to allow people to read the documentation
*before* they install/download anything.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Phil, I must admit that I'm the culprit.  The idea was to have the top
level index.html file visible and to hide all the other related files
in a directory called "readme.html".  I'm amazed that it confused you.

The main idea was to make index.html more noticeable.  All the other
files are hidden but can be accessed by following hyperlinks.

Well, having a directory name end in ".html" /is/
unusual, and will certainly cause mental hiccoughs
for those browsing the directory.  I invariable run
Explorer in "details" view : I don't know how well
(or how badly) the differentiation between a
directory "Readme.html" and a file "Index.html"
would appear in other views ...

The problem is, Windows displays directories before files.
Thus the directory "Readme.html" is far more noticeable than
the file "Index.html", and this will undoubtedly cause
some to double-click on the directory (thereby opening it)
rather than the file.  I think there is a simple solution :
don't use the ".html" suffix for the directory -- a name
such as "Resources" is sufficiently bland to avoid unwanted
investigation of its contents.

Incidentally, who (and how) is expected to read the
files "README.<whatever>" ?  They can't
be double-clicked in Windows (well, they can, but
then you have to tell it which program to use to
open it), and if you try to read one in Notepad
you find one infinitely-wide line :-(((  Should
these files, too, not be hidden in "Resources",
and made visible through some supplied utility
that can unmangle the line endings ?

Maybe -- and here I realise I'm treading on dangerous
ground -- the whole installer package could usefully
be divided into Windows and Unix branches, with those
few files common to both carefully tweaked so they can
be opened in both systems without difficulty or artifact.

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0h88fahh.aspx

>From the above rules, we can find that the following locales codes and its corresponding short strings and other informations:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>From the above rules established by Microsfot, we can say that the most easiest way is to rename the Perltk-zh into Perltk_zh-cn for  simplified chinese and Perltk_zh-tw for traditional chinese.   If we do it like this way, perhaps there should be some changes in the original perl script that judge these two files for using them correctly, but it should be also easy due to the corresponding code value (zh-cn and  zh-tw) have been stored in the OS's registry.

Subject: [tex-live] Install-tl : some explicit suggestions
In-Reply-To: <489C0068.2030006@Rhul.Ac.Uk>
References: <489B6DE1.60405@Royal-Tunbridge-Wells.Org>	<18587.43717.300760.515377@zaphod.ms25.net>	<489BFC2B.4070001@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

One (?final?) thought on this thread
(it was implicit in the last mail, but
I thought it clearer if made explicit) --

IMHO, the top-level "install-tl" directory
should contain very few, platform-neutral,
files, plus one directory for each primary
platform/architecture, plus one directory
for platform-neutral files that don't warrant
a top-level entry.  Thus I envisage something
along the lines of the following --

	<Platform-neutral>
	<Unix>
	<Windows>
	Index.html
	Readme.txt

Line-endings could be caterered for either by
putting a viewer in each of <Unix> and <Windows>
(I am assuming, somewhat naively, that these are
the only two platforms/architectures supported),
or by having duplicate text files under <Windows>
and <Unix>.  Of course, if the installer avoided
text files completely and used only HTML and/or
PDF, this problem would not occur in the first place.

OK, the re-install has completed, and
I didn't spot any environment variable
warnings, but the log file is not
complete so I can't yet check.  The
installation has paused with a "Finish"
button displayed, and the CMD session
is suspended at

	pre-generation all format file

(which might better read "pre-generating all format files",
  if anyone is expected to read it).

"fc-cache" has failed again : the relevant
parts of the transcript are below.

More when the "Finish" step is complete.

Wouldn't a pause statement at the end of the batchfile accomplish
the same?

Well, the installation is now complete,
but once again the CMD window has
disappeared and with it all trace
of the fc-cache messages.  In addition,
I saw (just before it disappeared)
a "can't unlink : permission denied"
message pertaining to something "lzma".
Neither of these appear in "install-tl.log".

If the team could modify the installer to
trap /all/ error messages, I will happily
run the tests yet again.

Seeking to run the failed "fc-cache" by
hand, I typed "fc-cache /?" to learn
the required parameters and switches,
but it appeared not to recognise "/?"
and has gone away and done something
(I know not what) and returned without
issuing any message at all.

I then searched the web for "fc-cache"
incantations that rang a bell, and found
"fc-cache -v -r", which I tried.  It too
has failed : transcript below.

You are expected to click this button which will close the window, the
cmd window, and everything. As soon as that Finish dialog is shown
everthing is installed and done.

It does not *hang* at generating formats, it only does not issue a
"done". I have added that "done" now.

Hmmm .. that is something I haven't seen before. Siep/Reinhard/whoever
knows Windows a bit, what could be the reason for that.

The pause at the end of install.bat has been committed and should be

Dear Siep et al --

Just in case the "pause" idea does not
work as intended, here is a short demo.
of the %ComSpec% idea.  What follows
is the contents of a file "Test.cmd";
when double-clicked, it will execute
its primary contents once, then wait
to be dismissed.

Dear Zhao,

Thanks for your investigations, but I still have one problem:

Our code always deduces a 2 letter code. So I am not sure how that will
work.

Where???

As far as I see the code we use:
>Our modules take a look into the registry to find out that value. It
>goes like this:
>	Look into CurrentUser/Control Panel/International//Locale
>and then look up that value in

Does not give a full string (zh-XX) but only zh. That is what has
happened on your computer. It should have given zh-cn (simplified), but
got only zh.

So as long as we don't know how to get at the long value (zh-XX) we
cannot evaluate it.

Best wishes

Norbert

That actually *GIVES* the full string. Can you PLEASE check that you
have in 
	HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/MIME/Database/Rfc1766/
entries for zh-tw and zh-cn? My Windows does not support Asian languages
and thus does not exhibit these values.

Can you check *which*
	zh-XX
are present, and give us a mapping from them to zh-cn and zh-tw?
Thanks.

I'm only sitting on the fringe of this
discussion, but looking in my XP registry
I can see "zh-tw" at 0404 under
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/MIME/Database/Rfc1766/,
also "zh-sg" at 1004, "zh-hk" at 0C04,
and "zh-cn" at 0804.

Ahh that is good. What else do you have (I already answered that, it was
our code stripping it down to 2 letters)?

And any suggestions to map all the zh-* variants to either one of zh-cn
or zh-tw?

Yes, although Zhao will know far better than I, it
is my understanding that Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan use traditional hanzi, whilst mainland
China and Singapore use simplifed.  Zhao, wo dui bu dui ?

Hmm, by eye as follows :

"0004"="zh;Chinese"
"0404"="zh-tw;Chinese (Taiwan)"
"0804"="zh-cn;Chinese (China)"
"0C04"="zh-hk;Chinese (Hong Kong SAR)"

I have changed the code that on win and unix both are treated as zh-cn,
but as soon as I got a different comment from Zhao (or anyone else who

Confused : surely

"0004"="zh;Chinese"                     -> zh-cn
"0404"="zh-tw;Chinese (Taiwan)"            stet
"0804"="zh-cn;Chinese (China)"             stet
"0C04"="zh-hk;Chinese (Hong Kong SAR)"  -> zh-tw
"1004"="zh-sg;Chinese (Singapore)"      -> zh-cn

Isn't that right ?

Ok, I have changed the code base so that from now on the installer will
support both settings.

If someone with Asian Windows can please test the code with tomorrows
installer, thanks.

On my WIndows XP system, fc-cache was "failing" until I removed some
Myriad ttf fonts  from
"C:\windows\fonts\fonts" that had otf versions in "C:\windows\fonts".
 I assume this was done
by Adobe Acrobat Reader, but haven't checked for the issue on other
machines.  My guess is that
fc-cache doesn't know what to do when you have the same font in
different formats
in one directory tree.  Linux systems have /usr/share/fonts/truetype
and /usr/share/fonts/opentype,
so the problem would not arise there.

Can you check C:\Windows\Fonts for the same fonts in different formats?

Fontconfig is used by a number of other popular applications such as
gimp and inkscape,
but they don't let you see the messages.

OK, thanks for the suggestions, George :
I see that under \Windows\Fonts I have
no sub-directory, and as far as I can
/see, there are no duplicate names
varying only in extension (I have TTFs,
TTCs, FONs and OTFs).  Do you know of
a reliable way of detecting duplicates ?

Not quite the same, but now the installer will give a warning under
Windows if there already is a TeX found, and give the user a
chance to bail out. At the moment this is done by the batchfile, but
this will probably be replaced with something more polished.

Now about asking users what the installer should and shouldn't do:

The Windows users I deal with are smart enough in their own field,
but most of them have very little notion of the system they work on.
If they are well-organized then they know their way around among
their own documents, but the rest of their system is just a black
box. So I prefer not to even mention a search path. The people who
care and understand will have no trouble dealing with it on their
own.

That being said, browsing the Ubuntu forums I see a lot of new users
who would probably panick at the welcome message advising them to
add TeX to their PATH.

Another point: asking questions via a gui is a lot of work: both as
to programming and as to designing. This time around, we have done a
major overhaul of the infrastructure. Next time, we can pay more
attention to the interface, including asking a few more questions.

OK, that seems reasonable : this is a new installer,
and it can be considerably refined over the next
year.  But if asking questions is too much, at least
make some statements, such as :

	The TeX 2008 executables directory will be
	added to {your path | the system-wide
	search path} [whichever is correct]

	Two new shortcuts, "PS_View", and "TeXdoc_GUI", will
	be added to {your desktop | all users' desktops};
	you may safely delete these if you wish, as the
	programs will remain accessible from Start/Programs/TeX Live.

My two eurocents :-)

In case it got drowned out by all the other noise on the tex-live
list: Phil Taylor is also having persistent problems with fc-cache.
It doesn't seem to be a configuration problem since fc-cache works
on some directories and fails on others.  Norbert already redirected
stderr/stdout to a logfile. An explanation in the output of the
consequences of failure might also alleviate the problem. A real
solution would of course be best.

Sorry, I've been only very intermittently on-line the last few days,  
and I don't really know anything about the Windows build.

Phil, are you running (the TL installer, and/or fc-cache separately)  
as an administrator or as a "normal" user? (I'm not too sure of the  
appropriate Windows terminology here.) I'm guessing that without admin  
privileges, it is unable to write into the c:\windows\fonts directory.

Jonathan

What would fc-cache write to the c:\windows\fonts directory?  On my system,
(where fc-cache has been working since I zapped some old Myriad TTF files),
the cache files are stored in texmf-var/fonts/cache.   By far the largest of the
-x86.cache-2 files has c:\windows\fonts stored near the start of the file, and
more strings like C:/WINDOWS/fonts/8514fixe.fon.   Is there a tool to dump
a summary of the information in the .cache-2 files?

As /the/ Administrator !  I have another fully
privileged a/c that I could use, but for the purposes
of installing TL 2008 I have been authenticating
as Administrator.

I'll just confirm that : yes, although I can't right-click
and create a file in Windows explorer, if I open a CMD box
and CD to C:\Windows\Fonts, I can

	Copy con test.txt
	Some text
	^\

and then

	Type test.txt

and see

	Some text

so I definitely have permission.  Here is the log from the most
recent run of Install-tl (relevant parts only) :

OK, having arranged for "install-tl"s CMD window
to remain open after completion, I have now
run "fc-cache -v -r" from that same window,
with SysInternals File Monitor watching all
transactions, and this time (for the first time),
"fc-cache" succeeded.  I append the transcript;
File Monitor did not report any failures at all.

I would be very happy to perform yet another
(the fifth !) full install, this time with
File Monitor running in the background, if
you would like me to try to shed some light
on why "fc-cache" fails during the wind-up
part of the installation.

I agree with this, unless it's too much work to add it to the GUI.

In response to the lengthy discussion, I've made a few changes to the
top level files.

- moved the plain text README.* files into a subdir readme-txt.dir.

- renamed the dir with the HTML readme.* files to the parallel readme-html.dir.

- changed the English readme to state that the documentation links as
  given only work on the DVD, and if you're installing from the
  Internet, then you should look for the documentation on the Internet, too.  

Hope this is an improvement.

Basically, the simplified chinese is mainly used in Chinese Mainland, Malaysia, and Singapore, whereas the traditional chinese is mainly used in Taiwan, Hongkong, Macao and etc.

In spite of the fact of the above territorial use of simplified and traditional chinese, we shouldn't simply do the locale map from all of these to only zh-cn and zh-tw like the above, IMO.  This is because there're many region-specific phrase corresponding to each of the regions.  In detail, though simplified chinese are both used in Chinese and Singapore, they may use a different phrase or word for the same thing.  

N B, the files provided by me should only have the correct expression for only Chinese Mainland (zh-cn version) and Chinese Taiwan (zh-tw version). 

But, the above requirement perhaps is a bit of rigor!  Just my suggestions.

Yeah, but I guess that is better for a user of zh-HK to get zh-TW then
English, right? And as long as nobody makes the translations for the
other zh-* that is the best solution.

Do be honest, there are loads of differences between de_DE, de_AT,
de_CH, but still we are using only de since everyone will understand
what is written there, even if they wouldn't write it that way.

The installer hasn't been updated due to a bug, you have to wait at
least one more day (better two).

Testing is simple by starting the installer and se whether it comes out
in the right language.

Thanks for all your cooperation and all the best

The welcome message is already quite long. The longer it gets, the
fewer people will read it. My suggestion: just a pointer to online
release notes.

Could you please remind us what the welcome message
currently reads ?  (I don't know how to provoke it
without starting a new install).

OK, a question to Norbert : if you (the installer, that is)
detect localisation "zh-hk", could you/it then issue a message
(in "zh-hk") reading (in translation) "Sorry, we do not have
  a 'zh-hk' transliteration; using 'zh-tw' as the nearest
  approximation" ?

Zhao, is there a localisation for Shanghainese, which I know
from experience is very different to standard Hanyu ?  And if
so, would we want to offer a similar message before serving
standard Hanyu in simplified hanzi ?

This actually comes from  from Internet Explorer, so may not exist
on all systems (e.g., wine), but does have the advantage of following
a standard other than Microsoft.

There is also the Microsoft way:

<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776260(VS.85).aspx>
has a table for HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/International/Locale
My linux PC has 409=en-US on wine.  The table offers:

Locale
identifier 	Locale 	                              Locale name  Script
tag   ANSI code page
0x0c04 	Chinese (Hong Kong SAR, PRC) 	zh-HK 	Hant 	       950
0x1404 	Windows 98/Me, Windows XP
                and later: Chinese (Macao SAR) 	zh-MO 	Hant 	       950
0x0804 	Chinese (PRC)                          	zh-CN 	Hans       936
0x1004 	Chinese (Singapore)                         zh-SG 	Hans       936

I would like a reference to some online document, with a
corresponding shortcut in the texlive menu. But mention of the
searchpath might alarm some users, and the desktop changes they can
see for themselves.

And the welcome message really is already too long; the Unix version
merely is more too long, but extra line happens to be essential.

By the way: the psview shortcut can be used as a drag-and-drop
target. So although it is not essential, it adds a real convenience.

A quick search with google give me the following results:

I myself don't have any experience and knowledge in Shanghainese,

I'm going to step back on this one : clearly Siep and
I disagree about the importance (or otherwise) of
warning Windows users about the changes to their
environment that installing TL 2008 will make; I leave
it to the discretion of the Team to decide which
position to favour.

OK, I think we're getting on pretty murky ground here :
Shanghainese, not being based on Zhongwen at all,
will not appear as "ZH-<anything>" but rather
(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:CN)
as CN-31.  Given that there are about another
forty or so Chinese languages, each with its
own CN-xx code, I think we have reached a level
of granularity that we don't want to investigate !

ISO 3166 does not encode languages but political country subdivisions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US lists 50 states, 1 district,
and 6 outlying areas in US, which does not mean they should be counted
as different languages.

Message-ID: <m3vdya2g1x.fsf@multivac.cwru.edu>

Hi.  I've compiled TeX Live from source (using the 2007 version, since
AFAIK there's no tarball for 2008 yet).  I think I've done the
installation correctly, but I seem to be missing some important bits
of configuration.  The configuration I've done so far includes
creating mktex.cnf (containing only ": ${MT_FEATURES=appendonlydir varfonts}")
and running "texconfig-sys init mf", "fmtutil-sys --missing", and
"texconfig-sys rehash".  This simple test fails:

$ dvips -f < texk/web2c/tests/story.dvi > /dev/null

I also run into a problem when installing Lilypond, which is my main
reason for installing TeX.  That build ends with:

This is METAFONT, Version 2.71828 (Web2C 7.5.6)
kpathsea: Running mktexfmt mf.base
I can't find the base file `mf.base'!

Can anyone help figure out what I'm missing?  It looks like maybe
fonts aren't included in TeX Live's source.tar.bz2, and I have to
install those separately, but I haven't found any documentation on
that.

Yes there are.  Several.  See http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.
We are still in testing mode, but the release is approaching.

    fonts aren't included in TeX Live's source.tar.bz2, 

Right.  It includes the sources to the compiled programs.  Not the
(vast number of) support files.

There are tarballs/ISO images/rsync/svn/whatever for the texmf trees.

Hi Phil,
installing TeX Live takes an enourmous amount of time because
thousands of small files have to be downloaded/copied.  TeX Live 2008
already allows you to install it on a server and mount it to various
clients.  Siep provided a script which performs all the post-install
steps on the clients running Windows.  Don't remeber the name of the
script but hopefully it's mentioned in the documentation.

I'm aware that this is not what you want.  A peer-to-peer installer
doesn't make sense at all because if you are able to install TeX Live
on one machine, the most efficient way to install it on another
machine is to put the whole stuff into a big zip file and extract it
on the other machines.  This is significantly faster than everything
else.

Finally you have to run Siep's script on all machines in order to add
the bin dir to %PATH%.

So I don't see any good reason to change the installer.  Everything
you need is supported already.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Fine, all understood : at the moment, and following Norbert's
suggestion, I'm mirroring TLNET from Cambridge, and then I'll
try a local install using

	install-tl.bat -location /pat/to/the/main/dir/containing/tlpkg

Folks,


the current texi2dvi (both version 1.122 which is part of the current
TeXLive repository and 1.132 which is part of the current texinfo
repository) no longer handles TEXINPUTS values correctly which contain
braces.  For example, version 1.34 (part of texinfo 4.8) did.

My shell is bash 3.1.17, on a GNU/Linux box.

This is a serious regression which should be fixed ASAP.

Well, that's easy enough to change, but on XP one must additionally
change TEXMFHOME as well since %HOMEPATH% has spaces in it too; on
Vista %HOMEPATH% doesn't have blanks in it. I used
C:/tlhome/$USERNAME, so it would still be different for each user. (I
saw that %SystemRoot% is $SystemRoot to TeXLive, so I put $USERNAME
for %USERNAME%). But changing it in the installer wasn't enough...

As you can see it keeps trying (and failing) to use "Documents and
Settings", but goes for the current directory for .texlive2008. It
looks like luatools ignores C:/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf completely.
Unfortunately that's where TEXMFHOME gets set by the installer. So, I
manually changed  C:/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf to read:

TEXMFHOME = C:/tlhome/$USERNAME
TEXMFVAR = C:/tlhome/$USERNAME/.texlive2008/texmf-var
TEXMFCONFIG = C:/tlhome/$USERNAME/.texlive2008/texmf-config

I ran luatools again, and... I got the exact same errors. Then I
changed LuaTools C:/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/context.cnf to read
HOMETEXMF     = C:/tlhome/$USERNAME, and this helped a little since it tried:

As you can see it accesses C:/tlhome/Vasile/.texlive2008/ this time,
but it still doesn't use it; it still goes for "Documents and
Settings" to compile stuff... At this point I have no ~ in any .cnf
file (I grepped). So I looked in the .lua files. There's a bunch of
them since instead writing a single function to deal with paths and ~
substitution there's copy & pasted code everywhere. Anyway, it seem
that the problem is in lines like 'cachepath = os.getenv("TEXMFCACHE")
or os.getenv("HOME") or os.getenv("HOMEPATH") or os.getenv("TMP")'...
since os.getenv("HOMEPATH") gives "\Documents and Settings\Vasile". I
removed os.getenv("HOMEPATH") and now it goes for the next one, %TMP%,
which works:

The real bug seem that lua stuff assumes os.getenv("TEXMFCACHE") will
actually work on Windows. But it seems that setting stuff in .cnf
files doesn't set environment variables on Windows, even inside Lua.
I'll let you guys sort it out from here...


BTW, since I paid close attention to the installation this time I
noticed a couple of harmless warnings:

texmf-dist/doc/latex/marvosym/mac/README, extracted as normal file
tar: Unknown file type '2' for

No. From the wiki page (I though you said you had seen it?):

*  If there is an environment variable named TEXMFCACHE, this will
    point to the desired harddisk location
*  Otherwise, if reading texmfcnf.lua results in the variable TEXMFCACHE
    being set, this is the desired location. this is the recommended
    approach, see below
*  If that doesn't work either, a list of likely environment variables
    is tested, and the first environment variable that is set is assumed
    to  point to the correct location.
*  As a last resort, the local directory is used.

But in any case, this is not a texlive issue. As I said earlier,
context+luatex on texlive is left unconfigured *on purpose*.
Any configureation problems a context issue and should be discussed
on the context mailing list, not here.

Best wishes,
Taco

Okay, I figured out how you thought the user should have done this:
I've added a C:/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/texmfcnf.lua. Well I tried
C:/texlive/2008/texmfcnf.lua first, but it is ignored. Inside I put:

return { TEXMFCACHE =  'C:/tlhome/$USERNAME/.texlive2008/texmf-var' }

and now I get:

Much more sane.

Folks,


how can I find out the people reponsible for a given man page?

For example, there are some serious typos in amstex.1 (see the patch
below).

Shall I send patches to this list?  Shall I fix it immediately in
TeXLive?  I assume that the PDF files of the man pages are then
regenerated automatically, right?

Hello!

The file has this paragraph:

	Sie finden die Anleitung in verschiedenen Dateiformaten im  
Verzeichnis texmf-doc/doc/german/texlive-ge/:
	
	HTML: live.html -> file:///usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/

There are a few more instances where the path element "texlive-ge" is  
used instead of the proper "texlive-de" which I tried to correct in  
the attached updated version.

Later a browser "Mozilla" is recommended ? shouldn't this be changed  
to SeaMonkey, Camino (for Mac OS X users only), both available from  
the same mozilla.org site, or Firefox 3?

werner,

    how can I find out the people reponsible for a given man page?

    For example, there are some serious typos in amstex.1 (see the patch
    below).

although the source of amstex itself is the
ams, i can't find any indication that the man
file originated here.  the oldest copy we have
is one distributed with tetex in (i believe)
2006.  the bottom of the file says
  Web2C 7.5.6    Last change: 27 December 1992
so it is definitely not recent.

amsmath.sty is mentioned in the man page text.

Subject: [tex-live] REVTeX4.1 update in preparation
Message-ID: <721775A3-3F5D-4791-A8F5-2F241118EF1B@sbcglobal.net>

This is a heads-up to the effect that the REVTe4 package for LaTeX is  
currently under revision and will be issued (insofar as schedules can  
assure one) in September 2008. The released version will be REVTeX4.1.

As part of this work, I am working to make the packaging up of REVTeX  
as straightforward as possible for the sake of folks like yourselves.  
In that connection, let me provide you with our current scheme, for  
your review.

As for REVTeX4, the package is entirely free; the source and all  
derived files are marked with the LPPL.

The distribution is in the form of an archive revtex4-1.zip, with its  
primary point of distribution http://publish.aps.org/revtex. Of course  
we will also submit for inclusion in CTAN, where REVTeX4.1 is expected  
to supersede REVTeX4.

Unzipping revtex4-1.zip produces a directory revtex4.1 with the  
following contents:

revtex4.1/
     README     - a nice readme file with manifest, installation  
instructions, and provenance
     DOWNLOAD   - pretty much a copy of a portion of the README; I do  
not know why we include it
     texmf.zip  - an image of the texmf tree that REVTeX4.1 occupies

The installation instructions say to execute a command like:

# unzip texmf.zip -d /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
# mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

where  choice of target directory is up to the administrator doing the  
install.

This installation procedure is similar in most respects to that  
promoted by the TeX Live team on your web page http://www.tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html 
, but with some differences:

* the two-layered .zip archive. This was done to avoid unzipping the  
README and DOWNLOAD files into the texmf tree. The only alternative I  
know about would involve piping into and out of tar; the present  
scheme seems simpler.

* our .dtx files follow the clever model of Heiko Oberdiek in the  
sense that there is no need for either a .ins nor a .drv file. To  
effectively run the .ins, you type, e.g.,

tex revtex4.dtx

and to effectively typeset the .drv, you type

[pdf]latex revtex4.dtx

therefore we have removed the .ins and .drv files entirely.

Do you think this a poor idea? Since you will not have to run the  
sausage maker, I thought it would not negatively impact the packaging  
activities of the TeX Live team, and anyone wishing to gen the files  
or the documentation themselves will read the README or the head of  
the .dtx.

* our arrangement of files in the texmf tree is different in minor  
ways from that adopted by the TeX Live team in the (dim) past. We are  
hoping you will simply follow our lead in the matter. In particular,  
we use a small private package docs.sty in typesetting our  
documentation; it was never our intention to inflict this private  
package on the TeX users of the world, so it now lives in doc/.

It is my hope that the latest REVTeX4 release will make your lives  
easier. Let us know if you see us heading off in the wrong direction.

Subject: [tex-live] CJK 4.8.1 has been released
Message-ID: <20080810.223338.134317927.wl@gnu.org>


I've just uploaded CJK version 4.8.1 to ftp.dante.de.

Here the announcement text.


For TeXLive: Please no longer install the files from doc/man/pdf; they
are now autogenerated in TeXLive (as far as I have understood the
issue).


    Werner


======================================================================


CJK 4.8.1
=========

CJK 4.8.1 is available from

  ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/language/chinese/CJK

and other CTAN hosts and its mirrors.  Following the CTAN rules, the
source files of CJK are unpacked.  Additionally, the archive
CJK-4.8.1-doc.tar.gz is available which provides some CJK
documentation and example files in various output formats.

Current development snapshots are available from

  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=cjk.git;a=summary

which also shows the commitments to the git repository of the CJK
package.

Bug reports should go to cjk-bug at ffii.org.


CJK is a macro package for LaTeX, providing simultaneous support for
various Asian scripts in many encodings (including Unicode):

  Chinese (both traditional and simplified)
  Japanese
  Korean
  Thai

A special add-on feature is an interface to the Emacs editor
(cjk-enc.el) which gives simultaneous, easy-to-use support to a bunch
of other scripts in addition to the above:

  Cyrillic
  Greek
  Latin-based scripts
  Russian
  Vietnamese

See below for the relevant snippet from the history file.

Enjoy!

======================================================================


Version 4.8.1:
10-Aug-2008
                new:
                    SUN Wen-Chang has contributed the CJKspace.sty package
                    which modifies the `CJK*' environment to suppress spaces
                    only after CJK characters.  See CJKspace.txt for
                    details.

                errors:
                    Pinyin syllable macros (defined in pinyin.sty) were not
                    robust, causing problems with indices, for example.

                    Some Chinese .fd and .fdx files were missing for fonts
                    which are present in forthcoming TeXLive distribution.

Arthur,

Thanks for the note.

    * the two-layered .zip archive

CTAN now has a top-level install/ directory.  TDS-ready .zip's such as
your texmf.zip can go there.  You'll see if you take a look.  This is a
matter for discussing with CTAN when you make your eventual upload
there.

    Since you will not have to run the sausage maker

We always run it; it's just that in lucky cases it clones the incoming
sausage.  (But often there are little bits of skin and stuff to strip
off ... ugh, this is a disgusting analogy, let's drop it. :)

    we use a small private package docs.sty in typesetting our  
    documentation; it was never our intention to inflict this private  
    package on the TeX users of the world, so it now lives in doc/.

Excellent.  I had occasionally wondered about then when I stumbled
across it.

Overall: I see no problems, full speed ahead ...

Thanks,
k

Message-ID: <200808102218.m7AMIiU32722@f7.net>

    how can I find out the people reponsible for a given man page?

For amstex.1 and other such oddities they are maintained in TL, as far
as I know.  If it's not a man page that obviously belongs to a
separately-maintained package (dvipng, texinfo, mkjobtexmf, etc., etc.),
it's a pretty good bet that we are the source for it.

    Shall I fix it immediately in TeXLive?  

Yes, please do.

You probably know this already, but just to get the info out there, most
man pages exist both somewhere in Build/source as well as
texmf/doc/man.  Please update them both.  They should be the same
except for the possible @VERSION@ in /source/ being instantiated.

    I assume that the PDF files of the man pages are then regenerated
    automatically, right?

Right.

Thanks,
k

    my question is, should this page be updated
    or simply scrapped?

It is better to have it than not to have it.

    really should be some more changes besides
    the ones shown here.

In many cases, the man pages are mostly there to satisfy desires that
there be man pages for every executable command.  Thus, they can
(should) be as minimal as possible.  The real documentation for just
about everything in the TeX system lies elsewhere and we don't want to
repeat information that can/will get out of date.

In any case, since these moribund man pages have existed as-is for
*many* years, there is no reason to suddenly decide to undertake a huge
update project a few days before the final release.  Indeed, I actively
wish we won't do that.  Any such thorough overhauls can come later, at
leisure.  For instance, some of them could be generated with help2man,
which at least would keep them current, and in some cases actually
provide better information.

Anyway ...

When i pipe the output to a file, i can view it in proper manpage format
not by less, but by less -R. Is there a place in tlmgr, where this -R
could be missing? Or is something weird with my local setup?

Hi Hartmut,

    Is there a place in tlmgr, where this -R
    could be missing? 

No.  We don't explicitly invoke less, or any pager.

    Or is something weird with my local setup?

That's my guess, although I don't have any good ideas about what it
could be.  It works for me; with PAGER=cat, I get plain text, with
PAGER=less (or more) I get formatted text as expected.

All we actually do with --help for these Perl scripts is invoke the fn:
pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2);

where pod2usage is doing all the formatting.  Maybe in its doc will help
you track down what's happening?
http://perldoc.perl.org/Pod/Usage.html#pod2usage()

The install of TL 2008 from my local Cambridge
mirror has just near-completed (by which I mean
that the GUI has paused with the "Finish"
button shewing) but the VM manager reported
that the system was becoming dangerously low
on memory, and on checking I see that it
peaked at 6Gb.  I cannot imagine what in the
installer might require such enormous resources,
so I wonder if there might be a memory leak ?

It is worth reporting that the VM message
did not appear on a smaller (1GB, instead
of 2Gb in the present machine) when installing
over the network from Cambridge.

Hi, Karl,

I understand and agree that this isn't the time to undertake a major
overhaul, but would it be possible to remove this paragraph?

       AmSTeX is the official typesetting system of the American
       Mathematical Society, and nearly all of its publications are
       typeset using AmSTeX.  The online version of AMS Math Reviews
       uses AmSTeX input syntax for display of mathematical material.
       AMS authors can provide editors with computer-readable AmSTeX
       files.

That is, in fact, highly misleading.

On the other hand, I doubt anyone would take a 15-year old man page as
authoritative about current AMS policy, assuming anyone ever looks at
the page at all, so it's not a huge deal.

Cheers,
David.

Excellent, thanks Siep.  Is there any (easy) way
to tell when the Cambridge mirror has re-synched
with SVN ?

In hindsight, this is ambiguous : by "my local
Cambridge mirror", I mean "my local mirror of
the Cambridge CTAN node", rather than "my local
CTAN mirror at Cambridge".

No idea what was going on there, but I don't give you much chance of

Thank you, Siep.

[VM Leak]

I repeated the installation today, using your more
recent code, and removed from the path a reference
to a TeX Live 2007 directory (I noted that a number
of yesterday's messages referenced the 2007
hierarchy rather than the 2008, the reason for
which was unclear at the time).  When I repeated
the installation today, the VM error did not recur,
but as the system has not been re-booted in the
meantime, the larger paging file extended by the
system during yesterday's install will still be
available, so it is unclear whether the problem
will recur after a reboot.

A request : could the TeX Live "tlnet/tldev" branch
contain an Install-TL directory that itself contains
an expansion of "tlnet/tldev/install-tl.zip" ?  This
would ensure that anyone (such as myself) who is
mirroring the "tlnet" hierarchy will automatically
have access to the most recent contents of "install-tl.zip"
without needing to remember to unpack the ZIP file before use.

Subject: [tex-live] TL2008 installation under Windows
Message-ID: <48A232D5.9080009@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi All,

having done a few test installations of TL2008, here are some 
questions/remarks:

0)
Installation under Windows XP and 2000 was working well and even 
malicious interruptions couldn't break the installation procedure, i.e 
it was always able to resume and finish the process.

1)
Under 'macros': 'Windows support programs' is not selected, although the 
*scheme-full* is chosen and the install is running under *Windows*.

2)
As far as I can see, the '~/texmf' under TEXMFHOME is not a problem. 
Most users have no idea what TDS is about and certainly do not know 
TEXMF* and their relevance. Therefore these options will remain 
untouched in most (Windows-)cases.
And the remark that '~' is replaced by 'HOME/USERPROFILE' is nice, but 
won't improve matters much, as those users have no clue about windows 
internals like %USERPROFILE% either.

3)
While watching Installation-TV, I saw 'bin.xdvi-win32' scrolling by, but 
after the install there still was no DVI-viewer whatsoever. Is there no 
way to provide one during the Net-install?
A TeX system without pre-installed DVI viewer is not usable in many 
circumstances. As Siep Kroonenberg put it: "[users] ... are smart enough 
in their own field, but most of them have very little notion of the 
system they work on." And this even holds for TeX. To them, TeX is just 
the black box they use to typeset their RevTeX articles. But as soon the 
fundamentals of the TeX system are not working (or not working as 
expected from earlier versions), those users are in trouble. A 
DVI-viewer is one of those basic assumptions...
Furthermore, 'pdf(la)tex' is not an option as long as the only 
vector-graphics (read: high-quality) format produced by many 
applications is EPS and as long as PDF handling under Windows is still 
clumsy due to exclusively locked files (which also the new PS_View does).

4)
When the final message window appeared, the following status messages 
were accessible in the accompanying console window:
4a)
[snip]
> Use of uninitialized value in substitution (s///) at C:\install-tl\install-tl li
> ne 489.
> Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at C:\install-tl\insta
> ll-tl line 490.
> Use of uninitialized value in substitution (s///) at C:\install-tl\install-tl li
> ne 496.
> Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at C:\install-tl\insta
> ll-tl line 497.
[snip]
Don't know what this means, might not even be an error...
4b)
[snip]
> Running f-cache -v -r
> running mktexlsr C:/texlive/2008/texmf-dist C:/texlive/2008/texmf
> mktexlsr: Updating C:/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/ls-R...

[snip]
Shouldn't the first line read 'Running fc-cache -v -r'? And shouldn't 
fc-cache generate more output -- or is it momentarily disabled due to 
the previous problems while saving the cache? After the installation the 
'fc-cache -v -r' ran without problems (as admin).

5)
After closing the finalization message, the corresponding console window 
did not close.

6)
There are way too many entries in the 'TeX Live 2008' group. All those 
manuals could got to a subfolder like 'TeX Live Manuals'.

7)
I see no problem in silently adding the two shortcuts to the user's 
desktop.  Windows users are used to this behaviour...

8)
tlmgr: The convenient little button to edit the 'updmap.cfg' from 2007 
is greatly missed.

9)
The German text of the button 'TeX Live Manager (tlmgr)' should rather 
read '?ber tlmgr'.

10)
PS_View: Under Windows 2000, the 'Open file' dialogue did not work. 
However, files could be opened by dropping them on the symbol on the 
desktop.

11)
TeXdoc GUI:
11a)
Settings-Printer: lpr won't do any good (with these options). Syntax 
would be:
 > lpr -S {Server Name or IP} -P {Queue Name} [-o l]
where '-o l' is to be used for binary data like PostScript. 
Unfortunately guessing a working IP might prove impossible and '-S 
127.0.0.1' for local printer(s) also does not work as Windows provides 
no lpq(s) for them...
11b)
DVI 'viewer command' is 'dviout' although this is definitely not installed.
11c)
i) While trying to find a solution to 8) (i.e. which of the many 
updmap.cfg to alter) via 'TeXdok GUI'-'The TeX Live 
Guide'-'German'/'English', those entries gave errors ('live.pdf missing' 
or similar).
ii) Then used the links in the start menu (working), unfortunately 
neither English nor German 'TeX Live Manual' were of any help. At this 
stage, I defined 'psv.bat' as default application for PDF (fresh and 
clean Windows-VMs without Acrobat Reader ;).
iii) Cross check if missing default application was responsible for 
11c-i): First document from 'The TeX Live Guide' worked (Czech/Slovak 
version, randomly chosen), all subsequent choices in this category open 
the Czech/Slovak version. Different entries in other categories, e.g. 
'Fundamentals', behave as expected.
11d)
Why gives the search function nothing for 'kpfonts' and 'pxfonts' but 
something for 'fourier' and 'lm'?

12)
Xe(La)TeX is working (story & sample2e).


X) As many of the (*)TeX-developers are on this list: Does anyone know a 
tool to convert Xe(La)TeX's xdv files to PostScript? Or is this 
impossible anyway, although Postscript is said to support multibyte 
characters?

Best Regards,
  Gregor

I don't fully agree on this point. You can still compile with latex+dvips and
use psview or ps2pdf and any pdf viewer, or convert your eps graphics to pdf.

True.

Anyway, I'm afraid it's really too late to change anything about this.

Iirc, this is on purpose.  The rationale is that normal users don't even know
what it is, and are very likely to break things by editing updmap.cfg.  Expert
users are generally able to open the file themselves. It's also a way of
remembering the user that he's playing with dangerous things.

I suppose you mean texdoctk.  I don't like the name of texdoc GUI since
texdoctk and the command-line version texdoc don't share the same principles,
but anyway.

Well, the first point about texdoctk is that it is unmaintained since some
time, and some replacement should probably be rewritten from scratch. By the
way, I'm just thinking, I wonder if it's a good idea to promote (I mean, put a
shortcut on the desktop) a somehow unmaintained software like this...

In theory, there should be no dvi documentation in TL anyway. But it's still

Oh, yes, the name changed to texlive-en etc recently. Just fixed it.

This search function is actually *very* misleading. It doesn't search in all
the documentation files, but only in those listed somewhere in the texdoctk
menu. To really look for arbitrary documentation, your are advised to use the
command-line texdoc.

I don't know, but I would rather fear that PostScript can't handle OpenType
fonts... I must admit I never felt the need to convert anything to postscript
rather than pdf, but this is another matter :-)

For other directories, it expands %USERPROFILE%. For TEXMFHOME, it
now says %USERPROFILE%. This reflects the fact that for TEXMFHOME,
the configuration file will contain `~' which for each user expands
to their own `home' directory, whereas for the other directories, it
will be expanded at installation time. I would love a better
phrasing for the TEXMFHOME case, but can't think of anything.

The best we can do at this stage is pointing users to dviout in the

The output has been redirected to the log file.

This is on purpose. Apparently, in some situations the finish button

As already mentioned, texdoctk is basically unmaintained, and we

During yesterdays installs, I had no problems with this, but I did not 
look for them in this place either.
Todays tests,i.e. specifically looking on WindowsXP (SP3+fully patched) 
and Windows2000 (SP4+fully patched):
- highlighting works with mouse and keyboard
- copying/cutting texts works
- pasting works, but *does not* erase the highlighted text
- typing *does* erase the highlighted text (which is the reason for my 
lack of problems, as my TeX Live will use folders that do no exist at 
that point of the installation anyway)

Best Regards,
  Gregor

Message-ID: <359b759c0808130428o752aac08v1bc07bc7bc9ec4e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all. I just installed the latest snapshot of TeXlive 2008. So far
everything seems to be working great, with one exception:
The package linguex (used for examples in linguistics) requires
cgloss4e.sty. The file comes with the linguex package, downloadable
from CTAN. However, TeXlive  does not install it together with
linguex. Maybe someone considered it is obsolete and removed it?

I checked in
texlive/2008/tlpkg/tlpobj/linguex.tlpobj and the file is not listed:
 texmf-dist/doc/latex/linguex/README
 texmf-dist/doc/latex/linguex/README.TEXLIVE
 texmf-dist/doc/latex/linguex/linguex-doc.pdf details="Linguex manual:"

Hopefully this can be easily fixed.

No, we usually don't remove individual files for such reasons, but we remove
them when they are duplicating files in other packages. Here, cgloss4e.sty is
already provided by gb4e. Installing this should solve the problem.

You can see that supposed obsolescence is not in the reasons. By the way, I'm
not sure lack of space is still a possible reason either, now that we don't
try to fit in a single CD any more.

I would like to nuance: I am going to fix problems if and only if they have a
trivial fix.  For example, if someone provides us with a good replacement for
the lpr command, it's easy to change.  I'll also check that texdoctk.dat
contains no reference to non-existent files (already had a script for that,
adding it to my cron).

But no change in the program itself will be made, and we don't try to ensure
relevance/completeness of the database.

As users doing a NET install have internet access anyway, at least a 
shortcut labelled 'DVI-Viewer' could be placed in the start-menu group, 
which leads to an internet page specifically describing the installation 
procedure (i.e. reproduce the content of the DVD's 
'/support/dviout/README' together with a direct link to this archive).

And what is the purpose of the bin-xdvi.win32 package then anyway?

Normal Windows users do not play with the tlmgr in the first place (as 
long as everything is working). The button had the advantage, that those 
same users could incorporate proprietary fonts (Futura) with relative 
ease when provided with a TDS-ready archive and short step-by-step guide 
(by me, obviously :).

It isn't helpful. Could the search function of texdoctk be 'redirected' 
to call texdoc somehow?

I have no idea, but you might use 'print /D:PRN filename' as 
alternative, where '/D:' gives the device and where PRN=LPT1 (see 
http://www.ss64.com/index.html)

Ah, but you need to run it only when you need to deliver PS.  For your
text editing needs, you can cycle between latex (with DVI engine) and
xdvi (heck, xdvi will just update without manual need to reload).

And since latex/DVI will not even _look_ at the graphics, this tends to
be lots faster than latex/PDF which has to include and resource-resolve
graphics every single run.

Even when you are just doing the latex/latex/bibtex/latex cycle.

If you put all *.eps to the same directory, you can open DOS window,
cd to that directory and type:

for %e in (*.eps) do epstopdf %e

Then you take a beer or whatever and in the meantime all your EPS will
be converted to PDF ready for inclusion into pdf(la)tex.

Exactly my point. That is why I'd prefer to have a DVI-viewer in the 
standard installation for windows...

The standard buffer size of the windows console is only 300 lines, so 
the whole log will not be accessible anyway (at least for non-minimal 
installations).

Message-ID: <48A2EA81.8040001@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi All,

two questions/comments on the tlmgr 2008 (apart from the missing 
updmap.cfg-button):

1) A button to select all previously not installed packages for 
installation would be nice.

2) While trying to select _all_ packages via keyboard, CTRL-A is not 
working. Selecting the first package and pressing SHIFT-CTRL-END does 
not either. But selecting the first package, then the second  with 
SHIFT-DOWN and then the rest with SHIFT-CTRL-END does. Strange.
With all packages marked, pressing the button to install the selected 
packages, tlmgr finishes in under 3 seconds and does exactly nothing. I 
rather expected it to install all those packages not installed yet...

Best Regards,
  Gregor

Can't the step-by-step guide just say to open an command-line and run
updmap(-sys) --enable-map foo.map ?

That's precisely the kind of change I don't want to do (especially now). The
whole texdoctk thing assumes the results comes from the database with extra
info etc.  I don't want to spend time hacking the texdoctk code.

Sure texdoc needs a GUI version, but I honestly doubt texdoctk is a good
starting point for this, and I'd rather wirte something from scratch. But later.

This means that we cannot put a useful default value, if we need to know the
device name? If so, I'll keep the current value.

Anyway, I don't see what this print function is good for. IMO, documentation
should be in a well-known format, namely pdf, html or plain text, that anyone
knows how to print, and texdoctk shouldn't try to do things like converting to
ps and printing itself. I mean, once the doc is opened in a viewer the user
can click on the viewer's "print" button, can't she?

OK, that is the scenario that would have occurred yesterday :

1) In Explorer, navigate to last year's TeX Live --

	D:\TeX\Live\2007

2) Highlight text in TeXMF box

3) Paste in copied location --

	D:\TeX\Live\2007

4) Highlit text did not disappear

5) Erase "7" and replace with "8"

6) Manually delete highlit text.

not really.  tex live has to be sure that the licence of a piece of
software permits its distribution.  there are licence statements for the
other software in the linguex directory, but no common statement, and
nothing in cgloss at all.

likewise, there is no licence statement for anything at all in the gb4e
directory.

often, in cases like this, one can deduce from hints in the code that
it's supposed to be distributed freely.  this is one of the 700 such
ctan packages on my list which has no indication whatever about how it
may be distributed.

if you are in contact with the authors, it would be good if they were to
get in contact with this mailing list, or with us on the ctan list, to
remedy the situation.  however, from my pov, i don't imagine the tex-
live team would think themselves at liberty to include the package.

as i've already said, i don't believe the gb4e stuff ought to be on tex
live at all.

i've discussed with karl the need for sorting these "unknown" licence
statements in the catalogue: gb4e is one of those packages that will (in
the new world) be classified as "noinfo" (i.e., no information provided
about licensing conditions).

It should (also) be mentioned in one of the pages referenced in

Besides, unpacking a TDS-ready archive in the right place already
assumes that users know their way around somewhat in their TeX
installations, and most users don't.

If OTOH it is turned into a TeX Live package then this can be done
in the postinstall.

I guess it is too late to remove print support altogether.

Oh, the licences problem again.  Well, I don't think it's good to rm things
form TL without contacting the author and asking him to clarify if the status
is just noinfo and the stuff is not clearly non-free.  And this takes time as
you probably know very well.  I'm not sure I want to do this right know...
Putting the thing on my list anyway.

By the way, it would be great to share efforts concerning this licence thing.
 It's obviously a huge task, and it would be bad to double or triple-check
some packages just because the TL peoples don't know what has been checked by
the Ctan people or vice-versa. (The Debian guys are also interested in
comprehensive licence check I think, and maybe others linux/bsd/whatever
distro may be interested in it.)

What do you (Robin, ctan-ers, Karl, others) think of discussing a
collaborative structure to share information about what is to be done, what
has already be done, author contacts, etc. some day in the near future?

Same with me. Either someone comes with a ready to copy-paste solution, or I

Sure. Anyway, I don't want o touch anything in the texdoctk code now, and
probably not in the future either.  I just wanted to point out that this is
not a very serious problem, and also that IMO there's a lot of (now) useless
things in texdoctk's code that bloat it.

Manuel.

PS: I changed the "Search" button text to "search texdoctk's database" and
added a line "Try `texdoc $string' in a command line." to the "not found"
dialog. Hope that helps. (r10308, available in tomorrow's installer)

I didn't think. But it would be nice to have third-party TL
packages - later.

i don't believe there's a choice.  any author who wants can declare that
a package is available for use in distributions such as tl (or miktex).
suppose that an author didn't think of it, but when he finds his/her
package on tex live, he/she is enraged: but the first we hear of it is
when the lawyers appear at the door.

in short, if it's agreed that a package got in to tl by mistake, then it
has to come out again.  the author can restore the situation later, but
in the short term the thing has to go.  (this happened recently with the
cryst fonts.)

first, we can't "just" share author contacts ... in today's world of
organised crime attempting to "break" the internet by filling all our
bandwidth with spam.

so any such collaboration has to be closed.  having said which, i've
already made moves to share catalogue information (as you know).

so i'm all in favour of sharing, although the state of my health is such
that i can't in all honesty take on the job of setting something up.

(of course, i _do_ have to work: somehow pulling the extensive notes i
have into a shape that it's possible to share...  it's just that in the
present situation, my usual incompetence at organisation is enhanced
by a frightening factor.  :-( )

Gregor, believe me, everybody involved in TeX Live development is

simply too late to change anything.

    That is why I'd prefer to have a DVI-viewer in the

We don't "omit" it because we want to.  We don't provide one because
there is none to provide.

If someone wants to come forward and do the substantial work involved in
getting a native DVI viewer for Windows working in the context of TeX
Live, that would be great.  Do not think it is trivial.  Here are some
options that come to mind, in no particular order:

- work with the dviout author to make it use kpse and the standard
  configuration setup (if he's willing; or maintain patches, if he's not);
- start from the old Y&Y previewer code, which is now free (but it
  relies on ATM, so font rendering would have to come from somewhere
  else).  http://tug.org/yandy
- resurrect Fabrice's windvi from fptex.
- see about making yap from miktex work in TeX Live.
- plenty more I'm not thinking of offhand.

TeX Live is a volunteer effort.

    The package linguex (used for examples in linguistics) requires
    cgloss4e.sty. 

I changed things so that gb4e is included in collection-humanities
(where linguex is) instead of collection-latexextra.  So one will have
to go to a lot of trouble to get one package and not the other now.

Although Robin is certainly correct in principle that we should not
distribute packages without any licensing info, I don't think a couple
of days before the final build is the right time to delete them all
(many, many, many).

In any case, I see that gb4e is derived from midnight and covington
which are free, so we can conclude gb4e is (other-)free also.  (Robin, I
believe midnight should be other-free (barely), not unknown.)

I don't know about xdv, but there are programs to convert PDF to
PostScript.  Perhaps one of them would do something useful.

Because they come from two different packages: hieroglf and archaic.  
The elder hieroglf could be left out, because its integrated into  
archaic. The hieroglf-* file names in the archaic package could be re- 
organised.

I mentioned a simple solution some time ago but maybe nobody took me
serious because the solution had been *so* simple.  We have a great
PostScript viewer already.  Supporting dvi is extremely easy.  All
what ps_view has to do is to invoke dvips when the input file has the
extension ".dvi" and then display the resulting PostScript code.

I suppose that about 5 lines of Lua code will make it work.

Certainly too late for TL-2008.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] problems installing TL08 on WinXP
Message-ID: <C4C85B72.10F24%adam.maxwell@pnl.gov>

I tried using the bootstrap installer as recommended by this page:

http://gentoo.chem.wisc.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/README

to install TL 2008 on a Windows XP Pro system, but the install fails.  It
looks like none of the formats are created, and manual attempts to run
updmap-sys or tlmgr from the Windows shell result in " No appropriate script
found." messages.  Log file attached.

I first tried a medium install with some additional packages added via the
installer GUI, then tried a full install with the same results.  Let me know
if I can provide additional info; using Windows is not my forte.  I'm using
TL08 on Mac OS X, and was hoping to get a Windows-using colleague to use it
as well.

thanks,

It's not impossible, but no-one has felt sufficiently motivated to  
write the code.

You can, of course, use xdvipdfmx to convert xdv to pdf, and then your  
favorite utility (e.g., ghostscript) to generate postscript from the  
pdf. But I guess you meant something more direct.

The obvious way forward would be to add the necessary extensions to  
dvips. But I don't know of anyone planning to work on it. For most  
people, pdf is the most useful format to generate, and if you really  
need ps it can be derived from that.

Did your colleague have some other version of TeX installed?  There may be
some environment variables that conflict with the new version.  I see that the
install directory is "C:\Program Files\\texlive\2008\bin\win32".  While this
should work, I think some ConTeXt tools have problems with the space in
the path, so I used F:\texlive\2008 for my own (more successful) testing.

The problems appear to start with:

[...]
running mktexlsr C:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-var
running updmap-sys... updmap.bat: updmap: No appropriate script found.
done
re-running mktexlsr C:/Program Files/texlive/2008/texmf-var
[...]

After this the installer attempts to create formats, but the input files
also aren't found.   Maybe the ls-R files were't really generated, or
there is a problem with searching those files, so

1.  are the ls-R files being created properly?

2.  if so, does kpsewhich find files:

It might be useful to peek into the ls-R files to
see if they look like the ones on a working installation.  What
happens if you run "mktexlsr" from the command line?   Try,
e.g.:

  ----------------------------------------------------------
F:\TeXLive\2008\bin\win32>mktexlsr --help
Usage: mktexlsr [--quiet|--silent] [DIRS ...]

Rebuild all necessary ls-R filename databases completely. If one or
more arguments DIRS are given, these are used as texmf directories to
build ls-R for. Else all directories in the search path for ls-R files
($TEXMFDBS) are used.
   ---------------------------------------------------------

The try, e.g.,:
  -------------------------------------------------------
F:\TeXLive\2008\bin\win32>kpsewhich story.tex
f:/TeXLive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/plain/base/story.tex
  -------------------------------------------------------

There are extensive debugging options for kpsewhich,
but first check for environment variables such as
TEXINPUTS that may conflict.

I've moved the network location for TL packages from .../tldev to

but it will doubtless take a couple days for all the mirrors to sync up.

This doesn't mean we're quite frozen, but we are getting pretty chilly :).
All the TL doc translations have been updated, and all the binaries
have been updated.  We shouldn't make anything more than really simple
changes at this point.

I'll let the regular updates happen for another night or two and get any
final package updates.  Then Manfred can put together the final DVD

I'm actually using my own Windows box as a guinea pig, since I don't care if
it has a working TeX; now that you mention it, I have (had) an old version
of MikTeX installed on it.  I'd checked environment variables and didn't see
anything obviously fishy.

Installing to "Program Files" was the default setting, which I thought was
odd as well.  I actually tried redoing the install rooted at c:\texlive\2008
and had the same failure, though.

So I started removing MikTeX before reading all of your message, and that
process was barely underway when I tried rerunning mktexlsr.  I was able to
run mktexlsr and updmap-sys successfully at that time, so this was either
due to MikTeX or failure of mktexlsr during install.  I also ran tlmgr and
used it to generate formats, so things seem to be working fine now.  Sorry I
can't nail down the problem more specifically, but thanks a lot for the
hints!  I'll try reinstalling without MikTeX and see if it succeeds.

thanks,
Adam

I have MikTeX-2.7on my XP box.  I run TL from a command shell
with:

REM gotl.cmd -- start cmd shell with environment configured for TeX Live 2008
REM MiKTeX sets/uses TEXINPUTS
SET TEXINPUTS=
SET TLroot=F:\TeXLive\2008
REM SET TEXMFCNF=%TLroot%\texmf-var\web2c
REM SET TEXMFTEMP=%TLroot%\temp
PATH %TLroot%\bin\win32
PATH %PATH%;C:\Program Files\Xming\bin
[...]
cmd

My guess is that you still had a TEXINPUTS set by MikTeX, which has the
strange looking value:

C:\Documents and Settings\WhiteG>set TEXINPUTS
TEXINPUTS=./macros

As long as you are careful with the environment variables you can
have TL2008 and MiKTeX-2.7 on the same system.

Eeek.  I was banking on having a bit of time left after the binary

Agreed.  Please don't rush this last stage.  As
of yesterday, I was still getting "s///" errors,
and until my mirroring of 2008 completes, I
cannot re-test that aspect of the installation
process.

    Because they come from two different packages: hieroglf and archaic.  
    The elder hieroglf could be left out, because its integrated into

Right.  I deleted hieroglf.

Mirrored Cambridge this evening and then
installed; all seems fine, no problems
during the closing phases of the install.
Of course, I haven't actually tried any

Subject: [tex-live] request to package sketch among the context packages
Message-ID: <m2od3v2jqd.fsf@stanford.edu>

In place of Gene Ressler, the developer for the sketch package
(http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/sketch/), I would like to
request the latest version of his package be counted among the packages
that get installed when one chooses to install scheme-context in the TeX
Live 2008.  The new version of the package contains support for ConTeXt,
so it would make sense to count sketch as a friend of ConTeXt.

Thanks,

Jesse

    (http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/sketch/), I would like to

Regrettably, sketch has never been included in TeX Live, and won't be
in this release, either.

It is nontrivial to include new compiled programs.  For starters, we'd
need a standard configure script and Makefile, to support building
outside the source directory ... if Gene can do that, or if someone else
would like to come forward to help with it, great, it could conceivably
be included in the future.

The domain was stolen, see

IMHO, this is OK: The README file explains what the files in this

Arthur,

    The following README files are probably not where they really belong.  

Thanks for the report (and the follow-up, Heiko), but there are far
worse problems than this in terms of duplicated/wrong files in the
runtime, all of which have existed for years.  We fixed some this years,
and Heiko and others have written scripts to detect them, but many
remain.  It is an extremely time-consuming process to correct.
The multiple README's are harmless in comparison.

    Sorry I can't tell you about TL2008; I have been unsuccessful in  
    downloading it so far (broken link).

Perhaps your mirror has not caught up with the tldev->2008 change yet
(just guessing).  You could get it directly from tug.org or one of the
CTAN backbones, e.g.,
ftp://tug.org//texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip

Why should it? Ctrl-A happens to NOT be the universal "select-all" thing.
I agree that we could add some more key bindings, but honestly it is
quite a pain to know what people expect as default key bindings on
systems from Win to Unix to Mac. Mixing all that with the peculiarities
of the Perl/Tk system ...

Shift-Ctrl-End never worked here on my unix system, didn't even know that
it should work.

That is interesting. I just tried it and it succeeded under unix.

On windows I guess that is again a problem with the command line lenght.
Hard to work around ATM. Your best bet is to simply select all collections
and press install, then in fact all packages will be installed.

Best wishes

Subject: [tex-live] Files in TEXMFHOME are ignored
Message-ID: <1289741637@web.de>

Hello,

after installing texlive 2008 (OpenSuse 11) I put those lines in the .profile

# texlive 2008

PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export INFOPATH

Everthing seems to work fine, except that  all files in /home/AW/texmf are ignored. There are beta-KOMA-script files and -- important -- many local fonts. updmap-sys can't find my Map files, and even after putting a local file "home.cfg" in the home TDS this command

tlmgr generate updmap --localcfg /home/AW/texmf/home.cfg

neither works as User AW ("Cannot open /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg for writing: Keine Berechtigung at /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1271, <FOO> line 5.") nor as root (no output).

In the texmf.cnf I changed line 114 to:

TEXMF = {!!$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

and 135 to

TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST,!!$TEXMFDOC}

I beg your pardon in case it's a stupid question, but how can I use my local fonts?

Thank you very much,
Regards,
Alexander

Actually, there's nothing wrong with otftotfm in this case. The bug is
in the texnansx.enc file shipped by texlive (even 2008). It contains:
/Uni20AC % /Euro 1. This is broken because Unicode code points need to
be specified with /uniXXXX in PostScript names, i.e. starting with
lowercase u. Actually /Euro works too because it's in the Adobe Glyph
List installed by lcdf-typetools; the original texnansi.enc uses
/Euro.

The most reasonable fix is to change texnansx.enc. I grepped through
the other encodings shipped with texlive, and there's no other
/UniXXXX, or even /uniXXXX for that matter, but some other encodings
do use /Euro. So for consistency /Euro seems be the best option.

There's not much point in changing otftotfm to accommodate this sole
occurrence of UniXXXX.

(You can work around the bug in texnansx.enc with a --unicoding option: 
"--unicoding 'Uni20AC =: uni20AC'".

Hi,

Thanks for writing.

   tlmgr generate updmap --localcfg /home/AW/texmf/home.cfg

Hmm.  Do you have an ls-R file in /home/AW/texmf?  If so, try removing it.

Also, I'm not sure if a ~/texmf without any subdir structure will work
with updmap.  Although I would have expected your invocation above to
find it, for sure.

    In the texmf.cnf I changed line 114 to:
    TEXMF = {!!$TEXMFHOME,...

And that helped, or not?  There should be no reason to make that change.

    nor as root (no output).

Saying "it doesn't work" isn't much help in debugging.  Can you look at
the actual /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg after
running as root and see if your home.cfg got appended to it?

Best,
Karl

That is strange. Do you have some environment variables (like TEXMFCNF)

Right, calling it as user tries to overwrite a root.root file, so that
will not work. But you could use --dest for writing it somewhere else.

As root it should not give an output. And did you call
	updmap-sys 
after updating the updmap.cfg files??? The manpage of tlmgr clearly
states that it generates the config files. That does not mean that the
actual upd* is called.

Are there instruction available for how to install those (separately

There is nothing to install.  Unpack/transfer them.   Done.

The README in the source/ tree explains what to do with the binaries you
built, namely move them to <tlroot>/bin/<tlplatformname>.
The other trees are likewise subdirs of <tlroot>.
In general, the idea is that you want to mimic the way TL's Master/ tree
appears.

Hope this helps,

Debian has always used the catalogue to store the information 

$ grep -A1 license entries/a/acronym.xml 
  <license type='lppl' version='1.17' checked='2006-03-07'
  username='frank' file='header'/>

> so i'm all in favour of sharing

What are the pieces of information that are missing?

a) more detailed license information: 

   - I think "lppl" means some "or
     later" clause, but I'm not sure, and I'm not sure whether I've indicated
     any "exactly version $foo" somehow.

   - Which files are covered (this is important in particular for font
     stuff)

b) Info for following up on issues, like 

   - author could be contacted at $date by $collaborator under
     $e-mail at address.

   - $collaborator is currently in contact with

   - don't bother to try to get the license changed, this will stay
     non-free

Oh, I wasn't aware of the "checked" field. Good news that it already exists.

Agreed, and also there should be a way to indicate contradictory statements,
like "lppl any version" and "you shall not modify" in the same file, as it
sometimes happens.

it's not exactly common (it came as a surprise to me, for sure -- a
whole bunch of people who i'd never heard of, checking new versions in
that make no difference to the user-displayed output).

i've done a few myself, but it's ineffably tedious -- as witness the
tiny number of entries thus marked in the several thousand total in the
catalogue.

which, is being interpreted, "other-nonfree".  i changed a package from
lppl to nosell this morning, since the author had added the proviso that
no part of it should be included in a package for sale.

i can't record that in the present structure.

this lot merely skims the surface of the collaboration issue.

at present, there are two people who write catalogue entries: rainer s
(for the packages he installs) and me (for everything else, and for
packages who never had an entry in the first place).

it's easy for us to collaborate.  if someone else (e.g., karl) finds a
problem, they can mail one of us and we'll put it right.

to widen the collaboration, we need something better supporting the
enterprise, than a subversion server.  (imo)

as the (only) person who does significant quality work on the catalogue,
i've lots of scrappy little notes about what's in progress, what needs
to be done, whatever...  if we set up a collaboration, we need something
to hold scrappy little notes, not well structured statements about
entries.  work in progress, that is.  not necessarily related to a
catalogue entry.

i have no idea how to do such a thing.  but then i've already said i
want no part of setting up collaboration: i merely offer to collaborate
if i'm wanted when the time comes.

Yep, that's why it is very important to avoid loosing information about what
has been done. I hope this field is or will be used by all involved people.

If it remains like that, sure. But sometimes it just means the author made a
mistake (as with the (in)famous docstrip default headers) and should be
contacted for clarification.

Well, looks like Frank sometimes do, to.  Anyway, frank and other people in
Debian are checking licenses and are share the information (positive and
negative) up to the Catalogue.

Oh. I was precisely beginning to think that the svn of the Catalogue could be
a good basis. Let's read your arguments.

In TL we have a TODO file at the root. Not that it's the perfect tool, but a
free-form field in each entry and a few free-text todo files in the svn could
be of some help for such scrappy little notes.

Well, currently we have the good old mail-robin-when-encounter-problem method
of collaboration. The question is, do we need a more effective method (who
would use it) and what needs to be done to set it up (then who wants to set it
up).

Message-ID: <20080818143858.GA20012@dhcp-lab-186.brq.redhat.com>

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce first success to package TeX Live 2008 fully
automatically to RPM. This was possible thanks to the great design
of tlpkg metadata that is very easy parsable. And it is actually a
result of desperate need to package TeX Live in some sensible way in
Fedora.

The RPMs are created by a bash script [1] that resolves a dependency
tree for given set of schemes/collections/packages and generates
package descriptions, filelists and requirements. Then a final spec is
generated from "_main.spec" template.

The script allows either to have each package separately within one
huge spec file which will result in a possibility to install any
package in TeX Live 2008 separately, but with the cost of very high
number of subpackages (~4000+). Another option is to have only schemes
and collections within spec with an assumption that collections won't
conflict. This reduces number of subpackages to ~400.

The generated specs can be seen here [2] for TeX Live to be packaged
solely to schemes and collections and here [3] for one RPM subpackage
for each TeX Live package (+collections and schemes dependent on
them).

Please note that the script is still under development and it doesn't
yet generate %post actions for packages even though the code is mostly
designed but untested (and heavily based on install-tl).

The size-sorted list of RPMs for the collection only install can be
seen in [4].

[2] http://people.redhat.com/jnovy/files/texlive/texlive-only_collections.spec
[3] http://people.redhat.com/jnovy/files/texlive/texlive-all_packages.spec
[4] http://people.redhat.com/jnovy/files/texlive/texlive-rpmlist.txt

P.S. I found some insistencies within TeX Live package database,
particularly broken dependencies in:

collection-graphicstools
- caused by missing bin-pngtools for all Unix-like arches

and

Hi Jindrich,

    collection-graphicstools
    - caused by missing bin-pngtools for all Unix-like arches
    collection-xetex
    - caused by missing xecyr package for Unix-like arches

Can't you just consider them empty packages when they are for Windows
only?  That is what we do, more or less.

(The existence of xecyr is a mistake, by the way.  I'll fix that eventually.)

    what prevented me to include scheme-gust, scheme-full and
    scheme-medium so they are excluded from the above lists.

I'm not sure what role schemes play in your rpm world, if any, but in
principle scheme-full is very important!  It is, in fact, the default as
far as our "native" installation goes and I hope installing everything
will be the default for Fedora too.

Thanks,
karl

Message-ID: <4BA166BE-7E5E-402B-8BF5-560FB29EEEC3@sbcglobal.net>

I successfully installed TL2008 (thanks for the tips on how to find  
the install-tl software).

After the install, the script sends me to

>  See
>    /usr/local/texlive/2008/index.html
>  for links to documentation...

That web page has a link to /usr/local/texlive/2008/readme-html.dir/ 
readme.en.html, which has the following statement:
> <p>We also provide a list of <a href="../doc.html">links to the  
> available PDF and HTML documentation</a> for the included packages  
> and programs.

What a great idea! This file, however does not exist.

Also, I wanted to refer to the pdftex manual, which in TL2007 is in

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/doc/pdftex/manual/pdftex*.pdf

However, in TL2008, there is no directory

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/pdftex

Also present in 2007 and absent in 2008:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/chktex
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/latex
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/pdfcrop
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/texi2html
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/lists
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/texdoc

I particularly miss /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/lists, because it  
shows what files are where for any package.

The problem is that there is "depend xecyr.ARCH" in section related to
xecyr in the texlive.tlpdb so there is no way for a dependency
resolver to figure out the package is available solely for win32.
Replacing it with "depend xecyr.win32" will solve it.

The similar case is collection-wintools. It is for win32 arch exclusively but
there is no way to find it out. Is it possible to add something like
"exclusivearch win32" or similar to such packages to reflect they are
useless for other arches? Currently I have it manually blacklisted.

The schemes are generated from metadata from TeX Live so they are
basically the same. I agree that including scheme-full is essential,
but I'm not sure whether it should be default for the downstream
packaging. Initially I thought that scheme-basic will suffice. The
reason for it is that not everybody needs full TeX Live installation
and also many programs have build dependencies to TeX Live just to
build documentation. So installing scheme-full to fullfil that seems a
waste of resources to me. On the other hand, user who wants a full
TeX Live installation could have it via "yum instal 
texlive-scheme-full". Are you ok with it?

Thanks,
Jindrich

My mistake, I thought I already done this. Hmm, oh, I remember: I was
hesitating between pst-user.pdf and pstricks-doc.pdf. Looks like I finally
chose none :-(

I'll fix it as soon as the commit freeze is over. Thanks for your suggestion.

The real "waste of resources" is not the extra network bandwidth and disk space
of installing a whack of extra packages, it is the future costs of having
documentation that fails to compile due to reliance on macro packages, etc.
that didn't stand the test of time.  Document writers, who are often only
vaguely familiar with TeX and don't want to learn more than is
necessary to get the document written, will encounter some formatting
problem and seek advice
from the web or a colleague who uses LaTeX for papers.

The problem with using texlive-scheme-full for situations where you are
only building documentation is that people will not be discouraged from
using packages which may not be supported in the long run.  There
needs to be a scheme which has essentially the capabilities of teTeX,
and which includes only well-supported packages that are expected to
be available over the long term.

Having a scheme-basic will tend to ensure that the contents are widely
used and will create some interest in seeing that the functionality is
still available in TL2032, so to some extent you don't have to predict
which packages will endure -- just choose a set that gives the
functionality required for documentation and basic reports and articles.

    The problem is that there is "depend xecyr.ARCH" in section related to
    xecyr in the texlive.tlpdb so there is no way for a dependency
    resolver to figure out the package is available solely for win32.

Sorry, I still don't exactly understand why it is a problem.  How about
simply inferring it from the fact that there is no xecyr.<arch> in tlpdb
for anything but w32?  That's what we do, I think.

In other words, given "depend xecyr.ARCH" in texlive.tlpdb, if there is
no package named "xecyr.i386-linux" (or whatever), then you just ignore it.

Oh, maybe there is another answer: I could move the xecyr .bat's into a
separate package, say xecyr-w32.  Then the xecyr package could say
"depend xecyr-w32.win32" and there would be the explicit clue that it is
for Windows only.

I could move pngtools into wintools to get rid of that special case, but
I guess it won't help unless xecyr gets solved.  (BTW, I was thinking of
another package when I said before that it should be removed; xecyr is
fine and should stay.)

Perhaps Norbert can be of more help here ... Norbert?

    Replacing it with "depend xecyr.win32" will solve it.

I guess in theory; in practice I don't think the current code has any
way to intuit such a thing when it's generating tlpdb.  It seems overly
complex to add all that for this one tiny case.

    The similar case is collection-wintools. It is for win32 arch
    exclusively but there is no way to find it out.

Aside from the above, it's not unreasonable to have a special case for
collection-wintools, since it is, well, special.  It is the only
collection not contained in any scheme and is magically installed (by
default) only on Windows.

I'll answer about default schemes separately.

Thanks,
k

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0808200129080.26142-100000@staw.homedns.org>

I found that ctan nodes have the following layout in tlnet/2008/
 archive/
 install-tl/ *)
 tlpkg/
 install-tl.zip
 install-tl-unx.tar.gz
 README

I think that *) (unpacked install-tl.zip) can be only missleading
and I'd suggest to remove it. The main reason is that *) contains also
tlpkg/ directory and if someone downloads (or makes mirror) the whole
structure, then tries to run install-tl/install-tl[.bat] for installation
from the local disk, it doesn't work. Sorry for my poor wording of the 
problem, anyway my recommendation is:
1. to remove install-tl/ directory from CTAN

2. for installation from the net just get install-tl.zip or 
   install-tl-unx.tar.gz, unpack it and follow the instructions as already 
   described in the TeX Live Guide

3. for installation/update from mirrored archive/*.tar.lzma files
   to make things work we need the following layout on the local disk:
   install-tl/ (from unpacked .zip or .tar.gz)
   install-tl/archive/ (mirrored, containing the updated stuff) 
   install-tl/tlpkg/   (mirrored, containing the current database)

OK, seems somehow complicated, but I'd suggest to make mirrors in
already made install-tl/ directory somewhere on the local disk, then move 
.zip (.tar.gz) to the parrent directory, unpack it, etc.
All in all, install-tl[.bat] script works as follows:
./tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb  finds here database
./archive/*.tar.lzma   finds here compressed packages (otherwise uses
                       unpacked files from DVD)
That was the only way to have the same installer for DVD and compressed 
packages stored on the hard disk. Uff!

All the best,

i'm not keen to start excluding things from our mirror of texlive: such
things provide endless boring hours of tidying up, ime.

so, short of direct instruction from (in effect) the whole tl team, this
change isn't going to happen here -- it needs to happen on the tug box i
mirror from.

I am responsible for asking for this directory,

my reason for asking for it was the very thing

That is exactly what I did, and as far as
I can tell, it /did/ work !  What is the
problem that you anticipate happening
when this is tried, Staszek ?

Agreed. I'd even go one step further: CTAN is a redistribution point for TeX 
Live, so we keep a copy, no changes.

Subject: [tex-live] A fix for (pdf)LaTeX support for Romanian
Message-ID: <bef0d710808200508l42cac1a8x6d4b19119448ad34@mail.gmail.com>

0) No single LaTeX (8-bit) encoding has all the characters required
for Romanian. T1 doesn't have S and T with comma below, but with
cedilla), while QX doesn't have A breve. LY1 doesn't have any of
these. Using only visual composites (overlapping boxes) is
unacceptable in PDF documents because searches don't work properly.

1) Latin 10 (latin10.def) disambiguated the comma-below and cedillas
by providing new LICRs for comma-below glyphs using \textcommabelow as
diacritic command. More importantly, these LICRs are also used by
utf8x for the U+0218 -- U+021B range. Both latin10 and utf8x input
encodings are thus correctly configured for Romanian. But these new
LICRs aren't used in the QX font encoding, the only one that provides
the comma-below glyphs. The following lines need to be added to
qxenc.def:

\DeclareTextComposite{\textcommabelow}{QX}{S}{147} % /Scommaaccent
\DeclareTextComposite{\textcommabelow}{QX}{T}{149} % /Tcommaaccent
\DeclareTextComposite{\textcommabelow}{QX}{s}{179} % /scommaaccent
\DeclareTextComposite{\textcommabelow}{QX}{t}{181} % /tcommaaccent

The comments to right of each line show the corresponding PS name in
qx.enc. All 4 are already properly implemented by Latin Modern and the
TeX Gyre fonts.

After the above additions one can type (using utf8x since latin10 is
obsolete as input method):
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1,QX]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\begin{document}
\Huge Romanian diacritics: {\fontencoding{QX}\selectfont
??}{\fontencoding{T1}\selectfont ???!}
\end{document}

All diacritics, except for T with comma below, which is affected by
yet another bug (see next point), are now searchable in the output of
pdflatex. So please add those 4 lines to qxenc.def. Note that
qxenc.def already has some mappings from the cedilla variants, i.e. \c
[STst] to those slots. I suggest you delete them. If you're worried
about backwards compatibility, you can leave those alone, even though
they are typographically and Unicode-wise incorrect; obviously no
Turks used the QX encoding, or you'd have heard about it ;)

2) When one searches the PDF for [Tt] with comma below, these glyphs
cannot be found as U+021[AB], but can be found as U+016[23]. There's a
general snafu with how LaTeX's utf8x input mode and the pdf output
drivers (dvipdfmx) and engines (pdftex) interact. This isn't
restricted just to Romanian, so I'm sending a separate email, with
more addresses in the CC field for that matter. Stay tuned...

3) Having to change font encodings every few characters would drive
anyone crazy, so the sane thing to do is to select only the commands
from T1 and QX encodings that provide proper composites. I had to dig
through ltoutenc's documentation to figure it out. In the end, the
preamble commands are pretty simple:

% get a composite A breve from T1
\UndeclareTextCommand{\u}{QX}
\DeclareTextCommandDefault{\u}[1]{\fontencoding{T1}\selectfont\u #1}
% get composite comma-below S and T from QX
\UndeclareTextCommand{\textcommabelow}{T1}
\DeclareTextCommandDefault{\textcommabelow}[1]{\fontencoding{QX}\selectfont\textcommabelow
#1}
% get Euro from QX
\DeclareTextSymbolDefault{\texteuro}{QX}
% Cedillas are not used in Romanian, except perhaps for Turkish names
% get the composite S and T cedilla from T1 just in case
\UndeclareTextCommand{\c}{QX}
\DeclareTextCommandDefault{\c}[1]{\fontencoding{T1}\selectfont\c #1}

Using these, the default encoding can be either T1 or QX. The gotcha
for which I needed to read ltoutenc's documentation is that simply
using \DeclareTextAccentDefault{\u}{T1} does not result in proper
using composites being used. The reason is that only the accent is
rendered in T1 encoding, the letter is still from QX if that's the
default encoding used. I've read in the Companion that this is the
intended behavior, even though it doesn't seem the most useful to me
since it will never use any composites that way.

This stuff is too simple to be worth a CTAN package, but I'll drop the
info on a web page somewhere...

Thanks,
Vasile

OK, Phil. Once again: 
1. you have downloaded from CTAN the whole structure _as it is_, right?
   archive/
   install-tl/
   tlpkg/
   install-tl.zip
   install-tl-unx.tar.gz

2. cd install-tl
3. install-tl.bat
4. it works, but _only_ for installing from the net, eg.:
Platform:  win32  => ' Windows '
Distribution: net  (downloading)
Using URL: http://mirror.icis.pcz.pl/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
Directory for temporary files: ' c:/TEMP '
Installer directory: 'c:/tl08/install-tl'
Loading http://mirror.icis.pcz.pl/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
Installer revision: 10347
Database revision: 10341

So archive/ and tlpkg/ on your disk aren't sourced. That's all.

As it was after Karl created the directory I requested.
Not "as it is today", because I haven't tried it today,
but I'm happy to if you think something may have
changed.

Are you sure ? I used Norbert's "-location"

Ok, I can do it like that. I thought it was a mistake since one
win32-only arch dependency is aleady present within tlpkg:

$ grep "^depend\ .*win32$" texlive.tlpdb
depend bin-wintools.win32

and there is only all arches present when there is depend <name>.ARCH
in tlpkg.

Thanks,
Jindrich

Hi Phil,
thanks for mentioning %time%.  I had not been aware of it yet.
However, it's not necessary here, wget prints time-stamps already.

I must admit that I don't understand why this extra directory bothers
you.  People should either download install-tl-unx.tar.gz or
install-tl.zip.  Why should anybody want to download this directory
unless he knows what it is good for?  People who are misled by
install-tl/ might also be misled by the archive/ directory and
probably downlowd all the .tar.lzma before they know what to do with
them.  IMO it's not worthwhile to consider this case. 

The stuff which is already on CTAN is fine: There is a file
http://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/README which
includes links to the complete TeX Live documentation. Do we need
more?  I doubt.  It would be nice to have a file "QUICK_INSTALL" for
experienced users in the same directory but it's not urgent. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks. There were no email addresses given for the authors listed in
the qx files, so I couldn't figure out who to contact further
upstream.

I think you're right, because googling for "latex romanian" gives me:
1) An 1996-vintage RomanianTeX package on CTAN, which requires
rebuilding latex.fmt; clearly overkill these days.
2) Some web pages that recommend using utf8x or latin10 input
encodings, but no word on font encodings.

So, I will make a tiny package for CTAN package after all.

doesn't the babel package turn up?  i don't know who suggested it, but i
seem to have:

    A LaTeX2e package for type-setting Romanian in a TeX environment.
    For LaTeX use, the package has been superseded by the Romanian
    option of <xref refid='babel'>babel</xref>.

in the catalogue for romaniantex.  (i had taken it to be a package
rather than a format, from reading the readme rather than the code.
building a format, there, is merely to get hyphenation patterns loaded,
which is done rather more simply nowadays using the distribution config
command.)

good.  it's the sort of thing that will end up being swept up into some
other package, but it's good to make life easier for other users in the
mean time.

Well it's good that it was marked obsolete.  But both the old package
and the babel romanian.{sty,ldf} files use cedilla glyphs for
Romanian, which is incorrect. Unicode added the proper comma-below
code-points in 1999 (version 3.0). People patched latin10
[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=119531] and utf8x
[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234338] input
encodings with the new comma-below LICRs, but they forgot about font
encodings and babel it seems. Babel doesn't set up the fonts encodings
anyway, because it's not its job.

It will probably be necessary to write a new ldf for babel, or provide
the current one with an  option between cedilla/comma-below. How was
the 1996 German writing spelling reform handled? Note in the case of
Romanian there was no spelling reform for the comma-below glyphs; only
Unicode was "reformed" in 1999 to handle it. FYI:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_alphabet#Unicode_and_HTML

BTW, it would be nice if TeXLive had bug tracking system of its own...

That's cool with me, although I'm not aware of any package that
automatically sets up font encodings for various languages like babel
does for hyphenation...

Two separate ldf/sty files, for old and new, germanb and ngermanb. (In case of 
german, there is the additonal complication of another set of .sty files, 
outside of babel, that were in widespread use. Hence the peculiar names 
(n)german.sty (non-babel) and (n)germanb.sty (babel).)

    I agree that including scheme-full is essential, but I'm not sure
    whether it should be default for the downstream packaging.
    Initially I thought that scheme-basic will suffice. The reason for
    it is that not everybody needs full TeX Live installation and also
    many programs have build dependencies to TeX Live just to build
    documentation. 

Sure, I understand.

    So installing scheme-full to fullfil that seems a waste of resources
    to me.
    
Perhaps the ideal would be for those packages that use TeX for
documentation to depend not just on "TeX Live" in general, but to a
texlive-scheme-basic, texlive-scheme-medium, or whatever they actually
need.  Not that that's easy, I know ...

And anyway, don't they really depend only on texlive if someone wants to
*build* the documentation -- as opposed to just read it?  Hopefully
those other programs provide prebuilt pdf/html/whatever.  Seems like
building the doc would be relatively rare.

    On the other hand, user who wants a full
    TeX Live installation could have it via "yum instal
    texlive-scheme-full". Are you ok with it?

Well, I'm certainly not in a position to insist on anything.  Neither
choice stands out as obviously superior to me.

With scheme-basic as the default, I suspect most people who actually
want to use TeX (for anything) will be frustrated, since very little of
what they expect will be installed, while others will happily figure out
the yum invocation above.

Conversely, with scheme-full as the default, some people who just want
to install the other programs will be frustrated at the waste of disk
space and/or bandwidth, while others have plenty of disk and aren't
bothered to have it all.

It seems there is no way to please everyone.  What I can report is that
during those many years when the distros were still based on teTeX, and
teTeX was (essentially) not being updated, there was massive confusion
among TeX users that packages and programs that had been available for
years were not installed on their brand new system.  This isn't quite
the same situation, I know, since at least the material will be up to
date if they figure out how to install it, but it does seem reminiscient ...

Best,
karl

Hi Arthur,

    > <p>We also provide a list of <a href="../doc.html">links to the  
    What a great idea! This file, however does not exist.

It is not just an "idea".  The file does exist (it existed last year,
too, maybe before, I can't remember when I set it up).

The bug is that it wasn't installed.  We'll fix that; thanks for the
report.  Meanwhile, it's available online if you want to see it (and/or
copy it into the root of your tree):
http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/doc.html.  (As well as from svn, etc.)

    However, in TL2008, there is no directory
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/pdftex

texmf-dist/doc/pdftex

    Also present in 2007 and absent in 2008:

At the system level, running find (or equivalent) in the trees could help
discover things.

At the TeX level, the new tlmgr program contains command "search" and
"show" to list information about a package, or search for file names, or
whatever.

(See also end ...)

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/chktex

It's a Windows-only program, so you don't get the doc unless you're
installed on Windows either.

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/latex

texmf-dist/doc/latex/base

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/pdfcrop

texmf-dist/doc/support/pdfcrop

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/texi2html

Indeed, texi2html is no longer part of TL.  It is better installed on
its own, for various reasons.

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/texdoc

That directory is still there, although FYI texdoc was completely
rewritten.

    I particularly miss /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/lists, because it  
    shows what files are where for any package.

The lists files were part of the old installation infrastructure.  Look
at tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb for the replacement.  It is plain text.  And
searching in there is another way to discover what is where.

Best,
Karl

Hi Jindrich,

great work, and it is good to hear that the infrastructure change at
least helped a bit in packaging.

One thing I realized: Don't you have to compile your own binaries before
shipping? Or did I miss something?

Hi Phil,
you can never be sure that the result of a Google search is
reproducible.  When I "google" for something, I get many links to
stuff written in German.  

I suppose that Google tries to find out in which country your ISP
resides and sorts the hits accordingly.  Hence it's impossible to rely
on "the third hit".

I don't know for other distros, but in Debian this is the notion of
"Build-depends" as opposed to "Depends". I assume most binary distros have
similar concepts.

As as user who installed his texlive from Debian for the last few years, I can
say that, as there is no "texlive" (I mean, just "texlive") package in Debian,
you have to chose to either install texlive-full (and be aware of the disk
usage) ot the various  texlive-* (which basically correspond to texlive
collections, with some exceptions for packages maintained separately). I
allways was happy with that (and usually chose texlive-full to avoid problems).

So you can never be frustrated since you made the choice. OTOH, you have to
make the choice.

Manuel.

I think that documentation should be built by developers but there are
also "source RPMs". They might contain documentation as TeX sources.
And e.g. some XML tools may require TeX as a typesetting engine.

I think all redhat users know how to use "yum search" and "yum

It is also questionable whether to use "rpm -I" or "rpm -U". Some
users might need several versions of TL and switch between them by
setting PATH, other user would just like to upgrade.

Yes, there's a lot of truth in that, but in fact
from Google UK one is offered two choices : search
.UK only, or search world.  I chose the latter for
this search, but of course my language preferences
were set such that I saw mainly English-language pages.

maybe all redhat users who install their own systems.  there are an
awful lot of redhat systems in this lab which are installed by sysadmins
and apart from the occasional package request ("enter a package name in
your file in /etc/user-packages" or some such) those systems remain
unchanged until the phd is complete 3 years later.

sure, _i_ might want such complications, and maybe a few others like you
and me.  not everyone's interest in tex is (like mine) to see a good
system develop ... there are real users too.

and real users probably don't want a stripped down tex system installed,
one that requires them to install extra stuff as soon as they get beyond
story.tex

i have empirical evidence (from observing users' interactions with my
colleague sysadmins) that the user-on-the-street is irritated by finding
an installation is inadequate to their requirements.

there's a skill to creating a good "basic" set, but that skill is not
that of identifying the minimum we can fob people off with.

There are some applications that have their own packages for "library"
modules.  The R stats package is a well known example.  Generally only
a few of the packages make it into RPM form, so many are installed from
source: "R CMD INSTALL <package_name>.tar.gz".  Documentation comes
in many formats (html, text, pdf) so it may be that few packages use TeX,
but I recently installed R on a system that did not have a working TeX and
configure in R decided I could not have .dvi and .pdf format docs.  Until
recently, R was certainly expected to install on legacy systems that
used teTeX.

Scheme-basic should provide basic functionality similar to what you
could get with teTeX.   If it doesn't actually do anything useful, it should
be expanded.  I suppose some tests are needed.

I learned long ago that you can too rarely please anybody, but you can
takes steps to limit the numbers you displease.  Scheme-basic
should provide useful functionality and allow relatively simple
documents created years ago to be formatted using current TL.
As a concrete example, scheme-basic should be able to produce
.dvi, .ps, and .pdf from story.tex, while adding latex should be able to
produce .dvi, .ps and .pdf from sample2e.tex.

The issues with teTeX were serious, because it was tricky to install
add-ons, it was hard to figure out which ones you needed, and
disks were expensive.  Many people were very happy with teTeX
because it meant they could have the same basic configuration on
a variety of machines, and distribute a /usr/local/share/texmf with
the missing bits.

Subject: [tex-live] tl 2008 most-likely-final rebuild
Message-ID: <200808220119.m7M1Jwf03301@f7.net>

I did one more rebuild of TL 2008 -- mostly a few doc updates, a couple
minor infrastructure fixes, etc.  There are new powerpc-linux binaries
since the last round of bug fixes hadn't been incorporated yet.  No
other binary changes.
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html

We also did not update all the packages that have come through CTAN the
last few days.  And, Jindrich, just so you know, we did not try to solve
the .ARCH/.win32 issue, that'll have to wait until later.

Since there have been no changes to the sources, I left
texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma as the current source archive, both for
download and in Master/support.  The dates on the other tarballs are now
texlive-20080822.  Hope that doesn't confuse.  It was just convenience
for my update.

Unless something major is reported in the next couple days, this will be
what gets burned onto the DVD's.  (Manfred, please grab this new version
for your image.)

At some point shortly after that, we'll resume normal package updates.

karl

P.S. As I send this, the .iso has not quite finished lzma-ing yet.
Hopefully nothing untoward will happen at that last step.

Subject: [tex-live] metapost and PostScript fonts
Message-ID: <48AE1F21.70500@cs.ucla.edu>

Hi all,

Over several years I've noticed some issues with metapost images that include 
references to modified PostScript fonts.

For example, here's a line from my psfonts.map:

Caled--0 Caledonia "EKAEncoding ReEncodeFont" <[eka.enc <Caled.pfb

"Caled--0" is reencoded by EKAEncoding, which turns "`" and "'" into smart 
quotes.  Now here's a Metapost diagram that uses this font:

prologues := 1;
beginfig(1);
   draw btex \font\a=Caled--0 at 10pt\a `Hello' etex;
endfig;
end

The TeX Live 2007 output, though, looks weird.  Slightly condensed:

%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%Creator: MetaPost 0.993
%%Pages: 1
%%DocumentFonts: Caled--0
%%BeginProlog
  /Caled--0 /Caledonia def
/fshow {exch findfont exch scalefont setfont show}bind def
%%EndProlog
%%Page: 1 1
  0 0 0 setrgbcolor 0 0 moveto (`Hello') Caled--0 9.96265 fshow
showpage
%%EOF

Things to note:

* How did Caled--0 get in the DocumentFonts line?  That's not a valid font.
* mpost has read enough of psfonts.map to map Caled--0 to Caledonia -- but not 
enough to reencode it properly!

Do I misunderstand?  Am I missing some option?

I've attached a Perl script that I'm using to post-process Metapost output, 
fixing these problems.  You run the script like "fixmpost file.1", which 
rewrites "file.1" to include reencodings, font slants and extensions, and so 
forth.  This may be useful for others.

But it would be very nice if Metapost were fixed to do the right thing.

Eddie

Are there differrences if you set
prologues := 2;
or
prologues := 3;
?

Message-ID: <bef0d710808220554m761b0200uf6c744fb10866142@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote a script which produces (amongst other more useful things)
test pages from Dominique's config/ucf files. I'm having trouble with
the Vietnamese encoding though. In the latin-b.ucf file there's a
section:
{
FONTENC T5

U+01A0  \horn O                 # [?]
U+01A1  \horn o                 # [?]
}
But I can't find the t5 package in the current vntex package, and I
cannot find the nodblaccnt option mentioned in any of vntex's files
either. Pdflatex dies with:

! LaTeX Error: Command \horn{O} unavailable in encoding T5.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

Subject: [tex-live] LaTeX takes ages to complete.
Message-ID: <20080822123051.GA30303@bordewijk.ucc.ie>

Dear forum,


I installed TeX Live (2007) a few months ago and it has been working like a
charm. However, since recently LaTeX is requiring a lot of time to complete
as it builds hyphenation trees and does lots of other irrelevant (?) things.
Also it is creating a local directory called ./~/.texlive2008/ in each
directory where I run LaTeX; this never happened before.

This all started after I tried to install MP-Lib. However, I am not sure
if this is the cause: when I asked Taco Hoekwater about it he told me he
couldn't see any reason.

Anyway, when I look at my configuration, which is included below, I see
lots of things which have not been explicitly set by me:
 TEXMF={~/.texlive2008/texmf-config ....
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there's anybody who knows a solution or point me to the information
which is required to solve this then this will be much appreciated.


Thanks in advance.

Regards,


Marc van Dongen

Message-ID: <48AEB1EB.5030703@alice.it>

Since the current texlive-20080822 hasn't Cygwin binaries, I have done
the following to install texlive under Cygwin using the script
'install-tl' (not the .bat file)

The main problem is that 'install-tl' does not find
'tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-cygwin', which needs to decompress.

But Cygwin has its lzma package (and its 'tar' command works also with
'tar --lzma -xf...'!). So I have created the link

    ln -sf /usr/bin/lzma.exe lzmadec.i386-cygwin

In this way, choosing win32 binaries, 'install-tl' works fine to install
texlive in /usr/local etc..

Now a few questions.

Why does the installer not search if the system has its own lzma
package? This would avoid the above procedure.

If I install as Administrator (root), is there some TEXMF* dir which
should be writable by other users (non-admn.)? Mainly, this, perhaps,
regards TEXMFLOCAL.

Besides this, the win32 binaries seem to ignore the TEXMFHOME
($HOME/texmf) directory and use .texlive2008 in the user profile dir.

Any othe suggestions are welcome!

(Obviously the main way is to build texlive under Cygwin!)

Cheers,
    Angelo.

It would seem that somebody (Debian?) has installed a development copy
of TeXlive 2008 on your system with some settings that are only
interpreted properly when using TeXlive 2008.  Brace expansion could
possibly be among those.

Another possibility is that you did not actually install TeXlive 2007,
but rather such a development copy.


Does

echo $HOME

show your home directory?


I certainly hope that your problem can't be reproduced using the current
development system, or that would be a showstopper for the impending
TeXlive release.  However, from what you posted on comp.text.tex
previously, I don't think that you are using TeXlive2008 binaries.

I'm using bash and it seems as if the ~ in the settings aren't properly
expanded to ${HOME}. Having a directory .texlive2008 in your

you use LaTeX in does not.

I am 100% certain that I installed TeXLive 2007. I am not 100% certain

Yes. It does.

TeXLive's standard TEXMF directories may remain read/only for ordinary
users, write access is not required. If you wish to add your local
packages to TEXMFLOCAL, you can change permissions manually after
installation.

Your KPATHSEA variables are a mix of TeXLive 2007 and 2008. Tilde
expansion is not used in 2007's texmf.cnf. Remember that tilde
expansion is the feature of the shell, not of the operating system and
not all programs. Try to find all your incarnations of texmf.cnf, you
may have some other copies in directories under $HOME. Removing them
and running mktexlsr may help, TeX will then find your original
texmf.cnf from distro.

Thanks. I tried that. I found two of them and they were in
directories which were installed by MP Lib. They also had
the ~ patterns. It seems to confirm my suspision that
MP Lib is the ``culprit.''

Anyway, I've installed a new texmf.cnf and everything is grand.

Thanks again!

And since TL2008 supports network install, I don't see a need for
people downloading the iso image.

well, of course.  everyone in the world has at least the footling 10mb/s
(sustained) that i have at home, so they surely wont' want a fogey-ish
iso image.

even so, there will be mirrors of the tl 2008 dvd, and there are already
are pretty much up-to-the-mark mirrors of the online installer (that
everyone will of course want to use, as mentioned above).  all these on
ctan starting from the root systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 (don't be
confused by the directory systems/texlive/install, which is part of tl
2007).  ctan may be browsed using http or ftp, and there are lots of
rsync servers (the home-mirror's friend, imo).

so http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 the system will
find a nearby mirror for you.

sorry, there's no torrent, as yet.  istr someone set one up for tl 2007,
but i've not heard of it, or any development, recently.

The idea of the installer is that you don't have to download
everything. DSL should be enough.

Phil Taylor.  And he has agreed (I wrote him privately earlier) to do
the same for the TL'08 .iso, when it is final.

In general, I agree with the comments here that there should be much
less interest in the iso this year, unless you actually want to burn a
DVD.  Just for installation, with any kind of decent connection, the url
you gave is the way to go:

    some settings that are only interpreted properly when using TeXlive
    2008.  Brace expansion could possibly be among those.

For the record, brace expansion has been around in kpathsea for
15+ years.  

Basic tilde expansion has been around even longer, although I had to fix
some issues and implications this year for the sake of Windows, etc.,
now that we are actually using it in the default texmf.cnf.

Good, that is the right thing to do.

    Why does the installer not search if the system has its own lzma
    package? This would avoid the above procedure.

We can't do that because different versions of lzma are not all
compatible, and there is no simple way to be sure we're getting what we
need.  And also because trying to "search the system" is quite
error-prone in general.

    (Obviously the main way is to build texlive under Cygwin!)

Right.  If you would be able to work with us to do that, please let me
know.  (And one simple part of that will be to include a Cygwin lzmadec
binary in TL ...)

Sorry, that is not clear to me.

Cygwin already has its lzma package [1], so if there is the need to add
it to TL, why not to add the executable, lzma.exe, renamed
lzmadec.i386-cygwin in the tlpkg/installer/lzma directory?

What I am missing?

    Scheme-basic should provide basic functionality similar to what you

No, we have scheme-tetex for that :).

To a first approximation:

scheme-minimal = plain
scheme-basic adds latex
scheme-medium adds recommended packages, "common" languages
scheme-tetex has more of everything, to approximately correspond to tetex
scheme-full is everything we've got.

This gloss is very useful, and should be distributed
with TeX Live ...

Thanks for this, the date stamp will be most useful to me :)

Will there be a tarball of the texmf's as discussed previously?

Thanks

Message-ID: <20080822133356.GA2795@irwin.vpn.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

texdoc now complains, if an older environment variable is used.
This warning is quite annoying, especially, if also the new
variables are used.
  Different texdoc versions require different environment variables,
thus the old variables must be set if several versions are in use.
I think, texdoc should only complain, when an old environment
variable is really used, e.g.:

  PDFVIEWER_texdoc=xpdf %s &
  TEXDOCVIEW_pdf=xpdf %s &

currently generates the warning:

| texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_pdf deprecated. See the
| manual
|         section ?.?, ?.? for details.

But the use of PDFVIEWER_texdoc shows that the user has read the
manual and knows the new name. Therefore it's a bug that a warning
is generated in this case.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek at uni-freiburg.de>

xbase, xtheorem, xparse, xor, xinitials, template and galley should not  
exist anymore. Those to be distributed are now in xpackages, the rest can  
be fetched manually from our SVN for those interested.

the latex3 packages are called xpackages now, which deals with template.

dunno whether xbase is what's not called xpackages or what's now called expl3

Subject: [tex-live] Not so good experience with TL net install on windows.
Message-ID: <48B07BAE.70109@teaser.fr>

Dear all,

    I'm sorry to report a not-so-good experience with TL 2008 net
installer on a ms-windows machine.

    I copied install-tl.zip from ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008, and
started a full install, with default choices.

    It took about 13 hours to complete. Sorry, I can't diagnose exactly
why. Most of the day, the CPU and network activity was low. May it come
from my Interner connectivity provider, or the mirror I used
(ftp.inria.fr/pub/CTAN) ?

    Installation seems quite memory consuming. At the end, I got a
ms-windows popup saying that I had not enough virtual memory, that
windows was resizing the swap file, and that some processes may fail
until the new virtual memory would be available.
   That's the first time I get this message on this machine. It
currently has 1310060 Kbytes of physical RAM, and if I read the task
manager display well, the peek use of virtual memory was 5084404 Kbytes.

    Eventually, post install actions failed (was it due to the virtual
memory problem ?)
    There were errors with fc-cache (FcDirCacheValid(dir) returned
FcFalse), with udpmap (running updmap-sys... updmap.bat: updmap: No
appropriate script found), and at the end, the formats were not 
pregenerated.

    Any hint on why I was unlucky, and how I could do better, next time ?

Thanks,

Bruno.

I had the same VM problem, Bruno, but only
once, and I /think/ there were still some
TeX Live 2007 environment variables set
at that time.  I would strongly recommend
making sure that all traces of TL 2007's
environment are removed before trying to
install TL 2008, and purely from a personal
perspective, I find that mirroring the
entire directory from CTAN using WGET, and
then installing locally, is far faster than
waiting from the installer to pull things
in piecemeal ...

Very probably.  It's downloading over 1gb.

It seems there is some VM consumption in the Windows installer, but no
one has been able to debug it.  On the wild chance that it is related to
Perl/Tk, next time, you might try the command-line installer (install-tl
-no-gui) if you are up to it.

        Eventually, post install actions failed (was it due to the virtual
    memory problem ?)

Maybe.  It seems not all the files were installed, either due to the vm
problem or the download woes.  Not having all the files would cause the
subsequent failures.

As Phil said, you might find it more reliable to mirror the directory
instead of letting tlmgr download it.  Another option is to download the
.iso or the tarballs.  I haven't written up precise instructions for
those options, but the readme file in the tlnet directory gives some
clues.

Sorry for the problems and thanks for the report.

Oh, I didn't think of this situation. How do you happen to run several
versions on the same account by the way?

You're probably true. I just have to think a bit more before I fix it. For
example, what would you expect texdoc to do if an old envvar name is used, and
not the corresponding new name, but the corresponding setting in texdoc.cnf? I
assume you don't want a warning in this case either?

Anyway, we're frozen for now, so I'll fix this in a few days.

Thanks,

Sure. But also people who have internet access can dowload the iso and burn
DVD's for the friends, collegues etc. For example, I'll be teaching LaTeX this
year and will probably burn and distribute to my students a few DVD's.

Anyway, I was planning to get the iso from a nearby CTAN mirror, so I won't
cry if there's no torrent tracker.

As Robin implied, it seems you got an old tlpdb somehow.  Those packages
have not existed for quite a while, so it's correct that the mirror does
not have them.

What's useful information in failed download reports is the actual
mirror that was used; "mirror.ctan.org" multiplexes among all
(supposedly) up-to-date mirrors, so it doesn't tell us anything about
which host might actually have the stale data.  tlmgr should tell you
what individually mirror actually got chosen, I think/hope ...

Exactly.  And even if people didn't read the manual and the old
settings don't work anymore, there is no need to warn them explicitly.
I think that if people are unable to look into the manual at this
point, nobody can help them anyway.

One thing could be improved though: texdoc --help should either
describe the env vars or point people to the manual.

  Reinhard

Unless you have made improvements, that should be good

Win32 users can do <Ctrl+Alt+Del> and select the task manger.   There is a view
that lists the processes with various statistics (it will probably be
necessary to
add columns -- the default has only a few).   This may show some other program
using CPU or memory (for me is is usually the mcafee AV scanner that
hogs resources).

We don't know what AV software was in use.  In the past there have been
problems with memory for McAfee scanning bzip2 files.

I think the installer will let you know if a file fails to match the stored
md5sum.  Did it create a log file?   With McAfee I often get event log
entries of the form: "taking too long to scan, giving up".

I've been using mirrors at home and at work.  For me the big advantage is
that I can update the mirrors during off-peak hours when the internet
works much better for me.   I find that European mirrors often work better
during N. Am. evenings, so you might try N. Am mirrors in your morning.
Also, for me the hop count (e.g., from traceroute) is a useful guide to
mirrors that will be more reliable.

> Sorry for the problems and thanks for the report.

When I first tried to use the installer it was quitting early and often
due to failure to get a file.  I've done a few updates via the network
since I finally got a working install, and they have all gone smoothly
(updating binaries for a bunch of architectures, so lots of files).  I
think the timeout and retry settings have been tweaked, and it
probably helps to choose the mirror site carefully.

    Will there be a tarball of the texmf's as discussed previously?

As discussed previously :) on the tldistro list, I have been making
tarballs for quite some time now (I build them simultaneously with the
iso's, via tlpkg/bin/tl-update-images).  It was one of the first things
I did when we started the release cycle.  See
ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test, namely
- source (Build/source, same file as Master/source/source-*.tar.lzma)
- bin (Master/bin)
- texmf (Master/texmf*)
- extra (everything else)

Hope it suits.

I haven't moved the files to .../historic yet (another part of our
discussion back then), but I will when the release is official (ie, I
hear from Manfred that the DVD master has been cut).

Best,

plodding through the catalogue trying to iron out inconsistencies with

the shortdesc and the longdesc derive from the confusing stuff the

i fear i've not really kept up with story's stuff (it seems far removed
from anything that either i or any of my users is likely to be able to

There is a need. See all the complaints here about things not working any more

Message-ID: <200808232334.m7NNYQr32123@f7.net>

    Cygwin already has its lzma package [1], so if there is the need to add
    it to TL, 

If Cygwin is going to be natively supported in TL, there is a need.

    why not to add the executable, lzma.exe, renamed
    lzmadec.i386-cygwin in the tlpkg/installer/lzma directory?

It could be done that way, but it would be better to compile lzmadec
from the same sources (in TL) that are used for the lzmadec binaries for
all the other arches.  That way, we can be sure they all come from the
same source.  And we don't have to worry about distributing the source
for the Cygwin source separately.

Anyway, there's no sense going further with this unless and until you,
or someone, wants to work to get a native TL build on Cygwin.  lzma(dec)
is a very small part of the overall build.  See
http://tug.org/texlive/build.html for details if you want to pursue it.

Sorry, I don't want to rebuild the DVD image just for this.  Of course
we can/will fix it post-release.

I know there have been (and probably still are) other cases where
unrelated files are amalgamated into a single TL package due to an
unfortunate coincidence of directory names.  That all dates back to tpm
days, and it's hard to find the errors systematically.  At least they
aren't that hard to correct (unlike the duplicated filename/different
file problems).

Sure, downloading one ISO is one way to do it, and surely better than
downloading from some mirror.ctan.org multiple times.  

As Phil has written, mirroring the CTAN dir yourself to a local disk is
another way to go.

There is yet another way, and that is to use the -profile option to
install-tl.  It's documented via install-tl --help, or see
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html (a copy of that help).

Hope it all works out one way or another.

Hi,

Sorry if this is already not the case (I last updated in August 2),  
but (La)TeX can't find pst-solides3d.tex (the actual code) because it  
was put in the doc section:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pst-solide3d/pst- 
solides3d.tex

LaTeX finds pst-solides3d.sty, which is in

.../texmf-dist/tex/latex/pst-solide3d/pst-solides3d.sty,

but this just inputs pst-solides3d.tex.


Best,

Axel

"tlmgr" doesn't show me any information about the real server. If I put
the URL

  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

in my web browser I see

  http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

A next try with this server has the same problematic result

tlmgr --location \

Doesn't work the mirroring? Should I avoid "mirror.ctan.org" in the future?

the server itself has an up-to-date texlive.tlpdb (in the sense that
it's identical to that on cam.ctan.org, which is the primary ctan mirror
for tex live -- all other ctan copies come through my machine).

so for some reason, your copy of tlmgr is refusing to update that file
(which doesn't specify all the packages you're having trouble with ...
and does, of course, specify other packages which have been created
since your old version of the file was downloaded).

can you locate your copy of texlive.tlpdb (or its lzma, preferably both
actually) and post directory details of it, to confirm the current
favoured diagnosis of your problems, please?

Thanks for your help.

  I've just tried the same full installation, on the very same same
machine, running mandriva 2008.1 (as a standard user), It just needed a
few hours less (11h instead of 13, I don't think the difference is
significant), and completed OK.

 So, the time is due to my configuration.
 Regarding the virtual memory problem, I'm going to switch to windows,
and have another try without "old" ?TL2007 environnement variables (As
Phil suggested).

  Anyway, when the time will come to do real installations, I think I'll
stick to DVD images, or a local mirror (wget and/or rsync).

  Thanks for all your work,

This is not a gmail problem: depending on the configuration of the mailing
list, the mailing list manager adds (or not) a Reply-to header. For the

If the main goal is just to get TL2008 on windows, you can add Win32
to the linux installation and then copy the whole tree over to the
windows partition.   You will have to adjust the PATH on Windows.
I've done that -- after an update I got a couple desktop icons, one
for finishing the updates and another one I never use.

Yes, In my opinion, the network installer is really best suited to sites
with a local mirror of the TL archives.   MiKTeX, debian, and Fedora
have had a lot more time to work on their package managers and I
still have problems getting stuck on a very slow mirror or with aborted
transfers.  Fedora will keep trying other mirrors until it finds one that
works or runs out of sites to try.  MiKTeX only tries one site, and makes
you start over if that one isn't working.   Clearly it is not easy to make
a robust network installer.

And if you can access your Linux partition from windows (there's some good
ext2 drivers for XP at least) you don't even have to make a copy, by the way.

Me again,

    I'm happy to report that the new attempt (with TL2007 env. vars 
removed) worked: no virtual memory problems, all the formats are built.
     As a bonus, it was  much faster : the automated choice of mirror 
was better, this time (distrib-coffee.ipsl  instead of inria).

   So, Phil's  hint seems to have done the trick.

   I know it's way too late to ask to modify the installer, so that it 
warns the user if "old" envir vars are set, but I might suggest to make 
this warning really visible, on internet's doc: I must not be the only 
one who will updgrade from 2007 to 2008.

Thanks to all,

Bruno.

Indeed, I remember these times. teTeX was usable TeX distribution but
a composition of styles/packages and language supports in it was a big
mistery for me and many people didn't understand why a particular
style or language support is in or is missing. Thomas definitely had a
system in it while putting teTeX together but since TeX Live has now
usability-focused and very well designed packaging system I hope the
problems are more or less history thanks to you.

I hope most of the TeX users will figure out how to install a missing
part even though scheme-basic would be the default. They can use yum
to search what is missing and I will make the Fedora users aware of
that in an announcement after 2008 is packaged and released.

Thanks,
Jindrich

The metadata format and the whole design of the packaging system is
nearly perfect. It is really a huge step to give users possibility to sensibly
maintain their TeX installation. The downstream packaging without it would be
nearly impossible and chaotic. Thanks for putting a bit of sense into
it!

Maybe some work could be done on the per-architecture
post-installation, the "exec" part in the package system metadata in
order to not to hardwire it into the installer itself, but it is not
critical.

Nope, you didn't miss anything. The demonstration of TeX Live
packaging into RPM just illustrates that even the precompiled binaries
shipped with TeX Live 2008 is possible to package based solely on the
package system metadata. In the real-life Fedora packaging only the
information about what binary belongs to what package will be taken
out from this script and all binaries will be built from sources.

Jindrich

most commonly because thomas either hadn't noticed the package when it
appeared, or hadn't appreciated its value.  however, he was receptive to
suggestions that things be added -- for example he hadn't originally
thought of including the (then new) memoir class, but accepted my
suggestion that he did.

remember that tetex predated tex live (sebastian's original proposal was
that tex live would be an implementation of tetex; the project grew, it
seemed to me).

i wonder how many users will actually be in a situation to use on-line
updates.  most at my lab won't...

Sure, I wasn't proposing this as a solution for every single windows install,
just for this particular case (double-boot machine) if you want to save disk
space and upgrade time.

Of course we take seriously your problems with the net installer on windows,
but none of the developers was able to reproduce it even once, and we lack
information to understand and fix it right now.

Several TeX installations (including TL2007, TL2008, ...),

If a warning should be given at all, then only, if the finally used
value comes from a deprecated environment variable. Thus in the described
scenario there would be a warning. But you are right, this warning
would be dubious, too.

For simplicity I would just drop the warning, either an environment
variable is supported, or it isn't. If something isn't working anymore,
because the support for an environment variable is dropped, then the
user would probably look into the documentation anyway.

Yours sincerely

The needs of people who want to format the current research paper/report
and have no plans to format the document again once it is finished are not the
same as those producing source code and associated documents that may
need to be modified and formatted many times in the years or even decades
to come.

Many of the people I encounter (labs scattered around the world) have been
in the habit of just copying missing bits into the directory with the document,
which is fine as a short-term workaround, but can cause problems when they
start next year's report by copying last years directory and globally changing
<year> to <year+1>!

The R stats package is guilty of this -- the 2.7.1 source has epsf.tex
from dvips (same as texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/generic/epsf/epsf.tex)
and pdfcolor.tex (same as texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/plain/misc/pdfcolor.tex),
both in the doc/manual directory.  The docs use LaTeX and texinfo.
I assume this was done because the files weren't present or were
old versions in some platforms where R is built.   R provides a bunch
of packages  in source form, including the .tex and .texi source, but with
pre-built .pdf's.  On my system those pdf's were built with:

Creator:        LaTeX with hyperref package
Producer:       pdfTeX-1.10b
CreationDate:   Thu Oct 30 20:11:00 2003

Creator:        TeX
Producer:       pdfeTeX-1.21a
CreationDate:   Thu Jun  1 13:55:54 2006

I think many other open source projects have similar approaches
to documentation.  Certainly there are many copies of texinfo.tex
under my /usr/src/redhat/BUILD (bur the R-2.7.1 part, although
many of the docs do use texinfo).

I liked table.tex, so now I like tap.tex even more (because most
of our documents have color images, we get color in tables and
headings at no extra cost).   If a user already has the table (from
some paper) they may end up using table.tex or tap.tex for
documentation that goes into a the software package.  Later,
someone is faced with having to either include the macros of
rewrite the table to use something more widely available.

Can't speak for the OP, but I routinely have several TeX Live versions
going and use environment modules <http://modules.sourceforge.net/>.
This is used to set the PATH and whatever other variables are needed.
It isn't much use for people who rely on GUI exclusively, and I do
have to restart emacs if I want to use auctex with a different PATH.
The problem of TL2008 seeing variables appropriate to TL2007
should not arise.

If you don't mind I'd be interested in our favourite way of switching from one
version to another. I'm currently using symlinks and a special component in my
$PATH variable to do so, and if you have a better solution...

Sure. If we want to issue a warning only when really relevant, this will sort
of bloat the code quite a lot for few benefice. I'll probably just drop this
warning as you suggest. The original idea was that at some point in the future
there should be only two environement variables per setting (and not 4 like
now), but well, many environment variables don't hurt that much anyway.

Thanks,
Manuel.

A symlink can have only one value at a time, whereas different
parallel sessions can have different values for environment
variables, which can be handy if you need to hop back and forth
between e.g. a testing environment and a production environment.

I used to rely exclusively on environment variables, with scripts to
switch between sets of values. But if you want to offer users
something that `just works'(TM) then configuration with environment
variables is not so hot.

The environment modules system has been around for ages.  It used
to come with SGI IRIX64, but since it was invented at Sun, it might
be available for Sun as well.  The sourceforge site has background
documents.  Someone has to write some module files (which are Tcl scripts),
but users just need to know a few commands:

module help
module avail
module list
module rm ..
module swap ...
module load ..

Here is a sample:

#%Module1.0#####################################################################
##
## TeX Live modulefile
##
proc ModulesHelp { } {
        global version modroot
        global arch modroot

        puts stderr "\tTeX/TL$version - loads the TeX Live software"
        puts stderr "\t & application environment."
        puts stderr "\n\tThis sets environment variables."
        puts stderr "\n\tVersion: $version"
        puts stderr "\tArchitecture: $arch \n"
}

conflict TeX

    I know it's way too late to ask to modify the installer, so that it 
    warns the user if "old" envir vars are set, 

I don't think there is any practical way to distinguish "old" envvar
values from "new" ones.  We certainly cannot warn simply if any
TeX-related envvar is set at all.

    but I might suggest to make this warning really visible, on
    internet's doc:

It's already mentioned in some places.  It's a good idea to add it
everywhere we can think of -- can't hurt.

    I hope most of the TeX users will figure out how to install a missing
    part even though scheme-basic would be the default. 

FWIW, from talking to mathematicians at conferences, etc., my experience
is that most TeX *users*, as opposed to developers, just install the
system and that's the end of it (as Robin has reported at his site,
too).  They don't want to mess around with TeX.  They want to write
their papers.

Of course I realize that such TeX users are a tiny fraction of Fedora
users.  So I don't know how to solve it.  Can the Fedora installer have
texlive-scheme-full for some and texlive-scheme-basic for others?

Also, I continue to think that texlive-scheme-basic is too basic.  Even
just for processing documentation.  If the documentation uses *any*
non-core LaTeX styles, scheme-basic will not be enough.  How about
scheme-medium or scheme-tetex?

But we can warn them to check, in the documentation.
As I hit this very error myself, I was confident that
there is no mention in the TUG/TeX Live/Downloads and other means/
Small bootstrap installer sequence, but now I come to
check I find that the last leads to a 550 :-(((

Where has

Majority of my esteemed colleagues never update things and happily
continue with tetex 3.0. Actually when our Dept TeX was updated to
thetex 3.0 some were screaming "Bloody murder" because (if I remember
correctly) fiverm became undefined. So, there is no problem: they
neither installed TL 2007, nor will install TL2008, 2009, ....

However, they are really upset when paper they receive from other
colleagues cannot be processed because some packages/documentclasses
cannot be found or are too old. Therefore even if particular user does
not go beyond latex209 he/she may sometimes need a bleeding edge and
complete distribution. In this sense "basic" distribution can work for
advanced users who can add things later but it will fail badly for
majority of users who will just complain . Since hard disk space is
not a problem I don't think that basic installation is a good idea.

Good to hear.  However, xdvi is still missing.  You can download
the Cygwin binary from:

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/support/xdvi4cygwin.tar.bz2

The files are supposed to be extracted in the Cygwin bin directory.
The binary is compiled on Cygwin and is linked against various
cygwin*.dll's.  It also requires an X server.  It will not work on
native Windows.  This is the reason it's not shipped with all the
other win32 binaries.

Anwered by Karl already.

TEXMFLOCAL is supposed to be maintained by the administrator.  It
should not be writable by users.  Even if you trust all users, people
can damage things accidentally.

Coud you run

  getnonfreefonts --help

and tell me where it wants to *install* the fonts?

I get

[...]
  Directories:
       temporary: '/tmp/501-reinhard/getfont-<PID>'
       install:   '/home/reinhard/texmf'

 > (Obviously the main way is to build texlive under Cygwin!)

I tried it already.  AFAIR the Cygwin environment had a copyright note
from 2007, hence it's quite up-to-date.  I succeeded to compile TeX
Live with the configure options --without-xetex --without-dvipdfmx.

Most likely the reason that building xetex and dvipdfmx failed is
that some libraries had been missing or had been too old.

If you are able (or anybody else) to compile TeX Live under Cygwin,
let us know.  It would be nice to have binaries linked against
cygwin*.dll because many things (signals, for instance) don't work
properly, if at all, when linked against Microsoft's runtime lib.

Cygwin is currently not supported by TeX Live.  However, if you steal
win32 binaries, then please also run

   bin/win32/symlinks4cygwin.sh 

which creates symlinks to the scripts.

Regards,
  Reinhard

OK, that does confirm my hypothesis

installation : the relevant bits
read

Can I urge that a warning be added to this file, before the last

variables be deleted ?

    When I first tried to use the installer it was quitting early and often
    due to failure to get a file.

In our original version, we would resolve mirror.ctan.org for *every*
file -- thus, pkg x would come from one mirror and pkg y would come from
another.

The single most important change to make it even semi-reliable was to
discern the host which mirror.ctan.org chose and then specifically use
that host for the rest of the downloads.  (Yay for Norbert, as ever.)

We did tweak other settings and make other changes, but they were minor
by comparison.

May I suggest a re-phrase ?  The VM problem is caused
(almost certainly) by not removing the old environment
variables /before/ installing, so I would suggest :

   Before trying to install TeX Live 2008, it is important
   to check your environment variables : any that reference
   other TeX installations (TeX Live or otherwise) can cause
   problems both during and after installation, so all such
   variables should be deleted.

Another point : these two paras should appear

Hmm.  t5enc.def defines \horn.  Perhaps adding a simple

 From bin/win32:

Using 20080816 source (tar.lzma) these are a few results.

A) ./Build
It fails in this way:

etc.. The bin dir has 290 binaries...

How can I install the above ? Is there a way to modify the iso so that I 
can use the (linux-like) script install-tl?

And, why in the build log I find 'with-old-mac-fonts'?

For the sake of completeness, in Work/libs I find a lot of rebuild libs 
(ncurses, png, fretype,...) which Cygwin has as its own packages and 
which I installed...

This is all!

Cheers,
    Angelo.

Don't get ahead of yourself -- the first question is whether the binaries
actually work.

You should be able to use rsync to update the install you did with the
Win32 binaries, and you will need to create links as already
mentioned.  On linux I get an i686-pc-gnu-linux directory
in parallel with the i386-linux, etc. directories.   You can use the
new binaries for testing.  Once any problems are sorted out it should
not be a big issue to add cygwin binary packages for a future release.

If the Cygwin versions are current, try "--with-system..." options for
configure.
In the past, I have had cases where the system libraries included bug fixes
for a particular (obscure) platform, so "--with-system-..." may be needed to
get things working on Cygwin.

Xetex may be more difficult simply because it uses more 3rd party libraries
(fontconfig, etc.) that may not have suitable ports to Cygwin.

May you give an example of using rsync?

I have done a tar ball of the content of inst/ dir and thought to unpack
it overwriting the Win32 installation... But rsync is better. How?

./Build --without-xetex --with-system-{pnglib,gd,t1lib,ncurses}

builds fine; --with-system-{fretype,fretype2} are ignored;
--with-system-zlib fails: undef. symbol in building zzip lib.

How could I know (in a simple way) the version of the libraries
{pnglib,gd,t1lib,ncurses} shiped with TL?

Cygwin has fontconfig and I have almost all Cygwin installed (a part
'suduko console', Apache and similar), and updated!

For the sake of completeness, in the build log I see some

    config.status: WARNING: ../../../utils/dialog/Makefile.in seems to
    ignore the --datarootdir setting

I used "rsync" for the first time today,
starting with the URL to be found in

	ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/README

(i.e., rsync://tug.org/texlive-Images/test/texlivetest2008.iso.lzma)

The final period in the web page version of the above is
an error, and the file seems not to exist, but at least
I now knew the syntax.

I then fetched RSYNC as a part of the DeltaCopy package :

	http://www.aboutmyip.com/files/DeltaCopy.zip

found the GUI too complex, and experimented with the
command-line version until I found a syntax that would work,
using my guess at the RSYNC address of the Cambridge CTAN
node, modified to fetch the entire TeX Live network installation
suite :

	rsync rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

Finally I discovered that in order to actually fetch the files,
rather than just list them, one has to append a destination path :

	rsync rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/ .

(Note final space and period).

This has the effect of mirroring (once) the Cambridge TeX Live
Network installer suite to the current directory and sub-directories
thereof.

Hope that helps :

As Angelo said, fontconfig is already supported (version 2.4.1). I
hope it's not too old.

Last night I downloaded Cygwin in order to burn it on a DVD and update
my system at work.  There are two trees, "release" and "release-2".
The latter one is not mentioned in the documentation at all but I
suppose that it's something what Debian people call "testing" or
"unstable".  Can anyone confirm?

Coming back to your statement:

 > it uses more 3rd party libraries [...] that may not have suitable
 > ports to Cygwin.

Let's avoid guessing.  I just derived two files from the Cygwin stuff
I downloaded last night:

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/cygwin/release_content.txt
   http://tug.org/~kotucha/cygwin/release-2_content.txt

These files list all the packages and their version numbers.
Jonathan, can you confirm that Cygwin provides all the libs needed by
XeTeX?

  Reinhard

But as I said before, I missed the previous name change anyway. The problem is
not people not being smart enough, it's just that they sometimes miss things

At the end of which you can read:

The command `texdoc texdoc' gives you the full user guide in pdf.

which is what I call pointing to the manual. But it doesn't prevent people

In all my tests, they are working fine. I only need to set the PATH.

I have rebuilt several documents, generating PDF, DVI, PS output. In all
cases the resulting files have about the same size and quality of those
created by current MiKTeX.

I do not think I need!

In my build, bin/i686-pc-cygwin contains a lot of symlinks (about 100?),
many of which to ../../texmf/scripts:

epspdf -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/epspdf/epspdf
epstopdf -> ../../texmf/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl
htlatex -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/tex4ht/htlatex.sh
...

Confirmed! 2.4.1 is the current version in Cygwin.

You should not use the release-2 area: it is only for Cygwin maintainers
and contains the next 1.7 version of Cygwin. (Perhaps it will be
released before the end of 2008 ant it is very unstable.)

Perhaps there was a misunderstanding.

The suggestions of George was to rsync my _local_ Win32 installation
with my _local_ Cygwin build.

In any case,

Thanks a lot.

    How can I install the above ? 

http://tug.org/texlive/build.html#deploy

    Is there a way to modify the iso so that I 
    can use the (linux-like) script install-tl?

After copying the binaries per above, install-tl should basically work.
The only question in my mind is whether the new directory (say,
i386-cygwin) will show up in the architecture list.  (I'm sure it won't
be selected by default.)

    For the sake of completeness, in Work/libs I find a lot of rebuild libs 
    (ncurses, png, fretype,...) which Cygwin has as its own packages and 
    which I installed...

If the goal is provide binaries for the TeX Live distribution (as
opposed to making them for yourself or for a Cygwin distribution), it is
highly desirable to compile with TeX Live's version of the libraries.

    The VM problem is caused (almost certainly) by not removing the old
    environment variables /before/ installing

Really?  I did not gather that, but I guess I must have failed to
comprehend all the mail.  I was under the impression that the old envvar
settings messed up the post-install running of TeX to process documents,
not installation.

This would imply the VM problem should be reproducible: make the old
envvar setting (whatever it is?) and try the install.  If the VM failure
happens in that case, and then does not happen when the old envvar
setting is removed, that would certainly be a clue :).

Can you or other Windows folk do that?

I am somewhat puzzled as to how old envvars could cause excessive VM
consumption.

    Another point : these two paras should appear

I wrote them in the order I did because of the above.  I certainly agree
the order should be changed if the envvars affect installation.

There were a couple of minor nits in the installation, however.

(1) I specified an alternate installation tree of

	/usr/local/share/texlive/2008/

The installer then reported

	<1> TEXDIR:       /usr/local/share/texlive/2008
	    support tree: /usr/local/share/texlive/2008/texmf

	<2> TEXMFLOCAL:     /usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-local
	<3> TEXMFSYSVAR:    /usr/local/share/texlive/2008/texmf-var
	<4> TEXMFSYSCONFIG: /usr/local/share/texlive/2008/texmf-config

	<5> TEXMFHOME:      ~/texmf

Notice that item <2> lies outside the specified tree, which, I think,
should NOT happen.  The entire installation should always go UNDER the
user-specified root.  I overrode item <2> to set it to

	/usr/local/share/texlive/2008/texmf-local

(2) The installer later asked

	Other actions:
	 <R> return to main menu
	 <Q> quit

I typed

	R

to which it responded

	Unknown command: R

However, it did return me to the main menu.  Further experimentation
showed that it was expecting "r", not "R", despite the prompts.

This is certainly confusing.  Also, I think a <RETurn> should be
enough to get back to the main menu (perhaps that is how my "R"
followed by a return key was interpreted).

I successfully typeset and displayed (with xdvi) some simple plain
TeX, LaTeX 2.09, and LaTeX 2e test documents on each of several binary
architectures.

After the installation, I compared the sizes of the 2007 and 2008
trees:

	2007:	1.8GB	5215 directories	61522 files
	2008:	2.7GB	6195 directories	73785 files

Evidently, it has been a busy and productive year for the TeX Live
team.  Congratulations!

i've got a bunch of this stuff in my (rsync.tex.ac.uk) logs:

(the "unknown" address is supplied by eclipse networking, but that

if so, they're welcome to contact me about what they _should_ be doing.

(the file system is case-sensitive, so that curiously mixed-case path

My solution was to drop the pdftex binary I've compiled in
/usr/local/bin. Unfortunately from there it thought that it "belonged"
to Fedora's RPM-installed TeXLive 2007 instead of my separate 2008
installation. This is due the kpathsea's compile-time defaults for CNF
locations (paths.h), which eventually finds TL 2007's texmf.cnf in
/usr/share/texmf/web2c. But at least I know that my patched pdftex
works with TL2007.

I'm unable to make it work with 2008 however. Han, what TeXLive are
you using? In 2008 there's no texmf-main anymore, and texmf-config is
empty... If I just do:

export TEXMFCNF=/fc5/tl/2008/texmf/web2c

then pdftex barely works, it cannot even find its pdftex.map file:

pdfTeX warning: pdftex (file pdftex.map): cannot open font map file

Anything beyond CM fonts, even LaTeX's minimal.cls cannot be found.

TL 2008 user guide suggests in section 3.4.5 to set
TEXMFCNF=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/web2c

But there's no texmf.cnf in texmf-var/web2c, only a fmtutil.cnf

There's no web2c under texmf-dist. The texmf.cnf from 2008/texmf/web2c
does get loaded, it just doesn't work properly, probably due the
$SELFAUTOPARENT business. The one that Fedora provides has hardcoded
paths.

It is I, the //TeX.Ac.Uk/ was appended by the
default GUI behaviour of DeltaCopy (because I
told it to retrieve to F:/TeX/TeX.Ac.Uk/), and
I subsequently managed to remove the offending
suffix ...

yes, you need to change SELFAUTOPARENT to the actual path to
texlive installation dir, too. What I gave in my previous
was rather an example on how you can set TEXMFCNF to an
explicit location.

But this discussion belongs to texlive list, does it?

    /usr/local/bin

Please don't expect a random TeX binary to work with a random TeX tree.

If you want to use TL'08, install TL'08.  If you have TL'08 installed
/some/where, then put your new pdftex into its tree:
/some/where/bin/i386-linux/pdftex (move the original aside, of course).

Your original message was about .fmt file mismatches.  Delete your .fmt
files created with previous versions of TL'08 and let them be recreated.
We had to make changes that changed the .fmt's during the last round of
bug fixes.

Hope this helps.

It works if you use this script: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gaburici/setup-tl
No need to move anything aside. Feel free to include the script it in TL :)

Hi Manuel,
I obviously called the old shell script instead of the texlua script.

Good that you confirmed that there is such a message, otherwise I
probably had not noticed that there is a pproblem at all.  But I
solved it now.

Look at this:

$ which texdoc
/home/reinhard/dev/texlive/svn/trunk/Master/bin/x86_64-linux/texdoc
$ ls -l bin/x86_64-linux/texdoc
lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users 38 Aug 21 23:16 bin/x86_64-linux/texdoc -> ../../texmf/scripts/texlive/texdoc.tlu
$ texdoc --help
Usage: texdoc [OPTION]... [NAME]...
  Search for NAME in the TeX documentation and start a viewer.

  --help        show this help
  -v            verbose mode: show viewer command
  -l            just list all matching files. Do not start a viewer.
  -s            search the disk. remaining arguments will be passed
                as egrep patterns to filter the find output.
$

Quite confusing, or not?  Everything looks fine.  $PATH is set up
properly, as reported by 'which', and the symlink to the texlua file
is correct, too.  When I specified path/to/texdoc I got the texlua
version.  Can you explain what went wrong before reading the rest of
this message?  It's an interesting exercise, at least.

End of last week I ran 'svn up' and got an error message asking me to
run 'svn cleanup'.  But this didn't help.  Hence I renamed the old
working copy and checked out again.  I have some scripts which allow
me to switch between different versions of TeX Live.  They simply
start a new instance of Bash in a modified environment.

A full checkout takes some time and I obviously launched such a script
and invoked texdoc *after* I renamed the broken svn tree and *before*
texdoc had been checked out.  Then Bash found /usr/bin/texdoc, the
shell script provided by Gentoo.

Apparently I forgot that Bash remembers /paths/to/programs.  However,

$ hash      
hits    command
[...some lines ommitted...]
  13    /usr/bin/texdoc
$ hash -r
$ texdoc --help
[...output ommitted...]
$ hash
hits    command
   1    /home/reinhard/dev/texlive/svn/trunk/Master/bin/x86_64-linux/texdoc

solved the problem.  Sigh!  Invoking a new shell would have solved
this problem too, but the nasty part was to find out what actually
happened.

Well, I'm unable to read things which don't appear on screen.  Now
everything works as expected and I can't resist to say that the usage
message provided by texdoc.tlu is excellent.

Sorry for the noise and thank you very much for your work.

Regards,
  Reinhard

And yes, even with my script, you obviously still need to delete any
non-matching fmt files.

BTW, why isn't there an option to automatically update fmt files to
match binaries? The fmt files are supposed to act like caches. I fail
to see a significant benefit in the "stymied" message.
How would it sound if the XP prefetch (.pf) files would complain that
exe has changed and that you need to delete them manually? Or if OS X
10.5 did that with it's prebinding files and asked you to run
update_prebinding manually? Or if Linux prelinked ELFs would blow up
if any of the .so libraries they've prelinked changes? The fmt files
serve a very similar the same purpose...

No, it does not show up nor is selected by defaul.

It seems that, for the moment, we can't install the cygwin binaries
using 'install-tl'.

I have a few questions.

My build creates an 'inst' directory with this structure:

$ ls -lrt inst/
totale 1068
drwxr-xr-x+  3 ...   0 Aug 25 13:08 bin
drwxr-xr-x+  3 ...   0 Aug 25 13:08 lib
drwxr-xr-x+  2 ...   0 Aug 25 13:08 texinfo
drwxr-xr-x+  4 ...   0 Aug 25 13:08 share
drwxr-xr-x+  3 ...   0 Aug 25 13:09 include
drwxr-xr-x+  2 ...   0 Aug 25 13:10 lcdf-typetools
drwxr-xr-x+  3 ...   0 Aug 25 13:10 texmf-dist
drwxr-xr-x+ 11 ...   0 Aug 25 13:11 texmf

1)
I note that 'lib', 'texinfo' and 'include' do not show up in the ISO;
so, can one avoid to install them?

2)
'share' has 'man' and 'info'. Should one copy them to
'/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc', overwriting the 'man' and 'info'
which are there?

3)
'texmf' has the extra directory 'bibtex' which, in the ISO, is instead
in 'texmf-dist'. Same question as in 2).

4) For the sake of completeness...
In the postinstall phase, 'install-tl' does not use the binaries just
installed but those which are in the PATH; so, if one has another TeX
system installed (teTeX) then it is used!. From install-tl.log:

...

Thanks for warning me.  If the files in the "release" directory are the
latest stuff, I probably have instaled them already.

Hi Nelson,

    Notice that item <2> lies outside the specified tree, which, I think,
    should NOT happen.

I understand your point of view, but it is an intentional choice we made
for the default behavior, because the main purpose of texmf-local is to
persist *between* releases.

	Unknown command: R

Thanks for mentioning it.  We'll fix that bug.

    Also, I think a <RETurn> should be enough to get back to the main menu 

Here we disagree.  I think RET by itself is too easy to type by mistake
and should generally just be a no-op in our little menu system.

    (perhaps that is how my "R" followed by a return key was interpreted).

I believe the R was recognized as the return-to-main-menu command, and
the error message is simply spurious.

	2007:	1.8GB	5215 directories	61522 files

Wow.  TL simply reflects the activity of the TeX community at large!

Thanks Nelson.

Strange, Debian/sid running here which can be considered rather new

search on google shows that Fedora also ships libstdc++.so.5 in the
compat-libstdc++ package.

though, admittedly, libstdc++.so.5 is rather old.

You need to install a compatibility library.  On Fedora 8 I have:

$ sudo rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5
Password:
compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-62.i386

The major distros have to support legacy apps and so must provide
appropriate libraries -- the trick is knowing what they are called so you
can install them.

Yes, you can use a compat libary, the question is *why* is it linked
against libstdc++.so.5? AFAICT lcdf-typetools itself has no such
requirement.

I'm using my own build of lcdf-typetools-2.71-3.fc9 because I needed
the latest bug fixes. I was just trying to point out a seemingly
unnecessary dependency on an old library; gcc 4.0 was released 3 years
ago...

A simple approach for testing is to create parallel
".../texlive/YYYY/bin/<arch>-t" directories and put one before the
".../texlive/YYYY/bin/<arch>"directory in the path on the test
system(s). Thay way SELFAUTOPARENT is the same as for the
standard binaries.

I probably won't be able to look at this until next week at the  
earliest - I'm away from home with hardly any internet connectivity  
right now.

Offhand, I'd guess that Cygwin has most of the necessary libs, though  
getting the configure options right to use them might be tricky.  
However, for ICU (at least) it will still be necessary to use the  
version from TL, as this is a customized version. And the original  
message showed compile-time failures in the Graphite library, which I  
wouldn't expect to find installed in Cygwin; we always build that  
locally. I don't know whether that is a problem with the Cygwin  
compiler, or (more likely) a portability issue in the Graphite source.

The configure option --with-old-mac-fonts noted in the build log  
should be harmless; AFAIK, this only affects the freetype2 build on  
Mac OS, and is ignored on other platforms.

    the question is *why* is it linked against libstdc++.so.5? 

Because we did not have a chance to fix the autotools stuff to use
cxx-runtime-hack for lcdf-typetools.  Hopefully for next time we will.

    No, it does not show up nor is selected by defaul.

In tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm there is a function platform which maps
config.guess output to TL platform names.  Depending on what
config.guess outputs on Cygwin, you may need to tweak it.

Here are my notes (from tlpkg/doc/packages.txt):

 To add a new architecture:
 - check that the config.guess output maps to our architecture name
   (the `platform' routine in TeXLive/TLUtils.pm)
 - create directory in Master/bin and add at least one file
 - add lzma and lzmadec binaries in Master/tlpkg/installer
 - add description in Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm
 - regenerate tlpdb.

I'll answer the other questions separately.

    BTW, why isn't there an option to automatically update fmt files to
    match binaries?  The fmt files are supposed to act like caches. I
    fail to see a significant benefit in the "stymied" message.

I suppose.

By the time the stymied message appears, I think it would be very hard
to restart the program.  Given all the things that we do with argv[0], I
would be surprised if it is as simple as self-execing after removing the
.fmt, or re-invoking main().

Also, doing a "normal" regeneration could easily create the .fmt in a
different place.  Or the present user might not have permission to
create it in the place where the bad .fmt is.  So there are a lot of
details to think about.  It would definitely need to be an option.

Anyway, if you or anyone want to experiment with it, more power to you.
Heck, maybe I'm wrong and it's all easy as pie.  Patches welcome :).

Historically, none of the dynamic creation stuff was anticipated in
Knuth's original program, least of all the .fmt's.  I expect it cuts no
ice with you, but personally I find it fairly amazing that it works as
well as it does.

    1) I note that 'lib', 'texinfo' and 'include' do not show up in the ISO;
    so, can one avoid to install them?

configure --without-texinfo for texinfo.  For the others: no, I don't
think they can be reasonably avoided.  Just ignore them.

    2) 'share' has 'man' and 'info'. Should one copy them to
    '/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc', overwriting the 'man' and 'info'
    which are there?

There is no need.  texmf/doc should already contain everything that make
install installs, and more.

    'texmf' has the extra directory 'bibtex' which, in the ISO, is instead
    in 'texmf-dist'. Same question as in 2).

Same answer.

    In the postinstall phase, 'install-tl' does not use the binaries just
    installed but those which are in the PATH; 

We do take steps to use the new binaries, otherwise installation would
completely fail.  Apparently what we do does not suffice on Cygwin.  It
is this (install-tl line 982 at present):

  $ENV{'PATH'}="$plat_bindir" . "$pathsep" . "$ENV{'PATH'}";

You're going to have to tell us what needs to be done on Cygwin.

If you run install-tl --debug, you will get voluminous output about what
is being done.  Perhaps that will help you find your way through the code.

This is not clear: "no, I don't think they can be reasonably avoided"
seems the contrary of "Just ignore them".

So, should I copy also 'lib' and 'include'? YES/NO?

I think here the problems is the following.

When building (./Build --without-xetex), configure says that the system
is 'i686-pc-cygwin', and this is the right answer. Many files in Cygwin
distribution live under 'somedir/i686-pc-cygwin' and also my builds of
GCC, Emacs etc. confirm that.

Instead 'install-tl' says that the system is i386-cygwin (and, if you
remember, I need the link 'lzmadec.i386-cygwin -> /usr/bin/lzma.exe').

I have tried to figure out the cause but hadn't success, so you need a
more expert people.

The trick could be to rename 'i686-pc-cygwin' into 'i386-cygwin'
but a more elegant solution is welcomed!

I think the OP would have preferred that a current version of lcdf-typetools
be linked (dynamically) against a current libstdc++, so was not
looking for "cxx-runtime-hack".  Maybe the best strategy for the OP is
to file a bug with
the distro (Fedora 9) against lcdf-typetools so that when TeX Live is
packaged it uses the version he needs.

Perhaps something went wrong yhe first time I sent this mail.

So I re-post.

As I wrote in this thread,

./Build --without-xetex

works fine. So I have re-thought the procedure to install and using
'install-tl' I have choosen to deselect XeTeX: <C> RET <F> RET.

Now building the document fails because it does not find 'ifxetex.sty'.

Bu if I do not want XeTeX?

It won't prevent LaTeX macros packages who depend on the backend, like
hyperref, to check at the macro level if you are running XeTeX or not.

The best way to solve your problem is to install ifxetex:

tlmgr install ifxetex

However, you're right that ifxetex should probably be included in some other
collection like collection-latex, where things like hyperref are, to avoid the
need for the user to install it manually.

Hi TL2008-Developer,

the link "Listing of the master directory on tug.org" at the end of

It's obviously a hen-egg problem.  When people provide documentation,
there is only tlnet/tldev and it doesn't make sense to make tlnet/2008
available before the documentation is finished.

A possible solution for all the documentation written in tex is to
move the actual link from the various .tex files to a macro package.
Then, when switching from tlnet/tldev to tlnet/2008 it's sufficient to
change a macro and run pdftex/tex4ht once more.  I personally prefer
not to do such things manually but writing a script instead.  This
script could modify links in README files too.

I add this issue to my TODO list.  Thanks for reporting the problem. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've found some litter errors in my translations and fixed them.  Here
are the revised version.  Have fun.

N B, considering that utf-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark) encoding maybe inconveniently
when read by others (just as the case Norbert has told me.), these two
 files are saved in the utf-8 without BOM (Byte Order Mark).

Furthermore, if you want to remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) header of a utf-8
with BOM encoded file, just do the following:

sed -i "1s/^\xEF\xBB\xBF//" you_file_with_BOM

    Sorry for the late answer, I couldn't come back on this until this 
week-end. I think this case is closed now, but I write this for the record.

    I can confirm that, in my case, old envvar settings caused the VM 
problem at the end of the installation process (I guess during the 
format building), not during the running of TeX to process documents.

    Here is what I did :
    On my computer, I have a TL-2007 installed.
    During my first try (really as a dumb user : double-click on 
install-tl.bat, select scheme-full, keep all defaults; click on the 
"Installer teXLive" button), I hit the VM problem.
    Then I renamed all TL-2007 envvars, excluded the TL-2007 bin dir 
from  the PATH, re-started the installer, and went through the all 
process again (sorry for the waste of bandwith). It worked fine, and I 
now can  process documents.

   I don't think that there is a need to re-set the old envvar setting 
and retry the install to prove the impact of these envars, but I'm ready 
to do it, if it can help diagnose the details of what's happening.

Bruno.

Message-ID: <200808301452.m7UEqex32260@f7.net>

    How to regenerate tlpdb?

In this case, I'm not exactly sure.  Did you do the other steps?  Once
you do, does install-tl find i386-cygwin now?  If not, maybe simply
editing texlive.tlpdb and adding i386-cygwin to the list of
available_architectures in the 00texlive-installation.config package
would be enough.  That's what I'd try first, anyway.

    So, should I copy also 'lib' and 'include'? YES/NO?

You should completely ignore everything that gets installed by make
install *except* the actual binaries.  Everything else is in the texmf
tree(s) already.  (I wrote this on build.html and in various README.)

    The trick could be to rename 'i686-pc-cygwin' into 'i386-cygwin'
    but a more elegant solution is welcomed!

I already gave you the code references to where we map the config.guess
platform name to the TL platform name.

If you don't feel like making that change, then heck, maybe it would
work to copy the binaries to bin/i686-pc-cygwin.  I have no idea.

I am still not clear whether you are trying to get this to work just for
yourself, or for the Cygwin port of TeX (Live), or for re-inclusion back
into the original TeX Live distribution, or some combination.  What is
the context?

Can you tell us what TL'07 envvars you had set and their values?
(So we can try to reproduce.)

    excluded the TL-2007 bin dir from  the PATH

Siep or anyone, can you try the Windows install with the TL'07 bindir in
your path to see if that is enough to cause the VM problem?  Perhaps the
installer is somewhere not using the correctly prepended path ...

Bruno, I agree that's there no immediate need to redo the 08 install
with the 07 envvars.  Thanks for being willing in case of need.

Thanks,

Here it is :

PERL5LIB = C:\TeXLive2007\perltl\lib;C:\TeXLive2007\perltl\site\lib
TEXMFCNF = C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-var\web2c
TEXMFTEMP = C:\TeXLive2007\temp
TLroot = C:\TeXLive2007

Regarding the PATH, the only directory related to TL2007 that remains is :
C:\TeXLive2007_xxx\dviout;

(the "_xxx" string is what I added to have it point to a non-existent 
directory).

I did get a low virtual memory warning, although the installer did
pull through.

The installation could be fixed afterwards by removing the TEXMFCNF
environment variable, then running mktexlsr and then regenerating
the formats with tlmgr.

It is probably a good idea to also remove the TLroot- and TEXMFTEMP
environment variables.

This may also be set by some other apps built with perl, not only TL2007.

TEXINPUTS caused problems for some testers with MiKTeX
installed.

(MiKTeX interprets TEXINPUTS differently from kpathsea --
TEXINPUTS=./macros will look in the macros subdir of the
current working directory.    In my experience, this is quite
common among MiKTeX users.)

Now I have understood that we neeed to rename bin/i686-pc-cygwin to
bin/i386-cygwin. But...

What does it mean 'simply editing texlive.tlpdb'? Should I add at hand
something as (with linux -> cygwin)

binfiles arch=i386-linux size=3
tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux
...
name a2ping.i386-linux
category TLCore
revision 9633
shortdesc binary files of a2ping for i386-linux
binfiles arch=i386-linux size=1
bin/i386-linux/a2ping
...

It would be very annoying with the risk to forget something...
And where those numbers (rev., size=...) come from?

I have build 20080816 source (--without-xetex), have build the texlive
lzma source as in

cd source/utils/lzma && configure --disable-shared && make
strip src/lzma/lzma src/lzmadec/lzmadec

and moved the binaries (bin/i386-cygwin, lzma*.i386-cygwin) to the right
directories.

If I add only 'i386-cygwin' to the 00texlive-installation.config
section, 'install-tl' know that it is the right system, select
i386-cygwin binaries for installation but, when installing, it does not
copy the bin/i386-cygwin, even if it writes

...
Installing: bin-amstex
...

So, for the moment, the best and simplest procedure to install is

- build
- rename bin/i686-pc-cygwin to bin/i386-cygwin
- move bin/i386-cygwin to /usr/local/texlive/2008
- use 'install-tl' WITHOUT CHOOSING ANY BINARIES

the instal-tl.log has only 3 'failed' regarding 'xetex -ini...', but
this is to be expected: we have built --without-xetex!

And the installation works just fine!

If it works just for myself is enough, but if it works also for the
'comunity' is better!

The Cygwin port implies a totally different repackaging, a job for others.

    Angelo.

Dear TeXlive develpoers,

Hello, I'm a mathematics student in Nanjing University in China.

Yesterday, I installed TeXlive 2008 from the net (using net installer), but today I turned on my computer, find a error like this. In cmd window (I'm using Vista), I type
    texdoc minitoc
then an Acrobat window is supposed to be opened and view texmf-dist\doc\latex\minitoc\minitoc.pdf, however I receive a error box, which says "An internal error occured.", then the Acrobat window is closed. I saw nothing. I'm using Acrobat 9.0 and when I discuss with some guy in http://bbs.ctex.org, he says nothing wrong happens since he is using Acrobat 7. Thus I guess it should be something wrong so the texdoc is not compatible with the newest Acrobat 9.0. Or it might be a compatible problem for my Vista. 

Can you spare something and give me an explanation about it and fix it if you can? 

Thanks! I'm really a fan of your amazing work.

Dear TeXlive developers,

I'm sorry I didn't identify myself last time. I am Fengnan Gao who is studying applied mathematics in Nanjing University in China. 

This time I'm going to report something more I find today about the last email I sent to you. I happened to find that if I keep a Acrobat window open( it doesn't matter whether it is active), commands like 
    texdoc minitoc
works fine. However if there is no acrobat.exe loaded in memory, the command will not work.

Hope you solve my problem soon.

Thanks!

Fengnan Gao

Subject: [tex-live] .texdist for texlive-2008?
Message-ID: <ECC297E4-DDB4-42B6-BF97-6A457D433517@uu.nl>

The following question is Mac OSX specific. I've downloaded and  
installed a test release of texlive 2008 yesterday, and also installed  
the MacTeX-extras from Richard Koch's homepage. One thing I'm missing  
to get everything working nicely, is a .texdist bundle to be placed  
in /Library/TeX/Distribution, to use Jerome Laurens' and Gerben  
Wierda's mechanism for switching between distributions. Could I  
download this bundle somewhere? Or will it be provided in MacTeX when  
it's finished?

It has nothing to do with texdoc, because it just finds the file and
calls the pdf viewer, in your case acroread.
texdoc is not responsable for errors the pdf viewer
might have with a pdf file. Thus there is a problem with either
minitoc.pdf or AR9 (or both).

AR7/Linux and AR8/Linux do properly work with minitoc.pdf
(tested with acroread -toPostScript).

Clearly not a problem on MacOSX: both AR9 and Acrobat 9 open
minitoc.pdf without any problems. A good idea would be to locate
minitoc.pdf and try to open by other pdf viewer (BTW it should be
27,763,275 bites). And to check if AA9 can open any pdf from
write-protected directory

Well, for LaTeX's inputenc + CJK encodings you can try CJKutf8.sty (of
the CJK package).

This works just fine for me (using TeXLive SVN):

  \documentclass{article}

  \usepackage{ucs}
  \usepackage[utf8x]{vietnam}

  \begin{document}

  This is a test of ? (\horn{O}).

  \end{document}

Where's your problem?

I was doing:

\usepackage[utf8x]{vietnam}
\usepackage[T4,T5,QX,T1]{fontenc} % needed for other latin-b glyphs

which doesn't work. After seeing your example, which does work, I've
changed the order of those two lines to:

\usepackage[T4,T5,QX,T1]{fontenc} % needed for other latin-b glyphs
\usepackage[utf8x]{vietnam}

and it works now. Well, unless you use autofe that is. It doesn't
switch correctly to whatever vietnam sets up T5 to be.

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{autofe}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[T4,T5,T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8x]{vietnam}

\begin{document}
You should see N with left hook followed by O with horn:
\fontencoding{T4}\selectfont
\unichar{"019D} % \textNhookleft
%\fontencoding{T5}\selectfont % -- error with this line commented out
\unichar{"01A0} % \horn O
\end{document}

The error is quite confusing:
! LaTeX Error: Command \horn{O} unavailable in encoding T5.

Hi,

As Heiko said, this probably has nothing to do with texdoc: texdoc is not able
 to create windows or error boxes :-)

For this, 'texdoc -I -l minitoc' is your friend.

Well, also just try to open minitoc.pdf in AR9 wihtout calling texodc, just to
make really clear that it is a problem with AR9 and this particular file.

If you often have problems with AR9 and want ttexdoc to permanently use an
other pdf viewer, you may want to read section 3 of texdoc's manual.

Hi @ all,

I've just installed TeXLive 2k8 on my vista machine and got the following 
problem that the tlmgr (Texlivemanager) doesn't want to start, if I try to

is done:

"Undefined subroutine &main::debug called at

Compilation failed in reqzire at

can somebody help or has somebody an idea what's going wrong?

Thanks
