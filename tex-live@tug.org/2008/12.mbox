ahh, that might explain why it has been to hard for me to test a otf 
font placed in the same dir as my xelatex file.

(I have an OTF font I need to be able to use in latex and pdflatex, but 
wanted to test it with xelatex first, though never successful)

You ought to be able to do that, but you'd have to use the actual  
filename rather than the font (family) name; see the ExternalLocation  
option in the fontspec package. (I don't really recommend this except  
for testing or other special purposes.)

It seems that Norbert just fixed this problem. Give the fix a few

I don't, but the xetex mailing list would be the best place to ask.  
I'm sure other people there have done this.

Yes, but you have to use the .exe updater ... that is you have to get
the update-tlmgr-latest.exe ...

Karl: We have to push out the critical things soon, otherwise this will
happen with all new installations. 

The wrapper is in bin-texlive.win32 ...

After two unsuccessful vista-trys I installed it on ubuntu with binaries
for linux and win32.

This system works on both machines.

Can I use the tlmgr on linux to update both binaries?

I tried this a few hours ago - this only updates packages

on windows you must specify tlmgr update texlive.infra bin-texlive

Right, you can. And the bug only appears on Windows, not on any other.
It is a bug in the texlua wrapper we use.

that is rather anoying, I just ran it on a system on linux, that has 
only been updated via 'update --all'

tlmgr update texlive.infra bin-texlive

gave nothing new

can you name any windows binaries that have been updated, then I'll see 
if I've gotten those changes.

No you don't. On windows you *cannot* update tlmgr with it self, because
you cannot overwrite open files.

Normally when you call
	tlmgr update --all
on Windows on the Desktop a shortcut is created to a "Final Installation
Step" which has to be run manually. Yes.

Or you fetch
	update-tlmgr-latest.exe
from CTAN/system/texlive/tlnet/2008/ and just run it. Then you have all
you need.

It isn't sooo hard. And complain to Microsoft that they cannot write a
decent OS.

Don't ask me. But I am sure it does *not* replace files which have been
opened by the update program. In our case it is a perl script and that
cannot be replaced on the fly.

If you find a solution we would be happy. The .exe that we provide is
already quite nice.

it is nice, but if users are not informed that there is now an extra 
program that they have to run, then it is a bit of a problem. But I'm 
sure you give enough information to the user.

Could one wrap tlmgr? such that it is another program that starts tlmgr, 
and then when tlmgr is finished it looks for an update file, and runs it 
if it is present.

Though then the problem is when there is an error in the update wrapper 
program and that has to be updated.

hmm...

There is a windows-like solution for updating the wrapper. It first
prepares another script, istalls it to be run at startup and issues
the tradditional message "Windows need to be restarted". Upon restart
the auxilliary script will update the wrapper, remove itself from
startup and run the new wrapper. Hopefully a simple wrapper would not
need frequent updates.

Aehmmm... there is:
- a BIG FAT WARNING in the GUI, extra windows
- a BIG FAT WARNING at the end of the tlmgr update --all run

If people cannot *read* then I cannot change anything.

That script we have already prepared, that is the "Final Installation
Step" shortcut which links to a .bat file in tlpkg/temp.

But we do not "please restart" ...

The problem is not the wrapper, the problem is the perl code itself.
Since all the updating is done via the perl code, all the perl modules
are opened by the perl interpreter, so *nothing* can be replaced.

And format the hard disk in the mean time. Wait ... (Norbert changing

for updating your TeX Live installation will reboot once normally, and
on second reboot all of your Windows will be lost and only dancing

Great simplification of the code.

Not quite sure what you are exactly speaking about, but when miktex
updates the update manager (and that happens sometimes) it forces a
two-step update: At first only some binaries can be installed and then
you have to restart the manager and can go on.

The proper action is of course to let the installer reboot Windows at
least twice.

I interpreted this mail that the bug in tlmgr win has bin fixed. So I
thought the corrected files would be deployed by an update.

I think it has changed -- running miktex in wine on linux or macOSX
there have been updates that include the package manager that
will fail if you just run mpm as you do for other updates.  The trick
for wine is make a copy of mpm.exe in some other location, then run
the copy to get a new mpm.exe in the right place, and finally delete the
old version.    I assume some similar trickery happens behind the
scenes in real windows, but if doesn't work in wine it is a more obscure
level of trickery.

I suppose texlive for windows could just create a copy of the installer
and all the related libraries each time it is run, then discard that
potentially outdated version when it finishes.

No, I have fixed it this morning CET, tonight there will be probably no
update due to Karl being offline, so tomorrow night the stuff on tug.org
will be rebuilt, after that it takes about one day for all CTAN mirrors
to pick up the changes.

Quite similar as already done in TL2008. So girls and boys, please stop 
divagating and do try what was already done, as Norbert explained. Once 
again:
-- download update-tlmgr-latest.exe and run it (on Win32; on Vista 
   right-click that .exe file and allow to run "as administrator")
or
-- when updating tlmgr by itself:
   1. please have a look at the message; exit tlmgr
   2. run "Final step..." by clicking the icon on desktop; after that the 
      icon will dissapear.
 
Thanks,

Indeed.  RMS would be delighted.  I suggest to make this available as
an undocumented option, probably

  tlmgr --rms

An alternative is of course

  tlmgr --help

actually, it's nearer 2 days :-(

and it's indeterminate, i'm afraid.  the central ctan sites will all
have it within an hour or so of 0700 gmt, but timing isn't necessarily
exact (transfers take a long time, sometimes), and the times at which
mirrors pick up from their designated ctan can add up to a day, and some
mirrors mirror other mirrors, which can in principal add getting on for
another day (and still be acceptable to the mirror.ctan.org).

this mirroring mechanism isn't great, but it's the best we've got :-(

Robin, it IS fine!!! Nobody needs to run tlmgr on a daily basis, writing
TeX documents is more important ;-)

To be serious again: The idea of copying the whole Perl stuff needed
for running tlmgr looks like a good idea IMHO.  It still would mean
shuffling around a few Megabytes, but it would elegantly avoid the
file locking problems.  In other words, a Windows user should have to
execute a batch file like this if clicking on the tlmgr icon:

  <set up environment variables>
  cpdir <tlmgrdir> <tlmgrdir-temp>
  <tlmgrdir-temp>\tlmgr

[This is how little Werner sees the Windows world.]

it would be interesting to try hard links (NTFS has them):

<http://www.flexhex.com/docs/articles/hard-links.phtml>

What are the Win32 (and BSD) equivilants of GNU "cp --link"?
Does perl.exe in TL support link?   Is anybody running
Win32 TeX Live on FAT filesystems (maybe USB stick)?

On real Win32 the link count from GNU "ls -l" is 2.   Furthermore,
in an NTFS partition that has a 4GB .iso file and 1.5GB free,
"cp --link file.iso link.iso" runs in a few seconds and does not
reduce the free space.    I suspect McAfee was responsible for
the delay.

Note that Wine hasn't implemented links (using GNU cp from
the GnuWin32), so you need real Win32 and NTFS to test:

C:\Testing>cp --version
cp (GNU coreutils) 5.3.0
C:\Testing>cp --link refcard.tex r2.tex
fixme:tape:BackupWrite (0x60, 0x62f9f0, 20, 0x62f7d8, 0, 0, 0x62f7dc)

Hmmmmmmmm ... well, as an idea I will save it, but I am not overly happy
with that. Furthermore, replacing the built-in perl (tlperl) we have
would need another huge copy action.

I will see what one can do.

Hi,
while you are talking about the annoying file locking problem, there
is one thing which is probably worthwhile to investigate:

There is (at least) one strange thing on Windows.  Norbert actually
detected it when we had been working on the texlua wrappers but I
tested it with Perl too and got the same result.

The execvpe() system call behaves differently on Unix and Windows:

On Unix it simply replaces the current process image by another one.
On Windows the parent process terminates immediately after the newly
created process had been launched.  This means that the child process
is running asynchronously (in Unix parlance: in the background).

This behavior bothered us a lot some time ago but maybe it is quite
useful in order to circumvent some other Windows problems.

Suppose that you invoke foo.pl from the command line and foo.pl
contains the line 

   exec('perl', 'bar.pl');

then foo.pl returns immediately (to the command line) after bar.pl has
been launched.  I suppose that a kid can remove its parent from the
file system then because the parent process is finished when the child
process is running.  My tests didn't go so far, but it's not unlikely
that it works.

If it works properly, maybe the "final steps" script could be invoked
automatically and the shortcut can be avoided. 

There are some things to consider when using exec() on Windows.  Since
the child process is running in the background, it should not ask for
user input.  It will hang and wait for input forever.  The only thing
you can do then is to kill the process using the process manager.
Windows has no concept of job control.  In TeX parlance, the script
has to be run in \batchmode or \nonstopmode.

However, if user input is required, then the child process has either
to be invoked explicitely in a cmd window or it has to provide a GUI.

If this really works, tlmgr could exec() a script which updates tlmgr
and this script finally could exec() the new version of tlmgr again.
Or an uninstaller could exec('cmd', '/c', 'del', '%me%'), while what
to remove is passed to the child process via the environment.

I don't know whether it works as expected, Windows is always good for
surprises, but it would be nice if it works as explained.  Some
Windows specific problems could be solved more straightforward then.

BTW, it seems that the behavior of execvpe() on Windows originates
from MS-DOG.  You could only run one process at the same time.  My old
Atari ST suffered from the same problem.  There had been a system
function called chain() which allowed a program to replace itself by
another one.  It seems that execvpe() on Windows is supposed to do
something very similar.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The reason is that there is no direct equivalent of fork(). It is the
same in OS/2. If you wish to start a new process, you have to use
Windows or OS/2 specific system functions, exec in perl is just kind
of emulation. The fork() function is emulated in OS/2 in EMX and in
Windows in RSX but the Windows port of perl apparently does not make
use of RSX (and I never tried RSX in Vista).

Hi Staszek,
do you really believe that these "kids" didn't experience the same
problems themselves?  Are you sure that these "kids" don't understand
the jokes?

BTW, I dislike the word "kid".  When I attended the high school, I had
my own opinions and I always had been pissed off if anybody treated me
as a kid.  It's very likely that some of the TeX guys at the
Werdenfels Gymnasium are more experienced than me. If there had been
a course about PSTricks, then they all ***definitely*** have much more
experience than me.

It would be nice if we could avoid the word "kid" if we are talking
about pupils.  As I said, most of these honorable guys have more
experince than me in some areas.  Treating them as stupid "kids" is
certainly insulting and counterproductive.

Regards,
   Reinhard

I suppose that this will not work (but not tested). The reason is that
any child process gets the same open file handles as the parent on W32,
so all the perl files will be open still in the client.

This really concerns the texlive-latex-extra package distributed by
Ubuntu (and Debian), but the Ubuntu package managers directed me here.
Anyway, I'm wondering why this package contains Version 1.1 (2005/05/12)
of enumitem.sty rather than the current Version 2.1 (2007/06/30), which
obviously has been out for some time now.  The answer from the Ubuntu
package managers was that they just use whatever texlive provides, so I
guess the question is, why doesn't texlive distribute the newer version?

I have ActivePerl installed on Vista.
Basically, tlmgr --help gives an error "The system cannot find the drive
specified."
The script tlmgr knows I have perldoc, and tries to call perldoc to
show the help.
The error is caused by the Pod::Usage perl module, in which
$Config{scriptdir} returned "X:\perl\bin".
ActivePerl correctly returns "C:\perl\bin" while tlperl returns
"X:\perl\bin".
I am not sure if this is common on all systems. Could someone look into
this issue? Thanks a lot.

And what TL do you have? 2008? or earlier? My guess is that you have a
prior version. If you have 2008 you can update it using tlmgr

I have what is distributed by default with the very latest release of
Ubuntu (and hence of Debian as well), but you're right, it looks like
it's a 2007 version.  This is a bit surprising to me since the current
version of Ubuntu (8.10, "Intrepid Ibis") was released in October of
2008 (hence the 8.10).  They freeze the packages a few months earlier,
but still ...

I had already put a new version of enumitem.sty in my personal texmf
directory, so I'm ok personally.  I just wanted to make sure that this
had been noticed by all concerned.

Thanks for all you do.

I assume the Ubuntu TeX Live packages are more or less directly taken
from the Debian packages. And TL'08 is still not packaged in Debian,
mainly (I suppose, after what I read in the Debian TeX mailing list, but
Norbert will be able to give more details) due to lack of time of the
developpers, and maybe the Debian timeline with the upcoming release of
Lenny.

FYI, there was a big change in the TeX Live infrastructure for the 2008
version, so packagers of linux distros need to rewrite/adapt most of
their tools for converting TL packages into deb/rpm/whatever packages.
That's why it takes more time than a normal update.

Manuel.

Just a note of clarification:

The "real" TeX Live 2008 (RTL) distribution from CTAN can be installed
on Ubuntu 8.10
or other debian distros "alongside" the existing texlive 2007 managed
by dpkg (DTL).
To use RTL you just put the bin/<arch> directory before /usr/bin in
your path so the
RTL binaries will be used.  In case of trouble you can always revert to DTL, so,
assuming you have disk space, life with DTL+RTL is better than life
with DTL alone.

RTL does not add anything to "system" directories, and can (in fact,
should) be installed
using only regular user privileges.   If you are at a site where it
costs real money to have
a security review and then an admin install or update a package, RTL
may help your thru
the current financial crunch.

Now that RTL has a package manager, you can benefit from bug fixes and
other updates
without the need to configure/install by hand, but you don't get
things like kdvi that are
better integrated with the distribution's GUI environment.   The
package manager is
not as robust as that of MikTeX (which also runs in linux), but is
serviceable and is being improved.

In Debian and thus in Ubuntu there is TeX Live 2007 which was released
in February 2007 (AFAIR), thus the version 2.1 from June cannot be
included.

Again, release of TeX Live 2007 was beginning of 2007, and TeX Live 2008
has not been packaged for Debian till now. I have currently not the time
and energy, doing a bit here and there, but it is not ready.

Furthermore, until Debian/Lenny is released nothing newer then TL2007
will be included into Debian. For lenny+1 (and whatever Ubuntu release
that will be) TL 2008 is our aim.

Still, there is work to be done in the packaging. I have started
already, and any help is appreciated. That you can pass on to the Ubuntu
guys, maybe they want to contribute a bit.

Best wishes

Norbert

One BIG BIG BIG caveat here: You HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY RENAME THE 
	Real TeX Live install-info
to something else, otherwise the installation of MANY packages will fail
because Debian (thus Ubuntu) ships its own version of install-info
(don't ask me why, it is, and we try since years to fix that, and thanks

Howdy,

One of the folks reporting the problem with BasicTeX on the Mac (see  
the message above with its TeX Live content) found a solution for the  
missing ptmr7t font problem on the net at <http://www.geekness.net/? 
p=10>. I wonder if the ?TeX Live basic scheme? or ?LaTeX recommended  
packages" should include the lw35nfss fonts or collection- 
fontsrecommended (if the size isn't prohibitive.

Good Luck,

Same problem here on XP with ActivePerl's perldoc ("device not available"; I
do have an X: drive, which would explain that particular message).

As it turned out I only used Perl for TeX Live, but with 2008 this is no
longer needed, so I have been able to reclaim some megabytes of data now.
But I guess this 'solution' won't solve the problem for other users.

I have ActivePerl installed on Vista.
Basically, tlmgr --help gives an error "The system cannot find the drive
specified."
The script tlmgr knows I have perldoc, and tries to call perldoc to
show the help.
The error is caused by the Pod::Usage perl module, in which
$Config{scriptdir} returned "X:\perl\bin".
ActivePerl correctly returns "C:\perl\bin" while tlperl returns
"X:\perl\bin".
I am not sure if this is common on all systems. Could someone look into
this issue? Thanks a lot.

    I wonder if the ?TeX Live basic scheme? or ?LaTeX recommended  
    packages" should include the lw35nfss fonts or collection- 
    fontsrecommended (if the size isn't prohibitive.

lw35nfss is already included in collection-fontsrecommended.  That
collection is not part of the "basic" scheme because, well, it's not
basic.  It is part of virtually every other scheme because, well, it's
recommended.

I think the best answer would be for Dick to include either
collection-fontsrecommended or just times (if someone can confirm that
is enough) in BasicTeX.  Then the problem goes away.  Or, heck, get rid
of IEEE in BasicTeX :).

That's probably correct.
I run CentOS and Fedora and I generally prefer to use the vendor 
provided packages whenever possible, and when the vendor does not 
provide packages, I tend to package the software myself via RPM - so 
that it is linked against the vendor provided library versions.

However, LaTeX Live is a different story. IMHO LaTeX should NOT be under 
vendor package management but should be installed from the TeX Live 
installer in /opt/texlive (or in /usr/local/texlive). This avoids the 
need to reinstall with an OS update (assuming /opt is a separate 
partition as it should be) and allows fresh versions to be installed.

It does cause a minor issue. For example, the emacs-auctex RPM package 
will depend upon the Fedora TeX packaging. This is resolved by a dummy 
package.

I actually create a user/group called texlive that owns the texlive 
installation and have a few wrapper scripts for when an rpm wants to run 
texhash or updmap as root.

If anyone is interested in my rpm spec file, mail me off list. I'm 
guessing a very similar thing could be done with ubuntu/debian but I 
have zero knowledge of how their packaging system works.

The reason I like to keep LaTeX outside of RPM control is because every 
update to TeXLive (IE 2007 to 2008) something changes with the memoir 
class that requires me to update projects to get them to succesfully 
compile. Keeping TeXLive outside of the package manager makes it easier 
to have multiple versions installed.

For example, to compile something in TeX Live 2004 I symply need to do

export PATH=/opt/texlive/2004/bin/i386-linux:$PATH

The only hitch - sometimes after an OS upgrade, you need to install a 
few old shared libraries in order for old versions of TeX Live to 
continue to function. That usually isn't too much of a problem. Anyway - 
it means that if several years from now, I need to update a project 
originally done in TL 2008 - I can do so without needing to figure out 
what broke when trying to do it in TL 2012 and how the changes to make 
it compile impact the typesetting. If I haven't ported my source to TL 
2012 yet then I can update an old project without needing to.

Anyway, I do suggest using the TeX Live installer for TeX Live rather 
than OS vendor packages.

script which makes retypesetting their documents quick and easy.) Ok,
one could argue (as I might) that one should not continually examine the
typeset appearance of the document one is working on, and instead leave
appearance to the end. Still it's a habit people do get into.

Hi Norbert,
I tested it today.  Unfortunately you are right.  However, the child
process had been able to remove its parent process from the disk, but
it had not been able to remove a file which had been opened by the
parent when exec() was executed.  Hence, the idea is not much worth
except, maybe, in some very rare situations.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks.  For dvipdfmx, we have V 4.  Do you know of some reason we
should not use 4 for dvipdfm too?  I'll change it to that barring advice
to the contrary.  (Those PDF version "errors" are so uselessly painful.)

    Some people here still use latex(1) and dvips(1)/ps2pdf(1) or dvipdfm(1)

FYI, I suggest using dvipdfmx (maintained) instead of dvipdfm
(unmaintained).

    irksome to have manually to close and reopen the PDF file

"irksome" is an understatement!  FWIW, on Windows, I am told that Sumatra
PDF can reload documents.  http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/

On Unix-based platforms, xpdf, evince, and virtually all PDF readers
other than Adobe's can reload.

    but I would like to wean users off latex(1) and DVI and onto pdflatex(1)

There are other reasons to use latex instead of pdflatex -- pstricks is
one (though see the auto-pst-pdf package), eps figures (when conversion
is undesirable, as the AMS and other publishers suggest) is another.

Best,
Karl

In dvipdfm, only V 2 and V 3 are allowed, for example,
 
	  if (level >= 2 && level <= 3) {
	    pdf_set_version(level);
	  } else {
	    fprintf (stderr, "\nNumber following version specification is out of range\n\n");
	  }

If you change sources like the above, it is formally possible
to support higher numbers. But I think we should use dvipdfmx.

Akira

Hi Akira,
is dvipdfm just a subset of dvipdfmx?

If yes, and if dvipdfm is unmaintained, I'm wondering whether it makes
sense to replace it by a symlink to dvipdfmx (or by a wrapper on
Windows).

The reason I ask has to do with the format of .map files.  dvipdfm has
its own format and Mark Wicks insisted on it when Thomas Esser asked
him to change it.  Hence, updmap has to translate all map-file entries
into the format which dvipdfm understands.  This is a very expensive
operation.  It's time consuming and error-prone.

>From texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg:
----------------------------------
%% teTeX 2.x using updmap

f  dvipdfm.map

%% MiKTeX 2.2 and 2.3

%f psfonts.map
----------------------------------

It would be great if dvipdfmx guys could switch to psfonts.map, as
obviously done in MikTeX already.  It's probably not a big deal since
the code of the map-file parser seems to exist in the MikTeX sources
already.  It also exists in the dvips sources, of course.

Since dvipdfmx is well maintaned, AFAIK, I have some hope that someone
looks into it in the near future.  The question is whether dvipdfm is
still needed or can be replaced by a symlink.  If dvipdfm is obsolete,
I assume that dvipdfmx maintainers are more willing to do this useful
change.  If not, I fear that the nasty translation code in updmap
can't be avoided.

Please note that there is currently a shell script for Unix and a Perl
script for Windows.  Maintaining both is a pain.  I'm actually not
sure that the Windows version works properly at all.  Even if updmap
would be written from scratch, it's very desirable if dvipdfm*
understand(s) psfonts.map so that the translation code can be avoided.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I hope so. If not, we can ask Cho and Matthias.

dvipdfmx already understands map files of dvips format, as well as
of its own format.

ChoF and colleagues have already been working for years to make fmx a
compatible replacement for fm, at my urging.  Maybe 2009 will be the
year we can do it.

Great!  I'm very glad to hear this.  Thanks for the info.

Message-ID: <68bfdc900812061008p217db636v18972a86a0be162d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I want to report that TL failed to build on FreeBSD 8-CURRENT i386.
I upgrade the system to the latest version (today's snapshot), and run
portupgrade to upgrade all the needed ports (like fontconfig and
gmake) to the current version.
Then I de-lzma the texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma in the live dvd,
run ./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/local.
And the build script stop when compiling the ncurses library. It is a
compiler error. So I hope it can be fixed soon.
(to provide additional information: FreeBSD upgrade their ncurses
library a few weeks ago, maybe what's why it failed to build?)

All very nice but error meesages would help a bit ...

Hi, Norbert:

well:
first I build it like this:
[yue at localhost ~/texlive-20080816-source]$ ./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/local/
.... lots of information ....

This is really bad: I think it should be documented somewhere (like
the README for instance).

So I added the GNUMAKE environment, and I was very happy because the
configure are successful. But something happens:

for some reason your system does not include /usr/include/sys/ttydev.h

do you know why it is absent/how to add it?

Actually I didn't read the README carefully. it said
- GNU make.  If your GNU make is invoked by some name other than `make',
 try setting the envvar TL_MAKE to what is needed.
and I forget to do this. Sorry. The README is correct.


Karl: I think you are the one who can modify the "TeXLive bugs" page.
Can you add the ncurses issue?

I have already commit the new

thanks!

It's indeed not the usual sort of informatics-courses at bavarian
high-schools. In fact there have been a few attempts to introduce LaTeX
into bavarian high-schools but the resonance was poor :-(
[Maybe the problems of installing a TeX-System - it was the time of
emTeX and 20 3,5"-disks - caused this]

As of today, only a few teachers are using LaTeX for there work and so
there is not much examples for the pupils.
Even a database of prepared lessons and exercises using TeX
(http://btmdx1.mat.uni-bayreuth.de/smart/wp/index.php [in german]) did
not bring things any further.

Also DANTE e.V. had founded a team (AK Schule) for spreading LaTeX into
schools an we didn't achieve anything ...

OK, back to us: At my school of 1100 pupils only 10 to 20 per year are
learning LaTeX. Maybe 5 to 10 will use it out of the course for there work.

This may clarify why this pupils are very committed in computer related
things. A team of them is preparing our so called 'Jahresbericht'
(report of the schoolyear) about 250 pages using LaTeX.

It's very hard to see, how many people (teachers and pupils) could not
be convinced by the advantages of LaTeX. :-(
[in fact of all your work on TeXLive and Christians work on MiKTeX has
made things much more easier as my beginning using emTeX)

I've no reason to think that V 4 won't do - the value just needs to be
consistent, of course. Thanks!

Thanks for the reminder - we supply xpdf and evince, but users will
fasten on to Adobe Acrobat Reader! (Which was outrageously buggy with
regard to printing in the previous version - version 7, though evince(1)
was also disgustingly bad for printing until fairly recently.) I've long
used xpdf(1), myself.

Yes, PSTricks is still the greatest reason given by users here why they
stay with dvips(1) etc. Printing dvips(1) output landscape is something
else that never seems to be straightforward for them - either they don't
specify 'dvips -t landscape' and then get into difficulties trying to
postprocess the output, or they do both!

Hello Natalie,

I just read your posting. All you need is to add ", exec" to the cdrom
options in "/etc/fstab". Example:
...
/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8   0 0
...
Should you have "noexec" then delete it. 

In order to run "./install --gui" (with GUI) you need to install
"perl-tk" first.

I hope this will work for you.

Hi John and Karl,
V 4 is definitely a good choice because recent versions of ghostscript
create PDF-1.4 by default.  And thus, epstopdf too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] report: installing on vista, using standard-configuration
Message-ID: <493D94CA.6090809@gmx.org>

Hi!

I'm testing out way for my pupils to get TeXLive2008 running.

Doing this, I made a netinstall using the standard configuration of the
installer (C:\programme\texlive) as shown in screenshot
'texlive_vista_installationsort_eingestellt'.

I was very surprised, finding most of the installation files in a newly
created C:\program\ (without texlive) as shown in
'texlive_vista_installationsort_tatsaechlich'.

This folder 'program' has been newly created by the installer and it
seems to me its not identical to the system-folder program which is
identical with programme (its a sort of an language-mapping by windows
which does not seem to work properly)

As a succession of this, the local-texmf could not be found and had to
be corrected manually.

Any copying and any start of tlmgr has to be done in admin-mode - this
is very unpracticable.

Maybe you should consider to change the standard-installation-folder.

I managed it to get this installation working but ist not the way I
should explain it to my pupils ...

I'll give a new installtion to C:\texlive a try next friday ...

Andreas

That is not a screen shot of what you have set. Did you *really* change
the destination folder? Did it show up in the GUI window next to TEXDIR
setting?

Otherwise I am quite surprised.

Bummer.

That seems all really messed up.

Unfortunately I cannot test it anymore, I abolished Vista from my
laptop, it was a PITA.

Well, tlmgr changes things in the configuration, and if you install as
admin you should only be able as admin to change something.

> Maybe you should consider to change the standard-installation-folder.

That should already happen ...

Thanks for your report, maybe Siep has more ideas than me.

Hi Norbert,

I didn't change the directories in the installer, so it points to
c:/programme/texlive/2008 (as I remind). I will check this.

Yes.

But the problem ist, normal users get only vista for other one year and
telling pupils to install XP or switch to Linux is not the way ...

As I'm (we) have the aim to spread TeX, wie are looking for a way it
will run ander this circumstances.

Not really. It looks a bit like a quoting error in combination with
a localization mixup. I don't have any localized copies of Windows
to investigate, but I wouldn't be too surprised if typing `dir' in a
command prompt gave different names from what Windows Explorer tells
you.

Hi Stratos and all,

Last month, you reported:

    tlmgr does not work correctly on FreeBSD. First of all, tlmgr uses tar
    with option --owner,

We've finally managed to avoid that.  I think the invocation will work
with any tar now.

I expect we'll update tlmgr with these changes (among many others) in
the next day or two.

Best,
karl

Unfortunately I updated texlive just 2 minutes before I read your message,
by using the trick you suggested in a previous message (symlinking tar to
gtar).

Now I have:
# tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 11536 (2008-12-06 12:46:06 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2008
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008
texlive-20080903

I will try the plain tar when a new package update will be available and I
will report the results.

Thank you again,
Stratos

It means either that you have removed these packages with
	tlmgr remove --force ...
or that the packages have NOT been installed together with the updated
collection. That is easily possible due to bugs we had in tlmgr.

To fix that call
	tlmgr install collection-latexextra collection-xetex
etc, hopefully that fixes the missing packages.

It happened with me about month ago and I just installed collections.
After this everything has been normal except messages

pdftex.x86_64-linux: local revision (10322) is newer than revision in
http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 (10309), not updating.

I suggest to run a control

tlmgr list |grep "^i"|wc -l

where as of today correct answer is 1794 (possibly except Windows).

Not nearest. I plan to update luatext in texlive around version
0.40 (sometime in the spring of 2009)

    Either put this file into the right place or remove the

    to disable unavailable map files is to call
      updmap --syncwithtrees

This happens on both x64_linux and macos
Running updmap --syncwithtrees cured or at least masked the problem

The thread in the subject was only two messages and then stopped with
no reply by anyone in the know. This same problem has been happening
to me too, for at least a week now. Has there been any resolution?

Also, I downloaded and ran
   update-tlmgr-r11500.exe
whose name suggests it updates to version 11500, but tlmgr --version
reports 11452 both before and after the update.

To those have the same problem:
you can modify texlive\2008\tlpkg\tlperl\lib\Config.pm to get around it.
Just replace all x:\\ by your drive letter.

I mean :

Hi Jhonny,

and thanks for your interest in TeX Live. There are many ways of
obtaining TeX Live, and the DVD (not the CD) may not be the more
convenient. For more information, please read:

http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html

If you really want to get a DVD my snail mail, you can order one from
the TUG.

http://tug.org/store/#software

You can also get the DVD of the TeX collection *and* support TeX
development by joining a user group:

Message-ID: <494410AD.4000909@earthlink.net>

     I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade from TL 2007 to TL 2008, 
installing from the September 2008 DVD. I followed the instructions for 
Unix (I'm running Fedora 5), cd'ing to /mnt/dvd/texlive and then:
 > perl install-tl -help
which produced the typical help listing, then
 > perl install-tl
which printed the following and gave up:

TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 
1042.
./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux --help failed (status 32256): 
No such file or directory
Output is:
Can't exec "./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux": Permission 
denied at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1045

     I initially tried as an ordinary user, then called su as it seemed 
to be a permissions problem and tried again. The results were identical. 
At the end the message said to inform texlive at tug.org, so here you are. 
I googled comp.text.tex first, though, but couldn't find anything relevent.

Hi Peter,

    denied at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1045

I expect you have the DVD mounted with the noexec option.  Unfortunately
we did not foresee this, hence the mysterious error message.

The simplest solution is to remount it without noexec, one way or another.

    Also, I downloaded and ran
       update-tlmgr-r11500.exe
    whose name suggests it updates to version 11500, but tlmgr --version
    reports 11452 both before and after the update.

I don't know for sure about this particular case, but it is normal,
though confusing, for the rev in the filename to be newer than the tlmgr
--version rev, because of how we compute it (depends on how many changes
intervene between the last tlmgr change and rebuilding the archive).
Probably we should fix it to just use the tlmgr version in the filename.

Anyway, we pushed a new version of tlmgr last night
(update-tlmgr-r11601, also tlmgr version 11601 by chance), and will do
so again tonight with some small doc changes, probably tlmgr 11610.

Best,

While I had a hard time resisting temptation to ask what the poster
was smoking or sniffing, some questions still remain:

1) Is TL2009 planned?

2) If there will be TL2009 how installation would be different from
TL2008 completely update with tlmgr?

While there seem to be no point to download TL2009 for current users,
for new users downloading TL2008 and then making massive update after
does not look right (sure, there is a network installer).

It would be nice to have some ideas about future plans - mainly to be
able to rebuff such "expert advice" without guesswork.

Thanks in advance

Actually I think this is a perfectly viable approach unless someone
actually *needs* a particular update.  After all, this is the first year
TL has had updates.  That did not make TL useless for the last decade.

    2) If there will be TL2009 how installation would be different from
    TL2008 completely update with tlmgr?

We haven't figured out tl09 deployment yet -- the earliest we can
realistically hope for is summer 09.  But my expectation is that it
won't be possible to use tlmgr update to get from 08 to 09.  We have a
list of infrastructure things we want to improve which cannot be done
while retaining compatibility with the oh-so-ancient :) version that is
on the 08 DVD.

I'd be curious if it is possible to use the miktex package manager to
upgrade between significant releases.

Hi,

I just wanted to be certain that the jadetex command in texlive is the same as:
http://jadetex.sourceforge.net/

OpenBSD currently has a jadetex port, but I am wondering if it is
needed if texlive has it already.

Thanks

No, it isn't possible.  But what is possible (and useful) is a simple 
mechanism for importing into the new installation the same packages that 
were installed in the old one.  See http://miktex.org/2.7/setup (near 
the bottom of the page, under "Upgrading a previous MiKTeX installation").

It is true. Many (most?) of my esteemed colleagues still use tetex 3.0.

I think it is possible (since it was ported to UNIX) but the good
question is that where updates will come from: CTAN or MikTeX website.
If I remember correctly the author of MikTeX has a personal license
from Bill Gates to distribute any packages he wants and you have not
managed to secure such an indulgence :-)

For the last decade people who needed an update to the texmf trees had
to put the update in a local tree, and hopefully remember to remove local
additions once they appear in the main trees.  The package manager
should greatly reduce the need to have stuff from CTAN in local texmf
trees.

Fine grained updating means people can be finding problems year 'round
rather than focusing on TL release testing.   I expect release testing to
become more about the package manager.   The problem with the "if it
ain't broke don't fix it approach" is that when the inevitable breakdown
does occur one discovers that a "stitch in time saves nine" has merit.
A good example was when pdftex started to be used for .dvi output.  Some
users had been constructing documents using mistaken methods to
test for pdf output.

What defines a significant release?   With a package manager that can
update binaries "anytime", a new release is only needed when the packaging
changes or maybe when few packages in the last release don't have updates.

No. upgrades from e.g. 2.6->2.7 mean a new installation. The new release
can even be installed in parallel to an existing one, you only have to
change the pathes to switch between the versions (I do find this quite
reassuring, if the installation fails for some reason you don't end with
a non-working TeX). It is also possible to import packages from the old
version so you don't have to reinstall/download everything.

the tex live team doesn't ... it's all the fault of the user groups.

pace the other post (saying up-version upgrades aren't possible), you
get miktex stuff from a miktex repository, which a mirrored copy of the
master that christian puts on one of dante's machines.  mirror sites
include all ctan mirrors

i doubt anyone's relying on indulgences from bill (being as he's nothing
but a shareholder, these days), but if they are, the agreement _must_ be
transitive as otherwise the whole of the miktex update framework would
already have disappeared into the aether.

    I just wanted to be certain that the jadetex command in texlive is
    the same as: http://jadetex.sourceforge.net/

Evidently so, in general.

Running jadetex in TL reports that it is version 3.12, while
http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=28782 says
there is 3.13, released in 2003.  Perhaps someone would like to figure
out what needs to be updated?

fwiw, ctan holds 3.13 (and has since 2004).  i checked that it was the
same thing as on the sourceforge site, last night.

That is newer than the version on the CTAN mirror I used last night.
After refreshing my local mirror, I get:

$ tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: installation location <local mirror>

Package:    rsfs
Category:   Package
ShortDesc:  Ralph Smith's Formal Script font.
LongDesc:   The fonts provide uppercase 'formal' script letters for
use as symbols in scientific and mathematical typesetting (in contrast
to the informal script fonts such as that used for the 'calligraphic'
symbols in the TeX maths symbol font). The fonts are provided as
MetaFont source, and as derived Adobe Type 1 format. LaTeX support,
for using these fonts in mathematics, is available via one of the
packages calrsfs and mathrsfs.

Comparing rsfs entries of texlive.tlpdb before and after the update,
rsfs.map is not listed
in the new (11671) entry.  This looks like an omission from the new
11617 version.

it's not surprising your mirror last night didn't have something ctan
itself only acquired during the course of last night.

victor is (afaict) right: the map file (which was never on ctan, i
think) seems to have been lost in the tl update following the changes i
made to ctan yesterday (basically, amalgamating the ctan package
containing the metafont fonts with the one containing the type1 fonts).

perhaps when the map reappears in tl, i ought to put it on ctan too, to
avoid future problems...

Such an omission could be intentional if the map entries are
taken from elsewhere -- are existing documents broken?

On my system, these entries are still present in the generated map
files, but the
timestamps are older than updmap.log -- it seems that updmap leaves
the old files
when a map file is not found, so this problem could result in not
being able to use
some other font that was being installed.

Yes it looks like a DVD problem.

I installed FC9 now and i guess its fine now. TexLive is available by default in FC9!

I installed a minimal configuration of TeXLive 2008 on Linux, and then added
bin-texdoc using tlmgr. Unfortunately, no link for texdoc was created in
/usr/local/bin, as was done for the other binaries during the initial
installation. Is this a feature or a bug?
IMHO, just as install-tl has an option for installing links in system
directories, the same should be available in tlmgr.

Message-ID: <F72C8A7955184ACB9DB6185363A80B5E@keith>

Dear TeX-Live

Peter Dyballa suggests I may have encountered a bug in the updating procedure in TeXLive 2008, which I installed today on a spare machine (but it's going to have to be uninstalled again as I've lost access to the TL manager GUI).

Below I repeated the two messages I posted to the TeX-Live user group (messages separated by %%%%%%%). 

Can you advise?  (Or repair if it is indeed a bug.)

Many thanks


John Was


MESSAGES:

Following Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard's helpful message of 9 November, I've finally got round to installing the 2008 distribution of XeTeX on a spare computer running Windows XP Pro (jealously guarding my 2007 installation until I'm sure all is OK).  Immediately after installation I typed
 
tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

But at the next line of Manuel's instruction, viz.:
 
tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra
 
the routine fails, producing the following error message on screen:
 
 
Cannot read any package from http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb, seems not to be a TLPDB! Cannot load Tex Live database from http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
 at c:/program Files/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl line 616
 
And thus I never get to the third element of Manuel's instructions, viz.:

tlmgr update --all

I've tried it a couple of times, and the same error is produced.  Is it a bug, or do I just give up and go over to a Mac? (!)  I would certainly like to be able to acquire the latest version painlessly, whenever a new element is added that would be of use to me.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I've now uninstalled XeTeX from the machine and reinstalled it, this time 
trying the GUI to update the installation from the Web.  This fails too: 
everything works as expected until the last step, when the GUI puts up a 
message to say that some elements have to be updated by closing the GUI down 
and running the batch file updater.bat.  But alas, that results in an error 
message, and after that point it's impossible to access the TeXLive Manager 
at all - it simply aborts.  I've done this twice now, so it wasn't a chance 
fluke.

Thus, it seems that currently there is no reliable way to update the 
installation on a Windows XP machine - though no doubt some packages could 
be updated manually without doing damage, simply by replacing an older 
version of the relevant files with an updated one.  But this is clearly not 
very satisfactory.

I have installed tex-live 2008 from the dvd-image and it is working
perfectly. However, the included install-info which is located-linked
in /usr/local/bin overrides the existing install-info. the first package
whose installation/update was rendered defect was auctex. 

I moved the /usr/local/bin/install-info to _install-info and everything
is o.k.

Is this program really necessary on a linux system?

This is rather vague -- how were you installing auctex?   Doesn't
auctex use GNU install-info?  Did you set INSTALL_INFO to the

It really should be called something like ginstall-info.  There are many GNU
utilities whose names conflict with tools that already existed before the GNU
versions came along.    Installers could check for such issues, e.g.,
which "install" program is the GNU version, or is it called "ginstall", but
as long as there are bugs to be fixed, I'd prefer that developers work on
those, and just let me use INSTALL_INFO to direct configure to the right
binary.

I use "<drive>:/texlive/2008" -- many TeX tools have problems with
spaces in paths, so even if most things work, there is still a chance
that some obscure tool will break (and Murphy says it will happen 5
minutes before some critical deadline).

Some of your problems may be also due to using an older version of the
installer.

It has been working  for me, but I have a local mirror or the
tlnet/2008 directory
that gets updated each night, so I avoid network-related glitches.   I had many
failures trying to install from CTAN via internet.

The install-info from TeX Live is the original one. You are using Debian
or Ubuntu and we (I am also Debian developer) ship another install-info
script.

We are working on replacing the install-info from dpkg with the one from
texinfo, but until this time you need to make sure that the install-info
from /usr/bin is found FIRST on Debian/Ubuntu systems, otherwise
installation will not work quite often.

And yes, the program is necessary.

I think the reason debian didn't change the name is that Jackson's version
came first, so it is considered "original".  On Ubuntu (8.10) Jackson's
install-info is found in /usr/sbin, and there is also /usr/bin/ginstall-info.

This problem is a very old debian bug #18567 -- the decision
then was "wontfix" because the administrator is responsible for
ensuring that dpkg is called with the appropriate PATH setting.

I haven't encountered any problems with dpkg finding TL's GNU
install-info on my Ubuntu systems, where I generally use "sudo
aptitude...".  Ubuntu's default is for sudo to use "env_reset", so
it doesn't blindly pass on the user's PATH:

$ which install-info
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/install-info

but:

$ sudo which install-info
/usr/sbin/install-info

Hi, all,

I just updated my tlmgr and later I use "tlmgr update -all" to update the whole texlive, however I got something not working here: when I want to use this command * tlmgr --help*, the cmd window returns the error message "????????????" which means "the system fails to locate the called drive" (forgive me I'm not a good translator.) Just pure guess: is tlmgr trying to locate the dvd drive by which I installed my texlive 2008?

Thanks all.

Please do the following:

1) install completely normally from DVD

2) get http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
   and run it

3) call
	tlmgr option location ctan
   or directly selection your mirror, eg
   	tlmgr option location http://your.mirror.ctan/path/to/tlnet/2008

4) call
	tlmgr update --list

   	tlmgr update --all

That is not true. I am the current maintainer and we are already long on
the way (thanks to texinfo development helping a lot) on forgetting
Debian's install-info and replacing it with the GNU one. This will
happen after lenny is released (I hope).

Actually I doubt that. Before the update my *tlmgr --help* works well. And 
even
now *tlmgr --help* doesn't work, the command *tlmgr update -all* still works 
fine.

but did you instruct tlmgr to use the internet instead of the DVD

In case of problems we always recommend gettting
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
and running it.

After that please run 
	tlmgr update --all

It could be that --help does not work due to the fact that you have
another perl installation which creates problems here. We are working on
that.

--list  is just for listing forthcoming updates, not actually updating. Alt:
tlmgr update --all --dry-run   does the same

It was once with me when tlmgr gone rogue. You need to reinstall some
(all) collections

I suggest to run
tlmgr list|grep "^i"|wc -l   (on UNIX, not sure about Windows
equivalents). If you have full-install the answer should be 1794 as of
today.

in ealier version, if you did not have perldoc, it listed the source 
code of tlmgr if one ran

tlmgr --help

works fine when perldoc is installed.

Yes, I instruct tlmgr to use the internet to update. The error message comes 
from the Windows system, not from tlmgr. The message means roughly: "the 
system fails to locate the called drive."

This what I get rinning that command:

tlmgr: installation location
http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/tex/systems/texl
ive/tlnet/2008
update: dry run, no changes will be made
Fundamental package texlive.infra not present, that is sooo bad.
Serious error, texlive.infra not found at
c:/Users/goossens/texlive/2008/texmf/s
cripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl line 2301.

So I seem to be missing the famous texlive.infra file, although latex
and friends are working. 
Can I get it from somewhere or do I have to reinstall everything from
scratch?

It looks like you have updated long ago before this. Start from

% tlmgr install bin-texlive texlive.infr


Then

%tlmgr list collections

Then one-by-one

%tlmgr install <collection>


controlling via

%tlmgr list|grep "^i"|wc -l

HTH


PS I described this recovery (for Mac/UNIX: used in x64_linux) at the bottom

http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=TeX_Live_Manager

However, now it tells me during 2 months that many packages I have are
newer than on CTAN. Spooky!

Why not offer binaries ?  Documentation might be in PDF, Word, PostScript,
DVI, or who-knows-what : so long as one doesn't launch executables or
scripts, why not allow anything else ?

amusingly, the only aaareadme (any case) on ctan is in lsedit, and
appears as various things including .dvi and .txt, but not without
extension ;-)

so presumably (given that tex live doesn't cover vms systems), there are
no aaareadme files to consider, at all.

README, otoh, does sometimes contain stuff worth reading, and does seem
sometimes to appear in tex live.

aWell, instead of restricting to a certain extension (maybe there are
files without an extension...), it would make more sense IMHO to check
whether the contents of the file is binary or text, only adding the

Hum, what you suggest means not only adding extensions but also looking
outside the doc tree. While I have no technical objection to that, I
doubt it is really texdoc's purpose: I mean, there's "doc" in the name...

I'm aware that some will disagree, but I strongly think source code is
not proper documentation. I also tend to think that people who are able
to learn for reading the source are also able to find it themselves.

By the way, finding the source is a lot easier than finding
documentation: file names are (meant to be) unique in in the runtime
trees, and kpsewhich is the perfect tool to find them. Moreover, you
almost always now the name of the .sty file. When I really want to look
at a source, I have a very simple shell alias that locate it using
kpsewhich and opens it in my favorite editor.

I'm not saying a TeX source explorer wouldn't be useful, esp. if someone
manages to implement features ? la ctags, I just don't think it's
texdoc's job.

Manuel.

PS: cc-ing the texdoc list, and encouraging everyone interested to
continue the discussion there, in order to keep the TL-list clean. (No
need to subscribe, of course.)

Well, I can see a lot of txt files in the doc tree of CJK. Doesn't one
of those document the commands from CJKnumb? I'd rather add an alias
cjknumb=<some txt file>.

Concerning the sentence, I'm not sure because I'd like to keep the "not
found" text as short as possible (as well as any other text) because
long texts are less likely to be read. Also, in an ideal world texdoc
wouldn't have to display the sty files, so I'm not very enthusiastic in
advertising this feature too much.

Btw, the "null extension" is in the list of default extensions,
precisely for the sake of the readme's. I have no example at hand where
the readme is the first or only result, but eg:

mpg at roth:~% texdoc -s xargs
1	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xargs/xargs.pdf
2	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xargs/xargs-fr.pdf
3	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xargs/README
Please enter the number of the file to view, anything else to skip:

finds the readme. However, I'm a bit afraid the README won't display
properly on windows, since without extension, the "start" command won't
be able to determine the correct viewer.

While we're at it, if you want to test and maybe suggest a proper way of
displaying readme's, your input would be welcome (I have no windows
machine at hand currently).

Manuel.

No.  The forthcoming CJK version will contain a proper doc file. :-)

Hmm, here we disagree, it seems.  I consider this a very useful
feature, and I would like to make users of texdoc aware that they can
try this also...

Yep, that's the most likely reason. Now, as long as there's no fix the
affected Windows users, and if you really need --help, we'll have to do
things by hand, until an official fix comes in:

1. Open ...\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl
2. At line 137, replace

  if (TeXLive::TLUtils::which("perldoc")) {
    pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2);
  } else {
    pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2, -noperldoc => 1);
  }

with

    pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2, -noperldoc => 1);

And then, until the next update, you'll be able to use --help. It's not a
nice thing to do, hacking the tlmgr source code like this, but hacking the
tlperl files or removing perldoc feels even worse.

Hi Michel,

    skipping forcibly removed package texlive.infra

I cannot imagine how this came about, but I'm not sure it's going to be
possible to recover in any reasonable way.  The only kludge I can think
of is to add the attached text to your tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb file --
presumably it is complaining because they are missing.  

If this doesn't work, reinstalling seems like the only option.  Sorry.

Best,
Karl

Destroyed texlive.tlpdb is the only thing I can imagine. He is
mentioning that quasi all packages are llisted as
	forcibly removed
so I have only one explanation ...

Anyway, I have asked him to update with update-tlmgr-latest.exe/sh and
then call
	tlmgr -v update --list
and send me the output, I hopefully can find something reasonable in
there.

Best wishes

    but invoking mirrors in tlmgr I get either uwaterloo or ottawa

    I am confused :-(

This all seems normal to me.

I had forgotten that both mirror.ctan.org and mirrors.ctan.org were
defined to the same thing.  Our code only has special cases for
mirror.ctan.org; that's why you see the uwaterloo or whatever when using
that url.  I guess we should also check for mirrors.ctan.org, but
meanwhile, use mirror.ctan.org and be happy.

As for theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca, that is Randy Kobes' machine where the
multiplexer runs.  The original request always goes to Winnipeg; the
purpose of the multiplexer is to return an HTTP redirect to the real
CTAN mirror.

It is not always easy to know if some 3rd party app has installed perl, so it
is just possible that you have another perl without knowing.  There are
several systems <http://use.perl.org/~bart/journal/34795> that package
perl apps in a way that may disguise the fact that perl is being installed.

I'm not sure how you would rule out such things -- but it might be worth
checking for "PERL" in the environment and scanning your disk for
perl.exe.

Karl,

Unfortunately, adding this perldoc.bat makes the problem worse. Now *every*
Windows user will have the problem, not just those that have a secondary
Perl installation. The x: drive thingy is in tlperl/lib/Config.pm; which is
reset with every update of tlperl, so since my latest tlmgr update, --help
is hosed again:

If I add 

       print $progpath . "\n";

just before the system call to perldoc in tlperl/lib/Pod/Usage.pm, I get

	X:\perl\bin\perldoc

So the fix is not a new perldoc shim, but a correct Config.pm (or a
different incantation of perldoc in pod2usage).

Subject: [tex-live] TL in portable mode on Windows
Message-ID: <e7fba2610812200955k766ecce5s8d1190a296059001@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to figure out a way to prepare a portable installation of TL2008
and I'm having some trouble with this. I know that TL2008 can be run live
from DVD and it even comes with a batch launcher for that purpose, which is
really welcome, but it's a whooping 2.5GB with kitchen sink included, so I'm
looking for a slimmer solution.

Let me first explain what I'm trying to achieve and then I'll describe some
of the issues I encountered in my poking around so far.

I want to find a way to turn TL into fully functional (i.e. with working
tlmgr, etc.) portable distribution that (optionally) integrates with
PortableApps. By finding a way I mean a procedure that could be easily
followed by a boarder range of users (read: all those windoze illiterates
out there) so it shouldn't be too arcane. Preferably, this procedure should
allow for a full or at least partial automation of the process, so it can be
canned for regular users.

I have a fairly good idea how this could be done but there seem to be some
limitations in the current installer and I don't know how to get around
them.

The first problem is that there seems to be no way to make administrative
installation on Windows (i.e. without any system integration, like shortcuts
or uninstaller). Is that right?

Next, upon installation, TL breaks any other TeX installation on the system
by removing it from the path. Although this is documented (
http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html) I still consider it a bug to
interfere with other software on the system without explicit user consent.
It's essentially as bad as changing file associations without asking (not
that uncommon on Windows, I'm afraid). Furthermore, during uninstallation
the original path is not restored and user has to fix it manually.

My attempt to run tl-portable.bat script (copied from live .iso) from the
root of installed TL failed because some installer files were missing (the
installation itself was functional). I could probably track down the missing
files but I will leave it for later (if anybody knows which files are
missing, it will save me some forensic work). Bypassing

"%TEXDIR%tlpkg\installer\perl" "%TEXDIR%install-tl" --portable

in tl-portable.bat seemed to do the trick for now. As far as I can tell from
skimming through the installer source, calling it with --portable switch has
no effect unless there are some texmf trees missing, in which case they are
generated. In fact, only TEXMFSYSVAR is tested for existence, if I read it
correctly (note: I don't know perl). This test could be moved into the
launcher script itself to make it run faster (more on that below).

tl-portable.bat could be useful not only for launching TL shell but also
other tools, e.g. text editor or compilation script. Unfortunately, in its
current form this not possible. I would suggest the following modification
near the end of tl-portable.bat:

:doit
path %TEXDIR%bin\win32;%path%
if [%1]==[] goto :tlshell
%*
exit /b %errorlevel%

:tlshell
set PROMPT=TL $P$G
%COMSPEC% /k

Without any arguments tl-portable.bat will work almost exactly as before
(the only difference is that 'exit' after '%COMSPEC% /k' has been removed -
there is no need for it). With arguments, the supplied command line will be
executed instead of starting cmd shell. For example:

tl-portable.bat pdflatex <file>

can be used for portable compilation with pdflatex (or in configuration of a
text editor). For that purpose it would be also important to avoid calling
Perl installer if not necessary as mentioned above and also to preserve the
current working directory from the calling process. Currently
tl-portable.bat (and install-tl.bat as well) starts like this:

rem TeX Live Root; ends with backslash
rem This should also work with UNC names
set TEXDIR=%~dp0
set tldrive=%~d0

%tldrive%
cd %TEXDIR%

Despite what the comment says, this code will fail with UNC paths. This is
because '%~d0' will expand to '\\' and furthermore cmd.exe does not allow
UNC path to be used as a current directory (it will fallback on %WINDIR% if
launched from network drive). This creates some problems. Under restricted
account %WINDIR% is not writeable and launcher will behave as if run from
DVD (i.e. it will use %USERPROFILE%). For admin user TL will generate files
in the system folder.

I don't see anything in tl-portable.bat or install-tl.bat that would require
changing the current directory (except for perhaps the Perl installer - I
couldn't deduce that from the source). Thus, it should be OK to either
remove that part all together or change it only for the Perl installer. I
tested both scripts without changing cw and launching them from other
location than TL root. In both cases all appeared to function properly (I
could compile sample files without problems). So, it would seem that
changing the current directory is not required, but I cannot say that with
certainty based on my limited testing.

To play it save, below I suggest a modification with pushd/popd commands
combo. This will temporarily map network location onto a drive letter if
necessary. The possible drawback is that if for some reason the script would
terminate before popd is reached, the drive will have to be unmapped
manually.

if exist %TEXMFSYSVAR%\ goto doit
pushd "%TEXDIR%"
set PERL5LIB=%TEXDIR%tlpkg\installer\perllib
"%TEXDIR%tlpkg\installer\perl" "%TEXDIR%install-tl" --portable
popd
if not errorlevel 1 goto doit
echo Initialization of TeXLive failed!
pause
exit /b %errorlevel%

Note that this also incorporates the TEXMFSYSVAR test to speed up the
launcher. With this change the initial part of the script can be removed
(except for 'set TEXDIR=%~dp0' line). Another difference with respect to the
current script will be that the welcome banner will not be displayed anymore
(this is done by the perl script but it can be easily fixed, e.g. by putting
welcome message in an external file and calling 'type banner.txt').


To summarize this already long post: I think I can manage to resolve most of
the issues on my own; the only thing I don't know is how to tell TL
installer to skip system integration. I could probably write a script that
runs installer, copy files and uninstalls TL but: (a) I don't know if TL
will work portably without any side effects in this manner and (b) it would
be a real kludge and I would have to watch for things like messing up
MiKTeX, so I'm not very keen on that.

I hope someone can help me to find some solution. I'm happy to contribute
any changes upstream if desired and I can offer my help in batch scripting
and automation on Windows. Unfortunately my Perl knowledge is very limited,
so that rules out any but trivial changes to the installer on my part.

Cheers,

Tomek

Subject: [tex-live] Small bugs in install-w32client
Message-ID: <494D4EB3.4010001@freemail.gr>

Using a dual boot (Linux/Vista) system, I tried the following setup:
 - Installed TeXLive 2008 normally in Linux, but in a folder visible 
from Vista (as C:\texlive). I chose both Linux and Win32 binaries to be 
installed.
 - From Vista, run 'install-w32client.bat' to perform something like a 
"network" installation in Vista.
My aim was to have a shared installation between Linux and Windows, in 
order to minimize maintenance effort (packages will be installed once 
and visible from both operating systems).

Here are the problems that I found:

 - The documentation does not mention that 'install-w32client' and 
'install-w32client.bat' must be copied in the '2008' folder, which 
results in an error when running 'install-w32client.bat'. I only found 
the solution by opening the '.bat' file, which mentions the correct 
position of the files. So either add this to the documentation or make 
the scripts work correctly from their initial location.

 - Regarding the shortcuts created, the link to the documentation is 
wrong: it points to a non-existing 'live.pdf' whereas it should point to 
'texlive-en.pdf'

- Again regarding the shortcuts, the link to "Texdoc GUI" (texdoctk) 
does not work. The simple solution is to set the "startup folder" 
parameter of the shortcut to the folder where 'texdoctk' resides (the 
2008\bin\win32 folder).

 - The documentation is not correct about dviout. If the package 
bin-dviout is installed, the program is readily available in Windows; 
unfortunately it needs to be run manually for the first time, then 
select its "Install" command in order to create Start Menu shortcuts and 
file associations -- maybe this could be done by 'install-w32client'.

And one final question, in case one knows or has tried a similar setup: 
would it be considered safe to run tlmgr from Windows? For now, given 
that the initial installation was done from Linux, I only run tlmgr from 
Linux as well, in order not to break the installation...

After texdoc has failed why not try a full-text search using a tool
like Apple's spotlight, beagle, namazu2, strigi, tracker, recoll, etc.?

You've missed the point: `texdoc CJKnumb.sty' works as expected!  But
it isn't announced properly that you can use texdoc to find files in
the texmf tree outside of the documentation directories (and Manuel
wants this non-announcement).

I was completely unable to reproduce this problem under w2k. I
installed ActiveState Perl before running the net installer; I let
the installer add Perl to the searchpath and create file
associations,  and I created a PERL5LIB environment variable and
added .PL to PATHEXT for good measure.

The path in Config.pm shouldn't matter.

Maybe a superfluous remark: all the various programs in TeX Live are
meant to be found via the searchpath. Under Windows, Perl scripts
should never be called directly but always via a wrapper script on
the searchpath.

Other than that, I don't know what the hell is going on.

if the only documentation is the package file itself, i would consider
it undocumented.  (which is why i'm slightly ambivalent about donald
arseneau's arsenal of otherwise useful stuff.)

what actual use would be served by making cjknumb.sty available to the
ordinary user?

That seems a somewhat jaundiced view.  Some authors
take great care to make their code self-documenting.
(I seem to recall my "Cropmarks.tex" [1] was just such).

Perhaps little (I've looked at it); but surely Werner
is not asking for CJKnumb to be special-cased, but rather
that "the ordinary user" (modern-day English for /hoi polloi/ ?)
be always offered the .sty (or <whatever>) file if
no explicit documentation exists.

Nor me.

If the .sty file contains documentation, it will be easier to target in a
full text search.    The same people who might really want to read
an undocumented .sty file are probably quite capable of running
something like:  "$ less $(kpsewhich <whatever>.sty)".    There are
many capable full-text indexing systems, although they may differ
in how TeX sources are handled (are TeX markups included in the
index?) so there is not much advantage in adding things to texdoc that
can be done nearly as well by tools already being maintained by others.

The installer doesn't offer this option. However, you can copy an
installed TeX Live directory elsewhere and run it by just prepending
TeX to the path and defining some environment variables.  The path
and the environment variables could be done by some variation of
tl-portable.bat. Since no files need to be generated, the Perl
invocation can be skipped.

This is a limitation of TeX. Some components may work when invoked
with an absolute path, but in general the TeX binaries should be on
the searchpath. Restoring the original path is pointless because
there is no way of knowing what has happened to the path in the
meantime.  Simply prepending TeX would have been more conservative,
but has drawbacks of its own.

tl-portable gets around this by only changing the searchpath inside
the shell that it starts up.

What would be the point? You can run these editors and scripts from
within the TL shell. Since we are talking about writable media, you
can create customized copies of tl-portable.bat all you want.

My advice:

- install TeX Live to some temporary location
- copy the installation to a pendrive
- uninstall TeX Live
- re-add MikTeX to the searchpath. I think that is enough to restore
  MikTeX.
- modify tl-portable.bat to skip the Perl code and not to change
  directories
- optional: create variations to this batchfile for starting editors
  etc.

But I am not quite sure whether package management would work in
such an installation.

I think a script to create a portable pendrive installation from an
existing installation might be useful.  However, offering too many
options at installation time would make it hard to explain and would
do more harm than good.

As to UNC paths: you are right that in most situations UNC paths
don't work.

The UNC comment, the directory change and the final exit have been
removed from tl-portable.bat.

Well I have Windows XP, and no ActivePerl installed. The only Perl I have is
tlperl. And tlperl/bin is not in my search path, but still tlmgr seems to
find a perldoc (namely tlperl/bin/perldoc.bat). 

When I change Config.pm to use the correct `scriptdir' path to tlperl/bin
instead of the default value x:\perl\bin, `tlmgr --help' suddenly works.
(Removing tlperl/bin/perldoc.bat also solves the problem.)

So it definitely is Config.pm that's causing a problem with up perldoc. At
least with my installation.

Do you mean that tlmgr --help works even with an unpatched Config.pm
as long as there is no tlperl/bin/perldoc.bat?

since most packages have been created from documented source using
docstrip, they contain almost no comments other than licence details.

thus, in most cases, the source is useless as documentation to all but
cognoscenti.  and the cognoscenti are unlikely to have any difficulty
finding the source files.

what's binkerton?  why is it so secret that you're the only person who
knows about it?  aren't you going to be in trouble letting the secret
out (particularly in a forum that includes people who work on ctan)?

Right... This now works for me as well (I mean, without setting the 
startup folder for the shortcut). Strange...

Another somewhat related issue: When trying to view some pdf 
documentation from texdoctk, Acrobat 9.0 displays "Unknown error" (!) 
and crashes. This happens in both my (very similar otherwise) 
installations, one on XP and the other on Vista. However, viewing the 
same documentation through a command-line invocation of texdoc works 
correctly!... Any hints, or where I should look for the relative 
invocations of Acrobat?

Are you speaking only of LaTeX packages, or of
TeX packages in general ?

I disagree, as I disagree with George N White III, 'though
I haven't replied directly_ : just because one can read
and write TeX macros doesn't mean that one understands
(e.g.,) "kpathsea" and its friends [1] ...  They are as
different as chalk and brie de meaux.

No idea : I simply did a Google search for my Cropmarks.TeX sources.

What would be those drawbacks? I can think of two situations on Windows:
1) admin account - in this case you can always ensure that TL is found
first on the path
2) restricted account - you have access only to the user path, so if
there is another tex on the system path, it will overshadow TL but
there is nothing you can do about it

I think it would be much cleaner to simply ask user what to do if
there is another TeX distribution detected. I was quite surprised to
find MiKTeX not working after TL uninstallation. Also, the link I gave
is the only place I found any mention about this - documentation says
nothing about this behaviour.

I doubt anybody would like to start their editor from the command
prompt (we're talking about win users here). But if you think those
changes aren't useful I can make a customized launcher for that, no
problem.

As I already said I'm not very keen on that idea because it is likely
to be messy to automate it. But if there will be no other choice I

That would be a real pity. The only way to update would be then to
repeat the whole exercise from the start. And that would update
everything. Is there anything in tlmgr that would not work portably,
like absolute paths or writing some system specific configuration?

> I think a script to create a portable pendrive installation from an

My thoughts exactly. A lot of users would welcome possibility to use
TeX on the go. Live DVD doesn't cut it mainly due to its fixed nature,
size and no integration with editing tools.

But we are talking here about one tick box at most. On *nix systems
installer doesn't perform any integration at all. It is only on
Windows that installation and system integration have been made
inseparable.

I would even argue that such a change would make the installer easier
to maintain. I've learned from another thread about install-w32client
script that can be used for an existing TL installation. This script
essentially duplicates some code from the installer. Why not just
invoke install-w32client after TL installation? Wouldn't that be
simpler and easier to maintain?

I might be even tempted to give it a go and try to do such a
refactoring of the installer. My only question is: would such a change
be accepted (in the rather unlikely event that I would succeed)? The
last think I would like is to end up with a privetly held fork of the
official installer, so if don't like that idea, I won't even try.

Thanks for those changes. I would further suggest to either abort or
fallback on %USERPROFILE% in case of running from UNC location to
avoid writing to %WINDIR% on admin accounts.

rem TeX Live Root; ends with backslash
set TEXDIR=%~dp0

rem TEXDIR writable?
set TEXDIRW=%USERPROFILE%\.tlportable2008\
if %~d0==\\ goto wrtestdone
del "%TEXDIR%tl_wrtest" 2>nul
echo Testing for write access %TEXDIR%...
echo Hello >"%TEXDIR%tl_wrtest"
if not exist "%TEXDIR%tl_wrtest" goto wrtestdone
del "%TEXDIR%tl_wrtest"
set TEXDIRW=%TEXDIR%
:wrtestdone
if not exist "%TEXDIRW%" md "%TEXDIRW%"

I only added 'if %~d0==\\ goto wrtestdone' line to bypass writeable
media test in case we are running from the UNC path.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi Nikos,
are you using the stuff from the DVD?  Maybe it makes sense to replace
texdoc by a newer version.

You have to update the files:

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/tl-w32-texdoc-wrapper.texlua
  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/texdoc.bat

No idea why Acrobat issues the "Unknown error" message on some Windows
systems but not on others.  It would be nice if the Windows gurus on
this mailing list could reproduce this error, but it's obviously not
reproducible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yep. The problem is that *if* there's a perldoc somewhere (according to
TeXLive::TLUtils::which) pod2usage results in calling perldoc with the
scriptdir in Config.pm (pod2usage simply combines $Config{scriptdir} with
"perldoc" without checking if it exists). That's causing the problem,
because most people don't have a perldoc at x:\perl\bin.

And if no perldoc is found, pod2usage is called with a -noperldoc argument,
so no external program is called. So the problem isn't really with perldoc:
it isn't even executed as it can't be found. 

That's also why various language versions of the error message crop up for
different users: it's the OS telling you that somehow perldoc can't be
found, it's not Perl telling you this. And depending on whether you have an
x: drive, and whether it's mounted, you'll get a different message that's
supposed to make sense, if you know what the OS is told to do in the first
place.

No, I installed directly from the Internet during last week. As I see on

CTAN and TeX Live pretty much have to work with what authors choose
(or chose) to provide. There will likely always be .tex files with embedded
documentation, and in any case it is not unreasonable to expect to
be able to find a particular source file and peek at it.

All this goes to show that no one of us really understands the
community of TeX users, so we can't be trusted to know how to
make sure users can find what they need.

At present, there are too many systems for managing documentation,
including unix man pages, texinfo, and texdoc.   If none of those produce
the information you are seeking, there are various full text indexing
systems and web searches.

Texdoc provides a convenient interface to the documents that those
"people (who care about documentation)" have kindly provided, but
now we are talking about how hard texdoc should work to support
cases where the documentation is embedded in the .tex files, or
perhaps the .tex documentation has not been formatted due to
oversight or because it relies on fonts, etc. that are not part of
TL  (case in point is the tap package: tlmgr show --list tap).

As for using kpathsea to find file whose name is known in the
texmf-<whatever>/tex trees, there are also tools that find files
independent of TL.  "less $(kpsewhich ...)" is just one example.

Which doesn't work here :-)  These are the various iterations
of simplification through which I went before I could persuade
it not to issue an error message --

Sadly the potentially infinitely more useful

funny enough it works fine on a 32 bit RedHat AS 4, and running the

any ideas why the x64 version requires libXau while the i386 does not?

I can confirm that. I've updated TL (with 'update-tlmgr-latest.exe'
because tlmgr failed - but that's another story) and after that I've
got:

TL F:\Software\TL2008\TL>tlmgr --help
The system cannot find the drive specified.

Changing scriptdir to empty string in Config.pm resulted in:

TL F:\Software\TL2008\TL>tlmgr --help
'\perldoc' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

    Changing scriptdir to empty string in Config.pm resulted in:

I think you have to change that to the real scriptdir, not the empty string.

Meanwhile, I have deleted tlperl/bin/perldoc.bat.  So at least now we
should back to the point where only people with the other Perl installed
are affected.  If I'm following this right.

What I don't understand is why Siep is unable to reproduce the problem
*with* ActivePerl installed.  Siep, you did get a perldoc in your PATH
when you installed AP?  Or maybe it found the AP Config.pm instead of
the TL Config.pm?

Certainly, but the whole theory is that the Config.pm in tlperl is
supposed to be irrelevant.  Clearly it is for some people, and isn't for
others.  Sigh.

I expect it's a function of the system configurations on which the two
versions were compiled.  I made the i386-linux binaries on Debian sarge
which only has a static libXau (don't know if it was used).

Reinhard built the final x86_64-linux binaries, as I recall.  I don't

Since I last downloaded and ran update-tlmgr-latest.exe a few days

   tlmgr.pl: (make_container) size=1 not a file or directory

It does not seem (yet) to have caused any problems. Unfortunately,
the message gives no clue as to exactly _what_ is "not a file or
directory".

Not every package produces the message, but some some produce
it several times. "tlmgr --version" reports:

we'll be able to figure out what's causing it.

Anyway, the msg is indeed not harmful.  It occurs when making the

Really funny: updating on other computers (with 20 min interval: also
3 macs + 1 x64_linux) I did not get this message

Actually libXau is loaded by libX11.  The latter is loaded by
freetype.  ATM I have no idea how to get rid of this dependency.  My
simple approach was too naive:  I removed libXau from my system and
instructed Gentoo to calculate the reverse dependencies and re-build
all the necessary files.  It took more than two hours to re-compile
all the libs, ImageMagick, Gimp...  Well, all what happened is that
Gentoo installed libXau again. :(

What do you mean with "system configuration"?  Is there a particular
file you have in mind?  I suppose that a configure option set while
installing libX11 does the trick.

BTW, I'm away from internet from Dec 23 to Dec 26.

  Reinhard

Sorry to resurect this discussion but I would like to suggest a
solution to the file locking problem.

A typical approach to update locked files on Windows (including
currently running binary) is to launch a child process that waits for
the parent to terminate and then performs an update. This could work
as follows:

Perl script opens a file 'tlmgr.lock', launches 'selfupdate.bat' and
terminates. System will automatically release any open handles upon
process termination so there is no need to close 'tlmgr.lock'
beforehand.

The 'selfupdate.bat' waits until 'tlmgr.lock' unlocks and performs an
update. This could look something like this:

::BOF selfupdate.bat
@echo off
:wait
rem wait ~1sec
ping -n 1 -w 1000 1.1.1.1
rem check if lock file has been released
type nul>tlmgr.lock
if errorlevel 1 goto wait
del tlmgr.lock

rem here goes the update
call updater.bat

rem optionally restart tlmgr
tlmgr gui

rem kill yourself
del "%~f0"
::EOF

And that's about it.

Lock file could be also used to prevent multiple instances of tlmgr.
Right now this is not the case. I can't imagine any reason for
allowing multiple instances of the package manager.

Cheers,

Tomek

Well, I fear that perldoc.bat isn't the culprit at all.  Since this
little batch file doesn't change the environment, it doesn't matter
whether it's found in tlperl or any other Perl distribution.

It seems that removing the file is not enough.  Let's assume that this
problem occurs on Windows only. Then 

  if ($opt_help) {
    if (TeXLive::TLUtils::which("perldoc")) {
      pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2);
    } else {
      pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2, -noperldoc => 1);
    }
  }

should probably better be replaced by something like:

  if ($opt_help) {
    if (win32) {
      pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2, -noperldoc => 1);
    } else {
      if (TeXLive::TLUtils::which("perldoc")) {
        pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2);
      } else {
        pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2, -noperldoc => 1);
      }
    }
  }
    
Not a nice solution but I think that Windows users are hardened enough
in order to deal with this inconvenience.

It seems that there is a severe bug in Perl, though.

  Reinhard

Huh?  The FreeType library doesn't need libX11 at all.  Only its test
programs.

This is what I got when I compiled TeX Live with libXau removed from
my system:

Not a big deal, but it would be nice if

tlmgr update --all

instead of asking first to update bin-texlive texlive.infra, run
two-stage update

BTW, out of two twin packages which popped up at CTAN (td-clock and
analog-clock) only one came to tonight update? Is it because
analog-clock requires some font installation?

Hmm, I see that the `ftstring' binary (from FreeType?1) isn't part of
the TeXLive SVN, which is correct.  Is it actually built during a
normal TeXLive build?  In case the answer is yes, it should be
disabled.

Even for i686-pc-linux a straight "build" using the defaults on Ubuntu-8.10
gives:

$ ldd xdvi-motif xdvi-xaw
xdvi-motif:
 [...]
	libXau.so.6 => /usr/lib/libXau.so.6 (0xb7b1a000)
 [...]
xdvi-xaw:
 [...]
	libXau.so.6 => /usr/lib/libXau.so.6 (0xb7c8b000)
 [...]

I think libXau would be installed via package dependencies on most systems
that are used to run X applications, so the problem should be limited
to systems
that are configured without X11.

that might be it as the x64 server is only used via remote access over, 
say, ssh

should the x64 xdvi be rebuild? if it doesn't actually need libXau?

Well, libXau is the X11 authorization library, so it is generally linked by
any X11 application, even when using ssh tunnels.   Probably the reason
it took some months for this issue to surface is that it is quite rare to have
a system that runs any X11 apps without libXau getting installed.   I
assume there is some difficulty (e.g., "root" must be bribed) that prevents
just installing libXau from the vendor's packages, so here are a couple
suggestions:

0.  just don't use xdvi

1.  run xdvi locally, e.g., using NFS, sshfs, etc to mount the directory that
contains the .dvi files.

2.  it is not true that only root can install .rpm packages -- rpm can be used
to install packages in a user-selected location, but there are tricky
issues with
dependencies.  If you just need one library, you may be able to ignore the
dependencies

I am the superuser on the server, I just do not understand why this only 
effects the 64 bit version.

I can run the 32bit without problems on the same server, why does the 
64bit version need this whereas the 32bit does not?

because the 32-bit library is installed, but not the 64-bit library?

(i don't administer linux boxes per se, but it seems, second-hand, that
there are gaps in the libraries available for 64-bit operation.)

My CentOS 5 (based on RHEL 5) contains both 32-bit and 64-bit libXau,
no eed to install it separately.

I don't think there are many gaps in mainstream libraries such as
libXau, which has certainly been used for over a decade on 64-bit
hardware from Sun and SGI, so the work to implement a 64-bit version
was done long ago.  The remaining gaps are mainly 3rd party things
where the developer may not have access to a 64-bit machine, or
legacy code where there is nobody with the time or inclination to make
the changes.

Hi Lars,

    I can run the 32bit without problems on the same server, why does the 
    64bit version need this whereas the 32bit does not?

I already explained this.  The short answer is, run ldd.

When I compiled xdvi for i386-linux, I did so on Debian sarge and the
only libXau there is static.  Therefore it is not a dynamically linked
library to the executable.

When RK compiled xdvi for x86_64, he did so on a different (newer)
system that evidently uses libXau.so.  Therefore it is dynamically
linked.  Therefore anyone who doesn't have that .so cannot run the
binary.

Can't you just install some standard package on your system and get
libXau.so?  If you want to solve it right now, that is the only way.  We
are not going to distribute new binaries just for this, even if it was
easy to make new ones, which it isn't.

Based on Werner's message, to change the build will require someone
playing with the freetype link line and disabling the test binaries.  Or
something.  Don't hold your breath.  There's lots more important things
to do with the build.

Sorry,
Karl

    such file or directory at F:/TeXLive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm
    line 459.

This is the second report of "Can't spawn cmd.exe".  I don't know what
to say except that if cmd.exe cannot be spawned, everything is hopeless.  

It seems likely that we could work around it by doing things
differently, but I have no clue how.  Windows-savvy people are going to
have to work on it.

The actual command being run, as can be seen in the rest of what you
sent, is the tar command to make the backup of the package:

    f:/TeXLive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl:
    system(F:\TeXLive\2008\tlpkg\installer\tar.exe -cf

    in F:\TeXLive\2008, status 255 at
    F:/TeXLive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 463.

I don't know how to change that to alleviate the problem.  The Perl code
is as simple as it could be (from TLUtils.pm):

  my $retval = system(@args);
  if ($retval != 0) {
    $retval /= 256;
    chomp (my $pwd = `pwd`);
    die "$0: system(@args) failed in $pwd, status $retval";
  }

Another easy solution is to use:

$ rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/lib/libXau.so

for the installed (32-bit) library.  In most cases, the 64-bit library will
have the same basic name.

It should also be possible to use the 32-bit xdvi with your 64-bit
texlive.

    instead of asking first to update bin-texlive texlive.infra, run
    two-stage update

You mean, automatically do the update of the most critical packages
without even asking?  Sorry, I don't like that idea at all.
    
    BTW, out of two twin packages which popped up at CTAN (td-clock and
    analog-clock) only one came to tonight update? Is it because
    analog-clock requires some font installation?

Yes.  Specifically, as far as I could tell it requires the font to be
installed at the system level (not the TeX hierarchy), because it's used
from JavaScript.  (The reader's system, at that, not even just the
composer's system.)  We aren't prepared to do that across all platforms
and probably never will be.

    What do you mean with "system configuration"?  Is there a particular
    file you have in mind?  

No, all I meant was the kind of stuff you already messed with -- the
packages, dynamic vs. static libraries, etc.  I don't think you can
reasonably avoid it.

The only surprise is that Lars' system does not have libXau.so.  I
surmise he is using a different distro than Gentoo that sets up the X11
libs differently.  Dynamic libs are the bane of anyone trying to
distribute binaries, as we do.

that is what I am going to do, but come to think about it I don't think 
that server is installed without the X stuff (I didn't install it).

I did a locate on an 64bit and an 32bit RedHat AS 4

64bit:

/usr/X11R6/lib/libXau.a
/usr/X11R6/lib64/libXau.a

32bit:

/usr/X11R6/lib/libXau.a

there are no libXau.so on either system

I'm the only one using LaTeX on the 64 bit system. Heck, I'm also runnig 
32bit on my 64 AMD here at home.

I just wanted to report it in case other people had a similar problem.

I suggested this only for the switch --all in which case in "old time"
these packages were updated without asking.

Right, so, as expected, RH does it differently than Gentoo.  Not a
surprise.

This should possible to do, next time around.

Hum, the user asked 'update --all', didn't she ? So...

By the way, it was the previous behaviour with update --all. So what
Victor asks would only be to come back to this behaviour, except that
the order of updates made would be different.

Now, I'm not sure it is technically possible. First, maybe it would
imply too many changes in tlmgr's code. Second, on windows since we
can't change the tlmgr while it's running, you'll have to close and
rerun tlmgr anyway in order for the tlmgr update t be effective before
the other updates are done.

Karl:

I get this error only when there are a huge number of files going
into the backup file. The error message is always accompanied by
screen after screen of filenames. I think this might be due to
running tar with all the files listed on the command line. This
might result in buffer overflow and throw Windows into confusion.
The definition of make_container has the following comments
(TLPOBJ.pm):
   # Get list of files.  We have to pass them all on the command line,
   # because there is no portable way to pass them on stdin.  This can be
   # a lengthy command line, but modern systems have enough argv space.
   # our biggest package is tex4ht, which needs about 200k.

tar allows one to pass the list of files in an external file
(--files-from or -T). If the too-long list is the problem, that
would be a way to work around it.

The command line limit for cmd.exe is variously given as 8K characters
(on an interactive command line, before expansion) 16K (after expansion
or if cmd.exe is used non-interactively). There are other claimed
limits, the largest I ran across was 32K. The list of venturisadf files
is about 43K.

venturisadf and context both gave me this same error on update,
and a similarly large list of files in the error message. I ended
up updating both by hand, but setting option autobackup 0 might
work around the problem.

Dan

Subject: [tex-live] Problems updating TL on Cygwin?
Message-ID: <49520382.5090001@alice.it>

As you remember I use my build of TL on Cygwin.

Until today I have always updated TL without big problems. As work
around to the locking problem of tlmgr I adopted this trick:

cp tlmgr tlmgr1

./tlmgr1 -location...

and this worked like a charm.

Today, it refuses to update and says something like "...you should
update bin and infra package first" and trying this it prints some
message like

no available_architectures, continuing anyway ... at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlp
kg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 1239, <TMP> line 216619.
no available_architectures, continuing anyway ... at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlp

no available_architectures, continuing anyway ... at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlp
kg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 1239, <TMP> line 216619.

So I am in doubt if the update is right

(I doubt also that installing from scratch the current distribution, works)

Why, now, it says "no available_architectures" ? Usually it recognizes 
Cygwin as 'i386-cygwin'.


 From my point of view there is a regression here...

    Angelo.

That could be the cause, indeed. There is a hard limit for command
line size of 32K. This is the maximum size that CreateProcess API can
accept. But there are others as well: 2K if you use ShellExecute API,
8K for cmd.exe on XP (2K on win2000).

http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/10/56028.aspx
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/830473

What I don't understand is why the error says cmd.exe when the call
out is made to tar.exe? Does 'system' function in Perl automatically
adds cmd.exe at the beginning or what? I would expect that this is a
wrapper around CreateProcess API.

Anyway, it should be easy to test if this is what causes the problems.

So RH uses static linking for libXau on this platform.   One way to
handle this it
to make a libXau.so from the libXau.a, which may be as simple as:

$ gcc -shared -o libXau.so libXau.a

Since the OP survived the original error, nothing real bad is likely
to happen if xdvi dumps core. There is little loose in trying the
above hack, and it could be helpful to others.

In general, redhat produces binaries that work across more platforms,
in part because they tend to be conservative about innovations and
because their paying customers want minimum price/performance, so
RH needs to be careful with a platform's resources.

That is what we had before, kut unfortunately not all tars support these 
options.

Karl: I guess we have to do it that way: for unix we use your new very 
portable code, for W32 we are sure that tar supports -T and use it.

Since I am without workplace atm reading and writing emails from my palm 
(no svn there ;-) I cannot do it now, hopefully Karl can do it these days.

Merry Christmas to all those celebrating it

It is reasonable that "update --all" do as much work as is possible on the
first run, then notify user if more remains to be done.

On windows, users already have to run the post processing batch file.  Would
it work to add the "tlmgr [options] update -all" to this script if the original
invocation was for "update --all"?

I did not test and have no opportunity now. Also cannot find in tlmgr --help.
Assume that there is ready update to  bin-texlive texlive.infra, and I type

% tlmgr update foo

or

% tlmgr install foo

Would tlmgr request to update first bin-texlive and texlive.infra?

If this is a case then basically user has only two choices with tlmgr:

* to update bin-texlive texlive.infra,

* postpone all updates

I think, it should be explicitly mentioned in tlmgr --help

    Today, it refuses to update and says something like "...you should
    update bin and infra package first" and trying this it prints some
    message like

It's telling you to update the infrastructure packages.  I suggest doing so.

    Why, now, it says "no available_architectures" ? Usually it recognizes 
    Cygwin as 'i386-cygwin'.

I am not aware that we made any changes (yet) regarding platform
recognition.
    
    From my point of view there is a regression here...

Sounds like it, but I can't debug it, not having Cygwin.  I hope you can
figure out what's wrong and tell us.

--force
           If updates to the tlmgr itself (and the underlying
infrastructure) are present
           tlmgr will bail out and not perform the update unless this
option is given (or
           --list is given).

Yes, it is here (but not very explicitly)

I agree that it is more prudent to update tlmgr first (and actually
the recommendation to do this was circulated even before it wa s
enforced)

What I can say is that it did not happen with tlmgr.pl. timestamps 
19122008. (the current has t.s. 23122008)

Now it happens also installing from scratch: at the start of 
installation, after tyyping 'i', there is "no available_architectures, 
continuing anyway..."

Could it be a problem of TLPDB.pm (timestamps 20122008)? Indeed in my OP 
I see

no available_architectures, continuing anyway ... at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 1239, <TMP> line 216619

repeated four times.

Sure, it could be.  Anything could be.  Could you please try to debug it

better position to do so than me -- I'd just have to guess.

Anyway, I won't be able to look at this (or anything else) until next

Did you check that there is any functional change but the warning?

As far as I see there should be NO change at all.

Short explanation: I made a change that is correct in the sense that it
does the right thing, and gives more warnings if there are problems.

Before the _option_value("available_architectures") returned "" (the
empty string) if the key wasn't found. Now it returns undef if the key
is not found, which is the correct behaviour.

Now, in your case what happens: in TLPDB.pm in sub available_architecures
we call _option_value("...") and if it is defined we split it on
whitespace to get the list of available architectures.

If it is not defined then the list is set ot the empty list and the
warning is issued.

Before the change we returned the empty string, which is defined, so we
did split the empty string which returned the empty list.

So in both cases the list should be empty, the only difference should be
the *very*valid* warning that in your tlpdb the key 
	available_architectures 
is NOT set.

The best fix for you would be to edit the texlive.tlpdb with whatever
text editor so that in the block starting with
	name 00texlive-installation.config
there is a line
	depend available_architectures:i386-cygwin

That should fix the warning, but anyway everything else should have
worked as before.

Best

Norbert

And one should apply this fix every time, when updating? Uhm...

No, changing that will survive updates.

And, even if, that is the price to pay when using a not-supported
architecture ;-)

Ciao e tanti auguri delle buone feste

Hi Werner, 
I'm back in Hannover now.  Yes, the ftstring binary is built indeed.
According to Build/source/configure.in, FreeType?1 is still used by
ttf2pk.

It's quite easy to get rid of FreeType_1: ./Build --without-ttf2pk

However, it doesn't solve the problem.  xdvi-xaw still requires
libXau.  The problem is not FreeType related.  It's caused by libX11
and I don't see any simple solution.

libX11 loads libXau dynamically and libX11 is used by all programs
providing graphical output, such as xdvi, metafont, and so on.
Thus, we cannot simply remove the -X11 linker flag.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Karl,
I fear that all packages in this distribution expect that libX11.so is
statically linked against libXau.so.

I just uploaded libXau to tug.org:

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/libXau-x86_64-linux.tar.gz

$ tar -tzvf libXau-x86_64-linux.tar.gz 
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2008-12-27 01:19 libXau.so -> libXau.so.6.0.0
lrwxrwxrwx root/root         0 2008-12-27 01:19 libXau.so.6 -> libXau.so.6.0.0
-rwxr-xr-x root/root     10200 2008-12-27 01:19 libXau.so.6.0.0

The file is supposed to be extracted in /usr/lib64.  Feedback is welcome.

According to my reply to Werner, it seems that there is absolutely
nothing wrong with the TeX Live build system or the freetype setup.
As far as I understand the problem, it can't be fixed there at all.
It obviously is an X11 library issue, inaccessible by TeX Live's
autoconf stuff.

Regards,
  Reinhard

There is a difference between RHEL 4.x and 5.x, my CentOS 4.7 contains:

[root at centos ~]# find / -name 'libXau*'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXau.a
/usr/X11R6/lib64/libXau.a

but CentOS 5.2 contains:
[root at hroch486 ~]# find / -name 'libXau*'
/usr/lib64/libXau.so.6
/usr/lib64/libXau.so.6.0.0
/usr/lib64/libXau.so
/usr/lib/libXau.so.6
/usr/lib/libXau.so.6.0.0
/usr/lib/libXau.so
/usr/share/doc/libXau-1.0.1

I tried to build TL on CentOS4, it works, but I have not tried to
install it by tlmgr from yoour official source, I installed it only on
CentOS 5.2.

Hi all

I tried to update my texlive today, and again I came across some problem. I have updated my tlmgr to the latest version. When I type tlmgr update -all in my cmd window, it popped up some long error message. I can not even see the beginning of the error message. It's what I got from my cmd window.

What do you mean by "latest"?

So you are using some version of Windows.  There has been work on a couple
issues with Win32 -- in some cases the command line exceeded the limits in
some versions of cmd, and there were problems with perldoc.  I'd guess your
problem is from the over-long command line, but it would be good to have the
full output.

There can be delays getting updates to the mirror sites, so you should
provide the OS version you use and the versions of tlmgr and bin-tlperl.win32.

I have (running Ubuntu linux):

$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 11715 (2008-12-25 10:27:37 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2008
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008
texlive-20080903

You might also do:

$ tlmgr  show bin-tlperl.win32
tlmgr: installation location /opt/tex/texlive/svn/Master
Package:    bin-tlperl.win32
Category:   TLCore
Installed:  Yes
Revision:   11607

There seems to be a problem with bin-tlperl.win32 -- the version in
the svn Master
repository seems to be older than the svn version:

$ tlmgr --location /opt/tex/texlive/svn/Master update bin-tlperl.win32
tlmgr: installation location /opt/tex/texlive/svn/Master
bin-tlperl.win32: local revision (11607) is newer than revision in
/opt/tex/texlive/svn/Master (10656), not updating.

$ tlmgr show bin-tlperl.win32
tlmgr: installation location
http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
Package:    bin-tlperl.win32

Since this might be related to the long command-line bug you can
check the list archives for the details, and verify that your system
has the patch.  It is possible the fix didn't make it to the mirror site
you use.   To get the complete output you can use emacs:

 <http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/ressources/emacs/>

In emacs, open a shell using <Alt-X>shell and run tlmgr there.   You will
get a buffer that allows you to scroll back as far as you need.

I'm using vista sp1, and the lastest means the newest I can find on
ftp://ftp.riken.go.jp/. And the output of tlmgr --version is

C:\Users\fnsteed>tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 11693 (2008-12-23 01:22:06 +0100)

My output is:

Seems alright.

I'm a Emacs user, but I don't know how to use a M-x shell. Some more hint?

as already mentioned probably the error with overly long cmd lines.

Upgrade should have happened anyway, can you check that venturisadf now
has no pending updates?

Karl made a change, but I am not sure whether he pushed that out to the
mirrors, and my laptop is still in semi-broken state so I cannot check
easily.

Please check with
	tlmgr update --list
whether venturisadf is still there. If not then update has succeeded,
only the intermediate backup container wasn't made.

Best wishes

There have been changes in svn since the 23rd.  You can
look for newer versions on other mirrors.

If you press the <Alt> key and then "x" you should get the M-x prompt.
 Just type
"shell<CR>" and you should get a window with the cmd prompt where you can
enter commands.   I looked for a youtube video to show this, but
didn't find one.

Thanks, but I only need the "shell <CR>" part. Thanks again for your 
searching a
video.

Can you see any problem for this. I see a "pwd". I know that's a linux 
command, I installed a cygwin, I don't use it to update texlive. Does that 
matter?

This is the bug where the list of files to be archived using tar is too long
for the cmd input buffer.   There is a fix that was created just before
Christmas, so you need to watch for an update to tlmgr (or reinstall
using the latest version), maybe following the instructions for updating
in:

<http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>

You will also need to check the status of the venturisadf package on
your system.   Please post your results, as I encountered this bug
last week but have not had access to WInXP since then to investigate.

The package is called "doublestroke", so

$ texdoc doublestroke
texdoc info: doublestroke aliased to dsdoc.pdf

and dsdoc.pdf is opened in a viewer.


Since "dsfont.sty" is what you use in a document, it does make
sense for "texdoc dsfont" to providedsdoc.    Aliases
are defined in texdoc.cnf, and you can add a "local" version, e.g.,
<TEXMFLOCAL>/texdoc/texdoc.cnf

If I put the line:

alias dsfont = dsdoc

in texmf-local//texdoc/texdoc.cnf, then
$ texdoc -l dsfont
texdoc info: dsfont aliased to dsdoc
1	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/doublestroke/dsdoc.pdf
Please enter the number of the file to view, anything else to skip:

I assume aliases must be created manually, e.g., the tlmgr package
manager does not support adding aliases to the master texdoc.cnf
when a package is installed.  It would make sense to collect
useful aliases in texmf-local for periodic submission to the maintainer
of the main texdoc.cnf.

Absolutely.

Yes. If we could create them automatically, we would probably not need
them since they would be generated on-the-fly.

Submission doesn't need to be periodic, and indeed I appreciate every
submission, either here or on the specific texdoc list.

I'll add this alias soon.

[SVN rev. 11738]

While it is nice that

  texdoc fontinst

is aliased to `fontinstallationguide', it's not nice that I `fontinst'
isn't presented at all:

  texdoc -l fontinst
  texdoc info: fontinst aliased to fontinstallationguide
  1       TeXLive/Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide.pdf
  2       TeXLive/Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide.pdf
  Please enter the number of the file to view, anything else to skip: 1

I have to explicitly say

  texdoc -l fontinst.pdf

to get what I want.  This looks fishy...

Or you can get what you want with texdoc -A -l fontsinst, too, but I
agree with you that you shouldn't need to do so.

Currently there's nothing to do about it but remove the alias, which
would probably not be good either. I plan to add a new directive
'addalias' (or whatever its name) which would be like 'alias', but
instead of replacing the given name with the alias would look for both
of them. If everything (including my "real-life" work) is going as I
wish, I may have time to implement it next week.

Manuel.

Basically the former, but option -l should display all of them (as it
does if I explicitly ask for `fontinst.pdf').

Hmm.  Why inventing a new keyword?  Wouldn't it be sufficient if `-l'
first shows the aliased, then the non-aliased files?

Well, I thought in some cases it would be useful to "hide" other
results, when clearly only one result is relevant and more results would
only uselessly annoy people who use the mixed mode as their default mode.

Thanks a lot, my problem is solved. I updated my tlmgr using

Hi,

more testing, I just ran

tlmgr update --list

and got this line:

bin-tlperl.win32: local revision (11607) is newer than revision in 
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 (10656), not updating.

I've only touched the installation with tlmgr. So the question is 'why 
is the revision running backwards?', and how do I synchronize it again?

You're using mirror.ctan.org as source, which redirects to different
mirrors.  These mirrors might have different revisions, as they
synchronize at different times (today, mean mirror age is 6.3 days, but
median only 12 hours).

You might find it easier to add an explicit mirror as your source:
Choose one from http://www.ctan.org/mirrors

I know, but that is one of the problems with tlmgr, it might be an idea 
that it actually explicitly mention which mirror it is looking at.

I usually end up at

http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/

which has a list from 27 og december.

But I have no way of knowing if this is the mirror it is looking at for 
the update.

And explicitly specifying a mirror seems to contradict the idea of 
having  mirrors.

hmm, interesting.

Just tried a few other mirrors including dante.

They al give the same message about the revision of bin-tlperl.win32

Perhaps I should do a reinstallation.

On my system at home I have a list of the updates performed, but I 
cannot find one here.

i presume you used the same one that mirror.ctan chose?

in fact, _which_ mirror are you using?  (i.e., which did mirror.ctan
choose when you first used it?)

(would be nice if tlmgr wrote this instead of mirror.ctan....)

The command-line mode does:

$ tlmgr --location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
update --all
tlmgr: installation location ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

With the GUI, if I use "change" to select the default location
"http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008" then the actual
site is displayed as "Current installation source", in my case:

ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

The whole mechanism is fragile.

Currently, the mirror mechanism appears to return a geographically "close"
server, which has several problems:

1.  net distance can be very different.   From Nova Scotia the net distance
to Europe is often less than to sites in the US and "upper" Canada.

2.  peak usage hours -- if you are updating during working hours, it may be
better to use a mirror site on the other side of the world.   During working
hours I generally have problems attempting to connect to the mirrors in
Ontario.

With Red Hat's yum updater, the downloader will try a mirror (seemingly at
random), and if that is not responding, switch to another.  In
practice this leads
to a slow start (so not good if you just have a couple small updates) but you
tend to end up with decent download rates for large updates.    The system
has to be robust to  cases where the mirror is missing some of the updates.
This has taken years of work to get to a reasonably robust tool.

I use a local mirror of the tlnet/2008 directory, with a mirror chosen
"by hand",
but quite often the mirror site is either not responding or not
current.   Here is
the list of recent site I tried:

Sun Dec 28 23:15:00 AST 2008
location ftp://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
Mon Dec 29 09:46:02 AST 2008
location ftp://indian.cse.msu.edu/pub/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

This gave the same list for "update --list"  same as purdue.

Mon Dec 29 10:04:54 AST 2008
location ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

This added 8 updates that weren't found on the purdue or msu mirrors, but
on a normal workday the chances of being able to connect are slim.  Furthermore,
(using the CMS mirror) I also get the:

bin-tlperl.win32: local revision (11607) is newer than the revision in
ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 (10656), not updating.

More than 6 weeks ago tlmgr while updated directly from
ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical went amok and deleted half of
packages. Then I reinstalled all the collections and after everything
works normally except  of this kind of messages:

perltex.x86_64-linux: local revision (9317) is newer than revision in
http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 (8601), not updating.

(63 binary files in total and this goes from November 14; I am not
sure that the number does not decay).

So I run

update --list | grep -v "not updating"

for more readable output

The package bin-tlperl.win32 did indeed go backwards. There
was a version with a script perldoc.bat added. When that was
shown not to solve the problem (with tlmgr --help), an older
version was apparently reinstated. I don't think this has
anything to do with mirrors, only with the timing of previous
updates. I got the same messages on two different machines with
two different mirrors (both set to explicit mirrors, and not
mirror.ctan.org).

You can almost certainly ignore the message. But there
might be a way to force tlmgr to "reverse update" to the
current (earlier) version.

I actually reversed the update by hand, downloading and
unpacking the archive manually (and "updating" the texlive
package database with the following undocumented tlmgr
action
   tlmgr _include_tlpobj tlpkg\tlpobj\bin-tlperl.win32.tlpobj
) Caveat: I don't recommend that anyone do this.

sounds resonable.

The only reason I have win32 installed is that I can do a windows 
installation much faster by just packing my current instalaltion, moving 
it to the PC and unpacking it.

No it was removed and by that got the old version.

Certainly, not almost.

I will touch the tlperl .tlpsrc which will update the revision number.

Karl, do you agree?

Hi!

I have just instaled TeXlive 2008 (last night's rsync) on a Windows XP  
SP3 computer.

After installing it, I called getnonfreefonts-sys to install the fonts  
I have on my Unix machines, but strangely it fails.

On closer inspection I discovered that there is no unzip in texlive/ 
2008/bin/win32/.

Since this is not my computer it didn't have unzip in the PATH, well,  
it does now and erveryhting is fine.

Regards
Axel

Hi Axel,
there is http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/unzip.exe

Don't know what went wrong.

unzip is part of bin-wintools.win32 which in turn is part of  
collection-wintools.

Somehow this didn't get installed when doing a Scheme full install.

Now I have verified that all collections are installed.

Thanks for your quick response.

In my experience, Win/XP can unpack ZIP files using
Windows Explorer, which understands ZIP format (and
uses it for what it terms "compressed folders"); is
it clear to you why this did not work in your case ?

getnonfreefonts is a cross-platform script and expects a command-line
unzip(.exe on WIn32) that supports certain options.   WinZip has a
command-line addon but the options aren't compatible with those of
the open source unzip.  Is there a command-line interface for Windows
Explorer.

For the OP -- sometimes when a file fails to get installed it has been
blocked by some anti-virus tool -- it could be helpful to check your
event logs and anti-virus logs for clues.

The documented options are here :

	http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314853

but none suggests that ZIP-unpacking can be
accomplished from the command-line without
requiring further (Windows-style) interaction
with the user :-(  The nearest I can find is

	rundll32.exe zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall Install-TL.zip

but that still requires the user to instruct
Explorer to extract the files using the Windows
GUI interface ...

a new mactex overnight was the straw to break the camel's back of
cam.ctan.org's ctan partition; mirroring failed, and mactex has only
been completely restored in the last hour.

my apologies for this: it had _looked_ as if i had 1.5gbyte free on the
partition, but it appears i only had 500mbyte or so.  (the machine is
due for overhaul/replacement soon, so adding 16gbyte to the partition
should keep us going in the short term...)

getnonfreefonts depends on unzip.exe because it's too difficult to
support two different programs.  Of course, it would be nice if
software provided by the operating system can be used.  But most of
the zip files are not TDS compliant.  The old shell script extracted
the zip files in a temporary directory and then copied the extracted
files to the texmf tree.  A signal handler made sure that all
temporary files are removed when the program aborts before it's
finished.

The current version is written in Perl and supports Windows too.
Though it supports all the signals mentioned in the MS C runtime
library, almost none of them can be caught[1].  In order to avoid to
leave too many files in the temporary directory if the program aborts
unexpectedly, the program now extracts single files directly to the
destination directory, at least if the (non TDS compliant) zip file
cannot be extracted directly in a texmf tree.

This means that some advanced options of unzip are used.  A particular
zip file is not simply extracted "as is".

Files which are not TDS compliant always cause a lot of extra work.
Even if Microsoft would provide such a tool which doesn't depend on
the GUI, it would be a lot of work to support it if it doesn't have
the same options as unzip.exe and behaves exactly the same way.  

unzip.exe and wget.exe are very helpful when writing portable scripts.
Without them I doubt that the script would support Windows today at
all.  The fact that Windows isn't POSIX compliant makes it quite
difficult to write portable scripts.  However, getnonfreefonts is just
a wrapper and the real work is done by the script it downloads and
executes, currently called 'getfont2008'.  This script is completely
platform independent (thanks to unzip.exe and wget.exe), otherwise it
wouldn't be maintainable.

However, whenever Microsoft provides tools which can be run from a
script, let me know.

Regards,
  Reinhard

[1] AFAIK the signal handler is executed on Windows if you press ^C.
