    Unset environment variable $HOME

Thanks for the report.  I would guess that unsetting $HOME has many
undesirable effects, since it's supposed to always be available.

        checking for ANSI C header files... no

So the basic question is why that test failed.  I'm supposing MacOSX
10.5 really does have ANSI C headers, but maybe there is some bug in
them, such that Autoconf concludes otherwise.

Hans, if you look in the config.log file, you'll find the file that
configure compiled to do the test, along with the exact invocation to do
it.  Can you post that?

    I am not sure if this affects tex-live compilation: 

If STDC_HEADERS is not declared, then c-std.h will certainly default to
char; that's nothing new.  (You can also work around the problem with
-DALLOC_RETURN_TYPE=void.)  Perhaps I should change it to always use
void, since I rather doubt any systems we care about use char, these days.

So, in that alternative ... Hans, if you change line 57 of
kpathsea/c-std.h from
#define ALLOC_RETURN_TYPE char
to
#define ALLOC_RETURN_TYPE void
does compilation proceed?

Apart form that one niggle, texLive handled the absence of $HOME like a champ.  But $HOME was only absent during the install phase.  For everyday use, it will be set.  The other 70 programs in the same NFS directory (including bash, find, gcc, perl, etc.), were also installed in an environment with only three environment variables:  $BASE, $CC, and $LDFLAGS.

Hello,

What is the use of the -jobname? The info documentation says
     Set the job name to STRING, instead of deriving it from the name
     of the input file.
But what is the job name used for? Is there a documentation on that
subject somewhere?

This option is used for the fmt files generation, my austion is in this
context.

controls the name of the .dvi and the .log file

also sets \jobname, so any macro package which generates its own files
(e.g. latex .aux files, and so on) will use the revised name rather than
the name of the parent file.

yup.  what more do you need to know?

Plus, you can do all sorts of wonderful hackish things with it.  I
have some tex files that generate different output depending on the
value of \jobname.  For example, I like to typeset stuff for A5 paper,
but if \jobname has a value ending in "-a4", I put pairs of these A5
pages together to make A4 pages instead.  (My code does this by
modifying \shipout, but this has the unfortunate disadvantage that
\pagerefs don't work out right.  There may be other bad side effects
as well.)

Subject: [tex-live] mathdots
Message-ID: <477BA19E.6080800@polito.it>

Dear Sebastian, I think I found a bug in TL2007, a small one, really...

the tex/generic/mathdots/ folder contains only mathdosts.sty wich is
usable only by LaTeX; but the first statement check if the file is being
processed by LaTeX: if not, it inputs the TeX version mathdots.tex.
The bug is that mathdots.tex is in doc/generic/mathdots/ and this folder
is just for documentation, it is not on the (La)TeX search path.
I suppose mathdots.tex should be moved to tex/generic/mathdots/ but a
user who is operating on a Linux/UNIX/MacOSXbox (probably also on Win
boxes) might have difficulties because the textmf-dist/ rooted tree is
operable only by the administrator/superuserI did it on my Mac, but I
think it would be better with the next 2008 release to have TL
configured so as to put it in the proper place.

With a great Thank you and my best wishes for a Happy New Year!
Claudio

Hi Claudio,

    The bug is that mathdots.tex is in doc/generic/mathdots/ 

Thanks for mentioning it.  I think this is fixed for the next release --
in the current sources, mathdots.tex is in tex/generic/mathdots.

By the way, Sebastian mostly retired from TL a couple years ago,
regretfully.

    I have asked Cho.

Before I write ... do you recall any reply?

    [vtex.def]

Well, that is newer than the version that was in TeX Live, and it seems
there is no permission to distribute (let alone modify) it, and
unnecessary to do so anyway since anyone who wants it will have to get
vtex itself from somewhere else, and hence will have their preferred
file.  So I removed vtex.def from TL.

Thanks,
Karl

Apparently I never responded to that message (the date suggests it arrived  
in the middle of a two-week exam so I may have forgotten all about it).

Cho, perhaps you can bring us up to speed on graphics drivers related to  
(x)dvipdfm(x)?

Package: texlive-latex-recommended
Version: 2007-13
Severity:normal

Dear Dominique, dear Herbert, dear TeX Live team,

(Herbert:) thanks for the bug report, I have created a image of it in
the Debian Bug Database.

(TeX Live Team:) all for your information

(Dominique:) We got the following bug report which relates to the ucs
package. It seems that the mentioned sung bitmap font is not available,
while the arphic fonts are widely available and packaged for at least
Debian and Ubuntu (and for sure for many others, too).

Do you see any other problems with the approach taken below?

Would it be possible to include this in a new release of ucs?

(For Debian/Ubuntu:) I guess if we get a positive answer I will patch
this into the current TeX Live packages. Hopefully it will be fixed
upstream, too.

Thanks a lot and all the best in the new year

Norbert

Hi Edd, 

I have encountered the same problem (livetex + pscyr) in Ubuntu linux.
The problem is that pdflatex does not see the font due to incorrect 
pscyr installation.
To solve the problem, I used the following installation script:
(as root)


######################################


FTP=ftp://ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex/font-packs/pscyr/0.4d-beta/
#FTP=ftp://scon155.phys.msu.su/pub/russian/psfonts/0.4d-beta/

wget -c $FTP/PSCyr-0.4-beta9-type1.tar.gz
tar -xvzf PSCyr-0.4-beta9-tex.tar.gz
tar -xvzf PSCyr-0.4-beta9-type1.tar.gz 

cd PSCyr

cd to the directory where PSCyr is unpacked)
for a in tfm vf type1 afm; do
   cp -r fonts/$a/public/pscyr /usr/share/texmf-texlive/fonts/$a/public/
done
cp -r tex/latex/pscyr /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/
cp -r dvips/pscyr/ /usr/share/texmf-texlive/dvips/

mktexlsr

## the following is the key point to solve the problem being discussed:
echo -e "\n# PSCyr\nMap pscyr.map\n" >> /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg       
updmap-sys

################################################
This worked for me.
Note that the mentioned directory names 
may be specific for ubuntu distribution.

Ivan

In fact, this resulted in a catastrophy, because I can compile all my
old talks using
seminar.cls with some effort and must force now dvips to produce
landscape slides
(was not necessary earlier, and with pdflatex I haven't found any
solution yet,
i.e. there I can only obtain portrait format!!!),
but I also used the feature to bring up one part after the other on the
slides
and this feature results now in a crash of ghostview!!!

I tried now to switch to beamer.cls, but this resulted in missing
capital letters in the
middle of a sentence...

I reactivated now an old computer with teTeX and I will load down the
last version of
teTeX next weekend in order to be able to proceed working as efficiently
as before...

Greetings,
Gerald Kroisandt

send it to me in private.

Even strange. Please, send a test document (please don't forget any
necessary files) and I will check.

Yes, there is a plan -- to have it released by "summer" (that's in the
northern hemisphere :), hopefully in time for TUG 2008
(http://tug.org/tug2008).  Therefore I expect to start moving towards
the release by the end of March, since it always takes months to get it out.

How well we execute the plan this year remains to be seen ...

Subject: [tex-live] etoolbox, biblatex, latexdoc and source of docs
Message-ID: <20080115165848.GC13187@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear Philipp,

as one of the maintainers of TeX Live I have the following questions
concerning the two packages etoolbox and biblatex:

We want to include them into TeX Live (the 2008 release is closing in),
in fact etoolbox is already, and biblatex is on my todo list.

There is only one slight problem: The source of the documentation.
Concerning etoolbox the source code is present, but not the respective
class 'latexdoc.cls'. Concerning biblatex the source of the biblatex.pdf
documentation file is completely missing as far as I see.

Our policy is as follows: We want to include as much as possible, but
source has to be provided. It is not necessary that the source can be
translated into the exact same pdf, like due to missing fonts, but in
general a recompilation should be possible.

That gives us two problems:
- for etoolbox we would need the latexdoc.cls
- for biblatex we would need the source code

In the absence of these file we will (unfortunately) only include the
actual code, but not the documentation of these packages.

We hope that you could help us here, best by uploading new versions to
CTAN.

Thanks a lot for all your contributions and all the best

Norbert

Message-ID: <20080117234727.GC2568@free.fr>

Hello,

In fedora using the default fedora updmap.cfg, a pdftex run leads to many 
pdfTeX warning: /usr/bin/pdflatex (file /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map): ambiguous entry for `ecbm1440': font file present but not
included, will be treated as font file not present

It seems to me that it is because there is the map
MixedMap cm-super-t1.map
and that it corresponds with
texmf/fonts/map/dvipdfm/context/cm-super-t1.map
which is a dvipdfm map file which is not compatible with pdftex maps,
since it has lines like
ecbm1440 cm-super-t1 sfbm1440
which are not correct for pdftex, they should be like
ecbm1440 cm-super-t1 <sfbm1440.pfb
or even better, as in the pdftex.map shipped with texlive
ecbm1440 SFBM1440 "T1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t1.enc <sfbm1440.pfb

So it seems to me that another cm-super-t1.map is missing which would be
correct for dvips/pdftex. But even in that case how comes that a dvipdfm
map is used for a pdftex map? Is it a bug in updmap? Somewhere else?

i presume you're talking about the fedora 8 beta port of tex live,
that's now on its way in fedora 9?

it's _not_ a tex live issue: i corrected it by providing myself with the
correct map file from the tex live disc.

if so, this is a failure to rectify something i reported to the thread
on the redhat bugs system rather early on.  they had reported the bug
resolved, i thought.

would you post an issue on the redhat bugreport site, please?

It is in f9 proper but in a separate repository for f8.

I disagree. I understand that it is solved by providing the correct map,
but when there is only the dvipdfm map installed I think that things
should not break. And I don't understand what should be corrected. Is it
that dvipdfm map should not be shipped appart from pdftex maps, or is it
an issue in updmap? In any case it is not completely clear to me that 
it is fedora only issue. One should be able to install a subset of 
texlive-texmf and have everything functionning.

Yes, at that time I didn't understood the issue at all... Now I
understand better.

> would you post an issue on the redhat bugreport site, please?

This is already reported in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=425804

But still this is not fedora specific in my opinion, the texlive tools
and bundling (maybe CTAN?) shouldn't leave such a situation happen.
I may be wrong, but in that case there could be some documentation
somewhere explaining the issue. Maybe it exists and I missed it.

Then this is a bug of packaging in RH. The following files are present
in TeX Live 2007:
	Master-2007.0/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvipdfm/context/cm-super-t1.map
	Master-2007.0/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cm-super/cm-super-t1.map

It is an fedora only issue, we haven't that with the Debian packages,
nor with normal installations of TL2007.

> But still this is not fedora specific in my opinion, the texlive tools

It is. The correct file IS shipped in TL2007.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0801180856210.29811@caos.wirtschaft.tu-chemnitz.de>

Hello,

when I use the beamer class (3.07 on Debian, same problem with 3.06) with
the option "ignorenonframetext", the \input command inside the document
doesn't work. Example:

\documentclass[ignorenonframetext]{beamer}
\begin{document}
\input{b1.tex}
\end{document}

b1.tex:
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{xxx}
yyy
\end{frame}

Of course, with the option any text outside the frame blocks should be
ignored, but I think it is not usefull to ignore the \input command too.

Greetings,
Jens

This file is missing from the Fedora TeXLive package:

because we don't package cm-super.zip. The reason is its huge size (66M
zipped,
112M expanded). TeXLive would only hardly fit to any Fedora LiveCD media if
we
package it. Is there any way how to generate correct pdftex map files
without
cm-super installed?

Thanks for any help,

Yes: But I guess I know what you did wrong (someone else did probably
the same error while packaging):

Do the FC people create a new updmap.cfg of just take the one from TeX
Live???

If you take the one in the TL2007 then you are lost!!! It does not
correspond to what you have installed.

You should have taken a look at the included .tpm files and ONLY added
antries to the updmap.cfg for those packages containing something like
    <TPM:Installation>
      <TPM:Execute function="addMap" mode="mixed" parameter="cm-super-t1.map"/>
      <TPM:Execute function="addMap" mode="mixed" parameter="cm-super-t2a.map"/>
      <TPM:Execute function="addMap" mode="mixed" parameter="cm-super-t2b.map"/>
      <TPM:Execute function="addMap" mode="mixed" parameter="cm-super-t2c.map"/>
      <TPM:Execute function="addMap" mode="mixed" parameter="cm-super-ts1.map"/>
      <TPM:Execute function="addMap" mode="mixed" parameter="cm-super-x2.map"/>
    </TPM:Installation>

You should NOT add map files to updmap.cfg if they are not
installed/activated.

It seems that cm-super is not installed, but the
dvipdfm/t1-cmsuper-t1.amp is shipped with context. Now, you ask updmap
to include cm-super-t1.map and it tries hard to find it, and takes the
dvipdfm one, which is a bad thing.

Unit learned: Read tpm files, and for 2008 the texlive.tlpdb, and do NOT
take anything as is.

Or read the installer (shell script).

Best wishes

We modified updmap.cfg of course, otherwise updmap coudln't succeed because
of missing map files, it needs some fine-tuning though. After commenting out
the cm-super map files updmap-sys now generates much more sane pdftex map
files. I will play with it yet more.

Thanks for help!

If you install ALL of TeX Live but cm-super then you are settled, all
the right map files are there.

Otherwise it is quite easy: For every zip you don't include check the
included .tpm file and remove the reference to the map file listed in
the .tpm files TPM:Installation/Execute function.

Next year the tpms are gone, and we will have perl modules for the
access to all these data.

Best wishes

Hi all of you,

just a short warning that I will soon disappear into the wild. Means
that from next weekend on I will be hardly online for about 2 and a half
month, in other words till mid April.

I have several weeks with clients (mountaineering) and myself the second
part of the exams for mountain guide.

In February I will be in Vienna for one week between 17. and 23.
In March I will be in Vienna for one week between 16. and 22. (not sure)
And in April I will be back probably around the 10.

Best wishes

I have only looked superficially at this, but can the tpm be used to
know the dependency chains between ctan packages and ctan packages and
fonts (at least those included in texlive)? Is there some doc on that 
or is it only in the code? And last will it still be used with the perl 
modules and where are they located?

No, dependencies between tex packages are nowhere tracked. Most of the
times not even the authors know that properly.

If you meant linking zip/tpm names to CTAN, yes, it is more or less a
direct link.

> fonts (at least those included in texlive)? Is there some doc on that

That is the problem, it is only in the code, Tpm.pm is a module Fabrice
wrote long time ago, and tpm-factory.pl.

> modules and where are they located?

No, TL2008 will ship with a complete new infrastructure. There is a
paper in the proceedings of the GuIT meetings, also online in the
texlive svn repository, where there are also all the perl modules. And
all the modules are POD documented.

Documentation
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/doc/
paper:
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/doc/tlinfra-guit07.pdf
from the talk there is even a video online (grrr), don't remember where.

Modules
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/

various programs
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/bin/

The new installer will (probably) be based on these modules already. We
are working hard on it.

Help appreciated. If you need details you can ask me, but mind that I am
offline for quite some time rather soon, or quasi offline.

Best wishes

Norbert

Note that the paper is out of date, the definitive doc is in the pod of

Subject: [tex-live] "make check" failure: missing omega.ini
Message-ID: <m3ejcfh6rw.fsf@multivac.cwru.edu>

Hi.  I'm building TeX Live from source.  Compilation goes fine, but
"make check" doesn't get very far:

...
make[2]: Entering directory `/fs/pkgs/mount/package/host/code.dogmap.org/foreign/texlive-2007+spf+0/compile/src/texk/web2c'
TEXMFCNF=../kpathsea make progname=aleph files="omega.ini" prereq-check

../kpathsea/kpsewhich --progname=aleph omega.ini >/dev/null || make prereq-lose >/dev/null
You seem to be missing input files necessary to make the
basic formats (some or all of: omega.ini).
Perhaps you've defined the default paths incorrectly, or
perhaps you have environment variables set pointing
to an incorrect location.  See ../kpathsea/BUGS.

If you simply do not have the files, you can
retrieve a minimal set of input files from CTAN hosts.
make[4]: *** [prereq-lose] Error 1
make[3]: *** [prereq-check] Error 2
make[3]: Leaving directory `/fs/pkgs/mount/package/host/code.dogmap.org/foreign/texlive-2007+spf+0/compile/src/texk/web2c'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/fs/pkgs/mount/package/host/code.dogmap.org/foreign/texlive-2007+spf+0/compile/src/texk'

I don't see any file named "omega.ini" in the build directory at this
point.  Is it supposed to come from somewhere other than the source
tarball?

As a side note, it would be useful if the source tarball's name
included the package name and version number (even if that is just the
year).  Maybe this could be done for the 2008 version?

Just fine, thank you.

No, sorry, you have given us no useful information to go on.
Please read the following, then try again:

  http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

Yes, I know it is long, but it is absolutely essential.

If you have access to a friend or colleague with good computer skills,
you may want to ask that person for advice with (1) trying to install
the software, and (2) if that fails, write a problem description that
actually makes sense.

Hi Paul,

    "make check" doesn't get very far:

Nope.  The make check stuff dates back 15 years to when I was still
putting together minimal distributions, and Thomas probably kept it
working with teTeX (don't know for sure).  It won't work in the context
of TL.

At present, there is no useful testing :(.  (I tried setting up some
infrastructure for it a couple years ago but no one came forward to
help, so I moved on to other things.)

    As a side note, it would be useful if the source tarball's name
    included the package name and version number (even if that is just the
    year).  Maybe this could be done for the 2008 version?

Yes, we'll do that for this year's release (among other such things,
like not just releasing iso's).

Best,
Karl

Hi Truong,
if you get a menu option "ADDING PACKAGE", then the installer is in
maintenance mode.  This happens when it detects an installed
TeXLive-2007 on the system.  

Could you please type on the command line:

  set > environment.txt

and send us the file "environment.txt"?

Regards,
  Reinhard

So someone was able to extract information from his post after all.
Maybe I was too harsh on him.  Anyway, he emailed me privately and
told me he had solved his problem.

I now see that you've added all four Arphic CJK fonts to TeXLive.
Previously, to save space, I've added only two of them.  Is this
restriction gone?

Hi all, 

there is a bug in txfonts.sty, easily reproducible with:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{txfonts}

\verb=\precapprox= prints as \ \  $\precapprox$\\
\verb=\nprecapprox= prints as \ \  $\nprecapprox$\\

If you compare that with the output using amssymb instead of txfonts you
see that precapprox and succapprox are exchanged. The fix is simple:

in principle, since the stuff is gpl-ed, one could just correct the

Dear Ryu,

I am one of the TeX Live maintainers, upstream and also for Debian. One
user of the Ubuntu packages found a small bug in the txfonts which is
easily seen by trying that:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{txfonts}

It would be great if you could fix this (as upstream) and re-upload a

the TeX Live distribution etc.

Thanks a lot for your contribution and all the best

Hi,

the beamer package seems to have trouble with the pdfTeX
engine used for LaTeX. Note that the same beamer package
has worked perfect within TeXLive 2005.  Just an example

  \documentclass{beamer}
  \mode<presentation>{\usetheme{PaloAlto}}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Question}
  answer
  \end{block}
  This text should not be grey
  \end{frame}
  \end{document}

with TeXLive 2005 the foreground text after the block
environment is black but with the TeXLive 2007 the same
text has the same foreground cloror as the background
of the answer block.

What does cause this change?  The beamer package hasn't
changed.

I don't know (and I suggest asking Till Tantau), but I know that with
pdftex trunk and beamer 3.07 (i.e. TeXLive trunk) the text is black.

No this seems to be a bug in beamer. I am running TeX Live 2007 with
beamer version 3.07 and the text is black.

The changelog gives a hint:
  - Fixed color problem in beamer boxes with rounded corners.

Please try with beamer 2.07.

If you need a package (zip/tar.gz) which you simply can unpack into a
TeX Live installation let me know.

I've done a patch for beamer 3.06 based on beamer 3.07.
Works perfect.

     ttf2pk's configure apparently didn't use the  
    cached value, but came up with its own value (blank). 

I've checked in a new version of ttf2pk/configure and
freetype/freetype.ac which I believe fixes the problem.  Please try if
you can.

The bug was that freetype.ac, in the --with-system-freetype case, did
not ensure that $CPP was already defined; so it saved and restored an
empty value.  The other packages which use freetype (apparently) had
already defined $CPP, but ttf2pk did not.

Hope this will do it ...

Message-ID: <20080123.234247.38385881.wl@gnu.org>


It seems that mktexdir (or mktextfm) doesn't handle `~' properly in
directory names.  For example, running

  mktextfm larm1200

I get the error

  mktextfm: mktexdir ~/.texlive2008/texmf-var/fonts/tfm/lh/lh-t2a failed.

And indeed: mktexdir doesn't expand `~' to my home directory but
creates a directory called `~/.texlive2008/...' within my home
directory.  On the other hand, running

  mktexdir ~/foo

properly expands the tilde...  It looks like a missing `eval'
somewhere in the code.

Since such a problem must have been detected much earlier I wonder
whether something different could cause this...

I'm using the current SVN TeXLive version, running on a SuSE 10.2
GNU/Linux box, with no special customization.

Some further analysis shows that the problem is in mktexnam.

This line:

  eval MT_TFMDESTDIR=\"$MT_TFMDESTDIR\"

Doesn't expand the tilde character.  However,

  eval MT_TFMDESTDIR=$MT_TFMDESTDIR

Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1201131243.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

Werner LEMBERG <wl at gnu.org> asks about the behavior of shell expansion
exhibited by this test, and wants to know if this is a bug in bash:

	$ export MT_TFMDESTDIR='~/bin'

	$ eval FOO=\"$MT_TFMDESTDIR\"

	$ echo $FOO
	~/bin

	$ eval FOO="$MT_TFMDESTDIR"

	$ echo $FOO
	/u/sy/beebe/bin

	$ eval FOO=$MT_TFMDESTDIR

	$ echo $FOO
	/u/sy/beebe/bin

I've made this experiment with bash (3.2.33(1)), ksh (Version M
1993-12-28 o+), pdksh (PD KSH v5.2.14 99/07/13.2), and zsh (4.1.1),
and get identical behavior.  

Unix shell variable expansion is arcane and horribly complex: see the
flow chart on p. 165 of Classic Shell Scripting, and the accompanying
description.

Why export?

This first constructs the string 'FOO="~/bin"' and then executes it.
Which assigns a quoted ~/bin to FOO.

> 	$ echo $FOO
> 	~/bin

Tilde expansion is done before parameter expansion.

> 	$ eval FOO="$MT_TFMDESTDIR"

This constructs the string 'FOO=~/bin' and then executes it.  Since ~ is
not quoted in the execution, tilde expansion happens.

Actually the same.

mktexdir, and /bin/sh shell scripts in general, have never expanded ~.

What's changed is that we are experimenting with using ~ instead of
$HOME in texmf.cnf.  That solves two problems -- the envvar is not $HOME
on Windows, and kpse's ~ expansion avoids an extra /.

However, the kpsewhich function which the mktex scripts call didn't
do ~ expansion.  To avoid having to change every script, I changed
kpsewhich.

If you get the new i386-linux kpsewhich binary from the repo, does that
help?

Dear Karl, dear all,


floatflt seems to be unfree, the copying conditions as laid out in
flotflt.ins say:
  ...
  %  user(s) of your file(s).  You may freely distribute the
  %  files floatflt.dtx and floatflt.ins, provided: 1. You do not
  %  take money for the distribution or use of these files except
  %  for a nominal charge for diskettes and postage; and 2. You
  %  always distribute `floatflt.dtx' and `floatflt.ins' together
  %  at the same time. 

I guess we have to remove them from the distributions (and from the
Debian packages).

As a follow-up of Robins remark, I guess we should remove the following
packages which have a nosell license entry in the Catalogue:

	bera		Bera fonts
	calendar	A package for calendars and timetables
	cheq		Adobe chess font
	deleq		Flexible numbering of equations
	dropping	Drop first letter of paragraphs
	floatflt	Wrap text around floats
	mnras		Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
	mltex		The MLTeX system
	morse		Support for printing Morse code signs
	ocr-a		Fonts for OCR-A
	oxford		A BibTeX style geared for use in the humanities
	psfig		A graphics inclusion package
	realcalc	Macros for real arithmetic calculations
	sae		Typeset an SAE technical paper

(these are all nosell in the current texlive.tlpdb).

If anyone has comments/better information on these packages, or wants to
check that the restrictions still exists, please let us know.

Otherwise I suppose that Karl and me will remove these packages from the
TeX Live repository.

  Permissions look odd on some of the installed directories (below).

  texmf-var was rw for everyone - surely that can't be right?

  In the end, I just did this (in the texlive installation directory): 
   
  % chmod -R go=u-w 2007
   
  That seems to have fixed it, and I hope it was correct, 
   
  But shouldn't the install script take care of this - and if not, shouldn't the documentation cover it?

This is Bitstream Vera for TeX. The Vera license is not strictly
'nosell' but more 'sell only as part of a collection', which is
considered DFSG free.

But in the end what is the latest "stable" version of beamer? Because
at sourceforge there is 3.06, while TL and CTAN has 3.07, and I heard

Hello Karl,

Andrew,

Thanks for taking the time to write.

    drwxr--r--  19 tex      tex         4096 Jan 22 12:42 texmf

I can't say why the directories ended up lacking the x bit.  They aren't
that way in the original.  Maybe you had an unusual umask setting?

      texmf-var was rw for everyone - surely that can't be right? 

The system texmf-var is used rather like /tmp for TeX, so, yes -- the
idea being that any user on the system might end up running something
that causes a font (or whatever) to be autogenerated.

There is an option to make it append-only, like /tmp typically is these days.

  % chmod -R go=u-w 2007

  That seems to have fixed it, and I hope it was correct, 

As long as you are the only user, seems plausible to me.  You're going
to have to do something to add the x bit on the directories.

  if not, shouldn't the documentation cover it?

This is the first time I recall this problem being reported.

Best,
Karl

Yes.

I am unaware that mltex is "nosell".  The license statement about it in
tex.ch appears essentially identical to TeX itself to me.  The macros
talk about LPPL.  Is there some other statement somewhere that says
nosell?

i couldn't find any such, and i failed to notice that the files in the
latex/ subdir, and their statements about lppl.

which is why the catalogue says licence unkown for the package.

i certainly don't see a nosell provision anywhere in the files.

Werner,

Back on this mail from 2 Jul 2005 about parentheses and TFM files.

I asked: The EC fonts have parentheses in the coding scheme strings?
And you said: Yes.

But I just ran tftopl on every ec*tfm in
Master/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/jknappen/ec and saw no such parentheses.
I'm confused, since Jorg confirmed back in 2005 that the parens were
there, and the ec*.tfm's haven't changed in years.

Then, as one possible fix, you wrote:
    Changing `(' and `)' to `/', as it is done with pltotf.

Looking at the pltotf source, I didn't quickly see where that happens.
(I also didn't actually try it, having already spent too long
researching this again.)

sourceforge has the latest, which is 3.07. Don't mix News items with

Same with CTAN.

3.08 I haven't seen, but there might be pre-releases.

Message-ID: <472930.15951.qm@web27202.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Thanks for that quick and helpful answer. 
   
  The file permissions issue seems even stranger if nobody else has encountered it. 
   
  My umask setting was 77, which I don't think is unusual; in any case, I don't see how it could cause some directories to lose x permisison (texmf, texmf-local, texmf-var), while leaving their sister directories with the correct permissions (bin, texmf-dist, texmf-doc). 
   
  If it does happen, however, one is still left to make surmises about what the correct permissions are supposed to be.
  __
   
  Though I haven't installed anything much on Unix for quite a long time, this TeX Live installation now has been a pretty painless experience - so thanks go to all the people who've contributed to making it that way.

I kept these two, as discussed:
            bera		Bera fonts
            mltex		The MLTeX system

I didn't see any license statement one way or another in this one,
except that mn2e.bst was "extensively modified" from astron and apalike,
which presumably means it keeps the same (free) license.  Hmm.
            mnras		Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society

All of the following are now gone from TL; I confirmed there were
explicit nosell statements present:
	calendar	A package for calendars and timetables
	cheq		Adobe chess font
	deleq		Flexible numbering of equations
	dropping	Drop first letter of paragraphs
	floatflt	Wrap text around floats
	morse		Support for printing Morse code signs
	ocr-a		Fonts for OCR-A
	oxford		A BibTeX style geared for use in the humanities
	psfig		A graphics inclusion package
	realcalc	Macros for real arithmetic calculations
	sae		Typeset an SAE technical paper

I see there are a few more in TL whose Catalogue license is
"nocommercial".  Will look into those soon.

The logs of http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=263549 mention
that the author of floatflt has given permission to distribute it under the
LPPL.

however, unless he takes the trouble to mention it to the ctan team
(ctan at dante.de), the licence isn't going to get changed in the
catalogue, and it won't therefore make it to tex-live, so that debian
will need to pull it from ctan.

(i expended some effort trying to contact him, a while back, with no
response, so a spontaneous commission to debian and not the rest of the
world seems improbable.)

I'm not sure of the exact details, but I think you need to update the  
PGF and Beamer packages from CTAN, as the versions shipped on TeX  
Live 2007 had some incompatibilities with XeTeX.

The XeTeX mailing list (see http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/XeTeX/)  
is probably the best place to find users who could give more  
information on this.

PGF in TL 2007 does not recognise XeTeX but it is sufficient to add
the following definition to your preamble:
\def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-dvipdfm.def}

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with local fonts
Message-ID: <479D9683.50702@student.kuleuven.be>

Hi,

I cannot get the local fonts right. I run TeXLive 2007 on Vista 32-bit.
I set the local texmf tree manually under C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-local and 
then put the files under:

       
C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-local\fonts\pk\ljfour\kulstijl\dpi300\kulfont1.300pk
       
C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-local\fonts\pk\ljfour\kulstijl\dpi600\kulfont1.600pk
       C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-local\fonts\tfm\kulstijl\kulfont1.tfm

Of course I updated the texmf tree.

Now when I try to build a document with the font, dviout complains with 
the following:

    Abort automatic font generation for this file?
    Retry it for the investigation by executinhg GEN_TMP.BAT?
    Ignore this font?

Of course I retry:

    
C:\Users\Diederik\Documents\Doctoraat\Voortzettingsrapport>C:\TEXLIV~1\bin\win32
    \mktexpk.exe --mfmode / --dpi 600 --bdpi 600 --mag 600/600 kulfont1

    mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for kulfont1.
*    C:\Users\Diederik\Documents\Doctoraat\Voortzettingsrapport>Pause to

    Druk op een toets om door te gaan. . .

Going back to dviout I get quite some info from the logfile:

As you can see, the texmf-local subtree is not even considered.
I tried for days to find it but I didn't! I hope someone here knows this 
problem...

Thanks in advance!

does anybody maintain texdoc (on unix)?

At least in tl2007 it seems texdoc has a completely different
configuration mechanism (environment variables) then texdoctk (which
has an rc and a gui for that).

OK,

I resolved the problem.
I looked finally in de configuration of dviout, which does not use the 
TEXMF config.
After manually refreshing the search path of DVIOUT, it worked!

      My umask setting was 77, which I don't think is unusual; 

Given that umask, wouldn't you expect everything to only be usable by you?
      
      in any case, I don't see how it could cause some directories to
      lose x permisison (texmf, texmf-local, texmf-var), while leaving
      their sister directories with the correct permissions (bin,
      texmf-dist, texmf-doc).

Looking at the install scripts, I see that there are some after-the-fact
chmod's which add r permission to some trees, but not x.  So that's
presumably why the result wasn't just rwx------, as your umask would imply.

Since the installation scripts have been completely reimplemented for
the next release, and I don't think such special chmod's are done any
more, there's probably nothing to do here.

      time, this TeX Live installation now has been a pretty painless
      experience - so thanks go to all the people who've contributed to
      making it that way.

Thanks for the kind words :).

  But ... three of the directories DID have x permission. This is what I had immediately after installation:  
   
    drwxr-xr-x   3 tex      tex         4096 Jan 22 11:48 bin
  drwxr--r--  19 tex      tex         4096 Jan 22 12:42 texmf

  Well, if the installation scripts don't enforce the permissions that are necessary for a given setup scenario, it might be helpful to have a sentence in the installation notes that says something like, "if you want TeX Live to be usable by everyone, you must set umask ... before you start", or "... ensure that you have these file permisions after installation: ...".

More chmod's in the install scripts.

  Well, if  the installation scripts don't enforce  the permissions that
  are necessary for a given setup scenario,

There's nothing to enforce.  It is plausible to run a "private" TeX
installation with no permission to anyone but the owner.  I wouldn't
want TL to blindly make everything publicly readable (as it semi-does now).

    helpful to have a sentence in the installation notes that says
    something like, "if you want TeX Live to be usable by everyone, you
    must set umask ... before you start", or "... ensure that you have
    these file permisions after installation: ...".

Ok, fair enough.  Thanks for the suggestion and all the patient email :).

    does anybody maintain texdoc (on unix)?

Frank, isn't this what you just rewrote in lua?

    At least in tl2007 it seems texdoc has a completely different
    configuration mechanism

Yes.

     (environment variables) 

texdoc (the shell version written by David Aspinall et al.) uses
kpsewhich to find files, so far as I can see.  The environment variables
control what programs get started to view the documentation.

     then texdoctk (which has an rc and a gui for that).

(And that "rc" file is horribly painful to maintain, too.)

The programs were written by two different people at different times.
There is no connection between them so far as I know.

While creating a document, xetex emitted the following message

  ** NOTICE: This document contains a `Preview & Print only'

This is nice, but it should say which fonts are affected... (and, BTW,
this warning doesn't appear in the log file!)

Or is there an option to make xetex even more verbose?

Folks,


does someone offers a `TeXLive Online Service'?

I don't know whether this is the right name, but the idea is that you
submit a .tex file, and you receive a .pdf file, and TeXLive is used
for processing.

Is such a service available at all, with or without TeXLive?  A quick
search with google doesn't bring up anything.

I could imagine that, say, tug.org or dante.de could provide such an
online service.

i've not heard of a tex service anywhere; there are several things that
"do" equations and so on, i think.

dante.de surely not?  a commercial service allowing you to run an
oddball application like tex ... seems unlikely.

tug.org, tex.ac.uk and www.ctan.org are all hosted by universities
(well, a department, in my case), and might manage it ... but i'm
already bouncing along the limit of what's considered acceptable in
terms of service offered, and i know tug.org has to watch its network
load the same as i do.  i'm not sure about www.ctan.org -- its hosts are
obviously more tolerant than mine, since it transfers a lot more than i
do.  (dante has to take special measures to cut down its traffic, too.)

in summary, i don't think it's something we can simply "do", but it
might be worth discussing it further ... if assurances about traffic
loads (and so on) can be given.

robin

note -- i'm nowhere near the limit of out network capacity, but we pay a
bean counter in the university management offices for all our traffic
:-(

This is not e XeTeX message therefore it canot be in the log file. It
is emitted by xdvipdfmx.

Try to generate .xdv by running xetex with the -no-pdf option and then
invoke xdvipdfmx with -v or even -vv.

Prof. Okumura provides a similar service with teTeX-3.0 + pTeX.
Unfortunately, the page is written in Japanese.

See TeXonWeb on http://tex.mendelu.cz/
It is intended for Czech users, so the documentation is in Czech only.
Anybody can type the source into the input window, registered users
(registration is free) can upload their files to a permanent private
directory. If you type "tex on web" into Google, this will be the
first link.

I would personally be very worried about security implications of this
setup. Isn't it possible to run any command when processing a document?
Of course the processing could be done in a special sandbox cleaned after
use, but still...

No, you have a button to run TeX and you can switch between plain TeX
and LaTeX by menu options. \write18 is disabled in configuration. You
can also specify that \input of the file with the full path is not
allowed so that \verbatiminput{/etc/passwd} will not work.

Right.

Also, I'm expecting the TL2008 release to improve some of these  
messages, to make them clearer/more informative.

  The ConTeXt Garden offers such a service for ConTeXt.  It uses TeX
Live 2007 and the latest ConTeXt distribution released by Hans.  The
ConTeXt part is updated automatically, which is a mixed blessing.

  I'm sure I have seen a similar service for LaTeX, other than the ones
that have already been mentioned.

There is a plugin for mediawiki that allows collaborative edditing /
comiling of laTeX documents, but I forget the name of it. I set one up
here for a research group.

  You mean WikiTeX?  http://www.wikitex.org/  I've never really looked
into it, but it seems quite interesting.

  By the way, the ConTeXt wiki also allows including TeX code in Wiki
markup.  ConTeXt is then run behind the scenes and returns the result as
a PNG image (obviously not ideal, but stil useful).

quite so: it's part of a scheme for converting various monotype greek
font to mf, as far as i can tell.

since we now have all these lovely gfs fonts, not to mention all the
options in the otf arena, i'm inclined to suggest that we ask apostolos
whether it's not a good idea to dump grtimes from tex-live.

(i've recently reorganised the greek stuff on ctan, separating the font
part and the macro part.  i had to look rather carefully at grtimes
because it was in a directory that was otherwise almost exclusively
macros.)

Yes, and I think the version in the texlive is the most recent. Actually
I wanted to ask for write access to the repository, so that I can use
the texlive svn as upstream for texdoc. It's just that I don't have time
for coding at the moment...

texdoc(lua) also uses libkpathsea, even to find out which programs to
use to view the documenation. I am not sure whether environment
variables are respected somehow (they should), if yes then it's by some
lua/kpathsea magic, because I don't specially cater for them. Unless
I've forgotten some patch that someone else sent me...

Thomas Ruedas who wrote texdoctk told me some time ago (maybe in 2006?)
that he was going to work again on it, but I don't think he has actually
published anything. From a conceptual point of view, the biggest
drawback to texdoctk that I saw is that it's very hard to add
information for local documentation.

There's a third thing, writen in PHP and called tdphp. It was included
in teTeX 3.0 and provided a http-browsable interface if a local
webserver was running. I think it uses texdoctk's texdoc.dat, but it
allowed to add local entries in $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat.

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/tetex-base/trunk/doc/tdphp/?rev=0&sc=0
and
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/patches/patch-texdocphp?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

The author was very active back then, I'm not sure about now (it's
probably not very encouraging to see your work incorporated in teTeX 3.0
for the first time, but then dropped in its successor, TeXLive...)

I'd be worried, too. There are many details in a standard TeX setup, as
well as deep in the bowels of our code, which were never designed for
such a situation.

It's probably possible to exclude this possibility quite well, as Zdenek
pointed out. But the first attack which I would try would be to fill up
the /var partition by generating lots of useless fonts. Next, after some
reading, I'd try to generate a file outside the /var/cache hierarchy by
finding some loophole in kpathsea which no one ever cared to check for...
