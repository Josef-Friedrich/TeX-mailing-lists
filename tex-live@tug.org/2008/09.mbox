Subject: [tex-live] Problems with tlmgr
Message-ID: <gyy2n92ds1xt$.x124ls4w6eve.dlg@40tude.net>

Hi @ all,

I've just installed TeXLive 2k8 on my vista machine and got the following 
problem that the tlmgr (Texlivemanager) doesn't want to start, if I try to 
start it form an commandwindow I just get the following hint and everything 
is done:

"Undefined subroutine &main::debug called at 
C:/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui/tlmgrgui-real.pl line 171.
Compilation failed in reqzire at 
C:\texlive\2008\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgrgui\tlmgrgui.pl line 72."

can somebody help or has somebody an idea what's going wrong?

Thanks
Martin

Martin, can you confirm it really says "reqzire" ?
I have looked at the source and can see only "require".

No, PERL5LIB should be set when you install Perl.  Nothing except Perl
itself needs this env var.

First of all, this variable should be used by Perl provided by TL2007
only.  Other programs can simply call Perl without depending on this
variable.  However, If you have written your own Perl scripts which
are currently using TL-2007's Perl, it's probably better to uninstall
it and install ActivePerl instead.  The TL-2007 Perl stuff is no
longer maintained.

The Perl scripts which are part of TL-2008 are launched by a wrapper
script which overwrites PERL5LIB.  The relevant piece of code is:

  TEXDIR=kpse.var_value('SELFAUTOPARENT')
  os.setenv('PERL5LIB', TEXDIR..'/tlpkg/tlperl/lib')
 
Hence, you can keep PERL5LIB or remove it, but I propose to uninstall
TL-2007 completely and install ActivePerl if needed.  It's not needed
by TL-2008, though.

TL doesn't set TEXINPUTS, and it hopefully didn't in the past.  In my
opinion this variable shouldn't be set at all. Never!  There are
better means to twaek your system than to set environment variables.

Strange.  Does the MikTeX documentation encourage people to set
TEXINPUTS?  If it's not possible to simply add './' to the search path
in the main config file I fear that there is no convenient way to use
TeX Live *AND* MikTeX at the same time.

Hovever, experienced users could write batch files, like

-------------------------------------
@echo off
TEXINPUTS=
PATH=\path\to\texlive\bin;%PATH%
cmd.exe 
-------------------------------------

or

-------------------------------------
@echo off
PATH=\path\to\miktex\bin;%PATH%
cmd.exe 
-------------------------------------

And then they can use both, TeX Live and MikTeX.  But I expect that
most people decide in favor of one system and it makes most sense then
to remove the other one completely.

BTW, I can't repeat it often enough: Only set TeX related environment
varibles if you have no other choice and if you are absolutely sure
that you know what you are doing.  You always have another choice
though I must admit that I don't know anything about MikTeX.  These
environment variables are only good for headaches, maybe not
immediately but certainly in one or two years.  There is no need to
use them, TeX Live is more happy without them and I assume that they
can be avoided in MikTeX too.

PLEASE AVOID ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES!  Read the manual describing your
TeX distribution instead.  There are more appropriate solutions.  None
of them depends on environment variables.  And as I said before,
environment variables are only good for headaches.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, definitively. I know Richard Koch is working on MacTeX2008, and  
I'm sure it will be released as soon as TL2008 gets the green light.

It would be nice indeed if Cygwin maintainers could swith from teTeX
to a halfways recent TeX Live distribution soon.  If there are any
problems, this mailing list is quite appropriate.

Today I moved the files so that the TL 2008 image is the official
release.  It should be making its way around CTAN over the next few
days.  MacTeX 2008 will follow shortly.

I updated all the web pages at http://tug.org/texlive (among others).
No doubt I made plenty of errors, so send in those bugs and suggestions.

I'll wait until tomorrow to send a bigger announcement to the general
TeX lists, to give propagation a bit longer to happen.

Thanks to everyone,
karl

Hello,

Fengnan Gao answered me and forgot to add tex-live to the recipients.
It seems to be a problem with Acrobat 9.0 pro.

Agreed : launching the file directly does /not/
induce the problem.  The TeXdoc interface would
seem to lie at the heart of this, rather than
the specific version of Acrobat.

Incidentally, while testing, I double-clicked
on "minitoc.pdf", and not only it but "t-lilypond.pdf"
opened : "lilypond.pdf" is not even in the same
directory ...

Furthermore, "TeXdoc t-lilypond" provokes the
same error (with AR 8.1) as does "TeXdoc minitoc".

When I use other pdf viewers, there is no problem and if 
I keep a Acrobat window open, there would be no problem. 
So I would rather believe it is not texdoc's fault, but I
still don't get it, how that can happen?

Hmm, it happened once before to me, but it has nothing to
do with texdoc, it must be minitoc.pdf.

As a matter of fact, I think when you type 
    texdoc whatever
if there exists a documentation for that "whatever" a error
box would pop up.

Hi Philip,

Does
texdocc minitoc
also fail?

(texdocc: another texdoc by c, win32 only.
          usage is printed by texdocc)

Hmm. Can you please try lauching

start "" "c:\path\to\minitoc.pdf"

in a cmd window and see it the same problem happens? Cause that's what texdoc
is doing (try texdoc -v minitoc to confirm) and AFAIK it's the recommended way
of openning documents on windows. At least, it worked when I did tests.

Works fine, as does

	start c:\path\to\minitoc.pdf

What does not work (brings up a CMD box) is

	start "c:\path\to\minitoc.pdf"

> in a cmd window and see it the same problem happens? Cause that's what texdoc

Cannot confirm : "texdoc -v minitoc" does
nothing detectable apart from report the version.

The best I can accomplish by way of a trace is

> C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>texdoc -n32767 minitoc
> texdoc debug1: start "" "D:\TeX\Live\2008\texmf-dist\doc\latex\minitoc\minitoc.pdf"

> C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>

which died as before.  The same "start" command copied and pasted
into the existing CMD window works fine.

> and AFAIK it's the recommended way

What is the purpose of the leading '""' ?  Is this needed
to work around the need for quotes around the path when
the latter contains spaces ?

> Are other files working at all with texdoc + AR?

I haven't tried any (I never use TeXdoc); if you can
suggest a few, I will try them.

Akira Kakuto wrote:

No, that works fine.  The corresponding trace is :

> C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>texdocc -v minitoc
> I now display a document by the command
> cmd /c start d:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/minitoc/minitoc.pdf

I am just setting up a duplicate setup with forced spaces
in the path (".../texmf dist/...") to see how this will
affect things ...

It fails in another way. It says "Windows cannot find d:\program"
(I translate from Chinese), my texlive install path is d:\program 
files\texlive.

Maybe it's the space between "program" and "files"? Is there anyone who
install texlive in a path whose name doesn't contain a space? Test if you
can?

Well, that's something I'd really like to know: is there any pdf documentation
that can be sucessfully opened from texdoc in AR or AA or is it specific to
certain pdf files?

Well, it seems to me that the case is if the current directory is 
"c:\users\xxx\"
then I use "start some-pdf.pdf", which is in "c:\users\xxx\", it works fine. 
Acrobat
is called and pdf is opened. However if I type "start 
c:\users\xxx\some-pdf.pdf" which
is exactly the same file, the cmd window just pop up another cmd window and 
does nothing.
I don't know what is going on there.

Sorry. texdocc does not support spaces in path.
It is easy to fix, but it is too late.

None, I'm afraid. I tried ten times and found out none of the ten pdfs can

So stupid of me. "texdoc -n4 minitoc" is the correct syntax, as you found out
yourself.

This I cannot understand. The two relevant line of the code are:

        err_print(view_command, 'debug1')
        view_result = os.execute(view_command)

As you can see, texdoc doesn't lie to you: it really tries to execute the
command it says it does. Can you please try the following minimal texlua code?

os.execute('start "" ' ..
'"D:\TeX\Live\2008\texmf-dist\doc\latex\minitoc\minitoc.pdf"')

(put it in a file an run texlua 'file')

When the first argument to start is quoted, start assumes it's the (optional)
title of the new window. So the purpose of the initial "" is to prevent start
from thinking the quoted filename is the title.

I just come to think of it, maybe AR doesn't like this empty title setting.
What I really can't understand is why the same command works when directly
typed in the command line.

texdoc, live, latex2e, impatient, hyperref, beamer, pgf, (in theory any recent
LateX package you can think of).

Ok, so maybe I should use a similar command line from texdoc too.

Thanks a lot.

Actually, I have very few knowledge of windows, and for some reason AR doesn't
want to install on the only copy of it I have, so I can't even test things
myself...

Manuel.

This is kind of good news: the problem looks more rational this way.

Thanks for all your tests.

Maybe we can add it to some update. Does that means I 
have to re-install texlive 2008? That's quite a long
wait for the install process.

I suspect you are putting quotes around the path,
which Start will take as the title for the window.

Either omit the quotes, or force a title, as in :

	Start c:\users\xxx\some-pdf.pdf
	Start "Some-pdf.pdf" "c:\users\xxx\some-pdf.pdf"

It works! Thanks! I don't know the command "start" has so
many tricks. All right then, I can say that my "start"
command works fine. So it should have nothing to do
with "start".

Failed : was the line wrapping intentional, as it may

OK, I finally have a version of the TeX Lua
code that works : note (a)~all on one line;
(b)~escaped backslashes.

	os.execute('start "" "D:\\TeX\\Live\\2008\\texmf-dist\\doc\\latex\\minitoc\\minitoc.pdf"')

Does TeX Lua not take ".lua" as the default extension ?
I ask because I first tried

	TeXlua test

and this failed, so I tried

	TeXlua test.lua

and it worked ...

Shouldn't have been a problem with the previous version: the .. operator
concatenates the strings anyway, and lua is a rather space-insensitive
language.

Oops. But anyway the real code from texdoc correctly escapes
backslashes. So unless I missed something it should lauch exactly the
above line. I can't understand what it works in a one-liner and not with
the full program.

Anyway, I finally got AR9 to install on my windows machine (had to
manuallky get rid of some bogus registry entries before) and I'll be
able to continue testing myself.

By the way, i'm sorry I forgot to say it earlier, but since a few days
there is a separate mailing list for texdoc (texdoc AT tug.org) in order
to avoid bloating the main texlive list.

I suppose we'd better finish this discussion here for readability's
sake, but afterwards it would be better to use the dedicated mailing
list for texdoc-related discussions.

What happens if you just type `tlmgr help' or `tlmgr gui' in a
command prompt?

Tlmgr should be called via a couple of wrapper scripts which set up
everything correctly. Don't try to run the Perl scripts directly.

Ok, I was able to reproduce the problem on my XP SP2 box with Adobe
Reader 9. Summing up what we currently know of the situation:

1. This is not specific to minitoc or whatever, no pdf can be viewed
from texdoc using AR9.

2. The following work:

2a. Run

start "" "C:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf\doc\texdoc\texdoc.pdf"

2b. Run

texlua minimal.tlu

with minimal.tlu containing

command = 'start "" ' ..
'"C:\\Program Files\\texlive\\2008\\texmf\\doc\\texdoc\\texdoc.pdf"'
print (command)
ok = os.execute (command)

(remember that the corresponding part of texdoc's code is

err_print(view_command, 'debug1')
view_result = os.execute(view_command)

...)

2c. Reportedly, setting another pdf reader in texdoc's configuration
works, but I couldn't to reproduce it since I'm apparently unable to
quote the spaces in the path to the command in texdoc.cnf in a way that
windows would accept.

Well, this is driving me mad. Especially that 2b is working while texdoc
isn't, I can't understand.

I'm going to relax a bit, make a few things more usable in my windows
environment, and try to investigate this.

Thank everyone in thread for their report and testing.

Manuel.

..works.

Which made me think to try the following:

texlua "c:\Program Files\texlive\2008\texmf\scripts\texlive\texdoc.tlu"
texdoc

and this one works too.

The good news is, this stuff is getting more rational. The bad news is,
it looks like something is going wrong with our wrapper scripts for win32.

Siep (or any oather win32-wrappers expert), can you please comment on this?

Can the dynamic version of this code (with filename
substitution, etc) be trapped to a file so that one can
experiment with it ?

I write these two lines to my C:\Users\fnsteed\texmf\texdoc\texdoc.cnf (**)
    viewer_pdf = (sumatrapdf %s) &
    viewer_txt = runemacs
then no problem occurs again.
(** That's texdoc -f tells where me my * file for texdoc is, just as in
texdoc's doc)
And it works by opening the pdf with sumatrapdf.exe.

So sumatrapdf is in your path? I tried with

viewer_pdf = "c:\Program Files\[...]\supatrapdf.exe"

and it complained about "c:\Program" not being a valid program name (which is
true, I must admit).

And it's correct.

Sure. In your texlive\2008\bin\win32 you should find a texdoc.bat file that
you can read and possibly understand better than me, but that basically
launches texlua tl-w32-wrapper.texlua (from the same directory) which in turn
sets a few settings before calling the actual script.

OK, I turned on echoing in the .bat file,

The resulting output came on four lines, which read :

> texlua
> "texlua"
> "d:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/texdoc.tlu"
> "minitoc"

I merged these into a single line and tried, expecting
a problem  because of the reduplicated "texlua".  It
failed as expected.  I then remove the string-quoted
"texlua", leaving :

> texlua "d:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/texdoc.tlu" "minitoc"

and this worked.

Does that help at all ?

How exactly did it fail? Did it give the same AR error box as launching
'texdoc minitoc' from the cl or did it fail ealier? Because according to
LuaTeX's reference manual, I suppose

os.spawn ("texlua", "texlua", "arg1", "arg2")

is actually a correct call which is more or less equivalent to

texlua arg1 arg2 on the command line

Yep, that's what I tried to and that made me think the problem may have
something to do with the wrappers.

I don't know yet. Anyway, I have to go now (should already be at work (I mean,
irl)) and will look a this more closely this envening/night.

No, it just does nothing discernible.

So what role should the second "texlua" play
in 'os.spawn ("texlua", "texlua", "arg1", "arg2")',
as it doesn't make it through to 'texlua arg1 arg2' ?

Ok, so it's (as I thought) not the cause of the problem.

It doesn't play any role here. But it where, say "foo" it would achieve the
same effect as calling the real program texlua from a symlink named "foo" on
a Unix system. Precisely, it would force the value "foo" for the argv[0] of
the program (that, the name the program *believes* you used to invoke it).

Ah, all a bit Unix-ey :-)  I suspect that (a)
I didn't need to know this, and (b) it has nothing
to do with the problem.  But /if/ I can't do

	"texlua", "texlua", "arg1", "arg2"

on the command line (and have any perceivable
effect), is it certain that "os.spawn" can do
it successfully ?

Hmmm, well, ... I can't replicate it !

I have written my first-ever Lua program,
which reads

	os.spawn ("texlua",  "texlua", "d:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/texdoc.tlu", "minitoc")

saved it as Test.texlua, and tried to run it
using

	TeXlua Test.texlua

but regardless of whether I have one or two
"texlua, "s within the parentheses, and
regardless of whether or not the first (or
sole) has string-quotes around it, nothing
discernible happens ...

In fact, the only contents of Test.texlua that
have so far had any perceivable effect are

	os.spawn ("logoff")

Nothing more complex has yet achieved anything :-(

Well, I'm sorry I used a shortcut in my previous messages. Actually you have
to create a list first and the give the list (and not its elements) as
argument to os.spawn.

Anyway, if you have ideas and want to continue investigating, I don't want to
discourage you, but otherwise don't take the burden to learn Lua+texlua just
for this, I'm back from "real work" and am going to investigate this now.

os.spwan has a double syntax and behaviour, depending on whether its argument
is string or a list. See luatexref-t.pdf, p. 17-18.

OK, did my best, but had to give up at

	os.exec(commandline) is a variation on os.execute.
	The commandline can be either a single string or a single table.

because there was no example of how to create a table in Lua.

If you could send me a trivial working example, analogous
to the problem we're investigating, I'll be happy to
continue my experiments.

this seems to be invalid, as os.spawn() expects exactly one argument,
and it gives back a 2nd return value on error, see:

a,b = os.spawn ("texlua",  "texlua", "d:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/texdoc.tlu", "minitoc")
print(a, b)

> If you could send me a trivial working example,

I was indeed trying to do a minimal working/failing example, and I think
I got one. Use the two following files:

% begin contents of d:\mpg\program.tlu
os.execute ('start "" "d:\\mpg\\presentation.pdf"')
% end program.tlu

(where you replace d:\\mpg\\presentation.pdf with the path to an
exsiting pdf file, with \ escaped)

% begin contents of wrapper.tlu
command = {}
command[0] = 'texlua'
command[1] = '"texlua"'
command[2] = '"d:/mpg/program.tlu"'

-- kpse.set_program_name("texlua") -- sic!

ret=os.spawn(command)
os.exit(ret)
% end wrapper.tlu

Now you can type 'texlua wrapper.tlu' in a command line: it works.

Then you uncomment the call to kpse.set_program_name and try again: it
fails with the (in)famous AR9 "internal error" we're talking about since
the beginning of this thread.

Then you keep the line uncommented and change your file associations in
windows to open pdf with another pdf viewer (say sumatrapdf) it works again.

This sounds like black magic to me. Anyway, it mostly look like a
texlua/kpse/AR9 problem now, so unless someone has a briliant idea, I'll
forward the previous example to the luatex mailing list.

Cf "By the way, Norbert, if you update kpathsea (or luatex in case kpathsea is
statically linked in it, I don't know), please also update texdoc with it or
 manually change the line

kpse.set_program_name("texdoc")

cause the former form won't work with a recent kpathsea.

Can you remember why you proposed "arg[-1], ", Manuel

No, this is not at all the same problem. This one made kpse crash crying that
it cannot find texmf.cnf. kpse.set_program_name("texlua") is a perfectly okay
invocation for the previous example.

Sure. kpse.set_program_name allows to use other kpse.* functions later, and
those are used to find essential information such as TL's install path and so
on. So it's really not something we can get rid of in the wrapper.

As you can see, it *should* be totally unrelated to the problem.

Well, this is a clue that the problem is probably to hard for me to
understand. To be honest, this sh*t is getting on my nerves: it should NOT
happen, this doesn't sound rational.

Hmm, guess things have calmed down, it's letting me in now.

    http 

I don't know what you tried.  The access through http is
http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/source/
(although I rather fear having it available by http).

    i do have an account on tug.org, but since i never use it, the
    chances of remembering the password are essentially zero.

I'll send you info separately.

    can someone please tell me where i should be mirroring (pref. an ftp
    address, for the time being).

I thought i sent this in one my msgs to ctan yesterday.
Simplest is ftp://tug.org/texlive/Source.  You want the files
texlive-20080816-source.tar.lzma and w32tex-src.tar.lzma, I don't think
any others are necessary.

Hi,
sorry for the late answer, but there had been a lot of stuff to read.

Lua only provides os.execute(), which passes a string to a shell.  Taco
added os.exec() which is supposed to replace the current process by
another one.  It doesn't use a shell but calls the program directly.

One important difference is that if you call a program directly on
Windows, you can use forward slashes in file names because the MS-DOS
API always supported this.  But you'll get into trouble if you use
forward slashes when a command-line interpreter is involved.  The
reason is that forward slashes are treated special by the CLI.  On
UNIX, arguments separated by spaces are passed to the program and the
program is responsible for resolving its arguments, i.e. to find out
which argument is a switch, a file name, or a key-value pair.

On Windows it's not so easy because command-line options are not
delimited by spaces.  I assume that this behavior had been inherited
from VMS.  Please try:

   cd..
   dir/b/s
   cmd/?

These are all valid commands on Windows.  Sigh!

For exactly this reason we tried to avoid os.execute() and used
os.exec() instead.  What we want to achieve by our wrappers is to
replace one process by an other one in a changed environment.

However, os.exec() behaves different on UNIX and Windows because of
different implementations of the execvpe() system call.  On UNIX it
does what we expect.  It replaces the current process image by another
one and waits until it's finished.  On Windows it creates a new
process and returns immediately.  The newly created process runs in
the background.  If such a process hangs because it's waiting for user
input, all you can do is to invoke the task manager in order to kill
it. 

Thus, Taco wrote another function for us, os.spawn().  This function
avoids the CLI and is quite similar to os.exec(), but it waits until
the child process is finished, also on Windows.  And it supports
lists.  At the first glance this was the ultimate solution.

But not on Windows.  Usually, if one program invokes another one, it
passes the arguments as a list with zero-bytes as delimiters and the
other one expects exactly this.  

Obviously, on Windows the argument list you pass to another program is
converted to a string and then converted to a list again.  I don't
understand why, but maybe a CLI is involved here too.

This is what happens:

One program passes 

   foo\0this is a file name with spaces\0bar

to another program.  No problem on UNIX, it's a list containing three
elements, ("foo", "this is a file name with spaces", "bar") separated
by zero-bytes.

On Windows, however, the list is converted to a string:

  "foo this is a file name with spaces bar".

and it's converted back to a list when passed to the child process:

  ("foo\0this\0is\0a\0file\0name\0with\0spaces\0bar".)

Sigh!  You have to quote file names on Windows even if you pass them
as a zero-byte delimited list to other programs.

With all this said, the wrapper script
(bin/win32/tl-w32-wrapper.texlua) should be comprehensible.  The
function fixwin() is supposed to solve the quoting problem.

If you have any problems invoking other programs and you believe that
the wrapper script is the culprit, then please look into it:

---------------------------------------------------------
  --[[ Prepend an additional hyphen to activate this code.
  for i=0, #command do
     print (command[i])
  end
  os.exit(ret)
  --]]
---------------------------------------------------------

If you replace "--[[" by "---[[", i.e. prepending an extra hyphen, the
wrapper script doesn't invoke a particular script but it prints to
screen *how* it would invoke it.

And, if you want to know how a program is invoked, there is a very
simple trick:  Temporarily replace this program by a script which
simply prints its argument vector to screen.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for this interesting informations. To me, the script looked
rather understandable except ths need for fixwin() which is indeed
unintuitive as you say. Anyway, by a funny coincidence, I was just
beginning to think the os.spawn may well be the culprit just before I
read your mail. More about this in a few lines.

> If you replace "--[[" by "---[[", i.e. prepending an extra hyphen, the

> 
Well, we did it and the results were ok, but it didn't explain us
anything: it just told us where the problem isn't...

Now, here is what I believe is the really minimal example of this
problem. This example assumes you have acrord32 in your path and it's
adobe reader 9, and that presntation.pdf exists. It uses two files:

% wrapper.tlu
kpse.set_program_name("texlua")
os.spawn('texlua d:/mpg/program.tlu')
-- os.execute('texlua d:/mpg/program.tlu)

% program.tlu
os.execute ('acrord32 "d:\\mpg\\presentation.pdf"')
-- os.spawn ('acrord32 "d:\\mpg\\presentation.pdf"')

Now this is the only sequence (spawn then execute) that makes the
problem happen. Every other sequence does work (spawn -> spawn, execute
-> execute, execute -> spawn). For some reason kpse needs to be
initilised to exhibit the problem but I believe (without being able to
prove is) that it could be reproduce with something else in lieu of kpse.

Now I think it's really time to ask the luatex people what they think of it.

Manuel.

Hi Angelo,

    It would be very annoying with the risk to forget something...

Yes, I was wrong.  I had in mind only changing
00texlive-installation.config, and hadn't realized that would only
recognize the name, not actually copy any binaries.

    - build
    - rename bin/i686-pc-cygwin to bin/i386-cygwin
    - move bin/i386-cygwin to /usr/local/texlive/2008
    - use 'install-tl' WITHOUT CHOOSING ANY BINARIES

Yes, good.

    Here the Cygwin binaries (without-xetex):
    http://www.webalice.it/angelo.graziosi/cygwin/texlive/texlive-20080816.pre_release.tar.lzma

Great, thanks.  I put a link to them on tug.org/texlive/doc.html.  I
think I'll wait to incorporate them into the release until we see if
XeTeX can be done -- there's a separate thread about that on the tlbuild list.

Best,
Karl

which now is the right link. Sorry for the noise.

I would simply treat this as other-nonfree. Either someone cares about
the package, then they have to dig through the details anyway, or no one
cares and it stays like this forever. 

What might be useful, though, is a possibility to indicate the reason
for sorting a package in one of the nonfree/nosell categories. I mean,
the "file" field is meant to contain one file, or the word "header"
(meaning the header of each single file covered). But there's no way to
indicate "header contradicts $file" or "README contradicts COPYING".

I first thought that leaving this empty could be used for this - but you
are right, an empty field can also mean "no one ever cared to fill that
in".

You mean, a web interface or similar?  It would have to be one with
authentication, and we shouldn't give access to too many people.  

It doesn't help us anything if after a year we find out that we really
need to re-check these other 213 entries done by $random_contributor
because we found that number 109 and 215 were checked too superficially
and the two entries are actually wrong.

Given that, I doubt that subversion is a big threshold. But I'm working
on Linux; maybe Windows or Mac users have a different view on this.

AOL. I never set up a wiki or even authenticated web service so far; I
have no idea of the security aspects, and I cannot promise any continous
administration support for anything I do.

Hi Manuel,
I'm not happy with fixwin() either, but for the time being it's at
least acceptable that there is only one function which takes care of
the quoting stuff and we don't have to use os.type everywhere in our
scripts.  It would be better, of course, if this piece of code could
be integrated into luatex and I already discussed it with Taco in
Cork.  He will do it if, and only if, someone points him to any
specification provided by Microsoft which clearly explains how the
arguments passed to execvpe() are processed before they are passed to
the child process.  If this is not clearly specified, it's at least
not unlikely that different versions of Windows behave differently.

Thus, if anybody knows more, let us know.

But it's good to know that the wrapper is not the culprit, though.

And even if there's something clearly specified... I heard funny things
recently about how MicroSoft "implements" the ntfs spec, though they wrote it
themselves...

> But it's good to know that the wrapper is not the culprit, though.

Hum, actually, it sort of is. I don't mean the wrappers should be written
another way, and I don't see any solution, but the fact remains that if you run

texlua c:\path\to\texdoc.tlu texlive-en

it works, but not (with AR9 on certain windows installations) if you run

texlua c:\path\to\tl-w32-wrapper-script.tlu texdoc texlive-en

It all boils down to the following:

% wrapper
kpse.set_program_name("texlua")
os.spawn {"texlua", "c:\\tmp\\program.tlu"}

% program
os.execute {"acrord32", "c:\\tmp\\pdf-file.pdf"}

(with acrord32 supposed to be in the path and to be AR9, and pfd-file.pdf an
existing pdf file). I run

texlua wrapper.tlu

and AR crashes badly (internal error). If I either:
- run another viewer in place of acrord32, or
- remove the first line of wrapper.tlu, or
- change the seconde line to use os.execute

it works.

I forwarded this example to the luatex maintainers, but Hans cannot reproduce
the problem with his machine. I'll try installing luatex 0.29 on my windows to
see if the luatex version explains that Hans has no problem while everyone
here does.

Since it looks like you know the story of os.spawn better than I do, if you
have any idea, be welcome.

Manuel.

(a) i've ignored the supposed syntax/semantics of that entry; is anyone
ever going to auto-process it?  if there's no licence info, it behoves
us to point out that we've really looked at all the files in question
(i've been putting "*"), and if there is more than one file with
relevant information, it's again useful to record every name

(b) i've asked jim to add a "notes" field (or tag or whatever these
things are called) to the licence entry in the catalogue dtd, so that we
_can_ record the details of the deduction

(c) at karl's request, i've added a "noinfo" licence category; "noinfo"
means "we really can't find any hints about how the author wanted this
stuff distributed"; previously "unknown" meant either "there's no
information", or "we can't make sense of what there is" (the idea is
that "unknown" eventually disappears, and all previously unknown
packages become either noinfo or one of the existing explicit one
(typicall other-nonfree).

there are fewer than 1000 "unknown" items, so i expect i'll be done
before end 2010 (if i'm still around by then...).

widnoze people have tortoise svn, which all our secretaries at work deal
with quite happily (we do the lab website this way); i don't know how
these things are dealt with on macs.

i'm sure i could set up a wiki (there's a fair amount of experience
here, since all the eager young research students seem to think that
writing documents (like web pages) is "like, so un-cool, man".

however, setting up a wiki that would survive me retiring (nominal 2014,
unless i get retired for ill-health), would be more tricky...

on another matter, what would you recommend about things that _say_
they're gpl, or whatever, but don't fulfill any of the trivial
requirments (like a copyright statement).  my reaction is to scream
quietly at the author, and to take the statement at its word.  but is
the statement actually valid?

Hi

I have a directory in which I have all my extra fonts. I want to use these fonts in XeTeX easily so I must "fc-cache" them.

When I was using MiKTeX, it had a localfonts.conf in c:\users\fnsteed\AppData\local\MiKTeX\2.7\fontconfig\config( I am using Vista). This localfonts.conf (Please refer to Michel Goossens's The XeTeX companion )contains information about where fc-cache goes and finds fonts. Does TL 2008 have some file which plays the same role?

Thanks!

Too late for the release, but:

The xstring package requires xstring.tex to be \input by xstring.sty.
Thus xstring.tex should be in texmf-dist/tex/generic/xstring/
rather than doc/latex/xstring/

    on another matter, what would you recommend about things that _say_
    they're gpl, or whatever, but don't fulfill any of the trivial
    requirments (like a copyright statement).  my reaction is to scream
    quietly at the author, and to take the statement at its word.  but is
    the statement actually valid?

IMHO yes.  

If the author has stated their intended license (even if just on the
CTAN upload form, which I know is not uncommon :(), and we don't see
anything to *contradict* the statement, we should go with it.  We would
be in dire straits indeed if we required full legal rules, correct
copyright statements in every source file, etc.

I don't know that there's even been a court case about it, but it seems
rational to me.  And hey, if an author comes back and says, "you bozos,
I didn't mean you could actually sell my work", fine, we remove it then.

Hello,

I just installed TeXLive 2008 on one of the machines at work. Home machine under Windows XP is already upgraded. Great work! Thanks to all!

I installed from the 2008-08-22 DVD image. Everything went fine so far. Now I tried to update my TeXLive installation with the online update mechanism. Following problems occured:

- tlmgr gui starts the GUI, but then I cannot enter anything, just the selection of selection boxes and placing the cursor works. But I cannot edit anything. I assume this is a problem with Perl-TK? I use SuSE Linux 11.0, unfortunately there is no SuSE under http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk

I assume that the online update does not work hast to do with our proxy. Under SuSE yast2 I've set proxy server inclusive user name and password. In addition, I have the following files

I usually wouldn't bother you (plural) with a failed install, but seeing how recent TeX 
Live 2008 is, I figured you might be interested.

I was trying to install TeX Live 2008 on my Quad G5 running Yellow Dog linux 6.  
`./install-tl' seems to have a conniption about 64-bit PowerPC Linux, as the following 
shows:

	[root at localhost install-tl]# ./install-tl -v
	TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1042.
	./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.powerpc64-linux --help failed (status 32512): No 
such file or directory
	Output is:
	Can't exec "./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.powerpc64-linux": No such file or 
directory at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1045.
	Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
	Cannot continue with installation.
	Please report to texlive at tug.org.

I suspect that the same does not happen under OS X since neither Tiger nor Leopard truly 
supports 64-bit PowerPC in the first place.

This snag aside, please convey my thanks to all who have kept TeX Live the definitive 
resource for one-stop package installation for so long.

Message-ID: <48BFFBE3.5040300@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear Colleagues -- Is there a (presumably low-volume)
TL-Announce list on which changes to the TeX Live kit
at CTAN is announced ?  I would like to ensure that my
local (Rsync'd) copy is kept up-to-date, but don't
want to run Rsync unless I know there is something new
to fetch ...

And an unrelated (really, CTAN) question : what is the
recommended set of parameters to Rsync in order to keep
a local copy up-to-date, whilst only reporting what
has actually been modified ?  After experimenting, I am
currently using

	Rsync rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/ . -r -t --stats -q -i

but in the absence of any TL updates I cannot prove
that it works !

this does not compute, in my tiny brain.  istm that the purpose of a
mirror operation is to provide a moderately low-cost means of checking
whether there's something needs doing; rsync doing nothing transfers
nothing other than a file list.  for (just) the texlive tree, that's
unlikely to break any but the most parsimonious banks, i would think.

but maybe you've got a very serious bandwidth limitation?

for my mirror (of the whole of ctan) to my local disc, i have

  rsync -larv --delete rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/ /local/ctan/tex-archive/

which has served me well for a long time.  note the --delete, which is
important for ctan-as-a-whole (where things are for ever getting deleted
or replaced by things with different names); it probably wouldn't do
anything much for a texlive-only mirror.

No, it was more a methodological/philosophical
issue than one related to resources.  I just
thought that there must be a TL-Announce list !

OK, I'll give that a whirl and see what (if anything)
it tells me, but this does re-raise the first issue :
unless I know that something in the TL repository has
changed, I can't know whether Rsync is giving me the
right answers !

Having finally managed to gain access to

if Rsync messed up permissions, but I got
"Access is denied" until I re-permissioned
the entire TeX directory hierarchy), I am
now performing a local install on a different
machine.  On this one, I edited the default
directory from "C:/Program files/<etc>/2008"
to "F:\TeX\Live\2008", leaving the cursor
at the end of my change (F:\TeX\Live\);
the OK button would then do nothing until
I re-positioned the cursor at end-of-text :-(

none of the problems that beset the network

I wonder, therefore, whether the FC-Cache problems
result in part from a network install ?  Or whether
my earlier work, re-permissioning the entire
TeX directory hierarchy, enabled FC-Cache to complete.

B at gg@r.  I didn't remove the --delete, and I didn't
think that a Win-32 port of Rsync would be case-
sensitive.  It has just deleted my entire "Archive"
contents (the entire install base for TeX Live)
because CTAN calls it "archive" .....

B at gg@r b at gg@r b at gg@r.  I /hate/ case-sensitive

rsync has an option --dry-run (or -n):

|        This  tells  rsync  to  not  do any file transfers,

I assume that you have some more lines in your install-tl.log _after_
 "Running fc-cache -v -r", right?

No, I have always that problem when installing from my local mirror.
I do not understand what does it mean "re-permissioning the entire TeX..."
texmf-var tree is writable anyway, e.g., for regenerated map files, 
formats, etc.
Anyway, running fc-cache -v -r again _after_ installation works well.

Er, only what was sent : that was a direct copy/paste
of everything from "Installing: zwgetfdate" to end.
Is there something missing, just after "Running fc-cache -v -r"
and before "running mktexlsr F:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf-dist F:/TeX/Live/2008/texmf" ?

F:\TeX is the root of everything TeXxie on this system.
Earlier today I could not run "Install-TL", "Wget",
"Perl" or anything else : "Access is denied".  To
get around this, I had to chance from "Simple file
sharing" to (tacit) "Complex file sharing", and
then recursively grant myself (a system administrator)
full access to F:\TeX and everything thereunder.

Do you mean output in cmd window or install-tl.log file?
My install-tl.log contains more messages for all postinstall things.

Ah, from the CMD window; perhaps that should contain,

Subject: [tex-live] license question
Message-ID: <g9potp$bci$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi,

on behalf of the German speaking hyphenation pattern development team
I'd like to ask a question regarding a licensing issue.

We plan to licence our results under different licenses:

(i) the LaTeX package dehyph-exptl with hyphenation patterns under
    LPPL,

(ii) the underlying list of hyphenated words and scripts to
     generate patterns under a copyleft flavoured license.

There's no problem with (i), however for (ii) we're unsure what exact
licence to chose.  I think GPL is more aiming towards software, whereas
some documentation oriented licenses, like GFDL, pose problems to, e.g.,
Debian.  Note, a word list might be the basis for other applications
than word hyphenation, e.g, spell checking.

Now, I fear a word list is neither software nor documentation, but some
sort of a database.  Are there already word lists distributed by TeX
Live or CTAN, e.g., as sources to hyphenation patterns?  Any idea how to
handle such a beast from a licence point of view?  We've thought about
Creative Commons BY-SA, but I've been surprised that CTAN doesn't
provide to chose that among the licences labelled "free".  Is CC-(BY-)SA
considered free by the CTAN and TeX Live teams?  Better suggestions for
a licence?

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

      rsync -larv --delete rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/ /local/ctan/tex-archive/

FWIW, -a implies -l and -r.

What I use for the CTAN -> tug mirror
(http://tug.org/texlive/pkgupdate.html) is:
nice /usr/local/bin/rsync -avz --exclude='.in.*' --exclude=.htaccess \
 --delete --delete-excluded \
  rsync://ctan/path/here
  . 

For purposes of mirroring just TL, the excludes are irrelevant (and
hence --delete-excluded too), and the `z' is also useless since the
files are already maximally compressed.  Leaving the same as what Robin
has, actually:

  rsync -av --delete rsync:///tl/path/here .

(Of course the -v is to taste, too.)

    Dear Colleagues -- Is there a (presumably low-volume) TL-Announce
    list on which changes to the TeX Live kit at CTAN is announced ?

No.  We will be updating packages more or less continuously, so it would
not be low-volume (and would be a major headache to do).

If we make any major changes to the infrastructure code, we'll announce
that in the usual places.

    I would like to ensure that my local (Rsync'd) copy is kept
    up-to-date, but don't want to run Rsync unless I know there is
    something new to fetch ...

rsync is probably faster than any other program at discovering that.
I advise simply running it daily and not worrying about it.  I doubt
your bandwidth is in such short supply, given that you're mirroring it
at all.

I did update a few packages yesterday.  They have probably made it
around to most mirrors by now.

Phil, that's you who asked for putting that output into install-tl.log :-)
In my opinion there are already too much messages on-screen, so we have 
the TeX Live Guide for that.

So which priviledges you have as the system administrator? Bizarre!
On my win xp (as sysadmin) I can write everywhere, the same on linux.

I don't want to start such discussion, but windows are half-way (horror!)
in that, eg. i can run: ren BlaBla.tex bLAbLA.TEX and dir (or ls) will
show me a new name :-)

>   fc-cache: failed
So we again prooved that. For some misterious reason fc-cache fails
*during* installation. That problem was already discussed with Akira,
Jonathan and others, but as far nobody knows why it fails.
Running fc-cache *after* installation is recommended and such information
will appear on TeX Live bugs page (thanks to Karl).

Anyway, can somebody investigate that, please? Something wrong with
running fc-cache as sub-sub process on Windows?

On Unix, that is indeed the very last message that install-tl outputs.

Message-ID: <200809042354.m84NsBk29098@f7.net>

Hi,

Thanks for the report.

    `./install-tl' seems to have a conniption about 64-bit PowerPC Linux, 

No one came forward to provide binaries for that platform
(http://tug.org/texlive/build.html) -- just regular 32-bit powerpc-linux
(thanks to Thomas Schmitz).  So, they are not present.  So the error
message is not surprising:

	Can't exec "./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.powerpc64-linux": No
	such file or directory

If the 32-bit binaries would work (which I suppose they would?), I think
you could run  cp tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.powerpc{64,}-linux
and it could proceed.  You'd have to manually select the ppc-linux
binaries from the menu during the installation.

Perhaps we should figure out a way to forcibly tell the installer what
arch name to use.

OK, all other points noted, but let me respond
to this one.  Do you not think that those who
have installed TeX Live 2008 (the same is true
for all earlier versions, but let's deal with
futures rather than the past) would like to
know whenever a component that they have
installed has been updated ?  I can understand
(and accept) that at the granularity of
individual files the overheads would be
excessive, but TeX Live isn't really a
file-based system.  Would it not be possible
to announce updates at the granularity of
schemes and collections ?

That is exactly what tlmgr update --list is for.

    Would it not be possible to announce updates at the granularity of
    schemes and collections ?

No.  Every package update changes its containing collection and
scheme(s).

To a first approximation, nearly everything that comes through ctan-ann
results in a package update.  That is the best source of announcements.

	11.0)

Message-ID: <200809050019.m850JxF13099@f7.net>

Hi Torsten,

Thanks for the report.

    - tlmgr gui starts the GUI, but then I cannot enter anything, just
      the selection of selection boxes and placing the cursor works. But
      I cannot edit anything. I assume this is a problem with Perl-TK? 

So it would seem.

      I use SuSE Linux 11.0, unfortunately there is no SuSE under
      http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk

That list is just what people have told us so far, we (I) can hardly
check out every distro in the world :).  Can you tell us what the
command is for SuSE?  (Well, I guess you already have it installed, so
I guess this is irrelevant.)

I can only suggest installing the original Perl::TK from CPAN in case
SuSE modifications are somehow interacting badly with TL, or (easier)
forget about the gui tlmgr ... or maybe Perl::TK doesn't work right on
SuSE in the first place?  I have no info one way or the other.

    .wgetrc: --proxy-user="sct2si1" --proxy-password="xxxxxxxx"
    --proxy="http://10.4.102.12:8080"

Ah.  Try setting an environment variable named TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS to those
arguments, plus -q -O (at the end), as in:

TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS='--proxy-user="sct2si1" --proxy-password="xxxxxxxx" --proxy="http://10.4.102.12:8080" -q -O'
export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS

(or setenv if you use [t]csh, but I expect you knew that. :)

If this works, I'll write something about it in the docs.

I added the message
    FcDirCacheValid(dir) returned FcFalse.

The error does not mean the write permisssion error.
It means that after a check of consistency, fontconfig
determined that the cache was invalid. Thus fontconfig
removed the created cache file.
I don't know why fc-cache creates invalid caches in the
installation process.

I also have later failures of fc-cache, not just during
post-install. This isn't news.

And I have had `access denied' errors under vista on my very own

however, it doesn't cover all changes.  we quite often have minor
updates (particularly, but not exclusively of docs) where the author
asks "no announcement".

note that regardless of the author's stated desire, we *always* announce
new packages, and we negotiate with the author if the update "looks like
a major change" (to us).

It would be nice if the very first update was announced. So far tlmgr
update --list returns nothing (either there is really nothing or
update part does work well; while the latter is unlikely the
announcement of *the*first*update* would be nice)

But to where are these announcements sent, Robin
(to which list(s), I mean) ?  It seems to me
(and I can sense that Karl will disagree) that
the first recommendation on installing TeX Live
should be to subscribe to the TL-Announce list, where
"important announcements concerning TeX Live" will
be sent [1].  As Victor has just suggested, the
first of these could be the first post-22-Aug-2008
change, and that could be accompanied by a
suggestion to run "tlmgr update --list" on
a regular basis.  I, like many (most ?)
TeX Live users, have read nothing beyond the
basics of how to get and install it : subtleties
such as "tlmgr update --list" are somewhere
deep in the documentation that few of us will
ever bother to read.

Ah, I have just found the TeX Live Guide,
and I am currently /trying to/ read the
section on "Sample tlmgr command-line invocations"
(HTML version).  Could someone please tell
me why the prose is in something resembling
five point [1]?  It /might/ be legible to a

I notice that the PDF version of the documentation

Which is correct, and will the other work ?

you snipped out the clear indication in my message that we send messages
to ctan-ann

fwiw, even with partly-auto-generated messages (our upload daemons write
them, mostly), sending ctan-ann messages is a big deal.

so i, for one, can quite understand karl not wanting to send a message
to a proposed new list for every footling change.

On my Win XP system, the C:\Windows\Fonts directory
had both ttf and otf versions of some fonts (probably
as a result of successive updates to Adobe Apps).  After
I moved the .ttf versions to a subdirectory the errors
stopped.

Fc-cache is run by a number of other systems (MiKTeX,
Gimp, Inkscape), but more silently.  I found some evidence
in logs that the same error was occuring for the other systems.

the first three of which appeared to generate

between the three forms that work, because if
TLM accepts some of these in only some contexts,
it will lead to confusion ...

But what exactly does "tlmgr update --list" do ?
Does it compare the actual files I have in my
TeX hierarchy with those on CTAN, or does it
compare their modification dates ?  Can it
detect if I have accidentally deleted one
(or many) ?  Will it report new packages,
or changed packages, or both, and so on.

Hello,

some days have elapsed since the release of TL2008, and it seems that
Heise's newsticker was the only major site to note the event. You might
like to know that I wrote an article for its German main IT news site
which was later translated into English and Polish.

http://www.heise.de/newsticker/TeX-Distribution-TeX-Live-2008-veroeffentlicht--/meldung/115367

Perhaps next year we could inform more media about the next release.

Subject: [tex-live] Overlength line in TLMGR -- help
Message-ID: <48C10EA8.2010708@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

The line

              tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/YYYY
....+....!....+....!....+....!....+....!....+....!....+....!....+....!....+....!....

is about 84 characters long, and in a standard 80-character
window the string "/YYYY" wraps to the start of the next line.
As, in some operating systems, "/" introduces a command
qualifier, this is likely to lead to some ambiguity in
interpreting the output.  Could I suggest that this line
abbreviate some of the earlier options, as in

              tlmgr opt loc http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/YYYY

I notice that the output of TLMGR --help makes
references to an "arch" [1] without explaining what
an "arch" is.  I am completely unfamiliar with
this term in anything other than architectural
contexts, so can only surmise that it is an
abbreviation for "archive".  If that is the case,
is there any reason not to use the word "archive",
since I suspect that many (most ?) users of
TLMGR will be as unfamiliar with the usage as I am.

Hell no! That is our job as TL maintainers: we have scripts that attempt to do
so, but they definitely need a human coprocessor to achieve a (somehow)
reliable result. One of the main purpose of the TL package architecture is be
an interface between CTAN and what's on your HD. (And as you'll probably
noticed, CTAN didn't freeze for TL release, but tlmgr update --list still
outputs nothing for now...)

The truth is, it will load your local texlive database, load the remote one,
and do something like

for each local package
  if the version in the remote database is greater than the local version
    print
  end fi
end for

What do you mean, accidentally? ;-) No, it won't try to detect this.

As the name "update" suggests, it will list packages that are installed, but
for which a newer version is available in the TL repository.

tlmgr is written in perl and makes use of Getopt::Long. This is a
small part of quite a long documentation of that package:

Options can have values, the value is placed after the option
character. Sometimes with whitespace in between, sometimes not:

    -s 24 -s24

Due to the very cryptic nature of these options, another style was
developed that used long names. So instead of a cryptic C<-l> one
could use the more descriptive C<--long>. To distinguish between a
bundle of single-character options and a long one, two dashes are used
to precede the option name. Early implementations of long options used
a plus C<+> instead. Also, option values could be specified either
like

    --size=24

or

    --size 24

The C<+> form is now obsolete and strongly deprecated.

Anofher comment of mine: it often works with a single dash, i.e.

-size 24

will work but

-size=24

will not work.

Yes, Getopt::Long accepts unambiguous abbreviation. If your
abbreviation is ambiguous, it will display an error message showing
all possibilities. You will thus know how many characters are
mandatory.

man 1 bash

option processing.  Any arguments after

OK, I didn't really mean CTAN, of course; I meant
the TLNET bit of CTAN ...

OK, so is there a TLMGR option with semantics
"check integrity of local TL (2008) installation" ?

OK again, but if a new package were to appear, should it
not tell me about it (and offer to install it) ?  If (say)
I have elected not to install French, German and Polish,
then I wouldn't expect to be told when they changed, but
if a new language Serbo-Slavo-Teutonic were to appear,
I would like to told about it next time I run
TLMGR update --list

It would indeed be good to have the word architectures in the long description
rather than "arches".

Ah, I have learned something :-)  Many thanks, Manuel,
and yes, I would strongly support a change along the
lines of

 >>     arch add <architecture>
 >>             Add executables for the specified architecture(s) to the installation.

but only if I have parsed that first line correctly;
as it is currently written, it is impossible to tell
whether the first and/or second "arch" is notion or
metanotion ...

I am sure you'll be able to find a list without traffic.  The Microsoft
way does not involve TeX.

Uh, we are still talking about Windows here?  Hint: the term "DLL hell"
does not originate on Unix.  And it is not Unix where the operating
system tries plastering back over libraries that some installation
process decided it needed to replace.

Oh, that kind of sanity.  Can come pretty expensive nowadays.

I would also welcome a separate list where you can fantasize about
Windows superiority all you want to.  The people doing the actual hard
work about making things work on Windows might still prefer to
communicate in a less delusional and more work-focused atmosphere.

Hi Karl,

Thanks for the suggestions. One problem is solved: 

    		- tlmgr gui starts the GUI, but then I cannot enter
anything, just
      	the selection of selection boxes and placing the cursor works.
But
      	I cannot edit anything. I assume this is a problem with Perl-TK?


	So it would seem.

      	I use SuSE Linux 11.0, unfortunately there is no SuSE under
      	http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk

	That list is just what people have told us so far, we (I) can
hardly
	check out every distro in the world :).  Can you tell us what
the
	command is for SuSE?  (Well, I guess you already have it
installed, so
	I guess this is irrelevant.)

Perl-Tk from SuSE 11.0 works fine EXCEPT when you have installed scim,
scim-m17n, skim. After deinstalling these Chinese Input Method packages
(I don't need them, just installed *everything* from the DVD) everthing
is fine with tlmgr gui and input/editing of text.
With the other problem I am a little bit further down to a solution: I
am now using

export http_proxy='http://sct2si1:xxxxxxxxx at 10.4.102.12:8080'
export ftp_proxy='http://sct2si1:xxxxxxxxx at 10.4.102.12:8080'
export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS='-c'  (-q -0 didn't work, quiet?, 0?)

The problem with the original command line you suggested, Karl, was that
there are special characters in my passwd which were not correctly
passed to wget. With obove environment variables my normal wget on a
command line works fine.

So, the package download works for one or two files and then dies. This
probably has to do with our proxies (but I cannot change them;-(). So,
is there any command line flag which I can give to tlmgr to try harder?

It would be fine if the same solution would work under Windows (where
tlmgr gui is standard) too. So I suggest an additional command line
paramter or configuration option for those poor people behind a proxy.

Rolf, could you send me your proxy parameters by private mail?
Sometimes, it just needs a proxy adress without authentication
(authentication implicitly based on MAC-adresses), but we have a user
password based scheme. Would be interesting to know what PTB uses or how
it can be made working here.

tlmgr isn't bash and bash doesn't process options for other
programs. It's the task of the program which kind of syntax
it uses for its options.

Also '---help' isn't '--', the marker '--' is an argument of its own.
Thus some white space is needed to separate the marker from the
following stuff.

However tlmgr uses Getopt::Long:
| use Getopt::Long qw(:config no_autoabbrev require_order);

This perl package supports the convention, that an argument '--'
stops option processing of GetOptions.

The settings 'no_autoabbrev' and 'require_order' mean:

| auto_abbrev Allow option names to be abbreviated to
|             uniqueness.  Default is enabled unless envi?
|             ronment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set,
|             in which case "auto_abbrev" is disabled.

| require_order
|             Whether command line arguments are allowed to
|             be mixed with options.  Default is disabled
|             unless environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT
|             has been set, in which case "require_order" is
|             enabled.

'-help' works, because the feature "bundling" is not enabled.
"bundling" means, that short one-character options may be
merged together, e.g. "-h -e" could be given as "-he".
The price, long options must then be preceded by '--' to avoid
ambiguity.

Yours sincerely

I would assume this is the job of a pager, not of tlmgr. I hope your favorite
(non-)operating system does provide a pager and a way to pipe the output of a
command into it :-)

OK, just now it reported which packages could be updated. Then
% sudo tlmgr update --all
it did the job (so update works)

Ah, different philosophy, Manuel : in the Windows
world, each program is (expected to be) self-contained,
so each would (in an ideal world) provide paging
by itself rather than being dependent on being
executed as part of a chain ...

but you can't find servers to hold your files because they're so
unnecessarily much larger than the lzma compressed versions.

why not migrate to miktex?  i find it a jolly good distribution, and
there's seldom anything on the mailing list that relates to non-widnoze
stuff.

of course, christian, who's no idiot, _does_ pay attention to licensing
(he certainly removes package in response to notices from me about
licences moving to non-free).  but you can't have everything.

(btw, since you don't care about licences, would you clone a copy of
your windows installation disc for me, please?)

Then you shouldn't use TeX, it isn't self-contained, because
it does not include neither an editor nor an viewer. ;-)

I think the programs in the Windows world are not expected to be
dependent on being executed as part of a chain because they are supposed
to come with their own balls and chains.

Those are the install schemes: when you run the installer, you can
either select your own collections manually, or choose a scheme. The
default is to use scheme-full (that is, install everything).

It's a scheme prepared by the French TeX users group. As every other
scheme, it is specific to the TL installer, so it's not surprising CTAN
doesn't know about it.

Thanks! One of short-coming of TLMGR is that there seem to be no way
to get list of new packages (except  something like)
%tlmgr list | egrep -v "^i|binary|00|win32|wintools|scheme-"

It seems to be rather tedious for TL team to repack all package
submissions, especially because some authors have their own superior
but non-standard understanding how submission should look).

BTW TL2008 installs beamer in a bit messy way: in what  got from sourceforge
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/beamer/
looks like
base            emulation       extensions      lyx
solutions       themes
with many .sty occupying top level in TL2008 put in base

Indeed, I think it is something reasonable to add to the wishlist for
the future of tlmgr (and tlmgr gui). While I do like the Unix philosophy
of small bricks which can build something together, I also think that in
general it's best if the developers assemble the bricks for the user. In
other terms, one should not ask to every one to be able to use grep...

Anyway, and probably other members of the team will agree, it's hard
even with moths of testing to think to everything and user feedback is
most welcome for features that would be useful to add (esp. if they are
not to hard to implement :-) ).

I think you got it! And there's also human error, etc.

Indeed we move everything in base to the top level. Does it hurt in any
way? (Btw I'm not sure why we do this, either.)

Don't know, don't think that it actually matter. However it hurts
feeling to those who see it first time. I left my old in texmf-local -
it is more tidy.

Thank  you for the links. Is it true that xeTeX is an enhancement of
pdftex? I always believed that it does not support pdftex's
microtypographical enhancements (i.e. charakter protusion et al.)

It was developped originally for software, but I don't see a reason at
all not to use it for documentation. And it's being used for that, too.

In other words, it would again become part of a programmatical work
("software" in your terminology).

I don't know about the CTAN or TeX Live opinion on that (if there's
one), and I don't even know what debian-legal thinks about it. But you
can find some information on criticism, also by Debian, of the CC
licenses on

I am slowly assembling a collection of useful

frustrated by the information disappearing from
the screen at end-of-job.  I then remembered that
CMD has a go-on token ("&"), so all my shortcuts
now end "& pause".  I thought that this idea might

but it does:

2008/08/14 |        491 | systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/scheme-gutenberg.tar.lzma

extract tlpkg/tlpobj/scheme-gutenberg.tlpobj from that file, and you'll

No, XeTeX is a variant of TeX that works internally in Unicode. Look
at http://www.csug.cz (sorry, in Czech only) and find a link to
XeTeX.avi, it is the video of Jonathan Kew's lecture on XeTeX (of

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with tlmgr online update behind proxy (SuSE
	11.0)
In-Reply-To: <9AACBC7C716DB749B7A0247D4B63C24F016A9075@SI-Mail08.de.bosch.com>
Message-ID: <200809052321.m85NLuK04009@f7.net>

    Perl-Tk from SuSE 11.0 works fine EXCEPT when you have installed scim,
    scim-m17n, skim. 

Ok, thanks for that clue, I'll mention it.

    export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS='-c'  (-q -0 didn't work, quiet?, 0?)

Yes, the -q is just quiet, doesn't matter.

I'm not sure if the -c will help, hinder, or do nothing in this case.

But I believe the -O is necessary, because the code (TLUtils.pm, if you
want to look) appends various destinations after it.  Without it, the
download might have been successful but tlmgr won't realize it because
it's not in the expected location.  (I am having trouble detecting
whether that is actually what is happening in your case, but it's at
least possible.)

    is there any command line flag which I can give to tlmgr to try harder?

It looks to me like your download was successful.  But if you want it to
try downloading more before it gives up, you could add --tries=20 to
TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS.
  
See the wget documentation for all the other myriad options influencing
this, if need be.

    Is there any difference between the three forms that work, 

No.  They all execute the same function.

For tlmgr and other TL infrastructure programs, and many TeX world
programs, including tex itself, you can use either -foo or --foo; they
mean the same.

When an option works without any - is considerably more variable and I
can't think of any useful generalization to state.  (Obviously in many
cases a cmdline arg with no - is an actual parameter to the program,
like a filename, not anything like an option.)

    (ii) the underlying list of hyphenated words and scripts to
         generate patterns under a copyleft flavoured license.

I very strongly suggest using the GPL(v2 or later).
There is no problem with using the GPL for anything for which "source"
can be identified -- clearly not an issue here.  (More difficult for,
say, a sculpture. :)  Many TeX packages are already released under the GPL.

By contrast, nothing else significant on CTAN or in TeX uses any of the
CC licenses, that I'm aware of.  Certainly it is extremely rare, at
most.  Believe me, this is ground you do not want to break ... and there
is nothing to be gained from it, that I can see.

    I've been surprised that CTAN doesn't provide to chose that among
    the licences labelled "free".

As I understand it (and hope to be the case), the purpose of that
dropdown is to show licenses that are actually commonly used in the TeX
world, and that are recommended in the TeX world.  CC-(BY-)SA fails both
tests.

(There are many licenses in the tree that are not in that dropdown.)

    Is CC-(BY-)SA considered free by the CTAN and TeX Live teams?  

Yes, since the FSF does so, but I urge you (and everyone) not to use it
for software or documentation.  (Other CC licenses are nonfree.)
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html 

As far as I know, CC itself recommends using the GPL for software, not
CC-anything.

You should not need to install a *test* release at this point. TL 2008
has been released, as has MacTeX 2008. The latter does indeed do the
work of setting things up to play nicely with the switching mechanisms.

With this it is easy: just put into  tlmgr --help couple of recipes
(sorry for Windows users but I am not the member of PETMU  [People for

%tlmgr list | egrep -v "^i|binary|00|win32|darwin|wintools|scheme-"

There is a more challenging trick for tlmgr to do: to look to
texmf-local and private user trees
and advise (at this moment I do not see about actions)

* the package <foo> you have in texmf-local is newer/the same/older
than in /2008
* the package <foo>  you have in texmf-local is not in /2008 and
is/(is not) available remotely (again may be with info newer/the
same/older)
* the package foo you have in your user tree is newer/the same/older
than in /2008
* the package foo you have in your user tree is newer/the same/older
than in  texmf-local

Well, since packages in texmf-local and user tree are not installed by
tlmgr, tlmgr could say "seems to be".

But since the TL installer comes with its own (tiny) PERL,
and since PERL supports regular expressions, the second element
in your chain could just as easily be a call on PERL, which
would then work for all users, Windows and Lunix alike.

To be serious just for a second, there is a fundamental
difference : it matters not one jot whether the editor
and viewer run synchronously or asynchronously with
TeX (indeed, the editor should logically run asynchronously),
whilst a pager /must/ run synchronously.  As the average
Windows user is typically unaware of program chaining
via pipes, he or she will expect synchronous functionality
to be integrated in the base product, whilst Unix/Linux
(hereinafter Lunix) users almost invariably are familiar
with program chaining and will (almost) expect to have
to pipe through "more" if paged output is required.

Well, if you want tlmgr to be able to do this at least half reliably,
I'm afraid you need quite a lot of skills in AI. The reason why we use
our internal svn rev number as a criterion to determine age is that it's
really hard if not impossible to determine any other "more relevant"
version number (such as the author's "version string" or even last
update date).

Even in the LaTeX world where it is quite usual to provide the version
string and date as second argument to \ProvidesPackage, it's not easy to
determine them (think \def\fileversion{3.0a}, think svn/cvs/whatever id,
think multiple files..;) and there's the rest of the wild world...

So I'm afraid the answer is no, we won't try to do it, and the rule is
clear: if you install something locally, you're on your own and you're
responsible of keeping track of the distribution changes to make sure
whether you want to keep your local version, switch back to the dist
version, merge changes, etc.

Well, may be at least to tell user:

"You seem to have the package with the same name in texmf-local or
usertree and you have (don't have) it in the texmf-dist.Would you like
(to install such package into  texmf-dist  and) then compare files?"

It would be nice to have main sty or cls files open for inspection too.

Note this is scaled-down suggestion. Actually it could be even not
tlmgr but a completely different program (using tlmgr just to check
that the package is available remotely)

Subject: [tex-live] Updating texlive
Message-ID: <48C27DB2.6090302@alice.it>

After having installed texlive on Cygwin [1], we need an update...

Since I never used these things before, I ask some little help...

The first thing I did is:

$ tlmgr -location
ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 update -list
dvips: local: 9300, source: 10420
gmdoc: local: 10314, source: 10417
gmutils: local: 10317, source: 10416
gmverb: local: 10315, source: 10418

then

$ tlmgr -location
ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 update -all
update: dvips (first remove old, then install new)
remove: dvips
install: dvips
update: dvips done

update: gmutils (first remove old, then install new)
remove: gmutils

update: gmverb (first remove old, then install new)
remove: gmverb

running mktexlsr

mktexlsr: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-var/ls-R...
mktexlsr: Done.

Should I run other things or the above is ALL?

For example I do not see in the above output things like

regenerating fmtutil.cnf
running fmtutil-sys...

They need? How?

Cheers,
    Angelo.

the things you've downloaded don't seem to imply anything other than
what's been done.

not if the system works already.

Sorry, but I do not understood your conclusions. May you be more
explicit? Have you found problems with the binaries I produced? Which?

But there is probably something wrong with tex4ht, though.  I assume
it interpreted -- as an endash ligature.  But then I'm wondering why
it inserted a single hyphen instead.

class="ec-lmtk-10">tlmgr</span><span 
class="ec-lmtk-10">&#x00A0;-gui</span>

&#x00A0; is a non-breakable space, which is correct.

Hi Zdenek,
the auto-abbrev stuff had been disabled deliberately.  Suppose there
is an option --version and people invoke this program from their
scripts but abbreviate this option as --v.

In a later version of this program an option --verbose will be added.
Then all the scripts using --v will not work anymore.

It's also annoying if every program processes its options differently.

  Reinhard

The majority of TeX users I encounter would be surprised
to learn that (La)TeX on Windows can be invoked other
than from a button in WinEDT (or that there is any TeX but
MiKTeX).    To many users, TeX on Windows _is_
self-contained and provides .dvi and .pdf  viewing and
printing.  This world view is about to come crashing down
however, as their colleagues who use *X are now creating
.tex files with funny lines like:

%  -*- Coding: utf-8-unix -*-

I'm not sure TeX Live is for "the average Windows user".
The Cygwin port may prove more useful to the small
subset of Windows users who prefer to type "latex filename"
at a command prompt over clicking a "LaTeX" button.

Is it odd to be worrying about refining a user interface when
we don't even have a .dvi viewer?   Porting dvipsone and
dviwindo to Win32 would have far more significance for the
"the average Windows user".

IM(V)HO, DVI is dead as an output format; I haven't
used DVI for years, more-or-less since Thanh first
released PdfTeX.

Please invoke

  ftype | more

and press q in order to abort.  What happens then?

"The process tried to write to a non-existent pipe."

But I've never used "q" to terminate "more"; I always
Ctrl-C out of it ...

tlmgr will automatically run those when you will update things that make
regeneration the formats useful. As long as you update simple LateX
packages and binary not directly related to the formats, the formats
don't need to be regenerated.

I guess it's part of the problem : adapting correctly a dvi viewer to
integrate it in TL is no easy job, and given that dvi will probably be
definitely dead in a few years, well... hard to get motivated on
supporting a slowly dying thing.

I don't need a proxy, but during N. Am. working hours I can't download
more than a few packages at time (not just from CTAN, also CRAN, CPAN,
fedora, etc.).  The "solution" for me is to mirror the TL distribution
at night.
You can use "tlmgr --location <directory>" or use some internal http
server (very handy if you need to install on multiple systems).

Try editing the wgetrc that is provided with the TL2008 installer:

.../install-tl/tlpkg/installer/wgetrc

Some firewalls impose limits on bulk downloads. Wget has option to put
a delay ("--wait=seconds" and "--random-wait" options) between each
download.  Where I work, I can reliably download a single large file, but
multi-file downloads often fail.   If you decide to go the "mirror" route,
you can look for software that will rotate the downloads across several
servers (and also use multiple parallel sessions to reduce the overall time).

Hi Akira,
since it obviously doesn't, could you describe briefly how texdocc
invokes AR?  Do you use cmd.exe or one of the system calls like
execvpe()?  And which arguments do you pass to them?  How does the
system() or execvpe() call looks like?

\begin{alltt}
> \Ucom{tlmgr -gui}
\end{alltt}

I guess tex4ht considers spaces nonbreakable in alltt?  Dunno that part.

If this "operating system" would behave halfways predictable, the
title string should be consumed by the program called "start".  AR
shouldn't see it at all.  If it does, it's certainly due to a severe
bug in Windows.

I don't have enough time to read all emails I get very carefully, but
I'm now trying to follow the "texdoc error" thread more carefully.

What I've seen so far is not very promising:

Incidentally, while testing, I double-clicked on "minitoc.pdf", and
not only it but "t-lilypond.pdf" opened : "lilypond.pdf" is not even
in the same directory ...

There is no texdoc or any other TeX Live related script involved. Phil
just double-clicked on a PDF-file in the Widows Exploder.  This
example clearly proves that Windows is completely broken.  Or is it an

We all know that both Windows and Unix have their problems.  And both

Hi Karl,
I fear you missed the point.  It's horribly annoying that you always
only cite one line from a mail message and draw any conclusions from it.

Please read the whole message. 

I said:

There is no nagging about Windows.  I just said that there is a bug.
And I said that you can't make texdoc responsible for it because it's
not involved.

That's all.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I guess I have to forward you all the emails we exchanged internally
only about getting anything working on windows. If I count the emails
targetted only at windows, and those only targetted at all the unix
archs, you will see that windows is the chaotic one ...

You want to have all them to see how brain dead windows is??? I still
have all of them in a mail folder, about 2000+? You want to know how
brain dead windows is?

Hhahaha ... do you know how much problems we had getting stuff working
on w2k, xp, and vista???

Even better rubbish.

Please, go back to real life and don't disturb us with this type of
rubbish. Sorry.

I am currently busy putting together a TeX Live installation for our

I'm not so sure about it. Since obviously Phil tried this in the middle
of a texdoc+AR9 debugging session, you can reasonably assume that AR
remembered that a few minutes ago it was asked to open file A, but
couldn't since it crashed, and then when it opens file B, it also opens
file A because it previously stopped just in the middle of opening it.

I don't say this is for sure what happens, I just say that we can
imagine a somehow rational explanation.

Anyway, there's probably something at least half-wrong with AR9, but we
can't just ignore the fact that it is so reliably triggered by texdoc,
 or in fact by any two texlua scripts using os.spawn()...

Manuel.

Message-ID: <19af81400809070342t2e82ae0j12cb629aaa41f4e7@mail.gmail.com>

The question appeared on another (MacOSX) forum

 /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/tlpobj/fontinst.tlpobj

ends up with catalogue-version 1.928

while

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/fontinst/base/fontinst.sty

contains line

\def\fontinstversion{1.927}

Is there a contradiction?

My understanding is that those numbers have nothing to do with tlmgr:

%tlmgr update --list
returns

fontinst: local: 7340, source: 10426

and those numbers are for tlmgr but they are not stored in installed
packages. My understanding is that number 10426 reflects both
package-name and tlmgr-repacking-version.

Would be nice to have it clarified

Just to clarify : I am not using AR 9; I am using AR 8.1.2
and the really weird file that AR 8.1.2 opened at
the same time as Minitoc.pdf had never been opened
previously on this system ...

Yep, I couldn't remember exactly and was too lazy to look or type AR8/9
or AR8.1+. Anyway, the problem happens with AR9 on my windows box too,
and of the OP it was with AA9.

Ok. So much for my potential explanation.

On the most recent system on which I have
installed TL 2008,

	texdoc minitoc

does not provoke the error using AA 5.0.5

You are right - however it is exactly what was installed by tlmgr AFTER update
The files are really different

< \def\fontinstversion{1.927}

41c41

(and few lines more)


Probably TL team can clarify?

There should be a special mechanism to report:

"Dear TL team, there is a newer version of the package than you have on TeXLive"

Surely, no need to report if the update just came out but fontinst
1.928 dates by 2004 and 1.929 by 2005. BTW TL2007 also contains 1.927

And TL's installation of fontinst contains garbage:
  TDS:tex/fontinst/misc/glyphbox.log
  TDS:tex/fontinst/misc/glyphbox.dvi
(Also the DVI file is broken, the command bytes are messed up.)

your 1.929 is no doubt a local hack, but it's not possible to be
absolutely sure unless you provide us with a diff from the current ctan
copy.

or one could ask lars whether he's got a more recent copy than 1.928 in
his private store...

Message-ID: <48C3F6D1.20508@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear Colleagues -- Bearing in mind some reservations
that have been expressed concerning the use of "The
Pirate Bay" as the primary tracker for the TeX Live
2008 torrents, I have been looking into alternatives,
and it appears that the MAGNET URI might be sufficient
to allow the file to be located.   I am therefore
attempting to catalogue the files at Freebase.Be, but
Freebase requires certain additional facts that I do
not have.  Can anyone please advise me of the following,
for the main ISO file, the LZMA ISO file, and for MacTeX,
as RHASH, downloaded from SourceForge, produces no output
at all when let loose on the ISO file, although it copes
perfectly well with the torrent file (and I therefore
suspect it is incapable of dealing with such large files).

Fine.

Good! I would appreciate some clear-text documentation on this. I'll
have a look at the source files (the DTD or however this is called, my
checkout of the catalogue is helplessly outdated, so I won't check until
it's up-to-date again), but I doubt I'm the right person to parse
this...

So, should we stay with SVN, maybe adding a special README for license
auditing, where you can add your scribble notes?

In my experience, it's unfortunately very common that people want GPL
and say something is GPL, but don't bother to read the text to the end
and act according to the "How to apply..." section.  We should ask (and
try to educate) people, but if we were strict here...

catalogue.dtd contains info (even clear text) about the fields. AFAICS,
the notes field is not yet there. I've added a comment about the
non-syntax of the "file" field.

There are also differences in other files if you just compare version
1.928 (which CTAN has) and version 1.927 (which TL seems to have and
erroneously labels 1.928).

Hi,
this weekend I tried to read all the mails in this thread carefully
and I must admit that I'm not finished yet.  The results of your
experiments are extremely helpful, though sometimes confusing too.

It would help me a lot if you could try the attached wrapper script:

This file is supposed to replace tl-w32-wrapper.texlua temporarily
only for texdoc.  Please extract the file in bin/win32/ and adapt
texdoc.bat accordingly.  Make a backup copy of texdoc.bat before.
Does texdoc work as expected then?

I'm very interested in the result.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <3b8343640809071352y2df78e95s54ecdc1cd9a5f1b4@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm from Italy and new to this list. Let me first thank you for your
efforts in making the TeXLive distribution, which I'm using since
TL2005.

I'm no way a TeXpert, but I would help as I can. Since it seems
there's no Italian translation of the tlmgr GUI, I prepared one.

If another Italian user is here, please review the translation and
help me with advices and notice. I tag it as "Beta 1" while
waiting for a review.

I'm also preparing and Italian translation of the install GUI.

Thank you once again for your work and many greetings
from Italy!

Marco Pallante

Regarding fontinst, what is in TL is whatever was there several years
ago when Sebastian imported it.  I have never updated it, and doing so
will be a time-consuming and painful affair that I don't want to deal
with right now.  I didn't actually know there had been any changes.

In any case, it seems what we need first is to get the current version
(that was in tetex 3) onto CTAN.  Maybe you would like to write Lars
about it?  (He is not on this list, as far as I know.)

The reason it came up as "updated" now is simply because I moved the
fontinst executable to the fontinst package from the bin-tetex package.
I didn't actually change any fontinst files.

Phil,

    Can anyone please advise me of the following,
    for the main ISO file, the LZMA ISO file, and for MacTeX,
    as RHASH, downloaded from SourceForge, produces no output
    at all when let loose on the ISO file, although it copes
    perfectly well with the torrent file (and I therefore
    suspect it is incapable of dealing with such large files).

    ** Phil.
    --------
    SHA1
    ED2K
    TTH

I'm sorry, I am confused.  You mean you need an SHA1, ED2K and TTH
checksum for our iso's+mpkg?  SHA1 I can give you, but I've never heard
of ED2K or TTH.

(And I don't understand what sourceforge has to do with it?)

Thanks,
k

    There should be a special mechanism to report:

    My understanding is that those numbers have nothing to do with tlmgr:

That is correct.  Package versions are far too randomly formatted and
haphazardly applied to be of any use for updating purposes ...

    fontinst: local: 7340, source: 10426

... so these integers are simply the highest svn revision that applies
to any file in the package.  Completely unambiguous, easy to compute,
easy to compare :).

Some of the articles in tlpkg/doc talk about this (and other things) a bit.

I have just asked Google. ED2K is not a checksum but a protocol, see

But the fontinst.tlpobj does contain the version number of the package
(as well as the svn revision number), correct? If so, it should  be
1.927 rather than 1.928 to avoid confusion.

Of course, if it will be updated soon anyway,, this ma not really

    But the fontinst.tlpobj does contain the version number of the package
    (as well as the svn revision number), correct? 

The catalogue-version field contains what is in the Catalogue
(surprisingly enough), which explains the mismatch here.  There is no
way we can extract the author's version number.  (I am astonished and
grateful that Robin/CTAN does so.)

fontinst is an unusually complex and painful case.  I don't think such
discrepancies are at all common among more typical packages.

jim's way behind (it's the beginning of his academic year), and hasn't
documented the changes.  i need to remind him.  (in fact the dtd that i

sure.  that number arises from the catalogue.  the catalogue covers the
state of ctan, but tex live is supposed to be in step with ctan.
somehow the change to ctan (and hence the catalogue) happened without
the tex live people noticing.

we can but hope.  someone seems to have been asked to sort out what lars
thinks we ought to hold one on ctan.  once we have that, someone can
analyse what tex live actually holds, and provide a "dummy" for them to
start from.

Well, I don't think we really need to analyse that much what is
currently in TL. Once we're sure CTAN holds "The Right" version, we'll
just suck it from there.

But as Karl mentioned, some packages are harder than others to take from
CTAN and redispatch in TDS form and our architecture. And fontinst is
not one of the easiest...

I noticed that MikTeX has in addition to mpm (miktex package manager
which is similar to tlmgr) mpc
(miktex package creator) so probably authors can repack by themselves.
Should be a similar utility for tlmgr?

what do you mean?  elatex was renamed etoolbox: from the catalogue svn log:

the memoir distribution is confusing; i've asked peter to rearrange.

(this latest, very recent, update arrived while i was *very* ill, and i
made a mess of the installation.)

that was installed on ctan much later than the date would imply (again,
something i installed several days after being asked to install).

superseded by pst-pdf (we were explicitly asked to mark ps4pdf
obsolete).

these things rush by so quickly, it probably appeared and disappeared
before tl noticed.  there are at least two new ones...

Hi Victor,

    > 1) asymptote.sty, neither in TL, nor on CTAN, installs by asymptote

Aside from it not being on CTAN, installing a new program is not
trivial.  I've talked with the authors, it's all a long story.

Robin's answers explain some of the non-updates.  I've just now updated
the rest, except for pstool, which I will do tomorrow.  Give them a
couple days to propagate to the mirrors ...

There are approximately 60-70 updates backlogged from the time we froze.
We have not worked through those yet.  I'll send a note when I have done
so, so you don't have to spend your time reporting on anything recent.
Of course, reports of missing older updates, such as bbding, are always
welcome.

What I'm curious about is, how did you make this list?

Thanks,
k

asymptote.sty is quite useless without the asy binary (and not on CTAN
either, as Robin notes). We thought to integrate the asymptote binary,
but had no time for this release since binaries obviously take more time
to integrate, build everywhere and test.

The updates probably happened when we were already frozen for
pre-release. Since then, a big list of pending updates have accumulated,
so we need a bit more delay than usual to handle it.

*Very* weird: those files appear in my svn working copy, but not in the

Karl: any ideas why?


For the others, a common reason for not being in TL is licence problems
(or depending on something non-free). Another reason can be human error :-)

After I installed MacTeX2007 I was checking packages I used or I
thought to be of interest and if they were newer on CTAN I installed
them in texmf-local.

When MacTeX2008 came I made a cleaning and reported what was left.
Robin's answers allowed me to clean more.

    /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex4ht/bin/tex4ht.jar

I'm just copying them from the originals, I have no idea if they do
anything useful.

Of course could do the same for pax, but it was more complex than I
could deal with at the end of the release cycle.  We could conceivably
work on including it now, especially if Heiko wants it to happen.  H?

Although since it needs PDFBox, it seems it won't ever work as-is.  If
someone can download and install PDFBox, I doubt they'll have any
trouble with pax itself.  (We'd also have to figure out the wrapper
script to make it relocatable; I think that could be done, with enough
work.  It's always a matter of time.)

If pax actually involves an executable by that name it will conflict
with the BSD utility by that name. In the case of MacTeX,  at least,
it would take precedence over that utility due to the way MacTeX alters
PATH etc.

Clearly there are ways around this but it is a potential (additional)
complication...

This discussion raised a couple of questions for me and I wondered if
somebody could point me in the direction of the relevant documentation,
if any.

What are the criteria for inclusion in TL?

I gather that necessary conditions include:
1) presence on CTAN
2) free licence
3) non-obsolete
4) non-experimental or experimental with author's approval
but these obviously aren't sufficient so I wondered if there was a
policy statement somewhere.

For example,
http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/timetable/timetable.tex
is not in TL. I'm not suggesting it should be. It's just the first
example that comes to mind of a package which meets the four conditions
(I think) but isn't in TL.

Clearly, TL couldn't contain everything which met the four conditions
and I'm not suggesting it should try. I'm only curious about 5, 6, 7...

I also wondered which definition of 'free' TL works with.

Thanks,
cfr

    1) presence on CTAN
    2) free licence
    3) non-obsolete
    4) non-experimental or experimental with author's approval

Right.

The only other important criteria that come to mind are:
    5) it doesn't cause significant conflicts.

In other words, if J. Random Package happens to contain a file named, say,
"plain.tex", we aren't going to install it :).  We try to work with the
author to resolve conflicts.  Conflicts can happen in other ways too,
but are surprisingly rare.

Much more common is:
    6) we notice it.

In other words, I'm sure there are many things on CTAN which meet 1-4
and are not in TL simply because Sebastian did not notice them to
incorporate them.  Post-Sebastian, we have never even managed to look at
everything *in TL*, let alone everything on CTAN.  

So if there are things on CTAN which meet 1-5 and aren't in TL, report
it here.  

    http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/timetable/timetable.tex

That failed criteria #6 :).  I'll install it at some point.  Looks
rather nice, actually.

    I also wondered which definition of 'free' TL works with.

Short answer: the FSF's.
Long answer: see http://tug.org/texlive/copying.html and its links.

    Now building the document fails because it does not find 'ifxetex.sty'.
    Bu if I do not want XeTeX?

I have moved ifxetex to collection-latexrecommended from
collection-xetex.  We had a theory about why it was ok to be in
collection-xetex, but evidently the theory was wrong.

(ifpdf is also in latexrecommended, being part of oberdiek.)

Thank you for your answer, I'm glad I've helped the TeX community
a little. Now I'm looking around for finding a job, so I should have
some free time I could invest in more translations.

My request for reviews from Italians or Italian speakers is still valid,
of course!

Non sapevo che i miei concittadini avessero questa fama! Allora,

solo un po' di discesa e di fondo.

Qualche rudimento di scalata l'ho imparato un'estate di una dozzina
di anni fa, ma non ricordo praticamente nulla; mi piacerebbe ricominciare,
magari anche solo con un po' di trekking.

A presto,

'Obvious' in the sense that there are clearly things which meet 1-4 but
are not in TL.

Er... I didn't know that. Sorry.

But at the very least, you have to add the fifth condition which Karl
mentioned i.e. so that TL does not contain packages which introduce
name conflicts, correct? Such as the exams and exam packages (which
aren't relevant for licence reasons, I know).

I don't provide a binary, just the .jar file and the LaTeX package.
In README I recommend a wrapper script for the Java call.
However I don't know a good name. Suggestions?
I don't mind a longer unambiguous name.

My suggestion would be "PDFAnnotExtractor" (after the main
source file).

Yes, I am interested.

  would be solved in the process.

Now it's the best time, no time pressure at all (see above).

I doubt that you can convince people to port the Java world
to texlua. ;-)

I think the problem is that in TL 2008 ark10.mf was misplaced in the  
doc section (also dingbat.mf):

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/dingbat/ark10.mf

In TL 2007, it is in fonts:

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/dingbat/ark10.mf


While this is fixed, you can make a copy of ark10.mf and dingbat.mf to  
your working directory ---TeX will find them there.

Best,

Axel

Hi,

first, congratulations for the release of TeXlive 2008 and for all your work,
BUT...

you did it again (and this time even worse): 

the TeXlive 2008 iso image does only contain fully expanded/uncompressed "live" directories
and does not (additionally) provide zip files for fast installation.

even worse in 2008: you don't provide any install-only iso image (CD or DVD size I don't really care at first).

right now I'm running an installation from DVD drive (with SUSE 10.1, 2 GB free ram and fast disk/cpu)
and after ~15 minutes it's just with "Installing: ebsthesis" (in alphabetical order I guess)
and "du -s" right now shows "516M    total" from estimat4ed 1700+ Mbytes.

I'll follow up installation times and other statistics once the installation is done
(I'll plan a 2nd installation run on my T61p notebook with SUSE 11.0, stay tuned ...;)

so again, installing TeXlive from an optical media is no fun at all -- which is very pitty...
and it's just impossible to "quickly" install a decent TeXlive e.g. when visiting
a friend or customer, or when someone interested in TeX shows up at a local TeX pub meeting
or whatever.

installation times of 60+++ minutes just for TeX is _very_ sad :-(
a fullfledged SUSE 11.0 installation with almost everything (~7+ Gbyte) 
just took ~35 minutes alltogether on my T61p (includung full texlive 2007 from suse rpms;-)


what about
- creating a DVD-size iso image with zip files ?
- creating a DVD image with both live tree and additional zip files ?


the current situation is _very_ suboptimal IMHO...


anyway, I'm really happy about TeXlive 2008, now only the wrapping and packaging
has to get optimized a bit;)

I have tried network install just now on my office computer while
diffing 30+ GiB set of files over local network at the same time.
Installation time including format generation was 9 minutes and 14
seconds. it will be much worse at home over ADSL. I assume 150 minutes
(based on my previous experience).

Couple of hours later: partial success. Probably different times tlmgr
connected to different mirrors some of them had updated versions, some
have not

collection-latexextra: revision in
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 is less then local
revision, not updating!

Means that this was updated on the first run, but then connection went
to another mirror with older version.

Understandable, but needs to be in FAQ

it wasn't thaaaat bad -- the installation took (slightly;) less than 60 minutes,
but still far too long (and far too noisy for the DVD drives seeking all time:(

yea, the huge directory tree is only a problem for [optical] drives
with very large seek times.  keeping the iso image on a real hard disk
(or even better on a usb stick or other solid state disk) completely
avoids those directory seek issues.

You missed the first line:

Crikey, if dictionary definitions had no meaning,

Well, Douglas Adams was clearly suffering from an
advanced case of deja vu : here is a genuine
instance of dockery, from the recent hearing of
Radovan Karadzic at the United Nations tribunal in
The Hague.

The problem is that the notes package on CTAN dos not contain the
graphics file in a usable form. They are present as .fig files. But we
cannot convert them automatically.

Hi Manuel and Karl,

ctan2tl fixes that but puts the files into .../latex/... instead of
.../fonts/... (but in the right places). I guess there is a simple
ctan2tds MAKE* function that should fix that. So that should son be
fixed.

Well yes or now. THe --dry-run just runs

That is strange, but I guess you found the correct solution:

That can actually by quite possible.

A typical sign that you have already updated, but another mirror is
giving you older files.

Could be, but we will fix that at least tlmgr does not try a new mirror
all the time. In fact the code is already in the repository.

the ctan package does contain a makefile that does the job, using
fig2dev

would you like me to run it, and to submit the results under plain brown

Ah, ok, didn't look through the makefile, only the files already
present.

If files are there we call ctan2tl and they should appear in the right
places, so yes, thanks.

Note the two dingbat.mf files:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/dingbat/dingbat.mf
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/niceframe/dingbat.mf

I suspect the OP's problem is due to some glyphs not present in the
niceframe version, but haven't had time to verify this.  Once again, TL
testing time correlated with hardware problems -- I recall that happening
in past years as well.

Hi Clea,

    acrotex:
    acroweb;

Ah.  Well, here's another case:
- these packages depend entirely on acrobat (non-libre) and are not
  usable with any other pdf reader, to the best of my knowledge.
- they are exceedingly complex and difficult to install (in our process).

So despite all of Dr. Story's incredible work, they won't be getting
added to TL, at least not by me.

    I noticed that a zipped version of acrotex was in TL 2007, 

I removed it since it was out of date.  I think most of those zip files
in support should be deleted, but reviewing them is low priority for me.

Hi Harald,

    you did it again (and this time even worse): 

"We" are volunteers, just like you.  Time is always limited.

I sent out a message towards the end of the release process, asking if
anyone wanted to optimize the ISO, even providing pointers.  No takers.
So it is what it is.

    and does not (additionally) provide zip files for fast installation.

There was not enough room on the physical DVD.

    even worse in 2008: you don't provide any install-only iso image

There was no reason to create it since it wasn't getting burned
anywhere.  Life is short.  Each image is a nontrivial project to create
(and nontrivial bandwidth to distribute).  I am already doing tarballs
in addition to the iso for the distro guys.  That was all I could
manage.

    - creating a DVD-size iso image with zip files ?
    - creating a DVD image with both live tree and additional zip files ?
    the current situation is _very_ suboptimal IMHO...

Since it is suboptimal for you, maybe you would like to help.  If you
make a better optimized ISO, or a DVD image with the zip files (actually
lzma), then I will certainly be very happy to prominently mention it on
the TL web pages / documentation.

Best,
karl

    Now it's the best time, no time pressure at all (see above).

Now I recall that Reinhard already wrote a Lua wrapper for ppower4.jar,
so happily enough, it's no problem.

    My suggestion would be "PDFAnnotExtractor" (after the main

I'm not entirely happy with capital letters.  They always cause
confusion in executable names in my experience.  How about just
downcasing to "pdfannotextractor"?

   * And I am interested, how to deal with third party dependecies:

I have no intention of dealing with it.  People who actually want to use
it will have to install PDFBox on their own.  It would be madness to try
to deal with that in the TL sources.

My only other worry is whether PDFBox and/or PDFAnnotExtractor work with
icedtea or openjdk (vs. the original Sun Java).  I don't suppose you've
happened to try that?  My guess is that it's ok, but ...

Actual run:

update: achemso (first remove old, then install new)
remove: achemso
install: achemso
update: achemso done
update: attachfile (first remove old, then install new)
remove: attachfile
install: attachfile
update: attachfile done

=====
Dry run says only
install: achemso
install: attachfile

====

So,  to learn what would happen in update --all without doing it one
needs to run both


%tlmgr update --all --dry-run ###  list packages to be updated or
installed without distinction
%tlmgr update --list              ###  to list packages to be updated

(I need to check the next install to confirm)

Well, it could say "update:" instead of "install:".  The remove/install
sequence is just the way that update is implemented, it's not actually
giving reporting any additional useful information.

Victor and all,

As Norbert mentioned, he made the changes to ping tlmgr to a single CTAN
host (the way install-tl is).  Before we push this out, can anyone who
has a chance please test this?  You can just grab tlmgr.pl from
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/ (and
/tlmgrgui-real.pl from the tlmgrgui subdir there if you use the gui
version) and put it in your tree (save the original version of course in
case of disaster :).

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2008: nasty pdf(la)tex bug on Solaris SPARC
 with ZFS
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1220915589.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

We have made numerous experiments today with TeX Live 2008 pdf(la)tex
to understand and simplify the problem of giant (multi-TB or multi-PB)
files being created.

I now have a simple test case that exhibits the problem, and
experiments show that it manifests itself only on Sun Solaris SPARC.

On a ZFS system, I see something like this:

	% pdflatex bug.tex
	...
	% ls -l bug.pdf
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 beebe beebe 116951959477640 Sep  8 16:38 bug.pdf
	% ls -lh bug.pdf
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 beebe beebe 107T Sep  8 16:38 bug.pdf

ZFS is Sun's Zettabyte File System, an advanced high-performance
filesystem that provides high reliability, snapshotting, indifference
to disk sizes, trivial size expansion, and a capability of addressing
10**21 bytes of diskspace.  For details, see, e.g.,

	http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/zfs.jsp
	http://opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/whatis/
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS

We have been running this filesystem for about four years now, the
last two of which have been in production mode with thousands of
users, whose home directories reside in ZFS.

On a UFS Solaris SPARC system (/var/tmp), I see this:

	% pdflatex bug.tex
	...
	pdflatex: bug: File too large

	% ls -l bug.df
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 beebe beebe 6318 Sep  8 16:37 bug.pdf

I just did a test reinstallation of the latest TeX Live 2008 tree from

	-rw-rw-r-- 1 mirror mirror 3128049 Sep  7 19:43 ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl.zip

into a temporary directory, and repeated the experiment.  The bug is
still there, so I'm leaving our current 2008 installation unchanged.

Here is the test file:

% cat bug.tex

\documentclass[]{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

This is a picture of a golfer:

\centerline{\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{cgolfer}}

\end{document}

The cgolfer.pdf file can be found here:

	http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/cgolfer.pdf

The bug is unrelated to the particular PDF file that is included as a
graphics image.

The bug does NOT appear when versions of pdflatex for the platforms

amd64-freebsd	  i386-openbsd	    mips-irix	      universal-darwin
i386-freebsd	  i386-solaris	    powerpc-linux     x86_64-linux
i386-linux

are run on the same ZFS filesystem.  Thus, the bug appears to be
unique to Solaris SPARC on ZFS.  The bug is absent from Solaris on
AMD64 and IA-32.  It is also absent from the 2007 edition of TeX Live
for Solaris SPARC.

There is one additional irregularity on Solaris SPARC: when the file
is resident in a non-ZFS filesystem, such as /var/tmp/, I get a
warning message and a bad PDF file:

	% pdflatex bug.tex
	...
	pdflatex: bug: File too large

	% acroread-5.0.10 bug.pdf
	... file is damaged and cannot be repaired ...

	% acroread-8.1.2 bug.pdf
	... file is damaged and cannot be repaired ...

It would be nice if the "File too large" error from pdflatex reported
WHICH file is ``too'' large.  I have

	% ls -l cgolfer.pdf
	-rw-r--r-- 3 beebe staff 30190 Dec 15  1994 cgolfer.pdf

No, update --list is enough. For the listed packages there will be this
action taken:
	- remove the old package
	- install the new package
Only that the --dry-run Option does not mention the remove part, but
that I have you explained already, please read my emails.

Something is wrong with my copy, then. Any ideas why that might happen
and/or what I should do about it? I could just convert the .eps file
which would presumably work.

i built solaris sparc binaries for texlive, and i can reproduce this
behavior too. there is nothing related to ZFS. it only doesn't complain
about a big file size, while UFS returns EFBIG (shown by truss):

write(6, " F 1 5 F 1 6 F 1 7 F 1 8".., 8192)    = 8192
write(6, "C4CD97 kB29E9C0FF8DFCC B".., 330)     = 330
llseek(6, 0x0000330C00000EDC, SEEK_SET)         = 0x330C00000EDC
write(6, " 4 9 1 6", 4)                         Err#27 EFBIG

because of a big lseek before the write. maybe it is because of a
compiler bug, or maybe it is a pdftex bug. therefore i'm also forwarding
to the ntg-pdftex list. does anybody have an idea if it's likely a
compiler bug or a pdftex bug?

Best,
v.

P.S. for those on nts-pdftex who are not subscribed to texlive list,
here is the snippet with a test case:

Here is the test file:

The cgolfer.pdf file can be found here:

The bug is unrelated to the particular PDF file that is included as a
graphics image.

Isn't the same true for all the Win-32 stuff into
which we are putting so much effort ?  Whilst I
respect your position vis-a-vis so-called "libre"
software (even though I completely disagree with
it), it seems to me that if TeX Live is going to
add "must not depend on non-libre software" to its
already long list of conditions that must be met
before inclusion, then it may as well declare
itself a Unix/Linux/GNU-only distribution and be
done with it.

and how.  i'm not sure we ought even to have the thing on ctan (the .sty
claims it should not be distributed, so i'm not sure why we have it).

there is no actual licence information anywhere else.

i've now modified the catalogue entry to say licence other-nonfree, but
it may be that this claim was inserted automatically by an the version
of docstrip current at in -- in which case we convert the package
licence to "noinfo", and do no more than remove it from texlive.

sigh.  another category of oddity i need to check for...

I also confirm this bug. This is caused by LFS. I did a lot
of testing with pdf inclusion on utah machines before TL
release, unfortunately with LFS always disabled so this bug
was not detected.

PS: Perhaps TL should have been built with LFS disabled, since
this feature is still highly experimental and has been not
tested well enough.

I know:-(  
I only managed to download/burn a testint DVD, but I ever had a look at it
and never did any test installation -- sorry about that. 

so: _I_ did it again, too;-))

that's strange. the iso image is 2.5 GB (2617149440 bytes) right now, and

       ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/

is ~1 GB (540272 sectors == 1106477056 bytes when creating an ISO image of these files),
so with compressed CTAN packages there still should almost 1 GB left.
that way the installer could read 1762 tar files from DVD for my full installation 
instead of ~65k files...  (no idea if this will give a big benefit, I'll try to test...)


I'll think about hacking the net-installation to use local *.tar.lzma files
for an installation from usb stick for testing.  

if that works, I'll try to run that installation from a real DVD and will report performace...

No need for working. rsync from CTAN to /local/path, then call
	install-tl -location /local/path
and be happy. Many people are doing that.

No version of docstrip that I know of inserts a "may not distribute"
statement. (Doesn't mean that actually no version of docstrip does it,
but it would indeed surprise me). Anyway, the test is clear: strip the
dtx again with a recent version of docstrip and see what remains of the
"licence statement".

Anyway, the very notion of docstrip default headers stating anything in
terms of licence is madness. IMO, docstrip defaults headers should just
be:  "This file was generated from XXX.dtx with docstrip. See the source
file for licence information."  I know this adds some more work, but i
may be good to keep a list of packages with this problem in order to ask
the latex team about it again. I'm not sure they realise how many files
are concerned.

By the way, half jokingly, one could interpret the "decision" of the
author keeping the docstrip default headers as "I hereby place this
document under the licence the LaTeX team choose for the docstrip defaut
headers to state, this version or,  at your option, any later version."
Now the l3 team would have the power to free a lot of packages by just
changing docstrip's defaut headers to any free licence :-)

This was in LPPL and thus in docstrip some 15 years ago. Maybe I still
have it somewhere in my almost ancient emTeX installation in my OS/2
computer. It explicitelly asked for distribution of .dtx, not .sty and
other generated files.

Honestly, no.

IMO, but maybe it's not the view of the whole team, the true condition
is "should not essentially depend on non-free software."  And all is not
black or white, but when something is already dark grey because it
depends in an essential on non-free stuff (I'd maybe not say black at
once, since Acroread is quite wide-spread indeed), if moreover it's
particularly difficult to install... you get the idea.

Ok, looks like I'm not old enough ;-) Thanks for the info!

By the way, may this explain why so many packages on the CTAN are still
distributed as dtx+ins (+pdf) but the sty is not available?

It seems an important question, none the less.

Your own criterion (snipped earlier, reinserted here)
"should not essentially depend on non-free software"
is surely /highly/ moot when speaking of Win-32 binaries.

** Phil --- who most certainly does not want to
see TeX Live go Gnu/Unix/Linux only, but who
equally does not want to see excluded software

i'll recompile sparc-solaris and powerpc-aix using --disable-largefile

i didn't have an idea that LFS should be disabled because of such

on solaris i get a meaningful error message.

To me, this is a poor justification.   As long as the package relies on
capabilities that are documented in the PDF manual, those could be
implemented in other readers if the demand were there.

as is anything to do with Win32.  To me it is a question of allocating
scarce resources.   More work is needed on the basic Win32
support (tlmgr,, texhelp, dvi viewer, etc.), ConTeXt, testing (the LFS
bug in pdftex), etc.  If someone feels strongly that more resources
should be devoted to a particular aspect of TL, they can do the work
themselves, or find ways to support someone who can.

I suppose part of the issue here is the perl scripts to go from
CTAN to a TL package aren't really up to the task.  If a package
is important, someone could, in principle, put it together manually.
This might be facilitated if the existing perl scripts could generate
a template for the actual package.

This does raise a question: what would it take to support 3rd party
packages in tlmgr.  Suppose someone packages acrotex and
puts the package on a server dedicated to things acrobatic.
I can envision a package that actually just installs the installer
for acrotex, so some simple additional steps are needed by the user
to complete the installation.

 I definitely would like to have acrotex more widely used. I learned
some things studying packages in this bundle.

The problem is not only that AA is not free. It runs on Windows and
MacOSX only. Furthermore I suspect that scripts there are also only
for Windows.

I tried to persuade D.Story to create instructions for manual
acrobatics which would be possibly useful for one doing it on Mac or
Adobe online service (the latter is definitely more restricted than
Acrobat Pro; should I remind that AA9 on Windows comes in 3 flavors,
and in one on Mac?). Or for one who can go to Windows friend and do
Acrobatics there. I failed. I tried to persuade to create tds - again
the author did not want to do TeDiouS things :(

It is a real shame, the whole bundle is really impressive.

PS. I am not that sure that Adobe documents everything. F.e. flv files
and their sandbox playing.

I agree. As I told in my previous mail, I don't think the picture is just
black and white. But given the scale of grey, we tend to allocate the
ressources to the white parts of the picture first. (And of course some
parts are actually black too: some tings are not distributable).

Apparently, it could be done quite rapidly. This is currently under internal
discussion/development.

Would it work? MikTeX has mpc (miktex package creator). It would be
interesting to learn how many authors really used it. It does not
necessarily mean the same results for TeXLive.

Message-ID: <3b8343640809090622i3d3c99c4w574497bbd555fe0e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

As I announced before, here's an Italian translation for the install-tl GUI.
This is a Beta 1 version which needs at least a review from another
Italian speaker. You can contact me for any question.

I was playing around with the tlmgr program, and I noticed that the
description of every package are always in English. Is there a way
to let the program read localized copies of these descriptions?
If not, it could be a nice idea to implement such a feature (for
example, by putting the files inside a two-letters language code
directory and falling back to the en/ copy when no translation is
available).

A similar problem arises when choosing the platforms, the languages,
the schemes, and the standard collections in the install-tl program:
they are always written in English (hard coded inside the software?);
once again, for a full localization, moving these information inside
language files and allowing for a translation could be a nice idea.

There is also a little inconsistency between the language selection
option in install-tl and tlmgr: the first uses -lang, while the second
-gui-lang. I would suggest to choose one for both the programs.

Of course, these issues are no way urgent, but, if you like them, you
could take as suggestions for a little improvement in the next
releases.

Bye,
Marco

cool, that's easy!

from usb-stick I get the "raw speed" for my T61p (with 72% cpu usage -- good;)

                332.367 5m32.367s real,         183.783 user,   54.891 sys,     71.81 cpu

where package extraction took 03:55, so it's about 1:37 for post install (creating fmt files etc).


and from DVD (3.7 GB, including both the live tree and the archive/*.tar.* files)

	        622.032 10m22.032s real,        223.938 user,   82.193 sys,     49.21 cpu

which is pretty ok, esp. compared with the 50+ minutes before;)

Subject: [tex-live] Issues with tlmgr and failed downloads
Message-ID: <180A74E1-D877-435F-999F-A4F67D84BD02@gmail.com>

Victor Ivrii suggested I cross post this here.  I posted this note in  
response to several member of the MacOS X TeX mailing list having  
issues with tlmgr:

From: N Shah <pony777 at gmail.com>
Subject: Re: tlmgr (was: [OS X TeX] MacTeX-2008)
Date: September 9, 2008 2:12:09 AM EDT
To: macosx-tex at email.esm.psu.edu

I've managed to get tlmgr working consistently and learned a few  
things along the way that may be of use to all of you.

As pointed out by Victor, tlmgr, by default, does in fact go to  
different CTAN mirror each time it needs to download something.   
Since all the mirrors are not in perfect sync, this leads to odd  
situations where the mirror from which tlmgr.tlpkdb (the package  
databased used to see if something new is available) could indicate  
that some package has been updated, yet, when tlmgr tries to download  
the update, it may try to get it from a different mirror that doesn't  
yet have the package.

When this situation occurs (or if the download fails for some other  
reason) bad things happen.  When updating a package, tlmgr first  
removes the old package and then downloads and installs the new one.   
Perfectly sensible unless the download fails.  When the download  
fails, the old package is not restored -- it simply disappears  
(having been removed as the first step in the update).  This is the  
likely cause of the various cases of disappearing files and programs  
reported in this thread.  I had my updmap and texdoc disappear due to  
failed download.  This is really bad behavior on the part of tlmgr  
and hopefully will be fixed in an update soon.

Should you find yourself missing files, the easiest solution is to  
just reinstall MacTex and start over.  Alternatively you can use  
'tlmgr search --file' to tell you to which package a particular file  
belongs.  For example 'tlmgr search --file updmap-sys' will reveal  
that updmap-sys is part of the bin-tetex.universal-darwin package.   
You can then use 'tlmgr install bin-tetex.universal-darwin' to  
restore the missing file.

To (mostly -- downloads can still fail) avoid this situation you need  
to tell tlmgr to not use the CTAN mirroring system, rather to  
download from a specific mirror.  This can be accomplished by using  
the --location command line option to tlmgr, e.g. your update command  
will be:

tlmgr --location http://ctan.math.utah.edu/tex-archive/systems/ 
texlive/tlnet/2008 update --all

This will force tlmgr to download from the specified ctan.  While it  
is true that one mirror may not in perfect sync with another,  
everything seems to be consistent within one mirror.  We are now left  
determining which mirror to use.  tlmgr has an environment variable  
that helps in figuring this out.  The variable TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS  
contains the arguments passed to wget by tlmgr when downloading.  By  
setting this to "-v -O" you can get verbose output from wget and  
actually see which server mirror.ctan.org is telling wget to use.  To  
set the variable in your terminal enter for tcsh

setenv TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS "-v -O"

or for bash

TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS="-v -O"
export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS

If you run 'tlmgr update --list' with this environment variable set,  
you'll see downloads coming from a variety of ctan mirrors.  This  
will allow you pick one that seems to give you consistently high  
speeds and a reliable connection.  You can then use that server in  
the location argument to tlmgr as I did above with  
ctan.math.utah.edu.  Note that you'll need to specify the whole url  
up to the year.

After implementing the above, I was able to get reliable updates to  
my MacTex installation.  Yeah, it's complicated, but that fact that  
automated mirroring works at all is a minor miracle.

Hope this helps some of you folks who ran into trouble.  Note if the  
above doesn't make sense to you, I would avoid tlmgr until the  
TeXLive folks have worked on it some more.  For an initial attempt at  
a package management system for something as steeped in legacy as  
TeXLive, tlmgr is a great start.  I'm sure it will become even better  
in the months and years to come.

after some hours debugging, here is what I can confirm:

- the problem is with LFS enabled only; re-compiled pdftex
  with LFS disabled doesn't have this problem.

- the problem seems to be related to the value of variable
  pdfptr gone wild at certain moment, not to the *seek()
  functions.

- it seems a bug of pdftex, not compiler.

Well, AFAIK, no such translation is available for any language. And it would
probably be quite a lot of work (the TeX catalogue is not particularly
small). So the first question is, will any translation be available? If (and
when) the answer to this question is yes, then it may be worth considering
making it available via tlmgr.

Well, for the moment, we're just discussing how to allow tlmgr to
install/update from more than one repository. What people put in this
repository and how they manage to package it is another problem. For now I
would assume packagers should just read the doc (included in TL) about the
package management system and use whatever tools the find appropriate. (Our
own scripts are public by the way.)

That is a problem and the our repositry already contains a fixed version
and we are testing it. If anyone wants to help, please get it from
svn/http (tlmgr.pl and tlmgrgui/tlmgrgui-real.pl) and report the test
results.

Yes, you are right, that is bad behaviour. Still, someone (me probably)
has to write a better way and I cannot work full time on TeX Live
(although I am close to that). You might ask some local Perl guru to
help us ...

That is good to do until we have updated tlmgr(gui) to fix on one mirror
like it is done with the installer. THe code is there, it needs testing
...

(etc) easier: run wget http://mirror.ctan.org > /dev/null
and look into the output for
	Location: http://ftp.uniRoma2.it/TeX/ [following]
(what I get ATM). That is what our mirror fixing thingy is doing.

Thanks to let us know, and good to hear that with the mirror fixed for
one session it should help.

Note that you could change the default location permanently with
	tlmgr option location http://ftp.uniRoma2.it/TeX/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
for example. Then you don't have to do anything else!

Great thanks, committed to our repository.

Actually no. Well, you have to talk to the TeX Catalogue people about
the translation. What we ship is taken directly from the TeX Catalogue,
and we will not duplicate anything within TeX Live what we cannot update
automatically.

So if there is a way to have a translated catalogue, then in principle
we can think about translated package descriptions, too.

Because tlmgr itself is not translated, the messages it issues are
always in ENglish. Only the GUI is translated.

But in fact it shouldn't be necessary, if you have the right locale it
will choose your language automatically. Should!

Again thanks a lot and best wishes from Siena

I don't have a fix yet, just some more info: it's very
likely that the problem is caused by inconsistent
declaration of type longinteger. Tracing it down is not
easy due to nested inclusion of header files, however a
quick check can be done in gdb as follows:

,--------
| info type longinteger
|
| All types matching regular expression "longinteger":
|
| File pdftexini.c:
| typedef long long int longinteger;
|
| File pdftex0.c:
| typedef long long int longinteger;
|
| [...many files with the same declaration of longinteger...]
|
| File ../../../../src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/writejbig2.c:
| typedef long int longinteger;
|
| File ../../../../src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/pdftoepdf.cc:
| typedef long int longinteger;
`--------

Note that the last 2 declarations are "long int" and not "long long int"

longinteger is defined in web2c/config.h as off_t, which also has inconsistent
declaration over different files: like longinteger, it's "long long int" for
most files, except the following:

,--------
| File ../../../../src/libs/xpdf/goo/gfile.cc:
| typedef long int off_t;
|
| File ../../../../src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/pdftoepdf.cc:
| typedef long int off_t;
`--------

I don't follow Debian's criticism, since I think, the right to require
attribution removal is both, useful and non-invasive.  But, ...

This is a striking argument!  I only wanted to point out that word lists
(and we didn't find free, large and well maintained ones) can be the
base for non TeX or even non computer based work[*].  So it might be
useful to distribute it as standalone work and GPL doesn't necessarily
come to mind immediately, then.  But as you pointed out that was
stopping half the way of a though.  For computer based applications,
such as a spell checker GPL would be best choice, of course.  So we
might consider dual-licensing.  Thanks!

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Actually, our list of hyphenated words is partly based on another larger
list of unhyphenated German words (plus lots of garbage) sorted by word
frequency.   That list is /non-free/.  We have explicit permission to
derive substantially different work and do anything we want with that.
That is, we're not allowed to, say, remove only some words from the
original list and distribute the remaining word list, but there are no
really strict rules to obey.  Our work involves:

* selecting words from the original list,
* spell checking,
* manual or automatic word hyphenation,
* manual hyphenation checking,
* transformation into our database format,
* sorting alphabetically (just for human readability).

So I think we're on the save side.  But in fact, there is source for our
work that cannot be distributed.  What does that mean for GPL?  I'd
think it doesn't matter as long as we're acting in compliance with our
permissions.  For users of our work it's the same situation as if there
were no sources.  Anything wrong with that?

Well, as I wrote in my reply to Frank, in non-computer based world I
assume CC is a little bit easier to handle/understand than GPL.

If you encourage people to create packages for things that aren't yet
in TL, there
will be some incentives for those people to organize things so it is
easier to create
packages.

we discussed a multilingual catalogue, a while back: i think jim has the
infrastructure, but there's nothing in the dtd that i recall.  (i got a
new dtd yesterday which i've not looked at yet, but that was to address
a different set of problems.)

one obstacle is that we don't have any catalogue descriptions in any
other language than english.  (the ctan team covers english and german
as native languages, and two of us have french as a second language.)

in principal we could start translating to german; in practice, there's
none of us who could do the job who have any significant spare time (to
translate, you need to have the source language as second language, the
destination language as mother tongue).

apart from all of which, i don't know how we would represent a
multilingual catalogue.

so, to stop rambling ... we have had basic ideas, but none of them
carried through to actual implementation.

That's exactly the point. :-( When I started working on the Topic  
Index I realised how much work goes into maintaining the Catalogue...  
If we started translating every entry in the Catalogue into German we  
would be busy for quite a while... I think this time is better spent  
otherwise as the number of contributors is rather small, after all...

We could do it similar to what Wikipedia does, e.g.:

http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html
http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/de.bytopic.html
http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/fr.bytopic.html
http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/it.bytopic.html

etc.

Each and every entry and the entire interface had to be translated...

J?rgen.

I know from their mail archives that the maintainers of the French FAQ
of 2004 discussed translating a subset of the catalogue  (the packages
cited in the FAQ), but didn't start it because that was too much work
and the FAQ itself was already a lot of work.

I don't think there's more people ready to start translating in French
today than at this time (when the French documentation translation
groups was still active).

yes, i recompiled passing the --disable-largefile to configure on
sparc-solaris and powerpc-aix, and now the test case works on both of
them (correct PDF is produced).

i commited only the updated pdftex binaries (rebuild on aix and solaris
produces lots of changed files even when sources did not change, so i
did not want to touch unaffected programs). if someone knows which
other programs are affected by the --disable-largefile, please let me
know. or maybe it's ok to update all binaries.

two odd things noticed on AIX:

1) pdftex prints some garbage to terminal and to the log instead
   of the list of preloaded fonts. here is the diff between terminal output
   on aix and solaris:

2) xetex does not work on aix, it produces an error when generating a
   format file, and actually even when starting in INITEX mode:

$ xetex -ini 
fatal: memory exhausted (xmalloc of 72367120 bytes).

   this box has 768 Mb of physical memory but maybe xetex was trying to
   allocate more than that, and the last message is just the last chunk
   of attempted malloc which failed.

   i wonder if this failure is just because of insufficient memory, or a bug.
   are there some "aggressive" limits for xetex set in texmf.cnf?

Best,

Very helpful.  It might be nice to give examples of well constructed
packages in each of the categories simple, complex, and with
binaries/scripts.

For for packages that contain source code it is worth mentioning:

Others will want to compile on a wide range of past, current, and
future systems.  If your code deals with platform differences using
"#ifdef <platform_X>" then someone who does not  have access
to <platform_X> may find it difficult to port the code to
<platform_Y>.  If your code uses #ifdef HAVE_<SOME_CAPABILITY>,
it will be easier to determine the changes that might be required
for a new platform.  The GNU autoconf system is disigned to facilitate
this approach, but does not prevent you from using "#ifdef <platform_X>".


For packages that contain shell scripts:

Please consider rewriting the scripts using luatex or perl.  Shell
scripts require careful coding to run on the full range of unix-like
systems, and do not work at all on MS Windows.  Package authors
should also note that many widely used utilities (awk, sed, make, etc.)
are not generally available on MS Windows.

Hi,

Question to the pdftex guys:

I just noticed that \pdfstrcmp is not mentioned in pdftex-a.pdf, at
least the version in TeX Live (dated 2007/01/05). Is our version
outdated or do you want this primitive to remain secret ? :-)

Hi Phil,
sorry for the late response.  The evenings are very short
these days.  I'm coming home very late each day from work because
there is a trade fair in October and we devopers are quite busy.  

I, commented out some stuff temporarily.  I run

       diff tl-w32-wrapper.texlua texdoc-w32-wrapper.texlua 

in order to be sure that everything is ok but it seems that I hit the
"undo" key accidentally before I created the zip file. Sorry.

The reason I provided a modified script was because Manuel said:

Date: Mon, 01 Sep 2008 15:03:07 +0200

os.spawn ("texlua", "texlua", "arg1", "arg2")
is actually a correct call [...]
_______________________________________________________________

But this is *not* what the wrapper does.

What Manual did is

  arg[1]="texlua"
  arg[2]="texlua"
  arg[3]="arg1"

But the wrapper does

  arg[0]=texlua
  arg[1]="texlua"
  arg[2]="arg1"

I thought that the different indexing causes the problem.  Manuel told
me that it makes no difference.  It shouldn't make any difference
according to the LuaTeX manual (which didn't cover such things when
the wrapper was written).

Another difference between the wrapper and Manuel's test file is that
the wrapper doesn't quote the first argument.  Since Manuel already
told me that the version I sent you doesn't work, I send you a new
file which quotes the first argument too.

Meanwhile I doubt that this will solve the problem.  But who knows?
I'm still wondering how AR is actually invoked.  In order to find this
out I wrote a tiny program called print-argv.  The attached zip file
contains the source code too.  I compiled it using the Microsoft C
compiler.  Don't be confused by the underscores in the output.  They
are supposed to help you to distinguish between an empty string and
one which contains spaces only.

Could you temporarily replace acrord32.exe by this program and tell me
the result?  You could also temporarily replace start.exe by this
program.  I suppose that no important system programs rely on
start.exe.  If you are in doubt, create a boot floppy before, so that
you can recover easily.

Phil, I don't know how familiar you are with Lua.  I know that it's
quite new to you but I've seen in the mails that you even succeeded to
write your own lua script.  Could you add the directory containing
AR to %PATH% and modify texdoc.tlu accordingly?  What I mean is to
invoke AR directly and avoid start.exe and the stuff it depends on
(assoc, ftype).  It's better to avoid them ATM and examine them later
if necessary.  There are too many degrees of freedom...

Hi,

Before I answer Reinhard's message, I'd like to mention I committed
something that should work around the problem. It should be in the
updates of tomorrow if your CTAN mirror is very up-to-date, or a bit
later otherwise. You can still try it by manually installing the two
attached files in bin/win32 (texdoc.bat overwrites the current, the
other file is new).

I'm sorry, but if I remember correctly, I tested this too and it fails
too. Testing it again: well, just nothing visible happens. No error, no
program starting, nothing. Since I don't know how to test exits codes on
windows, I can't say if the os.spawn failed or something else.

By the way Philip, if you know of a good "Windows for the command line
addict" tutorial... (and details such as how to set environment
variables, etc.)

Btw, I'm now doing my test on a virtual machine. On of the advantages is
that you can take snapshots very easily and have no fear breaking
everything :-)

Btw you can also put viewer_pdf=print_argv in your texdoc.cnf and make
sure print_argv is in your path, if you want to avoid overwriting
acrord32 or start (which may be a shell builtin btw). Here is the result:


C:\Program Files\texlive\texmf-local\texdoc>echo viewer_pdf=print-argv >
texdoc.
cnf

C:\Program Files\texlive\texmf-local\texdoc>texdoc texlive-en
argv[0]: __print-argv__
argv[1]: __C:\Program
Files\texlive\2008\texmf-doc\doc\english\texlive-en\texliv
e-en.pdf__

(The other very nice thing with virtualbox is copy-pasting between guest
and host machines.)

Agreed.

The line breaks are inserted by your mail client?
It seems so, because something like 

texliv
e-en.pdf

is most likely introduced by a quite crude mail client.   

But what about

C:\Program
Files

???   Is the line break caused by print_argv.exe or by your mail program?
These little differences are very important.

It doesn't matter to you.  You have all the relevant permissions.

Yes.  Since the GPL mandates distributing the sources (the "preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it"), nobody can meet the
conditions.  As a result, the patterns are not redistributable legally.

So you definitely need to pick a different license here.

I don't follow this. In the case of Stephan's patterns, the "preferred  
form for making modifications" would surely be the list of hyphenated  
words, which he is proposing to distribute as well. The fact that he  
made use of another (non-free) list of words -- I notice that it  
didn't even have hyphen positions -- while creating his hyphenated  
list is irrelevant; the patterns will come with perfectly acceptable  
source.

If you compile with --disable-largefile, you typically get two
different definitions:
- one comes from obsdcompat, which automatically detects systems with LFS
- one comes from web2c, which doesn't detect LFS

This is why the pdftex build script has --disable-largefile.

What's needed to fix this mess is to enable web2c to detect LFS. This
needs changes to the configure/autofoo ...

I have to admit I have been mislead by his use of the word "source".
The GPL has quite a clear definition of "source code" with regard to the
scope of the covered material.  I agree that it does not match what
Stephan describes with "But in fact, there is source for our work that
cannot be distributed." and "For users of our work it's the same
situation as if there were no sources."

So yes, the GPL would appear to be a suitable license for distribution
even though Stephan is not the sole copyright holder (the copyright for
the original word list and thus also part copyright for the derived work
rests with the original party).

If you can get hold of Windows 2000: it has a pretty decent DOS
command-line reference under help. Unfortunately, I completely
failed to export it to a standalone helpfile.

Most DOS commands have a /? switch. Reinhard had a script to collect
all such output into a pdf. A couple of pages:

http://vtatila.kapsi.fi/batch_tutorial.html
http://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid68_gci1294869,00.html

Windows XP in a nutshell also has a chapter on the command-line and
batchfiles.

As to environment variables specifically: you set them with

set var=value

and unset them with

set var=

And remember that the names of the environment variables are all
uppercase, the conversion is performed by cmd.exe. Thus if you type

set var=value

it will set environment variable VAR. you can type on the command line

echo %var%
echo %VAR%
echo %vAr%

and all these command will display value. However, if you try to getn
the value of the environment variable from your program, you must use
the name in uppercase, eg. in C you must use getenv("VAR").

Bu my mail client and by the fact I can't resize my cmd window on
windows. Of course there's no line break in the true version. Remember
that it works with othe pdf reader: it wouldn't if there were spurious
line breaks in the args...

Perl appears to do this conversion too.

In the DTD both the caption element (one-sentence; intended for tables
of one line per package) and the description element (longer) take an
xml:lang attribute.

Honestly, those are not in anticipation of a serious multilingual effort
but instead because occasionally an author sends a caption or
description in two languages.  (E.g., the author of a style file for a
French language journal may include a description in both English and
French.)

Hi,

I found two links contained in "The TeX Live Guide - teX Live 2008".
They are in subsection 2.4, see
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-110002.4.
The two links are:

- - "texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/pdftex-a.pdf" pointing to
http://www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/pdftex-a.pdf
- - "texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/samplepdf/samplepdf.tex" ponting to
http://www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/samplepdf/samplepdf.tex

I did not find to correct locations, but you may know.


bye

Meik

yes, it was reported a few days ago by Nelson Beebe on this list.

please download a replacement for the pdftex binary:

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/sparc-solaris/pdftex?revision=10522

(as i understand, it will also be available via the new texlive update mechanism).

it is the same problem as reported by Nelson, and confirmed by Thanh.

nothing could be understood from the logs. pdftex needs to be rebuilt
without large file support, and it is available in the repository at

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/sparc-solaris/pdftex?revision=10522

Well, I'm no so sure. I'd rather expect people to type "texdoc amsmath"
for information about amsmath.sty. But yes, amsmath.sty is nothing but
the current form of amslatex, so... Ok, I aliased amslatex to amsldoc.

Anyway, if you have a clear overview of the various ams* documentations
and want to share it, please free to further comment on the current
collection of alias and/or suggest additions. For reference, here it is:

# ams
alias amsmath = amsldoc
alias amscls = instr-l
alias amsart = instr-l
alias amsproc = instr-l
alias amsbook = instr-l
alias amsthm = amsthdoc
alias amsfonts = amsfndoc
alias amsrefs = amsrdoc
#
alias amsmath-dev = amsmath
alias amscls-dev = amsclass
alias amsart-dev = amsclass
alias amsproc-dev = amsclass
alias amsbook-dev = amsclass

He'll be on SPARC, I'm sure. This looks like the LFS bug, and will  
normally manifest itself only on big-endian architectures; little- 
endian ones get away with the mismatched types, at least in simple  
cases with small files. (I suspect they'd also break if they really  
were to encounter a LARGE pdf file.)

minority opinion here ...
although amshelp.pdf wasn't created at
ams, and also isn't up to date, it does
try to explicate ams-latex as a whole.
ams-latex is not *only* amsmath; it also
comprises several document classes,
amsthm, and amsrefs.  amshelp.pdf tries
to cover the whole lot, and contains
references to the individual manuals
for the components.

i'm inclined to think that amshelp.pdf
really is the more appropriate target
for amslatex.

i'm looking over amshelp, and intend
to make suggestions to the author for
bringing it up to date.

I was hesitating too, so I'll revert my change and keep amsmath as the
only alias to amsldoc.

By the way, if you want to suggest other arrangements for the ams*
documentation names in texdoc, your advice would be greatly appreciated.
(Though I use amsmath+amssymb daily, I must admit I don't know a lot the
other ams packages and their doc.)

That is all coming from
	my $cwd = `cd`;
	chomp($cwd);

Can anyone with Vista try that in a small perl program? It should work.

far from being "unknown", i (now) reckon there's a clear statement that
this is a nosell package.

there are those who like to prowl around this sort of thing, to

Subject: [tex-live] Using counters in command name
Message-ID: <57048cc50809101359t74a19ae1gf6d91b8063448c41@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have the following problem: I wish to create a command
(\addTask{taskname}), what create a command with a name what consist of two
part.
The first part is always the same (task) and the second part is a value of a
counter (taskcounter).
The problem is, that \newcommand don't accept counters value as the frst
arguement. I try so:

\newcounter{taskcounter}
\setcounter{taskcounter}{0}

\newcommand{\addTask}[1]{%
     \newcommand{%
         \task\arabic{taskcounter}%
     }{%
         #1%
     }%
}

Of course, the counter called taskcounter have a value(0), but the command
named \task0 has not created.
Please, if comebody could help me, send a source code.
Thx!

Hmm, I doubt this is the appropriate list for that. You should rather
ask on the texhax mailing list of the comp.text.tex newsgroup.

> Of course, the counter called taskcounter have a value(0), but the command
> named \task0 has not created.

The point is, if you want to create command whose name contains non only
letters, you have to use \csname. But then you need to use \expandafter
to get the name formed before \newcommand starts. For example:

\expandafter\newcommand\csname task\arabic{taskcounter}\endcsname{%
% definition
}

Again, this is not the appropriate place for this so if you need further
explanation, please ask them in texhac or compt.text.tex.

It looks like I have solved the problem. I uninstalled MSYS + MinGW
(which I think contained its own Perl installation) and deleted
references to previous (and already uninstalled) Perl and MikTex
installations from PATH. One of these measures worked and now the
installer seems to run ok. Another problem during installation was
that I couldn't install to Program Files (directory not writable -
seems to be problem with Vista permissions), but I chose another
directory and it seems to be allright now.

Anyway, thanks for your comments

I was really just making a list - not especially recommending anything
one way or another.

I'm not sure I would be very much use. I think I write OK bug reports
but not very much else, unfortunately. I can't program - only write
shell scripts. Not even that on Windows. And I figured out how to
install various fonts for TeX. But that's not much use either unless
somebody is interested in an alternative to lmoderno or something.

I did look at your pages on contributing but, issues concerning my
potential usefulness or lack thereof aside, helping seemed to require
rather more disk space that I have to spare. I've got about 16 G but
need at least 12-16 G (15-20%) to keep OS X happy. Even now, my spare
capacity sometimes drops below 10 G (which I really should avoid but
don't always manage to).

That was a few days ago, at least, but as far as I could tell, it 
isn't possible to do much without a significant chunk of free space. 
Is that understanding correct?

Anyway, I'll stop publishing my list. It really was only intended as
information but that's not the point.

The script contained a list of programs I derived from cmd /? and
redirects the help messages to a file.  It's not very helpful.  The
sole reason for writing it was that I only have access to a German
version of Windows and I needed the help messages in English.  I sent
it to Phil, he run it on his machine, and sent me the output.
Converting the text file to latex had been done more or less manually
using regexps in Emacs.

The resulting pdf can be downloaded from:

  http://www.tug.org/~kotucha/win32/win32-cmd-manual.pdf

However, I'll remove it in a couple of days because it's not TeX
related.

The file doesn't provide any other information than you can get with
<command> /? but I think it's more convenient if you want to get an
overview or you are on Unix.  And it only covers cmd.exe.

Always keep in mind that the help messages are incomplete.  Don't make
any assumptions if something is not clearly specified.

For instance, COPY on Windows provides the switches /A for ASCII files and
/B for binary files.  But the help message doesn't tell you what COPY
does by default.  Don't assume it does something useful.

Our first attempt to support network installs was to use pipes

  wget | lzmadec | tar

but it doesn't work reliably on Windows.  Some files couldn't be
de-compressed properly.  We _***_wasted 3 weeks_***_ until we found
out that pipes on Windows try to find out whether a file is ASCII or
binary.  This can never work reliably.  When it assumes the file is
ASCII it "repairs" line breaks.  The behavior is not specified
anywhere AFAIK.  I searched Google ad nauseam.

Whether COPY runs in binary mode or makes some assumptions by default
is not specified.  Finding it out requires an enormous effort in
reverse-engineering.  And an enourmous amount of time.

Furthermore, not everything what Microsoft claims is true.

Sometimes it happens that I get a "permission denied" error when I say
start "" "foo.pdf".  I can repair it with "chmod a+x foo.pdf" in
Cygwin but Microsoft claims that the executable flag is ignored.  It
is definitely not ignored by cmd.exe, but it's ignored by the Widows
Exploder.  Sigh!

Regards,
  Reinhard

Perfectly true, except in the simplest cases.
The solution is always to use an explicit "/A" or "/B".

This is an attempt to use Unix philosophies and methodologies
on Windows systems. When coding for Windows, the first rule is
to do things the Windows way.  Windows /has/ pipes, but does n
ot support them in any real sense.  Far better to use scratch
files, as all native Windows software does.

But was that work necessary ?  Would it not have been
better always to invoke Copy with "/A" or "/B", as above ?

Probably true for all vendors : unlikely to be a sin
of commission, more probably one of omission.

This one does intrigue me.  If there /is/ an "executable flag"
in NTFS, there must be some native utility for interrogating
and/or setting it.  "Attrib" makes no mention of it.  However,
the security tab reveals all, where I see that Windows actually
variously calls it "Read+Execute" and "Traverse folder / Execute
file".  Creating a test directory with no inherited permissions,
I copied a single PDF there, removed access from all but myself,
and denied myself Read+Execute access.  Result : Starts from Explorer
(double-click), error "Access is denied" when attempting to launch by

	Start "" "Payments.pdf"

Re-instate Read+Execute, and the above works.  Reinhard's
asserting is therefore born out.

Just one question, Reinhard : where do <mu>Soft state that
"the executable flag is ignored" ?

The problem with Windows pipes is that they are often ASCII, not
binary. I remember that I was not able to do tar | gzip because gzip
stopped its job at the first Ctrl-Z. Maybe it is better now, I do not
know. I ceased to use Windows a great many years ago.

Execute in the security tab means that the user is allowed to execute
the file (if it is a file) or "cd" to that directory (if it is a
directory). It does not mean that the file is executable.
Executability is recognized by some other comlpex logic which I do not
understand. Since Win2000 the dos box supports filename completion by
TAB, thus instead of finding an icon of a file or an application it is
faster to open a command window, cd to an appropriate directory and
open a file. If you invoke something.exe or something.bat, the
corresponding file will be executed (if you have execute permissions).
If youo type something.doc, the file will be opened in MS Word.

Using scratch files does not change the binary/ascii problem.  And pipes
certainly _are_ part of the Windows way.  DOS introduced the open/close
system calls pretty much from the start (2.0 or something?) as an
alternative to the previous CP/M FCB file handling.  By now the
DOS-based FCB file handling is gone.  For better or worse, Windows file
handling is using Unix-style system calls and interfaces.  So there is
no reason not to get them right.

If you are calling it by hand, you know what kind of file you are
handling.  If you are working on wildcards or parameters/variables, you
may not necessarily have that information available.

In the case of Microsoft, you have to fork over a few thousand quid in
order to be allowed to even report a problem (let alone have it fixed).
That tends to leave things in a bad state rather than having them
reported and fixed.

Sorry Phil, but if you remove everything from Windows that has had its
conceptual origin in Unix, you are not left with anything close to a
working system.  The whole file handling with the open/close/read/write
calls are straight lifted from Unix (the original CP/M handling is no
longer available).  Similar to directory handling.  That Windows botched
up the uptake of those concepts to a degree where they only work under
certain circumstances does not mean that you can make do without them
entirely.

Basically your arguments amount to "please use only things that actually
work".  But there is no documentation or guideline about what is
actually going to work.  And your frequent offering of the opinion that
anybody using any part of Windows that happens to fail to meet its
specifications or reasonable expectations is just an incapable
indoctrinated UNIX idiot is not helpful.

If you don't have any constructive advice to offer for solving the
technical problems people encounter (and it would appear that your
exposure to Windows internals and Windows programming is not on a level
where you actually can offer helpful advice), you might at least try not
to annoy the people all too much who actually still try to do the work
required to provide you with working software on your platform of
choice.

It comes from the context distribution, and it is intended for use with
X11 text editors that do not like OpenType fonts. There is no immediate
relation to the otf's used for typesetting.

I started to use DOS at version 3.something and wrote some programs in
assembler calling DOS API functions (I even tried to write a simple
virus for didactic purposes but never distributed it). The
documentation said that some DOS API functions are modeled after CP/M,
hew API functions are modeled after UNIX. There was even a product
called "microshell" that added nice pipe features to command line in
CP/M. 25 years ago I wrote a lot of scripts for our 8-bit Robotron
with CP/M using the microshell extension.

copy file* x:\path always assumes /B, /A and /B really matter only if
you write to stdout or read from stdin. However, copy /B file |
something is not sufficient, if "something" reads the pipe as ASCII,
you are lost, it will stop at the first Ctrl-Z.

I have also tried to concatenate files by
copy /B file1+file2 file3
Unfortunatelly concatenation works with ASCII files only and /B is
ignored. I do not know whether M$ fixed this bug, I have not tried it
for several years.

Once again, David, you are inferring ideas that are
not in the message to which you are responding.  It
is clear that there are ways of doing things that
work reliably in Windows (otherwise Windows would
not be the undoubted success that it is, commercially
speaking).  I am simply advocating that those ways
be used in preference to using Unix-based ways of
doing things.

Almost.  Better "please use things that Microsoft would
use (or would advocate using) were they undertaking the
current task".

If you could cite any mention of the word "idiot" in my
messages, I will gladly withdraw it and apologise to all
concerned.  But I don't think you will find any such thing.

I have no intentions whatsoever of annoying anyone;
my sole desire is to make life simpler for those
undertaking the difficult task of making TeX Live
work reliably under Windows.

I don't think that your hindsight pontifications are contributing
anything to that.  Without actual exposure to Windows internals, you
won't be able to contribute anything worthwhile to those working with
those internals, least of all advice.

I have at several venues been forced (partly due to choices stemming
from my own naivety about just how bad a market leader could botch up
his main product) to support and implement software on Windows.  The
people putting up with porting to Windows have my utmost respect partly
because of my own experiences.  They certainly are far beyond the stage
where the level of advice you volunteer is anything short of ridiculous.

So if they are venting in the course of doing work for the sake of your
chosen platform, I strongly recommend you don't follow your "desire to
make life simpler" for them by proferring simplistic advice.  It not
only does not work, but it also sours the task even more.

If you think you can do better than those that do the work, join them
and do some of the work yourself.

Why don't you leave it to those actually
doing the work to pronounce on this,
David, rather than making yourself their
self-appointed spokesman.

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc + AR9 on win32
Message-ID: <48C909AC.9070709@elzevir.fr>

Hi,

I commited yesterday a change to the wrapper for texdoc on win32, that
is supposed to work around the problem. Unfortunately, I realised only
today that a left debugging code uncommented at commit time :-( So
today's texdoc update should be bogous and tomorrow it should be ok again.

For those of you who want to test the thing right now (which would be
appreciated), you can just unzip the following in bin/win32:

http://tug.org/texdoc/fix-texdoc-w32-ar9.zip

It works on my installation, so I hope it will for for you too.

This doesn't mean that we have understood the problem, so investigation
and relevant information about the problem is still welcome. For the
record, the minimal example is:

% wrapper.tlu
kpse.set_program_name('texlua')
os.spawn('texlua c:/tmp/program/tlu')

% program.tlu
os.execute('start c:\\tmp\\file.pdf')

(so, two files, total 3 lines of code). Assume the two files are in
c:\tmp, file.pdf exists, an AR9 is used by start to open the pdf files.
Then cd to c:\tmp and type "texlua wrapper.tlu", AR9 starts and crashes.
(Well, AR8.1 and AA9 too...)

OK, modulo the typo at "c:/tmp/program/tlu"
I can replicate and confirm all that; I can
also confirm that TeXLua doesn't crash AR8.1
if launched directly on "program.tlu", and
does crash when launched on "wrapper.tlu"
even if the contents of "program.tlu"
are replaced by :

	os.execute('Rundll32 Shell32,ShellExec_RunDLL c:\\tmp\\file.pdf')

Thus everything seems to point at kpse.set_program_name('texlua')
as being the culprit; who can look inside kpse.set_program_name ?

I cannot reproduce the crash on XP.
But it was known that western XP seemed different
than japanese one, so my example may not be helpful...

texlua wrapper.tlu works fine for the following with AR9:

-- wrapper.tlu
kpse.set_program_name('texlua')
command={}
-- both work with and without the next line
command[0]='texlua'
command[1]='texlua'
command[2]='e:/send/program.tlu'
command[3]="e:/send/pic.pdf"
os.spawn(command)


-- program.tlu
str='start '..'""'..' "'..arg[1]..'"'
os.execute(str)

Best,
Akira

Yep, this is the problem: we need such wrapper on windows.

Not exactly. It's true that the problem disappears if you comment this
line, but it also disappears if you replace os.spawn with os.execute.

> 
Well, I did look into it but couldn't find anything that looked
suspicious to me. I'm afraid that the culprit lies in some weird
interaction between os.spawn, os.execute (ie, the underlying system
calls), kpse and some versions of AR. I'm also afraid the problem is too
intricate and too "hardcore" (syscalls etc, a debugger would probably be
of some use) for me.

Fine.  I normally look quite carefully at the
"Junk" folder before deleting its contents,
but RHUoL now has an off-site spam filter
as well, so it may be held there (I don't
look at that one too often ...).

Hello,

I installed TL08 today under Win XP and I'm experiencing a big (for
me) problem with the babel package. Everytime, I compile a file (with
pdflatex), which loads the babel package (with any language-option) I
get the following error:

))

In that case it was compiled with the option ngerman. It's a serious
problem for me, because I need TeX for my work and I'm in a hurry...
The only solution, which I see now is to download and install MikTeX,
but it also will take about 1-2 hours.
I persume, it's maybe a problem of babel not the installation itself,
but maybe it is a matter of some configuration file, which needs to be
corrected. I didn't have this problem with my previous installation of
TL08, which was about 2-3 months old.

Here the minimal example:
  \documentclass{report}
  \usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  \end{document}

I would be really thankfull, if you could help,

Ok, so you're the second person to have no crash (the example works on
Hans' computer too). Just curious, which version of luatex did you use
for the tests? Here I'm using the version from TL'08, namely:

C:\Documents and Settings\manu>texlua --version
This is LuaTeX, Version snapshot-0.25.4-2008071819

Unfortunately, it does not work on my box either.

Do you have any idea what where the culprit could lie (code of kpse, of
os.spawn, particular system calls, etc.)?

Thanks for you help,
Manuel.

Yes. It has only been tested on my box for the moment. And since
apparently the problem varies with different versions of windows, the
more people will test it, the more I wil be confident that it actually
works around the problem.

It helped! Thanks!
I actually did rebuild all the formats using the GUI, but it didn't
help at all. What's the difference between rebuilding all the formats
via GUI and rebuilding only pdflatex via command line?

It seems that GUI is confused by some relicts of old installations
while the command line is not. They should be equivalent.

Is it an issue of system-wide vs. per-user formats? If the GUI  
rebuilds system-wide formats, but the user has old versions in a  
personal tree within the HOME folder, those will still override the  
newly-built ones.

That's interesting, since I removed the old installation (via System
preferences -> Software -> TeX Live 2008 -> Remove) before installing
the new one.

I've tested by both of 0.25.4 and the latest revision 1462.
The very original texdoc with the tl-w32-wrapper.texlua
works fine with AR9. Therefore my case is not helpful in the
present problem.

I just added it in the svn [1]. It will be available tomorrow (or the

collection-latexextra installed, it should install automatically by just
asking for a general update. Otherwise, you'll have to install it manually.

Hi,

Someone reported on the GUTenberg mailing list that he's having problems
with pdf inclusion via pdflatex: not enough space on hard disk. The
files where working properly with mactex 2007.

Could it be another instance of the pdftex LFS bug that was already
observed on SPARC? I've ask the OP to confirm the architecture in case
there could be a difference between intel and powerpc.

If this is confirmed, the darwin pdftex binaries need to be rebuild, right?

Manuel.

ANd that is what we are doing, we had to switch to temp files instead of
pipes due *only* to windows. But to keep things as uniform across
platforms as possible, it is now the same way on unix, a pity.

It is easy to do what you suggest when you write a Windows only program,
but mark that the installer, the tlmgr, and all the stuff should work on
all supported architectures, and we are not able to write two different
versions, one for unix one for windows.

But your contributions are far away from the problems we are facing. THe
usage of temp files has been done since ages, there are much more
difficult things, like the peculairities of Perl/Tk on Win vs Unix. And
none of us, and I assume you not either, are able to hack the code of
PerlTk and fix it. 

Actually, since I have written most of the things I have to say that I
comletely ignore this thread since I don't see anything useful up to
now.

It's probably PPC (big-endian).

I think *all* the pdftex binaries should be rebuilt without LFS (until  
the source is really fixed). I believe the problem manifests primarily  
on big-endian architectures, but would probably affect little-endian  
ones if really large files were involved.

  The user just confirmed: PowerBook G4 Titanium, 1GB RAM, with more
than 30GB available on hard drive.

  Does this mean that we should expect TeX Live 2008's pdfTeX to be
broken on every big endian processor? At least we're fortunate that
Intel is dominating the processor market nowadays :-/

Yes, all fair comment Norbert : I do not

To be honest, I don't even /have/ Perl/TK : is it pure PERL,
or is it a lower-level interface between PERL and the host
operating system ?

I'm sorry you feel that way : I had hoped that we might
eventually be able to identify what is causing TeXdoc
to crash AR 8.1/9.

    broken on every big endian processor? 

Evidently.  Despite all the testing that Thanh and I and others did on
the largefile stuff.  What an enormous drag!  I don't suppose anyone
would finally like to volunteer to set up a proper regression test
infrastructure?  (I made a start on it, but ...)

Now I wonder about delaying production :( :(.  I'm not all that worried
about sparc, but powerpc breakage seems like it will hit a large number
of users.  I'd hate to give out a hundred DVD's at a math conference to
Mac users knowing that their first pdf inclusion is going to crash.

Manfred?  Can I give you a new image?

Dick -- please rebuild asap.  Since Martin made the change in the Build
script (thanks Martin), it should be enough to do what you normally do.

today I tried the TL2008 installation on Vista 64 Ultimate SP1 + updates
and it worked "fine" for me.  

minor(?) details:

installation into the default path (C:/Programme (x86)/ ...) did not work for me
("no permissions bla bla" -- right mouse button "starting as admin" did not help), 
so I tried to install into my $home hitting the next problem with the 
german vista setup, me knowing close to nothing about non-X11-windows and M$;) :

the explorer showed C:/Benutzer/Harald where again I got "wrong/missing permissions" 
as install path/root -- I had to enter ~/... or C:/Users/Harald and installation
when fine (but quite slow compared to Linux -- both using a usb stick with *.tar.lzha
packages;)   btw: in cmd.exe "dir c:/benutzer/" doesn't work either, it seems that
only the explorer does this translation from Users to Benutzer -- thanks M$ :-(

OMg, sorry I send you the bad versin too. You can get the good version
(I hope) from the link mentionned in my message to the list:

http://tug.org/texdoc/fix-texdoc-w32-ar9.zip

or by changing

into

near the end of the texlua file (the block ending with os.exit()). If
your editor has support for lua, you'll see that it changes a
single-line comment into a multi-line one: a difference that matters :-)

I am well aware.  That is what Thanh and I did test a million times
before the release.  Obviously it is insufficient :(.

Anyway, I specifically said "set up a proper test regression
infrastructure".  (Not that I seriously expected anyone to jump at the
chance. :)  It is not hard to construct individual tests and run them in
an ad hoc way, and that is what we do now.  It is setting up something
systematic that is painful, time-consuming, and has not been done.  See
Master/support/tests in the repo for my first attempts at it, some years
ago.

Now the tarball contains XeTeX statically linked. TL has been built on
Cygwin with

    ./Build --without-graphite

and with some patches and workarounds which solve the problems we meet
these days.

Thanks to the work of Rodrigo Medina who opened the way...

note that on my AIX box xetex does not start because of "memory exhausted" message:

http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2008-September/017734.html

do you have an idea on what could be wrong?

small note: just running "pdftex -ini \\relax" and looking at the
process memory usage, i see it uses 6864 Kb of resident memory (73356
VIRT) on my linux box.

but for "xetex -ini \relax", i see:

 TL2008: 128m RES, 239m VIRT
 TL2007: 14m RES, 95m VIRT

why did xetex's memory usage so much increased compared to TL2007?

Is the bug supposed to affect the inclusion of any pdf, then? Or what
are the criteria?

    Is the bug supposed to affect the inclusion of any pdf, then? 

It doesn't do that.

    Or what are the criteria?

The definite problem is on BigEndian machines such as sparc, where
pdftex was compiled with largefile (>2gb) support enabled.

However, the powerpc binaries were already compiled without largefile
support.  But a different user reported a crash there too.
Investigation continues.

Hi all,

Since I reported on list this report form a GUT user, but it finally
looks like the problem needs investigation, I forward the relevant part
of it with rough translation. The example as the OP posted it can be
found at:

http://tug.org/~mpg/ECM.zip

HTH,
Manuel.

Here is the first message (excerpt):

Ici j'ai un autre probl?me je n'arrive pas ? inclure des graphiques pdf.

Avant mon passage ? TexLive 2007, je n'avais pas de probl?me.

Basically:
I can't include pdf's (either from metapost or from Maple). Here is aCME
[attached]. In either case pdflatex blocks saying 'not enough space on

Then a second message, after I asked a few more questions:

I kindly asked the OP if he can try again with a clean install of
current TL'08. We'll see (tomorrow I hope).

Yes. G3, G4, G5 are all PPC.

Definitely possible to include *some* PDFs here (G4) - which was why I asked
what criteria the PDFs meet which trigger the problem. But maybe that's
part of what you are trying to discover...

AFAIK, it is either possible to include pdfs without any problem, or it
always results in \HUGE files.

The last idea is that the OP might be running a pre-release version of
pdftex which has the LFS problem, while the current doesn't have it any
more.

Anyway, good to know that it's not brokent everywhere :-)

Hi Phil,
we tried to avoid scratch files for many reasons.  They are less
efficient than pipes, especially because you need CPU time for
decompressing the files but your CPU is bored when you download them.
Hence it's better to do both things at the same time.

But there are some Windows related issues: %TEMP% contains the user
name and we have to convert backslashes to forward slashes in Perl.
This will only work with ASCII, ISO-8859, or Unicode.  A Chinese
reported a problem with TL-2007 on this mailing list.  I sent him a
Perl script which converts the content of %TEMP% to hex but the result
was not very promising.  No idea how to solve such problems.

There is also c:/windows/temp which seems to be writable by mortal
users but it's quite unclear how Microsoft treats it in the future.

We also don't want to leave scratch files if the install process is
aborted for some reason.  On Unix one would provide signal
handlers.  But they don't work on Windows, except if you type ^C.

The installer uses scratch files now.  Not because we like them.  On
Windows we have no other choice.

No need to use copy at all.  This was only an example.  And we don't
use it.  There is a Perl function in TLUtils.pm which is completely
platform independent.  It only uses low-level system calls like
open(), close(), read(), and write().  I hoped that we can do other
things similarly but Windows is always the bottleneck.

The Microsoft C runtime library tries to provide some Unix
functionality.  It provides functions like stat() and umask(), for
example.  However, if we are only regarding Windows, it doesn't
necesarily mean that these flags exist at all.  Microsoft just claims
that a file is regarded as an executable file if its extension is
mentioned in %PATHEXT%.  But since I can change the behavior using
Cygwin's chmod(), there must be a flag which I can turn on or off and
Microsoft doesn't tell the whole truth.

I don't remember, but whenever I say "Microsoft claims", there are
only two sources I got information from:

 1. AFIR, you or Jerzy sometimes provided links to the "Microsoft
    knowledge base".  Google often points me to it too.

 2. The sources of the Microsoft C runtime library.  I'm not a C
    programmer but the functions are commented and at least each one
    contains a brief description about what it's supposed to do.

Manuel, you asked for a debugger.  Do you need a debugger for
executables compiled with the Microsoft C compiler?

You can download the Microsoft C compiler freely.  It's very likely
that a debugger is provided.  I don't know.  I didn't look into the
license but I supppose it's a "free-beer" one.  You are probably not
allowed to make the beer you already drunk available to other people.

Search Google for "microsoft visual c++".

The Microsoft C compiler contains the source code and header files of
the C runtime library which is used by all programs.  Hence, it's a
good reference.

Regards,
  Reinhard

use File::Temp qw(tempfile tmpnam);
see how it is done in xindy and texindy perl scripts.

For whatever it's worth, I included three pdf files in one (using
pdflatex --shell-escape --synctex=1) and got a 320KB file. I have a
later machine than the OP (likely a faster processor), slightly more
RAM and significantly less free disk space. Still G4, though.

Even M$-DOG tried to support pipes somehow.  The only difference
between Windows and Unix is that pipes work on Unix for decades and
Microsoft is still trying to make them work.  I'm pretty sure that
pipes will work on Windows perfectly in 20 or 30 years.

Message-ID: <200809120048.m8C0m2g26371@f7.net>

I've run the test file Manuel reported on a ppc-darwin machine (thanks
as always to Nelson, our god of architecture availabilty :), and it ran
fine with the released TL'08.  It turns out that largefile support was
already disabled in the released powerpc binaries.

Therefore I don't want to make new images and further delay production +
possibly introduce new problems.  Users on other platforms are not
nearly as numerous as MacOSX, and running "tlmgr update pdftex" is not
an insuperable barrier.

Manfred, please proceed with the images you already have.

We should still update the binaries in the repository.  In addition to
the sparc and aix binaries that Vladimir and Arthur already committed, I
have committed new i386-linux, hp, and amd64-freebsd binaries.  Will do
the rest as they come in.  Other builders, fire away :).

Consider the repository thawed.

Norbert and I have made more updates to tlmgr.  We want to push this out
as soon as possible, since (among other things) this version "fixes" on
a given CTAN mirror for the duration of an update, a la install-tl.

But I'd really like to have other people test it (especially on Windows
and Mac), to make sure we haven't introduced new bugs.  As I wrote
before, just grab the current rev of tlmgr.pl from
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/ and put
it in your tree in that same location, texmf/scripts/texlive.

If you can test the GUI version, also take the new tlmgrgui-real.pl from
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui/.

Thanks,
Karl

Starting new stuff from svn (not only texmf/scripts/texlive, as Karl wrote, 
but also changed tlpkg/TeXLive/*)

c:\>C:/install-tl: No such file or directory at c:/Program Files/texlive/2008/te

OK, I moved before my old c:\install-tl to another location, just to 
start updating from the network. Changed via location tab to standard mirror, 
I got a new database, then selected some packages to update, and:
http://mirror.icis.pcz.pl/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008: No such file o

This mirror is enough fresh, so the problem is that changing location in GUI
via "Change location" tab semms to not work now (?) :(

Then, I changed location to ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008, again got
a new database, but, when trying to update single package:

OK, I changed the default location in Configuration tab and restarted

and

Just to make sure I understood correctly. There are no updates whatever 
to incorporate for TeXLive on the DVD which means that TeX Collection 
wise I proceed as if this discussion did never ever happen.  :-)

Maybe I don't understand what's going on, but I have both a Mac PPC  
system (dual processor G5, 2GHz, 1.5GB RAM, 8.64GB of free disk space)  
and a Mac Intel laptop. I just tried typesetting a book done  
originally in 2006 with gwTeX (which I no longer have).

This book uses more than 100 images; the heaviest PDF is 25MB file (as  
converted by Ghostscript 8.62; PDF press-ready by Adobe Distiller,  
just 11MB), from a 70MB Illustrator EPS.

Both Ghostscript *and Apple Distiller* had problems with some (about  
15) Photoshop EPS files (but not Illustrator or generic EPS files), so  
I used Adobe Distiller to distill those. This problem was both on PPC  
and Intel, exactly with the same images.

I don't recall this happening in the past; but anyway it wasn't a  
pdfTeX problem, but Ghostscript and Apple Distiller with Photoshop EPS.

In 2006, the book ended up as a 55MB PDF; now 84MB (maybe different  
compression of GS 8.53 I had used and GS 8.62 I use now); with Apple  
Distiller, 172MB!

If someone wants to take a look at the book I'm talking about, I made  
a huge, huge compression of it to put it in the web (but anyway,  
that's a 6MB PDF):

http://www.lmtgtm.org/gtm/book/librogtm.pdf

If someone wants me to do a test in my PPC, just tell me what files I  
should use. I tried connecting to

svn co http://scm.foundry.supelec.fr/svn/pdftex/tests/lfs

but I couldn't either as anonymous (password email) or leaving the  
fields blank.

OK, I have a virgin machine (recently re-commissioned)
on which I can test : should I follow the main link
from Tug.Org to get the current "Install-TL" kit
from CTAN, overwrite a part of its contents with the
two updated components you list, and then try a full
install, or is there a better methodology for testing ?

I finally turns out that the OP had a weird installation with a pdftex

and installed a clean TL'08, everything works ok for him.

So, case closed. And sorry for the false alarm.

Ah, obviously I was mistaken : there /is/

But the installer launches the TeX Live
manager, does it not ?  Confused !

Message-ID: <74f506dc0809120709o476d43b7o38f603132fb2ef41@mail.gmail.com>

Some more relevant info about the problem:

- LFS was added to pdftex since version 1.40.6. It was
  enabled by default. To disable it, one must run
  "configure" with the option "--disable-largefile".

- also starting from version 1.40.6, the "build.sh" script
  coming with pdftex sources tarball has the option
  "--disable-largefile" when calling "configure". This means
  that pdftex compiled from sources will have LFS disabled
  by default, unless one changes the "build.sh" script to
  remove that option to enable LFS, or skips "build.sh" and
  calls "configure" by himself.

- the "Build" script used to build texlive does NOT have the
  option "--disable-largefile" by default, which means that
  TL is built with LFS enabled by default.

- LFS has been broken on some systems since 1.40.6:
    - on Solaris SPARC: 1.40.6--1.40.9 have the same problem as current TL
    - on MacOSX PowerPC:
        - 1.40.6: pdftex failed with a message
          "Invalid argument". A google search shows that
          a similar problem was discussed on the context list:
          http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-context/2008/031066.html

$ tlmgr --version
Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at
/export/home/gwhite/texlive/2008/bin/sparc-solaris/tlmgr line 82.
tlmgr revision
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008

[note the missing revision number].  Other than that, it worked for me on
Solaris 10 sparc and Leopard (OSX 10.5.4) intel in very limited tests,
including
updates using a mirror site.

$ tlmgr --gui

/usr/texbin/tlmgr line 82.

The GUI seemed to work normally in limited tests.

    Ah, obviously I was mistaken : there /is/
    no "tlmgr.pl" in the installation kit.
    But the installer launches the TeX Live
    manager, does it not ?  Confused !

I have been confused about this too.  The installer does *not* run
tlmgr.  It is its own program.  Both install-tl and tlmgr use the same
Perl library code in tlpkg/TeXLive for most of the real work, but they
have lots of their own unique code, too.

So it is normal.  Proceed at will.  I.e., do the install, then after the
installation update the two files.

*Except*, everyone, please wait until we've fixed the latest reports of
 the "uninitialized value" buglet.

   is there a better methodology for testing ?

I don't have any specific advice; in general, doing whatever you would
do normally is probably the best test.

OK, thanks Karl (I had begun to think the
entire team was on holiday!).  In that
case I will do a minimal install (have not
done one of these before), overwrite the
two files with copies from SVN (once you
have announced the bug has been fixed),
then attempt to do a maximal upgrade.

I have to be honest and say I don't
"normally" do anything with the manager :
I do a full install, and then an upgrade
when/if anything significant is announced.

PLEASE ignore this error!!! It is NOT a real one. It only happens when
you download the tlmgr.pl from the web page. In that case the top code
line is:
	my $svnrev = '$Revision$';
while in the real package it is created from a checkout and thus
$Revision$ will be expanded to the revision number, as in my file
	my $svnrev = '$Revision: 10562 $';

So that is NOT a bug.

Still, I have fixed it so that it will report
	unknown

Subject: [tex-live] pdftex LFS bug: on mac too?
Message-ID: <74f506dc0809121050u6b9412a1gc1538a34e6efc5f6@mail.gmail.com>

I reported what I found after some investigation and
testing. If most of this is already known to you, then I
applogize for posting them.

Martin has already provided a good fix for TL: added
--disable-largefile to the Build script. A slightly better
fix is to disable LFS support by default, and change
--disable-largefile to --enable-largefile

Someone may want to fix the config stuff to get LFS working
on all systems. It seems hard to me so I will not try that.
I vote for disabling LFS by default, and document that
enabling LFS might break things on some systems.

Regards test case: I will submit I I have to TL, if Karl
agrees. However, it's not anything close to systematic.

Regards,
Thanh

OK, just started a minimal install :
the Install-GUI dialogue box bug
is still very obvious -- having
removed everything before /2008,
and inserted F:/TeX/Live, the "OK"
button was completely dysfunctional
even after advancing the cursor one
character at a time using the right
cursor key until it was after the 2008.
Even then, "OK" remained dysfunctional,
and the only way of continuing was to
hit <return>.

I thought the error I was seeing with the trial version of tlmgr was
the same error but now I'm not sure. So just in case:

I tried to set the default install location back to its default value
since there seemed little point in testing the trial version with a
static installation site (which I'd previously set as a work around).

i.e. tlmgr option location
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

Result:

Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/texbin/tlmgr line 842, <TMP> line 90451.
Setting default installation location to !
Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line
835, <TMP> line 90451.

The attempt set the default installation location to the empty string,
I think. At least, checking it got:

Default installtion location:

This seemed so similar to the bug people were seeing when checking the
version I thought it was probably the same. But this *does* seem like a
real bug...?

Fixed in tlmgr.pl revision 10574. Please get it, replace your current
copy, and again call

Yes, real bug. Sorry, I introduced it when I tried to deal with Phil's
bug report on c:/foo/bar vs c:\foo\bar. Again, abs_path("http://...")
returns "". Bummer.

As I wrote, I started tlmgr gui. As you can see
"c:/install-tl" and then "ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008" are copy-paste
from cmd window messages of tlmgr.

Sure, otherwise I couldn't start tlmgr :-) I installed TL just after it
was frozen and now wanted to update it using the current scripts/texlive 
and tlpkg/TeXLive.

It just does a different job. At least, insofar as I understand these
things:
- detex strips out TeX/LaTeX macros
- de-macro eliminates *private* LaTeX macros defined with \newcommand
   etc. and replaces them with non-private equivalents. So it won't do
   anything for private macros defined in other ways (e.g. with \def)
   but if you use the LaTeX syntax, the macro will be expanded and each
   call to the macro will be replaced with its expansion.
So the first is useful for getting a more accurate word count while the
second might be useful in preparing a file for exchange or
post-processing.

Yes...  and if python is not in /usr/bin... (I'd expect it to use
/usr/bin/env but maybe that creates other incompatibilities...)

I deliberately re-titled the thread so as
not to confuse.  I also would have thought
that the more detailed a bug report can
be (and this is more detailed than any
previous report I have made on this topic),
the greater the probability that the
cause can be identified and fixed.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr: permissions on /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.1.10.0809122009290.8091@cyfrifiadurcfr.local>

What role does /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma play?

The reason I ask is that if I run tlmgr with root privileges e.g. to do
"tlmgr update --all" and later run it without e.g. to do "tlmgr update
--list" or "tlmgr list", I get a message complaining that permissions
are denied for /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma. The permissions are 0644 with
ownership root:wheel. I assume that tlmgr wants to replace
/tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma or something similar rather than just reading
it.

The commands seem to work anyway - I still get listings - but I'm
wondering if it would prevent me from getting updated listings, for
example, if tlmgr will be forced to rely on a stale copy of
/tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma because it cannot be replaced.

I don't have a clue what /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma does, though, so the
concern could be entirely misguided and the error purely cosmetic.

Thanks,
cfr

This happens when you run  %tlmgr ...
after
%sudo tlmgr

obviously you as you do not have the same privileges as a root

The updated machine (Mac Intel, 10.5.4), tlmgr.pl 10574 and tlmgrgui- 
real.pl 10471, shows the actual installation source (in my case,  
``Current installation source: http://tezcatl.fciencias.unam.mx...'').

The not-yet-updated machine (Mac PPC, 10.5.4) shows the ``generic''  
source: http://mirror.ctan.org...

Both show the same collections, binaries and packages to be updated.

Currently doing the update in the Mac Intel machine; I'll let you know  
if there are any problems.

One more thing ---I see that some other files in

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/

are newer than the ones I have, say texdoc.tlu ---will they be updated  
or do I have to download them as well?

tlmgr should not create predictable file names (such as /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma)
in public locations, this is a security hole.

As I guess you realized subsequently, the normal update should get it --
"tlmgr update bin-texdoc".  I can see I should have somehow found the
time to deal with those annoying bin- prefixes before the release.
(There is no consistency and no way to know when bin- is used and when
it isn't.  Oh well.)

    What role does /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma play?

We download the compressed version, then unpack it and put it in the
texmf hierarchy.  It's not relevant after that.  (I wasn't aware
actually we used /tmp, but I assume that is the story.)  We should
probably at least delete it after we are done if everything was
successful.

Meanwhile, indeed, you can't download as root and then as non-root.
Remove the file if you have such a permission error.

Or so it seems to me ... it's always hard to envision the exact state of
everyone's system from afar.

karl

Both /tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma and /tmp/texlive.tlpdb are problematic,

Indeed, it has been updated already.

Except that texlive.tlpdb can also end up in /tmp. Specifically, I have:
 	/tmp/texlive.tlpdb
 	/tmp/texlive.tlpdb.lzma
 	/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
All are owned by root:wheel with 0644 permissions. The copies of
texlive.tlpdb in /tmp and in .../tlpkg differ. The version in /tmp
appears to be newer than the version in the texlive tree - revision
8538 vs. 8535.

Not surprising.

PLEASE:
- fetch  current tlmgr.pl AND TLPDB.pm
- as root call tlmgr update --list
- as normal user try tlmgr update --list

Actually my observation is a bit more nuanced: after running as root
and then as a garden variety user it reports an error but performs
anyway. Next time as a user no error report

Here is a short report of a "dumb user" test :

I downloaded rev 10574.

I tried a "tlmgr update --all"
I got a message saying :
http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 
  no such file or directory at C:/Program 
Files/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive.tlmgr.pl line 1052

So, I tried the gui :
tlmgr --gui
The information window gave a more informative text :
(sorry, I try to translate the french message back to english...)
"The  database of the installation source was not loaded
Please use the "load" button (and maybe "Modify")"
So I hit the "modify" button, then "default network location"
and it selected automaticaly the "mirror.ctan.org" site.

The "loading TLPDB" lasted about two minutes, then I went to the 
"update" panel.
The top message box still showed the 
"http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008" 
adress (was the "modification" not taken into account, or did the mirror 
system send me back to the same mirror ?)

Then, I clicked and "update all".
It ended very quickly, with the same "no such file or directory " 
message in the command window.

I tried the "configuration" window, and the "Default installation 
source" item. with the "modify" buton, I could set the value to the 
"mirror.ctan.org" site.
But the upper text window was still showing the ipsl address, and
any attempt to update (either one or all packages) failed.

So, I re-tried the modify button next to the "installation source" text 
window. This time, mirror.ctan.org chose another location 
("ftp://ftp.inria.fr/pub/TeX/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008")

But, no way ! still got the same messages 
("ftp://ftp.inria.fr/pub/TeX/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 : no such 
file or directory at C:/Program 
Files/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive.tlmgr.pl line 1052)

Another try from the command ligne (tlmgr update --all 
--location=ftp://ftp.inria.fr/pub/TeX/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
)
gave the same result

A final try :
tlmgr update --all --location=http://mirror.ctan.org/
wasn't more successful than the former ones.

Do I need to read more doc, or am I especialy unlucky, or else ?

When I type "perl --version" on my command line, I learn that it is 
Active Perl V5.10.0 responding. Could it be a bad interference with TL's 
perl ?

Twice now my minimal install has hung at
TeXlive.intra.win32; on checking, I see
that the tmp directory is on the K: drive,
which has less than 300Mb free.  Is it
possible that K: reaches fullness at
TeXlive.intra.win32 but that the installer

Hi Axel,

    In 2006, the book ended up as a 55MB PDF; now 84MB (maybe different  
    compression of GS 8.53 I had used and GS 8.62 I use now); with Apple  
    Distiller, 172MB!

Sorry, no clue, different issue for sure.  Thanks for offering to test
things, as always.

    I tried connecting to

    svn co http://scm.foundry.supelec.fr/svn/pdftex/tests/lfs

    but I couldn't either as anonymous (password email) or leaving the  
    fields blank.

I don't know why that would fail, but I haven't checked out the pdftex
source for a while.  Maybe Martin or Thanh can see something quickly in
the above.  Not that the lfs test files there are anything you need to
try now.

If it is full then the installer will not notice it.

We are investigating that ... please wait with further checks.

It seems that Perl on Win32 is broken with respect to calling abs_path,
no idea where this problem comes from.

That works great - it cleaned up the existing files in /tmp and,
presumably, cleaned up after itself, too.

could you please tell me one thing:

Can you USE the installation source?

Can you call
	tlmgr install <some-package>
and it is getting actually installed?

In this case I would expect that the above is just a dummy error message
when calling abs_path on a URL (http/ftp) and other than that it works
anyway.

Please check!!!

Yes, it probably selected the same mirror.

Yes, it has to be due to GS and Apple Distiller compressions (I think  
the latter doesn't compress at all). If I use the previously (2006)  
generated PDF files, the book ends up the same as before: ~55MB.

I misunderstood completely. I thought they have put there files for us

I now think this was not the cause of
the problem; after moving TEMP to the
SCSI drive, with 15Gb free, the installer
hung in exactly the same place.  The file
can be fetched (I checked from another
machine), and I have now found that
although all TeX environment variables
were cleared, there were still traces of
an old TeX and Perl in the path.  These
have now been removed, but the installer
still hangs at TeXlive.infra.win32.  The
next step was to remove E:\Layered products\Programs
from the path (this directory contains the GNU
utilities for Windows); the installer still
hangs at the same place.  Leaving the task
manager running shews /two/ instances of
[Red hieroglyphs]Install-tl; the second
appears at the moment the installer hangs.
Both are reported by the task manager to
be not responding.  I have now eliminated
every possibility that I can find, and
testing is now suspended until someone
can suggest why it might hang at this
point, and how to cure it.  I should
add that this is being carried out
using Remote Desktop, as the new system
has no physical HIDs.

The installer is also continuing to report
a number of MD5 problems.

A recent message from Alex indicates that he has
had to give up trying to support Acrobat 9 in
WinEDT.  He recommends instead Pdf-Xchange.
I have no experience of the latter, but given
the problems the team are having in reliably
firing up both AR 8.1 and AR 9, is there any
merit in considering bundling a PDF viewer such
as Pdf-Xchange with TeX Live and ensuring that
/it/ is launched preferentially to AR from TeXdoc ?

Message-ID: <48CAEBE7.9080200@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi Norbert,

testing with the following script revisions:

tlmgr.pl 	  -> 10577,
tlmgrgui-real.pl  -> 10471,

test conditions: fresh Windows XP SP3 virtual machine, fresh
Scheme-Medium TL install from ISO, scripts replaced.


I get errors of the following kind for different mirrors:

ftp://ftp.mpi-sb.mpg.de/pub/tex/mirror/ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008:
No such file or directory at
c:/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl line 1056

(Not line 1052 in my case)

When invoking the console version (i.e. C:\>tlmgr --location
http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 update -all
-dry-run), I get them immediately.

When using the GUI, retrieval of the database seems to work (i.e. some
packages are shown as updatable), but selecting some or using the
update-all-button finishes without error in under 3 seconds. Obviously
nothing happens on the network interface and the corresponding console
window shows an error message like above.

Installing new packages (e.g. tlmgr install kpfonts) breaks with the
same error.

Cross check with the scripts from ISO: Fetching and installing updates
works. So does installing a new package.

Hope this helps,
 Gregor

Yes, because probably tlmgr dies, and tlmgrgui only calls tlmgr.

Please fetch new tlmgr and retest. Thanks.

I cannot confirm that. Here hitting Enter OR clicking the OK button both

Could it be that you have some program installed that hacks into the
keyboard driver, mouse driver, or anything else???

So is it a Remote Desktop without HDD or an scsi drive with 15Gb free?

I cannot reproduce that either, sorry.

I just installed scheme-medium and it worked without any complaints.

installation source was linux server running apache on the host system,
and the win xp was in a kvm client system, so runnin gof the network

Hi Phil,
yes, Manuel mentioned this on one of his mails already.  From all I've
seen so far, I deduce that we can be sure now that AR does *not*
crash when it is processing the argument vector.  No, the crash
happens later and we should have recognized this *much* erarlier.  

I always had Fengnan's message from Aug 31 in mind but I never had
been able to draw any conclusions from it.

This is very useful hint.

Arguments are passed to a program before it can do anything useful.
This means that it gets its argument vector before it knows whether it
is already running.  It always gets the same argument list.  I suppose
that there is nothing wrong with os.spawn() in this respect.

But maybe there is something we neglected.  We concentrated on the
argument vector but maybe the problem is caused by the environment.

Phil, if you say 'start foo.pdf' then start associates .pdf with
acrod32.exe.  Suppose that if you replace foo.pdf by foo.bat, cmd.exe
will be invoked.  Right?

Then you can explore the environment easily if the batch file contains 

   set > c:\temp\env.txt

It is extremely helpful to know how the environment looks like.

And it is extremely helpful to find out whether kpse.set_program_name
is the culprit.  Maybe it changes the environment.  

I'm quite convinced that there is something wrong with luatex.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Meik,

    - - "texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/pdftex-a.pdf" pointing to
    http://www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/pdftex-a.pdf
    - - "texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/samplepdf/samplepdf.tex" ponting to
    http://www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/samplepdf/samplepdf.tex

Thanks for the report.  Unfortunately I fear there are quite a few
broken links in the manual, we did not have time to systematically check
and fix them all before the release.  (Volunteers welcome. :)  

I am not exactly sure what went wrong with our macros here, as the
relative location is correct.  That is, you can find these files in the
TL distribution in the texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/ subdirectory, but
unfortunately (again) they still date from 2007.  (I have not had a
chance to check yet if newer ones are available.)

Thanks again,
Karl

    two odd things noticed on AIX:

    1) pdftex prints some garbage to terminal and to the log instead

Possibly a compiler bug?  Anyway, if it only happens on AIX, I fear
you're the only one who can debug it ...

    2) xetex does not work on aix, it produces an error when generating a
       format file, and actually even when starting in INITEX mode:

        $ xetex -ini 
        fatal: memory exhausted (xmalloc of 72367120 bytes).

Well, that at least should be debuggable, e.g., run it under the
debugger, trap the exit in xmalloc.c, and then run ps on the process to
see how much it's really using.

   i wonder if this failure is just because of insufficient memory, 

It should run in 768mb of memory!  Sheesh.

   or a bug. 
   are there some "aggressive" limits for xetex set in texmf.cnf?

I don't think xetex is any more aggressive than anything else.
Everything allocates a ton of stuff these days.

I can think of no such program.  Can you confirm
how you eliminated the text prior to "/2008" :
was it click-at-end-, reverse-drag (the technique
I would normally use), or some other such as
select-insertion-point, use delete or backspace
key ?

I will repeat once more, since the installation is
still hung at TeXlive.infra.win32 ---

I cannot replicate it on this occasion; click-and
reverse drag still causes major problems (the inserted
tests is highlit and self-deleting) but I cannot
replicate the dysfunctional [OK] button this morning.

The problem has now disappeared.  I removed
all non-essentials from the taskbar notification
area (and hence stopped them running), ran SysInternals
"Filemon" to watch the installation drive in
the hopes of being able to identify the cause
of the hang, and repeated the installation.
On this occasion it got past TeXlive.infra.win32
with no apparent difficulty, although I see from

   Thanks, It works well.

   I'm sorry I cant give a definite answer to your question in your 
former e-mail : ("Can you USE the installation source?") : I've uploaded 
   rev 10579 before I could check.

    Currently, a command like "tlmgr install xlop" works OK (from the 
IPSL.jussieu mirror).

     Is it worth re-checking with an older revision ?

Bruno.

Message-ID: <48CB71DE.6080103@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Having now installed Scheme: minimal on my
test machine, and downloaded and installed
"tlmgr.pl" and "tlmgrgui-real.pl" as
requested by Karl, I am attempting to
upgrade to Scheme: full.  I downloaded
the remote database as instructed by
the GUI, entered "scheme-full" in the
search dialogue box, located the
scheme and instructed it to install
(the text "without depends" nearby is
not English : it should read "without
dependencies").  However, the "[red
hieroglyphics] tlmgr process" box in
which I was told to expect to be able
to observe progress remains steadfastly
blank, and the task manager informs me
I have two instances of "[red hieroglyphics]
tlmgr 2008" that are not responding.  The
SCSI disc on which TeX Live is installed
and on which temporary files are now stored
continues to make "I am being accessed" noises.
SysInternals "Filemon" tells me much is happening
on the F: (SCSI) drive, involving Wget, Perl,
Tar, Nod32, and occasionally Explorer.

Should I be able to observe progress in the
"[red hieroglyphics] tlmgr process" box, or
will nothing appear there until the installation
has completed or aborted ?

I don't expect this to change until the Win32 Perl/Tk gets updated.
It will be a while before I get to it, but I'll announce it to this
list when that happens. Until then, more reports about this bug are
not useful.

Hmmm, bundling binary programs is always difficult, and since so many
people already have their own PDF viewer installed.

As a user, I'd rather expect texdoc to launch what *I* have take to
define as my default viewer (I have my own reasons, don't I?).

Anyway, I don't think it would be worth the pain.

You're right. I remember interpreting it as "this problem is getting

useful :-)

I was thinking about that. kpse does indeed set envars. From a quick
test on my linux box,

engine=luatex
SELFAUTODIR=/home/mpg/tl/svn/Master/bin
SELFAUTOPARENT=/home/mpg/tl/svn/Master
SELFAUTOLOC=/home/mpg/tl/svn/Master/bin/x86_64-linux
progname=texlua

are new in the environment after kpse.set_program_name('texlua')

However, we will have to understand why calling kpse in the program
itselft never hurts, while calling it in the wrapper hurts (and only if
the wrapper calls the program using os.spawn()) if we ant to explain the
problem from the environment. Anyway, I think it's worth exploring this
idea, it can indeed learn us interesting things.

So am I. But Hans being unable to reproduce the problem on his box
really doesn't help.

iirc, the URLs should be more or less ok on the DVD (with links into the
local TL after install). Wrong seem to be only the links in
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html, but this
could be repaired there any time.

Testing on Fedora 8 linux, some text is garbled in the gui (also version 10579):

$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 10579
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008
texlive-20080903
$ tlmgr show xlop
Package:   xlop
Category:  Package
ShortDesc: Calculates and displays arithmetic operations.
LongDesc:  Xlop (eXtra Large OPeration) will typeset arithmetic
problems either in-line or "as in school" (using French school
[...]
Installed: Yes

The same text displayed in the right-hand panel using tlmgr --gui
corrupts the quote marks.   I see "a" with a "hat", pasted
here indicates a couple other codes that are not displayed
by tlmgr's gui:

... arithmetic problems either in-line or ???as
in school???

For debugging purposes, it might be useful to have a dummy
package whose info includes a wide range of glyphs, or if the
double quotes are the only problem, just replace them with
the dual-porpose ascii versions

Btw -- xltxtra also uses open and closing double quotes.

Not surprising, that is a pain. The characters are probably UTF8 and the
GUI does not convert them from byte encoding.

And we don't use utf8 as input regime because none of us could figure it
out how it should actually be used, at least not me!

On Win32??? That is strange. Probably you always selected the same
destination folder and the download did hang on that out of strange
permission reasons.

Nothing to be done here, downloaded files  from user A should be

Right. On Win32 nothing will appear in that windopw. Isn't it written
like that??? Please wait until bla bla, the output will appear..

That is another instance of hacking around Windows because Perl/Tk
cannot use fork/pipe on win32. Pity. So I have to stall wait for the sub
process which takes long to finish.

i.e. 128MB are simply not enough to just start xetex -ini

 KB> I don't think xetex is any more aggressive than anything else.
 KB> Everything allocates a ton of stuff these days.

as i wrote in another email: just running "pdftex -ini \\relax" and
looking at the process memory usage, i see it uses 6864 Kb of resident
memory (and 73m VIRT) on my linux box.

but for "xetex -ini \\relax", i see:

 TL2008: 128m RES, 239m VIRT
 TL2007: 14m RES, 95m VIRT

why did xetex's memory usage so much increased compared to TL2007?
(14 MB => 128 MB just for inixetex)

It's useful of course, but the central criticism about this seems to be
that the license itself is unclear about that. In particular (quoting
from http://people.debian.org/~evan/ccsummary.html which is linked from
the wikipedia URL above as a citation), "It's not specified that a
licensee who has been asked to remove references to the licensor has the
requirements of attribution waived." In other words, there may be
conflicting requirements making the work undistributable. 

I admit that this is nitpicking, but that's what laywers usually do when
they want to win a case against you...

To me, the more important issue seems to be the DRM stuff. Reading this
as it is written, you may not transfer it via SSL, or send it in an
encrypted mail, or just have it on a shared disk protected from the
internet by the usual means.

In my opinion, if we regard it as a derived work, we must at the same
time allow this fair use. It's like parody, and art based on something
is fair use AFAIK.

OK, but all this is being done as Administrator,
there is no reason why the installer should
mark and file as being read-only to Administrator.

The more likely cause of "permission denied" is that
the file is still marked as open, for some reason.

Ah yes, I confess I didn't understand when
"bla bla" would be : I thought it would
say something as soon as the installation
proper started ...  But apart from the
error messages already reported, there is
no visible activity in the TeX Live Manager

good use of that box to display progress.
Could TLMGR not do the same ?

i've debugged it. it appears to be caused by a misfeature (or bug) of
the C pre-processor:

writet1.c contains

#define t1_log(s)        tex_printf("%s",s)

and then constructs such as

    t1_log(open_name_prefix);
    t1_log(cur_file_name);

get pre-processed to

    tex_printf("%open_name_prefix",open_name_prefix);
    tex_printf("%cur_file_name",cur_file_name);

instead of

    tex_printf("%s",open_name_prefix);
    tex_printf("%s",cur_file_name);

i fixed this by changing the define to

#define t1_log(str)      tex_printf("%s",str)

grepping texlive sources shows that this is probably the only place
which could cause such problem.

i'd like to ask pdftex maintainers to apply this patch to their master
sources and to texlive tree:

Mainly because of much bigger settings in texmf.cnf, I expect; things  
like main_memory, font_mem_size, max_strings, trie_size, etc have been  
vastly increased. And remember that in many cases, xetex is using  
larger units, so these increases have a proportionately larger effect.  
I haven't done the sums, but I suspect that accounts for a lot of it.

I'd expect that most of the main_memory, etc., never actually gets  
committed in normal use, but the operating system has to be able to  
fulfill the allocation requests, at least in theory. If you don't have  
enough real RAM, it could end up paging badly and performance would be  
awful, but in practice typical *TeX jobs use only a tiny fraction of  
these array sizes.

note that "pdftex -ini", using the same texmf.cnf, still uses less than 7MB
of resident memory, compared to 128 MB used by xetex.

i'd imagine it could be because of unicode initialization for
characters (lccode, uccode, etc). did things change in this area since
2007? i.e. is xetex now using more memory to store unicode character
properties than in 2007?

Look for the previous thread, which includes a tiny test script to
verify that trivial
perl/Tk stuff can run (or not).

On my sytems, macports p5-tk is broken.    I've been using the Apple
perl with Perl/Tk installed from CPAN.

I think this is normal when a package has been removed.
I saw similar messages on a couple systems testing the
new tlmgr.  Normally I use a local mirror site so they all
see a consistent archive.  I suspect the issue is that
the mirrors you tried were missing some packages.

The svnlog has:
 -----------
r10564 | karl | 2008-09-12 00:15:19 +0200 (Fri, 12 Sep 2008) | 1 line

rm answers, nonfree
[...]
r10555 | karl | 2008-09-11 20:24:11 +0200 (Thu, 11 Sep 2008) | 1 line

rm schedule, nonfree
  ---------------

so answers and schedule have been removed recently, but are likely
already installed on your system and might still be present on some
mirror sites.

Were you using pdf(la)tex with pdf figures, or (la)tex with EPS figures and
then dvips?

Last week I formatted an article (originally formated on Win32) using
OSX Intel ,TL2008 latex+dvips, and Adobe Distiller (CS3).   Distiller had
problems with many of the EPS figures, as did Apple's Preview.app (for
the non-Apple users, Preview is a pdf viewer, and uses an Apple
"distiller" to convert EPS to PDF).

The figures that caused problems were originally saved from Adobe
Illustrator CS2 on Win32.   I had to reload the .ai files and save again
with the degree symbol converted to outline path.    While there were
no Photoshop EPS files, many of the Illustrator files have embedded
Photoshop images, so may well share problems with Photoshop EPS.
There were also figures prepared using CMYK EPS on unix Matlab.  They
did not cause any problems.

I was quite surprised -- we have many EPS files created with AI and
PS dating back years that have never caused problems.

In addition to font problems, I suspect there may be problems with
the different newline conventions.  Some of the EPS files that gs
couldn't render were rendered with incorrect fonts after a "flip -u" to
convert from MS-DOS to unix newlines.

I'm pretty sure all this is not a TeX bug, but it is TeX that will
be blamed when there are problems.

George,

MacPorts' p5-tk is also broken in my machine. I ended up installing  
the Perl/Tk package bundled with MacTeX 2008, which works provided  
that I deactivate MacPorts' perl5.8 port (which I need as a dependency  
of other ports). This is a bit of a hassle, since I have to remember  
to activate perl5.8 after using tlmgr.

On an unrelated matter, I have also noticed that quotes are  
consistently mangled by tlmgr --gui (see, for instance, svn). Any fix  
for that in the works?

Thanks,

Artemio

Yes, that's true, this changed between the TL2007 and TL2008 versions  
-- there are a number of tables that used to support only the Basic  
Multilingual Plane of Unicode, but have now been extended to cover the  
full Unicode space of U+0000..10FFFF. I was forgetting that the TL2007  
version predated this.

We could reduce this RAM footprint if it's a problem, but at the cost  
of slightly more complex code; it doesn't seem to have been a problem  
for users, though, so I've generally left things in their simplest form.

no, it's fine, increasing ulimit solved the problem. i just wondered
if this increased memory footprint is normal, or is caused by some

For instance, in the svn package info instead of project's this is  
what you get:

project???\x{80}\x{99}

In attachfile, there are strange character like

???\x{80}\x{94}

etc.

Hope this helps,

This is the normal message when a package is deleted.  As George noted,
I deleted answers and schedule some time ago.

I will try to change the wording to be clearer.  What also puzzles me is
that it is now marked as a debug message in the source, so I don't

Message-ID: <577787C4-3796-43F2-93BA-1738B4785BD7@Freenet.DE>

Hello!

Extractbb can work verbosely (-v), which means it echos to stdout  
what it writes to the file. And it has two modes (besides a binary  
one) to record information:

	-m	Output .bb  file used in DVIPDFM
	-x	Output .xbb file used in DVIPDFMx (default)

The command 'extractbb -vm playground.jpg' provokes the message:

	Writing to ./playground.xbb: Bounding box: 0 0 85 40

According to the documentation a BB file should have been created.  
Using 'extractbb -vx playground.jpg' produces the correct message and  
the documented file format. 'extractbb -m playground.jpg' works as  
documented, and also 'extractbb -x playground.jpg'.

When using the ebb command, the created BB file has a line

	%%Creator: extractbb Version 0.2

instead of

	%%Creator: ebb Version ?


The documentation and also the source code mention a command 'bbx' or  
'xbb' which does not exist in /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/universal- 
darwin (from middle of August, Mac TeX test distribution). Is this on  
purpose?

In-Reply-To: <577787C4-3796-43F2-93BA-1738B4785BD7@Freenet.DE>
Message-ID: <200809132351.m8DNpCt30882@f7.net>

    The command 'extractbb -vm playground.jpg' provokes the message:

            Writing to ./playground.xbb: Bounding box: 0 0 85 40

    According to the documentation a BB file should have been created.  

Could you please report this to dvipdfmx at ktug.or.kr?

    When using the ebb command, the created BB file has a line
            %%Creator: extractbb Version 0.2
    instead of
            %%Creator: ebb Version ?

That seems desirable to me.  We made ebb be a symlink to dvipdfmx in
this release, as another step towards omitting the old dvipdfm
altogether.

    The documentation and also the source code mention a command 'bbx'
    or 'xbb' which does not exist in
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/universal- darwin (from middle of
    August, Mac TeX test distribution). Is this on purpose?

bbx and xbb were names for extractbb during development.  I asked ChoF
to change the name since (new) three-character command names should not
be used up for such rarely needed functionality, which he kindly did.
So it is a documentation bug.  Please report that too.

Thanks,
karl

For the sake of completeness, I am referring to the installation from
ISO image (source 20080816), the timestamps of tlmgr.pl (<- tlmgr)
being Aug 21 18:50, with size 51926, and daily updated as described.

(La)TeX finds xlop.sty, but it calls xlop.tex, which it can't find  
because it was put in the doc section:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/generic/xlop/xlop.tex

pdfLaTeX with the epstopdf package to convert the EPS figures to PDF.  
First I used the previously (2006) converted PDF files. Then, to do a  
complete test, I deleted the PDF figures to let epstopdf to convert  
again the EPS figures; that's when the problems surfaced.

I'm using still Adobe CS (that is, CS1). Adobe Distiller had no  
problems distilling the Photoshop EPS files, but GS and Apple  
distiller failed. GS and Apple distiller could distill the Illustrator  
EPS files as well as EPS figures done on Linux ---I don't know in  
which application(s).

In my case, the Photoshop EPS files had no fonts. Illustrator EPS had  
fonts, though, but there was no problem with them.

Unfortunately, that's true. pdf(La)TeX has nothing to do with this --- 
it was all a problem with Photoshop--GS-Apple distiller.

Last year Karl Berry promised to do this for the next (2008)  
distribution, mainly because font distributions like MinionPro chocked  
TeX (while gwTeX, with significantly more memory allocation, worked  
fine). I told him I had to modify texmf.cnf (mainly copying values  
from gwTeX's texmf.cnf) and then rebuild formats for MinionPro to work.


Best,

Axel

P.S. Later distributions of MinionPro reduced significantly the number  
of files, so maybe now even with lower memory that won't be a problem,  
but who knows...

Sorry, should have been clearer : "no physical

There are several options, depending on the nature of your internet
access and your needs:

1)  svn checkout or rsync to mirror the TL source repository.   You
can build new binaries and you can install using "tlmgr --location
<path_to_svn>.   I use rsync for my home system.
<http://www.tug.org/texlive/svn/> explains the options, but does not
give a full discussion
of the rsync options that can be used to omit binaries (e.g,, for
architectures you don't have).

2) ftp mirroring of the tldev/2008 directory.  I use this at work
(with wget), where rsync and svn are blocked. I think rsync is
supported by some CTAN mirror sites.   There are a number of tools
(lftp, curlmirror.pl) that support mirroring.  At work we have a
restrictive firewall and traffic shaping, and rely on wget for bulk
transfers -- given suitable settings it works well when there are
firewalls and shaping at both ends.

I can't say, as I remove them as soon as I learn they have been removed from TL.

emerge texlive

will install the whole system.  Maybe you didn't install it
completely.  If it is too big for you (> 1GB) then you can use the
attatched script in order to install a customized version.
Comment out every package you don't need and run the script.
I suppose that at least texlive-mathextra is not installed.

You can also run emerge -s texlive in order to get a list of texlive
packages but maybe the script is more convenient. 

Another alternative is to unmerge texlive and install TeX Live 2008.

      http://tug.org/texlive

It's also modular and customizable, you can install missing packages
later, update packages,...  And it's more up to date.

I don't believe this unless somebody shows me an installation where

There is a list of descriptions what tlmgr is and how to use it. If I
type tlmgr gui I get the following result on a Win Vista machine:
path> tlmgr gui
path> Undefined subroutine &main::debug called at
C:/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui/tlmgrgui-real.pl line 171.

I never tried to run the perl script directly, perhaps it is important
that I have installed ActiveState Perl 5.8 on the same machine. but all
in all this shouldn't matter as a part of programming or does it?

I moved the doc files for the dingbat package into doc/fonts (from
doc/latex).  The files in tex/latex really are latex files, at a quick
glance.  dingbat.tex is a "doc" file.

Actually not &MAKE* in this case, but %specialdocfmt.  Wish we were

What's in TL is what is on CTAN.  Maybe your particular pdf reader isn't
happy about it for some reason, or corrupted in download I suppose.  You
could wget it manually from CTAN or TL.

    yplan:
            - CTAN has newer version

Updated.

            - but newer version does include perl script so maybe that's why?

I didn't bother doing anything new and different with the Perl script in
this old and untouched package, just left it in its
.../doc/... location.

Karl,


I've just discovered that in change 9457 you've removed the
doc/latex/cjk/examples/pdf directory, without re-installing the PDF
versions...

With other words, you've installed cjk-4.8.1-tar.gz but you've
apparently forgotten to add cjk-4.8.1-doc.tar.gz (or rather, a
selection of it as documented in CJK's doc/TeXLive.txt file).

Unfortunately, I've missed this :-(

How shall we proceed?

Thanks for pointing that out!  My bad terminology is clearly an
expression of the confusion on my side.

A clear distinction has to be made between a source (a work) we refer to
while preparing our list and the /source code/ of a work.  As I
understand it now, since our list is a work in source code form and has
no corresponding source code other than itself, GPL doesn't put any
restriction on distribution of the word list as a standalone work.
Distribution can be restricted by the license of the original list, but
since that's not the case all is fine.

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Subject: [tex-live] Footmisc and setspace problem
Message-ID: <393097.68956.qm@web110416.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I noticed that footmisc and setspace packages don't work very well together in texlive 2008 although in the manual of footmisc it is stated that if setspace is put before footmisc in the preamble everything should be fine. Still, footnotes retain default spacing no matter of \setstretch given. A bug? Does anyone other have same problem?

Here's a test code:

----------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{book}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

\usepackage{setspace}
\setstretch{2}

\usepackage{footmisc}

\usepackage{lipsum}

\begin{document}
Test\footnote{\lipsum[1]} and more\footnote{\lipsum[2]}
\lipsum[1-3]
\end{document}

That has nothing to do with footmisc and it is intended. setspace tries
hard to switch of double spacing at some places

[note that my address is prominently quoted in the source, with a note
that i continue to support the package.  did mail to my address fail?]

it is not a bug, it's a design feature.

given the much smaller size of footnote text, the same stretch as that
used in the main text is unlikely to be useful.

however, if you _really_ want the effect, set it up by

  \renewcommand\footnotelayout{\onehalfspacing}

or whatever.

double spacing is designed to allow space between lines of typewriter
output to write comments.  (i never used to find it possible...)  this
is plainly a ridiculous idea with footnotes, but if needs must...

The symlinks were indeed present in the marvosym.doc.tar.lzma archive.
They were apparently left over from an old build, and for some reason it
did not get updated when we remade the package without symlinks.  It was
around the time we were creating the whole tlnet archive for the first
time, so I'm not going to try to poke further.  

I updated marvosym so the symlinks should be gone after the next build.

Thanks,

I tried two different viewers. I also tried a copy of the file that
somebody was kind enough to email to me but which was identical to the
original (according to diff).

I solved it by generating a pdf version myself but I'm curious about
the problem. If somebody could send me an md5 sum, I'd be grateful.

The funny thing is that
1) AR7 and AR9 (I don't have 8 installed) show blue "blob"
2) xpdf show blue "blob" while
3) ApplePreview, Texshop and Skim which are based on the different
engine show empty square. Meanwhile opening fancytipmark.eps with
ApplePreview (which converts it to pdf) also shows blue blob.

However if we generate pdf using fancytooltips ALL above applications
show blue blob perfectly. Probably pdf experts can explain this
phenomena but there is no harm that some special input file is not
properly displayed by some browsers (probably bug in Apple engine)

Let us also remember that fancytooltips are Javascript based and one
needs AR (or AA) to properly display resulting pdf

answers is no longer in tex live because my continuing work on the
catalogue turned up evidence that it is actually not sellable -- a
definite no-no for tex live that has in the past been included in
commercial products.

you can see this information at

or other merry catalogue presentation code elsewhere on the net.

That are different things. 
The tlmgr GUI is a separate program, a frontend for tlmgr.

The install-tl GUI is integrated into the script itself.

So the former starts tlmgr(.pl) and expects it to do the work, capturing
the stdout (and stderr) and that is all.


That is, btw, a nice project for a perl apprentice to merge these two
scripts!!! It is on my todo list for quite some time already ...

Best wishes

Subject: [tex-live] CJK doc files missing
In-Reply-To: <20080915.103628.21121027.wl@gnu.org>
Message-ID: <200809161826.m8GIQXT04947@f7.net>

    With other words, you've installed cjk-4.8.1-tar.gz but you've
    apparently forgotten to add cjk-4.8.1-doc.tar.gz 

Please tell me what files you want from the doc archive installed, and I
will install them.  Just examples/pdf or are there others?  Users who
want them will then be able to get them with "tlmgr update cjk".

    (or rather, a
    selection of it as documented in CJK's doc/TeXLive.txt file).

Sorry, I don't understand how I can use that file.  It seemed to be
describing the old installation Sebastian made by hand, rather than
prescribing how it should/must be installed in the future.  (For
instance, TL has no concept of "bundle", only "package", and in TL'08
the package name is "cjk" not "CJK".)

Below is the code I actually wrote to install CJK.  It is quite painful
and error-prone (and partially unpacking the doc tarball won't help,
sigh), but it is still better than doing it by hand.  Anything you could
do to simplify it, by changing the original, would be welcome.

Message-ID: <20080916183419.GA12433@irwin.vpn.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

when using texdoc with a file name including the file extension, e.g.
  texdoc fancyhdr.pdf
then texdoc reports:
  texdoc info: No exact match, trying full search mode.
But it finds and calls the *exact* match `fancyhdr.pdf'
(in directory `texmf-dist/doc/latex/fancyhdr/').

Yours sincerely

Hi Victor,

    if before
    update --all  % updated and installed new
    Now it only updates but not installs new

Sorry, can't reproduce.  It installs new packages for me.  Specifically:

I ran 
install-tl --location ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/TeX/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
(an out-of-date mirror), chose scheme-minimal,
installed to a temp dir,
put the new dir's bin in my PATH.

Then I copied the current tlmgr.pl from the TL source repo into the tree.

Then I ran tlmgr install collection-genericextra (still from the old funet).

Then I ran tlmgr option location /home/ftp/texlive/tlnet/2008
(switching to a local up-to-date copy of the network repo).

Then I ran tlmgr update --all
and it installed the new xlop package (among other expected updates).


If new packages are not being installed for you, please provide
equivalent details :).

Thanks,
Karl

Indeed this is not normal. I remember I tried to do something "clever"
with extensions but changed it in a hurry when I realised two days
before the freeze that my code could not be clever enough to guess that
in "flshort-3.20" (unfortunate name btw) the .20 was not at all an
extension.

I'll look into it and keep you posted.

Thanks for the report,
Manuel.

it's entirely possible that the licence _is_ unknown, by the standards
of when the database entry was written.  we now have a new category,
viz., "noinfo" -- a package whose author doesn't say what conditions
should be applied to its distribution.

if you can point to something by hobby that says unequivocally something
that allows me to deduce some licence condition (even "pd"), i'll change
it.  otherwise, when i get around to it (i've several hundred other
"unknown" licences to process), i'll convert its catalogued licence to
"noinfo".

Hi guys,

I have seen errors like this:

texdoc warning: Environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_pdf deprecated. See the manual
        section ?.?, ?.? for details.

The question marks are hard coded. May I suggest a better error?

Perhaps "See `texdoc texdoc`", but then that may not work if no viewer
is on the system.

Does anyone have any ideas?

In my case, it was enough to comment out those lines (TEXDOCVIEW_xxx)  
from my .bash_profile. Now PDFs, etc., open with the system defaults  
apps.

Certainly, but people are going to want to use different viewers :)

Hello,

I also noticed that verbatimcopy package
(http://ctan.org/pkg/verbatimcopy) is missing in TeXLive 2008. Is it
possible to make it available by download?

Thanks.

Sure you may :-) Actually, this was on my todo-list, and for some very
weird reason it disappeared from the todo-list without the job getting
done. I'll just suppress the warnings since they can be annoying for
people using many version of texdoc at the same time.

Done. Unfortunately, the author didn't provide the source of the
documentation, so I had to remove it from TL...

Should be in tomorrow's updates, or the day after, depending on mirror
sync, as usual.

Yes, there will be official updates and they will be fetched via tlmgr
itself. Please refrain from using svn if you are not willing to do
testing. We cannot guarantee anything, and even less that the svn
version is working.

the problem is quite simple: You uploaded the documentation without
source. CTAN will just take what you upload. And TeX Live (we) take what
is on CTAN and what we can take, ie, if source is present.

If you re-upload to CTAN together with the source we will include the
documentation.

But we cannot contact (or better, it is a sisyphus job, and sometimes we
try to time permitted) all the authors of docs where sources are
missing.

So please, reupload with the doc source and the doc will also be
included.

So to repeat, maybe for others: That is not our job! If you want
anything included in TeX Live, please provide sources, or it will not be
included. CTAN is your friend.

Best wishes

Norbert

Because contacting authors is generally very time-consuming and doesn't
always give results, so in general I first upload what I can into TL,
and only later contact the author to see if we can do more. So, I
planned to contact you, but later.

Anyway, I'm happy you saw the thread, answered quickly, and are willing
to upload the source. As Norbert says, the way to go is to upload them
to CTAN, we will pull them automatically from there.

Manuel.

that is fine. but this pacakge is from before the 'no source for 
documentation' no TL rule was inforced, so a notice to the package 
author might still be in order.

(I'm not a big fan of some of these debian rules)

Hi,

TL 2008 has a problem with gmutils conflicting with \nocite.

I contacted the author, and now the version of gmutils from CTAN seems
to fix this.

The bug can be reproduced at my end by importing gmverb after natbib
then issuing \notcite{*}.

That rule always existed! (Well at least since 2004/5 when I started
being involved, but I am 99% sure that it was there even before)

Subject: [tex-live] mirroring the texlive archive/ selectively
Message-ID: <873ajzwhwb.fsf@violet.siamics.int>

	How do I mirror the TeXLive distribution selectively?  E. g.,
	I'm not interested in platforms other than GNU/Linux on AMD64
	and W32, and there also may be some packages which are of no
	value to me, nor for the users this mirror is intended for.

	It seems that texlive.tlpdb contains all the necessary
	information to perform such a selective download, but is there a
	tool to utilize it?

	The ability to check the mirror against MD5 sums and to rebuild
	the .tlpdb according to the selection being mirrored would also
	be nice.

	For now, I'm using something like:

#!/bin/bash
archive=http://mirror.macomnet.net/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/
## mirror arch-independent packages
wget -b -r -l2 "$archive" --no-parent \
    --accept=index.html \
    --reject=\*.{alpha,amd64,doc,hppa,i386,mips,powerpc,sparc,universal,win32,x86,source}\* \
    --accept=\*.tar.lzma 
    "$archive"
## mirror the binary packages
wget -b -r -l2 "$archive" --no-parent \
    --accept=index.html \
    --accept=\*.{x86_64-linux,win32}.tar.lzma \
    "$archive"
## at last, mirror the doc packages
wget -b -r -l2 "$archive" --no-parent \
    --accept=index.html \
    --accept=\*.doc.tar.lzma \
    "$archive"

	TIA.

I would never have noticed if I didn't just see the word verbatimcopy in 
my maillog (I'm not a regular reader og the texlive list)

So now there will be a lot missing from TL just because of this?

I think it is an anoying rule. I have a book about LaTeX that I'd like 
to upload to CTAN but it is released without sources, so that will never 
make it to TL, but miktex users will get it....

I do not use mirrors, I do not need to keep such files permanently, I
use squid with huge cache instead. I install several computers, the
first fill the squid cache and the next computers install from the
cache.

Our choice is clear: free software, free documentation, the rule is
clear. And rules are always annoying to someone (particularly to people
working to enforce this rule and make most people happy, believe me).

I don't know how Christian proceeds, but he claims on miktex's web page
that it consists only of free software too.

Manuel.

PS: Just to be clear, I'm not a fanatic of free software (just an

well, you have the same problem with the missing context manuals, as far 
as I remember they are creative commons, and thus not in TL, as creative 
commons is not a debian free license (I think that was the argument, 
might be mistaken).

(don't know if the situation has changed, I've never used context)

A pdf-file is not "non-free" only because there is no accompagnying
tex-file. But TeXLive not only wants free software but open source
software. 

This leads in the case of documentation to some curious sources. E.g.
csquotes.tex contains the following text:

% This is the source of csquotes.pdf. This file is primarily included
% in the distribution for legal reasons. It will not compile as is
% because it depends on unpublished classes and packages.

I sometimes wonder how minimal a source can be and still count as a
source in the legal sense.

the texlive version of gmutils we mirror into ctan has the latest
gmutils.

so all you need do is update your installation.

Karl stated that several times. If both the pdf and the tex code is
there, but the tex code depends for example on some commercial fonts, it
can still be included if the tex code is sufficiently clear.

I mean: I you just switch to FOnt Foobar and type your text, then that
is fine. If you create a commercial font with text lines (whole text
lines) as single glyphs, and then print your book as
	\char".. \char"..
etc then that is not fine.

Good example: fontinstallationguide, where we ship the .pdf, and the tex
code, but you cannot generate the pdf from the tex code, but all the
text, examples etc are there.

This is the freedom we take for ourselves and here we disagree with
Debian (they would never include the resepecitve pdf). So see it as an
improvement.

Best wishes

Not completely right. The context manuals are cc with the nosell clause.
So including them would make DVD distribution/selling problematic.

Do you want that? We not. 

And now please let us finish this discussion, the rules are stated and
repeated, and it is up to the authors to decide what they want.

Still, there is CTAN, people can get whatever they miss from there.

actually, we don't hold context documentation.  i think i asked about it
some time back, but they declined.  i'm never entirely sure about
context ... it seems a good thing, but its changes flash past like
quicksilver.  (also, of course, they have their own tex engine -- texlua
-- that i've not managed to catch up with.)

	In my case, the archive that was mirrored by Wget is then copied
	(using rsync) to an external (SATA, USB) hard disk, which I then
	carry physically to connect to the host serving as an HTTP
	server for the LAN, over which TeXLive is to be installed.

	Also, the exact point of time when the installation is performed

	between installations may be up to several weeks, I guess.
	Presumably, the cached content will by expired by the time.

pursuing something else, i noticed a remark on the contextgarden page
that they're updating the documentation.  they give a link to the
repository for the work, and i've had a look at it.

behold, it's now under the gnu fdl.  (seems like good news to me,
anyway.)

ah, that explains it a bit better

might confuse a lot of people that there is no manuals, but that is the

The file had been created by Inkscape 0.44.1.  It's not compressed, so
someone with more PDF experience (Heiko, Martin...) could check
whether there is something unusual (not worth the effort if Inkscape
0.44.1 is ancient).  However, I don't have much knowledge about PDF,
I just wrote some PostScript code in the past (PDF and PS are using
the same imaging model), and I absolutely don't have the impression
that the file is broken.  I don't see anything unusual.

The file is even *much* simpler than the example described in the
pdftex manual.  Don't know why it can't be displayed everywhere.

BTW, curiously, old versions of CorelDraw (in the nineties) suffered
from rounding errors.  The rounding errors had been visible even by
people who are less finicking than TeX users.  Inkscape seems to be
much more precise then necessary.

As far as I can judge, Inkscape produces nice output which can be
debugged easily.

No, the file is a valid PDF file, nothing unusual.
(Of course there is a little place for optimizations:
* /ProcSet -> [/PDF]
* object 7 is not needed, the length could directly be used
  in object 6.
* some page stream operators could be optimized:
  one cm operation at the begin, one color setting, no save/restore
  pairs, ...
* Some whitspace can be removed.
But all that doesn't hurt validity.

Since problems are only with pdf viewers having the same Apple engine
Steve Jobs should take responsibility :-)

very odd, actually: the only file i can find that contains that version
string is the list of changes (where it says what version it is).

anyway, i've changed the repository.

they're on ctan, and they're non-free in the debian sense.  you can copy
them from ctan, but you (typically) can't sell them so they can't be on
tex live.

Saying "creative commons" by itself is meaningless, because the CC
organization publishes many licenses, which are very different -- some
free, some non-free.  It is an unfortunate and confusing situation.

Search for "creative commons" on

When I say "free software", I mean free as in freedom, not free as in

Message-ID: <200809172358.m8HNwda08363@f7.net>

            It seems that texlive.tlpdb contains all the necessary
            information to perform such a selective download, but is there a
            tool to utilize it?

We have never written a mirroring tool that reads tlpdb, since it never
came up for us.  I think it would be hard to write something that would
be of wide use, since everyone has different needs.  E.g., Phil posted
his mirroring scripts for Windows a couple weeks ago.  Naturally that is
different from yours ...

	For now, I'm using something like:

Looks reasonable to me.  I suspect rsync would be faster than wget.

	The ability to check the mirror against MD5 sums 

We don't bother with checksums.  If the .tar.lzma's can be unpacked,
then they are self-evidently correct.  If not, then not.

	and to rebuild the .tlpdb according to the selection being
	mirrored would also be nice.

That's two different operations.  Our principle is that you have a
"location" of the TL archive.  Then you install/update the actual TeX
installation from that "location", using tlmgr.  And that is what
rebuilds tlpdb.

After all, you might want to install from other places on occasion.

Thanks for writing,

Message-ID: <200809180054.m8I0sgF03138@f7.net>

    what is the best way to update tlmgr? 

At the moment, we are thinking "tlmgr update bin-texlive".
But it won't do anything yet.

    Will there be official releases  

Yes.

    or should one grab the latest version from svn? 

If you want to test, as Norbert, said.

    Also: which repository lies tlmgr in? 

There is only one source repository for TL.  tug.org/texlive/svn gives
details.

    Could not find anything about it on the websites.

I've intentionally not written anything very specific about it until we
are actually ready to do it, since the exact procedure and expected
outcome won't be clear.

We'll mention it on this list (at least) when we update the
infrastructure packages.

Best,

not all ctan mirrors do.  the main ctan sites offer rsync (we are
changing over to use it between the ctan nodes), but (short of actually
trying) i wouldn't know how to check whether a particular mirror does.
(it will no doubt be in the mirror database, but i seldom deal with
that.)

interesting idea.

doesn't exist just now -- it would depend on a more comprehensive set of
.tds.zip files on the existing ctan install/ tree

	Indeed.  It might make a sense to introduce per-protocol domain
	names, like http.mirror.ctan.org, rsync.mirror.ctan.org, etc.

	For now, I've chosen a single mirror that does.

I am working on a multi-source support, so that you can have multiple
installation sources. With that one could set up an archive which only
ships non-free stuff (or anything else). But first it will take quite
some time till I have that finished, second someone has to do the work
in setting up the server. The scripts are there for managing all that,
and for test cases I have done a script for context, but nothing is
there finished and polished, and the patch to the infra structure and
the tlgmr will not make it into distribution for quite some time, more
pressing needs there now.

Best wishes

That is already fixed and next packages should drop into your system

Thank you very much!

Thank goodness I've managed to stay away from the QuarkXPress and  
InDesign world! It takes them a couple of years to fix bugs (and  
introduce new ones).

My very best wishes for your trip to Georgia. You certainly deserve a  
good vacation (I know it won't be a vacation, but at least a ?change

Actually this error could be easily patch by plain removing offending
line (I am not saying that it will not introduce another bug but at
least it works)

but it's since been restored, again per author's request.  (and neither
implies nor denies xecjk, which i presume is an xetex package of some
sort.)

the fact is, ctan doesn't want to deal with packages that the author
doesn't want us to deal with.  to a large extent, tex live doesn't
distribute things that aren't on ctan (xetex itself is an exception -- i
don't know why).  unless the author of xecjk does something unusual
(e.g., joining the tex live team and building distribution packages for
him/herself), xecjk is unlikely to make it to tex live.

Strange.  I only see this:

but I don't see a message that the xeCJK package has been removed.

as i said, wen-chang didn't want the package on ctan.

on 2008-07-21, we received the following:

  A submission was uploaded to tug.ctan.org.

  The following information was provided by our fellow contributor:

  Name of contribution: xeCJK package
  Author's name: Wenchang Sun
  Author's email: xecjk at yahoo.cn
  Location on CTAN: /macros/xetex/latex/xecjk
  Summary description: Typesetting Chinese/Japanese/Korean in XeLaTeX
  License type: lppl

  Announcement text:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I hope to withdraw the xeCJK package since the present version is not
  stable. The package will be emerged to another package. 

  (I do not know if you have received my confirm email. So I use this
  method to send it ) 

  Dear Jim,

  Yes, I want to delete the package. Thank you very much!
  I apologize for the inconvinience to you.

Regarding getnonfreefonts, I discussed it briefly with Karl.
Theoretically getnonfreefonts could also provide nonfree macro
packages.  But we both assumed that this will probably encourage
people not to provide a resonable license.

Now we have tlmgr and maybe it can install packages which do not
comply with the Debian/TeX Live rules.  There are obviously different
definitions for the word "free".  If someone uploads a PDF file to
CTAN and the license sais that it can freely be used and distributed,
then it's free.  It can be downloaded from CTAN, and it can shipped
with MikTeX too, even if no sources are provided.  

Insisting on the sources which created the PDF file is a Debian/TeX
Live issue.  It's fine that Christian distributes them.  His users are
very grateful and he doesn't violate any license.

Rolf, please apologize that I cite your question again, but it is
quite strange.
 
 > Will be exist non-free TeXLive packages for download from CTAN in the
 > future (similar to "getnonfreefonts")?

You obviously have getnonfreefonts in mind and propose that tlmgr
could do something similar.  But getnonfreefonts follows TeX Live
guidelines and its only purpose is to provide fonts which come with
the unfortunate "nosell" license.  They can't be put on a DVD which
issupposed to be sold.

No, tlmgr can't solve the problem regarding missing source files.
It's TeX Live policy not to distribute such files.  If the files are
not good enough for the  DVD, they are definitely not good
enough for tlmgr either. 

If people can download the files using tlmgr, why can't them be
shipped with the DVD?  Quite bizarre.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Because someone created an archive at a different place and someone
called
	tlmgr -location http://that.different.location/ install all-the-nonfree-stuff
and that does already work...

You only have to set up the archive, but that is in fact only a thing of
reading the scripts in the subversion repository, better using, not
reading.

So, as I have written already, yes it is possible. Not that WE (= TeX
Live Team) will do it. But possible it is.

Best wishes

    xetex itself is an exception -- i don't know why

We certainly encourage programs to put their releases on CTAN.  And I
bet we could set up a mirror of official XeTeX releases to CTAN using
our usual roundabout methods or others, if you and Jonathan wish.

But as a practical matter, having sources for the basic programs on CTAN
does not really help us, since we have no infrastructure to update
sources (ie, under Build/source/) from CTAN.  And it would be a great
deal of effort to create such infrastructure, with only dubious
benefit.  Very often the sources have to be changed within TL, or TL is
where they actually get tested (viz. pdftex ...).

The situation with packages (anything but compiled programs) is entirely
different.  There, we most definitely want everything on CTAN.

As neither a couple of sites I tried (unam.mx, utah.edu) showed the

Since xetex was integrated into TL, I haven't been doing separate  
"official releases".... there is of course evolving development code  
that some people build and use, but I didn't package and release  
anything formally between TL2007 and TL2008.

I suppose my feeling has been that xetex doesn't really make much  
sense outside the context of a larger TeX distribution such as TL,  
MikTeX, W32TeX, etc. And it shares a good deal of source code and  
build infrastructure with the rest of TL, so creating a separate  
"standalone" xetex package would be awkward and a maintenance headache.

I do maintain a separate source repository, containing a cut-down  
version of the TL source tree, so it's possible to build xetex  
binaries separately from getting the complete TL source tree and  
building everything. Other distributions also draw from this  
repository. But I'm not sure how much anyone would really benefit from  
tarring it up and sending to CTAN. Bear in mind that CTAN does hold a  
complete copy of the xetex source as part of the TL source tree, after  
all, so it's not actually missing; it just isn't cleanly separated out.

If I do decide to make a formal release that doesn't coincide with a  
TeX Live release, I'd have nothing against submitting that to CTAN as  
well -- except that it then becomes something else to remember and  
deal with in future, when the next TL release supersedes it!

Hi Werner,

    have a look into fonts/map/dvips/tengwarscript/tengwarscript.map; it
    refers only to TTFs (except a single PFB).  This can't be correct, right?

1) pdftex can directly use ttfs.

2) TL just copies what the author supplies, the bug needs to go back to
   him/her/them.

Thanks,

            Could you please give a link to that posting in an archive?
            (Message-Id: would be more than enough.)

Sorry, I don't have Message-Id's memorized :).  You can search the
archives as well as I can.  Anyway, I think you are already well beyond
the point where you need it.

	However, I see that I can test the integrity with $ lzma -t.  I
	hope that LZMA checksums are good enough for the purpose.

Not sure.  But in any case, as Norbert corrected me, there are md5's in
the .tlpobj files.
	
	Isn't it the installation .tlpdb that gets rebuilt?  

Yes.

	The idea is to rebuild the one that's on the mirror:
        http://ctan.example.org/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

Ah, I was not understanding.

	Note that the intent is to have a partial mirror.  
	How would, e. g., install-tl behave should some of the files
	mentioned in .tlpdb (and queried for the installation) be
	unavailable from the mirror?

If install-tl (or tlmgr) tries to download package x, and x is not
available on the mirror, it aborts, last I checked.  Maybe there could
be a --keep-going option.  Patches welcome.

Maybe if you refrain from ever asking for the package it would work.
I mean, if your partial mirror matches the collections which you have
installed, then the extra entries in the mirror's tlpdb probably
wouldn't hurt?  Not sure, never tried it.

But in general, arbitrarily slicing and dicing in new ways won't work
with the existing tools.

Let me explain it a little bit further. During the preparation of
the Chinese translation of TeX Live 2008 Guide, we found it will
be really helpful if xeCJK can be integrated into TL. So we
contacted Sun Wenchang to ask him to put this package on CTAN. But
after a while he decided to withdraw this package because a few
bugs were found after it's included in TL2008. Wenchang thought
it's irresponsible to put such a buggy package with TL at that
time (TL2008 was going to be released). We explained the new TL
release infrastructure to him but he insisted on keeping that
project separate.

So at present, CTeX forum [1] is probably the only place you can
retrieve this package. We will ask Wenchang to reconsider about
putting xeCJK on CTAN after it's more stable. (To me, xeCJK is
already quite stable and I used that on day to day basis, however
Wenchang apparently set a high bar on the package he releases.)

The newest version of xeCJK is 2.2.8 (13-Sept-2008). You may get it 
from the SUN Wenchang's homepage: 
http://math.nankai.edu.cn/~sunwch/patches4tex.zip
But it is packaged together with cjkpunct, ttfshape, etc.

Right. If you don't ask for it, then neither install-tl nor tlmgr will
boil out. So if you just sync parts of the stuff you can sync the full
texlive.tlpdb, but then don't select those binaries you haven't synced.

I mean "free" as free to handle the pdf. To copy it, to put it on CD, to
offer it for download and -- for users -- to view, to print and also
(there could be cases where this is not possible) to search and copy
text of the pdf.

With "open source" I only meant that TL wants the source of the pdf what
probably means the knowledge how the pdf was created and the means to
recreate it locally.

(But I don't know to which extend sources are needed as nowadays a lot
of documentations includes external objects like graphics. Are the
source of such external objects required too? E.g. if I make a diagram
with a spreadsheet program and a graphic with say tiks or pstricks in
another document and then include this diagram and the graphic in my
document and perhaps also attach a pdf to my documentation, is then the
spreadsheet, the code of the graphic and the code of the attached pdf a
required part of the source? As far as can see this is not the case,
graphics and diagrams are taken as is. But if major parts of my document
would consist of imported graphics or of attached pdf's without sources
this would probably count as cheating.)

As far as I understood Norbert he is aware of this:

"Good example: fontinstallationguide, where we ship the .pdf, and the
tex code, but you cannot generate the pdf from the tex code, but all
the text, examples etc are there.

This is the freedom we take for ourselves and here we disagree with
Debian (they would never include the resepecitve pdf). So see it as an
improvement."

I really hope that my remark doesn't lead to the removal of the doc of
csquotes from texlive ;-(.


For similar reasons as the author of csquotes I can't put sources that
compile on CTAN, my documentations use unpublished packages, personal
settings and lokal fonts. And unlike the author of csquotes I don't want
to put a source that don't compile on CTAN, partly because the sources
contain a lot of personal comments and I would have to postprocess it,
partly because I do find it a bit silly to do it "only for legal
reasons".  

I hope that you don't misunderstand me. My remarks are not meant as
complains or even as a request to change the TeXLive policy: It is
absolutelty your choice what you include and what not. I did give my
packages "for free" and for me this also include the right to distribue
only parts of the files or even to ignore it completely. 

Btw: In the case of minitoc it is miktex which doesn't package the doc
since users complained about the size (the pdf is 27 MB large and
together with the sources the package grow up to 65MB).

Let's put it this way, we don't have a formal definition. Generally all
the graphics etc should be present. All the cases we currently have is
the usage of commercial fonts. Everything else should be there.

I am well aware of that and do regret that personally, but it is your

That is fine. We had this discussion about all the chess* related
packges. We have all of them included, (only?) the documentation is
missing. We respect your decision, too ;-)

Finally it has appeared!... But not texdoc.tlu 10628, the one I've  
manually installed in one of my machines, but already 10633 (which is  
working fine, by the way).

Curiously ---for me, that is---, in the manually upgraded machine  
tlmgr didn't recognize the 10628 it already had, but reports local as  
10620 still.

I guess a manual upgrade doesn't update the database ---obviously.


Thank you.

Now I remember why I didn't add the doc source. It uses personal 
packages, that was not (and is not) publicly available.

Will use some other construction

I see... Nearly 100,000 lines of that database! Amazing job the TeX

i reckon a document that needs a non-public text font is still usable
(with care) by those who don't have that font.  however, a document that
needs an image is unlikely to be satisfactory without it.

i'm a little uneasy about this.  as i said, i'm not worried about the
fonts issue (unless you're using, say, an exotic symbol font, without
which the document text is actually meaningless).  what are these local
settings (?packages) that can't be included in the preamble of a
document?

of course texlive gets around this by having separate distributions:
64mbyte .tar.lzma doc (which includes all the documentation related images, of
course), 390kb of source, and 54kb of run files.

minitoc's documentation is outright mad.  i wish we could invent a
mechanism to bring this home to jean-pierre -- he's got to the point
where he doesn't want to upload to ctan (it takes _so_ long) and would
we download his new version, please?

the distribution contains 789 files.  trimming the excesses of the
documentation (all the maps, flags, generated files, etc.) reduces that
to 29!  that set is big enough, in all conscience (because the .dtx
itself is so huge), and of course we don't know what the doc would look
like in the absence of all the linguistic mapping information.

sigh.  should stop ranting and work on diplomacy...

Now that there is a package manager, it becomes possible to consider
adding support for multiple repositories, so you could have test packages,
nonfree packages, or even local (site-specific, for things like a thesis format
and letterhead).

The question of what is "free" gets complicated.  The variety of
restrictions is
unbounded, and it takes a lot of work to ensure that stuff is a) properly
classified, and b) that users understand what they can and can't do.

Organizations that rely on TeX often have macros that aren't appropriate for
CTAN, e.g., LaTeX classes specific to a report series that contain logos, fonts,
and design elements ("look and feel") that should not used externally -- I could
give you the macros, but then I'd have to kill you -- to guard against someone
creating bogus "official looking" government reports giving the inventory of
nuclear weapons in Switzerland and Belize.   Having such material in a local
site package repository has advantages 1) it is easier to manage installations,
and 2) potentially making it easier for users to tell what is free and
what is not.

While it seems simple to just set a policy for what should be in TeX
Live, no one
policy will make more than a few people completely happy.  It helps a
lot to have
a limited set of licenses (GPL, LPPL, etc), but authors need to
realize 1) even if they
aren't completely happy with a particular license, it is a kindness to packagers
and users if they adopt a standard license despite those reservations, and 2)
the world is stuck with the choices they make long after they are gone.

Item 1) above can be restated: If you don't make things easy for people
organizing distributions, your package risks languishing near the bottom of
the pile of things to do sometime in the future.   Adding support for
more license
categories just means that more things get packaged so end up on users' lists
of things to do later.

No, it need not be that bad. I have developed a class file and a set
of packages for one journal (it is not yet ready for distribution).
The purpose is to make life for editors easier. The editors will use
XeLaTeX with fonts from AdobeAcrobat. If the fonts are not found, the
class will use Latin Modern instead so that the article in the final
form will be visually different which is acceptable. Anyway the
editors have the right to make even modifications in the text (after
discussion with the authors). The package even works in a great many
cases with normal LaTeX. The first page of each article contains a
logo and the editors do not like to distribute it. Soution is simple:
if you start the article with \documentclass{pbml}, the macros will
just put a rectangle of the size of the logo with the text LOGO to the
first page. The editors will then change the first line to
\documentclass[logo]{pbml} and the macros will put the real logo
there. Thus if you have DejaVu + Acrobat Reader, you can generate
exactlyu the same layout but without the logo. Such a package can be
released under LPPL without no risk.

That wasn't what I meant. Certainly the graphic (the png or pdf or eps
or mps-file) itself should be in the sources of the documentation. But
what is with the source of the graphic?

They could all be included in the theory in the preamble, no problem
there. But this would mean (like cleaning the sources) that I would have
to postprocess the documentation and it would take me some time to
figure out how to do it in a reliable way. I simply don't write my
tex-files and private packages in a way that is suitable for the public.
They always contain comments, remainders and bits of code. I will
perhaps sometime in the future try to set up something that gives a
sensible cleaned source, but currently I have other things on my mind.

Yes, on the miktex list somebody also suggested to split the package. In
my opinion it would be even senseful to split the documentation in "doc"
and "source of doc".

(And even better it would be if all the content not related directly to
minitoc would go in an other document).

Discussing acrotex in mactex mailing list few people assured me that
Acrotex Educational Bundle (aka aeb) in contrast to other packages
using it (aeb_pro, acroflex etc) does not require Adobe Acrobat (and
Distiller may be used but could be replaced by pdftex). So may be it
is worth reconsidering its non-inclusion of aeb into TeXLive (leaving
other packages   of D.Story on the cold)

IMO the free licenses say that the sources must be available from the
same source but do not say that all users must install them. Thus
option "do not install sources" may be generally useful. It is
sufficient if the user knows how to obtain the sources if he or she
wants them.

Subject: [tex-live] Post-install problems (Solaris)
Message-ID: <200809191215.m8JCFxT25304@cressida.cert.fr>

Hello,

I have two problems with TL 2008 post-installation procedures:
 - texconfig-sys fails, due to missing whiptail binary; whiptail
 seems widely available on Linux, but I couldn't find sources
 to install it on Solaris; I used the batch syntax to configure;
 - to add local fonts xxx imported in texmf-local, I used to add Map xxx.map
 in updmap.cfg file. Now TL recommends to put all locally added fonts in 
 /some/file.cfg and to run command
 tlmgr generate updmap -local /some/file.cfg
 All I get is that -local is not a valid option.
 tlgr --help is almost unreadable on Solaris.
 
Any clue ?

TIA

the problem with minitoc is that the documentation is such as to
discourage *anyone* from even reading it, let alone acquiring it.

imo, a moderately complicated package (such as minitoc), without access
to the docs, is pretty much useless.  sure, the experienced user should
be allowed to ignore the docs, but that's not a useful long-term
strategy for any system.

the only *useful* thing to do with minitoc is to persuade jean-pierre to
rationalise its docs.  i'm still inclined to think the package itself is
bloated, but i'm not enough of an expert in multilanguage tex to be
sure.

we on the ctan team need to work on this.  (the last three times he's
produced a new version, we've thrown up our hands and said "something
ought to be done about this" ... but none of us can (usually) afford the
time to work on it.)

Strange, the texconfig I see here does NOT use whiptail in any way, I
grepped for it in texconfig itself and texmf/texconfig/*.

Can you send us the output of a failed run,please.

WHy is it unreadable? That is a pod2man thing of normal perl. Does
solaris not have a decent perl? (Guess I have to ask my personal friend
J??rg Schilling ;-)))

There is also
	texmf/doc/man/man1/tlmgr.pdf
	texmf/doc/man/man1/tlmgr.1
which you can read.

Short explanation: Either USE
	updmap(-sys) --enable Map xxx.map
so that it will be enabled, or add it to
	TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
and call
	tlmgr generate updmap

> Any clue ?

About the tlmgr yes, about man not working no, about whiptail no.

Best wishes

I didn't encounter these problems on Solaris 10, which I access
on our LAN using a system with a X11 server (Xming on Win32,
or linux, or MacOSX).   For some other project I had to install
a whack of Perl stuff, so there may well be some differences
between my installation and standard Solaris.

If  TeX was on the system previously, check for
environment variables that might conflict with things in
texmf.cnf, as well as for old texmf.cnf files, etc.

A solution for the above problem under windows vista is to comment out
the line 171 by a # in the tlmgrgui-real.pl file.
If anybody has a better solution let us know.

Hi Victor,

    Acrotex Educational Bundle (aka aeb) in contrast to other packages
    using it (aeb_pro, acroflex etc) does not require Adobe Acrobat

Thanks for the info.

    is worth reconsidering its non-inclusion of aeb into TeXLive

I see no "aeb" in the Catalogue, or any aeb/ directory on CTAN.
Where exactly is "aeb"?

on CTAN there is acrotex (in usual
macros/latex/contrib/acrotex ) and the directory contains acrotex_pack.zip
which is "trimmed" directory)


On his website

http://www.acrotex.net/aeb_index.php?lang=en

page
http://www.acrotex.net/aeb_index.php?page=aebpackages

describes some packages,

page

 http://www.acrotex.net/aeb_index.php?page=downloads


gives downloads but only AeB does not require (according to what is
written) Acrobat or Distiller
while other bundles do

ctan:
macros/latex/contrib/acrotex (basic stuff)
macros/latex/contrib/aeb_pro (various subdirectories)
macros/latex/contrib/aeb_tilebg

mind you, dps has lost me with the various bits he's uploaded, and i'm
not at all sure i understand all their interrelationships.

there's more on his web site, but afaict he does eventually upload
everything there to ctan.

Message-ID: <fd59e9e70809191725o554a8520l3116af70f24888b2@mail.gmail.com>

I am running tex-live on a ubuntu 7.10 system.
I had had tex-live running successfully for a while but recently tried to
add a number of .cls and .sty files.
Once I added these files I was able to use them while running lyx (which
generates .tex files)
Eventually I got around to running latex on my .tex files.
When I did I got the following errors:

        kpathsea: Running mktexfmt pdflatex.fmt
        tcfmgr: config file `tcfmgr.map' (usually in $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig)
not found.
        fmtutil: config file `fmtutil.cnf' not found.

Advice on the web advised me to reinstall tex-live which I did but it did
not help.
Eventually I discovered the texconfig command.
First I tried running texhash from inside texconfig but to no avail.
then I ran conf to show the configuration; the output is shown below.
Some of the  kpathsea variables have odd setting as far as I know.
In particular:

        TEXMFVAR=/home/rocky/.texmf-var
        TEXMFCONFIG=/home/rocky/.texmf-config

not help.
Eventually I discovered the texconfig command.
First I tried running texhash from inside texconfig but to no avail.
then I ran conf to show the configuration; the output is shown below.
Some of the  kpathsea variables have odd settings as far as I know.
In particular:

        TEXMFVAR=/home/rocky/.texmf-var
        TEXMFCONFIG=/home/rocky/.texmf-config

Neither of the above files exist in my home directory (rocky).

Questions

        1) Are these settings the source of my problem.
         2) If they are then how do I get them set correctly.
         3)  If they are not how do I do a proper reinstall.
              I assume I have modified or created a file somewhere
              that is affecting the reinstall but I don't know which file.

Thanks for any help.

Sorry for ignoring you so long: Please apply that patch:

Hi Ralph,

(your question is BTW not really belonging here, because what you are
using the the Debian (Ubuntu) version of TeX Live, which is packaged
quite different. The launchpad bug or any user group of Ubuntu would be
the right place to ask these questions)

Does "successfully" mean that you could compile documents with
	(pdf)latex
?

>         kpathsea: Running mktexfmt pdflatex.fmt

That should *NOT* happen. Formats are pregenearted on Debian, thus also
on Ubuntu.

Your installation seems to be hosed.

Can you call
	update-texmf
and send the output of
	ls -l /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

No

I can only assume that you have some locally modified texmf.cnf

> TEXMFMAIN=/usr/share/texmf

That is fine. Do you have
	/usr/share/texmf/texconfig/tcfmgr
present?

Does anything change when you call
	mktexlsr

Such errors usually happen if you have both teTeX (or some traces of
teTeX) and TeXLive and PATH is not set correctly. Be sure that you
have /usr/local/texlive/200$x/bin/$arch (supply the correct year and
arch) at the beginning of PATH.

Replace that file (if you have installed to c:/Programs)

Subject: [tex-live] fmtutil(-sys) --all reports errors
Message-ID: <200809201258.29693.peter.ragosch@t-online.de>

Hello List,
I've installed TL2008 full-scheme (only win-support excluded) on SuSE 11.0 
x86_64 into path /usr/local/texlive/... without any problem.

But  fmtutil-sys --all reports 13 errors.

I've checked the TeX environment and couldn't found any mismatch with previous 
versions or the SuSE-TeX stuff. So the installation looks to be clean.

I could solve most of them provisionally, but have no idea whats going on on 
(2) and (3).

Any further hints or suggestions are greatly welcome!
Peter Ragosch

==============================================================

I took a deeper look into the log files and found the following:

Most errors, except (2,3) and (4,5), are based on interaction of simplified 
writing of \input argument without file extention (.tex) in .ini files and 
the behaviour of kpsewhich reporting a binary file in this special cases.

May be there is something wrong with my configuration?

The OP was not clear about which version(s) of TeX have been installed.
likely candidates include:

 Ubuntu/Debian packaged teTeX

      In this case the binaries end up in /usr/bin

 Ubuntu/Debian packaged TL

      In this case the binaries end up in /usr/bin

TL installed from CTAN

      In this case, the binaries end up in
           /usr/local/texlive/200$x/bin/$arch

I hate that -- reinstalling without first understanding the source of
the problem
often simply compounds the problems.   It may still be possible to do some
analysis of the .log files from the files processed using lyx.  Look for the
version of the tex program, directories from which files were loaded.

It would appear that lyx is using a different TeX system or perhaps just
a "private" configuration.

These should be directories, but may not be used as their purpose
is to hold user-specific settings.  Many users make the mistake of
running configuration commands as root, so the directories may
be in the home directory of the root user's account.   Alternatively, if the
-sys versions of the tools were used, then the relevant variables
are:

TEXMFSYSVAR=/var/lib/texmf
TEXMFSYSCONFIG=/etc/texmf

There may be two different TeX systems installed in different locations,
or they may be mingled in one location, in which case the package manager
may have left .dpkg-old or .dpkg-new files.

You can use  the locate command to search for multiple copies of key files
such as texmf.cnf.

Subject: [tex-live] MetaPost mfplain in Debian distro
Message-ID: <5736b090809200535y6b4bb907y19369b793f6d4657@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The Debian distros for some time have been challenged regarding the
mfplain input file.
I don't know if this is a packaging problem or a problem with MetaPost.

First, the on-line documentation for mpost is just a mess.  See Matijs
van Zuijlen's bug report
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-tex-maint/2007/12/msg00174.html

But it's worse than that.  Almost nothing works as documented, but
something seems to be wrong with mfplain in particular.

As Matijs points out, there are no ".mem" files whatever in the
distro, so all the -mem and "&" methods for loading them fail.
(Maybe this is a packaging problem?)

However, the .mp files for the base packages are copied to
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/, and
I found that if I enter the name of one as the first mpost input line,
it loaded it....almost:

$ mpost
This is MetaPost, Version 0.993 (Web2C 7.5.6)
**boxes
(/usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/boxes.mp)
*

OK, that looks good.  I can also do this with most of the other
packges in that directory.  However:

$ mpost
This is MetaPost, Version 0.993 (Web2C 7.5.6)
**mfplain
(/usr/share/texmf-texlive/metapost/base/mfplain.mp
Preloading the plain base, version 0.99: preliminaries,
 basic constants and mathematical macros,
 macros for converting units,
! Inconsistent equation (off by 2.77794).
<to be read again>
                   ;
l.230 mm*bpppix_=2.83464;
                               pt*bpppix_=0.996

Is this a packaging problem, or a problem with mfplain?

What can I do to get the functionality of mfplain?

Thanks!

I would (1) use Search to locate "tlmgrgui-real.pl";
(2) Open WinEDT (Notepad doesn't like the line endings
in "tlmgrgui-real.pl" and friends; (3) drag "tlmgrgui-real.pl"
to WinEDT; (4) locate line 29, which should read
"use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(setup_programs platform_desc win32);";
(5) replace it with Norbert's replacement : "use TeXLive::TLUtils 
qw(setup_programs platform_desc win32 debug);" (6) Save the file.

    TL includes the LaTeX notes package but not the graphics files which
    notes.sty calls. This is true for both TL 2007 and 2008.

I changed our ctan2tds to run the make command and install the resulting
{hand,info,warn}.{eps,pdf,png} in tex/latex/notes ... hope there are no

I think it should be present.  This is about the freedom to modify
software, isn't it?  And if I modify the software such that the
corresponding documentation change requires a slightly different
graphic, a free software should also provide the source of the
graphics. Then I can just recreate the graphics with the changes
needed.

Is there really any private content in there, in the sense that you
don't want others to read it (like rants about others or remarks about
your psychological conditions which lead to not continue some idea...)?
Or is it just "ugly"? 

If it is just "ugly", why not upload it? If anyone cares for the
sources, and is annoyed by the "ugly" comments as much as you expect,
they'll remove them. And as soon as they do it the third time with the
third version downloaded from CTAN (or earlier in case the person is
pretty clever), they'll send you a patch for "something that gives a
sensible cleaned source".

I know that I am at the other end of the spectrum to Frank
when it comes to the importance of "freedom to modify",
but I cannot help feeling that demanding the source of
an image is really taking things too far.  What if the
source is a series of artifacts that have been photographed ;
should I provide an exact description of each of the artifacts,
including their size and relative position, so that someone
else can re-create the image and then modify it ?

Bummer. Can you call
	fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex
and send me the output? 

Or better, AS ROOT (!!!) (can you switch permanently to root?) and the
full output of that
	v=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR`
	c=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSCONFIG`
	TEXMFVAR="$v"
	TEXMFCONFIG="$c"
	export TEXMFVAR TEXMFCONFIG
	echo v=$v
	echo c=$c
	bash -x /usr/bin/fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex

Useless.

Mind that I am leaving in a few hours for Tbilisi/Georgia, so I wont be

Thanks to all of you,

I only use Windows on this notebook because I had up to now not been
able to setup network and wlan support under linux and there I know the
patch command but I was wundering if there had been a similar way under
windows too, but if only change the lines that is no problem.
Thanks to all that helped to figure out the problem and find a solution.

Greetings
Martin

Dear Colleagues,

I'm reporting a problem with a TeX Live 2008 setup:

 

TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line
1043.

C:\Users\Miko?aj\Downloads\LaTeX\install-tl\.\tlpkg\installer\lzma\lzmadec.w

Couldn't set up the necessary programs.

Cannot continue with installation.

Please report to texlive at tug.org.

 

Kind regards,

Here is the output; it is the same as before:
     fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex
     tcfmgr: config file `tcfmgr.map' (usually in $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig) not
found.
     fmtutil: config file `fmtutil.cnf' not found.

NOW RUNNING SAME command as root:
output is exactly the same.

Finally using sudo fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex > fmtutil-sys-out I get the
attached file plus the screen output:

    fmtutil: running `pdftex -ini   -jobname=pdflatex -progname=pdflatex
-translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdflatex.ini' ...
    fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt installed.

I don't know why this is different from running as root.

I appreciate any help you provide.  I can't wait a week though so I will

Please don't start a useless discussion, that is a well know thing. If
there is a computer-readable source it should be provided. If you make a
photo then the photo is all that is needed.

If you use xfig to create a diagram and make an eps from it the .fig
file should be shipped, too.

It is not SOOOOOOOO complicated to grab what is the intention, or?

Imagine that the image is a gnuplot graph. The data for the graph were
calculated by the Octave program that consists of 100+ function files
and a main Octave script that was generated automatically by Perl. (I
have such images.) Do you really want that instead of EPS exported
from gnuplot? And what if the graph is generated by some commercial
SW? If you want to change it, you have the TeX source and the EPS, you
can always make your own graphic

And that is fine...

I don't get it (Ubuntu is braindamaged with respect to root handling).

Is there a difference between:
	sudo fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex
and 
	AS ROOT 
		fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex
and
	AS USER 
		fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex

That is fine. So now you should be able to compile documents!

It looks all completely normal, I don't see the problem.

Now, can you run
	pdflatex
on a simple document as user?

And if not, maybe with
	pdflatex -kpathsea-debug=-1

I can't explain this.  I thought sudo and running as root were the same.
I will have to post this on a ubuntu forum for an explaination.

These are different as described in the previous email.
I have no reason as to why using sudo seems to work but
running a root does not.

Result is the same:
    tcfmgr: config file `tcfmgr.map' (usually in $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig) not
found.
    fmtutil: config file `fmtutil.cnf' not found.

The environment will differ:

$ sudo /usr/bin/printenv
$ sudo /usr/bin/texconfig conf
$ su
# /usr/bin/printenv
# /usr/bin/texconfig conf
# exit
$ su -
# /usr/bin/printenv
# /usr/bin/texconfig conf

might shed some light on the problem.

Say, "pdflatex sample2e", so we all see the same
source file.

or pdflatex  -recorder sample2e and send the
sample2.fls file.  Mine (from Fedora 8)  has:

PWD /Data/u/gwhite/T/test/TL2007

Where the hell is that coming from???

In your texmf.cnf there is
	TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//
and then we get
	.:!!TEXMFMAIN/web2c/pdftex//:!!TEXMFMAIN/web2c///

there is something strange here.

What is the output of
	kpsewhich -var-value TEXMF

It should be
{/home/norbert/.texmf-config,/home/norbert/.texmf-var,/home/norbert/texmf,/etc/texmf,!!/var/lib/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf-texlive}

(besides the user dir changed)

Do you have an environment varialbe
	TEXMF
set?
	echo $TEXMF
please?

Best wishes

Norbert

    I thought sudo and running as root were the same.

As George said, the environments differ.

Anyway, here's my question: does /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
actually define TEXMFMAIN?  And if so, does the file tcfmgr.map actually
exist in $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig/tcfmgr.map?  And if so, does it have a
line whose first field is pdftexconfig.tex?

If the answer to any of those three questions is no, the TeX
installation is fundamentally broken.  If the answer is yes, perhaps
posting your actual texmf.cnf and tcfmgr.map would help.

But it seems this is, as Norbert said, really about the Debian/Ubuntu
(mis)config, and not TeX Live.  If you install vanilla TeX Live, it
might work :).

Good luck,
karl

I get the following:

fmtutil: config file `fmtutil.cnf' not found.
I can't find the format file `pdflatex.fmt'!

I couldn't find file sample2.fls or sample2e.fls anywhere.

as me:

kpsewhich -var-value TEXMF
!!TEXMFMAIN


as root:

kpsewhich -var-value TEXMP

root at tilly:/home/rocky# ie a blank line.

using sudo:

sudo kpsewhich -var-value TEXMF
{/home/rocky/.texmf-config,/home/rocky/.texmf-var,/home/rocky/texmf,/etc/texmf,!!/var/lib/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf,!!/usr/share/texmf-texlive}

Its the same in the case that I use sudo.

I get the same result as rocky, as root, and using sudo.
e.g.:

 sudo echo $TEXMF
!!TEXMFMAIN

Well, sorry, I cannot help you. Somehow you have set an environment
variable that overrides the configuration.

What do you expect that it will work??? Who told you to do that (AND
NO!!! The texlive packages didn't do anything like that).

I guess you have to think back where you have set this variable, could
be /etc/profile, /etc/environment, or 50tousand other places. 

End of thread. Remove that variable and it will work.

Bummer, so much time for self created problems.

Message-ID: <200809202231.m8KMVZi25776@f7.net>

Hi Steve,

    As Matijs points out, there are no ".mem" files whatever in the
    distro, so all the -mem and "&" methods for loading them fail.
    (Maybe this is a packaging problem?)

I couldn't say.  This is the vanilla TeX Live list, Debian-specific
issues need to be reported to Debian.

    What can I do to get the functionality of mfplain?

mfplain is meant to be dumped as a mem, not read as a straight file.
Therefore:

$ mpost -ini mfplain dump

And then

$ mpost \&./mfplain yourfile.mf

I don't recall why mfplain isn't directly in TL any more, or if it ever
was.  Maybe we thought no one used it?  Yours is the first report I've
ever seen about it :).  Seems like it should be easy enough to (re)add,
in any case.

Best,
Karl

I had no recollection of setting any environment variable.
However, I checked my .bashrc file and found:
export TEXMF={$HOMETEXMF,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!TEXMFMAIN}
I remember now finding instructions on the web to set this as part of
installing the llncs.cls file.
I assume this is a big part of my problem.
I will remove it and try again.

Sorry for using so much of your time.

Thanks to all those who helped.

So we get to blame Springer :).

Most definitely.

Hi Peter,

    But  fmtutil-sys --all reports 13 errors.

Do you have any TEX* environment variables set?

    writing of \input argument without file extention (.tex) in .ini files and 
    the behaviour of kpsewhich reporting a binary file in this special cases.

Were you in the actual bin/x86_64-linux directory when fmtutil-sys ran?
That would explain those errors.

But I see no reason why we shouldn't change the .ini file to use the
explicit .tex extensions, so thanks for reporting that.

    May be there is something wrong with my configuration?

fmtutil-sys certainly runs without complaint "usually".  You've done a
lot of debugging and fixing, but it shouldn't have been necessary!  Strange.
I'm afraid I have no immediate idea why the jadetex.fmt build is failing
for you.

Please report ... but I am quite sure that all will work afterwards.

Yes, everything is fine now.
Even my llncs.cls file works.

Sorry for all the grief.

Dear Steve White,

> Is this a packaging problem, or a problem with mfplain?

In TL 2008, mfmp.ini for mfplain is prepared, but it is not used.
Please add
mfmp  mpost - --translate-file=cp227.tcx mfmp.ini
to your fmtutil.cnf
and
ln -s mpost mfmp.
Please use the name "mfmp" (if possible), because
TL-2008-W32 has the command mfmp.exe.
The mfmp.mem is created by
fmtutil(-sys) --byfmt mfmp.

Best,

What happens, if the source belongs to a program that is not generally

As a corollary of this thread: Maybe the installer should do something
like this:

  set | grep -i tex | less

to show the user what environment variables related to tex (or not)
are set, together with a message that the user have to check them.

I don't think it /is/ a "useless discussion", Norbert :
it represents one end of a continuum, and as others
have already commented, it is by no means the only
thorn in the side of the "source must be provided" rule.

Well, thank you for persisting to the end -- many people would have given up and
gone off to reinstall linux from scratch.   We need to find more
effective ways to deal
with cases such as yours -- the internet is cumulative so the bad
advice you found
will probably be found by others for years to come.

Hi,
texconfig doesn't use whiptail indeed.  Instead, it uses its own
version of dialog called tcdialog.  Binaries are provided for every
Unix system supported by TL.

$ ls bin/*/tcdialog|grep solaris
bin/i386-solaris/tcdialog
bin/sparc-solaris/tcdialog

What exactly doesn't work?

Regards,
  Reinhard

No.  I've started 'fmtutil-sys --all' from my HOME, but the TEXDIR belongs to 
USERS --- not to ROOT --- for simplifying upgrades. I know that's 
not "correct", but gives no trouble in the past.

Using
unset TEXINPUTS
unset TEXMFCONFIG
first, as Rolf suggested, kpsewhich finds the right tex files and fmtutil runs 
without any problem --- including jadetex.fmt.

So, there is no reason for changing the .ini files at all.

Many thanks for your reply.

1) Still

(and strangly nowhere mentioned)

%texdoc  tlmgr

say

"tlmgr update --all

Update all packages."

missing: and installs new.

2) Far less important:

 --dry-run

is listed as and option for update as "--all", "--list" and
"<packagename>" which is not exactly true: it can be a secondary
option, but not the primary one;

3) Also --dry-run is more verbose than --list it is still less verbose
than an actual update --all
Also only --list returns version numbers (so some information about
forthcoming update could be provided only by it)


4) Non-obvious, important for many but is not mentioned: "tlmgr is smart"

a) if package on the mirror is older than already installed, tlmgr
does not downgrade
b) if package is no more part of TeXLive tlmgr does not remove
c) If package is for the different architecture it is not installed

Actually tlmgr is smarter than documentation (which is also a part of
tlmgr.pl); so in a sense tlmgr is smarter than it tells you :-)

Almost every executable program in TL has a man page, and every man
pages have been converted in pdf to be accessible from texdoc (mainly
because windows users usually don't have a man reader). So the pdf you
see is generated from tlmgr.1 and I'd bet this one is generated from
tlmgr --help (or both are generate form the same source in pod format).

Actually, I don't feel comfortable either with --dry-run output being
different from the actual output. That's just not the way I'd expect it
to work. tlmgr gurus, any comment on this?

Still wondering if this is actually "smart" btw, since it implies there
will be a difference between a fresh install and a old installation kept
up-to-date with tlmgr. Anyway, if you like it...

Yes, it looks this way

So, if collection is new it is not installed? Say, mathabx was
installed by tlmg update --all because it was part of fontsextra (sp?)
collection but intro-scientific was not because it was not part

Still: it should be

tlmgr update --all

Update all collections (including new packages which are parts of
these collections)

So, my suggestion to check new packages
%tlmgr list | egrep -v "^i|binary|00|win32|wintools|darwin|scheme-"

makes sense (without egrep -v list is too huge: there are 1264 alien binaries!)

Not a guru, but definitely it should mock-remove before mock-install

Well, the alternative of disappearing packages is worse. Ideally
(IMHO) it should ask what should be done with this package: left,
removed or "removed and reinstalled into local TDS but I know that you
do not want to touch it (and have a good reason)

For Debian, this would fail the condition of being able to rebuild
everything from source with only free software (and publically existing
software, of course) - so it couldn't be distributed neither with nor
without the source.

For TeXLive (and personally), I have no problem with including the
package without this "useless" source.  I wouldn't mind having it there,
too. Maybe someone groks the syntax, finds the idea interesting and
writes their own program to create a fig from it...

On the contrary, with "real" TeX Live all the files are kept out of the system
trees.  Given the basic rule that root should run only what is necessary
and nothing else, the TEXDIR should belong to whatever user manages
TeX, and the -sys functions should be run as that user (e.g., sudo -u texadm ..
is preferable to sudo ...).

Yeah, that is right.

Well, that is in fact a pain. THe support of --dry-run is infact only
here to have it across most commands. Maybe I change that
	--dry-run
behaves like 
	--list

It cannot behave the same way as --all since that would need actual
installation removal. Well, maybe, with some changes we are testing I
can change the wording, too.

BUT GUYS, is this important????

Not surprising. One could install packages from a local mirror.

Not surprising :-)

Why? Can you give me the place where the documentation lacks behind? I

Currently some output is generated from TLMedia->install_package and
thus it cannot be the same output without actually installing stuff.

With the safer_update.patch I have moved all the info("..") calls to the
tlmgr program from TLMedia so it should be possible ... but only up to a
point. And then, isit important?

multiple sources are already possible. Do you want to remove packages
which have been installed via
	tlmgr -location http://my.server.foo/texlive/comm-fonts/ install ...
no, you don't.

THat is done. All collections which are installed are updated, and on
that way all new packages included in one of the installed collections
will be installed.

Hi Christian,

as far as I know there are up to know no official covers for the DVDs,
but if the TUG wants to use them as the official ones I just need the
Info what is missing on them or what I need to change and I will put it
on, but if you would like to have them I can sent them to you.

Greetings Martin

I agree, in case one would separate USERS from ROOT as usual, sudo -u texadm 
is an interesting strategy on a multiuser system.

Not you: documentation. I checked with 10628 the latest in SVN
  update [option] [pkg...]
           Updates the packages given as arguments to the latest version
           available at the installation source. Options:

           --list
               List the packages which would be updated or newly installed.

           --all
               Update all packages.

           --dry-run
               Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be per-
               formed are written to the terminal.  (A more verbose report
               than "--list".)

So, it says "Update all packages". At least it should say that it
updates all installed collections which includes installing new
packages belonging to these collections.

Most of the people believe that "update --all" ONLY updates existing
packages and wonder how they should know which are new packages to
install. Then they observe that new packages are installed (not
realizing that they are installed because they belong to existing
collections) and relax.

So they miss new collections (may be with one package in it). Then
later they will learn that tlmgr cheated them not installing some
package.

Such behavior of tlmgr is not very intuitive. Not that such behavior
is taboo but it must be explained in details in --help what exactly is
installed by update --all.

What about new collections? IMHO they should be either installed by
default or user should be prompted: Do you want to install a new
collection?.

Finally there should be a way to learn which packages (available
through tlmgr) I miss without looking through 3000+ lines of %tlmgr
list or piping through grep

===

TeXLive 2008 is a huge leap forward in comparison with TL2007, tlmgr rocks.
However documentation should be more complete, leaving no ambiguity at
least in the most crucial task

Actually yes. I am in the Dept of Math, where everyone uses (la)trex
including those who are innocent as babies with computers (some manage
to switch them on only after 5-10 attempts). Now I persuaded to
install TL2008 (actually MacxTeX2008 in the majority of cases) or
installed by myself to computers of my esteemed colleagues. Then I
need to explain in very few words how to keep things current.

If   (sudo) tlmgr update --all  did all the job it would be very nice.
Anyway, since there are much more updates than installations everyone
who learned this line should be considered as a specialist while those
who learned
%tlmgr install thispackage
are true experts.

However how to learn what we are missing. I amsure that suggesting to
my esteemed colleagues to run

tlmgr list | egrep -v "^i|binary|00|win32|wintools|darwin|scheme-"

would be considered as insanely complicated

Hi Martin,
there will certainly be official covers for the DVD and I assume that
they are in production already.  But I suppose your main intention was
to provide a cover for the ISO image which can be downloaded from
tug.org.

Since there is a network installer now, the preferred way to install
TL is to use it.  I hope that not many people really need the ISO
image any more.  Using the network installer also disburdens tug.org
and CTAN significantly.

BTW, the official name is 'TeX Live', not 'TeXlive'.  We had a long
discussion on this list recently about publishing the sources.
Regarding your DVD cover, much more people would benefit from your
work if you make the sources available.

Don't you think it's nice if a Chinese can create a Chinese version?

Victor,

I will work again on the tlmgr documentation.  It is an incremental
process.

I can't remember the last time we added or removed a collection.
It is very rare.  I don't think that's an issue in practice.

    tlmgr list | egrep -v "^i|binary|00|win32|wintools|darwin|scheme-"
    would be considered as insanely complicated

Yes, this is clearly the wrong thing to be forced to run.

Hi Reinhard,

I just created them because I needed a Cover for some teachers I must
teach to use TeX, and I found nowhere the right order how to write TeX
Live but I will Change it. And if there is Interest as far as I see for
this kind of Cover I will post them as soon as I have changed the name.

The only intention was to give away a dvd that has a cover with the
basic instructions and not everybody in germany has a dsl line to load
tl over the net. so a cover will always be needed but for the most of
the people it is correct that they will use the netinstaller. But you
can't tell people to use tex if you tell them you will need to load
about 2 GB out of the net by a 56k modem line... they just will tell ya
that you are crazy and that they don't want to load about 3 weeks just
for the tool you told them about. You see here that there still will be
a need for a dvd version of texlive, but a kind of updatescript for a
folderversion would be a nice tool, so you just create a folder and do
not set any links, the folder contains all the files needed and before
burning an image you can just run an updatetool, burn the dvd and give
away an up-to-date version of the TeX Live DVD.

Greetings
Martin

Well you can always find someone who will be really upset that he has
not the package he is entitled to even if he will never use it or
anything else beyond amsmath, amssymb and amssymb   :-)

That's just an individual package.  Not a collection.  I simply forgot
to add it to collection-documentation-english yesterday ( done earlier
today).

I stand by my statement :).

Hey, Karl,

Thanks for your explanation, it got me a bit farther.

However, there is a problem, my time was wasted, as was other people's.
Some effort on the part of the TeX folks could help a lot.

(In the rest, I am addressing whoever is in charge of TeX-Live, as
well as Karl.)

As I said, a report has been filed with Debian.  Nothing happened.  I
don't think they knew what to do with it.  What would they do?  Spend
hours as Matijs and I have fiddling with the thing?
Or write to this list, as I have?  Are you suggesting that we have
both written to the wrong people?

I don't know how the software was intended to work.  As installed on
Debian systems, it doesn't seem to work the way the documentation
describes it.

This could be viewed a communication problem.

OK thanks! that work-around got me going.

If this had been plainly stated in the mpost man page and/or the PDF
help file, my immediate problem would not have arisen.

Maybe many people tried to use it, saw the hours ticking by, and gave
up. A tiny fraction of them wrote but reports.   Outlandish idea?

Karl, my report was maybe the first you've seen, but let me point out
again, reports have been filed elsewhere (I mentioned Matijs van
Zuijlen's bug report
   http://lists.debian.org/debian-tex-maint/2007/12/msg00174.html )

I don't know how the software is meant to be installed, and I don't
know whose fault it is, I just know that the first time I tried it, it
did not work as advertized.

My understanding is that this list is the bug reporting system for the
project.  You have two bug reports.  Please work together with the
Debian folks to improve the distribution of your software.

Thanks!

Hi Steve,

Right.  We are adding mfplain to TL now that you have reported it :).
Should be there for download within a few days.

I never saw the Debian bug report, since I am not involved with Debian.

A (much) better to do this is:
    TEXINPUTS=/home/peter/work/Tex//:

The trailing : says "substitute the default paths, whatever they are".

And, FYI, there is no reason to ever use more than two /'s.

    TEXDIR=/usr/local/texlive/2008//

This setting is not needed or desirable at all.

    So, there is no reason for changing the .ini files at all.

I already did :).  It was a useful change because of the conflicts with
the binary names, in any case.  People have run into that on occasion.

Thanks,

Ok, I see. That's precisely because I suspected something like this that

I'm sorry, but I think it is. Not seeing the same output from --dry-run
as from the real run can negatively impact the user's confidence in
tlmgr, and we should avoid that.

OTOH, it won't prevent me from sleeping if you tell me it's not possible
right now and will be possible only later.

Hi, all,

Please CC me on replies (I'm not subscribed).

I tried yesterday to update my TL2008 installation with 'tlmgr'.  The  
update "succeeded" (see below), but afterwards, TeXShop complained  
that 'pdflatex' was missing.  I then tried to both update and install  
that file by name, using 4 different mirrors.  All failed.

Turns out (adding to my list of things learned today) that this is a  
symlink to 'pdftex', so the fix appears easy.  I just wonder how many  
similar problems are lurking.

Thanks for your replies, in advance, and for the hard work that went  
into this distribution.  It's been quite simple to deal with (at least  
up until 'pdflatex' went missing :-}).

Justin

Are you talking about:
  #457711: texlive-metapost: mpost man page does not match reality

Do be honest: Do you expect a understaffed group, at the moment mostly
me (yes, Debian/TeX Live is also my creation) to care for a not-so-well
written man page when there are hundreds of more involved bugs present.
Take a look at the bug listings 
	http://bugs.debian.org/src:texlive-base
and rejoice. 

I prefer spending my time programming stuff for TeX Live (like tlmgr)
and fixing real bugs than fixing man pages.

Again, we are volunteers, you are free to improve the man page and send
me fixes, or better directly here.

If you have different problems than the man page please file decent bug
report. Titles containing "...man page..." are quite sure to be ignored.

That is true, mfplain has not been set up at all. Period. That was the
case in TeX Live 2007, so it is the case in the Debian packages. And
what the man page says is irrelevant to some point (well to the point
that we cannot and will not check each and every man page, volunteers,
step forward!).

A bit understanding of a TeX system might help. If you want to fiddle
with things which are not provided by the distribution (Debian TeX Live,
or for 2007, also normal TeX Live), then you should know your way around
the corners of a TeX system.

Well, then nobody can complain.

As mentioned above, that is about a MAN page. Please file decent bug
reports, a title
	Please add mfplain format
	Please make mfplain working
or something else would be useful.

Nobodies fault. It was just not included in the sense not set up at all.
And nobody complained.

Right. It is.

It has already been fixed. And will probably be included in the Debian
packges of TeX Live 2008.

I explained this already once, please do not forget to read my emails.
This is impossible for the time being!!! We do NOT keep copies of all
the texlive.tlpdb from the server on the local installation. So there is
NO way to see what packages have been added. The only case where we can
detect this is in already installed collections, because there we have
the old list of dependencies and the new list of dependencies.

So, no, there is no way to detect that ATM. Sorry.

Well, the case that new packages in already installed collections are
reported as new is in fact an addition we did on your request. Mind that
the packages have been installed already before this change. And now the
documentation for that specific thing lacks behind, we will fix it.

But, to be honest, if this is the only point of incomplete documentation
of tlmgr then I would be overly happy, because tlmgr would be 99% fully
documented ;-)))

Strange. Was really only the link missing and everything else working.

Karl, can you look into the respective package (must be bin-latex?)
whether the link is present?

Hera are the symptoms:

<log_message>
The interactive texconfig utility will be started now. Make sure
your screen has at least 24 rows and 80 columns. If texconfig
crashes now, you can still set up your teTeX system using the
batch mode of texconfig.  Try 'texconfig help' to get a list
of options.

The interactive mode works best with a real vt100 terminal or
inside an xterm window.

Then return closes the application and goes back to prompt.

whiptail seems to be in texconfig-dialog
# grep whiptail `which texconfig-dialog`
    for bin in whiptail dialog
# 
    
If I run texconfig with the /bin/sh -x modifier set in texconfig and 
texconfig-dialog, I can see that the PATH is explored for whiptail without 
success.

I was misleaded by the first lines of texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg:

That was the reaction of 'tlmgr' when I wanted to install  
'pdflatex' ("strange....").

I can't guarantee that "only the link was missing"; I replaced the  
link by hand, and I can typeset again, but TL2008 is a fairly involved  
setup, and I have no clue whether everything else is copacetic.

But that wouldn't be contributing *to*; that would be contributing  
*from*, no?

Thanks for the followup.

Try enlarging your xterm and retry. Maybe that is the only cause of
problems for you.

> I was misleaded by the first lines of texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg:

Right. We will fix that. Sorry, it should have been
	-localcfg
instead -local. But I will write a bit more into the -hdr file. But this
will only help new installation because updmap.cfg is never generated
automatically to not override local changes.

Thank you for your prompt response.
The phrase "System nie mo?e odnale?? okre?lonej ?cie?ki." Comes probably from my Polish Windows Vista distribution and means more-less: "System cannot find the given path". Sorry for forgetting to translate this.
Actually I solved the problem by moving the installation package somewhat close to the C:\ path. Then, everything went OK. Anyway, still one could have a problem if s/he didn't guess to move the installation package.

Hmmmmmm... I don't get it. the pdflatex link is in 
	bin-latex.i386-linux
(or the respective package for different arch-os combinations).

But your log file below did show that bin-latex has NOT been updated.
So why should that remove the link?

And tlmgr install pdflatex does not remove the link either, it only
tells you that there is no packages pdflatex, right?

For your log file:

That is BAD ... what does happen here. Do you have
	updmap-sys
in your path? Can you call it as root or the one who installed TeX Live.

Especially since afterwards calls to updmap succeeded.

Hmmmm, that is part of

do you have that one installed?

Looks fine.

So I don't understand what has happened here.

Did you install TL via our install package or via the MacTeX (or how it
is called) installer?

Maybe the Darwin people can help here

Welllllll, in some way it would be both, because by absorbing funds from
the "Institute for the Absorption of Federal Funds", which seems to be
federal, too, I would at the same time absorb from (take the money from
it) and contribute to (as I am working in the sense of the Institute).

That is very much a G?delian argument, or better Cantor, if you remember
the Cantor's paradox about the set containing all the sets which do not
contain itself ...

I did, I know that a minimum size is required. I set explicitly the
terminal type as vt100 or xterm, no way.

It seems that the missing whiptail program called by texconfig-dialog
is the problem.

Is it possible to skip it and to execute texconfig with the TL2007
dialog utility ?

the pandora fonts have a licence that precludes their distribution (they
are "nocommercial" in current terms).

a couple of years back, i had an exchange with neena billawala about
this.  i deduced that she hadn't really intended that it should be shut
out of tex live (not that tex live was around in 1989 when she put the
fonts on ctan).  however, there were problems with mail to her (she
doesn't have a mailbox of her own any longer) and exchanges via an
intermediary petered out (presumably the intermediary failed to forward
a couple of my mails).

in fact, there's a better interface to the fonts than mfnfss (catalogue
pandora-latex, but that's not available in tex live either since there's
no point).  mfnfss also provides an interface to the yannis's old german
fonts, so it's not entirely pointless having it in tex live.

OK, but it seems that this command updates texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
instead of texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg

#cp texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
does not help, as updmap-sys ignores the changes.

I use the --enable option of updmap-sys, but it works on a file by file basis
(not an issue for me, I have only two map files to add).

Nice to hear (there are almost 100 of them already). So basically

%tlmgr update --all

is everything what users need to know to feel themselves tlmgr-experts

However how one can learn about particular collection:

%tlmgr show foo-collection

explains that it consists of packages dealing with foo but does not
list them. Can package belong to more than one collection?

Even if it was 99.99% fully documented at this moment the only command
every user must know

update --all

is only 90% documented since documentation does not tell that "new
packages belonging to installed collections are also installed";
I put 90% because packages are updated much more often than new appear
but you cannot say that "most likely there will be no new packages".

Good point. Maybe I add
	tlmgr show --full something
which will also show the dependencies (which will mean the included
packages) and the execute statements.

And no, a package can only belong to ONE collection, but to different
schemes.

> is only 90% documented since documentation does not tell that "new

Ok, so *one* function of tlmgr is documented up to 90%. Guess we can
manage that, and still we will change it.

Yep.  However, the list is up to date.

Would it be possible that ctan2tds the MakeCJK function is located in
TeXLive.txt, and that ctan2tds simply sources it?  Then *I* can
maintain everything, taking away the burden that you have to fiddle
around with it.

    As a corollary of this thread: Maybe the installer should do something
    like this:

      set | grep -i tex | less

    to show the user what environment variables related to tex (or not)
    are set, together with a message that the user have to check them.

I like that idea in general.
Thanks for the suggestion.

Message-ID: <BE3E9AE4-E867-4705-8C93-5DDC6CD71B26@hamazone.de>

Hello,

I just discovered, that on Windows (Vista in this case) the name of  
the file texmf-dist/tex/generic/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz/libraries/ 
tikzlibrarydecorations.pathmorphing.code.tex is truncated by one  
character, leaving it as tikzlibrarydecorations.pathmorphing.code.te
As a consequence it cannot be found by the tikz/pgf package. Renaming  
the file and rebuilding the index fixes the issue. I guess this is a  
problem with some container file format that cannot handle filenames  
this long, somewhere in the process of distribution.

Can you reproduce the problem I have? I also use MacTex 2008 and I did  
not encounter this problem there.

I am not subscribed to this list, so please Cc: me in your replies.

I cannot confirm. Also on Vista with the latest TeX Live 2008
everything is fine.

Windows has problems with file names longer than $number. I think it's
255. Maybe it can be recproduced if texmf-dist is put under
D:\already\long\path\.

Oh yes, texconfig-dialog mentions whiptail indeed.  The relevant
function in texconfig-dialog is:

If this is what is happening, it is not a bug we (TL) can do anything
about.  Please report it to the pgf maintainer (Till Tantau) so he can
change the filename if he so chooses.

(It would not surprise me if there were other such cases.  255 seems
like a very small limit.)

Ciao caro Emiliano,

We were informed (rightly) that the Guit-Beamer class is non-free in the
sense that it has a non-commercial clause:

>From the README:
  Commons Public License v2.5, with these License Elements:
    * Attribution
    * Non Commercial

I have to say that this will force us to remove guitbeamer immediately
from the TeX Live distribution completely.

In case that you decide to change the license to LPPL or something else
compatible with TeX Live we will wait for another upload of guitbeamer
to CTAN.

Please let us know about your decision.

I have the same problem on my windows XP machine.

But I don't think that limit of file name length is the source of problem,
because the same directory has another file, the name of which is longer
than the file above mentioned and not truncated at all.

I am not a programmer, but I guess that lzma win32 version may have some bug.

    However, the list is up to date.

There was no easy way for me to determine that.  And using the old "CJK"
instead of "cjk" did not inspire confidence that TeXLive.txt had been
fully updated.

    Would it be possible that ctan2tds the MakeCJK function is located in
    TeXLive.txt

I see no MakeCJK function in TeXLive.txt.  Did you mean that you would
write one?  If that's the case, yes, sure.  If you write a function that
will drop into ctan2tds (using the variables we have, etc.), I can
arrange to source it somehow, I'm sure.

Thanks,

    But your log file below did show that bin-latex has NOT been updated.
    So why should that remove the link?

The problem is the known one that you have fixed and we are testing
right now.

That is, FYI Justin, our updates currently work by:

1) remove the package.
2) download the new version.
3) install the new version.
4) done.

If something goes wrong during 2) or 3), the package is gone.  Including
the pdflatex link in this case.

For instance, if the download switches mirrors, the other big problem
you have already solved and we are testing ...

    Did you install TL via our install package or via the MacTeX (or how it
    is called) installer?

I do not believe it has anything to do with MacTeX.  The result of a
MacTeX install is, inside the texlive tree, the same as our install.
All they include is a few other things to help Mac users outside the main
texlive tree.

I do not remember his arguments specifically, but basically the idea was
to use the system's dialog or whiptail if it was provided.  But if they
don't exist, then it's supposed to fall back on the same tcdialog we
have always provided.

What was the actual error that led you to believe that whiptail needed
to exist on the system?  (Sorry if I missed it.)  It should not have to.

This is a strange bug. The CJK package coming with TeXLive uses 'song'  
or 'cyberbit' font by default for UTF8 which is intentionally not  
installed. See the notes in
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/languages/japanese/CJK/4.8.1/doc/fonts.txt
As a result, people will find that CJK does not work with UTF-8 unless  
they choose a right font like 'gbsn'.

Well, the log file I sent was from my first use of tlmgr to update  
TL2008, and after I did this, TeXShop started grousing about  
'pdflatex' being missing.

I do have it, and I did run it, both as myself and root.  "/usr/

No, the Institute is an independent organization.  The Federal

But all this aside, I gather from Karl's message that a fix is  
actively pending; and since I seem to be making progress, I'm happy  
for now.

Thanks for the help!

Open an xterm, enlarge it, run texconfig-sys, get the warning about
the required terminal setup:
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2008-September/018188.html

When I press return, I'm back to prompt.

This was silent about missing whiptail.
Tracing the execution with /bin/sh -x showed that whiptail was not found,
but I'm not sure that this is really the problem, there may be another issue.

I'm used to install missing software from source, but whiptail sources seem 
quite difficult to find, so I couldn't check.

I did not get a fallback to the previous dialog anyway.

It always take a pretty long time for tlmgr to update oberdiek and I
find that many packages have new dates (I mean as files). However
usually each updates involves very few packages: say in the last one
according to oberdiek.pdf only zref has release date of 2008/09/21 and
the rest has 2008/09/13 or earlier. So actually only zref (and the
covering oberdiek.pdf and related files need to be updated). IMHO
oberdiek needs to be a category or treated more intelligently

For the moment, I think it's ok, just drop it from TeXLive. I hope it 
will be in any case available on CTAN (which I think it's another 
entity, by the means of TeXLive).

At the moment I don't have the time to update the class (some changes 
are required, I remember an old email sent by you asking for sources 
of pdf graphics;  I think the sources of the German translation could 
be available too and I plan to include an English translation of the 
manual in the next release). It will cost me some time to make all the 
pieces fit. Of course, in the process of reviewing it, I will surely 
think about a change in the license, so it could be included in future 
releases of TeXLive.

THat is the way the package is uploaded to CTAN and we will follow that,
any other changes would be too mind-boggling.

    Not you: documentation.

I've made some more updates to the tlmgr pod description.  I wrote this

  Update already-installed packages, and install new packages in installed
  collections.  (Packages in uninstalled collections are not considered.)

No doubt plenty of improvements remain to be made.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with pgf/tikz in tl 2008 on Windows
Message-ID: <200809231707.m8NH7BpM021563@comp.uark.edu>


With regard to the discussion of the file in pgf having
a truncated name:

The file in question has the wrong name in pgf.tar
I downloaded pgf.tar.lzma from www.ctan.org just 5 minutes ago.
The output of
    lzma d pgf.tar.lzma pgf.tar
    tar -tf pgf.tar

is, in part,

.../tikz/libraries/tikzlibrarydecorations.pathmorphing.code.te

(Line truncated at the start for readability.) The database
texlive.tlpdb has it listed corectly. Thus, the problem should
appear in any TeX Live that installed via the current archive.

Windows may or may not have a character limit of 255 on filenames,
but it certainly doesn't have such a limit on pathnames, and even
the length of this particular path shouldn't come anywhere near 255.
The path starting at "texmf..." is only 101. I can't believe anyone
would install it in a path with 155 characters before that.
"C:\Program Files\TeXLive\2008\"  only comes to 30.

I don't know whether it's 255, but it *is* short. It's so short that we
use truncated directory names at work (this is on a network share), in
real life. The intuitive names give too long names.

I just pulled a copy of pgf.tar.lzma from CTAN; the file is dated
14th August.  After decompression, inspection shows that the archive
is in "ustar" format.  Inspection also shows that the name stored in
the archive for that particular file is 100 bytes long and is not
truncated; it has the trailing ".tex" with the final "x".  On my system
(OpenBSD/i386-current), both the system tar and GNU tar report the correct
name when listing the archive's table of contents and both tar utilities
give the file its proper name when extracting from the archive.

It appears that your tar utility is incorrectly truncating the name.  In
a "ustar" format archive, for historical reasons, the archive member name
is split into two pieces: a prefix, given 155 bytes of storage space, and
a name, given 100 bytes of storage space.  If the full name is 100 bytes
or less, the "ustar" format puts it in the name space and leaves the
prefix space empty.  Otherwise, the name is split at a directory separator
character (/) and the first piece is put in the prefix space and the
second piece in the name space.  Historically, some programmers have made
the mistake of thinking that these spaces hold C style (null-terminated)
strings and that, taking into account the terminating null byte, the
maximum lengths are 154 for the prefix and 99 for the name.  This is not
the case; if the name is exactly 100 bytes long, the name part of the
header will hold that 100 byte name with no terminating null byte.

Where does this error message come from?   From msvcrt?  Where does
the word "fixme" come from?  Certainly not from Microsoft,  they are
not interested in user feedback at all.

Can you provide more information?  If you want to help to solve the
problem, install

  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx

It's quite crude but better than nothing.

For me on tug.org, lzmadec | tar doesn't have the truncated x.

Whether it's a bug in tar or lzma or Windows or whatever, the only
realistic way to address it is to have Till rename the file.  Perhaps
you would be willing to write him about it?

Thanks,

I have found that the problem was due to the tar.exe of win32 version
of texlive 2008 distribution.

On Windows XP, I have downloaded pgf.tar.lzma and extracted it with
lzmadec.win32.exe.  The extracted file, pgf.tar, had no problem,
because when I copied it to my Macintosh platform and untarred,
all filenames were ok.  So, we can say that lzma of texlive win32 distribution
had done its job perfectly.

Returned back again to Windows, now I untarred the the same file
with the tar.exe shipped with mingw32, not with texlive distribution.
This time, file name was not truncated at all.  As a result, it became
evident that tar.exe contained in texlive win32 distribution is the culprit.

I would appreciate if anybody confirm this.

Message-ID: <19af81400809232355u5bd09464x39ab16b21ca426b3@mail.gmail.com>

There is a little problem with tug web-server and LZMA (at least for
Darwin): it tries to assign to it extension txt which means that MIME
type is not defined. Some users could find the task of removing
extension and chmod-ing too challenging. May be it would be better to
distribute binaries for LZMA in zipped form (together with the
README)'


PS I noticed it only now since I compiled it by myself but today after
little discussion in texhax I decided to check if it was that
impossible task to use precompiled binaries :)

	As was already answered on the list, this message comes from
	Wine.  The message, however, seems to be mostly harmless.

	I'm in doubt that this software will run under Wine, will it?
	Or can I use, e. g., strace(1) instead?

	For the sake of completeness, here is the output produced by the
	command when the ecrm.mf file is installed:

It is quite possible and nothing to worry about if a mf-file inputs
another one. It is also quite natural that the lh-fonts use files from
the cm and the ec-family.

Just for the record of curiosities, I'm installing TeX Live on Ubuntu  
---the first try (with the GUI installer) got stuck when it reached  
guitbeamer; I clicked the ``Install TeX Live'' button again, and once  
more it got stuck with guitbeamer.

I had to quit the installer and relaunched telling it to ignore  
previous installation. Right now it is installing the pst- branch, so  
I guess it will continue without any further problem.

I think I was unfortunate enough to connect to the mirror when  
guitbeamer was still in its database, but by the time it tried to  
install said class this was no longer in the repository.

Best,

Axel

	Shouldn't there be a

No idea. But I have some doubts that such a system could be managed as
almost every package loads (and so depends on) other packages. miktex
use some sort of trigger system: If during a compilation a file is
missing it looks up in its list of packages if there is one which
contains the file and then installs it.

The package is actually named "ec", and I've added the dependency.

    I am a bit confused: I noticed that tlmgr updates binaries almost
    every day despite the fact that their compilation dates 5 weeks ago.

Well, I updated the fmtutil script yesterday, so that would account for
some of them.

Regarding dvipsk, though, only the Windows binary was updated (not for
any very important reason).  I'm wildly guessing that that unnecessarily
triggered updating of bin-dvipsk.universal-darwin.  The actual darwin
binaries haven't changed since r10023 (September 11), and tlpdb
correctly says r10023 for bin-dvipsk.universal-darwin.

Norbert?

    sudo tlmgr --location=http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 update --all

What would help a lot in this kind of debugging is to see the revision
numbers involved, ie, why it thought it needed to be updated.

1) Victor, can you please run --list or --dry-run first to get them?

2) Norbert, can you hack tlmgr to show the rev numbers when it actually
   does the updates?  (Sorry if our test version is already doing this.)

Yes but not pdftex itself. And I noticed the same on my laptop with tlmgr 10704
and on two desktops with no svn manual update

So far no new packages so I will try tomorrow morning --list
--dry-run does not return versions

    There is a little problem with tug web-server and LZMA (at least for
    Darwin): it tries to assign to it extension txt which means that MIME
    type is not defined. Some users could find the task of removing
    extension and chmod-ing too challenging. May be it would be better to
    distribute binaries for LZMA in zipped form (together with the
    README)'

What url precisely is involved and where did you find it?  

What do you mean by "tries to assign to it extension txt"?  That your
browser on darwin wanted to save something as foo.exe.txt?

    evident that tar.exe contained in texlive win32 distribution is the
    culprit.

Akira has provided a new tar.exe which I have just committed to the
repository, so it should be in the new installer packages.  

Unfortunately I can't update the texlive.infra package right now (where
tar.exe is) without updating more than we want to.  ASAP, maybe next week.
Anyone who wants it desperately will need to get it from svn.

No, it is not true for everything but if I try to download darwin it
tries to save

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzma.universal-darwin?revision=9317
 it as
lzma.universal-darwin.txt
with no -x- permissions (not a big deal but could be confusing for some)

it is true for both Safari and Firefox but it should be true for any
browser: all browsers except early versions of M$ Exploder rely upon
server to provide MIME type (and server looks at configuration files
and override instructions).

	Well, Debian GNU/Linux has about 18000 packages to watch over...

	It's much less trouble for ELF, though, since binaries contain
	lists of the libraries they depend on.

	A tool that performs a minimal installation and then tries every
	package to correctly install and to perform correctly (running
	some package-specific tests, e. g., trying to typeset a sample
	document using the package; building documentation may serve as
	a test) may be useful.

No it was not useless: just run UNIX command

chmod a+x foo.pl

These GUI lovers, command line haters! :-)

PS Mac is UNIX and on UNIX you can pipe simple commands to make a
chain where output of one commands becomes an input for the next

%%%%%%%%%%%

Possible confusion is exactly reason why I suggest to distribute even
standalone binaries enveloping them into zip

Strange. AFAIR (long time that I programmed that) the revision numbers
are adjusted after splitting of the binary package. But I may err on
that. I will try to check, but being on Georgia teaching does not leave
much time.

The tlmgr in the repository now has all the safer update patches, it
echos
	update foobar (NNN -> MMM) ... done
on update. Fine?


For Victor: --dry-run echos now the very same lines as without
--dry-run, save the post  install actions which I cannot execute without
messing up some things.

Yes I noticed but since it does not print version numbers it does not
substitute update --list

The new version of tlmgr I checked in just 20min ago I was talking about.
Probably not what you have.

But please IF you fetch it, you also need the files from
	Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/
especially TLMedia.pm, TLPOBJ.pm, and TLUtils.pm, otherwise everything 
will break. 

But that would give you tests for:
- safer update (make tar before removing package)
- --dry-run echos exactely what real run does (besides post install stuff)
- real update (with or without --dry-run) echos revision numbers.

Bye

No error and no implications! This comes if you first run tlmgr as a
root and then as an ordinary user:
so left-overs of the root activity are not for user. However as an
ordinary user you do not change anything - just look for output, so
the damage done only to feelings :-)

	Most probably, no, I won't have enough free time any time soon.

	Though if I'd write any code that could even remotely be helpful
	with respect to this particular problem, I'll surely report it
	to the list.

A question to this call. If I try the same I get

After logging in as root it works. My system is Linux (openSUSE 11.0).
What is wrong?

I have just looked into Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb and I cannot see
depencies in individual packages. Are there somewhere else? For
instance, my ean13isbn depends on ean by Petr Olsak but it is
mentioned in longdesc only. I could check my packages because I know
what they need.

the longdesc comes from what i've written in the catalogue description.

the catalogue could (it seems to me) actually have a "requires" tag,
which could then be processed into the tlpdb entry.  i'll pass the idea
past my fellow ctanners.

it would, after all, keep me in a job ... i've only got about 10 weeks'
outstanding work on the catalogue at present ;-)

I thought so, you have copied the text that I have supplied when
uploading the package. I thought that someone wiould read it when
preparing the packages for TL, for MiKTeX or other distribution.
However, my question was whether the dependencies of individiual
packages are stored somewhere in the TL svn repository.

texlive-latex-base = collection-latexbase

So we should have kvoptions.sty in collection-latexbase. 

Unfortunately kvoptions is part of oberdiek, so that would mean moving
all the oberdiek packages to collection-latexbase.

Should be do that?

Best wishes

that's as may be, but moving 76 packages to latex base to get kvoptions
needs other justification, imo.

heiko's already outlined that justification: he has a group of such
packages, in the oberdiek bundle, all required by hyperref.

Dear Colleagues -- I noticed recently a suggestion
that a site such as Mininova might be more appropriate
as the tracker for TeX Live than the Pirate Bay.
I took a look at Mininova today, and I see they
have a "content producer" category for which we
would seem to qualify.

	http://www.mininova.org/apply

Do you think we should register as such, and if
so, who should the named individual be (Karl,
Robin, ...) ?

This is indeed the right thing to do.

It looks to me like we don't have ia64-linux binaries (?)... ia64 is
distinct from x86_64 (aka amd64), right?  If this is the problem, then
I'm afraid you have no other choice than building TL yourself or waiting
for your distro to provide TL'08.  Of course if you choose the first
option you're welcome to ask for more help here if needed and upload
your binaries afterwards so that everyone on ia64-linux can use them.

sebastian was much enthused by dtl, when it first appeared -- i guess
around the time he was starting tex live.

in fact, back then, we hadn't actually understood the significance of
the licence.

i agree with you, that there's no indication of any licence terms --
i'll update the catalogue to "noinfo" rather than "unknown" some time
... i've a bit of a backlog (it being my son's birthday).

let's leave it as a nice anomaly for karl to chew on...

You have two TeX systems installed, and the TL2008 is AFTER the one you
have installed.

Look:

That is derived from 
	$Master = `kpsewhich -var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT`
and then
	$Master/tlpkg/
is added.

Somehow your SELFAUTOPARENT expands to /usr/lib/texmf, which surprises
me!!!

You should add the TL2008 binary dir to the FRONT of the PATH:

	export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/arch-os/:$PATH

(in bash)

No. They aren't. Mostly because most authors not even KNOW what their
packages depend on.

We TRY to put package in collections so that the dependencies are
fullfilled. So in your case both packages should be either in
collection-latexextra, or the one you are depending on in
collection-latexbase. But we do NOT introduce single package
dependencies.

IF someone (again volunteer question) steps forward to write some test
system that could give us a decent approximation we could *think* about
it, but until that time, no.

It worked out quite well till now. Consider the Debian packages where
collections are single packages, we got relatively few complains about
missing dependencies. Most of them we did resolve.

Hope I wasn't hopelessly unclear.

Best wishes

Norbert

Hi,
using sudo on system comparable to Ralfs, I got the same result.

for me PATH starts with /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux, 
only /opt/kde3/bin goes always to first position, after some time.
 And even if I've changed it back, sudo tlmgr doesn't work and looks

Nevertheless, su -c "command" works without any error and I guess the sudo 
behavior must be discussed with people that are deeper involved into 
distribution internals.

Can you in both cases do

and send the output, then we should see the difference.

Maybe you have an environmental variable
	TEXMF
or so set.

Look at "printenv" and "sudo printenv" , maybe with grep for ^PATH=
and TEX.

Running something as complex and unproven as tlmgr with more than
ordinary privileges is a risk.  The real TeX Live is self-contained, so once
the top level directory is created and ownership changed to that of the TL
manager, root is not required.

Linux users have come to expect that they will have to hunt down a
package, e.g. when a compile fails due to a missing header, so
most probably sort out missing dependencies without asking.
MiKTeX users are a bit spoiled.

In my view, the best use of manpower is to refine collections.
In the long run, I'd like to see journals recommending that authors
use collections X+Y and linux distributions including collection
Z in the list of packages for "software developer's workstation".

The MacTeX installer sets things up so that the texlive hierarchy is
owned by root which obviously means that tlmgr requires root privileges
if it is to make changes to the file system. Should users change this
post-install? (Or should the installer really be setting things up
differently?)

Sorry, but you have no idea. Debian and even more Ubuntu people are used

Then step forward and do it! We had already several people trying to

ever did some work.

You can if you want to and are used to doing so with other software.  I
wouldn't recommend it as a general practice that all Mac users should follow.

    (Or should the installer really be setting things up differently?)

It was a conscious decision by Dick and Jonathan when they wrote the
installer.

Phil, I see no reason it shouldn't be you, assuming you are the one who
is going to put it there.  It shouldn't be me or RobinL.  We aren't
going to be dealing with torrents.

Feel free to put in "TeX Users Group" for the organization if you wish

don't see that it's going to matter much.

Damien, thanks for this info.  We will be glad if Phil, you, or anyone
else sets up torrents for TeX Live wherever it seems appropriate, and
I'll add the url's to the TL page.  I don't see that it hurts anything
if the torrents are available from multiple places.

The MacTeX installer has to create directories and adjust the
default path.  Post install you can do:

$ cd /usr/local/texlive
$ sudo chown -R <tladm user>:<tladm group> 2008

After that the <tladm user> can use tlmgr without the need
for "sudo".   One problem is that other users can potentially
run tlmgr at the same time, so you might want to adjust
permissions on tlmgr so that only <tladm user> can run it:

$ chmod 700 /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

If you adopt this approach, the <tladm user> can run the -sys
commands to update the main tree.   If you have more than
one admin user, you can use "sudo -u <tladm user> tlmgr", etc.

It is hard to come up with an installer that handles all situations.
Similar issues come up with linux packages -- root permission
is needed to put files into "system" directories and update the
master database.  Many organizations have realized this is a
big security problem, so people are looking into configurations
where root installs a basic set of system packages and users
control applications into a separate tree with a separate
database.   This creates new problems (the app packages
have dependencies on system packages, so the app package
manager needs to read the system database), etc.

printenv shows the expected pathes to TL2008 for TEXDIR, PATH, MANPATH, 
INFOPATH, as well as the right TEXINPUTS, which is /home/peter/work/Tex//.

sudo printenv shows none TEX related path and tlmgr fails (which becomes now 
logical to me).

Yes, I agree fully with that. And it's not my personally intention to run 
tlmgr with ROOT rights. But, in the case TL should be placed into the system 
path, like /usr/local/... or something else, this would normally (or easiest) 
be done as ROOT.

I've choosen to place TL below /usr/local/..., but changed the owner to 
myself. But now I must take care that no script runs as ROOT by accident.

And, yes, in case TL is used by more then one USER it is good decision to 
change the TL owner to tladmin or something else. You mentioned that in a 
previous mail.

The "sudo tlmgr problem" was no serious problem for me, and the mismatch 
between SuSEs old teTeX and TL2008 will be hopefully fixed by use of dummy 
packages, which will be kindly provided by Wolfgang next days.

Because so many packages were listed as "unknown" when we started
license reviews, and the meaning of "unknown" was unclear, we did not
(and have not) eliminate(d) them from TL.  There are in fact over 120
packages with catalogue-license unknown in TL.

As Robin goes through them, we update accordingly.  It all takes time.

Do you have a standard message or what is crucial to say?

Is there a list of packages in TL which fall into this category (as
opposed to the licence-genuinely-unknown-default-nonfree category)? I'm
not sure how to distinguish the cases on CTAN...

Thanks,

the catalogue is slowly losing its "unknown" licence entries in favour
of "noinfo" (meaning what it says) or real categories from "other-free"
and "other-nonfree" to increasingly more detailed specifications.

my working notes get copied (at least once a day) to
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rf10/unknown-licences.txt
i've just copied a version there.

there were 738 entries to process when i started; there are now 612;
there are 3304 entries in the catalogue.  (i've not even the excuse of
youth for all this misspent time -- there were well under 2000 when i
started working on the catalogue, and only the new files uploaded to
dante, over that time, were done by anyone other than me...)

Every situation is different, so there is no canned message.  What's
crucial to get across is simply that there is no licensing information,
and we'd like to get some direction about whether it's intended to be free.

    Is there a list of packages in TL which fall into this category 

Look at texlive.tlpdb and search for "license unknown" (no quotes).

    (as opposed to the licence-genuinely-unknown-default-nonfree category)? 

I'm not sure what you mean, unless it is noinfo.  I see TL is up to 20
noinfo packages now, due to Robin's work.  Those are actually the ones
it would make sense to concentrate on first, as far as researching and
contacting authors go.

So somebody could respond to an email rather than reuploading to CTAN,
for example?

I think that's what I meant - packages for which there is no
information in the package vs. packages which might contain the
information but where this isn't entered into the CTAN catalogue
metadata.

Exactly.  I usually offer to update it on CTAN myself if they are
agreeable but don't want to take the time themselves.  This has happened
several times with contributors who haven't been active for years.

    packages for which there is no information in the package

That is catalogue-license noinfo.  Those are the ones to concentrate on.

    vs. packages which might contain the information but where this
    isn't entered into the CTAN catalogue metadata.

Those are catalogue-license unknown.  Don't worry about those for the
time being.

Just to be clear about this: texlive.tlpdb does not distinguish CTAN's
unknown category from the noinfo category, correct? So the relevant
packages are a subset of those texlive.tlpdb lists as "unknown"?

No, the relevant packages are listed as "noinfo".

The catalogue-license field in tlpdb is simply a copy of what is in the

Axel, you somehow ended up with the HTML representation of the page,
instead of the actual content of the file.

    server to provide MIME type (and server looks at configuration files
    and override instructions).

Sure, I am well aware :).  But I don't want to add a dozen ugly
mime-type special cases for the lzma binaries.  Since we didn't give the
files an extension, there's no easy way to do it.

As for also providing the binaries as .zip's, I guess it could be done
more maintainably.  We'd want to set up a Makefile so that the .zip's
were automatically remade when the binaries changed, else they'd
undoubtedly get out of sync.

Maybe yours doesn't, but mine does :).  For example, adrlist:

catalogue-license noinfo

Probably the catalogue changes happened since you installed.  We
wouldn't update packages just because the catalogue-license changed.

You can rsync or svn checkout texlive.tlpdb from the repo.  I disabled it
from web access because it's modified every day, and the search engines

he's right, you know.

i thought someone had mentioned (in the last day or so) that noinfo had
started to appear, but it's not -- that i can see -- in my last night's
mirror of systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

(clea -- the tex live packages get into ctan via my mirror of tug.org to
cambridge.)

so when does the mirror get to see the changed tlpdb?  is that only when
something "significant" has changed?

there really isn't any "noinfo" in the mirror, so unless people are
_working on_ tex live rather than _using_ it, they won't have seen it.

(note, i don't consider myself to be working on tex live -- i've more
than enough to do with ctan and the catalogue.)

    so when does the mirror get to see the changed tlpdb?  is that only when
    something "significant" has changed?

Ok, I see that texlive.tlpdb in the tlnet directory that gets mirrored
has old Catalogue info, while the tlpdb in the live repo has current
info.

I think it's because of the way we update tlnet.  I'll try to straighten
it out.

Actually with AllowOverride one can ForceType  on all files in this directory.
Still zipping is IMHO better

Yes, that was the story with Safari; but with the very same path wget  
downloaded the .pl file without a problem.

What determines which catalog entries get "catalogue-license" lines?
I can see how the 00texlive entries don't need them since they come under
the overall license, although I'm sure some lawyer would have a different
notion.  Many packages don't appear to provide the line:

 $ egrep '^name|^catalogue-license'
/opt/tex/texlive/svn/Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb |head -20
name 00texlive-installation.config
name 00texlive.config
name 00texlive.core

the catalogue licence comes from (surprise!) the catalogue.

this provides two prerequisites:
  that a catalogue entry exists (that's true of all the above except
    possibly guit)
  that a connection between catalogue entry and package has been made

I have occasionally encountered similar error messages. They come
from the GUI library, not from the program itself. Since in other
respects the installer behaved as expected, as you experienced
yourself, I didn't try to track down the cause of this misbehavior.

    one can ForceType  on all files in this directory.

Thanks for the tip.  It wouldn't make sense to ForceType in the svn
directory, but I set up a separate directory http://tug.org/texlive/lzma
(just a symlink into the repo, so nothing to maintain), and did
ForceType application/x-executable.

Before I change the link on acquire.html, is that the right mime-type?
I have no way to test, since my browser (seamonkey et al. on gnu/linux)
does not add .txt extensions.

    Still zipping is IMHO better

I don't disagree, but life is short and this was easier.

I just tested with .htaccess
......................
<FilesMatch "lzma">
ForceType application/octet-stream
</FilesMatch>
......................

At least on Mac Safari does not attempt to display file anymore and
does not add txt

Still one needs (after downloading) to chmod a+x and change name to lzma f

As long as you do not have any other files but  *lzma* in the
directory you do not need
<FilesMatch "lzma"> </FilesMatch> envelope (which selects files with
the string lzma in their names).

PS It would not work if AllowOverride does not allow ForceType
(on our server httpd.conf says

AllowOverride All)

giving users all the rights to screw up their webpages)

AllowOverride All

Well, it is how our server runs

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.html#allowoverride

and so far nobody hacked it (may be because nobody tried)

AuthConfig, Limit

are much more often used than FileInfo

this clears a long-standing thread on the tex live list, so that (after
updating) we can have both ctan and tex live (and presumably miktex as
well) at the same version number.

(i believe there may be another version to come, but that it will take
some time.)

Good.

    Still one needs (after downloading) to chmod a+x 

I don't know of any way to control that.  Actually, I'm just as happy
that browsers do not download files and decide to make them executable
on their own, so even if there's a way to configure it, I don't want to.

     and change name to lzma f

"lzma f"?  I don't understand the need to change the name at all.  But
anyway, doing anything other than what I have already done is not worth
the time.  This is all incredibly tangential, because the only people
who are going to even contemplate downloading these binaries are those
who have some clue about what to do with them.

I changed the link on acquire.html.

I have looked at the official list of MIME media types at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/ and there is nothing that
could enable making downloaded files executable. The trick in svn is
the svn:executable property. It makes the file executable if you fetch
it by a svn client.

Agree. Simply some users should not be surprised that by default file

Misprint. However lzma.universal-darwin (etc) is too cumbersome; so if

    so when does the mirror get to see the changed tlpdb?  is that only when
    something "significant" has changed?

The mirrored tlpdb is updated every day, but yes, the catalogue-*
fields for a given package in the mirrored tlpdb are only updated when
that package is "really" updated.  We could change that, but it doesn't
seem that critical to me.

Clea, please just use the development texlive.tlpdb for license research.

Message-ID: <a6e8c1d0809290355o79881490u537408b47243d54d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a document which seems to have its bullet points missing in
xelatex only (not in pdflatex).

Examining the logs i see (for the xelatex run, but not for the pdflatex run):
Missing character: There is no ?\x80? in font bchr7t!
(many times)

Also I tried with the default font, and you get the same but with
'cmr10' instead of bchr7t.

I'm assuming this is a font map problem, but I thought xetex would use
the same maps as pdflatex.

Does anyone have any idea what I can investigate next?

I would say it is an encoding problem. Make a complete example.

Hard to tell without seeing a minimal test case.

If you run sample2e.tex (should be found in tex/latex/base) with  
xelatex, do the bullets appear ok? If so, I'd guess your document has  
some font encoding and/or input encoding stuff that isn't xetex- 
friendly.

(By the way, this would probably be better asked on the xetex list, as  
it looks like a xetex question more than a texlive one.)

It seems that applying patch #6 is equivalent to stop at patch #5, i.e.
we can avoid to change .../texk/web2c/configure.

In any case, the result is that xetex.exe depend on a few Cygwin dlls:

$ cygcheck texlive-20080930-source/inst/bin/i386-cygwin/xetex.exe

I can reproduce the problem like so:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{gmverb}
\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
\item test
\item 123
\end{itemize}
\end{document}

pdflatex = bullet points present.
xelatex = no bullets atall.

Can someone let me know if this happens on their install.

Yes, it does. But the shortvrb package works fine with XeLaTeX.

Same here, gmutils (loaded by gmverb) seems to interfere, specifically the line
  \@ifXeTeX{\chardef\textbullet="2022 }{\def\textbullet{$\bullet$}}

Proven by the sample document

\documentclass{article}
\chardef\textbullet="2022
\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
\item test
\item 123
\end{itemize}
\end{document}

Running
  This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.999.6 (MiKTeX 2.7)

Right, so its a gmutils thing. I will notify the package author (CC

gmverb redefines \textbullet. It does it even in a xetex aware way:

\@ifXeTeX{\chardef\textbullet="2022 }{\def\textbullet{$\bullet$}}

But this new definition works only if the current font is a unicode
font. The simplest cure is to loard xltxtra after gmverb which you
should do anyway.

Dear Colleagues -- I will need to install TeX Live 2008
for various friends in the near future, and will be using
the ISO image to burn a DVD from which I will then install.
Following installation (Scheme: full), I would like to perform
a routine upgrade from Cambridge, and to leave the installer
configured such that all future updates are also taken from
Cambridge.  Could you please advise me how best to complete
the last two steps ?  Also, can TLMGR integrate with the
Windows Scheduler such that it could be set to perform
an automatic update at (say) 04:00 every morning ?

That's fine for the first post-install routine
upgrade, Norbert, but how can I leave it so that
that remains the default location thereafter ?
All subsequent updates will have to be performed
by highly unsophisticated (w.r.t. TeX Live) users ...

Ah, mea culpa : I mentally parsed

	tlmgr option location http://cambridge...

as

	tlmgr <option>location</> http://cambridge...

(i.e., as tlmgr -location <etc>)

Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.


> man pages and 

I've cracked this joke before, but :

	"man pages"

on ur-Windows yields

	"man" : unknown verb.  Did you perhaps means "person" ?

Now that one is probably true :-)

update your dictionary to one that contain computer related words, then
you will not get this error. Simple.

Or simply use "texdoc tlmgr" :-) It's for you (I mean, all the windows
users) that we convert all man pages into pdf to make them acessible via
texdoc...

Subject: [tex-live] improving tlmgr pod2html output?
Message-ID: <200809301308.m8UD8XC27128@tug.org>

The HTML output of our tlmgr pod documentation is hard to read, because
the nested lists don't appear nested in the output at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html.  At least not for me (using
current seamonkey or firefox or icecat on GNU/Linux).

The pod in tlmgr.pl uses =over 4 for the main tlmgr actions, and then
=over 8 for the options to the actions.  The plain text output is fine,
but the HTML does not nest the second level.

I looked around some but could not find an easy recipe to fix it.
Would anyone like to investigate this more deeply?  That would be nice ...

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] Could LZMA compression be combined with SFX format ?
Message-ID: <48E22C29.4040308@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear Colleagues -- As my download of the .ISO.LZMA version
of TeX Live 2008 nears completion, I am looking at 7-Zip
as a means of unpacking it (I already have the TLNET
unpacker : I was just investigating other options).  And
on researching 7-Zip, I see that it appears to support
the generation of SFX (self-extracting executable) files
for Windows.  My question is therefore this : given the
general resistance of Windows users (such as myself) to
the use of any "non-standard" compression system (i.e.,
anything other than ZIP), might there be some merit in
packing TeX Live as an SFX version of .ISO.LZMA ?  Is
it safe to assume that the standard *X unpackers will
still be able to see inside the archive, once converted
to SFX form ?  And what might the SFX overheads be (I
should know the answer to this shortly, as I propose to
create an SFX version and compare file sizes).

After testing, the SFX file is actually /smaller/
than the original LZMA !!!!!

1 235 222 Kb v. 1 248 282 Kb for the original LZMA

Are there any Unix users who would be willing to
test whether the SFX file can be successfully
unmangled under Unix ?

Hi all,

Victor Ivrii suggested
(news://news:119/bf11b9af-8488-430e-9f6f-79658052c8e8 at 59g2000hsb.googlegroups.com)
I ask here to include the package avm.sty, which is in the lingtrees
bundle to be included in TeXlive.

But actually, I don?t really need it (only ir I review other people?s
work using it), so my real question would be: could you enhance the
tlmgr to be able to install any package found on CTAN?

Thanks, H.
