Hi Staszek,

> Thanks to Akira I've just updated in svn repo most of binaries for win32
> (rev. 8428). Tomorrow packages will be updated on ftp.

On the dvipdfmx:

Please add the following new files which are in the zip:
(1) dvipdfmx.dll
(2) xbb.exe
(3) extractbb.exe

dvipdfmx.exe is now a dll caller and it does not work
without dvipdfmx.dll. xbb.exe and extractbb.exe are
also dll callers and they are necessary tools used with
dvipdfmx.exe.
ebb.exe also calls dvipdfmx.dll.

Best regards,
Akira

There will be no xbb in the Unix/TL -- extractbb suffices.

Agreed. xbb is an alias of extractbb and it is not needed.

Many thanks. I've commited (1) and (3) (rev. 8443) and wait for the
decission concerning xbb.exe, as Karl noted in other mail.

Fortunatelly, no need to change patterns in bin-dvipdfmx.tlpsrc
at the moment. Just to note: we have here dvipdfmx, ebb and exctractbb
but have extractbb binaries only for i386-linux and win32, actually.

All the best,

[TeXLive Rev 8449]

In Remove->Search, entering `cjk', I first see collection-langcjk.
Pressing `next', I see other packages.  But at some moment, pressing
`next' doesn't do anything because there is no entry fitting the
search expression.  I consider this not optimal.  Either add a `back'
button, or `next' wraps searching and starts again from the beginning.

Another nit: After entering a search string, pressing the enter key
does nothing.  I suggest to map it to the `next' action.

Finally, clicking on the `toggle' key of `Configuration->Create
formats on installation', I get the following error message on the
console:

  Tk::Error: Cannot open
    /usr/local/backup/TeXLive/Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
  for writing: Permission denied at
    /usr/local/backup/TeXLive/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 278,
    <TMP> line 100221.
  ...

(this directory is write protected on my GNU/Linux box).  Maybe a
better action is to either offer to store a configuration file in the
user's home directory or to pop up a window which tells the user that
the configuration settings can't be stored.

Ok, will do that soon.

Enter is not necessary, it automatically goes to the first matching
entry. THe next is only necessary if you want to search another item. So
mapping Enter to Next is not good because some people will type in a
search term, then press enter, and would end up in the second match.

Yes. These options are saved in the texlive.tlpdb. And your copy is (as
you told me) read-only. No surprise ;-)

These settings are per-installation and are saved in texlive.tlpdb,
there is (and will not be) another file.

Popping up a info box might be useful.

Message-ID: <20080602090137.GA9653@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all,

(Manuel, for you the misplaced files below might be interesting. Can you
somehow fix that in ctan2tds? Thanks)

I am putting my Debian hat on, so here are some bugs we should somehow
fix:

- texmf-dist/tex/latex/arabi/arabic.ldf
  does: \InputIfFileExists{Arabicore.sty}{% ...
  but there is only a file arabicore.sty (a <-> A)
  patch: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive-new/trunk/texlive-lang/debian/patches/20_lowercase_Arabicore?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

- texmf-dist/bibtex/bib/acmconf/pubform.bib
  contains the standard headers for LaTeX including the character table
  but the character table contains \@ which is bad in a bibtex file,
  since there are no comments in bibtex files, only ignored stuff.
  patch: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive-new/trunk/texlive-extra/debian/patches/fix-pubform-bib?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

- texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/wsuipa/compilefonts
  this is a script that should be run, but it starts with the
  documentation without any comment markers, should be patched
  patch: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive-new/trunk/texlive-extra/debian/patches/10_wsuipa?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

- two bugs in texmf-dist/tex/latex/g-brief/g-brief.cls:
  - \Telefon is defined two times. See Debian bug 423919, no response
    from upstream
  - a missplaced } in \unterschrift, Debian bug 407968, no response
  patch: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive-new/trunk/texlive-extra/debian/patches/g-brief-fix?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

- texmf-dist/source/latex/feynmf/feynmf.pl
  a temp file fix and a perl syntax fix
  patch: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive-new/trunk/texlive-bin/debian/patches/52_feynmf-perl-sec-fix?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

- Build/source/texk/dvipdfm/pdfdoc.c
  there is a bug in dvipdfm with 0.5 timezones, see Debian bug 409517
  for a detailed discussion and Ubuntu bug 66474.
  Interestingly I seem to remember that that was fixed upstream!
  patch: http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive-new/trunk/texlive-bin/debian/patches/61_dvipdfm_timezone?op=file&rev=0&sc=0


There are two my knowledge two misplaced files, 
- texmf-dist/doc/latex/bangtex/bangfont.tex should go to
  texmf-dist/tex/latex/bangtex/
  (done manually)

- texmf-dist/doc/latex/otibet/otibet.tex should go to
  texmf-dist/tex/latex/otibet/
  (done manually)


As far as I see that is all we can currently contribute ;-)

Unfortunately I have not the time and resources to track all that to the
up-upstream authors or do all the fixes manually.

Best wishes

Norbert

Dear Laurent,

on Debian we got a bug report, but it applies the same way to TeX Live
upstream version:

----- Forwarded message from Julian Gilbey <jdg at debian.org> -----
> I was just looking at the proba.sty package, and wondering what the
> purpose of a couple of the macros was.  I looked for the proba.dtx

----- End forwarded message -----

Since we cannot distribute the file proba.sty as long as it looks like
this we would have to remove it from TeX Live for the release of 2008.

Could you please upload a new version with either a fixed header which
and a statement that it is licensed under your choosen (hopefully free)
license, or upload proba.dtx and proba.sty together to CTAN.

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

i've updated the file as requested (re-installed twice since i forgot
about the email address first time).

we do have a directory macros/generic/kastrup (containing binhex); i
could move it there, if that would help.  personally, i would prefer to
perpetuate the general rule in the latex tree, with one package per
directory, so putting it in macros/generic/patch or m/g/kastrup-patch

wdyt?

i note the catalogue wittily listed the file as lppl anyway.  :-}

For single-shot single-file generic code a subdirectory of the same name
does not really buy anything with regard to ordering things.  In this
case, I would think the macros/generic/kastrup placement to be an
improvement.  Contrast that to macros/latex/bigfoot where the files
constitute a coherent bundle.

If this causes complications with regard to docstripping things, I can
see whether I can provide somewhat more of an infrastructure here.

> i note the catalogue wittily listed the file as lppl anyway.  :-}

I actually did not remember at all, or I would likely have done
something about it earlier.

Well, as I said: a subdirectory for a single file does not really

But it does, for instance for trying to rationalize (or automate) the
update process.  

Imagine you want to update a directory that contains a collection of a
number of packages, put there over a period of time, and the updater is
a not-very-bright guy who makes a lot of mistakes and is in a hurry that
day (say, me, for instance  :-) ).  A package maybe goes from one file
to two, maybe by adding a README file, something gets overwritten, .. .

Really, when engineering the management of a whole lot of stuff it is
*much* cleaner to go one-dir-per.

So does it mean, that now the only [two] ways to update the binaries are:
1) use svn
2) make a new installation of texlive

Or maybe just copy the binaries manually?

Agreed. Taking a look at our ctan2tds script it makes me wonder why not
all are one-dir-per-package.

Just to let you all note: I updated again many TL bin/win32 binaries.

Many thanks to Akira for maintaining and fast reaction (as usual :-).

Currently best is to reinstall, the stuff is changing too fast.

Furthermore, I have re-enabled the updating of these packages, since in
*MY* experience tar is moaning, but actually replacing the file.

Ahh, forgot to add a hint, sorry.
wget ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev/tlpkg/bin-texlive.tar.lzma
wget ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev/tlpkg/texlive-infra.tar.lzma

and upack them in the stucture. I'm not sure if this work as expected,
because the format of texlive.tlpdb was changed 2 days ago and I do not
know if it can cooperate well with .tlpdb in your installation
(both are compared). Good luck, anyway (and please change the thread name
for the next time, OK? :-)

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live testing packages on CTAN
Message-ID: <200806022243.m52Mhwe17578@f7.net>

FYI, the CTAN folks are in the process of mirroring 
the /texlive/tlnet/tldev/ directory on tug.org, so that download/install
testing, etc., can take place in something resembling the production
environment.  And also to reduce the load on tug.org.

So, after another 24 hours or so, please use
ftp://mirror.ctan.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev/ (or your favorite CTAN site
explicitly, of course) instead of tug.org, when feasible.

We are not yet building candidate release images.  That is my next task,
but I doubt it will happen before next week, at best.

Thanks,
Karl

    Well, as I said: a subdirectory for a single file does not really
    simplify things.

FWIW, regardless of what is done on CTAN, in TL each package has a
separate subdirectory.  It is too much trouble in many ways to do
otherwise.  (There are a few "grandfathered" exceptions now which will
be eliminated in time.)

Message-ID: <ed4892840806022015k42fdf9a1w68fe468d8bd52b2e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am using \xetexpicfile to include a jpg file, but I get problem when
specify the `scaled' parameter.  if I use `scaled 100', then I get a
very small image, so I have to experiment many time before I know
scaled 600 is a suitable value.   So I think my question should be, if
the image size is H x V in pixel, how should I specify the `scaled'
parameter to have the image just as width as the \textwidth?

Thank you.

HA!  Yesterday I was indoctrinated that mirror.ctan.org can't be used
for FTP :-)  You have to use HTTP.

Don't use 'scaled' to do this, use 'width'.

   \XeTeXpicfile "mypicture.jpg" width \textwidth

Please note: that's http://mirror.ctan.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev/

The automatic mirror selection only works in HTTP URLs.
Randy's system (who runs mirror.ctan.org) has no CTAN files at all.

give us a chance!  rainer only sent a mail to the mirrors list yesterday
afternoon -- we don't "just" add a gbyte to all our mirrors' holdings
without giving them adequate notice.

i would suggest we start mirroring from the tug box tonight, but i've
not discussed it with my ctan colleagues.

  I agree.

  But it's a simple work to update dvipdfm.
Recent version is 0.13.2d. TeX Live svn version is 0.13.2c.
The difference is very small, including this timezone bug fix.

Yes, it built and installed successfully (tex binary included). One

I surmise you are running it from the inst/bin/<arch> dir created by
make install.

You have to put the binaries into Master/bin/<arch> and run them from
there for them to actually do anything useful.

Best,

Subject: [tex-live] Serbian & hyphenation patterns (in TL)
Message-ID: <6faad9f00806041713o16365341n644ca180b5961925@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I hope that some Serbs are listening to this mailing list. I have
noticed something weird. serbian.ldf uses Serbian labels in Latin
script, while language.def loads Cyrillic hyphenation patterns
(srhyphc.tex). On CTAN, Latin patterns are available, but not included
on TeX Live (shhyph.tex). Likewise, polyglossia in XeLaTeX checks if a
font contains cyrillic glyphs, but contains Latin labels.

Both patterns seem to contain the same hyphenation exceptions and the
same set of patterns, only in a different script, but the script does
make a big difference to TeX. And both patterns are theoretically
needed, as Serbs write in both scripts (approximately equally often,
maybe slightly biased towards Cyrillic).

I would not be surprised if it turned out that Latin hyphenation
patterns for Serbian were simply replaced by Cyrillic ones once in the
past, while leaving all the labels and general support for Serbian in
Latin script, meaning that Cyrilllic patterns will be used in
documents written in Latin script. Latin 'a' might be at the same
position as the cyrillic one (did not check), and patterns might still
kind-of-work, but I hope that I'm missing something obvious here.

LuaTeX & XeTeX could, theoretically, load both patterns at the same
time, but in polyglossia the two scripts & translations should be
split, at least by some additional optional parameters.

Any hints?

Thanks,
    Mojca

(Well, it would still be useful (and not to hard to implement) to have
Serbian bidirectional transliteration available in TeX :), but that's
another thing.)

Hi Ian and all,

I have installed a new file
  texmf-dist/tex/plain/config/pdftexmagfix.tex
in TeX Live containing the fix for \magnification in pdftex that you and
Heiko created.  It gets \input when the pdftex, pdfetex, and etex
formats are built.

I'll attach the file as I checked it in, for the record.

Thanks,
Karl

    Recent version is 0.13.2d. TeX Live svn version is 0.13.2c.

I wasn't aware of the new version, so thanks.

    The difference is very small, including this timezone bug fix.

Which we already had.  But there is another small fix for finding
fontmap files.  Now that's incorporated too.

Best,

Nope. I ran them after having created a proper texlive/2008 tree, where
I also installed texmf-dist, etc. Built all the format, ran
texconfig-sys to set a couple of things. Everything seems to be in good
order, as far as I can see.

None of the directories listed above is /export/xtp/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c
where texmf.cnf actually is, and it is correctly found by everything else. I'm
attaching the outputs of texconfig-sys for both tl2007 and this build.

Thanks,
Ettore

no -- i doubt if shhyphl was ever in tex-live, since it's not free --
licence is "nocommercial" and has been ever since i installed it way
back.  (i admit that, back then, i wouldn't have known about the
implications for distributions like texlive.)

Announcement: changes and plan for pdftex

Dear all,

in the context of the forthcoming luatex (which is supposed to be pdftex
successor), the pdftex team has agreed on the following decisions:

- we plan to release 1.40.8 soon, which will be included in texlive2008.
  The next version will be 1.50.0 and after that version, pdftex
  development will be essentially stopped. From 1.50.0 onwards, in
  principle only bug fixes are accepted.

- from now on, pdftex will be maintained by me (Han The Thanh). I
  and all other members of the pdftex team thank Martin Schr\"oder for his
  great effort on pdftex maintainance over the years. Thanks to him we've
  seen a steady stream of pdftex releases.

- more structural development takes place in the luatex project, which is a
  continuation of pdftex. However, we will still do our best to keep pdftex
  stable and compliant to pdf standards. In this respect, after 1.50.0 we
  might have to accept some extensions (most likely backported from luatex)
  that are required to keep pdftex compliant with new pdf standards, but
  only in case it is unavoidable.


on the behalf of the pdftex team,
Han The Thanh

Dear all,

I just wanted to inform you that the installer for TeX Live 2008 will by
default pre-generate all formats.

There is a long history about this problem, but finally we came to the
conclusion that it is better that way (or the lesser of two evils).

Dear all,

Today I wrote a patch of animate.sty to work with the recent DVIPDFMx.
If anyone is interested in this topic, one can download it from

http://project.ktug.or.kr/dvipdfmx/contrib/latex/animate.sty.sample

The usage is just to give an option as \usepackage[dvipdfmx]{animate}.
Of course, it requires the current CVS version of DVIPDFMx which  
supports
some extra DVI specials for supporting PGF graphics.

I'd like to discuss this topic with the author of animate.sty,  
Alexander Grahn.

Does anyone know his e-mail address?

Best regards, ChoF.

What does "pre-generate" actually mean?  That the formats will be copied
from the CD, even if it's not a Live CD?

I guess that this saves you from the weirdness we had with jadetex and
friends?

Nope, just that 'fmtutil-sys --all' will be run at the and of the installation

Hi Frank,
format files are still generated on the target system and are not part
of the distribution.

There is an installer option (also in older installers) which allows
you to decide whether the installer should generate all format files.
Otherwise they are created automatically on demand.  

Only the default value of the changed.  The reason for this change is
best explained by example:

Ben Lee User is using some kind of TeX shell and doesn't notice that
format files are created in his HOME directory when he runs latex the
first time.  Then he notices that hyphenation patterns for a
particular language are missing and asks his admin.  But even if the
admin installs the package, it still doesn't work for L.User.

 > I guess that this saves you from the weirdness we had with jadetex and
 > friends?

Not really, format files *have* to be created either during installation
or later.  Since many poeple asked for it, there is a new installer
option now which allows you to change the default paper size from A4
to letter.  Some format files have to be re-created then.

What is the problem with jadetex?  The only difference between jadetex
and other formats I see is that latex.fmt must exist before
jadetex.fmt is created.

If this really causes a lot of trouble, you could ask Sebastian to add
the line

    \input latex.ltx

to [pdf]jadetex.ini.  "&latex" can then be removed from fmtutil.cnf.
It doesn't matter then in which order format files are created. 

On the other hand, for TL-2008 I'd like to avoid big changes unless
they are unavoidable.  I regard this one as a "big" change because too
many people are involved: [pdf]jadetex.ini has to be changed on CTAN
while fmtutil.cnf is maintaned in TeX Live repository.

The most important new feature in TeX Live 2008 is that TL for Windows
is not treated as a single-user system any more, everything which
worked for Unix in the past works for Windows too.  I think that the
challenge for TL-2009 is to port all of Thomas' shell scripts (and the
files Fabrice ported to Perl and C) to texlua.  It turned out that
texlua is the ideal platform for portable scripts in the TeX world.

When we port fmtutil to texlua, we certainly stumble across this
issue.  We could discuss it with Sebastian, but in my opinion it's
the wrong approach.  Since what Sebastian did is correct, I think that
a new version of fmtutil should calculate dependencies.  I don't know
what the current version of fmtutil does but I have not enough time to
reverse-engineer.

Frank, last question:  Do you think that the problems with jadetex are
so severe that something has to be changed in TL-2008?  Hopefully not.

Regards,
  Reinhard

note, however, that it's been on the archive sites for less than 24

Maybe it's worthwhile to think about a better directory
structure. "tlnet/tldev" are some remnants from the testing phase.

AFAIU, this *is* for testing. The final URL will be a different 
one, and tldev will be deleted then.

Ah, which of them?  Will "texconfig paper letter" not do the right
thing, and if not what would I have to change to make it work?

We've tried both approaches in Debian, and both lead to problems. I
don't remember all the details (would have to look it up in the bug
logs), but basically we we had the first problem with the &latex
approach when our maintainer scripts call "fmtutil --all" (e.g. after
changing packages with pool files): jadetex was tried before latex.fmt
was installed (it was still in the temporary directory). There's a
different problem with the \input method, I don't remember it at the
moment.

I don't think changes are necessary for TL-2008.

That would definitely be the cleanest approach. I don't know how we
could do that without changing the semantics of fmtutil.cnf, though.

AFAIK it just works through fmtutil.cnf line by line. If there are two
lines for the same format, it is created twice and the second wins.

No, they were already there in TL 2005, and we have a working solution
(although I admit I don't recall the details).

texconfig changes entries in various config files.  pdftex reads its
config file when the format is built.  Thus, formats which depend on
pdftex have to be re-created.

Yes, it works as expected.  It creates the format files if necessary.

A texlua version will most likely *not* work the same way as the shell
scripts because we want to make use of the features texlua offers.
Especially tables (associative lists) are a powerful concept which
makes it more easy to determine such dependencies.

A stupid question: is the version of texdoc.tlu in the TeX Live
repository up-to-date?  If yes, I hope that I misunderstand the code.

  -- [[ override hardcoded variables with values from texmf.cnf ]]
  rmfile_command = set_var_from_texmf(rmfile_command,'TEXDOC_RMFILE')
  rmdir_command = set_var_from_texmf(rmdir_command,'TEXDOC_RMDIR')

There is only one texmf.cnf file for all platforms, including
Windows.  You cannot set TEXDOC_RMFILE in texmf.cnf any more.  This
should be hard-coded in your script:
 
     if (os.type == "windows") then ....

My proposal:

  * Set reasonable defaults for Unix and Windows in your script.

  * Look for a config file in $TEXMFHOME.

There is no way anymore to put platform dependent stuff into
texmf.cnf.  This limitation was necessary in order to provide a new
feature:  You can install TeX Live 2008 on a server and mount it on
various clients.  In the past this worked perfectly for Unix clients
only, but now it works for Windows clients too.

A config file in TEXMFHOME would be a nice thing.  IMO it's
unavoidable.  And I don't see any reason to have anything texdoc
related in texmf.cnf.

It's quite late for significant changes in TeX Live 2008 but I'm very
interested in the texlua version of texdoc.  Unless I misunderstand
the code in the repository I fear that it doesn't work.

If you have any questions, let's disscuss them by private mail.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] rubibtex and bibliography author sorting
Message-ID: <20080608103856.7d654d8f@logos>

Hello, everybody!

	I have a trouble with Cyrillic bibliography author sorting and
I can't explain that behaviour the other way as a bug... :-(

Symptoms: 
	When authors second name is started from letter ? (the third
letter in russian alphabet) and sorting bibliography style is applied,
then the bibliography record is located BELOW(!) the records with
authors second names, which are started from "highest" letters, e.g.
from P.
	As I can note, that is only reproduced with B-letter : with
others beginning letters of alphabet (A,G,D) the output file has correct
sorting.

Attached files:
1. books.bib -- the bibliography database
2. 2.tex -- the tex source file

All files are utf8-encoded. To produce the output I do following:
iconv -f UTF8 -t KOI8-R ~/books.bib -o books.bib
iconv -f UTF8 -t KOI8-R ~/2.tex -o 2.tex
rm *.{aux,log,toc,pdf}
latex 2
rubibtex 2
latex 2  
pdflatex 2


Thanks, for any helping!

I have not made any changes since ages; IIRC the last change was even
made by Norbert, and was fist done in the TL repository.

It is done like this already, except that I didn't know of os.type (or
maybe it wasn't available one year ago), and do some guessing based on
the PATH separator.

Here you've got a point indeed: I do read texmf.cnf for site-wide
configuration, but there is no possibility at the moment to change the
behaviour on a per-user basis.

Now the question is: Should we use one (user) configuration file for
each texlua script which understands configuration settings?  Or should
there be one central file, similar to a user-specific texmf.cnf?
Personally, I prefer a per-script configuration file, but it might be
tedious if some changes need to be repeated over and over.

And where should such a file be looked for?  What about
$TEXMFHOME/scripts/config/ - the site-wide ones could then go to
$TEXMFSYSCONFIG/scripts/, err, shouldn't the user-specific path be
rather $TEXMFCONFIG/scripts/?

It should work, since texmf.cnf is just needed for local customization.

What do you mean "doesn't work"?  I didn't understand what should fail
exactly?  By the way I'm using daily the TeXLua version of texdoc since quite
some time (the one from Debian's luatex package in testing) and more recently
the version from our SVN rep (I'm a bit outdated: rev 8041).  I didn't notice
problems (except with the catalogue, but I'll open another thread for that).

Please put me in Cc or continue on list, I'm interested in what happens with
texdoc.

I've now read about os.type, and have a view questions:

- is it possible to distinguish OS/2, and if not what will it return?
  msdos?

- What would be useful commands for removing a file or directory on
  OS/2?

- What would be useful commands for viewers on MacOSX? Ideally something
  which reflects the settings of the user, e.g. whether (s)he wants
  Preview or Adobe Reader for PDF files?

Because it has to expand to differnt values on different platforms.

A config file for each script/program is fine.  It's quite usual in
TeX Live (fmtutil.cnf, udmap.cfg,...).  For texdoc this makes most sense
because I suppose it's the only config file most people have to create
and it gives you more freedom when writing a parser.  For instance, a
line in the config file could look like

   texdoc_viewer_dvi = xdvi %s

or

   texdoc_viewer_dvi = "xdvi %s"

but you have much less freedom if you share your config files with
other programs.

TEXMFCONFIG expands to ~/.texlive2008/texmf-config.  The stuff you put
there will be lost next year.  A better alternative for files created
by users is TEXMFHOME.  This survives the next installation and is the
equivalent to TEXMFLOCAL.

IMO the best place is TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf.  The directory
"scripts" should contain the scripts themselves (like texmf/scripts).
Don't know whether TEXMFHOME/texdoc.cnf is appropriate.  It's better
to ask Karl.

A site-wide config file doesn't make much sense, except in a
single-platform environment.  In this case the admin can put it into
TEXMFLOCAL.

What "local" means depends on how you install TL.  If you install it
on a server and mount it on different clients, then all the clients
share the same texmf.cnf file.  You can set the env var TEXMFCNF on
clients but this is always a source of trouble and not recommended.

When using os.execute(), please be careful that file names are
properly quoted, they could contain spaces.  And on Windows TL will be
installed in standard directories now by default, "C:/Program Files",
and TEXMFHOME expands to "C:/documents and settings/<user>".

Another alternative is os.spawn(), a function provided by Taco.  It
does the same as os.execute() but avoids the shell and takes an
argument list (lua table) instead of a string.  This is much more
convenient, but there are some oddities on Windows, as usual.  Though
you pass arguments as a list, you have still to quote file names
containing spaces.  Please look at

   Master/bin/win32/tl-w32-wrapper.texlua 

Look at the function fixwin() and how it is used at the bottom of the
script.  The advantage of this approach over os.execute() is that you
don't have to care about proper quoting and it had been tested already
on Unix and Windows.

  Reinhard

Hi Manuel,
one cannot assume that the program "see" exists on all Unix platforms.
It's not necessarily even installed on all Linux systems.  It's
necessary that users can override the defaults.

Using the following in perl:

I get: OS/2

The native command for deleting a file is "del". There is no native
command for deleting a directory although some methods in Rexx exist.
There is also a port of rm, so that "rm -rf directory" could be used
if gnufutils are installed but you cannot rely upon it. If you want to
delete a directory from perl, you can use rmtree from File::Path, it
works.

  As a matter of fact, it does not exist on Mac OS 10.5, but I don't
know if it was targeted as a Unix platform.

What's the output of

#!/usr/bin/env texlua

print(os.type);
print(os.name);

(on a system with luatex installed, if you have that)?

But if a directory is empty, del works on it as well, doesn't it?

It's luatex, not perltex: lua is the language of choice these days ;-/

    one cannot assume that the program "see" exists on all Unix platforms.

Indeed.  Doesn't exist on mine, for instance :).

Instead of forcing the user to "configure" something (few will), I
suggest having texdoc by default dynamically check along PATH for a
suitable program (see, evince, xpdf, sumatra, whatever).  Of course, if
a specific program is chosen by the user, that should just be used.

I think this single change would make texdoc dramatically more
accessible.  I might even use it myself sometimes :).

Manuel (or anyone), is that something you'd like to work on?

Best,
Karl

    IMO the best place is TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf.

Looks sensible to me, but see below.

    The directory "scripts" should contain the scripts themselves (like
    texmf/scripts).  

Agreed.

    Don't know whether TEXMFHOME/texdoc.cnf is appropriate.  

No config files at the top level of a texmf.

    A site-wide config file doesn't make much sense, except in a
    single-platform environment.  In this case the admin can put it into
    TEXMFLOCAL.

Therefore, the best thing would be to actually look for
$TEXMF/texdoc/texdoc.cnf, where $TEXMF is already defined to be the
standard sequence of trees.  I.e., expand that with kpse and take the
first result.  Or maybe concatenate all results.  

FWIW ...

Oh, I thought texdoc was already doing that.  At home, it works make default
choices that are ok for me (xpdf, xdvi, firefox...)  At work, I have the older
(non-texlua) version and configure things via TEXDOCVIEW_pdf and so on,
because I don't like the defaults (acroread etc).

How do you access the doc atm?  I couldn't live without texdoc myself.

Yep, unless someone else wants to do it before me.  I'll look at the code and

I'd really prefer to concatenate the results.  Imagine you (as a user) want to
change texdoc's viewer (from $TEMFLOCAL/texdoc/texdoc.cnf) for, say pdf.  So
you create $TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf with a single line concerning pdf.
Then if the conf from $TEXMFLOCAL isn't read any more and it was used to
select de correct html viewer, you see changes in html when you change a pdf
setting and you really hate the developers.

Anyway, merging instead of reading just the first one is coherent with other
conf files in TL, like texmf.cnf.

Manuel.

PS : how about putting the alias list we were discussing previously in
texdoc.cnf?

Hi Frank,
os.type() returns either "unix", "windows", or "msdos".

I suppose that on OS/2 it returns "msdos".

OS/2 is collaborative work of IBM and Microsoft.  Microsoft gave it up
when Bill Gates came to the conclusion that a multi-tasking OS is only
good for mainframes, not for personal computers.  But AFAIK the most
commands work on both systems.

 > - What would be useful commands for removing a file or directory on
 >   OS/2?

I don't know why you are so much concerned about OS2 and MSDOG.
None of these systems is maintained anymore for centuries.  There are
no actively maintained TeX distributions for these platforms any more.  

Stupid question: Do the old, unmaintaned TeX distributions for OS/2
and MSDOG provide a texlua engine???  This is essential if you want
to support these systems.  My opinion:  Forget them.

 >   which reflects the settings of the user, e.g. whether (s)he wants

I suppose that Preview is part of OSX and should be used by default on
OSX.  However, it should be possible to switch to AR somehow.

All the non-Adobe PDF engines only support a subset of the PDF
standard.  A user should always be able to make AR the default
browser.

  Reinhard

i got a request (or was it an enquiry) from one of our research groups,
who imagined it would help with some documentation system intended to
take on.  so, somewhere there exists something snaring unwary research
students into its use.

Certainly emTeX is obsolete and dead. Jun Sawataishi prepared another
distribution based upon teTeX and his own tool for porting programs
from Linux. It heavily uses bash scripts and perl scripts, both bash
and perl are ported to OS/2. Jun Sawataishi works on it irregularly
when he thinks that some new version is important for him. I suggested
to him to contact TL developers but he never did, everything is
available from his web site only. Although all his tools are freely
available and their use for compiling TeX is described, I have no time
to do it myself. He did not compile XeTeX and I am afraid that it will
be next to impossible due to lack of support of Unicode in OS/2. One
day Jun Sawataishi may decide that luatex is important but nobody
knows whether it happens.

Hi Karl,
I know many people here in Hannover who are using TeX but only a very
small percentage of them is subscribed to mailing lists or reads
newsgroups.  Even if nobody responds, you can't be sure that nobody
uses it.

    None of the directories listed above is

    and it is correctly found by everything else.

And what is it that is failing?  Just the tex binary?  That doesn't make
sense.  Did the build succeed smoothly?

    >     /export/xtp/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive:

All those /scripts/ entries don't look normal to me, either.

About all I can suggest is to remove kpathsea/paths.h and *.lo in your
build directory and rerun the make.  (Or just do the whole thing from
scratch.)  The DEFAULT_TEXMFCNF definition in paths.h should refer to
$SELFAUTOLOC,$SELFAUTODIR,$SELFAUTOPARENT.  Then the voluminous output of
  tex --kpathsea-debug=-1 null.tex \\end 
should point the way to whatever is causing the problem.  Assuming it
still happens.

Hi

Is there a way to use Metafont fonts with X? Apart from generating them and
converting them to other bitmap formats before using them. I'm thinking about
some way to generate them as needed from the Metafont source, maybe using a font
server.

Is that just a pipe dream? If so, is it because there's no implementation or
because there's no conceivable way to achieve this?

Sorry, I was not clear, I should probably have started a fresh thread.

The build was successful, as far as I can tell. I installed the binaries
into a texlive/2008 tree, where I copied texmf-dist, texmf, texmf-doc. I
ran updmap, fmtutil --all, rebuilt the ls-R database. Tex, (pdf)latex,
etc. work properly. I have not tested xetex, yet. 

The error message I was reporting comes from texdoc. Now, the problem is
that I know nothing about lua, so I'm not sure where to start digging. 

Just to use the hammer, after having had a look at those directories in
the error message, I copied texdoc.tlu from texmf/scripts/texlive
directly into the bin/<arch> directory and simlinked texdoc directly to
it... and it now works.

Even without rebuilding that output looks fine, on first parsing.

     This shouldn't really matter as long as experimental
     hyphenation patterns are installed in TeX Live 2008, by

What do the instructions look like for miktex?  Ordinarily, users don't
have to do anything to enable the patterns at .fmt-dumping time.
(La)TeX-level commands to enable them are distribution independent.  So
I'm not sure any particular instructions are needed.

    If item b is not fixed by, say Wednesday, we'll upload the patterns to
    CTAN anyway (as package german-x).  

Good.  When they show up on CTAN, we'll put them into TL.

    1. Update the oberdiek bundle to contain the new package hyphsubst.

I just saw it come through, TL will be updated momentarily.

      german-x-<date> dehypht-x-<date>.tex
      =german-x-latest
      ngerman-x-<date> dehyphn-x-<date>.tex
      =ngerman-x-latest

Is the -latest really desirable for the generic names, instead of just
german-x and ngerman-x?

    3. Do UTF-8 conversion of the experimental patterns for whatever your
    reasons are.  (I'm not yet acquainted with XeTeX and LuaTeX. :/ )

Mojca/Arthur/Jonathan will deal, I'm sure.

    Is that OK for you?

All seems good to me, thanks.

    I'm thinking about some way to generate them as needed from the

Does the X font server have a way to dynamically create fonts a la
mktexpk? 

All the X font searching I've seen works in the other direction: given a
request for a font foo at some size, it returns the closest existing
font, or scales a scalable font, if available.  But I'm not very well
acquainted with xfs.

    Is that just a pipe dream? If so, is it because there's no
    implementation or

I've never heard of an implementation along these lines, but technically
I don't see any real barriers to running mf, converting the resulting gf
to bdf, and adding it to an X font dir, running mkfontdir, etc.  Or
doing the equivalent through xfs.

There is an ancient archive at ftp://tug.org/tex/bdf-unsupported.tar.gz
with code for converting gf to bdf.  I haven't looked at it in many many
years, but I don't imagine it would be too hard to get running again.

Oh, it's all about texdoc!  Now it makes sense.

texdoc.tlu is in the scripts subdir, and so the SELFAUTO* variable
values are going to reflect that.  Perhaps in Lua the equivalent of $0

The little experiment I made by putting texdoc.tlu into the binary
directory--and getting the expected correct behavior--seems to point in
that direction.

BTW, I built it on Mac OS X as well, and I get the same error from
texdoc.

Hi Frederik, 
you are obviously looking for a solution which creates BDF files (or
whatever X11 understands) directly from metafont sources.  I'm not
aware of such a tool but I think that the amount of time needed to
convert bitmaps is negligible if compared with a metafont run. 

You could try:

  ftp://ftp.nstu.ru/pub/sources/x/fonts/pktobdf.c.gz

I didn't try it myself, but it obviously had been written by honorable
people who are well known in the TeX world.

  pktobdf, adapted from "pktopx in C by Tomas Rokicki" by AJCD 1/8/90

(AJCD = Angus J. C. Duggan, the author of psutils).

If you are interested, the BDF format is well documented, see

  http://www.adobe.com/devnet/font/pdfs/5005.BDF_Spec.pdf 

Regards,
  Reinhard

That's all fine, with one big "but", that but being: the same
language.dat is being read by BOTH pdftex and xetex. So if you want to
put dehyphn-x-<date>.tex into language.dat, the patterns REALLY need
to be XeTeX-compatible, so you need to write a XeTeX wrapper
xu-dehyphn-x-<date>.tex first if you want to do that.

And no - you really do not want to do that. Here you can see examples
of what you might end up with:

  \catcode`\?=7
  % Define the accent macro " in such a way that it
  % expands to single letters in Unicode
  \catcode`\"=13
  \def"#1{\ifx#1a??e4\else \ifx#1o??f6\else \ifx#1u??fc\else
      \errmessage{Hyphenation pattern file corrupted!}%
    \fi\fi\fi}
  %   - patterns with umlauts are ok
  \def\n#1{#1}
  %   - define \3 to be character "00DF (\ss in Unicode)
  \def\3{??df}
  %   - define \9 to throw an error
  \def\9{\errmessage{Hyphenation pattern file corrupted!}}
  %   - duplicated patterns to support font encoding OT1 are not wanted
  \def\c#1{}
  %
  \let\PATTERNS=\patterns
  \def\patterns{% at the \patterns command in dehypht.tex...
    \endgroup % end group containing local definitions from dehypht
    \begingroup % and start our own (to match \endgroup in dehypht)
    %
    \PATTERNS % and then load the real patterns
  }

It sounds fine to me to use your patterns by default when XeTeX loads
"normal" german patterns.

If you're providing additional packages for pdf(La)TeX, it's probably
helpful for the user, and that doesn't concern the process of pattern
conversion to utf-8. If someone writes a packages, go forward. XeTeX
may load additional language that it's not really going to use.

(XeTeX also loads Greek patterns in ibycus encoding. They're of no use
of course, but they're at least harmless.)

-------

A summary: please, please, please ... do take a look at

1.) svn://tug.org/texhyphen/trunk/tex/loadhyph/loadhyph-xx.tex (german
is not the best example, take a look at "sl" instead; also the file
will probably change - it's autogenerated anyway)
and
2.) svn://tug.org/texhyphen/trunk/tex/patterns/utf8/lang-de-1996.tex
for an example of what we would really like to see: plain patterns,
utf-8 encoded, no catcodes, no lccodes, no TeX macros

With two languages that goal was unavoidable, and with languages such
as german & french, I do not dare changing anything as it would break
compatibility with OT1-encoded fonts.

The overall scheme, locations, comments ... all that might change, but
the idea is to split content (patterns themselves) from intepretation
(adapting them for xetex or pdftex that uses T1 or T2A encoding,
depending on needs).

And for the sake of that, it would be really helpful to submit "clean"
files. Definitely I can write a script to convert your patterns into
the proper format, but I guess that you would want updates to happen
automatically whenever you update your patterns, not waiting for
someone else to write you a new wrapper script and submit it to the
proper location.

The code in the luatex TRUNK initializes a lua variable named

    os.selfdir

which is the directory where luatex's executable resides, with
symlinks resolved. This code is not yet in the 0.25.3 that is
on texlive.

If that would help (of which I am not sure), I can do a backport
of that functionality to texlive (but only if it would actually
help, of course)

Jonathan wrote those files. I have no idea how to create new files of
the same kind as he did, but it's rather straightforward to write them
if patterns are known to be in UTF-8 and if the target 8-bit encoding
is known (for German that's EC/T1).

So - we're ready to assist with that part. But we need clean patterns
in the first place.

It neither complicates nor simplifes them. But one needs to take some
patterns for XeTeX. And those some could either be the old ones or
yours. I guess that it's "forbiden" to change the patterns for pdfTeX,
but if new patterns are better - why not using them in XeTeX where
"you-need-to-be-backward-compatible-with-20-years-old-hacks" is not
really an issue? (Fonts need to change from EC to OpenType, so one
cannot be backward compatible with the old TeX line breaks anyway.)

without cryptic xu- files: yes
without any wrapper: no (might be possible in future, but not right now)

Unless language.dat and its functionality is extended, you need to
load some wrapper which detects the engine and acts accordingly, but
the wrapper is really easy to create. If you have some TeX/babel guru
that knows how to do the following:


in luanguage.dat one would have:

german-x-<date> load-new-german-patterns.tex % would be some other name
=german-x-latest

and then load-new-german-patterns.tex would have access to the
language name, so - it would know that user supplied german-x-<date>
as the language name and could then load its own macros +
hyph-de-x-<date>.tex

then you don't need to do anything else, but only change the pattern date.

Hmmm ... I hope Karl is not listening to this ...
(I wash my hands concerning support to the new german patterns in that
way - I'm not guilty for anything :)


If you really want to hear my opinion: I'm pretty sure that:
- you will rather soon change your mind about the best way of
implementation of these patterns; if nothing else, there's a need to
improve language.dat anyway - converting the patterns to unicode was
only the first step towards this
- if users start using dated patterns now, you will soon need to
provide dozens of megabytes to keep backward compatibility (and I bet
that the new dated version will only differ in maybe three or four
patterns), and if you change the way or strategy - will you keep those
dozens of megabytes for the sake of not even a dozen of users or are
you going to let them down by not providing that file in the
distribution any more, and thus breaking the documents?
- we're ready to put some hacks into new patten loading scheme; after
all - german patterns are already an exception, and if you can tell us
how to figure out if user requested new patterns, we can load new ones
instead of the old ones
- I would vote for putting only a single version of patterns on TeX
Live, but if users want to experiment with dated versions outside of
the release, they should be free to do so (if they had to fiddle
themselves, they will at least know what to do if that breaks in the
next release of TeX Live)
- TeX Live is going to provide packages with updates, so you can
implement upgrades and ship new patterns also after the official
realease
- keep in mind that other languages are upgrading patterns as well; if
you're providing a way to change patterns based on version, it would
be nice if you would release the scheme once it would be clear how
other languages can benefit from it as well, or how other languages
can do the same - but it's the wrong timing to get that done before TL
2008

I would vote for:
- some basic support for new patterns (with a big warning sign - use
at your own risk), to be able to get user feedback
- developing extensive support for any versioned-or-whatever-stuff
after TeX Live is out
But to be honest, I do not know the details of your work. I only
suspect that anything you will do now will very soon be a bit obsolete
(not the patterns themselves, but the way of loading them in some
hackish way).

> (BTW, does the same apply to LuaTeX?)

Just forget about LuaTeX for the moment.
- LuaLaTeX is still useless even if it's going to be shipped on TeX Live
- ConTeXt (the only one where LuaTeX is useful) has its own patterns
and pattern loading mechanisms, not even considering the fact that
LuaTeX support on TeX Live will probably be obsolete by the time when
DVDs are sent to members :P :)
- LuaTeX can load patterns at runtime, and it's quite possible that
the hyph-foo.tex files that you see in svn will be preprocessed to
generate even cleaner pattern files (one pattern per line, no
\patters{} macro, no comments, etc.)

But the poor man that wrote a thesis, wrote it a year ago at most (to
those who used it in 2004 the adjective does not apply). And those who
go for XeTeX, go for the better, and do not care too much if a line
will be broken slightly better. If they convert old documents, they
won't be broken in the same way as they were in the old document
anyway.

I might be wrong, but I guess that most XeTeX users would vote for the
new patterns.

Do hyphsubst any polyglossia know for each other? (Babel doesn't work
in XeTeX, polyglossia is babel replacement.) I have no idea what
hyphsubst does.

PS: You probably do not want to break backward compatibility (with a
not-yet-very-well-tested package hyphsubst, that might still change in
future) to the users to whom you have promised it (saying that they
may load a specific hyphenation file that will not change).

Hello,

I forgot to add a tiny note about backward-compatibility of the new
scheme of loading patterns.

- functionality should not not change (except that new german patterns
would be loaded for XeTeX, and that we have fixed some "bugs" where
XeTeX did not load the old patterns properly; we might have introduced
some new ones though?)

- patterns were converted into UTF-8, but they should stay that way
"forever" unless pattern creator wants to upload a new version and if
country (language) fellows do not prohibit him to do that; the naming
scheme of languages conforms to RFC4646; we did not account for
pattern versions though

- pattern loading macros might change and will change, but it's a
matter of changing a few lines in a generating script, and it's in
full control - users should not bother about that *at all*

So - authors are supposed to care that patterns are ok, while the team
behind TeX Live should care that loading them works properly. We will
try to convince authors to modify the new files in future.

Mojca

PS: old files will remain on TeX Live (users might depend on them),
but they won't be used when generating formats.

That doesn't hold.  The experimental patterns could be removed any time
without harm.  Using old or new patterns as standard in XeTeX makes no
difference for that reason.  What's chosen now has to be kept forever.
Well, I've made a tiny poll at the trennmuster-opensource list about
this question and let you know about our consensus.

ACK.  Please consider hyphsubst experimental, too.  Adding this to TeX
Live 2008 shouldn't harm, but instead give other language pattern
generators the opportunity to test it.  In the long run, I'd really like
to see something like that integrated into Babel.

ACK.  As it now looks to me, experimental hyphenation patterns do not
necessarily need to be added to language.dat by default (for pdfTeX).
If it is possible for TL's package management to activate them at
request, a simple package would do as well.  And nobody should complain
in the future if these patterns are removed from TL again.

As for XeTeX, we might possibly switch to the new patterns now, but I'll
let you know about the poll.

Hyphsubst is not that much of a hack.  The basic idea is to provide a
LaTeX front-end for replacing

  \l@<language name>

with different patterns.  It looks to me as if Babel was written with
this level of abstraction already in mind (but I don't know).  The rest
is the

  dehyphn-x-<date>

naming convention.  I hope something like that will be possible with
XeTeX & Polyglossia, too.  That way, the question what patterns are
bound to a language name by default is not so important any more.  Could
anyone please clarify that?

That's not entirely true, I believe. AFAIK Babel works OK in xelatex  
for many languages, particularly the Latin-script ones, but becomes  
more problematic once we get into non-Latin scripts.

Polyglossia is intended to be a replacement (or at least the  
beginnings of one), designed for the Unicode world, but for the time  
being there are plenty of xelatex users using Babel successfully.

You mean, replacing "see" by something sensible?  Of course that should
be done; it's just a leftover from the times when I didn't bother about
portability and instead had to struggle with the basic code, and simply
put in the usual Debian commands ("see" for all types of files).

I'm surprised that no one has complained so far, is no one using it
except Debian users?

I'm open to co-maintainance. The TeXLive repository is the upstream
repository at the moment, I have not other development copies anywhere -
just go ahead.

I am not completely sure whether it was jadetex or xmltex, but one of
which we once tried to simply remove from Debian, because the
non-TeXLive package was so buggy. But then we got unfriendly reports,
because quite some packages needed it to build their documentation.

I can't say whether these were actively developped packages, though.

texlive.tlpdb? Isn't that just the database used for selection and
installation of TeXLive packages? Why should it use that - that would
restrict its use to packages installed that way, whereas now it can also
show you locally installed and even user-specific stuff.

And it's a lot faster with luatex than it used to be as a shell script.

texdoc -s geometry | grep pdf does just the same. 

Would you like to have a --format=pdf option?

Completely agreed. 

Although, if we would have a texlua library for accessing the
texlive.tlpdb it would be possible to search in addition to the simple
names also for packages, and even descriptions of the doc files, since
the doc files *can* be tagged with language and description items in the
tlpdb, e.g.:
	 texmf-dist/doc/latex/a0poster/a0.pdf details="Package documentation (German)" language="de"

We don't want to get rid of the current way it works, but it could in addition
use texlive.tlpdb to get info from the catalogue, eg that gemoetry's user
manual is in texmf-dist/doc/latex/geometry/manual.pdf. Currently it returns a
page from the TeX academy in my TL'08 installation: hardly what you would
expect as a user.

Yes. But my point was, a user shouldn't need to do such things to access a
package's main documentation in most cases. The -s options sometimes gives
quite big output, and most normal users will just give up at this point.

Maybe it can be useful to combine with the -s option, especially for users who
don't have (windoz) or don't know how to use grep.

    I am not completely sure whether it was jadetex or xmltex, but one of

They both are the same, as far as format building goes.  Both require
&latex.  (And pdfjadetex and pdfxmltex require &pdflatex.)

If that causes a bug for some reason, we can fix it to not require the
formats (and not build any fancy dependency stuff into fmtutil either),
but just \input the right files in the right cases.  Necessary or not?

I can imagine that it is, since jadetex precedes latex alphabetically,
and that is how they are listed in fmtutil.cnf now, and if fmtutil --all
just proceeds in order ... however, Norbert/Staszek/others have been
testing the new fmtutil.cnf for quite some time now and haven't
complained.  So what's the story, guys :)?

    because quite some packages needed it to build their documentation.

Ok, good to know.  I wasn't seriously planning to remove them, anyway.

    I can't say whether these were actively developped packages, though.

Not that I've seen.  For quite a few years.

I probably should have included that a missfont.log is generated with:

mktextfm bbold11

but evidently there is a problem when this is executed because when

Subject: [tex-live] bbold 11pt fonts
Message-ID: <20080611082800.GB770@abutilon>

Dear TeX-Live-rs/teTeX-ers

One of my favourite font packages is bbold ... I like my blackboard bold
in sans-serif, and I have been using it quite happily on teTeX systems.

I have a particular environment I use for solutions, that sets the solution
of a maths problem below the problem itself in \small font. This means that
with a 12pt document, I'm often calling upon an 11pt sized font within my
solutions environment.

Now this has worked fine for years under teTeX, but now under tex-live
(I install the packages via apt-get under ubuntu (which uses the Debian
package system)), it's complaining about missing .tfm files of the
appropriate size.

Does anyone know what's amiss? ... how to fix it? Is it something missing in
tex-live? .... or the ubuntu packaging? ... or might it possibly be due to
finding residual teTeX stuff that's confusing the tex-live stuff, so that
it's the right place?

Is this an FAQ?

  Regards,
  Greg Gamble

Thanks to Laurent's prompt response we can close this problem. New
packages with a license statement of LPPL are on CTAN and in the TeX
Live repository, and the next version of the texlive-base and
texlive-extra packages will ship these files, too.

Thanks a lot to all who have contributed.

Best wishes

Which version of texlive-fonts-extra and of texlive-base (latex-base)?

The problem is that (not only the Debian packages, but also TeX Live)
shipped two files ubbold.fd and Ubbold.fd. The former taking precedence
but being wrong.

If you have
	texlive-latex-base or texlive-base release << 2007-14
then your best way to fix it to remove the file yourself:
as root
	rm /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/jknapltx/ubbold.fd
	mktexlsr

That should work. From texlive-base 2007-14 onward this file is not
shipped anymore.

See Debian bug report #449221 (bugs.debian.org/449221)

Yes, but you'll have to write the code.

The X Font Server wire protocol is relatively simple.  It would not be
too dificult to write a server which serves the mf fonts.

Choose a mode from modes.mf and a dpi, have the server call mf to
generate pk fonts in the standard location for that mode/dpi tuple.

You font server would advertize and serve any such fonts.

I'd strongly suggest having it support only the mf fonts; xfs(1x)
from the Xorg dist can handle any fonts libXfont handles.  There is
no problem having multiple font servers, each on its own tcp port.

Note, however, that IME mf doesn't do so great a job with the CM
derrived fonts at 100dpi or less.  I tried it out for that some
time back and gave up given the lack of legibility.

Good luck and Happy Coding!

My guess is that the X font machinery doesn't really have all the
capabilities needed to
support maths layout, so it may not be enought just to get bitmaps.

Now that Display PS is officially gone <http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ChangesSince68>,
you may want to look at the successors based on Xrender. Quoting from.
 <http://dps.sourceforge.net/>:

------ begin quote
At the time when I started this project, there was no decent rendering
interface for X11 other than DPS.

Since then, there has been a large amount of work on a simple and
clean X server extension, Xrender, which provides the basis for just
such an interface.

Rendering libraries that are being built above Xrender include:

    * Xft, a font rendering library built on FreeType;
    * Cairo, formerly Xr/Xc, a geometry rendering library that
provides PostScript-like rendering primitives but with intrinsic
support for Porter-Duff compositing (transparency);
    * Pango, a high-level typesetting library.

If your application uses DPS, please consider porting it to the above
libraries.
 ------- end quote

I think because much of the effort that went into X11R7 was aimed at
supporting m18n,
(so wide fonts, flexible layout), there is little interest in the
original X11 font technology.

I have just made a (pretty large) commit with the sources of context,
release 2008.05.21. I don't know how to update the packaging system,
so instead, here is an explanation of what has changed in the file
layout compared to last year.

There are 4 completely new directories with files in them:

   fonts/misc/cid/fontforge
   fonts/misc/fea/context
   fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/context
   tex/context/test

One directory is removed:

   fonts/maps/dvipdfm/context

There are 6 new scripts, split into win32 and unix variants:

    scripts/context/stubs/win32/context.cmd
    scripts/context/stubs/win32/luatools.cmd
    scripts/context/stubs/win32/mtxrun.cmd
    scripts/context/stubs/win32/pdftrimwhite.bat
    scripts/context/stubs/win32/texfind.bat
    scripts/context/stubs/win32/texshow.bat

    scripts/context/stubs/unix/context
    scripts/context/stubs/unix/luatools
    scripts/context/stubs/unix/mtxrun
    scripts/context/stubs/unix/pdftrimwhite
    scripts/context/stubs/unix/texfind
    scripts/context/stubs/unix/texshow

That's all (I hope).

Best wishes,
Taco

I forgot to 'svn add' this directory because of an svn ignore on

Both should exist, my bad.

Definately not, they are not documentation, but small input files
that can be used when a bit of ad-hoc text is needed.

Yes, they were in bin already, except for the 6 new ones.

So should the new ones be also moved to bin/xxx/ and why keeping them in
two places (bin/ and scripts/) ?

Necessary or not, it's not that simple when the format is included in a
Debian package separate from LaTeX. But it doesn't make much sense to
discuss that now: I'm sure I would have to take more time than I can
currently spare to read through the old bug reports in order to
understand all of it, let alone explain the details. On the other hand,
we do have an acceptable solution, in our script to merge individual
format-providing packages' files into fmtutil.cnf:

# do_not_include_snippet_that_depends_on_a_not_included_snippet <file path>
do_not_include_snippet_that_depends_on_a_not_included_snippet()
{
    file="$1"

    cat >>"$tempfile" <<EOF

$CC$CC
$CC$CC$CC $file not included because it depends
$CC$CC$CC on another file that is not included here. For instance, jadetex and
$CC$CC$CC xmltex snippets are not included in fmtutil.cnf when the snippet for
$CC$CC$CC LaTeX isn't included itself. This is because the jadetex and xmltex
$CC$CC$CC formats need the LaTeX format when being built (see bug #427562).
$CC$CC
EOF

It only happens when you have separate packages, plus the peculiarities
that arise when you separate unpacking and configuration as Debian does.

Ah, okay - now I got the point. Yes, that would be a good idea. The -s
option would:

Yes, something like that. I'll probably try to implement that after this
year's release, concentrating on fixing the urgent problems (kpse breakage on
Solaris & Mac, default programs...) and we can discuss the details at this
moment. I'd very much like to make an option that searches in the descriptions
too, like searching on ctan, but localy it could be faster and more convenient.

I suspect they are copied, not moved. That is in fact one of the reasons
why I posted a message instead of attempting something myself: I do not
know how to handle them in texlive. Of course they need to be in the bin
directory at the user side, but how that is handled is not clear to me.

These files should definitely end in bin, but I see no harm if they're
left at their original location, they don't even sum up to 1kb, and
they're part of every ConTeXt zip.

I know some users have added that folder to their PATH. Of course that
is not needed any more on a modern distribution, but it makes no sense
to make complications because of these tiny files. All that's needed
is to copy them to bin and package ConTeXt properly.

Right.  We put them into the /source/ tree, so that when all the various
arch builders run their make, it ends up in the bin dir that gets
committed.

In other words, I'll take care of it :).  (And the *.tlpsrc files; it
will take a little time.)

That's OK. No objections. We understand better now, so thanks for

Sounds all nice, but misses the tlpdb reading code in texlua. If I would
have time I would *love* to write these kind of thing, but alas, not
atm. That is for next year.

luatools and mtxrun should not be called using kpse (actually in a 
minimal setup there is not even an kpsewhich and friends needed)

luatools and mtxrun are used with luatex/context mkiv which does not use 
kpse at all and they are self contained scripts (updating can be done 
with luatools --selfupdate and mtxrun --selfupdate)

also using kpsewhich as locator would also sacrifice speed since then 
the lsr databases need to be loaded etc etc which in a normal mkiv run 
is not needed; for mkiv luatools == kpsewhich++ and mtxrun == texmfstart

the same is true for a luatex/context run ... it doesn't use kpse

the other scripts that come with context mkiv (mtx-blabla.lua) are run 
indirectly with "mtxrun --script blabla <rest of arguments)" which is 
another reason why mtxrun is its own stub; the only shortcut there is 
currently the "context" command which is "mtxrun --script context <other 
arguments>" and the prefered way of running context mkiv (it then 
replaces texexec -- for instance index sorting and such takes place 
inside tex itself)

so, to summarize:

on windows:

stubs: luatools.cmd mtxrun.cmd context.cmd, they launch the related lua 
scripts in the same path)

on unix:

stubs: context (calls mtxrun ...)
renamed scripts: luatools and mtxrun
or also stubs: luatools and mtxrun that call lua script in same path

Message-ID: <22af238a0806130455x5133b11du73cf148d94a30626@mail.gmail.com>

I did a test install on a OS X Leopard 10.5.3.

OS X doesn't appear to provide wget -- I used macports.  It is
possible some other tools used by the scripts also came from macports.


Using a relatively robust internet connection at work, but there are
still problems connecting to the mirrors;  install-tl dumped me out
numerous times:

./install-tl
[...]

Enter command: I
Installing: 12many
Downloading http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev//tlpkg/12many.source.tar.lzma
did not succeed, please retry! at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 732,
<STDIN> line 8.

This issue with connections to mirror sites seems to be one of those
famous unsolved problems -- if you find a good solution, please let
the Fedora linux
people know!

Each time I have to go thru the configuration menus (or figure out how
to put the selections on the command line).  Either I forgot to set
the papersize on the
last iteration or the setting was not honored, as I'm getting A4 pdfs
when I asked for letterpaper.

Running "texconfig paper letter" and rebuilding formats fixed this for
pdftex, but not xetex:

nashi:TL2008 gwhite$ texconfig-sys paper letter
texconfig: updated configuration saved as file
`/opt/tex/texlive/2008-test/texmf-config/dvips/config/config.ps'
texconfig: updated configuration saved as file

texconfig: updated configuration saved as file
`/opt/tex/texlive/2008-test/texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex'


There is a luatools stub script but no luatools.lua (hopefully this
will be solved with a context update).
Meanwhile, many context users (those with internet access) will do
"ctxtools --updatecontext" -- this gave me a luatools.lua in
texmf-local.

Thanks for all the good work!

Sorry, I was thinking about TL as a whole.  ConTeXt
stubs are certainly a step in the right direction, and be an
example for other scripts to follow.

The heart of the problem is ensuring that what gets into
bin/<arch> will do right things.   I see ConTeXt as a worst-case
example (lots of scripts, lots of changes), but that is
probably because I haven't considered tex4ht.  Currently
TL2008 uses symbolic links for scripts, which has drawbacks:

1) it sprinkles executable files through the texmf trees.

2) it misses newer versions installed to, e.g., texmf-local
or $HOME/texmf

In the past we have situations where a top-level script is
called and finds subroutines relative to the location of the
top-level script, so the proper target of a symbolic link
after an update may change even when the script at the
end of the link has not.

Some sites mount the texmf trees  with noexec, some scan
for ordinary files with  execute permissions.   In those cases,
symbolic links into texmf trees can't be used for scripts.  TL
needs to be suitable as a replacement for teTeX, which was
careful not to break such configurations.  In practice,
I guess many of these issues are dealt with by the linux
packagers, who tend to put executables in /usr/bin.

When I run ctx-tools --updatecontext, I end up with
new scripts in texmf-local (including some of which don't
exist in the original directory).

Using kpsewhich in TL would ensure that scripts are
found according to the TL (e.g., kpathsea) rules, which
may differ from the ways scripts are found by a
particular interpreter (e.g., lua), but also different
from the fixed symbolic links TL2008 is using.


In TL2007, copies of scripts were put in bin/<arch>, as
was done for teTeX.  TL2008 has many links into the texmf tree:

There are far too many files with execute permissions (this
was also true for TL2007):

TL2008 complete:
$ find ./texmf-dist -type f -perm -100 | wc -l
     864

TL2007 (MacTeX)
$ find /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist -type f -perm -100 | wc -l
     749

The vast majority of these files aren't scripts.

The security issues with searching for scripts are a bit
different from just putting the script in the bin directory,
but a) there will still be scripts taken from the texmf
trees, and b) if you are using TeX in an environment
where security is an issue you need to be careful
about everything in texmf trees.

In the short term, it would be nice to follow the
ConTeXt example and have stub scripts in their
own directory so that it is easy to see what should be
copied or linked (according to site policy).

Hi George,
I'm not familiar with the OS X at all.  As far as I understand,
macports and fink are extensions to OS X which make free software
available.  If this is true, we can't rely on them.

It's quite late for big changes in TeX Live, but if there is a native
command-line tool provided by OS X which does the same as wget and you
are willing to do some tests, maybe the installer and getnonfreefonts
could use it.  If not, (or if it can't be done easily) I prefer the
following solution:

If someone provides a wget binary for OS X, we can do this:

  * The wget binary will be put into the directory on the server which
    contains the network installer.

  * The files README.OSX.html and index.html will be provided.

  * The getnonfreefonts man page will contain a link to README.OSX.html,
    you can't use getnonfreefonts without internet access anyway.

If you don't remember whether you enabled letter paper in the
installer menu, just try 

  grep letter /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/texlive.profile

BTW, you told us some time ago that you have to install TeX Live on
many machines.  We decided to make your life easier.  After you
installed TeX Live on one machine you can copy texlive.profile to your
USB stick and can install TL in batch mode on other machines:

   install-tl -profile /media/usb/texlive.profile

The program which changes paper sizes is derived from Thomas'
texconfig.  It changes entries in config files.  I don't see any
config file for xetex in the texmf tree.  If anybody tells me what is
needed for xetex, I'll add support.

Message-ID: <200806140131.m5E1VM922101@f7.net>

For those who are willing to test TeX Live 2008, at this point we
would welcome your help!  

Probably the best way is new this year: download the small bootstrap
installer, as explained on
ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev/README

Despite the name, it's an HTML file and hopefully your browser will
render it as such.  There are some links in there to the archives.
This will use a "nearby" CTAN host for the actual downloads.

The traditional ISO image is also being built, although that is over 1gb
even in its lzma-compressed form, and is only available from tug.org.
So please skip that unless you have a really strong desire to try it --
but if you do, ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/README explains more.

(As mentioned previously, this year we are only making the "live" image
for DVD; no compressed versions, no CD's.  Just doesn't fit.)

The TeX Live documentation (live.pdf) and the top-level README's have
not been updated (at all) yet.  Sorry.  The installer has been
completely reimplemented, but looks nearly identical to previous years.
Hopefully it will be easy enough to try out.

Please send bug reports here, tex-live at tug.org.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. Next I will be working on making it available in tarball form,
since that is what will work best for the GNU/Linux distro maintainers.

I should have mentioned that if you have a copy of the TL development
repository (via any of the methods at http://tug.org/texlive/svn/), you
can test installation simply by doing
  cd Master
  install-tl
  
Or install-tl.bat on Windows.

(The ISO image is in fact simply a copy of the Master/ tree.)


Also, the top-level tl-portable[.bat] script is another thing to test,
if you're interested.  That is our attempt at running TL from media,
without installing anything.  I admit I haven't yet tried that one
myself :).

Best,
karl

P.S. I updated http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html with some of this info.

 KB> Please send bug reports here, tex-live at tug.org.

not a bug report but some todo reminder.

1) some platform binaries were created from slightly outdated sources.

2) coverage:

* i386-openbsd lacks synctex, and its lzma binaries in
  Master/tlpkg/installer/lzma/ are not stripped.

* amd64-freebsd misses 5 xindy-related binaries (note that i386-freebsd
  has xindy). i think we fixed freebsd build problems so whoever is
  building on amd64-freebsd could try again. when building clisp on
  freebsd, the trick is to make "make" be a gnu make, if you're building
  with gmake:

test -d ~/bin || mkdir ~/bin
cp -p /usr/local/bin/gmake ~/bin/make
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

  the problem which required this workaround is already fixed in clisp
  cvs tree, but it is needed with 2.45 and earlier clisp versions.

* i386-darwin and powerpc-darwin have no pdfopen ane pdfclose (which was
  already discussed last year so it is ok), have macos-specific
  additions (T1Wrap and xdv2pdf), and lack xindy.
  i successfully built xindy on i386-darwin (10.4) but there the
  ffcall library is buggy and xindy crashes.
  i think that on powerpc-darwin there should be more chances to get a
  working xindy because it is older than i386 and ffcall may work there.

* mips-irix has not yet been rebuilt and contains outdated binaries

* hppa-hpux has no luatex and no xindy.

* win32 has many differences which don't seem to be dictated by platform
  specifics. e.g. why does win32 have vlna.exe? or teckit_compile.exe?
  (this is just an example). we have them in the source tree but they
  are not installed on unix.  why they are installed on woe32?

Best,
v.

I'll remove vlna.exe. I think you had better install teckit_compile
on Unix.

I think, there shouldn't be test files like `test.tex'
below TDS:tex/. There should go either in TDS:doc/ or
TDS:source/.

Example: texmf-dist/tex/plain/vertex/ with
  test.tex, fntest.tex, vntest.tex, jepcont.tex

Also the documentation isn't generated, only the source
is available in
  texmf-dist/doc/plain/vertex/vertex.doc
Run `pdftex test.doc' to get `vertex.pdf'.

Correct.  But users will get a 2nd chance with MacTeX.  My guess is that
the vast majority of users who will be installing TL2008 will either already
have wget (I have it from macports but also in a large 3rd party system)
or won't mind compiling it themselves.

My time is quite limited, but I will fit in as much testing as I can.  My big
concern is that there may be other tools from macports that were used.
Ideally, installers should run under a stripped down PATH so you only
use the vendor's versions of the tools.

I think you will have to say something along the lines:

"The installer requires that you have a working wget on your system.
If wget is not already installed on your system, you can  use one of
the 3rd party toolkits such as macports or fink., or you can build wget
from the GNU sources at:

 <http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/>

Note that you will need the Apple Xcode developer tools to compile
wget.   In the future we hope to add support for the curl utility."

In the long run:

OS X, being of the BSD inclination, provides curl, so it would be
best if the scripts can use either wget or curl.   I've seen times when
curl worked "better" than wget, and curl shows up in places where
wget is not found (see: <http://daniel.haxx.se/docs/curl-vs-wget.html>
Updated: May 19, 2008 ).  Also of interest:

<http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2029.html> "This Technical
Note was created for application developers interested in writing software
that is compatible with Mac OS X. "

Apple still has instructions and sources for building wget: (from an early
version of OS X) at <http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.0/>

Nice.  Thank you (actually, I what I generally do is one install with all
platforms selected, add local tweaks, rsync the whole tree to the
other systems, and delete extraneous bin/<arch> directories if
space is tight).   We tend to have a development workstation with
a full set of tools, and production machines with the bare minimum
tools.

I was assuming this would be sorted by now, but perhaps not.  The
advantage of getting older and forgetful and doing installs when I'm
too tired for things that require a sharp mind is that I see things
more like a first time user.

What is needed for xetex?  Documentation would be the first priority.

MiKTeX has:

xetex.1, XeTeX-reference.pdf and tug2003.pdf

TL svn seems to have only
 Build/source/texk/xdvipdfmx/doc/tug2003.pdf

There is:

\special{pdf:pagesize width 8in height 11in}

which can be set (from xetex.1 in miktex) using:

xetex --papersize=string ...

I assume this just adds a pdf:pagesize special for xdvipdfmx, but
none of this is suitable for a system-wide configuration.

[ I have miktex installed via wine on linux so I can make sure
things I do in linux will also work for the miktex users, but I'm finding
that the miktex documentation is often better organized and more
complete]

  * I don't understand "ge". Either use "german" or the

    The first two letters of the language name must not be used,
    this would lead to clashes. For instance, what would be "sl":
    "slovak" or "slovenian".
  * I don't understand the mess. Either use the full language
    name or the two letter code, but not both.

* texmf-doc/doc/czechslovak/
  Isn't Slovak a different language? Should the directory be named "czech"
  or similar?

* Source files should go to texmf-doc/source/
  korean/lshort-korean/lshort-kr-src.tar.gz

* Also I don't understand the purpose of texmf-doc at all.
  README says:

  | This tree (texmf-doc) is for self-contained "pure" documentation, that

  But it contains, for instance:
    amsldoc-vn (amsmath has many files in the other trees)
    ntheorem-vn (ntheorem has files in other trees)
    mpman-ru (metapost ...)
    ...

  Why not merge it in texmf-dist/doc/? TDS says

  | The TDS reserves the following category names:
 ?| * general, for standalone documents not specific to any particular
  |   program (for example, Joachim Schrod's Components of TEX ).
  | * help, for meta-information, such as FAQ's, the TEX Catalogue, etc.
  | ...

  The FAQs could go in texmf-dist/doc/help/<language or usergrp ...>/...
  lshort could go in texmf-dist/doc/general/lshort/<language>/...

* How a user is supposed to find a translation for his language?
  "LANG=de texdoc lshort" finds the English version.
  The German version is in german/lshort-german/l2kurz.pdf
  It is quite annoying to search all texmf*/doc trees manually.

Definitely Slovak.

But if you want to support language-specific searches (like LANG=sl),
you probably need a list of language names (pairs of language_code,
language_name). Then, if someone wants "de" for example, you know that
you need to look into subfolder of texmf-doc/doc/german

i've long wondered about "ge".

except that it's the iso code for slovenian; for slovak the iso code is
"sk".

i would favour using the iso codes -- creating a new set would add
further confusion (of the sort introduced by "ge=>german" -- "ge" isn't
an iso code).

however, changing the lot now sounds to me like a big project; sorting
out ctan, alone, will take a good long time.

Ah, yes. That might also be possible if texdoc parses texlive.tlpdb. But
that's not going to happen for TeXLive 2008, unless someone writes a lua
parser for that file for me.

Message-ID: <200806142101.m5EL1ms23531@f7.net>

    textures.def is missing (option textures for packages color, graphics, ...)

It was missing in 2007, too (and there have been zero bug reports about
it).  When the LaTeX team dropped the historical .def files (a good
decision IMHO), it became illegal to distribute:

...
%% This code may be distributed only as part of
%% the full Blue Sky Research LaTeX distribution or as part of
%% the Standard LaTeX `Graphics Bundle'.

(I researched these various files at the time, there was a thread about
it.  Not that I have a url handy.)

Anyway, if you have a version that is free, I'll take it.  But
supporting textures is not a priority for TeX Live and I'm not going to
spend any time on it.

Thanks,
karl

     ho> * I don't understand the mess. 

It is historical and must be fixed in cooperation with the original
authors and CTAN.  TL's (main) job is to copy packages from CTAN.
Changing package names is highly undesirable and I don't want to do it.
(The packages which are named differently now are a source of constant
irritation and should be fixed, in the fullness of time.)

    rf> i've long wondered about "ge".

Me too.  I didn't invent it, I inherited it.  If the German
documentation translators agree (I'll ask), we can change texlive-ge to
texlive-de.  However, FAQ-ge needs to be renamed on CTAN, and I don't
know who, if anyone, owns it these days.

    ho> * Source files should go to texmf-doc/source/
          korean/lshort-korean/lshort-kr-src.tar.gz

In the case of texmf-doc, I see nothing to be gained by splitting up the
packages.

    * Also I don't understand the purpose of texmf-doc at all.

Fabrice invented it.  As I recall, the main point was to have at least
some doc separated by language.

I can't argue that it is an absolutely necessary concept, but I don't
see that it's going to hurt anything to keep it, and changing it right
now would be extremely time-consuming, so I don't want to do it.

     But it contains, for instance:

All the instances you cite are maintained independently of the main
package and are, in fact, pure documentation.

    * How a user is supposed to find a translation for his language?

There is no good way and never has been.  Sorry.  Always more work to be
done ...

Hi Heiko,

    I have written a quick&dirty&writeonly Perl script for
    checking the unique constraints of TDS for TDS:tex.

Yep, I've been running your last incarnation of that script :), and
we've written some new ones too.  Yes, there are plenty of problems,
most of them longstanding.  I wouldn't expect we can fix them all now.

I wonder, can you easily run it on TL 2007 and send me those too?  I'd
be most concerned about avoiding introducing *new* conflicts.  (And I
know we have.)

Thanks,
k

Not definitely. Currently you don't know whether `sl' is a
two letter ISO country code or a two letter abbreviation
of the language name.

Therefore I strongly suggest to get rid of the
two letter abbreviations at least and to replace them
by the two letter ISO country codes in order to get
unique two letter codes.

In the long term we should have an easier way.
For example. The German `lshort' is named `lkurz', but I doubt
someone wants to maintain a list of translations for lshort.
Thus there should be a symbol link that can be guessed
with `lshort' and 'de' without `german' or `kurz'.

They are, texhash is a symbol link to mktexlsr (bin/i386-linux).
But the program isn't that nice to me today. :-(

I just did a Build from TL svn (on a lnux system at home), and
noticed:

$ grep 'a4' inst/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg
%% papersize-spec is 'paper-format' or length-pair, e.g., 'a4', 'letter',
p  a4

My Master tree has a bunch of them.

    I think you had better install teckit_compile on Unix.

Excuse my ignorance, but what is it?  And where are the sources?

We're talking about languages, so we should use the language codes
(not country codes), i.e. ISO 639-3 (e.g. deu, slk, slv), or IETF
language tags.

I took it from SIL and compiled successfully both on i386 and x86_64.
Maybe Jonathan could import the sources to TL svn. However, I am
afraid that everything is dynamically linked.

it is already imported: Build/source/libs/teckit

Yes, you are right: language codes are the right term (I meant the codes
used in LANG (LANG=de ...) or in Java's Locale(String language)).

> (not country codes), i.e. ISO 639-3 (e.g. deu, slk, slv), or IETF

I found the following list:

http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php

* Three letter codes require more changes for TL.
* Sometimes there are more than one three letter variant
  for a language.
* I doubt that we will have translations in so many languages
  that we need three letter codes.

Therefore I suggest the two letter codes (of ISO 639-1).

    In project latex-tds I provide a tds.pdf with bookmarks and links.

Ok, I installed it.  (By hand, since integrating this with our normal
update process would be quite a project for little gain.)

    Also source and doc files are divided properly:

As I mentioned earlier, I don't see any point in those divisions within
texmf-doc.  (Actually I see little point to splitting up source and doc
anywhere, since they generally require each other to be useful, but I'm
not going to change it now, in either direction, in any tree.)

Indeed.

I updated vertex.

    Run `pdftex test.doc' to get `vertex.pdf'.

TL doesn't generate documentation any more, as a rule.
Praises to Robin, CTAN had vertex.pdf already.  Now TL does too.

I would like to follow that. Heiko, your notes are realy appreciated,
but I do not see any reason to move lang specific *general* documentation
to other place as it is (texmf-doc/).

sk - means for me Slovakian
sj - means for me Slovenian

and, to close the disscusion, slovak (sk) and czech (cs), are *diffent*
languages.

Best,

Seems to be implemented in a hurry.  There is no ls-R file in this
tree, maybe this is one of the reasons Thomas' texdoc had been so
slow.

It is easy to add an ls-R there if it would be useful, which I can see
it would be.  It never occurred to me.

Thank you very much for this information.  Actually, wget is not really
hardcoded in the installer.  The difficulty is that curl writes to
stdout by default, hence it's not sufficient to replace wget by curl.
I fear that too much has to bee changed, but we'll discuss it internally.

Could you please type the following string on the OS X command line
and send me the result?

   perl -e 'print "$^O\n";'

We definitely want to have documentation for xetex in TL.  Jonathan,
are you listening?

Yes, I don't know whether xetex supports a sytem-wide configuration
for paper size.  But I have no objections if it doesn't.  The only
reason for adding the letter/a4 switch to the installer was that so
many people asked for it.  My personal opinion is that papersize
declarations should be done in tex documents, otherwise they can't be
shared with people who have different default settings.

  Reinhard

  "curl -O" does exactly what you want.  Is it so complicated to do the
replacement?

What's the point in having language specific *general* documentation
in texmf-doc? TDS reserves TDS:doc/general and TDS:doc/help as locations.
It does not specify, how it looks below. Thus language separation can be
added here. Also it isn't *general* documentation, see
  vietnamese/amsldoc-vn: AMSLaTeX Manual v2.0, Vietnamese edition
  vietnamese/ntheorem-vn: User's Manual for `ntheorem' package
                          (Vietnamese version)

  english/xetexref: This is unofficial reference documentation for XeTeX
                    detailing its extended features
    It belongs to XeTeX, now the user has to search *all* three texmf trees:
    documentation for programs are randomly^1 assigned to both texmf and
    texmf-dist and now also texmf-doc/doc contains some of it.
    ^1 randomly for the user. I can't see, why pdftex is in texmf, whereas
    its successor luatex is in texmf-dist?

BTW:
* There is french/epslatex-fr, but the original english version is missing!
* texmf-doc/ls-R is missing.

afaics, the german faq we have (dating from 2006) is help/de-tex-faq/part<n>
which looks like something harvested from news.answers

(in one of my periodic glooms about the english faq i run, someone
remarked that the german one seems hardly to be a current activity any
longer -- is this true?)

The name is an invention of TeX Live, probably to be in sync
with `texlive-ge'. The German faq is called "de-tex-faq".
Please correct the wrong two letter language codes from "ge" to "de".

The home of the FAQ is http://www.dante.de/faq/de-tex-faq/
I don't see that FAQ-ge is caused by the authors of the FAQ.
It seems to be in full control of TeX Live.
Karl, please at least change
  FAQ-ge to FAQ-de
and
  texlive-ge to texlive-de
Thanks.

Sad, but true.
(Nevertheless I have some ideas for a revival, basically
a merge between a translation of Robin's FAQ with the
old German FAQ. But that's a project too huge for now.
It's something for TeX Live 2009. And I also will need
some volunteers. Please contact me, if you are interested.)

Yours sincerely

Yes. The last time this was discussed (about a year ago) Bernd
promised a new version RSN.

My Master tree is updated using rsync without deletes, so old cruft has
accumulated.

$ xetex -no-pdf x-story
$ strings x-story.xdv | grep pdf
pdf:pagesize default

Then xdvipdfmx finds ,,/texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg (after checking in
~/.texlive2008, etc).  Editing this file gives me letter paper in the .pdf.

I'd tend to agree, if we were only talking about people writing
reports/papers.

Some people use tex only because it is required by the build system
for some source package.  What they really want is to get documents
that honor the global papersize setting of the system, but since that
seems to vary with the linux distro perhaps is best left to the linux
package manager's post-install scripts to supply the right value to
texconfig-sys, and to texconfig-sys to make the right changes.

There was a proposal to support a default papersize based on the
minimum width/height of a4/letter.  Then we could do away with the
texmf-sys paper nonsense and insist that anyone who wanted
something different for a particular document do it in the tex sources.
I really love ideas that result in less work and less code to maintain.

There seems to be an additional problem with papersizes. Debian users
have frequently complained that on their system TeX documents always
come out as a4, even though they want letter. Of course we told them to
take care on the macro level that the typeset size and the specified
physical papersize match, but not everybody does that.

And I must admit that when I just write a short test document, I often
leave out geometry or hyperref, and when I print this test document, I'm
just lucky that a4 is the default and is in the printer - otherwise I
would have to walk to the printer and tell it "Yes I really do want this
letter document to be printed on a4".

So we decided to change the default for pdfTeX, dvips and dvipdfm with
the Debian system papersize (as specified by libpaper). The part of this
taks which is relevant for TeXLive development is that I first need to
make texconfig aware of all papersizes we support, and do that in the
relevant syntax for all three programs (I hope dvipdfmx uses the dvipdfm
configuration?). I'll try to write that in a way that can be
incorporated in TeXLive proper. (The other part is doing the thing right
with respect to Debian configuration file handling, which is tricky in
this case).

That wouldn't help people with a printer that refuses to print documents
in a papersize that doesn't match the paper it has available, without
manual intervention.

  I strongly advocate for IETF tags (http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt).
They are more precise than ISO 639 tags because you can add tags for
scripts (ISO 15924) as well as for countries (ISO 3166), as well as
other elements, if you need to.  As far as the doc files are concerned,
we do actually need this for Chinese and Mongolian, because each of
these languages can be written in two different scripts (Traditional and
Simplified for Chinese -- ISO 15924 Hans and Hant, and Mongolian or
Cyrillic for Mongolian -- ISO 15924 Mong and Cyrl).  The documents we
have here are in Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans) and Mongolian in Cyrillic
(mn-Cyrl).  Until now, Chinese has been labelled as zh-CN in TeX Live --
I guess because it's the value of the POSIX locale -- but this does not
reflect what it really is (zh-CN would be Chinese from Mainland China,
which is roughly equivalent to Simplified Chinese, but it is still not
the same thing).

  I find it is really important to choose a systematic scheme for
tagging languages.  Mojca and I just reviewed all of TeX Live's pattern
files and converted them to UTF-8, and we also needed a naming scheme;
the IETF recommendation is the only one we found that could accomodate
all of our needs.  It would really be a good thing if TeX Live could
have a clear naming policy for languages.

  About czechslovak: I may be mistaken but I am under the impression
that texmf-doc/doc/czechslovak/texlive-cz/live.pdf is really a mixture
of Czech and Slovak -- most of it seems to Czech, but chapter 8 looks
like Slovak.  Can anyone please clarify this?  Zden?k?

Only one remark concerning the language chaos:

On Debian we got hundreds of complains about language pack contents, eg
the location of Catalan, and Basque, etc etc etc.

I always react with: Please make a decent proposal how to distribute
stuff and present it to tex-live at ..., and one guy even started, well, al
least took a look into the package contents. But then that died out, as
all the other times.

Still, it is a reasonable thing to think about, sometimes. If one here
wants to really think about it it would be *great*.

Best wishes

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

I just installed the current (June 14) svn distribution of TeXLive

well, except that luatex.fmt and xetex.fmt failed to be generated. The

I also have a couple of suggestions, namely:

1) When a Mac OS X system is detected by the installer, perhaps  
$TEXMFHOME should be set to ~/Library/texmf, instead od ~/texmf, by  
default

2) In any case, the value of $TEXMFHOME should be shown with the other  
directory values

3) The supplied language.def loads only the US English hyphenation  
patterns. Would it be possible to include other hyphenation patterns  
by default (as is done with language.dat)?

Thanks everybody,

  We're very well aware of it and working on it currently.  It should be

We use czechslovak in TL intentionally:
1. even when there are 2 countries and 2 (slightly) different languages,
   our friends from both countries still have CSTUG (Czech and Slovak
   TeX Users Group)
2. in both countries people use csplain and/or cslatex
3. I was told that the documentation written in both languages can be
   understandable for each other

As for live.tex some parts were translated by Czechs (Petr Sojka et al), 
some other by Slovak (Jana Chlebikova). I didn't hear any (big) 
complaints.

Yes, it is true. Both languages are similar and almost all of us
understand both languages (very young Czech people have problems).
Similarly typographical conventions in both languages are equal, thus
csplain and cslatex covers both languages. And CSTUG remained
Czechoslovak having members from both republics.

Some directories should only contain certain file types, e.g.:

The perl script at the end checks this, the result:

At least the *.pfm files should be moved into the right tree.

Conflicts with czech.sty, slovak.sty and hypenation files are known
for several years. It was solved in 2006 by incorporating cslatex
features into new babel modules. They are currently available from
www.cstug.cz and with more comfortable installation script from my
page http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/tex/csh_babel.php (I have to add
improved installation script for MiKTeX). We are waiting for its
inclusioin into official babel. After it happens it will be possible
to remove cslatex.

I'm speculating a bit (no windows computer here), but I guess that
Windows expect both files (pfm and pfb) to be present in the same
folder. TeX doesn't really bother if they are left together.

I'm not saying that Windows users are likely to install those old
files on their system, but nevertheless ...

This is a template file to make several different file types.
.doc extension is unfortunate here, though.

.aft are regular .afm files consistent with .tfm files (.afm are 
consistent with .pfb) to help people to play with.

don't know why we need .ali files in TL. Perhaps we can strip that.

.pfm files are never used by any of TeX programs. They are included
together with .pfb files to help people installing them when needed
in windows, os/2 or some more. The same is with .inf files.

> At least the *.pfm files should be moved into the right tree.
Sorry, no. TDS must be for people, but not vice versa. .pfm in other 
directory are unusable at all. They are very small files and doesn't hurt 
so much.

Many thanks for your comments, testing and script.

All the best,

Norbert, it's not an easy thing. It's one on my pending tasks. This kind of 
little stone that you have in your shoe. 

The maintainers wants to have few packages and it's not possible to group many 
languages. Because it's impossible to fit with one sense rule all the 
languages.

To me, following a comunity spirit, tex-live should have a package for each 
language, so divide the files for all the languages. And this package (group 
of files, etc) maintained by a tex lug , the texlug of its language. If a 
comunity doesn't have any people to maintain its own language, that language 
was unmaintained and will disappear. The i18n teams work in that way. Do you 
want to have your language, ok do it. But I don't know if there's some 
infrastructure to do it or if tex-live is prepared for it.

But, it's not an easy thing ....

Regards,

Leo

    What's the point in having language specific *general* documentation
    in texmf-doc?

I'm not arguing that texmf-doc is 100% necessary.  However, given that
it exists, eradicating it would be an extremely big change.  I don't
want to do it, right now, without a compelling reason, and I don't see one.

    Also it isn't *general* documentation, see

"General" just means "pure" -- no macros.

    * There is french/epslatex-fr, but the original english version is missing!

Despite repeated attempts and promises, the author has never uploaded
the source.  It's a long, sad, story.

    * texmf-doc/ls-R is missing.

Fine, since you ask, I'll see about adding it.  No one seems to have
missed it before ...

Thanks,
karl

Where did it come from?  It's not in the source tree.

     XeTeX-reference.pdf 

Already present in TL.

     and tug2003.pdf

I see Build/source/texk/xdvipdfmx/tug2003.pdf, but no source.

Jonathan, if you upload the source and put a suitable license on it, we
could include that in the runtime.  Under some more meaningful name.
Maybe we should include all your articles?

    [TEXMFHOME]

I'm consulting.

    3) The supplied language.def loads only the US English hyphenation  
    patterns. Would it be possible to include other hyphenation patterns  
    by default (as is done with language.dat)?

Clearly this is the intent, but it takes a lot of effort to keep
language.dat, fmtutil.cnf, updmap.cfg in sync now.  I'm scared to try to
add another file of the same ilk.

Norbert, wdyt?

    It would really be a good thing if TeX Live could
    have a clear naming policy for languages.

I can appreciate IETF tags as the reference, but I confess I don't see
where such a policy would apply, aside from the TeX Live manual itself,
hardly a huge deal.  If you're saying texlive-zh-cn should be named
something else, please write tldoc about it.

    well, except that luatex.fmt and xetex.fmt failed to be generated. The  

Both get generated fine for me, because eshyph.tex is not read.  Did you
edit language.def?

You can work around the problem for XeTeX by reading xu-eshyph.tex
instead of eshyph.tex directly.  I don't know if that will suffice for
LuaTeX.

As others replied, shortly we will be importing UTF-8 versions of the
pattern files, which will change things in this regard.

Thanks,

Does Windows support Type1 fonts?  I recently tried to install one and
the problem was that Windows (XP) didn't associate the extension "pfb"
with a font at all.  No problem to install Jacko's OpenType fonts.  It
makes no difference whether I install them using the control panel or
I simply throw them into C:/windows/fonts, after a reboot they are
available.  Installing Type1 fonts seems to be more difficult.  Are
they supported at all?

  Reinhard

    The home of the FAQ is http://www.dante.de/faq/de-tex-faq/

I was about to change the name when I found another problem.  Not that I
can read German, but babelfish translates the license statement at the
top of that page as:

> He can be distributed over arbitrary media freely, as long as he remains
> unchanged 

If the license is really "verbatim only", it must be removed from TeX
Live, sorry to say :(.  Can it be changed?

    texlive-ge to texlive-de

Yes, I will do that when I start working on the documentation updates.

Could you send me a list of papersizes supported by Debian?  It's no
problem for me to support them.  Actually, when I wrote the code I
made all the paper sizes defined in the dvips config file available to
pdftex.  I decided to remove them because the main idea was to provide
a script which does the same as texconfig but works on Windows too,
but not to invent any new features.

I had been wondering why each program supports an arbitrary subset of
available paper sizes.  I thought that I could postpone this
discussion to TL-2009 development, but since Debian people obviously
have an answer, it would be quite helpful if you can send me a list of
paper sizes supported by Debian.  Though I'm quite reluctant to make
significant changes now, adding new paper sizes can be done without
touching existing stuff.

Regards,
  Reinhard

To give programs like `texdoc' a chance to find documentation
in the right language (e.g. "LANG=de texdoc foobar" should find
foobar in German if available otherwise in the original (English?)
language.)

As far as I have understood it, the file isn't usable as
.bst file, because it contains directives for C preprocessor:

| %%                         extensions of the standard styles, as
| %%                         follows:

The standard BibTeX btxbst.doc is located at:
  TDS:doc/bibtex/base/btxbst.doc
Thus, the same top level tree should work fine for xbtxbst.doc:
  TDS:doc/bibtex/beebe/xbtxbst.doc

I will change my script to accept .aft files in TDS:fonts/afm.

I don't know .ali files or which programs use them.
They look as some kind of source files to me:
  TDS:fonts/source/vtex/bera/bera.ali

> >     texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/kpfonts/jkpmn7c.pl

Property list file (tftopl, pltotf).

  $ find fonts -name jkpmn7c.\*
  fonts/vf/public/kpfonts/jkpmn7c.vf
  fonts/tfm/public/kpfonts/jkpmn7c.pl
  fonts/tfm/public/kpfonts/jkpmn7c.tfm

jkpmn7c.pl shouuld go to
  fonts/source/public/kpfonts/jkpmn7c.pl
TDS "3.2 Fonts" says:

For finding files, for example. Nobody expects *.pfm files in
TDS:fonts/type1 if TDS:fonts/pfm exists.

texmf-dist/fonts/pfm contains only one .pfm file:
  $ find fonts -name contnav.\*
  fonts/afm/hoekwater/context/contnav.afm
  fonts/pfm/hoekwater/context/contnav.pfm
  fonts/tfm/hoekwater/context/contnav.tfm
  fonts/type1/hoekwater/context/contnav.pfb
By moving the "unusable" file contnav.pfm to directory
fonts/type1/hoekwater/context/ alongside contnav.pfb
it becomes "usable" for Windows and TDS:pfm can be dropped
entirely.

Also this change of TDS should be noted somewhere in the documentation.

> Many thanks for your comments, testing and script.

I will modify the script to accept .pfm, .inf files in TDS:type1
and to reject TDS:pfm.

    don't know why we need .ali files in TL. Perhaps we can strip that.

If I was starting now, I would not add .ali files, but it seems harmless
to keep them, and then users' old vtex installations will keep working.
Maybe the set of such users is empty, I dunno.

Also, it would be a little work to change the updating mechanism to
ignore them.  Doesn't seem like a priority.

Thanks,
k

usually, pfm files go together with pfb (or pfa): pfb+pfm is installable
combination.

but inf should go with afm, because afm+inf is the source for the pfm file.

in other words,
 
  pf[ab] + pfm is a "good" combination, and
  pf[ab] + afm + inf is a "good" combination

(meaning they can be used to install fonts on windows),
but keeping inf together with pf[ab], and separate from afm does not
make sense, because inf has more sense to be used together with afm.

since we keep afm separately from pf[ab], inf should go with afm.
alternatively, we can put all afm, inf, pfm, and pf[ab] belonging
to the same font in the same directory, getting rid of afm tree.
that would keep all files together and directly installable on woe32.

Best,
v.

No, wrong. VTeX documentation says:

| 2.3.2 The "aliasing" files
|
| These files establish the relation between the font names used by TeX
| (i.e., the TFM's) and the physical font files (Type 1, TrueType or
| OpenType). On other TEX systems they would be called "font map files". The
| files are ASCII and can be manually edited if needed. VTEX will search for
| these file along the TEX include path.

The .ali files are font map files, (TDS:fonts/map)
but they are searched along the TeX include path (TDS:tex/vtex).
Also I have found them in TDS:vtex/config,
TDS:source/latex/augie/vtex,
and TDS:doc/latex/marvosym/vtex

This are five different locations!

Walter as VTeX expert, please clarify.

I suggest to update the TDS standard accordingly.  The same for PFM
files.

yes.  you're using an iso 639-1 tag there -- i thought the question was
"what do ietf tags gain us over iso 639?".

note: we (ctan) already have a modest investment in the use of iso 639-1
tags, in the catalogue.  nothing we couldn't change, but there will be a
period of hiatus if tex live adopts a different scheme.

They are probably equal concerning the two-letter code, at least on
the top level.

A few cases that we had to use to refer to the proper hyphenation
patterns were these for example:
- el-polyton, el-monoton: polytonic and monotonic greek
- sr-Cyrl, sr-Latn: Serbian as written in Cyrillic and Latin scipt
- de-1901, de-1996: German before and after the spelling reform
- (could be) de-CH: German in Switzerland

But for the sake of finding the right documentation, I don't think
that spelling reform makes any difference to German readers that want
to find the right manual, or that Latin/Cyrillic version of manual
makes too much difference to Serbian readers who can read both. It
makes a difference in using the right hyphenation patterns, but not
for docs.

There is one question with this: Do we have *any* chance to
auto-generate these lines from what is present in 
	Master/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.*.dat
??

If yes, I could add some magic such that language.def is updated at the
same time as language.dat (and in the same way!).

Norbert,

There have been some discussions on
http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-hyphen (maybe you should
subscire for passive reading?) and there is some effort going on on
http://www.tug.org/svn/texhyphen/trunk/. The files are nearly-ready to
be submitted to CTAN & included into TeX Live.

I don't know the details, but I have a feeling that language.def needs
lefthyphenmin & righthyphenmin data which is not available in
language.dat.

But: I do autogenerate language.foo.dat files for the languages in
repository (I need to fix some border cases like: Spanish dat file
also lists Catalan, Greek dat file lists all kinds of greek etc.) and
I could just as well auto-generate language.foo.def if needed. See
TL/texmf/tex/generic/config/; files are generated together with
loaders for languages.

There are some open questions concerning language.def vs. language.dat:
- germans want versioned patterns, so it would be nice to support some
versioning
- in language.dat there is no information about hyphenmin
- it would be nice if language.dat and language.def would be unified
(that's what I have heard, I don't know the details and I don't know
when each of them is used)

The new scheme for loading patterns has the following idea:

1.) language.dat contains proper language codes:

uppersorbian    loadhyph-hsb.tex
swedish         loadhyph-sv.tex
turkish         loadhyph-tr.tex
serbian         loadhyph-sr-latn.tex
serbianc        loadhyph-sr-cyrl.tex
greek           loadhyph-el-polyton.tex
=polygreek
monogreek       loadhyph-el-monoton.tex
ancientgreek    loadhyph-grc.tex
bulgarian       loadhyph-bg.tex
russian         loadhyph-ru.tex
ukrainian       loadhyph-uk.tex
norsk           loadhyph-nb.tex
=norwegian
=bokmal
nynorsk         loadhyph-nn.tex

2.) loadhyph-foo.tex takes care that:
- unicode patterns hyph-foo.tex are loaded for the particular language
- for 8-bit engines either the proper UTF-8 to ENCODING is done first
and then patterns are loaded
 (last year the same ugly job in the other direction has been done by
xu-hyphfoo.tex wrappers, except that they were full of hacks)
- sometimes the conversion cannot be done 1:1, an example for that is
Greek with combining accents or German where I do not dare to afford
not supporting OT1 encoding; in such cases, the old file is loaded the
usual way
- sometimes it sets some additional lccodes (apostrophe, dash etc.)

3.) Now the patterns are stored in one place and the knowledge about
patterns (such as which encoding they are written in, what catcodes
they need) is stored in some other file, so that TeX macros that are
needed to handle the patterns are engine-specific

I have also written a generator of tlpsrc files for languages, but I
need some instructions (from you and Karl) about what should go into
those files.

I have absolutely no insight into TeX Live tools, but we can
coordinate to simplify the things as much as possible. We have taken
the effort to "purify" the patterns, what's left to be done is
packaging them properly (and add proper copyright notes on top of
files).

I removed them, thanks.  Clearly our ctan->tl update script doesn't
manage to get rid of them when a directory becomes empty :(.

    * Empty files

I don't think empty files in doc or source are worth trying to eradicate
completely.  In some cases they are the authors' choice.
I'm dealing with the others, one way or another.

    * Unusual characters in file names except [A-Za-z0-9\.\-\_]

Also removed.

Thanks as always,

Hi all,

I'm currently test-driving tl2008 and like the new installer; it's  
great. I have two questions/suggestions:

1. Would it be possible to have a more prominent warning when the  
installer is run without root privileges. I imagine that most users  
want to install into system directories, so if they forget to run as  
su or with sudo, would it make sense to have a dialog "Insufficient  
privileges to write to system directories. Really continue?" and only  
proceed if the user confirms?

2. Is it possible to add a --resume option to the installer script?  
When I installed on Sunday, the download broke off twice at some  
point; the second time at package "xecyr." I was a bit disappointed to  
see that it would just restart from scratch, dowloading everything  
again.

I'm on OS X intel, if this makes a difference.

All best

Thomas

It does. It's just a bit picky about how you give it the Type1 fonts to eat.
For example, it won't recognise them if he cannot see the pfm and pfb in the
same directory. Also, if you only have pfb and afm's, you'll need to convert
afm's to pfm's.

No.

language.def:
% language, patterns file, exceptions file, left- and right-hyphen minima

language.dat:
% language, patterns file
% dialect

But it would be easily possible to have a data structure as superset:
% language, patterns file, exceptions file, left- and right-hyphen minima
% dialect

Then both language.def and language.dat could be generated easily.

Yes, they can be empty on purpose (empty patch file, ...).
(But an empty README is a little disappointing.)

No, not at the current status. The installer is not laid our for that

I will try to hack something into the installer to retry at least 2
times before giving up on downloading a package. Karl, do you agree?

If a file similar to the one attached would be of any help, I can
provide it together with (new) patterns. One could drop all the
language.foo.dat files then, right?

what about the following:

- We get rid of the language.XX.dat file
- replace the
	execute BuildLanguageDat es
  with
	execute language=es name=spanish synonyms=espanol[,...] lefthyphenmin=2 righthyphenmin=2 file=loadhyph-es.tex


(note that these executes could occur several times in one tlpsrc)

Important would be that the 
	language
tag is *unique* over *all* files.

That way we could get rid of *loads* of language.XX.dat files and
updating would be the usual thing, nothing to be thought twice (change
here and there).

If we extend this we could even do something similar with the formats
and get rid of the fmtutil.XXX.cnf files.

Karl???

My job would be to adapt the code generating the
language.dat/fmtutil.cnf lines, which is quite trivial, and add another
function to generate language.def lines.

Could all be done in probably 20min.

Your (whoever that may be) is to fill in the stuff into the tlpsrc
files.

To me that makes sense (less files, less mess). But note that there
are many comments under English.

Can anyone explain me when/which languages should be grouped together
apart from English?
German should probably include old and new, Greek should include all
variants, Serbian should include both scripts. What about
"Czecho-Slovak" and "Norwegian"? Anything else?

I don't think it's worth investing time in debating which things end up
in which tree.  There is no one right answer.  The only rational way to
find documentation is to search via texdoc/locate/whatever, not browse
to some location and "expect" it to be there.  One person's expectation
is another person's total surprise.

The top-level doc.html file (not updated for 2008 yet) was my attempt to
provide an autogenerated (hence should be accurate/complete) index file
that could be searched.  Not that I've ever gotten a single comment
about it, so I don't think it is used.  I admit I don't use it myself :).
So it goes.

We've talked about various ways of improving texdoc already.  Here's
another one: good full-text search of all files (especially PDF).  Now
there's a project ...

Best,
karl

I will, but I'll try it on another computer. Not easy to test, too, as  
luck will have it, this time the download will continue without a  
hitch. Well, I can always pull the network cable :-)

Hi Thomas,

One more thing:

You can try
	export TL_DOWNLOAD_ARGS="-q --tries=3 -O"
and then start the installation. That should give wget three chances to
download a file.

Could you please report on any improvement by this?

Best wishes

"He" is the text, otherwise the translation is really good: It is a

Both texdoc and locate require the name of the documentation and
they will not show a file listing with all relevant documentation.
Example:
  "texdoc pdftex" or "texdoc xetex" fail. But TDS says in principle,
  where the documentation files reside.
    TDS:doc/<program name>/
  In case of pdfTeX is shows different documentation files, examples, ...
  if I have the luck to hit the right texmf tree.
Therefore I can't see the benefit of having three texmf trees,
it just make life harder.

The organisation of nearly 70000 files can't be based on surprise
entirely. There is TDS that at least should reduce the surprise.

I admit, I have never looked into it. I thought it contains some
short general intro to TeX Live.
  I see, you have also pointers to the directories. Another argument
to move doc source files out of TDS:doc.

Or a TeX macro index, showing where a macro is defined and documented.

TL can be installed with regular user privileges by setting permission
on the top-level
directory.  As long as TL continues to install under a top-level
directory, it should
be enough to check that the top level directory can be written by the
current user.

I had the same problem.  Can the -profile option be used to resume an
interrupted installation?   It may be appropriate to modify

./tlpkg/installer/wgetrc

which has "tries = 2", although the comments suggest a default of tries=20.

Haa, good question. There is only one politically correct solution,
putting ALL hyphen pattern/languages into ONE package. Otherwise either
the separatists or the unionists or whoever is pissed off. It is a pain
anyway.

Do what you thing fits best, and ignore any complains, it is useless
unless people submit proposals.

AFAIK the japanese paper sizes are defined in JIS P 0138. See also

Hi Frank,
thank you very much. 

Seems that most of the paper sizes you mentioned are supported by
dvips already.  I'll look into it tomorrow.

Ok, the language.def generation code is there, but not checked in by
now. I didn't touch the fmtutil.cnf code for now, waiting for Karl.

One more question:

How are synonyms treated in language.def? The same way like the normal
language by simply adding another \AddXXX line?

Best wishes

Texdoc shouldn't and hopefully won't any more require the exact name of the
documentation in the future.  I'll work on this after this year's release.

At the moment, there is the -s option which show quite a lot of possible
documentation, but not exactly just the relevant documentation.

Well, anyway I don't think the user should need to learn the TDS in order to
be able to read documentation.  I think the better is to learn texdoc the TDS
(or more precisely the TDS implementation chosen in TL) with some heuristic
and/or have it read a database with the relevant info (the Catalogue, heance
the texlive.tlpdb file contains such information).

A first step in this direction would be to have a full-text search in the
longdesc field of texlive.tlpdb (like the online search on CTAN, but local so
faster and more accessible).  There's a few details that need attention in
this part but we'll discuss them later.

Hi Ralf, 
I'd like to postpone the Japanese stuff to TL 2009 because the table
only mentions paper sizes but no names.  In the menus I prefer to have
names like "A4" instead of "210 true mm, 297 true mm".

Japanese paper sizes will certainly be supported by TeX Live in the
future, but I fear that it's necessary to discuss this with people from
Japan before such things are carved in stone. 

Thanks for the link, though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

probably, it would be good to have the target encoding (such as t1, il2,
ly1, eu1) in which to load the patterns, specified in the unified file.
(also, versioning, etc). then the same UTF8-encoded pattern file can be
used to pre-load patterns in any supported target encoding.

    >> 2. Is it possible to add a --resume option to the installer script?

In general, we're just calling wget, not programming the TCP connections
ourselves.  If the download fails, it fails.  I see wget has a
--continue option, but resuming the download of one file is not enough,
we'd have to save the entire state of the desired installation to be
able to continue it in a separate invocation.  This doesn't seem practical.

I expect failed downloads to be a top problem, but I don't have any good
solution for it :(.  

I've just changed our wgetrc to have tries=4 by default.  The default of
20 seemed useless to me -- if it fails the first couple times, the
chances of it succeeding on the 20th seem basically nil (surely it'll be
a bad hostname or something "permanent").  So we put in a default of
tries=2, but maybe that was too far in the other direction.  We'll see ...

thanks,
k

      with
            execute language=es name=spanish ...

I've never been thrilled about the language.*.dat setup, so in principle
I have no objection to getting rid of it.

    Your (whoever that may be) is to fill in the stuff into the tlpsrc
    files.

I cannot undertake to do that.  However, since Mojca is already able to
generate most of the foo.*.dat files, I imagine it would not be
difficult for her to generate tlpsrc entries instead.  Mojca?

The relatively few files which she is not generating I can do.  Or
someone.  Looks pretty routine.

While talking about XeTeX documentation (sorry, I know there was a more
appropriate place in this thread, but I can't find it any more), it could be
nice to include the XeTeX companion.  The bad point is, it's not on CTAN, but
I can contact the author (FM) about it and take care of it.

In 90% it would be used for loadhyhp-XX.tex, it used to be used in
language.XX.dat, but at this moment you might indeed not need it any
more.

But some other question - it would be nice to know what to put to
those tlpsrc files apart from the execute line.

Apart from that, I have no idea where to take the hyphmin settings
from for Hungarian, Greek, Polish, Coptic and Turkish at least. Not
100% sure whether I got them right for other languages.

    at this moment you might indeed not need it any more.

Right, not needed, so let's leave it out.  (The language=es parameter.)

    But some other question - it would be nice to know what to put to
    those tlpsrc files apart from the execute line.

Lots of things, but nothing you need to worry about.  All you need to
generate are the execute lines (instead of the .dat's).  Ok?

    Apart from that, I have no idea where to take the hyphmin settings
    from for Hungarian, Greek, Polish, Coptic and Turkish at least. 

Perhaps people on this list can advise on the proper values of
\lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin for these languages.

    Not 100% sure whether I got them right for other languages.

It will be a work in progress, like everything.  It won't be any worse
than it was before, so not to worry.

Thanks,

    1. Would it be possible to have a more prominent warning when the  
    installer is run without root privileges. 

Well, as Reinhard said, the issue is not root/non-root, but permission
to write to the given directories.  I personally don't think it's a good
idea to install everything as root, as OSX and plenty of other systems
lead users to do these days, so I don't just want to issue a blanket
warning if non-root.

I guess we could check at the beginning (as well as at installation) if
there is permission to write TEXDIR if it exists, or the parent of
TEXDIR if it doesn't, and say "No permission to write these directions,
change them or rerun with appropriate privileges."

Thanks,
k

Execute statements attached, but I guess that complete files would be

2 things:

- please LEAVE the initial 
	language=XX
  OR modify the lines so that something reasonable is at the beginning:
	execute AddHyphen name=arabic lefthyphenmin= righthyphenmin= file=zerohyph.tex
  I need a identifier for the lines, and 'name=' is not the best idea.

- What should be done with those missing

But this is done already, and in this case the warnings do appear in
text and gui mode.

Before we did something different, we automatically changed the
destination to ~/texlive/2008 (~ being $HOME or %USERPROFILE%). Then you
suggested that we should not do that but keep the original default
destination and issue a warning.

The test already is not a test on root/non-root, but on write
permissions to dest or paretn of dest. See TLUtils: check_texdir()

Just peeking at my polyglossia files I find those values (which I mostly 
got from antomega or babel):

Greek: left 1, right 1
Hungarian: 2 2
Polish: 1 1
Coptic: probably 1 1 (as Greek)
Turkish: 2 2

NB: For Arabic, Farsi etc. you can use 1 1 too (doesn't matter).

Fran?ois

No, etex.src defines \addlanguage:

  \def \addlanguage #1#2#3#4#5% language patterns exceptions lhm rhm
    {\expandafter \et at xlang \csname lang@#1\endcsname
     \expandafter \chardef \csname lhm@#1\endcsname=#4 % V1.0-1
     \expandafter \chardef \csname rhm@#1\endcsname=#5 % V1.0-1
     ...}

It does not check for empty arguments and the arguments
must be numbers because of \chardef.
  Perhaps the original values of plain-TeX
(USenglish: 2 for lhm and 3 for rhm) could be
used as default if more correct values are missing.

Yours sincerely

OK. Added. Can someone please check the attached file?
Karl - the languages there are now "properly" listed, in the sense
that none are missing and in the sense that you should not need to add
any other files except for English (ukenglish should be listed under
english in my opinion).

OK, but there was another discussion with Karl. We have a completely
new set of files. Now there will be:

* a package called hyph-utf8 taken from SVN repository (OK, I will
submit it to CTAN before that) that will contain:
  a) some sources in source/generic/hyph-utf8/... (whatever - not needed anyway)
  b) some relatively small files in tex/generic/hyph-utf8/loadhyph -
that could (in theory, but is not needed) be all included by default
as well
  c) patterns for languages - not that small anymore, could be split
into multiple packages like they are now

* additionaly, we have:
  d) some old patterns that will be needed
  e) some old patterns that will not be needed, but we want to keep
them on TeX Live

e) is not needed - should it be added to hyphen-legacy or should files
be still installed together with a language? (I would prefer to have
them split, so that people who need them can still install them, while
the rest will not have to bother about old files, and it will also
help to "spread the word" about these new patterns a bit. I have a
feeling that some might start fiddling with old files and wonder why
some changes don't work.) When someone installs everything, the old
files will be there anyway.

Both Czech and Slovak: \lefthyphenmin=2, \righthyphenmin=3
Typographical rules allow \righthyphenmin=2 when typesetting in a
narrow column (newspapers etc.).

I've seen this in sources:

\global\everyjob = \expandafter
        {\the \everyjob
      \message {Loading CZ hyphenation patterns: Pavel Sevecek, v3, 1995}
        }
\def\PavelSevecek{}
\fi
%\lefthyphenmin=2\righthyphenmin=2
\patterns{

but it's true that these values are not set anywhere, so it's probably
2/3 (default) now. I have changed the values to 2/3 now.

Hello,

I have written a script to "check" files based on the file extension.
See below in the Perl script, which programs I have used for "checking".

As result the problematic files of the first 2193 checked files:

The last ones :-((( are now fixed (again a problem with the last step
with Multivaltent to generate compressed PDF 1.5) by generating
PDF 1.4 instead. The update is on its way to CTAN.

One more question: does language.def permit setting a different
minimal and preferred value for hyphenmin? If the values are too high
during format generation, they probably cannot be lowered, but vice
versa is possible, if I understood it right?

Thanks,

\righthyphenmin is a normal TeX register. I use the following code:


\begin{multicols}{3}\righthyphenmin=2
...
\end{multicols}

Glancing over the code in tex.web I guess that lefthyphenmin and
righthyphenmin are not consulted when compiling patterns, but merely
when actually doing hyphenation.

As opposed to hyphenation patterns, hyphenation characters and some
similar variables, lefthyphenmin and righthyphenmin are not even global.

For LuaTeX you would have to ask Taco.

To the best of my recollection (from work
on the UK hyphenation patterns) this is
correct, but when generating the source
".dic" file the expected values of
{left|right}hyphenmin are used.  What would
happen if there is a mismatch depends on
the direction of the mismatch : if the
actual value of *hyphenmin is less than the
value used to generate the ".dic" file,
then the value used to generate the ".dic"
file will effectively be used ; if greater,
the value of *hyphenmin will be used.

Subject: [tex-live] xindy: missing libraries?
Message-ID: <4857CB8B.2010809@ankabut.net>

Hello,

a few weeks ago I was able to compile everything without a problem on my 
Linux box. Today I encounter the following errors during compilation of 
xindy, which point to two missing libraries (libavcall and libcallback). 
I 'm pretty sure they were not required last time, and very little has 
changed on my machine since then. Any idea?

Sorry for the noise, but now I found that the two missing files are 
actually under
.../source/Work/utils/xindy/rte/xindy-build-dir/

Some parameter must be wrongly set somewhere, since they are being 
searched under /usr/lib instead...

Oops. Noise again :/

I had found the above with "locate" but that was based on the previous 
build... Hhmmm.
In fact those files are no longer there, so you can ignore my second 
message.

Looks like the ISO build failed last night.  About half the time mkisofs
is aborting with a write error for no apparent reason -- there are no
hardware failures in the syslog.  It is a mystery to me and I haven't
had the time to devote to debugging it.

Try again tomorrow.  Better yet, try the small installer :).

    I have written a script to "check" files based on the file extension.
    See below in the Perl script, which programs I have used for "checking".

Thanks, although it hardly surprises me that any given PDF reader cannot
read all pdf files.  Acrobat is especially notorious for this.

These issues have to be taken up with the package authors.  It's beyond
me, sorry ...

Thank you.  Yes - I was always a bit puzzled why the available paper
sizes were not synchronized.

That's not true:

texdoc -s geometry 

shows all the documentation for geometry (and more), and grepping for
"pdf" gives 2 hits (in tl 2007). 

texdoc -s pdftex | grep [.]pdf

gives 10 hits.

With the lua version, it even finishes before you've made and drunk a
cup of coffee (or brewn and drunken a beer, depending on the size of
your TEXMF trees).

Hi Frank,
the paper sizes supported by Debian which are not supported by dvips
are:

  b10 b7 b8 b9 c2 c3 c4 c6 c7 c8

Adding them to config.dvips makes sense, IMO.

But what I'm not sure about is whether it makes much sense to allow
people to set all the papersizes supported by dvips as a default.

The idea behind config.dvips is that you specify one default value
once and select other paper formats on the command line when needed.
Most of the paper formats supported by dvips don't qualify as a
default value.  They are useful for particular files only.

It's not a technical problem.  All known paper formats can be made
available to dvips, pdftex, dvipdfm[x]... and there is no problem if
people run tlmgr from the command line (tlmgr paper foo).  But there
is a graphical user interface now and it is very annoying that there
are so many entries in the dvips pull-down menu for things that nobody
needs.

 > Yes - I was always a bit puzzled why the available paper sizes were
 > not synchronized.

The code which is responsible for paper sizes we currently have in TeX
Live hopefully does exactly the same thing as Thomas Esser's
texconfig.  The only difference is that it is written in texlua in
order to make the gap between TL for Unix and TL for Windows smaller.

The only reason it behaves exactly as Thomas' texconfig script was to
postpone any discussions... But expect changes in TL-2009.

In short, my personal opinion is to leave things as they are now.
What I absolutely don't want to do is to provide new features which
have to be dropped next year. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is  a bit odd.

If I go to

ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/
There is nothing that I can download but if I go to

ftp://tug.org/texlive/images/

and I click on the test folder which takes me to
ftp://tug.org/texlive/images/test/

then I am able to download the ISO image file.

does it means that the source and binary files in the svn isn't match

I installed TL08 successfully on Linux. but when I want to install it on
windows, the installer says in red writings ``(default not writable- please
change!)'', This is for the main TeX directory, and by trying to change this
directory  the problem still remains.

I do not think this is a problem with my windows machine because then I
tried Installing TL07 , it installed it easilly.

Are you using Vista?

Do you have admin rights?

Can you actually *create* the destination directory?

Taco moved contnav.pfm to the proper directory yesterday. As I see,
.tlpdb was also properly updated last night, so perhaps you read somehow
older database (?)
Please observe that everyday we have changes, also in packaging, so
you can expect things not in sync.

Mea culpa. Yes, I updated the files yesterday evening (and will never
ever try to report a problem without retrying everything in a couple
of hours).

    but the binary file in the iso seems still 20080524:

Indeed.

    does it means that the source and binary files in the svn isn't
    match each other ? do we need to improve it ?

No.  It would not be feasible to recompile every binary on every system
after every change.  Anyway, this was actually the first nontrivial
change to the sources and it is an extremely minor issue.

There will be at least one more round of rebuilds before the release;
the version numbers have to be updated.  I have intentionally been
waiting to do this until there has been a chance to get feedback on
actual user documents from actual users.  Nothing reported so far ...

Currently I am working on the script for checking files.

The user interface is a little unclear, e.g.:
* How to find texmf trees/TL root (command line option, ...)?
* What to do with programs that are not part of TL?
...

Then I want to go back to the script for consistency checking
(unique constraints, empty directories, ...).
* (Of course checks for empty directories are more easy
  without .svn directories -- I am using the rsync method.)
* (The script doesn't include transitive empty directories,
  that are directories that would be empty if empty subdirectories
  would be removed == directories that have only directories
  as descendants.)

Some kind of free licence is fine with me.

As timeline I want to finish the scripts at this weekend.

Yours sincerely

I recently installed the 2008-06-18 beta version of TeXLive 2008, and  
found the following (apparent) bug with pstopdf (on an i386 iMac  
running Mac OS X 10.5.3): processing a .ps file generated with dvips  
from a LaTeX source using psfrag, pstopdf produced a pdf file without  
all the pages after (and including) the page containing the figure.  
This problem didn't occur using ps2pdf from MacPorts (ghostscript port).

Cheers,

Artemio

Subject: [tex-live] [bibtex] strange bbl file when url is too long
Message-ID: <20080620090141.GE6364@hohwie.com>

hi,

I'm using this bibtex entry:

@Misc{flensburg,
	author = {H.W. Lang},
	title  ={Boyer-Moore-Algorithmus},
	howpublished = {website},
	URL = {http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/algorithmen/pattern/bm.htm},
	urldate = {08.08.2007},
	language = {ngerman},
}

And these settings in the tex file:

\usepackage[short,ngerman,english]{isodate}
\usepackage[annote,languagenames]{babelbib}
\usepackage{url}
\bibliographystyle{babplai3} 	
\setbibliographyfont{urldate}{\printdate}
\declarebtxcommands{english}{%
  \def\btxurldatecomment#1{ [#1]}%
}

Running pdflatex after bibtex fails:

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> ...rithmen/pattern/bm.htm}}\btxurldate 
                                                  comment {\btxkeywordlangua...

cat tex.bbl (trimmed):

---->

comment {\btxkeywordlanguage {\btxurldatefont{08.08.2007}}}.
<----

\end{thebibliography}

the problem is: bibtex breaks the line in the middle of
the command '\btxurldatecomment'. If I shorten the url
e.g. to: http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/algorithmen/pattern
then the output is ok:

---->

  {\btxkeywordlanguage {\btxurldatefont{08.08.2007}}}.
...
<----

I don't know who to blame for this.
Or is this an expected behaviour?

pstopdf runs a ruby script, which should behave similarly to ps2pdf.  Both
use ghostscript for the real work.  Do you have multiple versions of ghostscript
installed?  I think some 3rd party apps put a ghostscript in /usr/local/...
If you get a .pdf file use the  Inspector in Preview.app to see which version
of ghostscript was used.

texdoc of TeX Live 2008 does not print any message.

It's already on the todo-list, together with a poniter to the online
Catalogue page if found or the Catalogue search page otherwise.

Subject: [tex-live] TL2008 in Windows
Message-ID: <485BC5A8.9050903@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi all,

the following things came up during a first test of TL2008 on a newly 
installed Windows XP Pro (in chronological order):

1. The installer seems to add 84 to the total number of collections 
after each time the macro or language options are opened&closed. This 
gives rather strange output (84 collections of 336) although everything 
is selected for installation.

2. The TL Manager is not working (at least in this VM). I get the message:

C:\texlive\2008\bin\win32>syntax error at 
C:/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/
tlmgrgui/tlmgrgui-real.pl line 117, near "}"
Compilation failed in require at 
C:\texlive\2008\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgrgui\
tlmgrgui.pl line 58.

3. There seems to be no DVI-Viewer for Windows installed or an the DVD

Which preferences of texdoc?  Are you speaking of texdoc (the command-line
utimity) or texdoctk (the graphical version)?

Not that I know, if you want something TeX (Live) specific.

If .mf support could be added to freetype, Xorg (and lots of other apps) would get it for
free as well. Of course the problem is adding support for it to freetype. Maybe
mplib could give a hand in that?

To me the question is whether the efforts to improve X support for
languages with
with other than left-to-right layout will prove adequate for maths.  I
suspect the
best we hope for is that the new machinery (both rendering engines and fonts)
can be tweaked to work for maths.  If we end up with some fundamentally
broken system, then something that renders .mf directly might make sense,
but then there would be pressure to extend .mf to support many more glyphs,
so we would need a new format and tools to convert .otf to .mf, etc.
I was kinda
hoping I might live long enough to see nice maths rendering become the
norm, not
something that takes much work and esoteric tools.

If you are satisfied with ugly conversion of a simple font, it can be
easy. You just convert the outline curve and fill it. OTF can contain
various features. In order to implement them you will have to convert
one OTF to a set f MF fonts and make some clever driver file. And
hinting in OTF is different from hinting in MF. I am afraid that it
can only be done manually. When you go to printing, you need an
outline font. If you ask in any DTP studio how to set MF mode suitable
for their phototypesetter, they won't know. If you convert your set of
MF back to OTF, you have to make hinting again manually. Thus I am
almost sure that tweaking with MF is nowadays nothing but waste of
time.

Better not checkout but use rsync if you care about space and don't need to
really use svn.  See http://tug.org/texlive/svn/ point 2.  The installer runs
just fine from the svn tree.

AFAIK, there will be a tarball release too this year, since it's easier for
linux distros to handle, but it is not yet part of the daily test builds.

Indeed :-)  I've absolutely no time for playing around with font
formats not known yet to FreeType.  It takes all my time to fix bugs
in the font format modules already available.

I agree. Actually the main problem is font encoding (which is custom). 
If you take the TeX Type 1 BlueSky CM fonts,
or convert the MF ones into TTF or OTF using for instance the good 
FontForge, the applications who could access to them,
are pretty awkward at handling directly without some sort of TeX engine. 
You can try for instance in using
such Type1 font family with OpenOffice (apart the ooolatex module 
http://ooolatex.sourceforge.net/). This can be achieved
adding both the .pfb and .afm files into /usr/lib/openoffice/share/fonts.

Methods for converting .mf to outline (either Type1, TTF, OTF) in an 
automatic or semiautomatic way there are several: they go from Kinch's 
metafog,
to mftrace (using autotracing at higher [smoke] resolution, the same 
FontForge do this step in a semi-transparent way), or metatype1
(for .mf sources already arranged in a certain way). But this 
availability IMHO won't improve the usage of such fonts into 
applications other than TeX|LaTeX|DVI engines (you can try for instance
with inkscape, openoffice, etc.). IMHO adding the MF support to freetype 
shouldn't be too difficult (just call MF in the background to render 
bitmaps at 4x resolution, scale them
and you even get the full antialias), but the problem is which X apps 
can handle these math bitmaps correctly?

IMHO it's better to concentrate efforts in getting things like MathML 
support for browsers working for either screen rendering
as well as printing. E.g. there was the STIX fonts project 
(http://www.stixfonts.org/). For printing
MathML into gecko based browsers, in the past there was the utility xprint
(now merged into Xorg and renamed to Xprt, but IIRC its development 
seems to be abandoned).

Bye
Giuseppe.

BTW, it's not only disk space what matters.  Subversion is very slow
as compared with rsync because it avoids to overwrite modified files.
It doesn't rely on time stamps.  Whenever you run "svn update" it
calculates checksums of all the files (more than 70,000) in your
working copy.  If you don't have to upload files, rsync is much more
efficient.

There is also a network installer:

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/install-tl.zip

Even if you are using rsync --compress, I suppose that TeX Live is
using a better compression algorithm.  Once you have installed TeX
Live you can update it by the command "tlmgr update --all".

The packages are created daily and are mirrored daily to CTAN.  Hence,
they are a bit less up-to-date than the stuff in the repository.
However, the advantage of using the network installer is that you can
decide yourself which collections you want to install/update.  This
could save you a lot of time.  Especially if you don't know how to
test macro packages for CJK, Devanagari, Arabic, ancient Greek... 

And it doesn't hurt to test the network installer self.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Another advantage of the network installer is that it's always in a coherent
state.  With the svn tree, there can be problems to install/update packages
that we update in the last 24h.

Maybe, but only after quite a lot of extra work. As you know,
metapost does not create bitmaps, and the graphics it produces
are not easy to convert to a font-format either. On top of that,
it is not 100% compatible with metafont. Too much work for me,
especially compared to the (imho very small) gain of being able
to use .mf directly.

Best wishes,
Taco

	tlmgr update --all
and then the crate bat file (tlmgr will tell you)

Karl, could you kind enough to update at least the i386-linux dvipdfmx
binary file to the latest version?  Or can you tell me how to compile
a version by myself ?

I want to use animate.sty with dvipdfmx.  and the following is my test file:

%<-----------------------<---------------------------<-------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{animate}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{verbatim}
\usepackage{fourier}

\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,calc,trees,snakes}
\usetikzlibrary{mindmap}

\begin{document}



\begin{animateinline}[step, controls]{1}
\begin{tikzpicture} [thick]
\draw (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\newframe
\begin{tikzpicture} [thick]
%   \draw (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
\draw (0,1) -- (1,2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\newframe
\begin{tikzpicture} [thick]
\draw (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
\draw (0,1) -- (1,2);
\draw (1,2) -- (1,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{animateinline}

\end{document}
%<-----------------------<---------------------------<-------------------------

I think maybe the latest dvipdfmx can handle this tex file correctly.

Subject: [tex-live] kpathsea -- texmf.cnf
Message-ID: <20080621164653.GA31282@localhost>

Dear TeXlive developers,

In a linux machine (Mandriva 2008.1), with a bash shell 
version 3.2.19(2)-release, for some reason the syntax
based on "~" used in the default "texmf.cnf" is not
correctly interpreted, and results in a directory with
this name, literally "~", being built under the home 
directory. On the other hand, if I replace "~" by the 
older syntax "$HOME", things work as expected. I wonder 
if you'd like to do that, so as to avoid problems. In 
case the answer is affirmative, I attach a patch to 
save you the trouble.

Best regards,
Ricard

Message-ID: <41ECB9F2-806C-4C7B-AF50-735A10F62B79@sil.org>

It seems that the long list of links to FAQ entries in

   texmf-doc/doc/english/FAQ-en/html/index.html

are all broken; they point to targets such as "FAQ-whatTeXhtml"  
instead of "FAQ-whatTeX.html"

I'm assuming this file is generated by a script somewhere, so that  
needs to be fixed and re-run, but I haven't dug around to figure out  
what/where it is.

i'll mend the links just as soon as i can see *why* they're wrong.
(i've uploaded one new version already today, after manuel pointed out a
rather more subtle error...)

that bug's been there quite a while (it's to do with preparations for
the new generation on-line faq).  now corrected at

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/uk-tex-faq/FAQ-html.tar.gz

sorry about the inconvenience.

you wouldn't have found it: it doesn't get let out, much.  if i had more
energy/time to work on the thing, i might have taken up bill hammond's
suggestion of a gellmu-based version, in which case, such blunders might
be more difficult to make.

i wonder how many more bugs will have surfaced by the time i get up
tomorrow morning...  :-(

Hi Ricard,
could you please tell us more about the TeX Live system you are using?

It seems that you are using a new texmf.cnf file and an old version of
the kpathsea library.  Tilde expansion had been introduced a few
months ago.  ~ expands to $HOME on Unix systems and to %USERPROFILE%
on Windows.  Your patch can't be applied because TeX Live 2008 depends
on the new behavior.  There is only one texmf.cnf file for all
platforms, including Windows.  The idea is that you can install TL on
a server and mount it on various client machines.  This is much easier
now than in the past.

Tilde expansion works fine on Unix and Windows if your programs are
linked against the current version of the kpathsea library.

Hence the question again:  Where did you get texmf.cnf from and where
did you get the files in bin/<platform> from?

And please be careful.  If tilde expansion doesn't work for you, it
can happen that directories with the name ~ are created.  Keep in mind
that something like "rm -rf ~" wipes out your whole $HOME tree... 
If you are unsure, use rm with the -i option.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Do you have a local copy of the svn repository?  Then it's sufficient
to run the Build/source/Build script, maybe with --without-xindy, and
the binaries will be created in Build/source/inst/bin/<platform>.

I think it will contain the stuff which is supposed to be burnt to the
DVD.  Everything else doesn't make sense because the sources are
accessible by subversion, rsync, and a lot of other programs already.

This is a warning, not an error message.  You can ignore it.  I must

yes, I've just make a successfully build and can get the binary file
now. but it look like there are some problems with the 'home-made'
version of these files ----------- they can't find the latex files
with kpath. and I don't know how to config it out .

Ok, thx. I've tested the new version of dvipdfmx, and it's works well
with the test file.

but it looks like xdvipdfmx still old and need to be updated for the
xetex to work with animate package.

... but it's related to a technical problem. 

Not a big one, I think; I'll just have to check whether the default
Debian paper size can be handled well by texconfig or its lua
successor, and act accordingly.

It would make my life easier if we could kind of agree which paper sizes
make sense as a default paper size. A4 and letter for sure. If an
installation is exclusively used to print leaflets or envelopes, the
local admin might want this - but on the other hand, he'll have to
provide a corresponding style file for the typesetting size anyway, so
that one could as well include geometry.sty.

Are there any printers around that support different standard sizes than
A4 and letter - maybe something used in far-eastern countries?  Or do
lawyers print on "legal paper"?

I guess the sources are on the DVD, too, since we don't want to provide
a "Written offer..."? But in any case, the sources *do* make sense in
the tarball for the distros, because the point of having a TeXLive
package included in your distro is that you have it compiled according
to the policies of that distro. This often included dynamic linking,
e.g.

Hi,

I just compiled texlive using macports on OSX, and found an error in
one of the Makefiles.  It was giving me this compile error:

I fixed it by editing texlive_base-2007/texk/xdvik/Makefile

I changed the line that read:

x_ldflags=-L/usr/lib/ruby 1 -L/usr/X11/lib

to:

x_ldflags=-L/usr/lib/ruby -L/usr/X11/lib

Anyway, hope that helps someone, and that I am reporting this in the
right place.  Please let me know!

Thanks,

Kyle

Hi Kyle,

    x_ldflags=-L/usr/lib/ruby 1 -L/usr/X11/lib
    to:
    x_ldflags=-L/usr/lib/ruby -L/usr/X11/lib

Thanks for the report.  However, there is no such line in the source
file Makefile.in which generated that erroneous Makefile.  It says:
x_ldflags=@X_LIBS@ @x_linker_options@ @iconv_libpath@

So it would seem the `1' got inserted as a result of a configure test.
If you feel like pursuing it further, you could look at your config.log.
I don't see any practical way to debug it here.

On the other hand, if you didn't run configure (ie, Macports provided
the Makefile and not just the Makefile.in source, then it is a bug
for whoever generated it.

Best,
Karl

P.S. It also seems a bit odd that /usr/lib/ruby is included here.  Whatever.

Sorry for answering after such a long time. I think that removing
vlna.exe will be sad for Czech and Slovak users. This program inserts
nonbreakable spaces after nonsylabic prepositions. Linux users are
able to comple it from sources, most Windows users are not able to
compile it. A few months ago t was decided to provide vlna executables
for all platforms. In the meantime I found a few minutes to finish
documentation and add a license to encxvlna, which is its
implementation in encTeX, and upload it to CTAN.

Yes, that's true.

teTeX and TeX Live had only A4 as a default in the past and only the
Americans asked for letter.  See also:

No, only the Debian people are always worried about legal stuff. :)

Given that TL2008 is being tested, you might consider
just getting that if your system is supported.  If you are
installing texlive because some package depends on
it, you might find a way to override the dependencies.

Which version of OSX and what hardware are you using?

It isn't clear to me where you got texlive.  Are you talking
about the version from port install texlive?  For those not
familiar with macports, it is a system that stores build
scripts (called port files).  When you install a package, the
sources are downloaded, patches applied, and configure,
make, make install or some such are run.  For MacPorts,
the patches from the BSD port of TL2007 are used.

If you are using the macports build system, then this looks like a problem
in either the port file or the BSD port of tl2007 by Edd Barrett and you
should report the problem on the macports user list.

Oh ok. I think perhaps there are 2 tarballs perhaps. I know myself, 
Karl, and some other porters (redhat, gentoo and debian) have been 
discussing a tarball containing sources and texmf's.

A4 and letter should suffice as alternatives for a default paper size.

Anyone setting up a system dedicated to some odd size should
expect to spend a little extra time figuring out how to set the right
size.   I've encountered this just twice, the first time was for camera-
ready copy on an early 1200x600 dpi laser printer using paper with
the photo area (A4, letter, etc) marked by a blue rectangle and quite
generous margins.   The second time was a Kodak dye-sub printer
that used paper with 2/3 ratio (e.g., 8x12) like 35mm film.   I can
assure you that both printers required lots of attention, but the
odd  paper sizes were never a big issue.

    yes, I've just make a successfully build and can get the binary file
    now. but it look like there are some problems with the 'home-made'
    version of these files ----------- they can't find the latex files
    with kpath. and I don't know how to config it out .

As you've seen, you can't usefully run the binary from the .../inst/bin
location.  Move it to the actual bin location so it can find the TeX
support trees.

No doubt it would be possible to figure out a way to make it find the
trees from .../inst/bin, but I've never tried.

Best,

Yes, and so is every other binary.  I already explained the story.

    and need to be updated for the xetex to work with animate package.

I have updated i386-linux/xdvipdfmx in the repo so you can test.

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc can't find texmf.cnf
Message-ID: <B8334957-CAA9-44D6-A548-5701C6C2BF9F@sil.org>

Is it just me, or is there a problem with texdoc? I'm trying to run  
from the Master tree in TL svn....

When I run texdoc (which is now a symlink to texlive/Master/texmf/ 
scripts/texlive/texdoc.tlu), it fails to find texmf.cnf, and  
therefore also fails to find anything else. I've run with  
KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 to see what's happening, and it seems that the  
starting point is the compile-time path:

   {$SELFAUTOLOC,$SELFAUTODIR,$SELFAUTOPARENT}{,{/share,}/texmf{- 
local,}/web2c}

Remember that the script is at texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/ 
texdoc.tlu. So the variables here resolve to:

   SELFAUTOLOC    -> texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive
   SELFAUTODIR    -> texlive/Master/texmf/scripts
   SELFAUTOPARENT -> texlive/Master/texmf

and the places to search for texmf.cnf then resolve to:

   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts
   texlive/Master/texmf
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/share/texmf-local/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/share/texmf-local/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/share/texmf-local/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/texmf-local/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texmf-local/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/texmf-local/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/share/texmf/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/share/texmf/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/share/texmf/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/texmf/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/scripts/texmf/web2c
   texlive/Master/texmf/texmf/web2c

Of these, only the first three (corresponding to the three $SELFAUTO*  
variables with no subdirs) actually exist; there is no web2c  
directory, let alone a texmf.cnf, at any of the other locations.

The problem seems to arise because the kpathsea assumpting (embodied  
in the compile-time paths) is that the binary will be no more than  
two levels down from the "root" of the TL installation (corresponding  
to texlive/Master here), so that $SELFAUTOPARENT will move up to the  
root, and we can then append /texmf/web2c and find the standard  
texmf.cnf file.

However, texdoc.tlu is now installed at a deeper level, under texmf/ 
scripts/texlive, so $SELFAUTOPARENT only brings us up as far as the  
texmf/ directory. The compile-time paths then add a second texmf/  
level before web2c, and we don't find the file we need.

AFAICT, there are two ways to address this: either (a) modify the  
compile-time path to something like

   {$SELFAUTOLOC,$SELFAUTODIR,$SELFAUTOPARENT}{,{/share,}{,/texmf{- 
local,}}/web2c}

(untested, the intent was to make the entire /texmf{-local,} part  
optional); or (b) move the texdoc.tlu script, and any other scripts  
that might need to find texmf.cnf in a similar way, up one level in  
the hierarchy.

Or I suppose we could create a $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT variable, and add  
this to the mix. I don't expect that to be a popular idea, though!

Hi Jonathan,
it works here, in the repository as well on an installed system.

The SELFAUTO* variables apparently refer to the location of texlua,
not the location of script.

I installed the script
-------------------------------------------
#! /usr/bin/env texlua

kpse.set_program_name( "mktexlsr" )

print (kpse.var_value('SELFAUTOLOC'))
print (kpse.var_value('SELFAUTOPARENT'))
-------------------------------------------

like texconf.tlu and it returned:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux
/usr/local/texlive/2008

Regards,
  Reinhard

[re-sending on-list, sorry for the previous private reply, and adding a detail]

r8941 should fix this problem, though I'm not quite sure the root of the
problem is actualy fixed  (need to think a bit more about it).  Anyway, I
tested this on an OSX machine and it looks working.  Please complain if it
doesn't.

It's not you.  There's currently this problem on every non-linux unix
platform.  I'm working on it.

They shouldn't.  They should resolve to the location of the symlink you
called, or the location of the actual texlua exacutable, which should be the
same (namely Master/bin/<platform>). Then the texmf.cnf can be found.

I don't think either of the two is that good, because it puts restrictions
on where the scripts can reside.  The best way is to have texdoc work as it
currently does on Linux, by making SELFAUTO* depend only on the location of
texlua.

    Is it just me, or is there a problem with texdoc? 

It's not just you.  Manuel has been investigating it and I've been
kibitzing.  Here is a summary of our beliefs so far ...

It is a system-dependent problem in the derivation of the SELFAUTO*
variables.  This is why it works for Reinhard on (I presume) *linux and
fails for you on (I presume) darwin.

The ultimate cause is apparently that glibc provides the
program_invocation_name variable (used in kpathsea/progname.c), other
systems don't, and our code to compute it doesn't come up with the same
result as glibc.

It's not specific to Lua, either.  The same problem exists for Perl
scripts.  It only comes up this year because we never had symbolic links
going through .. before.

I don't think SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT would help (yuck, anyway :), because
the scripts could be at a deeper level.  There's no way to know in advance.

We obviously have to fix it somehow, but I admit I'm not exactly sure
how just yet.  Perhaps the tweak to texmf.cnf/paths.h, but I think the
best answer would be to fix progname.c so SELFAUTO* continue to be
defined as intended ... and if you (or anyone) wants to delve into that,
please do :).

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Zdenek,

I found that it is no so nice idea to put such small program as vlna
which serves for one (or two) language into binaries for everybody.
For that reason I put some years ago small scripts/programs into 
support/polish/ (including scripts which are similar to vlna and eg.
polish extension to makeindex).
Well, you can even find support/vlna* (rather old!), so please update it.

Friendly,

By the way, do you know how to avoid this warning?  Even if it doesn't prevent
from compiling, I don't like to have warnings (and this one doesn't look nice
at all indeed)...

Yes, that helps - thanks!

One other issue: the default viewer commands for unix-like systems in the script are not appropriate for OS X, where it's not "standard" to have X11 and any X-based tools installed. I'm sure there's a way for users to override these settings, but it would be good if the built-in defaults worked wherever possible.

A suggested patch follows; I'm don't know if "os.name" is the best thing to test; that was just a guess as to what might be available, but seems to work here.

    By the way, do you know how to avoid this warning?  

I will remove the check from the Makefiles at some point.  It made some
kind of sense with teTeX, but not with TL.

    A few months ago t was decided to provide vlna executables
    for all platforms.

Executables for all platforms won't help much; I'd have to create some
kind of special infrastructure to make use of them.  What would be
better is to include the sources in the TL source tree, so that it will
get included as part of the regular build.  This wasn't an issue with
the w32 vlna.exe since Windows is handled totally differently than
everything else anyway.

As for Staszek's point of whether they should be included in the first
place ... I don't know.  I guess I don't see any particular harm in it
-- we already include many hundreds of megabytes of language-specific
material (CJK, cbfonts, ...), and surely this is a big plus in general.
So a few language-specific executables, assuming they work with the
existing infrastructure, don't seem like anything exceptional?

Staszek, if you want to include some of your Polish scripts in TL, it's
ok with me.

That is on the (pre-release part of the) todo-list too.  At the moment,
there's no way for the user to configure things, and the defaults are actually
not suited to OS X (and even for other Unixes it could be good to have a list,
some people may prefer have acroread/evince/kpdf/whatever instead of xpdf).

I'm unfamiliar with the OS X world: is open supposed to always work, or should
we also test a list of programs on OS X (when the feature will be
implemented)? And, just curious, is the user able to configure which actual
program is used by open?

Thanks a lot.  I think os.name is indeed the right thing to test (there is
only os.type and os.name according to texlua's ref).  Commited, r8944.  Also
using os.type now.

People decide to use TeX because it serves for high-quality
typesetting. Several Czech and Slovak HOWTO documents say that
nonbreakable spaces are inserted by "vlna". Not having this program
would be bad because basic typographical (and even orthographical)
requirements could not be reached. If you think that you should not
provide such program for everybody, you can package it with collection
Czechoslovak. The program must be installed in $PATH, some users
invoke it from a toolbar button in their favourite editor, some users
invoke it from a command line.

As I implied, I don't dispute the desire/need for vlna.

My question was a practical one: where are the sources to vlna?  They
should be included in the TL source tree and built along with everything
else.  Can you incorporate it?  There is already source/utils/vlna, but
those are old sources.  Does it use configure now (I hope)?  Premade
binary executables are simply impractical to include in TL.

Hi all,
I have uploaded version 2.15 of Velthuis devanagari to CTAN. I would
be glad if it can be replaced it TL. The changes in the preprocessor
are not important, no matter if you do not manage to compile it on all
platforms. Windows executable is included in the package.

Hi Manuel,
I'm currently working on a generic config file parser.  It's supposed
to read a config file and put the key/value pairs into a Lua table. 

Are you working on something similar ATM?  Then please let me know.

	Hello,

> I'm unfamiliar with the OS X world: is open supposed to always work

  open is pretty much equivalent to double-clicking on an icon or a file
name in a graphic environment, and is based on file extension -- very
similar to the way double-clicking works on Windows; for instance, HTML
files are "open"ed by default in Safari (unless the user configures it
otherwise), most "graphical" formats (PDF, JPEG, etc. -- even
PostScript) are dealt with by Apple Preview, etc.

>               And, just curious, is the user able to configure which actual
> program is used by open?

  Absolutely; for any file and file type you can configure how it should
be used, by choosing from a drop-down menu -- again, very similar to
what you get on Windows (on my Desktop, the only file I have is Martin's
pdfTeX presentation at BachoTeX which, had it been opened with Acrobat
Reader instead of Preview, would have given him much less trouble ;-)

  By the way, Jonathan, I noticed you used open for DVI files, but I
don't think it would really work for most people: users would have to
not only get the X server running, but also to make the association from
DVI files to xdvi (or some other DVI viewer program), which seems rather
unlikely to me; I have the impression xdvi would serve more users.  Of
course, it still means you need to have xdvi in your path and to launch
X11.app, but I feel you would get a better hit rate with the latter than
with open.

Great.

I'm not working on this right now.  I wasn't actually decided about the best
idea, between a independent config file and something use kpse and texmf.cnf
(like previous versions of texdoc did, iirc).  The advantage of this second
approach is that we don't need to take care ourselves about the precedence

informed of your work !

In an ideal world, we shouldn't need to bother about dvi (and ps), since every
documentation should be available in pdf format.  There's currently 221 dvi
files in texlive: all of them are on my (mid-term) to-kill list :-)

Hmm! I for one completely disagree with you. DVI files are smaller ... while
kdvi is crap, xdvi is an excellent program ... it renders fast on the
screen, has every command available via keyboard accelerators ... in
particular, if I want to get to page 34, I type: 34g in the window ...
I can get resizing of the page also by say typing: 5s in the window.

For texdoc, I would much rather have my system find a DVI file and render
it with xdvi than it find a PDF file. Admittedly, most of what I want
to read is just text, with the occasional monochromatic diagram.

xpdf is not a bad program, but it is slower to render on the screen and
navigation requires the mouse. There's a nice feature that I can grab
text with the mouse and paste into another document, which I can't seem
to do with xdvi. Of course there are other nice features of xpdf and
even the slower-to-render acrobat reader (I'm not a fan of kpdf), but
for simply reading a document and quickly navigating to a page, nothing
beats xdvi. 

The only advantage of PDF is its universality ... every OS these days
has a reader, generally already installed ... and so, yes, I put all
my web files up in PDF ... but this is quite limiting, I'm forever
having to do clean-ups to avoid running out of space. PDF files are
so much more memory-hungry.

I even prefer PS to PDF ... I suppose that makes me a dinosaur ;-}

I thought a little about this, but I believe "open" is the better  
default for na?ve users. While the OS does not have any standard  
viewer for .dvi files (open will report that the system doesn't know  
how to view them -- I forget the exact wording), TeXShop does support  
them (by converting to PDF on the fly). The user doesn't have to do  
anything to configure this; the fact that TeXShop is present on the  
system, and claims support for viewing DVI, is sufficient.

There are likely to be many who do not have X11 installed, let alone  
configured to use xdvi, whereas many (most?) Mac TeX users -- all  
those who install the MacTeX package, for a start -- will have  
TeXShop.app installed (even if they normally use a different  
environment).

I think those who install TL manually and don't have TeXShop (or  
TeXniscope or another "Mac-hosted" viewer that provides DVI support),  
and/or specifically prefer to use xdvi or similar, can be considered  
the more advanced, technically-inclined users who may be expected to  
do some extra configuration. Those who simply double-click the MacTeX  
installer should have an out-of-the-box experience that "just works",  
as near as we can manage it. IMO, using "open" gives the best chance  
of that.

PDF are standalone.  In my ideal world, CTAN would carry PDF, and an
installed TeXlive would carry everything that can be represented by DVI
in DVI: TeXlive documentation does not need to be standalone.  The fonts
and stuff for viewing are there.

Huh?  Switch "Modes" to "Text Selection" and then you can do this with
the mouse.

... but dvi is *not* a document exchange format, eg because it doesn't embed
fonts.  While this can work for most dvi if the font is widely spread (say,
cm) this can also make some documents totally unusable.  Just for this, dvi
shouldn't be the standard format.

Also, when I read a big documentation, I really appreciate things like pdf
bookmarks, that no dvi viewer that I know can use.

> particular, if I want to get to page 34, I type: 34g in the window ...

With xpdf: g34<enter> :-) But I agree with you that there is no really good
pdf viewer atm.  xpdf is the less bad imo.  Anyway, I don't like xdvi either :-)

Well, we provide sources: you can always compile dvi versions of your

You make the real point here.  TeX Live is not only for geeks and hackers,
it's also for "normal" users, and those want to see pdf, because it's a
standard, they already have a reader and are used to it.  Dvi and ps look like
strange formats to them and it's yet another barrier to enter the TeX world.
We should get rid of it.

By the way, a similar choice has been made on CTAN, which favour pdf
documentation.  Since we try not to process documentation ourselves, but
rather use the version on CTAN, it's another point for pdf doc in TL.

No.  The normal users want to see texts and not worry about the format
it is in.  And if they have a viewer which is an order of magnitude
faster and integrates with their editor (source specials), they will
certainly prefer that.

The "user" does not look at "strange formats".  He clicks on files and
buttons.

CTAN is a different matter.  It is an archive, not a complete system.
Standalone files make sense there.

DVI is quite impractical: each dvi driver supports its own set
of \special commands. I don't know a program that inspects
the specials in the DVI file and can say, that the DVI file
doesn't use specials, or it uses specials for dvips only, or
it uses specials understood by dvips and xdvi, ...
Also pages aren't independent anymore and can't reordered in general
if specials are used (color stack, ...).

Yours sincerely

There may be a little problem with very few packages: say animate.pdf
requires Adobe Reader to see animations correctly and no other
pdfviewer can handle javascript. Another little problem (probably
endemic to MacTeX) is/was that if documentation was in ps or dvi and
it was in the directory where user had no write privilege and viewer
was TeXShop, it behaved funny. In both cases user may be needs to
locate the document and open it in viewer different from the default
one. I think that the normal user should be able to do this but I know
that the average user is not able.

MacTeX 2007 based on TeXLive 2007 had a lot of help links mispointed.
It looks like these links were consistent with CTAN rather than
TeXLive structure. I do not know if this problem was endemic to MacTeX
but it was really annoying. Again normal users tackled this problem
but average could not.

Anyway, that's what "can be represented by DVI" was supposed to mean.
Most .dtx files will compile to special-free DVI.

but a tiresomely large proportion rely on fonts that are "unusual".

i can (usually[*]) cope with this, but i wouldn't expect the average
user to...

r

[*] there are fonts that just don't compile at all, notably those by
alan stanier.  i now have his permission to deal with these, but have
only managed one so far...

Any decent printer has a manual feed accepting many paper formats not
wider than letter.
Things go differently if you want to print on larger paper. In Canada
ledger printing (17" * 11") is widely available say in Business Depot
stores. But above this one should go to specialized places and price
skyrockets.

  Hi all,

  I'm looking at a following URL.
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/kpathsea/

(1) "texmf.in-teTeX" seems to be useless.
    Is it a histrically important file ?

(2) In "texmf.cnf" there is 4 lines which contains
    both TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFDIST at once.

% cat texmf.cnf | grep LOCAL | grep DIST
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFSYSVAR;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST
TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST,!!$TEXMFDOC}
%   SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST

     The priority does't seem to be consistent.

  "MAIN, LOCAL": in TEXMF and TEXMFDBS
  "LOCAL, MAIN": in SYSTEXMF and comment of SYSTEXMF

    According to the last discussion (thank you for the discussion),
    http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2007-November/015074.html
    "MAIN, LOCAL" should be the right order.
    Then SYSTEXMF and its comment should be modified, I guess.

They probably don't worry about the format, but they certainly do about the
viewer.  And most of them are used to a pdf viewer, but not to a dvi viewer.
 Something like xdvi looks very strange to someone just discovering the TeX
world.

Anyway, I don't know which kind of "normal" users you know, but the "normal"
users around me (most of them phd students in math, using TeX daily) do
prefer their documentation in pdf.

But TeX live is far from independent of CTAN.  If there are pdfs on CTAN,
there will be pdfs in TL.  Anyway, I don't see the point in using a
non-standalone and non-standard format just because we could...

The viewer is an order of magnitude faster and offers instantaneous
looking class functions and rulers for fine layout control.  It
integrates with editors via Source Specials (meaning that one could
visit .dtx files at the right line with a click in the DVI file,
something which would be _very_ handy for source2e.dvi, for example).
The files are an order of magnitude smaller than PDF files.

This is not a matter of "just because we could".  It's usability.  In
contrast to the PDF files, however, the DVI files should not be checked
into the Build tree, but rather built from .dtx fresh.  That way, things
like relative source special directories and actually available fonts
and stuff can be assured at build time.  In short: one should make best
use of the fact that DVI files are not standalone, but integrated into
the system.

It may well be that we don't have the resources to do this now.  But
that does not mean we need to pretend that it would not be useful.

  On Leopard: No application knows how to open /Users/arthur/texput.dvi.
I believe the message was different on Tiger.

  I didn't know that.  I agree that open is probably the best choice, in
that case.

You can use Skim to view dvis and pdfs as well, strongly recommend to try

Actually on MacOSX if you have foo.hoho you can ask for info, then
look at open with and select, and then tell the System to open all
.hoho files with this application

Is this useful for documentation?  And by the way, this could be integrated
in a good pdf viewer.  (Eg, the pdf viewer from TeXshop and the viewer in
TeXworks have a looking glass feature...)

Source specials will soon be available in pdf too.

Another important thing is accessibility.  PDF is more accessible to most
people than dvi.

Well, so I guess we need a complete build dependency system for DVI
documentation?  Why not, but I certainly won't write it or maintain the huge
database needed in order to achieve proper compilation of a reasonable part
of it.  I already have enough work getting things to update from CTAN
smoothly, even without generating doc, thanks.  If you want to write and
maintain such a system, please go.

IMO, what would be really useful is that someone writes a nice, fast, usable
and well TeX-integrated pdf viewer.  I'm just afraid that fast is a hard
point, due to the format...

Only reverse search, not forward search.  And "soon available" has been
the statement of every Omega2 talk in the last 15 years or so.

Tagged PDF.  The output of PDFTeX isn't.

But the hard point is not made easier by ignoring nice, fast, usable and
well TeX-integrated dvi viewers.

You would say that.  Ok, using hyperdvi might be useful.  Anyway, I am
somewhat startled at the amount of hostility connected with this topic.

I just tried "port install texlive_base" on an iMac with Leopard, and
the compile
didn't run into any problem, so there is something very strange wrong with your
build

I don't see the relevance of Omega2 schedules or (non-)delivery.  
SyncTeX support, which provides source-special-like functionality  
independent of the output format, will be in both pdftex and xetex  
engines for TeX Live 2008 (and derivatives), as are the components  
needed by viewers or editing environments that want to support it.

Is there such a viewer available on, and well integrated into, all  
the major TL target platforms? xdvi, for example, may be well TeX- 
integrated, but it's not well Mac-integrated or well Windows-integrated.


Personally, it makes little difference to me which format is used.  
But I think it's clear that PDF is the de facto standard for fully- 
formatted documentation, and I think TeX is best served by  
integrating with the wider computing world as much as possible rather  
than (by default) living in its own parallel universe.

Expert users are of course free to use other formats and other tools  
that may serve them better, but let's not impose our specialist  
approaches on B.~L.~User in cases where he has already-familiar tools  
that can serve the purpose.

Wow! ... so it can! Thanks David. I've been using expert mode with xdvi
for so long (and the most recent version on one system I work on only
has xdvi 22.40v from teTeX, which seems to be 6 years old, and as far as
I can see doesn't have that feature), that I missed the development. I'm 
glad I chimed in ;-) ... and learned something new.

I concur.  It is important that people new to tex and that haven't managed to
get things working have access to the documentation.  Also, the TeX
community has to maintain/support xdvi, while other people are looking
after pdf viewers.  Time is better spent encouraging those other people
to avoid breaking things related to TeX.  I can get by without .dvi, but
don't take away my pdf viewer.  Finally, some people use TeX (lit. prog.)
for software.  Compute servers may provide TeX, but often don't have X
headers, so you are limited to X apps the vendor provides.

I am aware that usual printers are able to print on many different
sizes. But I'm sure that all the derivatives of A0, including B and C
series, are hardly ever "standard" sizes, they are just sometimes
"printed on also". Things would be different for me if the habit of some
country would be to print on a really different format, something
between A5 and A3, with completely unrelated height and width. 

Like letter paper... ;-)

Postcard doesn't sound like a standards size for an office or someone's

Hi,
it's quite interesting to see that we have the same discussion every
year.  Same suggestions, same objections, same results.

Exactly that's the point!  If anybody is willing to write a script which
creates DVI files from the sources it's sufficient to put it on CTAN.

Message-ID: <20080624080727.GC18829@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all,

just to give you a short notice:

We have switched the whole hyphenation system of current TeX Live to use
the new hyph-utf8 pattern submitted to CTAN, thanks to Mojca, Arthur,
Jonathan.

These patterns are now used for all formats.

That switch brought also a new feature, namely that language.def is now
also handled in the same way as language.dat, so xetex/pdftex etc will
have the same languages available.
 
That brought loads of changes in the tlpsrc, several new hyphen-*.tlpsrc
have been  created, and and the inclusion into the collections updated,
some have been split etc etc.

That would BTW be a good time to think about better placement of some
languages ...

Anyway, please report any problems you might encouter.

Best wishes

Norbert

It is the standard paper size for contracts of all sorts this side of

I don't know how many lawyers use TeX, but it would be cool to ensure
that it is easy for them to do so.

Even improving just the typography of thier prose would be a huge

    "MAIN, LOCAL" should be the right order.
    Then SYSTEXMF and its comment should be modified, I guess.

I updated texmf.cnf accordingly.  Thanks for noticing.

Best,

Excuse me, what about

texdoc_formats = set_listvar_from_texmf(texdoc_formats,'TEXDOC_FORMATS')
for format in list_iter(texdoc_formats) do
   viewer_var = 'TEXDOC_VIEWER_' .. string.upper(format)
   texdoc_viewer[format] = set_var_from_texmf(texdoc_viewer[format],viewer_var)
end

I admit that this is not *user* specific, but at least Jonathan's
concern can easily be addressed by the local admin this way. Moreover,
on many systems there are generic commands for viewing a file, IIRC
there's even one for OSX - and then usually the individual user can
change the preferences on the OS level, not only for TeX.

It would of course be good to have something like this, and take out all
this from texmf.cnf. But for TeXLive 2008, shouldn't we stick to what we
have?

There was in fact an install-tl.log created but it was in the
installatuon directory rather than the current directory (as always
happened with a completely failed installation). Nevertheless, it
contained no reports of the failures.

Message-ID: <200806242126.m5OLQshn015813@comp.uark.edu>


Dear TeXLive Developers:

I have been testing the win32 version of install-tl found at
www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/install-tl.zip

These are my observations.

I unpacked install-tl.zip, copied the resulting directory tree
to C:\TLtemp\ changed to that directory and ran install-tl.bat
without arguments. I expected a console mode program, but a GUI
window appeared (which was OK). I selected scheme-basic and
gave C:/TL2008 for the base directory. I toggled letter paper to
Yes, and the remaining 3 choices to No (don't create formats, don't
download macro documentation or sources).

I tried this a few times on several different days (downloading a new
instal-tl.zip each day). This always failed. The first couple of
times it halted at trying to get luatex.tar.lzma, which it said it
could not find. Other times it proceeded to postinstallation processing
and complained of a file not found. Usually this was either
  C:/TL2008/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.us,
or
  C:/TL2008/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
The console output simply froze after displaying an error meassage
plus several messages pointing to lines in various perl files/modules.
The files complained about did indeed not exist.

When I pressed CTRL-C in the console, no .log file was created.
If I pressed the Quit button in the GUI window, the log was created
but it didn't contain the error report. In neither case was I able to
find out what the URL actually resolved to. The log file contains only
   http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/
There were several console messages that looked like
   tar: : File not found in archive
These message did not appear in the log. They never mention any file
name. I tried to get more verbose poutput using install-tl with the
debug options -d -dd or -ddd, but that only produced the help screen
and never started the installation program.

I also tried using the -url option, selecting http://www.ctan.org.
This time the installation proceeded farther. Right up to running
updmap-sys, which produces the following output for several files
(backslashes all were indeed doubled):
  dir /b: No such file or directory
  dir /s: No such file or directory
  C:\\TL2008\\texmf-var\\fonts\\map\\dvips\\updmap\\download35.map

Those files do actually exist. Moreover, psfonts.map, etc., do
seem to be correctly and newly created. Thus these messages seem
bogus.

The last few lines on the console were:
Seting default paper to letter
C:/TL2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/texconf.tlu:42 module 'texlive.getopt' not
   found:
    no field package.preload['texlive.getopt']
    no file 'C:/texmf/scripts/texlive/lua/texlive\getopt.tlu

The slashes are exactly like that. The file
   C:\texmf\scripts\texlive\lua\texlive\getopt.tlu
does in fact exist.

The GUI window then said it was finished. Clicking OK ended the install
but no log file was created. Afterward the current shell's PATH variable
was unchanged. The master PATH variable, however, was changed: the old
texmf bin directory was removed and the new one placed on the end.

Exiting and restarting the shell put the new PATH into effect. Running
updmap-sys had exactly the same screen output as before. However,
timestamps on the files show they were in fact newly generated.

The default paper setting that failed at the end of the install
could be run successfully by creating a universal script starter
named texconf.bat and running that. I later found that I could run
   texlua C:\TL2008\bin\win32\tl-w32-wrapper.texlua texconf
but that does not work if the "C:" is omitted!

No, please excuse *me*, I answered too fast.  Actually, when I switched to the
texlua version of texdoc some time ago, I noticed that the old variables
TEXDOCVIEW_pdf etc stopped working, so I thought the feature was removed, but
 I was wrong.

> I admit that this is not *user* specific,

Hmmm... really?  Unless I missed something, kpse takes its values from all
texmf.cnf files (which can be user-specific in TEXMFCONFIG), and also from
environment variables, so on the contrary this is user-specific if the user
wants to.

Yep, i can be addressed by the local admin as well as the user, and this is
good news.  I think it is even best if we can provide good defaults for many
systems, in order to for things to probably "just work" out of the box, but
it's good that the viewers are easy to configure.

Is it that good to take things out of texmf.cnf?  A very handy thing with
kpathsea is that it takes care for us of precedence when variables are set in
multiple config file or environment variables.

But of course some things must be moved out of texmf.cnf, like rm_command,
since as Reinhard obeserved those are system-specific.

Wait, when did you do the tests? Could it be that the archive creation

Hmm, I cannot reproduce that. Got the current install-tl.zip, unpack,
start install-tl.bat, select scheme-basic, c:/TL2008, letter, all other
options toggled off. Install worked fine, generation of updmap, too. No
complains.

Strange.

I can only assume that CTAN was in the mirroring process when that
happened, so that problems did occur.

Can you retry?

I don't know how long did the mirroring process lasts, but I had mirror
problems installing from network on my linux box 2 weeks ago. All was
magically solve once I used the -url option.

Perhaps I don't understand how mirror.ctan.org and the installer work, but I'm
under the impression that different mirrors can be used for each package: in
case the mirrors are not perfectly in sync, what is found on a mirror will
possibly not match the texlive.tlpdb from the first mirror.

Is it possible to just pick a mirror at the beginning, then stick to this
mirror to the end?  This should avoid coherence porblems and help to identify
possibly broken mirrors.

That is a temporary problem until we release. Sorry for that, but after
that there will be not sooo profound changes (I hope).

I disagree.  There will be changes in texlive.tlpdb each day we update a
package (that is, probably every day).  If the content of one mirror's archive
for a package doesn't match what is described in another mirror's
texlive.tlpdb file for this package, what is going to happen?

And in theory, there should be no difference between theory and practice :-)

But we will probably *not* ship that immediately??? Well, we haven't
decided on a policy anyway.

Nothing in fact. The package is downloaded and installed, there is no
checking of actual files etc.

THe problem mentioned by the OP is completely different and strange, the
missing language.us is really suprising, because nothing has changed
there since ages ...

we can suggest a "give me a url" service to the guy who runs
mirror.ctan.org -- he's a good guy, and tries to help as much as
possible.

will raise it on the ctan list.

mirrors that _aren't_ get pruned from our database (which
mirror.ctan.org uses).

however, without the tight coupling we have between the main ctans, you
can't hope for mirrors to be closer than 12hrs out of date, on average.

(if someone proposes a mirror frequency >24hrs, we tell them to go back
and think again.)

Ok, I will.

But here are some questions. Given that I see messages from tar
between messages that say some package is being installed, I assume
the script calls wget and then lzma and then tar for each archive.

1. Does wget cache the url provided by mirror.ctan.org and reuse it with
each download, or does it use literally mirror.ctan.org each time
(possibly accessing different mirrors)?

2. The install-tl set-up provides perl, wget and lzma. I have all three
of those installed on my system as well as TeXLive 2007. Could any
of those accidentally get invoked instead of the provided ones? If so,
I could disable them temporarily and see if it makes a difference.

3. I really think the log of the session should include error messages
if possible. It should also contain the mirror actually chosen, if you
want a report on misbehaving mirrors. Is any of that possible?

Does it?

$ cat .texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf
MYTEXMFVAR = bar

ls: cannot access .texmf-config/ls-R: No such file or directory
$ kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMF

$ kpsewhich --var-value=MYTEXMFVAR

$ kpsewhere texmf.cnf

/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

Or is it just our Debian compilation which messes this up?  I always
thought that only one texmf.cnf is read, since it must be read in order
to define the paths to look at, and its search path is hardcoded in the
binary? 

Hm, I see that we do some Debian specific things here, there's a comment
in our texmf.cnf:

% This definition isn't used from this .cnf file itself (that would be
% paradoxical), but the compile-time default in paths.h is built from it.
% The SELFAUTO* variables are set automatically from the location of
% argv[0], in kpse_set_progname.  
% 
% The TETEXDIR stuff isn't likely to be relevant unless you're using 
% teTeX, but it doesn't hurt.
%
% For security reasons, it is better not to have . part of the path.
% 
% Since tetex-bin_3.0-22, it restricts this to dirs that actually exist,
% to silent e.g. automounters:
TEXMFCNF = /usr/share/texmf/web2c;/usr/local/share/texmf/web2c

I don't see how $TEXMFHOME could be added here, though.

I don't know whether it is a good idea to have parts of texdoc's
configuration in texmf.cnf (except the definition of the doc paths,
which are also used by other applications), and parts elsewhere.

That sounds already quite interesing. Could it be that your tar does not
support some options? Can you send me the output of tar --help and tar
--version?

Fine.

It worked when I tried it here, so it must be something different, or
specific to your mirror. Maybe we can fix this by staying with one
selected mirror.

Subject: [tex-live] Bug#488038: texlive-base-bin: kpsewhere weirdness
Message-ID: <877icdmhix.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Package: texlive-base-bin
Version: 2007.dfsg.1-4.np.etch.1
Severity: normal

[By the way, Norbert, your etch backport of the package has a higher
version number than the lenny version. I've switched to lenny meanwhile,
but I still have the backport installed until 2007.dfsg.2-1 reaches
testing. Better use ~ in the version number]

kpsewhere acts very strangely here. It looks as if the whole concept of
kpsewhere flawed, maybe only in newer web2c/libkpathsea versions? 

Or is there a Debian-specific breakage?



$ kpsewhere texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

It does *not* find an other texmf.cnf file I have, nore other duplicate
files. 

$ ls .texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf
.texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf

So I investigated what kpsewhere does:

$ tail /usr/bin/kpsewhere 

IFS=':'
for file
do
    for path in `kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMF'`
    do
        eval TEXMF=\$path kpsewhich $options \"\$file\"
    done
done
exit 0
$ IFS=':'
$ for path in $kpsepath; do echo $path; done
/home/frank/.texmf-config
/home/frank/.texmf-var
/home/frank/texmf
/etc/texmf
/var/lib/texmf
/usr/local/share/texmf
/usr/share/texmf
/usr/share/texmf-texlive

That looks good.

$ for path in $kpsepath; do eval TEXMF=\$path kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMF; done
/home/frank/.texmf-config
/home/frank/.texmf-var
/home/frank/texmf
/etc/texmf
/var/lib/texmf
/usr/local/share/texmf
/usr/share/texmf
/usr/share/texmf-texlive

That too, but

$ for path in $kpsepath; do eval TEXMF=\$path kpsewhich texmf.cnf; done
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

This behavior doesn't only show up with texmf.cnf, the same with
fmtutil.cnf (with and without --format='web2c files').

Dear River Valley people,

(Kaveh, is that you?)

Thanks for the upload of elsarticle, but there is one strange thing:

BUT: The source of the elsdoc.pdf is unfortunately missing. Is there any
way to fix that?

I am not 100% sure about that, but putting a .pdf under LPPL I would
assume that the source should be shipped, too.

It would be great to have that documentation included, and I am talking
here as TeX Live maintainer now.

It does use literally mirror.ctan.org again and again.

The problem is catching the error output of all these scripts ... you
don't want to know how much time we already spent with banging our head
against windows ... sorry, non of us is professional programmer, and I
see not enough time to play around with that currently.

But I keep it in mind/on the todo.

Yes and no.  texmf.cnf files are never user-specific and are not
searched in TEXMFCONFIG.  The only exception is if you set the
environment variable TEXMFCNF, but I pray for years not to do this
because it is more confusing than helpful.

A variable in texmf.cnf can be overwritten by an environment variable.
This also works if a perticular variable is not defined in texmf.cnf.
I didn't know this before, but:

   texdoc hyperref

starts xpdf and

   TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF=acroread texdoc hyperref

starts acroread.

No, the following texmf.cnf files are read (in this order) if they exist: 

(1)  /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/texmf.cnf
(2)  /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/texmf.cnf
(3)  /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf.cnf
(4)  /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

Variables you set in a particular file are *not* overwritten by files
which are read later.

The default is (4).  If you have to customize texmf.cnf, the best thing
you can do is to put only the variables you want to change into (3).

(1) is quite useful for system dependent configuration.  On
multi-platform installations you could create a file
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/win32/texmf.cnf on the server which
contains the single line

  OSFONTDIR = $SystemRoot/Fonts

and this only affects Windows clients, even if (3) contains the line 

  OSFONTDIR = /usr/share/fonts.

Maybe what you said depends on the expectation that there can be
user-specific texmf.cnf files in TEXMFCONFIG.

I personally prefer a config file, for instance
$TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf.  texmf.cnf is not very useful for
user-specific stuff.

   Reinhard

    Could it be that your tar does not support some options? 

Doesn't our installer use only our own self-provided tar (and wget and
perl) on Windows?  So Dan's installed versions wouldn't be relevant.

Given all of Dan's reported download problems, I rather suspect what was
downloaded was corrupted, hence the "file not found in archive".

Did we put in a test to see if a downloaded file was actually usable
(could be decoded by lzma + tar)?  I know I asked for that, and I also
know I never implemented it myself :(.

    Maybe we can fix this by staying with one selected mirror.

This would clearly be desirable anyway, to avoid version skew among
mirrors.

Meanwhile, -url is the way to go.

Thanks,

As I can recall from your previous mails, You are installing on windows.
I only suspect that TEXMFCNF env. variable set by TL2007 installer can 
mess the final steps of the TL2008 installer. perl, wget and lzmadec
are provided for TL2008 and they work internally, that is they are
not seen and available for other tasks.
On the other hand we had so many changes in the TL's structure last days,
so please start your testing again. Eg. 2-3 days ago I also encountered
missing language.us.def, but that was cured shortly.

All the best,

    Perhaps I don't understand how mirror.ctan.org 

Just so it's clear: http://mirror.ctan.org is pretty simple.  It looks
at the requesting IP, looks at the list of available mirrors, and picks
a close one, using the "standard" Perl packages to do the job.  It is
hosted by Randy Kobes at Winnipeg, who does some similar things for CPAN
and GNU.

So yes, every time http://mirror.ctan.org is called it can (and often
does) return a different mirror.

Hopefully we'll get a way to stick to a single mirror per install ...

Ok, not exactly as Reinhard said: it reads all texmf.cnf's that it can find
using its compile-time defaults, or the $TEXMFCNF variable if set, but setting
is variable is bad.

Oh, but another observation of Reinhard gives us a possible solution: there
are platform-specific texmf.cnf's too...

No, you're right, it's a bad idea. Better stick to one solution or the other.
And since there is non user-specific texmf.cnf, probably a texdoc.cnf file is
better.

Yep, and I think those features are really cool. Do you think it is
possible/easy to achieve the same result with a system-wide texdoc.cnf, and a
user-specific texdoc.cnf using your Lua parser? (Sorry, I had to time to look
at it atm, but I'll do very soon.)

I am about to ship out the sources too within a couple of days.  It
needs a bit of fine tuning since I want people should be able to
compile the sources perfectly although it compiles correctly in my
junkyard like Linux box.  I was in a hurry to send the class to
Elsevier as it was nearing the delivery date.

Sure, I will do it within one or two days, since I know the legal

ARe you sure? Debian contains dvi2tty 5.3.1 ...: from COPYING therein:

by looking at the copy on ctan (v4. something).

the authors obviously stopped bothering with mainstream tex sites after
their 1990 upload.

what's debian's upstream?  or is it a debian-only package?

we tend not to put things on ctan unless the author's asked us to.

can tex live use the stuff on a random web site as upstream?

It looks like list members are confused between dvitty and dvi2tty.
The former was written in 1987 by Svante Lindahl, and its Pascal
source code says

 * This program, and any documentation for it, is copyrighted by Svante
 * Lindahl. It may be copied for non-commercial use only, provided that

 * EAN:  zap at cs.kth.sunet

A Web search turns up multiple mentions of Svante, but I could
not readily find a home page or current e-mail address.

dvi2tty is a different program, written in C instead of Pascal,
and authored by Marcel J.E. Mol <marcel at mesa.nl>.

Better stick to stuff that can be found on CTAN -- people are used
to looking there for newer versions, etc., and there is sort of
understanding that things you use from TeX Live should be
available for as long as you might want them (that is, until the
book is finished).  Random web sites aren't expected to stick
around that long.

Of course, now that dvi2tty has been in TL2007, anyone who uses
it will expect it to appear in TL2008.  When you are going to
break people's expectations, it is generally better to do it
sooner rather than later, as there is more time to repair the
damage.

They should be handled with care.  The more texmf.cnf files you have,
the more difficult it is to keep an overview and to fix problems.
TeX Live will not put any texmf.cnf files into the platform dirs for
this reason.

I also recommend system administrators to think twice before making
use of this feature.  It's generally never a good idea to spread
config files over the whole system.  But it's a nice feature if you
have no other choice.

BTW, I also wouldn't make the variable rm_command configurable.  We
can rely on the luatex function os.type() here.  Frank, I suppose that
you made it configurable because you had been unsure whether your
platform detection code is reliable enough when you wrote texdoc a
year ago.  But meanwhile Taco added the functions os.type() and
os.name() to texlua which make things easier and more reliable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

it may be a different program, but it certainly started from (one

It's not difficult to add such a feature.  I would simply do not add
new key/value pairs to the table if the key already exists.

You misunderstand. There was no difference in the outcome whether I left my 
tar in PATH or removed it.  These messages occured whenever I used install-tl 
without an -url option. My guess is install-ltl always manages to use the supplied 
tar. 

Still, problems with previously installed versions of software in windows can be 
minimized in two ways:
 1. When PATH is modified, put the new directory(ies) on the *front*. This
    is already violated by install-tl.bat
 2. When possible, call programs by explicit path. (However, one cannot be sure in 
    that case what happens if those programs call further programs.)

That happened with early tests, but there was an explicit message
from the installer so I removed TEXMFCNF. (Would that all the other 
problems had so easy a diagnosis!)

I ask you to update to FreeType 2.3.7 ASAP after I've released it

on Ubuntu the following bug was filed:

Is this still true? Does babel expect british or UKenglish?

That would effect TL2008, too!!

Thanks for any comments!

The kurier fonts have actually bin in 2005, and also in the current svn
repo I can find them. I searched a bit through the logs but couldn't
find anything specific.

Can anyone remember why/what?

That is really fine. Thanks a lot. I understand being under pressure, so

Hi,
Karl removed them as well as some other files in order to get the
stuff on a CD.  No idea why the removal doesn't appear in the log.  
I think that the other files came back again through the package 
updates.

That's me, who removed Kurier from TL2005 because of lack of space on CD.
In fact, Kurier is identical to Iwona font, and only shows (for font's
fans) how the original was made, eg. it contains "ink traps":
  Kurier was intended for linotype typesetting of newspapers and similar
  periodicals. The design goals included resistance to technological 
  processes destructive to the letter shapes. As a result, amongst others, 
  the typeface distinguishes itself through intra- and extra-letter white 
  spaces as well as ink traps at cross-sections of some elements 
  constituting the characters.

For TL2008 it was reverted, anyway.

Best,

Message-ID: <200806272245.m5RMjIBx004267@comp.uark.edu>


I have done some additional testing of install-tl for WIN32.

[Previously I had determined that one needs to find a working
  mirror and use the -url option to select that mirror. I had also
  established that one needs to remove the old TeXLive2007 bin
  directory from PATH. This was done in all the following discussion.
  Also removed my own versions of perl, tar, wget and lzma.]

I successfully installed texlive-medium. Formats were automatically
and successfully generated. The only non-routine messages were
warnings from tar:
   "Unrecognized file type '2', extracting as ordinary file".
this happened for several man1 pages. This was harmless as there are
no programs to display the man pages anyway.

I successfully ran tex, latex and pdflatex several times. I also ran
tplmg and successfully installed the cm-super package.

- There was this serious bug: Registry entries are changed!!!
   I did not appreciate the fact that the rather inadequate psv
   program was substituted for gsview as the default for opening
   PostScript files. This should never be done without requesting
   permission and it should certainly not be done without informing
   the user.

- There is a second serious bug: Uninstalling TeXLive did not undo
   those registry changes. I took me quite some effort to determine
   how to change them back.

Finally, for no apparent reason, install-tl.bat has completely
ceased to work. There is a complaint of uninitialized value at
line 1388 of TLutils.pm, followed by much more. I will retry
and if it continues, report more details. I should add that
I did this immediately after installing and uninstalling texlive,
*using the same* downloaded installation package as worked before.
I also downloaded a new install-tl.zip and the same happened.
I suspect something weird has happened to my system, but that
may be paranoia.

Dear Dan,
what do you mean with "the rather inadequate psv program"?
It's the most powerful PS/PDF viewer I've ever seen.

This is not needed. As I wrote before, TL uses those programs 
(including small subset of perl) internally and there was big effort done
to let people having them for all other tasks.

People can use their own man pager, or read man pages in emacs.
And well, the warnings are harmless, as win32 doesn't understand symbolic 
links, so tar unpacks all such links as regular files.

Sure, but TL cannot provide gsview as it is not free software, so we 
decided to put much faster psview. Making the default association for
opening .ps files is always matter of disscusion. Anyway, I'm going to 
update psview this weekend (finally added help in English and much more).

Thanks for noticing that. Siep, would you please remove also registry
key for psv when uninstalling?

Message-ID: <4A03991E-9483-44CD-91CC-698172294483@ambertext.co.uk>

Hello

I thought I'd try out the TeX Live 2008 test release, as I'm quite  
keen to get up to speed with some of the newer stuff (particularly  
LuaTeX) before I run a pilot TeX workshop in September. However, I  
have had problems getting hold of the release.

I downloaded the bootstrap installer, but when I ran install-tl, the  
furthest the download/installation process got was adrconv. Earlier,  
it didn't get that far, but it consistently falls over there now when  
downloading from my local mirror (I'm in the UK). I also tried

   install-tl -url ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev

with slightly greater success: it got as far as bin-context on one  
run. Unfortunately the process isn't (as far as I know) resumable, so  
I have to start from scratch each time. Is this a temporary problem  
with server loads, or is there anything else I can try?

Incidentally, in case it's relevant, I'm doing this on an Intel Mac,  
and the only customisation I did each time was to set the TEXMFHOME  
directory to ~/Library/texmf (for consistency with the MacTeX 2007  
distribution).

Thanks for your help.

Hi
I am a long time LaTeX user that has recently installed Fedora 9 linux,
which includes the TeX-Live distribution.  It looks fantastic, many many
more packages than tetex.  However, Fedora does not come with the
documentation under texmf*/doc !!!!  I really need at least the PDFs and
HTMLs in those subdirectories but I am unable to use the
texlive-doc-2007-30.fc9.i386.rpm due to all these dependencies-- I
really just need the PDFs at least.  Is there anyway I can get or ftp
your documentation that is on your website at:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/doc.html
That is exactly what I need but downloading each one from your website
would be very tedious. 
Thanks for any help, and thanks for a great distribution!

That still wouldn't restore the original file association with
gsview, although users could do that by reinstalling gsview. Trying
to restore a previous file association would be messy. It would be
better to make the psview file association an install option.

With respect, they are not "harmless" : /all/ warnings
worry the intelligent user, and many less intelligent
users as well.  Warning messages /should not be issued/
unless there is something requiring user attention.

I want to second Dan's perspective here; (a) the installation
should not change default associations, and (b) if it does (!),
it /must/ seek the user's permission before so doing.

Hi Dan, hi all,

I am leaving for one week mountaineering, so I will not be able to work

That is true, and unfortunately we can probably not do anything against
it. THat are symbolic links and they are extracted on unixish systems
correctly, and on win32, since it does not support symbolic links, as
copies. That is the correct behaviour.

Options to deal with that would be:
- replace all sysmbolic links with copies 
  seems to be a good idea since we are not talking about huge amount
  of files.
  Karl: What about when we build the .tar.lzma that we somehow try to
  follow symlinks for all but files under bin/? Files under bin should
  remain symlinks, otherwise loads of things will probably break.

- other option would be to filter the stderr messages and issue only
  those not matching some known good ones ...
  The problem with that is that capturing of stdout/stderr on win32
  is as close to impossible as possible. It is just deadly horrible.

Several points here:
- TeX Live cannot ship gsview, it is non-free
- psv is definitely more advanced than gsview (and much faster)
- it is right that psv should NOT overwrite already existing 
  file associations

Siep: Is it possible to change the code in TLWinGoo so that
- (add) if there is already an association just leave it untouched
- (remove) if there is a file association with a different program
  leave it untouched

I guess you meant that it didn'r re-associate gsview with ps files. THat
is true. But it should have removed the association of psv with
postscript files?

Siep: Does the remove routine remove also the *definition* of postscript
files (so the association of .ps with PostScript Files)? That we
shouldn't remove at all.

That is fixed. But there is a different bug at the end of the
installation.

Do you still have a WORKING .zip file? If yes it would be great if you
could send me that per email.

I have no idea because nothing has changed in this area since ages, but
suddenly it does not load Popup.al while it was doing that.
On Unix it loads without problems, only on win32 not.

So I am sorry for the current status. The problems with the mirror is
something painful, and I don't know what to do against it. Rewriting the
installer that the installation can be resumed is not possible for this
year, definitely. All my tests with win32 running in a virtual machine
and downloading over the virtual network worked without any problems.
And my test installation viw mirror.ctan.org, too. So it seems that you
have some rather crappy mirrors around you.

The other issues we will try to resolve ASAP, but since I am leaving for
one week don't expect too much during these days. Maybe Siep can fix the
file association thingies, and if someone has an idea regarding the
Popup.al ...


Best wishes

Norbert

I got the impression that only Vista implemented symlinks properly,
but only for ntfs.  Earlier Windows versions do have reparse points
and junction points, but using the within TeXLive looks like more
trouble than it is worth. E.g. under w2k, the tools for working with
them aren't part of the default install.

I have also done more testing:

1.  install-tl.bat using wine 1.01 on Fedora 8 (miktex works under wine)

This failed with messages about "unitialized value" -- probably the same
problem reported below.

2.  install-tl on native Fedora 8

I tried 3 times over 2 days using the mirrors -- each time the install died
with an error extracting a .lzma file -- the file had length zero.   I didn't
have time to check the wget settings.  There were no saved settings to
restart the install, and each time it started over from the beginning.
In the present form, the mirror mechanism is not robust enough to
handle a full install.   The installer should be able to restart from the
point of failure.  I suspect the state of CTAN mirrors in N. America
is not up to the task -- the problem will likely get much worse come
September.   I did try to monitor which mirrors where being used
and install-tl seems to rotate among the usual .ca mirrors.  I'm
in Nova Scotia where connections to Europe are often better than
to the rest of N. America.

The installer appears to download one archive file at a time, install
the files, and delete the archive.  What about keeping the archives
until the install is finished (most PC's have ample disk these days,
but there could be an option to delete archives as you go)?
If the installer is restarted, the archives that have already been
downloaded can be used (with some checks to detect partial
downloads).

This is too much to expect -- install-tl needs to make sure it
runs the included versions.

I agree that there needs to be better control over registry changes.
At a minimum, the log needs to record any changes that are made.
Perhaps it should create a script that the user can review before
making the changes.

Testing at this stage should be done with a virtual machine or wine
where you can just blow away the whole windows system and start with
a fresh/clean version.  On linux with wine it is a simple matter to
create a separate user account for tl testing -- all the registry
settings are stored on $HOME/.wine, so you can start clean
by removing the .wine tree.

I suspect the problem is with install-tl, but unless you can start with
a fresh windows installation it is difficult to say what state windows
might be at.

Where is that defined?  From what I read in pathsearch.c, it seems
texmf.cnf is found in even more places:

/* The very first search is for texmf.cnf, called when someone tries to
   initialize the TFM path or whatever.  init_path calls kpse_cnf_get
   which calls kpse_all_path_search to find all the texmf.cnf's.  We
   need to do various special things in this case, since we obviously
   don't yet have the configuration files when we're searching for the
   configuration files.  */

and in pathsearch.h:

/* Like `kpse_path_search' with MUST_EXIST true, but always return all
   matches in a NULL-terminated list.  */
extern KPSEDLL string *kpse_all_path_search
  P2H(const_string path, const_string name);

So why isn't texmf.cnf found in any TEXMF tree?

I'll certainly look at them if you find them, but they won't be used

Yes. I already suggested making the psv file association an install

We can leave that in place. I am a bit fuzzy about what
gsview does. I seem to remember having seen both PostScript and
psfile.

And I have to decide what to do with user settings vs. system
settings; always a headache.

OTOH, this kind of stuff is why we need real testers.

Thanks a lot for answering! As far as I know, Iwona was derived from 
Kurier, so they are similar, but they are not the same: Compare for example
	http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/iwonalc/iwonalc.png
and
	http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/kurierlc/kurierlc.png
to see differences.

Yes, no need to repeat that, we have heard that often. It is not
possible.

Again, not possible. "Should" there are many, please write the code!

Right.

install-tl *uses* the shipped tar/wget/... and nothing else.

Call the uninstaller. It removes everything which has been created. The
only problem is that it possibly removes PostScript associations when
they have been present earlier.

Yes I am quite sure that it is a installer problem, but I have no clue
whatsoever what is the problem ... I wrote that in the last email.

Unfortunately nothing ATM. As long as the mirrors are that bad and
connection breaks down on every download, I have no idea how to fix
that.

Please see the discussion on this mailing list, there is quite a long
thread (in fact more) on this topic.

Not important.

Sorry, the problem is that the download does not work. In this case we
cannot do much.

The other is that resuming an installation is currently not supported.

The one I tried was downloaded Thurs. AM.   I'll try to make time for another
test.

If you are using wget you can try adjusting the tries = NN value (the first
one I tried had tries=2) in install-tl/tlpkg/installer/wgetrc.   Curl probably
has some similar option.

There are similar problems with linux installers, but they tend to download
all the archives first, and delete them only after a successful install.  Then
using a downloader that skips already downloaded files, restarting will
work, although there is still the issue of having to redo configuration
on each restart.

I just grabbed the latest install-tl.  wgetrc still has tries=2.  I
increased that
to tries=20 and had success (using Fedora 8 linux) with a minimal
install in just
one try (wish I had done that on Thursday!).

Subject: [tex-live] non-interactive installation?
Message-ID: <B8D39572-CB86-45E1-8086-741D5B5CFD89@fis.ucm.es>

I'm trying to write a bash script for non-interactive installation of  
TeXLive, along the following lines

# /bin/bash
export TEXMFHOME=~/Library/texmf
export TEXDIR=/usr/local/texlive/$(date +'%F')
echo i | sudo .../install-tl

This used to work just fine in TeXLive 2007, but now the script's  
variables ($TEXMFHOME, $TEXDIR, etc.) are not picked up by install-tl.  
Could somebody instruct me as to how to pass these variables to  
install-tl? By the way, I tried to use the current guide in texmf-doc,  
but it's awfully outdated (it's still the January 2007 version).

Thanks everybody,

This is the only open-source utility for
manipulating symbolic links under Win-32
that I have been able to locate so far.
I haven't looked inside (mainly because
it all seems to be hidden inside something
called "SVN") but it is stated to be
open source under the GNU Public Licence.

Hi Norbert,

  find texmf -type l

found 22 symlinks in the texmf/doc/man/man1 directory.  Are these the
only culprits or are there other ones?

They are actually avoidable if a groff macro is used instead.  This
macro had been used by getnonfreefonts-sys.1 for three years now and
it obviously works reliably:

$ cat texmf/doc/man/man1/getnonfreefonts-sys.1
.so man1/getnonfreefonts.1

Emacs can display the manpage in woman mode (woman means "without man").
That means that Emacs understands the ".so" macro even on Windows when
man and *roff aren't present.

Disadvantage:  Though a symlink is only an entry in an inode, a
               regular file requires a data block.

Advantage:     Nothing else has to be changed.

And a data block which contains only a few bytes of text and the rest
of the data block is filled up with zero-bytes can be compressed as
efficiently as a symlink.  

I assume that the changes have to be done in the Build tree.

Karl, what do you think?  I can try to create and upload the needed
files.  This will have no effect before the Makefiles are adapted.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] New UTF-8 hyphenation patterns (& Serbian)
Message-ID: <6faad9f00806281731q4f597a9eu64ff92988c7d29d3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Before I start with my question - everyone is invited to test the new
hyphenation patterns. They are going to replace the old patterns in
TeX Live 2008 (almost completely), so it would be really desired to
test them a bit more before release. They are also already part of
MikTeX, but we haven't heard any feedback from MikTeX users so far.
    http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=hyph-utf8


However, nobody of us is entitled to solve this without others' opinions.

Serbian can be written either with Latin or Cyrillic. "serbian" in
language.dat was pointing to Cyrillic patterns until now, but babel
uses Latin labels for the language. I'm not sure if loading Cyrillic
patters for Latin texts is a good idea. Can anyone explain some
history behind that?

Do we need Cyrillic patterns at all? May we map Latin patterns to
Serbian instead of Cyrillic ones?

One argument against having Serbian Cyrillic patterns included by
default in language.dat is that there is no babel support for it, and
if we simply add an entry into language.dat, no Serbian user will ever
know it existed. And if someone unsatisfied with the name comes after
several years, he'll have to keep that name for the sake of "backward
compatibility" for zero users.
(To make it clear again - patterns for Serbian will be shipped in any
case, but the question is - should they also be enabled?)

It would be nice if some Serbian user would step forward and request
them, offerisg some suggestinos & testing as well.

Some more facts:
- srhyphc was done by transliterating shhyph + some minor
modifications, and the author is not accesssible.
- shhyph had the wrong licence until recently, but the author has
fixed it and also provided transliterated patterns for Cyrillic script
himself.
- now the two cyrillic files with should-be-the-same-content have tiny
differences, and we have no idea which one should be loaded (if loaded
at all).

Thanks,
    Mojca

The only reason for a non-interactive installation is that you have to
install TeX Live on many machines.  The recommended procedure is:

  1. Install TL on one machine.

  2. Copy the file <installdir>/tlpkg/texlive.profile to your USB stick.

  3. Run install-tl -profile /path/to/texlive.profile on all the
     other machines.

BTW, you can adapt texlive.profile to your needs by either using a
text editor or a shell script.  The only limitation is that you have
to know what you are doing.  But adding something like '$(date +'%F')'
should be doable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    wgetrc still has tries=2.

Obviously I don't know what you "grabbed", but I changed it to tries=4 a
couple days ago (and that is what is in the install-tl zip/tgz).

    to tries=20 and had success (using Fedora 8 linux) with a minimal
    install in just one try (wish I had done that on Thursday!).

Very interesting.  I had expected that if something failed with a couple
of tries, trying 20 times would simply be a useless waste of time.

FYI, the mirrors are not "that bad".  As has been discussed before, CTAN
monitors mirror status and deletes dead/unupdated ones.  Furthermore,
mirror.ctan.org does not redirect to known-bad ones that have not been
deleted.

At this point, I think the problems are more due to not sticking with a
single mirror than anything else, and (as you know, Norbert :), we are
working on that.  Clearly the process is unutterably painful as things
stand, which I expected but am still quite discouraged about.

But if someone succeeded to download 99% of the stuff, he is certainly
more happy with tries=$\infty$.

I do not see any good reason to divert from the default values
provided by wget.  It seems that they are good.

No. I replace the install-tl.zip every day I run a test.

I didn't test it seriously but, on first opening, its window
is about 1 inch square. One file I viewed showed the page
sideways upon opening. Gsview displayed it properly. Gsview
is also more than just a viewer. Perhaps psview has similar
capabilities, but I don't see any need to learn it.

Things may be different in the non-windows version.

Also gsview is orthogonal to TeXLive. Psview ceased to
work when I removed the TexLive 2008 bin directory from
the path.

FreeType 2.3.7 has been released.

It is available from

    http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/freetype/

or

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3157

The latter site also holds older versions of the FreeType library.

See below  for the  relevant snippet  from the  CHANGES file; users of
version 2.3.6 should upgrade.

Enjoy!

----------------------------------------------------------------------


FreeType 2  is a software  font engine that  is designed to  be small,
efficient,  highly   customizable,  and  portable   while  capable  of
producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap
font formats.

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.7 and 2.3.6

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - If the library  was compiled on an i386  platform using gcc, and
      compiler  option -O3 was  given, `FT_MulFix'  sometimes returned
      incorrect  results   which  could  have   caused  problems  with
      `FT_Request_Metrics'   and  `FT_Select_Metrics',   returning  an
      incorrect descender size.

    - Pure CFFs without  subfonts were scaled incorrectly  if the font
      matrix  was  non-standard.  This  bug  has  been  introduced  in
      version 2.3.6.

    - The  `style_name'  field  in  the  `FT_FaceRec'  structure often
      contained  a wrong  value for  Type 1  fonts.  This misbehaviour
      has been  introduced  in  version  2.3.6  while  trying  to  fix
      another   problem.   [Note,  however,   that   this   value   is
      informative only  since  the  used  algorithm to  extract  it is
      very simplistic.]


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Two      new      macros,      FT_OUTLINE_SMART_DROPOUTS     and
      FT_OUTLINE_EXCLUDE_STUBS,  have been introduced.   Together with
      FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS (which  was ignored previously) it is
      now possible to control the dropout mode  of the `raster' module
      (for B&W rasterization),   using  the   `flags'  field   in  the
      `FT_Outline' structure.

    - The TrueType bytecode interpreter now passes the dropout mode to
      the B&W rasterizer.  This greatly increases the output for small
      ppem values of many fonts like `pala.ttf'.

Hi,

plain luatex in TL-2008 by default produces dvi. Shouldn't it better
start in pdf mode (as pdftex does)?

I downloaded install-tl-unx.tar.gz from a mirror site yesterday, but
looking at the dates,
there is nothing since Jun 13th.  The install-tl.zip has newer files.
 This morning,
the files on ctan.tug.org were newer than the ones I downloaded from a mirror
yesterday.

Well, I have not been able to do a full install even with tries=20.  I tried
the default (mirror) and also a couple North American mirrors (twice each).

I think the net installer should come with the caveat that it only work with
reliable access to a CTAN archive.  Failing that, there is the DVD or a
local mirror on your site's intranet (see below).

We use wget (ftp) at work to grab remote sensing images (typically
a few 100 MB) from a (restricted) NASA site.  Approximately 1% of
the downloads fail.  All this is using one very big and very reliable
server.  The failures are the result of packets not being delivered,
resulting in a timeout.  I think the timeout is controlled by the TCPIP
protocol, not any wget parameter, and the best metric for the chances
of a problem is the number of hops to the server.

I tried just downloading files (at home, different provider from work) from a
couple N. Am. archive sites using bare wget (linux, default settings) and never
made it past the b's.   I was, however, able to get all the files with a few
restarts using "wget -N .." (which skips already downloaded files).

I tried putting the downloaded files on the local apache server:

$ du -sk tlnet/tldev/tlpkg/
1008980	tlnet/tldev/tlpkg/
# ln -s /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlnet /var/www/html

$ ./install-tl -gui -url http://localhost/tlnet/tldev

This worked, and xetex is creating pdf's with letter paper,
but now context is creating a4 pdf's (perhaps my fault, as
I put the 2008.06.11 version in texmf-local).

Other observations:

install-tl claims to support debug flags -d -dd -ddd, but they don't work:

I notice that install-tl uses /tmp.  On some sites, users are not allowed to
write in /tmp.  Generally they will have something like TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp.
I'm surprised that perl doesn't respect TMPDIR.

ConTeXt is ignoring most of TeX-live configuration. Even if you enable
Sanskrit hyphenation pattterns in TeX Live, you cannot use them with
ConTeXt without adding support to ConTeXt itself.

If you need letter paper by default and do not want to \setuppapersize
in each document, put
    \setuppapersize[letter][letter]
into cont-usr.tex.

TeX Live doesn't set that for you automatically. One of the reasons
might be that it's much easier to tune such settings in ConTeXt than
it is in LaTeX, though I might be biased :) :) :)

Better to avoid all such symlinks in the first place.
Yes, the symlinks in bin must be preserved.

Excellent.  

    I assume that the changes have to be done in the Build tree.

It is not necessary (and would involve much too much changes to upstream
files I think).  There is nothing automated that does that update
anyway, and I can adjust my semi-automated checking scripts, etc., to
account for this case.

So please just replace the man symlinks in texmf/ with the one-line .so
files. 

Thanks.

  I think Karl's intention was to have luatex produce DVI by default and
three symbolic links to it, with pdfluatex loading the plain format and
producing PDF, lualatex loading the LaTeX format and producing DVI, and
pdflualatex loading the LaTeX format and producing PDF.

Right.  By analogy with tex/pdftex and latex/pdflatex.  However, if the
LuaTeX crew prefers something like luatex/dviluatex, I won't insist,
though I think the latter would be surprising to many people.

We won't ever be able to change it again, so now is the time ...

    lualatex loading the LaTeX format and producing DVI, and
    pdflualatex loading the LaTeX format and producing PDF.

Yeah.  Gotta check if the hyphenation stuff works now that hyph-utf8 is
there ...

    TeX Live doesn't set that for you automatically. 

Now that we know what to do, I expect the installer can add that to
texmf-dist/tex/context/config/cont-usr.tex easily enough, along with the
other paper size files it already munges.  Thanks. 

    easier to tune such settings in ConTeXt

It's not about perl, it is about our code.  And yes, it should use

I disagree that that is the only reason.  Non-interactive installations
are easier to document, easier to explain to friends, easier to work
into other scripts, and so on.  I like them.  Anyway.


Artemio, obviously we did not try to preserve the old installer's
behavior of inheriting environment variables.  (I did not actually know
it did that; doesn't seem like such a great thing, actually.)

So, you'll need to do the whole thing as a here document, including
setting the directories, <r>eturning to the main menu, etc.  That's what
I always did for my testing.

Best,

    Thanks a lot for answering! As far as I know, Iwona was derived from 
    Kurier, so they are similar, but they are not the same: 

That is what Staszek explained.  Iwona is an improved version of Kurier.
There seems no reason, except perhaps historical, to ever use Kurier.
So we deleted it when we were trying to save space.  But it is back
now.  So good :).

It should do it ...

code from TLUtils.pm:
sub get_system_tmpdir {
  my $systmp=0;
  $systmp||=getenv 'TMPDIR';
  $systmp||=getenv 'TMP';
  $systmp||=getenv 'TEMP';
  $systmp||='/tmp';
  return "$systmp";
}

SO it tries first TMPDIR, then TMP, then TEMP, then /tmp ...

I recently tried to download the TeXLive 2008 developer snapshot.  I'm
using a MacBook Pro with Mac OS X 10.5.3.  The installation proceeded
rather well until I (accidentally) put my computer to sleep in the
middle of downloading something.  I killed the installation script and
resumed it, but I've run into trouble:

  $ ./install-tl -url ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/tldev

The script then dies.  What might be going on?

Hi Mojca, 
no, the reason is that the code we currently have does the same as
Thomas' texconfig script.  Context paper sizes had never been
supported there.  I don't know why, but I suppose that Thomas
discussed it with Hans already.

It's also required that there is something in the config file to
change.  If you want support for Context then it's necessary that
there is the line

     \setuppapersize[a4][a4]

in cont-en.tex already.  This should better be done in the Context
distribution, otherwise it's too likely that it gets lost during the
next update.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Karl,
they are still supported.  I just tried TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX and
TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME and they work.

See the function set_texlive_default_dirs() in install-tl.

    they are still supported.  I just tried TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX and
    TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME and they work.

Artemio wrote about setting TEXDIR and TEXMFHOME.  I was answering his
question as asked.  I forgot about the envvars above.

Artemio, it would seem you can use the envvars Reinhard mentions instead
of scripting those settings.

Hi Jesse,

Thanks for trying.

      Unknown directive ...containersize 728... , please fix it! at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 206, <$retfh> line 24.
    The script then dies.  What might be going on?

Norbert is severely hacking the downloading stuff right now to try to
deal with the various problems people have reported, and it seems tlpdb
and the code are out of sync in one way or another.  Everything will get
remade in a few hours and will hopefully be better then.

Best,
karl

Mojca, Arthur, Jonathan,

many thanks for your great work concerning hyphenation patterns.
After my tests and discussion with Jacko and Marek I am going to remove 
plhyph.tex from TL and change just one line in mexconf.tex.
All changes (including .tlpsrc) will be done in a moment.

Ps. Cc to the texlive list intentionally :-)

I'd vote against it.  At least AUCTeX (and presumably other TeX shells)
will prepend "pdf" to commands intended to produce PDF.  I don't see
that it buys us anything to change the established behavior known to
existing TeX shells.

I need a hook in the file in order to put code into it.  I suppose
that \setuppapersize is only allowed between \input context.tex and
\loaduserspecifications.  I could use "\loaduserspecifications" as a
hook and prepend \setuppapersize to it, but I'd like to hear Hans'
opinion first.

Wrong file. Do not touch cont-en.tex, please. The correct file
for system-wide configuration is cont-sys.tex, and the distribution 
contains an example of such a file for you to rename & edit (the
distribution will never ever contain an astual cont-sys.tex itself).
The example file is tex/context/user/cont-sys.rme, and the canonical
location for cont-sys.tex is that same directory.

Cont-sys is loaded at runtime, so there is no need to regenerate the
context formats after creating it, just mktexlsr is sufficient.

Best wishes,
Taco

Hmm, when I wrote this code I hoped that it is never needed and system
tmp files can be avoided, at least on Windows.  The reason is that
TEMP on Windows contains USERPROFILE.  The latter contains the name of
the user, and last year we got a bug report from a Chinese who had
Chinese characters in USERPROFILE.

The problem is that Perl needs forward slashes as directory separators
and converting \ to / works reliably with ASCII or UTF-8 only.

Hans told me that there is another temp dir on Windows which is
writable by everybody: %SYSTEMROOT%/temp (c:/windows/temp).  This
would avoid the problems but someone has to confirm that it exists and
is writable by everybody on Vista too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Like pdfomega (pdflambda) and pdfXeTeX (pdfXeLaTeX) you mean? :P

Mojca

PS: sorry, only a provocation. DVI mode is probably problematic in
LuaTeX as soon as one wants to use any reasonable fonts (it might even
make sense to load OTF LM fonts by default for example), but I agree
that luatex might be interesting for the sake of lua alone.

Subject: [tex-live] supposedly missing Popup.pm
Message-ID: <200806292307.m5TN7vf26076@f7.net>

For anyone who might be able to debug the "missing" Popup.pm on Windows
while Norbert is away, I put two old versions of install-tl.zip at

http://tug.org/~karl/install-tl-0607.zip
http://tug.org/~karl/install-tl-0617.zip

(I found these on out of date CTAN mirrors, BTW.)

We don't know when the problem started exactly, but perhaps comparing
these to the current install-tl.zip will glean something.  There has
never been a Popup.pm, instead the Popup.al is supposed to get loaded.
We don't know why it suddenly stopped being so.

If anyone can help, that would be great.

THanks,
karl

Hi Taco,
I'm not familiar with Context at all, hence one more question:

Should I modify

% \enablemode[\systemmodeprefix letter]

or 

% \setuppapersize[letter][letter]

?

Does Context insist on this directory?  We have to move the file to
TEXMF[SYS]CONF because the texmf* directories are read-only on the DVD.

Message-ID: <10027715.1214791707850.JavaMail.root@web38>

Downloaded the texlivetest2008.iso.lzma, decompressed it, modified my
bash build script for the new menu scheme, and built a Slackware package.

Could not find any 'AddPackage' utility, so just copied the extras
needed, oberdiek and revtex, to the build directory. (What happened
to that feature?)

Everything works fine plus the new package is 1/2 the size of 2007.
(Must have had a lot of unncessary cruft before.)

Installed minimal scheme plus basic latex. Result is a 12 MB tl.tgz
file. No complaints.

However, I am using a little over 1% of the texlive distro, so why
pull down the full shebang? I then spent lots of time with the online
installer. Total failure!

On each attempt to download the 92 essential packages after some
random number, but, never all, the executable, install-tl, would
quit indicating a failure to install that file package. I do not
know perl so I can not go further to help.

I wrote a custom $HOME/.wgetrc, actually several versions, but the
perl script never saw it. I think it's a wget issue, but, I can not
track it down.

Last year I sent an email hoping you would provide a xdvik-motif
binary as an option to the ugly xaw version. Do you want my custom
build? It is actually a lesstif build, but, it works great and
looks heaps better than xaw.

Omega has no PDF mode, so AUCTeX does not allow similar use of PDF-mode
and  Omega-mode.  XeTeX is not yet supported in AUCTeX.  If we support
it, it will likely be similarly mode-locked.

Engines that do not even have a DVI/PDF choice can get along with a
fixed command.

Most definitely.  That's why it would be very good to have a working
lualatex command in TeXlive2008 if we can manage it.  Even if it
interprets utf-8 input via [utf8]{inputenc} for now, namely as a sick
combination of active 8-bit characters.

I personally do not care about the names of the plain & latex formats.
CC to Hans and Hartmut just in case, but I do not expect they will have
strong feelings on the subject either.

Best wishes.

i'd say

luatex    -> plain + dvi
pdfluatex -> plain + pdf

Any location that can be found by kpathsea should work, but _if_ there
is a TEXMF tree below TEXMF[SYS]CONF, it would be nice to have it in the
expected subdirectory.

Not needed. This line could be used together with documents that
have support for both paper formats. It defines a macro that can be
tested against by such documents, it does not do any setupo itself.
Such documents are very rare and even so: whether or not setting
the 'mode' is a good idea is open to discussion. I suggest leaving
this line alone.

Definately this is needed, this is the main page/paper switch.

If you want an explicit default, it is:

   \setuppapersize[A4][A4]

notice the uppercase A.

There are many more paper formats predefined, so if you need to know
any others, please let me know.


Best wishes,
Taco

TeXLive::TLWinGoo::global_tmpdir. I did some testing: under Vista it
isn't even globally readable for a non-administrator. Neither is it
readable a domain- (=non-local) user on my XP roaming-profile
virtual machine.

However, TEMP and TMP contain short names. So TEMP and TMP are
probably ok, unless they have been user-modified.

I would add some sanity checks, e.g.:

sub get_check_tmpdir {
  my $tmpdir = $_[0];
  -d $tmpdir or return '';
  -w $tmpdir or return '';
  -x $tmpdir or return '';
  $tmpdir;
}

sub get_system_tmpdir {
    my $systmp = '';
    $systmp ||= get_check_tmpdir getenv 'TMPDIR';  
    $systmp ||= get_check_tmpdir getenv 'TMP'; 
    $systmp ||= get_check_tmpdir getenv 'TEMP'; 
    $systmp ||= '/tmp';
}

I have temporarily commented out the psview file associations
altogether. Users have a several alternatives anyway for viewing a
PostScript file with psview: opening the file from within psview, or
drag-and-drop, configuration from within a latex-aware editor (the
same is true for gsview).

Proper removal code would also have to check whether it is still the
original file association, and not a later override from gsview.

I didn't keep track of them all (can't paste from the wineconsole or from
the systems at work)   I think it is more of an "internet" glitch problem,
which is probably more a function of the number of hops, and
sometimes limits on the number of ftp connections.   From home
I have had fails with:

ftp://tug.org   > 19 hops, 11 just to reach New York
ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca 20 hops (apparently umanitoba)
ftp://ftp.math.purdue.edu 18 hops
ftp://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca 18 hops
ftp://ftp://gentoo.chem.wisc.edu  18 hops

ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca sometimes doesn't allow ftp connections,
which suggests a limit on the number of connections.   Purdue
is the one I use the most.

btw -- ctan.releasenotes.org seems to be server.vergulhos.com.br, but is
only 16 hops, while the gateway for the NASA site I use is 14 hops.

Forget that comment -- TMPDIR was not being set on this system.
Sorry for the noise.

Isn't that last ("/tmp") going to fail under Windows
(no drive letter) ?  If the current directory allows
the necessary access, it might be better to actually
/create/ a tmp sub-directory under the current working
directory, then delete it at end-of-exercise.

But surely by definition, mirrors can (and will) be out
of synch with "the master" until such time as they have
mirrored.  During that at-risk period, any job that takes
parts from different mirrors will be liable to fail with
an inconsistency error :-(

Why not use Perl's File::Spec?:

From
tmpdir

    Returns a string representation of the first writable directory
from a list of possible temporary directories. Returns "" if no
writable temporary directories are found. The list of directories
checked depends on the platform; e.g. File::Spec::Unix checks
$ENV{TMPDIR} and /tmp.

        $tmpdir = File::Spec->tmpdir();

I tried this for linux and for wine's simulation of XP using the perl
from install-tl (with wine it is important
that TMPDIR not be set to the linux path, as perl will attempt to use
that).  Wine gave c:\Windows\temp:

C:\install-tl> type try.cmd
@echo off
rem test of perl's tmpdir
set TMPDIR=
set tlroot=%~dp0
set tldrive=%~d0

%tldrive%
cd %tlroot%

rem we need wget in the path, so add tlpkg\bin to the path
set pathsave=%path%
path %tlroot%tlpkg\installer;%path%

rem use provided Perl

set PERL5SAVE=%PERL5LIB%

set PERL5LIB=%tlroot%tlpkg\installer\perllib
"%tlroot%tlpkg\installer\perl" %tlroot%try.pl


C:\install-tl>./try.cmd
testing File::Spec->tmpdir()
tmpdir: C:\windows\temp
C:\install-tl>type try.pl
#! /usr/bin/env perl

#tmpdir
#    Returns a string representation of the first writable directory
#    from a list of possible temporary directories. Returns "" if no
#    writable temporary directories are found. The list of directories
#    checked depends on the platform; e.g. File::Spec::Unix checks
#    $ENV{TMPDIR} and /tmp.

use File::Spec;
print "testing File::Spec->tmpdir()\n";
$tmpdir = File::Spec->tmpdir();
print "tmpdir: $tmpdir\n";

It would be helpful if the install-tl archives had some
internal file that records the version so we can avoid
discussing problems that have been addressed.  If
there is a Changelog file that would be nice, as we
can see what changes have been made, but just
a small text file listing the problems that have been
addressed and implications (e.g., does it require
a new tlpdb file) would be helpful.

Were the failures due to download problems, as in:

$ ./install-tl --gui --url=ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev
[...]
Tk::Error: Downloading
ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/tlpkg/addlines.tar.lzma
did not succeed, please retry! at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 732.

The installer provides a wgetrc, so it never looks at ~/.wgetrc.

Most distros do have dvi viewers built with motif or gnome or kde.
There is some advantage to having basic statically linked versions
in TL that should work reliably on most linux systems.   What are the
issues with a viewer from the linux distro?   I know some people
are nervous about installing both "real" TL and a distro's TL.
In practice they can coexist, but will use different texmf trees so
fonts installed in "real" TL may not be available to the distro's
dvi viewer.   Some systems will allow you to install a
.dvi viewer without the full tex system, but I imagine they
would install some texmf tree for fonts.

On my Fedora 8 with TL2008, /usr/bin/kdvi first looks in
fc-cache but eventually loads fonts from the TL2008 tree
to display .dvi files. kdvi is not part of any TeX distro on
Fedora.

$ which tex
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/tex
$ strace kdvi story.dvi
[...]
open("/Data/opt/tex/texlive/20080628/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/cmsl10.pfb",
O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 12
[...]

It would be nice if there were mechanisms to ensure
that other dvi viewers get fonts from the tex system
that is currently being used.   It is probably easier
to do this than to ensure that TL viewers will be
compatible with the different GUI environments, but
it might require some cooperation from the various
developers.

Subject: [tex-live] texlive-xetex and accents bug
Message-ID: <227393.82880.qm@web43137.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I noticed a bug in texlive-xetex package that is shipped with Ubuntu 8.04 (texlive-xetex 2007.dfsg.1-2), but today I noticed that this exists in openSUSE 11's package too (texlive-xetex 2007-177.1). I reported this at: 

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/224787 

since I thought that's only in Ubuntu, but it seems that this is texlive-xetex bug in general. Description of bug is:


If using "\=" and "\^" commands for accents after which later in the
word comes "-" with "xelatex" run, characters between accents and "-"
are repeated twice, so, e.g., if entered this: "Uj\=unul-eser" one gets
this as a result: "Uj?nul-nul-eser" instead of "Uj?nul-eser". Jonathan
said that this was a bug that was fixed around August 20, 2007, but it
seems that it is still present in Hardy version of texlive-xetex.
Choice of font doesn't influence the result, it is same for .otf, .ttf,
pfb. Plain LaTeX hasn't this problem.
Note that in Debian Sid's repo (texlive-xetex 2007.dfsg.1-2) this bug was corrected.

Here's a sample code to test it:


Here is sample code for "xelatex" run:

\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{scrbook}
\usepackage[cm-default]{fontspec}
\usepackage{xunicode}
\usepackage{xltxtra}
\defaultfontfeatures{Scale=MatchLowercase,Mapping=tex-text}
\setmainfont{URW Palladio L}
\begin{document}
Uj\=unul-eser
\end{document}

I have tried in TL2007 and it works fine, no bug. Will try TL2008 soon
(I do not have it installed yet).

You don't mention the xetex version you are using.

Both TL2007 (This is XeTeXk, Version 3.141592-2.2-0.996 (Web2C 7.5.6))
and TL2008
(This is XeTeXk, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.999.0 (Web2C 7.5.6)) give the correct
result here (Fedora 8).

You might consider doing your own tests on TL2008 before it is
released so you won't get stuck with a bug for another year.   The
diversity in testing the more likely bugs can be fixed before
they are passed on to millions of users.

What dependencies?  Some of the docs are in .dvi format, so need
xdvi or dvips and fonts to be used.   There has been discussion
recently about using .pdf for everything, but it is not always easy to
convert .dvi to pdf, so you are probably stuck with the dependencies.

TeX Live 2008 is currently in testing, but there may be some delays
before Fedora packages appear.  On my F8 systems I have a minimal
texlive from the Fedora packages (because some pckages have
dependencies on texlive) and a full TL test with the docs for my own
documents.

Another option is using MiKTeX's package manager to
maintain a texmf tree with documents and updates.  You can either
compile mpm from sources or run it under wine.  If you collaborate
with WIndows users it is often useful to have access to the same
versions of macro packages, if only to increase chances that
your docs will compile on MiKTeX.

Message-ID: <19592730.1214835891130.JavaMail.root@web16>

SORRY. I just accidentally deleted your response to my email yesterday. (Got mixed in with a ton of junk.)

Downloaded the texlivetest2008.iso.lzma, decompressed it, modified my
bash build script for the new menu scheme, and built a Slackware package.

Could not find any 'AddPackage' utility, so just copied the extras
needed, oberdiek and revtex, to the build directory. (What happened
to that feature?)

Everything works fine plus the new package is 1/2 the size of 2007.
(Must have had a lot of unncessary cruft before.)

Installed minimal scheme plus basic latex. Result is a 12 MB tl.tgz
file. No complaints.

However, I am using a little over 1% of the texlive distro, so why
pull down the full shebang? I then spent lots of time with the online
installer. Total failure!

On each attempt to download the 92 essential packages after some
random number, but, never all, the executable, install-tl, would
quit indicating a failure to install that file package. I do not
know perl so I can not go further to help.

I wrote a custom $HOME/.wgetrc, actually several versions, but the
perl script never saw it. I think it's a wget issue, but, I can not
track it down.

Last year I sent an email hoping you would provide a xdvik-motif
binary as an option to the ugly xaw version. Do you want my custom
build? It is actually a lesstif build, but, it works great and
looks heaps better than xaw.

If you feel the dependencies are useless or the package may better be split
in smaller packages in order to reduce dependencies, you should fill a bug
report in Fedora's bug tracking system.

Well, if you don't stick to Fedora's packages, I think the better option for
now is to install a "vanilla" TL07, and later the TL08 (unless you feel like
beta-testing TL08 now).  I don't really see the point in installing mpm just
for the docs, it's rather usefull to keep thing uptodate (and will be
useless imo as soon as TL08 is released).

I set PERL5LIB in install-tl.bat, and don't treat @INC specially for
Windows in install-tl itself. The problem went away, but it is
completely voodoo.

Thanks for all the help with getting the pdfs. I am currently following the recommendation of Zdenek Wagner, which was a 'wget' command that he specified as:

wget -r -k -np -L -l 1 -N -p http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/doc.html 

It is working just fine.  The texlive-doc-2007-30.fc9.i386.rpm
had a bunch of dependencies on things like Perl(Tk), I suppose for some document searching tools so that users can find docs easier.  I do not need the tools, I just needed the documents (either pdf or dvi is fine). I think that for each package/sty included in the distribution, there should be the corresponding document (dvi or pdf or both) for the included package. I was surprised that Fedora 9 included TeXLive without including the doc directories.  Well thanks again for all the help, and the speedy responses. Long live TeX/LaTeX!!!

As Norbert noted there, the bug in Ubuntu will be fixed if/when Ubuntu
upgrades to a newer version of texlive-xetex.

This is a known problem.  Will certainly be fixed soon.

TL uses its own wgetrc, see tlpkg/installer/wgetrc.  But don't expect
too much, the problems can't be solved there.

Thanks George and Ralf. I mention this only to make sure people are aware of this. I installed texlive-xetex from Debian Sid and it works fine (at least on Ubuntu). I hope in 2008 it will be corrected.

BTW, version of xetex that I use on Ubuntu is:

XeTeX 3.141592-2.2-0.996-patch2 (Web2C 7.5.6)
