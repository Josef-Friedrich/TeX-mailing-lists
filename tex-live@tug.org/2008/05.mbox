Subject: [tex-live] Installing TeXLive2007 on OPensuse10.3 Linux
Message-ID: <308a1ed10805010033g53a02969xbe30e57d3d390139@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using opensuse 10.3 and in the old days, I used to install TeXLiVe from
opensuse software management without any problem but I just tried to install
TeXLiVe 2007 from a DVD on a new computer. By default, TeXLive2007 copied
all files to /usr/local/texlive/

and then I opended a shell and put the path as

>
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2007/bin/i386-linux:$PATH

 and then wrote

>texconfig paper a4
>fmtutil-sys --all


Ok at this stage if I say
>latex
for example it knows the command but if I close the terminal and then open a
new one or let's say if I restart the computer and open a terminal and say
>latex
then it does not know what >latex means.

So what can I do so that the terminal always knows the commands without
eachtime me giving the path?

Thanks

Hello,

If you want that path-extension to take effect only for you as user, then
you can put this line in your .bashrc or .profile. If you want it to take
effect for all users of the system, then you can create a new file
/etc/profile.d/texlive.sh with this one line or add this line to
/etc/profile.

If you want the latest and greatest texlive (trunk-version) as rpm-package,
then you could also try this: http://pmrb.free.fr/texlive/

Cheers, Peter

Subject: [tex-live] dvips removing characters from eps-file
Message-ID: <200805021044.57194.axel.struebing@le-tex.de>

Dear all,

I have got a problem with dvips producing invalid postscript with a special 
kind of eps figures.
In a minimal example just including one figure the problematic becomes clear.

Lines from the figure are altered after inclusion in the final postscript. 
These lines consists of binary data - IMHO - related to subsetted fonts. 

dvips discards bytes with 0x04 (CTRL-D) unconditionally as verified in the 
source of dvips (output.c) and mangled the bytes contained 0x13.

Could someone please explain the reason for this behavior to me or give a hint 
how to resolve the problem?

I would be glad to assist with further information if required.

which won't work for console logins, remote/ssh logins, ....

that's really a topic for shell setup, so .bash_profile and friends.

Okay, the real thing I am doing for this kind of stuff is the following : put
all the environment declarations in one file, say .env, and then source this
file in both .xsession and shell startup files (with a test to prevent
double-loading if you want, or source in only in the startup files for login
shell).

Well, if you like to run the compilation from your favourite editor and it
happens to be a graphical one that you don't run from a shell, you can have
problems too...

Hi TeX-live folks,

the bbm fonts do have a readme (bbm.readme, not readme.bbm which is for
the macros and fd files) from the old days which sounds as if the fonts
were intended to be free, but it lacks an explicit license statement
(and does not at all touch the subject of modification).

Therefore I'd like to try to contact their author, 

Gilles Robert. 

I haven't tried yet the e-mail address given in the readme, since it
points to the server of a university institute, but their homepage does
not list him as member of the staff.

Any ideas? He's listed in the math genealogy project, and there's a link
there to
http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/authors.html?authorName=651685&Submit=Search
which I'm not entitled to use - but I don't expect much from that.

TIA, Frank

Hi,

thank you for the explanation. To be honest, I already supposed 0x04 to be 
ignored for being CTRL-D/End of Job.
Although the postscript reference states that all data is allowed in 
readstring (this is my special case) I agree that these characters could 
cause all kind of problems for an application like dvips not intended to be a 
fully fledged postscript interpreter.

For French mathematicians, a useful resource is generally

At the moment, it points to
	Gilles.Robert'at'math.u-bordeaux.fr
Since he has been using this address recently on fr.sci.math, I hope it's the
good one. Otherwise, his other address
	Gilles(dot)Robert(at)ujf-grenoble(dot)fr
may be valid too, since his accout in this university looks valid.

Message-ID: <85od7nfri5.fsf@lola.goethe.zz>


Don't know whether this is the right place...  Anyway, here goes:  xdvi
has support for source specials and can display a looking glass and can
run like a server.

What would be rather nifty would be to have a version of xdvi that runs
completely unmapped.  Until I tell it "open a looking glass into text
source line xxx, so and so many percent into the total line length, and
do the looking glass thing until all mouse keys are released again".

In that manner, I don't need a permanent preview window open, but
instead can just ask Emacs to trigger the looking glass (which shows the
rendered file rather than the source text) at an appropriate place
associated with the current source position.  This functionality could
easily be used from terminal-only editors like vi.

Who do I ask for that?

Bonjour Gilles,

are you the author of the bbm TeX fonts?  If yes, I would like to ask
you for a clarification regarding their license.

Neither the font files nor the readme file contains an explicit license
statement. In the old days, it has mostly just been assumed that any
upload to CTAN is "free", but that is actually not the case, and today
we need to be more careful about that.

In order to be happily included in TeXLive or MikTeX, today the the most
popular TeX distributions, we would need an explicit license statement
which allows to use the fonts freely (even in a commercial environment),
to distribute them and to create and distribute modified derivatives. If
you want restrictions on modifications, in order to prevent different
fonts being around under the same name, you could use a license like the
LaTeX Project Public License. There are also specialized font licenses
(other people on the TeX-Live list, in Cc, can give you more
information).

We would be glad to hear from you and be able to clarify this.

Thank you in advance, Frank

the package is in both (current) tex-live and in miktex.

my reading of the "important notice" in the camel.dtx file is that the
licence is nosell, which i believe disqualifies it from tex-live
(certainly from most linux distros).

(i came across this while scanning for packages previously listed as
unknown licence.  i've changed the catalogue entry, but it's the work of
a moment to change it back if someone can defend a different conclusion.)

This problem popped up again last week.

Now that the metapost release includes the updated kpathsea from tl,
it no longer compiles out of the box on OS X 10.5.

Here is Hans van der Meer's diag/solution:

When I reposted that on the ConTeXt mailing list, Mojca responded with:

I would work on this if I could, but without access to 10.5 and with
unsufficient knowledge of autoconf, I have to pass. If nobody has
time and knowledge, then a warning in a README explaining Hans'
workaround is needed, I suppose.

Best wishes,

Don't confuse the PostScript interpreter with the communication
protocol used to transmit data to a printer.  Section 3.8 of the 3rd
edition of the PostScript Language Reference describes the interaction
between the interpreter and the communications protocol.  See
especially the sections "End-of-line Conventions" and "Communication
Channel Behavior" on pages pages 74-76.

In brief,

*) The PostScript interpreter is required to accept CR, LF and CRLF as
   end-of-line markers, but only in contexts when it's supposed to
   care about end of lines.  In contexts where it's reading binary
   data, it does not do any end-of-line conversion and CR and LF are
   treated like any other byte.

*) 0x04 (EOT) is an end-of-file marker for some (but not all!)
   communication protocols that can be used to send data to a printer,
   but the interpreter itself doesn't treat it any differently from
   any other binary character.

> Using binary
> data in EPS is a pain, you must be sure that they are correctly marked
> by structure comments, dvips may then treat them corretly. 

The problem is that dvips only recognizes one of the DSC comments that
signal the present of binary data, namely, "%%BeginBinary".  It
doesn't recognize "%%BeginData:" or "%%BeginFont".  So, if you try to
include an EPS file that has an embedded PFB file, dvips will happily
delete all EOTs from the font definition as well as normalizing any
"line end" it finds there.  This is unlikely to be helpful.

Incidentally, when reading PFB files directly, dvips knows how to
re-encode them as PFA files, thus avoiding binary characters.  It just
can't recognize a PFB file inside an EPS file.

We ran into this problem last year and I patched dvips locally to
handle "%%BeginData" and "%%BeginFont" correctly (well, more
correctly, at least).  I never submitted the patches, largely because
I wasn't sure how robust they are.  I'll submit them to the dvips
maintainers now.

> However, PS
> printers do not read the structure comments and printing may fail.

PostScript interpreters don't need the structure comments because they
already know from the code being executed when to expect binary data.

Subject: [tex-live] dviselect error: invalid empty DVI file created
Message-ID: <fvrorc$p06$1@ger.gmane.org>

To whom it may concern... :-)

I'm using dviselect and stumbled over an error in it, and a subtle 
problem in dvitype.

The error: If one uses a page specifier that does not exist in a 
file, an invalid DVI file is created.

Example: Take a DVI file from an arbitrary LaTeX file and call
   dviselect '*.1234' infile.dvi outfile.dvi
outfile.dvi will by 84 bytes in size and will be invalid:

dvitype will not tell you, you need to use dv2dt to see that the 
pointer in the DVI command post is wrong. In my tests, it is an 
arbitrary high number that has no relation to the new or the 
original file.

It's an interesting question what number should be there. The DVI 
specs say that p[4] in a post should be the pointer to the last 
bop, but we don't have a bop in that file. So maybe it would be 
better to use a pointer to the pre command instead.

In any case, it would be sensible to output a respective error 
message and exit with an exit code != 0.

Best,
	Joachim

Hi,

if anybody works on the dviselect error (not that I really expect 
it, when pdftex is all the rage nowadays :-), could you also please 
change the following annoying behaviour:

The option -s is there to silence the output or progress messages. 
Nevertheless, one single new line is output -- that makes that 
option not really usable, one still needs a redirection to 
/dev/null. Maybe one can inhibit output of that newline, too.

Hi, I find the following:

source/emacs+auctex-src-2006-10-10.zip
support/emacs-22.1+auctex-11.85-win32.zip

dak at lisa:/lisa/texlive/Master$ git ls-files  *preview-latex*

support/preview-latex.zip


Now... The above source of emacs+auctex does not correspond to the
binary distribution.  Most likely both should be updated to the current
offering.  support/preview-latex.zip contains version 0.9 of
preview-latex which is stoneage (preview-latex has been integrated into
AUCTeX for quite a bit of time now).  It should be removed.

The current Windows offering consists of
<URL:http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/auctex/auctex-11.85-e22.2-msw.zip>
(which can be unzipped into a compiled MS Windows Emacs tree) with the
source (all systems)
<URL:http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/auctex/auctex-11.85.zip>.

You would apply it to Emacs 22.2 (the Windows binary is at
<URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-22.2-bin-i386.zip>) with
the source at
<URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/libXpm-3.5.7-w32-src.zip> and
<URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-22.2.tar.gz>.

Does this help?  Or is it an upstream (CTAN) problem?

As this also includes all requisite image libraries and there is a
single source tarball, this would seem like the easiest option.

Hi,
the Windows binaries you found in the repository had been the latest
stuff at the time I asked Ralf (Mar 10 2008), Emacs 22.2 is from Mar
26.  I now upgraded to Emacs 22.2 now and removed obsolete stuff.
(rev. 7915)

Usually I upload new versions after I used them myself for a while, so
please check if everything is correct.  

 > Does this help?

With the links you provided the update had been quite convenient. :)

 > Or is it an upstream (CTAN) problem?

Emacs in TeX Live had never been taken from CTAN.  In the past I
always uploaded the files proposed by Ralf.  The files in the support
directory don't have to be on CTAN because no TeX Live packages are
made from them.  However, the stuff in texmf-dist/tex/latex/preview
*has* to be on CTAN.  If there are new versions then you have to
update them on CTAN.

Regarding the files provided by Vincent Goulet, I'm not very happy
with them because they contain a lot of extra stuff.  Of course it is
nice to have aspell included but this only makes sense if there are
dictionaries for all supported languages.  I fear that this blows up
emacs too much.  And I do not want to maintain all this.

The problem is the DVD.  It contains the TL live system as well as a
CTAN excerpt and both are growing rapidly.  Last year Manfred had to
remove a lot of stuff from the CTAN excerpt manually and I don't think
the situation is better this year.  Hence I'm currently reluctant to
add more stuff into Emacs.

Another point: I'm not a Windows user, but isn't it possible to make
installation a little bit more convenient by adding a batch file to
the support directory like:

install-emacs.bat
-------------------------------------------------------
@echo off
unzip emacs-22.2+auctex-11.85-w32.zip -d %ProgramFiles%
%ProgramFiles%\emacs-22.2\bin\addpm.exe
-------------------------------------------------------

Just an idea.  Not very important, but not much work though.
I'm not sure whether %ProgramFiles% is always writable.

Coming back to the question I asked David in Bachotek: Unless some
MinGW programs are installed, Emacs is the only program on Windows
which can display manpages and info files.

Is there any possibility to make Emacs aware of TeX Live's MANPATH and
INFOPATH?  It can be done somehow using kpsewhich. man/ and info/ are
relative to $SELFAUTOPARENT.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I tried to reproduce it; but didn't succeed. I could swear I had an

Anyhow, scrap it. My apologies for sending a wrong issue message.

As far as I know, yes.  However, some of the tlpmgui authors were just

(Norbert P and others have also written a replacement for tlpmgui this year.)

Hm, I'm sorry I haven't got that. Could you please resend it with a copy

Yes, new tex live package management machinery is much better indeed. 
tlpmgui is not maintained anymore, but I'll support it as long as there 
will be requests, so go ahead.

Message-ID: <200805092330.m49NUSp04613@tug.org>

More changes will be more coming, but I think it is time to try an
initial compile of the TeX Live sources.  Volunteer builders for TL, you
know who you are :).

I have sent a message with more details to the (new) mailing list
tlbuild at tug.org, to which I've already subscribed the volunteer builders
of the binaries we distribute as part of TL.  I also wrote down some
procedures, etc., at http://tug.org/texlive/build.html.

Perhaps a good time to mention that a few weeks ago I also created
tldistro at tug.org for discussion related to including TL in "downstream"
distros.

Feel free to join either list as you like
(http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tlbuild resp. tldistro), but let's keep
them focused on their respective topics as much as possible.  The whole
idea of creating them was that not everyone on those lists wants or
needs to be on this general list.

Thanks,
Karl

Yes, stolen from your last alpha version.

  $ ls -1 bin/*.dll
  bin/libXpm.dll
  bin/libpng13.dll
  bin/libtiff3.dll
  bin/zlib1.dll

I've also stolen the license file COPYING-IMAGELIBS.

What is still missing is jpeg62.dll which we did't include in the past
but I found a Windows dll on sourceforge.  No problem for me to
include it too.

Yes, but it's better to avoid the registry.  Suppose you want to run
Emacs from a USB stick, then you don't want to 'install' anything.

It's already possible with TeX Live.  It's accomplished by a shell
script/batch file which adds the TL bin directory to PATH and invokes
a new shell.  Even Ghostscript and Perl are not installed anymore on
Windows.  Programs which need them  are invoked by wrapper scripts.

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/doc/tlinst-BT08.pdf

 > One can also set the variables `woman-manpath' and
 > `Info-directory-list'.

Yes, this is what I had in mind, but instead of hard-code the TeX Live
paths here, determine them by using kpsewhich.

On Unix:
  infodir=`kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT`/texmf/doc/info 
  mandir=`kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT`/texmf/doc/man 

This would be quite convenient and I suppose that auctex already
determines the path to the LaTeX macro packages this way.

Don't know whether it makes much sense for TL-2008 because it will be
released in a few weeks, but it would be nice to have such a feature
in the future.

It will certainly work for info files, for manpages it is a bit more
difficult because they have different extensions [1-9].  But as I said
before, running TeX Live from a USB stick without installing anything
is a great thing, and it would be great to have a portable Emacs for
Windows too.

Hi Ralf,
I noticed that.  It's not overwritten.  The old version had a
different name, xpm4.dll, or similar.

Do you mean http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libpng.htm ?  The
version there is 1.2.24 which seems to be older.  Under the assumption
that libpng13.dll is version 1.3, at least.  Can you provide a link to
a newer version?

Hmm, can anybody provide more information about the legal stuff?
AFAIK jpeg6b is included in so many programs that I doubt that there
are any problems.

I'm not a lawyer.  I simply assume that everything which is good for
Debian is also good for TeX Live.  The Debian guys are quite careful
about the legal stuff and I think I can rely on them.

I'm a bit more reluctant about GIF support.  AFAIK the patents expired
a few years ago and libungif circumvented them anyway.  But I'm quite
infamiliar with the legal stuff.  Is libungif in Debian?

If we provide libungif we certainly have to include the sources too.
All the other image libs are already in the TeX Live Build tree.  On
the other hand I don't think that GIF support is very important at all.
I personally have no problems not supporting GIF.

Yes, it will only work with web2c based distributions.  But do
non-web2c distributions provide manpages and info files at all?  Then
it would be sufficient to check whether kpsewhich is in PATH.

  Reinhard

Emacs checks for the environment variables MANPATH and INFOPATH and uses
them if set.  On Windows Emacs honors such variables if set in the
registry in Software/Gnu/Emacs, see (info "(emacs)MS-Windows Registry").
(I'm not sure if this is true for all such variables.)

One can also set the variables `woman-manpath' and
`Info-directory-list'.

I'm not sure if one really wants to go through the pain of configuring
the respective variables during installation of TeX Live.  Perhaps it
would be easier and more intuitive for a Windows user if opening a man
or info file from the Windows Explorer opened the respective viewer,
i.e. Emacs if there is no other.  But I haven't checked if this works or
could be made to work.

Emacs 22.2 for Windows already comes with libXpm.dll equipped, so it

The PNG library needs updating.  There is a newer version available by

Yes, when providing completion alternatives for stuff like \input or
\usepackage.  This requires, however, that `kpsewhich' is in PATH.  (Of
course the same is true for `latex' and similar binaries.)

Yes.

The release date is later than the last Emacs+AUCTeX bundle IIRC.

libpng13.dll was probably part of the 1.2.8 release.  No idea why they
switched to the name libpng12.dll in 1.2.24.  Anyway, even 1.2.24 has
security vulnerabilities, see

IIRC MiKTeX, for example, utilizes some Windows help browser, so its
documentation is likely in HTML.

xetex  xetex  -           -etex  xetex.ini
to
xetex  xetex language.def -etex xetex.ini

since it loads language.def anyway and it is more close to TE spirit.
Please note that texconfig still supports changing patterns set not only
for latex, so at least one can use it on linux/unix.
I believe that in the future also tlmgr for windows will gain the full 
functionality as in texconfig (I mean at least hyphen and formats :-)

As for language.def, I'd like to add to it:

%% == standard (pdf)eTeX
%\addlanguage {german}        {dehypht.tex} {}{2}{3}
%\addlanguage {ngerman}       {dehyphn.tex} {}{2}{3}
%\addlanguage {french}        {frhyph.tex}  {}{2}{3}
%\addlanguage {polish}        {plhyph.tex}  {}{2}{2}
%\addlanguage {ukenglish}     {ukhyphen.tex}   {}{2}{3}

%\addlanguage {polish}        {xu-plhyph.tex}  {}{2}{2}
%\addlanguage {ukenglish}     {ukhyphen.tex}   {}{2}{3}
%...etc. 
to make more easy manipulation for the user (all percented out). 
btw. where can I find left/right hyphen minimas for other languages?

Last thing: we need texmf-var/tex/plain/config/language.def copy 
*after* installation, so it would be accessible/writable on all platforms.
Karl, Norbert, I understand the principle to not make copy unmodified 
config files during installation, but as far we do not provide 
language.def modifications, maybe in the next TL release...

Any objections (also from etex people)?

All the best,

The xu-* files are supposed to load correctly under both xetex and 8- 
bit (pdf)tex engines; at least that's how we use them in *latex  
formats, and I assume they'd work the same in plain-based formats. So  
it shouldn't be necessary to have two versions of these declarations.

The idea was that a single language.{def,dat} file should support  
both pdftex-based and xetex-based formats, avoiding the need to  
maintain parallel lang files for the different engines, or modify the  
file depending which format is about to be built.

(We may be revising the pattern-loading techniques in the next few  
weeks anyhow, as the current setup doesn't work to build these  
formats with the luatex engine.)

Thanks for explanation, but I have in mind to keep it more general at 
the moment, also when somebody does not install xetex (that means also
xu-* files).

That would be great, but not for the upcoming TL2008, I think, as etex
and latex still need different language.{def,dat}.

Hmmm. Yes, I see.

Maybe it would be better, though, to install the xu-* files (or this  
year's replacement, if we get a new system in place) in all cases,  
even if xetex is not installed. They're small, and they greatly  
simplify the maintenance of language.* files.

Sorry, I didn't express that clearly. I meant a single language.dat  
shared by both (pdf)latex and xelatex, and a single language.def  
shared by etex and xetex. That's why the xu-* files do an engine  
test, so they can be used as the standard loaders for the pattern  
files in all cases.

I didn't mean to suggest unifying the etex and latex language files  
(though I think that would also be a good thing!) .... that would  
certainly involve more intrusive changes to the macro packages, and I  
don't think we can attempt that at the moment.

Hi Ralf,
I updated libpng to version 1.2.24.  Thanks for the hint.  The
distribution contains two files:

-rw-r--r-- 1 reinhard users 161792 Jan  2 12:14 libpng12.dll
-rw-r--r-- 1 reinhard users 161792 Jan  2 12:17 libpng3.dll

They are different, though they have the same size

$ cmp libpng12.dll libpng3.dll 
libpng12.dll libpng3.dll differ: char 137, line 2

but the files libpng-config and libpng12-config are identical, so I
think the difference is a time stamp or something similar.

I included libpng12.dll now because according to README.W32 Emacs
expects this one.  My assumption is that the name libpng13 was used by
mistake.  But I've no idea what libpng3 is.  Quite confusing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, let's do this.

We didn't do anything about this last year and no one complained, let's
not waste time changing language.def for the sake of "user edits" now.
IMHO.

    I changed in the master texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

There's no use changing fmtutil.cnf directly any more.  It is generated.
I checked in the change you wanted to texmf/fmtutil/format.xetex.cnf.

    Last thing: we need texmf-var/tex/plain/config/language.def copy 
    *after* installation, so it would be accessible/writable on all platforms.

Why?  If you mean for expert users like yourself, if you're smart enough
to edit it, can't you also copy it :)?

    AFAIK jpeg6b is included in so many programs that I doubt that there
    are any problems.

I believe there are some advanced features of recent versions of JPEG
which are still patented, but that jpeg-6b and the "usual" jpeg support
is fine.

The GIF patents did indeed expire
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html) but I agree with you that there
is no reason to suddenly start supporting it.

Ok, I understand: I move the texmf-xxx directories to the installation
directory *before* "make world", but you move them *after* "make world".

Second try:

if [ `basename $(scriptdir)` = bin ]; then \
	s=../$$s; \
elif [ $$(basename `dirname $(scriptdir)`) = bin ]; then \
	s=../../$$s; \
else \
	echo Strange directory name for executables: $(scriptdir); \
	false; \
fi; \

(or with case - esac)


Untested...

Cheers, Peter

Hi Karl,
many thanks for the explanations.  I considered to add jpeg and ungif
but I finally decided not to do this.  Don't want to add more stuff
than we had in the past.  It makes updates easier in the future,
especially if the latest stuff is at ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/auctex
again.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Guys,

Can there be a more obvious link to http://tug.org/texlive/svn  from
http://tug.org/texlive/

I am always losing this page. I dont use svn much, so I am always
looking up the checkout instructions.

Thanks

If you have enough space on your disk, it is better not to remove your
working copy and run "svn update". It is usually faster than full
checkout (it downloads just the changes) and all the settings are
stored in the administrative files, you do not need to remember
anything. And "svn info" will display the relevant information in
human readable form.

As far as I can tell (using "Find" on both
rendered page and source), there is no reference
to "http://tug.org/texlive/svn" at all from
the cited page.  There therefore cannot be
a "more obvious" link, but there certainly
could be /a/ link, if one would help !

That's the point. You have to follow "How you can help" and then
"subversion source repository" under the heading "As an author or
developer". Thus the link exists but it is not obvious where to find
it.

Note also that if you want to checkout just the source code, not the  
texmf trees and all the old binaries, etc., you can run something like

    svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Build/source /path/to/new/ 
local/tlsource

to get a working copy. That's much quicker to checkout and update  
than the entire TL repository, and it has all you need for building  
the binaries. "svn update" in the resulting tlsource directory will  
pull down any updates to the code, and the Build script will (by  
default) do a complete clean build in a fresh Work subdir each time.

If you want to experiment with running configure && (gnu)make  
separately, I'd still recommend doing it in a separate build tree,  
like the Build script does.

    Can there be a more obvious link to http://tug.org/texlive/svn  from
    http://tug.org/texlive/

I added a link for "Source repository".  Hope it helps.

Hi all,

We got the following suggestion concerning mktexlsr:

THis patch actually looks quite reasonable to me, so what about
including it in our texlive repository?

Any comments/remarks/objections please?

What about CVS and RCS subdirectories (no initial dot in their name)?
Also it may be more efficient to not have alternatives starting with a
common character, something like

\.\(bzr\|git\|hg\|svn\)\|CVS\|RCS\|_darcs

CVS contains just a few files, namely Entries, Repository, Root,
Template. There is just a small risk of filename clash with something
meaningful. CVS contents are currently included in ls-R and I have not
found any problem so far while svn and git may cause problems.

If you use cvs edit, the original version of the edited file is copied
to CVS, so I strongly suggest ignoring CVS completely.

It is probably also something we should think about in kpathsea when not
using the ls-R data base.  When expanding xxx/ and xxx// specifications,
we will not want to go there, either.

Hi,

you cannot install the packages "semaphor" and "tablor" from the
current SVN revision of TeXLive: There are differences betwen the
files listed for that packages in "texlive.tlpdb" and the "texmf*"
trees.

Exactly. It will be inconsistent only if the list of files within the
package changed, not if only the files themselves did.

I guess the answer is something like running

Master/tlpkg/bin/tlpsrc2tlpdb -all

having a good coffee/beer/whatever while it's running (takes some time), and
trying the install again. If you happen to have a local copy of the TeX
Catalogue, you can use the option -catalogue <path> too, but I guess for
package update only you don't need the catalogue info. Anyway, you'd better
svn revert + svn update texlive.tlpdb the next morning.

I installed this change, with David's additional suggestions of CVS,
RCS, and factoring out the '\.'.
 
As for kpathsea, I don't plan to do anything, although I don't mind if
someone else does.  I have not seen any reports of such a problem in the
last umpteen years, so it is evidently not an issue in practice.  (If
someone else does work on it, the list of exclusions should be
controlled via a texmf.cnf variable, probably PATH_SEP-separated.)

Thanks,
Karl

    Maybe it would be better, though, to install the xu-* files 
    ... in all cases,  

In fact, the xu-* hyphen files have always been installed in all cases.

Sorry, that was my bug (addding links with svn:executable is a *bad*
idea, didn't know that).

How that??? Did you update texmf?? The file
	Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
should be present since long long! First added at r7221 ...

So that should actually work if you use a current svn up-ed texmf tree.

Same with all those links.

Strange: Today in the morging I ran `svn update' on the whole TeXLive
repository, and those files weren't added.  Now I did it explicitly in
this very directory, and the new files appeared.

Perhaps you have a conflict somewhere in your local copy.  This could explain
why the svn up failed on the whole repo but worked in a specific directory.
Did you run svn status on the whole repo to check this?

Irrelevant. conflicts are on file basis and do not interfere with the
updating of other files/directories. At least that is how svn on unix
works ;-)

But svn status might give some insight in any case.

This is correct -- svn ran about 30 minutes :-)  I think I'm now up to

I did it right now.  Everything seems fine now.  Just to be sure, I
did an `cvs update' again, and I now have Revision 8270.

You don't want to look into the log files or the svn history. Sometimes
I do about 10 check ins a day, sometimes more. Same with Karl and

I've just uploaded updates of the Wadalab fonts to ftp.dante.de,
together with xdelta files relative to the last release.

This version incorporates the hwkatakana bundle of Gernot Hassenpflug
(which now becomes obsolete).  The main reason for this merge was that
some files of Gernot's package replace files from the Wadalab fonts,
causing nasty dependency issues.

Thanks very much Werner! I'll post an announcement about the demise of
my first and only package on comp.text.tex shortly. It was a good
learning experience and hopefully there'll be more from me in the
future.

Thanks for the upload. I installed it and added a note to the Catalogue entry 
for hwkatakana, which I will move to the CTAN /obsolete subtree. After a few 
days, I going to completely remove the catalogue entry.

good luck.  i've already written once asking for clarification of the
cite bundle -- iirc 3 of the 4 packages are ok, but chapterbib is
unsullied with licence info.

he hasn't replied, though he generally replies to technical mails from
me.

I looked into my installation of TL 2007, and the file xetex.def can  
be found in:
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/graphics/xetex.def
But in 2008 the file is not there. There is actually no such directory  
as graphics in xelatex.

I don't have this problem while compiling with pdflatex.


If you need any further data from me, feel free to write me a message.  
And if you answer this email, it would be great if you could write my  
address in CC, since I'm not a subscriber to this mailing list.

(the described problem is actually not a problem for me know, but I  
thought it could be an important bug report for you as texlive  
developers)

OMG, again this stupid mistake: I misread the pre-commit log and thought it
was /added/, not deleted...  I wouldn't have commited this change.  Sorry.  (I
already changed the output of the script so that I can no more do this
mistake, which caused me some trouble a few times.)

I manually restored the file (r8362).  I also added a warning in our update
scripts that we should treat xetex.def as an independent file, not part of the
graphics bundle (though its package-level directory is 'graphics'), so that
the problem won't happen any more.

> It's not on CTAN, btw. Johnathan?

I guess the problem is that the natural place of xetex.def would be in
graphics, which is part of the tools bundle maintained by the L3 team, but it
makes more sense to have this file maintained by Jonathan.  Anyway, I would be
happier if the file could have a place on CTAN.

Oh, nice.  From my point of view, it would be nicer to take xetex.def from

there's no name problem, that i can see.  we already have

2007/12/04 |      34834 | graphics/pdftex/pdftex.def

which is the canonical version, so why not graphics/xetex/xetex.def ?

Since xetex.def is maintained independently of graphics, it only makes
sense to treat it analogously to pdftex.def.

Jonathan, are you comfortable with your svn version being automatically
updated on CTAN and TL?  If so, I will arrange it with Robin as we have
so many others.  If not, please upload releases to CTAN and we will take
it into TL from there.

Thanks,

So that boils down to: Is there a person he will give sent an answer on
such a question?  Or is there some other *way* to convince him to care
about this?

Anyway, I'd rather nobody asks him *now*, since we should first make a
list of what we think he should do, to make it easy for him - and not
just tell him "what's the status of all your stuff?".  A list of his
files as I found them in teTeX and TeXLive can be found at
http://wiki.debian.org/ProblematicCtanPackages, but I'm not completely
sure that it is complete.

Hi Jonathan,

after including the patch2 into the Debian packages we got a bug report
which says that with the changes an included pdf file stopped being
shown.

To exclude any possible problems with the patching of xetex for poppler
we did in Debian I also tried the binary of xetex as currently in the
TeX Live subversion repository with the same result.

Jonathan, do you have any idea what could have happened?

A really minimal tex file is in the forwarded message below and the
location of the to be included pdf file is at the end of the message
below.

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

Hi Norbert,

Very strange. I notice that the report says this ONLY happens with  
PDFs generated by OO.org, not from other sources, but it's not clear  
to me what's special/different/tricky about the test file provided.

Between the two versions mentioned, 2007.dfsg.1-3+b1 (broken) and  
2007.dfst.1-2 (working), has there been any change to xdvipdfmx? I'm  
guessing this is more likely a driver failure than the xetex program  
itself, as the tex job is apparently running to completion and  
recognizing the size of the graphic.

Please try running the two versions of xelatex with the -no-pdf  
option, and then run the corresponding xdvipdfmx with the -vv (very  
verbose) option to see if any warnings or other diagnostics show up.

If this doesn't help pinpoint the point of failure, please send me  
the .xdv files produced by both 2007.dfsg.1-3+b1 and 2007.dfst.1-2  
for this file, running with -no-pdf.

Thanks,

JK

Hi again,

Never mind about testing anything, I know the answer.

The OOo file is "tagged PDF" (whatever that means), which was not  
supported by DVIPDFMx or (hence) xdvipdfmx until very recently. You'd  
get a warning about this if running xdvipdfmx without the -q option  
that xetex uses by default.

So the solution is to persuade OOo to refrain from writing tagged  
PDF, or update to TL2008; the xdvipdfmx there will support this (to  
the extent of ignoring the tagging but including the image anyway).

Yes, the patch2 backport you have sent me and checked into the svn

Is this enough for you or should I try the old xetex, too, the working

But it *did* include it in TL2007 without the xdvipdfmx patch you put
into tl2007.2.

Is there a way that it still works the way images were included in
TL2007.0?

But at least current i386-linux binaries do not work. But I guess they
haven't been updated.

Using xetex 0.998.5-dev on win32 I got only a warning: 
 File contains tagged PDF. Ignoring tags.

But the resulting file is displayed OK.

You're using Akira's xetex-dev package, I guess? That's a more recent  
xdvipdfmx build. This was updated (merged from DVIPDFMx) on May 20,  
according to the svn logs on scripts.sil.org.

I guess that was before DVIPDFMx checked for tagged PDF and rejected  
it as unsupported.

I think you have several options:

(1) stay with the xdvipdfmx version that shipped with TL2007.0, which  
handles this (blindly) but will lack whatever other bug-fixes have  
been applied since;

(2) use patched xdvipdfmx from TL2007.2, which benefits from a number  
of fixes but explicitly refuses to include tagged PDF; or

(3) use the very latest xdvipdfmx from current TL trunk (you should  
be able to create a patch with "svn diff" fairly easily); AFAIK this  
should work but I don't have time and resources to put into really  
testing that combination.

Sorry, I really don't have time right now to disentangle the various  
changes that have happened along the way, to revert this change from  
TL2007.2 without reverting the other changes, or to backport the  
latest update to PDF inclusion separately from the rest of the  
changes that are going into TL2008. Most of this comes more-or-less  
directly from DVIPDFMx cvs, so I'm not deeply familiar with all of it.

Personally, I'd suggest you try (3), and see if that works for the  
problem document.

svn diff \
    svn://tug.org/texlive/branches/branch2007/Build/source/texk/ 
xdvipdfmx/ \
    svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/xdvipdfmx/

should give you a patch to try.

Right; TL2008 binaries are not yet built and committed.

Well, all right.... here is a small patch that tries to handle this  
in the same way as the latest trunk code, simply printing a warning  
(unless silenced) and ignoring the tags. I think this will let the  
test case work OK (does for me, anyhow).

Updating to xdvipdfmx 0.7 (from TL trunk) would still be an option,  
but that's a far more extensive set of changes; this is a minimal  
tweak for this one issue only.

You are toooo fast ;-) Big thanks. I was just now digging through the
code of the changes if I can come up with something similar.

I will do tests immediately ...

Again BIG THANKS!!!

Did work, big thanks again. I will soon upload updated texlive packages
to Debian.

Probably a good idea to patch that into tl2007.2 tag

There isn't actually a 2007.2 tag yet, just the head of branch2007. I  
was holding off on tagging it to see if anything came up, with the  
intent that the tagged code in the repository should match as close  
as possible to what you're releasing.

I'll commit this to the branch in TL and then tag it, in the hope  
that we're really done with this now. :)

Hello,

I'm trying to build TexLive, fresh svn checkout, on a Solaris 10
machine, and it fails. Here are the last few lines of build.log:

/export/xtp/src/texlive/current/Build/source/inst/bin.

I launched the build as:
/bin/bash -c 'env TL_MAKE=gmake ./Build --without-texinfo'
###########

I will be happy to provide the full build.log it if needed. Also, the
bash part is actually irrelevant, it fails in exactly the same way with
or without it.

After looking for a while at the stuff in Work/texk, I think the
Makefile in there feeds the wrong INSTALL_DATA to the Makefile in
Work/texk/kpathsea. I tried to make a few changes to Makefile.in in
source/texk, but I only got it to go a few steps more. It then bombed in
the same way in Work/texk/web2c.

Beyond this, I have no clue. Can anybody help?

Thanks,

this happens because of combination of 3 factors:

* there's no "BSD-compatible install" on Solaris in system directories,
  so the build falls back to shell scripts such as install.sh

* the Build script uses the relative path to configure, so the paths to
  install.sh scripts are also relative

* texlive Makefiles fail in this case, because they pass INSTALL*
  variables to sub-directories and then the relative links to install.sh
  don't work.

to fix for this problem do any of the following:

probably the most harmless would be the 2nd approach (patch the build
script). the most correct would be to fix the makefiles; the above patch
doesn't allow to override INSTALL scripts during make install run, but
that is probably not needed, as one can supply correct INSTALL program
during configure.

Best,

Thanks, 

the build worked. The install mostly... I have all the binaries except
tex.  That is, a tex binary was generated in Work/texk/web2c, but it did
not get into inst/bin/<arch>. I have run a limited test and everything
else seems to be in order.

    a tex binary was generated in Work/texk/web2c, but it did

That is my bug and I will fix it.

Subject: [tex-live] Including pdf images fails while running pdflatex
Message-ID: <483FFB0A.3090107@cms.hu-berlin.de>

Hello!

This time, I'm not 100% sure, if it's texlive problem, but it seems so, 
because compiling my old sources, which were working very well with 
other tex distributions, fails now too.

I have the newest texlive2008 (installed on monday) with almost all [1] 
the updates (installed today), running under WinXP. When I try to 
include any pdf image via \includegraphics{} (and graphicx package) I 
get an error:

!pdfTeX error: pdflatex.exe (file ./images/overview.pdf): xpdf: reading 
PDF image failed
  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

Here the list of files of my minimal working example:
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.1415926-1.40.8-beta-20080506 (Web2C 7.5.6) 
(format=pdflatex 2008.5.26)  30 MAY 2008 14:50
  *File List*
  article.cls    2005/09/16 v1.4f Standard LaTeX document class
   size10.clo    2005/09/16 v1.4f Standard LaTeX file (size option)
graphicx.sty    1999/02/16 v1.0f Enhanced LaTeX Graphics (DPC,SPQR)
   keyval.sty    1999/03/16 v1.13 key=value parser (DPC)

   pdftex.def    2007/12/04 v0.04i Graphics/color for pdfTeX
supp-pdf.tex
  ***********

And the minimal example itself:
%\listfiles
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
   \includegraphics{image} % you need any correct pdf image
\end{document}

I have no idea, were the problem is, since this error message is not 
really helpful. But I'm almost sure, it's a problem with some part of 
the tex distribution (pdflatex? graphicx?)

While answering to this e-mail, please add me to CC, since I'm not 
[yet...] a subscriber to the list.

[1] I wasn't able to update bin-texlive and texlive-infra:
"We cannot upgrade bin-texlive on win32, since we are running it!"
I didn't find any hint, HOW to upgrade those packages "not running 
them". It would be great, if you could write such a hint in this error 
message.

That is a bug in the win32 binary, sorry.
If you are in a hurry, 
(1)
get
ftp://udon.nict.go.jp/pub/text/TeX/ptex-win32/current/pdftex-w32.tar.bz2
and copy "only pdftex.dll" into bin/win32
(2)
create new formats by
fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex
etc.

Best regards,
Akira

Thanks to Akira I've just updated in svn repo most of binaries for win32
(rev. 8428). Tomorrow packages will be updated on ftp.

Already known problem, but thanks for reminding that.

-------------- next part --------------
Since texlive is becoming the default TeX installation for linux (and 
probably the rest of the world!) I want to urge you to fix the 
several-year-old bug in pdftex.ini that leads to an incompatibility 
between pdftex and any plain document that uses \magnification (and that's 
a lot of them).

This bug arises only when producing pdf not when producing dvi. Because 
pdftex uses different page sizing commands, an incorrect offset of 
position is introduced into the pdf output. By replacing the (effectively 
null) pdftex.ini that is currently included in texlive, with the attached 
file, that bug is fixed.

Such corrective action is important because it restores the archival 
integrity of TeX for prior files, as well as removing from authors any 
necessity to take complicated and unnecessary action to obtain correct pdf 
output from Plain TeX.

A thorough discussion of this bug may be found at 
http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/pdftexpatch/ and especially by following the 
link there to the long debate that arose about this problem archived at 
http://www.codecomments.com/Tex/message784423.html. You will note that the 
pdftex programmers' position in that debate is ultimately that fixing this 
is the responsibility of the package maintainers not of the pdftex 
authors.

Hope you agree that this simple fix is worth including in the 
distribution.
