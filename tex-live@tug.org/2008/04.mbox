Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live virtual machine
Message-ID: <f03b6a440803311503w19a98746o7e7ccdff27227520@mail.gmail.com>

I was thinking about the possibilities for building a VMware virtual
machine around TeX Live. The idea would be to use a stripped down
Ubuntu (jeOS) as a base operating system, and install TeX Live on top,
with several bells and whistles such as vim, emacs/auctex, a pdf
viewer, and browser. The end result would be a completely functional,
highly integrated TeX environment that would work identically on
windows/mac/linux. This would go a long way toward making an easy
out-of-the-box TeX experience. All of the somewhat delicate glue
between operating system, TeX, fonts, emacs, etc. could be tweaked to
work together seamlessly in a kind of "canonical" TeX system that
everyone could easily download and quickly use. To minimize size, the
virtual machine could be built to mount the texlive iso image in its
virtual dvd-rom. I expect that a complete, uncompressed virtual
machine could be fit into less than 1GB, but I have not yet built a
jeOS VM with xorg, xfce, emacs, etc.

If there is interest and willingness to make this available as a TeX
Live download, I would be happy to build the vm. Of course,
suggestions for making it more useful are welcome. It would make sense
to work on this once Ubuntu jeOS 8.04 is released in a few days.

There are also a few problems with the mandir paths:

All Makefiles under utils/xindy/ have
    mandir=/usr/texmf/doc/man
instead of
    mandir=${datarootdir}/man
or
    mandir = ${prefix}/share/man
as elsewhere.

Also for xindy:
    docdir = /usr/texmf/doc/xindy
should be changed to
    ${datarootdir}/texmf/doc/xindy

Otherwise everything seems to build fine here on my linux box. Even xindy!

Best,

no, it is intentional. when --enable-tetex-build is used to configure
xindy, it redefines mandir and docdir to use the locations specific for
texlive.

that's where you'll see all man pages:

http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf/doc/man/

and package-specific documentation:

Here running aclocal && autoconf && automake in the root dir of 
lcdf-typetools seems to do it.

Message-ID: <ebdb98ad0804032057t7498bd20kceb2d74094a11644@mail.gmail.com>

I have written a simply tex file including a figure, here are the tex file
and figure file:

%tex file main.tex

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}
\chapter{test}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics{test.0}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

%figure file tes.0

%!PS
%%BoundingBox: 5 0 347 209

Then I use commands: latex main ; dvipdfmx main to produce a pdf file.The
pdf file created can not show characters "ln" in figure file 'test.0'.
But when I delete the line "\chapter{test}" in the file "main.tex", the pdf
file give right results.Are there any one who encountered the similar
problems?
And how can I avoid it?

By the way, when I delete the line "(4) ptmr8r 10.50064 fshow" in file
"test.0", it an also give right results , I use texlive 2007 with default
configurations.

Using texlive 2007 (from the Red Hat rpm's,  Fedora 8)
<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureTexLive>


$ latex main ; dvipdfmx main

works for me.  I get:

$ pdffonts main.pdf
name                                 type              emb sub uni object ID

KXWNCC+CMR10                         Type 1C           yes yes yes      8  0
UPLZFF+NimbusRomNo9L-Regu            Type 1C           yes yes yes      6  0

You don't mention a platform or a pdf viewer (not part of TeX Live).   Try
running with the pdf compression disabled ("dvipdfmx -z 0 main") and
search for the strings in the resulting pdf file.   Try using the "draft" mode
with graphicx to make sure the PS file dimensions are being read correctly.

I vaguely recall some problems with dvipdfmx configuration -- have you
checked the list archives?

I just made a mistake, the characters "ln" did display, I did not recognized
it, because
the character "ln" displayed in a much bigger size than which was expected,
and the top about
20 percents was cut off.

Here is another problem, the figure file displayed in different ways when I
deleted and did not delete the line "\chapter{test}" in the file "main.tex".

When I delete the line "\chapter{test}"  in the "main.tex", the pdf file
show characters "ln" in a smaller size, this should the the right one.But
when i use the line "\chapter{test}" in the "main.tex",  the characters
"ln"  are showed in a much bigger size,  I  think  it is  the same font
size  used by  command  " \chapter", and this is abnormal.

The systems and pdf readers I used are:
Windows XP, texlive installed use texlive2007-live-20070212.iso with full
scheme, Adobe Reader 8;
Ubuntu 7.10(Gust Gibson), texlive in the official repositories, evince
2.20.1.
both get the same results.

I have checked the list archives, and could not find some hints.The
attachment are
the files I used for the testing.

Thanks for the reply.

Subject: [tex-live] Error TexLive in kubuntu 7.10
Message-ID: <47FE3D26.1030407@custosmobile.com>

Hello,

I want to report a fail when I generate a doxygen (any version) 
documentation. The doxygen works well in Windows and Linux except in 
Kubuntu 7.10. (probably in all ubuntu 7.10). It's not a doxygen problem.

In Kubuntu 7.10 no matter if you install with apt-get or with download 
the CD when you compile a proyect with graphics, you can generate the 
DVI... but when you want to pass .DVI to .PS with "dvips -o refman.ps 
refman.dvi" the konsole give this message:

divps: ! Couldn't fin header file pspicture.ps.                  
<----------------------------------------

The problem is in Kubuntu 7.10 with the "Texlive distribution".



How can I solve that problem?

Thanks for your help.

It seems to be a known problem. Google search finds:

#468169 - texlive-latex-base: pspicture.sty requires pspicture.ps ...
Package: texlive-latex-base Version: 2007-13 Severity: normal
pspicture.sty which is included in this package requires a
pspicture.ps, but this file is not ...
bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=468169 - 19k

The same problem appears in TeXLive 2007 but is already solved in svn
repository (I have looked to the fresh working copy just now). You can
solve the problem in your version by copying
/dvips/pspicture/pspicture.ps to your texmf-local, or by getting the
pspicture package from CTAN and unpacking it to texmf-local.

Dear Jim,

I do not know who is responsible for a next bug; in the cork.enc file I 
find address <tex-fonts at tug.org> but my mail returned back undelivered. 
So I am sending this bug to you are the CTAN maintainer. Please, might 
you correct it yourself or resent to a responsible person?

There is wrongly named the glyph 'tcaron' by 'tquoteright' in the files
ec.enc and cork.enc. It is really bug, see e.g.
http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0165/index.htm
Due to the fact the glyph is simply missing using some fonts in the
resulted documents.
-------------------------------------------------

On my TeX Live 2007 installation the only cork.enc is below dvips while
here on CTAN we hold three (sigh).  The TeX Live cork.enc seems not to
have what Vit is talking about but one of our three does seem to me to
have a correction.

        $ find /var/ftp/pub/tex-archive -name cork.enc -exec grep tquoteright {} \; -print
          /tcaron %was: /tquoteright but is just the form of tcaron preferred

    There is wrongly named the glyph 'tcaron' by 'tquoteright' in the files

The situation with tcaron/tquoteright is not as simple as "one is right
and one is wrong".  Jacko and Janusz have written reams about the pain
of Adobe glyph naming.  I will ask them for advice.

The master for cork.enc is http://tug.org/fontname/cork.enc.  That ends
up in dvips/base in TeX Live.

I am not aware of any master for ec.enc.  Perhaps it started life in
NFSS and Sebastian just copied it into TL, since it's at
ftp://tug.org/historic/macros/latex209/nfss2-9307/psnfss2/metrics/ec.enc

One would hope that ec.enc and cork.enc would be the same, but of course
they aren't.  Sigh.

... and may be present in others.

Encoding files that are syntactically correct and succeed in creating
a PostScript array of length 256 containing names are bugfree when they
are used with a font that uses these names to indentify charstrings.

Whether or not these particluar names are used in any font is another
matter, and that is why the latin modern fonts come with their own
files (lm-ec.enc, I believe). Various fonts use various 'names' for
their glyphs, and an .enc file *has to* abide to whatever convention
the font designer has chosen.

This cork.enc may show buggy behaviour when combined with the font
it is tied to in your psfonts.map or pdftex.map (and if that came from
texlive, then there is a bug in the map file) but the encoding file
itself is still correct even in that case.

Hope this helps,

Taco

I do not agree. This bug is ost evident if afm2tfm or a similar
program is asked to generate small caps font by scaling the uppercase
characters. When creating small caps /ccaron the program will look for
/Ccaron and scale it. If the program comes to /tquoteright, it would
like to scale /Tquoteright but such a character does not exist. The
character has meaning of /tcaron, its Unicode name is LATIN SMALL
LETTER T WITH CARON. Another problem arises when searching PDF or when
cutting&pasting the texts from PDF via a clipboard. If /toUnicode map
is not inserted, the algorithm relies upon the postscript names and
/tcaron is expected here. If the name is changed to /tquoteright, the
text is damaged in these operations.

No amount of disagreement will help you. You simply cannot change an
encoding file independent of the font it is to be used with and still
have the font work properly. Period. Just like you can't simply change
names in a phone directory and expect to still be able to find known
people in it.

Cheers,

Howdy,

I realise this list is for tex-live development but for some reason my  
posts to the MikTeX mailing list are being bounced. Hopefully there is  
someone on here that knows enough about MikTeX to point me in the  
right direction.

I am trying to update MikTeX that was installed with TeXLive and I got  
the following error reported at the end of the log:

I'm not 100% sure, but upgrading to 2.7 might help. MikTeX has
recently introduced some new formats to compress packages. See also

see the miktex website, uder 2.5 issues.

also your miktex is quite outdated might be a good idea to reinstall using 
version 2.7

your problem is that miktex 2.5 update isn't supported any longer --
there's a new format for package files (.tar.lzma) which 2.5 can't deal
with.

Besides ec.enc and cork.enc, there is also dc.enc as a possible origin:
ftp://tug.org/historic/fonts/fontname/fontname-2.0/dc.enc

Regards, Ulrik

P.S: As it turns out, keeping a historic archive can be useful at times.

The one reason why I replied was to point out that encs by themselves
are not buggy if they dont use unicode-compliant names, I no longer
have a practical interest in encoding files myself. That sais, your
proposal for ec.enc sounds fine to me. But if cork.enc is no longer
used, it can as well be removed from texlive, I assume?

IBM fonts are a bit problematic. They contain both typographically
correct /tquoteright and /tcaron with a shape resembling the old-style
mechanical typewriter. When such a font is installed in an operationg
system as OS/2 or eComStation and Czech or Slovak locale is used, ugly
/tcaron is mapped to the corresponding character and /tquoteright is
inaccessible.

Hi all,

testing the new texlive I found something strange ...
Aehmm, I never checked before, but installing on UNIX into 
	/home/norbert/tl test/2008
and then calling the (right) fmtutil-sys --all gives me:
...
mv: cannot move `mf.log' to `/home/norbert/tl test/2008/texmf-var/web2c/metafont/mf.log': No such file or directory
mv: cannot move `mf.base' to `/home/norbert/tl test/2008/texmf-var/web2c/metafont/mf.base': No such file or directory


I have to CREATE .../web2c/metafont (and pdftex etc in advance!!!), then
it works.

It seems that fmtutil somewhere on the way does not create directories.

Jonathan, could we have introduced this bug when we patched the support
for web2c/$engine/ ...


Best wishes

Norbert

Hello,

I sent this to the maintainers but got no reply so far. Maybe a wider 
audience of TeX users and hackers can help me.

Sorry if tex-live is not necessarily the most appropriate mailing list to 
ask a question like this. But I know that most knowledgeable TeXackers are 
here, so... :)

Subject: conflict between babel/greek and ethiop packages.

Hello,

Here is a minimal test file which shows the problem:

-------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[greek,english]{babel}
\languageattribute{greek}{polutoniko}
\usepackage{ethiop}

\begin{document}
\selectlanguage{polutonikogreek}
>En >arq~h| >epo'ihsen <o vje`oc t`on o>uran`on ka`i t`hn g~hn.
\selectlanguage{ethiop}
g`ez
\end{document}
---------------------------------------------

When I compile it on TeX Live 2007 (via pdflatex) I get the wrong output on the 
Greek side, namely the circumflex "~" is not typeset correctly --- instead 
there is a horizontal space added.

Please let me know how to typeset Greek and Ethiopic simultaneously. The reason 
I am interested in this is because it is needed for the critical edition of the 
book of "I Enoch" which exists in both Greek and Ethiopic ancient sources (so I 
am typesetting an edition with those texts in parallel plus a critical 
apparatus underneath each).

I suspect the problem is caused by ethiopic making ~ an active character. But 
how to overcome this I have no idea.

Kind regards
Tigran

Very likely so. Try adding quotes around "$fulldestdir" at line 705  
in fmtutil.

I think your question has been answered, but it should be noted that there

Right. I fixed the Build/source/texk/tetex/fmtutil and will do the same
for the bin/*/fmtutil ...

Yes, Taco, you are right the bug in [ec|cork].enc sould be solved in 
conjunction with the fonts.

Let as look to the TeX Live 2007 temxmf-dist/fonts directory. Command
   grep -S "tquoteright" *.*
responds only
.\afm\ibm\courier\cour.afm:C -1 ; WX 600 ; N tquoteright ; B 73 -14 646 
563 ;
... next 7 font variant
.\afm\ibm\times\nntb8a.afm:C -1 ; WX 521 ; N tquoteright ; B 0 -6 493 677 ;
... next 7 font variant
.\enc\dvips\base\cork.enc:  /tquoteright /tcedilla /uhungarumlaut /uring
.\enc\dvips\base\ec.enc:  /tquoteright /tcedilla /uhungarumlaut /uring
.\enc\dvips\base\tex256.enc:/tcaron %   180 % /tquoteright

So:
1. tex256.enc has been corrected yet.
2. The only fonts that use buggy name are ibm/courier and ibm/times
    Total number of afm files that use tquoteright is 16.
3. Total number of afm files that use tcaron is 12848(!).
4. cork.enc is not used in *.map at all
5. ec.enc is used for 611 fonts in *.map
6. none of ibm fonts in tfm/ibm/*
    (cour,courb,courbi,couri,cr-pc8,crb-pc8,crbi-pc8,cri-pc8,
     nntb8a,nntbi8a,nntr8a,nntri8a,ntnb8a,ntnbi8a,ntnr8a,ntnri8a,
     and their variants)
    is present in *.map; so no change for these fonts is needed if
    we correct the enc files.
7. Except of missing of \v t in the text, Zdenek Wagner summarized the 
next problems with 'tquoteright':

I propose:
A) rename (for hypothetic use with font like ibm)
      en.enc -> ec-old.enc
      cork.enc -> cork-old.enc
B) correct glyph name /tquoteright -> /tcaron in
      ec.enc
      cork.enc

These steps should not cause any back compatibility problems. Despite 
this if some occurs we will solve it by using *-old.enc in map files or 
discussing the glyph name with the font authors.

Alternatively, we can create new file ec-correct.enc and to change six 
hundreds lines or so in *.map to point to this new file. I see these 
drawbacks:
a) more work, more affected files
b) confusion for users since there exist manuals that advise to use 
ec.enc file (e.g. afm2tfm, pdftex).

Preserving on the present encoding vectors is a bug that causes problems 
to users. Please, let us try to solve it.

I recheck all *.maps in all TeXLive07 trees and find no cork.enc
So, I agree, it can be removed.

Question for tex-live maintainers:
How we correct ~600 fonts that have anavailable tcaron glyph in the 
current distribution?

Message-ID: <480623F4.3010108@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

It looks like I have found a bug in TeX : here are the files : 
http://norgz.info/bug.zip

The two files gregorio-good.tex and gregorio-bad.tex differ only in one 
\showthe, and yet the result is different...

If it is not a bug can you explain my mistake, and if it is a bug where 
can I report it ?

At the beginning I thought it was only a bug in omega, aleph and luaTeX, 
so I reported it on luatex (http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=26) 
with the help of Arthur Reutenauer, but after removing all luaTeX and 
omega specific parts, it looks like the bug is also in TeX...

Thank you in advance,

This:

   \global\isonaline=\number 0\iftrue1\fi

assigns 1 because the \if... is still part of the assignment.

Removing the % at the end of line 172

   \global\isonaline=\number 0%

fixes the wrong output.

elie,
i am don knuth's bug collector.
i have retrieved the files, and will send
them through the required vetting procedure.

    It looks like I have found a bug in TeX : here are the files :
    http://norgz.info/bug.zip

    The two files gregorio-good.tex and gregorio-bad.tex differ only in one
    \showthe, and yet the result is different...

    If it is not a bug can you explain my mistake, and if it is a bug where can
    I report it ?

    At the beginning I thought it was only a bug in omega, aleph and luaTeX, so
    I reported it on luatex (http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=26) with the
    help of Arthur Reutenauer, but after removing all luaTeX and omega specific
    parts, it looks like the bug is also in TeX...

    Thank you in advance,

Thanks a lot, I must say I certainly wouldn't have found this by myself...

As Taco wrote, this is not a bug. As written in the TeXbook, the
syntactic rule for a number requires full expansion and reading the
number ends when a space is encountered or at a token which cannot be
expanded further and cannot be a part of a number. Removing the
percent sign adds a space coming from the endline character. Some 15
years ago a very similar example was given in a TeX related mailing
list. The author of the message wanted to demonstrate that placing
percent signs at the end of all lines may be harmful.

Proper spacing and sometimes protecting by \relax is important.
Consoder the following short example:

Now\hskip 0pt plus 1fil later\hskip 0pt plus 1fil sooner.

\bye

You have 3 words that seem to be separated by 1fil and you get another
1fil from \parfillskip. You might assume that you get equal spaces
between the words and the same space will appear after the end of
sequence. However, this is not true. Tne word "Now" will be placed at
the beginning of the line after the space of \parindent and
"atersooner." will be placed at the end of the line. You also see that
"l" disappeared. The reason of  this beaviour is that "fil", "fill",
adn "filll" allow spaces in te middle of the word, so the above line
is interpreted as:

Now\hskip 0pt plus 1fill ater\hskip 0pt plus 1fil sooner.

Of course, fill has a precedence, so all fil's are effectivelly
removed. If you want equal spaces, you must insert \relax between fil
and later. This is described somewhere in the TeXbook too. That's why
macro writers put \relax after numbers and dimensions because they
never know what the users put after the macro.

    find no cork.enc
    So, I agree, it can be removed.

I'll take your word for it.  I removed cork.enc from fontname
(http://tug.org/fontname) and TL.

I have also added ec.enc to fontname (for now, unchanged from what was
in TL 2007).

Those changes will propagate through CTAN within a couple of days.

    How we correct ~600 fonts that have anavailable tcaron glyph in the 
    current distribution?

If changes need to be made to font distributions, the respective
maintainers should be contacted.  If I understand you, though, changing
ec.enc will "silently" improve the situation with no changes needed from
the font maintainers (good news for everyone).

      en.enc -> ec-old.enc
      cork.enc -> cork-old.enc

Names like *-old.enc are always a mistake.  We could rename it to
something like ectquoteright.enc.  

I have asked Jacko for input regarding the glyph name changes.  He has
spent more of his life dealing with this madness than anyone else I know,
so I don't want to make changes in this area without him reviewing it.

Thanks,
Karl

OK, I will recheck the situation when the beta TL2008 will be available.

Right.

I agree old is not good. But tquoteright is not the only change in the 
encoding. Naming like ec-dbar-tquoteright-???.enc is too long... I am 
thinking about ec-intuitive.enc but is also has disadvantages. I am not 
sure here.

In every case I would prefer to insert a hyphen after 'ec' since 
otherwise the main encoding info is rather hidden.

That is of course good idea to incorporate Jacko's rich experience.

Thank you,

    thinking about ec-intuitive.enc 

I don't understand that name at all.

    but is also has disadvantages. I am not sure here.

Maybe ec-2001.enc (or whatever the right year is, I'd have to research it).

Would you be willing to make the changes to the IBM distributions and
re-upload them to CTAN?  At least I don't think they are actively (or
even passively) maintained and I'd love not to have to do it myself.

    In every case I would prefer to insert a hyphen after 'ec' since 

Yes.

    That is of course good idea to incorporate Jacko's rich experience.

Still waiting on that front ...

Considering dbar and tquoteright, I realize their names intuitive - 
giving them without knowledge of their origin.

good idea; I like it.

Hmmm, these fonts are atypical as quoted Zdenek Wagner. They have both 
glyphs: tquoteright and tcaron. But
   tquoteright is actually tcaron
and
   tcaron is something like twithcaronmark
Since these fonts are not present in any map file in TL, I would not do 
any change and let the usage to a user.

Best

Subject: [tex-live] babel/4015: Unicode support for Greek LGR encoding
Message-ID: <20080419.092903.247937744.wl@gnu.org>


The attached files provide much improved Unicode support for the Greek
LGR encoding.  I've submitted them to the LaTeX bug database two weeks
ago but I got no reaction, unfortunately.  Maybe the `babel window' of
Johannes has closed again?

Since Unicode encoding gets more and more important I suggest that
those files are included in TeXLive, regardless whether they are part
of the current Babel distribution or not.  However, the very problem
is that Babel's original, rudimentary `lgrenc.def' file must be
replaced with the one I provide...

Note that those files still have a `beta' tag, since the proper
copyright notice is missing (which will be the same as Babel, of
course).

Subject: [tex-live] grmn0900.* not installed
Message-ID: <480A1765.1030705@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear TeX Live team : I today installed TeX Live
from the TeX Collection 2007 DVD, selecting what
appeared to be the obvious options to allow me
to typeset using TeX & LaTeX in Western European
and Oriental Languages; in particular, I selected
Greek and Vietnamese amongst others.  On trying
to typeset a document which commenced as follows :

	\documentclass [a4paper, landscape]{article}
	%\batchmode
	
	\hoffset = -0,5 in
	\voffset = -0,5 in
	\oddsidemargin = 0 in
	\evensidemargin = \oddsidemargin
	\topmargin = 0 in
	\headheight = 0 in
	\headsep = 0 in
	\textwidth = 10,6 in
	\textheight = 7 in
	\newread \PDFfile
	\newread \chapters
	
	\newif \ifchapter
	\def \testchapter #1{\def \triad {#1}\ifx \triad \thischapter 			 
\chaptertrue \else \chapterfalse \fi}
	
	%\usepackage [pdftex]{hyperref}
	\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
	\usepackage[greek,english]{babel}
	\usepackage {teubner}
	
	%\languageattribute{greek}{polutoniko}
	
	\def \prefix {Final-Images-EPS/Massaged/PDF}
	\def \page {}
	\def \endpage {}
	
	\font \smallgreek = grmn0900 % grreg10

I found the compilation failed because of a missing "grmn0900" (.tfm).
I searched the DVD and found a complete set of Claudio Beccari Greek
font files, which I then manually added to my installed base, but
wonder (a)~why these were not installed automatically, given my
language selections, and (b)~how I should have instructed TLPMGUI
to add them for me retrospectively ?

I attach "tlpm.log" from the installation in case this sheds
any light on the matter.

Sincerely,
Philip TAYLOR (Ret'd).

Subject: [tex-live] CRLF vs. LF for .inf files
Message-ID: <200804191725.m3JHPLV16853@f7.net>

I noticed this change yesterday:

    r7457 | preining | 2008-04-16 15:16:09 +0200 (Wed, 16 Apr 2008) | 2 lines
    dummy change to get cr/lf right
    Changed paths:
       M /trunk/Master/autorun.inf

It is necessary to do
  svn propset svn:eol-style CRLF autorun.inf
to change the eol property once it's been set.  Before it was "native",
so autorun.inf had LF line endings when checked out on Unix and CRLF
when checked out on Windows.

I changed /etc/subversion/config on tug so that *.inf will force CRLF
for new files in the future.(*)  As mentioned in the svn setup
instructions, for people working with TeX Live I advise copying this
file to ~/.subversion/config on Unix and to 
<profile> -> Application Data -> Subversion -> config on Windows.

Karl

(*) There are a couple non-Windows files with extension .inf, evidently
Jacko sometimes names his readme-like files that way :):
  Master/texmf-dist/doc/generic/tap/0tabdoc.inf        
  Master/texmf-dist/doc/metapost/dviincl/0dviincl.inf
Not worth worrying about in the config.  (Jacko, if you're bored and
feel like changing the names and re-uploading to CTAN, great.  I won't
hold my breath. :)

I (finally) regenerated this configure script with autoconf 2.62 too.

Subject: [tex-live] babel/4015: Unicode support for Greek LGR encoding
In-Reply-To: <20080419.092903.247937744.wl@gnu.org>
Message-ID: <200804192309.m3JN92L11635@f7.net>

    Since Unicode encoding gets more and more important I suggest that
    those files are included in TeXLive, 

I am very uncomfortable with hacking individual files into TeX Live.  At
the very least, it should be on CTAN somewhere if it doesn't make it
into Babel.

Clearly the best would be for it to be integrated into Babel.  I hope
Johannes will do, but I have no way to influence the situation.

Sorry,
karl

Thanks!
Now "../configure --datarootdir=" seems to work.

Hi,
I need help with Large File Support on powerpc-apple-darwin; it's
broken in pdftex-stable and -trunk.

With a binary from -stable pdf inclusion is currently broken on
powerpc-apple-darwin 8.11; when trying to include any pdf (I'm testing
with the output of sample2e.tex) I get this error: "No space left on
device" and sure, when I fire up gdb it shows this:

I've traced it to this:

static void copyName(char *s)

    pdf_puts("/");
    for (; *s != 0; s++) {
        if (isdigit(*s) || isupper(*s) || islower(*s) || *s == '_' ||

                  pdfbuf[pdfptr++] = c;
                } while (0);
        else
            pdf_printf("#%.2X", *s & 0xFF);
    }
}
--------------------------

... and I am wondering whether xdvizilla is useful at all for anything
these days, given that Mozilla does no longer exist, and its successors
have much evolved. 

Does anyone know 

- whether it is still needed?

- or whether there are still people using it out of habit?

Hi Phil,

    I found the compilation failed because of a missing "grmn0900" (.tfm).

We had to issue a reduced cbfonts collection in 2007 (and previous
years, as I recall); there was not enough space on the CD.

Since we're not producing a CD this year, I guess we can go back to the
complete collection, now in CTAN:fonts/greek/cbfonts-all.  I'll consult
Claudio.

I'm trying to use the Tex Live manager to recreate the formats in order

that application, there is no tab which allows me to manage the

because I installed Tex Live from a different account (that no longer

Hello,

When using the switch "--disable-multiplatform", the symbolic links in the
bin-directory are wrong.

Example:

epstopdf -> ../../texmf/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl

instead of

epstopdf -> ../texmf/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl

This is not what the documentation recommends. Instead, it says:

4.2 Pdftex

The program pdflatex converts a LATEX file directly to pdf format. To 
change the paper size, edit the file
C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-var\tex\generic\config\pdftexconfig.tex
and change ?pdfpagewidth? and ?pdf-pageheight? to specify letter-size paper.

These entries should read:

pdfpagewidth 8.5 true in
pdfpageheight 11 true in

To make this change take effect, you need to do one additional step:

Start -> All Programs -> TeXLive 2007 -> TeXLive Manager
Select Manage the Installation tab
Under Create Formats, click on All


There is no such tab that I can see on my Manager. Another way perhaps 
is for me to manually run "fmtutil -all". However, when I do that from 
the command line, it complains that the commands pdftex and pdflatex are 
not recognized.

Does anyone else have any suggestions? Thanks.

- Mark

the web page
<URL:ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/xmltex/base/manual.html>

There are other examples where the documentation in TeXlive is not up to

CTAN.

What gives?

To set page size and many other parameters use geometry package (unless 
you are using xelatex, in which case you will need a special geometry.cfg 
and other bits for geometry to work).

I just made a few tests with opening files from
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/translations/es/dvi/
with Firefox 2.0.0.14; when opening a .dvi.gz file, the server sends
an 'application/x-dvi' MIME type and Fierfox suggests to open it with
the default application 'xdvi', but it doesn't unpack the .dvi.gz
before passing it to xdvi, so the original problem that xdvizilla
tried to address still seems to be present.

On the other hand, some of the xdvi wrapper scripts out there can
already deal with gzipped DVI files.

Also if the webserver doesn't send an 'application/x-dvi' MIME type
for .dvi.gz files (which it doesn't do on other sites I tested, and it
could even be argued that this is the correct behaviour since .dvi.gz
is not DVI after all), Firefox just sees an 'application/x-gzip' file
and won't try xdvizilla anyway (same for .tar or .tgz files).

And the default to delete the source file unless '-no-rm' is specified
can be quite nasty for unsuspecting users as seen in the bug report
that originated this.

So maybe we can just remove it from the binary distribution, but
keep the sources in the CVS so that people who use the script
can still download it?

Best regards,
Stefan

No problem for me. Then I suggest removing the comment about
"multiplatform" in "configure --help".

2 further small remarks:
- dead link: tlmgr -> ../../texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.texlua
  (should be tlmgr.tlu I suppose)
- some missing execution bits for a2ping, e2pall, mkjobtexmf, pdfcrop,
  perltex, pkfix, ps2eps, texdoctk, thumbpdf and vpe

Here is such a script.

(Assuming installation goes to $PREFIX, with binaries
under $PREFIX/bin and scripts under some subdir of $PREFIX/$DATADIR.
(For instance PREFIX="/usr/local" and DATADIR="$PREFIX/share/texlive"):

  ### FIX symlinks under $PREFIX/bin/:
  echo "--> ...fixing wrong symlinks to scripts under $PREFIX/bin/"
  for f in $PREFIX/bin/* ; do
      if [ -L $f ]; then
          target=`ls -l "$f" | sed 's/^.\+ -> //'` || return 1
          if [[ "$target" == ..* ]]; then
              newtarget=`echo $target | sed 's|../../|$DATADIR|'`
              rm -f $f
              ln -s $newtarget $f
              test -f $newtarget && chmod a+x $newtarget
          fi
      fi
  done

NB: My original script is slightly different since my installation is 
made to a temporary $INSTALLDIR before packaging for the distro I am 
maintaining:

  for f in $INSTALLDIR/$PREFIX/bin/* ; do
      if [ -L $f ]; then
          target=`ls -l "$f" | sed 's/^.\+ -> //'` || return 1
          if [[ "$target" == ..* ]]; then
              newtarget=`echo $target | sed 's|../../|$DATADIR|'`
              rm -f $f
              ln -s $newtarget $f
              test -f $INSTALLDIR/$newtarget && chmod a+x 
$INSTALLDIR/$newtarget
          fi
      fi
  done

But a large problem for all downstream distributions which either have
only one architecture or separate packages for each of them - in other
words pretty much each of them.

You could do the same as I did yesterday: I considered, that
--disable-multiplatform is no more supported and modified my spec-file
(see http://pmrb.free.fr/texlive/ ) accordingly.

Yes, we can all do essentially the same work about ten times, each one
in their one distro-specific lingo, so that we cannot share our
efforts. 

Or instead keep --disable-multiplatform working, as it has been in teTeX
since I can remember, and in TeXLive since I'm involved.

I agree. I just didn't want to bother Karl too much, since I've already
done so with --datarootdir ... ;)

There is also the other issue of the unclear license state of
amslatex[1].  Can you already tell us whether this will be sorted out in
time for the 2008 update?  

Im asking in particular because the policy of our Debian release team
makes me a bit nervous: They happily accept packages with yet-to-clarify
licenses if the upstream maintainer has agreed to clear things up, and
they already did this when we released "Debian etch 4.0" in
2006. However, they except that things should be sorted out in the time
it takes Debian to prepare a new release. These two years are now nearly
over, and well, I fear they might not allow us to include amslatex in
our TeXLive Debian packages - which would be extremely regretful.


I would be glad if you could give us some information what your plans
are,

Frank


[1] as we discussed earlier, the main license text has ambiguous wording
regarding modifications, and there are a couple of files under unclear
licenses.

we are actively working on an update.
it has gotten as far as a complete list of
the open bug reports, and a good start on
verifying that appropriate test files exist
for all of them.  but that's far from the
end result, which i'm sure won't be finished
before this year's tex live is frozen.

    There is also the other issue of the unclear license state of
    amslatex[1].  Can you already tell us whether this will be sorted out in
    time for the 2008 update?  

unfortunately, not.  however, changing the
license to be explicitly lppl is on the list
of things that must be done.  (since this
isn't "technical", it can be done relatively
simply, since it won't require testing.  whew!)

    Im asking in particular because the policy of our Debian release team
    makes me a bit nervous: They happily accept packages with yet-to-clarify
    licenses if the upstream maintainer has agreed to clear things up, and
    they already did this when we released "Debian etch 4.0" in
    2006. However, they except that things should be sorted out in the time
    it takes Debian to prepare a new release. These two years are now nearly
    over, and well, I fear they might not allow us to include amslatex in
    our TeXLive Debian packages - which would be extremely regretful.

that would make us rather unhappy as well, but
if it happens, it can't be helped.  our staff is
just too small and too overwhelmed with production
deadlines to be able to devote the time solely to
getting the new release of ams-latex ready.

    I would be glad if you could give us some information what your plans
    are,

our hope is that, barring disasters, the update
of ams-latex -- all of it -- will be ready by
the end of the calendar year.  (but unfortunately,
we must allow for disasters; this past year has
been spent migrating book and journal production
from vms to unix, involving retraining of the
entire editorial and production staff.  we still
have the most troublesome publications -- those
still in plain tex, with such delights as data
files shared between multiple publications with
different formatting requirements -- under vms,
and setting up the very different infrastructure
for unix processing hasn't yet begun.)

    [1] as we discussed earlier, the main license text has ambiguous wording
    regarding modifications, and there are a couple of files under unclear
    licenses. 

yes.  we intend that all of this will be cleared
up in the next release.  the original intent of
the current wording was to emulate knuth's
intentions regarding tex itself; the request for
files to be renamed if changes are made is to
ensure that our own production is not skewered
by well-intentioned but unannounced modifications
that prevent an allegedly "compliant" file from
processing properly when it is received here for
production and publication.  (we have enough
problems with authors using antiquated versions
that were once valid, but have long since been
superseded by improved code.)

i will try to keep the tex live group informed of
our progress; i'm in pretty regular communication
with karl about this and other matters.  please
wish us smooth sailing.

Sigh.  I didn't make the connection yesterday that
--disable-multiplatform was used by all the distros, but of course ...

So since it's so critical, can't one of you guys that it's critical for
implement option A, the maintainable patch I can install?  It shouldn't
be that hard: notice the option, put a flag in tetex/Makefile.in, and
change the number of ..'s accordingly.  Or something like that.

If no one else can be bothered, I'll look at it as soon as I can.

Hi Stefan,

    So maybe we can just remove it from the binary distribution, but
    keep the sources in the CVS so that people who use the script
    can still download it?

Sounds good to me.  So can you apply the patch below (or similar) to
your source for your next release?  I checked it in to TL for now.

(By the way, are you planning an xdvik release any time soon, or should
we plan on going with what we've got for TL'08?)

Thanks,
Karl

Seems all right now. The only file without executable bit is xindy.mem, but
I suppose, that this is no executable file anyway.

There was a typo (using LDZLIB instead of ZLIBDEP) in texk/dvipdfmx/ 
src/Makefile.am; this breaks the build when using --with-system-zlib,  
as it looks for "-lz" as a dependency.

I've checked-in the following patch, but have not reautoconf'd the  
dvipdfmx directory; the autotools versions I have on this system are  
a bit old, so I'm leaving it for Peter or Karl or someone to refresh  
the generated files.

I suspect I don't entirely understand this; are you
saying that the TeX Live installer is now going to
create font directories under %ProgramFiles% ?
If so, I would like to propose that this be
amended.  I try very hard to keep %ProgramFiles%
clean (I normally allow only Microsoft software
to install itself there), and since fonts aren't
programs, I would prefer to locate them somewhere
under %DataRoot% (not a Microsoft environment
variable, just one of my own).  IMHO, TeX Live
should make an effort to keep dissimilar things
in disjoint paths : programs under one root,
read-only data under a second, read-write data
under a third and so on.  By all means let the
default be to dump everything under %ProgramFiles%
just as Microsoft does, but please let the aware
user specify at least three non-%ProgramFiles%
roots.

Hello Vladimir,

Free placement of variable declarations in C is ANSI standard since C99 and
can enhance readability of C-code a lot.

So, wouldn't it be much better, to just update your C-compiler on your
AIX-system?

(I'm not a texlive developer, so this is just my personal opinion.)

Cheers, Peter

Well, yes, it might be time for a new release - I'll try to do one
next weekend.

that's a good point, but i cannot update the compiler (it's an old AIX
4.3 system with VAC 5 compiler). if the fixes don't reduce readability
of the code, i'd like to get them applied.

plus, there are a few other changes in the patch, not related to
variable declarations.

does this make sense to you? eqtb and save_stack is a structure.

Methinks we should add this to the CFLAGS:
       -Wdeclaration-after-statement (C only)
           Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a
block.  This construct, known from
           C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is by default allowed
in GCC.  It is not supported by
           ISO C90 and was not supported by GCC versions before GCC 3.0.

Best
   Martin

yes, that would be very helpful, if you are willing to be a bit stricter
than C99 is regarding variable declarations. (this option is for gcc
only, and should be used by developers to catch potential problems on
systems which don't support this C99 extension).

BTW, in addition to those luatex-related changes, i attahced a small
patch for texk/web2c/pdftexdir/mapfile.c (we discussed that some time
ago, and this is the proposed change which both works on older compilers
and preserves the assert).

Best,
v.

I'm also using an old compiler incompatible with C99.
So I have to rewrite declarations in several cases.
I cannot insist but I'm glad if developers kindly use
old-fashioned delcarations.

Thanks,

Ancient compilers did not allow for passing structures to functions.  It
sounds somewhat unlikely that this would be the only case here, though.

Maybe a missing prototype or something for eq_destroy?

It may be complaining about eq_destroy, because these five happen to
be all the calls to that function. Perhaps it misinterprets the
macro in luatexcoerce.h. Not that I see a reason why it should,
this function is converted by web2c just like all others. Or
perhaps it is mis-optimizing something?

Sorry, I am much more lost than you are, and I have knowledge of
nor access to the IBM compiler suite.

Best wishes,
Taco

I am going through this now. My comments:

xxx/xxx/Makefile: Patches are fine for texlive, but I will not apply
   these changes in the upstream. These packages do not use autoconf
   (yet) and I really need the -Wall etc. while developing.

libs/luafilesystem/src/lfs.c: I changedthat  a bit because your patch
   broke compilation on win32.

libs/luafontforge/fontforge/inc/basics.h: what was the problem? You have
   commented out some typedefs, but these should be harmless.
   (Fontforge is upstream for me myself, so I prefer not to make changes
    to headers unlees absolutely necessary.)

src/texk/web2c/luatexdir/font/luafont.c: one of the new "halfword next"s
   was a level off.

I logged out and logged back in and TeX Live Manager still only asks me 
to install TeX Live.  It doesn't allow me to manage the installation.  I 
don't want to have to reinstall the software.   How does TLPMGUI know

i investigated it further.

after pre-processing,

    eq_destroy ( eqtb [p ]) ;

gets changed to:

    zeq_destroy((memoryword) (eqtb [p ])) ;

i.e. the casts are added to the argument.

it appears that the compiler is not happy about the constructs with such
casts, it has nothing to do with the zeq_destroy function itself.

i.e. if i manually remove the casts after passing the code through a
pre-processor, i.e. change it to

    zeq_destroy( eqtb [p ]) ;

then it compiles fine.

to see further, i created a small test file:

===================================
typedef struct {
  int CINT0, CINT1;
} twoints;

void test (twoints *z) {
  twoints v1 = z[0];
  twoints v2 = (twoints) (z[0]);
  twoints v3 = *z;
  twoints v4 = (twoints) (*z);
}
===================================

$ xlc -c test.c 
"test.c", line 7.17: 1506-117 (S) Operand must be a scalar type.
"test.c", line 9.17: 1506-117 (S) Operand must be a scalar type.

it gives errors for lines with casts and no errors for lines without
casts.

does that make sense to anyone?

Best,
v.

i tested this with GCC, and got these warnings with the -pedantic
option:

$ gcc -c -pedantic test.c 
test.c: In function 'test':
test.c:7: warning: ISO C forbids casting nonscalar to the same type
test.c:9: warning: ISO C forbids casting nonscalar to the same type

so i guess xlc's refusal to compile is not completely groundless.

Best,
v.

Ok, found it. Patch is forthcoming.

Solved like this:

   #ifndef _AIX
   typedef int32_t		int32;
   typedef int16_t		int16;
   typedef int8_t		int8;
   #endif

For the other problem, there is a patch to web2c/coerce.h. All patched
code should be checked in by the time you read this.

Best wishes,
Taco

thanks, this will work; though a better approach would be to use
autoconf to test if these types are defined. (but that's not critical,
and needs to be done in the upstream fontforge sources to avoid
maintenance difficulties).

thank you.

Hi!

the texlive (and luatex) repository have the .deps directories in the
zziplib package with some junk in them checked in:

is there a reason for this? normally these .deps directories are created
during build automatically.
