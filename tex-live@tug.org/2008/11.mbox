    the bundle has been updated on CTAN, the misplaced file has been 
    renamed, so it should be ready for a TL update.

I updated it yesterday :).

Hi Enrico,

    The .sty and .tex files should go under

Thanks, fixed.

I've tried it both ways (on Ubuntu, that is), and it works fine.

I'm not a ConTeXt user, but I made a test a while ago, and didn't need  
to install anything else.

Hi Lars,

    It might be an idea to mention that in order for tlmgr to work properly 
    then perldoc needs to be installed.

I changed (the development) tlmgr to test for perldoc being available;
if it isn't, then it falls back to the internal parsing, which we were
already doing on Windows.  The output isn't quite as fancy as with
perldoc, but it's better than an error message.

Message-ID: <200811011027.28338.teke@math.su.se>

I've just switched from iso-latin-1 to UTF-8 on my computer. This has revealed 
a problem with tex.

In case it matters I use the Ubuntu 2007-13 version of texlive and get the 
following version information

homealone[1]latex
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6)

Anyway the problem is with non-ASCII letters in file names. There is no 
problem if I use straight latex:

homealone[1]latex inl?mning.tex
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6)
 %&-line parsing enabled.
entering extended mode
(./inl?mning.tex
LaTeX2e <2005/12/01>
Babel <v3.8h> and hyphenation patterns for english, usenglishmax, swedish, 
dumy
lang, nohyphenation, loaded.
)
*

(The actual filename may come out funny in this mail but it is 
inl aedieresis mning.tex )

However in case I try to input the file from another one it doesn't work

homealone[1]cat test.tex
\input inl?mning.tex
homalone[1]latex test.tex
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6)

                   \unhbox

                mning.tex

I get the same result if I first try to switch to utf8 encoding:
homealone[1]cat test.tex
\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\input inl?mning.tex

This is probably not too surprising (and I wasn't) but it is not clear to me 
that this is the way God intended it to be. However, it becomes more 
surprising if one tries to dump a format:

homealone[1]cat retex.tex
\let\DDDD\dump
\let\dump\relax
\input latex.ltx
\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

                   \unhbox
<*> &retex inl^^c3^^a4
                      mning.tex

Apart from the fact that I get different characters (? vs ^^c3^^a4) reported I 
more or less understand that the conversion from UTF-8 to TeX's internal 
character format plays havoc with the file name. However, I wanted to bring 
it to everyone's attention but wouldn't be too upset with a "don't do that 
then" kind of answer.

Remember that TX is not a UTF program, it works with 8 bit characters
internally. If you use non-ASCII character, it will be represented in
UTF-8 as 2, 3, 4, or 5 bytes and TeX will see that many characters.
These chararcters mayu have different \catcode's making some bytes
ignored or illegal. In order to use such a file name you would have to
change \catcode of a lot of characters to 12 but then the included
file might not work. Using \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} makes things
even worse because \catcode of some bytes used in multibyte UTF-8
characters are set to 13. The characters will be expanded to control
sequences and thence file with such a name will be unreadable. Yo can
try the following definition:

\def\UTFinput{\begingroup
  \count@\z@
  \loop
    \catcode\coount@ 12
    \ifnum\count@<255
    \advance\count@\@ne
  \repeat
  \catcode`\{1 \catcode\`}2 `\catcode`\\0
  \doUTFinput}
\def\doUTFinput#1{\endgroup \input #1 }

I have not tried it, I have just typed it from scratch but
\UTFinput{filename} may then work. Do not forget to put the definition
to  a style file or between \makeatletter and \makeatother.

I would also like to mention that encTeX will not help either. The
solution will be similar but the \UTFinput macro will have to set
\mubytein\z@ before calling \doUTFinput. If you want to work so
intensively with UTF-8, it is better to switch to XeTeX.

Not really with TeX, I think. Probably more with LaTeX's inputenc and/or
something in your system. (So the texhax list may be more appropriate.)

Is test.tex encoded in utf-8? And the filename too? Because in this case
it should work (it does work for me btw).

Why is your latex inputing retex.tex??? Is it really compiling the
one-line file shown above? If so, there is something very strange with
your latex format. (Maybe you \dump'ed something as latex.fmt by mistake.)

This is a problem with LaTeX's inputenc (and btw it shows you didn't

I have no idea about what this god guy intented, but one could try the
following.

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\makeatletter
\newcommand\safeinput[1]{%

  \count at 128
  \@whilenum \count@<\@cclvi \do{%

My technical answer is above, now here is my advice: do *not* use
non-ascii characters in filenames anyway.

It seems that tex itself has no problems with UTF-8.  But I'm not sure
whether I tested it correctly.

First of all I created a file "testutf.tex":

-----------------------------
\input x?x.tex 
\bye

% Local Variables:
% coding: utf-8
% End
-----------------------------

I loaded it into Emacs again in order to to convince Emacs to read the
"Local Variables" section. Then I created the file x?x.tex:

-----------------------------
#! /usr/bin/env perl
$^W=1;

my $filename="x\xc3\xa4x.tex";

print "$filename\n";

open OUT, ">$filename";
print OUT "hello\n";
close OUT;
-----------------------------

I got:

$ pdftex testutf.tex  
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.1415926-1.40.9 (Web2C 7.5.7)
 %&-line parsing enabled.
entering extended mode
(./testutf.tex (./x?x.tex) [1{/home/reinhard/.texlive2008/texmf-var/fonts/map/
pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}] )</reiserfs/texlive/svn/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/font
s/type1/bluesky/cm/cmr10.pfb>
Output written on testutf.pdf (1 page, 4013 bytes).
Transcript written on testutf.log.

So far so good.  I'd like to check things using programs like 'less'
or a program I've written myself, but xterms are so fragile that I
gave it up.  The only reliable program I'm aware of is Emacs.

Could anyone point me to a terminal program which simply works?

Anyway, I'm wondering whther it's a good idea to use non-ASCII
characters in file names at all.  They are only good for headaches if
you copy a file from one machine to another.

Regards,
  Reinhard

TeX itself has no problem with filenames in utf-8 since  filename isn't
really in utf-8. A filename is a sequence of non-zero non-47 (/) bytes
(not characters). And since TeX sees only bytes and not characters, it
is OK in principle (except for bytes specially \catcode'd as Zdenek says).

I think so. In general it is imho a bad idea to use non-ASCII except in
formats that allow you to mention the encoding used (such as email, or
LaTeX sources using inputenc). And (Unix) filesystems have no notion of
name encoding iirc.

Well, concerning non-ascii characters, changing the catcode is not the
only solution. Changing their definition can be more reliable in many
circumstances, such as:

\def\basename{inl?mning}
\newcounter{foo}
%...
\input{\basename-\arabic{foo}}

OTOH, if you really want to use also specially catcoded ascii characters
such as %, of course you need to change their catcode at some point.

But if the question is only "how to use non-ascii chars", I think
changing the definition is probably a better solution.

Message-ID: <20081102.121011.165300396.wl@gnu.org>


[Due to a mistake I've used the install-tl version of Okt 26th instead
 of the latest one.  I assume that the problems are still of there.]

First of all: Installation of TeXLive using install-tl worked just
fine, without any problems.  However, there are some `features' which
might scare Joe User.

  . I use KDE with multiple virtual desktops.  Switching to another
    one and then back to the desktop which runs `install-tl -gui', I
    see the result as depicted in the attached image.  Note that after
    a few minutes staying on the same desktop the contents of the
    install-tl window became `better': A white screen with the blue
    vertical stripe on the left side.  But the text and buttons seen
    before has been never restored.

    This really puzzles me.  I know that only a single thread is used,
    making it probably difficult to refresh while the wget process
    runs in the background.  But between the loading process of two
    packages install-tl gains control back so that it can refresh its
    window completely.  A programming error?

  . Since it took many, many hours to complete, I've seen the final
    display of install-tl the next morning; I thus can't tell whether
    anything weird has happened meanwhile :-) A final window popped up
    which suggested to modify PATH, MANPATH, and INFOPATH.  Alas, it
    was not possible to copy the long directory values given there to
    the clipboard (this is, using the mouse to highlight it, then
    pressing Ctrl-C).  Instead, I had to manually type them in.  This
    is error-prone.

    I suggest to emit the path values on the console also (from there
    it is *always* possible to mark and copy it with the mouse).

  . While install-tl shows the name of the current package it
    downloads and installs, it doesn't display how many packages are
    left.  Given that there is really an enormous amount of packages,
    this would be valuable information.

  . Any possibility to add an estimate how long the download will
    still continue, similar to other installation programs?

  . I assume that the texlive database doesn't contain the sizes of
    the lzma archives, right?  Even then, it might be a good idea to
    mention the uncompressed size of the currently downloaded archive
    so that the user has a chance to recognize whether it should take
    really a long time, or whether something unexpectedly is
    happening.

Hmm, but the situation right now is:

  o If there are lzma tools for the user's platform available on the
    DVD they are used.
  o If they are not available, install-tl fails.

The patch changes this to:

  o If there are lzma tools for the user's platform available on the
    DVD they are used.
  o If they are not available, install-tl still has a chance to succeed
    by trying tools possibly found in $PATH. This means it's possible
    for the user to provide working lzma tools without changing the
    (read-only) installation media. Thus the user is the culprit if
    installation fails in mysterious ways ;-)

By just adding NetBSD lzma tools to the TL installation media, or by
adding NetBSD binaries from a compelete TL build?

However, I don't think this is worth trying: currently there are 15
supported machine architectures, 3 supported ways to run X11 and 2
supported OS release versions at any given time; providing the needed 30
lzma bundles or the 90 TL binary bundles probably doesn't make sense.
And even if it did, those who use local TL patches would still not use
them.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem running install-w32client.bat
Message-ID: <490CE225.2040803@gmail.com>

I tried to realize a shared installation of TeXlive 2008 between the 
Linux and Windows Vista OSs installed on my PC, inspired by the network 
installation possibilities mentioned in the manual. So I installed 
TeXlive on Linux but in a folder on the Windows partition, corresponding 
to C:\texlive, so that all the files would be accessible from both OSs. 
Of course I selected the appropriate architectures.

Then I switched to Windows and tried to run install-w32client.bat (after 
copying it in C:\texlive\2008). The program produced an error:

"conv_to_win_path" is not exported by the TeXLive::TLUtils module
Can't continue after import errors at C:\texlive\2008\install-w32client 
line 14
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at C:\texlive\2008\install-w32client 
line 14.

So I edited install-w32client and changed line 14 from
    use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(mkdirhier conv_to_win_path);
to
    use TeXLive::TLUtils qw(mkdirhier);

Now the script seems to work -- unfortunately fc-cache does not finish 
successfully, but that's another story.
The above bug should be corrected...

Hallo Werner,

as usual, thanks for the feedback, much appreciated.

You go the point. The problem is that I don't have any idea how to do
that in Perl/Tk. I have already added several calls for processing
events between the packages, these events will also be refresh events.
But it seems not to be enough.

If someone can contribute some knowledge?! Or maybe I order the perl/Tk
book and try to actually *learn* that, till now I was just programming
by trial and error ;-) (not really, I programmed Tcl/Tk a bit, and Perl,
too, but never had things to be done like that).

I will try to investigate.

Ok, either we echo it out to the terminal, or better find some way to
make it selectable.

Ok, good idea, that could be done in the status bar like
	[67/345] installing ....

It does, not only the size also the md5sum ...

So probably I can add some code that checks how much time has passed
since beginning of downloading and the amount we have downloaded and the
total amount to be downloaded. We still would ignore the time for
unpacking and untarring, but that is minor.

Also we could issue:
	[45/344] installing lmodern (25Mb compressed) ...
or something similar.

Many good suggestions but I am low on time due to moving of flats, so
don't expect too much changes in near future, but all the things duly
noted.

Best wishes

Norbert

    Thus the user is the culprit if installation fails in mysterious ways ;-)

I doubt many users will realize it.  Hopefully they will write to a
netbsd support list instead of tex-live at tug.org.

    providing the needed 30 lzma bundles or the 90 TL binary bundles
    probably doesn't make sense.

That's certainly true.  I had no idea.

In that case, I guess there is no alternative but to fall back to using
lzma from PATH.  I'll see about installing your patch.

Thanks for the reply. 

The message persists *after* the update
of bin-texlive and texlive.infra:

92  tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
93  tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra
94  tlmgr update --all

(from $(history) )

I followed the instructions before the first update and before the
original message.

Message-ID: <5736b090811032242i5ac51a79se8ca061423f012d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been using mpost with mfplain on various Metafont sources to
produce EPS pictures of glyphs in the sources, so
     mpost '&./mfplain \mag=1; truecorners:=0; filenametemplate
"%j-%3c.eps"; input skt10.mf'
I can then import the picture into FontForge.  This sort of works,
with some annoying complications.

One is that every glyph is given a frame, consisting of five thin
rectangles (two of them below the character), that
seem to be related to the bounding box.

I can see these at the end of each .eps file, stuff like

newpath 0 -13.64217 moveto
0 221.00171 lineto stroke
newpath 172.79935 -13.64217 moveto
172.79935 221.00171 lineto stroke

How can I turn this feature off?

Thanks!

Just a silly question: doesn't bin-texlive and texlive.infra update
automatically with the tlmgr update? I could read the page as it had to
be done by hand before each update ...

It sounds like there must be some new hyphenation patterns recently  
added to the distribution, and the trie_size value in texmf.cnf needs  
to be increased to allow for them. Try changing

trie_size = 600000

to

trie_size = 700000

and let us know if that resolves the problem. (Sorry, I don't have a  
fully updated setup to experiment with right now.)

Was lithuanian support added? If yes that was from the update we got
tonight of hyph-utf8.

Can you try the following:
- edit ROOT/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf and change 
	trie_size = 600000
  to something else, first say 700000, or 650000
- call fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdftex and see if it succeeds.

Thanks.

Bummer, I really thought we fixed that.

So, suggestion to those who reads: before running update

edit

 /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

(or where it is; use locate to find out) and increase

trie_size = 600000

to

trie_size = 700000

Then everything will be smooth

How comes that? Do you use some other sources for TeX Live packages?

Again as above.

Do all these message persist after updating to the latest packages from

Yes, these message persist. 

The procedure was: install from DVD, upgrade the tlmgr as described in
the web page, and tlmgr update --all, as suggested. Nothing more,
nothing less.

I'll say also that the message  "is newer than revision" does *not*
appear each time. I think that the mirrors are not synced. My source
is  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 which probably
give me a random mirror. However, the following message is persistent:

texlive at universe:~$ tlmgr update --list
tlmgr: installation location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
skipping forcibly removed package chembst (collection-bibtexextra)

tlmgr: should not happen, please report: fontinst.i386-linux mentioned, but neither new nor forcibly removed
skipping forcibly removed package gene-logic (collection-science)
skipping forcibly removed package isomath (collection-mathextra)
skipping forcibly removed package xelibertine (collection-xetex)
texlive at universe:~$ 


Maybe is not important, but I installed it in /opt/texlive/2008 as user
texlive, to avoid the abuse of root. 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you need a tester


Regards
Marco

Ok, I will try to reproduce it. What scheme did you install?

Yes, that is the problem. You might set a default mirror, select one you
think that is fast and near you, then call
	tlmgr option location http://your.mirror.here/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

I try to check what is going wrong.

UPDATE: The weird messages were wiped out with the following operations:

tlmgr install xelibertine isomath gene-logic chembst
tlmgr install --reinstall fontinst.i386-linux


I suspect the problem was that the mirror during the update sometimes
failed and the tlmgr was not able to manage correctly the download
failure. 

I also tried the netinstall, but I gave up (and I used the DVD) when I
saw how many time the mirror refused the connection and the installer
exited. Probably, similar problems occur during the update.

My internet connection is stable, the problem was the server side.

Strange. I cannot reproduce the "skipping forcibly removed ..." stuff,
only the fontinst warning.

I did:
	cd /media/TLDVD
	./install-tl
	# install full scheme
	export PATH=....
	tlmgr option location ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
	tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra
	tlmgr update --all
	...loads of packages updaes, many packages auto-installed
	tlmgr update --list
	tlmgr: should not happen, please report: fontinst.x86_64-linux mentioned, but neither new nor forcibly removed

So yes, that bug has to be fixed. I will check for that.

But the forcibly removed packages really suprise me ...

Well, fixing it is easy:

> skipping forcibly removed package gene-logic (collection-science)

Just call
	tlmgr install collection-bibtexextra collection-science collection-mathextra collection-xetex

or the tlmgr install with these packages as names.

Right, that fixed it.

That could be, but the strange thing is that it should break then, not
continue ...

Hmm, choose a different mirror. But this is a problem we cannot cope
with easily, we have no influence on the quality of the mirrors.

I have already on the TODO list that we open only *ONE* ftp/http
connection and keep it open during the whole installation procedure.
This would ensure better mirror behaviour. But this has to be written
and tested anyway. Currently we use simply wget!

Well, it puzzles me.  For one thing, when I run tlmgr, it reports the
actual mirror being used rather than the generic mirror.ctan.org/...
And I can't reproduce the other problems (any more).

I'll update the critical packages again tonight.  Maybe the changes were
made after the current released version after all.

Being near (even network-near) doesn't mean it is good. From my
university's network (domain jussieu.fr), one of the *worst* mirror you
can choose is distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr. None of my students was

    Just a silly question: doesn't bin-texlive and texlive.infra update
    automatically with the tlmgr update?

No, we wouldn't ever want something as touchy as tlmgr updates to be
done automatically.

    I could read the page as it had to
    be done by hand before each update ...

Well, of course it only changes infrequently, so you hardly need to run
it every time.

And, for people who are basically keeping up with changes, it's unlikely
to be a problem to issue one tlmgr update --all to get today's (or this
week's, or whatever) updates.

The main scenario I wanted to describe on that page was someone who was
starting from the DVD image and then doing an update.  A simple tlmgr
update --all in that case would not be good, because there have been
dozens upon dozens of updates.  If bin-texlive gets updated after the
first umpteen packages, and texlive.infra gets updated after the second
umpteen, the result won't be anything good.

Even more importantly, because of the mirror-switching problem in the
original tlmgr, the big update --all is highly likely to end up with a
mixture of versions.  Again, something to avoid.

It might have been smart to see if those packages needed to be updated,
do those updates first, and re-exec tlmgr after the update.  We weren't
that smart.

I'll try to add some more words about this.  By the way, I added the
stuff about disaster recovery and test versions that were previously
mentioned on the mailing list to the page
(http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html) this morning.

Thanks,
karl

See also:

  http://www.dante.de/mirmon

However, http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr is certainly completely
unusable, though.  I suppose their strength is to distribute coffee...
...not TeX Live.

It seems that the German mirrors

  http://www.dante.de/mirmon/#de

are all quite fast and reliable.

This is because mpost is running in proof mode. You can make mpost
compile without the rectangles and in black instead of grey by
adding "mode:=localfont; " and a more suitable mag value to the
commandline.

Be warned that for this font, it will not help you very much because
metapost doesn't understand the "cullit" metafont command and that
is used very often in the sanskrit fonts.

Best wishes,
Taco

I am running Fedora 9 (i386).

I downloaded the small install-tl.tar.gz and after saying perl install-tl, I
got
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line

Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Cannot continue with installation.
Please report to texlive at tug.org.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%55

So does anyone know why this is hapenning? I had no problem installing
TeXLive on Ubuntu, Mandriva and Opensuse but I do not know why I can not
install it on Fedora.

Thanks

It seems that for some reason you do not have wget. Install it by:

yum install wget

AFAI understood the question your (Karl) answer is wrong, you mixed our
updates of tlnet and the updates of the client.

Yes, calling
	tlmgr update --all
DOES update texlive.infra and bin-texlive, that is right.

The only thing is that *we* don't update these packages *from* the svn
repository *to* the tlnet automatically, only after testing and manual
intervention.

After you have done it *once* now you don't have to do it at all
manually. Normal update procedure will bring it.

The reason to do is separately the first time is that the tlmgr as
shipped on DVD is a bit buggy (to be friendly), better it is not very
much forgiving to networking errors etc.

I guess Karl had all that in mind when writing:

In this respect Karl is right. The reason is that bin-texlive and
texlive.infra are tightly coupled. We did the error to not merge them
into one package for the DVD, our failure, I didn't think of that. Now,
if one of the two is updated and the other not it might be a real
problem.

BTW Karl, we could ship tlmgr and the perl modules in *both*
texlive.infra and bin-texlive. Slight duplication but making life more
safe... WDYT?

Preparing to do a from-CTAN-mirror-on-DVD install

mirror on this machine.  The mirror was created using
Wget, but is now being refreshed using RSYNC.  Can
anyone explain why RSYNC creates one extra level of
directory, as in

	D:\TeX>rsync -av --delete rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 CTAN\systems\texlive\tlnet\2008\

If used as-is, that incantation creates a 2008 directory
/under/ the existing one, so instead I have to use

If Nader's hypothesis is correct, this utility

	http://www.codeproject.com/KB/applications/touch_win.aspx

may be useful to avoid having to move a file twice.

I have tried "touch.exe", and it certainly updates
the date of the named font, so it would be well
worth trying to see if it can really resolve the
"fcache" problem.

final "\" is the problem. I assume that

Rsync is fussy about trailing path delimiters -- the manual
explains with a series of examples.

Hmm, definitely not convinced.  When I look back at the
transcript (the test run immediately preceded the current
run), I see there was no trailing slash. The incantation
was :

	D:\TeX>rsync -av --delete rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 CTAN\systems\texlive\tlnet\2008

yet I ended up with a local file hierarchy

	CTAN\systems\texlive\tlnet\2008\2008 :-(

Aarrrgggghhhhh : "fussy" ain't the word !
I've just read the relevant bit from George's

So my error was in failing to append a slash to the first
parameter, rather than erroneously appending one to the
second.  Thank, George and Norbert : all is now (reasonably)
clear :-)

I looked at the very helpful page to which George referred
me to see if there was a "retry" or "retries" qualifier,
but was unable to find one.  Can anyone advise whether
RSYNC does, in fact, support such a concept, and if so,
how can I make my transfer more robust by exploiting it ?

On Unix one would use
	for i in 1 2 3 4 5 ; do
	  rsync ...
	done
that already does the retries, because what has been transferred in a
former run will not be re-transferred.

Maybe something more like

while ! rsync ... ; do; done;

(probably not the correct syntax, but the idea is to retry iff rsync
exited with a non-zero status).

Howdy,

I wanted to look up the documentation for the updated (via tlmgr)  
geometry package so ran

texdoc geometry

in Terminal (on a Mac). Unfortunately, I got the error message

texdoc info: geometry aliased to geometry/manual
Sorry, no documentation found for geometry/manual.
If you are unsure about the name, try searching CTAN's TeX catalogue at
http://ctan.org/search.html#byDescription.

even though the updated geometry.pdf file can be found in /usr/local/ 
texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/geometry/.

Good Luck,

Not that, but how we could use it to fix the fc-cache problem. What
should we do before calling fc-cache?

Hi Norbert,
sorry for the late response.  There is a new function touch() in
TLUtils.pm now.

The tiny script http://tug.org/~kotucha/win32/stat.pl is quite
convenient for testing it, not only on Windows.

Oh, I see !  Well, according to Nader's hypothesis,
"touch" any file in /Windows/Fonts, although of
course this physical path should not be used;
%windir%\fonts or %SystemRoot%\fonts" would be
better (not sure which of these is more portable).

Message-ID: <c029dcfa0811072123h2bad6707v6480a04fe9def32a@mail.gmail.com>

I installed the minimal edition of TeXLive 2008 from the net in Ubuntu 8.10.
In order to complete the installation, I edited (gedit ~/.profile) and
sourced (source ~/.profile) the .profile file by appending the lines

PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux
export PATH

I also appended the lines

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/
export TEXMFCNF=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/

in the .bashrc file and sourced.

Then, latex -v gives the expected info.

I then tried to install new packages with tlmgr, after I had had installed a
python package and updated tlmgr itself. The command

tlmgr install mathdesign

will connect to the installation location, install:mathdesign and then quit
because it "can't mkdir '/usr/local/texlive/2008/temp/' permission denied".

sudo tlmgr install mathdesign, or sudo -H install mathdesign,

will prompt for password only to inform that tlmgr:command not found.

The package manager of MikTeX in Windows Vista similarly requires elevation
(administrative privileges) to start. If the same is required by tlmgr, why
is it not recognized by sudo? Why would tlmgr want to download the package
at a created temp directory where it has no access (me either?).
I hope you could hint at a solution on this problem, as I only installed
Ubuntu two days ago and my experience with it is still limited.
Many thanks in advance,
S.

Did run the installer as "root" or as an ordinary user?
Do you have Unbuntu's TeX distribution installed?

   Did you try to lauch the command as root
su -
tlmgr install mathdesign

       I had a similar issue with sudo. tlmgr halts with a messsage 
starting with "Can't locate TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm in @INC" whereas it works 
perfectly as root. My guess is that there is a path issue...

    I installed the minimal edition of TeXLive 2008 from the net in
    Ubuntu 8.10.

>From what you wrote, it seems you installed it as root.  I suggest
removing the present installation and redoing it, this time running as
yourself (no sudo or root).  Then you can also run tlmgr as yourself.

    If the same is required by tlmgr, 

tlmgr does not require special privileges.

    why is it not recognized by sudo?

Because when you run sudo, you get a different PATH, that (evidently)
doesn't include the texlive/2008 directory.  To fix that, you're going
to have read up on sudo, bash initialization files, etc., etc.  I can't
give you a simple recipe, sorry.

    Why would tlmgr want to download the package at a created temp
    directory where it has no access (me either?).

tlmgr isn't telepathic.  It assumes that the directory it was installed
into is writable.  There's nothing else it can do.

Subject: [tex-live] wsuipa confusion?  tableaux package
Message-ID: <25119.1226190698@mole.cl.cam.ac.uk>

1. there are two latex packages for wsuipa -- ipalmacs.sty (by knappen)
and ipa.sty (from some original by roegel and brodnik).

for reasons i don't understand, there's a separate package "ipa" for
ipa.sty (and a .fd file) while the fonts, generic macros, and
ipalmacs.sty are in the wsuipa package.

does anyone know why this is so?  or is it all back in sebastian's time
and therefore forgotten?

(since wsuipa is thoroughly obsolete, it shouldn't matter, but i bet it
does...)


2.  i noticed that the tableaux package had been withdrawn.  i went back
to the original upload (2002 -- i created the xml in 2005, without
reference the upload, it would seem), and found that its author claimed
it was lppl.  i've done some feeble translations of the upload
description, and updated the catalogue.

it's not a terribly tidy package, but i believe it should be allowed to
live in tl.

normal effect.

The changes will be in tonight's update of install-tl.  No one but me

Spyros,
alternatively you can simply do:

  1. login as root

  2. run:  chown -R spyros:users /usr/local/texlive

Then you are the owner of the TeX Live tree.  There is no reason to
install software which you are going to maintain yourself as a
privileged user.

And please *****NEVER***** set $TEXMFCNF unless you are absolutely
sure that you understand how this extremely complex system works.

There is absolutely no reason to set $TEXMFCNF.  Setting $TEXMFCNF is
only good for headaches.  The default settings are fine.  You already
broke your system though you don't notice it at a first glance.

Please avoid the $TEXMFCNF environment variable.  It's not good for
anything but headaches.  I pray this for years without much success.

TEXMFCNF is by far the the most dangerous environment variable and I'm
wondering why it is so popular.  If it is recommended somewhere,
please let me know.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In my experience, simply retrying the same site rarely works, so a better
approach might be to use a list of different CTAN mirrors.  If they
all fail then
you have a serious network problem, so looping may not be much help.

there's a different problem with trying different sites, viz., mirror
consistency.

the ctan sites (cambridge, dante and tug) are within 15 minutes of each
other (unless actually broken).  however, the mirrors's consistency is
measured by our mirror monitor, and mirror.ctan.org will happily give
you something >24 hours old (i forget the exact cut-off).  using a
sequence of such mirrors was demonstrated very early in the life of
tl2008 to give incompatible results (not merely results with different
ages).

Sudo adjusts paths, so depending on your setup will probably not get the
TL bin directory.   I consider that a good thing, as TL really isn't something
that should be run by "root".  Use sudo to change ownership to a TL admin
user.

<http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Debian_installation>

I think the context minimal linux distribution sets TEXMFCNF (maybe to
avoid problems if one has been set by the user).

If you manage to install a dvi viewer on a debian system without
a tex distro, you get en error when texmf.cnf is not found.   Some
viewers may work if the environment setting overrides a compiled
in debian location.

Hi Ivan,
does your example file explicitly ask for cm-super?  This is a huge
package and only few people need it.  I can't imagine that beamer
depends on it.

    does your example file explicitly ask for cm-super?  This is a huge

On the contrary, the cm-super fonts are used by default for any document
using the EC encoding (among others) and when the map files enable use
of Type 1's for them (as they do by default).  
    
    I can't imagine that beamer depends on it.

Not directly.

Maybe.  One problem is that too many dependencies is just as bad as too
few.  Are xcolor and ifxetex *always* required?  Maybe, probably, but
it's not something I want to spend time researching.  If you do, ok, let
me know :).

Not cm-super, as I mentioned in the last message.  Even though it ends
up being required to get the expected output.  I don't have an answer ...

No.  We've discussed it but there's never seemed any particular use for

48 hours.  A cutoff of 24 reduced the number of mirrors available too

xcolor is not required in article mode using the noxcolor option OTOH,
you rarely compile a beamer document *only* in article mode :-) So I
would say yes, it is always required.

ifxetex is required by hyperref and other packages (probably graphicx,
didn't check) which are always loaded by beamer.

Now, both xcolor and ifxetex are in collection-latexrecommended (as well
as beamer). I thought our policy concerning dependencies was that people
are assumed to install collectionwise. So here the dependency would be
correct, since only pgf is not in the same collection as beamer.

Hi Manuel,

texmf-dist/tex/generic/ifxetex/ifxetex.sty

works under Plain TeX too.  Seems that it makes more sense to install
it unconditionally instead of putting it into a LaTeX related package.

  Reinhard

True enough.  I moved it to collection-basic, which is as basic it gets.

    would say yes, [xcolor] is always required.

Ok, I added it as a dependency of beamer.

    I thought our policy concerning dependencies was that people
    are assumed to install collectionwise. 

Yes in general, but our policies are rarely so strict :).  There is no
harm in adding package-level dependencies, especially of "important"
packages like beamer, when the issue arises and the solution is clear.

We definitely have no plans to try to systematically identify and record
all dependencies of all packages.

Thanks,

but unfortunately the timestamps of many of the files on these main

in other words, if one would try to first rsync from tug and then

Hi George,
thanks for the link.  I don't think that Context actually needs
TEXMFCNF.  Of course, if it already exists and points to the wrong
place, it's better to remove it.

texmf.cnf is always found without TEXMFCNF if the directory structure
is kept intact.  kpathsea looks for texmf.cnf files in a list of
directories.  There can be more than one texmf.cnf file and variables
set in one file will not be overwritten by another one.

The search order is:

  /path/to/texlive/bin/<platform>
  /path/to/texlive/bin
  /path/to/texlive
  /path/to/texlive/texmf/web2c

If you set TEXMFCNF=/path/to/texlive/texmf/web2c then only one
texmf.cnf file is found.  At a first glance this looks ok.  But
unfortunately you cannot put your local modifications into this one
because it is part of the distribution and it can happen that it is
replaced by a newer version by the updater.

Thus, TL-2008 provides a more or less empty texmf.cnf file
/path/to/texlive/texmf.cnf where users can make local changes.  This
will never be overwritten by the updater.

The nasty thing is that if you set TEXMFCNF, then only the config file
provided by the distribution is found.  You don't notice any problem
at all but if you have to change a setting locally later, it will not
work and it's absolutely not obvious why.

Setting TEXMFCNF in the environment means disabling some of kpathsea's
functionality.  The compiled-in defaults are fine for almost everybody.

Regarding Context:  As far as I know Context is updated quite
frequently.  Hence it would be nice if people can put local settings
into a file which is not overwritten by an update.  Nothing has to be
done except of getting rid of the nasty TEXMFCNF environment variable.

BTW, since a texmf.cnf file is first looked up in
/path/to/texlive/bin/<platform> , it's a nice opportunity to set
platform specific stuff there, for instance OSFONTDIR.
 
 > If you manage to install a dvi viewer on a debian system without

It has nothing to do with the environment.  It seems to be a
dependency problem.  Does Debian provide xdvi as a separate package?
xdvi is a shell script which depends on kpsewhich and some files in
the texmf tree and finally launches xdvi.bin.

A standalone xdvi could probably be created by just compiling it
without kpathsea, but it's something someone has to maintain and the
benefit is quite doubtful.

If xdvi doesn't find texmf.cnf, then the most likely reason is that
texmf.cnf doesn't exist, at least, sigh, if TEXMFCNF is not set. 

 > Some viewers may work if the environment setting overrides a
 > compiled in debian location.

There is no reason for Debian to compile absolute paths into the
binaries and it would be tremendously strange if they would do.  All
binaries linked against kpathsea will find their config files
(texmf.cnf) relative to their location in the file system.

I believe that the main reason why many people think that they have to
set TEXMFCNF is that the kpathsea concept is quite unique and almost
nobody is aware about this brilliant concept and how it works.

Regards,
  Reinhard

as far as i noticed, if you prepend a colon at the end of the TEXMFCNF
environment variable (e.g. TEXMFCNF=/path/to/my/custom/dir:) then this
will not prevent other texmf.cnf file(s) from being found and read.
that's how i set my custom settings when i need it.

Hi Vladimir,
I don't object if someone who absolutely knows what he is doing sets
TEXMFCNF.

What I tried to explain is that the default behavior is fine and you
can maintain your local settings already without the need to set
TEXMFCNF.

What I'm concerned about is that people think they have to set
TEXMFCNF in order to customize their system.  But this is wrong.

Regards,
  Reinhard

	I'd say that it's technically infeasible with the set of tools
	currently implemented.

	Would there be a tool to automatically validate (at least some
	of) the dependencies, it wouldn't be a big deal to record them
	all.

	The basic (if not obvious) ideas beyond this tool could be:

	* get the minimal possible TeX Live installation in a temporary
	  directory; install a package with all of its dependencies on
	  top of it;

	* ``confine'' the installation, so that nothing (except of the
	  basic system tools) will ever be used from outside of the
	  installation tree;

	* if the package provides any LaTeX classes, try to compile a
	  minimal possible test .tex file using each of them, e. g.:

\documentclass {CLASS}

\begin {document}
  Hello, world!
\end {document}

	  check for the errors;

	* likewise for the LaTeX packages, e. g.:

\documentclass {minimal}

\usepackage {PACKAGE}

\begin {document}
  Hello, world!
\end {document}

	* in the case of errors, check the log file for any missing
	  files; check the database for these files; make a report;

	* allow packages to supply these test .tex files, to override
	  the ones autogenerated by the tool;

	* once the package is checked, destroy the whole installation
	  directory before trying another one (unless, say, there were
	  errors and a kind of ``debug'' mode is in use.)

It needs it for MarkIV. MarkIV needs lua-cache, which needs
luatools --generate, which need TEXMFCNF. Period.

I am not happy about the lua-cache/luatools concoction, but this is the
way Hans is going.

Already several times proposed, but nobody ever came up actually writing
this tool, esp. dealing with all the different options of various
classes.

Dependencies are generally only dealt with on collection level. So if
you install one collection and all depending ones you will (should) get
functional packages.

But we are not Debian.

If you can help porting aptitude/apt-get/APT to work with the TeX Live
infra structure that would be very much appreciated.

If it produces decent and halfway correct dependency lists, yes. We are
already now adding package level dependencies on a case by case base, as
Karl wrote.

luckily, the mirror director will never switch you between two ctan
sites, since they're all in different countries.

i presume that the same problem can arise between two mirrors of the
same site, one of which uses ftp and the other uses rsync.

ftp mirroring is broken, anyway -- always has been -- but we've lots of
experience of working around the problems (that is to say, rainer has,
and some of it has rubbed off on jim and me).  rainer's mirror of
cambridge (for the things that i'm the "gateway" for) is currently
running rsync.

... enough of this rambling.

in which case the ftp client is not using the MDTM commands to find
out exact time stamps but relies on directory listings which are
timezone-dependent and don't even show timestamps with a second
precision, but at most with minute precision. and indeed i saw some
files which have difference in timestamps (between different ctan
nodes) of a few minutes or seconds. in other words, it is not very
robust system. e.g. it may not detect the change of a file if it was
changed within a minute, with the same size.

an example of a good ftp client which uses MDTM and can do miroring is
lftp (but rsync is more efficient anyway).

good to know. hopefully all main nodes will switch to rsync soon.

Message-ID: <bfeb3bf10811100106s1655ba79oc0ef37482886745f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

On Windows XP, issuing command such as:

    extractbb ArtOfNoize.jpg

generates an xbb file with garbaged characters at its end.
(for instance, "ArtOfNoise.xbb?,")

This problem does not occur always;
extractbb shows weird behavior only with some graphic files.
In a directory in which I have executed extractbb for 53 jpg files,
10 xbb files thus generated have garbaged filename.

You may download one of the graphic files at issue from:
http://people.ktug.or.kr/~nomos/mine/ArtOfNoise.jpg .

There's no such a problem on Mac of Linux platform.
So I think it may be an issue of texlive rather than that of dvipdfmx.

As others have already observed, there are many potential
issues if one tries to build a local CTAN (or TeX Live)
mirror from multiple CTAN mirrors rather than from one.
But in my experience (admittedly very limited), retrying
Rsync.TeX.Ac.Uk usually /does/ work; my last full TeX
Live mirror required at most five retries in total before
the mirroring was complete, and as Norbert observed, each
retry (usually) has less work to do than the one before.

But I haven't yet found an elegant syntax for

	Repeat Until Rsync ...

in Win/32 CMD.

Another possibility is to use a full TL and run latex with the
--recorder option. Dealing with TeX errors, esp. for file not found, is
not always easy.

But as Norbert and others said, someone has to do it, and find a
reasonable way of dealing with class and package options...

That needs to be fixed.  I think linux package managers rely on
having versions in filenames.  You get a master list of the
current versions, then depending on the tool, it can  go
shopping across a bunch of mirror sites for the version it
needs.  Problems occur if you get an old master list, as
mirror sites don't store old versions, but it is much more
robust than being tied to just one mirror.

Maybe there is some traffic shaping between you and the
CTAN site.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping>

You might avoid this by limiting the rsync rate yourself, but it
is a bit tricky since the external limit may depend on the
competing demand from external sources, so you can only
guess at what limit to impose on your own rsync.   There are
reports that some providers mark any IP that has used P2P
for shaping, and that both ftp and rsync are subject to shaping, so
your thruput may be affected by your usage history.  Shaping is often
imposed during peak hours, so you may find things work better
if you do the transfers at some carefully selected time.

<http://carlhutzler.com/blog/2008/02/07/traffic-shaping-and-off-site-backups/>
discusses using traffic shaping via a DD-WRT router to keep his backups from
slowing down his other traffic, but the same approach should work to reduce
your chances of being hit by external shaping.

Linux has <http://lartc.org/manpages/tc.txt> -- tc - show / manipulate traffic
control settings, and various more user friendly wrappers for tc.

There appear to be a number of "free" traffic shaping tools for Win32.

Maybe <http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/powershell/powershell_loops.htm>
could help.   Another route to take advantage of linux tools is to run
linux in a small
VM or maybe colinux.

just for the record: i don't shape at this end (rsync isn't a problem
for me -- it's ftp that's going to get rate-limited soon, if things
don't calm down...).

i don't suppose you actually meant my end, but i thought it was worth
while clarifying that point.

George -- Thank you for your suggestions.  As
far as traffic shaping goes, I find a significant
improvement in network responsiveness if I
keep P2P traffic to the early hours of the
morning, but I have neither the time not
the inclination to go further than that.

As far as loops in Win/XP go, I unashamedly
state that I am a Win/XP fan, so I am keen
to find a pure Win/XP solution.  But I haven't
found one yet :-)  Powershell looks interesting;
I shall have to check if I already have the
necessary prerequisites.

Hi
There are various possibilities for programming loops with XP
as VBScript, Javascript, Powershell and pur *.bat programming.
But I feel no need to use them. The kind of loops you intend to use
are in my opinion the wrong way. All you get is a large traffic
on the network and large load on the server.

Rsync works very stable as long as the network connection and server
responce are ok. High polling frequencies will not be good so.

A broken rsync of TeX Live probably will not do great harm. Try it next
day again - a quite good loop by cron or some XP tool.


A more general question: It is a great achievment to have the upgrade
possibility with tlmgr but does TeX Live really need daily or more
fequently updates?

I recently reported this bug on XeTeX mailing list but with the

linux build and everything is just fine on i386 linux. I also have attched
the output as PDF.

http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2008-November/011177.html


I am using TeXLive 2008.

I tried unicode-math package on 32 bin Linux and it is fine, but if you use
that on 64 bit Linux, you will see some strange things. At first I thought
maybe this is a bug of a specific 64bit Linux distribution but I tried
various other 64 bit Linux dstribution and the same happened.

Try:

Yes, I saw this on the XeTeX list. This is almost certainly an  
internal XeTeX bug, but is difficult for me to investigate directly at  
the moment as I don't have a 64-bit environment for testing/debugging.  
All the 64-bit builds I know of have been done by others remote from me.

I'll try to look into it, but hands-on access to a machine where the  
problem occurs would simplify life greatly!

Wolfgang, thank you too for your observations.
Bu in this case, I am not convinced by your
arguments :

Are either of these the case ?  The problem arose when
a "reset by peer" caused Rsync to bomb out before
completing its mirroring.  I asked if Rsync supported
"/retries=" or "/retry", and (I think it was Norbert)
suggested that it didn't but a simple iteration should
suffice.  I used iteration successfully, but had no way
of knowing the correct upper bound, and then another
contributor suggested a Repeat or While loop, checking
the return status of Rsync.  These seem to me to be
exactly what is needed : they retry only as often as
necessary, and I(as far as I can see), impose hardly
any greater load than the first Rsync would have
done had it run to completion.

Thanks Mr. Kew

I was just curious to know why this happening. That is all.

I can help with the testing on x86_64-linux.

Thanks

Dear Reinhard -- Thank /you/ for your suggestions.
Many people are proving very helpful on this topic :
a good indication of the cameraderie of the TeX
community.  If I may respond briefly :

1) The error reported by Rsync :

> 2008/archive/bin-dvipdfmx.hppa-hpux.tar.lzma
> rsync: writefd_unbuffered failed to write 4092 bytes: phase "unknown" [generator]: Connection reset by peer (104)rsync:
> rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /home/lapo/packaging/tmp/rsync-2.6.6/io.c(584)
> rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /home/lapo/packaging/tmp/rsync-2.6.6/io.c(1099) 

2) Problems with .exes  Not noticed so far, but there
were certainly problems earlier resulting from incorrect
permissions.  I might summarise by saying I am using
Rsync to create a CTAN/TeX Live mirror and doing local
installs that way rather than using the DVD (I forget
who suggested this, but experience suggests it is a good
route and a more efficient one).

3) Wget.  That is how I started mirroring, but someone
(?Robin?) pointed out that Rsync is far more efficient,
since it fetches only what is needed rather than
everything ...

4) Loops.  My "Rsync" invocation is via a shortcut "Mirror.lnk",
with properties :

	rsync -av --delete rsync://rsync.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/ CTAN\systems\texlive\tlnet\2008

If I then wrap this in a CMD script, as per

	:Loop
	Mirror.lnk
	If ErrorLevel 1 Goto Loop

the test for Errorlevel is performed /before/ Rsync has done
anything, which I do not understand (it then goes on to
do Rsync).  I could remove the shortcut and just launch
Rsync directly from the CMD file, but the shortcut is very
useful for manual invocations and I would prefer not to
ditch it (or duplicate its contents) if at all possible.

5) [Slightly off-topic]

I prepared to perform an install, as above, at a friend's home,
and took my D:\TeX contents in their entirety on DVD.  When I came
to copy the DVD back to his hard disc, I found that the shortcuts
had been /replaced/ by copies of the programs (or CMD files) to
which they referred :-(((  I have never previously heard that
shortcuts are not copied as-is.

Probably the file system used on the DVD does not support shortcuts
and thence your burning SW made file copies.

I understand your logic, Zdenek, but surely a Win/32
"Shortcut" is no more than a binary file, the contents
of which are comprehensible to Windows but not necessarily
to anything else (such a shortcut is attached : it
will be interesting to see if it can be unmangled
on any non-Windows system).  So since binary files
do not need to be "supported" by the DVD file system,
but rather simply stored therein, I am still unclear
why it was effectively "expanded in place" rather
than copied as-is.

** Phil.

P.S. Below is how "Notepad" renders the shortcut :

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.00.0811111414520.9100@bk-ws-09.proteosys>

Hi,

Markus Kohm announced today (on the internal Dante mailing list) that he will no 
longer work with CTAN.  It is his reaction to a mail from me, asking him to 
upload his packages in a different way.

What I did not realize until today: he had already stopped uploading 
koma-script to CTAN, and he relased koma-script version 3 last week.

I will update the copy on CTAN accordingly, but we (the CTAN team) cannot track 
changes to packages unless CTAN updates can be automated.

Sad, isn't it?

 Rainer

I guess I can write a script that checks sarovar or whatever and upload
it, but I am not sure if I want to do that, after all the insults of
Kohm's side.

> Sad, isn't it?

Honestly, I don't care. If he is not interested in supporting the users,
meaning cooperation with CTAN and at least TeX Live, well, I wish him
good luck. 

We (Karl and me) have already changed our packaging to comply with his
funny requirements, but he still insulted us as licensing traitors etc
etc. Honestly, I dont care anymore.

One should remember that in TeX Live we include what is on CTAN. So if
there will be no koma script anymore, it will disappear from texlive,
and via that from all the distributions.

Sad for the users, yes, they can complain and should complain. But I
guess it wont help.

Best wishes

Norbert

Is this something that a "facilitator" could help resolve ?
I know from personal experience how easy it is to become
frustrated with another party through the medium of e-mail,
and I wonder if someone who knows Markus personally could
discuss the issue(s) with him and reach an amicable conclusion ?

We all know the shortcomings of mail and are in the same timezone, so
I expect people to act reasonably and use the phone if they have real
problems. Markus didn't do this. And mediators: The easiest choice
would be DANTE. But I doubt that many here give a damn anymore.

Testing isn't really the issue right now -- you've already tested  
(thanks!), and it looks like you've encountered a bug (unfortunately).  
The issue now is that debugging is generally easier and more efficient  
with local access to a system that reproduces the problem, but I don't  
have one available here.

MikTeX already has a prepacked package with version 3 (file date is

I doubt it. His (rather long) message to the internal dante mailing list states 
that he neither wants to follow our guidelines nor continue the discussion.

OK, I don't want to pursue this one unnecessarily
(I have never used Komascript, but I am aware than
many others rely on it), but I have experienced
the frustrations of dealing with a seemingly
intransigent bureaucracy (or oligarchy!) so even
knowing nothing of the rights or wrongs of the
case I feel a little sympathy for Markus.  But
if the general opinion is that no further progress
is possible, I will, somewhat reluctantly, leave it
at that.

I assume you are installing from DVD, and you probably have mounted the
DVD with the
	noexec
option, which prohibits executing binaries from the DVD. Without that it
cannot continue.

Please mount the DVD with -o exec

Yes, indeed.

Please note that the KOMA-Script documentation project at
<http://komascript.de/> does not provide a download page for the
KOMA-Script bundle proper. The "download" menu at the right-top side of
the page only links to a general download page. The berliOS link leads
to the general overview page of the project. So if KOMA-Script is not to
be found on CTAN any more, users may find it hard to find the current
version of the bundle.

If you speak German you might also like to have a look at Markus' blog
because he made his announcement at a mailing list reserved for DANTE
members only, as Rainer already said.

http://www.komascript.de/node/944
http://www.komascript.de/node/959

AFAICS, Markus seems determined to stay away from CTAN.

It is all automatic. If there is a new version of a package on CTAN, it
will (manually, or better semi-automatic) merged into TeX Live. From
there on the rest is automated, generation of packages, push out to CTAN
etc.

Need? I am sure there is no need for daily updates. But we leave that to
the user, he can update once a week, once a month, once a year, whenever
he feels like it.

This ranting happened after his discussion with me. He writes a lot of
crap instead of checking what we have done, and what I told him that we
will do. No, he is not interested in actually resolving problems, he is
only interested in spreading FUD, in bashing us.

Another useless ranting about common package formats between
distributors. He could step forward and make a deal with MikTeX, we are
open, and ready to change and adapt the format.

GRIMSBY (n.)
A lump of something gristly and foultasting concealed in a mouthful of
stew or pie. Grimsbies are sometimes merely the result of careless
cookery, but more often they are placed there deliberately by
Freemasons. Grimbies can be purchased in bulk from any respectable
Masonic butcher on giving him the secret Masonic handbag. One is then
placed correct masonic method of dealing with it. If the guest is not
a Mason, the host may find it entertaining to watch how he handles the
obnoxious object. It may be (a) manfully swallowed, invariably
bringing tears to the eyes. (b) chewed with resolution for up to
twenty minutes before eventually resorting to method (a) (c) choked on
fatally. The Masonic handshake is easily recognised by another Mason
incidentally, for by it a used grimsby is passed from hand to
hand. The secret Masonic method for dealing with a grimsby is as
follows : remove it carefully with the silver tongs provided, using
the left hand. Cross the room to your host, hopping on one leg, and
ram the grimsby firmly up his nose, shouting, 'Take that, you smug
Masonic bastard.'

    3) Wget.  That is how I started mirroring, but someone
    (?Robin?) pointed out that Rsync is far more efficient,
    since it fetches only what is needed rather than
    everything ...

For the record, wget does whatever it can to avoid fetching
"everything", e.g., using If-Modified-Since for http fetches, and
directory listings for ftp fetches.  But neither of these are nearly as
reliable as the modification time support that is an integral part of
the rsync protocol.

In addition, rsync has a clever block comparison algorithm such that if
only a few blocks change in a huge file, only the changed blocks get
transferred.  I've found that can make a huge difference.

Ok, enough off topic praise of rsync ...

I'm going to be using the psgreek greek package, including one of the

I tried contacting the author of the font to verify address to send 
payment, and the message was bounced as undeliverable.

The address I tried was

rhancock at dircon.co.uk

The font creator is

Ralph Hancock

Would anyone know how to contact him so I can properly pay for usage of 
the fonts?

Try it without the initial "r". That was valid fairly recently, at

remove: dry run, no changes will be made
remove bin-bibtex
remove bin-bibtex.universal-darwin
remove bin-kpathsea
remove bin-kpathsea.universal-darwin

Tried with  luatex or bibtex or bibtex or even bin-afm2pl it does not
happen. Looks like bin-bibtex is booby-trapped

Yes. Fixed with tomorrows net-installer (by day after tomorrow on the

would have been much easier and faster ;-)

There is a bug on the above point in luatex (win32)
in tl 2008 (a bug in the lua51 library).
You can update the luatex and run ConTeXt mkiv on windows.
Please ask in the context list, then context practitioners
will answer your questions.

Message-ID: <491C15C9.5020904@ptb.de>


If I call

  texdoc koma-script

I get

  texdoc info: koma-script aliased to scrguien

A better result gives

  texdoc komascript

which shows a html page with links to the german and the english
documentations. The same should happen for the following calls:

  texdoc koma-script
  texdoc scrartcl
  texdoc scrreprt
  texdoc scrbook
  texdoc scrlettr
  texdoc scrlttr2

Thanks in advance,

...Rolf

who knows?  you don't say which user group(s) you belong to, so we can't

fwiw, i've had copies from both the groups i belong to, but if they'd
not arrived, i would approach the user group rather than this list
(which has nothing to do with the distribution, once the master disc has
been made).

If I remember correctly, "lzmadecoder.win32.exe"
uses Unix conventions for I/O, and therefore
requires the output to be redirected to a file,
as in

	C:> lzmadecoder.win32 TexLive2008.iso.lzma > TexLive2008.iso

but I cannot remember whether the input stream also
needs to be redirected; if it does, then you would need
to write something along the lines of :

	C:> lzmadecoder.win32 < TexLive2008.iso.lzma > TexLive2008.iso

Can you please fetch a current installer, then fetch TLPostActions.pm
from the svn repository and replace the one in the installer
(tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPostActions.pm) with the one from svn, and retry. I
have added code that it touches at one ttf or otf file.
Hope that helps.

It should echo something like
	touching foobar.ttf in C:\windows\fonts to make fc-cache work
if it did it.

Thanks for testing.

I'm afraid there isn't a single, canonical source of all information  
at the moment. Try

    texdoc XeTeX-notes

for some basic but fairly old documentation;

    texdoc XeTeX-reference

for Will's more recent "quick reference" guide; and

    texdoc fontspec

for the fontspec package, which is the primary interface to XeTeX and  
fonts for most users (i.e., those using LaTeX).

There's also The XeTeX Companion, a "work in progress" by Michel  
Goossens, at <http://xml.web.cern.ch/XML/lgc2/xetexmain.pdf>.  
(Googling for "xetex manual" found that as the first hit for me.)

Beyond that, the XeTeX mailing list <http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/XeTeX 
 > is probably the best resource.

OK, many thanks : how much work would it take
to ensure that TeXdoc XeTeX displayed this
information (i.e., the suggestions that
you have just made in the message to which
I am replying), and can TeXdoc generate
hyperlinks in the output such that one could
then follow those links to try your suggestions ?

Quite bad indeed.

> Is there no documentation on XeTeX that is accessible to TeXdoc,

First, when texdoc doesn't show you what you want (but still finds a
result), you should always try the -l option. Here you have

mpg at roth:~% texdoc -l XeTeX
texdoc info: No exact match, trying full search mode.
1	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/xetex/base/XeTeX-notes.pdf
2	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/english/xetexref/XeTeX-reference.pdf
3	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-doc/doc/english/xetexref/XeTeX-reference.pdf

On windows you also have ifxetex.pdf because your filesystem isn't case
sensitive (I should maybe fix texdoc so that it behaves the same on both
platforms), and why the 2 is duplicated, I don't know yet.

Second, there is currently an informal convention that you should add
-ref to the name of an engine to see its reference manual and -man to
see its man page (when available): it works with etex-ref, pdftex-ref,
luatex-ref. I can't remember why I didn't make such an alias for xetex,
but probably I was hesitating between XeTeX-notes and XeTeX-reference.

> and if not, how is one best advised to learn how to use XeTeX?

Informal advice: if you're using LaTeX, then probably the best place to
start are the fontspec and xltxtra manuals. There is alos online a XeTeX
Companion by M. Goossens.

The suggestionS? Well, atm we can't make more than one alias on a given
name, so either we let texdoc search using filenames and we can have
more than one result, or we use an alias if we think the filename
doesn't give the correct result but then we can have only one result.

This may (and probably should) change later. I have a lot of little
things to fix before changing this.

I don't understand what you mean "links": texdoc is (currently) a
command-line tool. Do you want it to generate a html page and open it in
a viewer ? la mthelp?

I'd like to recall that the search mode can be useful for such cases:

texdoc -s xetex

gives you a lot of results (unfortunately, some of them are not
pertinent) and you just have to press a number in order to display one
of them in a viewer.

It is not up to tex-live team but rather to the authors: if there are
few documents for some package or bundle then there should be an
"umbrella" document (like in oberdiek superbundle) which opens by
%texdoc oberdiek
and contains all links to individual packages

Yes, that is what I meant.  I was asking Jonathan
to estimate the work involved in producing such
an umbrella document, whilst asking the TeX Live
team at the same time if such documents could
themselves be interactive.

Well, it may be a command-line tool in terms of
how one invokes it, but my (admittedly very
limited) experience of its output is that it
is anything but command-line : it appears to
launch the document that it finds, which in
turn launches a viewer appropriate to that
document format ...

However, although it was not what I originally
meant, I can see that your idea (your second
sentence above) might be exactly what I am
proposing.  In other words, when TeXdoc
encounters one perfect match, it performs
its current behaviour; if it can perform only
a fuzzy match (or if the user asks for a
fuzzy match), then it should launch what
Victor has just termed an "umbrella" document,
which is itself hyperlinked to the documents
that have just been fuzzy matched.

So you may want to put a line with

mode=mixed

in your personnal texdoc.cnf file. That way, if texdoc finds a single
match, it just displays it; if there is more than one match, it asks you
to choose one.

Message-ID: <491DE387.9030604@pakin.org>

Although TeX Live 2008 includes the fundus package, which provides
LaTeX interfaces to various fonts, TL2008 doesn't seem to provide all
of the fonts themselves:

    calligra: callig15
    la:       la14 and lla14
    pvscript: script10 and scriptb10
    twcal:    twcal14
    va:       va14 and vacal14

    $ egrep '(callig15|l?la14|scriptb?10|twcal14|va(cal)?14)\.mf' tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
    $

Did these fonts disappear for a reason (e.g., licensing restrictions),
or this an oversight?  I'd sure like to see them back in TeX Live if
possible.

Thanks,

I'm not sure about all of them but at least some were removed due to
licensing restrictions and/or for lack of anyway to determine the
licensing terms. For example the original author of calligra is unknown
and there is no indication of the intended licensing.

Is the author not Peter Vanroose, as claimed in the TeX Catalogue ?

calligra.mf states that:

%% Changes made by S. Dachian ( Serguei.Dachian at univ-lemans.fr ) at 05/99
%% to correct a bug in "W" letter, preventing the font from being correctly
%% compiled by METAFONT.  Also a hyphenation character added to the font.

I'd assumed this meant those listed as the current maintainers didn't

Sure, but what am I asking? He isn't listed as responsible for wsuipa
on CTAN and looking at the files isn't helping me figure out which he's
responsible for or what I'm asking him to clarify licensing for.

dachian may not have known, but it's fairly clear somewhere or other
(i've not looked at the files today, but i certainly got that impression
when writing the catalogue entry).

the simple fact is, that except in the sparsest of cases, these files
are *always* unclear.  (the truly sparse files contain no information at
all, and the cataloguer is often left guessing what the macros do, at
all.)  the authors most files that predate ctan never really considered
_distribution_ (in our sense) at all, so only a few those who were
writing utilities, and had been infected by gnu, actually tended to
write licence statements at all.

which is why there are still so many uncatalogued files on the archive,
and so many marked unknown licence in the catalogue (738 when i started
re-evaluating, 438 now -- gosh, i've just completed my 300th, and 199 of
the changes are to noinfo).

and scott -- the prudent distributor _won't_ take anything that hasn't a
permissive licence.  one might guess that (say) vanroose is a decent
person and won't sue, but eventually one will make a slip and get sued.
and where will the money to pay damages come from?  and that's why the
files you mention have disappeared.

pierre works in the same institute that originated the fonts (he, too,
is a linguist).  he's helped me in the past, on cataloguing issues.

So am I asking about the licensing for the wsuipa package i.e. all of
it? Or am I trying to get contact information for somebody else?

# uname -psr
FreeBSD 7.1-PRERELEASE i386

tlmgr does not work correctly on FreeBSD. First of all, tlmgr uses tar
with option --owner, which is not valid for bsd tar (the system's tar
on freebsd). This can be bypassed by using the gnu tar from ports and
changing the tlmgr script. The ports system install gnu tar with the
name 'gtar' .

But even after that change, when using tlmgr to update a package the
following message appears:
# tlmgr update beamer
tlmgr: installation location
ftp://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
TLPOBJ currently supports only plain or lzma containers at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 516.
update: beamer (7340 -> 11236) ...

the message at the 'TLPOBJ' line above is not very clear for me. I saw
at the /temp directory that the
texlive.tlpdb.<process number>.lzma file downloaded and decompressed
successfully just before the message above, and finally beamer was not
updated. The same happens with any package.

Since I do not speak perl, could you please give me some advice?

Dear Karl, Norman

Yesterday tlmgr update from ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical gone
rogue and began to remove packages en mass. I interrupted it and
reinstalled all the collections
successfully

However today it began to complain that

Can't locate object method "option" via package "TeXLive::TLPDB" at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr line 1088.


I hope for suggestion. Victor

Found :

My suggestion is to go to
 ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl/tlpkg/TeXLive/
and explicitly download the *.pm files and manually put them into
tlpkg/tlpkg/TeXLive.  Then visit
 http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
and manually put that into texmf/script/texlive.

After that,  tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra  will hopefully run
ok, and get things back in a reasonable state.

We're working on an easier way to recover from the "broken tlmgr"
problem, but for now, the above is it.

This fixed the problem. Should be in FAQ. And there should be link
from tlmgr --help  to FAQ

PS latexmk was fixed. I feel myself cheated: no more subject for jokes :-)

I will try to investigate that.

Ahhhh, yes, thanks, that is a bug in the current tlcritical *itself*,
not in the tlmgr that is in tlnet.

In this case, until we have fixed it, please use
	tlmgr -location .../tlcritical install --reinstall bin-texlive texlive.infra
should do the trick, or get the
	.../tlcritical/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
and run it.

Same problem, old version in tlcritical which was broken or
texlive.infra not updated. Please get the update-tlmgr-latest.sh and try
that. Thanks

Please replacee your tlmgr.pl with the one attached, or get it from SVN,
or from tomorrows tlcritical via the update-tlmgr-latest.sh or by direct
installation 
	tlmgr -location .../tlcritical install --reinstall bin-texlive

That should fix that problem. Hope it works now, please let me know.

Just wondering if there's any reason smaller.sty is included in TL when
it appears to be a package for LaTeX 2.09 and is superseded by the
LaTeX 2e package relsize according to the catalogue.

On the other hand, these are not flagged as superseded but not included
either:

... which is not the same as the README on CTAN.... so whether they are

the file might be interpreted as saying that the useless pl fonts are

i wouldn't know about the .sty (except by reading the .ins).

i certainly knew about that when i reset the licence in september; the
package is definitely not debian-free, but that's not required for the
"other-free" licence statement in the catalogue.  i've discussed dealing
with "no modify" packages ... karl's general feeling. last i asked, was
that with no other restriction, such packages are good enough for tl.

(note, this doesn't seem to me to affect elvish, where we really do have
to modify the package to distribute sensible...)

The README in TL is *not* ambiguous, though:

--- excerpt from README in TL ---

(README changed 13/06/90; conditions relaxed)

*** Important Note ***

These files are copyright (c) 1987 J.C. Bradfield.
They are distributed on the following conditions:
  (a) You may make the source and generated fonts available at your site.
  (b) You may use the generated fonts in any academic or non-commercial
      publication. You may not charge, or allow any other user at your
      site to charge, for use of these fonts.
  (c) You, or any user at your site, may make modifications for his or
      her own use. If you distribute any modified form of these files, you
      must include the original files clearly labelled as such.
      If you produce modifications that seem useful, you are asked to
      send them to me, so that they can be incorporated into the master
      files.
  (d) You may redistribute these files to single individuals (who are
      asked to act on the note below), but you may *not* place these
      files in a public archive site without my permission.

The tengwar font is still under development; when I consider that a
reasonably final version has been produced, conditions (c) and (d) 
will no longer apply; but until then I ask you to comply.


*** PLEASE *** If you use these fonts, let me know (at the contact
address below). One day, I may actually get round to the necessary tidying 
and improvement, at which time I shall want to replace all earlier versions.
In particular, I hope that the facilities of TeX 3.0 will allow a great
improvement in the "user interface" to the fonts.

missed that ...

If "no modify" packages are permitted in TL, moreover, then some of the
packages I reported as non-free and which have subsequently been
removed from TL should not have been. futhark, for example.

I had understood that TL followed the FSF/Debian guidelines, though,
with FSF taking precedence in most cases of conflict (so that some
documentation is acceptable to TL but not Debian, for example).

Please do.

As to the hang: PostMessage doesn't seem to do the job, so I am
going to try SendMessageTimeout instead.

A question: are these results from your virtual machine or from your
live system? All these problems cost us an enormous amount of time,
so I would like to be sure that we are debugging the TL installer,
not your Windows installation.

"Doesn't do the job" as in "Doesn't send a message",
or "Doesn't cure the hang" ?  As far as I can tell,
it cures the hang, but I have never seen any
message from the installer that I can recognise
as such, so I do not know if any of the versions
have ever successfully produced a message on
my system.  What format would you expect the
message to take, and in which window should it
occur ?

Well, I have no wish to place any unneeded load on your time,
but equally I do not have any evidence to suggest that my
Windows installation is defective : the most recent error
reports were all from the live system, because having
proved in the VM that the hang did not occur, I needed
to get back to trying to find out why it /did/ occur
on the live system.  I think it is fair to suggest that
if SendMessage can cause a hang on my system, it can
cause a hang on others, and therefore we should try
to identify the cause and eliminate it.  To support
this, I think it is clear that Microsoft would not
have gone to the trouble of writing SendMessageTimeout
if timeouts were not expected to (a) occur, and
(b) cause problems.

OK, as I suspected, these are not caused by transient
errors : the files listed below (and others
that could not be captured in the length of transcript
recorded) are read-only.  We need to track down from
where this read-only flag is coming.  The attached
"read-only.txt" shews the set of files under "texmf-dist"
that are flagged as read-only.  As far as I can see,
it is only the "texmf-dist" branch that is affected.

Right, further testing reveals that while
WinZip extracts the files from "vertex.doc.tar"
correctly (i.e., without adding a read-only
attribute), the supplied TAR does not.
This was the test incantation, with
default directory

	F:\TeX\Attribute-test

 > F:\TeX\attribute-test>F:\TeX\CTAN\systems\texlive\tlnet\2008\install-tl\tlpkg\installer\tar -x -f F:\TeX\CTAN\systems\texlive\tlnet\2008\archive\vertex.doc.tar

and here is the resulting directory listing :

> F:\TeX\attribute-test>dir /s /a:r
>  Volume in drive F is Andrew's 120Gb disc
>  Volume Serial Number is E45C-B9AE
>

whilst here is the corresponding listing but
using the selector "a:-r" (to shew files that
are /not/ marked as read-only) on the files
extracted using WinZip :

It is supposed to notify the system that environment variables have
changed. This notification doesn't seem to have taken place with
PostMessage, i.e if I start a new command console then it shows the
old environment variables. This is not fatal to the installation,
since a re-login will take care of the notification. But according
to you it does cure the hang.

In the case of the hung broadcast message, you pointed out a simple
workaround that can be implemented whether or not we can reproduce
the problem. I just need to check that it doesn't upset anything.
As I wrote above, my even simpler workaround - which hasn't been
committed yet - does create a new problem but maybe
SendMessageTimeout does better in this respect.

But in general, it is difficult to fix problems that we cannot
reproduce. If you can't reproduce the problem on your virtual
machine then there is a strong possibility that we won't be able to
reproduce the problem either.

But I agree that it would be desirable if users got a clear message
in case of non-fatal problems.

OK, all understood.  So a broadcast message
in this context is not something that (say)
produces a human-visible popup, but is
rather an inter-process message that should
be acted on intelligently by the receiving
process(es) without human intervention.

All is much now clearer, and -- had I known
this at the outset -- I could myself have
saved much time experimenting with turning
on and off the Windows messenger service !

    with "no modify" packages ... karl's general feeling. last i asked, was
    that with no other restriction, such packages are good enough for tl.

Really?  I don't recall the context in which we were discussing that,
but "no modify" is definitely nonfree.  Such packages should not be
marked other-free.  

In the case of grnumalt, it is marked other-nonfree (which is good), and
I already removed it from TL some time ago, for precisely this reason.

Clea, your understanding and work to date are just fine (and greatly
appreciated), no need to change course.

Thanks,
Karl

Is there any easy way of figuring out which packages are present in an
installation but have been removed from TL? I'm guessing this was
removed before tlmgr removed packages no longer in TL from local
installations. I would prefer to get my local version synced because it
is somewhat confusing at the moment. (Anything I want which is non-free
can go in texmf-local where it doesn't cause confusion.)

Thanks,
Clea

That lists packages which have been removed both locally and at source,
correct? Is there any easy way to figure out what's no longer in TL
(removed at source) but is still installed locally - such as grnumalt,
in my case, at least.

Thanks,

Download tlpdb from the server and grep '^name ' | sort >/tmp/serverpkgs
Run the same grep|sort >/tmp/localpkgs on your local tlpdb.
Then run comm -3 /tmp/localpkgs /tmp/serverpkgs
The first column are packages appearing locally but not on the server.
The second column are packages appearing on the server but not locally.

Hope this helps,

error.

Very helpful. For some reason, I didn't realise that the local copy of
the database would still list them.

I get 2 errors on trying to remove the packages no  longer in TL:
...
latex2man: not removed, referenced in collection-binextra
...
psbao: not removed, referenced in collection-pstricks
...
tlmgr: actually removed these packages: answers futhark grnumalt

Are these expected?

These are both very new packages and are actually in TL.  You probably
got a slightly old server tlpdb.

    tlmgr: actually removed these packages: answers futhark grnumalt
    guitbeamer newalg newthm niceframe numline oca schedule

That looks pretty right.

    tlmgr uses tar with option --owner, 

Thanks for the report.  Guess we need to change that around.

    tlmgr: installation location
    ftp://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
    TLPOBJ currently supports only plain or lzma containers at
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 516.
    update: beamer (7340 -> 11236) ...

Well, it shouldn't be happening.  But that message doesn't appear at
line 516 any more.  So my first question is, what version of tlmgr are
you running?  (Run tlmgr --version to see.)  And, if it's not fairly
recent, please try updating following the info at
http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html and see if that helps anything.

Best,

Great. I just think it will be less confusing if I know whatever is in
my local installation is meant to be free and not something which might
have already been dealt with.

    Just wondering if there's any reason smaller.sty is included in TL 

It's only included as part of epslatex-fr, not on its own.

    On the other hand, these are not flagged as superseded but not included
    either:
 	resumemac
 	varisize

Well, I guess I have nothing against them, but there are a lot of other
more recent attempts at resumes and font size stuff in plain now.  I
can't say I know of anything that exactly supersedes them, either.  Hmm.
I'll think about it.

    ... which is not the same as the README on CTAN.... so whether they are

The one on CTAN is newer (and free, though suboptimal).  I updated
elvish in TL.

It's easier to help you if you provide a minimal example file which
demonstrates the problem.

Telling us that you encountered an error is not very helpful unless
you provide the the error message itself.  If you don't understand the
error message, the best thing you can do is to post the .log file to
the mailing list.

The same happened to me on Thursday-Friday on Mac OS X, but I thought  
I had done something really wrong because...

1) First, I upgraded my Ubuntu distribution, the usual way, and  
everything went well.

2) Then I tried to update my Mac OS laptop, also the usual way, and  
after upgrading bin-texlive, I think, it went nuts, saying

> Installation of new version of <such and such package> did fail,  
> trying to unwind!


I tried again and it said that many packages had been ``forcibly  
removed'', so I tried to reinstall the collections of such packages to  
no avail. So i tried with ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical, and it  
removed almost everything!

Long story short, I reinstalled MacTeX, then did a

sudo tlmgr update bin-texlive texlive.infra

and then upgraded again the usual way, and everything was OK!

3) Afraid of what might happen, before upgrading my Mac OS desktop, I  
tared my 2008 directory, then upgraded first bin-texlive texlive.infra  
and only then upgraded the rest and everything went smoothly.

Best,

Axel

Thank you for your responce,

  tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2008

which is the most recent I think. Please notice that the upgrade of tlmgr
has been done by hand.
But the message persists (now at line 519):

sorry ... i've been sickening for another dvt (in a lot of pain), and i
just wasn't thinking.  the discussion that was being blurred in my mind
was about packages which are "modify only with file name change" (which
used to be a provision of the lppl, clea.)

hear, hear.

i must sort out access for clea to the catalogue repository -- in
particular, this would sort the issue of what things are still in tl and
what aren't.  each catalogue has an entry <texlive location='filename'/>
if and only if it _is_ in tex live.  (modulo a day or so's delay, or
more if i'm actually in hospital.)

i can't say about resumemac (i'd not registered _any_ other plain resume
things, which doesn't necessarily mean there aren't any).

however, i would say that varisize is a reasonable choice for the user
who wants different sizes, but not font changes.  there are i think as
many questions about that situation as about the full blown fss that the
other packages provide.  fwiw, i list the thing in the faq.

As I said, that is a problem of a tlmgr which *was* in tlcritical.

You first have to make sure to get a *new* tlmgr from tlcritical, and
*then* this will not happen. 

I wrote already about the 3 variants to update tlmgr ...

The hyphenation pattern file is available but no one has translated
the captions to Sanskrit, therefore it has not been included in Babel.
You have to enable Sanskrit hyphenation yourself by the following
steps:

1. Make a copy of your language.dat in texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat
2. Put sanhyph.tex to a location where TeX can find it, eg to
directory texmf-local/tex/generic/hyphen/sanskrit
3. Make a "driver" file sanskrhyph.tex in the same directory as above.
The file must contain the following test whether we are in XeTeX, or
in 8-bit TeX:

\ifx\addlanguage\undefined
  \errmessage{This file can be used only in babelised formats!}
\fi
\expandafter\ifx\csname XeTeXrevision\endcsname\relax
\input zerohyph.tex
\else
\input sanhyph.tex
\fi

4. Put the following line to the end of your copy of language.dat:

sanskrit sanskrhyph.tex

5. Generate the required formats, eg by

fmtutil --byfmt xelatex

That's all.

Either you haven't added the hyphenation patterns to your xelatex format
or you are using the wrong command to select the language. 

check your log-file if the language is mentioned.

>>> http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/hyphenation/sanhyph/

The hyphenation patterns there aren't the newest version (and without a
suitable wrapper they would work only with xelatex but give problems in
other formats).

As far as I can see the newest version is inside the hyph-utf8 package.

OK, I got from tlcritical update-tlmgr-latest.sh and run it. Now

%tlmgr --version

returns tlmgr revision 11305 (2008-11-16 00:23:32 +0100)

this updated tlmgr (in contrast to 11274) does not remove files

So, this is the correct version?

Subject: [tex-live] epstopdf on cygwin
Message-ID: <4921890C.3020906@cornell.edu>

The program 'epstopdf' fails on cygwin for users who have gs in their 
path but not gswin32c.  My personal workaround is simply to comment out 
the line

    $GS = "gswin32c" if $^O =~ /cygwin/;

in epstopdf.pl.  But I think the "right thing" for the script to do 
would be to first check for gs in the path, and only try gswin32c if gs 
isn't found.  After all, cygwin's purpose is to provide a linux-like 
environment for windows users.  So it's reasonable to expect that cygwin 
users might have /usr/bin/gs in their path but not gswin32c.

Right! and Cygwin should not be confused with Windows... one should

    which is the most recent I think. 

Yes, it certainly is.  I didn't realize you were using tlcritical.

      TLPOBJ currently supports only plain or lzma containers at
    /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 519.

I added more information to the die so we can see what it thinks the
type is.  I'm guessing it is related to the tar --owner failure, which
will take a little time to fix.

Meanwhile, if you put a symlink from tar to gtar somewhere early in your
path, does it work?

      update: beamer (7340 -> 11236) ...
    Although the last line says that update is successful, nothing happens.

Until tar works, certainly nothing will actually be updated.

I don't understand offhand why there is any output about the "TLPOBJ
currently supports ..."; the program should exit right there.  Unless
there's some strange buffering of stderr going on.

Thanks,

Hi Ken,
what you are reporting is a well known problem.

The current maintainer of epstopdf is Gerben Wierda.  I asked him
again and again to fix this problem but it seems that all my mails had
been silently moved to /dev/null.  I asked several times but never got
a response.

Yes, removing the line

     $GS = "gswin32c" if $^O =~ /cygwin/;

makes a lot of sense.  It's simply wrong.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Here is the corresponding listing but

I noticed on a careful inspection of Install-TL.log
that there were a number of unseen errors :

 > untarring F:\TeX\Live\2008\temp\dingbat.tar failed, please retry

Might it be a good idea to post-process the log before
termination, reporting all lines that match the set of
known error-report patterns ?

What is the layout you want? Unpacking the .tds.zip and adding the

I don't understand what this means. Why is a .tds.zip not suitable for
CTAN?  (There are a lot tds.zip on CTAN).

We will investigate that. Before this triggered a die, after some
refactoring it didn't. We will check for a better behaviour.

Many thanks, Norbert : in that case, even when you identify
the underlying cause of the problem of TAR/read-only, it
might be worth leaving that second aspect unfixed until
a cure to the first is in place, since the read-only
problem reliably triggers the "concealed error" on
a second and subsequent install on top of an existing one.

That's easy: tar is right, winzip is wrong. The files are stored
read-only in the archive (that is likely a mistake though).

Aehmm, I am a bit lost about what you mean with the second aspect? I
guess the one that some files are unpacked read-only.

No idea why this happens, but we will try to fix it.

Do you have an example for a .tar.lzma where it happens?

Hi,

today I updated my TL2008 install source and noticed that you updated
the koma-script.tar.lzma package to version 3.0 but the doc and source package
still are older -- from 

      ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/

shouldn't koma-script.doc and koma-script.source be updated too 
to stay in sync ?

They should be removed, there is a bug that prevents these .tar.lzma
being removed. All (*ALL*) files are now in .tar.lzma (runfiles). Kohm
forced us to do so.

oops, then it's my fault!  my mirror script does not delete files by default...

I just checked ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/
and indeed  only the new koma-script package is still available, the
doc/source packages are not on ftp.fu-berlin.de anymore.

thanks for your help!!

I can give you my take.  One of the most common comments we get from
users is that it is hard for people to understand what the packages do.
We have responded by spending a lot of effort asking for documentation
(both README's and .pdf's), by doing a lot of work on the Catalogue
(much of it Robin's), and by trying to make the materials easy to
navigate on the web.  .tds.zip layouts are very hard to navigate.

But in part the question goes to what is the role of the archive: for
instance, to what extent do ordinary users go there and to what extent
are they just going to their distribution?

We have asked people who want to send a .tds.zip to send it as a
stand-alone file beyond what they already send.  See
  http://www.ctan.org/TDS-guidelines.html
(linked-to from the upload page).

This is not a good idea because the problem will be present again
after a future update from CTAN if it's not fixed in the master
sources.  Gerben gratefully took over maintenance after we noticed
that there had been different versions of epstopdf in the TL
repository already.  He made some adaptions for OS X a few years ago
and there had already been patches by other people, hence it's good
that he took over maintenance.

Karl already asked him, and I think this is the best thing one can do.

I don't know who added the cygwin line, Gerben is maintaining epstopdf
for a couple of months now and the stuff certainly had been introduced
earlier.  Maybe he is cautious because he didn't add the line himself.

So let's see whether Karl is more successful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

My question wasn't meant critical or something like this. I was really
wondering. As a miktex user I don't have to install many packages
manually but when the need arise I like the tds.zip: In windows they are
very easy to use -- even if you don't dare to unzip it directly in the
tree. Windows shows the zip in a normal explorer view, you see the
pathes of the files, you can copy the folders and move them to the
texmf. There is no need to compile dtx and ins files and to create a lot
of subfolders. I would always recommend to use the tds.zip for manual
installation.  

Btw: apart of the tds.zip there are also two install.txt and the manual
in the project files of KOMA.

In Germany we say that the role of archives is "Sammeln und Bewahren"
("collect and preserve"). The first task of an archive is to _have_
something and only then comes usability and presentation. I value the
work you do in the catalogue and navigation very much, but the most
important thing of CTAN for me is that the files are _there_ at least
for reference. I hate it if packages are only on some more or less
personal websites. There is always the danger that I lose the link or
that the website disappears.

The file roller in Linux and zipme in OS/2 do pretty the same. I agree
that .tds.zip are the best choice for installation unless the package
is very simple.

My website contains only links to my packages on CTAN so that those
who are interested in my work can find them. I am happy that my
packages can be on CTAN and TeX Live.

The same.

Tried cure

Go to
ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008/install-tl/tlpkg/TeXLive/ and
explicitly download the *.pm files and manually put them into
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/
Then visit
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
and manually put that into
/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

The same

Another medicine:
got update-tlmgr-latest.sh
and run it

The same

Both on darwin and x64_linux. Need to wait info from the horse' mouth

I tried Victor's recipies, and they did not help.

I also tried Pete's suggestion, and this is what happened (using the  
updated files per Victor's email) :

sudo perl -d `which tlmgr` update --all

Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.

I get the same problem on i386 linux, using the mirror at
ftp://ctan.cms.math.ca and $Revision=11079
but not using my local mirror updated last night.  Applying
update-tlmgr-r11156.sh just gets a message that the local revision is
greater than
the version on my mirror, but I still get the "uninitialized value"
using the CMS
mirror.

It is not the first time tlmgr goes rogue. The first prescription from
Karl Berry and the second from Norbert Preining and they used to work
before. Not this time (as I wrote). So I suggest to wait. Probably the
same prescriptions will work when the new tlmgr is released. Idea of
these prescriptions is to get a new version which is fixed without
using tlmgr itself.


Sure you can find some mirror which did not get the faulty version yet
and then use these receipts with this mirror but it is not worth
trouble.


(tlmgr revision 11305 (2008-11-16 00:23:32 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2008
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008)


goes rogue. The first recipe was from K.Berry and the second from N.

Hi all of you,

do you have the following at the TOP of your
	texlive.tlpdb
(to be found in ROOT/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb):

name 00texlive-installation.config
category TLCore
depend platform:x86_64-linux
depend location:/var/www/norbert/tlnet/2008
depend opt_paper:a4
depend opt_create_formats:0

depend opt_sys_man:/usr/local/man
depend opt_install_docfiles:1
depend opt_install_srcfiles:1
depend available_architectures:x86_64-linux


The LAST line here "depend available_architectures ..." is important!!!

More or less, appropriate to macos x: it starts

category TLCore

(I dont know why it mentions letter paper, as I certainly requested a4  
when I first set it up!
Even after I say
sudo tlmgr paper a4
it still says letter. But this is another issue...)

Howdy,

I've got

name 00texlive-installation.config
category TLCore
depend platform:universal-darwin
depend location:http://ctan.math.utah.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
depend opt_paper:letter
depend opt_create_formats:1
depend opt_create_symlinks:0
depend opt_sys_bin:/usr/local/bin
depend opt_sys_info:/usr/local/info
depend opt_sys_man:/usr/local/man
depend opt_install_docfiles:1
depend opt_install_srcfiles:1
depend available_architectures:universal-darwin

on my Mac. So the line seems to be there.

Good Luck,

I do have the "depend available_architectures:" line in the top of
texlive.tlpdb.  I don't
get the error using the local mirror, so it appears that the problem
is related to something
coming from the server.

I'm trying to update a package, and tlmgr gives me some unusual errors:

Use of uninitialized value in split at /usr/local/texlive/2008basic/ 
tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 864, <RETFH> line 210.

I looked at the texlive.tlpdb file on the CTAN mirror, and it seems to  
be listing only 3 or 4 packages. Was there a problem with the update  
last night?

I admit that I wrote that message in anger.

However, I do fear that Markus Kohm might throw another tantrum when he 
discovers that we dare to repackage his stuff. 

I do not insist on a particular layout; I want something like most of the 
packages have, which is easily referencable from the Catalogue: a README, 
documentation in PDF format.

 Have a nice day/evening/night

I confirm that there is a problem at least at the site I looked at.
Should be fixed tomorrow.

I do not subscribe to the texlive list but I do read it regularly.
The subject line refers to the recent error messages from tlmgr
when attempting to update:
     Use of uninitialized value in split at
     /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 961.

This also happens to me on WinXP.

There seems to be  a problem with downloading texlive.tlpdb.lzma
from CTAN.

If I obtain that file using an ftp program, its size is
   555713 bytes.

If I retrieve it using wget, wget reports its size
as
   2679 bytes
and only retrieves that many bytes.

If I obtain it via Firefox browser, its size is
   2679 bytes.

It must be the server is at fault. I have tried this with
wget version 1.11.4 (from GnuWin32 project) as well as version
1.10.2 (supplied with TeX Live 2008), with the same results.

The location I gave wget 
wasftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/

With Firefox I obtained the file from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/tlpkg/

I broke tlnet/2008/texlive.tlpdb yesterday.  As Norbert said, it will be
updated in tonight's run, about four hours from now.  Sorry.

Dan, I can't explain why your ftp program reported a different file
size, but I suspect you retrieved a different file.  The actual size of
the broken texlive.tlpdb.lzma is 2679 bytes.

    The first recipe was from K.Berry and the second from N.

I wrote my "copy all the .pm's by hand" a few days before we created the
"run update-tlmgr-latest.sh" option.  There's no reason to do all the
work by hand any more, ie, forget about the first recipe.  At least

when?  last night's mirror got an incomplete version whose size was as
you report below.  (and for that matter, where did you get it from?)

fwiw, tug.ctan.org (correctly, in some sense) has the same corrupt
version i mirrored from the master last night, at the time of writing.

um, i'm not sure you've proved that.  merely that what the server holds
has changed in the course of your experiment.

those are the same (underlying) directory, so it's not surprising that
the retrieved results look the same.

    Thanks, Karl : were you able to gain any
    insight(s) into how they came to be RO in
    the first place ?

At one point (long ago), I manually rebuilt those containers from a tree
that had the files as readonly.  I don't know how they got that way in
the first place and there's no way to trace it back farther at this
point.  We have added many checks to try to avoid it happening again.

if you prod me once it's been done (and i've not by then gone to bed)
i'll run the mirror and push the updates out to the other ctans.

it'll only make a few hours' difference, but the situation is a bit

texlive.infra as well as texlive.tlpdb, but I'm afraid I really can't
say for sure if everything's consistent right now.

Therefore I urge everyone on this list to simply refrain from updating
anything for the time being.

Hopefully tomorrow we'll be back in a reasonable state.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update cannot work on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <COL106-W221587C5EB1386BC68F606A40C0@phx.gbl>


Hi all,

I installed Ubuntu last week, and I installed texlive 08 from the net. Now I face some problem, my tlmgr cannot update. When I type this 
        tlmgr update -all
in my terminal, the terminal returns a output
        tlmgr: installation location ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/031/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
then it stops there, no output and no ending the job. I'm confused, why tlmgr cannot work on Linux but it works very well on Windows. Can someone help me?

I now get some new packages, but it seems something is still not right.

So I then executed
sudo update-tlmgr-latest.sh
but when I ran
sudo tlmgr update --all
I still got errors concerning uninitialized value in split:

tlmgr: installation location ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
Use of uninitialized value in split at /usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/ 
TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 970.
skipping forcibly removed package calligra (collection-fontsextra)

tlmgr: should not happen, please report: latexmk.universal-darwin  
mentioned, but neither new nor forcibly removed
skipping forcibly removed package resumemac (collection-plainextra)
skipping forcibly removed package varisize (collection-plainextra)

I do not know the reason for that, but I do know that
it doesn't compile unless you have GCC 2.96 (exactly).

I second this.

Now this is confusing: I first run update --all on x64-linux and when
I noticed a problem I did not update on darwin.


Still darwin (no update-tlmgr-latest.sh run) reports tlmgr --version

tlmgr revision 11305 (2008-11-16 00:23:32 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2008
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008
texlive-20080903

After getting update-tlmgr-latest.sh x64_linux reported 11150

I grabbed from tlcritical update-tlmgr-r11358.sh

running it returns
tlmgr --version                                              tlmgr
revision 11340 (2008-11-18 01:58:41 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2008
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2008
texlive-20080903

Should not it be 11358?

And even if real updates are run successfully it still reports an error

Use of uninitialized value in split at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm line 971.
update: dry run, no changes will be made
Use of uninitialized value in split at

Old post, I know - but I had a similar problem and found a solution. I 
found this message in my mail archive when searching for a solution.

You need to specify to babel that you are using greek.

IE - in my case, I added this to the preamble:

\usepackage[polutonikogreek,english]{babel}

Then where I had the greek text -

\selectlanguage{greek}

Things worked perfectly.
Also note I added the psgreek package (not part of TeXLive but on CTAN) 
to choose a nice greek font I liked.

Anyway, I'm guessing you have found a solution you like, but since I did 
not see the babel solution on the list, I thought I'd reply so it's there.

0339 was too early (i assume you're using tex.ac.uk aka cam.ctan.org).

i got most packages in a run starting 0000, but my 0300 run failed and i
didn't get a complete set until 0600 (all times nominal).

you're presumably using tug.ctan.org, or some mirror of it.  there's
some issue about that slurping my mirror, and when i looked this morning
(about 0800 utc) it still hadn't collected anything since yesterday's
update (which had the corrupt tlpdb).

i've initiated discussion of this, but things seem now (finally) to have
changed for today -- tug.ctan has the proper works.  of course, that
won't have affected many of its mirrors yet :-(

with a bit of work, we should be able to get both dante and tug rather
nearer to the time the stuff arrives in cambridge.  (which itself needs
sorting.)

i'll announce to this list when we have a clearer idea of what times
texlive updates are actually to be expected.

sorry to be on people's critical paths.  we'll try and see it doesn't
happen again...

Lars, that may be more easily said than done.
Even as a TeX-Live list subscriber, I do not
know where the list archives are, nor how to
access them.  It may well be that Gao Feng Nan
is in the same position.  If you do know where
they are, and how to access them, he may

I wonder whether it might be beneficial to always
announce the version number of the fixed file in
circumstances such as this, to assist others in
identifying whether they yet have (access to) the
updated version ?

It is not a problem of tlmgr itself, nothing changed in tlmgr. The
texlive.tlpdb was broken, that is all.

It was 03.39 in Victor's time, but 08.39 UK time.

Anyway, I'll stand by for another fix.

Subject: [tex-live] Using truetype fonts with pdftex
Message-ID: <74f506dc0811200947j1115d065wbeeffa795c382455@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

the question how to use truetype fonts with pdftex keeps
popping up from time to time, so I wrote some (draft) notes
which would be added to the official pdftex manual.
Comments/suggestions welcome.

Regards,
Thanh

======================================================
\subsection{A closer look at TrueType fonts and pdftex}
The most common outline format for tex is t1. ttf fonts are slightly
different from t1 and hence requires some extra work to get it right.
An important issue when dealing with ttf is to understand the way how t1
and ttf handle encoding and glyph names (or more precisely, glyph
``identity'').

t1 is familiar with tex users, so let's start with it first: t1 refers to
glyphs by names, ie each glyph is identified by its name like
`/A', `/comma', etc. Given a glyph name, it's easy to tell if a t1 font
contains that glyph or not. Encoding with t1 is therefore simple: given a
number (between 0..255), an encoding tells us the name to get the relevant
glyph.

With ttf the situation is not that simple, since ttf doesn't use name to
refer to glyphs, but ``indices''. This means that each glyph
is identified by its index, not its name. The indices are numbers that
differ from font to font. ttf handle encodings by a mechanism called
``cmap'', which are roughly tables containing mapping from character code
to glyph index. A ttf font can contain one or more such tables (each
corresponds to an encoding).

Since glyph names are not strictly necessary for ttf, they are not always
available inside a ttf font. Given a ttf font, one of the following case
may happen:

\startitemize[a,packed]
\item the font contains correct names for all its glyphs. This is the ideal
    situation and is often the case for high-quality latin fonts.

\item the font contains wrong name for all or most of its glyphs. This is
    the worst situation that often happens with poor-quality fonts, or
    fonts converted from other formats.

\item the font contains no glyph names at all. Newer version of Palatino
    fonts by Linotype (v1.40, coming with Windows XP) is one example.

\item the font contains correct names for most glyphs, and no names or
    wrong names for a few glyphs. This happens from time to time.
\stopitemize

One may wonder how things can be so complex with glyph names in ttf. The
reason is that t1 fonts rely on correct names to work properly. If a glyph
has wrong name, it get noticed immediately. ttf as mentioned before don't
use names for its encoding. So, if glyph names in a ttf font are wrong or
missing, it's usually not a big deal and often goes unnoticed.

The potential problem with using ttf in pdftex is that we are so used to
the t1 encoding convention which relies on correct glyph names. Most font
tools also rely on this convention; all encoding file (.enc files) use
glyph names, too. But as discussed above, glyph names in ttf is not
something very reliable. If we encounter a font that doesn't have correct
names for all glyphs, we need to do some more work.

If glyph names are not correct, we need a better way to refer to a glyph in
ttf fonts than using its name. The most reliable way seems to be via
Unicode: most ttf fonts provide correct mapping from unicode to glyph
index. This is something we can count on, since it is required for a ttf to
be usable.

>From version 1.21a pdftex supports the naming convention `uniXXXX' in
encoding files. This only makes sense with ttf fonts, of course. When
pdftex sees for example `uni12AB', it will:

\startitemize[a,packed]
\item read the table <unicode> -> <glyph-index> from the font;
\item loop up the value '12AB' in the table; if found then pick the
    relevant glyph index.
\stopitemize

ttf2afm also does the same lookup when it sees names like `uni12AB'.

Now let's review the minimal steps to get a ttf font working with pdftex:
\startitemize[a,packed]
\item generate an afm from ttf using ttf2afm. Example:
    \starttyping
    ttf2afm -e 8r.enc -o times.afm times.ttf
    \stoptyping
\item convert afm to tfm using whatever tool suitable: afm2tfm, fontinst,
    afm2pl, etc. Example:
    \starttyping
    afm2tfm times.afm -T 8r.enc
    \stoptyping
\item create the needed map entry for the font. Example:
    \starttyping
    \pdfmapfile{+times TimesNewRomanPSMT <8r.enc <times.ttf}
    \stoptyping
\stopitemize

That was the easiest case when glyph names are correct. Now let's have a
font where we cannot rely on glyph names, for example Palatino by Linotype,
version 1.40. Let's assume we want to use T1 encoding with this font. So we
put pala.ttf and ec.enc in the current directory before processing further.

The first attempt would be:
\starttyping
ttf2afm -e ec.enc -o pala.afm pala.ttf
\stoptyping

However, since the names in ec.enc are not available in pala.ttf (in fact
there are no names inside the font), we would get a bunch of warnings:
\starttyping
Warning: ttf2afm (file pala.ttf): no names available in `post' table, print
glyph names as indices

Warning: ttf2afm (file pala.ttf): glyph `grave' not found
.
.
.
\stoptyping

and the output pala.afm will contain no names at all. Instead of glyph
names in ec.enc, we get weird things like `index123'. And all glyphs are
not encoded:
\starttyping
C -1 ; WX 832 ; N index10 ; B 24 -3 807 689 ;
.
.
.
\stoptyping

We try again, this time without giving encoding:
\starttyping
ttf2afm -o pala.afm pala.ttf
\stoptyping

This time since we didn't ask ttf2afm to re-encode the output afm, we get
less warning:
\starttyping
Warning: ttf2afm (file pala.ttf): no names available in `post' table, print
glyph names as indices
\stoptyping

and the afm output is the same as in the previous attempt. Which is not
very useful, since there is little we can do with those names like
`index123'.

So we try to go with Unicode:

\starttyping
ttf2afm -u -o pala.afm pala.ttf
\stoptyping

This time we get another bunch of warnings like:
\starttyping
Warning: ttf2afm (file pala.ttf): glyph 108 have multiple encodings (the
first one being used): uni0162 uni021A
.
.
\stoptyping

It is hard to understand what tfm2afm tells us by this message at the first
sight. So let's recap the connection between glyph name, glyph index and
unicode:
\startitemize[a,packed]
\item glyphs are identified internally by index.
\item <glyph-name> -> <glyph-index> is optional, and not always reliable.
    So is <glyph-index> -> <glyph-name>.
\item <unicode> -> <glyph-index> is (almost) always present and reliable.
\item <glyph-index> -> <unicode> is not always reliable, and it's not even
    a mapping, since there can be more unicodes that map to a glyph index.
    Therefore, given glyph index, it's not always possible to get an
    unicode corresponding to that index: there can be none, or more than
    one. If there is none, glyph index will be used (eg `index123'). If
    there are more, like in this case we have two unicodes 0162 021A that
    are mapped to glyph index 108. And we have asked ttf2afm to print glyph
    by unicode, so ttf2afm cannot know which value to print in this case.
    Hence it simply sticks with the first unicode and writes a warning.
\stopitemize

Now if all we want is to use pala.ttf with T1 encoding (and don't care
about ligatures), probably the easiest way is to create a new enc file
ec-uni.enc from ec.enc, where all glyph names are replaced by unicode. This
can be done easily for example by a Perl script that read the AGL (Adobe
Glyph List, available at
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyphlist.txt and then
convert all glyph names to unicode). Assume that we already have
ec-uni.enc, the needed steps to create the tfm can look as:
\starttyping
ttf2afm -u -e ec-uni.enc -o pala-t1.afm pala.ttf
afm2pl pala-t1.afm
pltotf pala-t1.pl
\stoptyping

and to use the font:
\starttyping
\pdfmapline{+pala-t1 <ec-uni.enc <pala.ttf}
\font\f=pala-t1\f
This is a test of font Palatino Regular in T1 encoding.
\stoptyping

If we want to do more than just using pala.ttf with T1 encoding, for
example to process the afm output with fontinst for more a complex font
setup, then we must process slightly different. Having an afm file where
all glyph names are converted to `uniXXXX' form is not very useful for
fontinst. Instead, we need an afm file with AGL names to use with fontinst.
We do so by:

\startitemize[a,packed]
\item generate an afm  with glyph names in form `uniXXXX'
    \starttyping
    ttf2afm -u -o pala.afm pala.ttf
    \stoptyping
\item convert pala.afm to pala-agl.afm, so that pala-agl.afm contains AGL
    names only. Again, a simple Perl script can do that.
\item process pala-agl.afm by fontinst as needed.
\item in the final stage, when we already have the tfm's from fontinst and
    friends, plus the map entries (generated by fontinst, or created
    manually), we need to replace the encoding by their counterpart with
    `uniXXXX' names. For example, if fontinst tell us to add a line saying
    \starttyping
    pala-agl-8r <8r.enc <pala.ttf
    \stoptyping
    to our map file, then we need to change that line to
    \starttyping
    pala-agl-8r <8r-uni.enc <pala.ttf
    \stoptyping
    where 8r-uni.enc is derived from 8r.enc by converting all glyph names
    to the `uniXXXX' form.

Good to know that native tar is also considered for UNIX OSs. I did got 
around that by just using the GNU version of tar.

thank you much for all the good work ...

something off at some ppint way back).

Nothing in the headers either.

    where? I don't see that in my Thunderbird (though I might have switched 
    something off at some ppint way back).

I silenced mailman's default (and verbose and nearly useless) footer for
the tex-live list a long time ago, and don't plan to add it back.

For the record, you can get to the web page for any tug list via
lists.tug.org, e.g., http://lists.tug.org/tex-live.  That's the shortest
possible url.  (And yes, it redirects to the mailman page, and no, that
isn't going to change, and no, I can't keep the url from changing.)
    
I fail to see that doing a web search for "tex-live archives" or
whatever is so hard that we need to be having this lengthy discussion.
The url is all over the web pages, too.  I sincerely doubt that having
it in the message footer would reach anyone who couldn't find it already.

    Nothing in the headers either.

I don't expect people to look in the headers, but the standard mailman
headers are there, including:

List-Archive: <http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live>

As well as:

List-Unsubscribe: <http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-live>,
	<mailto:tex-live-request at tug.org?subject=unsubscribe>
List-Post: <mailto:tex-live at tug.org>

At the bottom of every message sent from the list, I see this:
 	[ Note: This message contains email list management information] 
This is actually a link. I move down so that it is the active link and
press return/enter, I get a screen of information about the lists with
links to various pages, including the archives.

I can't say where it would be in Thunderbird or what it would look
like, of course. But it is definitely present in all messages I get
from the list.

This only appears for messages sent via the list, of course. If
somebody replies to this message using my email address, it won't
appear. If somebody replies using both my email address and the list
address, I'll get one copy with the list management information and one
without. (So I think it is stripped when you reply to a message.)

> Nothing in the headers either.

I don't think it is in the headers. It is more like another part of the
email. Sorry, I don't know the right term.

Hi Clea,
messages I get from texhax at tug.org have signatures like:

| _______________________________________________
| TeX FAQ: http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq
| Mailing list archives: http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/
| More links: http://tug.org/begin.html

This is not the case for messages I get from tex-live at tug.org.

Subject: [tex-live] xdvi and X11R7.4 (cygwin)
Message-ID: <4925FB3F.9080909@cornell.edu>

Angelo Graziosi has reported [1] a successful build of texlive for 
cygwin after some patches to the texlive source.  Cygwin has just 
undergone a massive X11 upgrade, from X11R6.99 to X11R7.4, and there are 
now some problems (which may or may not all be cygwin-specific).  Two 
are easy to solve, but I'm stumped on the third:

1. Angelo's xdvi-xaw stopped working after the upgrade.  This is because 
it depended on xaw8, which is now considered obsolete.  The fix is to 
install cygwin's libXaw8 package.  But this doesn't help with new 
builds, leading me to the next two items.

2. An attempt to rebuild texlive under X11R7.4, using the same patches 
that Angelo had used, failed while compiling xetex because of changes in 
libfontconfig1.  The fix (discovered by Angelo) is to replace the 
earlier patch of xetex.mk (see [2]) by the following:

--- texlive-20080816-source.orig/texk/web2c/xetexdir/xetex.mk

 ZLIBCPPFLAGS = @ZLIBCPPFLAGS@
 LDZLIB = @LDZLIB@

This allows the build to complete.  Unfortunately,...

3. xdvi now segfaults, after printing many error messages that say (with 
minor variations)

    No type converter registered for '' to '

This happens whether I compile xdvi using xaw or motif, provided I run 
xdvi with no arguments or with a specified dvi file.  On the other hand, 
xdvi --version and xdvi --help both work fine.  I have no idea how to 
debug this.  I also don't know whether it is cygwin specific.  Have 
people successfully built xdvi on other systems running X11R7.4?

I would appreciate any suggestions on how to track down the problem.  It 
is of course not urgent for practical purposes, since I can continue to 
use Angelo's binaries as mentioned above.  But that isn't a good 
solution for the long term.

It would have reached me, and then we wouldn't be having

that's odd I don;t see them here. Any anyways, I already knew where to

    Should not it be 11358?

No.  The rev number in the filename is the revision of the overall tree
(`svnversion`) at the time the .sh (or .exe) archive was created.

The rev number in the --version output is the rev number of the last
actual modification to tlmgr.

    Does anybody know why OPATGEN is not in TeXLive? It is free.

No configure support, last I knew.  Compiling only with gcc 2.96
is also certainly a nonstarter.

If you or anyone else wants to do the necessary work so it can be
integrated into the standard build, great.

      tlmgr: installation location ftp://ftp.kddlabs.co.jp/031/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008
    then it stops there, 

It doesn't have to do with (GNU/)Linux vs. Windows, it has to do with
the particular mirror being chosen and/or your system not being able to
do the ftp.

I suggest explicitly selecting a different mirror.

Thanks for clarifying this. I found that (some) MacOSX clients corrupt
plain text download (probably something connected with linebreaks, so
appearance does not change) and checksum fails. So I use plain
terminal sftp to retrieve them; but first my reaction was that someone
plays games.

Yes, update came the usual way because the problem was not with tlmgr
itself (as Karl and Norbert explained). When I was downloading update
script it was not clear. Victor

Besides not compiling with recent compilers, it's buggy too.  I've
reportes a serious issue to the author, but he told me that he has
neither real interest nor time to fix it.  In other words, we would
need a new maintainer.

Attached is the binary I have, and which runs with my openSuSE 10.2
box.

Hmm, this looks somewhat garbled ... does this error also occur if you
run it with -expertmode 0 ?

If you have a debugger, you could start xdvi in it, set a breakpoint
to 'x_error_handler' and then run xdvi with '-sync', that should give you
a backtrace of where it fails.

I just did a fresh installation (rather fast this time ;-)

I asked the installation to install in the current directory (.), which 
it did. This also installed texmf-local in the current directory

but texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf sets the default to

$SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local

which is a bit counter intuitive when the installer clearly stated that 
TEXMFLOCAL would be

./texmf-local

I fixed mine using ./texmf.cnf, just wanted to know if this behavior was 
expected?

Yes, it does.  The precise form of the error message varies, and there 
are also minor variations depending on which X toolkit I use.  I 
mentioned in my earlier message that I had tried both xaw and motif.  In 
the meantime, I've also tried xaw3d with the same results (again with 
minor variations in the precise error message).

I've never used a debugger before, but I took a quick look at the gdb 
documentation and gave it a try.  A transcript of the session is 
attached.  Does it tell you anything?  I'm also attaching the stackdump, 
but I suspect it's useless.

Subject: [tex-live] inputenc incosistencies with UTF-8
Message-ID: <87ej14j3al.fsf@patagonia.sebmags.homelinux.org>

Hi,

I found that some characters don't fare well with bibtex, as I just
found out. One of my entries has the letter ? (hopelly this won't get
mangled here); the norwegian capital "o" with a slash through the middle
of it. Bibtexing a *.tex source with this citation fails with the error:
  
ERROR: Package inputenc Error: Unicode char \u8:\303 not set up for use with LaTeX. 
  
I have "\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}" in my preamble, as I've always had
without problems. Other similar characters don't produce the error; in
fact, the lowercase version of the character above goes through
fine. The LaTeX documents compile fine if the ? is included directly,
and neither are any problems encountered if the character is placed
directly in the *.bbl file. I'm using the texlive packages from Debian
sid. Any advice appreciated.


Cheers,

Hi,
You could try using bibtex8. It is better when it comes to handling  
unicode.
Also, you might want to move this question to another mailing list  
(e.g texhax) as this list is more focused on issues directly relevant  
to the texlive distribution, not tex in general. You might get better  
help there.

Good luck,

Alex

This doesn't look good - a stack corruption somewhere in the X
library.  The stack is probably already corrupted in those weird
looking type converter warnings. Since it used to work with X11R6.99,
I'd say it's a problem with that X version and/or cygwin ... I must
admit that I'm still running an ancient version of X.org (on ancient
hardware ;-) and I'm afraid of upgrading, so I haven't tested it
with X11R7.4 yet. Maybe you could forward this to the cygwin
developers, they might be in a better position to debug this.

Best regards,
Stefan

Subject: [tex-live] strange problem with `xdvi' and `0' key
Message-ID: <20081121.163010.159366603.wl@gnu.org>


[xdvik version 22.84.14 (Xaw toolkit)
 Libraries: kpathsea version 3.5.7, T1lib version 5.0.1;
 this is TeXLive rev. 11284, running on a GNU/Linux box]

I currently encounter a very strange problem.  Having a DVI like
codepage.dvi (from TeXLive), which has more than 10 pages, I type

  5 g

to navigate to the page?5.  However

  10 g

brings me to page?1 instead page?10.  In fact, the `0' key is
apparently ignored within a page number for the `g' command.  Only

  0 g

works; it brings me to the last page of the document (which is a good
idea but not documented in the man page[1]).

Any ideas?  It smells like a bug...


    Werner


[1] In analogy, -3 could go to the third last page of the document,
    but this doesn't work...

Hi, I inserted the new DVD and tried to install TexLive, and got the
following error messages.

My machine is a DELL desktop running Windows XP Professional 2002,
service pack 2.

I do have TexLive2007 installed already---don't know if this is causing
the problem.

Was able to install successfully on my laptop [also a windows machine,
but did not have TexLive 2007 on it.]

Thanks for any help

Isn't that the right one? You have installed to 
	./2008/....
thus the binaries are in
	./2008/bin/arch/...
thus SELFAUTOPARENT spits out
	./2008/
and $SELAUTOPARENT/../
	./
and this you arrive at 
	./texmf-local

Did you actually try it out?

> ./texmf-local

Do oyu have
	TEXMFLOCAL=./texmf-local
??? This is a *very* bad setting, because when you compile a document in
	~/tex/foobar/
then TEXMFLOCAL=~/tex/foobar/texmf-local, etc etc etc

I've seen this before, so there may be a fix out there somewhere.
Xdvi from Ubuntu's texlive 2007 does not have the bug.

"10 g" Works:
gwhite at cerberus:~$ /usr/bin/xdvi --version
xdvik version 22.84.10 (Xaw toolkit)
Libraries: kpathsea version 3.5.6, T1lib version 5.0.1

"10 g" Fails:
gwhite at cerberus:~$ /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux/xdvi --version
xdvik version 22.84.14 (Xaw toolkit)
Libraries: kpathsea version 3.5.7, T1lib version 5.0.1

A quick scan of the CHANGES file wasn't helpful.  events.c has some debugging
code commented out in check_goto_page and check_goto_tex_page that might
be helpful.

Others have reported problems when TL2007 is already installed.
There are several environment variables set or adjusted by TL2007.
You may find a list in the archives, but it should not be hard to determine
which ones need to be changed -- certainly PATH and PERL5LIB.
I have a Win2k system with MikTeX, TL2007, and TL2008 all installed,
and can switch amoung them by adjusting the environment.  MiKTeX
also sets things in the registry, but nothing that affects TeX Live.

I checked the patches in Debian and we don't have anything related to
that, so assuming that Ubuntu didn't add anything to the Debian packages
it seems to be a bug introduced in a later version. (I checkd myself and
10g also works here on Debian).

Aehmmmmmm.... that is bad. If your Windows does not have a cmd.exe then
we cannot do anything.

I cannot help here, what is failing for you is a simple line
	my $cwd = `cd`;
which calls a cmd.exe and in that cd. If that does not work, I don't
know what is hosed.

No i instructed the installer to install in the same directory as I was 
installing from, basically telling it that the installation dir is .

I'll see if I can redo it and get the same results tommorow (might very 
well be me that did something stupid).

Tough on my system I'd actually like texmf-local to be in 2008/, we use 
our own texmf tree for local stuff that.

Hi Lars,

    No i instructed the installer to install in the same directory as I was 
    installing from, basically telling it that the installation dir is .

In case of continuing problems, I suggest specifying the absolute path
to . rather than ".".  I at least have never tested specifying relative
paths to the installer.

    Tough on my system I'd actually like texmf-local to be in 2008/, we use 
    our own texmf tree for local stuff that.

You can explicitly set the texmf-local location in the <d>irectory menu,
but then you likely already knew that.

Best,
Karl

Could this be caused by a PERL5LIB setting?   I think TL2007 and some 3rd
party perl apps set PERL5LIB.

I've been asking for help on the cygwin-xfree list also, with no luck yet:

	http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2008-11/msg00116.html
	http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2008-11/msg00214.html

I haven't yet sent them the gdb transcript.  I have a feeling that 
there's actually a very simple fix, but I don't know where to look.

Is it possible that this problem is related to the libXp library?  When 
texlive is built under X11R6.99, libXp gets pulled in.  Here's a line 
from build.log under X11R6.99:

	checking for XpQueryVersion in -lXp... yes

whereas the answer is "no" when I build texlive under X11R7.4.  (libXp 
provides the obsolete Xprint extension, which no longer exists in the 
newer X11.)  The effect of this is that the compilation of xdvi passes 
-lXp to gcc under the old X11 but not under the new one.  Does xdvi 
require libXp?  If so, I would have expected the configuration to quit 
with an error after not finding it.

Hi all,

Is there any file I can put my font folder record (other that C:\Windows\Fonts) in for fc-cache? I know in texlive\2008\texmf-var\fonts\conf there is a fonts.conf, but my change to this file is often discarded by the update of texlive. Can I have a local file that will not be replaced every time I update my texlive? 

Thanks.

I'd be looking closely at your X11R7.4.  Are other applications having
problems with Cygwin X11R7.4?

Ubuntu 8.10 uses X11R7.4.  I just did a TL build from svn sources, firstly
to see if it would work, but also to look into the xdvi bug reported in
another thread (the "g" command doesn't accept '0' as a valid digit, so
"11 g" works, but "10 g" goes to page 1.).

Configure for xdvik gave:

checking for XpQueryVersion in -lXp... no

So far, my locally compiled Xdvi appears to be bug compatible with the
version in the TL2008 build.

Yes, that's why I proposed texmf-local and not texmf-var ...

Not that I know of.  But it's just been released very recently, so I 
don't know how many people have tried to rebuild their old programs.

Thanks, that's good to know.  So it might well be a cygwin-specific problem.

I know there is texlive\2008\texmf-var\fonts\conf\fonts.conf, but when I 
update my texlive, this file is often reset so I have to edit the file again 
and fc-cache again. So I guess if you guys can have some file that records 
extra fonts dirs for fc-cache and *it will not be replaced when I do my 
updating*, it would be more convenient for some one like me.

Thanks

If you disable "expert" mode, xdvi shows the numeric prefix in the message
bar, but the current buggy version is ignoring zero, so "11 g", etc. works.

 in events.c:

static XtActionsRec m_actions[] = {
    {"digit", Act_digit},

but it seems that Act_digit is not called for keyboard zero.  It is,
however, called
for the zero on my number pad, so the workaround is to use the number pad for
page numbers that have a zero!

That's an artefact of '0' not working, the 0 is ignored and 'g' just
goes to the last page ;-)

Yes, it's a bug in 22.84.14, fixed in the CVS. A workaround is
described here:

Yes, it might help - my hope was that they might have seen a similar
problem before.

As for the libtool/autoconf being old, as mentioned in this reply:

http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2008-11/msg00119.html

- the current version uses the same libtool setup as the rest of
TeXLive, changing it would be quite hard, but of course it could
be related to this problem.

Not linking it in shouldn't be a problem, it's only neede by Motif 2.2,
hence the configure check.

Would it be hard to change it if I just wanted to build xdvik?  I tried 
downloading the source for xdvik and building it.  It builds OOTB, but 
the resulting xdvi-xaw segfaults as before.  I then tried autoreconf 
--force, but this yielded syntax errors when I subsequently ran 'make'. 
  So clearly a naive approach to changing the libtool setup won't work. 
  If you think this is worth pursuing in order to narrow down the 
problem, and if you can give me instructions on how to "re-libtool" the 
xdvik source, I'll try it.  Otherwise I'm ready to give up.

I just donwloaded install-tl-unx.tar.gz

unpacked it and ran

./install-tl/install-tl

in it I chose the smallest latex installation (we are doing a test so 
that is fine)

under TEXDIR I specified '.'

Then it clearly states that

<1> TEXDIR:       .
      support tree: ./texmf

  <2> TEXMFLOCAL:     ./texmf-local
  <3> TEXMFSYSVAR:    ./texmf-var
  <4> TEXMFSYSCONFIG: ./texmf-config

  <5> TEXMFHOME:      ~/texmf

and I ran the installation.

This installs everything inside install-tl

drwxr-xr-x  5 daleif daleif   4096 Nov 22 21:05 tlpkg

but here is the kicker, it didn't write the 'alternative' TEXMFLOCAL in 
the texmf.cnf that is at the installation root, it is all comments.

Specifying a full path then the root texmf.cnf do get a new line with 
TEXMFLOCAL, but not when one specified TEXDIR as '.'

Since '.' will give you a valid path and it actually installs, it might 
be a good idea to note this somewhere

Another interesting test: I made a subdir 'test' of the created 
'install-tl' directory (from untarring the installer), if TEXDIR is 
specified as this subdirectory (aka a relative path), the installer 
cannot run at all.

tar: test/temp/ams.tar: Cannot open: No such file or directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

it might be an idea to mention in the istaller that it is strongly 
recommended to specify full paths, not relative ones.

I don't think it is necessary to do more than that.

newlfm contains both manual.pdf and newlfm.pdf in the doc directory. It
is hard to tell but I suspect the only difference between the two is
the date of typesetting. This is confusing, though, because it made me

opens newlfm.pdf (with a 2004 date). CTAN links to manual.pdf (with a

i find i noted the issue when the current version was uploaded, but i
never returned to it :-(

i have ("wantonly") removed the old newlfm.pdf and renamed manual.pdf to
newlfm.pdf (manual.pdf is a useless name in a distribution).

will inform the author in a bit.

i would suggest that newlfm in tex live should synchronise with what
i've done.

a workaround (not tested):

(1) Copy the file $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/texmf.cnf into $TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/texmf.cnf,
    and change two lines in $TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/texmf.cnf

    FONTCONFIG_PATH=$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf
    FC_CACHEDIR=$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/cache

    into

    FONTCONFIG_PATH=$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf
    FC_CACHEDIR=$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/cache

    Probably $TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/texmf.cnf will be read preferentially.

(2) Make directories
    $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf
    $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/cache

(3) Copy the file $TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf/fonts.conf
    into $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf/fonts.conf
    and edit the file $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf/fonts.conf

Contents in $TEXMFLOCAL may not be overridden by updates.
Physical locations of $TEXMFSYSVAR etc. are shown by
kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFSYSVAR etc.

It looks like that is wrong, since TEXMFLOCAL is not
$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local but $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-local.
If you copy your personal texmf.cnf into bin/win32, your texmf.cnf
will surely be read first.

That would be strange.  Neither the installer nor TeX Live 2008 itself
should ever interfere with any instance of Perl or Ghostscript
existing on your system already.

On Unix it's expected that these programs are installed already, on
Windows the installer temporarily sets PERL5LIB itself in order to use
the tiny Perl for Windows which is part of the installer and needed for
bootstrapping.

With other words:  The installer runs in its own environment and
overwrites PERL5LIB unconditionally.

And, coming back to P.C. Venkatesh's question: It's quite unlikely
that TeX Live 2007 is the culprit.  You don't have to delete TL-2007
in order to install TL-2008, but the environment variable TEXMFCNF set
by TL-2007 interferes with TL-2008 at run time, but not during
installation.  It has to be removed at least after TL-2008 had been
installed. 

Removing TEXMFCNF from the environment breaks TL-2007, but there is a
simple solution: Move texlive2007/texmf-var/web2c/texmf.cnf to
texlive2007/bin/win32/ and TEXMFCNF is not needed anymore. You have to
run texhash or mktexlsr after this change.

Then you can switch easily between TL-2007 and TL-2008.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Here's one more data point in case it tells you anything:  I built 
plain-old xdvi (as opposed to xdvik), and it runs without a problem.  
Since xdvik is based on xdvi-22.84, I tested both it and xdvi-22.85, and 
they both work fine.  So whatever the problem is, the extra 
complications in xdvik are required in order to trigger it.

Best regards,

Ken

Compiling my latest tex-File after my recent update of TeXLive, I had a
delightful surprise: KOMA-Script v3.01 is there!

I do not know who is/are the good guy(s) who managed this (I didn't
noticed anything particular in this thread) so I simply say: Thank You!

I've downloaded the iso - but this is freezed as of august 2008.

Is ist possible to copy an up-to-date installation of TeXLive to another
PC? Is changing the PATH-Variable enough for runnig?

Thanks,

Andreas

if it is linux there is no problem at all (just make a copy, on Linux 
TeXLive does not integrate it self into the system).

For MAC I would assume you could do the same.

On windows we need a little more. I would assume that you can copy a 
LaTeX dist from one windows to another, but you also need the system 
integration, aka adding the PATH to the system, adding stuff to Start -> 
programmes.

I'd really like to have such a tool as well. A student organisation at 
the uni where I work had a LaTeX insall party and installed TeXLive on 
all systems (Linux, MAC and Windows) and it takes FOREVER. (they has 
burned the ISO and was running the installation from DVD).

Later we found out that it was bit faster to copy the contents of the 
iso to disk and install from there.

But why not simply start by having a fully updated TeXLive on a linux 
system including the windows binaries. Copy this (compressed?) to a USB 
stick. Copy it onto a windows in say C:/program files/texlive/2008/ and 
then run some extra windows script that takes care of the system 
integration.

I would think that this is not that had, we just have to dissect the 
Windows installer. But I'm no windows programmer.

Such a tool would make install parties a lot easier, and would help in 
other batch installing situations.

How about installing the frozen copy from DVD and then copying the new
files over the old version? I hope that it could preserve all
settings.

Hi Andreas,
yes, this is sufficient.  On Windows you might want to install the
shortcuts in the start menu too.  There is a script written by Siep
which will perform the final steps on Windows.  It's described in the
TeX Live Guide, section 4.

If TeX Live 2007 exists on the system already, either it should be
uninstalled or, at least, the TEXMFCNF environment variable has to be
removed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I did an install to one system with binaries for all the various platforms I
use, including Windows, then copied the tree around to the systems that
don't have reliable NFS access (laptops, Win XP).   Setting the PATH is
all that is really necessary to use TL2008 in Win XP.    There is a bit more
work if you want to restrict the list of binaries in the copies (but if you
only have linux and windows) it might be best to create separate
installs.

Another option is to do a minimal install from the release version
and then provide a DVD with a snapshot of the current files for a local
update "location".

For Mac there were some issues with Tk support for the
GUI -- I think MacTeX includes a fix, so you might want to just use
the .dmg files for MacTeX and an update mirror DVD.

The easiest way is to wget CTAN:/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008/archive/*
and install-tl/ , record that on usb pendrive or dvd and install from 
that.

OK, that's an important find. Maybe you could switch to non-k xdvi for

Message-ID: <200811232317.mANNH9M08972@f7.net>

    under TEXDIR I specified '.'
    ...
    <2> TEXMFLOCAL:     ./texmf-local
    ...
    but here is the kicker, it didn't write the 'alternative' TEXMFLOCAL in 
    the texmf.cnf that is at the installation root, it is all comments.

Ok, that is a bug.

    Another interesting test: I made a subdir 'test' of the created 
    'install-tl' directory (from untarring the installer), if TEXDIR is 
    specified as this subdirectory (aka a relative path), the installer 
    cannot run at all.

And another.

    it might be an idea to mention in the istaller that it is strongly 
    recommended to specify full paths, not relative ones.

It occurs to me that if we go to the trouble of detecting a relative
path, we could just as easily replace it with the absolute path as issue
a warning about it.  

However, I guess you specifically wanted to end up with relative paths
in the configuration (something that never occurred to me and am amazed
that it functions at all), so we shouldn't do that, and issuing the
warning is better.

Thanks,
karl

hmm, not really. In my situation it would have been fine if the 
installer had replaced it with absolute paths.

Though someone might need absolute paths.

it is just easier to write . or perhaps even better .. than to write

/long/path/through/system

aiui, pdftricks is no longer an obvious candidate for the work.

since the authors don't want to keep it up-to-date on ctan, should we
drop it?

Hi Staszek,
unfortunately this is not as easy as it looks.  The installer will
only work if the directory structure is exactly the same as on the DVD
image.  This is not the case on CTAN.  The install-tl/ directory
contains the installer, some documentation, and a tlpkg/ directory.
But there is no texlive.tlpdb in install-tl/tlpkg/, hence some work is
still necessary. 

I think that copying an installed system and ask people to run Siep's
script is the easiest way in this case.

Regards,
  Reinhard

which lists pdftricks well down its list, and starts its description

  Another more elegant way, but much more difficult is to use the
  pdftricks package.

though i admit it does list a ctan location for the package...  (after
sarovar.org)

the page actually recommends pst-pdf:

  The best solution is to use the package pst-pdf which itself needs the
  newest preview package, available from CTAN.

since i've never used pstricks "in anger", i really have no actual
opinion about the issue.

Btw this is quite unfortunate. Can't we make it easier to download
packages from ctan's tlnet and install from there?

This script was intended as a proof-of-concept script to give users
on a LAN access to a pre-installed system to which they didn't have
write access.

It would probably work, but please review the code first: do you
want a file association tying psview to .[e]ps, are you going to use
xetex, what manuals deserve menu shortcuts? And, most importantly,
add a shortcut to tlmgr and make sure it works.

Also, how important is it really that the system is up to date? You
could just give them the DVD as-is, and most people would be happy
with it.

I thought about that. The only thing needed is:

$ cd tlnet/2008
$ mv tlpkg tlpkg.save
$ mv install-tl/tlpkg .
$ mv tlpkg.save/texlive.tlpdb* tlpkg/
$ mv install-tl install-tl-unpacked
$ mv install-tl-unpacked/install-tl* .

Then one can run directly from that place ...

In install-tl-unpacked remains:
	doc.html      LICENSE.TL	readme-txt.dir/
	index.html    README		README.usergroups
	LICENSE.CTAN  readme-html.dir/	release-texlive.txt
which can also be moved.

KARL: What about changing the layout as is?

Advantage: Installation from rsync of CTAN will work directly
Disadvantage: cluttered tlnet/2008

Other opinions?

Best wishes

however, since the author hasn't uploaded the update, we have little
chance of knowing that it needed to be installed on ctan.

with koma-script, the reasoning is that the stuff is lppl, so we can
"just do it".

with pdftricks, i had recalled that it was one of the river-valley- 
packages that claimed lppl but didn't supply source.

however, i see it's actually gpl, so i've installed the new version.
it'll make it to tex live as soon as the team has time to make that
happen.

since river valley never bother to tell us, we have to rely on other
people's eyes to spot version changes in their packages.

(we gave up using the cvs repository on sarovar for the ctan catalogue
long ago, since it ran like a drain.  i don't believe i've gone to
sarovar since, until today...)

Since Andreas had been quite delighted about the koma-script update, I
assume that he wants to use the new version.  But I fully agree with
you that it's usually not necessary to use the latest stuff.

There is a lot of stuff in TeX Live which is not needed in this
particular case: Support for exotic languages, cm-super, and so on.  I
also think that if LaTeX is learned at school, none of the pupils will
investigate Context.

If you install a customized version of TeX Live on your local machine
and then create a ZIP file containing the whole tree, it will probably
fit on a CD.  A CD is cheaper than a DVD.  This helps the German
government to save money.  They are currently in shortage of money.
The magic formula is not to invest into education.  Yes, a lot of
money can be saved, but....

Siep, IMO your script is very useful.  Maybe feedback from users can
help to improve it, if necessary at all.  Unfortunately it's hidden in
the doc tree and my poriferous brain is unable to remember the name of
the script or its location.  It would be nice if your script could be
more eye-catching.

It would be nice if more poeple are aware of it.  It's definitely a
good thing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

yes - but:

Last years course I prepared a lesson about ps-tricks / pst-euklid which
run properly at home - not so at school.

I had to learn that installing/updating ps-tricks is not quite simple as
other packages.

Message-ID: <f19462ed0811241640g7a902806h5b400a6bef3fb0e3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Just wanted to report an install bug and my fix to see if it could be of
assistance.  I installed TeXLive with the online installer with defaults on
Ubuntu 8.10 64-bit and upon trying to run tlmgr received the error:

Can't locate TeXLive/TLConfig.pm in @INC (@INC contains: //tlpkg /etc/perl
/usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.0 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0 /usr/lib/perl5
/usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10
/usr/local/lib/site_perl .)

Upon further inspection, @INC did not have a path to the default install
directory:
/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg/

so adding
use lib qw(/usr/local/texlive/2008/tlpkg);

to the tlmgr script at the beginning of the use statements will remedy the
problem.  For some reason the attempt to do this with kpsewhich and $MASTER
does not function on my machine.

I am running,
tlmgr revision 11340 (2008-11-18 01:58:41 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /

Hello,

I'm getting the following message when I try to install the TeXLive2008 distribution on my Laptop:

TeXLive::TLUtils::setup_programs failed at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1042.
./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux --help failed (status 32256): No such file or directory
Output is:
Can't exec "./tlpkg/installer/lzma/lzmadec.i386-linux": Permission denied at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 1045.
Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
Cannot continue with installaion.
Please report to texlive at tug.org

This is on a i386 (32bit) DELL LATITUDE | D800 from 2005 running Red Hat Enterprise 5.

I tried both the original DVD sent to me via mail, and I tried using a freshly burned DVD from the i386 iso on the TUG website. Both DVD installs failed with the same error message.

Please let me know what I can do to get this installed.

Many thanks,
Erik

The hope is that students will continue to use (La)TeX after the
course ends, so while a current and complete version may not
be necessary to the course, it is important that the students be
in a position to add packages install updates.  This is particularly
true if the course uses a stripped down configuration -- once
students learn some basic LaTeX the keen ones will want to try
new things.  I find there are 3 stages:

1.  new user -- sticks with basic latex from Lamport's book.
If the experience is good, the new user becomes a
2.  recent convert --  tries out dozens of packages whose
names are found in TLC or web sites.   If the experience
is good, the convert becomes an
3.  average user -- Lamport plus under a dozen packages,
often determined by some journal's style or suggestions
from colleagues.

You have mounted the DVD with

(which happens often). Undo that.

That is not necessary. The problem you have is that you probably have
	/usr/bin/kpsewhich
installed (from some texlive-* or tetex packages), and in the PATH
setting that one is found *before* the one in
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux.

tlmgr finds itself and all the TeX Live modules via
	kpsewhich -expand-var SELFAUTOPARENT
and if that gives you / then you are using the wrong kpsewhich.

And then it is GOOD that tlmgr is not working!!!

> so adding

No, bad, do
	export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
is the proper fix.

Thank you so much!

Red Hat Linux had indeed automatically mounted with the -o noexec option. I umount-ed and issued a simple mount command.

Now TeXLive is happily installing.

Thanks again, and best wishes to you too,
Erik

It is mentioned in chapter 4, `Network installations', of the TeX
Live manual. But of course nobody reads the documentation...

If somebody want a companion cd/dvd to their LAN installation, there
is probably quite a bit of customization so a ready-to-run script
would be inappropriate.

In our case, I wrote a single script which tests whether it is run
from the LAN installation or from the ISO.

I went about it as follows:

- create the installation under Linux, using the TL installer
- create a Samba share for this installation
- write a Windows installer along the lines of the sample client
  script
- test with a Windows virtual machine as samba client
- package into a zip for unpacking on the real network, and into an
  ISO for private installation

I put the ISO into the root of the final installation, since
distribution of physical cds would have been a bit of a hassle.

Well, Debian has TL2007 binaries, but you would need a whole bunch of
libraries there ...

Current installer now has a window with the same output as on the
console, and with a progress bar, and the size of the current packages,
and time estimates.

You might give it a try and report your experiences.

Hi

When installing TeX Live 2008 on our server here I was faced with the
following problem. I some way it is a rare problem.

The client box is a XP SP3 with Novell Client installed. TeX Live
resides on a Server (Open Enterprise Server).
All traces of TeX Live 2007 has been removed from the client.

Below are some  output snippets from a command line.

The first shows the result of the path command. Network drives are
placed at the end.
The second shows the result of the command map.
Watch in both outputs the drive letter w:
Its a so called search mapping, which the novell client are appends to
the path.
Part third the command 'which latex'. latex.exe is found at the correct
place.
Now part four. The output of the command 'latex' shows the problem.


Thanks

Wolfgang Fleischer

P.S.:
At the moment I work around the problem by using the TL2007 way of
configuration. I set TEXMFCNF and replace in texmf.cnf $SELFAUTOPARENT
with a hard coded path.

That is not surprising, you are exporing *ONLY* the bin/win32 directory.
Again, all the tex programs find their config files via
	"My-own-location"/../../texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

That does not work with:

> S9: = W:. [JOTA_APPS.SERVER.HAUS_41:TEX\BIN\WIN32 \]

... that one here!

You have to 
	- map [JOTA_APPS.SERVER.HAUS_41:TEX \] to W:
	- set the PATH to W:\bin\win32

In your setup, where are all the input files of TeX ???

Hallo

Oh I missed to mention this.

Look at 'Drive K:'. The TeX-Trees are in K:\tex. It is a complete tree
copied from my linux server which works fine.
The 's9:=...' line is the novell equivalent for adding k:\tex\bin\win32
to the PATH.
As the which call and the latex call shows - the binary is found.

If your PATH is ...;k:\tex\bin\win32;... instead of
...;W:.;... , texmf.cnf will be found.
Probably, the win32 binary cannot understand the
SELFAUTOPARENT of W:.

Message-ID: <410040C2-7454-4A4D-A82E-CA1DA5E28646@mac.com>

Hi,

Almost since the beginning tlmgr had chosen as a mirror for my updates

http://tezcatl.fciencias.unam.mx/

which makes sense, since it's the closest to my location (Mexico  
City); CTAN chooses the same mirror as well. But in the last couple of  
days, the mirror selection has been totally random; for example,  
trying a dry-run from terminal I get right now

http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008

and with tlmgr -gui I'm getting

http://ctan.troutlilysoftware.com/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008


And for viewing Voss' Mathmode.pdf in my browser CTAN has chosen

http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CTAN

and for the actual download of mathmode.zip it did it from

http://ftp.math.purdue.edu...

I have checked tezcatl.fciencias.unam.mx and it is active, and up to  
date: when Victor Ivrii announced to the TeX on Mac OS mailing list  
that TL and CTAN already had pdftricks 1.16, I did a dry-run and the  
mirror tlmgr chose didn't show it, but I checked in tezcatl and it  
already had it.

Axel

it may be up to date now, but mirror.ctan.org probably has slightly
out-of-date information.  www.dante.de/mirmon is a graphical front end
to the information that mirror.ctan uses; mirror.ctan gives up on a site
if the figure in the 3rd column is worse than 48 hours -- i.e., the site
has missed at least two daily mirrors.

given the problems with the dns over the weekend (it was under attack),
it's entirely reasonable that unam was unable to mirror on sunday, so it
could quite reasonably have been deemed unusable at the time mirror.ctan
sampled.

what i _don't_ know is how often mirror.ctan itself samples; i would
expect the problem to right itself within a day.

I just checked Dante's mirror monitor and tezcatl (which, by the way,  
is `mirror' in nahuatl) has an age of 3 hours and was probed 1 hour  
ago, and, indeed, tlmgr in terminal and tlmgr -gui have chosen it as  
the default mirror for me.

Thank you very much!

Is anyone successfully using xdvi with ghostscript 8.63?  The latter

eps graphics after I installed it.  Reverting to ghostscript 8.62 solved 
the problem.  As usual, I don't know if this is a cygwin issue.

Mac OSX Leopard and Ubuntu 8.10 share the problem:

$ gs --version
8.63
$ xdvi grfguide.dvi
xdvi-xaw: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 9 may be rendered
incorrectly.
xdvi-xaw: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 8 may be rendered
incorrectly.

The rotation examples are indeed not rendered correctly.

The Ubuntu system also has TL2007 from the distro.   The messages are similar,
(with xdvi-xaw --> xdi-bin), and the display has the same problems.

It did turn out to be an easily-fixed cygwin issue (packaging bug).  The 
new ghostscript requires the Cairo library, so I had to install the 
libcairo2 package.  Sorry for the noise.

Howdy,

On this day of Thanksgiving in the US I wanted to thank everyone for  
the great work on TeX Live 2008. It's very solid on my system.

I've been very happy with the GUI version of tlmgr (revision 11411  
(2008-11-24 15:34:01 +0100)) which has been quite solid. I know that I  
haven't pushed it and I've set it up with a fixed repository rather  
than using a mirror but I've only experienced the fairly rare server  
side glitch and it's certainly wonderful to simply pick up updates,  
additions and deletions with little trouble.

Good Luck,

Hi,

first of all, sorry if here's the wrong place to report that?

I have PS files named e.g. sendersOf+.ps, with a comment like %%Title:
/home/foo/stuff/sendersOf+.ps in the beginning. When I try to convert
it into pdf using pstopdf sendersOf+.ps, the file gets renamed to
sendersof-.ps and the conversion aborts with the following message:

PsToPdf | file sendersOf+.ps does not exist

This is with the package texlive_base 2007, Revision 4 from macports;
I'm waiting for them to upgrade to TL 2008, so I didn't check if the
bug is still present.

Is there an easy way of obtaining and installing the many scripts

Note: I know it is possible to do it but I don't know an easy way of
doing it. I did it by essentially preparing a full install of TeX4ht

I then installed as a supplement. Unfortunately, this process seemed to
require installing at least symlinks in the main TeX tree which I
wasn't terribly happy about. It was also a rather fiddly process. I'm
looking for a method I could recommend to other people and I hesitate

In the Debian system, only the following tex4ht executables are
provided in the /usr/bin/ directory (see below for more discussion):

  ht htlatex httex httexi mk4ht t4ht tex4ht

TeX Live adds on top of them the following:

  htcontext htmex htxelatex htxetex

Now, here is the explanation from the Debian's README.scripts file:

  From v.20011214-1, the main shell scripts (httex, htlatex and httexi) are
  provided in the usual /usr/bin directory.  The full range of other scripts
  provided with the package are stored separately, in /usr/share/tex4ht, so as
  not to conflict with any scripts or programs of the same names that might
  belong in other Debian packages. From version 20050216 onwards, the same
  command *names* can be used as arguments to a portmanteau script mk4ht
  which is placed in the /usr/bin directory. [...]
  The Debian versions of the scripts all set the PATH environment
  variable at their start, to find the other scripts in /usr/share/tex4ht, if
  not already set.  Scripts from /usr/share/tex4ht should not normally have to
  be called directly, although they can be if needed.

it seems highly preferable NOT to put the plethora of tex4ht's scripts
into the main bin directory, but, following Debian's approach, put
them in the texmf/scripts/tex4ht directory, and access via the
"portmanteau script mk4ht".

All functionality of tex4ht is available via the mk4ht script, and
there is no need to put the "full range of other scripts" into the bin
directory.

Best,
v.

FYI, I've just made changes to the installer so that relative paths get

It'll be in tonight's build.  If anyone wants to try it, especially on

I don't have either ht or mk4ht from TeX Live - I had to install these
separately and create symlinks in the TL bin directory.

I have htcontext from TL but none of the others.

Which sounds as though it is a Debian customisation. I don't think the
standard versions do this, do they? So you either have to customise
them or install them in your path. It won't  work just to specify full
paths when calling them because they call each other.

Fine. But since they are not available at all (and neither is mk4ht or
ht), the question still stands. Wherever they should be installed, is
there an easy way of obtaining them and installing them there?

I didn't mean to say anything about where they should or shouldn't be
installed in any case. (Except that ht and mk4ht seemed to need to be
installed in or symlinked from the main TL bin directory.)

Apologies but ignore most of my last message. I do now have ht etc. in

thanks,

If I get the time I'll see what happens on windows.

Though I'm going to test moving a TL2008 from Linux to windows first, 
just to see if this is an easier method of doing multiple TL 
installations on  windows

Subject: [tex-live] install-tl from mirrored archive
Message-ID: <200811281948.mASJmMF13986@f7.net>

After tonight's run, the network directory (.../tlnet/2008) will contain
a functional version of the installer: the install-tl and install-tl.bat
scripts and support code in the tlpkg/ subdir.

Therefore, those who have a complete mirror of the network directory can
simply run "install-tl" and it will find the packages in the archive/
subdir.

This also means you can burn a copy of the complete 2008/ dir to a DVD
without changing anything and be able to install from it.

The previously available unpacked install-tl/ subdirectory is now gone,
since its only purpose was to make running the installer convenient.
Now it is more convenient.

Thanks to Norbert and Manuel for suggesting it.  Hope it helps.

Karl

Have you had any problems regarding very long filenames?

Windows unzip terminated without error on this

2008/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pgfplots/oldpgfcompatib/pgfplotsoldpgfsupp_pgflibraryplothandlers.code.tex

PowerArchiver too, though I got a hint.

I just tested again, PowerArchiver can unzip the file where the above is 
removed. But WinXPs own unzip runs throug it all and is missing a lot of 
files and dirs, including bin/, so I guess there are still som long 
names some where.

The sample installer mentioned, seems to be working well. Though I'd 
like to see it install the same things as the 'real' installer, and that 
it create an uninstaller that removes TL as well.

For mass installations this greatly reduces installation time, in my 
latest test it was about 10 mins including

transfer via samba
unzip via PowerArchiver
install-w32client

At lot better that the several hours it might take using a DVD.

Try the command-line unzip of TeX Live.

I'll keep that in mind when I update the script.

well, the idea was to provide TL as a zip to users.

I think I'll see if there is any improvement in transfer speed by 
placing the TL tree on a USB stick or on a DVD (remember we are using an 
already installed TL2008, so it will be doing a straight copy, no 
searching on the DVD).

more or less, I think only tlmgr is missing.

cool. It works really good.

BTW: as a non-xelatex user what is it doing in that latex xelatex step?

Subject: [tex-live] problems with mirror of tex live
Message-ID: <2545.1227953077@mole.cl.cam.ac.uk>

my half-witted mirror of tex live behaved *really* stupidly when
mirroring the new install-tl, i'm afraid -- it changed the old
install-tl directory to status dr--r--r--, and then tried to overwrite
it with the new file (status r-xr-xr-x) on the mirror site.

this anomalous situation left the directory broken, and my home rsync
mirror said

  IO error encountered - skipping file deletion
  ....
  total size is 14959187110  speedup is 6854.99
  rsync error: partial transfer (code 23) at main.c(926)

i have now cleared things up, here, but anyone who tried to mirror me
(and anyone downline from such a site), during the "broken" period, will
have got their mirror into a bad situation.

i'll deal with cries of distress on the ctan mirror list -- i hope not
too many.

Message-ID: <8E0375ED-C1D2-4CA5-ACED-DB719FE306E2@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

On the mactex-support list we've had a couple of reports of problems  
with missing fonts (in particular ptmr7t when using the times package  
or the IEEEtrans document class) from folks that have installed  
BasicTeX which is based on the ?TeX Live basic scheme? with the  
addition of ?LaTeX recommended packages",
"ConTeXt format", "MetaPost (and Metafont) drawing", "PSTricks  
packages", and the "XeTeX macros.?

Can one use tlmgr to install a collection of fonts that would include  
the missing fonts and which collection would have these fonts? Maybe  
better, is there a way to use tlmgr find out which collection has  
these fonts so I don't have to bother this list with things like this?

Good Luck,

This gets tricky, as tlmgr will point you to the obsolete "times" package,
which installs a virtual ptmr7t font.   It sounds like you do have the times
package, so you should be able to make .dvi files.  In principle, you
should be able to generate .pdf's that get the base 13 fonts from the
viewer (e.g., without embedding).  For most people, the URW fonts
will be used when a document mentions one of the base 13 fonts.

Do you have ptmr7t.vf and ptmr7t.tfm?  What happens if you
add a \usepackage{times} to sample2e.tex to get, say,
samp-times.tex and run latex+dvips?  I get a samp-times.ps
with:

$ grep '^%%DocumentFonts:' samp-times.ps
%%DocumentFonts: Times-Roman Times-Bold CMSY10 Times-Italic CMMI10 CMR10

Another simple test file using only plain tex to be used if latex fails:

\font\rm=ptmr7t at 10pt
\rm
\input story
\end


To use tlmgr, first, make sure you have a working "tlmgr --help".
This should give you a
typical "unix man page" that will explain the options show below:

$ tlmgr search --global --file ptmr7
tlmgr: installation location

It configures and runs fc-cache. This program collects information

Today I decided to upgrade vom TL2007 to TL2008.

After two complete install-processes I'm very frustrated :-(

from the beginning:

1)

I've deinstalled TL2007 which did not work properly (failure message)
which I ignored. I deleted the remaining stuff manually. Not all as I
had to notice later.

2)

I've created C:\texlive an granted permissions to every user

3)

I started the net installer

4)

Some packages coukd not be untarred :-(

5)

TeXLive did not work, tlmgr die not start

6)

At the console I tried latex text.tex which di not work. Error messages
pointed me to wrong enviroment-variable which I corrected manually.

7)

latex still does not work

II. TRY

8)

I removed C:\texlive and removed all PATH and enviroment-variables
relating to TeX

9)

I started the net installer

10)

Some packages coukd not be untarred :-(

11)

TLMG-GIU starts this time but doesn't work

12)

latex works

13)

tlmgr at the console does not work :-(

error message:

Hi Herb (and Dick),

    On the mactex-support list we've had a couple of reports of problems  
    with missing fonts (in particular ptmr7t when using the times package  
    or the IEEEtrans document class) from folks that have installed  
    BasicTeX which is based on the ?TeX Live basic scheme? with the  
    addition of ?LaTeX recommended packages",
    "ConTeXt format", "MetaPost (and Metafont) drawing", "PSTricks  
    packages", and the "XeTeX macros.?

Installing subsets always cause these problems.  I know why BasicTeX
exists, but ...

    Can one use tlmgr to install a collection of fonts that would include  
    the missing fonts and which collection would have these fonts? 

collection-fontsrecommended.  I leave it to you to determine how big it
is -- perhaps BasicTeX could include it; a lot of stuff will fail
without it.  The package is "times".  

    Maybe better, is there a way to use tlmgr find out which collection
    has these fonts so I don't have to bother this list with things like
    this?

tlmgr search --file ptmr7t.tfm gets you the package.  I guess we haven't
implemented an option to get from the package to the collection(s) which
have dependencies on it.

Personally, I just looked at texlive.tlpdb directly: search for
/ptmr7t.tfm, look backwards a few lines for the package name (times),
search for "depend times", look backwards to see the collection name.

Best,
karl

Hum, I just tried, after updating my local copy from Cambridge's node,
and install-tl isn't executable. ftp-ing to tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008,
I can see install-tl isn't executable there either.

Is there a way to make it executable on the mirror so that mirroring
with a tools that preserves permissions (such a rsync) allows to run
install-tl directly, without needing to chmod it first?

Manuel.

has it ever been executable on the mirrors?  (it's not executable on the
source that ctan mirrors from, so it's not surprising it isn't on
cambridge, or anything that mirrors cambridge, i.e., the whole of ctan
and its collection of mirrors.)

One of my coworkers had the same disappearing tlmgr; however closer
look proved that disappeared only symlink

tlmgr -> ../../texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

while tlmgr.pl was intact. Check

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

Ok, but what does cambridge mirror then? You must have a source

I can't remember whether it was executable in its old location.

    tug mirrors cambridge.

Well, the directory Manuel looked at, ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/2008,
is the ultimate source (what cambridge mirrors).

The actual file on tug.org is executable.  What's happening is that I
long ago configured our (pro)ftpd to use FakeModes, so that all dirs
appear as 555 and all files appear as 444, regardless of the real mode.
We've never wanted anything to be executable before.

I will work now to set up a special login for Robin that doesn't do the
fake stuff.  We wanted to do that for other reasons too.

or a rsync-accessible directory?  (if i'm going to special-case the
mirroring, i may as well switch to the better protocol at the same
time...)

Btw, currently just chmod-ing install-tl is not enough. Just for the
record, here are teh necessary steps for those wanting to install (or
create a USB stick whose filesystme remembers permission) from current
tlnet:

$ chmod +x install-tl
$ chmod +x tlpkg/installer/wget/*
$ chmod +x tlpkg/installer/lzma/*
$ chmod +x tlpkg/installer/config.guess

Subject: [tex-live] Installing on Linux for use on both (Linux and Vista)
Message-ID: <4932B0ED.7030808@gmx.org>

Hi!

At least I succeeded installing to linux with both binaries (Linux and
win32).

TeX works properly on Linux, my files in texmf-local are found if a
compile using latex.

I'v added the path to /bin/win32 on my Vista-PC and LaTeX works, but
_does not find files in /texmf-local_

Any hints?

Thanks,

Andreas

Most likely sources of difficulty:

1.  latex is not looking for texmf-local where you put it
      a.  you put in the wrong place
      b.  something (environment variable) is making latex
           search elsewhere

     On linux:  kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFLOCAL'.
     This may need different quoting on Vista.

2.  since this is Vista -- permission problems preventing
    latex from accessing the texmf-local directory.

The list archives have examples related to 1. above, for 2.
you may have to do some research.

Assuming you installed to <tldir>/2008 (on linux, the default is
<tldir>=/usr/local/texlive), then latex, etc., look for files in
<tldir>/texmf-local, but this can be changed in one of the
texmf.cnf files or (not recommended!) environment variables
such as TEXMFLOCAL.

You can use kpsewhich and related tools to debug such
problems.  Look for the kpathsea documentation:

$ texdoc -l kpathsea

look for: 3.5.3 Auxiliary tasks.

Linux has some more options:
$ man -M <tldir>/2008/texmf/doc/man kpsewhich
$ info <tldir>/2008/texmf/doc/info/kpathsea.info

As I mentioned in my mail, kpsewhich finds the file - everything is ok
on my linux-maschine.

I solved the problem by reconfiguring WinEdt.

Hi,

so,this is a report, not a bug-report ;-)

starting tlmgr I get the following error:

kpsewhich is there ;-)

I'd have not read the documentation carefully - after setting PATH this
problem lo longer exists.

Maybe a hint for the installing user may be helpful

<http://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html> does mention setting the
PATH, but should perhaps also be explicit about the
privileges required to install TeX Live.   Perhaps wording like:

       ----------------------------------------------------------
TeX Live is designed to avoid touching  system files/directories,
so the recommended practice for unix/linux is to create the
top-level directory (which may, depending on the location, require
root/administrator privileges) but make it owned by the regular user
who is designated as the TeX Live administrator.   Then
tlmgr commands can be run by the TeX Live administrator.
     -----------------------------------------------------------

SInce you have a working installation done as root, you
can do:

# chown -R <regular_user>:<some_group> /usr/local/texlive

Afterwards, <regular_user> can do updates with tlmgr,
create formats, etc.  You may find that some TeX-related
directories in your $HOME directory are owned by root,
and will also need ownership changes.   Typically this
occurs when someone runs a tool (fmtutil, etc) that has
a "-sys" version as root but without the "-sys".
