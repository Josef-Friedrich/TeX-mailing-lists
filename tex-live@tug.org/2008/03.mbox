I have recent texlive. 

\documentclass[10pt,a4paper,english]{article}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\begin{document}

\end{document}

I get:

l.5 What is ?
              
? 
! Emergency stop.
\u-default-960 #1->\textpi 

Any clues?

Hi Alexis,

Thanks for the reports.

    100_all_build_mpost_at_compile_time.patch: It has been reported that
    mpost was built during make install target and not during 'make' /
    'make all' target. This patch should correct this. Refs [1].

Well, it should have gotten built if you were building the `dumps'
target by default (which is what the original Makefile does), but I can
easily imagine you weren't.

In any case, mpost should be included in the `engines' variable, so 
it wouldn't be right to include it in the `programs' variable too.  Due
to other changes, though, it wasn't in engines.  I've restored that.

    120_all_omegafonts_parallel_make.patch: It seems texk/web2c/omegafonts/
    is not parallel make safe due to a dependency problem in the makefiles.

No problem there.  Thanks for the patch.

there is no such command as \textpi

> Any clues?

a bug in (some part of) the ucs.sty bundle.  unfortunately, the bundle
is no longer supported.  (it will in the "unsupported" part of the next
texlive, but the situation wasn't obvious a year ago.)

to deal with the problem, put

  \DeclareTextCommandDefault\textpi{\ensuremath{\pi}}

in the preamble of your document.  in general, those things don't work
without \usepackage{textcomp} but (a) i don't know if ucs.sty loads it
by default, and (b) it's not necessary in this case, of course.

If you want to work with unicode, you should investigate xe(la)tex:

% -*- coding: utf-8-unix -*-
% format using xelatex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[no-math]{fontspec}
\usepackage{xunicode,xltxtra}

%\defaultfontfeatures{Mapping=tex-text}
%\setromanfont{Latin Modern Roman} % I don't get the pi
\setromanfont{STIXGeneral} % this works for me
%\setromanfont{Charis SIL} % this works for me

Dear TL-developers,

I'm sorry, I don't have enough time to search for the commit, that is
responsible for the problem.
The only help, I can provide is some testing and sending the log-messages,
time consuming analysis won't be possible in 2008 ... :(

I attach 2 files for you:
- a script, that shows how I build tl
- the output of exactly this script

2 problems show up:
- prefix/share/texmf-[...] are in the TEXMF search path instead of
  prefix/texmf-[...]
- after removal of prefix/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, there is
  prefix/../texmf-local in the TEXMF search path instead of
  prefix/texmf-local

It would be interesting, how the texmf.cnf is generated and/or from where
it comes.

Cheers, Peter

Hi Peter,

    It would be interesting, how the texmf.cnf is generated and/or from where
    it comes.

The texmf.cnf in Master/texmf/web2c/ is not generated from anywhere.  It
is maintained by hand, although I try to keep it in sync with
Build/source/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in.

The texmf.cnf that is generated by a build of the sources is not used
anywhere in TeX Live itself.  (That is the one you are talking about, I
take it.)  It is generated by rules in kpathsea/Makefile.in, which
basically substitute most of Make's directory-related variables.  It is
nothing terribly complex.

I would expect you to be able to get the paths you want by suitable
configure options, e.g., --datadir=$PREFIX.  (That is what our
Build/source/Build script does.)  The $prefix/share default comes from
the definition of datadir in Autoconf.

Best,
karl

It may be used in post build calls of fmtutils and the like.

Understanding the relationship (or lack of relationship) between the 
texmf.cnf in Build and the texlive texmf texm.cnf is not trivial.
And in the Build texmf.cnf, it may be quite complex to get it to do 
what you want, for example if you want to follow the linux File
Hierarchy Standard (at least in texlive 2007). I attach a patch that
sets more paths that you could apply to help packagers (though these
are not used), and also the patch we use in fedora to get the texmf.cnf 
we want. As you may see this is not a trivial change...

Ha! Thanks for the explanation, that'll explain why I always failed. I
had always stopped to the point where I needed non installed headers
from icu and/or inconsistency in their installed headers (like they
tried to include some non installed headers...).

Perfect, thanks for the explanation.
For the patch against ICU, one can be found at [1], there are probably
other places to find it but this one should apply against 3.8.1.
As you said it's a non issue, perhaps you would like to not apply it
because it would give you some extra work for future icu merges in
xetex; I don't know how you are working there.

Regards,

Alexis.

Hmm yes, in fact I'm not building them because I enable fmtutil. I'm
not 100% sure it is the best idea, but so far it worked very nicely.

Thanks for the comments, I've updated my patch to match yours.

Thanks, --datadir works all right!

In fact, I thought, that there was some auto-detection of the data-prefix,
dependent on the placement of texmf-dist, but it seems that's no more true.

JFYI, --datarootdir give an error:

    Hmm yes, in fact I'm not building them because I enable fmtutil. I'm
    not 100% sure it is the best idea, but so far it worked very nicely.

Using fmtutil is far superior to building the dumps at configure time.
(The latter made sense 20 years ago, but not these days.)

I just changed web2c/Makefile.in to no longer build the dumps target by
default.

I'm sorry, but I at least cannot guess the answer to such a general

Hello,

I've made an rpm-spec-file for an easy texlive-rpm-installation:

rpmbuild --rebuild --force http://pmrb.free.fr/texlive/texlive.nosrc.rpm

I've tested it only on openSUSE, so if you could test it on other systems,
that would be nice.

Features:
- support for easy ConTeXt update (command "updateConTeXt.sh")
- support for easy LuaTeX update (command "updateLuaTeX.sh")
- support for URW Garamond
- support for Adobe eurofont
- support for ruby and lua versions of ConTeXt scripts
- latest TeX-live
- latest ConTeXt
- latest LuaTeX

Cheers, Peter

Message-ID: <47CD3827.3070004@uni.torun.pl>

Dear friends,

The BachoTeX 2008 Program Committee dares to remind you of the quickly
upcoming deadline for submitting paper proposals for the BachoTeX 2008
conference. The Call for Papers and TeX Pearls can be found
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008/cfp1en.

We trust that the main theme of the conference, ,,TeX contra TeX''
should be of a great interest to the community at large and the
various developers in particular.

You may have noted that the supplementing theme "Aesthetic aspects
of typesetting" is also addressed to those who use other typesetting
software. If you know people active in this area please talk them
into presenting a paper.

Your children or very young TeXies in your vicinity are invited to
contribute in the yet another conference supplementing theme "What
is TeX to me?"

Based on suggestions and experiences from previous years, one day of
the conference will be devoted solely to working meetings of the
various informal interest groups (no presentations):
- fonts,
- TeX engines,
- distributions,
- supporting software,
- typesetting software in general,
- propagating TeX,
- history of TeX
-- you name it. Talk your common interest buddies into coming and/or
propose a paper.

Do not forget submitting your "TeX Pearls" aka "TeX beauties and
oddities"!

And, finally -- registration is open at
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008/registration-en. Please note
that early registration ending March 31 allows for a significant
saving in the conference fee.

Come and celebrate the XVIth, or $10000_{2}$ or $100_{4}$ or
$20_{8}$ or $10_{16}$ BachoTeX!

Jonathan,


I have been asked whether you can implement a `BoldFont' feature
similar to the `SlantFont' feature already part of XeTeX.  For CJK
fonts such an option can be very useful.  Currently, we are emulating
it with

  \special{pdf: literal direct 0.5 w 2 Tr}

but a native XeTeX solution would be better.

Karl,


has there been any decision whether more CJK fonts (in particular, the
remaining Wadalab fonts) will be added to TeXLive?

BTW, I'm going to integrate the hwkatakana stuff into the various
Wadalab packages; adding *all* Wadalab packages to TeXLive would need
further tweaks and modifications in TeXLive since the CJK package has
been specially tailored for the current reduced font set of TeXLive,
among other things.

Werner, maybe I am not up to date. But after every update of the  
system I have to start from scratch to bring my CJK system under  
Texlivexxxx to run (e.g. adding cyberbit or other fonts like  
sazanami). Is there no way to make this more user friendly? I have to  
add configuration files, have to edit map-files etc.

As I wrote: Maybe this is a problem of me. But soemtimes other users  
have the same problems as I.

Norbert Preining's article in the 2007 EuroTeX proceedings gives a
nice overview how such situations can be managed with the Debian
distribution of TeXLive.  It's not a trivial task, and it isn't
managed automatically by TeXLive directly, AFAIK.

Hi!

Is there are a texlive package which contains the "frameenv" environment? In 
old tetex it was in picins.sty which I couldn't find in any texlive package

(Unfortunately I accidently mixed texlive stuff with old tetex stuff in my

I've avoided trying to implement a "synthetic bold" feature on the  
grounds that it's likely to be far inferior to a true bold face.  
While word processors and web browsers may get away with  
algorithmically thickening strokes to create a "bold" effect, I don't  
think it's something to encourage in quality typesetting.

However, I can see that it could be useful at times, when there  
aren't true styled fonts available; I'll try to look into the  
possibilities.

    Is there are a texlive package which contains the "frameenv" environment? In

picins was released under a nonfree license, so it was removed from TeX
Live (and teTeX) some time ago.  See this thread:

Whether anything else provides frameenv, I do not know.  Sorry.

Hi Patrice,

    > The texmf.cnf that is generated by a build of the sources is not used
    > anywhere in TeX Live itself.  [...]

    It may be used in post build calls of fmtutils and the like.

No.  I said, *in TeX Live itself*.  I repeat: the texmf.cnf generated
by make in the source tree is not used *in TeX Live itself*.

I realize you distro guys may use it as a basis for what you do, but it
is not used in our original TeX Live.  Really.  Trust me on this :).

    Understanding the relationship (or lack of relationship) between the 
    texmf.cnf in Build and the texlive texmf texm.cnf is not trivial.

Any suggestions on how/where I can make it clearer?  To repeat, the only
relationship is that I manually make changes to both files to try to
keep them as in sync as much I can, as far as the actual values go.

    And in the Build texmf.cnf, it may be quite complex to get it to do 
    what you want, for example if you want to follow the linux File
    Hierarchy Standard (at least in texlive 2007). 

I agree.  I never said otherwise.  All I said was that it seemed to me
the process was operating in the usual and expected way, and there was
no bug to fix regarding the "extra" /share.

    +  sysconfdir=$(sysconfdir) localstatedir=$(localstatedir) \
    +  libexecdir=$(libexecdir) \
Accepted.

    +# modifiable single-machine data.
    +localstatedir = @localstatedir@
    ...
Accepted.

    -vartexfonts = /var/tmp/texfonts
    +vartexfonts = $(localstatedir)/cache/fonts

Using $(localstatedir) makes sense, and if all the distros need the same
thing, I'll change it to anything you guys want.  Otherwise, I'm not
sure what to do.

Ditto the changes you are making in texmf.cnf.

(See next message.)

Thanks,
Karl

I am not really the texlive maintainer in fedora, Jindrich Novy, jnovy
at redhat dot com is the maintainer, I am somehow a co-maintainer.
Jonathan Underwood is also doing a good work in fedora around texlive.
He is submitting (and will maintain) the pieces of texlive we maintain 
out of texlive (dvipdfmx, xdvik...).

I personally think that these issues can go through this list, the
maintainers should already be able to triage what is for here, upsteram
and what is distro specific. Having more information shared between
distribution maintainers should be very nice, however, and if you think
that it adds too much noise to this list, a separate list indeed could
be done.

Never mind, I figured its really just "frameenv" that's missing for my thesis 
document, and it's only used for some minor cosmetical issue, so I simply 
commented it out for now... maybe I fix it when I have too much time towards 
the deadline. ;)   (not going to happen I guess) :P

Thanks for your help guys!

Hi. I'm told you now maintain updmap. Recently pdflatex started
producing messages like

  pdfTeX warning: pdflatex: No flags specified for non-embedded font
  `Times-Roman' (ptmr8r) (I'm using 34): fix your map entry.

when 

pdftexDownloadBase14 false

is specified in updmap.cfg.  The solution it seems is to add "fontflags" to
the relevant map entries:

ptmr8r Times-Roman 34 "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc
ptmb8r Times-Bold 262178 "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc
ptmbi8r Times-BoldItalic 262242 "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc
ptmri8r Times-Italic 98 "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc

pcrro8r Courier-Oblique  99 "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc

I suggest these revisions be made to the pdftex35.map distributed with

Looks like your compiler on Linux-i586 is stricter (newer gcc  
version?). It's right; the code is wrong, though that's a branch of  
the conditional that should never actually be used.

Hello Jonathan,

I'm sorry, on the i586 machine, there are further errors. This time I used
the command "make -k world" to get all remaining errors. The output is
attached.

Thanks for your previous commit!

On Fedora 8 my yum update fails (now since weeks).

This is clearly wrong since fc9 should never appear (I am in fc8).
The packages that do not appear here can be installed, and I did.
The ones that appear will fail even if you just try them one
at the time.

Any help? Thanks.

Thanks,

I will try this. Still the error I get looks to me like a bug,
that should be probably removed if things have to work for
all fc8 users (as they did before this last set of updates).

Thanks, this is helpful. I've committed fixes for most of these, and

I'm not totally sure what's triggering this, but hope to get a newer  
compiler installed and look into it. What version of gcc do you have  
on that system? I don't see these errors with gcc 4.2.1 on Ubuntu.

Can you disable that warning, at least temporarily, to see if  
everything else will build OK?

I strongly advise turning off -Werror.  Warnings are not errors.  It is
not realistic to suppose that source code can be compiled without
warnings on every platform.  That is not a goal for TeX Live (or GNU).

Well, --datarootdir is a rather recent (on our time scales :) invention.  

We have a hacked ncurses and it is so minimally used in TL I don't

that, or having it simply ignore the option.

We may see it, but in any case it adds noise here which is unwanted and
bugzilla is the tool used in the fedora distro.

I would like to ask when TL 2008 will go to production. The reason for
my question is that I would like to finish a few packages, put them to
CTAN and heve them included in TL. On of these packages is Velthuis
Devanagari. It contains also a modified version of the preprocessor.
However, the modification in the preprocessor are not very important:

 \def\DevnagVersion is inserted at the beginning of the second line
 if the first line starts with %&

 Error and warning messages written to stderr instead of stdout
 (requested by Karl Berry)

I will provide Linux executables for i386 and x86_64 as well as
Windows executable (verified even on Windows Vista) but it will not be
a big problem if executable version 2.14 will be kept on some
platforms.

I would also like to include Hindi in babel. The package now contains
both hindi.dtx and generated hindi.ldf so even without running the
whole babel stuff it is sufficient to add the following line to
language.dat:

hindi zerohyph.tex

It was tested even with XeLaTeX.

CSTUG would also like to include new babel modules for the Czech and
Slovak languages. The aim was to remove a lot of conflicts between
LaTeX and CSLaTeX while keeping compatibility with existing documents.
CSLaTeX could then be removed because its functionality is implemented
in the new modules. The were developed under the CSTUG grant, the
result is available from
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/cstug/tesarik/csbabel/ but it was
developed before XeTeX appeared in TL. Further I modified the package
(information for language.dat) so that the modules work with XeLaTeX
too and made a script which installs the modules for TL, teTeX and
MiKTeX (tested on Linux, OS/2 and Windows). The script currently does
not handle path names containing spaces. It is available from

http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/tex/csh_babel.php

We know that the right way is to have it included in the babel
distribution but as I was informed some time ago J. Braams does not
respond. Is it possible to include these modules to TL although a
small patch to the babel core is required?

The target is June.  There is still a lot to do.

Do you intend to come to Bachotek?

Hi Zdenek,

    I would like to ask when TL 2008 will go to production. 

The June target that Reinhard mentions is when I want to have the final
images go to production.  Hopefully *early* June.  Ultimately, I'd like
people to have the DVD's in their hands by TUG'08 (mid-July), and since
realistically it always takes at least a month for disc production and
mailing ...

The biggest remaining task on the sources side is to import LuaTeX.
Martin plans to work on that over Easter (that's March 23 for those like
me who don't have Easter dates implanted in their heads :).  I hope to
turn over the sources to the builders for an initial shot at it shortly
after that.  

That's for the sources.  We won't be freezing package updates until
later, when the builds are actually done and tested and all that.

So the answer to your package updates is, it doesn't have to be
instantaneous or anything, but of course the sooner the better.

Having the Windows binary will be great.  Unix binaries aren't
important, as we'll be recompiling everything anyway.  (Many times.)

I'll answer about Babel separately.

Thanks,
k

    language.dat:
    hindi zerohyph.tex

Sounds fine.

    Is it possible to include these modules to TL although a
    small patch to the babel core is required?

Robin, is there any movement on the babel front within the latex team?
Clearly getting updates into official babel (one way or another -- you
already know my best theory is to "unbundle" it, similarly to graphics
drivers, etc.) would be ideal.

Failing that, here is my thinking:

- I really, really, don't want to have TL-specific patches to packages,
  especially not in core latex.

- Several languages have newer/better support than what is in current
  babel.  It seems to me that we want users to benefit from those updates.

- Right now, TL imports Heiko's latex-tds package, not latex itself
  (since it's so much easier, and pdfs are optimized, etc.).  

- Therefore, I wondered about pushing such babel updates into latex-tds.
  Then there will still be an original on CTAN for TL+MiKTeX, it will be
  a clearly different source than official latex (so Braams won't have
  to give up his control), but users will have the new support.
  
  Heiko, wdyt?  In this scenario, you would be the one doing the
  integration work, so it's you who has the final say ...

Thanks,
k

Hello Jonathan,

This is my compiler:
g++ (SUSE Linux) 4.3.0 20080221 (prerelease) [gcc-4_3-branch revision 132521]

After removing the "-Werror" in the Makefiles, I get 3 remaining
warnings. I attach the whole output of "make all" in libs/graphite-engine.

Cheers, Peter

Hello Karl,

My personal opinion is, that there should not be any warning in the
compiler output, for just one simple reason:
If there are always 5 warnings in my project, that are harmless and can be
ignored, and suddenly there is a sixth one (perhaps not so harmless), I can
easily overlook this new warning.
But if there are always 0 warnings, and then a new one, it's easy to detect
it (warnings get coloured in emacs...).

When I know, that a warning is harmless, I put a 
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-W..."
in the file.

Cheers, Peter

OK, that's good to know, because I also wanted to release and update 
some stuff to CTAN soon enough that it would be part of TL2008 ;) 
Especially polyglossia, which will provide a babel replacement for users 
of xelatex.
(Zdenek: I'll contact you offlist about integrating your hindi support 
in polyglossia).

I could do it myself on a GNU/Linux 2.4.26-sparc-r2 (Gentoo 1.4.16)
machine (thanks to Nelson Beebe) if there is no one else, but I'd be
very happy if another person could take care of it :).

Please let me know if you can volunteer.

    My personal opinion is, that there should not be any warning in the

Like I said, zero warnings (especially with lots of -W options enabled)
on all systems in all configurations is not feasible and is not a goal
for TL.  So don't expect it.  (Of course, minimizing warnings is all to
the good.)

Indeed, you are right. But the values used in texmf.cnf are the same
than the one used in paths.h and therefore the same than the kpathsea
compiled in defaults. That is where there is a relationship.

I may be missing something , but these values are also used in paths.h?

You should just change nothing. It is up to us to do some changes to fit
with our platform. That's why I made 2 patches. One that you can apply
to make our live easier, and another you should not apply because it is
fedora specific. I think that we cannot avaoid to do
distribution/platform specific stuff in texlive packaging given the 
complexity, the history and the number of platform supported.

I just uploaded texlua wrappers for ppower4 to the TeX Live
repository.  Maybe it's better to remove ppower4 from the makefile.
It is not needed there anymore.

Message-ID: <47D6B122.2050709@enst-bretagne.fr>

Hello,

I'm the main developer of gregorio (http://home.gna.org/gregorio/), and 
I'm using virtual fonts of omega for the TeX part. I recently tried to 
build my fonts on a 32 bit system (I was in 64 bit before), but ovp2ovf 
was segfaulting with the font http://norgz.info/download/gregorio.ovp 
(which is a valid ovp font). My version of TeXLive is the one of debian sid.

To prevent this segfault, Arthur Reutenauer provided me a patch that 
works fine :

in build/source/texk/web2c/omegafonts/font_routines.c line 60 :

replace

if (no_fonts == font_table_size)

by

if (no_fonts * BLOCK == font_table_size)

You can consider this patch safe as it was aprouved by Yannis Haralambous and Arthur Reutenauer.

Thank you in advance,

Hi Bob,

      pdfTeX warning: pdflatex: No flags specified for non-embedded font
      `Times-Roman' (ptmr8r) (I'm using 34): fix your map entry.

Thanks very much for writing and giving us an early heads-up on this.

After some discussion with Martin and Hartmut, the result was that the
best approach would be for pdftex *not* to warn about the flags missing
for the "base14" fonts when unembedded, since it already knows exactly
what flags to use.  (It's rather nontrivial to add the flags to the map
file(s), due to all the tools involved.)  This will be in the next
pdftex release.

However, it will (as I understand it) continue to warn about any other
fonts which are unembedded without flags.  There are none such in TeX
Live, as far as I know.

Thanks again,
Karl

Thanks to you, Arthur, and Yannis.  Looks sensible, I installed it.

For the record, I couldn't reproduce the seg fault, though -- running
the existing ovp2ovf on http://norgz.info/download/gregorio.ovp on a
32-bit GNU/Linux x86 machine worked fine.

That'll be fine. I think unnecessary warnings should be avoided
(particularly when they warn the user to "fix" something).

Hello,

what do you mean by install ? Will this patch be integrated in the next 
version of texlive ?

Well, as you can see on 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=470433 , a omfonts that 
does not segfault on some machines segfaults on my laptop (Dell XPS 
m1530), which I really don't understand...

Thank you in advance,

  Nor can I on any of my machines, actually.  That's strange.  Anyway,
this was a real bug and I experienced it myself many years ago (see
http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/aleph/2005-July/000409.html for my detailed
explanation).

Message-ID: <68c491a60803140253h4ee88083p14394c80c7d9e866@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
we (QuinScape) are using a variante of xmltex distributed in a
separate texmf-tree, where the fmt also ends up in this texmf-tree
(this all on top of TL2007).  Keeping the fmt in sync with the sources
and the engine is currently done manually. :-(

Is there an easy way to automate this? The optimal solution would be a
seamless integration in the way formats are handled now, i.e. fmtutil
generates them when asked for or when they are missing. As fmtutil.cnf
curently doesn't handle includes, this would mean at least a separate
fmtutil.cnf, right?

TIA
  Martin

    Maybe it's better to remove ppower4 from the makefile.

I removed it (and the script itself), thanks for the heads-up.

1) Perhaps you would like to also make a wrapper for pdfthumb.  (The
   other script in ppower4.)

2) I think it would be clearer to use extensions in the .../scripts
   directories, e.g., ppower4.texlua instead of just ppower4.

3) When setting up symlinks in the bin directories, it is necessary to
   add the new link to the list in texk/tetex/Makefile.in; otherwise,
   when the normal builds are done, the links will be lost.
   
   I should probably move that to texlive/Makefile.in, but anyway.

karl

P.S. Alternatively, I wonder if anyone uses ppower4 any more.  Maybe we
should just remove it.  It has been untouched for six years, and there
have been a lot of presentation packages developed in the meantime.

Message-ID: <20080314133818.6673a5b9@gandalf.gondor>

Hi texlive specialists!

Because there are no binaries for FreeBSD-AMD64, I try to compile
texlive by myself. But I am running into problems during the build of
freetype2.

What I have done so far:
* Downloaded texlive branch2007 with subversion.
* Set GNUMAKE with: export GNUMAKE=/usr/local/bin/gmake
* Went to branch2007/Build/source
* Ran: ./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/local

Here is the output of the build run:
[ ... ]

Maybe the build script still uses BSD make instead of GNU make,
although I set the GNUMAKE variable. So I tried to alias make to gmake
by "alias make=/usr/local/bin/gmake" in the xterm and in the shell
startup file. "which make" pointed to /usr/local/bin/gmake even in
subshells, but the build problems persisted.

I am at a loss. What could I try next?


Kind regards,

Try setting the TL_MAKE variable:

	export TL_MAKE=/usr/local/bin/gmake
	./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/local

I think that's the top-level thing you need to override in order to  
get the right "make" everywhere.

HTH,

There is a port of TeXlive for OpenBSD. Maybe a port for Free is in
the works? Ask ports.

    As fmtutil.cnf curently doesn't handle includes, this would mean at
    least a separate fmtutil.cnf, right?

So it would seem.  Maybe you could have a process that takes the
distributed fmtutil.cnf, adds your entries, and puts the result in a
tree with higher precedence than the original fmtutil.cnf.  That's what
comes to mind, though no doubt I'm not understanding the full scope of
the problem ...

Done. -> rev 6971.

Good idea, not only because it is clearer for humans, it also makes it
easier to identify the files by scripts.  Done, with pleasure.

Ok, but maybe it even makes more sense to have an extra script which
can be run in Master/bin and can be called by the Makefile.  This
makes it easier to create the symlinks for testing the stuff in
Master/bin without the need to compile the binaries.

I extended Makefile.in a little bit in order to support the -sys

LaTeX has been untouched for fourteen years.  And there is Context.
Is this a reason to remove it?

I propose to keep it, unless there are any good reasons to remove it.


BTW, I added the svn:executable flag to everything in Master/bin but
it's certainly better to extend ~/.subversion/config.  What I have now is:

  | # Extensions we want to be executable.
  | *.bat = svn:executable=ON
  | *.exe = svn:executable=ON
  | *.pl  = svn:executable=ON
  | *.rb  = svn:executable=ON
  | *.lua = svn:executable=ON
  | *.texlua = svn:executable=ON

I added *.lua because this extension is used by Context scripts.
 

  | # Expand the $ Id: $ string.
  | *.bat = svn:keywords "Date Author Id"
  | *.rb  = svn:keywords "Date Author Id"
  | *.pl  = svn:keywords "Date Author Id"
  | *.lua = svn:keywords "Date Author Id"
  | *.texlua = svn:keywords "Date Author Id"

This is new.  It's painful to set these properties manually.  Maybe it
makes sense to put it into http://tug.org/texlive/svn/config.txt .

  Reinhard

There has to be a better way than repeating all that shell code.  I'll
look at it.

    LaTeX has been untouched for fourteen years.        And there is Context.

Nonsense.  Both of those are updated regularly.  Ppower4 has been
literally untouched since 2002, judging by the dates on CTAN.

    I propose to keep it, unless there are any good reasons to remove it.

True enough.

    BTW, I added the svn:executable flag to everything in Master/bin but
    it's certainly better to extend ~/.subversion/config.  What I have now is:

I don't agree it is "certainly better".  In my mind, the more
independent of the config file the repo can be, the better.

    This is new.  It's painful to set these properties manually.  Maybe it
    makes sense to put it into http://tug.org/texlive/svn/config.txt .

No.  It is highly desirable for keyword expansion to be enabled explicitly.

So? AFAIK you know Gentoo; its Portage is similar to BSD ports.

Message-ID: <20080314133818.6673a5b9@gandalf.gondor>

Hi texlive specialists!

Because there are no binaries for FreeBSD-AMD64, I try to compile
texlive by myself. But I am running into problems during the build of
freetype2.

What I have done so far:
* Downloaded texlive branch2007 with subversion.
* Set GNUMAKE with: export GNUMAKE=/usr/local/bin/gmake
* Went to branch2007/Build/source
* Ran: ./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/local

Here is the output of the build run:
[ ... ]
cd po; make all

'x/usr/home/mickraus/latex/texlive/branch2007/Build/source/libs/freetype/po' != 'x.'; then  posrcprefix='/usr/home/mickraus/latex/texlive/branch2007/Build/source/libs/freetype/';  else  posrcprefix="../";  fi;  sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^[     ]*$/d'  -e "s at .*@       $posrcprefix& \\\\@"  -e '$s/\(.*\) \\/\1/' < /usr/home/mickraus/latex/texlive/branch2007/Build/source/libs/freetype/po/POTFILES.in > POTFILES )

       68.22 real        60.99 user         5.38 sys


Maybe the build script still uses BSD make instead of GNU make,
although I set the GNUMAKE variable. So I tried to alias make to gmake
by "alias make=/usr/local/bin/gmake" in the xterm and in the shell
startup file. "which make" pointed to /usr/local/bin/gmake even in
subshells, but the build problems persisted.

I am at a loss. What could I try next?


Kind regards,
Michael Krauss

I agree that this is not a good solution, an external script is a
better solution.

What do you want to be changed in Ppower4?

Can you explain?  What is wrong if a string "$ Id: $" in a texlua script
is expanded automatically?

To report on a bit more on TL+FreeBSD, I tried building texlive on my
amd64 Freebsd 8.0-CURRENT VM.

After setting TL_MAKE to gmake as needed. I ran ./Build
--with-fontconfig=/usr/local

for the main svn branch with fresh Build directory, (r6971) the build
broke partway.

Copied the binaries into Master/bin and used xelatex to build a file.


I'm not too familiar with the texlive dev process, so I'm not sure
what relationship the branch has with the main trunk right now, but at
least that branch apparently works on freebsd amd64

This is a portability bug in the ICU library. While the version of  
ICU in TL (for xetex) is slightly patched, none of its build system  
(or this stuff in /common/) has been touched, so the issue comes  
directly from their build. I notice that FreeBSD is listed as a  
"rarely tested" platform (see http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/ 
icu/tags/release-3-8-1/readme.html), so occasional breakage may occur.

Anyhow, I have just checked in a patch that I hope will fix this,  
copied from a recent change in ICU trunk; it looks like they have  
corrected this for a future release. Please let me know if it builds  
OK now.

The branch contains what was released as TL2007, with only a few  
critical bug-fixes applied since then, whereas trunk has had major  
updates (new versions of many TeX-related programs, and also of 3rd- 
party libs such as ICU, Freetype, and others). So depending how  
widely all these things are tested upstream, it's not surprising if  
we see some build problems when they're all collected into TL and  
built on a wide variety of platforms. In this particular case, it  
looks like an ICU update that hadn't been thoroughly tested on FreeBSD.

What's important now, for TL2008, is to do trial builds in good time,  
so that we can flush out any such problems in time for the release.  
So thanks for reporting this.

Jonathan

Unless I am wrong it is more or less what debian texlive does, with
custom scripts.

Unfortunately I met the linking problem above. This is strange because
FreeBSD 7 and 8 should use the same compiler:

mickraus gandalf:~ [164]% gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: amd64-undermydesk-freebsd
Configured with: FreeBSD/amd64 system compiler
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.2.1 20070719  [FreeBSD]


Next I will try to build trunk.


Kind regards,
Michael Krauss

But symlinks are always executable.  I don't know what svn does with
them.

There are problems in other bin/* dirs too, except win32 and
x86_64-linux, though I didn't treat the differently.  I do not get the
same error messages than you.  When running svn stat I get:

  L    .
  L    trunk
! L    trunk/Master
! L    trunk/Master/bin

[...]

And svn clenup says:

svn: In directory '.'
svn: Can't copy '.svn/tmp/text-base/dvitype.svn-base' to '.svn/tmp/dvitype.tmp.tmp': Success

There are obviously problems with dvitype (not a symlink) and
bg5+latex.  I already exported the bin dirs from rev 6968 and could
replace the files but my working copy is locked, hence I can't delete
them.  Can you?

There seems to be a problem in the repository. I tried a fresh update
and svn reported:

svn: In directory 'Master/bin/i386-linux'
svn: Can't change perms of file 'Master/bin/i386-linux/ppower4': No
such file or directory

Does the repository use FSFS or Berkeley DB? I suspect that Berkeley
DB is used and it is now in an unstable state after some failure.

No, the symlinks were messed up. I've deleted bin/i386-linux; I'm sure
Reinhard will repopulate it.

You are right. For some strange reason a few minutes ago "svn update"
left my working copy at 6973. Now it updated to 6974, informed that
bin/i386-linux has been deleted (it is also marked in the log) but it
was not removed:

I still have problems.  It seems that I need to delete the whole bin
tree in order to update bin/.svn/ but as long as the broken bin/arch
dirs exist, my working copy will be locked.  It seems that different
versions of svn clients behave differently.

Martin, could you install the old files yourself?  I prepared a
tar.bz2 file which contains the binaries.  See

  http://tug.org/~kotucha/archdirs-2.tar.bz2
  http://tug.org/~kotucha/archdirs-2.tar.bz2.md5

The "-2" in the filename indicates that 2 platforms are missing, win32
and x86_64-linux.  As far as I can see, they don't have to be
replaced.  The tar file is supposed to be extracted in Master/bin.

Can you try?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Good news, trunk has been build successfully.
How can I "install" texlive now?

I have done this, but running any program like pdflatex or texexec
stops because it can't find format file or texmfstart:

[mickraus at gandalf

[mickraus at gandalf

Is there any documentation on the web how to install texlive from
source? The README file in Build/source ends with the build procedure.

I just want to install texlive in one directory, setting some TEX*
variables, adjust PATH and that's it. It don't need to be available
system wide, the old tetex comes along with FreeBSD ports for programs
that need TeX. 


Kind regards,
Michael Krauss

I still have version 1.4.3.

I had to remove manually bin/i386-linux which was not removed from my
working copy when updating to 6974. After that update to 6795 works.

Oh, right, I had to set some environment variables to get things working.

TEXMF="/home/agilis/texlive-branch/branch2007/Master/"
TEXMFCNF="/home/agilis/texlive-branch/branch2007/Master/texmf/web2c"
PATH="/home/agilis/texlive-branch/branch2007/Master/bin/x86_64-freebsd8:...."

I admit I'm not sure exactly how the variables relate to each other
since I never managed to wrap my brain around the tex file heirarchy
and all the path searching knobs.

I looked at the texlive documentation on kpathsea/web2c/environment
variables and hit the problem with a big hammer until kpathsea looked
happy, so I might've set them oddly, but for now it works.

Right -- I patched the TeXLive sources first, as that's where the  
failure was reported, but I have just applied the same patch to the  
XeTeX repository as well, so it should build from either place (I hope).

Thank you, that does the trick.

Meanwhile I figured out how to compile the 2007 branch.
The problem was icu. I had icu-3.8.1_1 installed from ports and the
Build script used it instead of the one coming with texlive. So I
deleted the icu from ports, compiled texlive and reinstalled icu from
ports.


Kind regards,
Michael Krauss

This looks like a classic bsd make on gMakefile error.

Try gmake.

    matrix.tex

Unfortunately, you can't invoke an executable via an absolute path and
have everything magically work.  You have to alter PATH.  (In general;
of course there are some specific things you can do via an absolute
path, but nothing involving subprograms, for sure.)

    I just want to install texlive in one directory, setting some TEX*
    variables, adjust PATH and that's it. 

That is exactly how it is intended to be installed, and how the default
is configure, except there are no TEX* variables to set.  Just prepend
to PATH.

    Is there any documentation on the web how to install texlive from
    source? The README file in Build/source ends with the build procedure.

I'll try to write something more, somewhere.

    TEXMF="/home/agilis/texlive-branch/branch2007/Master/"
    TEXMFCNF="/home/agilis/texlive-branch/branch2007/Master/texmf/web2c"
    PATH="/home/agilis/texlive-branch/branch2007/Master/bin/x86_64-freebsd8:...."

Many bug reports are sent due to incorrect environment variable
settings.  So as an experiment, can you try without the TEXMF and
TEXMFCNF variables?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <a69b10e40803170905k313346f1k9bf3afee39c2386a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was trying to check out a clean copy of the svn trunk so I can do
test builds on new a freebsd amd64 installation when svn checkout
started choking on me...

in Master/bin:
svn: In directory 'i386-freebsd'
svn: Can't change executability of file 'i386-freebsd/bg5+latex': No
such file or directory

On my other tree, svn update worked fine, but it'd choke with the same
error if I move the i386-freebsd/ directory and fetch a fresh one.

it also locks the directory and complains pretty loudly if you try svn
cleanup...

svn: In directory '.'
svn: Can't copy '.svn/tmp/text-base/dvitype.svn-base' to
'.svn/tmp/dvitype.tmp.tmp': Unknown error: 0

I've never seen such an svn error before, so I have no idea what's
going on. it's happened on svn 1.1.4 and 1.1.6 on freebsd and a linux
box.

Thanks for your recent commit to support datarootdir in ncurses.

I'm sorry, but here comes the next one:

Does a standard ICU build support --datarootdir?

I'd be pretty reluctant to interfere with any of the stuff that we  
are importing directly from the ICU repository; that sounds like a  
path to maintenance nightmares. What's in libs/icu-xetex comes  
directly from their repository, with some code patches to support  
extensions that xetex needs, but the build stuff is untouched.

Maybe you can submit a patch to support --datarootdir to the ICU  
project (see <http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/>). If it gets  
integrated there, we'll inherit it in TL next time I merge a new  
release.

Hi.  I've just discovered that, despite the fonts being named as follows:

% pdffonts test.pdf
name                                 type              emb sub uni object ID
------------------------------------ ----------------- --- --- --- ---------
Times-Roman                          Type 1            no  no  no       4  0
Times-Italic                         Type 1            no  no  no       5  0
Times-Bold                           Type 1            no  no  no       6  0
Times-BoldItalic                     Type 1            no  no  no       7  0
Helvetica                            Type 1            no  no  no       8  0
Helvetica-Oblique                    Type 1            no  no  no       9  0
Helvetica-Bold                       Type 1            no  no  no      10  0
Helvetica-BoldOblique                Type 1            no  no  no      11  0

and having font flags used by default by pdflatex, the Acrobat Reader
(8.1.2) does *not* substitute bold, italic or bold-italic/oblique fonts
when a document is displayed; plain Roman is used for all. Is this a bug
in the Reader or are the font flags incorrect?

It's an AR bug. xpdf etc. and gs do the right thing.

Hello,

Karl will probably write a longer mail, but just to let you all know -
TeX User Group has been accepted as a mentoring organisation for
Google Summer of Code
      http://code.google.com/soc/2008/tex/about.html
Huraaaaaaay!

Karl (and all others, esp. Hans, Taco, Norbert, and others that I do
not know personally ...) - thank you *very, very much*.

If anyone would like to work on TeX-related projects during the
summer, and you have some idea (and a mentor if possible), write a
mail to Karl.

Hi Randy,
it seems that I'm the culprit.  I've set the executable flag to all
files in Master/bin but it seems that svn has problems with the
executable flag for symlinks.  However, Martin Schr?der reverted
bin/i386-linux to rev 6968 and Karl Berry fixed the other
directories.

Does it work now?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Metapost: generisize() bug
Message-ID: <47DEE36F.8060107@cs.ucla.edu>

Hi,

TeX Live 2007 appears to introduce a bug in the MetaPost boxes.mp 
"generisize()" function, visible via generic_declare and generic_redeclare. 
Suffixes like "[0]" are no longer accepted.

The following input file demonstrates the bug.

input boxes;
beginfig(1)
    _n_ := "blah[0]";
    generic_declare(pair) _n;
endfig;

The workaround is to use "blah0" instead of "blah[0]", but the bug should be fixed.

Thanks,
Eddie Kohler

Is patching "configure" itself the right way to approach this? I'd  
have expected a patch to configure.in or some other "source" file,  
not the generated script.

I didn't know, that configure was a generated script, since it's already in
the source-package. I don't know much about these auto-configure things and
I just copied the patch from Karl for ncurses (commit 6893).

When I have more time (April), I can investigate further for a better
patch.

Hi,

I hope this is the correct place for reporting that, and I apologize if it
is not.

The pdf documentation for lastpage, namely lastpage.pdf, is not present in
the TL2007 live dvd. The file exists on CTAN, and, according to the ftp
listing, is as old as 07.10.2005. Since the package is under GPL, I don't
since it's a license problem, so I guess it was just forgotten. Btw, it
isn't in the current svn version either.

Is it possible to add it?

Cheers,
Manuel.

The normal way to support --datarootdir would be to use the latest
version of autoconf to generate configure.  Then you get it for free.

In the case of ncurses, I cheated because using the latest autoconf led
to time-consuming and painful complications.  I'd prefer to just delete
ncurses; I expect dialog could easily use system curses libs, I've just
never felt like testing it, partly because I've never used or cared
about dialog in the first place.  If someone out there would like to try
changing dialog to use system curses instead of the one in TL, that
would be great.

Hiroki Sato (hrs at freebsd.org) is working on a port to FreeBSD. See

Aha, it's that simple! :-) OK, I just ran autoconf 2.61 in libs/icu- 
xetex, and checked in the new configure script. It works OK for me  
here, at least.

Let's hope the ICU project also updates their repository, so that we  
don't have to re-do this after the next merge. But at least it seems  
to be a painless process.

Pdfopen does not compile without X11, but I was under the impression
that was handled already (because of lack of previous error reports).

Well, that explains why when I test on various boxes these errors
appear. Since I tend to work on headless servers, pieces of X11
sometimes finds its way into the system as port dependencies, but
oftentimes not.

If you (or anyone) can improve pdfopen's configure to bail out with a
useful error message when X is not present, that would be helpful.
Meanwhile, I added that to the list of prerequisites in source/README.

For those who do not know, Knuth has released an update of his master
sources at ftp://cs.stanford.edu/pub/tex/tex08.tar.gz.  I imagine they
will be on CTAN shortly, if not there already.  It will take some time
to integrate the changes into TeX Live, but we'll certainly do so for
this year's release.

One particular question for the other developers -- if it would cause
trouble to update tex.web and tex.ch now in TL, let me know, and I will
refrain.  E.g., if it would be easier to wait until the new
pdftex/xetex/... are ready for merging into TL.  Otherwise, I'll plan to
do that fairly soon.

I finally had time to get X installed and build things happily so I
could test this, without texmf/texmfcnf and just PATH set, I've built
a file I was working on cleanly. I guess I tried adding the TEXMF
things before I realized I needed to set PATH properly and stopped
messing with things once stuff started working.

Since I don't know up from down about make/config and all that jazz I
won't be able to do this until I learn, which will take quite a bit of
time I imagine. If someone who knows more than 0 about this sort of
thing felt like jumping in, that'd be great. For now, I'll just use it
as motivation to slowly learn things.

OK, I /think/ I understand this part (after 12 hours sleep !);
"tex.poo[l]" is generated at compile time from "tex.web",
"tex.ch", and friends, and as TeX Live isn't a "compile and
run" distribution, there is no provision for different pool
files for different platforms.  I would suggest that as
that is the case, TeX itself simply refer to "<eof>" (I can't
agree with Sebastian's suggestion that fewer than one in
a million will understand that notation), whilst the
various TeX derivatives issue a more user-friendly version
customised for the platform.

Two thoughts /did/ occur to me : rather than Don's somewhat
dangerous "quit" (which could only too easily be a real,
if somewhat perverse, filename), why not require (say)
treat specially the literal strings "^D" and "^Z", "^"
being a fairly well-accepted convention for "Ctrl"
in the first place; alternatively, wny not overload
"\endinput" for this purpose, macro expansion apparently
not taking place when the file name is read from the
prompt (see the following transcript, where file
"1.tex" exists but "2.tex" does not) :

cmlgc is a single-size font, so is (may just about be) appropriate for
rather low-quality typesetting only.  in its favour is that it also has
greek and cyrillic alphabet glyphs (and it's -- relatively -- small).

with the present setup, you need latin modern, and the rather large cb
and lh fontsets to get coverage for all three alphabets.  personally, i
think that's preferable.

Akira has already sent me changes for this, plus compile in the pool
file.  Unfortunately the pool file changes didn't work with
srcdir!=builddir, and it's not easy to separate the two sets of changes.
I'm working on it.  Sorry.

1. I committed Akira's changes for updating omega and aleph to the new

   make it work when srcdir!=builddir.)  Thanks Akira.

2. XeTeX still does not build, however, Build --without-xetex goes

3. I updated the etex change files since xetex (and others?) use them,
   even though we don't build etex itself any more.

Hope we're back to a better state now ...

Subject: [tex-live] xindy now in build
Message-ID: <200803250020.m2P0KuM23215@tug.org>

Thanks to a lot of hard work by Vladimir, the xindy program
(http://xindy.org, http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/indexing/xindy/), a
modern alternative to makeindex, is now included in TeX Live.

For those building TL, this means you now need to install GNU clisp
and GNU libffcall.  Or else configure --without-xindy.

I wrote the procedure that worked for me (to get an xindy binary; I
haven't actually tested xindy) to install clisp and ffcall in
source/utils/README, and I'll include it here:

  xindy requires GNU clisp and GNU libffcall.  If you can find
  prepackaged versions for your system, go ahead and use them; their
  precise version shouldn't matter.
  
  If you need or want to compile them from source, here is what karl did
  on i386-linux -- but install the latest GNU libtool first:

wget http://www.haible.de/bruno/gnu/ffcall-1.10.tar.gz
tar xf ffcall-1.10.tar.gz && cd ffcall-1.10
configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu --enable-shared \
&& make && make install  # as usual

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/clisp/latest/clisp-2.44.1.tar.gz
tar xf clisp-2.44.1.tar.gz && cd clisp-2.44.1
configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnu --ignore-absence-of-libsigsegv \
  --with-libffcall-prefix=/usr/local/gnu \
&& cd src && make && make install

  Of course, adjust paths as desired.

  clisp complains about my stack size being too small and I should run
  ulimit, but I ignored that.  (If you actually care about clisp per se,
  you should probably also install GNU libsigsegv; I didn't.)

I use the latest ConTeXt/pdfTeX/metapost and it works fine here. The
only "patch" that can be suggested is to update to the latest ConTeXt
(if you use XeTeX, you need to update Latin Modern fonts as well),
possibly by extracting cont-tmf.zip from PRAGMA to $TEXMFHOME or
$TEXMFLOCAL and remaking the formats. If that was a metapost bug, then
you also need to update metapost binary.

If you need any further instructions, write on the ConTeXt mailing list.
(TeX Live is only updated once yearly, so no chances to fix that in
TeX Live 2007, and TeX Live 2008 will have another ConTeXt version
anyway :-)

Thanks.
For the record: In SUSE 10.3 it's in postgresql-libs and postgresql-libs-32bit.

I notice that the xindy build requires a working pdflatex. This makes
bootstrapping TL a bit more complicated...

pdflatex is used to rebuild the documentation file alphabets-doc.pdf.

there's an option --disable-docs which disables docs regeneration.

But, xindy requires latex for building make-rules modules.

Perhaps, for TeX Live build (TETEX_BUILD) we could disable make-rules
rebuilding (--disable-make-rules), because they're going to be installed
manually into the texmf source anyway? Karl, wdyt?

or maybe the Build script should supply the --disable-make-rules option
by default, and allow to enable it to get the modules built for
installation into the texmf tree.

I tried building ffcall-1.10 but "make check" terminates with an  
"Illegal instruction" while working in trampoline_r, which doesn't  
inspire confidence. This was on i686-apple-darwin, which is not  
listed in the supported platforms -- not surprising, as it didn't  
exist when ffcall was released. (It does complete without error on  
powerpc-apple-darwin.)

Anyone know the status of ffcall? From what I can find online, it  
doesn't look as though this is being actively maintained. Suggestions?

BTW, these options are already there, i.e. if you run
Build --disable-docs --disable-make-rules
it will not require latex or pdflatex.

the question is whether we should just document usage of these options
for TL builders or force these options for a TeX Live build (but somehow
e.g. Karl will need to enable them to install the generated files into
texmf tree).

it's not xindy, it comes from your OS-supplied clisp package.

if there's a clisp-dev package for your OS, install it, and if the
dependencies are properly specified, it should supposedly install also
libpq-dev.

or manually install libpq-dev, just during xindy build (you may
uninstall it afterwards).

or build clisp from source, and it will not require libpq if it will not
be found during build.

Also, see the texlive/source/utils/xindy/README-clisp for some
additional hints for building clisp.

ffcall at http://www.haible.de/bruno/packages-ffcall-README.html
seems to be more outdated than the one which was included into
clisp-2.43 (the last version of clisp prior to unbundling ffcall from clisp).

so please try to get ffcall from

http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/clisp/release/2.43/clisp-2.43.tar.gz

or from Debian's patched sources which seems to be even more recent:

http://packages.debian.org/sid/libffcall1

(see download links for sources and patches on the right side of the
page).

Thanks for this effort, it is greatly anticipated.

One should note that there are several reports that xindy does not 
compile on x86_64 Linux and FreeBSD systems. Others were 
successful. We don't know yet the root cause -- those with systems 
where it works could not reconstruct the erroneous cases.

Also, it does not compile on OS X; that's partly because ffcall may 
be not there (Jonathan's problem) or because clisp installation has 
errors (clisp-link-kit missing an x bit or so).

Upstream (that's mainly me and J?rg Sommer :-) will not repair 
these problems. Instead, I'm rewriting the module that needs ffcall 
and clisp-link-kit to remove that dependency, and thus resolve that 
issue once and for all. (CLISP itself will still be needed, but in 
a standard installation, without the capability to compile external 
modules outside the source tree.)

Cheers,

Message-ID: <20080325145626.GA18751@polya.uklinux.net>

Hi wonderful people!

I've been noticing that the CTAN team is wisely becoming reluctant to
install typeset versions of the dtx files, since they have a habit of
becoming outdated.  This makes a lot of sense.  However, I am now
hitting a new snag: when I want documentation on some packages when
using the Debian 2007 (testing) texlive packages, it seems that I have
to go to CTAN to download the documentation or dtx files.  I don't
know whether this is because I simply haven't found the documentation
on my system or whether it's not been built.  One example that I've
recently had was the changebar package.

I wonder whether it's feasible to automatically build the
documentation into the appropriate texlive packages?

BTW, i fixed the build scripts in the texlive's xindy sources to not
require the x bit on clisp-link, and also to automatically detect the
CLISP_LIB location (where the clisp-link and other linkkit things are
located) by querying the clisp binary, reducing the number of
configure options from 3 (--enable-external-clisp,
--enable-clisp-path, --enable-clisp-dir) to just one:
--with-clisp[=PATH], and even that option is not needed if clisp is
found in PATH.

hopefully this will simplify installations, as users will not need to
worry about supplying the correct clisp-dir, or the "x" bit on
clisp-link.

also: original xindy was building clisp-2.43 from source (which was
included into xindy's source tarball). it was not doing anything
special, but still was requiring a working FFI. I.e. it was just
building pristine clisp-2.43 sources, configuring clisp with
--with-dynamic-ffi --ignore-absence-of-libsigsegv, and then building
the ordrules module *exactly* the same way as it is done with external
clisp.

therefore, including clisp sources into xindy does not buy any
portability or simplification compared to unbundled clisp. on the
contrary, with unbundled clisp users have more choices - use the
OS-supplied or 3rd-party binaries, or build whatever version of clisp
works for them, and then link with that version.

the --with-clisp[=PATH] option allows using non-installed clisp,
i.e. clisp which was built in any clisp source directory without
running "make install".

Best,
v.

configure in texlive tests for presence of dynamic ffi, and shows a
proper error if it is not found. in which case user can build the same
clisp-2.43 or any other version from source and supply the
--with-clisp=PATH option. this reduces the size of xindy source
distribution by 48 Mb, and in fact gives users more choice.

[For the list: FFI means `foreign function interface' and is the
method to include a C `plugin' object in a CLISP executable. That
method is used to provide one such plugin, named ordrules.]

Yes, I do so because building external modules with dynamic ffi does
not work in many binary CLISP installations. Some of them don't come
with dynamic ffi at all, for a starter. Therefore I went the safe
route and included CLISP completely.

But, as I wrote, this will be mood in the future.

um, what?  we tend to go out of our way to get documentation that can be
read on-line.  true, we have switched to pdf form (since dvi makes
assumptions that aren't necessarily true of all machines), but i've
created a lot of pdf files for packages whose author hadn't done the
job.

it's not actually difficult to keep these things up-to-date, of course,
since we are in control when updates arrive.

there _is_ a changebar.pdf in texlive.  i don't actually know if the
texlive team build them specially, but since there's one on ctan, they
don't actually need to.

i suspect you're observing the typical "documentation takes up space"
whinge of the packager: debian probably has a separate documentation
.deb file, which doesn't get installed by default.  (iirc, there's
separate rpms for fedora texlive, for example.)

good it worked at least after setting clisp-link executable, though my
builds succeed even if it is not executable.

i'd be grateful if you could provide me the build log which shows the

My apologies.  It's my broken memory - I recall uploading a package a
while back and being told that the .pdf files are no longer being
installed on CTAN.  I may well be mistaken.

Erm, no, I'm just having one of those bad days when nothing seems to
do what I think it will.  I *do* indeed have changebar.pdf on my
system.

Sorry for the noise :/

    there _is_ a changebar.pdf in texlive.  i don't actually know if the
    texlive team build them specially, but since there's one on ctan, they

In general (and specifically in the case of changebar.pdf), TL copies
the pdf's from CTAN, with much gratitude that they exist to be copied.

In the past, the ctan-to-tl process attempted to (re)build
documentation, with much consequent pain.  It was necessary in its time
(Sebastian set it up), but it was with much relief that I disabled it a
year or two ago.

Message-ID: <200803260035.m2Q0ZuZ32074@f7.net>

1. I fear we should disable xindy by default just now.  Sorry, Vladimir.
   There are too many configuration problems, and there is too much else
   going on (luatex, knuth) just now.  We should be able to get some
   xindy binaries into the distribution in the end, but I think the
   current build is going to fail for just about everyone, one way or
   another.  So let's let the people who can experiment with it enable it.

2. My own build process that I reported yesterday was insufficient.  The
   binary ended up getting dynamically linked with libavcall and
   libcallback, which would make it useless to distribute.  The final
   link line was:

gcc -g -O2 -Igllib -W ... -ldl /usr/local/gnu/lib/libavcall.so
-Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/gnu/lib /usr/local/gnu/lib/libcallback.so -o lisp.run

   What finally got a working binary for me was to replace the .so's
   with .a's.  (The libffcall build could create both.)  Whether the
   resulting binary actually works (beyond starting up), I don't know.
   I haven't updated my notes in source/utils/README yet.
   
   Anyway, obviously manually modifying link lines is a nonstarter in
   terms of a usable build process.  So somehow that has to be changed.
   But I don't know how, since the command is generated by clisp-link.
   I don't think we can even get the command without running it and then
   sed it or something ...

3. libffcall was fairly recently made a GNU package, so it is not
   completely moribund, in the sense that at least the authors cared
   about it enough to request that.  Bruno Haible and Sam Steingold are
   the maintainers (same as clisp).  We could write them about these
   problems and patches, but I suspect fixing things on nonfree systems
   is not going to be a priority for them.  Certainly can't count on it
   happening for our release.

4. Regarding the fancy configure options, I think the right thing to do
   is make it happen inside xindy's configure, by default, given
   our --enable-tetex-build.  I don't really want to add a ton of
   package-specific options to Build.

Maybe the best thing to do is wait for Joachim's new version?

    or manually install libpq-dev, just during xindy build (you may
    uninstall it afterwards).

Will it still end up dynamically linking the xindy executable against
postgres libs?  If so, that's a killer ...

FYI; this time I have rather stringent plans: At TUG 2008 in Cork, I
want to give a talk about xindy. The submission deadline is End of
April, and I will have to write the new code until then. (I have to
assure that my talk topics really work. :-)

That new code must be included in the distribution then, and autoconf
must be updated; but maybe you and J?rg can give me a hand for this.
(I'm not very knowledgable about autoconf.) Therefore, a realistic
timeline is probably sometimes in May.

Best,
	Joachim

I'm afraid this seems broken, at least for me.... Build runs into

and lots more like this. Looks like a makefile is missing some

That was on Mac OS X (10.4.11). I tried it on Linux (Ubuntu Gutsy)  
and it build OK... weird. On looking into the Makefile, I think it  
should have an additional -I$(srcdir)/.. in the rule that compiles mf- 
pool.c. I've added this in TL and it now builds on OS X as well.

(I'm still not really sure why the difference. To me, it looks like  
all platforms ought to need the extra include path, but I don't  
really understand all the rules.)

I am glad to say that I can not reproduce the error concerning the x-bit
to be set on /usr/lib/clisp//clisp-link anymoore, using the sources from
the svn-server. I unset the x-right on that script, and xindy is build

Thank you for your help and the work you do for us.

you can retrieve just xindy with

By the way, thank you (and all the CTAN team) for this. I think it's very
useful that the doc be readable on-line and on all platforms.

Following this idea, I believe the doc should also be easily accessible
locally when it is present. For this, texdoc is a great help, but sometimes it
doesn't find the doc, since it cannot guess the name (eg, amsldoc.pdf,
pgfmanual.pdf, beameruseguide.pdf). I noticed the name is usually given in the
corresponding TeX catalogue page (thanks again to the CTAN team, I suppose),
and I wonder if it would be possible to make texdoc check that field of the
catalogue (or a documentation names database extracted from it) in order to
find and display the doc ?

I don't know if the change should be made in texdoc, or the packaging, or
whatever, so maybe this suggestion is a bit off-topic there, maybe not.

Well, I just looked and it appears that in Etch (TL2005) the file
changebar.pdf.gz was in texlive-latex-extra, but now changebar.pdf is in the
new package texlive-latex-extra-doc.

Well, that's a considerably shorter list than Karl's, at least. But I  
wonder whether the omission of things like libpcre means that the  
resulting version of xindy will be missing certain features/ 
capabilities. Or does it mean those libs were statically linked?

xindy compilation (or, more precisely, linking) is quite a complication.

The list of shared libraries is dependent on your CLISP 
installation, not on xindy. With Vladimir's configuration, the 
locally installed CLISP is taken, a plugin for that CLISP is 
compiled, and it's then linked into a new executable that has the 
distribution's system and the additional plugin. Thus, xindy.run 
needs all shared libs that lisp.run (the CLISP executable) needs as 
well.

Depending on the distributor's choice of configuration and 
compilation options, lisp.run from the distribution's system has a 
wide variety of options compiled in -- well, or it hasn't. That's 
why Martins executable from openSUSE has so many shared libs -- the 
SUSE folks tend to compile in everything that's available under 
this sun. (This is no slight against them, I run SUSE myself.) 
Whereas other folks choose to package much less options in their 
distribution's executables. That's the case in your installations. 
Some go so far (e.g., HP-UX, last time I looked) that support of 
external plugins is not packaged, or disabled.

yes, making xindy with OS-supplied clisp is acceptable for local build
but not acceptable for build which will be distributed in TeX Live,
because of shared library dependencies.

but there is a nice solution: first build clisp from source, with static
libffcall (and libsigsegv), and then build xindy for TeX Live using that
clisp (it supports the --with-clisp=PATH configure option so one can use
a clisp built from source, even without installing that clisp).

i'll send build instructions which allow to accomplish this later.

okay, here are sample build instructions which work for me (TM):

cd $clisp_builddir
make
==============================================

Please try it. It builds static libsigsegv and libffcall, and links
clisp against them.

The reason to build even libsigsegv is to ensure that clisp will not
find and link to an OS-supplies libsigsegv.

The resulting clisp binary doesn't have unwanted shared library
dependencies:

$ ldd ./lisp.run 
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffe49fe000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00002b2cc634b000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00002b2cc654f000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002b2cc612e000)
$ ldd ./clisp
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff8d7fe000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00002b111d559000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00002b111d75d000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002b111d33c000)

The trick is to export CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS before configuing clisp, -
that's probably why it did not work for you. It looks like a bug in
clisp's configure scripts, that it doesn't do that automatically when
passed with --with-libsigsegv-prefix and --with-libffcall-prefix
options.

Running "make install" for clisp is *not necessary*.

The next step is to build xindy, by passing a configure option

  --with-clisp=$clisp_builddir/clisp

(either to xindy's configure if you're building just xindy, or to the
Build script if you're building the whole TeX Live).

once xindy is built here, i get these shared libs on lisp.run:

$ ldd ./lisp.run 
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffff9ffe000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x00002b1db0e55000)
	libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x00002b1db10d8000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00002b1db1310000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00002b1db1515000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002b1db0c38000)

    Well, that's a considerably shorter list than Karl's, at least. But I  

Martin's, actually.  Mine was shorter :).

We obviously can't usefully distribute binaries that dynamically link
against such things as libsigsegv.  It probably means building clisp
from source is a practical requirement to avoid all that stuff.

Vladimir and I are discussing it.

    resulting version of xindy will be missing certain features/ 
    capabilities. Or does it mean those libs were statically linked?

I suspect they got pulled in because of the distro's clisp, not because
of xindy.  Obviously xindy does not use postgres, for example.

Anyway, for now, Build --disable-xindy is your friend.

Well, I thought a bit about that: indeed this is not trivial. I think that
certainly the best solution is to have a sort of documentation database built
with the catalogue, because it will certainly be difficult to extract the
information from the HTML file on the fly in texlua (and not very effective).
I'm quite motivated to have a closer look at this, though I'm not sure if my

I just noticed the new version in texlua is the version I've been using for a
few time (in Debian testing). That's a great job, since I guess it will
greatly improve the portability and simplify maintenance (as far as I
understand, there was no Windows version of texdoc before).

Subject: [tex-live] I'd like to help !
Message-ID: <47EC1301.9050205@elzevir.fr>

Hi,

First of all, I take the occasion to thank all the TeX Live team for its work,
since I've been using TeX Live for a few time, and it's just great. I
discovered the TeX world since only a few years, but now it has become sort of
part of may life, and I'd like to get more involved and help with the
development and maintenance.

(Maybe I should introduce myself a bit: I'm a French PhD student in pure
maths. I rapidly became fond of TeX and LaTeX, spending quite much time
discussing about it in fr.comp.text.tex. I also make some training courses on
LaTeX to other PhD students in my university, and recently wrote 2 and a half
LaTeX packages. Since I really can't keep doing (good) math for more than few
hours a day, I have spare time I like to spend (or part of it) TeXing around,
and why, not, helping in TeX live...)

I read the 'contribute' and 'pkgupdate' pages on tug.org/texlive, and I think
I could help on updating the packages from the CTAN, adding packages to the
automated system, and so on, if volunteers for theses tasks are still needing.
I would also like to help about documentation in general (esp. making it as
easily accessible as possible), as far as I can.

So if you think you could use my help, it would be a pleasure for me.

Best,
Manuel.

it's not (quite) as bad as that: the html (as is the way) has a poor
structure, but all the information is in xml, from which the html is
generated.

this is better news only in the sense that deriving the database you're
imagining isn't going to be (quite) as bad as you might think.

It's sometimes important to store not only the file name but also its
location. For instance, several manuals have the name
manual.{dvi,ps,pdf}. If I type "texdoc manual" in TL 2007, a
manual.dvi (written in Bengali) is displayed. If I know that I want
the manual for Velthuis Devanagari, I can type "texdoc
velthuis/manual" and I get manual.pdf from the doc/generic/velthuis
directory.

Well, that's what I was hoping, actually, since the html files are generated,
one can think that the source files are more easy to use. Unfortunately, I
couldn't look to the source files, since the only link I found to them (from
http://tug.org/texlive/pkgupdate.html, pointing to
http://dante.ctan.org/svnroot/texcatalogue/trunk)
requires authentication.

Indeed. There was also the same problem with hyperref's manual for a moment.
Often one needs using 'texdoc -s' or even 'locate' to find the doc for the
first time, and then remember the good keywords to have texdoc find it next
time. Automating this, either using a documentation database, or coding some
good heuristic for texdoc, could be a relief for the user.

By the way, the same kind of problem happens to me when I type 'texdoc live':
I get the TeX Live manual, right, but in Chinese. So I think another
interesting thing to add to the documentation database possibly extracted from
the catalogue sources would be a language field of any kind, that texdoc could
use.

It probably depends on a lot of unpredictable things. I get it in
Russian. Bu what I wrote about manual.dvi in Bengali and
velthuis/manual.pdf, these two files are manuals for two different
packages, not just a language version.

Sure. There's far to many documentations named (manual|user).(pdf|ps|dvi) out
there. What I meant, and was maybe not clear, is that one could imagine two
kinds of improvements:
1. Be able to find the documentation for the right package, even when its name
is too "generic".
2. When a package has documentation in many languages (eg, live.pdg,
scrguide.pdf/scrguien.pdf), an additional level of refinement could be to find
all languages and automatically display the one in the user preferred
language. (I noticed the TeX Catalogue pages often link to documentation in
all available languages.)

Of course my point 2 is distinct of your point, but your remark about the
language remembered me of that.

Manuel.

I understand. Selecting a proper language may also be a problem. For
instance, I do not like Czech GUI, so my system locale is English but
live.pdf is also available in the mixture of Czech and Slovak which
may be preferable for me

Hmm, one could imagine a configuration file (or environment variable, or a
entry in an existing TeX-related configuration file) where the user can
specify an ordered list of preferred languages, defaulting to the system
locale (or a default list) if empty (I don't know how the notion of system
locale is implemented in Windows systems...). I guess the hard part would
rather be to get the database with correct entries for the languages...

Yes, that's a good idea, just as you configure the list of languages
in a web browser.

Karl,

I am preparing a grant proposals that has to go thur grants.gov
and I am trying to do it with pdftex since some of figures come by a
route that missed postscript going into Type1 pdf direct.

But I can't figure out how to include them.  \special doesn't work for
me, and I don't know why.  The latest install July 2007 was TEX Live
2007.

Can someone tell me how to do something as simple as 

\vbox{\hbox(with fig.pdf) \hbox{figure caption}.
of
\hbox{\vbox(with fig.pdf) \vbox{figure caption}.
 
that will run under pdftex.

I will be eternally grateful.

I feel like an idiot.  I have always been able to do stuff on my own
before.  I must be too old and gone soft in the head.

Thanks.

Cheers, John

P.S. I don't have to resize the pdf figures. I know how to make each
the right size initially in pdf and, of course, I convert the eps one
with epstopdf.  That works fine until I try to include pdf figure.

Or you haven't found the pdftex manual. Try:

  texdoc pdftex-l

(assuming you want it formatted for letter paper).

\special is used to instruct dvi driver (e.g. dvips) to include the
image when processing the dvi file. If you create pdf directly by
pdftex, you have to use new primitives that are mapped to the pdf
command. I suppose that youo use plain TeX. If you do not need
rescaling, the following will work:

\pdfximage page <number> {fig.pdf}\pdfrefximage \pdflastximage

page <number> specifies which page from fig.pdf should be inserted. If
omitted, the first page is insrted.

LaTeX users can make use of the graphicx package and even omit the
file extension because the driver (dvips, pdftex) is often recognized
automatically. Thus \includegraphics{fig} will include fig.eps with
dvips and fig.pdf with pdftex. Of course, if fig.pdf contains several
pages and you need the third page, you can use
\includegraphics[page=3]{fig.pdf}

Hi Manuel,

First, thanks for volunteering to help.

Now, about documentation information -- please look at
Master/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.  It already has all the documentation files
in TL, along with the "details" of the Catalogue XML entries, including
language information in a few cases.  We wouldn't want to have a
separate "documentation database"; if there are insufficiencies, they
should be dealt with in tlpdb.

You can't browse texlive.tlpdb on the web (it's too intensive to give to
all the robots [and robots.txt is not sufficient]).  You'll have to get
via svn or rsync or whatever, as outlined on the tug.org/texlive/svn
page.

When it comes time to actually program anything about texdoc, it would
be highly desirable to start with Frank's Lua version.

Also, I should mention texdoctk already has a "database" file
(texdoctk.dat) which has the info about many packages.  I am not sure if
it has anything the Catalogue doesn't.

I'll write you later about other things.

Thanks again,
Karl

I just looked at it. It looks great. Seems to contain lot of information. By
the way, when I was talking about a "documentation database", I didn't think
of something really independent, but rather a file automatically derived from
something like the catalogue sources or tlpdb, just for convenience: I don't
know if scanning a 96000 lines long file at each texdoc run would be very
effective.

Thanks for the info. I'll look at it too.

Others have suggested reading the pdftex manual.  In the interest of
covering all the options, there are two other ways to proceed:

1) you _can_ get EPS from PDF.  The easy way to handle this is with
Siep Kroonenberg's epspdf <http://tex.aanhet.net/epspdf/>, which
wraps ghostscript and some pdftops (from xpdf) in ruby scripts.
Adobe Illustrator CS can open pdf files and save to variety of
formats.

2)   LaTeX provides wrappers that mask the new mechanisms.   These
can be made to work with eplain
<http://www.tug.org/docs/html/eplain/Packages-known-to-work.html>,
perhaps with the aid of miniltx.

Hello,

After updating to latest HEAD, here are the last configure scripts, that
need to be patched to get --datarootdir=... running successfully:

- libs/obsdcompat/configure

Message-ID: <200803302153.m2ULrbm25212@f7.net>

The Aleph team has declared that Aleph development has been halted for
some time; efforts are concentrated on luatex now.  Therefore they
recommend that TeX Live simply make the "aleph" executable a link to
luatex.  So I plan to implement that recommendation.

If this is going to cause insuperable problems for anyone, tell the
Aleph folks so they can convince you otherwise :).

BTW, there is no plan to remove or significantly change Omega;
essentially the same binary and support for Omega will be present as in
past years.  We (notably Akira) have already integrated the updates from
Knuth's "2008 tune-up".

Best,
Karl

It seems self-evident to me that it is up to the Aleph maintainers what
to do with their own program.  I'm just the one implementing a
recommendation.

No one seems to know how many actual Aleph users there are at this
point-- you are the only one known.  That's part of why I broadcast the
email.  

I don't have strong feelings about it myself, although it's always nice
to save space and simplify things.  It's no problem to continue to
include the separate binary; the work is already done.  We can make the
binary available even if we don't include it on the DVD.

P.S. It is extra work for me to read your HTML-only messages.  Any
chance of making your mailer at least multipart/alternative?

In that case - wouldn't it be better to remove bugs from Omega by
backporting code from Aleph? (or even vice versa - make omega a
symlink for aleph - I don't really know how compatible the two engines
are)

PS: I don't have any strong opinion either, but it would make more
sense to have one good engine (even if obsolete) than to have several
of them, none of which really does what users expect.

I strongly disagree, at least at the current point. I am myself using  
Aleph as an alternative to Omega (Aleph has less bugs), and luatex  
DOES NOT produce the same results. It still hangs with complex LaTeX  
files. I suggest you do that symlink only once we are sure that we get  
the same results and that every file which compiles with Aleph/Omega  
also compiles with luatex.

Maybe what luatex does is enough for the "aleph guys", but this is not  
a reason to remove it from the distribution and replace it with  
something not compatible. You should rather care for people that  
actually use aleph and do not want their files to be broken because  
some (smart) guy said "luatex does the same thing we don't need aleph  
anymore". I'm not asking for any evolution of aleph, just leave it  
where it is and as it is. Or let people choose whether they want the  
real thing or the symlink.

cheers

Unless you file a bug report, this situation is unlikely to change soon,
I assume you are aware of that?

Odd, the immediately preceding message from Y. Ch. was
rendered in plain text by Seamonkey 1.1, and had an

Yes. It is a matter of time and energy: my files are so complex that I  
can hardly send you all auxiliary files, I have to bring the bug down  
to a minimal case, and that takes time. But I  will do it!

Are you sure?  If I don't patch it, I get the following error with the
command "../configure --datarootdir=/tmp/prefix --prefix=/tmp/prefix":

=== configuring in lcdf-typetools (/tmp/texlive-work/Build/source/work/texk/lcdf-typetools)
configure: running /bin/sh ../../../texk/lcdf-typetools/configure '--prefix=/tmp/prefix'  '--datarootdir=/tmp/prefix' '--enable-tetex-build' '--bindir=${exec_prefix}/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' '--libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' --cache-file=/dev/null --srcdir=../../../texk/lcdf-typetools

Try `../../../texk/lcdf-typetools/configure --help' for more information.
