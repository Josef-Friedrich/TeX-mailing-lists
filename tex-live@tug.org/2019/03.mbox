Hello all - the tlpretest area is populated with the first build for
TL'19. Most binaries have been updated, though not all (in particular,
asy is in flux). The TL manual has not been updated yet. Feel free to
give it a try if you're up for it.
http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

(BTW, one of the mirrors (hmc.edu) is currently MIA; I've asked its admin.)

Good luck to us all,
Karl

Please also try with "-gui tcl", like for example:
    ./install-tl -gui tcl -repository http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/
(or any other mirror location, but only one other is working at the moment)

Karl, this option doesn't seem to be documented yet on
    http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html#installing

1. "install-tl -gui wizard" and "install-tl -gui perltk" both say "TeX
   Live install 2019" (or something like that) but, on the rotated image
   on the left, it is still written "TeX Live 2018".
2. For an advanced and custom installation, the wizard suggests "-gui
   expert" option but, on the web page, the corresponding option is
   "-gui perltk". IMHO, "perltk" doesn't make sense and "expert" is more
   meaningful.

If cygwin is not updated yet that's OK, I can wait, but I thought I'd

Like in the last three years I get on my laptap a warning that no
gpg is available. 

Tring to install it from Norbert's site with 

C:>tlmgr --repository http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/ install
texlive.gpg.win32

gives:

tlmgr.pl: The TeX Live versions supported by the repository
http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/

do not include the version of the local installation
  (2019).

Has the location/the requirements changed here or should I simply
wait a bit?

Could be done, or updated with a regular texlive.infra update.

But I agree. I will update the expiry so that it lasts 14 month (till
5/2020) which should cover the lifetime of TL19.

Thanks for the reminder

After I got the name of the package right (tlgpg and not
texlive.gpg.win32) it installed fine. I can only check if it works
with tomorrows updates.

Thanks for the report. Done in r50185.
It seems a mistake introduced on 2018-09-01, when a new primitive
\readpapersize was introduced.

Subject: pretest: error with tlmgr and lz4 backups
Message-ID: <20190301152211.7d260ea3@hordevm>

Hi,

I installed TL via install-tl some 12 hours ago and now ran `tlmgr
update --self --all` for a first time. I'm impressed about 68 updates
per just half a day (-: , and I got an error message for each updated
package:



/path/to/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr: Couldn't
compress /path/to/texlive/2019/tlpkg/backups/velthuis.r47198.tar
[64/68, 06:06/06:24] update: velthuis [5007k] (47198 -> 50169) ... done
Incorrect parameters Usage :
      lz4 [arg] [input] [output]

input   : a filename
          with no FILE, or when FILE is - or stdin, read standard input
Arguments :
 -1     : Fast compression (default) 
 -9     : High compression 
 -d     : decompression (default for .lz4 extension)
 -z     : force compression
 -f     : overwrite output without prompting 
 -h/-H  : display help/long help and exit



and so on. I'm on x86_64-linux (Debian Stretch) with lz4 installed from
the official liblz4-tool package (version "0.0~r131-2+b1", man page
dated 2015-03-21).

In fact, the backup directory contains all the backup tarballs, but
uncompressed, since the command line to lz4 is wrong.

Seemingly, the "--rm" flag (used in tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm) is a
rather recent addition to the CLI of lz4. It is too new to be understood
by Debian stable's lz4 binary. Probably other platforms are affected by
this, too (at least, the versions on FreeBSD 10.3 and Archlinux are
recent enough to accept --rm).

Possible workarounds:
  * If an lz4 binary is provided by the system, learn about its
    capabilities (by version number, or a test run, or a platform
    whitelist/blacklist). In case of doubt, prioritise TL's own lz4
    over it, or switch to another compression algorithm (or no
    compression at all)
  * Always use TL's lz4 binary, regardless of what the OS provides
  * Don't rely on a working --rm, and delete the uncompressed backup
    tarball by a separate step after compression
  * some clever solution that didn't come to my mind.

Best,
Johannes

Hi Denis,

    2. For an advanced and custom installation, the wizard suggests "-gui
       expert" option but, on the web page, the corresponding option is
       "-gui perltk".

Ok, changed. Thanks. -k

    Karl, this option doesn't seem to be documented yet on
        http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html#installing

Ok, I added it. Siep, let me know if you want a different description,
and I'll add it to the install-tl doc too. --thanks, karl.

Yes. Thanks! Of course, the first iteration (infra update) still posed
the error, but the subsequent updates went fine, backups are in .tar.lz4
format.

A minor comment to the patch: Are we confident that unconditionally
deleting the uncompressed tarball doesn't hurt in any case? Or should
we rather test for the existence of the compressed file, too, i. e.:

For more than a decade the TeX Live binaries for Windows are provided
by Akira.

Yes I know. That wasn't what I meant. Sorry that my question was
unclear. I wanted to know if there will be an installer for the
64bit versions.

Immediately after this there is the code
	  # compute the size.
	  if (! -r "$destdir/$containername") {
	    tlwarn ("$0: Couldn't find $destdir/$containername\n");
	    return (0, 0, "");
	  }
so a missing compressed file will be detected.

What would not unlinking help in this case? The .tar file would remain
in the backup directory, but tlmgr does not recognizes it for restore
purposes. Users would need to manually restore from the tar.

Furthermore, we already check for the exit code of the compressor
program, so while I see the chance that something strange happens, I
don't think leaving .tar files around would be helpful in these rare
cases.

Best

Hrm, I'm not entirely convinced. Of course those are (hopefully) rare
events (and nobody should need backups anyway). But, in case compression
failed (ll. 735ff), a mere CLI warning is displayed and the backups get
silently deleted.
Though the plain tars are of no use to tlmgr, they could at least be
more helpful than no backups at all (in case of disaster/human
interaction).
But I'm also fine with the current state, i. e. relying that our few
compressors be well-behaved in all relevant cases now.

Message-ID: <CALBOmsY+=q+mZjTHuQkt+0fMyQKV6xMtyk4qdgb4yAn4TcWgeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What do you think about making "-gui tcl" the default option for
installer, at least on the Mac? Windows is already using GUI by
default.

With Perl/Tk this would have been a bit of a problem due to strange
dependencies, but on the Mac Tcl/Tk comes with the OS. I'm not exactly
sure what's the earliest version that would properly support it, but I
tested in on 10.6 (the oldest one currently supported with binaries)
and it seems to work fine there.

(Of course one would need to make sure that there is some display
attached, so that the gui doesn't fire up when working via ssh.)

Mojca

I concur. Running 

sudo ./install-tl -gui

produces warnings about Tk missing in Perl, whereas

sudo ./install-tl -gui tcl

works out of the box.

But for anything but OS X and Windows the default will still be the
text-mode installer?

Sorry, I misunderstood your question.

There will be no support for 64 bit binaries this year.  It's just too
late to adapt all the scripts and to test them thoroughly.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
I recommend to install, as you know,

CTAN/systems/win32/w32tex/TLW64/tl-win64.zip

by reading

CTAN/systems/win32/w32tex/TLW64/00README.TLW64

after the installation of TeX Live windows,
if Windows OS is 64-bit.

Thanks,
Akira

That's no problem at all, I really only wanted to know if I should
wait or install manually (as I did already last year and it worked
fine).

Here's what i observed during install of pretest on Win7. I wonder if it
could be related:

- I ran install-tl-advanced.bat as administrator from a local copy of
  the pretest repository.

- Installation ran through smoothly. I also saw the post-install
  actions. But in the very end I didn't see the usual welcome message.
  Instead the tk window froze (no response) and in the parallel running
  command window some text lines were flickering rapidly up and down
  (looked like a severe crash).

- This didn't stop until I killed it with Ctrl-C.

- The TL installation works fine and seems to be sound, though.

The problem seems to have been the

 download standard fonts (dvips)

configuration in updmap.cfg. The ps file was referencing
Palatino-Roman rather than URWPalladioL-Roma.

Hi

Fwiw I have had that message with TL2018 for a long time

I mostly use dvipdfmx, but recently I started experimenting
with PsTricks hence latex+dvips+ps2pdf and I systematically
get that.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pst-plot}

\begin{document}

\begin{pspicture}(-3,-7)(3,6)
  \psgrid[subgriddiv=1,gridlabels=0,gridwidth=0.4pt](-3,-5)(3,5)
\end{pspicture}

\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{document}

(using TL 2018 fully updated, binaries self-compiled on Mac OS X 10.9.5)

gives on ps2pdf step

DEBUG: FC_WEIGHT didn't match

Notice that above contains no character glyph in output

$ gs --help
GPL Ghostscript 9.23 (2018-03-21)
Copyright (C) 2018 Artifex Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.

My gs is in /opt/local/bin, it is I think a MacPorts install

$ which gs
/opt/local/bin/gs
$ which ps2pdf
/opt/local/bin/ps2pdf

I have some other problems with this, inclusive of files
which I could compile under xelatex (of TL2018) but not
via latex+dvips+ps2pdf,

Best,

Your MWE runs smoothly through latex/dvips/ps2pdf for me.

Same thing. I can't reproduce the error. Your MWE runs smoothly through
latex/dvips/ps2pdf and produces correct results here.

Subject: tlmgr: temporary directories not cleaned up
Message-ID: <20190305170942.2bacb011@hordevm>

Hi,

Some behaviour of tlmgr puzzles me. In my temporary directory
(TEMP=/tmp/user/$UID under Debian), each run of `tlmgr update --self
--all` (nothing else tried yet) creates a directory named with ten
random characters (upper-/lowercase, and underscores), that contains
files and subdirectories of equally obfuscated names. Each folder takes
some 14 MB disk space worth of checksums, GPG stuff, and (most notably)
a copy of texlive.tlpkg.

I strongly suspect these are temporary files created for package
download/configuration etc., and should not persist beyond the
execution of tlmgr. But they do. Is some "Keep me for debug reasons"
flag still in action?

Best,
Johannes

I have upgraded Ghostscript to 9.26 but the error persists

(after cleaning all files and starting from scratch)

$ ps2pdf testfcweight.ps
DEBUG: FC_WEIGHT didn't match
$ gs --version
9.26

MacOS 10.9.5 (a very good system still recent, 2014 I think)
TL 2018 fully updated

I get the same with the MacPorts TL2018 (december 2018) binaries.
(except for the kpse* binaries picked up from darwinlegacy, sorry
for complication).

I have not tested with TL2019-pretest.

Very strangely I *thought* having reproduced once the problem
with Bob example

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\begin{document}
foo
\end{document}


on my TeXLive 2018 with 9.26 Ghostscript and darwinlegacy binaries

$ ps2pdf testfcweight.ps
DEBUG: FC_WEIGHT didn't match

but, I did not get it 

- not with the MacPorts binaries

- not with my own compiled binaries from long time ago

and now I can *not* reproduce with darwinlegacy either.

But I do confirm the problem on my PsTricks example

and **all three** sets of binaries.

(each time I do fmtutil-sys --all and updmap-sys)

Sorry not to report yet on pretest situation.

But this is to point out this issue was already there in some configurations of users
with TeXLive 2018.

The postscript file contains

/URWPalladioL-Roma

in all three cases

I get no warning and I have no trace of Palatino-Roman
in the PS file.

Tried with TL 2019 with x86_64-darwin and darwinlegacy.

Subject: slow install from local rsynced mirror of pretest 2019
Message-ID: <C1875016-9D39-4866-B3DE-7BA6D007416A@free.fr>

Hi,

as usual I installed the 2019 pretest by first rsync'ing
one of the available mirrors to my local disk,

then ./install-tl

To my surprise this second step took 30mns which
is about 3 times more than the same step last
year and the year before on the same computer


...
Installing [3033/3033, time/total: 32:09/32:09]: zxjatype [142k]
Time used for installing the packages: 32:10
running mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist ...


This is a not quite complete install but almost

 <C> set installation collections:
     25 collections out of 41, disk space required: 4737 MB


I have in my notes

- for 2018 : 12 minutes
- for 2017 : 13'30''

I am not sure if on same computer but if not, then
it was on a slower one. (with same Mac OS X 10.9.5)

Any clue why suddenly much longer ?

Could it be that installation downloaded files from network
instead of using local mirror ?

I have followed exact same procedure as usual.

The rsyncing was only about 10 minutes (I am on a rather fast internet cable access with this computer)

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

The preinstalled Ghostscript for Windows in
TeX Live uses unmodified urw fonts thanks to Reinhard.

Have you tried it with

  dvipsDownloadBase35 false

in your updmap.cfg?

Grepping the sources shows it comes from Ghostscript. In v9.26;

Maybe it is something to report to the gs developers. I don't know. -k

I think the above code fragment is for ghostscript compiled with fontconfig
support,
so it could be helpful to look into fontconfig's configuration (or lack of
configuration)
on the problem systems.

Strange, I cannot reproduce this:

this shouldn't matter.

Can you try ./install-tl -v --no-cls
then you should see what is going on. I get for example in my rsync
checkout after initial configuration and start of installation

% fc-match  URWPalladioL-Roma
p052003l.pfb: "URW Palladio L" "Roman"
% fc-match  Palatino
pplr8a.pfb: "Palatino" "Roman"

If updmap.cfg has

dvipsDownloadBase35 false

then dvips generates a file which references Palatino-Roman,
rather than URWPalladioL-Roma, despite

LW35 URWkb

presumably because the font is expected to be in a printer
and will be Palatino, not URW Palladio. But then ps2pdf
should not even be looking for a Palatino font to embed in
the PDF.

I've used dvipsDownloadBase35 false when I wanted to
generate small PDFs for documents that use Times. (The same
issue with dvips and ps2pdf arises if the font package is
mathptmx.) But for Times one can use pdflatex with

pdftexDownloadBase14 false

and this still works.

Yep, FWIW I found this:

  FC_WEIGHT refers to the weight of a font (light, bold, regular, ExtraBold
  etc). This message can *only* arise when you are using FontConfig, and
  Ghostscript is enumerating the available fonts from font config, trying
  to find a match for a missing font in the input. This means that a
  candidate font did not match the target font's weight.

  Since you aren't going to use the font, it doesn't affect you.

Subject: [pretest]: xelatex selects semibold instead of bold
Message-ID: <87r2bkbjbr.fsf@siart.de>

When I run the following MWE through xelatex it selects Libertinus Serif
Semibold instead of Libertinus Serif Bold unless I set explicitely
[BoldFont = * Bold].

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Libertinus Serif}
\setsansfont{Libertinus Sans}
\begin{document}
Regular text and \textbf{boldface text}
\end{document}

I don't know if this is intended behaviour and when it was introduced.
But I think (but I'm not 100% sure) it was different in TL18.

Also, if this is an issue at all, I don't know whether it needs to be
fixed upstream or whether it is an issue with TL config files. So
please excuse if this is the wrong place to report.

ah ok FC thus means FontConfig.

On my system I also have a 9.21 gs, (a Fink installed one)

$ /sw/bin/gs --help
GPL Ghostscript 9.21 (2017-03-16)
Copyright (C) 2017 Artifex Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.
....
Ghostscript is also using fontconfig to search for font files
For more information, see /sw/share/ghostscript/9.21/doc/Use.htm.
Please report bugs to bugs.ghostscript.com.

which uses fontconfig

$ which -a fc-list
/opt/local/bin/fc-list
/sw/bin/fc-list
/opt/X11/bin/fc-list

but its ps2pdf does not report a FC_WEIGHT problem.

I got the "problem" with Ghostscript 9.23 and TeXLive 2018 and now with
Ghostscript 9.26 (in conjunction with TeXLive 2018, and with TeXLive 2019 pretest)
which got installed on my Mac OS via MacPorts.

However I do not seem to have any fontconfig generated database files in my $HOME.

I presume MacTeX distribution of TeXLive comes with own Ghostscript build
and will not display the issue ?

so this dispels my unfounded idea it might download from network.


I then started a normal install again, and I interrupted about mid-way

Installing [1390/3033, time/total: 09:02/20:55]: komacv-rg [854k]
Installing [1391/3033, time/total: 09:05/21:01]: kpathsea [1151k]
^C

In the mean time I discovered that my 250G SSD was more than 90% full
(about 240Go occupied after rsyncing tlpretest mirror and before launching
2nd install)

This may explain the slow-down. (my second try as reported above also
promised to definitely take more than the 12 minutes of last year).

Other possibility is that a Time Machine backup started yesterday
precisely while I was installing.

Anyway, I was reporting only in case.

I will move my TeXLive previous years to some backup to free disk space,

and also will check (I thought I had it disabled) if the system did not download
Mojave behind my back.

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Done, r50257.

If under unix/linux/macos the wrapper block fails to start the tcl
gui then it continues with the main installer, and lets it interpret
all parameters as before, i.e. '-gui' without specific value becomes
perltk.

Expert still means perltk, that being my interpretation of
`principle of least surprise'.

According to fontforge, my pplr8a.pfb (a real Adobe
Palatino, renamed for use with LaTeX) has a weight of
"medium", whereas uplr8a.pfb (the texlive version of
Palatino) and p0520031.pfb (the CentOS version) have a
weight of "Roman", which is presumably why fontconfig thinks
the former doesn't match the weight specified by dvips.
Sigh. Surely "Roman" isn't a weight!

Using builtin35 with dvips and then ps2pdf is evidently not
a good idea, so I'll follow that advice and not worry about
it.

Is there an "official" way of uninstalling an old version

tlmgr? Or is

  rm -rf /usr/share/texlive/20xx 

OK?

If you haven't used "tlmgr path", ie there are no links from outside,

Because there were indications that my installation was not in very best
order (e.g. it was lacking the texlive.profile file) I did uninstall and
reinstall. I saw a new gui but I didn't see this phenomenon (kinda crash
in the very end) again. Probably it's in the column "not reproducible"
and, therefore, not worth worrying about it any longer.

The test file with pst-plot refers

NimbusSanL-Regu

whether it is obtained with 

dvips -Pdownload35 testfcweight.dvi

or

dvips -Pbuiltin35 testfcweight.dvi

changes nothing.

I get

$ fc-match NimbusSanL-Regu

and this zhv-Reg.otf is in

Hi Norbert,

the mystery remains, but we are getting closer. On tuesday, I did
another two installations of TL19 pretest, on Debian stable and
FreeBSD, and waited until now for packages to be updated.

When nothing is to be done, the temporary directories are deleted just
after tlmgr finishes.

Today, there were package updates AND a new texlive.infra (50211 ->
50251), and on both new platforms, the folders in question remained?

# Debian
drwx------ 5 name group 4.0K Mar  7 12:00 /tmp/user/$UID/Ooo7GNPvoU/
# FreeBSD, $TEMP not set
drwx------ 5 name group  512 Mar  7 12:27 /tmp/Uptddrbh1_

containing a few empty folders, texlive.tlpdb, and the checksum of
texlive.tlpdb

On the third box, I ran --self and --all separately, and temporaries
were deleted properly.
But temporary files are always left over whenever tlmgr is invoked with
`--self --all` AND an texlive.infra update is installed.
I can reproduce this behaviour on all three boxes, either when package
updates come in, or with a rollback (`tlmgr restore --all` or `tlmgr
restore texlive.infra 50211`) from the now well-working backups.

My best explanation for this: at the moment where tlmgr is automatically
restarted after texlive.infra updates, it forgets to tidy up its
temporary folders.

BTW: I found such a directory dated May 2018 (for TL18-release updates;
I can't say any more if this has been a regular update or tlmgr just
crashed back then), so maybe this issue is not new to TL2019.

Best,
Johannes

Ahh, I see. I *can* imagine what is the problem ...

Yes. The tidying up is left to the Temp Perl module, but it seems it
doesn't to the cleanup on exec. I will look into it (hopefully).

Thanks for your testing!!!

Message-ID: <CADs++6izAoDq32Req+SaAF8mVs2X2t2R7y4h3woB5Df=jtrx+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

is there a PDF viewer - ideally something that comes with texlive, but
other ones are ok - that accepts a "starting page" option and that
runs on Windows and Macs?

Let me explain why I'm asking this. I'm going to give a course on
LaTeX and Lua and I'm going to use "elisp hyperlinks to pages of
PDFs", like the ones here,

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html#9.3
  http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html#9.4

a lot. The students are going to use machines with GNU/Linux, TeXLive,
Emacs and xpdf in the laboratory and I'm planning to sort of force
them to install something similar in their own computers, but it would
be great if I could create a setup that also works on Windows and
Macs...

  Cheers,
    Eduardo Ochs

Yes, there is. TeXworks (http://www.tug.org/texworks/) can do that with
the -p command line switch. TeXworks is actually a TeX editor, but it
has a built-in PDF viewer that can be used stand-alone. AFAIK, it comes
with texlive on Windows, but it's also available on Mac and several
Linux distros.

_Disclaimer_: I'm one of the programmers.

This is indeed a bug introduced with dvisvgm 2.4. I've tracked down the 
issue and think it's almost fixed. The changes need some further 
testing, though. I'm a bit busy at the moment but hope to finish the 
patch next weekend.

Yesterday I installed the pretest via rsync

Today I wanted to point it to an online pretest repo, but using

tlmgr -> tlmgr -> load other repository ...

It is not at all obvious that one can only choose one of the repos listed in the drop down. I can write all I want in the field, but the Load button remains gray untill I choose something from the drop down.

It is not obvious at all that there is a drop down here.

If we are not allowed to write free text in that field, perhaps <Please choose> should be a better choice?

This was run on Linux  using the perl Tk option (I think version Tk-804.034)

The Perl/Tk GUI is an extension of the command-line tlmgr. However,
the new GUIs, tlcockpit (Java) and tlshell (Tcl/Tk) are separate
programs: the GUI starts up first, and starts tlmgr as back end.

Note. The same is basically true for the installer GUIs.  Although
on Unix the tcl GUI is started by the install-tl perl script, this
is only by sleight of hand: first install-tl decides whether a tcl
interface is decided, and if so, it transfers control to the tcl
script, which starts install-tl again, but now as back end. Running
the tcl script directly works just as well.  We just did not want to
clutter the installer root with more programs than we could help.

It was rather strange, as the tcl installer gui worked just fine

The full tlmgr did not seem to be working with tcl

Hi Eduardo,

As you are going to use Emacs (and Elisp)
you could try an Emacs package pdf-tools (https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools).

I'm using it as my PDF viewer within Emacs.

best regards,
deimi

I'm sorry to hijack the thread but while translating messages to Russian
I faced with two places with "backend"s:

  "Error while reading from Perl backend"

and

  "Unexpected closed backend"

If I understand the above paragraph correctly, the last one means the
tlmgr as backend. The first message seems to be crystal clear: the tlmgr
as it is written in Perl. Both messages appear in install-gui so they
might be shown only during installation. Even if I'm right about the
meaning of second message, both messages look too be a bit, imho,
techinal. If they are tightly related with tlmgr may be just say about
that?

So actually when installing the TeX Live using GUI/Tcl the backend is
'install-tl' not tlmgr, or 'install-tl' itself runs 'tlmgr' as backend?
IMHO, it's too involved, the simple 'backend' (with some explanation
about 'backend's in view of 'install-tl') will be good.

That paragraph was about the tlmgr GUIs; the backend of the tcl

These backend error messages are about something that is not
supposed to happen, not about user error. At least, it is a message
that users can quote to us.

Then shouldn't they be untranslated? Otherwise someone has to look into
corresponding *.po file and to find original message. Also, it is unclear
should user report about occured error to "upstream" (TeX Live
developers) or not.

I just released dvisvgm 2.6.3 that should fix this and a few additional 
bugs. Let me know if you find any further issues.

Or provide a translatable string such as:

  If you are here, that's because something goes wrong. Please report to
  ... with the following message.

and now follows the untranslated message in English.

Needless to say, "Please report to ... with the following message" could
be replaced by "If you ask help somewhere about this trouble, please
provide the following message".

HI, 

from tlmgr conf I get :

$ tlmgr conf
=========================== version information ==========================
tlmgr revision 49997 (2019-02-11 00:50:35 +0100)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2019
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2019


But this is after having done an update of TL2019 pretest :

tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/ (verified)
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2019/tlpkg/backups
[1/1, ??:??/??:??] update: texlive.infra [387k] (50211 -> 50251) ... done
Restarting tlmgr to complete update ...

Why does tlmgr conf refer to a possibly now past version of tlmgr,
or is there no connection between the tlmgr revision number and
the texlive.infra package revision number ?

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

texlive.infra >= tlmgr

The tlmgr revision is when the tlmgr.pl file itself was last committed
(as is apparent from the first few lines of tlmgr.pl).  This is the case
for most of the core scripts that report revision numbers. -k

That is indeed *wrong*. We don't want to restrict to the list there, but
allow arbitrary URLs. I will look into it.

Well, it actually worked but only with some playing around ;-) I did
some tricks to disable the button when a continent/country was selected,
but that wasn't a good idea.

I commited changes so that now whatever you put in there you can press
OK.

One Warning: due to the current downloader setup, putting in something
unusable will hang tlmngr for a *long* time (retry count = 10, timeout =
30sec,...). I hope I can fix that before release.

Enjoy

I just wanted to mention that trying to test the installer with tcl gui
during the flight (no wifi) felt strange with no logs or error messages,
just infinite time of nothing happening at all. Without tcl at least you
get to see what's happening.

I shortly hesitated to edit tlmgr.pl, but it did the trick:
texlive.infra upgraded from 50251 (+ the File::Temp::cleanup() patch)
to 50309; some package updates thereafter, and no temporary directory
remained!
Now I have a manually modified tlmgr.pl deep in the backup archive,
until -r50333 finds its way into an texlive.infra update.

Best,
Johannes

Hi,

I just updated the TeXLive 2019 pretest under Windows

from tlmgr.log:

texlive.infra (50251 -> 50334)
texlive.infra.win32 (50178 -> 50329)
tlperl.win32 (46882 -> 50322)

After that infrastructure update I obtain

> tlmgr.bat gui

Event.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched (got handshake key 00F4DD44, needed 0000000)

and tlmgr didn't start, even after using update-tlmgr-latest.exe. (r50334)

> tlmgr.bat update --all

still works and installs about 25 further updates.

Ciao,
  Torsten

There are now new GUIs for tlmgr, viz. tlshell, which should work
out of the box, and tlcockpit, which requires Java.

The TL Perl distribution for windows has just been updated. It no
longer includes a Tk module, since both the installer and tlmgr have
new GUIs which do not require it. This is why `tlmgr.bat gui' no
longer works.

The error message is a bit odd. It suggests to me that tlmgr tries
and fails to load a left-behind Tk module from the previous perl
distribution, which should not be there anymore, but that is just
guess work from my part.

Good guess. Infrastructure updates do *not* remove old files since
*ages*. From tlmgr.pl:

	sub write_w32_updater {
	  my ($restart_tlmgr, $ref_files_to_be_removed, @w32_updated) = @_;
	  my @infra_files_to_be_removed = @$ref_files_to_be_removed;
	  # TODO do something with these files TODO

So now we are somehow hosed ...

tlmgr.bat could scan its parameters and divert to tlshell if it
detects [-[-]]gui, similar to install-tl-windows.bat.

The tlmgr-gui shortcut has already been replaced with a tlshell
shortcut but I guess we should remove tlmgr-gui altogether.

For other platforms, there is of course no such problem.

What OS? If GNU/Linux, have you refreshed the font cache?

On my machine

diff /usr/local/texlive/201{9,8}/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/libertinus-fonts/

shows no difference.

AFAIS it is not about the availability of the font file, but the change in
fontspec of something else that the Bold font is not found automatically
anymore.

This has been reported a few times, I am not sure who to blame and what
would be the best solution.

Hi,

this is not only a matter of font cache. It can be a change in the
algorithm of lookup of fomnt variants, it can be the change in the
font internals so that it is identified in a slightly different way
and the fontspec algorithm is unable to find the boldface variant. It
happens even with fonts distributed with TeX Live.

It is discussed that
\setmainfont[BoldFont={Libertinus Serif Bold}]{Libertinus Serif}
is necessary to obtain the desirable

Calling fonts residing in the texmf by font name works on linux only
if you extend the font config. Did you do this?

https://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-340003.4.4

Did you check which fonts are found by xelatex and used? You can add
\XeTeXtracingfonts=1 to the document and compile with

xelatex --no-pdf file 
xdvipdfmx -vv file

to get more info.

I?m enjoying TLCockpit, as it?s basically
the same as TeX Live Utility for macOS.

I think it could it be improved by changing the
default startup tab, which currently is ?Packages?
rather than ?Updates?. Alternatively there could be
some option to decide what tab to start with.

Could you please open an issue at the GitHub page so that I don't forget it.

Would you also want that updates are automatically loaded when starting the program and you are directly brought to the updates tab?

Hi everyone - if you have any chance of installing the TL pretest and
trying it out on your documents, please do!
http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

Every year for a while there have been one or two major bugs that aren't
found before the release, thus necessitating quick rebuilds. It would be
nice if we didn't have that happen this year. There is no other way than
to have as many people as possible try the pretest. You can throw away
the entire pretest directory after the release is made, all TL
installations are independent.

The freebsd binaries are not yet updated, but all other platforms have been.

Please report any problems, and thanks,
Karl

Hi everyone - if you have any chance of installing the TL pretest and

Please report any problems, and thanks,


First rsynch late yesterday evening, first test install this morning.  Initial feedback :

  1.  The "Browser for and/or edit" interface to select the root of the installation ends up presenting the user with mixed-direction slashes, even if he/she has not typed a slash into any of the dialogue boxes
  2.  The "Collections" dialogue box is very unclear ? when one attempts to de-select a language or another collection, the bullet turns black rather than white, and it is only when one clicks elsewhere that the "cleared" rather than "selected" state becomes apparent.
  3.  The ability to individually tweak the settings presented by the initially-concealed advanced options menu is much appreciated.

More (perhaps) when the installation has completed.

More now.

  1.  The installation appears to have completed without hiccoughs, and the installation log reports only minor problems concerning the system path.

  2.  After adjusting the system path, a 96pp legal document on which I was working (using TL 2018) continues to compile successfully under TeX Live 2019 (pre-test).

  3.  However, a 553pp Catalogue of Greek MSS in the Lambeth Palace Library which uses locally-provided support for Hebrew now fails to compile, reporting :
\key= (MS1214f91rdetail)

! e-TeX error: language hebrew undefined..

\et at xmsg ...lines =0 \errmessage {e-TeX error: #2}

\else \message {\n ! e-TeX...

...

l.39 ...foreign direction="RTL" language="Hebrew">

???</foreign>?? for lection

?

  4.  The error reported in (3), above, caused me to look to see if by some mischance TeX Live 2019 (pre-test) was not using the path for TeXMFlocal that I had specified at installation time (C:\TeX\Live\TeXMF\Local); this was indeed the case (it has created C:\TeX\Live\texmf-local), and, worse, it has also ignored all of my other path customisations, creating C:\TeX\Live\2019\texmf-config and C:\TeX\Live\2019\texmf-var rather than C:\TeX\Live\2019\TeXMF\Config and C:\TeX\Live\2019\TeXMF\Var as specified to the installer.

  5.  I note that the installation of TeX Live 2019 (pre-test) has added an entry to my start menu :  "DVIOUT DVI viewer", and that new file associations have been created for (perhaps amongst others) .eps, .ps, .pdf and a number of image formats.  I would prefer to be asked whether such entries & associations should be created.

Aside that I had to start installation three times, I noticed the
following situation which seems to me like a bug: unfortunately I could
only make a screenshot:

I replaced the 'fisheye' chacter with a checkmark character for
windows. Hope you like that better.

I cannot exactly reproduce this: if I create the texmf subdirectory
beforehand then the choices are respected; if not, the installer
ends with an error message

W:/systems/texlive/tlpretest/install-tl:
mkdir(C:\texlive\2019\texmf\var/) failed: No such file or directory
at W:/systems/texlive/tlpretest/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 913,

whereas the text-mode installer has no problem. Am looking into
this.

That is what the 'Desktop integration'- and 'File associations'
options are for.

OK, I will delete everything and try again after re-rsynch'ing, but not 
today as this legal document must go to the Court tomorrow !

OK, is it possible that when I went to the new advanced screen and set 
some options there that it forgot that I had changed things in the main 
dialogue box ?? Here are the seemingly relevant lines from the log file :

OK, I will search for those on my next install.? What I would like (if 
it is possible) is for TeX files to be associated with TL2019/TeXworks 
but no other associations; also a start menu entry for TeX Live 2019 
suite rather than for DVIOUT (or whatever).

The advanced screen only adds to the basic screen, and the More...
screen adds still more, and all the old options are still there.

These are the user versions. I guess you meant to edit the system

Then choose 'none' for file associations and define your file
associations via the Open or Open with entry from the right-click
menu in windows' File Explorer.

Try choosing 'Launcher entry' for Desktop integration. You can
create your own ini file if you want another selection in the
launcher; see the tlaunch documentation.

No, I did not even know that I could change the local ones at the time I 
changed the system ones, then I went to the "More" screen, was delighted 
to see I could now change TeXMFSysLocal and even more delighted to see I 
could change the ".texlive" to something more meaningful, which I did.? 
But I did not go back and remove my earlier changes to the system 
directory hierarchies ...

Excellent, will try both once once this bundle of papers for the Court 
is finally put to bed.

I fully agree, though I'm not a Windows user. But numerous people
I helped to install TL on Windows complained about this new default
viewer for their `.pdf' files (which is ugly and, the last time
I checked it, has much less features compared to SumatraPDF or even
Acrobat Reader). The default viewer for `.pdf' files should be left
intact.

At most, DVIOUT could be the default viewer for `.dvi' and `.eps' files.

I forgot: image viewers should be left intact as well.

Nothing has changed on our end. The default is still that existing
file associations are not overridden, so I do not know what is going
on with your users. 'Open with' entries may be added, but these do
not override a default file association.

As to psview: it currently does not work, at least not for me and
several others.  We are still hoping for an update before release,
otherwise its menu entry and its file associations will be scrapped.

So now I tried the GUI installer on Linux for the first time, too.
I was surprised about the German localisation (-:
There is a little cosmetic issue (not really impeding quality): the
Tcl GUI treats escape sequences of quotation marks wrongly.

Master/tlpkg/translations/de.po:2087 says
> msgstr "Medium (\"small\" + mehr Pakete und Sprachen)"
and this is displayed as is, including the backslashes in front of the
"'s, instead of adhering to the gettext standard.
No idea if there is a simple fix for that.

Best,
Johannes

I installed MacTeX pretest and tried it with the 434 pages book I have just finished writing. Updating and compiling the document worked flawlessly.

Still seeing mixed-directions slashes at first dialogue box after 
browsing to C\TeX :? C:/TeX \ Live \ 2019; everything else seems fine so 
far but will report back once re-install complete. Incidentally, how do 
I tell if I am about to use r50427 ?

After tlmgr update

the display does not react to the update#; "Restart tlmgr" does not seem
to work; "Restart self" does, but after the default repository is
loaded, there is still the display to "TL Manager up to date?" Needs
updating.

What shall I do?

Hi,

there is something I am not sure about from the documentation:

>        "tlmgr" reads two configuration files: one is system-wide, in
>        "TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tlmgr/config", and the other is user-specific, in
>        "TEXMFCONFIG/tlmgr/config".  The user-specific one is the default for
>        the "conf tlmgr" action.  (Run "kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFSYSCONFIG" or
>        "... TEXMFCONFIG ..." to see the actual directory names.)
> 

If I understand correctly, if in the system-wide file I set

require-verification=1

then this will get overridden:

- by the user-specific config, if any,

- by the command line options, if any,

Am I right ?

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

I got curious and did the following:

Obviously the tlmgr does not get updated! After the first comman the
local number should be 50427.

r50427 seems good regarding user-modified locations for the various

1) "Launcher" is not what I had in mind; what I would like added 
(ideally by default) to the start menu is simply the TeX Live 2019 
utilities menu, the one to which one can more laboriously get by Start / 
All programs / TeX Live 2019

2) TLMGR is dysfunctional (see attached screenshot).? After clicking 
"OK", it just disappears.? If the screenshot is not visible, it reads

 ??? (i) Level 1: initialise
 ??? ??? Level 2: start_tlmgr

Hi,

> tar: Could not create file tlpkg/tltcl/tclkit.exe: Permission denied

That is strange... have yo done something to this file? Now on the
command line it is not active so it should be able to be replaced on
Windows ..

Sorry, my knowledge of Windows ends here. Most of the time it is a
problem of files being in use cannot be replaced/removed on Windows
(of course, how should this work - besides the rest of the world can do
it).

But this is not the case here ...

Hope that Siep has a better idea.

After restarting windows I could successfully run the command.
Obviously, something was left in memory from the errorneous start of tlmgr.

I tried installing the MacTeX pretest on a Mac running El Capitan 10.11.6.  But 
the package complained that my system is too old: "This package requires 
Yosemite (mac OS 10.10) or higher."  Since I am running a more recent system, 
something is wrong.  Is it merely the error message or the test?

I've installed TeXLive 2019 on a virtual Windows 10 machine running on a
Linux host (Fedora 29).

I wanted to update my installation by using the TL Shell. The window
shows "tlmgr need update". I clicked on Help->tlmgr help, clicking on
"close" ended with an error message - I didn't save the screen shot, but
this error appeared late on under other circumstances.

Bug: The title bar of the help window shows "tlmg" instead of "tlmgr".

Then I did the following steps:
1. I clicked on "update tlmgr" (step_01.png)
2. Looking at the logs, all seemed to work fine -> tlmgr restarting
(step_02.png).
3. Looking at possible errors, I found the common message (Backup not
implemented...), I wanted to close the window. An error message popped
up (step_03a.png, step_03b.png). 
4. A second try closed the error window, but TL Shell still shows "needs
update" (step_04.png).
5. I clicked on "update tlmgr" again, output and error log were looking
good again, the window can be closed (step_05a.png, step_05b.png,
step_05c.png),
6. but now no button is active (step_06.png).
7. Rebooting the VM produced the same behavior as before, the logs seem
to be fine, the pop up window can be closed directly (step_07.png). I
feel like living on groundhog day...

MacTeX requires 10.12. The "your system is too old" part is correct,
but the version cut is wrong, it should say that 10.12 is required.
This needs to be fixed. Karl? (I'm afraid we'll hit the exact same
problem next year as this needs to be changed in multiple locations.)

TeX Live should still work on 10.11 with legacy binaries, just not
MacTeX itself.

I do not know where that text is coming from. I cannot find it in the TL
code. Dick, is it in your installer?

After using TeXLive on Windows for a few years, I?ve just installed it

Is there any set of .desktop files around, which would correspond to
the Start menu shortcuts installed under Windows?

John Collins,

The dialog in MacTeX-2019 is the Welcome dialog of the installer. I caught the error shortly after uploading MacTeX-2019, and the current welcome says "This package requires mac OS 10.12 or higher." I haven't bothered uploading a new version of MacTeX because you can use TeX Live Utility to update to the latest stuff. Note this message isn't in any TeX Live software; it is just in my Apple Install Package.

I think it is not created by the installer but there is a xdg system
which allows to add TL to the start menu of Linux GUI and by standard
tools you can make a desktop icon. Anyway, I do not know what you
exactly need. If you use a text editor and launch TeX from its
toolbar, then you need an editor in the menu/desktop, not TeX Live.
The editors are part of Linux distributions and they already have
entries in the menu. You could need an icon for tlmgr for maintenance.

I tried to create menu entries and .desktop files by an installer
script for another project, I have it in bash. If the TL developers
like, I can make them available.

Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this, since I updated the tlmgr from
the command line and I donot see such errors anymore.

Update on previous comments :

 1. r50427 is good regarding user-modified locations for the various
    trees (thank you Siep)

 2. "Launcher" is not at all what I had in mind; what I would like added
    (ideally by default) to the start menu is simply the TeX Live 2019
    directory, the one to which one can more laboriously get by Start /
    All programs / TeX Live 2019. Having created the shortcut by hand,
    its properties are :

      * Type: Shortcut (lnk)
      * Target: "C:\Users\Philip
        Taylor\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\TeX
        Live 2019"

 3. TLMGR is completely dysfunctional (see attached screenshot).? After
    clicking "OK", it just disappears.? If the screenshot is not
    visible, it reads

     ??? (i) Level 1: initialise
     ??? ??? Level 2: start_tlmgr

 4. A plethora of? "permission denied"s here :

      * tar: Could not create file
        bin/win32/api-ms-win-core-file-l1-2-0.dll: Permission denied (etc).

    These were apparently caused by running the installer with a target
    location of C:\TeX\Live\2019 where C:\TeX\Live\2019 was already
    populated from an earlier installation.? If it is not already the
    case, it would be useful to update the (pre-test and main)
    installation instructions to point out that an attempt to install to
    an already populated location may well fail with multiple permission
    errors.

Today I tried again to update tlmgr from the manager without success, I
had to use the commandline which worked.

I noticed that the tlmgr shell never becomes "idle", but is always in
the "wait" (Warte...) state. How long do I have to wait?

Hi,

if the one the option:

- "Create symlinks in system directories" (GUI install)

(BTW, why not the same string?) has been chosen, the final message:

  ?????
  ? Add /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/man to MANPATH.
  ? Add /usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/doc/info to INFOPATH.
  ? Most importantly, add /usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux
  ? to your PATH for current and future sessions.
  ?????

should not be displayed, as it is confusing and would lead to useless
extra configurations.

Hi,

currently, only the GUI install tries to deduce the language from the

It would be nice for the text install to do the same.

When clicking "start neu" (restart self) it re-starts but switches to
English language. And the indicator is "Idle" which does not translate
to "Warte..." but to "arbeitslos", "Leerlauf" or "bereit".

I hope that this is solved with today's update of tlshell, which

Thanks to everyone who's tried out the pretest.

I should have mentioned one thing in particular to test: inclusion of
pdf images in luatex. A new library is being used for that -- pplib,
originally written by Pawel Jackowski. So there are probably bugs and
unexpected differences from the behavior of the poppler library used
previously. (Couldn't hurt to try inclusion of other image types either,
but pdf is the one that is new code.)

We hope to use pplib in xetex and pdftex in coming years too. --thanks, karl.

Message-ID: <201903192252.x2JMqvvE025266@freefriends.org>

    - "create symlinks to standard directories" (text install)
    - "Create symlinks in system directories" (GUI install)

    (BTW, why not the same string?)

I don't know what happens in the GUI or on Windows, but for the text
installer, the default is /usr/local/whatever. I think "standard
directory" is a better description than "system directory" for that;
with "system directory", I'd expect the links to be made in (say)
/usr/bin. (Clearly not a default we would want.)

Siep, if you agree, please go ahead and change the GUI string. If you
don't agree, that's fine too, the world will go on :).

    has been chosen, the final message:
    ...
    should not be displayed, as it is confusing and would lead to
    useless extra configurations.

Hmm. I agree you have a point, although I think the symlink option is so
problematic for reliability and maintenance that I don't like to do
anything that suggests that people use it or rely on those links. Will
contemplate. --thanks, karl.

You mean the scripts, or the .desktop files, or something else?

I am not sure what we could/should do with them, though ...
We could leave it to the user to install them into 
$XDG_CONFIG/share/applications or similar.

IIRC, we already have a discussion on this topic some years ago :)

Symlinks are IMHO so much simpler that I still advise them during my
LaTeX courses. The only problem I've seen is for binaries installed
afterwards that are not found but, if I'm right, it is just a matter of
recreate the symlinks.

I have two small bash scripts, one for a menu, one for a desktop icon.
Of course, both can be done in a single script, it was just a test. I
have also the .desktop files but for a dummy application, I was only
looking for a working test.

As I found, if the .desktop files are just copied to the directories,
they do not work, it is necessary to restart X. If xdg-install-menu
and xdg-install-icon are used, they work immediatelly.

Dear all,

I don't know whether this is a bug or whether I'm just trying to use it
the wrong way. Upon "tlmgr --gui" in the command window (Win7, run as
Administrator) I get the following:

C:\>tlmgr --gui

C:\>tlmgr --gui update

Just tested it, seems to work fine. But I have three other points:
1. I agree with Bernhard Kleine, that "warte..." isn't the correct
translation/doesn't have the meaning of "idle..."
2. Why are messages like "running mktexlsr ..." shown under the error
tab in the Logs window. From my point of view these messages belong to
the standard output. Only the text following "?bersprungen, da nicht
installiert" should go into the error tab.
3. Today I had a long list of updates, so the tlmgr command had a long
argument list. This increased the TeX Live Shell window to the right and
I got an annoying large window. Is it possible to break the command line
into small portions to prevent the increase of window area?

What happened is that tlmgr tried to run with the perltk GUI
interface and that it found last year's perltk, which really should
not be there anymore, and which does not work with this year's perl.

Try tlshell instead, which is what the TeX Live Manager menu
shortcut points to.

I guess I should edit tlmgr.bat to issue a warning and bail out if a
-gui parameter was given.

The tlmgr back end decides what goes where. Renaming the Errors tab

I'll look into that.

What does the shell script(s) do? Generate a .desktop file, but for
which program?

On Debian it works. This is distribution specific. Even if I put a
.desktop file into /usr/local/share/applications/ I automatically get it
working. Same under $HOME.

It might be better to generate the .desktop file manually and include
it in the installer package but since it is a plain text file, it can
be generated by any script on demand. My experiments are now available
from http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/desktop/

Yes, the TeX Live Manager menu shortcut points to tlshell and it runs
fine.

IIRC the old perltk gui offered the possibility to list packages/schemes
which are *not* installed. I don't find this in tlshell. Is it planned
for the future?

Then probably it makes sense to also remove the --gui stuff from tlmgr

For fvwm, lines

AddToMenu ....
+ "XDG" Popup XDGMenu

in ~/.fvwm/config add a menu composed from .desktop files to my
hand-made fvwm menu. So TL .desktop files would probably be useful
even for many users of window managers.

This is on Ubuntu 18.04.

Not at the moment. But if enough people want it then I might.

Linux/Unix users may still have a perl with a working Perl/Tk. But I
agree that the tlmgr documentation should mention it.

I think this is rather a desktop environment than a distribution policy;
it's a freedesktop.org specification:

https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html

In my experience, Mate (on Ubuntu Mate at least, but I'm sure in 
general) and Cinnamon work the same.

I see. But then tlmgr-gui.exe could be removed from the Windows binaries
since it is pointless now, right?

Hi!

Full install of pretest today, succesfull, I can compile *.tex files. I called the installer-tl-...bat as admin.

When I open "cmd" as admin, the command "tlmgr --gui" produces an error:

========================

Cannot load Tk, that should not happen as we ship it!
How did you start tlmgrgui??
(Error message: Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC (you may need to install
the Tk module) (@INC contains:

C:/ texlive/2019/tlpkg/ tlperl/ lib) at
C:\ texlive\2019\texmf-dist\ scripts\ texlive\ tlmgr.plline 5093.
)

========================

I can open tlmgr gui simply using the start menu of windows, folder "TeX Live 2019" and open the item "TeX Live Manger" as admin. That works.

I have no idea why I get this error message. There is an perl installation on the machine, but in the PATH variable the very first item is "C:\texlive\2019\bin\win32". I did not reboot, though.

Alexander

I've seen your mg-attempt.desktop file and find it conformant to the 
Freedesktop specification:

https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html

but I have to say that I'm completely ignorant of these matters.

Also, there is a brief document on this on the Gnome Developer site:

The Tk module has been dropped from the TL perl distribution for
windows.  The start menu shortcut starts the replacement tlshell
front end for tlmgr, which does not require the Tk module.

I am going to modify tlmgr.bat to make this clear.

By the way, nowadays few things require a reboot.

It was removed from bin/win32:  r50391.

Ah, ok. Then it wasn't deleted during the updates. It is still there in
my bin/win32. But that's not a big issue, I think.

Update on previous comments :

  1.  r50427 is good regarding user-modified locations for the various trees (thank you Siep)

  2.  "Launcher" is not at all what I had in mind; what I would like added (ideally by default) to the start menu is simply the TeX Live 2019 directory, the one to which one can more laboriously get by Start / All programs / TeX Live 2019.  Having created the shortcut by hand, its properties are :

     *   Type: Shortcut (lnk)
     *   Target: "C:\Users\Philip Taylor\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\TeX Live 2019"

  3.  TLMGR is completely dysfunctional (see attached screenshot).  After clicking "OK", it just disappears.  If the screenshot is not visible, it reads

    (i) Level 1: initialise
        Level 2: start_tlmgr

  4.  A plethora of  "permission denied"s here :

     *   tar: Could not create file bin/win32/api-ms-win-core-file-l1-2-0.dll: Permission denied (etc).

These were apparently caused by running the installer with a target location of C:\TeX\Live\2019 where C:\TeX\Live\2019 was already populated from an earlier installation.  If it is not already the case, it would be useful to update the (pre-test and main) installation instructions to point out that an attempt to install to an already populated location may well fail with multiple permission errors.

Ok, they are for a different project. That does not help.
I know how to write .desktop files, but I don't want to sit down and
write them for TL programs since I don't use them.

Subject: luacsplain please
Message-ID: <c752c3cb-36e5-cedd-fa54-288d38e7e397@olsak.net>

Hello,

I'v installed tlpretest 2019 and everything seems to be OK (from my 
documents of view).

I wish to add new command to TeXlive which calls "luacsplain" and it is 
a shortcut for "luatex -fmt pdfcsplain". The "pdfcsplain" command exists 
and it means "pdftex -fmt pdfcsplain". So, pdfcsplain -> luacsplain may 
be something analogical to pdflatex -> lualatex.

I did major change in luatex -fmt pdfcsplain last week: now, it loads 
all hyphen patterns dynanically (except patterns 0).? And I am ready to 
propagate this form of CSPlain as preferred for future. This is a reason 
of my need of a shortcut "luacsplain".

I mean that it si much more simple to new users of CSplain to use 
luacsplain and not to waste time to study a special and old "encoding 
dance" used in CSplain in 1990s. But the pdfcsplain command may be kept 
for conservative users.

The existing possibility to run luacsplain via "lautex -fmt pdfcsplain" 
may be kept unchanged because this is impossible to remove this from all 
documentation about CSplain (and from all home-made configurations which 
is based on this command). So new command may be implemented as link

ln -s pdfcsplain.fmt luacsplain.fmt ... in texmf-var/web2c/luatex/? and

ln -s luatex luacsplain? ... in binaries.

Thank you

Petr Olsak

For windows, cp -p pdfcsplain.fmt luacsplain.fmt
(or an independent line
luacsplain luatex - -etex csplain.ini
in fmtutil.cnf)
and
cp -p luatex.exe luacsplain.exe

Good point. I intend to add a test and a warning message if the user
picks a non-empty directory as root.

OK, thank you for testing.? Following an earlier message by a user who 
had successfully launch TLMGR as Administrator, I tried that and it 
worked; however, trying to launch it as myself (the person who installed 
TeX Live, and who did not use "Install as administrator") I consistently 
provokes the behaviour previously described.? Are you able to locate 
those two strings in the source files ?? Their location may provide a 
clue ...

Subject: Updating tlmgr from tlshell on windows
Message-ID: <20190321100018.GB1658@bitmuis.nl>

On windows, an update of tlmgr from tlshell fails sometimes, e.g.
because windows complains that a to-be-updated file is in use.
So on windows tlshell informs about the command-line alternative and
asks for confirmation. Tomorrow's update should do the same for
`update all' if that includes tlmgr.

By the way: even on the command-line I encountered this problem
although there was no process in sight that could be using the
particular file. A reboot solved the problem. Well, windows remains
windows ...

And tlmgr.bat now tests for a gui parameter and bails out with a
reference to tlshell.

It looks like the output from a stack trace. It means that tlshell
failed to start tlmgr.

I recall you mentioning that you keep several TeX Live distributions
on your system. It might be safer to do portable installations,
which by design do not get in each other's way. The file
tl-tray-menu.exe in the installation root creates a temporary tray
menu as a substitute for the TL menu under the start menu.

Just another question: would it be possible to show the svn number in
the tlshell. This would make it possible to see if the version of the
running program had changed.

Today I tried to update texlive.infra using tclkit.exe. I didnot
succeed. However, updating from the command line worked. Still the
errorfull message "Warte..." instead of "idle" (Bereit).

OK, thank you for that feedback/suggestion Siep.? If I use a portable 
installation, I remember the installer warning me that it might modify 
some of my pre-specified locations.? In what circumstances would it do 
that, and could it still share C:\TeX\Live\TeX-MF\Local, from where my 
(mandatory) support for Hebrew originates ?? And is there a tracing 
option by which I/we might learn more about why TLSHELL is (apparently) 
failing to start TLMGR ?? I find that if I launch it from the command 
line (as "tlshell --debug"), it demands privilege elevation.

In English the expression is -- according to the PO-file -- Errors. I'll
change it for the German version to "Log-Ausgabe" but I think it should be
fixed in the English and other versions as well.

Two items regarding the English master messages:

* As "GUI" means graphical user interface, "GUI interface" might be a bit
redundant.

* "Use an admininstative command prompt for an admin install." ==> "Use an
administrative command prompt for an admin install." or IMHO better "Use a
command prompt with administrative rights for an admin install."

It is completely redundant, but nevertheless common usage in English. If
it feels better in other languages to leave out "interface", by all
means do so. -k

Should we be perpetuating this "error"[1]?

Anybody who uses TeX will be ahead of the curve, so will know the
correct form. I suppose Norbert could for an amble up Mount Fujiyama,
having got some cash from an ATM machine.

Ideally add to our house style rules?

Whatever.

I am not a Windows expert but I fount in an official documentation,
that the names of some keys in Win64 differs from the corresponding
keyas in Win32. These keys are visible, but they are read only copies.
It is necessary to delete the Win64 keys and then the Win32 keys
disappear. Maybe it is this case.

It refers to a failed attempt to modify the Windows registry. "HKCU" is 
"Hkey Current User", "Software/Classes" are two nested sub-keys thereof, 
and "TL.bitmap2eps.convert.2019" is probably a further nested sub-key 
whose existence I cannot verify as I do not have TeX Live on this 
machine. The "H" of "Hkey" is probably "Handle" or "Hive".

Petr - It is not practical to use symlinks for .fmt files.
So, equivalently, I added the line to fmtutil.cnf (via csplain.tlpsrc)
  luacsplain luatex - -etex csplain.ini
luacsplain.fmt will be created in the usual way in installations, namely
by running
  luatex -ini -etex csplain.ini

Your previous pdfcsplain.fmt-made-with-luatex is unchanged, so it will
also be created and should be effectively identical.

I added links (copy in the case of win32) in the bin/* dirs for luacsplain.

In svn now (r50528), should all show up after tonight's build.

Hope it flies,
Karl

Hi,

today I installed tlpretest on a pristine laptop under Ubuntu 16.04.
(yes I know this is perhaps a bit self-contradictory, not sure,
I inherited the laptop by a concourse of circumstances)

install-tl warned me about /usr/local/texlive/2019 not being writable
but in fact, of course, there wasn't even /usr/local/texlive to start with

maybe the message could be clearer? something like "/usr/local/texlive/2019
does not exist and admin rights are needed to create it"

I was left pondering if I should have used sudo install-tl, but I had
no time to test, so I created /usr/local/texlive/2019 and as is
my habit from other contexts gave my account the full rights to it
(not that I recommend this, but in the past it helped me manage
more easily various incursions into tlpkg etc... ; drawback
was particularly with Emacs/AUCTeX when it opened on compilation
errors style files, which could well end up modified by unwary
user).

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

This has been the same since about 10+ years. We check the grand-parent
folder (/usr/local) for writability.

The message is correct, it is not writable and cannot be created.

Should the user then execute sudo install-tl ?

Correctness may not quite coincide with usefulness.

That is up to the user to decide. I don't care what is used.
Using sudo during installation requires using sudo on all tlmgr update
actions.

There is not one **correct** way.

Before installing TL many years ago I created /usr/local/texlive as
root and changed its ownership to me. Thus /usr/local is not writable
but /usr/local/texlive is and installation works.

Dear TeX Live contributors,

The footnote package is available within collection-latexrecommended (via mdwtools), but its modern replacement, footnotehyper, is only in collection-latexextra; this means that it is not available in the small scheme or BasicTeX. Would you consider moving it to the other collection?

If you are the only one who maintains the computer, just run

  sudo chown -R jfbu:users /usr/local

The directory /usr/local is for local additions and it's more secure
to install stuff as a mortal user.  sudo is useful in order to
maintain your Linux distribution.  In all other cases avoid being root
whenever possible.

 > > Should the user then execute sudo install-tl ?

The user has to decide himself.  There are many use cases and thus
many solutions.  Executing sudo install-tl is only one of them.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I cannot see how these two statements can be reconciled.? If "we" check 
the grand-parent folder (/usr/local) for writability, and Zden?k's 
/usr/local is not writable, then theTeX Live installer should report 
that /usr/local/texlive/2019 is not writable and refused to proceed.

If, as in JFBU's case, /usr/local/texlive/2019 does not exist, then by 
definition it is both writable and non-writable, since the empty set has 
all properties.? Thus the message is only partially correct, and is most 
certainly confusing.? "Does not exist and cannot be created" would be 
the correct diagnostic in these circumstances,

No. The installer needs to create /usr/local/texlive/2019. Although
there is a command for creating it together with the parents, it is
actually done step by step. /usr/local already exists. The first step
is creation of /usr/local/texlive. If /usr/local is not writable, it
fails. If /usr/local/texlive already exists, the installer creates
/usr/loca/ltexlive/2019, which means that only /usr/local/texlive has
to be writable. If it is, then /usr/local/texlive/2019 will also be
writable. You can change ownership and permissions in a similar way
even on Windows unless you have a home edition. Windows even offer to
set a directory writable but not readable.

Well, it is more difficult in reality of course... we check of course
whether we can create 2019 if .../texlive is already there ..., and if
not, we check whether we can create texlive, etc.

OK, but that was not clear from Norbert's message.? He wrote only of the 
first step (the testing of /usr/local for writeability), which in your 
case would fail.? He did not go in to enumerate the other steps you 
mention, so it seemed from his earlier message that the installer should 
have reported-and-aborted and this point.

It is a failure to delete a filetype. It is a long-standing problem
for which I have no solution. But since the association of filetype
with extension _is_ removed, it is of little consequence.

Such matters can be easily resolved using Piriform's "CCleaner<https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download>", a product which I treated with the greatest suspicion for more years than I can remember but which, having finally tested it on a system that could be trashed if needed, I now use regularly with no worries whatsoever.  It normally requires two passes to perform a full registry tidy.

It normally requires two passes to perform a full registry tidy.

Also, it is no problem to delete the registry key manually.

tlshell tries first to update tlmgr, which will cause a restart of
tlmgr, and _then_ update everything else.

True. but Bernhard's initial message (below) suggested to me that he did 
not know what "HKCU/Software/Classes/TL.bitmap2eps.convert.2019/" was, 
so suggesting that he hack the registry by hand would not be my first 
recommendation.

Hi Norbert,

Would it make sense to provide a script,

create-texlive-directory-at-default-location.sh,

which would attempt to create a writable /usr/local/texlive,
if that fails prompt the user

/usr/local/texlive does not exist and can't be created (rerun as sudo to create)
/usr/local/texlive exists but is not writable/executable (rerun as sudo to modify access rights)
/usr/local/texlive exists and is writable/executable, sub-directory 2019 created (you can proceed with ./install-tl)

In first two cases the sudo run would create the /usr/local/texlive then handover the access rights from root to the user, although I am not versed enough into those matters to know if the sudo executed script can recover the own:grp of the non-sudo user who issued sudo

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

?Actually I know, but when the issue came up during update, I thought it
worthwhile to report. You donot expect, however, all texlive users to be
able to hack the registry, and therefore, such situation should not
arise at all.

I endavoured to update my TeX Live 2019 pre-test installation for the first time a few moments ago, and having re-rsynch'd I then launched "TeX Live Manager" from Start Menu / Programs / TeX Live 2019 as adminstrator (since it won't launch at all in user mode).  It reported that TLMGR required updating, reported that it had updated and relaunched it, still reported that it required updating, and when I tried "Update all" was told :
location-url    C:/TeX/Live/2019/tlpretes    t

Can anyone advise, please ?

Does

  tlmgr option

return "tlpretes    t" instead of "tlpretest"?

tlshell checks the registry whether it needs privilege escalation,
and does some murky process token stuff to check whether it has
administrative permissions.

I guess that tlshell does not find the relevant registry entry,
otherwise you would have gotten a UAC prompt.

Maybe it was a search path problem, which should be fixed in the
latest upload.

Or maybe the TL tree is read-only for non-adminstrators, although I
think that would have led to different symptoms.

OK, I may try that.  But in the meantime I am performing a binary search on all TeX Lives from 2008 to date in order to find the year in which our Lexicon of Abbreviations & Ligatures in Greek Minuscule Hands ceased to compile, and to facilitate this I now have a new hierarchy, C:\TeX\Legacy\<year>.  If I move all older instances of TeX Live from C:\TeX\Live to C:\TeX\Legacy, do you think that use of the portable installation will still be necessary for TeX Live 2019 ?

<TL_root>/texmf.cnf.

OK, noted.  Thank you.

OK, since this is purely for testing purposes I will probably delete everything under C:\TeX\Live\2019, re-rsynch, start again and report back.

Well, in the past I have always installed as Administrator, but that has led to so many problems that this year I installed as myself (an intentionally non-privileged user).  I shall continue to use the latter option unless advised otherwise.  But is there really no debugging switch/aid/tool(s) for "tlshell" ?

Under windows, GUI language can be set only from within tlshell, not

But in the meantime I am performing a binary search on all TeX Lives from 2008 to date in order to find the year in which our Lexicon of Abbreviations & Ligatures in Greek Minuscule Hands ceased to compile, and to facilitate this I now have a new hierarchy, C:\TeX\Legacy\<year>.  If I move all older instances of TeX Live from C:\TeX\Live to C:\TeX\Legacy, do you think that use of the portable installation will still be necessary for TeX Live 2019 ?

Try to copy, not move, and then uninstall the original. This will
remove start menu entries, file associations, the uninstaller
registry key and, if you copy as a regular user, make the copy
writable. You might also check texmf.cnf in the root and add or
modify settings for TEXMFLOCAL, TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR. You
might also want to add settings for TEXMFHOME, TEXMFCONFIG and
TEXMFVAR, but these directories may not be used at all. Clicking
tl-tray-menu in the root of the installation will give you a
temporary menu. You can have any number of such installations which
will not get in each other's way.

Personally, I first try to narrow down the problem by trying
different things. Then I insert debug statements in the front end or
the back end or both.

In the options menus of tlshell there are entries for papersize and
language which open a choice menu. In this choice menu it is not
visible which option is currently selected. 

(I normally don't use the shell but do updates on the command line,
I only thought I should check at least once how the GUI looks today
and so don't know what I should expect here).

I'm on windows 10.

One quick update ? On performing a clean "install-TL-advanced.bat" just 
now, I re-configured TEXMFHOME, then selected "More"; my change to 
TEXMFHOME was lost.
And a question :? the (advanced) installer pre-selects "After install, 
set CTAN as source for package updates".? As this is pre-test, is CTAN 
not the wrong place ?

And a follow-up:? the dialogue boxes of the new installer are an 
enormous improvement over those of previous generations; one can 
consistently select / overtype / confirm / etc, whereas before 
interactions appeared to be almost random in the effect that they had or 
did not have.? So thank you very much for this.? I can now carry out a 
TeX Live 2019 (pre-test)? installation/configuration without having to 
worry as to whether my click-at-end / drag-to-start / over-type had or 
had not had the desired effect, or whether I needed to ensure that the 
insertion point was at the end before I could reliably click "[OK]" 
rather than having to use one or more <return>s.

As far as I know, ugmm8a.pfb has never been in TeX Live.

Thank you Enrico; a configuration error on my part.? ugmm8a.pfb was 
indeed in C:\TeX\Legacy\TeX-MF\Local but the configuration file for TL 
2013 was incorrect; all now typesets correctly in TL 2013 but not in 
some later revisions ? I shall continue to seek the cause of the latter.

Message-ID: <2F85DB91-0F98-4A10-AC04-851F12B1BD80@icloud.com>

Mac users who install with MacTeX will not see the default graphical interface activated this year;  I use it to create the MacTeX package but they just use that package. Therefore it falls to me to give a collective "THANKS!" to everyone who worked on the interface. It is is clear and intuitive. Small changes like this make a big difference for users.

Mac users who stick with older systems will see the interface; they will like it.

We do not put the full MacTeX on the DVD because that would essentially add a second copy of TeX Live to the disk and waste space. Instead we install GUI apps, Ghostscript, and the TeX Dist data with a much smaller installer, and then tell users to install TeX Live from a terminal using the command 

	cd /Volumes/TEXCOL2019/texlive
	sudo ./install-tl --profile /Volumes/TEXCOL2019/mactex/MacTeX-Install/TLprofiles/texlive.profile

I just tested this and it still works well. In past years, the installer's output appeared in Terminal. Now the installer puts up a window for output and the output appears in that window rather than in Terminal. That's not a problem.

There is one tiny glitch. If it could be fixed, that would be great, but if not, OK:

When the installer first runs, it puts up a picture of the TeX Lion. That picture is then removed during installation. But if installation uses a profile, then the interface to select various options never appears and so the Lion appears for a couple of seconds and immediately vanishes. This can puzzle users who are already scared that they are being forced to use a Terminal. Perhaps the Lion could remain hidden if a profile is provided.

I know for years it is bad to install texlive with sudo. Nonetheless, I
always end up installing it with sudo as I get the kind of messages
Jean-Fran?ois described (I'm an average linux user). So thank you for
bringing this topic once again: now I understand what to do.

For the average user like me, I kindly suggest to support Jean-Fran?ois's
proposal for a script and/or to modify install-tl in order to make the
process easier to understand.

BTW, thank for all the work done for TeXlive.

Best regards

Message-ID: <a4f780475fab680a0d5dc88de9958e2561d1c2b6.camel@cs.tu-dortmund.de>

Hi,

I hope this is the correct place to report issues with TeXLive's
Lua(La)TeX -- if not, I would be grateful to be redirected to an
appropriate venue! If it is, however, read on...

When attempting to create PDF/A-3a compliant PDFs using LuaLaTeX, after
some configuration, VeraPDF [1] (an open source PDF/A compliance
checker) only flagged a single issue, namely a violation of clause
6.2.11.4 in the ISO 19005-3:2012 specification. The spec demands that a
subfont's CIDSet must -- if present -- match the CIDs mapped in the
CID-to-GID mapping.

After some debugging, I discovered that LuaTeX always maps CID 0 to GID
0 in the created PDF; however, the CIDSet writing code (writecff.c)
explicitly excludes CID 0 from being marked in the CIDSet. Modifying
the loops to include CID 0 into the CIDSet [2] creates a compliant PDF,
as does disabling CIDSet writing altogether [3].

Inspecting the PDF (using a debugger to inspect VeraPDFs internal state
[4]) shows that the CIDSet only contains CID 115, while the CID-GID
mapping contains 0->0 and 115->1. The 0->0 mapping is present for every
font written by LuaLaTeX for documents using more than one font.

Since I do not know if the 0->0 mapping serves any technical purpose, I
am not certain how to correctly resolve this issue; I suspect that
either the mapping should be fixed or the CIDSet should be corrected.
See [5] for a MWE demonstrating the issue. The issue can be reproduced
using versions 1.07.0 (tl 2018) and 1.10.0 (tlpretest 2019). It also
occurs for the PDF/A-2a compliance level. PDF/A-1a and all PDF/A-*b
levels do not demand CIDSet completeness; the created PDFs are
compliant.

This looks like the same issue I had: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/474197/pdfx-incomplete-cidset-in-some-fonts/474336?

If so, a simple \pdfvariable omitcidset=1 will do the trick

I spent quite some time tracking this problem down, and I was quite surprised that pdfx does not take care of this already when you select the respective pdf variant.

Hi,

when a file texmf-config/tlmgr/config exists with

require-verification=1

(inherited by copy paste from a TL2018 config)

one gets

$ tlmgr conf

tlmgr: The options verify-downloads and require-verification have
tlmgr: been superseded by verify-repo, please use only the latter!


and tlmgr refuses to update

$ tlmgr update --list

tlmgr: The options verify-downloads and require-verification have
tlmgr: been superseded by verify-repo, please use only the latter!

However, no indication is given that the problem comes
from a config file.

This may confuse aging users, although in the case at
hand the step of creating texmf-config/tlmgr/config in 2019/
may a be recent act, still, it could be better to add
something such as

tlmgr: (check tlmgr configuration files; cf tlmgr man page or --help)

as a pointer to further action,

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Hmm ... I don't want to add these kind of things for each and every
misconfiguration, but I leave judgment to others.

Yes, right. But apologies, it actually came from my TL2017 config,
for some reason I find no such tlmgr/config in my TL2018, however
I fiddled last month with all my TL20xx as I needed to make space
and moved them to external storage. I my have fiddled then
by cleaning up that config file (as I removed all tlmgr backups
or other temp files).

I understand, but imagine some malicious person placed that
config, imagine that I don't have access rights to 2019/texmf-config/tlmgr
as is default if installation was done by an sudo user with admin
rights and perhaps I have no admin rights.

Surely this can wait and see if people get into this issue : I concur
probability is very weak.

Well, the one who installs TL can put files into
2019/texmf-config/tlmgr, but could also change pdflatex to a shell
script that does rm -rf $HOME ... ;-)

Hi Brian,

    TeXLive Pretest 2019 without fontenc: Type 1C font.
    TeXLive Pretest 2019 with fontenc: Type 3 font with bad bounding boxes.

Do you have cm-super installed? (And, perhaps running pdflatex would
illuminate the situation. Or perhaps not.)

I get Type 1 fonts in both cases. But with fontenc, sfrm1000.pfb is
used. Without fontenc, I get the ams cmr10.pfb. This is as expected.

Why you're getting the bad bounding boxes in the fontenc case, I can't
say without seeing what actually went awry. --best, karl.

P.S. Specifically, with fontenc (tl19 pretest), I get:

> Do you have cm-super installed?  

I was testing a minimal install.  It's fine with cm-super installed.

The following will be added to the next version of the lwarp package to
handle the situation.  If using DVI or PDF latex, the font is cmr, and
cm-super is not loaded, it tries to load lmodern, else it errors and tells
the user how to fix the problem.

They may be a bug in xpdf.  My version is a few years old.

Hi there,

I have a small installation.  I installed texdoc extra:

$ sudo tlmgr install texdoc
tlmgr install: package already present: texdoc

but

$ texdoc

Opdracht 'texdoc' niet gevonden, maar deze kan worden ge?nstalleerd met:

sudo apt install texlive-base

Seems like tlmgr is not putting it in the path?

Please point me somewhere else if that is a better place to get help.

Or, your installation doesn?t have read permission for all users.

Apparently, you have tlmgr on your path as sudo. Do you maybe have a
different path as sudo than as a normal user? E.g. type
 echo $PATH
and
 sudo echo $PATH

If you just want to get at the installed documentation, then open
doc.html in the root of the installation, which lists all the pdf-
and html documentation.

Subject: tug::historic mirror?
Message-ID: <201903262139.x2QLd9A4013941@freefriends.org>

Although not strictly related to TeX Live, I will ask here anyway: if
anyone runs a well-connected server with ample disk space, and would be
willing to mirror the "historic" area of tug.org for public consumption,
please let me know. It's currently some 185GB, and will only grow.

Right now there is only one mirror at Utah (thanks Nelson). Since this
is the way that people get old releases of TeX Live / MacTeX, it would
be good to have more.

On tug, it's only available via rsync and ftp, and tug's anonymous ftp
is severely restricted due to resource limitations. Nelson is available
to make it available by http
(http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/mactex/), which is
clearly more convenient for most.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi,

Thanks for the help, although I found that trick out the hard way.
(Footnote [3] is the Lua-based way to achieve the same.)

My point is: I think that LuaLaTeX might be sort-of misbehaving here
and disabling CIDSet writing just works around the issue. Instead of
(just) adding the workaround to pdfx, it might be preferable if the
underlying issue in the font writing code could be addressed by the
LuaLaTeX developers.

Subject: will dvisvgm ship with support for PostScript specials (Windows,
 Mac OS)?
Message-ID: <9749F3E8-DA80-406B-8F6C-4AF47009A7C7@free.fr>

Hi,

I apologize in advance for vagueness: a friend of mine
on Windows reported, if I understand correctly, that
TL2018 dvisvgm.exe does not work with PostScript specials.

I don't know whether he tested out the TL2019 pretest.
The darwinglegacy one seems to have no such support either

$ /Library/TeX/texbin/dvisvgm --version=yes
dvisvgm 2.6.3
-------------
brotli:    1.0.7
clipper:   6.2.1
fontforge: 20160721
freetype:  2.9.1
kpathsea:  6.3.1
potrace:   1.15
xxhash:    0.6.5
zlib:      1.2.11

It is very useful to have dvisvgm supporting Postscript specials
like in this case (MacPorts dvisvgm)

$ dvisvgm --version=yes
dvisvgm 2.6.2 (x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0)
-----------------------------------------
brotli:      1.0.7
clipper:     6.2.1
fontforge:   20160721
freetype:    2.9.1
Ghostscript: 9.26
kpathsea:    6.3.0
potrace:     1.15
xxhash:      0.6.5
zlib:        1.2.11

What is then status on Windows (and Mac OS) for TL2019 ?

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

To be more precise the situation as I tested now is

processing of PostScript specials is disabled (Ghostscript not found)

which means it is always possible to use option 

--libgs=filename          set name of Ghostscript shared library


I had forgotten this since last year. (and as I use MacPorts version)

Thus it is possible to use the TL2019 shipped dvisvgm
on legacy Mac OS with Postscript via --libgs,

But I don't know the Windows situation which was my main 
question on behalf of my correspondant,

And would TeXLive consider shipping fully enabled dvisvgm
or are there technical obstacles related to Ghostscript?

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

dvisvgm for Windows in TeX Live 2018, and 2019 supports PostScript specials.
In the case of TL-2018,  I updated dvisvgm after the first release.
Therefore I think that a frienf of you has an old dvisvgm.

In TL-2018 and TL-2019, gsdll32.dll is loaded as follows:
(1) If gsdll32.dll is written in the registry, dvisvgm reads it.
(2) If a user does not install his own Ghostscript, gsdll32.dll
     is loaded from the preinstalled Ghostscript.

In the present TL-2019,
dvisvgm -Vy
shows:

dvisvgm 2.6.3 (TeX Live 2019/W32TeX)
------------------------------------
brotli:      1.0.7
clipper:     6.2.1
fontforge:   20160721
freetype:    2.9.1
Ghostscript: 9.26
kpathsea:    6.3.1
potrace:     1.15
xxhash:      0.6.5
zlib:        1.2.11

where, user-installed Ghostscript does not exist, so preinstalled gsdll32.dll is loaded.

In the case of 64bit dvisvgm, users should install
64bit Ghostscript, since the preinstalled Ghostscript is 32bit.

Thanks,
Akira

We build a ton of third-party libraries. I don't know how challenging
it would be to add GhostScript's sources to the TL build, but even if
it's technically feasible and nobody would object it, someone needs to
do the work of integrating the sources to our build tree.

In MacPorts ghostscript depends on the following libraries:
    expat, fontconfig, freetype, jbig2dec, jpeg, libiconv, libidn,
libpaper, libpng, tiff, zlib, lcms2, xorg-libXext, xorg-libXt
plus a runtime dependency on Perl (no idea what for).

Maybe one could disable X11, but there's still a bunch of others
missing which would also need integration. Having ghoscript available
would benefit other binaries too (asymptote among others, but
definitely not the only one), not just dvisvgm.

It's non-trivial in any case, but if someone would integrate it,
maybe. Until there's a volunteer for that job, the answer will likely
stay "no".

Thanks a lot for these detailed explanations.

In the meantime I got this report from my correspondant to whom I had
indicated https://dvisvgm.de/FAQ/

(this refers to his TeXLive 2018 install)

This is perfectly reasonable. Thanks (and I now remember last year
you already explained similar context). I had completely forgotten
the details related to dvisvgm (as I started actively using it
again only a few days ago), and I tested now on my Mac OS 10.9.5
with the TL2019 pretest :

$ /Library/TeX/texbin/dvisvgm --libgs=/opt/local/lib/libgs.dylib testps.dvi
pre-processing DVI file (format version 2)
processing page 1
  graphic size: 3.60001pt x 3.60001pt (1.265259mm x 1.265259mm)
  output written to testps.svg
1 of 1 page converted in 0.324621 seconds

which works fine.

Also

$ LIBGS=/opt/local/lib/libgs.dylib /Library/TeX/texbin/dvisvgm testps.dvi
pre-processing DVI file (format version 2)
processing page 1
  graphic size: 3.60001pt x 3.60001pt (1.265259mm x 1.265259mm)
  output written to testps.svg
1 of 1 page converted in 0.321718 seconds

works.

A few weeks ago I cleaned up my disk and removed my MacPorts texlive-binaries
but installed separately their dvisvgm package because I needed it to work
and I had completely forgotten the above. (which used the MacPorts installed
Ghostscript)

I realize now from the above quick test
I could simply set LIBGS in my .bash_profile to use the
dvisvgm from your contributed binaries

As the dvisvgm FAQ page  https://dvisvgm.de/FAQ/ primarily mentions
Linux and Windows, perhaps the info of this thread will be useful
to others (MacOS X being unix-like one may consider the Linux
explanations cover it).

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

I tried updating today with tlshell on MacOS (darwinlegacy).
What I noticed is that the ?Logs? window doesn?t scroll
automatically.

Not a big deal, but maybe it can be solved.

Where are the localizations stored? I could
contribute for the Italian localization,
that is very partially implemented ATM.

Ciao

    incorrectly linked executables on FreeBSD

Thanks for the report.

I don't use FreeBSD, so I can't solve it, sorry. I can only report that
Nikola compiled last year's binaries on FreeBSD 10.
http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-2018/

whereas this year's binaries are compiled by Mojca on FreeBSD 11.
http://dl.contextgarden.net/build/texlive/
http://build.contextgarden.net/waterfall?tag=c/texlive

I'm only guessing, but it sounds like using shared lib foo.x on an older
system may fail on the newest system because only .x+1 is available, or
because of indirect dependencies (likely through fontconfig) on .x or .x+1.

I hope Nikola or Mojca can reply with more facts/help. --best, karl.

C:/Users/pablo/texmf.cnf is not read by default,
as you see by kpsewhich --all texmf.cnf.
Try to set an environment variable TEXMFCNF as

set TEXMFCNF=c:/Users/pablo;

Note that the last semicolon is important.

Asy rebuild has not been attempted yet (and I experience the same
issues with the old binary; which wouldn't even work as it's an old
version anyway).

However I'm unable to reproduce the problem on xetex. For me it links
against libfreetype 6.

How old is this report / attempt? Can the binaries (other than asy and
xindy) be checked again?

The TeX Live 2019 (pre-test) installer continues to throw up a blank 
(and apparently unused) CMD window throughout the course of the 
installation.
Still true as of today.

Hi,

a few days back I noticed that the texmf.cnf at top level of texlive/2019 contained a duplicate line

TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local

same in the lua version.

Maybe this "issue" has since been solved, it dates back to installation time I think on March 22.

I talked to Nikola last year about this. It wasn't really clear to him 
why this happens at all. I tried the last years with 10.4-STABLE and 
11.2-STABLE same outcome. His jail must be different to the libs the 
ports system is providing.

I will have a look at this.

Shouldn't the case beause the ports system is OS-independent.

Still unable to launch the TeX Live Manager (TL-2019, pre-test) as myself (see screenshotbelow & attached); it will launch successfully only as Administrator.  Since I last reported this during this year's pre-test phase, I have :

  *   Re-ownered C:\TeX to myself
  *   Granted owner full control over C:\TeX and all descendants thereof
  *   Migrated all TeX Live installations from 2008 to 2017 to C:\TeX\Legacy\<year> (I have no earlier installations installed)
  *   Migrated the current TeX Live installation (2018) to C:\TeX\Live
  *   Installed TeX Live 2019 (pre-test) in C:\TeX\Lambda

I investigated Siep's suggestion to install TeX Live 2019 (pre-test) in portable mode but was not happy with the paths that it proposed, and was not certain whether if I modified those paths it would still be "portable" within the meaning of the Act.

This has been reproduced after a year again. It is brand new. I have set 
up a new jail with 12-RELEASE on 12-STABLE and installed with tlinstall 
interactively. The executables have been pulled from the internet and 
not compiled by me:

I have now installed TL 2019 pretest into the same jail and see 
definitively improvements:

Yes, TeX Live 2018 is "known to be broken" and there likely won't be
any update (it would require quite a bit of hacking to fix the
packages for the frozen archive, and then this would only be available
for about a month (maybe even less), and then replaced with TeX Live
2019). These problems should have been reported at least a month back
to fix them easily, at this point it's probably not worth the trouble.

Great.

> but asy still broken:

Yes, that's fully expected, as explained earlier.
We need to definitely rebuild asy (it hasn't been touched since more
than one year), but there are a number of build issues with the latest
version (2.48) at the moment, so it might take a while before I can
build it in the desired way.

Is any other binary broken for you?

> Are you really linking against USES=readline?

No clue. This was last built more than a year ago.

No actually, I ran find(1) with ldd(1) on all executables and they seem 
fine now except for asy.

Would be great if you could doublecheck. This should resolve the issue.

Looking foward for another round of executables.

Subject: Request for a higher resolution image of the lion in installer
Message-ID: <CALBOmsaYxv2a1qiR9V9aH_UJP+mGeEv4hM7d5Nb5CkxmV-2q0g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Siep,

I would like to request a slightly higher resolution of the lion image
for the installer, if possible. On Mac it looks relatively bad
compared to other programs, see the attached screenshot. Honestly it
took me quite a while to figure out that was supposed to be a lion, I
just kept wondering where the strange blocky image came from.

(I don't know how Tk handles images on different OSes. I assume that
on Windows or Linux one might never see anything but a tiny icon in
the top left corner, but on Mac you see it when tabbing between apps,
and esp. on high resolution screens and big magnifications that might
look like something from the previous century.)

Trying to gain further insights into the following, I though to see what options "TLshell" would accept.  As it did not seem to recognise "[-]-help" or "[-]-?", I thought to try "TeXdoc TLshell".  It said nothing.  Puzzled, I tried "TeXdoc XeTeX", which I have used many many times with previous versions of TeX Live. Again, it did nothing.  Cany anyone offer any insights into this very disturbing behaviour, please ?  And is "TLMGR.bat" still supported, or should it be removed from the distribution ?

Thanks for the answer, maybe it's better to use:
SETX TEXMFCNF C:/Users/pablo;
PS: I did not find any example of this in the documentation ... maybe
it could be added, although it is true that computers with linux are
(most of the time) of a single user, today it is usual to have more
than one account .

Hello friends,

If anyone is interested, I could gladly share the lion I used for the 
TeXtalk interview series. I attached a sample image. Since the source is 
in SVG, we could create images of arbitrary size...

Cheerio,

Paulo

Subject: Suggestion to support TeXDist symlink creation on Macs out-of-the-box
Message-ID: <CALBOmsbnnTKXUHe6f_aahsm8Ypoq+d5QUh4kEMuSyg3RBFmw+g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Norbert & others,

The TeX Live installer is currently offering the option "Create
symlinks in standard directories" [1].

I'm aware that it's usually not desirable to use that option, but an
alternative has been present in the Mac(TeX) world for years. It
usually creates some semi-complex structure (too complex for my taste,
but let's forget about the details) which basically boils down to
creating a symlink to the TeX distribution of choice at a standard
location (/Library/TeX/texbin), and then adding that location to PATH.
That's not much different from what TeX Live is trying to tell the
user to do, except that when done in the "TeXDist way", there are a
bunch of tools that allow the user to switch between different
distributions and most TeX editors are fully aware of that standard
path and work out of the box even if that path doesn't get explicitly
specified. From the console it works out of the box without editing
bash profile.

This is a version that Dick sent me in 2017 and I adapted it to
support both regular and legacy binaries (but I didn't update it for
2018 or 2019 yet; I'm sure that Dick has an updated version though,
it's also part of MacTeX).

    https://github.com/TeXLive-M/TeXDist/blob/master/scripts/postinstall

My question is mostly: would it be possible to simplify this a bit and
integrate it into tlmgr, so that users could select that (non-default)
option during installation? We would of course need to discuss what is
really needed, but basically it's just about creating a bunch of
symlinks.

Thank you,
    Mojca

[1] I'm currently unable to check that option even if run the
installer under sudo. When I click "Specify directories", it says that
the installer cannot write to /usr/local/share/man, but that's just
because that folder doesn't exist. Shouldn't the installer attempt to
create that directory instead of saying that it's not able to write
it?

Per the Human Interface Guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/icons-and-images/app-icon/>, 10 images are needed for Retina and non-Retina Macs.

People over at Python seems to encountered a similar issue with Aqua Tk <https://bugs.python.org/issue32129>

Hi,

The same project build with TeXLive 2019 issues

but not with TeXLive 2018.

Where should I go look for source of problem (if any)?

    My question is mostly: would it be possible to simplify this a bit and
    integrate it into tlmgr, so that users could select that (non-default)
    option during installation? 

tlmgr and the installer are two different things, although I suppose
most likely we'd want it both places, since everything seems to end up
in both.

As far as the installer goes, it does not sound too impossible to have
an option in the <O> menu (ditto GUIs) that would only appear on Macs
and perform the texdist postaction at the end. tlmgr could have
something that calls it also.

But let's not try to make all that happen right now. After the release,
when we can work on it without it being on the critical path. --thanks, karl.

Hi Jean-Fran?ois,

Is it possible to provide console output of dvipdfmx invoked
with the "-vv" option supplied?
Also, the following information would be helpful:
- processing XeTeX output?
- font used in your document.

Thanks,

Hi,

after some giant and dichotomy I reduced to the following MWE

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{newtxmath}

\begin{document}

$\varepsilon$

% triggered by \eTeX from scrdoc class

\end{document}


In my context I was using \eTeX macro, I had forgotten it 
actually came with scrdoc class but anyway the important
thing is that it does $\varepsilon$ and newtxmath 
package was loaded.

I am not using xetex, only latex temp.tex and then:

$ dvipdfmx -vv temp.dvi

Since we don't seem to be making much progress with the various bugs I 
have reported concerning TeX Live 2019 (pre-test), I though that as I 
was in the office today I might see whether I can replicate these 
problems on another Win-7 64-bit machine.? I then realised that even to 
test the most basic functionality (can I install to locations of my 
choice, can I successfully run TLMGR as other than Administrator, are 
TeXdoc and TeXdocTK functional, ...), I have to download ("Rsynch") the 
entire pre-test repository.

Given that testing the infrastructure and testing the layered products 
are very different exercises, might it not be better to start the 
pre-test phase by populating the pre-test repository with only the 
/*necessary*/ and */sufficient/* (infrastructure) components, adding the 
layered products (packages, class files, fonts, etc) only once the 
infrastructure has been widely tested and proved robust ?

create a suitable Mac icon file from it?

Hi Jean-Fran?ois,

I identified the cause of this problem.
There should be no problem in output PDF but dvipdfmx wrongly issues
a warning.

Problem description:
Dvipdfmx is unnecessarily trying to create an empty ToUnicode CMap,
and as a result, it wrongly issues a warning.

It will be fixed soon.

Thanks,
Shunsaku Hirata

TeXdocTK also fails in an identical way on a clean install on an office 
machine (Win-7, 64-bit).

Subject: "command_line_encoding=utf8" in texmf.cnf on windows?
Message-ID: <10jdfsqlhqjns.dlg@nililand.de>

The next latex format will contain code to improve handling of
non-ascii file names (the code can be already tested by inputing 
utf8andspace.tex from
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/tree/utf8andspace/base). 

For me on windows 10 it only works if I add 
  command_line_encoding=utf8 
to my texmf.cnf.

Would it make sense to add this as default to the cnf? Or to have an
option somewhere to enable it?

This is expected. We believe that doc.html in the root of the
installation is a good alternative for searching for documentation.

The windows installer adds a shortcut named `TeX Live documentation'
to index.html which in its turn contains a link to doc.html, and the
tray menu for portable use contains a direct link to doc.html as a
replacement for texdoctk.  There is also no longer a menu shortcut
for texdoctk.

By the way: I am still tinkering with the windows wrapper for
tlshell, which may or may not solve your problem.

Thank you for that feedback, Siep.  Unfortunately launching C:\TeX\Lambda\doc.html, then following the link to XeTeX and clicking on XeTeX itself takes me to a directory listing:

  *   file:///C:/TeX/Lambda/texmf-dist/doc/man/man1

In TeX Live 2018, texdoctk was fully functional, which is how/why I was able to recommend it to Michael Barr when he needed a GUI route to "TeXdoc enumerate" :

Start / Computer / C-Drive (probably) / texlive (probably) / 2018 (probably) / bin / win32 /
Double-click on "texdoctk.exe" / Database search / Enter "enumerate" / Hit <return> / Select second entry = "Extended enumeration style ( enumerate)".
Done.

In TeX Live 2019, that is no longer possible.  Has TeXdoctk been intentionally disabled, or is it simply an unfortunate side-effect of some deeper change ?


By the way: I am still tinkering with the windows wrapper for

Thank you, I appreciate that.

Scrolling down a few lines, you'll find xetexref, which happens to
be a separate package.

If you browse the alphabetically sorted list of packages looking for
something like enumerate, you'll find enumitem. The short
descriptions are also all there.

The CTAN catalogue can also be useful to find things.

> In TeX Live 2019, that is no longer possible.  Has TeXdoctk been intentionally disabled, or is it simply an unfortunate side-effect of some deeper change ?

It requires Perl/Tk, which is no longer included.  I just dropped
the no-GUI restriction from runscript.tlu, so as of tomorrow's
update you should be able to run texdoctk _if_ you have an external
perl with Perl/Tk included.

    folder doesn't exist. Shouldn't the installer attempt to create that
    directory instead of saying that it's not able to write it?

I don't know if the GUI code is doing its own writable checks, but in
the text installer, I can't reproduce this. I tried specifying putting
symlinks in a test directory /opt/tl/local/bin (with o l), where neither
that nor /opt/tl/local existed, and the installer dutifully created
both directories. /opt/tl itself has to be writable.

In tlpkg/TLUtils.pm, function add_link_dir_dir, the second line calls
mkdirhier on the destination. If that fails, it's supposed to write a
warning (two lines down). If it succeeds, and -w still fails, that is
odd. Maybe you could put in some debugging messages to see what's
happening in your case ... -k

(TLUtils.pm)

sub add_link_dir_dir {
  my ($from,$to) = @_;
  my ($ret, $err) = mkdirhier ($to);
  if (!$ret) {
    tlwarn("$err\n");
..

Thanks, is there anyway to test that easily with an already existing installation,
or one would have to re-use the installer ?
Best, J.-F.

You have to use the installer and make a fresh installation. There is
nothing that will remove that line once it is there in the two files.

Alternatively you can just delete the line yourself and move on ... -k
