Subject: MetaType1 in TeX Live
Message-ID: <20190602145104.w4eh75ar72gm6tix@yoga>

Hello everyone,

I about to publish a package which uses some files from MetaType1,
especially their MetaPost files. In this context I noticed that
MetaPost1 is included in TeX Live, but *only* as a source bundle and the
files are not extracted into the usual directory structure.

Is there any particular reason for this packaging?

Best regards,
Marcel Kr?ger

As far as I know, it's written as DOS batch scripts and thus does not
support any other platform. So I never unpacked it. -k

I already used MetaType1 version 0.48 on Linux in 2008.

According to the svn log, you uploaded version 0.56 in 2015.  I don't
think that much had been changed since 2008.

The batch files are not needed on Unix but I must admit that I wrote a
little shell script:

 | #!/bin/sh
 |
 | FONT=mpmarkers
 | MT1DIR=./mt1
 |
 | mpost "\generating:=0; \input $FONT.mp" &&
 | gawk -f $MT1DIR/mp2pf.awk -vCD=./pfcommon.dat -vNAME=$FONT &&
 | gawk -f $MT1DIR/packsubr.awk -vVERBOSE=1 -vLEV=5 -vOUP=$FONT.pn $FONT.p &&
 | t1asm -b $FONT.pn $FONT.pfb &&
 | mpost "\generating:=1; \input $FONT.mp"

If MetaType1 is supposed to work out of the box in TeX Live on all
platforms we need an awk binary for Windows.  ATM it's easier to use
on Unix.  The awk scripts are not portable and have to be adapted
manually.  I have:

 | BEGIN {
 | # HEAD
 |  CONSOLE="/dev/tty"
 | # for MS-DOS you may use:
 | #  CONSOLE="CON"

No idea why printing to stdout isn't sufficient.

Karl, before you invest any time, let's consult Jacko.  The version we
have in TeX Live only creates Type 1 fonts but Jacko nowadays creates
OpenType.  Thus I fear that what we have in TeX Live isn't up to date.

On the other hand I fear that Jacko's current workflow has too many
dependencies on external software which makes it difficult to be
included in TeX Live.

If we really want to add a MetaType1 package to TeX Live which works
out of the box, we have to do a few things.  If awk doesn't know on
which system it's running, we need two versions of the scripts and a
texlua wrapper similar to "rungs" for Ghostscript.  And as I proved in
tlgs (Ghostscript for Windows) already, all MS-DOG batch files can be
replaced easily by texlua scripts which work on all platforms.

Jacko, what do you think?  Does it make sense to support the old
version one way or another or should we wait for something newer?

Regards,
  Reinhard

While the official interface consists of batch scripts, they just glue
some AWK scripts and a Perl script together and call MetaPost with the
right parameters, so most parts are pretty cross-platform compatible.
Also the MetaPost code can be used independently. Maybe at least the
MetaPost components could be extracted?

Awk scripts are easily translated to Perl, and we do have Perl in the
Windows distribution.

The please, if it is so easy, could someone please step forward and
provide cross platform Perl scripts that does the whole job? We will
surely incorporate them if they provide extra value.

Lua scripts are perfectly fine, we use them for several pieces in TL. If you have something and explanations how to use it, please let us know!

Message-ID: <AM0PR06MB4147DCE3E5DB86CDDD7E702CE5140@AM0PR06MB4147.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,



The ?--aux-directory? is a convenient flag provided by MikTeX?s version of ?pdflatex?.  This leaves the generated PDF file in the root of the main project, while moving other generated files to the aux directory.



TeXLive only has the ?--output-directory? option, which we know is not quite the same (doesn?t play well with `\include` etc). Can TeXLive developers consider adding this option as a feature request in Tl2020?



Regards,

Krishna

Personally I will stay away from Perl scripts, mostly because of my very
limited Perl skills. On the other hand, what caused me to start this
whole thread is that I wrote a Lua library which tries to directly transform
a MetaType1 font to a LuaTeX compatible format. (It doesn't create a
freestanding font right now, mostly because I didn't need that yet.)
This is completely cross-platform compatible so maybe that is good
enough. Anyway, I would like to avoid having to copy the existing
MetaType1 MetaPost files.

Marcel

Hi Boris,
do you have automatic translation in mind?  I tried

  $ a2p mp2pf.awk > mp2pf.pl
  syntax error in file mp2pf.awk at line 360
  Translation aborted due to syntax errors.

  $ a2p pf2mt1.awk > pf2mt1.pl
  Please check my work on the 50 lines I've marked with "#???".
  The operation I've selected may be wrong for the operand types.

I doubt that there is a syntax error in mp2pf.awk, it's more likely
that a2p doesn't parse the file properly.

However, we already have packages written in other languages than Perl
or Lua in TL.  pdfjam, for instance, is a set of shell scripts.
Though I personally prefer that everything works the same way on all
platforms, I don't mind if Windows users have to install a program
externally in order to execute some scripts which are only needed by a
few experts.

I just looked into the gawk package provided by Eli Zaretskii

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/

It's dynamically linked and comes with a few awk scripts.  If it can
be linked statically and the scripts are not needed it wouldn't be a
big deal to include a binary into TL.

BTW, there is an undocumented feature in the Ghostscript distribution
for Windows I maintain for TL:

  tlpkg/tlgs/lib/afmdiff.awk

This is a script written by Nelson Beebe decades ago.  It's buried in
the Ghostscript sources but I thought that it can't hurt to make it
available to users somehow.  Well, Windows users have to install awk
in order to use it.

But as I said before, if we really want to create a TL package which
can be used out of the box we should ask Jacko which version he
recommends.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    The ?--aux-directory? is a convenient flag

I'm sorry, but I am just not enthused about supporting this at the
engine level. It seems to me that anything that wants to control where
files end up is better using any of the zillions of front-end scripts
that do or can offer the feature. It seems pretty easy to me for a
script like latexmk to use -output-directory and then mv the final .pdf
(or .dvi) back to the main directory if that's what the user wants. It
is nowhere near as easy or reliable or secure to implement all that in
every engine for every os.

Also sorry, but I'm not convinced by your links that there is a problem
that should be fixed, or that there is a general problem with
\include. Clearly -aux-directory would be a convenience for some users,
but whether the convenience outweighs the complications is another
question. --best, karl.

Also, it's worth having a look at the latest distribution of latexmk.  It 
includes a configuration file fix-aux.latexmkrc that shows how to configure 
latexmk to support the -aux-directory option even when the underlying engine 
doesn't.  It even reproduces certain strange quirks of MiKTeX's implementation.

I meant semi-automatic translation:  a2p plus human intervention.

production and/or delivery, I continue with builds on various systems
in our machine farm of 250+ flavors of Unix.  This note is to draw
your attention to these two recent sections at our site:

	ClearLinux
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2019/README.html#clearlinux

	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2019/README.html#rhel-8

Both are reports of success, and both are for GNU/Linux distributions
from large corporations.  However, without additional software work at
Utah, TeX Live 2019 would not build completely on stock systems from
those distributions.

  Maybe someone could contact the authors of axessibility and explain
that their choice of licence means it can't be included in TeX Live?
It's not clear that this is deliberate.

  (I'm not volunteering as I already spend much more of time discussing
licences than I would like too, and I don't think I'll ever use the
package anyway.)

After today's update (reinstall of firamath after yesterday's removal)
lualatex doesn't find FiraMath-Regular.otf anymore, but xelatex does.

The following MWE works perfectly fine with xelatex. But with lualatex I
get

! Package fontspec Error: The font "FiraMath-Regular" cannot be found.

\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{FiraMath-Regular.otf}
\begin{document}
Test $a = b$.
\end{document}

I did mktexlsr and fc-cache -f but neither helped.

The font file definitely exists and kpsewhich also finds it.

I ran it in a command window with admin privileges (forgot to say that
it's Win7) but it didn't help. This was the output:

If the font is present, as you already wrote, then

voss at shania:~$ luaotfload-tool --find=firamath -F
luaotfload | resolve : Font "firamath" found!
luaotfload | resolve : Resolved file name 
"/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/firamath/FiraMath-Regular.otf"


should gi?e a similiar output.

It does. This is what I get:

C:\>luaotfload-tool --find=firamath -F
luaotfload | resolve : Font "firamath" found!
luaotfload | resolve : Resolved file name "c:/Programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/firamath/FiraMath-Regular.otf"

I'm at a loss with this ...

I found in

c:\Users\siart\.texlive2019\texmf-var\luatex-cache\generic\names\luaotfload-lookup-cache.lua

return {
 ["FiraMathRegular#717617"]={ "c:/programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fira/firamath-regular.otf", false },
 ["FiraMathRegular#717619"]={ "c:/programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fira/firamath-regular.otf", false },
 ["FiraMathRegular#717620"]={ "c:/programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fira/firamath-regular.otf", false },
 ["FiraMathRegular/B#b#717620"]={ "c:/programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fira/firamath-regular.otf", false },
 ["FiraMathRegular:mode=base;#655360"]={ "c:/programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fira/firamath-regular.otf", false },
 ["FiraMathRegular:mode=base;#717619"]={ "c:/programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fira/firamath-regular.otf", false },
 ["firamath#655360"]={ "c:/Programme1/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/firamath/FiraMath-Regular.otf", false },
}

There's /public/fira instead of /public/firamath.

Should I delete

c:\Users\siart\.texlive2019\texmf-var\luatex-cache\generic\names\luaotfload-names.lua.gz

(dates 06.06.2019)

so that it gets renewed?

Hi,

after successfully installing TeX Live 2019 (on Windows), I found a small typo in the German translation of the welcome message:

"Porjekt" should be "Projekt".

Hi Lorenz,

it has been fixed. Newer  versions of the installer should get the right
one.

Hi

I am not getting it right with biber. Two issues:

1. if I try >>> /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux/biber --help
 
I get 

Unicode::Collate object version 1.25 does not match bootstrap parameter 1.21 at
/loader/HASH(0x2221ce0)/DynaLoader.pm line 210.
Compilation failed in require at /loader/HASH(0x22212c0)/base.pm line 100.

BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at script/biber line 17.

(I still have texlive 2016, and /usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-linux/biber
--help works fine)
I suspect it is a Perl issue, but I do not know anything about perl. 

2. I use a php script, say my.php, to create a .tex file. It also calls latex,
(2016) biber, and pdflatex to produce final outputs.

If I run it from terminal - php cli, as root - it works fine. If I run it from a
web browser (http://localhost/my.php), biber does not seem to be called at all.
In the latter case, files are owned by user apache, and I suspect that biber
does not like that.  How do I fix it? 

Thanks
Cheers
mario

    1. if I try >>> /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux/biber --help

How about 2019? (Probably no better, but may as well try.)
You can download just that one binary without anything else from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/biblatex-biber/current/binaries/Linux/
(among other places).

    Unicode::Collate object version 1.25 does not match bootstrap
    parameter 1.21 at /loader/HASH(0x2221ce0)/DynaLoader.pm line 210.

Biber is distributed unusually -- as a self-unpacking binary which
includes all the myriad Perl packages it depends on, many of which need
compilation.  I surmise something on your system is too old to get
through that process (it doesn't work on my centos7, either), but that's
just my guess.

The best way I know of to report the problem to the biber maintainer
(Phil Kime) is to open a bug:
https://sourceforge.net/p/biblatex-biber/bugs/
(You can also find his email address on the web without too much
trouble, but I don't want to post it here.)

    In the latter case, files are owned by user apache, and I suspect
    that biber does not like that.  How do I fix it?

What matters is not the owner of the files as such, but whether the
user/group which Apache is running on (apache:apache, probably) has
permission to write the directories. Biber might try to write in some
temporary directory which apache cannot write to, but again, that's just
a guess. The error_log for your localhost web server would hopefully
have error messages about the actual problem. Maybe the PHP stuff also
plays into it. (If you change your script to write debugging messages to
standard error, they should also show up in the error_log.)

Good luck,
Karl

It works fine here.  I tested with Perl version 16.3 on CentOS 7 and
with Perl version 24.1 on Debian 9 (stretch) and with all TeX Live
releases from 2010 to 2019.  No problems at all.

Is /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux in PATH?  It has to be,
unconditionally.  You can call a particular program by specifying
its location on the command line.  But if this program depends on
other resources, it's mandatory that the TeX Live bin directory is in
PATH.

Please note that according to the error messages you got, some files
are at non-standard locations:

  /var/www/tmp/inc/lib/Unicode/Collate/Locale.pm
  /var/www/tmp/inc/lib/Biber/Internals.pm

I don't know why these files are looked up at /var/www/tmp at all if
you just type biber --help.  It seems that your Perl installation is
completely broken.

I suppose that

  which perl

returns

  /usr/bin/perl

Please run

  printenv | grep -i perl

, unset all Perl related environment variables and try again.

With a clean Perl installation Perl modules are never searched in
/var/www.

It's definitely a Perl issue.  But before you care about your web
server, make sure that /usr/bin/perl looks for modules in standard
directories (usually /usr/share or /usr/lib).

biber --help works here on CentOS 7, see my previous mail.  However,
it takes more than 10 seconds until something appears on screen, even
on a 4.6 GHz machine.  Did you give up too early?  :)

Hi

thanks for your reply.

My settings are such that:

> echo $PATH
/usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/root/b
in:/usr/local/texlive/2018:/usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux

> which perl
/usr/bin/perl

> perl -v

This is perl 5, version 28, subversion 2 (v5.28.2) built for x86_64-linux-
thread-multi (with 48 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

> printenv | grep -i perl
[empty]


how do I check that /usr/bin/perl looks for modules in standard
directories (usually /usr/share or /usr/lib)?


thanks
cheers

Dear Manager
I am the author of tikz-relay package and recently a user reported a
problem with the distribution. Apparently, the package is not
installable or searchable. I cannot verify the problem myself, I
actually a MikTex user and have little familiarity with TexLive.
Therefore, I would like to ask you to verify and take the required
measures.
Thank you for your kind attention and best regards
L.P. Laus

It got put in the doc tree by mistake, I'm sure the texlive team will
fix that soon.

I just run biber through strace and now I see that it doesn't use the
Perl installation at all.  It installs files in a temporary directory
and uses them, hence it's unclear to me why it behaves differently on
different machines.

I can see that biber obeys the variable TMPDIR.  It's obviously set to
/var/www/tmp on your machine, which is quite strange if you type biber
--help on the command line.  Did you run it as a normal user?  Only
your web server should use /var/www.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: After installation of TL 2019: Tlmgr claims that directory 2018 is
 not writable
Message-ID: <753d3a2e-8897-f4ab-fdbd-f833f267baef@tuwien.ac.at>

After successfully installing the latest TeXLive 2019 on a Windows 10 
system I encounter a strange problem: When calling tlmgr (actually it is 
tlshell), I receive the message "E:/texlive/2018 is not writable. You 
can probably not do much. Are you sure you want to continue?"

In the window I see the entries "Root at E:/texlive/2018", tlmgr: 
r49931, tlshell: r50042.

Of course, I start the program from the icon in the 2019 folder and TL 
is installed in e:/texlive/2019.

I couldn't find any setting, which might force the root at e:/texlive/2018.

Update: In the meantime I entered the command from the shell

tlshell option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

and now it looks fine. Also tlmgr and tlshell indicate newer versions 
(R51232, R51231). It seems, that starting tlmgr from the icon (Start 
menu -> TeX Live 2019 -> TeX Live Manager) causes the troubles, it calls 
the 2018 program, although the menu entry points to tlshell in the 2019 
tree.

Best wishes

Alois

It seems like a problem in PATH setting, it should contain the path to
e:/texlive/2019 but probably contains path to e:/texlive/2018 or both
with preference to 2018. My suggestion is to look first at the
environment setting, you may have a misprint or a relict from some old
installations.

Dear Zdenek,

thank you very much for the instantaneous and helpful reply! There was 
indeed a 2018 path entry in the mid of the system path, which was found 
before the 2019 entry in the user path. Now everything works fine.

With best wishes

Alois

I installed texlive 2019. Everything works fine (and faster), if I run my .php
script from terminal (and biber from therein). Instead, biber crashes if I call
the same  .php script from a web browser (localhost/myscript.php) 

For some reason I do not remember any more, my .bash_profile includes lines:
PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP=/var/www/tmp
export PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP

It does not fix to set PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP=/var/www/html/tmp

thanks

It can be a web server problem. I do not know which SW you use.
Remember that e.g. Apache does not expose your environment to the
CGI/PHP scripts unless they are set in the *.conf files by PassEnv
and/or SetEnv directives. For security reasons, /tmp and /var/tmp are
not used directly, a virtual filesystem is built there and files
created by one CGI/PHP process do not exist for another CGI/PHP
process. Thus you PHP script can see the file as /tmp/something but
the real file will be /tmp/somedir/something where somedir is
unpredictable. I have my own wrappers if I need to do such things.

Thanks, but I am not sure to know enough to understand. Need to do some more
homework :-)

I tried a MWE, a very simple php script:

<?php
$test0 = `/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/biber --help`;
echo "biber: <pre>$test0</pre>";
$test1 = `/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/latex --help`;
echo "latex: <pre>$test1</pre>";
?>

If I run it from terminal, both outputs; if I run it from a web browser, biber
does not seem to be called at all (latex is called)

Is it expected behavior? Otherwise, what could it be wrong?

Thanks
Cheers

Hi, 

shame on me, I did know a solution and forgot about it :-(

See at 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/484677/biber-error-message-at-file-pm-line-151
(and thanks to 
https://superuser.com/questions/120208/how-to-give-apache-rights-to-run-svn-update
)

Maybe it is not the best fix, but it is good enough for me. 
(Still I do not know why I need that fix)

Thanks
Cheers
mario

Dear Colleagues,

some time ago, a discussion on MetaType1 in TeX Live took place -- sorry 
for joining it with a delay.

You know, there are important and urgent matters. And the latter prevail 
over the former ones. ;)

Marcel Kr?ger:

Boris Veytsman:

I'm delighted that our almost fossilled engine has eventually aroused 
interest. Perhaps the time is ripe -- Marek Ry?ko and me are also 
vividly interested in the modernization of our font generation engine.

The story has its beginning some two years ago, when Piotr Strzelczyk 
started to work on a Python script for MetaType1 that would generate 
OpenType and Type 1 fonts using FonfForge's Python library. His script 
works fine. Alas, Piotr has changed his job and the area of interest.

I asked Marek Ry?ko for help -- he agreed to maintain Piotr's work and 
came up with the idea of modernization of MetaType1. So far, Marek 
prepared a preliminary version of a "Python shell" for MetaType1 
eliminating all Awk scripts. It resulted in the clarifying and 
facilitating of the installation procedure.

We believe that we will be able to publish the "awkless" version of 
MetaType1 by the end of this year. (Perhaps a new name should be coined 
-- PostScript Type 1 is not any more the format of importance.) If we 
manage to complete the new version of the system till the end of 2019, 
does it make sense to make also any quick changes in the existing 
version? Anyway, we are not going to maintain MetaType1 in its old form.

And an additional question: when the next release of TeX Live is 
scheduled?

All the best -- cheers -- Jacko & Marek

It systematically fails on a2ping's untarring:

BTW, the same happens when run with:

  ? install-tl-windows -no-gui

(except it fails earlier, when untarring `Tabbing').

I don't know installer.
Does the user name include non-ascii character?
If that is the case, probably the tar does not support
non-ascii names. Change of the env variable TEMP may help,
by some chance.

Akira

Hmm, if you say that the installation fails at different packages at
different times, then I guess the actual .tar.xz are fine. Anyway, sicne
we do checksum verification, and on top of this the xz decompress would
complain if there is some error in the .tar.xz, I can only guess that it
has nothing to do with the .tar.xz.

That said, it must be with some other stuff interfering on you computer
..

Best

Hi Bogus?aw,

thanks for your email and explanation of the situation. I think we are
all happy to see metatype1 or its successor shaping up.

I only have one suggestion - similar to the one I often give my Japanese
colleagues - don't put the development away somewhere. Put it up
available into an open git/svn repository. You can use gitlab, github,
if you want git.texlive.info (contact me), or whatever.

But please make the current state available. This *HELPS*!

People can look at it, contribute, suggest. You are still free to ignore
all the pull requests etc etc, but you might get valuable input.

Thanks.

No, I don't think there is any urgent need to fix up anything.

> And an additional question: when the next release of TeX Live is scheduled?

As usual around April 2020.

Thanks for your work and all the best

Norbert

Grasping at straws: maybe some messed-up permissions under
c:\texlive? Try to completely remove c:\texlive first.

I changed the install directory for C:\Users\Med-info\texlive but same

    PostScript Type 1 is not any more the format of importance.

I hope it will still be supported.

    And an additional question: when the next release of TeX Live is 
    scheduled?

The next full release will be in spring 2020. But for non-compiled
programs, it doesn't matter. I install new scripts as they show up on
CTAN and they are available through tlmgr update to anyone who wants
them.

To work well, scripts need to be self-locating and not depend on any
aspects of the build/installation system, since for TL, that has no
relationship to the user's system where it will actually be run.

??????? ?? ?????? ?? ?????? ?? ?????????.

As already mentioned by Boris, the luainputenc package is for luatex,
not for pdftex. It most probably reports and error. In addition,
pdftex makes use of 8bit encodings and Type 1 fonts. I cannot
understad how it can ever work in Russian without a fontenc package.
The cmap package then cannot work. On the contrary, both luatex and
XeTeX wotk directly in Unicode and expect input in utf-8. No input
reencoding is needed. And polyglossia is beter than babel because
babel has to solve a lot of character reencoding problems while
polyglossia assumes Unicode. The cmap package is not needed in these
engine because Unicode fonts are used and character extraction is
straightforward.

Try this file, it works in both xelatex and lualatex:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setdefaultlanguage{russian}
\newfontfamily\russianfont{EB Garamond}[Ligatures=TeX]
\parindent 0mm
\begin{document}
\textbf{??????}

??????? ? ?????? ????????? ?? ??????. \\

\end{document}

I have created PDF by both engines, opened PDF in okular and
copy/pasted it to kate. I got a correct text in both cases.

Message-ID: <2F01C322-C9D1-4860-83DB-F8CAD5010F50@markporter.co.uk>

I posted about an issue I?ve been experiencing since updating to TeX Live 2019 on stackexchange and it was suggested that I should raise the issue here. 

Since updating I am finding that Hoefler Text features which previously worked find in TeX Live 2018 no longer work. Problems with contextual alternates may well be due to my poor coding, however the major problem I am encountering is with small caps. 

I now receive the warning "LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape TU/HoeflerText(1)/m/sc' undefined (Font) using
TU/HoeflerText(1)/m/n' instead on input line 6.?

I am unsure why this is broken since the upgrade. If I switch to Gentium as the document font then the problem seems to go away.

The following works for me.

I have the same problem right from the beginning with my private
repository used by some of my colleagues. Although the packages can be
installed and updated without problems, the error message persists (on
Linux and Windows and Mac).

Can you show me the *full* content of the pinning file? The order is
important. If you have eg
	tlcontrib:*
	tlcontrib:classico
(as far as I remember - long time that I wrote the code) the error will
be shown.

After removing the "tlcontrib:*" from this file the warning is gone. 

Thanks. 

Do you follow updates of harf (the lua code) in the github

Concerning harf, no, if you are aware of updates please let me know know. I don't check daily whether something has changed.

Dear TeX Live contributors,

Could the hyphenex package be included in collection-langenglish? It is not in any collection at the moment.

All best,

I cannot answer your question, but would nonetheless like to report that 
when I type "TeXdoc hyphenex" (which I did in order to try to learn 
about your package), the document that opened was "hyphenat.pdf" which 
appears unrelated.

Indeed, there is no relationship ? the hyphenex package provides ushyphex.tex, which provides exceptions to improve English hyphenation. (As it?s rather critical, it should potentially also be part of one of the core collections to ensure it is included in a small scheme.)

All best,

Andrew

Hello Phil,
the reason for displaying a "wrong" package documentation is that as
of version 3.0 texdoc supports fuzzy search.  You'll still get what
you ask for if it exists.

The current texdoc maintainer, Takuto Assakura, talked about the new
features at BachoTeX 2018.  It's a pity that you haven't been there.

Hi Ulrike,

the import didn't realize automatically that the source of
chessboard.pdf is now available. I have now updated our import routine
to not remove the .pdf, and included it in the repo. Tomorrow's rebuild
should ship the .pdf, too.

Hi Andrew,

    Could the hyphenex package be included in collection-langenglish? 

I moved it to collection-basic. c-langenglish is only included in the
medium, tetex, and full schemes, while c-basic is fundamental to
everything, which I gather is more what you want. Since it is tiny, it
seems ok to add it there, though I think the vast (vast) majority of TeX
users never use, or know about, hyphenex.tex.

    It is not in any collection at the moment.

It was in c-binextra (for no good reason that I can discern). Every
package is in exactly one collection; that's one of our consistency
checks. You can run "tlmgr info hyphenex" to see the collection and
other info, or if (like me) you prefer to just look at files, the
texlive.tlpdb file is plain text and thus easy to search in. --best, karl.

Subject: Bug with the latest texlive installer on Windows
Message-ID: <CAB51FhtNPQxQJgoAjiu=26V2V7NoKqbY21NZVnXnEUDrrMuG+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I noticed this issue with the latest texlive GUI installer on a Windows 10
PC. It seems like the texlive installer doesn't handle spaces in program
paths correctly. It works only after copying the texlive install directory
(install-tl-20190627) to a path that doesn't have spaces.

Here are the outputs when trying to run from two different directories.

1. Directory with spaces in the path.

$ c:\New folder\install-tl-20190627>install-tl-windows.bat

This exits with the following error message popout.

    Error starting Perl backend.
    Level 1: main_prog
    Level 2: err_exit {Error starting Perl backend}

2. Directory with no spaces in the path.

$ c:\install-tl-20190627>install-tl-windows.bat

(This runs successfully.)

I did some further debugging, which led me to the following source of
error. It seems like the problematic lines are in
tlpkg/installer/install-tl-gui.tcl (lines: 1853 - 1857).

 ...
1852   # start install-tl-[tcl] via a pipe.
1853   set cmd [list "|${::perlbin}" "${::instroot}/install-tl" \
1854                "-from_ext_gui" {*}$::argv 2>@1]
1855   show_time "opening pipe"
1856   if [catch {open $cmd r+} ::inst] {
1857     err_exit "Error starting Perl backend"
1858   }
 ...

I'm not that familiar with Tcl/Tk, but perhaps the paths to $perlbin and to
$install-tl need to be sanitized/quoted in line 1853? I tried adding the
quotes (using \"), but it didn't work for me; perhaps, someone more
familiar with Tcl/Tk can fix this.

Thanks,
Rohan

Subject: Error on printing PDF document with pdflatex.exe
Message-ID: <002601d52d74$06cb7130$14625390$@madegames.com>

Hi,

I really hope I can find some help here. I've been researching this topic on
the net for about 2 weeks now, have already sought help at various other
places, but always without success (often with the hint that this is the
wrong place to ask for help). Therefore I sincerely hope that I can get help
here.

My story's a little longer. So I'll start at the beginning. If you need more
information about some points, please let me know, then I will add them.

I'm using pdflatex.exe to produce PDF files via a webpage.
That worked fine 2 or 3 years ago with the help of MiKTeX. Now I'm working
again on this project and I did not work anymore. So I tried to install a
new version of MiKTeX, but I wasn't able to install it on my Windows 10
computer (development machine). With MiKTeX portable I was able to produce
PDF documents in the console, but it still did not work with my software. It
did not even start to produce the PDF file (no .aux or .log files have been
created).

So lately I switched to TeXLive.
Here I was also able to produce PDF documents in the console of Win10.
When I use the exact command in my software it starts to produce the PDF
file (.aux and .log files being created), but it throws an error:

{d:/Program
Files/TeXLive/texlive/2019/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex
.map
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex.exe (file d:/Program
Files/TeXLive/texlive/2019/texmf-v
ar/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map): fflush() failed (Invalid argument)
==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

 

I tried to create a simple .tex file and run this in my software. The error
is the same.
I tried it with this .tex file:

\documentclass{article}

 

\begin{document}

 

\title{Introduction to \LaTeX{}}

\author{Author's Name}

 

\maketitle

 

\begin{abstract}

The abstract text goes here.

\end{abstract}

 

\section{Introduction}

Here is the text of your introduction.

 

\begin{equation}

    \label{simple_equation}

    \alpha = \sqrt{ \beta }

\end{equation}

 

\subsection{Subsection Heading Here}

Write your subsection text here.

 

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here.

 

\end{document}

 

and the .log file is this:

It looks to me that your script does not know yet that you are now
using TeX Live.

Hello,

in addition to Siep's hint: My first guess would be, that the map 
file/d:/Program 
Files/TeXLive/texlive/2019/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map//
/

might be corrupt. So it might help to update the map file (from tlmgr) 
or even the distribution (update all in tlmgr). But first I would 
suggest to follow the advice by Siep.
Good luck
Alois

Hi Johannes,

    please update sources to texlive 2019 here:
    http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/texlive/Source/

I've (quite belatedly) updated ftp://tug.org/texlive/Source/ and I think
CTAN will grab it on their next mirroring run, and thence make it out to
the CTAN mirrors. Thanks for the report.

(CTAN: if texlive/Source is not mirrored, please get it by hand.
I can never remember.) --thanks, karl.

Normally either when you try to use a font that isn't in the
name-database or when luaotfload detect that the cache has been
created with an older version.

Normally you have only one luatex-cache location. You can do
something like \font\test={blub:mode=node;} to check which one
luaotfload is using in your case. Or run luaotfload-tool -u and look
which one it is updated. 


Why are you asking? Do you have some specific problem?

I'm not getting any answers so let me explain why I'm
asking. On one system a simple file that uses libertine.sty
compiles using xelatex and lualatex with no fontspec
warnings. On other systems, lualatex generates warnings as
follows:

Package fontspec Warning: OpenType feature 'Numbers=Uppercase' (lnum) not
(fontspec)                available for font 'LinBiolinum_RB' with script
(fontspec)                'CustomDefault' and language 'Default'.

Package fontspec Warning: OpenType feature 'Numbers=Monospaced,Lining' (tnum)
(fontspec)                not available for font 'LinLibertine_RZI' with
(fontspec)                script 'CustomDefault' and language 'Default'.

etc.

Yet xelatex does *not* generate warnings. So I'm
conjecturing the luatex-cache needs to be refreshed but
nothing I do manages to avoid the warnings on the relevant
system.

AFAIK, there should not be any warnings.

  % otfinfo -f  LinBiolinum_RB.otf | grep lnum 

generates 

lnum    Lining Figures

and

  % otfinfo -f LinLibertine_RZI.otf | grep tnum

generates

tnum    Tabular Figures

What is going on?

I think I've figured it out. The affected systems have
obsolete versions of the LinLibertine fonts installed as
system fonts.

?? What does this mean? It is the difference between TEXMFVAR and
TEXMFSYSVAR, and a user run should *only* use TEXMFVAR.

Are there any tricks involved and user runs try to change the system
cache?

So how do I get luaotfload-tool to prefer texmf tree fonts
to system fonts? The -p option doesn't seem to work. I think
that in the past xelatex also allowed system fonts to have
priority over texmf fonts but that has been fixed.

Message-ID: <20190630152526.58bea37d@hordevm>

Hi,

the test suite disclosed a newly emerged issue on trunk/tl2020-dev: the
patgen binary instantly segfaults on aarch64-linux.


Built with "-O0 -g", I got:

$ gdb ./patgen
GNU gdb (Debian 7.12-6) 7.12.0.20161007-git
[?]
Reading symbols from ./patgen...done.

si_addr=NULL} --- +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
Segmentation fault


No changes in ulimit, same platform, compiler, et al. since successful
TL2019 final builds, and the same happens on my other aarch64-linux
system. On, x86_64-linux the binary built from the same sources does run
unsuspiciously.

I suspect that the changes of trie{,c}_size with -r51154 and/or -r51201
(from mid-may, following Keno's request, see thread
<https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2019-May/043672.html>) had weird
side effects on some platforms. Any ideas?

Subject: Unix install script fails on Mac
Message-ID: <A8988A79-5865-438E-9D97-1D56B0852635@math.uoregon.edu>

Folks,

The MacTeX web pages are mainly about MacTeX.pkg, but we also
have a page explaining how to install TeX Live using the standard Unix
install script. Since MacTeX requires macOS 10.12 or higher, this
script will be used by those with older machines.

Today I got an error report about the current Unix install script. So I
downloaded it (first from the link on our site, and then directly from the
link on TUG's site). Sure enough; there is a problem. The console reports
the following:

Error in startup script: no such variable
    (read trace on "::env(TMPDIR)")
    invoked from within
"set ::dblfile "$::env(TMPDIR)/dblog""
    invoked from within
"if {$::tcl_platform(os) eq "Darwin"} {
  set ::dblfile "$::env(TMPDIR)/dblog"
} elseif {$::tcl_platform(platform) eq "unix"} {
  set ::dblfile "/tmp/d..."
    (file "./tlpkg/installer/install-tl-gui.tcl" line 133)

I tried several times, and the mirroring command gave
scripts dated 0627, 0629, 0630. All had the same problem.
Usually we recommend running the script as

	sudo ./install-tl --gui tcl

but in one experiment I remove the "--gui tcl" and still got
the same error.

I'm running system 10,14, Mohave, but the user is running
system 10.11, El Capitan.

Does it work if you don't run it with sudo?

Can you try
	--gui text
? AFAIR the default on MacOS is tcl, so if you want the text mode
installer, you need to specify it.

Besides that, Tcl breakage needs to be fixed by Siep.

Folks,

I got immediate responses from Adam Maxwell and Norbert Preining.


Maxwell: What happens if you omit sudo?

Answer: Then the installer works.


Preining: What happens if you keep sudo, but change --gui tcl to --gui text?

Answer: Then the installer works. ((Rational: on the Mac, but not most systems,
gui tcl is the default.)



I'd still like to request a fix, but it isn't so urgent. Amazingly rapid debugging.

If it's just the Tcl installer, that makes more sense. I'd guess it's
an sudo/environment issue, wherein su or sudo -s don't have TMPDIR.

$ sudo su -l
root# echo $TMPDIR

root# env
TERM=xterm-256color
SHELL=/bin/sh
USER=root
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/opt/X11/bin
PWD=/var/root
SHLVL=1
HOME=/var/root
_=/usr/bin/env

If that guess is correct, you could try 
sudo -s
export TMPDIR=/tmp
./install-blah-blah

or

sudo env TMPDIR=/tmp perl install-tl ...

The fix in install-tl-gui.tcl is totally trivial and I'll probably

Hi Johannes,

    I suspect that the changes of trie{,c}_size with -r51154 and/or -r51201

Presumably so. ENOMEM is a plausible error for that to be the culprit,
and nothing else meaningful has changed.

    Any ideas?

Decrease the numbers until they work (and then you or I can commit the
new numbers). If it ends up being too small and we want to address the
original request, we'll have to make the numbers either configurable or
dynamically reallocate the arrays. --thanks, karl.
