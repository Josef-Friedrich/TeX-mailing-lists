If it works for you configuring "windows environment variable", it's better
to leave it that way. If it is tedious to do it in graphical mode you can do
it from cmd: (without admin "C:\Users\yourname>"):
Open a and run:
$ setx TEXINPUTS .;D:/path/goes/here//;
Close it and open a new one (without admin "C:\Users\yourname>") and run
$ kpsewhich -var-value=TEXINPUTS
This configuration is global and you don't have to write it over and over again.
If you want to see the system variables
$ reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment
And if you want to delete it (to add a new one for example)
$ reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment /v TEXINPUTS /f

If you insist on doing this using a configuration file you can do this. You open
a cmd console (without admin "C:\Users\yourname>") and run:
$ kpsewhich -all texmf.cnf
By default the TeXLive installation does not set this variable, you should get
something like this:
c:/texlive/2019/texmf.cnf
c:/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf
Now you run:
$ setx TEXMFCNF C:/Users/yourname;
Close it and open a new one (without admin "C:\Users\yourname>") and run
$ echo TEXINPUTS.xetex=.;D:/path/goes/here//; > texmf.cnf

> The TL documentation recommends to make all changes to the defaults in
> ${basedir}/2019/texmf.cnf:
That's true, but if you execute:
$ tlmgr conf --help
you will notice that the "TEXINPUTS" option is no longer available with a clear
warning message at the end:
        Warning: The general facility for changing configuration values is
        here, but tinkering with settings in this way is strongly
        discouraged. Again, no error checking on either keys or values is
        done, so any sort of breakage is possible.

I think the documentation is unclear on this point. These settings are local
and will only affect your system user account, if you use admin permissions
they will be for everyone, so you avoid modifying:
c:/texlive/2019/texmf.cnf
c:/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

Subject: xdvipdfmx problems after update from version 20190225 to 20190503
Message-ID: <4EB81FA7-4F50-41E5-9B17-CC561B9039EC@innoriid.com>

Hi All,

I successfully used XeLaTeX from my complete MacTeX installation from the TeX Collection DVD 2019 on MacOS Mojave.

Recently I did an update with the TeX Live Utility and XeLaTex didn?t produce pdf files for my dozens of documents.

Separate calls to

	xelatex --no-pdf xxx.tex

(no errors reported) and

	xdvipdfmx -vv xxx.xdv

reported problems with FontAwesome TrueType fonts, in my case version 5.3.1.

I replaced the TrueType with OpenType fonts et viol?: pdf files were produced again.

Now that I have pdf output, I found that one pdf included as a graphic had the expected size but rendered completely transparent.

xelatex run without problems, but xdvipdfmx reported

	xdvipdfmx:warning: inflate() failed. Broken PDF file?

The new version seems to be picky about fonts and pdf graphics.

The pdf required for the following MWE is attached.

% Compile with XeLaTeX!
\documentclass{memoir}
\RequirePackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\framebox{\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Spectrum-pdfreport}}
\end{document}

I've followed

  https://tug.org/texlive/upgrade.html

to upgrade from TeXLive 2018 to 2019.  Unfortunately, some of the new
binaries fail to run on my MacOS 10.7.5 box:

  > pdftex --version
  dyld: Symbol not found: __ZSt9terminatev
    Referenced from: /usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-darwinlegacy/pdftex
    Expected in: /usr/lib/libc++abi.dylib
   in /usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-darwinlegacy/pdftex
  Trace/BPT trap: 5

All affected binaries (at least `pdftex', `xetex', and `etex') show
the same error.

Is this a known problem?

I thought I fixed it a while ago, but maybe it broke again, I'll take a look.

It's a bit tricky because one can only build on 10.6 by installing
libc++. MacPorts installs a version that's newer than what's on Lion,
so that's incompatible.
I copied the library from Lion over to Snow Leopard and that used to
work, but it's easy to break this / do something wrong.

Next year I could probably decide to break compatibility with 10.6
(which is questionable anyway) and simply build everything on 10.7.

Subject: A minor MacTeX packaging bug
Message-ID: <CAGTcTFyLLXPkkfR5x=wgY+1aQcL1O40X6w40v37M3S9Sp1rExg@mail.gmail.com>

Installing the MacTeX 2019 package results in a file at `/etc/paths.d/TeX`
that has a couple extra line feeds:

```sh-session
$ cat /etc/paths.d/TeX
/Library/TeX/texbin


$
```

These extra newlines cause recent versions of the fish shell to add `.`
(i.e., the current directory) to the PATH. To be fair, for all I know this
may actually be the result of some bug in fish?but I also doubt that those
extra lines in `/etc/paths.d/TeX` are intended.

Anyway, thanks for all of the work you all put in to TeX Live + MacTeX. And
please let me know if anything is unclear or if you need any more
information.
- Josh

P.S. For the curious: I believe the fish behavior I mentioned above was
introduced in https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/4852.

Hi Jens,

The problem occurs when dvipdfmx tries to zlib decompress data.

I observed similar error when extracting data from provided file by
qpdf program,

$ qpdf --filtered-stream-data --show-object=4 Spectrum-pdfreport.pdf
WARNING: Spectrum-pdfreport.pdf (file position 179): error decoding
stream data for object 4 0: stream inflate: inflate: data: incorrect
data check
stream inflate: inflate: data: incorrect data check

suggesting corrupted data.
I also checked error code and message returned by inflate() and found
the same error.

I think there must be some recoverable (since Acrobat, Ghostscript,
and many other PDF viewers can process it) error in
compressed data but I don't know the exact reason.

The reason why previous versions of dvipdfmx can process it is that
they do not decompress data in some cases.

I will consider workaround for this issue but it may take some time.
Also for FontAwesome TrueType font problem I will inspect it later.

Thanks,
Shunsaku Hirata

Can you please try whether this is a persistent error or not?

The mirror you are using could be right in the middle of the rsync
update and in this case there is a short window when the signature file
and the checksum file are not in sync.

If it is persistent, please let us know.

Thanks

There's been no movement on this for a while, apparently?

Is this the same problem and explanation?

Putting a suitable Libertinus[Serif|Sans].fontspec into the tex/latex input
path fixes the problem.

It appears to have resolved itself. Bad timing, I guess.

Subject: Go to source
Message-ID: <5d49ef97.1c69fb81.536f7.7a34@mx.google.com>

I am using TexStudio with a TexLive 2019 distribution. Before I switch to TexLive I was working with MikTex and the "Go to source" function was working fine. Now this option is not working an it can be frustrating when working witlarge projects. I searched a lot for a solution in questions like?these?and today I think I accidently discovered the reason of this issue.
I write in greek, which means that many of my forders have a greek name resulting in paths which contain greek words in them. If I place a?test.tex?file in such directory then the "go to source" function isn't working. Putting the same file in a directory like "C:\usres\ (user-folder)" make things work file. So I am 99% sure that the reason behind the problem is the greek words inside a path.
For example
Working path: "C:\usres\ (user-folder)".
Not working path: "C:\Users\Spyros\??????????\????????????\? ?????? ??? ??????????"
I do not want to rename the folders or move them to a different directory because that would lead to more issues conserning custom commands that use the current folder structure. Besides this would not fix the problem.
The?test.synctex?file has question marks in place of the greek words something like this "C:\Users\Spyros\?????????????\????????????\?????????????".
I use?-synctex=1?in the build command as mentioned by many and I compile with?xelatex.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
I think that I fixed the problem. I hope that
you will have a better result in the next year, in TL-2020.

It looks like the path for that account does not include
/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux (or at least that is not before
/usr/local/bin)

Hi,

remember, that "apache" is not a normal user. Unless you have modified
/etc/passwd, it has no login shell. It will not read settings in shell
startup files used by normal users and root, hence it tries to use the
TeX distribution from Fedora packages, not TeX Live from TUG, as you
can see from the paths. In addition, it is not sufficient to define
environment variables in such a way that sudo will know about them.
When you later try to run TeX from a script invoked by the Apache
server, they will not work unless you define them in you config file
by SetEnv or PassEnv directives. It is better not to run TeX directly
but use a script which will define the necessary variables including
PATH and then call TeX.

For security reasons I wouldn't run any program except Apache itself
as user apache.  The restrictions are on purpose.  Security is the
most important thing when running a web server and I don't see any
reason why one want to run TeX as user apache at all.

  Reinhard

How, where?

Yes.
I have a .php script

<?php
......

$test2 = `/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/pdflatex  --interaction
batchmode myFile.tex`;
$test21 = `sudo -u root /usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-
linux/biber   myFile.bib`;
$test22 = `/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-linux/pdflatex  --interaction
batchmode myFile.tex`;
.....
?>

How would you define the necessary variables therein?

Note: everything works fine, even from within the .php script, if I call a older
2016 version of texlive.

thanks
mario

You cannot do it directly within PHP. When I do it, I have a small

Yes, security is the key point but there are cases when it is useful.
Consider services as TeXonWeb, https://tex.mendelu.cz/new/

Sometimes I need pretty printed output in PDF. I often prepare
invoices by LaTeX. In such a case I do not allow full user input, I
take only a limited number of form entries and verify them before
feeding them to LaTeX. In addition, I do not allow lua and do not
allow \write16. In order not to lock the whole process I run it via my
own Expect script which is available from here:

Yes, settini inside the bash script ensures that it will work in both.

You might have some TL 2016 related setting somewhere in one of the

You were calling pdftex by full path so most of the time it will work even
if you are using an account which does not have the texlive 2019 bin in its
path, but the log you showed initially showed that on that document a
missing font caused it to run mktextfm to try to generate the font with
metafont, so at that point it picks up the wrong script as the path is
wrong and thing go bad.  Presumably by now your texlive 2016 setup has most
fonts generated that are needed and so you get lucky more often.

Indeed.  If the TeX Live bin/ directory isn't in PATH and the program
is called by full path everything works fine unless the program calls
other programs which reside in the texlive/bin/<platform>/ directory.

Everything works as expected if TeX Live is installed properly and
users follow the instructions provided by the installer (setting PATH,
MANPATH, INFOPATH).

If it's necessary to call a TeX program as a user who has not TeX Live
in PATH, the invocation on Unix could be

  PATH=/path/to/texlive/bin pdftex myfile.tex

The question is whether this should be documented somewhere.  I
personally don't see any reason because TeX Live works fine if users
follow the instructions.  The problem Mario encountered is not TeX
Live related, any other program called with full path will fail if it
tries to call a program which is supposed to be in PATH but actually
isn't.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi all
 

I fixed it by updating >tlmgr update -all  :-):-):-)

I am not so much into LaTeX to know what happens under the hood, and so I am
still a  little puzzled, but as long as it works, I am fine.   

Thanks a lot  for your support.
best  wishes
mario

ps. I also created a file custom.sh under /etc/profile.d to define 

PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2019:/usr/local/texlive/2019/bin/x86_64-
linux:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/root/bin

but I a not sure it helped.

Because this is the fix.

BTW, you do not need to add /usr/local/texlive/2019 that is not
necessary.

Subject: blockcquote fails to print parentheses around the citation
Message-ID: <CA+7MQSUor2zZ38bu=k6LX0ffJS+5ynmsGGj7Fp8eApBaF0QA7w@mail.gmail.com>

I am using the latex biblatex (3.13) (authoryear style) and csquotes (5.2e)
together. I have found that blockcquote fails to print parentheses around
the citation at the end of the blockquote. I don't know if this is a bug of
biblatex or of csquote.

What follows is a minimal file.

\end{filecontents}

uttered them. The texts preserved did not just drop from his lips; they
must be products of deliberate composition?in fact, they were composed to

features as versification, numbered lists, repetition and stock formulae
are all aids to memory.}

Yeah, \SetCiteCommand{\parencite} fixes this issue. But authoryear style
has the autocite=inline as the default; why does it not work? I am a little
confused.

Hi,

due to a bug report I've found that

  fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex_ndl14.map

shows an old version of

  fonts/map/dvips/roboto/roboto.map

in fact the file rbto_idpkzy.enc is not part of roboto.tar.xz

Hi Werner

Can you please do the full file location, or at least tell me which texmf tree it is in. It sounds like a left over from a wrong invocation.

Hi Werner,

      fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex_ndl14.map
    shows an old version of
      fonts/map/dvips/roboto/roboto.map
    in fact the file rbto_idpkzy.enc is not part of roboto.tar.xz

Thanks for the report, but I'm not seing it upstream.

pdftex_ndl14.map is part of the updmap-map package in native TL.
The latest version of that package is 51762, updated July 30,
and rbto_idpkzy.enc doesn't show up there. This is the file as checked
into TL that I'm looking at

tug$ pwd
../Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap
tug$ ls -l pdftex_ndl14.map
-rw-r--r-- 1 karl root 4636605 Jul 28 01:53 pdftex_ndl14.map
tug$ sum pdftex_ndl14.map
36924  4528
tug$ grep rbto_idpkzy.enc pdftex_ndl14.map
tug$ 

I looked at the updmap-map.tar.xz currently in tlnet/archive, and it has
the same file.

I surmise something in the TL -> SuSE updating did not happen correctly?
Let me know if something's more to check on my side ... --best, karl.

Start a command-prompt (an administrative command-prompt if it is an
administrative install) and give the following two commands:

tlmgr update --self
tlmgr update tlshell

The problem is that tlshell.tcl got out of sync with a file that it
depends on. Both files are now in the same package, so this should
not happen again.

Hello,

In the output of the ctan2tds I have seen my new developed package
"clojure-pamphlet" marked as "die 'skipping, compilation'". Does that mean
that the package will never be shipped with TeXLive? Do I need to do
something special because the package needs compilation? Would it help if I

Hello,

I am not a TL maintainer but as I understand, compilation from C is a
bit pain because it must be compiled for all platforms and is always
done by a few persons. For this reason it happens only once a year, so
your package could be shipped with TeX Live 2020. If you can avoid
compilable languages, it will certainly be better. Nowadays lua may be
a better choice than perl.

Hi, Siep and thank you for your prompt reply. I encountered several
problems:

the first:

...Detailed command logging to "K:\texlive\2019\temp\update-self.log"
failed self update: texlive.infra (51232 -> 51561) texlive.infra.win32
(50798 -> 51563)
Rolling back to previous version ...
failed self restore: texlive.infra (51232) texlive.infra.win32 (50798)
FATAL ERROR:
Infrastructure update failed and backup recovery failed too.
To repair your TeX Live installation download and run:
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe

I then loaded update-tlmgr-latest.exe and ran that with admistrator rights.

I stopped with

Only when ignoring and skipping this file , I could get tlmgr updated. I
do not see why the program wants to write to the dll file. TLMGR works
again.

Kind regards

Glad to hear it.

runscript.dll is part of the infrastructure, which is being updated.
Since there have been no recent changes in this file, you are
probably ok.

Maybe the file was in use. Windows does not like to overwrite files
which are in use.

It is recommended practice to close all applications and restart Windows
before doing installs to avoid the possibility of an update failing on an
"in use" file that is being replaced by the update.   This is becoming more
important as tools like pandoc are used behind the scenes (e.g., RStudio,
nbconvert).

Hi Ernesto,

    "die 'skipping, compilation'". Does that mean that the package will
    never be shipped with TeXLive? 

Not necessarily "never".

    Do I need to do something special
    because the package needs compilation? 

You already used Automake, which is the main prerequisite, in principle.

However, generally speaking, when a package requires compilation, I
await a request from the author or a user before I incorporate it into
the build tree. It takes a chunk of time to include a new compiled
program. And, as Zdenek said, it wouldn't show up until the next year's
TL in any case.

    Would it help if I ported the executable to Perl/Lua?

Yes, that would be great. Then I could install it (and any future
updates) right away. And it's a lot less effort all around.

By the way, the man page pamphletanglerman.1 (thank you for including
it) may as well be named pamphletangler.1, since that's what it has to
be installed as.

Thanks for writing (both the program and the email :),
Karl

The installer has been tested with the most recent versions of
Windows 10.

Try the unpack option, then run the unpacked install-tl-windows.bat.
Then you might get a better view on what is going on.

For testing purposes, you might want to click the advanced button
and select a smaller scheme: basic or even minimal.

Subject: versioning TeXlive packages on CTAN
Message-ID: <E27B4FE6-76AA-4803-AF5B-849C3D0784BB@nmsu.edu>

In the process of integrating TeXlive packages from CTAN into pkgsrc, I (and others) run into a persistent issue that creates difficulties.  The main issue has two aspects: (i) TeXlive packages on CTAN do not reflect version information in the filenames, and (ii) the contents of the *.tar.xz files change periodically as a result of updates to the packages.  The consequence of this is that the checksum of an identically named file changes periodically.  This triggers downloads that fail to pass validation, which then must be serviced elsewhere.

Is it not feasible to include version information in the name of the files uploaded to CTAN?  To maintain backward compatibility you could always have a symbolic link from the unversioned (i.e., current) name to the most recent versioned name.

This would be a huge improvement from the perspective of knowing what version is present on CTAN and not triggering needless complexity in the packaging and downloading process.

I hope you will give this serious consideration as this is an issue that has frustrated me (and others) for years.

Thank you very much.

Cheers,
Brook

Yes, we are well aware of that problem for those distributions that do
not provide their own versions of the original sources (like Debian,
Ubuntu, RedHat etc), but rely on getting files that upstream provides.
We have had this discussion several times here, or on tl-distribution
mailing list.

Just recently on the FROSCON in Bonn I was discussing this with a
colleague.

You are proposing to add the version number into the filename, and add
links. This is indeed possible, but it will not help you (your users) in
any way, because the versions you have registered in the pkgsrc with
checksums might have already disappeared, making it impossible to
install the package.

Before we discuss any further steps, how do you plan/would you deal with that?

And no, keeping copies of every days changes is not possible due to
space reason. We are already grateful to CTAN for distributing all of
TL, so adding multiple copies of all packages is out of discussion.

All the best

Norbert

Thanks for responding.  I am glad you are discussing these issues.

I cannot speak to other packaging systems, but that is no problem for pkgsrc.  Pkgsrc already maintains copies of all the distfiles in use, including archived versions that are no longer available on the original distribution sites.  In fact, that already happens for TeXlive packages. However, the process of getting them there is much more cumbersome that it would be if the TeXlive packages were versioned in the filenames.

Here is how things would work for us.

Initially, consider a hypothetical TeXlive package "foo" at version 1.2.3.  I am suggesting that it be visible on CTAN in the following way:

	foo-1.2.3.tar.xz (actual package file)
	foo.tar.xz -> foo-1.2.3.tar.xz

Now consider what happens with pkgsrc.

- The first time a pkgsrc bulk build happens (which is more or less daily), it will download foo-1.2.3.tar.xz from CTAN and verify the checksum.  Because it will pass (the URL to foo-1.2.3.tar.xz and the expected checksum is encoded in the package), the file foo-1.2.3.tar.xz will be archived "forever" on pkgsrc servers.

- Any users of pkgsrc would also download the same file from CTAN, the checksum will pass, and the package will be made as usual.  Users may or may not archive their distfiles, but they need not because pkgsrc maintains a copy independently of CTAN.

Now, suppose there is a new release of the package "foo" and the version is advanced to 1.2.4.  Suppose also that you do not wish to archive old versions; I get that that is infeasible.  Now CTAN looks like this:

	foo-1.2.4.tar.xz (actual package file, new version)
	foo.tar.xz -> foo.1.2.4.tar.xz

- If pkgsrc updates the package, the case is exactly as before.

- If pkgsrc does not update the package (so it is still pointing to foo-1.2.3.tar.xz), then users will be requesting a file that no longer exists on CTAN, the request will fail, and it will failover to the pkgsrc archive which still has the expected file.  Consequently, the download will succeed, the checksum will pass, and the package made.  Other than the extra fetch request, there is no difference for users compared to the previous case.  Either way, the package builds just fine.

Note that there is no burden on CTAN to make this work, other than a 404 response to requests when CTAN and pkgsrc do not agree on the version.  Users are not affected as there will always be another site (i.e., pkgsrc) that has the correct files so they will always be able to build their packages.

Note also that the unversioned file, e.g., foo.tar.xz, is entirely irrelevant in this situation.  I only suggest that you keep it to reduce surprises for any other people or systems that have been built to expect it.  The only cost of that is a symlink directory entry.

Finally, note that my example of a three field version number (e.g., 1.2.3) is also entirely irrelevant.  I know that many TeXlive packages have other versioning schemes.  Every package can use whatever form the developers wish, as long as it is a reasonable monotonically increasing sequence; all the ones I am familiar with already do this, so there is no problem there.  Thus, packages might be a hodgepodge of foo-1.2.3.tar.xz, bar-20160722.tar.xz, baz-7_2a.tar.xz, etc.  No problem; no imposition on current practice.

Thus, I think there is an entirely feasible solution to the problem that pkgsrc (and likely others) are facing that will not add burdens to you or CTAN as far as I can tell.

I hope you will implement this, because it would make a _huge_ difference to the usability of the TeXlive archives.

Thank you very much for considering this.

Cheers,
Brook

Ahh, I didn't know. So that is the problem.

But then, why don't you parse the texlive.tlpdb (in
tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb) which contains the version numbers for all
packages? There are perl modules and full documentation for that.

You could on pkg build do
- parse tlpdb
- get version number of package foo
- if it is the first time, download and upload to your server
  (maybe changing the name on the fly)

Would that be an option?

This is what tlgmr does, it gets all the version numbers direct from the
tlpdb, which is **the** **authorative** source of information.

Example:

	name 2up
	category Package
	revision 41578
	...

The version we are using in TL is the revision number (because the real
version as reported by packages is not guaranteed to be strictly
increasing, while the revision which is computed from our subversion
repository is strictly increasing).

I think by parsing (using the Perl modules in tlnet/tlpkg/TeXLive, in
particular TLPDB.pm and TLPOBJ.pm (others you don't need to know)) the
tlpdb you can do everything already.

Let me know your opinion

Best

Norbert

Yes, we could do all sorts of processing, because of course the information is in the original files.  In fact, that is exactly how we make the original packages in the first place.  The version information is stripped out of the distfile contents and stuffed inside the pkgsrc package files.  We have scripts to do this and they are quite easy to use.  This is not the problem.

Once a package is made, the version, the URL, the checksum, etc. are all fixed (at least until the package is next updated).  This is true for all pkgsrc packages, not just TeXlive ones.  If the URL now points to the wrong file (i.e., it got updated on CTAN but the name never changed), then nothing works.  We currently have special infrastructure that is used only for TeXlive packages; it basically avoids downloading packages from CTAN because we cannot trust the files there to have sane checksums.  This means that developers of new (or updated) packages must download everything manually and manually install the distfiles in the pkgsrc archive.  This is annoying and, as I am trying to suggest, entirely unnecessary.

As you note in the follow-up email, all that needs to be done is modify whatever script you use to generate the package files.  I presume this is already automated.  It would seem to be a minor change to add whatever version information is appropriate to the filenames that are generated and (optionally) add a symlink.

That apparently simple change would make a big difference by making the version explicit in the CTAN archives.

I hope you can see the benefit of this.

Thanks a lot for discussing the options and the reasoning behind my interest in this.

Cheers,
Brook

Hi,

I'm with Brook on this.

I'm pretty sure this is not feasible for the full CTAN, but it might
be doable in the scope of TeX Live packages alone.
TeX Live is already versioning the archived packages locally for
backups. It could just as easily fetch the versioned filenames
directly once it has read the package versions from the database.

We have very similar principle in MacPorts, and would face the exact
same problems (and the same solution would help us) ... if we actually
bothered packaging each individual package separately, which would be
a bit of a nightmare anyway. What our maintainer does is create his
own archive, upload it to his own server first, and then the files get
mirrored, see for example:
    http://distfiles.macports.org/texlive-basic/
but that's heavily suboptimal, as our bus factor of packaging TeX Live
is currently equal to one. Even if I would be enthusiastic in helping,
I feel it's too complex and cumbersome, so if that bus factor drops,
we might get similar delays in updates as when tetex was discontinued.

If talking about downstream packaging and adding versions to archives
(which I fully support), I wouldn't mind if the script which does the
daily updates would also create one versioned tarball with all the
packages from a collection (split into run / doc / src), ignoring
inter-package dependencies of course. Those could be put to a
different location if there's a space concern, but in any case it
would be really handy to also archive a few dozen such tarballs next
to "TeX Live 2020 archive" (on the historic FTP or wherever).

Looooooong time ago I made a prototype (but never took the time to
finish it) of the code which iterates through all subversion commits,
checks for changes in texlive database file ... and finally makes a
separate git repository for every single package from TeX Live and
tags versions for each package. It should basically create an
equivalent of archiving contents of individual packages as they change
over time. If pushing those repositories on GitHub, GitLab or any
other site (provided one wouldn't hit constraints), one could use the
existing mechanism to automatically create tarball for an arbitrary
version. That solution would hardly consume any more space than just
archiving a single copy of TeX Live, yet it would provide all historic
versions of tarballs (on demand) out of the box.

Yes, that would be also possible, to drop the unversioned completely.

That is what Debian does on a checkout, more or less.
It is just that from 4Gb it suddenly gets to 8Gb ..

And then others come and ask for single package archives back for a year
or more ... and then we speak about 100 times the archive size.

That should be much easier now starting from the git svn mirror, but
still, it is a pain.

No way, too big.

I recently discussed with colleague about asking github for an exception
for the size, so that we can push the full texlive to gh, but I (or
someone instead of me) needs to contact gh, and it would be good to have
prior contact beforehand.

In the face of much more grandiose possibilities, please do not lose track of the first simple step that I am identifying.  That would cost no more resources and would solve the biggest problem.  Others can build upon that as needed and as resources become available.

In the near term, though, there is an easy step that would make a huge difference.

I hope you will move forward with that.

Thanks a lot.

Cheers,
Brook

You remind me of the standard response that any suggestion for 
improvement would elicit when made to our (British) computer 
manufacturers in the 1970s ? "Thank you for your suggestion. However, it 
offers only a partial solution to the deeper problem, and as we do not 
have the resources to address the deeper problem, we propose to do 
nothing at all".

A paraphrase, of course, but that was the underlying message.

As far as know, no tex or texlive running, but some other programs. That
has never been a problem.

Hello,

it might depend on your system,

but asking google for "view dvi file" gives a lot of helpful responses.

I am personally used to convert these files to postscript with dvips.

Good luck

This is METAFONT, Version 2.7182818 (TeX Live 2019) (preloaded base=mf)

(/home/norbert/tl/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/esint/esint10.mf)
! Emergency stop.
<*> ...=ljfour; mag:=1; nonstopmode; input esint10

Transcript written on esint10.log.
mktextfm: `mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; nonstopmode; input esint10' failed.
$


Looking at the respective svn commit 51935 (or git 050334038c7ab2) I see
that 
	esint10.tfm
was removed. And it seems it cannot be generated, because
	esint10.mf
is empty, besides comments and a lone
	\endinput

Is this on purpose?

Best

Norbert

Even better, convert dvi to ps to pdf.

But if you try to use the dviout that comes with TeX Live, make sure
to invoke C:\texlive\2019\bin\win32\dviout.exe, not
C:\texlive\2019\tlpkg\dviout\dviout.exe. Dviout needs a lot of help
with generating font bitmaps, which help is provided by the wrapper
program ...\bin\win32\dviout.exe, which ultimately invokes
...\tlpkg\dviout\dviout.exe.

Also, TeXmaker and TeXstudio provide similar assistance in writing
math etc. as TeXnicCenter, but have no trouble finding all the
programs they need by themselves.

Hi Pedro,

this is not a user support mailing list, but one dedicated to the
development of TeX Live. Better to ask your questions on
tex.stackexchange or on the texhax mailing list.

But ..

If you are on Unix, use 
	xdvi
If you are on Windows, dviout is probably the best idea. What does not
work?

There is a typo in source/latex/esint/esint.ins .
The line
  \generate{\file{esint10.mf}{\from{esint.dtx}{muffle}}}
Should be
  \generate{\file{esint10.mf}{\from{esint.dtx}{mffile}}}

That was an error in the dtx. I notified the author, but he seems
not to have corrected the ins correctly. I will write him again.

Thanks for the answers, the file is already fixed on CTAN and in TL.

  That looks almost like an ill-advised autocorrect ...

Dear Karl, dear all

With the new release, luabidi.sty was installed at doc/luatex/luabidi/
whereas it should go to tex/luatex/luabidi

Thanks
