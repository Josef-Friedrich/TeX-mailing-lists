Hi,

I remember a different flavour of the problem being discussed recently
with respect to Chrome browsers & http/https.

Today I visited
    http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-unix-download.html
and tried to download
    http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
on that page, which apparently redirected to
    ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/TeX/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz

But Safari greeted me with an error message:

--------------
Safari can't open page

Safari can't open the page
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/TeX/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz:
The error is: "Redirection to URL with a schema that is not HTTP(S)"
(:0)
--------------

Apparently redirecting http(s) to ftp will no longer be allowed for
security concerns.

Can anything be done about this? (Other than waiting for a week? :)

@ERROR: max connections (30) reached -- try again later

I tried other mirrors, but I couldn't find another valid address of an
upstream mirror.
(The ones I used in the past are no longer valid server names.)

It is pretty annoying because there's currently no easy way to get TeX
Live 2019.
As it might take more time to get this synced, it would be nice if at
least tlpretest didn't just vanish ...

The cron job on comedy had a problem receiving the stuff from tug.org.

This morning I started the script manually and now all files have
reached their final destination on comedy.

So, the mirrors can now catch up which (admittedly) might take some
days.

Just to make it clear: I'm not having any issue with that myself. I
can easily find a workaround, and even Safari has no problem
downloading that file provided that you explicitly call it with a
"ftp://" prefix.

Another clarification: this is only a problem in specific geographic
locations where the mirror would point to ftp. I never configured our
mirror for ftp files, so I never hit that problem at home.

What I'm worried about is other users that might be stuck when they
hit such an error.

Subject: dvipdfmx: g option and non-link annotations
Message-ID: <da31f701-cbeb-1c53-acbb-4b5b47aa3634@morningstar2.co.uk>

Hello all,

pdfTeX offers \pdflinkmargin to adjust the size of link boxes, whilst in 
dvips one can adjust in PostScript. In dvipdfmx, we have the g command 
line option to do something similar. However, it applies to all annotations:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{animate}
\usepackage{hyperref}
% overwrite the animate setting of g 0 with some large value:
\AtBeginDocument{\special{dvipdfmx:config g 30}}
\begin{document}
\url{https://www.latex-project.org}

\vspace{3cm}
\begin{animateinline}[controls]{30} % 30 frames per second
   \multiframe{10}{iPosition=0+1}{ % iPosition=0...100
    some text  }
\end{animateinline}

\end{document}

It would be beneficial if the g option would apply only to link 
annotations, or if there were a link-specific version of the same 
option. Is this a possibility?

Hi Mojca,

this is one on a fairly long list of problems with the mirrors.
I doubt that this can be fixed in a short term.

For the time being and as a workaround:  What alternatives to
Safari does your Mac offer?  (On Linux there would be programs
like wget, curl, traditional ftp clients & more.)

Sorry I cannot give more help; others will surely know more.

    Best,
    Petra  (from the CTAN team)

 That's the other big issue:  Geolocation ...

 CTAN's mirror redirector software was written ages ago, by an
 author who is now long dead.  It is based on an outdated database
 format (for the geoip data) and does not support IPv6.
 In short:  Most probably a complete rewrite would be needed ?
 but by whom?

 So if anyone feels they would have time and knowledge enough
 to write a new redirector to be integrated into our website,
 _please_ get in touch with ctan at ctan.org.
 Many thanks in advance!

   All the best,
      Petra  (from the CTAN team)

I don't know who that author was, but given that almost the entire TeX community benefits from his/her work, I would personally prefer that the above be expressed as "... was written long ago by XXX YYY who is sadly no longer with us but to whom we owe a very great debt of gratitude".

 You are of course right.  Sorry if I expressed myself badly,
 but English is not my mother tongue.
 And I'm afraid I had truly forgotten the name.  (I was not
 on the CTAN team at the time and only learned the story
 indirectly.)
 I have now looked it up:  The author of the CTAN redirector
 was Randy Kobes, who died in September 2010.  (At least that
 is the information I found in the depths of my Computer.)

 So:
 CTAN's mirror redirector software was written long ago by Randy
 Kobes who is sadly no longer with us but to whom we owe a very
 great debt of gratitude.

I have made some investigations. I have found the following:

- GeoIp2 is the successor of GeoIP (which ran out of support in January) and also provided by MaxMind.
- It supports IPv6.
- A free version is available as GeoLite2.
- The databases can be downloaded from MaxMind.
- There is an Apache module to read the databases.
  - It lacks the ability to do something with this information, i.e. select a mirror from the list of available mirrors.
- There are APIs from MaxMind and third-parties for a large range of programming languages -- amoung them Perl and C.
  - Perl would be the method of choice if the existing solution (written in Perl) should be upgraded to the current API.
  - C would the method of choice for writing a new Apache mod.

I will look into the second alternative and see where this leads me to...

Nevertheless this will still leave the other problems with the mirrors untouched. I opt for using mirrors with HTTPS in the redirects only. Other protocls can be offered on the portal for manual selection. Not speaking of the other issues...

I removed ftp sites from the list of mirrors for the redirector.

Safari isn't the only browser causing problems: Microsoft Edge doesn't support 
the ftp protocol; Chrome and Firefox may go the same way in the future.

The ftp protocol causes many different problems. It supports generally
two modes, active and passive. The problem is if a server implements
only the passive mode while some browsers can only use the active mode
(or vice versa). In addition, it needs two ports, one for commands,
one for data. Some firewalls cannot cope with it. It is quite common
that I cannot access ftp from firefox in Linux but the command-line
ftp client works. Mounting by curlftpfs works too.

Hi Joseph,

It's possible to distinguish link annotations from others and then
to apply g option setting only to them.
However, it would be better handled to apply g option setting
only to annotations created by dvipdfm bann/eann (and html)
specials, where annotation rectangle is automatically determined
as a bounding box of text inserted between bann/enn pair.
(which is often a tight box sorrounding text)
As for other annotations created by dvipdfm pdf:annot special,
annotation rectangle must be explicitly specified by users, so it
is natural to think that g option value is not applied to them.

I think it is reasonable to change the dvipdfmx behavior so that
it applies g option value only to annotations created by dvipdfm
pdf:bann/eann and html specials although it is not dvipdfm
compatible behavior.

I'll consider implementing it.


Thanks,

I had installed the pretest from the czeck mirror. I changed the
repository to the above general mirror and the first update run
smoothly, but for luatex.win32, which raised errors due to missing
permissions. I then rerun tlmgr in administrator mode. However the
"working" indicator (l?uft) never again turned to idle. I had to stop
the program from the task manager. A second test shown not in admin mode
shows the same behaviour. What shall I do?

Kind regards

Subject: dvipdfvm, xdvipdfmx: wrong @xpos and @ypos under rotation
Message-ID: <20190502213827.GB11479@hzdr.de>

Hello all,

while implementing a command for the creation of PDF destinations for the
[x]dvipdfmx backends, I noticed that @xpos and @ypos are substituted with
wrong coordinate values if they are placed into a box that is subject to
rotation. Both variables are used to mark anchors and rectangles of PDF
destinations.

Rotation becomes relevant if page content is typeset onto landscape pages using
the `landscape' environment provided by the lscape and pdflscape packages.

On the other hand, @xpos and @ypos behave correctly if they are subject to
scaling.

The example code below demonstrates the problem. Would it be possible to fix
it?

Thank you in advance! Kind regards,

Alexander

Message-ID: <CANROs4czjjtUS97=cf+8nwXyJD1_O=+zkXfaN4QcvoZZ+wsznA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Since the option -profile is for unattended installation of TeX Live
via ./install-tl, I wonder whether it should imply -no-gui
automatically (http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html).

Currently, the Tcl/tk dialog box still pops up (which requires human
interaction) when we do an unattended installation -profile, and we
have to specify -no-gui explicitly to suppress the dialog. Thanks!

Regards,
Yihui

This is only on windows and macos. I figured that some users might
prefer a scrollable textbox over a scrolling terminal window.

This may be a problem with the mirror. ATM neither the new installer
GUI nor tlshell have yet a good way to abort the attempt and let the
user pick a different mirror.

Subject: Page shipout in infinite loop
Message-ID: <87y33m1zc4.fsf@siart.de>

Since today's update the following MWE causes 'latex' (not 'pdflatex') to
ship out empty pages in an infinite loop:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mhchem}
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{landscape}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
  \rule{1.1\linewidth}{1.1\linewidth}
\end{center}
\end{document}

The infinite loop disappears when I either comment mhchem or
\geometry{landscape}.

Please excuse if this is the wrong place to report this. I suspect that
one of 'mhchem', 'geometry' or the l3* packages needs fixing, but I
can't tell who is the culprit.

Unfortunately the mirror where the update happens from is no longer
shown. This is a flaw.

Message-ID: <b8b98abcf0655b843e6659fa6e45f0d7.squirrel@box5445.bluehost.com>

There is a bug that I think results from the fact that using the gui of
`install-tl` is now the default on macOS.

That bug is the following: the user now can't just do `./install-tl
--help` to get a list of available options.  If I try that, a gui gets
launched (which, to add insult to injury, doesn't even show a list of
options).  Even if I add to that command the string "-gui=text" it still
doesn't work.

Please bring back the ability to do a plain `./install-tl --help` and see,
*in the terminal*, a list of available options.

(Surely, for instance, the user should be able to do that in order to find
out what flag will turn *off* the gui!)

Subject: Executable bits for install-tl
Message-ID: <68f64b1ba7c7563a74952d415dbd0983.squirrel@box5445.bluehost.com>

My workflow whenever a new version of TL comes out is to use rsync to
clone the tlnet archive, and then run the `install-tl` script that's
contained in that clone to install TL from the local clone to a dir on my
machine.

I've noticed that when I do the initial rsyncing, `install-tl` isn't
executable.  This is despite the fact that I use the -E option with rsync.
 I think this means that the remote copy of `install-tl` isn't executable
(or else rsync would've made my local copy of it executable).

Can this be fixed?  Users should be able to just run ./install-tl after
rsyncing instead of having to mess with chmod.

Moreover, every time I use rsync to update my local clone of tlnet, the
executable bits for `install-tl` that I manually set will get removed. 
This is a pain, because then the user has to manually reset them if he
needs to re-install.

We have identified the issue. We are just agreeing a fix: it's possible 
that we will first back out some ideas then re-introduce them in a

install-tl is executable on tug, but not on ctan. CTAN folk, help?

Greetings

I have a question about the best practice to make my application
compatible with TeXLive.

I want to combine my bib* scipts (bibdoiadd, bibmradd, bibzbladd) into
a single bibadd binary.  I want to be able to call it as bibdoiadd,
bibmradd, bibzbladd, with different functionality.

I know how to do this under Unix:  I add to Makefile

ln -s bibadd bibdoiadd
etc

and in the program itself I check $0 to get the name the program was
called.

How to do this in compatible way so it works under Windows?

Good luck

Thanks for taking care. I just tried with latest l3kernel from the CTAN 
core server and I can confirm it solves the issue.

After todays update of dvipdfmx.win32 (on windows 10)
xelatex can no longer handle some math fonts:

Hi, I would like to see the status of the gpg signature check in 
TLShell. If gpg is present on that particular machine. In the old GUI 
that was a label after the path. In the cmdline interface this also 
works well as in tl2018.

It would give a nice feeling of safety if it would be also show in the 
TLShell. Especially if it would be highlighted by color (green verified 
or similar).

Or is this feature implemented and I only don't see it? Anyway I think 
this is a must have and should be implemented!

Thank you.

Hi Boris,

    I want to combine my bib* scipts (bibdoiadd, bibmradd, bibzbladd) into
    a single bibadd binary.  I want to be able to call it as bibdoiadd,
    bibmradd, bibzbladd, with different functionality.

First, independent of TL, but FWIW, I strongly suggest also having
cmdline options to specify the functionality, so that users can get the
functionality they want regardless of the invocation name.

    How to do this in compatible way so it works under Windows?

You don't have to do anything. When I see the upload on CTAN, I will
rearrange the import script to do the right thing, which will include
copying our generic Windows wrapper for all the names.  We have plenty
of other cases like this already, so it shouldn't be a problem.

    I know how to do this under Unix:  I add to Makefile

FYI, I don't use your (or anyone's) Makefile to import into TL; it's
just for you and people installing direct from CTAN. --best, karl.

    It seems ftp://tug.org is down.

It may seem that way, but it isn't so.  It is not down and has never
been down in recent times.

What is true, as I've said before, is that I have to impose strict
limits on the number of anonymous ftp logins. The problem is software
claiming the site is down when the real problem is that the max number
of connections are already active.

Using a standard command line ftp client will show in a meaningful error
message. The big browsers, etc., ignore the meaningful message and
report their stupid generic errors implying a problem at the server
end. They are wrong to do this, but I can't fix it. --best, karl.

The third item of the Basic Requirements section of this TUG webpage (
https://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html#requirements) says

3. The source for any generated documentation files (e.g., pdf) *must also
> be available* for the generated documentation to be included in TeX Live.

But I have found some exceptional cases:
 - Doc of package clrscode (
http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/clrscode.pdf)
 - Doc of package IEEEtran (
http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf)

Both docs are generated documentation files with no source. And both the
docs can be installed using tlmgr. This behavior is in-consistent with what
is said from the above TUG webpage.

Are there any allowable exceptional cases that source-free docs would be
included in TeX Live?

I'm in the unfortunate position of having to use TeXLive 20190410 on an offline CentOS7 system that is STIG'd meaning FIPS is enabled. I downloaded the offline tarballs and have successfully extracted the files into the correct directory structure. I can even build a pdf using texexec.....when FIPS is disabled. Unfortunately IT requires FIPS be enabled and that is when I receive an error trying to use texexec because under the covers somewhere it is using an MD5 hash for something.

I've done a large amount of scouring of online forums trying to find a workaround and have been unsuccessful thus far. I did some digging in the files contained in the tarballs and found things dealing with Digest::MD5 in tlpkg/TeXLive/TLCrypto.pm. I tried changing that file to use SHA1 but it made no difference.

Here is the exact error I'm receiving:
md5_dgst.c(82): OpenSSL internal error, assertion failed: Digest MD5 forbidden in FIPS mode!

I'm stuck with the machines provided and the IA/IT configuration so I need to find a way to make this work when FIPS is enabled. Any help is greatly appreciated.

You should ask the question on the ntg-context mailing list:
    https://mailman.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/ntg-context

But please note that:
- ConTeXt MKII which you seem to be using has been frozen for many
years (unless it's a trivial change needed, it is somewhat unlikely
that something would be fixed there).
- You should probably try "context" instead of "texexec". That said, I
somewhat doubt that you'll be able to get a cryptography-free
functionality. You might be able to get around the detection of its
use, but md5 is probably used for trivial stuff like checking whether
a file has changed, so that the speed can be optimized.

These files are completely unrelated to texexec.

Whatever that might mean and what consequences it has, I don't know.

Umpf ... yes we use md5 in some completely uncritical way (get a hash
value for saving copies of the downloaded tlpdb).

Anyway, you can fix this by editing 
	tlpkg/TeXLive/TLCrypto.pm
and change the following line from
	sub tl_short_digest { return (Digest::MD5::md5_hex(shift)); }
to
	sub tl_short_digest { return (Digest::SHA::sha1_hex(shift)); }

You can also remove the 
	use Digest::MD5;
near the top.

That *should* work, but I don't know what else might be problematic.

I have just installed new targets in the /etc/rsyncd.conf file for
rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu/, updated some of the sizes in their
descriptions, and added more internal comments to remind us of what
needs to be updated each year as new TeX Live builds begin.

There are currently 19 rsync targets, of which these apply for TeX
Live:

	% rsync rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu/ | grep ^texlive
	texlive         all of ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive [> 6GB]
	texlive-utah    all of ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/                    [> 13GB]
	texlive-utah-2016       all of ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2016/       [> 4GB]
	texlive-utah-2017       all of ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2017/       [about 1GB]
	texlive-utah-2018       all of ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2018/       [about 8GB]
	texlive-utah-2019       all of ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2019/       [> 13GB]

The texlive-utah target is an alias for the latest yearly directory,
now texlive-utah-2019, so there is no need to rsync both.  The short
alias is for the convenience of mirror sites that only want the latest
stuff.

The 2018 and 2019 directories contain Images/*.iso files that
contribute to their larger sizes.  Those *.iso files correspond to the
annual DVDs distributed by user groups.

Dear Tex Live,

I'm a Berlin-based journalist currently writing a *Nature* article about
LaTeX. We're looking at the pros and cons of using it and how to get
started.

A quick question. When users download Tex Live for a Linux OS, what editor
and compiler does it come with? Can users use this to write and compile a
.tex file out of the box?

MekTex comes with TeXworks, MacTex with TeXShop, but I couldn't find firm
evidence what editor the Linux version of TexLive comes with.

If you could get back to me by Friday that would be most appreciated.

Yours,

David Matthews

David Matthews asks on Mon, 13 May 2019 18:47:33 +0200 about
editor/compiler support for TeX Live on Linux systems.

The answer is that there are lots of choices for editor, because
human-prepared (La)TeX input files are just plain text, so almost any
editor will do.  Word processors will not, because they want to save
text with additional internal markup.

In the Linux world, some people are devotees of the vi family
(including vim and vile), and others prefer the emacs family
(including qe, jove, jed, xjed, zile, ....).  I'm firmly in the emacs
camp, because I exploit its programmability extensively to provide a
rich development environment.

Novices should just use whatever editor they already know.

As for the compilation question, that really doesn't apply, because
the 450+ executables in a TeX Live bin directory are already built
from source code for that platform, so TeX `just works', and works the
same on all platforms, for a given input file (sometimes, modulo
slight changes in typesetting due to different versions of TeX
packages at different sites).

Also, the question is not just for TeX Live, because most Linux
distributions include multiple packages for TeXware.  Thus, on many of
my diverse systems, I have installed the vendor-supplied packages for
TeX, plus multiple years of TeX Live releases, plus our local
historical TeX implementation.  Many Linux distributions base their
TeXware offerings on a TeX Live release, but not all do.

On some platforms, novices like to use a development environment that
provides for editing, typesetting, and viewing of documents, all from
the same interface.  Both the Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS
distributions of TeX Live provide such facilities.

I personally don't subscribe to that model, because it limits what one
can do, requires a GUI, and doesn't leverage the power of the make
utility for doing the right document preparation steps in the right
order, without unnecessary extra work. The worst limitation of the
GUIs is their editing capability, which is, for emacs users, far too
primitive, and idiosyncratic.  Emacs implementations can be found for
all major desktop platforms, and they work the same on all of them
from the user's viewpoint: my long-trained fingers then do the right
thing everywhere, no matter what the O/S is.

I generally agree with Nelson and want to add just a little bit.

You can find a lot of advices which editor is the best for each SW
tool. Of course, the shortcuts, toolbars, menus differ from editor to
editor. If you do other things, not just TeX, you will soon end up
with one editor for TeX, one for perl, one for python, one for C, one
for octave, one for bash, one for PHP, one for XML, ... And you will
soon be unable to work at all. It is necessary to make a compromise,
to find an editor suitable for all tasks a user needs although it is
not necessarilly the best for any of them. Emacs is very powerfull but
can be difficult for a novice. Personally I use vim and kate and do
not use any GUI tool.

The cons is that it is not WYSIWYG. The source is typed as a text with
macros and if you do not get a template file (e.g from journal
editors), the first steps can be difficult and painful. However, I
managed to teach the basics within half an hour so that a user was
able to start writing an article for a journal published by Elsevier.
I managed to tech several users that quickly.

The pros i that it is not WYSIWYG which improves users' imagination. A
user has to think what can fix to a line, to a paragraph, to a page
which leads to better typography. On the other hand, a user can
concentrate to the contents and just type the text without being
distracted by its appearance. The appearance is tuned later after the
contents is finished. TeX is multiplatform and is made in such a way
that the same source leads to the same result across platforms. The
source files are plain texts so that they can easily be stored in a
versioning system such as git or subversion, several authors can thus
collaborate and each of them can use a different OS. It is most
probably the best typesetting engine for math. Of course, images can
also be inserted. It also supports typesetting of multilingual texts.
Better examples can most probably be found elsewhere but a small
example of a book written in Czech with names written in Hindi and
some of them also in Urdu can be found here:

Dear David,
if you are interested in the basics of LaTeX, you'll find a brief
introduction here:

  https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

See also

  http://tug.org/books/

Some of the books can be freely downloaded as PDF but they all contain
much more than a beginner needs.  If you understand German, I even
recommend the German version of lshort.pdf

  https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/german/LaTeX2e-Kurzbeschreibung/l2kurz.pdf

because it's more compact.  The English version describes many
extension packages which a beginner doesn't need.

 > We're looking at the pros and cons of using it and how to get

Linux distributors split up TeX Live into several packages.  In order
to make sure that you've installed everything you need, run

  pdflatex sample2e.tex

This creates a file sample2e.pdf.  The file sample2e.tex is somewhere
in the TeX Live directory tree.  You can copy it to the current
working directory in order to inspect it:

  cp -p $(kpsewhich sample2e.tex) .

As you can see, one of LaTeX's biggest strength is typesetting math
formulas.  Another thing, which you might not see at a first glance,
is that content and layout are completely separated.  Thus you can use
the same content in a thesis as well as in a presentation.

LaTeX is also well supported.  There are many mailing lists and forums
where users can ask.  Nobody is left alone.

Yes, originally TeX Live could be run directly from a DVD without
installation.  For a couple of years the uncompressed system doesn't
fit on a DVD anymore.  But it's designed from the beginning to work
out of the box.

I suppose that with "compiler" you mean the program which converts
.tex to .pdf.  Most people use pdflatex though there are also lualatex
and xelatex.  Unless you have special requirements, pdflatex is a good
choice because it's described in most books.

 > MekTex

It's spelled MiKTeX.  According to its author, Christian Schenk, MiK
stands for MicroKid, as he called himself.

TeX Live provides a TeXworks binary only for Windows.  Linux users are
advised to use the TeXworks binary provided by the Linux distribution
they use.  But as Nelson Beebe already pointed out, any other text
editor can be used as well.  The main purpose of TeXworks is to
support beginners.  A programmer will always use the editor he's
accustomed to.

TeX Live works on all platforms in use today and is supposed to work
exactly the same way on all these platforms.

MacTeX is actually an unmodified TeX Live system with graphical
maintenance tools adapted to Apple's look-and-feel.  It also provides
a few programs which are ubiquitous on Linux but not part of OS X
(Ghostscript, for instance).  AFAIK MacTeX provides both, TeXShop and
TeXworks.

If you need more information, don't hesitate to ask.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I see you already have some good answers, but wanted to emphasize that
LaTeX was designed to separate decisions controlling appearance separate
from the content of a document.  Appearance is controlled by the document
class.   Many publishers provide
latex classes adapted to the style of their journals.   Users who are
familiar with WSIWYG document preparation systems often end up fighting
with the basic classes (article, book, or report) to mimic a particular
style because they don't realize that the publisher provides a LaTeX class
that uses widely available fonts to authors while internally they may use a
different version of the class or translate LaTeX to some proprietary
formatting engine.

People creating their first LaTeX document are often unsure that their
markup is correct, so look for an editing environment that is closer to
WSIWYG.  Many editors offer mild forms of assistance such as verifying that
opening brackets have a closing bracket and highlighting markup commands
"\xxx" are not standard LaTeX.  Many starting users will find it better to
look for LaTeX support from their favourite text editor.

LaTeX is part of a large document processing ecosystem.  For documents with
minimal mathematics content, there are simpler widely used markup language
such as "markdown" and robust translators such as "pandoc" that can
translate markdown to
LaTeX and other formats such as html or PDF (often following translation to
LaTeX).  Users new to LaTeX may be able to recycle
large portions of existing documents.

Those getting started with LaTeX should seek the assistance of a co-worker
or colleague who uses LaTeX.  The internet has a wealth of advice for LaTeX
users, much of it is helpful, but some that is outdated, and some that is
just wrong.

this is very used in the mathematic community, where LaTeX is used
(and mandatory, actually).

One of the pro for LaTeX is the possibility to write something else
than just  text, like music scores (MusiXTeX) or chemical formula

In case this "pro" wasn't mentioned: Backward compatibility
A tex document from 1995 will compile also today, and will look the very 
same.

A tex document from 1995 will compile also today, and will look the very same.

Yes, if by "a tex document" you mean exactly that, and not a LaTeX document or other format that inherently depends on more than one file.  Whilst TeX itself is stable, LaTeX and analogous systems are not, constantly evolving to meet new needs or to address bugs.  I have a LaTeX document that will produce identical results in versions of TeX Live from 2009 to 2016; at 2017 it starts to break, and by 2019 it does nothing (useful) at all.  If you really want to ensure that a document will typeset identically in the future, then you will need to archive not only the source file itself but all files on which it depends.

Hello,

I don't know if you are looking for first-time TeX/LaTeX user experiences,
but mine was fairly typical, I think.

On a group research project, the lead investigator was writing a report and
he was using LaTeX.  I had never used it before but I was assured that I
could still contribute.  The instructions given to me verbally, via email,
and repeated within the .tex file, "Type all your text between the "%"
delimited comments with your name and return the document to me with all
your graphics attached to the email".  The .tex file was a mystery to me,
but my instructions were easy.  I was astounded at the final report.  It
was beautiful!

Since then, I use Tex Live because it always has everything I need to
create great looking documents.  For group writing, git and Zotero/JabRef
nicely complement LaTeX.  I do use TeXstudio for editing, mostly because I
don't write enough to stay "fluent" in Emacs, nor LaTeX.  TeXstudio's
highlighting and prompting/completion is very helpful for occasional
writers.  I have repeated the group writing experience with new LaTeX'ers
by having them type all their text between delimiters, and it seems to be a
good introduction.  They are universally amazed at the final result of
their first non-WYSIWYG editing experience.

Best regards,
Richard Graham

Subject: TeX Live 2019 severe issue: destroyed page formatting of the geometry
 package
Message-ID: <f19aa0a8-4683-6344-12d6-ab2e86c4ba39@hppi.de>


Hello Tex Live 2019 team,

I figured out a severe TeX Live 2019 issue regarding the geometry
(https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry?lang=de) package.

Please compile the attached example

<<main.tex>>

using TeX Live *2018 *and TeX Live *2019 *and compare the result.

The page formatting using TeX Live *2019 *is completely destroyed on
page 2 onward, which is not the case for TeX Live *2018*.

I am not sure if the failure is on my side, how I use the geometry package.
But I use it now for >10 years in the same way and had no problems with
different TeX Live releases.

Best regards,
Werner Simbuerger

Subject: Patgen
Message-ID: <7a11b317-f885-7b08-36e1-41596b89fb5f@abgol.de>

Patgen 2.4 (TeX Live 2019) has some problems with huge input lists.
I have a input list with over 11.000.000 entries, which I need to 
prepare new hyphenation patterns for classical Latin, a heavily 
inflected language.
The percentages output by patgen during the run are erroneous. The sum 
of good and missed hyphens should be 100 %, but this is not the case. 
Even negative percentages occur.
Furthermore, patgen aborts in the seventh run with a "PATGEN capacity 
exceeded" message.
The patgen logs of the first and the seventh run are attached.

Is it possible to adapt patgen for such huge lists?

I see no difference between 2018 and 2019.

You fail to notice the warning

Package Fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
Make it at least 44.7913pt.
We now make it that large for the rest of the document.
This may cause the page layout to be inconsistent, however.

Ciao
Enrico

There was a nice talk two weeks ago:
    http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2019-en/program#section-55
but the author might need a push to publish the slides sooner :)

The talk listed all patgen "rewrites" that would probably get the task
done. One example includes https://github.com/hyphenation/hydra, and
Ryszard wrote his own implementation in Python as well. (Further
options were listed in the talk)

Hi Enrico,

we can close the case.

With large documents I can confirm, that my inconsistent page layout
("Package Fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt)")
was the root cause for the wrong page formatting in TL 2019.
In TL 2018 the inconsistent page layout did not cause a problem.
Maybe TL 2019 is less tolerant or behaves different in handling the page
layout inconsistency regarding the specific package interaction between
"fancyhdr" and "geometry".

However,? in my case, changing

\geometry{a4paper,tmargin=35mm,bmargin=20mm,lmargin=15mm,rmargin=15mm,headsep=25mm,footskip=8mm}


to

\geometry{a4paper,left=14mm,right=14mm,top=38mm,bottom=18mm,head=33mm,headsep=0mm,foot=6mm}


did solve the issue.

Thank you for pointing me to inconsistent page layout.

Best regards,
Werner

  If you?re able to compile patgen yourself, it should be enough to
change trie_size and triec_size in patgen.ch, currently set to
10,000,000 and 5,000,000 respectively.  It is possible that the
percentages still will look silly because they?re computed as

	100 * good_count / ((double) good_count + miss_count)

so that the numerator could result in an integer overflow considering
the orders of magnitude we?re talking about: with 11 million entries,
good_count could easily be over 22 million, which multiplied by a
hundred will be more than can fit in a signed 32-bit integer.  I am
however not able to test it myself because the public repository for
Classical Latin hyphenation currently only produce a list of a little
over 2 million entries (I suppose you?re running patgen from the script
in https://github.com/wehro/hyphen-la/tree/master/patterns/generation).

	Best,

		Arthur

Thank you for your advice. I will make a try.
It is perhaps better to use brackets for the calculation to avoid the 
overflow.

	100 * (good_count / ((double) good_count + miss_count))

The correct location is 
https://github.com/gregorio-project/hyphen-la/tree/master/patterns/generation
All you need is the script "generate-patterns.sh" (and lua5.3 installed).
Unfortunately, I did not push the most recent change, which extends the 
list by a factor of 4. I have done that now.

    change trie_size and triec_size in patgen.ch, currently set to
    10,000,000 and 5,000,000 respectively

If someone can tell me the maximum values for trie_* which don't
overflow, I'll change the .ch file ... maybe also they could be
changeable at runtime (texmf.cnf or options) if the code can end up
taking advantage of 64 bit numbers. I don't know ... --thanks, karl.

I have tried it out. The maximum values are 110.021.182 and 55.000.006 
(I don't know why).
So far, these values are sufficient for my purpose.

The overflow within the calculation of the percentages can by avoided 
using brackets (see attached patch).

Subject: Possibility of adding -aux-directory flag to TeXLive (similar to
 MikTeX's option)
Message-ID: <AM0PR06MB4147B3BF4A2A6589A7756F3FE50B0@AM0PR06MB4147.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

The '--aux-directory' is a convenient flag provided by MikTeX's version of 'pdflatex'.  This leaves the generated PDF file in the root of the main project, while moving other generated files to the aux directory.

TeXLive only has the '--output-directory' option, which we know is not quite the same (doesn't play well with `\include` etc). Can TeXLive developers consider adding this option as a feature request in Tl2020?

Regards,
Krishna

Compiling with gcc on centos7, I get link warnings with that value for
triec_size (trie_size was ok):

  patgen.o: In function `initialize':
  .../source/Work/texk/web2c/patgen.c:178:(.text+0x2e9):
  relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_32S against symbol `xchr'
  defined in COMMON section in patgen.o

To avoid the warning, I had to reduce the latter value to
@!triec_size=54677566;

So I committed that (plus the 100* reordering), r51154.

I hope that value still works for you. And I hope it is not something
about the memory or compiler or something else particular to a given
machine. --thanks, karl.

Indeed, I checked that
- texlive.tlpdb is correct
- texlive.tlpdb.sha512 is correct
BUT
- texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc is wrong on that server. I can only guess
  that the mirror wasn't properly updated.

Thanks for reporting this!

@CTAN: I have seen similar comments about huaweicloud already two times
here, I think we should drop this mirror from all lists, if possible.

All the best

Subject: [Windows][Installer] Always use own xz
Message-ID: <20190521051345.GA915@smoon.vl-lomov.ru>

Hello, this is a bug report.

Yesterday I tried to help to install TeX Live on a notebook of a student
and faced with weird behavior of install-tl-windows.bat. The notebook
has a broken mingw (not sure msys or msys2) installation so xz.exe from
it doesn't work.

I thought that the installer on Windows always uses it's own wget.exe and
xz.exe but seems I was wrong. Are there any particular reasons to use
xz.exe and wget.exe found in PATH instead of own ones? If there are no
reasons then I think it is a bug and should be fixed, otherwise it might
give unexpected errors (I faced with that one).

P.S. The student shares the notebook with other person, so she doesn't
control it at full and doesn't know how to fix the broken mingw
installation.

  These values were reported to cause linker problems, similar to the
CentOS one, on NetBSD.  Reducing them to 109,000,000 and 54,500,000
fixes the problem there, but it seems to me that we should be a little
more prudent and go all the way down to

	@!trie_size=100000000;
	@!triec_size=50000000;

  Can you try out if these values work for you?

	Best,

Thank you Herbert, I forgot about that variable, but I asked not how to
overcome the system tools (i.e. that found in PATH) on Windows, my point
was why on Windows installer prefer to use system tools instead of it's
own?

The particular case I faced I instantly figured out what is wrong, but
it was me, the student was surprised and said "it doesn't work, Ok, I'll
try something other", she even didn't understand the origin of the error
message (it was about missing liblzma.dll). I was in rush and simply
changed the PATH variable (important this is all on Windows!) and
started the installation. Unfortunately, she had to go and interrupted
the installation process. I recommended to fix the problem (she told me
that she is not the only person who uses that notebook) and try to
install TeX Live again.

I appreciate that TeX Live could use system tools on Windows but I think
TeX Live _on Windows_ must use it's own tools (wget, xz and tar) by
default and allows to use system tool when a env. variable, say
TEXLIVE_PREFER_SYSTEM_TOOLS, is set.

I didn't get it and I'm updating through dante. Which version for
the lua-modules do you see if you compile a hello-world-latex

error).

Sorry, I seem to have misread that, it was indeed lualibs - working on

Hello,

I get the following error message when trying to install tex live:

Error in startup script
no files matched glob pattern "*" while executing

I attached a picture of the problem.

It would be nice if someone could solve this problem.

Thank you!

Hello:

When I try to Typeset BibTeX I get the error: ?The program /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-darwin/bibtex does not exist?.

However, if I type 

which bibtex

I get 

/usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-darwin/bibtex

The same location is specified in TeXShop Preferences.

If I use line command ?bibtex whateverfile? the bibtex works correctly.

Am I doing something wrong in TeXShop or this might be a bug?

Thank you,
Paul

Paul Cizmas,

I tried an example on the latest TeX, TeXLive-2019,  and everything worked normally. This was using the latest TeXShop, 4.27. 

Then I switched to TeXLive-2018 and tried the experiment again. Everything worked normally.

It is difficult to diagnose why this didn't work for you, but as a first step I suggest you open the TeXShop Help Panel in the TeXShop Help menu, go to "Advanced Help" and select BibTeX. This section contains a short bib file, and a short latex file (you have to add your own preamble to the latex file). The section explains very clearly one way to call LaTeX, BibTeX, LaTeX, LaTeX in sequence. Please try this exact example, using exactly the steps suggested in the help file. Then write me. This will help determine if something is misconfigured in your setup, or if, instead, you are using BibTeX in a manner that I did not anticipate.

I see a line

i.e. your downloaded installer dated from april 10. Please download
a fresh installer.

Okay, it seems to work now. I had to delete the folder C:\\textlive which
was still there (but empty) after a canceled installation before..

I could reproduce your problem if C:\texlive\2019 already existed.
Shall look into it.

Should be in tomorrow's release. However, it currently only shows

Subject: biber libcrypt dependency in Fedora
Message-ID: <220518e2b2e3c3f759fbb9ffbe85399712ccf6cb.camel@gmail.com>

Hello,

Biber links to the shared library libcrypt.so.1.
Fedora has replaced libcrypt with an alternative
based on libxcrypt to resolve security problems (
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt
). 

Users have to install a compatibility package
manually or biber will not run (
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/493231/biber-missing-libcrypt-so-1-library-on-fedora/493232#493232
). 

Can this problem be avoided so users don't have to
mess with shared libraries?

Best,

Subject: Fix missing Unicode functions with HarfBuzz 2.5.0
Message-ID: <20190530000433.GA10208@macbook.localdomain>

Hi all,

After the updating HarfBuzz to 2.5.0 the shaping is broken in HarfTeX,
which was caused by missing Unicode functions because TeX Live build
defines HB_NO_UNICODE_FUNCS.

HarfBuzz 2.5.0 always prefers its own built-in Unicode functions, but
when HB_NO_UNICODE_FUNCS is defined it will not set any Unicode
functions at all.

This wasn?t an issue in previous releases because when HAVE_ICU and
HAVE_ICU_BUILTIN were defined it would still use ICU Unicode functions
even if HB_NO_UNICODE_FUNCS was defined.

I think TeX Live build was defining HB_NO_UNICODE_FUNCS because it
wasn?t initially defining HAVE_ICU_BUILTIN and thus the build would
error because no Unicode functions were defined, but this was not needed
after defining HAVE_ICU_BUILTIN.

Next step is to drop the ICU dependency from HarfBuzz and fix XeTeX to
not require it as HarfBuzz?s own Unicode functions should be enough, but
that is another patch.

Regards,
Khaled

Here are two patches, one that stops XeTeX from using hb-icu
(conditional at build-time on HarfBuzz 2.5.0 so that Linux distributions
can still build XeTeX against older versions of HarfBuzz that might not
have built-in Unicode functions enabled). The other patch drops ICU
dependency from HarfBuzz since it is no longer needed, this allows other
consumers of HarfBuzz (e.g. HarfTeX) to avoid ICU dependency if they are
not directly using it.

Khaled

Dear Khaled,

I applied three pathces in r51269, and r51270.
If I'm wrong, please correct in the TeX Live svn.

Thanks,
Akira

Message-ID: <CAF6MmLXn2+NbYesgWETHkUH0KDTE4h8b9kL9za-6hvOnZJYHNg@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern:

I have been getting messages like the following fairly frequently the last
couple days:

./tlmgr: signature verification error of /tmp/u9ddx8hJ1T/4mcBh8Y3Tf from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb:
cryptographic signature verification of
  /tmp/u9ddx8hJ1T/SYAN2PCrWR
against

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc
failed. Output was
gpg: Signature made Wed May 29 23:39:33 2019 UTC using RSA key ID 19438C70
gpg: BAD signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>"

Please report to texlive at tug.org

I can usually install the desired packages after a couple of attempts, but
I thought I might as well report it.

I'm just using the default texlive installer from
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz without
changing any of the settings myself. Building the attached Dockerfile fails
frequently on the last step (but not all of the time).

Best regards,
Daniel Abercrombie

Hi Daniel,

Hmm,
$ wget http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
..
$ wget http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512

$ wget http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc
..
$ sha512 -c texlive.tlpdb.sha512
texlive.tlpdb: OK
$ gpg --verify texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc 
gpg: assuming signed data in 'texlive.tlpdb.sha512'
gpg: Signature made Thu 30 May 2019 08:39:33 AM JST

gpg: Good signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>" [full]
Primary key fingerprint: C78B 82D8 C795 12F7 9CC0  D7C8 0D5E 5D91 06BA B6BC

$

So I can only assume that you are hitting the servers consistently when
the servers are being updated (rsync). Any other explanation would be
surprising to me.

If you hit that again, can you try the above? 
And retry 1h later or so?

Thanks

Norbert

Tlcritical is no longer needed: the required infrastructure changes
are now in the regular release.

Howdy,

Today's update to the libertinus-otf package seems to fail with the simple input

on a fully updated TeX Live 2019. I don't know how to get in touch with Herbert Vo? so am sending the note here.

Good Luck,

Yes, I created a bug ... ;-)
Use the version from today on CTAN or wait for tomorrow
or use lualatex.
