Hello,
today installed TeX Live 2020 (install-tl-20200430, install-tl (TeX
Live Cross Platform Installer) revision 54622) on linux Fedora 32 in
custom dir (/opt/texlive/2020). Problem with man path: missing
symbolic link to "../../texmf-dist/doc/man" on "man" in
"/opt/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux" directory.

texliveonfly for Windows requires at least a small
modification. We asked the author, but he didn't respond.
I don't know it works or not, even after the modification.

    Problem with man path: missing
    symbolic link to "../../texmf-dist/doc/man" on "man" in
    "/opt/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux" directory.

What expected it to be there?

I intentionally removed it for everything but Mac because it was causing
a bit of pain for redistributors and I didn't think any other system
cared about it. I use CentOS, which is probably the same man program as
Fedora, and I've never noticed that it cares about man/ subdirectories
in PATH directories.

The messages I exchanged with Johannes about it start here (other topics too):
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-April/045422.html

Best,
Karl

Dear Yu Jin,
if disk space is scarce a valuable option is to extend it by a USB
stick.  This is what I do successfully on my Raspberry Pi for years.

Sure, a USB stick is slower than a hard drive or an SSD and
unbelievable slow on Windows.  But it's an option at least since USB
sticks are quite cheap nowadays.

I also think that it's a temporary issue because the next computer you
buy will definitely have more disk space than you ever need.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello Karl,

I noticed that while the latest version of `expkv-cs` found its way into
TeX Live, `expkv-def` didn't. They were updated on the same day to the
same version number with the same announcement text, so I guess it was
overlooked.

Could you please update the catalogue to include `expkv-def` version 0.3?

Best
Jonathan

I refreshed keys but nothing changed.

What's the problem? Why is it expired?

All looks normal here :? early on in the run it reports "not verified: gpg unavailable", which I seem to recall it always does here (I confess that it has never bothered me), and then goes on to report :

I have found one mirror that does not report an error. All others I've tried do.

I take it in your case verification is not even attempted, so you would be bypassing the issue entirely.

At my end gpg (which *is* available on these machines) tries to verify the key and it fails, on every single mirror I have tried (including the ox.ac.uk one you mention) but one (see below).

I have tried:

http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/
http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/
http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/
http://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/
http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/
http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/

all reporting the same bad signature made 

Fri 01 May 2020 07:58:00 PM EDT
using RSA key 4CE1877E19438C70

The one mirror so far that doesn't error out is

http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CTAN/


PS

All links above need to be expanded with the suffix 'systems/texlive/tlnet' to create actual mirror URLs.

Yes, I think that that is probably the case.

Hi,

I can confirm there's a problem, after trying to update from my own
mirror, which mirrored at 1300 CEST

$ tlmgr update -self -all

Please try from a different mirror and/or wait a few minutes
and try again; usually this is because of transient updates.
If problems persist, feel free to report to texlive at tug.org.

Dear all,

please calm down a but. We have moved servers yesterday and it seems
there are some hiccups.

The key signature has been extended already:
$ gpg --edit-key 0x0D5E5D9106BAB6BC
Secret subkeys are available.

pub  rsa2048/0x0D5E5D9106BAB6BC
     created: 2016-03-19  expires: never       usage: SC  
     trust: unknown       validity: full
ssb  rsa2048/0x72A5E8C1B001980F
     created: 2016-03-19  expires: never       usage: E   
ssb  rsa2048/0x4CE1877E19438C70
     created: 2016-03-19  expires: 2021-07-30  usage: S   
[  full  ] (1). TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>


so it is valid till 2021-07-30.

Please wait a few days until we have cleaned up the server move.

Thanks

Norbert

If really absolutely must run 'tlmgr update' now, you can add option

   --verify-repo=none

until the servers are up-to-date again.

I find it interesting that even adding that command-line option I still see :

> C:\Windows\system32>tlmgr update --self --all --verify-repo=none
> tlmgr.pl: package repository http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: gpg unavailable)
> tlmgr.pl: saving backups to C:/TeX/Live/2020/tlpkg/backups

Why does it still report "not verified: gpg unavailable" when it was told not to attempt verification ?

Hi TexLive team,

I update my TexLive distribution daily. This morning I get consistently 
errors with tlmgr update:

/Library/TeX/texbin/tlmgr: signature verification error of 
/usr/local/texlive/2020/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.[EDITED] from 
http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb: 
cryptographic signature verification of

against
http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc
failed. Output was:
gpg: Signature made Sat May? 2 00:58:00 2020 BST
gpg:??????????????? using RSA key [EDITED]
gpg: BAD signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>" 
[ultimate]

Please try from a different mirror and/or wait a few minutes
and try again; usually this is because of transient updates.
If problems persist, feel free to report to texlive at tug.org.


It was working properly yesterday.

What steps should I take to fix this issue?

Hi,

running

# tlmgr update --self

yields

/opt/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr: signature verification error of /opt/texlive/2020/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.2884af53275b1f677f2a9cc601eb13d0 from https://ctan.kako-dev.de/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb: cryptographic signature verification of

failed. Output was:
gpg: Signature made Sa 02 Mai 2020 01:58:00 CEST using RSA key ID 19438C70
gpg: BAD signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>"

Please try from a different mirror and/or wait a few minutes
and try again; usually this is because of transient updates.
If problems persist, feel free to report to texlive at tug.org.

 From what I can tell, it seems like the signature wasn't updated for 
2020-05-03.

At the moment https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg 
shows 2020-05-02 for the signature.

I tried multiple mirros with the same result.

Should this be a problem on my end, any pointers to resolve this would 
be very welcome.

Cheers :)

Hi Phil,

> Why does it still report "not verified: gpg unavailable" when it was told not to attempt verification ?

Well, maybe you need to brush up your English, but it says what it says,
namely that
	gpg is unavailable
or in other words, there is no gpg binary accessible in the path of your
machine.

That is all ... ;-)

Well, let us not get into semantics, but "not verified", when it has been explicitly told not to attempt verification, still seems rather strange to me.

Which, on thinking about it a bit more, is not unlike being stopped by the police, and when asked "why", they respond "because you were not speeding, Sir".? With the implied suggestion "we just wanted to make you aware of that fact" !

FYI, trying to install via online installer and getting a bad signature that is preventing the rest of the install. Looks like the signature was just created on Friday.

It's not evident there, but I selected the (only) UK repository as well as
the default repository (in Germany), but I received the same error.

I will try again later as instructed, but is this issue known and in hand?

No worries, mate!  I use Firefox and Mozilla frequently lets their

Actually, it expired and was renewed beginning of April ... we are still
contemplating what has happened.

I expect after the addition bin to system PATH (export PATH), man and

Hi,

I am on voidlinux with the latest texlive package. It was working smoothly
till yesterday. All of the sudden `tlmgr` started giving signature
verification error as follows:

The key list shows:

Thus, I am stuck as `tlmgr` cannot proceed anything further. Any clue
appreciated.

Hi,

this could be a reappearance of

the only thing I found.
When running
sudo tlmgr update --self repository ctan && sudo tlmgr update --list
repository ctan && sudo tlmgr update --all repository ctan
the last part, i.e., sudo tlmgr update --all repository ctan, fails with a
signature verification error.
The same happens when running sudo tlmgs gui and choosing the standard

Hi List,

OK, so I've spent all day trying to whittle down a document to an MWE. The
problem turns out to be rather messy, so I'll see if I can describe it
verbally, and then we can discuss whether it makes sense to send a
not-very-minimal example.

So here's what's happening. I have a document with figure-wrap floats,
several foreign languages, some musical characters, and footnotes. I'm
using polyglossia for languages. Here's the breakage condition:

a figure wrap float, in the caption of which is a word in Greek, due to
formatting runs off the page. On the *next* page is a footnote containing
the musical characters (flats and sharps), in English. For whatever reason,
it's throwing an error that these glyphs are missing in the *Greek* font.
Sometimes it allows me to show the output anyway, and those glyphs -- even
though they're in text coded as US-English, using a font for which they are
present, they nevertheless show up as blanks in the footnote, but are
displayed in the main text.

If you prefer, I can attach that one page as pdf. But since the MWE
involves a specifically long figure, a long length of text, and enough
different language settings to get several languages into the document,
it's not going to be terribly small.

Another option to try to get around this would be to use a Greek font that
has the codepoints for musical characters available. Is there one?

Sorry this is so messy. My documents always end up being a bit ?
avant-garde.

Cheers,

A

PS- update. I've managed to get a use-case that works with a small
document, attached here.

The breakage is now as following: if a figure caption has a foreign
language in it, footnotes on the same page are rendered in the same font as
that foreign-language word, and missing glyphs throw an error.

I hope that's minimal enough. I'm not sure If that's related to the weird
percentage-width error I was seeing before, but I *did* see that error on
one compilation run.

You can insert a picture of your choosing into the float. It doesn't seem
to matter.

Cheers,

I have no idea what a "Lyx" document is, but nor can I see any mention of "percentage" in your problem description whilst the subject line reads "Re: Percentage width doesn't work with recent texlive" ? can you clarify both aspects, please ?

On the *next* page is a footnote containing the musical characters (flats and sharps), in English. For whatever reason, it's throwing an error that these glyphs are missing in the *Greek* font. Sometimes it allows me to show the output anyway, and those glyphs -- even though they're in text coded as US-English, using a?font for which they are present, they nevertheless show up as blanks in the footnote, but are displayed in the main text.

Hi List, Philip, David,

Sorry for the mix-up. Attached is the tex export of this document. I note a
couple things. At the part of the file dealing with the wrap, there are the
lines:
-----------------
\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\columnwidth}%
\begin{centering}
------------------
I think this percentage-sign is what's causing the weird error about
needing a number at that point. In the full document, that's what's causing
the failure, but it's also throwing errors about the invalid glyphs.

How should that line be formatted?

Cheers,

A

The "per-cent" sign indicates the start of a TeX comment, nothing more.? I will try to look at your code shortly.

Your inline version compiles fine; I will look at the attachment next.

Thanks to all of you and others for reporting the painfully expired
TeX Live GPG key. Last night I made a new TL update on tug.org that, I
dearly hope, fixes the problem (and updates many packages). Please give
it a day or two to get around CTAN. --best, karl.

OK, looking beyond compilation errors (none: the %-sign was clearly not causing a problem), I see :

I'd suggest to use package `scrlayer' or `scrlayer-scrpage', because they support KOMA-Script classes. With `fancyhdr' several features of class `scrbook' like options `headsepline', `footsepline' or command `\MakeMarkcase' and the commands `\setkomafont' and `\addtokomafont' for the page style elements need explicite user intervention to work. Nevertheless, using requested package `fancyhdr' on input line 10.

So I guess you're saying that the man (and info?! seems unlikely)
program on Fedora automatically looks for man/ subdirectories in the
directories along PATH.

Well, that was exactly what I didn't know, and didn't think ever
happened on anything but Macs. I still can't find any documentation
about it, but whatever.  Ok, I guess I'll have to put the
bin/PLATFORM/man links back, ugly as they are. Sorry, Johannes.

Nothing specifically about info was changed. I can't guess what's going
on there. --best, karl.

Hi Youry - I believe the amd64-freebsd binaries in TL20 were built on 
FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE-p1, which presumably explains the error.
(That's what the volunteer builder needed to use this year, as I recall.)

Since apparently you already built your own, you could just use those :).
But if for whatever reason you want another set, Nelson Beebe has built TL
on a vast array of systems, including FreeBSD 11.3 (static and not). You
can get his binaries here:
http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/bin/

And use them via the --custom-bin option to install-tl:
https://tug.org/texlive/custom-bin.html

Hope this helps,
Karl

Thanks Karl. I think we have 3 options (on Linux):

PATH=/opt/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux

1) default "ugly"
$ pwd
/opt/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux
$ ln -s ../../texmf-dist/doc/man man

2) maybe more "elegant"
$ pwd
/opt/texlive/2020/bin
$ ln -s ../texmf-dist/doc/man man

3) work man + info
$ pwd
/opt/texlive/2020/bin
$ ln -s ../texmf-dist/doc share

Personally I prefer option 2

Message-ID: <20200505092116.GA5245@robertalessi.net>

Hello,

I don't know why, but it just so happens that this morning the font
search dialog of my emacs does not work anymore.  After opening a file
as simple as this one:

   \documentclass{article}

   \usepackage{fontspec}

   \begin{document}

   \end{document}

invoking C-C C-M then "setmainfont" brings me a font search dialog, as
expected, but this dialog is unable to search for anything.  Whatever
I type, I run into a No match error.

I didn't change anything in my settings, so I wonder if anyone has
noticed the same error in the last few days.

Best,

Robert

For what it's worth:  I tried to reinstall the previous version of
luaotfload and the font search dialog of emacs worked again.

For the record, AUCTeX calls 'luaotf-load --list=basename' to get the
list of fonts.

Seems to be a side effect to get file globbing working. We will look
at it.

But

  luaotfload-tool --list=basename:*

should work.

Thank you, it works.  Then a simple way to get this to work would be

The problem has been already corrected in the sources. I will upload
a corrected version as soon as possible.

Is there a switch to change back to the old behavior?

Yes, we save the output of external commands (mktexlsr, updmap, fmtutil,
mtxlua) into the log file to help debugging in case of errors.
We prefix each line with "(cmd)" so you can use
	grep -v
or similar tools to get rid of these lines.

Dear Tex Live,

I am a non-technical user of LaTeX, I use it on my computer under Ubuntu 
(now under 20.04).

I am convinced that LaTeX is a very powerful tool when composing texts. 
I do not doubt that it is so and that every good writer will understand 
it that way.

For the same reason of being a non-technical user, I have big problems 
when installing Tex Live. All the help I find seems to be written for a 
user experienced in the use of Linux and all of us who are not experts 
are a bit relegated.

The reason for this email is simply to express the point of view of a 
user who understands the power of the tool but who, at the time of its 
installation, sees complications that are difficult to avoid, if he is 
not an expert user.

When everything works correctly, the "Tex Live Guide" is a good help, 
but when there are doubts or something does not work, it is difficult to 
find help, at the level of a non-expert user.

Thanks for reading my email and thanks for developing Tex Live

Kind regards

Jerem?as

If you consider yourself a non-technical user, you may be better off
installing the texlive package from the Ubuntu repositories.

If you restore the link like e.g. option 2,
then "man a2ping" gives you a manpage?

Please post your $PATH here, maybe also $MANPATH.

Hi Jeremias - thanks for your comments. Siep's response of using a
distro TeX is a good one. Here are my thoughts.

No one document can suffice for all needs. If you can tell me what went
wrong for you, I can try to improve the documentation, somewhere,
somehow.

Meanwhile, this web page is my attempt at distilling the installation process:
https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

But even there, I try to at least acknowledge Windows, Mac, other
issues, so it's longer than it needs to be for any particular case.

The absolute minimum for a full GNU/Linux installation in the standard
directories and with A4 paper would be:

cd /tmp # or whatever temp working dir you like
wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar xf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-* # the directory will be named with the date
perl install-tl
.. messages omitted, just a single command is needed: ...
I
.. long installation, lots of downloads, etc. ...

Assuming the install succeeds (there will be a happy welcome message), add
  /usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux
to your PATH in whatever startup file, log out and log back in,
and enjoy TeX.

For letter size paper by default, after installation, run:
tlmgr paper letter

Hope this helps somehow,
Karl

I thought the key is always updated all the key servers. However, even though I import the key from this keyserver again, gpg always tells me that the key used for the signature has expired. I don't know how to proceed.

Hi

> Well, as you can see also in https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=tex-live&fingerprint=on&hash=on&op=vindex, it doesn't appear to have been renewed.

Irrelevant, it doesn't depend on what is on some arbitrary key server.
We ship the public key in texlive.infra and thus the correct key is
available during verification.

Anyway, I have updated the ubuntu keyserver with the current version.
I not even know how the key came there...

We don't use any keyservers for verification in TeX Live. Thus,
keyservers **might** be up to date or not. As I said already, we *ship*
the public key.

How to you check the verification status? Do you use tlmgr? If yes, then
it should use the --homedir where we ship the public key.

Which version of TeX Live are you using.

Hi,
as I said in the first message, I downloaded texlive2020.iso. When I verify the sha512 with gpg signature, I receive this message

gpg: Signature made 04/06/20 15:40:20 ora legale Europa occidentale
gpg:                using RSA key 4CE1877E19438C70
gpg: Good signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>" [unknown]
gpg: Note: This key has expired!
Primary key fingerprint: C78B 82D8 C795 12F7 9CC0  D7C8 0D5E 5D91 06BA B6BC
    Subkey fingerprint: D8F2 F860 57A8 57E4 2A88  106A 4CE1 877E 1943 8C70

I refreshed keys from gpg but nothing changed. Then I tried to retrieve the keys from other keyservers, given that in another message (https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-April/045332.html) I read that the expired key was renewed so I thought it was my problem.

Given that I don't have tlmgr yet, where could I get the correct key to import and verify the sha512 with gpg signature?

Best regards

I don't know which key server you used, but for example using

	curl -fsSL 'https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xc78b82d8c79512f79cc0d7c80d5e5d9106bab6bc' | gpg --import -

you can get an up to date key.

@Karl: We should better link the key to the front page, the texlive.asc
from my home dir.

I support that.

Also, can we get the creator(s) of the *.iso images to sign them as well?
So far, we have only *.md5 and *.sha256 checksum files for validating
correct downloads, but not for validating original contents.

Those key(s) too should be on the TUG Web site, and I'll put
them on http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/ as well.

And you have the detached signatures for the sha512 files.

That means you can:
- check that the sha512 is correctly signed with our key
- then check that the iso image has the correct sha512

This is the correct way to do verification, directly signing the .iso is
rather cumbersome and doesn't make sense.

I strongly support that, too. In this way, you can download the public key directly from the TUB website, download the iso from a mirror  and verify sha512 signature without problems. I spent a lot of time trying to retrieve the key and this will resolve the problem.

Thanks Norbert for uploading the key in the ubuntu keyserver. I was able to import that and finally verify the sha512 signature.

Message-ID: <CAGvOPVWsCFW27K0LLhB_hV6P0+iGbsdtZmDLj1FB8b7pKcFqNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've noticed a lot of chatter on this mailing list lately about failed
signature verification for TeX Live 2020 due to expired GPG keys. This is
also
something that I have noticed on my CI systems, but my builds seem to be
green again now.

..except for one particular build, which is a bit peculiar - so I hope you
guys might help me shed some light on what is going wrong.

On my CI, I build my own LaTeX document class (not published to CTAN) with
different TeX distributions (TeX Live, MiKTeX, proTeXt), and do that for
both
the latest versions and historic versions on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Right
now, all the builds are green, except for the one that tries to install
TeX Live 2019 (via MacTeX) on macOS. For this build, the installation script
looks something like this:

  wget
http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/mactex/2019/mactex-basictex-20191011.pkg
  sudo installer -verbose -pkg ./mactex-basictex-20191011.pkg -target /

  export PATH=/Library/TeX/Distributions/Programs/texbin:$PATH

  sudo tlmgr option repository
http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2019/tlnet-final
  sudo -i tlmgr update --self --all

  sudo tlmgr install [various collections]

and it is failing with the following error:

  tlmgr: setting default package repository to
http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2019/tlnet-final
  /Library/TeX/Distributions/Programs/texbin/tlmgr: unexpected return value
from verify_checksum: -5


I don't know if I'm doing something stupid when trying to point the TeX Live
that comes with MacTeX 2019 to the tlnet-final version of TeX Live 2019, or
if
something is actually wrong. Note that I do this for TeX Live 2018 and 2018
as
well, and there it works fine.


Best regards,
Erlend Graff

Erlend,

I have a possible explanation (but am too busy today to check this out). The date you list for mactex-basictex is October 11, 2019. That is long after we built the release 2019 packages. 

In 2019 at the Apple Developer Conference in June, Apple announced that install packages for Catalina would have to be notarized, and all binary applications inside would have to adopt a "hardened runtime." This requirement was not really enforced in Catalina until fairly recently and old legacy install packages work fine even today. But I didn't know that in June, so I started working on hardened runtimes and later in 2019 I released new test install packages which met the requirements. It looks like you mixed one of these later test releases with tlnet-final.

The 2020 MacTeX releases are all notarized and Apple is enforcing the requirement for these recent packages.

That is a bug dealing with expired keys, see
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-April/045306.html
(and the following thread). There are more details in the thread
starting here
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-February/044766.html
where this problem occurred the first time with contrib.texlive.info.


Basically you need to upgrade first with 
	update-tlmgr-latest.sh
(no other options please!) and after that the tlmgr will work.

Other than this, all you do looks fine. This is a peculiarity due to the
expired key.

Hi Norbert,

Thank you, that worked perfectly! Now every build on my CI is green :-)
Looks like I accidentally only sent my previous replies to you, instead of
reply-all with the tex-live list in CC. I've added it back to CC now for
this reply, at least ;-)


Best regards,
Erlend

Hello,

As explained here (https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action/issues/32), we find out that TeXLive does not offer xindy binaries for Linux musl environment (the missing package is thus xindy.x86_64-linuxmusl).

Can you fix it ?

Thanks for the help

Hi

Building xindy is tricky and have work, and obviously nice of the musl builders did care for it.

We usually use the Travis builds, but they don't contain xindy since it needs more work.

If you want to see xindy for musl, can you provide one yourself by building one and sharing it with us?

Best

Norbert

Linux musl.  

I have a VM running Void Linux on x86_64 with Clisp installed.
I'm about to try a TeX Live build for that platform.  More

Dear Nelson

No need to do the full TL build, xindy needs to be have compiled independent from the rest of TL. If you have already clisp that helps a lot!

Thanks

For the record: after todays update the problem seem to be resolved. 

I can handle file with Umlauts (gr??e.tex), chinese (??-input.tex)
and ducks (??.tex) on my windows without problems. Fonts with
non-ascii in the name works now too.

I thank Akira for the work!

Building all format with tlmgr/tlshell gives the following error:

Der Prozedureinsprungpunkt "fu8open " wurde in der DLL

Subject: New binaries for Alpine Linux MUSL
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1589210911.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

In offline exchanges with John Y <john_5555_ at outlook.com>, we made
experiments over the weekend with using Void Linux MUSL binaries on
Alpine Linux MUSL.  That failed because of differing shared library
versioning.

With some work, documented at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2020/README.html#alpine

I'm pleased to announce a new set of binaries, including xindy and
Asymptote, for Alpine Linux and other systems that use MUSL instead of
GNU glibc.

The build was done with a recent (post-ISO) TeX Live source tree, so
TeX reports a version "2021/dev".  If that is a problem for anyone,
then I can likely redo the build with a source tree snapshot taken at
the time of the ISO release.

The Alpine binaries are for x86_64.  Four other architectures,
including x86, are supported by Alpine, but I have not built VMs for
any of them.  An x86 build would likely be straightforward, but I
don't plan to do so unless there is a need for it; x86 is pretty much
history, and Intel's CPU designs have largely focused on x86_64 since
2003 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#x86-64).

Similar here. I see these three errors in the log:

Backup files were created, but they are 0 bytes. Luckily, I could
reinstall these packages from a mirror that was still in yesterday's
state.

Looks like the update of the day before, because today's revison numbers
of these packages are 55114.

Upon thinking about this for a while I believe that this is due to my
gaucheness. I activated autobackup after the failed downloads. So in my
second attempt to update there was nothing to backup.

Ah well, I can take no responsibility for the up-to-datedness or otherwise of the mirrors !? Today I get an error :

Hi, I use to run latex using 2018 version in a mac OS X  10.10.3 for a long
time, no problem. Somehow I decided to update to 2020 version and
everything seems OK but biber. References don't compile and the
bibliography is not constructed. Apparently there is a compatibility issue.
Is there a fix?
Thanks anyway

I am using texlive 2020 and am unable to compile simple latex files

You are using local, completly outdated files:

(/home/richard/texmf/tex/latex/aguplus/GRAPHICX.STY
Package: graphicx 1996/10/31 v1.0c Enhanced LaTeX Graphics
(DPC,SPQR)

(/home/richard/texmf/tex/latex/aguplus/KEYVAL.STY
Package: keyval 1995/09/21 v1.09 key=value parser (DPC)
)
(/home/richard/texmf/tex/latex/aguplus/GRAPHICS.STY
Package: graphics 1996/10/31 v1.0c Standard LaTeX Graphics
(DPC,SPQR)

my graphicx.sty has the version:

graphicx 2019/11/30 v1.2a Enhanced LaTeX Graphics (DPC,SPQR)

Ok, when last night's update makes it around there should be a symlink
bin/man.

Always before everything under bin/ has been a platform name. I changed
the places I found in our code that were assuming that, but there may be
more, or in other people's code or procedures. If more problems are
reported, may have to rethink. --thanks, karl.

You might also want to check your eps file. I get an "Invalid image
specification" error when attempting to open it with emacs.

No problem with frequent updates, Akira.

But could it be that the main repository got mixed up some how? tlmgr
advertises updates to 55114 as in

,----
| C:\>tlmgr update --list
| tlmgr.pl: package repository ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: gpg unavailable)

| update:   luatex.win32      [1780k]: local:    55073, source:    55114
`----

while in the repos (also at tug.org) in see only containers of 55073:

Hello,

I vave opened the EPS on my computer and everything is OK. The only
potential problem is with Pages: (atend). This is not recommended for
EPS but is correct. Some SW tools may dislike it. Okular displays it
without any warning.

Message-ID: <bae0d49b-cb16-8c90-9b1f-ad31d3014a7b@web.de>

Dear sir or madam,

I'm running TeXLive on Win10. The installation worked OK (had to run it
twice due to installing problems at the first time) a few days ago and
updated tlmgr and the packages every day since then. Today I got
problems with installing the three a.m. packages via command line (and
GUI as well):

[3/3, 00:02/00:02] auto-install: luatex.win32 (55114) [1780k] ...

TLPDB::_install_package: downloading did not succeed
(check_file_and_remove failed)
tlmgr.pl: couldn't install new package luatex.win32

Changing the repository did not help and now I don't know what to do.

Would you please be so kind to help me with that issue?

Thank you very much in advance.

Hello,
as Ulrike already pointed out, you are using a very outdated version of 
graphicx, sitting in $HOME/texmf. Maybe you put it there decades ago and 
had no problem with it all the years.
The best bet would be to rename your ~/texmf to something like 
~/texmf_FromthepreviousMillenium and try it again.

BTW, you are running pdflatex, while you want to include an eps-file. 
That should work, but an intermediate pdf graphics file will be created; 
better run epstopdf on the file.

Let us know, whether you could resolve the problem.
Good luck

EPS will be converted to PDF on the fly if \write18 is allowed and you
have not-too-old version of the graphicx package.

According to https://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html, bugs are sent to
public mailing list tex-live at tug.org with a link to
https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-live. However, I would suggest you
report it again to gmane.comp.tex.live, where I first saw your post, or
to tex-live at tug.org (the same thing).

Before you do so, I suggest you check everything again. For example, if
you're using xdvi, I know there are issues with the display of graphics
to do with a bug in a version of ghostscript (I can't remember which one).

As to texlive2019, I got mine over the Internet using install-tl-unx.tar.gz
from https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html. The download is
painless.

Best wishes,

I didn't understand this last part on a first reading, but when I tried again I decided that it must be a web site and tried to visit http://gmane.comp.tex.live/.? To my surprise, I received an "Address Not Found".? So what /is/ "gmane.comp.tex.live" ?

It's tex-live at tug.org. Sorry. "gmane.comp.tex.live" is the name of the
newsgroup where posts to tex-live at tug.org appear - it is not a url. I
should have made than clear.

Howdy,

Did you listen to Ulrike? The log file you provide shows that you are using a GRAPHICX.STY, etc.,from 1996 located in your personal tree rather than the one that's part of TeX Live 2020. REMOVE it.

Good Luck,

Message-ID: <MN2PR20MB2445CE06A7826BC7C4D04BD189BF0@MN2PR20MB2445.namprd20.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all

My name is Eduardo, I'm new in the mailing list, I have been using texlive for about a year for my Thesis, first I want to thank you all for the grate work!

I'm trying to replay to the thread about Problems with updating several texlive-packages (luatex.win32 luajittex.win32 luahbtex.win32) since yesterday I have the exact same problem when update the packages.
Luatex.win32, luajittex.win32 and luahbtex.win32 fail to install and actually this packages disappear form my installation.

I'm on Windows 10 (1909 OS build 18363.836)

Don't know if this help, but there was 3 updates of windows 10:

  1.  Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.8 (KB4552931)
  2.  Windows Malicius Software Remubla tool (KB890830)
  3.  Cumulative update for windows 10 (KB4556799)

I update Windows 10 before update muy Texlive, and this is where Luatex.win32, luajittex.win32 and luahbtex.win32 fail to install.

So I try a fresh install, uninstall and delete everything form TexLive also I disable my AV even run windows in safe mode but the fresh installation of texlive 2020 fail when reach de Luatex.win32, luajittex.win32 and luahbtex.win32 packages fail at the end it show this message for each package:

This is and example of  fail message form luahbtex.win32 From the installation.

Hello all -

Thanks for the bug reports about the lua*tex.win32 failing updates.
I've attempted to force an update of those packages, with a version
number that should be 55133 or higher. Hopefully this will solve the
immediate checksum problem.

Norbert and I are trying to discern the underlying problem. --thanks, karl.

As subject says I see no reason for this and it's also hard to uninstall after setup. People who want it can install it themselves. The rest of us should not be forced to have it installed.

It should be removed as a default package as it has no place in a standard install.

If it is installed as a part of a full TeX Live installation (as I would believe), then I see no problem with it being included whatsoever.? If it is being included as a part of a (say) minimal install, then I would agree.? Which is the case ?

> The rest of us should not be forced to have it installed.

I do not think that /anyone/ is being /forced/ to have it installed.? After all, no-one is /forcing/ you to install TeX Live in the first place.

> It should be removed as a default package as it has no place in a standard install.

How would you define a "standard install" ?? Does it consist only of the packages that you personally want, or does it include packages that might be of some use or interest to others ?

Dear anonymous,

quran is contained in the collection-langother. If you install this
collection, then you will get quran, as well as lot of other things.

If you don't want to have it install, either do NOT install the
collection-langother, or remove it with
	tlmgr remove --force quran

The default is an installation of all of TeX Live, and thus will also
contain the quran package.

> It should be removed as a default package as it has no place in a standard install.

Why? 
And if you write an answer to this question, we don't accept religious
explanations. TeX Live is about typesetting, and not religion.
If you have other concerns, like license issues, please let us know and
we will discuss.

Best

Norbert

The license is (if I look at the right place) LPPL 1.3, so there is
IMHO no licensing reason for removal.

Subject: xetex test creation for reading pdf images?
Message-ID: <202005141752.04EHqSXi006028@freefriends.org>

If anyone is interested in working on low-level XeTeX test cases: it
would be good to write test(s) for PDF image inclusion in XeTeX, that
would run when the binary is built. I.e., stuff for
Build/source/web2c/tests.

There's a file luaimage.tex in the sibling luatexdir/tests which could
serve as a starting point.

This comes up now because in the TL development sources, XeTeX now uses
the pplib library (originally by Pawel Jackowski) for reading PDF files.
Although LuaTeX has been using it for a couple of years, of course
testing in every context is desirable. (A new binary is already included
in Akira's W32TeX distribution, for anyone using that.)

In general, essentially everything in TL could use more test cases, if
by chance anyone gets interested in this unglamorous, woefully
neglected, but so-important work.

Thanks,
Karl

Just moving from miktex to texlive and used scheme-small. quran was not installed in basic miktex and think the same for a basic texlive. Same reason bible packages aren't installed in basic miktex.

What texlive scheme avoids installing quran.

scheme-small depends on collection-xetex
collection-xetex depends on quran

So you need to avoid collection-xetex.

But there are also German and Urdu translations
	quran-de
	quran-ur
so you also need to avoid them, and collection-langother

As said, I suggest either living with it, and if you can't (and no, I am
not interest in the why), then **remove** the packges
	tlmgr remove --force quran quran-de quran-ur
and be happy.

> What texlive scheme avoids installing quran.

scheme-basic
scheme-context
scheme-infraonly
scheme-minimal

Norbert appreciate the solution. Interesting need forced uninstall to remove it so Karl was wrong about a normal uninstall - find that really weird. 

Still dont understand why it is installed in anything but a full scheme - have very strong objections to it being installed on my computer but off topic.

Texlive is more stable because miktex is buggy recently hence the switch so thanks everyone.

> Norbert appreciate the solution. Interesting need forced uninstall to remove it so Karl was wrong about a normal uninstall - find that really weird. 

Because collection-xetex depends on it, so tlmgr refuses to uninstall a
package that is needed by a collection.

Using the --force this is overridden.

> Still dont understand why it is installed in anything but a full scheme - have very strong objections to it being installed on my computer but off topic.

Please give a **universal** criteria which package should not be
installed in a (medium/standard) setup? Onto which valuations do you
base your decision what should and what should not be installed.

Every user has different opinions on that, and yours is not more and not
less worth than anyone else's opinion.

Thanks

Norbert

Just a comment, personally I would not accept as a valuable reason
that it is not installed in MiKTeX as default. There are many other
packages available in TeX Live as default but not available in MiKTeX,
so why only quran and the other dozens of packages? If you really
insist in having only packages available in MiKTeX, you can join the
team and prepare collection-miktex.

Norbert - Why does collection-xetex depend on quran - makes no sense.

Issue is why quran installed except for full mode. Why not bible packages in collection-xetex. Dont need any reminder of horrific sept 11 either since live in USA.

Universal rule - dont install religious packages except for full mode - simple. So no bible no quran.

Zdenek - Didnt say must have same packages as miktex - choice up to texlive.

Some collections **has** to depend on quran. Let me know which is better
one! It is in -xetex because it requires xetex.

Because most bible packages don't need xetex.

What I fail to understand is why you think that what /you/ need has any relevance to what packages TeX Live should include. TeX Live is not just for you, it is for everyone.? If you don't like what it includes, don't install it.

And while you?re at it, also remove all Arabic numerals from your computer as well as any traces of algebra.

Not only algebra. You will have to take inspiration from Orwell's
newspeak (I hope you have read 1984). Word cipher is originally
Arabic. When Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi (there are several
transliterations of ?????????) translated the texts of Brahmagupta
from Sanskrit to Arabic (the language of Islam was Arabic although he
worked in the House of Wisdom in Tehran), he had to invent the name
for zero, which was ??nya (meaning empty) in Sanskrit, thus he used
sifr (???) which also means empty in Arabic. Arabic numbers were
forbidden by the government in mediaeval Italy because everything
Arabic was suspicious. However, Italian merchants found out that
calculation with Arabic numbers is easier, they continued to use it in
"secret writings", i.e. in ciphers. Word zero comes from Greek
zephiros (meaning empty) which comes from sifr. Thus you have to
remove anything related to secure communication (ssh, https, pgp
encryption and signatures) because it is Arabic. You must no longer
use algorithm of multiplication which was developed and explained by
al-Khwarizmi in Arabic. And you must not use algorithms at all,
because Italian merchants (when translating al-Khwarizmi's books from
Arabic to Latin) were not able to transliterate and pronounce the
name, the translator thus used al-Gorithmi which is the source of word
algorithm.

Issue was only why quran installed - not essential package for most people and why include in collection-xetex.

Why does some collection have to depend on a given package at all? From
the conceptual perspective I'd assum quran depends on -xetex not vice
versa.

Is this how TeX Live is organized, i.e. quran (or any other package) is
only included if one of the collections depends on it?

If so wouldn't it be useful to have a collection to pull in all non-
essential packages? Because (although I have zero interest in whether
quran is installed or not) I don't see why installing the -xetex
collection would pull in that package. quran is not necessary to use
XeTeX, isn't it?

If you only want the 'necessary', you install scheme-basic then add 
packages one-by-one. Using XeTeX only *requires* a small number of 
additional things, but then you are making lots of schemes that are 
more-or-less scheme-basic + a few things, and that's not really useful. 
(If you *really* want to minimise, you start with scheme-infra-only, 
which was added exactly for this purpose. But that's really only useful 
to people creating test systems.)

I had exactly the same conversation with myself while showering this morning.? And it seems to me that the answer is "because 'Collection XeTeX' is a /collection/".? In other words, if you install the /package/ 'quran', it will install XeTeX and other things on which it ('quran') depends; but if you install 'Collection XeTeX', then you will install XeTeX and all the packages that make use of XeTeX. /N'est-ce pas ?

Returning to technical discussion, quran can be used with XeTeX, with
LuaTeX, and with ArabTeX, hence its inclusion in collection-xetex is
really strange. IMHO collection-xetex should contain files for the
formats (plain XeTeX, XeLaTeX), polyglossia, fontspec and possibly a
few more packages needed generally for use with the XeTeX engine. Thus
quran should not even depend on XeTeX because it works with other
engines as well.

To go completely OT: I have published my study on utopias in nonfiction film last year ? typeset in LaTeX BTW (http://utopia2016.ch/zfs40/ ). So yes, I am aware of it.;)

*Every* package in TL has to be in one and only one collection, the
collections form a complete partition of the TL packages.

Over they years many many people came forth with "I can do better", but
nobody ever delivered.

Subject: updating texlive-scripts gives strange message
Message-ID: <e2c2c468-9b21-f9a0-ca22-958eef1734bb@yeah.net>

Hi there,

when updating TeXLive with tlmgr update --self --all, I noticed the 
following message that I have not seen before:

update: texlive-scripts [344k] (55117 -> 55126) ... tar: Unknown file 
type '2' for bin/man, extracted as normal file

What's the mean? Thanks!

Best,
Jinsong

This morning when i tried to see if updates to TeXLive 202 were available, in the TeX Live Utility (version 1.36) I got a ?Listing failed? error.

The repository is set as: http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet

I tried using the TLU menu item Actions > Reinstall TeXLive Manager but got error: ?The update failed?.

Same thing happened with repository http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet <http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet>

Feel free to. It?s available both as print as well as Open Access which can be downloaded for free on my website. I am currently preparing an English translation, but this will take some time (and won?t be typeset in LaTeX, unfortunately).

  ... and LuaTeX, which was originally developed to typeset texts of
medieval Islamic philosophic.  The project was called OrientalTeX, and
came with an initial grant of $30,000 that funded development time.
Islam literally gave us LuaTeX.

Message-ID: <9EA2C288-E7BD-49C7-B08A-8AB35AA68F6C@mackichan.com>

I deleted all the contents of texlive from my C: drive on Windows 2007. 
I created the C:\texlive\texmf-local directory and added a single file 
in new subdirectories, 
C:\texlive\texmf-local\tex\latex\TCItex\welcome.tex.

Then I did the default network install, and then ran texhash. I got this 
result:

Cannot open c:/texlive/texmf-local/ls-R to write.

texhash: Updating c:/texlive/2020/texmf-config/ls-R...

texhash: Updated c:/texlive/2020/texmf-config/ls-R.

texhash: Updating c:/texlive/2020/texmf-var/ls-R...

texhash: Updated c:/texlive/2020/texmf-var/ls-R.

texhash: Updating c:/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/ls-R...

texhash: Updated c:/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/ls-R.

texhash: Done.


The property dialogs for ls-R and ls-R.orig show that no user has any 
privileges on either file, but that the file owner can create them. This 
problem is fatal to our installation for Scientific Word and Scientific 
WorkPlace, and may force us to retreat the texlive 2019.

Can anyone help?

Are you sure ?? I am familiar with Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019, but Windows 2007 is a variant of which I have never heard.
Apart from that :? did you delete everything /including/ C:\texlive (not just contents but directories, sub-directories and so on) ?

If by "retreat the texlive 2019" you mean "revert to texlive 2019", that will not be the end of the world, but you /should/ be able to have both TeX Live 2019 & TeX Live 2020 installed concurrently.

Windows 2007? You mean Windows 7?

With an admin install on Windows 10 and Windows 7, both 64bit, I got
the intended permissions: read and execute for 'users' and
'authnticated users, and full permissions for administrators.

Maybe some funny permissions have been inherited from C:\ or from
C:\texlive?

What is the output of:

icacls C:\texlive

icacls C:\texlive\2020\texmf-dist

icacls C:\texlive\texmf-local

A couple of years ago a different person asked on the MacTeX list why the Koran was in MacTeX. Here's the answer I gave. 

In most countries, there is a connection between the religion of the country and its culture, so people interested in typesetting will find themselves consulting religious documents. To take a famous example, H?n Th? Th?nh wrote his thesis on character protrusion and font expansion as used in the Gutenberg bible, and on adding these features to pdfTeX. 

Arabic, I am told, is the only script which has only a cursive form. This makes it difficult to typeset. The first Arabic typesetting was done for newspapers, and was apparently rather crude. The golden standard for Arabic script is the Koran, so it is natural that TeX experts wanting to create really beautiful Arabic typesetting used it as a model. That is why the document is in TeX Live.

Thanks to Arthur Reutenauer for calling this connection to everyone's attention.

To whom it may concern:

Below the line is a error message from the terminal when attempting to update Texlive 2020 this morning.  This has been a continuing error for an hour or so.

Appears to be some kind of crypto-signature problem.

Hello all,

?Weird but true! In the latest version of xepersian (v22.9) if
?one uses the package option fontsloadable=true, he will get the following
?warning message:

?"Package xepersian Warning: The option `fontsloadable' should only be used in
? exceptional cases. You are not allowed to use the option `fontsloadable'
? unless you have a written permission from the primary author of the
? xepersian package."

?Does anybody have such an experience with another package in TeXLive.
?Can the author of a package with an "LPPL version 1.3c or higher" make such
?a request to use an option?

mwe:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[fontsloadable=true]{xepersian}
\settextfont{Amiri}
\begin{document}
? ? ? ? ?
\end{document}

best

I tried a couple of mirrors, waited around, etc.  Turning off 
verification ala

--verify-repo=none

seems to work, but we know that's bad.

BTW, thanks for the wonderful TeX packaging!

That is why the document is in TeX Live.

Message-ID: <CAOtYn2AXapuP0jGVRf1_r+0M3QHoUYyyDuMWgyXXYNNL63zR=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having issues installing texlive.  On two different systems, I've been
getting a signature verification error.  I tried a few hours ago and got
this error, and I've been trying again occasionally since then and it still
happens.

I'm copying the full error messages below.  As you can see, I'm using two
different mirrors.

In both cases I'm setting up a docker container.  I've used the exact same
command before in docker and it's never given me any trouble.

Please let me know if there's anything I need to change to fix this.

Thank you,
Heshy

This is the message I get on our jenkins server:

Hi
I was trying to do a vanilla installation of Latex following the
instructions on this website.
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1092/how-to-install-vanilla-texlive-on-debian-or-ubuntu/95373#95373

But while installing I got the following error message, I tried multiple
times over the past few hours. But it still gave the same error with
different mirrors used. Hoping you can help fix the issue.

This renders the package nonfree, and thus I have removed xepersian from

I'm guessing you are updating on Windows (filesystem or machine).
Indeed, bin/man is a new symbolic link which will result in this error.
Fortunately it is harmless (just results in an empty file) and you can
ignore it until we figure out the best fix. Thanks for the report. --karl

I don't know why you mention 9/11.  Shall we make millions of muslims
whose only desire is to live in peace, also with their neighbours,
responsible for what a handful of braindead terrorists did?

Please understand that TeX Live cannot and will not take your blatant
racism into account.

    why the Koran was in MacTeX. Here's the answer I gave. 

Nice historical information. However, the real answer is, "for any
package X, if it is uploaded to CTAN and under a free software license,
by default we will include it in TL".  The contents of the package are,
at first blush, immaterial. I will not make value judgements about what
is or isn't "worthy" of being in TL.

If legal or other issues (filename conflicts, etc.) are discovered at
the time or down the road, or the author requests removal, that's
fine, we remove packages frequently.

Subject: xetex test creation for reading pdf images?
Message-ID: <FE7B30B5-3F4C-4F3E-A9C6-1ACC585931C2@icloud.com>

Here's a (very quickly) hacked adaptation of luaimage.tex to xetex. I commented out the format creation section at the beginning to test on my setup, after downloading

Build/source/texk/web2c/luatexdir/tests/luaimage.tex

Build/source/texk/web2c/tests/1-4.jpg
Build/source/texk/web2c/tests/B.pdf
Build/source/texk/web2c/tests/lily-ledger-broken.png

Two forms of image inclusion commands are used:

- \XeTeXpicfile and \XeTeXpdffile which are the original XeTeX commands,

- \special{pdf:image and \special{pdf:epdf which are the (x)dvipdfm(x) specials,

based on XeTeX-notes.pdf, xetex-reference.pdf, dvipdfm.pdf and dvipdfmx.pdf.

There are some subtle differences between the two forms, not just their syntax but also the way they work. With the latter, specifying both the width and height in a way that alters the aspect ratio of the image does not seem to work: in this case, the image is nowhere to be seen.

That's odd, because I looked at the associated xetex.def and dvipdfmx.def from the graphics package for double-checking and inspiration, and there seems to be no trick to deal with this, it seems to be business as usual with \Gin at req@width and \Gin at req@height.

I won't be able to pursue the matter or maintain this file, it's just to get this thing started. (And I didn't attempt to modify the copyright at the beginning.)

Just to add: There is very recent v23.0 available on CTAN.

Moreover, there is a (very) long standing discussion on this package and
its strange "limitations" due to personal disputes between the author
and another person.

@Karl: If you want to know more, please ask the CTAN team.

Message-ID: <224ae16a-8577-9d02-466c-c626c6081df4@gmail.com>

Dear Folks,

I have just installed TeXlive 2020 on Linux without any errors.

I tried

tlmgr --repository http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet 
update --self --all

and have been repeatedly getting the following error:

---
/home/chandra/extra/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr: signature

gpg: BAD signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>" 
[ultimate]

Please try from a different mirror and/or wait a few minutes
and try again; usually this is because of transient updates.
If problems persist, feel free to report to texlive at tug.org.
---

I am reporting as advised as the problem has persisted.

I am also unable to compile files on TeXLive 2020 that could be compiled 
without error on TeXLive 2019, and the errors are puzzling.

Before I post a question on TeX Stackexchange, I want to rule out a 
flaky TeXLive 2020 installation.

Thank you.

Chandra

I've been reminded once again by the recent report
(https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-May/045687.html) that we can't
have a symlink outside of the bin/* subdirectories, even in the bin/
directly ... It will get installed on Windows causing an error
message. Harmless, but not acceptable IMHO as normal behavior.

Attempting to somehow avoid the installation of bin/man on Windows,
e.g., through a tar exclude option or something, seems much too painful.

I'm back to believing we have to use bin/*/man if we want to support
that auto-finding feature of some man programs. Which seems reasonable,
so I've done that.

Johannes and any other packagers, I guess you'll have to go back to
excising the man link as a special case. Sorry. --best, karl.

I tried the same here and didn't get any error messages.  Admittedly
my local copy was already up-to-date but I suppose that GPG keys are
checked before anything is downloaded.

    Here's a (very quickly) hacked adaptation of luaimage.tex to xetex.

Thanks for your efforts, Bruno. If someone else wants to run with it,
that would be great.

I suspect it would be best to make it run under -ini, that is, define
catcodes of { and } and basic page parameters; not sure if anything else
is needed here. That usually eliminates one significant source of
(unrelated) error. I don't know why Peter chose to read in
plain aka "basic". --best, karl.

I want to compile Zathura (a document viewer) with SyncTex support on Mac,
but there seems to be no library files regarding SyncTex installed by
MacTex 2019, except a CLI client tool synctex. Any one knows about this?

  Well, it is getting hard to tell what you?re actually asking.  Since
you say that Urs understood your question, it seems to boil down to ?why
is the package quran included in collection-xetex??  And the reason for
that must be that it was felt to be XeTeX-specific (at least originally,
considering its location on CTAN: /macros/xetex/latex), and that
collections form in mathematical terms a partition of the set of
packages: every package must be in one collection and only one.

	Best,

No, sorry. We don't ship any libraries as such in TeX Live or
MacTeX. They are all compiled into the binaries. Distributing libraries
that could be linked with would be a quantum leap in difficulty of
distribution, and we're already pressed enough.

Does any pure viewer make use of synctex? I don't know. TeXShop does,
but it is an editor, so the "source line" concept makes more sense
there.

At any rate, about all that comes to mind is to extract the sources from
the TL tree and work with them in your own tree. Fortunately, they
hardly ever change nowadays, so you're not committing to a lot of
ongoing maintenance.  Unless the cmdline tool is enough, which I've
never used myself, but it seems unlikely :(. --happy hacking, karl.

Skim uses it, but it compiles the synctex source in the application.
Back when I actually used LaTeX, it worked well to sync with TextMate.

    Subject: Why is quran package installed by default on Texlive2020

Because every system-independent package included in TL is installed by
default (because the default is scheme-full), regardless of what
collection it's in, or anything else.

    why is the package quran included in collection-xetex?

That's a separate question, and the answer is: because when it was first
released, it only worked with XeTeX. As far as I can recall, anyway. As
Arthur says, I may have just taken the CTAN location as evidence.
Anyway, working (only) with xetex is the reason that I put any pkg in
c-xetex.

Now that I know quran works with LuaTeX also, I will move it to
c-langarabic soon, unless a better choice presents itself. --karl

Hi Zdenek,

    IMHO collection-xetex should contain files for the formats (plain
    XeTeX, XeLaTeX), polyglossia, fontspec and possibly a few more
    packages needed generally for use with the XeTeX engine.

Sorry, that doesn't work, because collections partition all the
packages, as has been said a couple times already. fontspec does not
work *only* with xetex, as you know.

So the general purpose of c-xetex (and c-luatex) is not to provide the
engine and "core packages", natural as that sounds. Rather, it is to
provide packages that work with only the given engine. So that if
someone does not have or want XeTeX, they don't have to end up with
XeTeX-only packages either. c-xetex includes both the engine and such
packages.

To add more complication, XeTeX and LuaTeX aren't parallel any more
(though they were for some years). LuaTeX, or rather TeXLua, has since
become an integral part of the system, so it has to be (and is) in
c-basic. On the other hand, people might not ever want to typeset with
luatex ("[pdf]tex is good enough for me"), so again, c-luatex is
intended to be packages that only work with luatex.

The {Xe,Lua}LaTeX formats add yet another layer of complication. I'm not
going to try to describe what I've done there. It's the best I can come
up with.

As has happened with quran, I'm sure some packages have gained support
for the other engine since they were first releases and thus are
misclassified now. I don't try to track that specifically (sometimes I
happen to notice), since it makes little difference in practice, but
just wait for user reports ... as you did here. --best, karl.

You might have a look at how others solve packaging of libsynctex as a
shared library:
https://packages.debian.org/buster/libsynctex2
https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/devel/tex-synctex/
https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/texlive-bin

Said Zathura (in poppler mode), as well as Evince, Okular, Sumatra,
Atril, QPDFview, which is arguably the majority of PDF viewers out
there (notable exceptions are xpdf and Adobe Reader). Any of them,
paired with one's synctex-aware editor of choice, makes a TeXShop-like
TeX IDE.

Cf. the ?Required by? field at 
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libsynctex/

On MacOS, it works very well with Emacs (Aquamacs, Emacs-Mac, etc.) too.

Yes, a few free viewers do.  One which comes to my mind is Sumatra PDF

Yes, that is easy within a distribution like Debian, but practically
impossible to do in TeX Live itself. Distributing shared libraries
across architectures and releases is only a pain.

I guess the best thing we **could** do is ship static libs (.a) for
libkpathsea and libsynctex, but then we probably need to do the same for
ptexenc, texlua libs, etc.

Not sure whether this would bring an improvement?

But yes, synctex is the most problematic since it changed (still
changes?) the format of the used files, so old projects using their own
embedded copy of synctex, which is the standard, will fail.

Best

Each time you reply to somebody you open a new thread which makes
following conversation really hard.

It would be really nice if you could reply to posts of others. Here is
some more information to get you going:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading

Or here is what Technopedia tells about threading:

"An email thread is an email message that includes a running list of all
the succeeding replies starting with the original email. The replies
are arranged visually near the original message, usually in
chronological order from the first reply to the most recent. This order
is useful for the readers following the conversation because it is
arranged in some hierarchical structure and may be arranged from top to
bottom or vice versa depending on the email client or email provider
used. Usually, the topmost email is the latest one."



Thank you very much.

I cannot help but feel that the TeX community is expending a great deal of energy attempt to justify something that is simple a /fait accompli/.? There is a far more important question facing the TeX community (which has nothing to do with religion, and nothing to do with Coronavirus / Covid-19) and that is the following :

  * Why is a mouse when it spins ?

If? "tel-2020--- via tex-live" can provide a satisfactory answer to that question, I for one will be more inclined to start worrying about whether package 'quran' should or should not form a part of TeX Live, and even more importantly, why there is no package 'tao-te-ching'.

At the end of all this, perhaps a better question would be "why not 
include ...?" - as far as I can see, the ability to typeset religious 
texts in a particular format is nothing more than a passive ability; it 
sets there, if you want to use it, but it doesn't affect anything if you 
don't. The only concern might be too much clutter in your filesystem, 
but considering the amount of other stuff I have lying around 'just 
because', it is hardly a major issue.

I think, although it hasn't been mentioned explicitly, that this is more 
about someone having a grudge against, in this case, Islam. A small 
century ago it was Judaism - haven't come far enough to lay this sort of 
prejudice to rest, finally?

Hi Paul - re trademarks and TeX Live, Donald Robertson at the FSF
reminded me that they did write guidelines about this issue wrt free
system distributions:
https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html#trademarks

The basic point being that trademarks in and of themselves are not a
problem -- yay. The problem would be if there is some kind of statement
in the (copyright) license saying that the trademarks must not be
removed, or otherwise forbidding redistribution, etc.

I don't think that's the case with the Masaryk packages, or
thesis/etc. packages in general, or fontawesome. Anyone modifying those
packages or logos can remove the trademarks (if they're doing something
different), or keep them (if they're making something relevant to the
university), according to the usual rules for trademarks. Which is,
don't make use of them to refer to something else.

In general, whether a given trademark is copyrightable or not is clearly
a massive gray area. If an organization asserts copyright on their logo
(unless they use a free software license for it, which I expect would
essentially never be the case), I'm certainly not going to argue about
that, and the packages would have to be removed. On the other hand, if
there is no explicit information, or the only information is that it's
not copyrightable, as you found at
    https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_Masaryk_University.svg
then that's fine, we can accept it until and unless a problem shows up.

I have updated https://tug.org/texlive/copying.html with a brief
statement along these lines.

Thanks for bringing this up. --best, karl.

Hi Karl and Community,

Thank you all for the comments. I finally got this hacked on *macOS* and
now everything seems to work fine.

Steps to build libsynctex.a:
1. Fetch the latest synctex source from https://github.com/jlaurens/synctex
2. Build.
    Method 1: The README tells how to build the client tool "synctex" with
a Xcode CLI project, we can easily adapt to a Xcode Library project
for libsynctex.a.
    Method 2: I wrote a Makefile
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sl_k56tijGDRRuPb1Epnhs49haBFCcPC/view?usp=sharing>
from
scratch, just make it.
    Note: a. -DSYNCTEX_WORK mentioned in README should be -D__SYNCTEX_WORK__
              b. make sure you have zlib
              c. In synctex_parser.c, change "/usr/include/zlib.h" to
"<zlib.h>"
                  # ifdef __SYNCTEX_WORK__
                  //# include "/usr/include/zlib.h"
                  # include <zlib.h>


And here are the steps to hack Zathura build script to link libsynctex.a
1. Follow the instructions of
https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/installation/ to build zathura and the
dependencies.
    Note: No synctex support by now. Check the zathura binary file,
             nm zathura | grep synctex | wc -l
             11
2. Put the synctex source folder in Zathura's source folder,
e.g. zathura-0.4.5/zathura/synctex.
3. Hack meson.build, to add synctex support.
    Insert the following two lines before "if synctex.found()"
*    build_dependencies += synctex*
*    defines += '-DWITH_SYNCTEX'*
    if synctex.found()
4. Remove and recreate "build" folder and redo "meson build"
5. Hack build/build.ninja, to link libsynctex.a.
    Edit L240, LINK_ARGS of the zathura target, add -L<path of
zathura-0.4.5>/zathura/synctex -lsynctex:
    e.g. LINK_ARGS = -Wl,-dead_strip_dylibs -Wl,-undefined,error
-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names libzathura.a *-L<path of
zathura-0.4.5>/zathura/synctex -lsynctex* ...
6. ninja & ninja install
    Now, zathura should contain synctex functions. Check again,
    nm zathura | grep synctex | wc -l
    523

Done.


TL;DR My original goal is to use Vim + vimtex plugin + a document viewer
with synctex support (https://github.com/lervag/vimtex), so I can get
instant view updates of the PDF alongside while I'm editing a tex script.
Skim (a PDF viewer on macOS) is great, fast and works out of box. However,
it is built around Apple's PDFKit which doesn't support recolor of the page
background. What I want is to change the viewer's bg color from white to
some dark color, especially the same as my Vim's(like this
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jWnNhRtA_6ajkRb9lA_cVcIVX0vLQAAE/view?usp=sharing>).
Zathura can make this happen, except that no pre-built package for macOS
and its source doesn't ship with synctex. That's why I need those
aforementioned hacks.

Subject: Suggestion: is it possible to use built-in perl.exe by default?
Message-ID: <CAMgPdi-GSgHXEPvnwZ+XNhLO9Zd_0m3kcT0CDKYEQGaYoLHWww@mail.gmail.com>

I encountered a weird problem and at last found it's related to perl.exe,
latexmk, and file path containing non-ASCII characters. The problem appears
on both TexLive 2019 and 2020. My OS is Windows 10 x64. Except the built-in
perl from TexLive, I have also a perl from cygwin installed.

When the perl.exe from cygwin is in %PATH%, latexmk.exe use this perl.exe
to call the script latexmk.pl. When there's no bibliography, the bibtex is
not used, everything works fine. However, when bibtex is used, latexmk
cannot provide the correct path of .bib file to bibtex because of the
non-ASCII character in path. It could be solved by removing the perl.exe
from cygwin. It could also be solved by using
"D:\texlive\2020\tlpkg\tlperl\bin\perl.exe
D:\texlive\2020\texmf-dist\scripts\latexmk\latexmk.pl" instead of calling
latexmk directly.

My prolbem has been solved, but I'm wondering is it possible to use
built-in perl.exe by default? This way, problems caused by wrong version of
perl.exe could be solved once for all.

I experienced the very opposite problem when trying to install TeX Live 2020 ? the installer used /my /"wget" in preference to one supplied as a part of the TeX Live installation suite, and the installation failed.? I therefore think that there is no one "best" solution ? whether to use pre-existing user/system-supplied executable images, or those that come as a part of TeX Live, and I can therefore only suggest that there be a configuration file under "texmf-dist" which defines the default behaviour for each and every executable image that comes as a part of TeX Live.? A user finding that this behaviour is sub-optimal for his/her system could then clone that configuration file to the corresponding location under "texmf-local" and change the behaviour (in the local copy) for those image(s) that believed to be causing problems.

This should only happen if TEXLIVE_WINDOWS_TRY_EXTERNAL_PERL is set
to 1 in D:\texlive\2020\texmf.cnf, at least, if you are talking
about a plain win32 TL installation. What is your searchpath?

Hi,

currently, the `pgf-pie` package:

  ?????
  ? https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf-pie
  ?????

is available only for MiKTeX, I guess because its license isn't
specified. But its development page:

  ?????
  ? https://code.google.com/archive/p/pgf-pie/
  ?????

mentioned in its documentation, stipulates a MIT License.

Since this license is considered as a free one at least on CTAN,
wouldn't it be possible for TeX Live to include this package?

All the best.

Yes, this is true. Thanks for letting us know. The problem is that the
author did not mention the license in any of the package files.

I have added MIT as license and also added a remark in the description
to say where the license is mentioned. Please take a look if this is
good enough.

As always, it may take an hour or two till the changes I made will be
visible on the web page.


Stay healthy!

Dear all,

The licensing situation of pgf-pie is pretty unclear.  I have asked the
author about 3 years ago to clarify it, but it seems that the package
has been abandoned.

    https://github.com/xuyuan/pgf-pie/issues/12

I haven't found anything about the MIT license anywhere, but the GitHub
repo contains a copy of the GPLv3

    https://github.com/xuyuan/pgf-pie/blob/master/dev/COPYING

However, this is not the version that is present on CTAN and because
CTAN has this (sorry to be frank) stupid policy that packages can only
every be updated with explicit permission from the original author, it
is impossible to fork and update pgf-pie.  So we are stuck in a
situation where no explicit license has been given (the license *has* to
be bundled with the sources, anything else is null and void) and unfixed
bugs keep piling up.

Kind regards,
Henri

There's no problem with the MIT license, but it has to be stated in some
file(s) in the package, not just on ancillary web pages.

    If it isn't sufficient for Karl, I'll try to reach the author to ask him
    to mention the license in one of the package's files.

That would be great. Let me know how it goes.

FYI ... I've found that when asking things like this, it helps to say
"If you're fine with the change but don't have time to make a new
release, I'll upload the new version to CTAN for you." Waiting around
for authors to make such changes is, in my experience, usually a waste
of time. --best, karl.

Hi Henri,

    CTAN has this (sorry to be frank) stupid policy that packages can only
    every be updated with explicit permission from the original author, 

As I understand it, the general policy is that for existing packages on
CTAN, only the author or designated uploader(s) can update it. And it's
not stupid, because previously some author(s) complained when "random"
third parties updated their packages out from under them. (It happened.)

But, there is an exception. With the LPPL, it is explicit: if an
original author is uncontactable for six months (plus other conditions,
but you get the idea), someone else can take over maintainership of the
package. CTAN will respect this sort of transfer. (It's happened.)

With all other free software licenses I know of, there is no explicit
transfer mechanism, anyone can release anything at any time. I would
argue (to CTAN :) that if the similar conditions as the LPPL are met,
it's reasonable to consider package XYZ as abandoned and thus to allow
someone else to take it over.

In the unlikely event that the original author (a) pops back up and (b)
has a problem with what has happened, it can always be reverted. My
experience that when work continues on an abandoned package, the
original author is pleased if he finds out about it down the road.

AFAIK, another option is to fork pgf-pie into a new package (why do you
say it is unforkable?), but that is a suboptimal outcome in my
view. There are far too many packages that are 95% the same as some
other package already.
    
    unfixed bugs keep piling up

If the maintainership can be resolved, do you want to take over pgf-pie?
Denis, do you? 

Have you either of you attempted to contact him recently?  I think
trying once more is indicated. ("If you don't reply, we will proceed
with updating per the GPL.") --thanks, karl.

Dear Karl,

I was able to contact Yuan Xu, the original author of pgf-pie, who is
also the author of pgf-umlcd and pgf-umlsd.  We agree that
maintainership will be handed over to the pgf-tikz GitHub organization,
which Yuan will be made a part of.  This will solve the maintainability
problem in the long run because there are several people with write
access that can release new version (David Carlisle, Joseph Wright, and
myself).  Also the licensing situation will be cleared up and the same
LPPLv1.3c + GPLv2 double licensing as for PGF will be put in place.

Cheers, Henri

Subject: Ghostscript transparency (again)
Message-ID: <B217BECA-2E6A-4EE2-B513-27E7919E66B7@icloud.com>

A few days ago, Chris Liddell posted a message to the gs-devel list

	https://ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-devel/2020-May/010295.html

making the change in Ghostscript's transparency support official: deprecation of the current operators (.setopacityalpha and .setshapealpha) and their replacement by new operators (.setfillconstantalpha and .setstrokeconstantalpha).

In this message he announces that there will backward-compatible support of the old operators in terms of the new operators for at least the next two releases (9.53 and 9.54).

He also invites affected developers to interact with him if need be.

Two affected packages are pstricks and PGF, I don't know whether there are others. Mojca Miklavec pointed out (on the MacTeX list) that Asymptote is affected too; I've added a comment to an issue "Transparency problem" (#155) on Asymptote's Git site.

Trying to summarize things up regarding this rather confusing matter: 

- First 9.27 (4 April 2019) changed the security restrictions of Ghostscript, so that the operators .setopacityalpha and .setshapealpha were considered unsafe and required -dNOSAFER. Made aware of the issue, Chris Liddell implemented -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY, which restores the two operators while keeping the other security restrictions into place. This was shortly after the release of 9.50 (15 October 2019).

- Then the last two releases, 9.51 (12 March 2020) and 9.52 (19 March 2020) have started reimplementing transparency, in such a way that .setopacityalpha and .setshapealpha no longer work. This was reported in Bugzilla, and resulted in a decision (in the current development code for 9.53) to deprecate these operators and replace them by .setfillconstantalpha and .setstrokeconstantalpha, which work a bit differently. The issue was at

	https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702219

the commit is at

	http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commit;h=d12d2085b5bd08ca1e813d97f3f7f7e630e791a0

and the documentation is getting updated to reflect the changes

Subject: Is there any xindy development still?
Message-ID: <1b370fdbe0b9ee632978e231730d223fcb5f87e3.camel@lyx.org>

Hi all

I have proposed a pull request for a long-standing bug in xindy half a
year ago via Joachim's github repository (
https://github.com/jschrod/xindy.ctan/pull/6) and I still have a couple
fixes in the pipe (including one for a bug I filed myself 16 years
ago). However, I did not get any response whatsoever, so I am wondering
whether and where xindy is being maintained. I am asking here as it
seems that the program in fact does get updates from time to time in
TeXLive.

So is there any place I could address my proposals to or is this
project simply dead?

Best
J?rgen

Hi J\"urgen,

    Subject: Is there any xindy development still?

Well, Joachim still pops up on email from time to time :). But he is not
on this list (afaik, and who can blame him), so cc-ing him. I'd say it's
evident that xindy is not his priority, true. I don't know 

BTW, I guess there is an xindy mailing list on sourceforge
(http://www.xindy.org/mailing-list.html)
but given my experiences with sf mailing lists, I'm not going to try to

Sounds fine. If you send me a plain text diff (sorry, github's interface
is too advanced for me to discern how to get that), I'll try to apply
it. (Unless Joachim pipes up to the contrary, of course.) --best, karl.

Effectively, there is no xindy development any more. xindy is in
maintenance mode. I review the patches on TL, checking if I have to
interfer because problems might pop up. No such interference was
necessary by now, all were OK.

The problem here is that there is no xindy upstream anymore, if there
was one ever. Even on my own workstation, I don't have any xindy build
that works besides the one from TL. For all practical purposes, TL is
nowadays xindy's upstream.[*]

The Github project xindy.ctan was setup on Peter's request that he
wanted to have an independent build as the start for xindy's TL
integration. If you look at this projects history, there was never any
development after the TL integration -- it was an intermediate step to
get xindy into TL.

Thus, I have two recommendations:
 -- If you get patches for xindy, accept them. As I wrote, I will look
    at them silently and will pop up if I see any problems.
 -- If J?rgen wants to be a xindy maintainer, there are no objections
    at all from my side. All reports, emails, and changes I received
    from him were very professional and well thought out. (My
    non-reaction was very unprofessional, I have to admit. Shame on
    me.)

Now, it's 01:45am and I have to go back to my work, want to get at
least some sleep later on...

Best wishes, stay healthy, practice physical distancing[**], may we
meet personally at better times. :-)

[*] This seems to be a good opportunity to document a dirty little
secret. When I started to take over maintenance from Roger, with the
aim of getting xindy into TL, I redefined what the "preferred form of
work" for this project is. xindy was orginally written in Noweb. Roger
left a CVS repository, where two completely independent
implementations are committed, without any documentation or notion
about these implementations and how they relate to each other. I took
the running source, created from noweb, and declared it as the
"preferred form". Lost was all the noweb source documentation that
Roger created, but owing to the two independent implementations, it
didn't have much value (at least, not at this time). This CVS
repository is preserved at Sourceforge, btw. If I would have wanted to
ever go back into xindy development, I would have tried to distangle
the two implementations, turn them into a proper git repository with
branches that show the development history, merge the TL
contributions, and try to find a way to integrate this noweb
implementation into the TL infrastructure. (I don't see any chance for
any such work of mine for the next 5 years, owing to my personal
circumstances; thus my recommendation to simply accept any patches
into TL, and accepting other maintainers for xindy.)

[**] Who has invented the term "social distancing"? It is the antipode
of what we want to do / should do. We need to be socially close, while
keeping our physical distance.

Hi,

I've uploaded haranoaji and haranoaji-extra version 20200524 to CTAN.
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/haranoaji
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/haranoaji-extra

However, TeXLive's haranoaji-extra has been updated,
but haranoaji doesn't seem to have been updated.

Any problems with haranoaji?

I am very sorry to hear that! I hope things turn to the better soon!

Of course, even in much more lucky circumstances, stopping maintenance
is completely fair. I hope you didn't take my message here as offense
(it was not my intention to point fingers on anybody).

I am happy to provide them (as plain diffs to this list). But the
should be reviewed since ...

... I know next to nothing of lisp. My patches were based on simple
attempts to understand how some xindy functions were written. I managed
to build it and test my patches. But I feel very far from having the
skills to maintain the project. Also, I have more than enough
obligations currently ;-)

Probably xindy should be rewritten in a language that is more common
(the usual suspects). But I understand nobody has the energy to take on
this task (me neither).

I start wondering whether index processing (after all, a simple locale-
based sorting task in essence) couldn't be done by re- or misusing the
advanced tools we already have nowadays (particularly biber). I might
try and make a suggestion to the biblatex folks ;-)

Now, it's 01:45am and I have to go back to my work, want to get at
least some sleep later on...

All best,

Thanks, Karl. Here you are (xindy-issue62.patch).

Here are two more patches I from my pipe:

* x3.patch documents a workaround wrt 
https://github.com/jschrod/xindy.ctan/issues/3 (not the issue itself)

* xindy-bug1.diff fixes https://sourceforge.net/p/xindy/bugs/1/ (a
separate patch documents the change)

Message-ID: <7wfv8reh1snt$.dlg@nililand.de>

When using \pdfgentounicode=1 without loading glyphtounicode.tex or
setting up some mapping with `\pdfglyphtounicode` one gets a warning

`pdfTeX warning: pdflatex-dev.exe: no GlyphToUnicode entry has been
inserted yet

and no cmap resource with ToUnicode entries in the pdf. That is what
I expected from the documentation.

Not quite expected was what happened when I added one nonsense
mapping:

\pdfglyphtounicode{xxxxx}{00B2}

In this case one get a cmap resources *and* this resources is
populated with lots of entries that pdftex seems to guess from the
font. 

Looking at texk/web2c/pdftexdir/tounicode.c I found that the rules
seem to be that 

 /* s is a multiple value of form "uniXXXX" */
 /* s matched an entry with numeric value in the
    database, or a value derived from "uXXXX" */

That is quite nice and means that for example the libertine math
font gets quite good tounicode values as it uses the uXXXX-syntax. 

Imho this should be better documented.

    Here you are (xindy-issue62.patch).
    Here are two more patches I from my pipe:

I think I've installed all those changes in the TL source tree, though
it's not unlikely I messed something up. Please check if you can.

As for the runtime, I installed the new faq-4.html, (generated) man
pages, and makeindex.xdy since I believe that does not require
recompilation (of xindy.mem).

The change to markup.lsp does mean rebuilding, as far as I can
see. Sadly,I'm not enthusiastic about asking all the builders to remake
a new xindy for this now. Maybe you can rebuild it for yourself?

Thanks for all. --best, karl.

Hi,

some scripts are failing here, as these search for SELFAUTOPARENT and 
get '/', e.g.

bbl2bib:    chomp(my $TLMaster = `kpsewhich -var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT`); 
# TL root

pedigree:    chomp(my $TLMaster = `kpsewhich

As SELFAUTOPARENT seems to be hardcoded, i tend to fix this by replacing 
SELFAUTOPARENT
with TEXMFROOT for these scripts.

Is there a better fix for redistributors? Would something break if 
upstream packages would
change to TEXMFROOT?

    }
}
This is **really** bad because it breaks as soon as these scripts are
not used within TeX Live proper, in particular if the scripts are in
directories without the arch component.

You could do
BEGIN {
    # find files relative to our installed location within TeX Live
    chomp(my $TMDIST = `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFDIST`); # texmf-dist tree
    if (length($TMDIST)) {
        unshift @INC, "$TMDIST/scripts/bibtexperllibs";
    }
}
This would work both in TeX Live as well as for distributors.

Thanks for your consideration.

Subject: documentation of  \pdfgentounicode
In-Reply-To: <7wfv8reh1snt$.dlg@nililand.de>
Message-ID: <202005292133.04TLX8oQ002181@freefriends.org>

     /* s is a multiple value of form "uniXXXX" */
     /* s matched an entry with numeric value in the
        database, or a value derived from "uXXXX" */
     Imho this should be better documented.

Does this look right?

+Once a single \type{\pdfglyphtounicode} definition is made, whether it
+is used or not, another feature comes into play: glyph names of the form
+\type{uniXXXX} or \type{uXXXX} are mapped to the natural \type{U+XXXX}.
+Many fonts use this style of naming.

However, I guess I don't really understand. When I look at the pdf
resulting from running your example document, I do not see character
<30> (hex; aka 48 decimal, aka the "a") being mapped to the expected
U+1D44E (math italic small a), which seems to be what the font says to
do. There are other mappings for unused characters (I can't quite
understand where they are coming from). And running pdftotext generates
no output.

    That is quite nice and means that for example the libertine math
    font gets quite good tounicode values as it uses the uXXXX-syntax. 

How did you discern that the mapping is actually working? --thanks, karl.

I believe if you use -var-value=TEXMFROOT, as Johannes suggested, it
will just work without needing to change anything. With native TL the
values will be the same.

$ kpsewhich -var-value SELFAUTOPARENT
/usr/local/texlive/2020
$ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFROOT
/usr/local/texlive/2020

    chomp(my $TMDIST = `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFDIST`); # texmf-dist tree

TEXMFDIST is fine too, of course.

I don't know what works with MiKTeX, but I guess if no one's reporting
any bugs, it doesn't matter. --best, karl.

Hello,

I wonder why Texinfo works at TeX Live on Linux, but Texinfo does not 
work at TeXLive on Windows.

Texinfo:
https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/

I specifically use the command line tool "texi2pdf" which is available 
on a Linux installation of TeX Live, but not on Windows.

Is there any option to use Texinfo with TeX Live on Windows ?

Best regards,
Werner

Hi all,

at least on my computer, texinfo as well as texi2pdf are parts of the
Linux distro, not the parts of TeX Live.

Dear Werner,

> not work at TeXLive on Windows.

In W32TeX, I'm distributing Texinfo, which supports
only typesetting of Texinfo files, that is, makeinfo etc. are
not supported.
It is rather special, and I don't want to include it in
the official TeX Live. In linux also, Texinfo is an another package.
If possible, I'll consider to match it to TeX Live, and will
distribute it as an addin, but I can't ensure it.

Best,
Akira

But you can just compile .texi files with tex and pdftex, if they
start with `\input texinfo'.

I think users can find tl-texinfo.zip at
CTAN/systems/win32/w32tex/TLTEXINFO a few days later.

A document:

        How to install Texinfo addin in TeX Live W32


In the following, $INSTALLDIR is $SELFAUTOPARENT in the TeX Live,
that is, the parent directory of "texmf-dist". Actually the
directory $INSTALLDIR is shown by a command:

    kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT


(1) Expand the file tl-texinfo.zip in $INSTALLDIR.
    Then you can typeset basic Texinfo files:
    texi2pdf --verbose filename.texi
    texi2dvi --verbose filename.texi
    dvips filename.dvi
    etc.
    makeinfo etc. in the original Texinfo are not supported.

(2) If you define an environment variable TEXINPUTS as
    set TEXINPUTS=$INSTALLDIR/texmf-texinfo/tex/texinfo;
    The latest Texinfo becomes available. For example, Japanese
    extension by M. Hosoda becomes available:
    set TEX=xetex& texi2dvi --verbose yatex-lx.texi
    in cmd.exe command line creates yatex-lx.pdf.
    An example file yatex-lx.texi is in texmf-texinfo/doc/texinfo.
    Note that, in defining the environment variable TEXINPUTS,
    you should input the actual value of $INSTALLDIR, for example,
    set TEXINPUTS=C:/texlive/2020/texmf-texinfo/tex/texinfo;
    and the trailing semicolon, ";" is absolutely necessary.

Best,
Akira

Hi,

in my TL20 installation, I only have the binaries xelatex-dev, 
uplatex-dev and platex-dev, but not the other ones (viz. pdf/lua/latex). 
Did I misconfigure anything, or have they been forgotten? And how can I 
add the missing ones?

(BTW: tlmgr.log is really cluttered and hard to read now that it also 
contains the output of format creation etc. Are you sure about that? 
After all, the log files will be copied to texmf-var anyway...)

Thanks and
best regards,

Dear Akira,
thank you for the instructions.  As you know I prefer a simple script
over lengthy explanations.  In this case even a script is not needed.

TeX Live cannot provide texinfo because Linux distributors want to
decouple texinfo from TeX Live for a good reason.

On Windows there are no such restrictions.  The best thing one can do
is to upload a texinfo package for Windows to CTAN which is activated
by TeX Live for Windows only.

It's certainly easier said than done because we have to make sure that
the said package is not found by kpathsea on Unix.  But I'm convinced
that this problem can be solved one way or another.


Regards,
  Reinhard

    Did I misconfigure anything

If you take the defaults, there is nothing in particular to "configure".
I surmise you did not install the full scheme.

    have they been forgotten? 

Well, "latex" etc. is in TL20, if that's what you mean :).

    And how can I add the missing ones?

tlmgr install latex-bin # for latex,pdflatex,lualatex
tlmgr install xetex     # for xelatex

That should be enough to make the formats, but other common
packages may be lacking, depending on what you installed.
Thus I recommend also:

tlmgr install collection-latex
and probably also
tlmgr install collection-latexrecommended

Those commands will install the formats too. Hope this helps. --best, karl.
