I tried the suggestions in the
 bug report: https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/issues/904

First I deleted the 2 keys:  
for "openDialogDir" and "recentFiles"
This did not solve the problem.

Then, I deleted
the Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TUG\TeXworks registry key.
This did not solve the problem.

I, too, have an i7 CPU and am running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.
My CPU has 2 physical cores.


I downloaded the latest 
TeXworks-win-0.7-202006210838

I ran it several times from a folder on my desktop.  It opens quickly in seconds.  It opens and edits several of my existing TeX documents including files on my external USB drive.  It behaves now just as TeXworks used to.  



Thanks for your suggestions,


Rick

Another user has needed help at comp.text.tex because
they installed texlive using apt and then tried to
manage it using tlmgr. Shouldn't tlmgr be disabled in a
distribution-installed texlive?

I haven't seen that, could you send me a link.

BUT, tlmgr does NOT work out of the box on Debian/Ubuntu. Without any
specific action from the user, it does nothing:

$ tlmgr update --list
(running on Debian, switching to user mode!)
TLPDB: Cannot determine type of tlpdb from /home/norbert/texmf!
tlmgr: running in usermode, did you call `tlmgr init-usertree'?
$

So a user needs to actively setting up user mode before it can work.

A user who does this without reading the manual about tlmgr user mode
is on their own.

Best

Norbert

This user *did*, as instructed, tlmgr init-usertree and was

Are you drunk out what are you talking about?

This is probably the most useless and most cryptic comment I have seen from you in the last n years (with n going to infinity).

Maybe you could try to wait a few seconds before sending of emails? It pays off reading and tubing to understand before typing ...

I think you misunderstood tlmgr's message: tlmgr does not try to ask the
user which arguments were passed, it already knows that in the current
invocation, init-usertree has not been used.
But tlmgr on Debian does require that "tlmgr init-usertree" is called at
some point, so it asks if the user did that, if s/he did call
"tlmgr init-usertree" at some undefined point in the past.

I think in this situation, where the problem seems to be that at least
one person (probably many more) just ran the given command without thinking
too much about it, would suggest to move into a different direction and
not to provide any direct command people can run. Maybe;
 
     TLPDB: Cannot determine type of tlpdb from /home/name/texmf!
     tlmgr: running in usermode; please read the manual at https://url-to-the-appropriate-manual for instruction to initialize your usertree.

>> did you call `tlmgr init-usertree'?

would be more appropriately worded

have you called `tlmgr init-usertree' prior to this command?

I have already changes staged here since a month, but haven't done an
upload to Debian recently. And even after that, the current wording will
not change in the stuff shipped in Ubuntu's old version, only in the
next release.

TeX Live does not provide lua.dll.
TeX Live provides lua53.dll which is in
luatex.win32.r55431.tar.xz.

Hi all,

In the distributed texmf-dist, pdftexconfig.tex is in
texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/ :

  % ls tl2020src/Master/texmf-dist/tex/generic/*/pdftexconfig.tex
  tl2020src/Master/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex

but in Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPaper.pm I see:

  "pdftex"   => {
    sub => \&paper_pdftex,
    default_component => "tex/generic/config",
    default_file      => "pdftexconfig.tex",
    pkg => "pdftex",
  },

Subject: tlmgr -- no updates message inconsistency
Message-ID: <rgfl1o$eet$1@ciao.gmane.io>

Hi,

if I run (when no updates are available)

$ tlmgr update --all

I get
----
tlmgr: package repository ...
tlmgr: saving backups to ...
tlmgr: no updates available
----

Likewise,

$ tlmgr update --self

yields
----
tlmgr: package repository ...
tlmgr: saving backups to ...
tlmgr: no self-updates for tlmgr available.

So far so good. However,

$ tlmgr update --all --self
or
$ tlmgr update --self --all

will only yield:
----
tlmgr: package repository ...
tlmgr: saving backups to ...
----

(note that there's no third line).

Subject: CTAN Italian mirror error
Message-ID: <BDE8AD1F-FAEF-414F-865E-A2A9BD8D1B64@gmail.com>

From a couple of days when I try to update the packages with the TeX Live Utility I get the message: Listing Failed.
The Repository's URL points to

http://ctan.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet <http://ctan.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet>

however the GARR mirror is

http://ctan.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet <http://ctan.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet>

The maintainers should be contacted to correct the typing error.

Best regards.

I contacted the CTAN team about this yesterday, and the
link has been fixed in the database. Apparently GARR changed 
the path to lowercase 2-3 days ago (and hopefully they leave
it alone now).

TeX Live Utility won't get this change until I release a
new version, but you should be able to set the URL manually.

thanks,
Adam

M$ used to think Linux was a virus (maybe they still do), so it is
quite possible that they also feel any competitor to M$-word is also a

I'd say all *.bat and *.cmd files are categorized as potentially harmful on

Well, they are less harmful than .exe files because you can determine
what they do before you execute them.  But some people have curious
opinions.  Adobe considers .zip, .tar.gz,... files attached to PDF
files as harmful and their software refuses to extract them.

My solution was to attach .zip files to a Perl script which does the
extraction when being executed.  So I attach Perl scripts to PDF files.
Adobe obviously considers Perl scripts harmless and happily allows
users to extract them.

But coming back to Phil's original message.  It's a well known matter
of fact that many virus scanners occasionally report false positives.
For a couple of years we got much less reports than 10 or 15 years
ago.  Maybe the scanners became better, probably due to feedback from
users.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Amir,

You reached the mailing list of the **original** TeX Live, but you are
using the repackaged version of Void Linux.

Not many people will be able to help you here, please direct your
questions to the Void Linux maintainers.

I have no idea what xbps-* is doing, fmtutil errors are mostly induced
by incorrect packaging.

Again, Void Linux should not ship tlmgr, if you want to use tlmgr,
please install the original TeX Live from TUG (tug.org/texlive).

No, you cannot install TeXLive::TLConfig via CPAN, we don't distribute

I think so.  Does the message disappear if you install texlive-xetex?

Hi,

to be exact I'm not able to read Czech nor Slovak text at all, nevertheless
due to the fact that GNU Emacs 27.1 does not have prepared pdf refcards
anymore I've tried to do it on my own. But stumble over e.g. differences in the
output ... that is e.g. from cs-dired-ref.tex with

   IN -- \section{Spu?t?n? a ukon?en? Dired}

but

   OUT -- Sputn? a ukonen? Dired

that is the UTF-8 (multibyte) characters ? and ? are missed in the
resulting pdf file (and many more!)

abuild at noether:~/rpmbuild/BUILD/emacs-27.1/etc/refcards> pdfcsplain cs-dired-ref.tex
This is LuaTeX, Version 1.12.0 (TeX Live 2020/TeX Live for SUSE Linux)

It should be noted that I had to replace the font csmi8 with cmmi8 as there is
no csmi8 at all.

Also the log cs-dired-ref.log is flooded with

Missing character: There is no ? (U+010D) in font csbx10!

What I'm doing wrong here ... I would suspect that pdfcsplain would do
the job at its own, wouldn't?

In the build environment I have installed

 texlive-collection-latex

 texlive-collection-basic
 texlive-collection-langpolish
 texlive-texlive-cz
 texlive-lshort-czech
 texlive-hyphen-czech
 texlive-babel-czech

beside some fonts like texlive-cs

Why is pdfcsplain calling luatex for you? It doesn't happen on my
texlive, (and it the reason why the chars are missing).

That is a good question ... with TeXLive 2020 I see

 tar Oxf texlive-2020-texmf/archive/kpathsea.tar.xz texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf | less +/csplain

 # from csplain:
 csplain pdftex - -etex -enc csplain-utf8.ini
 luacsplain luatex - -etex csplain.ini
 pdfcsplain luatex - -etex csplain.ini
 pdfcsplain pdftex - -etex -enc csplain-utf8.ini
 pdfcsplain xetex - -etex csplain.ini
 [...]

... there are three lines for pdfcsplain and it looks like
the first one wins on my systems here around including the
clean chroot build environment.

csplain has five commands:

(1) csplain
(2) pdfcsplain

(3) luacsplain
(4) luatex -fmt=pdfcsplain

(5) xetex -fmt=pdfcsplain

(1) and (2) are probably equivalent and use pdftex.
(3) and (4) are probably equivalent and use luatex.
(5) use xetex.

Akira

Off-topic, but ... why would one want to use "csplain" in 2020?
(As opposed to some OpenType font and either LuaTeX or XeTeX? Or maybe
pdfTeX with UTF-8 input and maybe Latin Modern in either T1 or IL2
encoding in case that's the typeface of your choice.)

I have the three lines too, and I have three pdfcsplain.fmt files in
the web2c pdftex/luatex/xetex folders, but the binary pdfcsplain.exe
clearly calls (on windows)

pdftex --fmt=pdfcsplain and not luatex

I get luatex only if I use luacsplain.exe.

This looks as if your tex system from SUSE created the wrong
mappers.

the same for texlive on macOS:

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020)

That was a false.
(1) gives dvi and (2) gives pdf.

Here, for
Spu?t?n? a ukon?en? Dired,
(1) and (2) give
Spu?t?n? a ukon?en? Dired
(3),(4),(5) give
Sputn? a ukonen? Dired

Situation with csplain is quite complex and you should ask Petr Ol??k
why it is needed. Anyway, if you want to prepare a multilingual
document or a manual which has to be available in many languages, then
csplain for Czech/Slovak and any other format for the remaining
languages present unnecessary complexity. I would leave csplain for
those who know why they need it for their work and use LuaTeX or XeTeX
with polyglossia especially for manuals and such.

+10000000 strongly supported. cs* binaries are from a different (stone?)
age and not really necessary on newer systems.

(That said, I am not sure we need to keep cs* forever in TeX Live if it
only creates problems for us and users)

The Emacs reference cards are quite old an I don't know whether they
are still actively maintained.

Even if newer Unicode-based engines/fonts/formats are a better way 
forward for the vast majority of users, the long-established cs* formats 
probably need to be kept around in order to support existing documents 
that depend on them.

Whether this requires keeping the corresponding binaries -- which are 
essentially shortcuts for an engine+format that could be called 
explicitly -- may be less clear, but there could easily be workflows 
that rely on calling [pdf]csplain or [pdf]cslatex as a binary and would 
have to be updated if it were removed.

On the other hand, I'd guess that use of cs* formats with luatex or 
xetex engines may be vanishingly rare.

AFAIK cslatex has never been officially released for xetex and luatex.
Several years ago cslatex was declared obsolete and unmaintained.
However, the old documents cannot be easily compiled with nowaday's
latex. In addition, CSTeX, which is currenlty mostly csplain, contains
Czech and Slovak hyphenation patterns that are used in all engines and
all formats. Use of cslatex for new documents is discouraged but
csplain is still actively maintained by Petr Ol??k and used by many
users with all engines.

Dear Werner,

These lines are the same as the ones in the TeX Live 2020.
However there are lines
...
        if echo "$src" | grep '/pdfcsplain$' >/dev/null; then
          # at p.olsak insistence: we have three pdfcsplain entries in
          # fmtutil.cnf with different engines, but the executable link
          # must point to pdftex.
          verbose_echo "forcing pdfcsplain destination to be pdftex"
          dest=pdftex$exeext
        fi
        verbose_do ln -s "$dest" "$src"
...
in texlinks.sh in the TeX Live 2020, thus the executable pdfcsplain is
linked to pdftex. So you are using a different build environment
than the standard TeX Live 2020.

Best,
Akira

Indeed, yes the full TeXLive source are build if possible with the system
libraries for each distribution.  And meanwhile I've found also this in
texlinks.sh and integrated this into the rpm spec file.

Thanks for spotting!

Yes, I know about it. If you want to use csplain with xetex or luatex,
you have to specify the engine on the command line. I do not remember
the correct syntax, I would have to look into my e-mail archive or
into documentation written in Czech by Petr Ol??k. His motivation is
that if t creates PDF directly, the name of te format must be pdftex
no matter which engine is used...

Subject: Proposal for texsrc command
Message-ID: <CAM_DS2maQA4_doNe1u-aiezzOcThDUXWY-J+vBbKCP0ats70ww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello friends,

I am Niranjan. I wanted to propose a command named texsrc for seeing the
source code of a package. Currently TeXLive provides the texdoc command
which opens the documentation of any desired package, but there is no such
command for opening the source (.sty) file which is strange.

I am a Linux user and I have TL2020, therefore I have made a shell script
in my /usr/bin/. It works for me (but only till I retain TL2020) and opens
the source text of the desired package. The code is this -

#!/bin/sh
xdg-open /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/$@/$@.sty

This is a very minimal script. It needs to be refined as per the
distribution year, os and path. I am no expert in shell to satisfy these
requirements, but is it possible to build such a command?

Regards,
Niranjan

No script needed:

vim `kpsewhich something.sty`

or replace "vim" with whatever editor you like, or you can just use
"more" or "cat", if you are afraid of modifying the package by
mistake.

This is a feature of TeXLive and unix-like systems, hence it works
even on Mac. MiKTeX has a different command instead of kpsewhich.
Windows with cygwin or with GNU utilities can do the same (I hope).

TeX Catalogue data updates. We are now (since we switched to versioned
containers) doing updates to the revision numbers also when "metadata"
is updated.

Not really. You are assuming that
	package name == style file name for LaTeX
Unfortunately this breaks for a large set of packages.

Example where it works:

package 12many
	file .../texmf-dist/tex/latex/12many/12many.sty

example where it does not work:
package IEEEconf
	file .../texmf-dist/tex/latex/IEEEconf/IEEEconf.cls
(because it ships a class file and not a style file)

another example
package adfsymbols
	file .../texmf-dist/tex/latex/adfsymbols/adfarrows.sty
(style file is named different from package name)

And there are many many more differences. So there is no easy way to
find **THE** source file.

You can use 
	tlmgr info --list <PACKAGENAME>
to get the list of files included, and check which are in "run files".

I guess this is the best one can do?

Best

Norbert

I would think that for LaTeX packages the best choice for source is
the commented dtx file.  So I'd like texsrc to return

texsrc 12many
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/source/latex/12many/12many.dtx

texsrc IEEEconf
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/source/latex/IEEEconf/IEEEconf.dtx

Only if the file is absent, we need to use .sty or .cls, as for
adfarrows.sty.

I think the algorithm for searching sources is complex enough to make
a texsrc command implementing it useful.

If there is a dtx file, it is better to use ltxdoc to generate a
pretty printed document with table of contents, index etc. However, it
is often available in the documentation.

    I would think that for LaTeX packages the best choice for source is
    the commented dtx file.  

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. For myself, there have been plenty of times
when I just want to see the actual code that's getting executed, not the
"commented" version with all the extra dtx stuff.

    I think the algorithm for searching sources is complex enough to make
    a texsrc command implementing it useful.

It seems to me that the most reasonable implementation would be as an
option to texdoc. docfiles and srcfiles are completely analogous in
texlive.tlpdb. All the same searches, fallbacks, special cases, have to
happen, etc.

Thus I suggest submitting it as a request at
https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/issues.

For myself, I tend to just look at the package's files and view the one
I want. --best, karl.

For people interested in testing the new implementation of transparency in the next version of Ghostscript (9.53), and interacting with the developers before release if need be: the first release candidate of GhostPDL 9.53 (of which Ghostscript is a component) has been released a few hours ago.

Last time (i.e. for version 9.51, since version 9.52 was a maintenance release one week after 9.51), there was exactly one month between the first release candidate and the release version.

Subject: [BUG] mktextfm requires writable cache
Message-ID: <20200820221657.jvyc4sfmgsi7vbjx@vento15post8>

Dear list,

If the TeX Live cache is not writable, it is impossible to generate
fonts.  A non-writable cache is common in sandboxed or otherwise
restricted environments, like a CI service.  The key point here is that
the generation fails, even if an absolute path is specified:

    [homeless at arch tmp]$ mktextfm --destdir /tmp lhr10
    mktextfm: Running mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10
    This is METAFONT, Version 2.7182818 (TeX Live 2020) (preloaded base=mf)
    
    
    kpathsea: Running mktexmf lhr10
    mkdir: cannot create directory '././home/homeless': Permission denied
    ! I can't find file `lhr10'.
    <*> ...=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10
                                                      
    Please type another input file name
    ! Emergency stop.
    <*> ...=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10
                                                      
    Transcript written on mfput.log.
    grep: lhr10.log: No such file or directory
    mktextfm: `mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10' failed to make lhr10.tfm.

This strikes me as rather odd, because I would have expected that the
--destdir option is designed to work around exactly that situation.  To
reproduce, make sure that your TeX Live installation is not writable and
run mktextfm as a user that doesn't have a home directory.

Cheers,
Henri

Yo need to set TEXMFCACHE which should give about two options where
files might be saved. If both are not writable, then please provide a
writable space. If all of that fails, /tmp/texfonts will be used.

No, --destdir is for the destination where the tfm file will be saved,
not where temporary files are created.

ACtually you need to do
	mkdir /tmp/texfonts
	chmod 0000 /tmp/texfonts
	env TEXMFVAR=/some/foobar/dir mktextfm --distdir /tmp lhr10
Then you should get something like

[~] env TEXMFVAR=/some/foobar/dir mktextfm --destdir /tmp lhr10
mkdir: cannot create directory ?././some?: Permission denied
mktextfm: Running mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10
This is METAFONT, Version 2.7182818 (TeX Live 2020/Debian) (preloaded base=mf)


kpathsea: Running mktexmf lhr10
mkdir: cannot create directory ?././some?: Permission denied
mkdir: cannot create directory ?././tmp/texfonts/source?: Permission denied
! I can't find file `lhr10'.
<*> ...=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10

Please type another input file name
! Emergency stop.
<*> ...=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10

Transcript written on mfput.log.
grep: lhr10.log: No such file or directory
mktextfm: `mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; ; nonstopmode; input lhr10' failed to make lhr10.tfm.



But I really don't see the point. It is common that programs write to
some directory, and in CI settings, or debbuilders, one needs to provide
the space. Just set TEXMFCACHE variable correctly and it will work.

Best

Norbert

Thank you everyone for your help. Would it be possible for me to change my
username for installation and change it back afterwards? Would it break
anything for currently installed programs? It seems as though it would be a
simple fix to allow for usernames with spaces as you just put the quotes in
and it works fine. Also very strange that Philip Taylor had no issues. Now
that I look back at the error, it seems as though the batch file attempted
to put quotes in to accommodate usernames with spaces but somehow inserted
two at the beginning and none at the end. In any case, I'll just use
Microsoft Word for now instead. I won't be able to use the templates for my
computer science course but at least there's no hacky fixes involved.

Forwarding to texlive list.

Although quoting rules for cmd.exe are horrible, and I am not sure
whether all quoting problems with cmd.exe can be solved, a space in
the installation path should not cause problems, as Philip Taylor
writes.

What exact error message do you get, and what exact path do you try
to install to? I mean the real path, as listed by cmd.exe or
powershell, which may differ from the path shown in file explorer.

To whom it may concern,
? Hello. I was trying to update a version of TEX LIVE? installed many years ago that I faced a problem.I can not figure out what the problem is , since it is fairly sophisticated. I am hoping to get your kindly advice on how to solve this problem. There is a zip file attached to this email which illustrates the message. Actually, can I ask you what should I do to be able to use the format of REVTEX 4.2c??? Is it just sufficient to unzip the zipped file in texmf-local folder of the updated TEX LIVE?I would really appreciate it if you could inform me.Thank you in advance.
Sincerely Yours,R. Rezayi

According to the image you sent, you have TeXLive 2015. You can't update 
that any more: TeXLive distributions are ?frozen? when a new one is 
released every year. I would advise you to install, if possible, this 
year distribution:

     https://tug.org/texlive/

I don't use Windows, but the error I see in the image you sent seems to 
be about the code page you use (cp720). I don't know if it will cause a 
problem with a new TeXLive 2020 installation.

According to the README in

    https://ctan.org/pkg/revtex?lang=en

yes, that will do ---but I can't be sure if revtex 4.2 (2019) will work 
fine under TeXLive 2015.

So the problem is installation FROM a folder with a space in the
path. You can create a virtual drive with e.g.:

subst k: "C:\Users\Frijoles con Arroz\Desktop\install-tl-20200820"
cd /d k:\
install-tl-windows.bat

And after installation:
cd /d c:
subst k: /d

I'll apply some such fix to our installer.

Subject: Biber 2.15 cannot find bib files in texmf directory due to a
 kpsewhich error
Message-ID: <CAKP36g5t_nU5G-=zEB1vtceP3yWsgLHvZ_gbE0VbrFmWf0dysw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have just updated my TeXLive distribution and biber has been updated
to version 2.15.
Unfortunately, since the new update, biber cannot find my bib file (in
this case mwe.bib) contained in ~/texmf/bibtex/bib/local/ due to an
"Inappropriate I/O control operation" error returned by kpsewhich,
even though I have successfully indexed the texmf directory with
mktexlsr
and `kpsewhich mwe.bib` returns the correct file path.
This seems to be a regression, since the previous version of biber
could find bib files just fine
My environment is TeXLive 2020 running on Windows 10 Pro 1909 64-bit
and biber 2.15
I also attach the relevant files that should reproduce the issue.
Thank you for your attention.

Thanks for the detailed report, but biber bugs need to be reported to

biber/biblatex maintainer (Philip Kime) is not on this list. --best, karl.

you have two braces pairs here:

\addbibresource{{mwe.bib}}

change this to

     \addbibresource{mwe.bib}

Thanks Ulrike, that was the problem.
I was surprised because previous versions of biber worked just fine
even with two braces pairs.

The real problem was some inappropriate quoting in
install-tl-windows.bat, which should be fixed in the next update. So
then the workaround with subst should no longer be needed.

I'd say the fact that

     \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
     \addbibresource{{biblatex-examples.bib}}

     \begin{document}
     \cite{sigfridsson}
     \printbibliography
     \end{document}

used to work in biblatex v3.14/Biber 2.14 was accidental. It worked 
because Biber globbed the argument of \addbibresource and apparently the 
globbing rules turned '{biblatex-examples.bib}' into 
'biblatex-examples.bib'.

In biblatex v3.15/Biber 2.15 globbing is no longer on by default 
(because it caused some issues and is probably more confusing than 
useful to the average user). But you can explicitly turn it back on if 
you like.

     \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
     \addbibresource[glob]{{biblatex-examples.bib}}

     \begin{document}
     \cite{sigfridsson}
     \printbibliography
     \end{document}

In any case, I'd say the expected/correct/usual input here would use 
only one pair of curly braces

     \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
     \addbibresource{biblatex-examples.bib}

     \begin{document}
     \cite{sigfridsson}
     \printbibliography
     \end{document}

Best,
Moritz

Sure.

Meaning 2 in <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glob#Verb>. From 'glob

Hello all,

not sure if this is the right place to ask. Is there a luajithbtex
binary for windows 386 in TeXLive?

I have seen luahbtex and luajittex, but not the combination of jit and hb.

Thank you

Yes, there is a luajithbtex.exe in luajittex.win32.r55431.tar.xz.
If you mean i386-cygwin, there is a luajithbtex.exe in luajittex.i386-cygwin.r55384.tar.xz.

  Your incurious curiosity never ceases to amaze me.  It doesn?t take
long to find more information, for example

	https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/shell-scripting-expert/9781118166321/c04-anchor-1.xhtml

that states that ?global? refers to the fact that /etc/glob was supposed
to search all the directories in $PATH, as opposed to /bin only, which
was its original, buggy behaviour.

Subject: mirror functioning on one machine but not another
Message-ID: <357A4963-200C-4041-A2E3-A9B4D63CB7AA@gmail.com>

I have TeX Live 2020 installed on a number of Linux machines, and updating regularly from various mirrors. As of today (Sun, Aug 30 morning EST) one of the machines hangs while trying to update from 

http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/systems/texlive/tlnet

Output:

--- cut here ---

$ tlmgr update --self --all
---
Unable to download the checksum of the remote TeX Live database,
but found a local copy, so using that.               
You may want to try specifying an explicit or different CTAN mirror,
or maybe you need to specify proxy information if you're behind a firewall;                               see the information and examples for the -repository option at                                            https://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html
(and in the output of install-tl --help).                                                                 tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: unknown)    tlmgr: saving backups to $HOME/texlive/2020/tlpkg/backups

--- end ---

The above used to work just fine yesterday, say.

At the same time though, on a different machine (different network):

--- cut here ---
$ tlmgr update --self --all
---
tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)
tlmgr: saving backups to $HOME/texlive/2020/tlpkg/backups
--- end ---

I am positive I'm not behind a firewall or any such thing. Other mirrors work, as did this one very recently.

You need to uninstall the distribution version of TL and install in
its place upstream TL, see https://tug.org/texlive/

Because some packages depend on TL, you should also check out
https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html, under 'Integrating vanilla
TeX Live with Debian'. There it is explained how to inform the linux
package manager that TL is really installed.

Hi,

/usr/local/texlive is a default location because it looks nice and it
is assumed that TL maintainer can get the permissions to that
directory. However, you can find a different scheme.

1. TeX Live from TUG should not require root permissions and should be
installed and maintained by a normal user.

2. TeX Live does not require a specific location, the path to its
binaries must only be at the beginning of PATH

3. You can have several versions of TeX live installed at the same
time and the first one in PATH wins.

If you wish to install the latest TL and cannot get permissions to
/usr/loca/texlive, you can create ~/texlive (i.e. in your $HOME) and
install into ~/texlive/2020. When you are done with installation, edit
your .bashrc and add:

export PATH=$HOME/texlive/2020/bin/x64_86:$PATH

All new terminals will then find your TL 2020. If you want to use it
also with GUI apps, you have to modify .bash_profile as well (and
restart X).

Unless one needs the latest stuff it's also possible to remove the
files installed with anaconda and install the TeX Live coming with
CentOS.  This can be done with

  sudo yum install texlive

but requires root permissions.

The reason this installation is currently incomplete is that it never
had explicitly installed this way.  Only a few packages were pulled in
as dependencies of other programs.

????, if you can install CentOS packages with sudo and don't need the
latest stuff it's certainly the easiest way to install and maintain
TeX Live.

Regards,
  Reinhard
