Subject: Exit Code on tlmgr Update Missing
Message-ID: <2536101601543325@mail.yandex.com>

Hi,

Today is 1st day of month and CI will download everything afresh. I had set up to so in GitHub Actions,
where I had set up to install LaTeX on Windows every moth afresh. While, it happened, I happened to 
see a error in the logs 
https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/runs/1192033452?check_suite_focus=true#step:10:25 
where it didn't install packages. Note: It downloaded a Prebuild Executable from TinyTeX which was build
before this update on September 30.

===============================================================================
tlmgr itself needs to be updated.
Please do this via either
  tlmgr update --self
or by getting the latest updater for Unix-ish systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
and/or Windows systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
Then continue with other updates as usual.
===============================================================================

Now the problem is it should exit with status code 1, if there requires an update. That's it.

Cheers,
Naveen

Hi,

The console output you mentioned is strange,
at least for two points;

(1) It says
> This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020)
so it should be TL2020 but
> LaTeX2e <2017-04-15>
> Babel <3.10> and hyphenation patterns for 81 language(s) loaded.
so it claims LaTeX2e dated on 2017.
(The latest TL2020 has 2020-02-02 patch level 5)
Thus, your environment is not standard for some reason.

(2) Too many pages are written for your input:
> [1{/home/mathar/texlive/2020/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]
> [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12])
so 12 pages for just 6 \part commands?
It would not happen for any version of LaTeX, thus
I guess you have omitted some of the input code in your mail.


Best,
Hironobu

Just ignore that message. There was the very backslash missing

The example showed 12 pages of output (for 6 parts) because
by default the book style starts each part on a new double 
page... nothing to worry about and expected.

The LaTex2e <2017-04-15> may appear through some standard openSUSE
latex packages that are already installed (which is 2017), and
which I bypassed by putting the texlive/2020/bin.... in front
of everything of my PATH. Apparently I have to de-install also
the openSUSE 15.2 packages to avoid any interference.

I've finally managed to uninstall texlive2017 of the openSUSE 15.2 standard  distro
to move on to texlive2020:
- ran a few hundert times the zypper rm  on the texlive packages
- removed /var/lib/texmf /etc/texmf /var/cache/texmf
- edited TEXMFHOME in ~/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf
   so it is the same as in ~/texlive/2020/texmf.cnf
  (apparently install-tl only changes one of the two texmf.cnf 
  but not the other...)
- removed also libtexlua52-5
- finally (that was the key point of removing the 2017-05-14 outputs of pdflatex)
  cd ~/.texlive2020 ; rm -rf *

The only problem that remains (and that was actually the trigger to 
replace texlive 2017 by texlive 2020) is that a file with a \tableofcontents,
book document and something like > 18 parts will only show the first
page of the table of contents in the .dvi or .pdf file (although the .toc
is complete with all parts). Apparently there are some optional page breaks missing
in the \tableofcontents handler. Example:

\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\part{kap 1 }

\part{kap 2 }
2
\part{kap 3 }
3
\part{kap 4 }

You really only needed to set the PATH it is not necessary to uninstall an
old tex live (I have texlives 2016 through to 2020 installed for example)

The table of contents code here hasn't changed since latex2e was introduced
in the 1990s so is unaffected by the update.

This is a tex coding issue not one for the texlive distribution so this is
the wrong list, but book class prevents page breaks after the part level
entry to ensure the following chapter and section entries fall on the same
page as their part, but as you only have parts it fails.

If it is just temporary while the document is in draft you could ignore it,
the problem will go once the parts have real content, but if you do have
parts with no containing chapters and sections you could replace

\tableofcontents

by

{\let\nobreak\relax\tableofcontents}

to allow page breaking between the entries.

\tableofcontents does nothing special, it just prints the contents of
the toc file. If LaTeX locks in this command and displays just a part
of the table of contents, the most probable reason is that you have a
fragile macro in your \part, \chapter, \section etc. The macro is the
expanded on a wrong place which can cause an endless loop. Try to
shorten your document (you can put \end{document} to the middle of the
file, the rest will be ignored). Remove the .aux and .toc files and
try to compile the document. You will see where it fails. You can also
look to the aux file and toc file. If you see a strange garbage, you
will know that this it the place where a fragile macro gets expanded.
Having found the place you have to protect the fragile macro with
\protect. If you use the hyperref package, you can get a similar
problem when the outlines are generated. You may need \texorpdfstring.

Memoir switched to use the new hook code but the old version required
doubling the # the new one not.
A quick fix would be to add

\let\OldAtEndPackage\AtEndPackage
\def\AtEndPackage#1{\def\temp{#1}\expandafter\OldAtEndPackage\expandafter{\temp}}

but that would break if the code was updated, Possibly best would be to
make a local copy of memhfixc.sty and replace ## by #
but we'll coordinate with Lars (CC'ed) and get an update to ctan

Just for reference the correct fix (by David) is


 \newcommand\AtEndPackage[2]{\def\temp{\AddToHook{package/after/#1}{#2}}\temp}

so as a temp fix add

\renewcommand\AtEndPackage[2]{\def\temp{\AddToHook{package/after/#1}{#2}}\temp}

before loading hyperref

An updated memoir has been sent to CTAN

Subject: Re: Sudden conflict memoir and hyperref

Memoir switched to use the new hook code but the old version required doubling the # the new one not.
A quick fix would be to add

\let\OldAtEndPackage\AtEndPackage
\def\AtEndPackage#1{\def\temp{#1}\expandafter\OldAtEndPackage\expandafter{\temp}}

but that would break if the code was updated, Possibly best would be to make a local copy of memhfixc.sty and replace ## by #
but we'll coordinate with Lars (CC'ed) and get an update to ctan

Message-ID: <CANfjC08h_DPU53tTBvVkCuH2yZ+RGX8iiMn=PqGxz_o+SNzeAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Today I updated babel (56239 -> 56531), which triggered a LaTeX format rebuild.
But a document of mine stopped working, so temporarily I did
    tlmgr restore babel 56239
to get the old babel back, but it didn't rebuild the formats automatically
(which it should, if I'm not mistaken), so I had to manually do
    fmtutil-sys --all
and updating again rebuilt the format as usual.

I think 'tlmgr restore' should trigger format rebuild for packages that do so
when updated, otherwise you might end up with a wrong format.

Best,
Phelype

Message-ID: <CAHyF3ogPJ36xQGP-E2c8jT9kisrYawjQH+n76b9ycVgL0YW7cg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
  this is my first post. I am trying to create a docker build of the
texlive packages. I found one online, but it doesn't do the gpg checking or
shasum check.

In my attempt to do this it appears to be working, except that the
install-tl-unx.tar.gz  was recently updated, (looks like it happened today)
and is causing a mismatch. It is not clear to me at first glance to report
issues like that or what the next steps would be to resolving the issue.

I have read that gpg key things can be finicky, but would like to have a
reasonably secure way to grab the files and do the install. If anyone has a
docker build that  already does this, that would be great.

Regards,
 ~Kurt

Which one did you find? The one from the Island of TeX?
https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive

We are trying to provide more or less all relevant TL builds to our 
users and are open to feature requests of all kinds. After reading your 
mail we immediately added such a check:

https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive/-/commit/6620b936b174c4e6b4670aa221e05769ffd5fee4 
for sha512

and

https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive/-/commit/000678d5533774adf6af7c8621186e1fdd9a61ef 
for gpg.

Sometimes these mismatches are caused by mirrors updating their files. 
In this case, waiting a few minutes solves the problem. This is the most 
common cause we have found for such errors. For us, testing with a few 
mirrors, the shasum check succeeds.

 From now on, the Island of TeX build will do it. :)

If you need anything else, feel free to open feature requests there.

Cheerio,

Paulo

Hi Kurt,

in addition to what Paulo wrote,

> In my attempt to do this it appears to be working, except that the
> install-tl-unx.tar.gz  was recently updated, (looks like it happened today)
> and is causing a mismatch. It is not clear to me at first glance to report

If you download the files
	install-tl-unx.tar.gz
	install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512
	install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512.asc
from the very same mirror, then unless you just hit the short time when
it is syncing these files, there shouldn't be a mismatch.

The steps that our installer and tlmgr does is:
- check whether the sha512 checksum of install-tl-unx.tar.gz is the one
  in install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512
	sha512sum -c install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512
- check whether the signature given by install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512.asc
  can be verified for install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512 
	gpg --verify install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512.asc install-tl-unx.tar.gz.sha512
These two together guarantee that the files are the original/correct
ones.

Best

Hmm, interesting. It should somehow, at least the code says so, but
indeed it doesn't ... guess I have to dig through it and see what I
find.

Thanks for the report.

Ok, fixed in the repo, will be in the next release of tlmgr we push out.
Was a single line of code missing.

Version 3.7n of the memoir document class, dated 2020-10-04, appears at ctan.org/pkg./memoir.

How long should it take before that latest version becomes available at repositories so as to be found by the TeXLive Utility?

With TLU I?m using repository http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet and still that memoir version has not yet been listed.

As there isn't much structural requirements on CTAN uploads, the process has to be manual in order to make sure things get into the right places.

Hi Herb,

Yes, that is planned and ok, since the correct map files are created by install-tl and tlmgr when packages are installed or updated.

It you see some hiccups, please let us know.

As I'm using custom fonts (pfa/tfm/afm) and add their map files using
updmap-sys: Is there any info how to install fonts with tlmgr?

Hi Orm,

Tlmgr is only responsibly for installing packages from TeX Live repositories, and uses updmap-sys to update the map files.

If you have personal fonts, we suggest one of the best practices listed here
https://tug.org/texlive/scripts-sys-user.html

Hope that helps

All the best

Norbert

Message-ID: <20201008052443.GB25191@bulldog.preining.info>

Hi all,

the following minimal document stopped compiling with the update of
babel-french

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\newfloat{figure}{ht}{lof}
\begin{document}
Hello World
\end{document}

With version 3.5j (TeX Live package revision 55742) it compiles, with
the current version 3.5k (TL package revision 56333) it fails with

! LaTeX Error: Command \fnum at table undefined.

Mind that the line
	\newfloat{figure}{ht}{lof}
is essential, commenting it makes the document work again.

I am not really sure where the issue is, anyone having an idea?

Thanks

Norbert

The problem seems to be the following

minimal is minimal so nothing is defined.


french.ldf contains


\AtBeginDocument{%
  \ifx\FBfigtabshape\relax
  \else
    \ifdefined\fnum at figure
      \let\fnum at figureORI\fnum at figure
      \let\fnum at tableORI\fnum at table
      \renewcommand{\fnum at figure}{{\ifFBfrench\FBfigtabshape\fi
                                   \fnum at figureORI}}%
      \renewcommand{\fnum at table}{{\ifFBfrench\FBfigtabshape\fi
                                  \fnum at tableORI}}%
    \fi
  \fi
}

note that it only tests for \fnum at figure

But \newfloat{figure}{ht}{lof} defines \fnum at figure and thus the french test is true, but there is no \fnum at table

In the article class both \fnum at figure and \fnum at table is defined by default.

Running  this code right before \begin{document}

\makeatletter
\typeout{\meaning\fnum at figure}
\typeout{\meaning\fnum at table}
\makeatother

shows whether the macros are defined before the french test sees them

Probably that french test ought to be split into two handling figure and table separately

Hi Lars,

thanks for your analysis.

Well, the code is extracted from a cls file, so I based it on minimal to
be sure that it does not interfere.

> Probably that french test ought to be split into two handling figure and table separately

Indeed!

I think I have a letter class that does not define floats so users might use the same strategy. Though the letter class does not support French.

I've sent a bug-report to the maintainer.

TeXWorks. Now the programm seems to be freshly installed. What are the

The cited ?best practices? does not address the common situation for Mac users who put all their local fonts, etc., in ~/Library/texmf.

This is case 3, put all the fonts in TEXMFHOME and it is a very very very bad idea to do.

Maybe some people in the mactex mailing list have better ideas, but the need to run updmap in user mode is simply too error prone in my experience of about 20+ years.

In the zsh Terminal shell on my system running macOS Catalina,

	echo $TEXMFHOME

gives an empty result.

Ahh.. I forgot about that ? this is not a variable known to the shell, just to TeX, right?

A shell variable will override the kpathsea variable. So you can set
	export TEXMFHOME=/some/strange/lib
(or the zsh equivalent) and it will be correctly picked up by the TeX
programs. But the default/origin is defined in texmf.cnf files

	kpsewhich -all texmf.cnf

Usually
	PREFIX/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf
	PREFIX/texlive/2020/texmf.cnf

Best

Hi all,

I have another set of missing dependencies:

koma: xpatch
circuitikz: xstring
mathtools: mleftright
threeparttable: tabulary, tabu
tabu: varwidth
verbatim: environ
environ: trimspaces
tikz-feynman: pgfopts

Would be great if those could be included.
Thanks!

Max

Hi,

Sorry, I might misread logs on which files included which not-included 
dependencies.
I am debugging a CI build starting from a minimal installation.

I will check more thoroughly again.

I am confused about your statement concerning environ, since:
* https://ctan.org/pkg/environ
* I could do tlmgr install environ
* tcolorbox (sorry, not verbatim, requires it):

I've just checked on my VM. With minimal files, I find the follow have 
*no* missing dependencies:

- circuitikz
- koma-script
- mathtools
- threeparttable

I find the following missing dependencies

- tabu: varwidth
- environ: trimspaces
- pgf: epstopdf-pkg
- tikz-feynman: pgf, pgfopts, iftex

Like David, I do not understand the comment about "verbatim".

pgf surely does *not* depend on epstopdf-pkg.  This is a transitive
dependency of something else (probably graphicx) and nicely showcases
the state (or rather the absence) of dependency tracking in TeX Live.

Added those two.

    - tikz-feynman: pgf, pgfopts, iftex

Made pgfopts depend on pgf.
Made tikz-feynman depend on pgfopts and iftex.

    - pgf: epstopdf-pkg
    hm> pgf surely does *not* depend on epstopdf-pkg.  

Indeed. I surmise it happens when running pdflatex on an eps file.
I did not add epstopdf-pkg anywhere.

    absence) of dependency tracking in TeX Live.

"TeX Live" cannot solve the problem of "Package X depends on package Y
in my case, but not always".

Or rather, the only solution (that I can imagine) is to do runtime
installations a la MiKTeX, as has been said many times before. But that
is a hard job. And I imagine people building up their images from zero,
which is where the recent onslaught of dependency requests is coming
from, wouldn't want to use such a feature anyway.

Continuing to add all these static dependencies is an error-prone
pain. I have no way to notice when a dependency goes stale.

I see no solution. Sigh. -k

Hopefully over time we will make progress :)

Subject: Packaging acrotex with TeX Live
Message-ID: <CAKObCaqE+=y8pwbCDxWFi3OU0tyv70ih=udEtSbPDGKCeE34zA@mail.gmail.com>

As I understand it, acrotex is not packaged with TeX Live because it's
believed that proprietary software (Acrobat) is required to generate PDFs
with acrotex.  (See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=635834
for details.). However, the author of the package told me:
> In acrotex, the only acrobat requirement is with insdljs for users of the
tex to dvi  to dvips to distiller/acrobat. For users of pdflatex, lualatex,
and xelatex, distiller/acrobat not required.

So, if this is accurate and I'm understanding the author correctly, none of
the files have a requirement of distiller/acrobat.  If this is the case, is
there anything in the way of TeX Live shipping acrotex?  (I personally find
eforms quite useful, and don't use Acrobat in my PDF generation pipeline.)

Thanks,
Jason

Might be, if you think so, please discuss with upstream at
texlive at tug.org and see whether you can convince the team there, in
particular Karl Berry, who is the guardian of what is going into TL.

Other option is that someone picks up acrotex and packages it separately
for Debian, shouldn't be too difficult (since tlmgr ready repackaging is
available).

Actually, hyperref allows creation of pdf forms
I checked on our Linux server: indeed Okular can display forms but cannot
fill them
but evince can fill and save!

hyperref creates pdf forms too. 

Also nothing prevents other pdf viewers to support forms - the
standard is open.

There have been multiple forms implementations (Wikpedia). Some software
lets you overlay text in form
boxes, but some fillable forms are designed to stash entries in
external files or apply javascript processing..

In particular, Adobe XML Forms Architecture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_XML_Forms_Architecture> (XFA,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFA) is not
compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do
not handle XFA
content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an
external proprietary
specification, was deprecated in ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).

It would be nice to have an open source tool that tells you what forms
implementation is used by
a given PDF document.

Message-ID: <202010112135.09BLZbGY003039@freefriends.org>

Hi Jason,

    there anything in the way of TeX Live shipping acrotex?

Many years ago, after some discussion about Acrobat dependencies, etc.,
Dr. Story simply asked me not to include his various acropackages in TL.
Most of Dr. Story's packages are thus not in TL. (I have added a few
completely generic ones over the years. He sure does amazing work.)

I imagine we could ask him again, but (a) first I would want to do
research about dependencies, etc., and I don't have any time for this
for the foreseeable future, and (b) preparing this big package for TL
will be quite a bit of work.

Thus, my suggestion for now is that you, or someone else who wants this,
do the packaging and upload it to https://contrib.texlive.info/ (see
info at bottom of that page for details). There is certainly no problem
with having them on tlcontrib.

    eforms quite useful, and don't use Acrobat in my PDF generation pipeline.)

And what do you (or your users) use to read the resulting forms?

It's true that I have been somewhat lax about allowing form-related and
media-related PDF packages into TL even though, in practice, they have
required nonfree PDF readers to work well, as far as I know. There was
some code in the evince or okular repositories at one point which is the
fingerhold I grabbed to allow it; I don't know if that code ever went
mainstream or if any of the other free software viewers work with
typical cases of these fancy pdf features.

I'm glad to hear there has been some success with evince. I haven't had
a lot of luck myself, but it could easily be a version issue. Or a
standards vs. non-standards issue, as George describes.

Ulrike: I know the standard is open, but if the practical reality is
that it is only nonfree software that supports feature XYZ, it wouldn't
be right to include packages whose main purpose is to deal with feature
XYZ.  This has always been the case with TeX Live (and teTeX and tex-k
before that).

As for hyperref, of course creating forms is hardly its main
purpose. Thus I feel justified in ignoring the issue there. It is all a
big dark gray area, admittedly.

Best,
Karl

I have tried the document and okular says:
This document has XFA forms, which are currently unsupported.

evince just says that I need a newer Acrobat Reader

gs says the same

libreoffice says the same

qpdfview-qt5 says the same with strange formatting (extremely wide font)

After googling a little I have downloaded, installed and tested Master
PDF Editor from https://code-industry.net/free-pdf-editor/#get
It can fill in XFA forms and save the file. Tested in Fedora 32.

Sure but the fact that the standard is open since quite some time
means that the probability that only "nonfree viewers" supports  a
feature requested by enough people is quite low. And as expected
searching a bit gives lots of hits outside adobe.

Unfortunately this is not the case. The Linux version of Acrobat
Reader 9 depends on obsolete libraries, their support was discontinued
a few years ago and can no longer be installed. This means that I am
not able to fill in the XFA forms for more than two years and I google
every year. This time I managed to find proprietary Master PDF Editor.
In the past I tried several other viewers which were incapable of
opening the XFA form.

Maybe soon possible with Firefox:

  Firefox supports AcroForm, which will soon allow you to fill in, print, and save supported PDF forms and the PDF viewer also has a new fresh look.

That is not true.  I recently got Acrobat reader 9.5.5 running on
Slackware64-current (which is very up to date, unlike Slackware 14.2,
the most recent "released" version of Slackware).  To get it running
there I needed to install some 32-compatibility stuff (which, as I
understand it, many 64-bit Linux distributions install by default),
but that was about it.

I don't know if you said earlier which Linux distro / version you use,
but perhaps installing Acroread is not as impossible as you think.

Having said that, I agree it would be nice if Adobe would create an
updated version for Linux.

Even if you can run Adobe Reader 9.5.5, you definitely shouldn't.  It
has tons of unfixed code execution vulnerabilities.

https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-497/version_id-124630/Adobe-Acrobat-Reader-9.5.html

It is also vulnerable to a whole class of information exfiltration
attacks.

I think one of us is not interpreting that page correctly.  (I think
it was you.)  (Unless my eyes deceive me) All of those vulnerabilities
say "***before*** 9.5.5" (or 9.5.4 or 9.5.3).  And so it would seem to
me they don't apply to 9.5.5.

That might be so.  But for someone looking at documents which are not
signed (or have other security features), I'm don't see the relevance.

I realize this thread started with someone talking about PDF viewers
which support security features, but (at most) I think you could advise
"don't use PDF files for security applications", as opposed to "Don't
use Acroread 9.5.5".

Cheers.

This is very unfortunate.

Since the standard is open, I wonder whether (1) there is a developer
willing to implement it in a library/plugin for popular free browsers
like xpdf or evince, and (2) it would be a good idea to use devfund
money to incentivize (1).  I realize this is not strictly TeX issue,
but I'd argue that a free XFA form reader plugin is important for the
TeX wellbeing.  What do you think?

You're right, but all of these apply:

You're missing the point.  If you open a document that contains forms,
they can be used to exfiltrate whatever you enter into those forms to a
remote attacker.

By that logic you could also say ?don't use your computer for security
applications? as opposed to ?don't use Windows XP?.  Using outdated
software with known vulnerabilites is *always* a bad idea.

Hi,

I think we are confusing different things here: PDF (including
AcroForms) is an open standard and supported (more or less) by multiple
open-source PDF readers (At least in Okular and Evice, probably PDF.js soon)
The support is far from perfect, but it's usable. These are the forms
which can be created using hyperref or acrotex.

XFA forms on the other hand are not supported by any open-source reader
AFAIK, but there is no open standard for them (Adobe publishes the free
specification though), they can't be created by any TeX package existing
and they are deprecated in the current PDF standard. (Also I think Acrobat
Reader can only edit them if the document has reader extensions enabled, but
that might have changed)
They are used mostly to provide dynamic forms (where e.g. additional
form fields get added on demand) but if I understand the format
correctly, using this requires writing an XML description of the form
which would basically involve creating a XML backend for TeX.
I think it is safe to say that at least without LuaTeX there will be no
TeX generated XFA forms in the foreseeable future.

So in my opinion any resources would be (from a TeX perspective) better invested
in improving the AcroForm and JavaScript support rather than implementing XFA.

Best regards,
Marcel

I looked at a few of those, and clearly there are lots of issues.
More on this in my next comment.

So you seem to be saying "don't use Acroread 9.5.5 on PDF documents
with forms from untrusted sources".  This is good knowledge.  But it
is a lot different than "you definitely shouldn't use Acroread 9.5.5
at all".  For example, I'm not seeing why I shouldn't use Acroread to
look at PDF docs that I created.  Or that were created by people I
trust.

I disagree.  I really don't see how me looking at (form free) PDF
files I created with Acroread is a bad idea.  And if I wanted to
restrict myself to using a computer system which I am 100% certain has
no vulnerabilities, I guess I'd have to audit the motherboard to see
if any components have been added by the fabricator, and also to audit
every line of code of every bit of software.  That is impractical, so
I have to accept that there is a certain risk with using any computer.
One can reduce one's risk by knowing about significant vulnerabilities
and avoiding them (and, again, knowing about the issues Acroread has
with PDFs with forms is valuable information, thanks for that), but
pretending that "non-outdated" software with no publicly known
vulnerabilities is perfectly safe is clearly not sensible.

Cheers.

Redhat based distributions do not install 32-bit stuff as default but
can be installed automatically as dependences and can also be
installed manually if I explicitly specify it. I use Fedora and AR was
available from Adobe as rpm, hence dnf (previously yum) installed the
required packages. However, these libraries ceased to exist a few
years ago. If the need arises, I still have full commercial Adobe
Acrobat 9 installed in Windows XP running in VirtualBox.

Dear friends,


&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently I updated the texlive version, and then there was a bug. But there was no problem with the compiled PDF before the update.&nbsp;


When I compile the CVPR2021 template, the line numbers on the right side of the PDF are shifted, as shown below. The left side is problematic, the right side is correct.&nbsp;


I can't find any bugs, I hope that you can help me. Maybe there is a problem with the updated package.&nbsp;The attachments are my compilation log and update log.


Thanks!


Best,


Jack

Message-ID: <c881ccaf4888142d926e8c40f9730de2f5ae7801.camel@fh-aachen.de>

Hi all,

I try to compile a small LaTeX-file (the content doesn't matter), it
ends with an error message

Der Prozedureinsprungpunkt "u8getmbstring" wurde in der DLL
"E:\texlive\2020\bin\win32\luahbtex.dll" nicht gefunden

the English version would be something like

The procedure entry point "u8getmbstring" wasn't found in the DLL
"E:\texlive\2020\bin\win32\luahbtex.dll"

The same happens when I try to update my TeXLive 2020 installation using
TLShell.exe (tlmgr works fine).

If I have a look at that DLL, I see a string "u8getmbstring". What can I
do?

Kind regards
Jobst

Probably your lua53.dll is an old one.
u8getmbstring() is defined in lua53.dll in TeX Live 2020.
"u8getmbstring" in luahbtex.dll is calling it in lua53.dll.

I could at first not reproduce this on my 2020 installation on
linux, but after updating I saw the same problem.

Reproduced it here; to avoid the problem you can add

\RequirePackage[2020/02/02]{latexrelease}

at the beginning of the source file (cvpr.tex).
It seems that LaTeX2e 2020-10-01 update is somehow related.

Hi,

I identified the problem in cvpr.cls; it contains two lines
        \put(\LenToUnit{\textwidth\kern
30pt},\LenToUnit{-\cvprruleroffset}){%right ruler
and
        \put(\LenToUnit{\textwidth\kern-8pt},\LenToUnit{45pt}){\pid}
in the \makevruler definitions.

Such a usage of \LenToUnit is quite unexpected, and completely unreasonable.
They should be
        \put(\LenToUnit{\dimexpr\textwidth+30pt},\LenToUnit{-\cvprruleroffset}){%right
ruler
and
        \put(\LenToUnit{\dimexpr\textwidth-8pt},\LenToUnit{45pt}){\pid}
respectively.  The reason why the behavior changed is that
LaTeX2e 2020-10-01 changed the expansion procedure of \put arguments.

You should report to the maintainer of cvpr.cls.

% cvpr.cls contains lots of spaghetti codes, which are copied from old
versions of
% everyshi.sty and eso-pic.sty; that is another issue, which may break
in the future.

I was just going to reply the same that I don't see how the kern worked
before at all.
In the new format you can simply use

 \put(\textwidth+30pt,-\cvprruleroffset)

No need for the  LenToUnit  so something like


\ifx\@defaultunitsset\@undefined
        \put(\LenToUnit{\textwidth\kern
30pt},\LenToUnit{-\cvprruleroffset}){%right ruler
          \cvprruler{\cvprrulercount}}
\else
        \put(\textwidth+30pt,-\cvprruleroffset){%right ruler
          \cvprruler{\cvprrulercount}}
\fi


although the old version with \textwidth\kern 30pt can't really be doing
anything sensible.

You are right. Updating luatex.win32 solved the problem.

IMHO that's unfortunately no option for beginners, but I will try it.

SyncTeX: Can't rename FalterInLenzkirch.synctex(busy) to
FalterInLenzkirch.synctex.gz

Texlive is the multiuser version. The file
FalterInLenzkirch.synctex(busy) refuses to be removed even if I acquire
admin rights. After re-booting the file can be removed. That however,
seems to to tiresome.

Is this behavior of synxtex normal?

Kind regards.

'ello,

I bet a dollar to a doughnut that this issue might be related to the 
following thread, since TeXStudio is also listed in our findings:

https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-September/046111.html

The file you mentioned is most certainly in use, as the underlying 
process is still active, hence you cannot remove it. Instead of 
rebooting your computer, try opening the task manager in Windows and 
kill the process associated to the TeX engine. That might release the 
file handler and you will be able to remove it.

Cheerio,

Paulo

PS: ooh a doughnut

Skim is BSD licensed, which used to fit under most reasonable

Quite right. Sorry for having skimmed Skim which is even listed

texlive creates sometimes (I don't know which events triggers this,

This format files are normally unwanted as they shadow the formats

triggered by such user formats, e.g.
https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues/781, and of mysterious and

first few times it happened it was quite time consuming to debug).   

I'm alone on my computer. I never run fmtutil-user manually and I
never want formats in .texlive2020/texmf-var/web2c. Is there a way
to avoid to get them? If some events triggers this format creation I
would greatly prefer to get an error about a faulty or missing

Hi all,

I am not sure but I think that it happens if a format is requested but
does not exist in the global TEXMF-VAR tree. In such a case it is
automatically generated in the user's tree and does not get updated.
If the maintainer creates all formats during installation and they are
updated after each "tlmgr update", it should not happen (unless a user
generates a format explicitly).

Hi Ulrike,

I cannot add much to what Zdenek said. The only time I have seen this is
with missing formats that are then auto-generated in $TEXMFVAR instead
of $TEXMFSYSVAR.

Possible ways to disable this behaviour are:
- set MKTEXFMT=0 in texmf.cnf and disable automatic format generation
  completely
- change the code that formats are always generated in TEXMFSYSVAR and
  if that is not possible, fail

Add
	MKTEXFMT=0
to your .../texlive/2020/texmf.cnf

Well it happens, and quite regularly. In the last months I deleted
more than once a format there - and I swear I didn't delete the
system formats before. And e.g just today Phelype had the problem
that he didn't see a fix because of a local format:

kpsewhich --all --engine=pdftex pdflatex.fmt
/home/phelype/.texlive2020/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt

I can't say if it is due to something new in texlive - it could be
that it only pop ups now more often as expl3 checks if the format
has the correct date.

If you can give me a recipe how to reproduce it, I will surely find an
explanation and fix for it, but I have personally never seen this
problem, so I cannot do anything.

What does that mean? But whatever expl3 rejects, I can't imagine that it
triggers a format rebuild ... or?

Message-ID: <93430069-4e04-b54e-4277-1cc170d13552@medialab.sissa.it>

Hi,

I just want to report that the aforementioned packages stopped working
after the fall 2020 LaTeX update (between September 29th and October
14th), because they change internal LaTeX macros.

I've reported it to the LaTeX-project (see also MWE below)
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/411
but it is probably a "distribution" problem, in the sense that maybe
these package should be marked in some way (to report a warning or
something).


I want to take the opportunity to thank all for the good work on the
tex-live distribution. I use it a lot on a lot of linux distros and
never had a problem.

I must also say that I was surprised to get a breaking change during an
in-release update :)


Compiling the MWE below gives error with texlive 2020 installed today,
but not with texlive 2020 installed around September 29th.

MWE:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xwatermark}
\begin{document}
test
\end{document}


Thanks
Matteo Gamboz

I have now set mktexfmt to 0. Perhaps this will give me errors at
the time it happens and I can give details. Until now I often
realize that a wrong format is there only some times later.

No, but it means that an older format lurking around is detected
faster. 

Without expl3 you need to look at the date or test for something
specific in the new format. With expl3 you get an error if you have
new expl3 files and a format build with an older expl3---and I
naturally have normally very new expl3 files around.

    Well it happens, and quite regularly. 

Ulrike, if you look at
/usr/local/texlive/dev/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr-commands.log (that is,
wherever your TEXMFSYSVAR is; .../dev is my test tree), it should be
reporting exactly what command was run and exactly where the .fmt was
installed.

[Thu Oct 15 00:19:34 2020] running fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-engine=luajithbtex,luajittex,mfluajit --byfmt eplain
[Thu Oct 15 00:19:36 2020] success, output:
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence order):
.. lots of output ...
fmtutil [INFO]: log file copied to: /usr/local/texlive/dev/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/eplain.log
fmtutil [INFO]: /usr/local/texlive/dev/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/eplain.fmt installed.
..

If the user TEXMFVAR shows up there, perhaps a clue can be garnered. If
it doesn't show up, then fmtutil-user must be getting invoked by
something other than tlmgr. BTW, in my test installation, which I never
touch except to run tlmgr update --all nightly, I have never had a .fmt
created in TEXMFVAR. Puzzling.


Norbert: what I've always missed in tlmgr-commands.log (and its
predecessors :) is a line that straightforwardly says "rebuilding
foo.fmt due to update of package bar", or whatever the reason is for the
fmt update. I mean, tlmgr must know why it's calling
fmtutil. Unfortunately I've never looked into adding it myself and now I
am tied up with TUGboat et al. for the foreseeable future. Wdyt?

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Matteo,

Thanks for the reports, but I'm afraid I don't see anything to do.

    but it is probably a "distribution" problem, in the sense that maybe
    these package should be marked in some way (to report a warning or
    something).

There is no way in TL to "mark" packages or report warnings.
Nor do we (TL) have any way of knowing whether an update to a given
package on CTAN will cause problems.

    I must also say that I was surprised to get a breaking change during an
    in-release update :)

The breaking changes are unfortunate, but all TL can do is redistribute
what gets uploaded to CTAN. Running tlmgr update means "give me the
latest stuff". 

    xwatermark and catoptions
    I've reported it to the LaTeX-project (see also MWE below)
    https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/411

Reporting to LaTeX is fine, but I expect it would also be useful to
report the problem to the package authors. Based on the plethora of
other reports, my guess is that the packages need to change to take
account of the updates in the new LaTeX.

Best regards,
Karl

The package author (it is one in this case) has been notified around
three months ago that the patches of internal latex commands as done
in catoptions will no longer work.

files. That's how the unversioned names get found.

CTAN: can you contact the mirror owner? And maybe disable them from the
mirror list if they don't reply? --thanks, karl.

Yes, I did.
In any case, I've received interesting suggestions from the people of
the LaTeX project. I'm very grateful for all the work you do.

After a brief search it doesn't look like there is a way to install
packages from file with a list of package names? in python land `pip
install requirement.txt` is an example where the install dependencies are
specified in a file.

I would be happy to be wrong about this but didn't seem to find what I was
looking for.  I think this would be a very useful feature when you want
more fine grained control over what packages are installed, i.e. reduce
installation time over a network.

I found something that mentions tlmgr install `cat
nstalled_texlive_packages.txt`
That doesn't seem to be agnostic across OSes?

Not supported by tlmgr ATM. As you mentioned yourself
	tlmgr install `cat FILE`
works. I guess Windows cmd will have some similar facility.

I think that Windows port of xargs exists and if not, it can be easily

Hello all,

I'm having an issue with Biber on the Mac when using TeXworks: I'm not 
sure exactly where the issue lies, hence including the various mailing 
lists here.

Those of you on the MacTeX list will know I've been trying to do some 
apparently simple: access a single BibTeX file stored inside my 
'Documents' area. It seems this is tricky on the Mac using BIBINPUTS, so 
I have gone down the symlink route: I have in ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bib

     ln - s <path-to-directory-holding-my-database> Literature

 From the Terminal, everything is happy:

     joseph at palladium ~ % kpsewhich --biber Literature.bib
     /Users/joseph/Library/texmf/bibtex/bib/Literature.bib

and I can set up a test, run pdflatex/Biber/pdflatex and get nice 
references typeset. Things get weird, though, from inside TeXworks.

 From TeXworks, I *can* use classical BibTeX to find the file (using a 
suitable 'classical' input file). I can also find other files linked 
using symlinks, most notably some local classes. However, Biber can't 
find Literature.bib when run from inside TeXworks.

As I'm not relying on the environment, but only on the file system, I'm 
at a loss. Details of my TeXworks installation are below - it's a very 
recent install.

Anyone got any idea what's up? (Obviously I can just run Biber from the 
Terminal.) A quick test shows everything is OK from TeXShop too ...

Regards,

Joseph

Ulrike Fischer asked a good question: can Biber find other .bib files: 
it seems only if they are either 'here' or are given as absolute paths. 
That's not affected by the symlink aspect, so presumably there's 
something preventing tree searching.

Howdy,

But then why would biber find .bib files when executed in Terminal and TeXShop?

It's a path issue. From inside TeXworks, the path is simply

     /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

whereas in TeXShop or the Terminal it's

     /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/usr/local/bin

Presumably, Biber calls kpsewhich via the path, whereas I guess other 
tools have it linked so they don't need to find it. So the issue arises 
as that Biber doesn't say that it can't run kpsewhich, it just fails to 
do it :(

I've attached my typesetting set up as a screenshot: you can see that 
there, TeXworks does 'see' TeXbin, etc. So I'm not sure exactly where 
one can alter things.

Howdy,

But /Library/TeX/texbin should find the correct kpsewhich or did you add that too? PS: that should be better than the last item since it will track the active TeX distribution.

How are you calling biber? Do you have a processing tool to do that (I don't see all of them in the graphic)? Are you calling it with some input-directory flag set?

Good Luck,

Joseph,

it?s a login shell vs. non login shell issue, in part. If you double clicked TeXworks, it may  have run under a login shell with a partial environment set. In particular, you only get the synthesized path in /etc/zprofile.

There are two ways, more in fact, to solve this:

1. Launch TeXworks from inside a terminal with ?open -a TeXworks? and it should pick it up.
2. Drop a file called TeXLive (or whatever) containing the single line:
		/Library/TeX/texbin
    in the directory /etc/paths.d and it will properly synthesize the path. (It?s been like this for years, now.)

Back to the env vars question: why doesn?t setting BIBINPUTS to ?:/Users/joseph/Library/texmf/bibtex//:? work? This should be set in .zshenv and it should be picked up.

Howdy,

The MacTeX installer already does this. Was TeX Live installed by the MacTeX installer?

If my response to Paulo is still correct, I think this is a bug in TeXWorks. It needs to set up a correct PATH variable for child processes that it launches, if they in turn can execute child processes (although there are significant security implications for this). GUI applications on Mac OS X do not inherit environment variables from shell config files: the developer needs to provide an interface to set the environment appropriate (including the PATH); TextMate is a good example of how to do this. Alternately, maybe Joseph could wrap biber in a shell script that?sets up a good environment.

Adam

Hello,

You keep assuming that?s me, whereas I was merely answering Joseph, based on the information he posted. 

But to answer your question, no did *not* install TeX Live using the MacTeX installer, but I happen to know quite a bit about the system to know how path_helper works.

Hi,  the main documentation for the IEEEtran class (IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf

years of TeXLive. They are in my previous years, but not in 2019 or 2020.

The documentation still exists on CTAN and is mentioned in the README
document for the class.

Hmm. Seems a bit counterproductive for what is likely a widely used
class, but I guess policy is policy.  It would be helpful if texdoc
IEEEtran found that file if the main documentation didn't exist. But
this may not be possible. As it stands now, texdoc IEEEtran brings up
testflow_ctl_A4.pdf which is not particularly helpful.

As was already mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the terminal
environmental variables are not inherited by GUI applications,
unfortunately.

That being said, the current development version of Tw should
automatically append the path to the current typesetting tool to $PATH
on the Mac to act as a fallback for scenarios like yours (see also
https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/issues/861 and
https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/commit/f607e719625512e8940a97caf6e6dc3258763a0b).
If you want to test this behavior, the latest development binaries are
available at the bottom of
https://bintray.com/texworks/OSX-latest/TeXworks-for-Mac%3Alatest/view#files.

Subject: Texlive installer as a flatpak package
Message-ID: <b64665aa4670ead5badbfea6b342cfcf@posteo.de>

Dear texlive developers,

would anyone of you be interested in (co)maintaining a flatpak version 
of the texlive installer?
The background is that flatpak tries to be a new, distribution-agnostic 
package format for linux distribution. Currently there are also some tex 
editors packaged as flatpak packages, but at the moment each one of the 
brings a full texlive distribution (that I maintain). As this bloats the 
editors unnecessarily, I was wondering if we could just package the 
installer. In the following, the users could use tlmgr to individually 
install their latex packages, which would reduce the overall 
installation size of the respective editors. Additionally, perhaps it 
would spread your installer more among your users as the installer and 
tlmgr could be installed and started by a single click.


Regards

Jakob

I have no idea about flatpaks and all these new-style bloatware (sorry
for that - but I see snap/flat/whatever always bringing in hundreds of
other binaries and libraries - mostly without a somehow guaranteed
security audit).

Anyway, I understand the problem in flatpak, and I am open to help you
with tlmgr/texlive installation specific problems - so feel free to ask
here or directly me. I have helped to make a chocolatey package, so I
guess I have a bit of an idea about the lurking traps ;-)

That was with 
	tlmgr update --list
is this correct? Yes, there we don't error out, because, well, it just
lists what should be done...

OTOH,
	tlmgr update --all
**should** return error code when critical updates are available,
--force is NOT given.

Would you suggest something different?

Hi Norbert,


That error happened when I was running the command
```
tlmgr install standalone preview
```
Some packages which was missing with TinyTeX and required for Manim.
Doing that should have failed our CI process when tlmgr itself need to be
updated. It caused some issues on finding where was the error from. If
it failed there it would easy enough for us.

Hmm, it *should* fail. The respective code is
    if (check_for_critical_updates( $localtlpdb, $remotetlpdb)) {
      critical_updates_warning() if (!$::machinereadable);
      if ($opts{"force"}) {
        tlwarn("$prg: Continuing due to --force\n");
      } else {
        if ($::gui_mode) {
          # return here and don't do any updates
          return ($F_ERROR);
        } else {
          die "$prg: Terminating; please see warning above!\n";
        }
      }
    }
so that means if you did *not* pass in --fore, and are not running in
GUI mode, then the
	die "$prg: Terminating; please see warning above!\n";
should have happened. That should also mean a non-zero exit status.

If this didn't happen, that would be strange, or - again - some Windows
specific PITA.

I just tried on Linux, manually reduced the version of texlive.infra,
and then tried to install a package:
[~] tlmgr --repo /home/norbert/public_html/tlnet install 12many
tlmgr: package repository /home/norbert/public_html/tlnet (verified)
===============================================================================
tlmgr itself needs to be updated.
Please do this via either
  tlmgr update --self
or by getting the latest updater for Unix-ish systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
and/or Windows systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
Then continue with other updates as usual.
===============================================================================
tlmgr: Terminating; please see warning above!
[~] echo $?
255

And the exit code was correctly 255.

I am not sure what I should change here ....

Best

Norbert

I may be totally wrong about this, but isn't something possible with
custom sandboxing? E.g. with some snap packages users can request
access to the Documents folders, and for flatpaks there is
bubblewrap, about which I know even less. So maybe with the right
sandboxing options and a suitable location of TL, TL might be
accessible outright from within the sandbox.

But, like Norbert, I personally stay away from this stuff.

Dear Norbert and Siep,

I get your reasons. I then would propose to the maintainers of the tex 
editors to not bundle the texlive package. Instead they could give a 
short description how to use the binaries of a manual installation that 
have been installed with the netinstaller.


Regards

Jakob

Hi Loreno,

can you add a small example document which triggers this error?

Best regards,

Here is a small example that triggers the error.
Looks like it does not like \paragraph in front of align*

Hi Loreno,

Here's a smaller one:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{TeX Gyre Pagella}
\begin{document}
\setbox0\hbox{\textsc{Vertical}}%
\unhbox0\par
\end{document}

It seems to boil down to this recipe:
 - load polyglossia
 - load fontspec
 - \setmainfont
 - \setbox with \textsc (also depends what is in \textsc)
 - \unhbox
 - BOOM!

Simply moving polyglossia after \setmainfont seems to work (no idea how
well though).

polyglossia sets the luatex renderer to harfbuzz by default. So this
fails too:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{TeX Gyre Pagella}[Renderer=Harfbuzz]
\begin{document}
\setbox0\hbox{\textsc{Vertical}}%
\unhbox0\par
\end{document}

Corrected: it failed. Marcel has corrected it in the dev branch of
luaotfload.

Subject: Fonts don't work with a full texlive installation on Ubuntu 20.04
Message-ID: <CABQcWu8+Q4pKX7-_mE0NTWmjafqt5MbRMFA1sMnka473B1TF1Q@mail.gmail.com>

I've installed the full TeX Live on my laptop running Ubuntu 20.04, using
the following command:

$ sudo apt install texlive-full

After installation, I am able to run latex, pdflatex, etc., but compilation
fails whenever I try to specify a font.

Example: test1.tex contains

\documentclass{article}\usepackage{tgbonum}
\begin{document}
Hello world \LaTeX
\end{document}

Compiling it produces the following output:

$ pdflatex test1

Hi Sridhar,

your question is related to Debian/Ubuntu, so this is not the correct
place. Anyway.

Have there been any errors/failures during installation?

Can you run
	sudo updmap-sys
and send the output?

Thanks

Norbert

texdoc TETEXDOC says no documentation found for TETEXDOC.

texdoc tetexdoc returns the documentation for texdoc

texdoc returned nothing about any missing fonts.

Your message seemed to be entirely empty.

Anyway, perhaps what you are seeing is that I removed the
texmf-dist/doc/tetex directory in TL 2020, that is, the files
TETEXDOC.pdf and teTeX-FAQ. As far as I could tell, the information
therein (ca.2006) was either irrelevant to TeX Live or better available
in other documents for a long time since. --best, karl.
