I installed MacTeX pretest version 20203003 and I tried to refresh the map of non-free fonts with
getnonfreefonts --refreshmap
but I get (once for every font) the error:
updmap: top config file /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg has not been read. at /Library/TeX/texbin/updmap line 1495.
With the previous version of the pretest release I had no problem.
How can I solve this problem?

Regards

Giovanni

Giovanni and others,

The name, and thus date, of the package you used is 20200330; I just checked on TUG.

Note that the directory texlive/2020/texmf-config/web2 does not exist. It did not exist in 2019 either. 
 
The updmap in bin/x86_64-darwin is a link to a perl script, and line 1495 of that script indeed prints out the error message you report, but the path containing web2 is in a variable defined elsewhere. I don't read perl, so I leave further remarks to others.

Perhaps someone on this list can guess what went wrong here. I don't use the nonfreefonts and am reluctant to install them and test further.

The file is created automatically by updmap whenever changes are
made (if you install own fonts or if you change parameters).

I cannot reproduce the problem here on Linux but I suppose that
there is a problem with updmap.  When I run

  getnonfreefonts --sys --refreshmap

the very first time I get

  Installing 'ua1.map'...Creating new config file /xopt/texlive/2020/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
                                     [done]
  Installing 'classico.map'...                                [done]
  Installing 'dayroman.map'...                                [done]

which means that the file in texmf-config is successfully created.

Norbert, do you have a clue?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Folks,

After Reinhard's message, I decided to bite the bullet and try myself. Below is EXACTLY what I did, copied from a Terminal session.

Made a new home directory called "freefonts" and cd to it.

curl --remote-name https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts <https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts>
sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts

sudo getnonfreefonts --sys --help

(This gave appropriate information.)

sudo getnonfreefonts --sys --refreshmap

(This gave a little information with no error.)

sudo getnonfreefonts --sys --all

(This downloaded and installed quite a few fonts. There were no errors and only minor warnings, all the same, and I'll show the last one and the end of the install:)

Howdy,

The man page for getnonfreefonts is at <https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/getnonfreefonts.1.html>.

Note that Dick Koch used the recommended installation method using the --sys option.

I'm not sure what option is assumed if none is chosen but it may be defaulted to --user. If that is the case you shouldn't use `sudo` and even if you use the --sys option later it won't work since the fonts will be in your personal texmf folder and the map file will be in your personal texlive tree (~/Library/texlive/YEAR/texmf-var/web2c) which will override the system-wide version.

Good Luck,

$ getnonfreefonts
ERROR: You have to invoke getnonfreefonts with either --sys or --user.

In nearly all cases you should use getnonfreefonts --sys.
For special cases see

Thanks, Manfred, for the announcement of the availability of
texcol2020.iso!  It, and its checksum files, has now been mirrored to

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/Images/

I can also report that I've successfully used the ISO image to install
TL2020 today on virtual machines running these operating systems:

	* MidnightBSD 1.2
	* FreeBSD 13.0
	* OpenIndiana Hipster (OpenSolaris)
	* NetBSD 10.0
	* Ubuntu 20.04 (in progress as I write this)

The one suggestion that I'd like to make for next year's installer
script is that it not bail out if no binaries are available for the
platform.  All that it should do is turn off generation of *.fmt
files.  

To get around that flaw, on 3 of the above 5, I arbitrarily chose one
set of binaries that I later deleted, installing instead a suitable
package from

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/bin

Hi List,

I have a somewhat odd request for advice, which I hope can be solved here.

I'm writing a large, multi-part document with Lyx. One part of it (in its
own separate child document) I want to encrypt. There are, however, some
factors to consider:

1) I want the encryption and decryption to be possible without resorting to
a computer program, and to be secure. So far, the only method I've found
for this is the Solitaire Cipher, described here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_(cipher). That is, I want somebody
equipped only with a printout of the encrypted file, a notepad (which can
be computer), and analog tools, to be able to decrypt the document.

2) however, the document includes footnotes, citations, and formatting. The
Solitaire Cipher only works with letters, so I have two issues: a) the
plaintext should have as little formatting as possible, so that it can be
output in a format that can easily be compiled into something matching the
rest of the document. I've thought markdown might work for this, but then:
b) I'd need to adapt the Solitaire Cipher in a way that can manage markdown
markings. Would converting everything to UTF-8 hex encoding make this
easier? Is there some other way? Is there some document format that can
compile into a pdf output including sections, headers, footnotes,
citations, etc., all without assuming the user has any particular software
on their machine? (without, of course, asking them to decrypt 20 pages of
raw pdf data)

3) page numbers and footnotes are numbered continuously, which means I'd
need to force the next child document after the encrypted one to start both
at specific numbers. Page numbering might not be an issue if the encrypted
text is included as a child document, but footnotes and cross-references
pointing toward the ciphertext would need to be tweaked. How would I do
this?

I realize this is something of an odd request. Please don't ask why I'm
doing this (the answer will be "because Reasons?"). Is there a way to
achieve what I'm trying to achieve?

Thanks for the help,

Checksum errors when installing texlive on 64-bit windows 10 release
1909:

Installing to: C:/texlive/2020
Installing [01/64, time/total: ??:??/??:??]: texlive.infra [221k]

This happend both on a virtual and on a bare-metal fully-updated windows.

Installing on Ubuntu 18.04 gave no such problems, and neither did installing on windows from my final rsync copy of tlpretest.

Also: Manfred, can you change my email-addres into siepo at bitmuis.nl ?

Can you copy the file
	archive/texlive.infra.tar.xz
to some place on the HD, and run sh512sum on it? Is the one computed
from the actual file really different from what is written in the TLPDB?

That would be really bad.

Thanks for testing!!!

youllprobablyhavenoticedthatrestrictingtotwentysixlettersmightalreadybeq
uitedifficulttodealwith. But the algorithm does not rely on the alphabet
having exactly 26 letters. Either squeeze a ?Base26? encoding in
between, or increase your deck size to include happy things like spaces,
punctuation, capital letters, numbers, \, {, }, *, #, ?

Also let me quote the wobsite you referred to: ?Since its creation,
analysis has revealed flaws in the cipher. It is now considered
insecure.?
It's your decision to long-term rely on such algorithms. Paper doesn't
blush.

HTML? You could replace any non-ASCII letter with the corresponding
&xCodepoint; to keep encoding overhead minimal. Use your web browser (or
its print function) to create human-readable structured text.

However, it is not entirely clear if you want the typesetting system to
allocate syntactic structural information (page/footnote numbering etc.)
for you. This case be tricky, since then you are leaving the realm of
pure semantics (plain text) and your intermediate format has to include
typesetting mark-up commands, that are notoriously difficult to display
in a human-readable way (cf. PostScript, Knuth TeX, or the whole point
of a type setter's apprenticeship).

You aim on having references to the encrypted sub-document within the
human-readable portion of the document? Besides being bad style, this
also reveals (meta)information on what is encrypted, hence weakens the
encryption level.
If you want your document to be fundamentally safe against crypto
attacks, I recommend to resort to well-proven techniques like EBCDIC.

Aaah, you are the one holding copyright on ?Reasons? (-:

Maybe. I'm just unsure if a list for infrastructure organisation on
typographical nitpicking is the best place to find it.

The same happens to me. I've reinstalled Windows a few

Come to think of it, a tarot deck has 78 cards, but I'm not sure what the
encoding would be (and it only has one "joker": The Fool).

Fair point. Following advice from the list, I wrote Schneier directly.
You're probably correct below, that this might not ve the appropriate venue
for this question.

At this point im thinking that page numbers can be manages by treating the
encrypted text as an embedded multipage pdf, and then fixing footnote
numbers from the output before encryption.

The references are purely numerical (as in "see note X") so they don't
expose any additional info beyond what's already exposed by continuous
numbering.

I'll look it up. Thanks for the tip!

Indeed. But you've already given some good tips. I figured the overlap

Dear all,

installation using the ISO image went smoothly on a rather old Ubuntu
14.04 today.

Testing on other platforms will be difficult for me this year as I work
from home at the moment.

here some testing info, not for TeX Collection but for pretest network install (sorry).

1) when I read the pretest info from "tlmgr update" some time ago (install-tl is dated March 7), I installed on openSUSE tumbleweed:
installation worked fine, some basic latex documents worked (no context test so far).

today I found some time to test netinstall on two company's ubuntu 18.04 LTS machines (my notebook and server): install on notebook went fine.

BUT #1: latex support doxygen output is still broken since januar 2019 (ok, mostly a CTAN problem I guess):
    	https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/6769

BUT #2: installation on server "failed" somewhat, because there is a 30 seconds timeout trying to connect to a local strange (home grown) web proxy written in python.
only after 30 secs, the fallback to wget works fine.  4000 packages * 30secs timeout == 2000+ h installtime, that's no fun;)
using option "-no-persistent-downloads" as workaround then worked.

what's intertesting here is that 'tlmgr update' for tl2019 just works fine with that same proxy/server!

are tlmgr and install-tl using mostly the same web-access code,
and if yes, did anything change here between 2019 and 2020 ?
right now there are no new packages in pretest-2020 to test 'tlmgr update' here (will try next week...)

that python proxy so far worked quite flawlessly with *many* external sites and internal tools,
this is the first "web client" which failed so far.

I've filed an internal bug report for that proxy thing with cut'n'paste script how to install tl-2020, let's see;)


if you have any idea what to test from tl-2020 side to understand/fix this issue,
I'm happy do help testing (to run debug scripts, I have no perl knowledge so debugging just myself is "hard" == mostly impossible;)



will try to do some install test with the TeX Collection iso image "RSN"...

Protext on 64-bit windows 10: both single-user- and admin installs
ok.

One suggestion for next time: try to move all the .pyd- and .dll
files in the setup directory to subdirectories.

proTeXt on Windows10 and TeXLive on Debian 10.3 (both 64 Bit) worked well

Manfred,

I have completed testing the DVD on the Macintosh.This testing revealed two problems with the original MacTeX.iso, and a new version is ready for you to download and place on the DVD.

I installed on

	Catalina, macOS 10.15-5 Beta 1
	Mohave, macOS 10.14.6
	High Sierra, macOS 10.13.6
	Sierra, macOS 10.12.6

I'll explain the problems for everyone else. MacTeX supports the three latest versions of macOS, so in 2020 we support Catalina, Mohave, High Sierra. However Mojca Miklavec compiles legacy binaries for earlier Mac systems, and those binaries are also on the DVD. We use the Unix install script on the DVD, so we can support versions of macOS as old as 10.6.

After running the Unix install script, we ask users to install a very small TeXDist package which automatically sets up a symbolic link to the binaries. This package has to know about the two sets of binaries, pointing to one set on High Sierra and above, and the other set on Sierra and below. Sadly, the script doing this had a less than sign in a spot where it should have had a less than or equal sign, so the package failed on Sierra, but no other system. This is now fixed. Always test edge cases.

To do the Unix install, we ask users to copy four lines from a document and glue them into Terminal, which runs the commands in a shell. The first of these four commands is

	bash

because bash is the default shell on the Mac. We do this because some users may have switched to a different shell and the following commands might then fail.

But on Catalina, the default command is zsh, and when the user types "bash" the Mac responds with a notice that the default shell has changed and an explanation of how to reconfigure for the new shell.
Users should just ignore this, of course.

The Unix installer than starts Tk and Apple immediately displays another warning: ""DEPRECATION WARNING: The system version of Tk is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Please do not rely on it. Set TK_SILENCE_DEPRECATION=1 to suppress this warning." Users should also ignore this, of course.

So we added a paragraph to the install instructions telling Catalina users that they will see these warnings and should just ignore them.

Thanks for putting up with us!

Richard Koch

both worked without any issues.

Just for interest I tested texlive for Windows. I am running Windows10
(32Bit on a x64 based processor) in a? virtual machine on macOS.
I mounted the iso as optical drive D: and then started install-tl-windows
and had a problem:

Installing to: C:/texlive/2020
D:/texlive/install-tl: mkdir(C:/texlive/2020/) failed for tree
C:/texlive/2020: Permission denied at D:/texlive/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm
line 937, <STDIN> line 96.


Running the setup programm for proTeXt is no problem.

Herbert

Subject: texhash
Message-ID: <87o8s6qksg.fsf@yandex.com>

Hello,

I have installed texlive2019 on a linux (Debian), as a local user, and
all appears well. I am a little puzzled however by the installation
and by the output of running texhash. This is compared to my previous
texlive, which was texlive2013, installed as root, and also on a Debian
linux system.

1. The TEXMFVAR (~/.texlive2019/texmf-var), TEXMFCONFIG
(~/.texlive2019/texmf-config) TEXMFHOME (~/texmf) were not created
automatically during installation.

2. texhash <RET> does not update TEXMFHOME (~/texmf). I presumably have
to specify manually the directory on running texhash?

I seem to remember 1. and 2. did not occur when installing texlive2013
as root. Am I wrong here?

Best wishes,

Colin.

TEXMFVAR and TEXMFCONFIG will be created automatically as needed.

By default, TeX file searching will not expect a filename database
for TEXMFHOME. It is a matter of balancing the hassle of maintaining
a filename database for the tree versus the extra time needed for
finding files in this tree without such a database. If this tree is
small, as will usually be the case, not having such a database is
the better option.

Interesting. This explains why the files in my TEXMFHOME are found even
without a ls-R in the directory. It probably helps that I have made the
sub-directories in TEXMFHOME follow the usual names and structure:
bibtex/, doc/ dvips/ fonts/ etc.

Thanks again.

Best wishes, Colin.

Hi,

the SDAPS package contains sdapscode128.tex (a barcode generator). It
seems that this is currently installed into the docs directory though.
I guess \.tex should be added to the regular expression in ctan2tds.

If you think there is may be something wrong with the package on CTAN,
then I am happy to look into fixing that.

Hi Benjamin,

    the SDAPS package contains sdapscode128.tex (a barcode generator). 

Thanks. clearly I didn't notice that when I imported the package,
unfortunately.  I'll update it after the release. --all the best, karl.

Message-ID: <3b9d6091-6435-4626-9a96-3ef118c22d0e@www.fastmail.com>

I am getting an error on many tlmgr operations. For example,

> $ tlmgr update --list
> 
> /Library/TeX/texbin/tlmgr: unexpected return value from verify_checksum: -5

The same error occurs on 

$ tlmgr update --self
$ tlmgr install <package>
etc.

The only info I could find was this thread <https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-February/044766.html> from February, which suggests that the error is connected to the public key for the tlcontrib repository being expired. However, I have never interacted with tlcontrib or other repositories than main:

> $ tlmgr repository list
> List of repositories (with tags if set):
> http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet (main)

Any suggestions?

Thank you,

Hi,

quick update: today I tried "tlmgr update" with the new 2020 installation,
and tlmgr *does* show the same problem with that specific web proxy!

so something changed in the perl code how to acceess web files through a proxy between tl 2019 and 2020,
all updates will suck in such a configuration:-(


how can I help debugging/understanding why now I need "-no-persistent-downloads" for the very first time,
why all other tools/programs do not show similar issues ?


thanks for any hint/help,

Harald

Can you test **two** things please:
- first, fix the typo in TLDownload.pm
--- a/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLDownload.pm
+++ b/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLDownload.pm
@@ -61,7 +61,7 @@ sub reinit
   $self->{'ua'} = $ua;
   $self->{'enabled'} = 1;
   $self->{'errorcount'} = 0;
-  $self->{'initcout'} += 1;
+  $self->{'initcount'} += 1;
 }
 sub enabled
 {

if that helps, hurray!

- if that does NOT help, undo the above fix and revert the change
by patch -R -ing the attached patch. 
This was the **only** changes since 2016 we did wrt downloading.
If it works after this change, then less yeah, and we need to look into
what happened.


Please let us know the outcome.

Best

Norbert

Hi Jack,

Indeed, the gpg key for the main TL19 repository expired yesterday :(.
The TL20 release will have an updated key.

There have been no updates to TL19 for some weeks, and won't be any in
the future.  If you want/need to run tlmgr from TL19 anyway, e.g.,
because there are some older updates you didn't previously get, you can
tell it to skip verification with tlmgr --verify-repo=none.

Also, I believe Norbert reworked the verification code (in tlmgr 54118,
7mar20) so that it both gives a more comprehensible error message and
continues anyway in the case of an expired key, precisely for this case.

Hope this helps somehow,
Karl

But I don't think so. My guess now is the following:
- before the update, if LWP once failed, it was disabled and from then
  on wget was used
- your proxy does not work with LWP, thus after a one-time failure wget
  was used and everything was fine
- the new code re-enables LWP (since it it much faster then wget), as it
  often happens that after a few hundred packages the connection
  breaks/is terminated, and re-enabling it helps a lot
- this now means that timeouts happen for each and every package
- in fact, it should only happen 10 times (max re-enable number)
- but the bug (see above) effectively disabled the max-reenable count,
  so LWP was re-enabled for each and every package

Solutions for you:
- use the above patch and after 10 package failures it should switch
  permanently to wget
- use --disable-persistent-connection
- set TEXLIVE_DOWNLOADER=wget in the environment

> - if that does NOT help, undo the above fix and revert the change
> by patch -R -ing the attached patch. 

Reverting the attached change will work as before, that is disabling LWP
once and for all, and switch to wget. Which we don't want to have as
default.

Hi Jack, hi all,

Yes, that was somehow a bad timing.

Yes.

That is true, but you need to update with the latest
	tlmgr-update-latest.sh
from tlnet to get this changes. It seems that you haven't done an update
for some time, and now it is in the old stage with the bug, and expired
key.

Here, with TL2019 final, I see:
$ tlmgr update --repo ~/public_html/tlnet --list
TeX Live 2019 is frozen forever and will no
longer be updated.  This happens in preparation for a new release.

If you're interested in helping to pretest the new release (when
pretests are available), please read https://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.
Otherwise, just wait, and the new release will be ready in due time.
tlmgr: package repository /home/norbert/public_html/tlnet (not verified: valid signature with expired key)
tlmgr: would save backups to /home/norbert/tl/2019/tlpkg/backups
update:   tex4ht             [949k]: local:    53966, source:    54213
$

And update works

Best

Norbert

I also retested setup/texcollection.exe, on 64-bit windows 7, I got
a message about a missing dll:

The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-conio-l1-0.dll is
missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this
problem.

And when closing this message box:

Error loading Python DLL 'D:\setup\python3.8.dll'.
LoadLibrary: The specified module could not be found.

Ths latter error message is probably a consequence of the previous
error.

On Windows 10 this did not happen, presumably because this windows
version already contains this dll.

With TL, we ran into such a problem two or three years ago,and had
to add maybe six api-ms-win-* dlls (on top of the ones that were
already added) to make it work on older windows versions.

Protext/setup.exe worked ok on w7 and w8.

Notes/comments in real time as I encounter them :

  1.  No obvious way of launching the installer when the ISO is mounted rather than burned; I had to inspect the contents of "Autorun.inf" to find out what it might have done had it been burned to a physical disc

  2.  So launched "setup\texcollection.exe" as Administrator (I do not want arbitrary users to be able to modify the installation, even though I am normally the sole user of this particular machine), customised the installation (see attached) but found when trying to capture the customisation that when the "TeX Live 2020 Installer" window has focus, both "Print Screen" and "Control Print Screen" are ignored ? I had to diver focus to the desktop.

  3.  Installation commenced circa 18:35

  4.  At 19:35, current = "ffslides"

  5.  At 20:35, current = "mnsymbol"

  6.  By 22:35, finished (apparently with complete success, tho' as-yet untested).

But one part puzzles me ? the very final part of the log reads :

 The following environment variables contain the string "tex"
 (case-independent).  If you're doing anything but adding personal
 directories to the system paths, they may well cause trouble somewhere
 while running TeX.  If you encounter problems, try unsetting them.
 Please ignore spurious matches unrelated to TeX.

    WISH="V:\texlive\tlpkg\tltcl\bin\wish.exe"
yet there is no environment variable "WISH" (I have checked), and I have no idea what V:\texlive\tlpkg\tltcl\bin\wish.exe does.  Running it tells me "couldn't read file 'does': no such file or directory" (quotes around "does" inverted to allow outer double quotes).

wish.exe is the graphical script interpreter for the gui front ends.
In some future update of the installer we shall suppress this
message.

Apparently, you typed 'V:\texlive\tlpkg\tltcl\bin\wish.exe does' and
then wish does indeed look for a file 'does'.

I cannot reproduce this. The message means the the tlmgr backend
quit.

But I guess many users will have this dll already from installing
other software. E.g., Phil Taylor's screenshot shows a successfully
started texcollection.exe on windows 7.

But I guess many users will have this dll already from installing
other software. E.g., Phil Taylor's screenshot shows a successfully
started texcollection.exe on windows 7.

Thank you Siep.  I can now report that (a) this occurs from the version of TLSHELL launched from the TeX Live 2020 "Start" menu as well as from the version launched from the generic CMD prompt, and that (b) it occurs as a result of "File / Load repository".  I should add that I get a UAC promt when I attempt to start TLSHELL, which is as intended; I always work as a normal mortal, and always install things using "Run as administrator".  What debugging options are there for TLSHELL ?

I naively thought that Windows 7 is something from the past, and no
longer supported by Microsoft.

So, should (must) texlive support Windows 7 officially?

As far as I am concerned: we support it as long as it is not too
much trouble, since it is still used by a lot of people.

I ran into this problem because my windows test machines are
extremely barebones virtual machines with no software installed
beyond qemu and spice guest tools, and therefore no optional
redistributable dlls. As I wrote, many w7 users may not run into it.

Anyhow, w7 users have the workaround option to run protext/setup or
texlive/install-tl-windows directly.

So it is fine with me if you decide to go ahead anyway.

Whilst Microsoft were rather more successful than many of us anticipated in panicking Windows 7 users into downgrading to Windows 10, there is a very substantial hard core (clearly including myself, on almost ten machines) who flatly refuse to dowgrade.  The latest statistics suggest that over 20% of the Microsoft installations still run Windows 7.  Policy is nothing to do with me, and whether or not TeX Live should/must support Windows 7 is not for me to say, but I do believe that if Windows 7 were not supported then that would be an error of judgement, and a great dis-service to a very large number of extant TeX users.

Unless/until Microsoft drop the tablet-mentality "tiles/panes" user interface and replace it with something more professional, in Windows 10 and/or one of its successors, I for one will not consider downgrading.  Indeed, when I purchased my most recent machine (a Fujitsu Celsius with i7 processor), I deliberately chose one with an older processor so that I could continue to perform Windows 7 upgrades without hacking the O/S; Windows 7 upgrades are no longer offered to hoi polloi, so these days I could buy a more modern processor without loss of functionality, but I would never consider a machine that would not support Windows 7.

I forgot that it is also a w8 problem, which somewhat weakens the
case for ignoring. But still there is a workaround, and most w8
users will have moved to w10.

What debugging options are there for TLSHELL ?

tlmgr has debug options: run e.g.

tlmgr -v <some command>

As to available commands, see doc.html in the installation root,
which has a link to tlmgr documentation (texlive.infra package).

[PT] What debugging options are there for TLSHELL ?


tlmgr has debug options: run e.g.

tlmgr -v <some command>

As to available commands, see doc.html in the installation root,
which has a link to tlmgr documentation (texlive.infra package).



Confused, Siep.  The TeX Live 2020 "Start" menu offers me (amongst other options) "TeX Live Manager", but when I launch that option I am not taken to "tlmgr" but to "C:\TeX\Live\2020\bin\win32\tlshell.exe", so it isn't clear to me how debugging options for "tlmgr" are applicable.  Can you clarify, please ?

Also I can confirm that the situation still obtains after a re-boot.

I was just asking. I am not the guy to decide anything regarding
texlive. This is Karl and team.

Honestly, it sounds ok (and good) to me to say "we support is as long
as it is not too much trouble...".

Yeah, as said this is Karl and team to decide if resp. what to do.

Tlmgr is the back end of tlshell. You wrote that tlmgr did nothing
useful, so you should look first at tlmgr.

I understand why you prefer W7. I also don't like these 'tiles/panes'
things for everything.

But I have nothing to complain as I am a privileged person being able
to avoid Windows all together. Even in my company I am a happy Linux
user.

Ah, no, I think you misunderstood (or I explained myself badly).  I am not in the least concerned that neither "tlmgr" nor "tlmgr --gui" did anything useful, since they are not exposed in the "Start" menu and I was simply seeking some way to attempt an upgrade after initial install.  My concern is solely that "tlshell.exe" dies on trying to load a remote repository, since it is to "tlshell" that the TeX Live 2020 "Start" menu links, and therefore "tlshell" which will be the utility that 99.9% of Windows TeX Live / Collection users will use.

So, what I am seeking is specifically information on what debugging options are available for "tlshell.exe" (qua "tlshell.exe") rather than "tlmgr".

However, I thought that I should at least give "tlmgr" another try, so I consulted the embedded "help" and learned :

--gui [action]

    Two notable GUI front-ends for "tlmgr", "tlshell" and "tlcockpit",
    are started up as separate programs; see their own documentation.

    "tlmgr" itself has a graphical interface as well as the command line
    interface. You can give the option to invoke it, "--gui", together
    with an action to be brought directly into the respective screen of
    the GUI. For example, running

      tlmgr --gui update

    starts you directly at the update screen.

So, I tried "tlmgr --gui update" and was told :

C:\Users\Philip Taylor>tlmgr --gui update
Please use tlshell as a GUI for tlmgr

No further forward.

So I tried "tlcockpit".  It had not died, but on selecting the "Updates" tab, it just sits there with a spinning radial grey clock-face, and I am told "Tlmgr status:   Busy   [update --list]".

I am not in the least concerned that neither "tlmgr" nor "tlmgr --gui" did anything useful, since they are not exposed in the "Start" menu and I was simply seeking some way to attempt an upgrade after initial install.  My concern is solely that "tlshell.exe" dies on trying to load a remote repository, since it is to "tlshell" that the TeX Live 2020 "Start" menu links, and therefore "tlshell" which will be the utility that 99.9% of Windows TeX Live / Collection users will use.

Right now you cannot upgrade from a dvd install, since the regular
mirrors are still for TL2019. When tlshell fails to connect to a
repository, there should be a popup window to give you the chance to
abort or pick another repository.

There is a problem, in particular on w7, that windows often fail to
come to the foreground; in such a case you have to select it from
the taskbar instead. But this does not explain your exact problem.

In my tests, I have no problem loading the dvd as repository.

Ah, so there is no point in attempting an upgrade then.  OK, in that case I will try again once the regular mirrors are for TL2020.  I will look for an extra taskbar item, but not report back unless I find one.  "tlcockpit" is still spinning like a top ...

None found, see attached screenshot.  And the problem with being unable to take a screen-shot when any of the "tlshell" windows has focus still obtains.

Good morning Nornert, copy all -


"tlcockpit" is still spinning like a top ...



I cannot reproduce this unless you are having a strange tlmgr setup.

Could you open cmd shell with the installed tlmgr available, and type in
        tlmgr repository
followed by
        tlmgr update --list
and send the output?

Nat?rlich ...

C:\Users\Philip Taylor>tlmgr repository
List of repositories (with tags if set):
        http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet (main)

C:\Users\Philip Taylor>tlmgr update --list

tlmgr.pl: The TeX Live versions supported by the repository
http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
  (2016--2019)
do not include the version of the local installation
  (2020).

C:\Users\Philip Taylor>


Here I have no problems (well, some strange ones, but then, it is JVM,
which is stupid) wrt loading repositories and displaying updates.

Norbert

PS: Ahh, and last but not least, it would have been nice to have this
kind of testing **before** we make the final iso image ...

If you remember, I did report problems [1, 2, 3, ..., 13] almost as soon as the first pre-test of TeX Live 2020 was announced, but they were never resolved and I was therefore unable to test further.  This more recent bout of testing is not of TeX Live per se, but rather of the more recently announced TeX Collection.

Hi Phil,

If you have pretest installed, it is frozen and will not bei updated. If
the forecast is still correct, from tomorrow on there should be updates
possible trom the normal mirror, maybe there is a delay of some days. I
have the same error when I changed the repository from pretest to
ctan-mirrors. Some patience is required in the times of release of a new
version I think.

Subject: microscopic fonts in TL guis
Message-ID: <20200408141502.GA15360@jdiamond-mb.acadiau.ca>

Hi,

I normally (i.e., since forever) use the terminal interface to tlmgr,
but all this gooey talk got me a bit intrigued.

I have tried tlcockpit, tlmgr --gui and tlshell and I get GUIs with
fonts whose capital letters are about 4 (TeX) points high.  While I
appreciate efficient use of space as much as the next guy (maybe even
more), without hacking the code is there any way to get any GUI at a
larger size?

I am using a 4K monitor with about 163 dpi; do all the GUIs assume
there are 96 pixels to the inch, or make some similar error?

Cheers.
                                Jim

Hi,

my experience with SW written in ParlTk is that it (at least on my
computers) often starts with such tiny fonts. I am not an expert but
it helps if I use this command-line option:

-font 'Helvetica,24'

I tried different numbers and 24 looks well on my computer, you shoud
experiment with it. And this is not related to tlmgr --gui, this was
an experiment with a PerlTk program written by me. Maybe someone comes
with a better method.

Thanks Zdenek, that does the trick with tlmgr.  And *now* I see that
option on page 28 of the tlmgr doc (mea culpa).

I had looked at "texdoc tlshell" and "texdoc tlcockpit" and neither
give any enlightenment about fonts.  Obviously I gave up too quickly.

This solution doesn't work for tlshell or tlcockpit.  Norbert and
Siep: any similar option(s) there?  If so, what do you think about adding
them to the texdoc info?

Cheers.

I have an install from the first texcol2020.iso, but now set repository to
the new ISO (loop mount).

 C:\Users\gwhite>tlmgr repository
List of repositories (with tags if set):
        e:/texlive (main)

C:\Users\gwhite>tlmgr update --list
tlmgr.pl: package repository e:/texlive (not verified: gpg unavailable)
===============================================================================
tlmgr itself needs to be updated.
Please do this via either
  tlmgr update --self
or by getting the latest updater for Unix-ish systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh
and/or Windows systems:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe
Then continue with other updates as usual.
===============================================================================
tlmgr.pl: would save backups to C:/texlive/2020/tlpkg/backups
update:   texlive.infra      [420k]: local:    54553, source:    54630

update:   texlive-scripts    [344k]: local:    54612, source:    54624



I next ran tlshell and asked it to update tlmgr:

tlmgr.pl: package repository e:/texlive (not verified: gpg unavailable)
tlmgr.pl: saving backups to C:/texlive/2020/tlpkg/backups
tlmgr.pl: Preparing TeX Live infrastructure update...
tlmgr.pl: Backup option not implemented for infrastructure update.

TeX Live infrastructure update in progress ...

failed self update: texlive.infra (54553 -> 54630)
Rolling back to previous version ...
self restore: texlive.infra (54553)
Infrastructure update failed. Previous version has been restored.


I was able to update via command-line from a local mirror of the pretest
site (hosted on a linux box).
After that, regular installs worked using the ISO via Windows loop mount.

I cannot reproduce this unless you are having a strange tlmgr setup.

Hi Phil,

> "tlcockpit" is still spinning like a top ...

I cannot reproduce this unless you are having a strange tlmgr setup.

Could you open cmd shell with the installed tlmgr available, and type in
	tlmgr repository
followed by
	tlmgr update --list
and send the output?

Here I have no problems (well, some strange ones, but then, it is JVM,
which is stupid) wrt loading repositories and displaying updates.

Best

Norbert

Ok, indeed, tlcockpit doesn't like this output, and probably tlshell
neither. In machine-readable mode this looks like:

$ tlmgr shell --machine-readable --repository ctan
protocol 1
tlmgr>
load local
OK
tlmgr>
load remote
start load http://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet
fail load http://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet

tlmgr: The TeX Live versions supported by the repository
http://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet
  (2016--2019)
do not include the version of the local installation
  (2020).
$

Which kills tlmgr, which is not good ... thus tlshell complains, as well
es tlcockpit.

I need to fix this on the tlmgr side, but this will be done after the
release.

If you fix the repository to one of the pretest mirrors, then it should
work.

Best

Norbert

tlshell defines all its fonts with respect to whatever tcl/tk
considers the default. But after the release I'll see whether I can
make it configurable.

I have not looked into tlshell but what I gave in my previous answer
is a Tk option. In PerlTk you have to do the following:

our $mw = new MainWindow( ... );
$mw->CmdLine;

The CmdLine is the magic which gets Tk related options from the
command line. Maybe the default font size can be set somewhere but I
did not manage.

Me belonging to 'and team', I would be inclined to go ahead, since
the problem will probably impact only few users.

I am not really happy about it, but a new iso would be an
opportunity for new bugs to creep in, with not many people willing
to test this third iteration. But the final decision lies with Karl.

tlcockpit relies on JavaFX, and that is unfortunately a messy thing.
See https://github.com/TeX-Live/tlcockpit/issues/3

It should be fixed automatically in newer JDK (which Java are you
using?)

You can fix it *probably* by doing
	GDK_SCALE=2 tlcockpit

Just received this very timely update from Malwarebytes :

Windows 7 user base

Currently over 23 percent of Windows users worldwide<https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide> are still on Windows 7, and only 69 percent have already switched to Windows 10. The rest are using the less popular Windows 8 or versions of Windows that have gone EOL long before Windows 7.

Oddly enough, the percentage of Windows 7 users has hardly decreased after reaching the EOL date in January (from roughly 24 percent to 23 percent). With this huge amount of potentially unpatched systems still active in the market, any exploitable vulnerability will result in a widespread disaster.

Would WannaCry have had such an enormous impact if Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 had been abandoned before it spread? We will never know. What we do know that Windows 8 and 10 did not need to be patched for the vulnerability that was used to spread WannaCry<https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/05/how-did-wannacry-ransomworm-spread/>. They were not contributing to the choir of systems trying to infect their neighbors. Emergency patches were released for several older Windows versions, including Windows 7. At the time, Windows 7 was still supported.

Could it be that your wget and wgetrc are simply hosed?

BTW, this repeats every year, most of the time it is one of your
particularly strange settings ... ;-)

What about running
	tlmgr -v --repository https://texlive.info/tlpretest/ update --list
Mind the "-v" and see what is shown?

Thanks for the suggestion.  However, as it turns out, I already have
GDK_SCALE=2 in my environment.

That is strange... but not completely unexpected.
Which Java Version do you have installed?

Well, actually the output is not a problem, only that tlmgr dies ;-)

Fixed in my code, will be in the first tlmgr update after release.

Hi,

I do not have TL 2020 so far, I have just tried tlcockpit from TL 2019. It says:

Running on Java Version 1.8.0_131

I do not have GDK_SCALE set. In fact, I run KDE Plasma. I do not have
Gnome, I only have the GTK libraries installed because gimp and a few
other apps need them. I see the fonts in a reasonable size. It can
depend on setting the resolution of the screen. I have a correct
setting in my system.

Not ignoring your e-mail, Norbet, but as you will see from the above, continuing this thread from my university account is becoming impossible because all embedded links are forcibly mutated into something totally impenetrable.  I have subcribed from a different mailbox, but my test message has not yet appear - when it does, I will continue this thread.  Just one brief comment :


SYSTEM_WGETRC = c:/progra~1/wget/etc/wgetrc
syswgetrc = C:\Program files (x86)\GnuWin32/etc/wgetrc
SYSTEM_WGETRC = c:/progra~1/wget/etc/wgetrc
syswgetrc = C:\Program files (x86)\GnuWin32/etc/wgetrc


Could it be that your wget and wgetrc are simply hosed?

I think not.  I use "wget" on a daily basis, including fetching the last 10% of the TeX Collection ISO, and my "wgetrc" has only one non-comment line :

waitretry = 10

Oh, and


SYSTEM_WGETRC = c:/progra~1/wget/etc/wgetrc
SYSTEM_WGETRC = c:/progra~1/wget/etc/wgetrc

do not exist, so no idea why they were reported.

Trying to continue the dialogue with Norbert from my Royal Holloway a/c is proving impossible ? the university has elected to have all e-mails intercepted by Microsoft and all URLs mutated into something totally impenetrable, which not only causes my browser to report a probable phishing attempt every time that I click on a link, it also makes messages impossibly verbose.? I am therefore testing whether I can post to this list from a private e-mail address using my own SMTP relay, and which takes all replies via Gmail.

Just to demonstrate the impossibility of understanding e-mails via my university a/c, I append the most recent.? If this test is successful, all subsequent messages from me to this list (and analogous lists) will come from this account, which will also avoid the equally unpleasant forced insertion of [EXT] into all received subject lines.

Incidentally, I cannot find the "texcollection" list at https://tug.org/mailman/listinfo, so do not know how to subscribe to it, nor whether this message will reach it.

"Correct" setting seems to be in the eye of the beholder.

I think "correct" means "if the screen is physically X DPI, then X
should report X".  Other people seem to think "correct" means "96,
regardless of what reality is".

I consider the latter to be a horrible kludge which has become popular
because it is expedient, but YMMV.

Blame not the kludgers, Jim, blame the CSS Working Group who defined the CSS reference pixel to be the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96 DPI and a distance from the reader of an arm?s length. (for the British Standard Arm, clearly: see BS 31415 (1899), as amended).

Yes, CSS using pixels (no matter whether based on 96 or even older 72)
is wrong. When setting the properties of my monitor I took its size in
pixels and inches and calculated the resolution. Java apparently takes
the value from my system settings and font size is defined in
tlcockpit in typographical units, not in pixels, but Tk uses its own
strange value.

Philip, thanks for the link.

This statement "a CSS pixel will be displayed in different physical
dimensions but it will always be displayed in the correct size in
which the viewer will find comfortable." reminds me of the Olympic
champion level of pretentiousness as found in a book on UI design by
Apple I read a long time ago.  (Apple's viewpoint, at least at the
time, was essentially "we are right, anyone who disagrees is clearly
wrong".)  What a pile of rubbish.

Displaying things at a comfortable size for people to read is a
laudable goal.  Refining what an inch is, not so much.  This strikes
me as a poor solution to avoid harder thinking.

Having said that, CSS applies to web browsers, but what Java GUIs are
doing has always been something of a mystery to me.

I've been working on a QT5 app on and off for the last few months.
The Qt people have added fuel to the fire by displaying things
differently on different OSes.  Thus trying to develop some code which
works well on Linux, macos and MSWindows adds an extra level of
frustration.

Cheers.
                                Jim

Ooops,  Yes you are right.  It has an extra factor of "g" in it that should have been canceled out.  We found it yesterday and I had thought it was fixed but it looks like the fixer didn't get to it. 

To get the answer it expects you can just multiply yours by g and it should mark it right.  

Likely we will give full credit for that part since this happened.

    "Correct" setting seems to be in the eye of the beholder.
    
    I think "correct" means "if the screen is physically X DPI, then X
    should report X".  Other people seem to think "correct" means "96,
    regardless of what reality is".
    
    I consider the latter to be a horrible kludge which has become popular

    Blame not the kludgers, Jim, blame the CSS Working Group who defined the CSS reference pixel to be the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96 DPI and a distance from the reader of an arm?s length. (for the British Standard Arm, clearly: see BS 31415 (1899), as amended).

        "Correct" setting seems to be in the eye of the beholder.
        
        I think "correct" means "if the screen is physically X DPI, then X
        should report X".  Other people seem to think "correct" means "96,
        regardless of what reality is".
        
        I consider the latter to be a horrible kludge which has become popular
        because it is expedient, but YMMV.
        
        Cheers.

        Blame not the kludgers, Jim, blame the CSS Working Group who defined the CSS reference pixel to be the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96 DPI and a distance from the reader of an arm?s length. (for the British Standard Arm, clearly: see BS 31415 (1899), as amended).

        Yes, CSS using pixels (no matter whether based on 96 or even older 72)
        is wrong. When setting the properties of my monitor I took its size in
        pixels and inches and calculated the resolution. Java apparently takes
        the value from my system settings and font size is defined in
        tlcockpit in typographical units, not in pixels, but Tk uses its own
        strange value.

        Philip, thanks for the link.
        
        This statement "a CSS pixel will be displayed in different physical
        dimensions but it will always be displayed in the correct size in
        which the viewer will find comfortable." reminds me of the Olympic
        champion level of pretentiousness as found in a book on UI design by
        Apple I read a long time ago.  (Apple's viewpoint, at least at the
        time, was essentially "we are right, anyone who disagrees is clearly
        wrong".)  What a pile of rubbish.
        
        Displaying things at a comfortable size for people to read is a
        laudable goal.  Refining what an inch is, not so much.  This strikes
        me as a poor solution to avoid harder thinking.
        
        Having said that, CSS applies to web browsers, but what Java GUIs are
        doing has always been something of a mystery to me.
        
        I've been working on a QT5 app on and off for the last few months.
        The Qt people have added fuel to the fire by displaying things
        differently on different OSes.  Thus trying to develop some code which
        works well on Linux, macos and MSWindows adds an extra level of
        frustration.
        
        Cheers.
                                        Jim

Could it be that your wget and wgetrc are simply hosed?

BTW, this repeats every year, most of the time it is one of your
particularly strange settings ... ;-)

What about running
	tlmgr -v --repositoryhttps://texlive.info/tlpretest/  update --list
Mind the "-v" and see what is shown?

Best

OK, I think I can attempt an answer to Norbert ..

No, as I wrote earlier, I used "wget" on a daily basis and in fact used it to fetch the last 10% of the TeX Colleection ISO.?? My "wgetrc" has only one non-commented line :

> waitretry = 10 

But :

>/SYSTEM_WGETRC = c:/progra~1/wget/etc/wgetrc doesn't exist. /

> BTW, this repeats every year, most of the time it is one of your

Well, with the /greatest/ respect, I don't think that this has ever been established.?? Each year you claim that it is because my setup is non-standard, each year I reply that all I am doing is using the same configuration options that I have been using (successfully !) since 2008, and that there is no point in exposing these configuration options if end-users are not intended to use them, and at that point the conversation seems to dry up ...

Stripping off all of the noise-level qualifiers and trying the simplest form of the "wget" command, I am told :

As I said, one of your "special" setups. It is a normal and valid
Let's Encrypt certificate, like billions others.

It is strange because there were several reports that it worked, and jdk
usually uses gtk, and there this should work.
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI

On the other hand, it is Java ... so not completely unexpected :-(

> java version "1.8.0_152"

Yes, not default support for HiDPI.

Well, there you go.  I over-graded to openjdk 14 and now the GUI comes
up at a reasonable size.  Thanks for the solution.  I didn't realize
my JDK was so out of date.  (I avoid Java like the plague, so ...)

Do you think it is worth putting this in the documentation for other
people running archaic versions of Java?

Cheers.

Good to hear.

Well, there is a lot of good reasons to stay with Java8, most prominent
being the change of licensing. But well, it is all very very
complicated with Oracle.

Thanks for the confirmation, I put something into the tlcockpit README.

hi there,

I know this topic has already been dealt with here
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2020-February/044766.html

However, I get the same error *without* tlcontrib in my repository list (in
the following, "sutlmgr" is just an alias for "sudo tlmgr").
How can this be fixed?

hi Norbert!

by update, do you mean
sudo sh update-tlmgr-latest.sh -- --upgrade
as recommended here https://www.tug.org/texlive/upgrade.html ?

No! No need to do --upgrade, a simple
	sudo sh update-tlmgr-latest.sh
should be enough.

The --upgrade is for cross release upgrades.

There is /nothing/ /whatsoever / to suggest that this has anything to do with my personal preferences for the location of the various TeX-MF directories, which is the only part of the installation that I modify? Everything else is out of the box.
Here is a simple console session which demonstrates that "wget" can access secure sites only if "--no-check-certificate" is specified, which is not one of the options specified in the TLMGR call thereof :

> D:downloading https://texlive.info/tlpretest//tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz using wget
> --user-agent=texlive/wget --tries=4 --timeout=30 -q -O

Is there perhaps a tacit assumption that the users "wgetrc" file will contain "--no-check-certificate" ?

Simple demo of command-line WGET to secure location without and with "--no-check-certificate" ?

Dear Philip,

In the bin directory in
CTAN/systems/win32/w32tex/context.tar.xz
there is a file curl-ca-bundle.crt.
Save this file in SOME-DIR,
and make a file wget.ini with a line

ca-certificate = SOME-DIR/curl-ca-bundle.crt

(please use forward slash as dir separators)
in the "same" directory as that for wget.exe.

Thanks,
Akira

OK, I saved it in C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/bin/, and then created "wget.ini" to contain "ca-certificate = ./curl-ca-bundle.crt", which I stored in the same directory.? That did not help, so I amended the latter to read "ca-certificate = C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuWin32/bin/curl-ca-bundle.crt" and now all works fine (at least, for the simple test ? I have yet to try TLMGR proper).

Many thanks indeed / /arigato gozaimasu/

I'm no Java expert, but I use some large Java GUI applications from
the European Space Agency.   Oracle JDK 8 has features that were
omitted from OpenJDK, so these applications currently require JRE 8.
I ran across one of these features that has appeared as a separate
package, but other components are either not available with OpenJDK
or have newer versions that the GUI apps don't yet support.   Even
experienced users of these applications struggle to get them to work
in recent linux distros.

But is this supposed to work at this stage (the script upgrade via update-tlmgr-latest.sh, as instructed at

https://tug.org/texlive/upgrade.html

)?

I have followed steps 1-8 and am getting 

--- cut here ---

Verifying archive integrity... All good.             Uncompressing TeX Live Manager Updater  100%         ./runme.sh: updating in /opt/texlive/2020...
./runme.sh: tlmgr version says this is TeX Live 2019,./runme.sh: and this updater script created: Thu Feb 27 02:37:09 CET 2020.
./runme.sh: have TL 2019, new version also 2019;     ./runme.sh: using --upgrade doesn't make sense; terminating.                                              (./runme.sh: makeself creation date = Thu Feb 27 02:37:09 CET 2020.)

--- end ---

I am sure the path points to the 2020 copy of tlmgr I made.

**DONT** use --upgrade, this is for **cross-release** upgrades.

Simply call the script, that is all.

Message-ID: <35375332618e113b1ab6125db4e28545de8b907e.camel@grimler.se>

Dear all,

In ftp.tug.org/texlive/historic/2020/ the tlpdb archive is
named 
texlive-20190410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz 
rather than 
texlive-20200410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz. 

I suppose that this is just a typo? 
The sha256sum of 
ftp.tug.org/texlive/historic/2020/texlive-20190410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz
2990a8d275506c297b2239a1b4c5d9a9ec0d18cf12ff9a6a33924cf2e3838ed4
differs from
ftp.tug.org/texlive/historic/2019/texlive-20190410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz
4c93a5c7d28df63c6dd7f767822e5dacf9290a0dff4990663e283b6e2d8d1918
so it is at least not the same archive.

Best regards,
Henrik Grimler

Thank you!

It did work shortly after I wrote, as you say, without the --upgrade flag.

I would suggest using TeXworks as your front end to TeX Live; TeXworks has an "Errors, warnings, badboxes" tab which appear only if one of the three has been detected, and which can the be used to inspect the reported probkem(s)

Hi,

Maybe this library could be helpful: https://github.com/reitzig/texlogparser

It is pretty good at parsing the log file and filter for errors and 
other problems.

Hello,

I've installed TL2020 today and found that `genmisc` is not installed
though it used to be included in TeX Live.

Is there any particular reason for `genmisc` being removed or did this
happen on accident?

Best,

    Is there any particular reason for `genmisc` being removed 

genmisc was a leftover from the beginning which combined many disparate
(generally single-file) packages. Before the 2020 release, I moved these
into their separate packages (or removed them, if they were
nonfree). One benefit is now that those tiny packages have the
description from their catalogue entries ... --best, karl.

Hi Henrik,

    In ftp.tug.org/texlive/historic/2020/ the tlpdb archive is
    named 
    texlive-20190410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz 
    rather than 
    texlive-20200410-tlpdb-full.tar.gz. 

    I suppose that this is just a typo? 

You're right, it was a typo. Got my years confused there.
All the files inside the tarball are dated 2020-04-06, so I renamed it
to texlive-20200406-tlpdb-full.tar.gz. --thanks, karl.

Hi everyone - there has been mail about it already, but for the record,
yesterday I moved the tl20 and mactex20 images and other files to the
public areas on tug.org. They are making their way around CTAN.  Please
give it a couple days to reach the mirrors.

There are no changes from the final pretest.

I've updated the TL web pages at https://tug.org/texlive, though
doubtless some staleness remains. Let me know if problems.

A torrent for the .iso is available, linked from
https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html. Thanks to Tim Stewart for this.

The TeX Collection image is not yet final, so I haven't made those
updates. Also, we have no ETA on this year's DVD mailing as yet, but it
will surely be delayed due to the global health situation.

Happy TeXing. --karl

Since TeX Live is distributed over HTTP (at least the mirror closest to me), I thought I'd add signature verification to my update script. However, the signing key doesn't look right. I checked a mirror and the main ctan.org, and also a couple different .asc files. They both show 4CE1877E19438C70 as the public key:

% gpg --verify -v install-tl-windows.exe.sha512.asc
gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir '/home/peloquin/.gnupg'
gpg: assuming signed data in 'install-tl-windows.exe.sha512'
gpg: Signature made 2020-04-06T05:51:16 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4CE1877E19438C70
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key

But this shows that it should be 0D5E5D9106BAB6BC:

https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#CRYPTOGRAPHIC-VERIFICATION

I found the incorrect key appear before in this mailing list. The reply says 'the actual signature file is broken':

I am pleased to be able to report that following this announcement, and even more importantly, following my adoption of Akira-san's suggestion to add the CURL certificate to my WGET suite, the TeX Live 2020 TL SHELL/MGR were happy to migrate from the pre-test repository to the main repository and to update therefrom.? The only thing that was updated was "Arara", but I imagine that that will change over the next 48 fours or so.? My sincere thanks to all imvolved.? I should also note that (again, following my adoption of Akira-san's suggestion to add the CURL certificate to my WGET suite), TL-Cockpit no longer just spins but appears to do everything that it should.

Subject: LaTeX compilers can't find files in texmf-local
Message-ID: <CAKP36g6hW1O+7=m2UDg6DSXW+MCTeTG4BnT7ewD_Az+jH35MiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I installed TeXLive 2020 and I noticed something strange.
I installed a custom .sty file in my texmf-local directory (under
./tex/latex/local/),
then I ran mktexlsr to make it visible to LaTeX, and it seemed to do its
job successfully
(I ran kpsewhich as well, which was able to locate the .sty file).
However, when I try to compile a document that uses that package,
the compiler is unable to find it.
This problem also affects fonts installed in texmf-local/fonts/.
This behavior seems strange to me because TeXLive 2019 did not give me such
problems.
I am using TeXLive 2020 on Windows 10 Pro 1909 64-bit, and I have TeXLive
2019 installed as well.

Best wishes,
Manuel

Hi

~/tex is not in the default search path since ages. You need to put the files under ~/texmf in a TDS conformant way. That has been like this for at least 10 years.

I can't reproduce this. I just put a sty as test in 
C:\texlive\texmf-local\tex\latex\local and after mktexlsr it is
found without problems. How is the name of your sty? What is the
exact error message you get in your document?

may I add:

there are three places for the files:

1: \texlive\texmf-dist\tex\latex
2: \texmf-local\tex\latex
3: ~\.texliveYYYY

IMHO Norbert mentioned Nr. 3

Nr. 2 ist for system-wide local files (not per user)

Ulrike an Philip mentioned Nr. 2 (as also used by myself) an this works fine

A hint to investigate: Nr. 2 ist fixed during the installation procedure

best,
Andreas

These are updated files.  TDS came up in the mid 90es and was first
used by teTeX.

If you install TeXLive without changing the settings, you get

/texlive/2020
and
/texlive/texmf-local

I couldn't detect any hint on texmf-local in http://tug.org/tds/

Sure, but the final version was published then:

Thank you very much for your support.
The .sty file is called poliphd.sty. Here are the steps to reproduce the
issue:
1) put poliphd.sty inside C:/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local/
2) run mktexlsr (it will successfully complete its job)
3) use the poliphd package inside a document and compile it

here is the error I get

! LaTeX Error: File `poliphd.sty' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

Enter file name:

The interesting thing is that putting poliphd.sty file inside the home
texmf directory (~/texmf/tex/latex/),
the compiler can find the document without any issue.

Best wishes,
Manuel

Thank you very much for your support.
The .sty file is called poliphd.sty. Here are the steps to reproduce the
issue:
1) put poliphd.sty inside C:/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local/
2) run mktexlsr (it will successfully complete its job)
3) use the poliphd package inside a document and compile it

here is the error I get

The interesting thing is that putting poliphd.sty file inside the home

the compiler can find the document without any issue.

there is no need to run a LaTeX program to see if latex can find it, on the command line run

kpsewhich poliphd.sty

and it will return the path to it if found.

    Subject: file random is missing

I am awaiting confirmation from the author (Don Arseneau) that it is in
the public domain so that the file can be updated. There is nothing in
the file itself that says so, and the label on CTAN is, unfortunately,
not sufficient.

    The folder genmisc is missing.

All the files that were in genmisc are now either their own packages or
(if nonfree) removed. --best, karl.

Do you have a ls-R file in texmf-local? Was it updated by the
mktexlsr command? What do you get from 
   kpsewhich poliphd.sty
?

Hello, here is an update about my issue:
the problems seems to be about directory permissions,
because when I run pdflatex or kpsewhich as an *administrator* everything
works fine and I am able to compile the document.
However, whenever I try to run either command as a *normal user, *kpsewhich
will return no output and pdflatex will complain about the missing .sty
file. It seems however that even after giving full control of the
C:/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local directory to all users the issue is
not solved; this behavior seems strange because with TeXLive 2019 I did not
need to change any permissions.
I wish you all happy easter.

Best,
Manuel

What are the permissions of 
	texmf-local/ls-R
and in addition, you need the rx permission for al lthe directories on
the way to tex/latex/local!

Subject: Acronyms hyperlink in the index
Message-ID: <1749467513.251191.1586699286995@mail1.libero.it>

With TL2020 I have rebuilt (macOS) some documents and noticed that using acronym package some acronyms are really hyperlink. I do not understand the logic for which some acronym are hyperlink and other not. In the attachment you can see an example of screen shot taken for a document built with TL2019 and TL2020. For what I know the acronyms should hyperlink in the text but not in their index.

On macOS  I installed TL2020 with install-tl -no-gui, i.e. I do not use MacTeX.

BTW, the acronym package seems to be updated recently, its documentation on CTAN says released on 2020.04.17! 5 days in the future...

Happy Easter,
  Angelo.

To Ulrike:
1) Yes, I do have a ls-R file in texmf-local
2) Yes, it is successfully updated by mktexlsr

After a lot of messing around with folder permissions, I was able to solve
the issue this way:
1) Move the texmf-local to another partition (I usually have a separate
data partition on my laptop's hard drive)
2) Give full control of the folder to every user
3) Move texmf-local back under C:/texlive/

Now kpsewhich will successfully return the path to poliphd.sty if I run it
as admin or as a normal user.

Thank you again for helping me, and happy Easter!

Best,
Manuel

Write access??? Should not be necessary. read and execute is necessary

I agree with Norbert, the permissions should be r for files and rx for
directories and there should be one nonprivileged person allowed to
update texmf-local, that owner should have rw for files and rwx for
directories. If you need more maintainers, then you should create a
group, eg "texlive", add the maintainers to that group and make the
relevant trees owned by that group. What often happens is that you
accidentally run mktexlsr as root, the ls-R files become owned by root
and further mktexlsr by normal user does not work and the error
messages are not loud enough. If this happens, there is no need to
move the trees, just becom root, use recursive chown and chmod to set
the correct perissions and finally run mktexlsr as nonprivileged user
optionally from the required group (if set).

The permission system of NTFS is impossibly complicated, and the
tools to handle permissions, either gui or command-line, are pretty
horrible. So, straightening out permissions by copying things back
and forth is not totally insane.

Anyhow, mktexlsr needs to be run as administrator for an admin
install. You can do this from an admin command prompt. But you can
also start TeX Live Manager from the menu, which will auto-elevate
if necessary, and then do Actions >> Regenerate filename database.

The hyperlinked acronyms in their index seems to behave as backref does. The documents where I have seen these hyperlinked acronyms in their index have this:

\usepackage[pagebackref]{hyperref}
\usepackage[hyperpageref]{backref}

The documents without the above have the acronyms as expected also in TL2020 but, recently only acronym package seems updated. The above package, hyperref and backref, were updated on 2020.01.14 and the last build I did with TL2019 with the expected acronyms was done on 2020.03.03.

I do not understand the logic for which some acronym are hyperlink and other not. In the attachment you can see an example of screen shot taken for a document built with TL2019 and TL2020.

It's quite time consuming though.  I have problems with file
permissions quite often at work and asked our IT department for help.

I don't have access to a Windows machine right now and dialog boxes on
the machine at work are in German.  Maybe someone with an English
version could provide a more exact answer.

Windows uses access control lists instead of Unix-like file
permissions.  If you create a new subdirectory, this directory
inherits the permissions from its parent directory.

If something is wrong, go to a parent directory in the Exploder, for
instance 'c:/texlive/'.  Then right-click on the problematic
directory, for instance '2020' or 'texmf-local' and select
'properties'.  Select the 'security' tab.  Check whether the
permissions of this directory are correct.  This is very important.
If you are not sure, compare these settings with those of other
directories.

There is a button 'Erweitert' on a German Windows, maybe 'Extended' or
similar in English.  If you click on this button you'll see a checkbox
at the bottom which, when checked, makes all subdirectories to inherit
the permissions of the current directory.  This takes a while because
the whole tree has to be scanned but is *much* faster than copying
files around.

Maybe someone with an English Windows can provide a better
explanation with exact wordings.

Regards,
  Reinhard

There is a button 'Enable inheritance' and a checkbox 'Replace all
child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries
from this object'

Near the top of this window, you can also change the owner.

Worth a try, but often enough I failed to accomplish what I wanted.

But I must add that I usually do not try very hard, because for me
refreshing a virtual machine takes but a moment, and even a
non-virtual windows is quickly restored from an image backup.

Subject: Error in the location of the files in the `tkz-doc`
Message-ID: <CANeU4n_8KjVMvqARNXr1nay3RadOU9R35zfUZ+uobmmXs37riw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I think there's an error in the location of the files in the `tkz-doc`
package, in my TeXLive distribution updated from pretest to today, I get

$ ls /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tkz-doc/
couverture.tex  tkz-doc.cfg
$ ls /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/latex/tkz-doc/
latex  README.md
$ ls /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/latex/tkz-doc/latex/
couverture.tex  tkz-doc.cfg  tkz-doc.cls  tkzexample.sty

The correct locations are:

/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/latex/tkz-doc/
  README.md
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tkz-doc/
  couverture.tex  tkz-doc.cfg  tkz-doc.cls  tkzexample.sty

And one last thing, some packages are currently out of circulation:
tkz-graph
tkz-linknodes
tkz-berge
tkz-kiviat
But, the folders in /doc are still there, I assume they are there because they
contain subdirectories (examples/) that are empty and 'tlmgr' I don't remove
them.

Hi,

With TeX Live 2020, when I install the latex-bin package, lualatex
cannot be installed because luabhtex is not installed (see the log
below). Is this expected, or should latex-bin depend on luahbtex so
the latter can be automatically installed? Thanks!

Message-ID: <CAAH+9xYBA=w++bFo6wO-jU_fqf6oRxoG=Psm0bJ11Eb=vAfk8g@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have the new 2020 release installed on my Linux (Ubuntu) home
machine, but I have to install one copy at my Windows 10 (university)
computer. Before install the windows executable I would like to try an
install using the WSL subsystem (Ubuntu 18.04). Unfortunately, all my
attempts failed.

I found some messages about how to resolve problems *after* an
installation, but I did not find any references about *how* to
install.

My attempts as user, root and sudo all failed with the messages:

How do you install?

I use TeXLive on WSL since WSL was added to Windows (maybe I do use WSL just for TeXlive) and I Install always with the install-tl script, from command line. Usually I choose HOME/texlive for installation and than move the installation directory to /opt: just this last step needs sudo. Obviously I have a script which is sourced by .bashrc and sets all the needed environment variable, but this only if /opt/texlive exists.

Really, they are a few year I do not install TeXlive at all nor I use tlmgr to maintain it up to date on WSL: just rsync the installation I do on GNU/Linux Mint and which is based on the same Ubuntu of WSL. I install and update only on Mint and then I rsync it on two machine, one with W10 Pro and another (a tablet!) with W10 Home. On WSL you cannot use X apps unless you use extra software..

On WSL I have a symlink to the Windows folder where LaTeX docs live...

Ciao,
  Angelo.

Subject: Texlive old install support
Message-ID: <457D14C2-F248-4678-B6AB-B8AB64963D03@gmail.com>

I am trying to maintain a docker container (like a small virtual machine with specific software0 so TexLive users can make a specific container that reliably and efficiently can be used to make their latex documents.

A real problem is that each year I have to move to the latest tex live distribution; which inevitably breaks the building of documents based on older packages.  

Philosophically, this is a serious problem.  There are many old documents which will require expert intervention to create if the build tools move this much every year, and the old tools do not work.

I tried downloading an archive build and got a failed installation on a checksum.

Reliably building old documents should be a priority for the texlive system.  Otherwise a love of creative intellectual property will become unstable. 

Can there be a long term maintenance policy for some versions of texlive?  Leaving an archive to 3rd parties does not seem reasonable, especially if those builds just fail after one year?

Thanks,

Warren MacEvoy

Why should it break? Docker supports versioning (tagging). So you could have a
tag latest point to the latest TeX Live but provide tags for older releases.
Have a look at the images of the Island of TeX:
  https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive
They provide latest and historical releases.

When using tagging the user could fetch a versioned (read TL year) image.
Because the ISO images of old releases do not change there would be no broken
documents.

What's missing from the ISO images that are provided on the mirrors? They are a
complete snapshot of the software at that time.

Hi,

some notes that came up while packaging:
-in package tudscr, the depend on cbfonts-fd may be removed, as it also 
depends on cbfonts which itself depends on cbfonts-fd.
-the -docs from package texlive-scripts and package 
texlive-scripts-extra are the only two packages having content which is 
*not* within /docs/ :
   scripts/texlive/README
   scripts/texlive-extra/README

Cheers,

Dear Karl,

would you please put README.txt, contained in
http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/media4svg.tds.zip
in the TeXLive package, instead of README.md? The latter is better suited
for web view, and has therefore been installed in the CTAN pkg directory.
I'd prefer README.txt to be used with texdoc in TeXLive.

Thank you and kind regards,
Alexander

Interestingly, unless/until Karl makes the requested change, there appears no straightforward way of reading the .txt file that Alexander recommends.

  * texdoc media4svg/README.txt

(with slash in either direction) simply says 'Sorry, no documentation found for "media4svg/README.txt"'.

I am confused.

I am asking for replacing README.md (currently used for TL packaging)
with  README.txt (contained in [1]). If `texdoc media4svg/README.txt'
were successful I wouldn't have sent my request here.

For verification I downloaded [1]. README.txt can be found therein.

Sorry for any confusion, Alexander.? I had thought that both files were in the TeXdoc-sought location, and the wrong one was being preferred.

If you want to use a TeX Live version longer-term, what's the issue with 
installing the historic ones from ISO? The TeX Live people mainly just 
install other people's (La)TeX packages: actual binary changes are a 
small part of the total work done.

I have TeX Live from 2009 onward installed on my own PC, which with 
today's disk sizes is quite achievable: I'm not sure there is an big 
issue there. (People like AMS who need absolute stability archive every 
part of the build setup with every file, but that's an extreme approach.)

Hi,

this problem affects me, too. My users are German speaking book authors 
with (mostly) very limited IT knowledge.

For them following the simple instructions by the installation 
wizard-style GUI works fine -- just using the default settings -- but it 
would be much more difficult for them to download and work with an ISO 
file.

Perfect (from users' point of view) would be:

Having radiobuttons in the GUI:

( ) Use last year's TeX Life collection
( ) Use newest TeX Life

Could that be done?  :)

Cheers
Karl-Heinz

I very much doubt it: all of the historic data is on a single system, 
the CTAN network only has the current live release.

I am surprised that people are having such severe version issues: most 
LaTeX package authors do get the 'long term stability' business. 
Certainly the kernel team take this incredibly seriously.

For the non-tech savvy, on-line options like Overleaf or Papeeria do 
offer a known version and stability on a per-project basis.

I think it would be a big mistake to offer such a simple gui option to end users
.
Some people who really need archive stability and possibly a virtual
machine archiving an entire historic build process can do that, but
they don't need a radio button to help them.

But to offer an end user an easy option to install a tex system that
can not be updated and is likely untested with current packages that
are available on ctan seems very risky.

If the end user has a document and it fails to work after updating the
texlive year that should (normally) be considered as a bug. It's
always reasonable to report it anyway, the package author will either
accept it as a bug or document what change is required in the new
version.

I see, yes, there are two different ways of thinking:

* Other projects are releasing "stable version" and then (perhaps) also 
unstable work-in-progress.

* But the TeX system and all of its packages are assumed to be stable at 
any time.


So you are right, I agree there is no need to have 'freezed' versions 
available via the installer program.

Thanks for your patience. :)

I guess you somehow archive what goes into the container anyway,
otherwise things like OS package version updates inside your container
will break things as well (not to mention the uncertain future of Docker
itself). By design, containers have an infamous record of keeping alive
outdated duplicates of everything, at any HDD space cost. So why not
TeXLive as well?

You don't *have to*! Why not have an install of all the TL vintages you
need lurking around on some NFS share?
That way, full TL history awareness is accessible with zero maintenance/
virtualisation/containerisation overhead, and O(1) scaling with the
number of client machines.

Then another (both philosophical and real) question: What kinds of
documents do you expect to be both long-lasting and relying on moving
targets (like TeX packages)? Do you consider any bug introduced in, say,
2013 worth preserving, since some author has once built a workaround and
now her documents stumble upon this?
TeX development in general is very conservative, and tries to not break
things (and does so quite well IME). But time moves on, and it is both
na?ve and pretentious to have a zero-maintenance attitude as an author,
and demand software devs to maintain the quirks you grew up with. What
if hyphenation patterns become better over time, and a document output
has changed, because TeX now hyphenates a larger fraction of words
correctly? Which version is the ?right? one then?

> I tried downloading an archive build and got a failed installation on

IMHO, this is unexpected and worth a bug report on its own.

Who said that .tex is a long-term archival format? If you want your
documents to endure times, carve them into stone, print them onto
archival-grade paper, microfilm, or at least turn them into PDF-A.
The fallacy has been to rely on complicated source code in the first
place. Source files will be readable as long as someone knows how to
turn ASCII into letters; and visual representation has always been
variable since the days Gutenberg had to decide which ligatures to
include into his typeface and which not.

And if stability of intellectual property is of high priority for you, I
assume you have directed these concerns to Microsoft as well to end
their Office 365 craze and finally make their documents archive-safe. As
sad as it is to admit this in the first place: too much of the
intellectual achievements of mankind is kept imprisoned in .doc{,x}
files, and history has shown that in a mere decade this will be
obsolete, and those can be glad who have printed versions of their
work.

> 
> Can there be a long term maintenance policy for some versions of

When documents break that fast, this has the sore aftertaste of
incomplete separation of form and content, and/or different conceptions
of what is considered ?experimental? and ?stable?; another thing that
isn't within the responsibility of developers, but document authors.

That said, feel free to persuade us of the demand for a more
comprehensive TL history lesson than the fully functional (!) installers
at https://www.tug.org/historic/ (or the growing heap of TL DVDs in
one's bookshelf), and in doubt the SVN history of TL at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/ . I don't know a single software project
that provides such an exhaustive backtrace of its onw history.

If I understood you correctly, you suggest kind of a dual-pace LTS
rhythm like Ubuntu, Firefox or the Linux kernel have. But then, these
play in a totally different league of project structure, objective, and
manpower. LTS support means someone is paid to be responsible for
backporting bug fixes into obsolete package versions. The TL project has
neither the structural needs nor the qualification to do so (most of the
code that is shipping with TL is not from TL itself, but imported from
CTAN).

Johannes

Warren MacEvoy <wmacevoy at gmail.com> asks on Mon, 13 Apr 2020 18:45:48
-0600 about archiving older versions of TeX Live to ensure continuing
ability to typeset old documents.

On our *.math.utah.edu systems, we have TeX Live versions 2003 to
2020, except for 2006, which is curiously missing, but could probably
be recovered from a CD-ROM on my campus office shelf (like most others
these days, I'm working from home, in my fourth week of campus
absence).  I'll be happy to provide Warren with bundles for any set of
TeX Live years that he needs.  I believe that I have CD-ROMs of older
releases from NTG that could be resurrected when I get back to campus.

I wrote about the problem of archival documents in section 3 of this
report:

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/doc/luamult.pdf

It is not just a question of TeXware packages: there is also the
significant issue of the underlying Unicode font rendering engines on
each platform, which differ across platforms, and evolve in time.

Docker containers, jails, and virtual machines provide a reasonable
solution, particularly the latter, because they can be run
indefinitely far into the future.  Dockers and jails depend on the
current O/S on which they reside, and thus do not necesarily provide a
time-independent archival solution.

There is substantial community interest in keeping old computer
architectures running, even if the original hardware no longer exists,
and Hyper-V, QEMU, SIMH, and Xen teams are doing a great job of doing
that.  They even support future architectures; I recently successfully
built TeX Live 2020 for the RISC-V CPU family: see

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2020/README.html#fedora-32-risc-v

for which desktop systems are not yet available (RISC-V boards are,
but pricey, about US$1K each).

Hi Nelson,
there is no TeX Live 2006 release due to delays caused by the
transition from Perforce to Subversion.

Great! Thanks so much, Karl! I'm not familiar with the development
process of TeX Live, and I wonder when this change will be available
(i.e. `tlmgr install latex-bin` can install luahbtex). If it will take
more than a few days, I'll temporarily install luahbtex explicitly in
TinyTeX.

Hi Johannes,

    -in package tudscr, the depend on cbfonts-fd may be removed, as it also 
    depends on cbfonts which itself depends on cbfonts-fd.

Ok, removed, though there's no harm in it. I'm sure there are redundant
dependencies in other cases too. And sometimes it is helpful for
maintenance (of the .tlpsrc).

    -the -docs from package texlive-scripts and package 
    texlive-scripts-extra are the only two packages having content which is 
    *not* within /docs/ :
       scripts/texlive/README
       scripts/texlive-extra/README

Ok, I removed them as doc patterns. They'll just be in the ISO image and
Master tree. Not really user documentation anyway. --thanks, karl.

Ahhhh. Thanks for the explanation.  I haven't been to my
campus office for almost 4 weeks, and we have been advised
to stay away until the virus problem substantially decreases.
Thus, I couldn't check my rack of DVDs to see if there was
one for 2006.

Hi Philip,

with today's tlcritical we are shipping a curl with ssl support for
Windows, as well as a set of certificates.

On Windows10 which already ships a working curl I tested it with
TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN=1 env variable, but I would like to see whether it
works on Windows 7, too.

Could you please:
- update texlive.infra from tlcritical
- get your wget out of the way, so that only system provided stuff
  is available
- after that run the following
	
	tlmgr --repository https://contrib.texlive.info/current -v -v shell

  Then, at the tlmgr> prompt please type
	load local
  and send me the output, please.

Here is a session running the same on my linux computer:

$ tlmgr --repository https://contrib.texlive.info/current -v -v shell

A few months ago I had to install Texlive 2016 and Texlive 2017 in my
Debian box for a paper that uses biber and that I needed to upload to
arxiv... arxiv wouldn't run biber on it itself, so I had to generate a
.bbl using the right version of Texlive.

I took "executable notes" of everything that I did - in the sense of
<http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2019.html> - and the commands that I
gave for Texlive 2016 were these (note that some lines are sent to the
shell and some others to install-tl):

--snip--snip--

export S=$HOME/snarf
mkdir -p $S/http/ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2016/
cd       $S/http/ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2016/
wget -nc  http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2016/texlive2016.iso
wget -nc  http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2016/texlive2016.iso.md5
md5sum -c  texlive2016.iso.md5

mkdir -p    /tmp/loop
sudo umount /tmp/loop
sudo mount -o loop,ro \
  $S/http/ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2016/texlive2016.iso
\
  /tmp/loop

cd /tmp/loop/
sudo ./install-tl
D
2
/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-local
7
~/.texlive2016/texmf
R
O
Y
R
I

--snip--snip--

To compile my paper with the old Texlive, what I did was:

  export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
  which lualatex
  which biber

  # Some kind of "make clean", then:
  lualatex         2019J-ops.tex
  biber            2019J-ops
  pdflatex -record 2019J-ops.tex

I think that if half a dozen people could share their recipes for
installing old Texlives then we can consider that we've done our part,
and we can delegate the next steps to people who are more web-savvy
and more end-user-savvy than us...

  Cheers,

That all seems rather 'heavy'. As detailed in

Does that mean that if I have a TeX Live installation for (say) 2008 which was not fully updated during the life of TeX Live 2008, I can retrospectively update it to the pre-freeze-for-2009 version? using the recipe above ?

Oops, sorry, a bit more detail needed.

One can update between *some* TeX Live installs, but it's not really 
recommended. Rather, I'd go to

     ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/

and download the network installer for the year I wanted (they are in 
per-year directories), unpack it then do

     install-tl -repository 
ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/<year>/tlnet-final

This is exactly what I did to set up my laptop: that works back to at 
least 2009. (Really, anyone needing TL pre-2009 must have very unusual 
requirements: I tend not to need anything before about 2012 nowadays.)

Fine, thank you Joseph ? all understood.? It just so happens that a major project started life in 2008, which is why I go back so far, but in practice it doesn't break until 2016/17.

Use dvipdfmx; that's the same program as backend driver of XeTeX
(XeTeX actually does not produce PDF directly, which generates only
XDV (extended DVI) and convert it to PDF using xdvipdfmx.

Depends a bit if you used \specials in the code and if yes for which
backend. Either 

dvips file
ps2pdf file

or

dvipdfmx file

No \specials, Ulrike (this stuff has to be completely driver-agnostic), so "dvipdfmx" will be perfect.
Thank you.

Hi all,

there is probably a historical difference. TeX creates DVI which is
then converted by dvipdfmx or dvipdfm but XeTeX creates XDV which is
then converted by xdvipdfmx. Looking at the installed system. nowadays
all of them are just one program (xdvipdfmx) with two alias names,
probably for backward compatibility.

Subject: TL documentation
Message-ID: <87mu7cg46u.fsf@example.com>

Hi,

unfortunately, for the French TL documentation for the TL 2020,
I commited only the `.tex` source file, and not the `.pdf` and `.html`
files: I thought the compilations would be done for all the languages by
Karl. Okay, now I know for next year :)

But my point here is that I tried to get these files with TL
2020. Unfortunately, the corresponding compilations failed because the
Makefile (Master/texmf-dist/doc/texlive/texlive-en/Makefile) now
contains:

  ?????
  ? tlpre = tlpre
  ? env = TEXINPUTS=../texlive-common:../texlive-en:; export TEXINPUTS; $(tlpre)
  ?????

but `tlpre` is an unknown command (hence I dropped it in order to be
able to provide these files with TL 2020' update).

What is this strange `tlpre`?

All the best.

Hi Pablo,

    Subject: Error in the location of the files in the `tkz-doc`

Writing the tkz-doc author about this separately, will cc you.

    But, the folders in /doc are still there, I assume they are there
    because they contain subdirectories (examples/) that are empty and
    'tlmgr' I don't remove them.

As far as I know, that's right, tlmgr doesn't try to recursively remove
empty (sub)directories. We do remove them in the development tree, so
they don't stick around past a new release, at least.

Thanks for the reports. --karl

Is this reproducible after waiting a bit?

My guess is that the CTAN mirror was in the process of syncing, thus the
tlpdb and the actual file were not in sync.

Good. Unfortunately we cannot do anything to mitigate this problem,
since the mirrors use rsync and thus there always will be a window.

Even then, there are things like
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/branches/branch2007/
(or the history of individual files in trunk) that are just fine/helpful
if you know what you are looking for, and/or betake yourself to a

Subject: TEXMFDBS and TEXMFHOME
Message-ID: <f1bc34ec-8d8d-177d-f1ed-e2f0fd46cc83@icking-music-archive.org>

A few days ago I installed texlive 2020 on my linux work station like I 
did with the preceding releases. I've been using TeX for decades and 
carry with me a TEXMFHOME. So I filled in its path like I use to do.

Upon a successful installation I checked the release news and noticed a 
new option 'tlmgr check texmfdbs'. I performed the check and got an 
error report on TEXMFHOME 'in TEXMF not in TEXMFDBS, but has ls-R file'.

So I checked the variable TEXMFDBS in 
<root>/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf and saw that my TEXMFHOME 
was not reflected. I'm a little surprised because I did specify my 
TEXMFHOME when I started installing texlive-2020.

Is that intentional?

My workaround was to copy the assignment of TEXMFDBS to
<root>/texlive/texmf.cnf and add my TEXMFHOME

TEXMFDBS =
{!!$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFDIST}

This solved the problem. But the idea of my local texmf.cnf is that it

'should contain only your personal changes from the original texmf.cnf'

I know how to add to the value of shell variable. But I didn't manage to 
find out how to do that with TeX conf variable.

Could I have added my TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS otherwise, ie. without 
repeating the already existing assignment?

Best regards

By default there is no ls-R file in TEXMFHOME and TEXMFHOME is not in
TEXMFDBS.  This is intentional because the number of files in
TEXMFHOME is relatively small and a database lookup is not necessary.
As a result, there is no need to run mktexlsr whenever you add new
files and this is the main reason for the default settings.

I don't know what created the ls-R file though.  I recommend to remove
it and as well as the entries in texmf.cnf you made.

There will be no noticeable speed improvement unless you have hundreds
of files in in TEXMFHOME.

If you add something to 2020/texmf.cnf and forget to copy this file to
2021/texmf.cnf next year you run into trouble and it's not always
easy to find out what goes wrong.

If you _have_ a lot of files in TEXMFHOME you can consider to move
then to TEXMFLOCAL if possible.  That would avoid a customized setup
and all the trouble it causes.  Please note that TeX Live never
touches anything in TEXMFLOCAL.  Your files are as save there as in
TEXMFHOME.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes. In 99% you don't need an ls-R in TEXMFHOME, and shouldn't have one.
Best is to:
- remove the ls-R there
- reinstatiate the previous definition of TEXMFDBS

TEXMFHOME is stil searched.

Thanks!

more packagers nitpicks:
links/scripts from package.ARCH are supposed to land in the PATH, at 
least for packaging.
What purpose is the "man" symlink from texlive-scripts.ARCH? It breaks 
the on linux commonly
installed man/man-db for me.

mktexlsr(link) is now in texlive.infra, but i'd like to avoid 
texlive.infra as it also ships tlmgr which is not
recommended to be packaged. As mktexlsr is needed on any texlive 
installation(although it's just the symlink in that package), may it be 
moved elsewhere, e.g. texlive-scripts?

Following packages name ifxetex,ifluatex,... in longdesc, but these 
packages don't exist anymore in favour
of package iftex:
auto-pst-pdf-lua
datetime2-it-fulltext
luapackageloader
xfakebold
These may also list iftex as depend.

beamer in longdesc lists dependencies(atbegshi, etoolbox, hyperref, 
ifpdf,pgf,translator)
which are only partly listed in it's depend list.

But what is "small"? I have 250+ files in my ~/.texmf, various old .tex
and personal .sty files, and documentation.

This is not possible, where the texlive distribution has been installed
by root. Like the OP, I like to carry my ~/.texmf round with me, so I
can work from multiple machines.

Yes, 250 is small. My quite small texmf-local contains 7200 files.
Compare with texmfdist containing more than 190 thousand files.

OK but then you are in a problem. If your TEXMFHOME is in TEXMFDBS and
a root runs mktexlsr, then the ls-R files in your TEXMFHOME will be
owned by root and you will not be able to update them

Just one additional note: I have just looked into a directory tree of
our book we are just writing. It has a main file, its .sty, one file
per chapter, one file per image. It now contains just preview images
and will contain two versions of production quality images, colour and
grayscale (not yet created). The whole project now contains 200+ files
and when everything is finished, t will contain approximately 600
files (with files for gnuplot etc). Thus 250 is really a small system.

Indeed, there is something fishy: THere are three files playing into all
this:
- texlive.tlpdb			the database
- texlive.tlpdb.sha512		sha512 hash of the database
- texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc	signature of the hash of the database

Now it seems that on the DANTE server:
- texlive.tlpdb			is from yesterday
- texlive.tlpdb.sha512		is from yesterday
- texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc	is from **today**

Then of course, there is an error.

I don't know how this could have happened, but a simply re-rsync should
fix it. On the tug server it is correct.

Best

Norbert

So do I. Thank you so much all of you for your thorough answers to my 
main question. I keep my TEXMFHOME and have deleted its ls-R file which 
was most likely created several years ago, long before I started using 
texlive.

My second question remains unanswered. How can I append to the value of 
an assigned tex conf variable like TEXMFDBS? in case I should need to do so.

Without looking back to see which O/S you are using ...? In Windows, you can evaluate the variable by surrounding it with per-cent symbols and then appending (or pre-pending), as in :

C:\? Set TEXMFDBS = %TEXMFDBS%;D:\
C:\? Set TEXMFDBS = D:\;%TEXMFDBS%

Almost the same in UNIX systems, you only use forward slashes, $ at
the beginning of the name instead of % signs around, colons instead of
semicolons (UNIX has no drive letters), you must not use spaces around
=, and you need export. Whether you use "set" or something else,
depends on your shell.

I tried something like that

Sorry, my poor memory...

I have just looked into my old texmf.xnf which I share between CentOS,
Fedora, Raspbian and Mac OSX. It seems that a variable cannot refer
itself. I add my development trees this way:

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
% By default, this is only the !! elements of TEXMF, so that mktexlsr
% does not create ls-R files in the non-!! elements -- because if an
% ls-R is present, it will be used, and the disk will not be searched.
% This is arguably a bug in kpathsea.
TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST,!!$PBML,!!$DEVNAG,!!$TEXMFDEVEL}

% Devanagari CVS development
DEVNAG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../velthuis

% My development
TEXMFDEVEL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-devel

% PBML
PBML = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../ufalpbml/style/texmf

I think you can get out of the way with something simpler if you want to share
between different machines (linux/win/mac) and that is to use `auxtree`.

First we check the output of:

$ kpsewhich -all texmf.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

You should get an out like that, now we edit `.bashrc` and add:

export TEXMFCNF='~/texmf:'

Let's assume that the directory containing all the work you want (in
TDS structure)
is in
~/work/manyfiles/

And now we run:

$ tlmgr conf auxtrees --conffile /home/yourname/texmf/texmf.cnf add
~/work/manyfiles/

And we checked the output of:

$ tlmgr conf auxtrees --conffile /home/yourname/texmf/texmf.cnf show
List of auxiliary texmf trees:
  /home/yourname/work/manyfiles/

And these ready :)
Without using 'sudo' or anything like that, only with our user account.
Of course, it is good and recommended that you read the related documentation

PS: Cambien works in windows if you have collaborative work with other people

Pablo

The "pl" package in TeX Live is pl-mf on CTAN (created that way by
Staszek, or maybe te, as I recall), so the dependency is correct. This
name confusion is one of the things I hope to clean up after you make
that pending upload we've been working on. (I hope you will merge
pl-tfm[.zip] into pl-mf, too, BTW.)

Independent of that, I think the pl package on CTAN should be renamed,
but I suppose it's too late for that. Anyway. --thanks, karl.

Hi Johannes,

    more packagers nitpicks:

What are you packaging TL for? Just curious.

    What purpose is the "man" symlink from texlive-scripts.ARCH? 

Desirable for Macs, as it makes their man automatically find the TL man
pages without any user configuration.

    It breaks the on linux commonly installed man/man-db for me.

Can you install your man-db file in texmf-dist/doc/man?

    beamer in longdesc lists dependencies(atbegshi, etoolbox, hyperref, 
    ifpdf,pgf,translator)
    which are only partly listed in it's depend list.

Ok, added. (I suspect beamer has plenty more dependencies.)

    Following packages name ifxetex,ifluatex,... in longdesc, but these 
    packages don't exist anymore in favour of package iftex:

longdesc text comes from CTAN, so updates must be made there.  
Best would be to write ctan at ctan.org and the package authors.

    auto-pst-pdf-lua datetime2-it-fulltext luapackageloader xfakebold
    These may also list iftex as depend.

Ok, added. (I suspect many more packages depend on iftex. I don't
want to try to find them or add them. But since you mentioned these, ok. :)

    mktexlsr(link) is now in texlive.infra, but i'd like to avoid 
    texlive.infra as it also ships tlmgr which is not
    recommended to be packaged. As mktexlsr is needed on any texlive 
    installation(although it's just the symlink in that package), 

texlive.infra contains the actual mktexlsr script as well as the
symlinks in texlive.infra.ARCH.

    may it be moved elsewhere, e.g. texlive-scripts?

I tried putting mktexlsr in texlive-scripts; that would be the logical
place for it. Unfortunately install-tl fails then, because it's not
available early enough. So you'll have to work around this in some other
way. Sorry. --best, karl.

Subject: [tex-live] adding support for MidnightBSD in tlmgr
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1587170147.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

I have just successfully used my amd64-freebsd113 binaries to run a
TeX Live 2020 update on Midnight BSD 1.2, installed from the
texcol2020.iso file.  

The only glitch is that tlmgr does not recognize that system: it
reports

	tlmgr: could not guess OS from config.guess string:        \
	amd64-unknown-midnightbsd1.2 at                            \
	/usr/uumath/texlive/2020/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 325.

On that system, I find these results:

	% /usr/uumath/texlive/2020/tlpkg/installer/config.guess
	amd64-unknown-midnightbsd1.2

	% uname -s
	MidnightBSD

	% uname -r
	1.2

	% uname -m
	amd64

I have other MidnightBSD systems running versions 1.0 and 1.1.

Would some perl expert care to offer suitable patches to TLUtils.pm to
add support for MidnightBSD?  I'll be happy to test them before they
get added to the official TeX Live 2020 tree.

I have so far scrupulously avoided the perl language, and although I
did look at TLUtils.pm to see whether the changes might be trivial,
there is too much magic in perl statements for me to do that with any
confidence.

Hi Karl,

Slackware, for the user repository 
https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/office/texlive/
It will be also part of the next stable slackware release.

Not really, man-pages on slackware have to reside in /usr/man.
My problem is that the man binary is overwritten by the texlive 
man-link.

ls -la /usr/bin/man
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 27 Apr 16 01:03 /usr/bin/man -> 
../share/texmf-dist/doc/man

This happens while putting scripts/symlinks in PATH, and i don't want to 
add a texlive-PATH,
as it used to be with TeTex.
This is easy to fix for packaging, but i wonder if no one other stumbled 
over this.

Thanks, as texlive.tlpdb is the base of my build of the texmf-tree i 
wanted to note randomly seen
inconsistency.

That is a pitty.
I assume there are some reasons to not put mktexlsr in 
00texlive.installer,
as there are also some other duplicates in there.

In Debian I just don't install the man pages from BINDIR/man.

00texlive.installer contains only the files which are used for the
installer package. There no mktexlsr is needed. And as seen from the
name (00texlive...) it is one of those special packages that doesn't
adhere to a lot of "rules" (like no duplicate files ;-)

Hi Nelson,
first of all, TLUtils.pm doesn't use uname directly but calls
config.guess.  The CPU part (amd64) seems to be ok because this is
quite common on BSD systems.  For MidnightBSD the version number must
be stripped from the output of config.guess.

As far as I can see all you have to do is to add "midnightbsd" to the
list of operating systems, @OSs, in TLUtils.pm line 314.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    My problem is that the man binary is overwritten by the texlive 
    man-link.

I see. Ok, I removed the man symlink in TL for all but darwin.
I believe it is useless everywhere else. We'll find out.

    That is a pitty.

I agree. Sorry, but I already spent too long trying to deal with that
strangeness and don't want to go back to it now. Maybe the simplest
workaround is to install texlive.infra and then remove tlmgr.

Alternatively, FWIW, tlmgr can actually be useful, or at least not
completely useless, for distros, due to the "user mode" that Norbert
implemented. Although I guess he's not completely happy about doing so :).
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=907415

Norbert, maybe you can advise, and/or add something to
texlive/debian.html about it. Just for the record. --thanks, karl.

            amd64-unknown-midnightbsd1.2

I added it to platform_name and platform_desc in TLUtils.pm.

Also, in order not to have add every OS in the world to our little list,
I added a check for the envvar TEXLIVE_OS_NAME. If that is set, it is
used as-is without any guessing. (The <cpu> value is still taken from
the config.guess output, though.)

So something like
  env TEXLIVE_OS_NAME=anotherbsd tlmgr ...

should now have (essentially) the same effect as adding "anotherbsd" to
the lists in the code.

    although I did look at TLUtils.pm to see whether the changes might
    be trivial, there is too much magic in perl statements for me to do
    that with any confidence.

Thanks for trying. Although it is true that there are a lot of
surrounding special cases, the main list of OS names is this
straightforward assignment:

   my @OSs = qw(aix cygwin darwin dragonfly freebsd hpux irix
                kfreebsd linux midnightbsd netbsd openbsd solaris);

I just added "midnightbsd" to that list. --thanks, karl.

Both the tcl gui installer and tlshell can now resize fonts on the
fly. In addition, gui language can now also be changed on the fly.

In tlshell this can be found in the options menu, in the installer
in the new gui menu.

tlshell is not part of the infrastructure. You can update it
separately from texlive.infra / tlmgr.

Ok, I forgot to put in a warning that it would probably take a day

Subject: More on gs transparency
Message-ID: <3A6FE6FC-96A2-4D57-ACEA-A8BD40BFC8B4@icloud.com>

Today an official "statement" has been made that the .setopacityalpha and .setshapealpha operators are deprecated in the development version of Ghostscript. See the last entry at

	https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702219

The doc has been updated

	https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/current/Language.htm#Transparency

and mentions the change as effective in the next version, 9.53.

The respective replacements seem to be .setfillconstantalpha and .setstrokeconstantalpha.

I have tested the development version (downloaded and compiled a few minutes ago) with the built-in Ghostscript example (examples/transparency_example.ps in the source code) and with the attached two files, posted by Herbert Voss and in which I have replaced .setopacityalpha by .setfillconstantalpha:

- Calling gs with -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY (for example "gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=transparency_example.pdf transparency_example.ps"), transparency is obtained as expected.

- Calling gs with -dSAFER (the default) or -dNOSAFER, transparency_example.ps yields

	%%%% WARNING: Transparency operations ignored - need to include -dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY

and the other two test files yield

	Error: /undefined in .setfillconstantalpha

In all three cases output is obtained, without transparency.

Subject: Doc for pkfix-helper
Message-ID: <752A1C2A-0093-43FB-B9DC-0D52EA812171@icloud.com>

Applying texdoc to pkfix-helper, which has just been updated today, one is presented with the content of

	texmf-dist/doc/support/pkfix-helper/encoding-samples.pdf

This is not the actual documentation, but rather a complement to it, containing for example "(See the pkfix-helper documentation for details.)" on the right column of the front page.

Based on

	texmf-dist/doc/support/pkfix-helper/README

and on comparison with

	https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix-helper

the documentation seems to be the .pdf man page at

	texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/pkfix-helper.man1.pdf

By the way, this .pdf version of the man page exhibits formatting issues towards the top of p.5 (output of "dvips newfonts.dvi ?o newfonts.ps" protruding into the right margin and partly cut) which are absent on p. 4 of the preformed .pdf file available on CTAN at

	http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/pkfix-helper/pkfix-helper.pdf

I don't know how texdoc could be configured to point to the .pdf man page. I thought this was through a database file associating each package with a given doc file. But looking further, this seems to be through a series of rules defined in

	texmf-dist/texdoc/texdoc.cnf

Sorry if these are all trivial issues already discussed on this list: I'm not familiar with texdoc, nor whether this is the proper place to report about it.

Just FYI, pxeverysel is not its own package, but part of platex-tools
(already listed). --best, karl.

I just realized the existence of the web page

	https://www.tug.org/texdoc/

and mailing list

	https://lists.tug.org/texdoc

I will hence post this issue there instead of the present list. Sorry for the noise.

Hi Bruno,

excuse me, I didn't realize that this message is about Texdoc.

This is partially correct, but not exactly correct. Texdoc has a heuristic
scoring scheme to chose the "best" document for each package. Only for
a few exceptional packages, the distributed texdoc.cnf has rules to adjust
the results.

Anyway, for pkfix-helper, I can surely fix the result in Texdoc side.
However, I'm not sure pkfix-helper.pdf (not pkfix-helper.man1.pdf) is in
TeX Live at the first place. At least, it seems the document is not
registered in the tlpdb database:

	$ tlmgr info --list pkfix-helper
	package:     pkfix-helper
	
	[...]

	doc files:
	  texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/pkfix-helper.1
	  texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/pkfix-helper.man1.pdf
	  texmf-dist/doc/support/pkfix-helper/README details="Readme"
	  texmf-dist/doc/support/pkfix-helper/encoding-samples.pdf details="Encoding tables and how to use them"
	  texmf-dist/doc/support/pkfix-helper/encoding-samples.tex
	[...]

In case pkfix-helper.pdf does not exist in TeX Live, I can make Texdoc
to show pkfix-helper.man1.pdf as the best result.

Best,
Takuto

I think the pkfix-helper author (Scott Pakin) provided CTAN with pkfix-helper.pdf, which is a preformatted PDF version of the man page, to be used as documentation.

Then later, when the CTAN pkfix update was included in TeX Live, since there are already PDF versions of all man pages in texmf-dist/doc/man (I imagine these are created automatically), I think that the preformatted pkfix-helper.pdf was not included and pkfix-helper.man1.pdf is meant to be used instead.

Best regards,

Bruno

Thanks.

I forgot two important dependencies of ctex in my previous request.
And I find some more dependencies of other packages.

ctex:
    depend beamer
    depend xetex

beamer:
    depend amscls
    depend amsfonts
    depend amsmath
    depend geometry

hyperref:
    depend auxhook
    depend hycolor
    depend zapfding

As I wrote to the tex-live list, font size in tlshell is now
scalable via the options menu.

Additionally: I just found out that Tcl/Tk responds to the value of
Xft.dpi in ~/.Xresources, at least on myi ubuntu 18.04 system, which
has only a window manager (fvwm), and no desktop.

Thanks.

That is the complete dependency of package ctex. When working on
automated testing, we only need a minimized version of TeX Live.
Selecting scheme-infraonly and then install ctex, every dependent
package can be installed automatically.

Siep,

thanks for that info.  (More info for the docs?  Or maybe everyone
should be setting Xft.dpi by now?)

I am pleased to be able to report that Options / GUI font scaling / <scale factor> appears to work as intended under Windows-7 Enterprise (64-bit)

Just a suggestion: Firefox offers shortcuts Ctrl+ and Ctrl-. Could
such shortcuts be implemented? If someone sees the fonts really
microscopic, it might be difficult to search menu options but keyboard
is available always and users might know these shortcuts.

Excellent idea, +:= "Ctrl?0" to restore to system default.

Everything is basically in place to resize in such a way, at least
from the main window. However:

- I do not know how may people would think of trying these shortcuts.

- On mobile devices, a convention is a small A and a large A to click
  on, but this would clutter the interface.

- I did not mention it, but tlshell and the gui installer already
  double the font sizes if the pixel dimensions of the screen are
  larger than height 2000 and width 3000 and nothing else is
  configured.  On my macbook, which has a HiDPI screen, I get the
  virtual pixel dimensions, not the much higher actual dimensions,
  and font sizes come out ok without explicit scaling. Apparently
  these are defined in terms of these same virtual pixels.

So I am not sure what would be the best thing to do, if anything.

Obviously one personal perspective is neither here nor there, but given the fact that (a) most, if not all, browsers honour that convention, and (b) that all the members of the Adobe CC suite do likewise (wherein "Ctrl?0" is by far and away the most useful), I would suspect that a significant fraction of your target audience would be familiar with these short-cuts and would try them purely on the basis of "let's see if this helps" when faced with almost invisible text.

Some experiments with settings in ~/.Xresources (on my system):

Xft.dpi: 196.0
is honored by Tcl/Tk and vim.gtk3, and ignored by Perl/Tk.

*Font: Cambria 18
is honored by Perl/Tk and ignored by Tcl/Tk and vim.gtk3.

Hello,

(from <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/540160/14500>)

I would like to distribute on CTAN a package providing the beamer theme 
of my institute. So my colleagues and our doctoral students can easily 
use it.

This theme is easily customizable to be used outside my institute. And 
it has some peculiarities that may interest beamer users. This justifies 
its distribution by CTAN. My code is under the LaTeX Project Public License.

In this theme, by default, the logo used is that of my institute (with 
some technical modifications not visible to facilitate its integration 
in the slides). It is the only element that is not open source.

In this case, will this package be included in TeXLive with this logo?

(Note: my institute authorizes me to distribute this logo on CTAN.)

What do you mean with "the logo is not open source"? In particular,
what is the license of the logo?

Assuming some non-free license, the logo will be removed from the
package when imported into TeX Live. How will you package react to
the absence of the logo file? Does it show a place-holder?

The logo of my institute is protected as a trademark. It can be freely 
distributed but it cannot be used freely for public documents without 
the agreement of my institute.

I think that the logo of the Mathematics Society of France ("Soci?t? 
Math?matique of France") is protected in the same way. But it is 
distributed by TeXLive:

/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/nwejm/images/nwejm-smf-logo.pdf

<https://smf.emath.fr/>

I found another logo which is probably in the same legal situation:

/usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/latex/fithesis/logo/mu/fithesis-base-color.pdf

Message-ID: <r7tdbt$3skt$1@ciao.gmane.io>

Hi,

I've noticed that the LPPL is no longer included in tex or pdf format in 
TL anymore. Is this intentional? lppl.pdf used to reside in the doc 
tree, lppl.tex in tex/ (until 2019, when it was moved to doc/, too). 
This made sense to me, as you would want to have the _L_PPL nicely 
typeset by LaTeX, too, wouldn't you, while lppl.tex being available in 
tex/ allowed including it in manuals, which, according to 
latex-project.org, "authors of LPPL software are encouraged" to do.

Sorry if I should have missed any previous discussion about this.

Best,

Looks like I should remove it and most of the other ones in the same
directory, thanks for reminding.

But for one of them (useful for the end users), I guess the author will
provide it with a free license. Nevertheless, I've no idea how/where this
author could officially declare the license attached to this logo...

Hi Robert,

    I've noticed that the LPPL is no longer included in tex or pdf format in 
    TL anymore. Is this intentional?

What's in the LaTeX package is up to the LaTeX team. Personally I tend
to agree with you. (I hadn't noticed this change, and am somewhat
surprised.)

They don't necessarily read every message here, so I suggest submitting
the suggestion at https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/new for
better tracking. --thanks, karl.

Nonfree logos need to be removed.  ("Nonfree" meaning, in short, "cannot
be modified and modified versions redistributed".
http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html outlines the requirements.)

    texmf-dist/tex/latex/nwejm/images/nwejm-smf-logo.pdf

I'll await Denis's update.  

    texmf-dist/tex/latex/fithesis/logo/mu/fithesis-base-color.pdf

I'll warn the authors before I remove that.

License statements about images can be made in an accompanying (or
top-level) README, or anywhere sensible. In addition, it's good to also
put license statements into the image itself, if the format allows for
it. But since it's much more convenient for the people checking such
things to look at small text files than decode binary formats, the
README statement is more important. Thanks. -k

Logos are usually even more non-free because they can only be used on
official documents of the institution owning the logo, not by general
public.

This is true but I also understand why package authors want to make
them accessible as easy as possible to those who are allowed to use
them.

The best solution is to add the logos to either tlcontrib

  https://contrib.texlive.info/

or a similar server maintained by the institution.  The package
documentation has to describe how to add the particular repository to
TeX Live.  The easiest way is to describe how to add an additional
repository on the command line with tlmgr.

Of course, whatever is published should be accompanied by a license
statement, preferably in a directory searched by texdoc.

Regards,
  Reinhard

On WikiMedia 
(https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_Masaryk_University.svg), I 
found this text attached to the last logo: "This logo image consists 
only of simple geometric shapes or text. It does not meet the threshold 
of originality needed for copyright protection, and is therefore in the 
public domain. Although it is free of copyright restrictions, this image 
may still be subject to other restrictions."

And later: "This work includes material that may be protected as a 
trademark in some jurisdictions. If you want to use it, you have to 
ensure that you have the legal right to do so and that you do not 
infringe any trademark rights."

The logo of my Institute is in the same situation...

Are you also going to remove the fontawesome package which contains many 
logos (Apple, Github, Amazon, Android ...)?

OK, updated and appears to work, but now seems to lose focus after each font-size change.? I am running too many applications as I write to know to which application it is ceding focus, so I will need to finish up what I am doing, re-start, and then try with zero, one, two, ... many applications in parallel to see if and when the problem recurs.

One comment in the meantime, however :? having used "Ctrl +", if I then try "Options / GUI font scaling", the currently selected value is not indicated in any way.? Such an indication would (IMHO) be extremely useful.

With just a single application running in parallel with TLSHELL, the latter still cedes focus when the font-size is changed.? Thus one cannot adjust the font size twice in succession without manually restoring focus.

Subject: luatex problem with file with umlauts on windows 10
Message-ID: <1t37omks644mg.dlg@nililand.de>

I have a problem with the lfs library in luatex and files with
non-ascii chars on window10:

This plain tex file 

\directlua{
function myfilesize(name)
  local file =  kpse.find_file(name, "tex", true)
  print("\string\nFILE: ",file)
  if file then
    local size = lfs.attributes(file, "size")
    local isfile= lfs.isfile (file)
    print("SIZE: ",size)
    print("isfile ", isfile) 
  end
end}
\input{gr??e}
\directlua{myfilesize("gr??e.tex")}
\bye


gives this output:

This is LuaTeX, Version 1.12.0 (TeX Live 2020/W32TeX)
 restricted system commands enabled.
(./test-utf8.tex (./gr????e.tex)
FILE:   ./gr????e.tex
SIZE:   nil
isfile  false
...

So the file "gr??e.tex" is found fine by kpse and can be input, but
lfs doesn't access the size.

With miktex it works fine:

This is LuaTeX, Version 1.12.0 (MiKTeX 2.9.7400 64-bit)
 restricted system commands enabled.
(./test-utf8.tex (./gr????e.tex)
FILE:   ./gr????e.tex
SIZE:   5
isfile  true
...

Ascii-files works without problems.

Hi all,

looking at:

(./test-utf8.tex (./gr????e.tex)
FILE:   ./gr????e.tex
SIZE:   nil
isfile  false

I have three questions:
1. What is your locale of your Windows? Is it UTF-8?
2. Which character set is used for file names on your file system?
3. Are you sure that lfs knows the character set of your file system
(you should query it) and that the file name is corrected to the right
encoding?

There does not appear to be such an option.? When one sets the system locale, one is setting it explicitly for programs that do not support Unicode.? Thus it would seem to the case that Unicode is the Windows 7+ default.? Whether this is UTF-8 or another variant, however, is currently moot.

No idea how one might ask it that question.

my locale is de_DE.UTF-8. But the luatex manual claims that the
locale is set to a neutral value at the start, so I don't think it
is really relevant. My hard drive is NTFS. I have no idea how I
could tell lfs something about my file system (or how to query what
it thinks about it).  
But the same file on the same computer with the same command line(s)
works with miktex but not with texlive so I don't think that
something is fundamental wrong with my settings.

Dear Ulrike,

lua part is not utf-8 in TeX Live Windows. Please try:

% UTF-8
\directlua{
local function is_texlive()
  local a = kpse.var_value('command_line_encoding')
  if a then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end

local function is_windows()
  local a = package.config:sub(1,1)
  if a == '/' then
    return false
  elseif a == ':' then
    return false
  else
    return true
  end
end
function myfilesize(name)
  local file =  kpse.find_file(name, "tex", true)
  -- file is utf-8
  if is_windows() and is_texlive() then
    local g = chgstrcp.utf8tosyscp(file)
    file = g
  end
  -- file is local CP
  print("\string\nFILE: ",file)
  if file then
    local size = lfs.attributes(file, "size")
    local isfile= lfs.isfile (file)
    print("SIZE: ",size)
    print("isfile ", isfile)

After removing the two comments (--) it works fine, both in miktex
and texlive.

So chgstrcp.utf8tosyscp(file) is the secret. 

Why isn't it enabled by default? (e.g. depending on
command_line_encoding)?

(Currently the file search in expl3 is broken because of this, so
I'm considering our options).

Also for me (in TeX Live only) but the console-log output is distinctly sub-optimal in TeXworks when reporting the file name from within LuaTeX at */print ("\string \n FILE: ", file)/* :

Hi,

I have made an experiment with Czech Windows 7 running in VirtualBox
in Linux. I have copied a LaTeX source file created in Linux to a
shared directory as two copies, with and without accented characters.
The file system is Ext4, locale is UTF8 and it is used as a filesystem
charset. I have also zipped the files. If I mount it under windows as
a network drive, I see the file names correctly both in the command
window and in the explorer. I have then unzipped the archive in
Windows to a local disk with NTFS. I see the file names correctly in
the explorer as well as in the command window. If I open the file in
Notepad, the contents is displayed correctly (Notepad does not like
the unix line endings) but if I type it in the command window, the
text is damaged.

The screenshot is attached.

How does the functions know how to convert? I mean how is the "local

Yes, I think we will do it. Thanks.

  end
end
function myfilesize(name)
  local ofile =  kpse.find_file(name, "tex", true)
  local file = ofile
  if is_windows() and is_texlive() then
    local g = chgstrcp.utf8tosyscp(file)

local code page is obtained by win apis,

There is also an API function for querying the properties of the files
system. I just know that it exists but I am not so experienced C
programmer. I will not be able to find it.

I do not know whether it is possible to retrospectively change the install-time definition of the location of TeXMF-Local; I always specify the location explicitly when installing a new version of TeX Live, and always the same location, so that the location of TeXMF-Local is independent of the version of TeX Live used.? Thus (for example), I might install TeX Live 2019 to X:\TeX\Live\2019 and TeX Live 2020 to X:\TeX\Live\2020, but the location for TeXMF-Local would be the same for both :? X:\TeX\Live\TeX-MF\Local.? Clearly if you were to re-install TeX Live 2019 you could specify that the root of TeXMF-Local is to lie within your local Dropbox hierarchy, but once installed I do not know how (if at all) you could re-specify it other than through an environment variable.? A TeX Live expert would be able to advise here, so the TeX Live list cc'd.

Hi all,

file texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf (or with backslashes in Windows)
defines the location of texmf-local as:

% Local additions to the distribution trees.
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT/texmf-local

You should have a texmf.cnf file in the root TL tree for each year
which contains no definitions as default. You just add something like:

TEXMFLOCAL = C/path/to/my/dropbox/texmf-local

and it should work. You can copy the file template to your dropbox so
that you can easily configure all your computers. When upgrading TL to
2020, you just copy your local texmf.cnf from the 2019 root to the
2020 root.

I tried with some chinese (at least I think it is chinese). And
there is breaks again: the file is input but lfs reports nil:

FILE:   ./gre.tex
SIZE:   5
isfile  true
 (./???????.tex)
FILE:   ./???????.tex
SIZE:   nil
isfile  false

Dear Akira,
there is an easier and more comprehensible solution:

  local function is_windows()
    if os.type == 'windows' then
      return true
    end
  end

os.type is set at compile time and thus no heuristics are involved.
Possible values are 'unix', 'windows', and 'msdos'.

It's one of Taco's extensions to Lua which are very helpful when
writing platform independent scripts.

If the LaTeX3 team has to determine whether the current OS is Windows
I'm convinced that os.type is preferable because it's efficient (just
a variable lookup), no post-processing is needed, and the code is much
more comprehensible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry. I'm not using true Unicode programing, only a workaround.
Here on Japanese windows, kanji, hiragana etc. work.

Note that, more confusingly, the behavior of texlua is not changed
for compatilility with many existing scripts:

-- an example of texlua script
-- for texlua, UTF-8
kpse.set_program_name('kpsewhich')
local function is_texlive()
  local a = kpse.var_value('command_line_encoding')
  if a then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end

local function is_windows()
  if os.type == 'windows' then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end

function myfilesize(name)
-- In the case of texlua, kpse can't find UTF-8 name
-- and only can find ANSI name with local code page,
-- for compatibility with many existing scripts.
-- Command line is not changed to UTF-8.
-- Return value is also ANSI name with local code page.
-- If name is in UTF-8, we have to change it to local code page.
  if is_windows() and is_texlive() then
    local nname = chgstrcp.utf8tosyscp(name)
    name = nname
  end
  local file =  kpse.find_file(name, "tex", true)
  print("\nFILE: ",file)
  if file then
    local size = lfs.attributes(file, "size")
    local isfile= lfs.isfile (file)
    print("SIZE: ",size)
    print("isfile ", isfile)
  end
end
myfilesize("gr??e.tex")

Akira

As far as I know, there are no clear guidelines from the FSF, Debian, or
anyone else wrt trademarks in free software distributions. It's not my
place to unilaterally set policy in this area.

I will ask around for guidance before making changes.

Since wikimedia thinks they can distribute the MU logo, well, they have
basically the same requirements as TeX Live and free OS
distributions. Which would seem to imply that trademark restrictions
"don't count". This seems dubious to me, but that's where the logic is
leading me so far. --best, karl.

Yes, that is what Zden?k? was recommending when he wrote

That's what I wrote in my answer. If you do not want to read the long
documentation, you just look how it is done in the distribution file
and then write a similar line to the (empty as default) file in the TL
root.

Thanks. Zdenek's suggestion worked. 

Also, I am going to use Phillip's suggestion to inform TL 2020 where I would like to place my local files when I install TL 2020. It appears that I have to use the Advanced Option at start of the install.

Hi all,

file texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf (or with backslashes in Windows) defines the location of texmf-local as:

% Local additions to the distribution trees.
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT/texmf-local

You should have a texmf.cnf file in the root TL tree for each year which contains no definitions as default. You just add something like:

TEXMFLOCAL = C/path/to/my/dropbox/texmf-local

and it should work. You can copy the file template to your dropbox so that you can easily configure all your computers. When upgrading TL to 2020, you just copy your local texmf.cnf from the 2019 root to the
2020 root.

Hi all,

I just noticed that TL 2019 cautions against making changes to file ... /2019/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

Instead, they recommend adding the local path to the file ... /2019/ texmf.cnf

I reversed my changes to the former file and added them to the latter file and, again, it works.

TeX-Live is just a packaging of TeX, LaTeX, and a very large number of support packages.? How you cite a reference has nothing to do with which TeX distribution you choose ? the answer would be the same whether you used MikTeX or any other TeX distribution.? And "how to cite references" is either a question of personal preference, or (if you are submitting to a journal) house style. Looking at the index to /The LaTeX Companion/, I see that there are over three full columns of entries pertaining to citations, but amongst those entries there is a mention of the "cite" package.? I would therefore suggest that, at a TeX Live CMD prompt, you type "TeXdoc cite" and read the document that is then displayed.

Thank you, I will try. Anyway, I work in Linux and Mac OSX. I have
Windows XP for Adobe Acrobat 9 Professional and Windows 7 for special
requirements if Linux and Mac cannot be used. I do not have MS Office
and do not have TeX in Windows.

Hi,

beside pythontex I found a script which looks like a python2 script

  pygmentex.tar.xz texmf-dist/scripts/pygmentex/pygmentex.py

as out policy here is to switch over to python3, that is that
python2 scripts will not be accepted anymore, I'd like to know
how to replace this one?

Hi Werner,

yas the Py2 purge, it hit me already quite some time ago in Debian.

> beside pythontex I found a script which looks like a python2 script
> 
>   pygmentex.tar.xz texmf-dist/scripts/pygmentex/pygmentex.py

Yes, here I get rid of 
	# python3 purge - blacklist all packages that don't have py3 support
	blacklist;tpm;ebong;*
	blacklist;tpm;de-macro;*
	blacklist;tpm;lilyglyphs;*
	blacklist;tpm;pygmentex;*
	blacklist;tpm;sympytexpackage;*
	# pythontex py2 files
	kill;texmf-dist/scripts/pythontex/depythontex2.py;;
	kill;texmf-dist/scripts/pythontex/pythontex2.py;;
	kill;texmf-dist/scripts/pythontex/pythontex_2to3.py;;
	kill;texmf-dist/scripts/pythontex/pythontex_install.py;;
Don't ask the details, this is a configuration file that started 15
years ago or so, long before texlive.tlpdb times.

But all these packages and files are purely Py2.

Best

Norbert

I can reproduce this on windows, but not on other platforms. I have
not found a remedy.

You are probably aware that you can globally set a larger font size
via the Display control panel applet?

The next release of tlshell will once more show the current scale
factor in the scaling menu.

I am indeed, Siep, just as I am aware that by? so doing I prevent Microsoft's own /Resource Monitor/ from displaying anything other than a black screen !

But I should add that I am not using Ctrl?+ / Ctrl?- / Ctrl?0 in TLSHELL because I need (or wish) to do so, merely to assist in the testing of what I perceive as a useful extension to TLSHELL's user interface.

Ah, now I can see it.? The filename looked like "tlshell.td" but now that you have told me that it is TCL/TK, I can see that it is really "tlshell.tcl".? Tiny (/sans serif/) fonts again !

Subject: xdvipdfmx:fatal: invalid offsize data
Message-ID: <20200428221136.GA27009@llamedos.localdomain>

One of the things I occasionally do (looks as if I last did it in
February 2018, so probably using texlive from 2017) is to use
xelatex to create a PDF from a font to determine which languages it
supports (from a subset of languages which use uncommon glyphs).

Originally I'd used libreoffice writer, but years ago that started
using fontconfig and picked missing glyphs from other available
fonts, which rather broke the test if the fonts were similar.

I've just tried this using (self-compiled) TL2020.  With DejaVu Sans
it works as expected, but with Cantarell Regular (from
cantarell-fonts-0.201 xelatex fails with
 xdvipdfmx:fatal: invalid offsize data

The following mwe shows this:

\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Cantarell}

\begin{document}

Write gibberish here.

\end{document}


and for that the full output on my term is

Any ideas what causes this, and how to work around it, please ?

I'll attach the log, which seems to show that the Cantarell font has
been found, albeit not B, BI, I variants.

Ken, I just tried your Cantarell test on our TeX Live 2020

I wonder if you have some local font corruption?

Thanks for the suggestion.  I've gone back to the machine where I
have binary TL2020 installed, and also cantarell-fonts-0.201.

I got the same: xdvipdfmx:fatal: invalid offsize data

But I've got the old cantarell-fonts-0.0.24 source which is what I
looked at just over two years ago.  So I removed the 0.201 install
(which has several extra font variants) and installed 0.0.24.

With that, my full tex file builds fine with xelatex.  Unfortunately
the visual details of the newer version have changed (no 'foot' on
'1' and supposedly better spacing) so I'd like to do my analysis on
the current version (how the glyphs look, which languages are
supported).

I then removed 0.0.24 and reinstalled 0.201 and am back to the
original xdvipdfmx:fatal: invalid offsize data

So, it is specific to this font (and perhaps others).  So, I'd still
appreciate, from anyone who knows, how to work around this.

I'm not aware of how to access that popup (very likely I'm missing
deps, e.g. nautilus, because I'm still soemthing of a minimalist in
what I build).

But in any case, with 0.201 no valid PDF so I would not be able to
run that.

Which is a a bit more than I got for 0.201 (after the info messages
about probably non-existent variants) :

Package fontspec Info: Font family 'Cantarell(0)' created for font 'Cantarell'
(fontspec)             with options [Ligatures=TeX].

(fontspec)              This font family consists of the following NFSS

(fontspec)             - 'normal' (m/n) with NFSS spec.:
(fontspec)             <->"Cantarell/OT:script=latn;language=dflt;mapping=tex-t
ext;"
(fontspec)             - 'small caps'  (m/sc) with NFSS spec.: 

Strangely, 0.0.24 installed -Bold, -BoldOblique, -Oblique as well as
-Regular otf files, but 0.201 installed -Bold, -ExtraBold, -Light,
-Regular, -Thin and -VF otf files (no oblique, and I've no idea what
the -VF variant is, although according to fc-list and grep it
contains all the 5 files).

Hmm, will try without the -VF.

Workaround: remove Cantarell-VF.otf

According to fc-list that seems to contain all the other variations
of the font, and according to 'file' it is OpenType font data, so I
guess it might be some sort of OTF equivalent to a TrueType ttc
collection.  (gurgles ...) - it is a Variable Font.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_fonts

More generally, is this a bug in xdvipdfmx that it gets broken when
xelatex encounters this Variable Font (just specified as
'Cantarell', in the presence of Cantarell-Regular which is also
found by fontconfig within Cantarell-VF) ?  If so, where should I
report it ?

Or are VF fonts in general a problem ?

This is the only VF I currently have, and in general I don't think
they'll be very useful for my browser and PDF usage.

Took a quick look for Variable Fonts at https://v-fonts.com/ but
most seem to be commercial.  Hmm, KyivType from the link to
https://www.behance.net/gallery/90690285/KyivType-variable-superfamily
is labelled as "Freeware. Font free for commercial and
non-commercial use. Must not be decompiled.  NoDerivates." can be
downloaded from rastvor.com.ua/KyivType.zip.

No, three ttf (sic) fonts in the KyivType-VariableGX/ directory,
every otf font in the package appears to be a single weight, so not
useful for testing if VF fonts in general are a problem.

I tried by prebuilt fonts in
cantarell-fonts-0.201.tar.xz at
https://sources.voidlinux.org/cantarell-fonts-0.201/

The following worked with xelatex on Windows:

% xelatex

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Cantarell}

In the above case, I installed fonts under fonts/truetype/.
I noticed that the suffix was .otf, so I moved into
fonts/opentype/.
Interestingly, this time, xdvipdfmx failed!!
If I remove VF, it became OK.

Gurgle eventually found me some more variable fonts.  But they seem
to be TTF.  From https://github.com/uswds/public-sans/releases
I've now got public-sans-v1.008.zip - in the binaries/variable
directory are two files, Public-Sans-Italic-VF.ttf and
Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf.  I've installed the latter (only),
fontconfig finds:
fc-list | grep Public
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans:style=SemiBold
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans,Public Sans Thin:style=Thin,Regular
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans:style=Black
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans,Public Sans Thin:style=ExtraLight
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans:style=Bold
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans:style=Medium
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans Thin:style=Light
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans:style=ExtraBold
/usr/share/fonts/public-sans/Public-Sans-Roman-VF.ttf: Public Sans:style=Regular

but 'file' reports TrueType Font data, digitally signed, 21 tables, 1st "DSIG",
36 names, Macintosh, type 256 string,
WeightThinExtraLightLightRegularMediumSemiBoldBoldExtraBoldBlack

and this one works (although it is almost unreadbly light in
xelatex, I guess that Thin is the default version.

Going back to Cantarell, I tried swapping out the individual OTF
files and replacing them by Cantarell-VF.otf in case having both the
normal range and the additional VF was the problem, but again I got
xdvipdfmx:fatal: invalid offsize data.

And to repeat an earlier post, file said OpenType font data.

So, although the word on the web seems to be that Variable Fonts are
an extension of OpenType, they only seem to render in xelatex if
they are in TTF format.  Odd, and that one OTF VF font seems to be
the problem.

In the former case, there were another truetype cantarell fonts
in a preferred directory, and they were used instead of the 0.201.
So the difference is apparent and is not interesting, sorry.

Best,
Akira

Thanks.  If a font seems to have multiple variants in the same
directory, I just throw them all into their own directory under
/usr/share/fonts (on linux).  For weird mac fonts, or archives such
as old predecessoras of Noto which might have various versions, I
use what looks like the most-appropriate version.

These fonts are fun, aren't they.  After looking for cantarell bugs,
I eventually found a closed bug (gitlab at freedesktop, I think, but
I'm not on that machine at the moment) which reported the exact same
error and blamed using the VF in xelatex.

Shutting down for an early night now (it's gone 4:50 am, I call that
early :)

Hi Ken,

Thanks for the report.

    More generally, is this a bug in xdvipdfmx that it gets broken 

Well, the error message pretty clearly indicates a bug. Even if
xdvipdfmx can't handle the font, it should at least give up gracefully.

    If so, where should I report it ?

There is a list dvipdfmx at tug.org (https://lists.tug.org/dvipdfmx).

Sometimes the dvipdfmx maintainers will see reports here on tex-live,
but not always.

    \setmainfont{Cantarell}

To ease debugging, I suggest:

1) reducing this to a plain xetex document and check that it still fails.
If memory serves (untested):
\nopagenumbers \font\a="Cantarell" \a Hello world\end

2) checking if the behavior is the same if the font is found through
the filesystem, instead of involving fontconfig (same caveats):
\nopagenumbers \font\a="[Cantarell.otf]" \a Hello world\end

A full path to a file can also be given, if it's not in your texmf trees,
like [/usr/share/fonts/whatever/whatever.otf].

3) restating exactly where the problematic font can be downloaded.

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: Percentage width doesn't work with recent texlive
Message-ID: <CAAjN_20H9TbJgDGFJwmzkDuoj+e=ScRNwHECoT6s8H26az1wFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

on my system, I have a distro-provided texlive, which just updated. After
that updates, two things have changed in my document:

1) the custom language definitions I had in the preamble to define
'ngerman' and 'american' languages are no longer necessary for LyX, but also
2) the percentage definition for figure wrap widths no longer works. I get
an "invalid unit" error from the compiler.

I can just comment out those custom language definitions, but how do I fix
the percentage-width error I'm getting? Is there some package I need?

Thanks for the help,

A

Minimal (non-)working example, please Andrew.

Hi Philip,

thank you for your message. Update: it's a problem with how polyglossia is
handling Chinese language text. I'm working on narrowing it down to an MWE.

Cheers,

A

Hi Karl,

I've tried to use xetex for a very minimal example, initially with a
font which should be ok, and completely failed.

Then I tried using xelatex with a PATH pointing to a not-installed
file in /tmp, both for fontspec and for setmainfont (based on an
answer at latex.org) but got absolutely nowhere.

Since Akira has passed the problem to the maintainer (thanks!) I
don't think I'm going to add a lot of value if I keep looking at
this.
