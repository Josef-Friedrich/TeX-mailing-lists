Sorry for being unclear, what I meant was that latex-dev, pdflatex-dev 
and lualatex-dev were missing, so this didn't have any effect:

> tlmgr install latex-bin # for latex,pdflatex,lualatex

but after I did
tlmgr install --reinstall latex-bin-dev

all the missing *-dev formats have been created.

So, problem solved, thanks,

Message-ID: <CAPODyQmG9fW8_y8XvDi0n=UVceHbfqzcF5g0pHP6GkdSYiS73Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

I noticed that by installing some packages via *tlmgr install* (for example
biblatex and beamer), dependencies are also installed by default. These
dependencies are listed in the <pkg>.tlpobj file which, in turn, as far as
I understand, are given in the <pkg>.tlpsrc file (here:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/). i have two
questions:
(1) Is it possible, when uploading a package to CTAN, to attach the
respective .tlpsrc file with the dependencies of the package?
(2) Is it conceivable to ask each package author to provide a list of
dependencies, so that installing that package also installs the
dependencies?

This could be very useful in the case of non-full installations.

Best regards
Ivan

Well, you can upload whatever you want to CTAN. We **might**  inlcude
your tlpsrc file. Better probably is to send us here the list of
dependencies, or the tlpsrc file.

> (2) Is it conceivable to ask each package author to provide a list of

No. It would be nice, but no, it is not conceivable.

Hi all,

I have a question regarding dependences. I have looked at
zwpagelayout.tlpsrc at the mentioned URL and it is empty. I understand
that:

1. TeX Live / MiKTeX maintainers have no time to study the code and
search for dependencies
2. I do not know the infrastructure and different TeX distros can depend

I have dependences listed in the manual but maybe it can be done
better. I have two types of dependences:

Hard: the package will not work without them at all
Soft: the package will work but som non-mandatory features will be unavailable

Similarly, I do not verify whether included packages change. I can
only specify the packages which I load explicitly. For instance, I
have:

\RequirePackage{somepackage}

File somepackage.sty will contain \RequirePackage{otherpackage} but I
will not specify dependence on otherpackage for good reason. The
author of somepackage can decide that otherpackage is obsolete and it
is better to replace it with \RequirePackage{betterpackage}.

Will it help if I put the dependences to the README file?

Hi Zdenek, Ivan, all,

    I have dependences listed in the manual but maybe it can be done
    better. 

Indeed, I don't read manuals on the offchance of discovering
dependencies :).  In general, I never try to figure out dependencies
myself (aside from format creation requirements or other deps induced by
TL itself) but merely await author input. I cannot discern any good
automated way to do it.

So ... we have never specified a way for authors to communicate
dependencies to us in their package uploads. I don't especially look
forward to processing them, but it seems like this could be helpful.

So, how about this: if a file DEPENDS.txt is in the top level of the
CTAN upload, we will look at it for dependencies. Lines starting with #
are comments. Other lines specify package names, preceded by either
"hard" for hard dependencies, or "soft" for soft dependencies (which we
will ignore), or "package" for the package name (only necessary in the
highly unusual case that more than one package is installed out of the
same CTAN directory). Thus, a sample file might contain:

--------------------------------------------------------
# Last checked 2020-06-01.
hard dep1
hard dep2
# This package only needed when running with xetex:
soft xedep
--------------------------------------------------------

As in this example, deps which are engine-specific should always be
specified as soft. Not everyone installs all engines.

It's useful to have it in a separate file, because then I will notice
when it is updated. If it was only in the README, it would be easier to
overlook.

Wdyt?  If this suits, I'll add it to the
https://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html web page soon and "officially"
communicate it to CTAN, though it doesn't really matter to them.

    Soft: the package will work but som non-mandatory features will be unavailable

We can't do anything with soft dependencies. TL != Debian.
But there's no harm in listing them informationally if you want to take
the time to do so. --best, karl.

Looks fine to me, but maybe we can make it less noisy? hard deps are on
a line itself, and soft deps have a + prefix or so
	dep1
	dep2
	+xedep
?

> We can't do anything with soft dependencies. TL != Debian.

Yes, we don't have anything like Debian's "Recommends" or "Suggests".

    hard deps are on a line itself, 

I thought of that but it seemed more parallel to always have a keyword
on each non-comment line.

But ok, let's say that "hard" is the default if no keyword is specified
(i.e., a line does not contain a space).

Oh, and let's say all the usual stuff: spaces at beginnings and ends of
lines are ignored, and blank lines are ignored, and multiple spaces are
the same as one, and ASCII SPC and TAB are both whitespace but no other
chars.

    and soft deps have a + prefix or so
            dep1
            dep2
            +xedep

"+" could mean anything; I would not guess it meant "soft" (I suppose
this is what Debian uses?).

So I prefer an explicit "soft". Picayunely yours :), k.

Ok, that is fine I think.

	dep1
	dep2
	soft xedep

sounds good.

Here too. Can some 'official ref' be added to the TeX Live web material, 
then people can start adding appropriate files :)

Hello.

In our work we use TeXLive 2019 + TeXStudio.
On topics with some \input{} commands TeXStudio or TeXLive are very very slow down.
Opening, saving or even % command, when I do it with %\input{}

With 2015 TeXLive our colleagues do not such problems.

As an example of my .tex file is in attachment.

Would you, please, help?

We need to work, but it's so slow :-(

Interesting problem!  I have no solution for you, but I know how I would
approach the problem if I had access to both the "fast" and "slow" systems.

Have you profiled the difference between the "fast" and "slow" systems?
For example, how much time is spent accessing the drives and/or network?

Is the slowness only applicable to using TeXStudio?  For example, from the
commandline, does generating a PDF with the two systems take the same time?

Within TeXStudio for the two systems, are the "build" commands the same?

I wish you good luck finding a solution!
Regards,
RG

This looked interesting, so I carred out a full TeX Live 2020 update
and then typed :

Sadly the answer was :

May I ask if "pwebmac" is destined to find its way into TeX Live in the foreseeable future ?

Supplementary question :  is it possible, in TEXMFLOCAL, to define "fuzzy_level" as zero for
this and all future TeX Live installations, and if so, in which file ?  I find the current
fuzzy-search behaviour more infuriating than useful (in fact, I never find it useful,
only infuriating).  Or could TeXdoc be enhanced to ask, Google-style, "Did you mean ... ?"

Hi Philip,

I only answer for your supplementary question.

> Supplementary question :  is it possible, in TEXMFLOCAL, to define "fuzzy_level" as zero for
> this and all future TeX Live installations, and if so, in which file ?

You can put "fuzzy_level = 0" in a file TEXMFLOCAL/texdoc/texdoc.cnf.
That will effective for all future TeX Live installations (as long as
you don't change TEXMFLOCAL of course).

Please be aware that if Texdoc's config files exist in TEXMFHOME,
the configu file in TEXMFLOCAL could be disabled. Thus, we generally
recommend to use TEXMFHOME rather than TEXMFLOCAL if you don't have
some reasons.

Best,
Takuto

Arigato gozaimasu, Takuto-san.  In fact I make no use of TEXMFHOME at all, and make all
local modifications to TEXMFLOCAL, so will follow your initial advice and create
TEXMFLOCAL/texdoc/texdoc.cnf to contain only "fuzzy_level = 0"

On Linux, this reports

texdoc warning: No viewer defined for ".md" files, using "viewer_txt"
instead.

and opens 'Okular' (KDE document viewer) on the 'README.md' file from
/opt/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/plain/pwebmac/README.md .  Also,

$ kpsewhich pwebmac.tex

reports

/opt/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/tex/plain/pwebmac/pwebmac.tex

and this should work for you as well.

Maybe in a future revision of the 'pwebmac' package, I'll include the
short documentation in a more accessible format.

If you want to try 'pwebmac.tex', simply 'weave' your WEB source as
usual and replace the first line in the TeX file with

\input pwebmac

and run your favourite TeX engine (plain 'tex', 'tex "\let\pdf+
\input...", 'pdftex', and 'xetex' are currently supported).

Best,

Interesting, Andreas.  There is no directory under

correspondng to your "pwebmac", despite a forced update earlier today. I will try
again tomorrow.

No, that also returns the null string.

Many thanks, Andreas, but until "pwebmac" makes its way into my TeX Live 2020 (full)

Hello all,

It seems that "texi2pdf" is probably a "texinfo" command line tool (?), 
which invokes pdflatex.

On the other hand, there is a CTAN package "texinfo" which indicates 
using "texinfo" with TeX Live:
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/texinfo

I was not able to compile texinfo *.texi files with TeX Live on Windows.

In my case it works only on Linux distros (I use Debian and Arch), as 
Zden?k did mention.

Texinfo:
https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/
Texinfo looks weird, maybe in a first quick view, but it is extremely 
powerful in writing software manuals.
A very nice example is the GNU Octave software manual, which has been 
written using Texinfo, which is also a pure GNU tool:
https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/octave.pdf

Regards,
Werner

Then you'll have to wait for the recent update to hit the servers.
(From http://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/ I have
already received pwebmac version 4.5.1 with revision 55336 and version
4.5.2 yesterday with revision 55379.)

I'm looking forward to your comments on 'pwebmac'.

I had no trouble compiling octave.texi on w10 with pdftex from the unpacked
source package, even without running configure. After a second run I
had an outline and a toc, but no index. The required texindex
command was indeed unavailable on windows.

By the way, this list seems to support Unicode, so

Obligatory TeX note:  Unicode-aware TeX engines saved me a lot of pain

    Can some 'official ref' be added to the TeX Live web material, 

https://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html#deps
We'll see how I did at language definition wording :).

    then people can start adding appropriate files

FWIW, I neither request nor recommend that people start creating
DEPENDS.txt files willy-nilly for every single package. But if it feels
important to do so for a particular package, ok, we'll see how this
mechanism works out ... --thanks, karl.


CTAN: this is just FYI, so you have a hint as to what these
DEPENDS.txt files that will presumably start showing up are about.
I hope the name is ok with you. I'm not crazy about it sorting before
README, but then, so much else already does, and I failed to think of a
good alternative.

TeX Live history
https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/doc/plain/pwebmac/README.md?view=log
tells me that 'pwebmac' is available since the end of May, so I suggest to

$ tlmgr install pwebmac

if your system hasn't still caught up.

Interesting idea, George.  In fact I never (intentionally) use LuaTeX, but I did have TeXworks open on a XeTeX source file and resultant PDF.  I closed it, repeated the

Are you sure you removed amscls?

I would suggest:
- tlmgr install amscls
- tlmgr install --reinstall luatex

OK, but why was LuaTeX open when I was running TeXworks ?  I was not compiling
anything, and had I been it would have been with the XeTeX image, not the
LuaTeX one ...

No, of course not.  Why would I do such a thing ?

texworks.exe (in bin/win32) depends on runscript.dll.

Hi Adam, hi all,

> tar: man: Cannot stat: No such file or directory

Indeed, that is a left over from the man games some time ago,
and the runme script believes that the "man" directory is a
architecture.

I updated the runme script and it should work with the next rebuild.

> The full log is posted with the report on github,

I answered there how to quick update: remove the man directory.

Hi,

to make /usr/bin/updmap able to find 
TEXMFROOT/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm
i need to put
unshift(@INC, "$TEXMFROOT/tlpkg", 
"$TEXMFROOT/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive");
in /usr/bin/updmap.
That's how it's done in e.g. /usr/bin/fmtutil, which works 
out-of-the-box.

While i'm here:
docs from package texlive.infra contains
texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/NEWS
which may be moved to
texmf-dist/docs/ somewhere

Hi Johannes,

Why do you put the scripts there? They should be in
	TEXMFROOT/tlpkg/TeXLive
?

> That's how it's done in e.g. /usr/bin/fmtutil, which works out-of-the-box.

fmtutil uses mktexlsr.pl from there, that is the reason why it is in
there, but updmap does not use it.

I am not really sure what you are trying to achieve?

Because until now, i have no need for a tlpkg directory. As i'm 
redistributing,
tlmgr(which seems to need tlpkg) is not supported, at least not at the 
moment.

TEXMFROOT here is /usr/share.

unmodified INC from updmap says:
@INC contains: /usr/share/tlpkg /usr/local/lib64/perl5 
/usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl 
/usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5) at 
/usr/bin/updmap line 41

As i'd like put everything tex-related in $TEXMFROOT/texmf-dist/ , none 
of these fit, especially
not /usr/share/tlpkg.
But TEXMFROOT/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/ does, and some other 
perl-scripts from texlive would also find their stuff there.
Maybe /usr/share/perl5/ would be good alternative for me for the 
TeXLive-dir.

Ah, I had this back then in Debian for long time, but now switched to
/usr/share/texlive/{texmf-dist,tlpkg,...}

I agree, then as you did putting the perl modules into scripts/texlive
is a good idea. 

But I guess you have to patch anyway other stuff, is patching updmap too
much? I can do the changes if it would help, but generally prefer not to
add additional search paths if necessary.

That would probably work, too, and would be more "distribution" like.

It's not too much to patch it myself, i just had the impression that it 
might be
worth adding it for everybody.

Sorry, I just don't want to move the NEWS file. It is a consequence of
texmf-dist/scripts/texlive serving double duty as the source/development
directory and distribution directory.  We used to have the "upstream"
source for all the scripts under Build/source, but that became
infeasible.

For your purposes, I suggest you simply delete it. The same information

Subject: improving color stack in xdvipdfmx
Message-ID: <ic7zoqzr6ctp$.dlg@nililand.de>

xdvipdfmx has a color stack but it is missing some features compared
to the color stack(s) in pdf/luatex  

At first there is only one color stack, that makes it difficult to
add support e.g. for transparency.

But more importantly one can only put rgb, cmyk and gray values on
the stack. There seem to be no way to store also a color model. That
means that while one can define and use tints from a separation
color space ("spot colors") as shown in the dvipdfmx manual, it is
not possible to use them for running text going over a page break. 

Would it be possible to improve xdvipdfmx here?

Hi Ulrike,

    Subject: improving color stack in xdvipdfmx

I hope the *fmx developers will be able to work on this.

For the future, I just wanted to mention that there is a dedicated list
for (x)dvipdfmx nowadays, dvipdfmx at tug.org. Probably easier/faster for
the developers to see requests here than filter them out of the flood on
the tex-live list.

Thanks,
Karl

You are welcome to:

- make sure that the resulting binaries are relocatable (don't expect a
  fixed path defined during compile time)

Then epix might end up in TL. But none of us has any intention to do

Hello,

Not that I volunteer, but on 

https://mathcs.holycross.edu/~ahwang/current/ePiX.html

there is a much more recent version (march 2020), with an autoconf based
build system that looks good and recent enough.  I have no idea if it is
fully relocatable or not, and I do not remember what it entails.

Hi,

the page says that it exists in Linux distros and my Fedora really
finds the package.

Both of them shouldn't be too complicated, since that has been done
already many times.

We are happily waiting for patches :-)

Hi,

Currently I can't spend much time for this but technically having one
more stack for transparency (actually this could be ExtGState stack)
is relatively easy, and also, extending xdvipdfmx to support various
color models is definitely possible.

Thanks,
Shunsaku Hirata

If there is a newer version that what is on CTAN, CTAN should be
informed so they can move their version to obsolete. (I'm writing them.)
Or, ideally, the author contacted to keep CTAN up to date. (I'm skipping
that.)

    > - make a autoconf build system for it

For the record: s/autoconf/automake/
That's the most important part of "integrate into the TeX Live build
system".

    the page says that it exists in Linux distros and my Fedora really
    finds the package.

If it's already in the distros (presumably could be done for other os's
easily enough), I see little reason to add it to TL.

    We are happily waiting for patches :-)

Yes :). -k

ePiX seems to require c++ and bash for users. So it will be
appropriate for 'unix' distributions, but it may not be appropriate
for TeX Live, where Windows is also supported.

Akira

Maybe TL could provide all the stuff except c++ and bash, just as
pythontex which needs python, the latter not being provided by TL.

Windows users can install Python if they wish, Denis; they cannot (and 
almost certainly would not want to) install the so-called Bourne-again 
shell "bash".? Should not ePiX be re-written to use a more portable 
command-line interface such as Perl, Lua, or whatever ?

Bourne-again shell is even more portable than perl but Lua would be
better because it is included in TL.

Dear Denis,

all the stuff:
bash scripts, c++ library (binary), c++ header file, samples and documents.

It may not be impossible to provide them in TeX Live, but I think
it is more appropriate to be given by distros.

Mageia is rpm-based Linux distribution, use http://rpmfind.net/ and
http://rpm.pbone.net/ to find RPM packages.

These confirm, in rpm-based Linux distributions, ePiX is available in
Fedora and only in Fedora, hence not in Mageia.

?

Is it not the case that M$ now provides bash as some available package?
I was thinking the new Chief Factotum at M$ was more open to embracing
Linux than Bill G and this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrhoOHNOrI
were.

Whether the majority would want to or not is not as certain.  I would
expect the average M$ user would not want to, but then again, the
average M$ user has never heard of TeX.  So once you narrow down to M$
users who use TeX, you have narrowed down to quite a different group
of people.  In my limited experience, anyway.

Cheers.

It is (as I learned from David Carlisle earlier today) included in the 
"wsl" /feature/ (not package) which can be optionally added to Windows 
10 and Windows Server 2019 (and possibly to earlier server versions, 
but I have only Server 2019 DCE).? "wsl" is not, as I originally 
thought, "Windows Scripting Language" but rather "Windows sub-system 
for Linux".

I am a fairly average Microsoft user who has known of (and used) TeX 
since the mid-1980s.? I have also heard of Linux and the "Bourne-again 
shell" 'bash', but would not personally wish to install either.

I wonder, why getcwd() shouldn't use fork() or vfork(),
but for this test to work correctly, you have to insert
#include <stdlib> in the test program not to fail because fork()
is not defined.

    I wonder, why getcwd() shouldn't use fork() or vfork(),

In the days of more limited memory, it was quite plausible for fork() to
cause ENOMEM, and getcwd was commonly implemented as, essentially,
`pwd`. 

Nowadays, I doubt either of those obtain often, if ever, but the test
remains ...

    but for this test to work correctly, you have to insert
    #include <stdlib> in the test program not to fail because fork()
    is not defined.

As far as I can see, fork() is defined in the test program, so I don't
understand this. The program should look essentially like this:

int fork() { exit(1); }
int vfork() { exit(1); }
extern char *getcwd();
char path[100];
int main() { getcwd(path,100); return 0; }

If you look at config.log, the exact source of the program being
compiled, and the error messages, should be present. Can you send that
to me?

Looking at that now, it seems to me that 100 bytes is not nearly enough
to return the cwd, but that shouldn't result in the error "fork is not
defined".

Adding an #include would cause yet more problems, it seems to me,
because the system include files are likely to make all kinds of crazy
#defines with the basic system functions, causing the redefinitions here
to fail. --thanks for the report, karl.

Hi Philip,
Have you been looking in my code? I think you should be looking in the
tex-live code. 
Also, perhaps you should be looking not for code that places the
characters in a box of equal height, but for code that places the
characters in a box of unequal height? As I pointed out right from the
start, I have quite some experience with .tex files but  little
experience with the tex-live code.
Best regards,Mischa.

Mischa, I am not sure where the misunderstanding lies, but as far as I 
can tell this has nothing to do with TeX Live.? You stated "as you can 
see from the attachment, both '1' and 'a' are first placed in boxes of 
the same height" and I asked "at which point in your code are both '1' 
and 'a' first placed in boxes of the same height? ?".? This question is 
purely about your coding ? TeX Live is not involved in any way.

Hi Philip,

Well, you can do whatever you like with the .tex example, trow it away
for all I care.

I'm just trying to tell you, as a friend, that that
"\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)" and "\left(\frac{a}{1}\right)" are rendered
with brackets of different size, while the brackets of
"\left(\frac{1}{2}\right" and "\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)" are rendered
with brackets of the same size.

That's all :)

Best regards,
Mischa.

That's not unexpected behaviour. Note the denominator isn't affecting the
layout here so your observation is equivalent to

\documentclass[11pt]{article}

\begin{document}

$\left(\frac{1}{}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{a}{}\right)$ are rendered
with brackets of different size, while the brackets of
$\left(\frac{1}{}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{2}{}\right)$ are rendered
with brackets of the same size.
\end{document}


which follows from the fact that 1 and 2 have the same height but 1 has
more height than a

But this due to the font metrics and TeX's rules for using them, not
anything to do with any texlive specific coding: you would see the same in
any tex implementation.

And I, and everyone else who has tried to help you, have responded "So 
what ?? Why should they not be ?".? TeX does not do what you want it to 
do, any more than does any other programing language, it does what you 
tell it to do.? And if you tell to stack a little thing over a big thing 
you will get one size of delimiter, and if you tell it to stack a big 
thing over a big thing, you will get a different size of delimiter.? Why 
would you expect otherwise, especially in view of the fact that you (in 
your own words) "have quite some experience with .tex files" ?

and this error message is displayed:

the entrypoint " " has not be found in " ".

I checked with George N. White III and the luahbtex.dll is updated
correctly.

My lua53.dll is different from his: 172544 bytes lua53.dll, instead
of173056 lua53.dll. Can I update lua53.dll seperately? Whatelse can I do
to remedy the situation? I know to force deleting and install a single
package.

Thanks for answering.

Bernhard

I see it like this. 75% of the tex input behaves as "intended" (as more
than 50% of the input), while 25% behaves differently. I would call
that unexpected behaviour.

We've tried to explain to you why it is as it is, not sure what else can be
said.
It may be unexepected to you, which is fair enough, but it's working as
designed, and certainly unrelated to any texlive-specific code
since it is a feature of the font metrics so this is not the right list.
Fundamentally the issue is that a does not have the same height as 1.

Micha, you just don't seem to understand.? TeX (like every other 
programming language) never "behaves as 'intended'" ? it does /exactly/ 
what you tell it to do, neither more, nor less.? It cannot read your 
mind.? It cannot know what you /intend. /All it knows it what you have 
told it to do.? And (especially in TeX's case), it does that to 
perfection and in a totally predictable and repeatable way.

It has already been pointed out that this is due to the fact that the
number `1' is taller than the letter `a'.  Here is the relevant bit of
the make_fraction routine:

https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/blob/35f189ca2c2866a9ed817da1db5d0bd165a3ec61/texk/web2c/tex.web#L14624-L14627

The height of the resulting vlist is the height of the numerator plus
the shift to compensate for numerator's depth and the fraction bar.

Message-ID: <8ef6fd10-877f-a131-94c2-f65c11ff4d0d@pakin.org>

endofproofwd is rather broken in TeX Live 2020.  Here's a minimal
reproducer:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{endofproofwd}
    \begin{document}
    The end. \wasserdicht
    \end{document}

and here's the result:

    ! LaTeX Error: File `comon/endofproofwd.pdf_tex' not found.

endofproofwd.sty imports comon/endofproofwd.pdf_tex (yes, with a
hard-wired subdirectory), which does an \includegraphics of
endofproofwd.pdf.  TeX Live mistakenly installs endofproofwd.pdf in the
documentation directory (perhaps because CTAN mistakenly links to that
file as "Package documentation"?), which also implies that pdftex, etc.
won't be able to find it.

I can't get helmholtz-ellis-ji-notation to find its font in TeX Live
2020.  Here's a minimal reproducer:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{helmholtz-ellis-ji-notation}
    \begin{document}
    \heji{B}{<e}
    \end{document}

and here's what XeLaTeX reports:

    ! Package fontspec Error: The font "HEJI2Text" cannot be found.

after it tries unsuccessfully to build a Metafont version of HEJI2Text,
which is an OTF font.

This is likely an upstream problem, but I'm not positive.

Wow. A end-of-proof symbol inserted in a figure environment (so that
it can float away?) and a picture environment with an additional
pdf_tex which uses the import package to redirected the search path. 

That's an impressing amount of code around a simple
\includegraphics.

With lualatex the font is found, so I would say it is a problem in
the package and should be reported there. It doesn't use the correct
font names.

Does the generated document load correctly when you build it with
lualatex?  I get error messages from both Acrobat and Ghostview.

It is not possible to load the font with FontForge. I suppose that it is 
corrupt.

This is exactly what Inkscape recommends for including its PDF export
with TeX annotations (see also the header comment in
endofproffwd.pdf_tex). I'm not sure if such a low-effort copy-paste
one-liner should reach the median quality of CTAN or TL. Just using
\squarenwsefill from the STIX fonts would have done the trick even
without hard-coding paths or PDF colours.

MiKTeX has had a bug report for that package:
https://github.com/MiKTeX/miktex-packaging/issues/176

and Karl imported the fix into TL with -r55063
http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=55063

I still wonder if this was tested at all on our side. The fix made it a
little better, but still left the package in a broken state. Hard-coded
relative (!) path names to (mistyped!) subdirectories, and integral
parts of the package mistaken as documentation ? red flags, IMHO.

This is not (only) a TL problem in the first place, it's a case for
CTAN. It has been broken since its inclusion into any TeX distribution.


Best,
Johannes

Hi Scott,

        ! LaTeX Error: File `comon/endofproofwd.pdf_tex' not found.
    endofproofwd.sty imports comon/endofproofwd.pdf_tex (yes, with a
    hard-wired subdirectory)

I unhappily made that special case. Thanks for noticing. (I guess. :)

    TeX Live mistakenly installs endofproofwd.pdf in the
    documentation directory

Ok, fixed that too.

     (perhaps because CTAN mistakenly links to that file as "Package
     documentation"?),

My processing is unrelated to CTAN labeling, although of course it's the
same underlying mistake of not realizing it is a runtime file. I'll
mention it to them explicitly. --thanks, karl.

Hi Ulrike and Philip,

I'm currently working on extending dvipdfmx to support various color
models. (mostly finished but testing remains)

This is implemented just as an extension to the existing color special
of dvipdfmx, pdf:bcolor and pdf:ecolor, of the form:

  \special{pdf:bcolor @colorspace [1.0 0.4 0]}
  ...
  \special{pdf:ecolor}

where @colorspace is an object representing color space defined
somewhere before. (/DeviceCMYK and other device color model
names can also be used in place of object reference)

For example, to use ICCBased color space,

  \special{pdf:fstream @iccp (sRGB.icc) << /N 3 >>}
  \special{pdf:obj @colorspace_srgb [ /ICCBased @iccp ]}
  \special{pdf:bcolor @colorspace_srgb [0.0 1.0 0.0]}
  Hello World!
  \special{pdf:ecolor}

Here, ICC profile "sRGB.icc" is loaded. Other color models are also
supported. First define color space by pdf:obj and just refer to that
object in pdf:bolor.

Does this look OK?


Thanks,
Shunsaku Hirata

I am not sufficiently experienced in this field to say whether or not it 
looks "OK", but it certainly looks extremely useful.? I hope that Ulrike 
can offer a more expert oninion.? If you were to make this change, would 
it automatically carry through to xdvipdfmx (as slaved by XeTeX), or 
would that require additional work on your part ?

Dear Philip-san,

Maybe you are caring about dvipdfmx vs. xdvipdfmx differences?
These days both programs are the same (single source code) but
having different program names.

All changes in dvipdfmx will also be available in xdvipdfmx and no
additional works for XeTeX are required.

Thanks,
Shunsaku Hirata

If you were to make this change, would it automatically carry through to xdvipdfmx (as slaved by XeTeX), or would that require additional work on your part ?

Excellent, many thanks for the additional information Shunsaku-san.

Hello Shunsaku

So to use device color one would use

\special{pdf:bcolor  [1.0 0.4 0]} (as before)
or
\special{pdf:bcolor /DeviceRGB [1.0 0.4 0]}


and for some other colorspace

\special{pdf:bcolor @colorspace [ values for this colorspace]}

?

This sounds good.

What is with the resource management? I guess the packages will have
to add the /ColorSpace to the page resources?

But then how do can one get the key of the color?
E.g. how to I access /nameA and nameB here:

\special{pdf:obj @colorspace_srgbA [ /ICCBased @iccpA ]}
\special{pdf:obj @colorspace_srgbB [ /ICCBased @iccpB ]}
\special{pdf:obj @colorspaces <</nameA @colorspace_srgbA /nameB @colorspace_srgbB>>}
\special{pdf:put @resources <</ColorSpace @colorspaces >>}

Or if xdvipdfmx wants to do the management, how can then be avoided
that it clashes with other additions? E.g. tikz is adding this:

<</pgfprgb[/Pattern/DeviceRGB]>>

No, dvipdfmx will manage color space resources. No need for users to
manually add the /ColorSpace to the page resources.

I understand a clash can occur, but I think still there is a way to avoid
clashes. I will try implementing it later.

If xdvipdfmx does the management then something like this

\special{pdf:obj @pgfpattern [/Pattern/DeviceRGB]}

\special{pdf:bcolor @pgfpattern [1.0 0.4 0]} .... \special{pdf:ecolor}

should work and add the pattern to the ColorSpace resource, doesn't it?

This would mean that pgf should adapt its backend code (and would need
a way to identify the xdvipdfmx version).

It should work and dvipdfmx automatically adds a ColorSpace resource
and a Pattern resource to the current page's resource dictionary with
automatically assigned resource names as dictionary keys.
(The example above should be something like

   \special{pdf:bcolor @pgfpattern [1.0 0.4 0 @pattern_definition]}
.... \special{pdf:ecolor}

since a Pattern resource is also required for the "set color" PDF operator.)

> This would mean that pgf should adapt its backend code (and would need

Unless the new syntax is used, the old approach continues to work.
Furthermore I will consider some tricks so that both approaches can coexist.

If you can't obtain the latest lua53.dll by a standard way,
you can download it from the repository:

https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/lua53.dll?view=log

The latest one is the revision 55431.

However if you update lua53.dll only, then new inconsistencies are
expected, for example, luatex may become not to work. You have to
update luatex.dll also. So I don't recommend the method.
It is better to study why the usual update does not correctly
work in your case.

Dear Akiro,

I have no idea since I use the tlmgr for updating and everything seems
to work as expected. Since I donot use lua(tex) I am not touched, but at
updating time of texlive.

Kind regards

Bernhard

Subject: Strange behavior during error recovery
Message-ID: <A3F2C047-D209-4D0B-890A-EB1BF5141143@gmail.com>

If one tries the following test file

\s^^?E

with any plain TeX engine (tex, pdftex, xetex, luatex),
pressing 1 after the ?undefined control sequence?
error yields

! Undefined control sequence.
l.1 \s
      ^^?H
? 1
! Text line contains an invalid character.
l.1 \s^^?
         H
?

Now after pressing q, we get

OK, entering \batchmode

but nothing happens until return is pressed again.

If r is pressed instead of q, we get

! Undefined control sequence.
l.1 \s
      ^^?H
? 1
! Text line contains an invalid character.
l.1 \s^^?
         H
? r
OK, entering \nonstopmode...
l.1 \s^^?H

?

So the next (valid) token is indeed ignored, but the
messages are at least confusing. After hitting return
again, the message is

?
)
! Emergency stop.

so indeed \nonstopmode has been turned on.


I get no segmentation fault, like the poster at
https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/551313/4427
seems to get (macOS of unknown version).

I?m running TL 2020 on macOS 10.15 Catalina. The behavior is
the same with any engine from TL 2012 (the earlier version I
have on this machine). I don?t know whether it?s the same on
other platforms, but it?s probably worth investigating to see
if it?s something to be corrected in TeX itself or if it is
just a platform-specific issue.

Ciao
Enrico

Hi Werner,

    do Metafont and Metapost support the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment
    variable?

From
 grep -anr source_date_epoch # in Build/source/texk/web2c/
it looks like only pdftex and luatex.

If you want to request support in mpost, I suggest writing
mp-implementors at tug.org.

As for Metafont, if you or anyone can make a patch (I doubt it is deep),
I'll install it, but I can't commit to looking into it myself for quite
a while. --best, karl.

METAFONT supports SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH variable.
Try
export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=10000
export FORCE_SOURCE_DATE=1

I think MetaPost does not support the variables.

Thanks,
Akira

Hi Enrico,

    \s^^?E

I have seen \batchmode fail to exit before, so I'm not sure that
behavior is unexpected. But I'll check. I see no possibility of changing
the messages at this late date, nor is it clear to me what they could be
changed to.

    I get no segmentation fault, like the poster at
    https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/551313/4427

A seg fault is clearly a bug somewhere, but I don't get a seg fault with
the x86_64-linux binary (past or present). I'll ask Dick. --thanks, karl.

All fine here under Windows 7 Enterprise (64-bit) ? the initial "E" does 
not mutate into an "H", and all proceeds normally.

Hi Norbert,

In the case that SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is correctly defined,
it is better to use gmtime instead of localtime, as in
all other programs which support SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.
I sent yesterday a possible patch to Luigi.

Thanks, can you please share it with me, so that I can use that one in
