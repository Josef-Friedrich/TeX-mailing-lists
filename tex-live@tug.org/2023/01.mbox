Subject: Testing required before final switch to the new PDF interpreter in
 Ghostscript 10.1 next March
Message-ID: <291E13EE-10C8-4E2A-9778-5E2C6C5EE4C8@icloud.com>

Next March or April the next version of Ghostscript, 10.1, will be released, removing completely the old PostScript-based PDF interpreter and leaving only the new C-based PDF interpreter in place. At some point later in the year this release will probably be added to the various Unix distributions, and, unless something is done in the meantime, might cause problems with TeX packages the same way release 10.0 caused problems with dvisvgm.


Problem 1
=========

An issue has been reported by Akira Kakuto and Reinhard Kotucha to the gs-devel list mid-December, regarding the way gs may be used with TeX Live to embed the URW35 fonts in PDF files, with say

	gs -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -o testNEWPDF-embfont.pdf -f testNEWPDF.pdf

This assumes (1) a file Fontmap.TeXLive is added to the gs initialization directory, on the Mac

	/usr/local/share/ghostscript/10.00.0/Resource/Init

replacing the names of the (slightly) modified URW fonts built in gs with those for the original URW fonts in TeX Live, and (2) these latter fonts (or symlinks to them) are added to the gs fonts directory, on the Mac

	/usr/local/share/ghostscript/10.00.0/Resource/Font

The associated files are at

	https://tug.org/~kotucha/testNEWPDF.tar.xz

With the new PDF interpreter, this works no longer. This is because Fontmap.TeXLive is actually PostScript code, and the new PDF interpreter doesn't execute any PostScript code at all. So, in essence, the TeXLive additions to Ghostscript are ignored.

Similarly in MacTeX we add Fontmap.cmr from <http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm/ps-type1/contrib/Fontmap.cmr> and create symlinks so that gs can use the Type 1 CMR fonts in TeX Live if need be. This won't work any longer.

Close investigation is underway. The whole thread starts at

	https://ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-devel/2022-December/010598.html

(It may be difficult to follow because for some reason Rheinhard's messages were delivered to their direct recipients but not to the list.)

In the most recent message

	https://ghostscript.com/pipermail/gs-devel/2023-January/010618.html

Ken Sharp, one of the gs developers wrote

> The new PDF interpreter is not written in PostScript and while it inherits the graphics state from the PostScript interpreter, and copies interpreter controls from the PostScript interpreter to the PDF interpreter, it does not execute PostScript. At all. The PDF file is entirely processed in the PDF interpreter environment which is basically insulated from the PostScript environment.

> 
> If you change the PostScript interpreter/environment then this will have no effect on the PDF interpreter (beyond the graphics state, which can mean the default halftone, transfer function etc).
> 
> Note that since PDF doesn't use resources the way PostScript does, about the only thing the new interpreter needs from the outside world is fonts.

So regarding the problem at hand, Ken wrote

> I suspect the answer to the initial problem will be 'don't do it like that, do it like this'. And a method which will work with both old and new versions.


Problem 2
=========

Norbert Preining's cjk-gs-integrate script

	https://github.com/texjporg/cjk-gs-support

makes the CJK fonts from TeX Live and from the OS available to gs, based on additions to Resource/{CIDFont,CIDFSubst,Font,Init}.

Ken Sharp wrote

> Some of those things are copied over from the PostScript interpreter to the PDF interpreter (the substitute CIDFont for example but not Resource/CIDFSubst), and the cidfmap content. Other things are not.

So, if you're a CJK user and your workflow involves only feeding gs with PS input, you're safe. But if your workflow involves PDF input, you're in trouble.


All the above was just to provide examples of things that might go wrong TeX-wise when the next Ghostscript is released, if nothing is done on our (TeX's) side in the meantime. The Ghostscript developers are quite willing to help and take the needs of the TeX community into account, I think, but they need to know what the problems are, get bug reports before the release.

In his last message Ken Sharp wrote

> Well to be frank we've been talking about the new interpreter and what it means for 2 years, we've made alpha and beta versions available, we initially rolled out the new interpreter disabled so that people could turn it on and try it out, and we've had the new version out with it set as the default for 9 months.
> 
> During all that time we've asked anyone we could to please try it out and give us feedback. We've put it in the release notes, on our blog, and our website. Noted it in gs-devel and frankly any place we could think of.
> 
> There have been some minor bugs, a few cases we hadn't anticipated, that sort of general thing, but mostly there has been very little feedback at all, so we've assumed everything is fine.
> 
> If this is going to cause problems for the TeX community then we are going to need someone to talk to us about it.
> 
> One thing we won't be doing is having the PDF interpreter run PostScript. It is possible we may forward some state through the PS/PDF interface if that is needed but off the top of my head I can't see what would be needed beyond what is already there (obviously, or we would already have worked on it).
> 
> Perhaps a CJKV native speaker and TeX user could try out the new interpreter and let us know, or at least talk to the TeX maintainers and have them contact us if someone can identify problems.
> 
> Given that the next release is March where we intend to excise the old PostScript-based PDF interpreter (so using -dNEWPDF=false will no longer work), and we've got a company retreat starting next week, there's probably only about 4-6 weeks before we feature freeze for the release so it would be good if someone could investigate this with some urgency.
> 
> Otherwise any necessary changes might not be possible to get done before the release.

So if you are a TeX developer or an advanced user making use of Ghostscript in a PDF-based workflow, please don't hesitate to test and report soon!

Hi Martin -

Sorry I haven't looked at this yet, beyond noticing when you originally 
opened it; various other issues seem to have taken over life lately.

I'll try to take a proper look at some point, but also happy to have 
others dive in if anyone's able. Thanks!

JK

Thanks, but Github is at the moment only used for CI testing and binary
building, but main development is going on in the svn repo.

I attach the patch here in case anyone wants to look into it.

Hi David

I'm a sighted user of TeX Live, but only on Linux and I'm busy right now.
I'm copying this response to three other lists, where there might be
someone who can help you before I can get to this.

The three lists are the tex-live and accessibility lists on tug.org, and
the Blind Maths list. The appendix gives both text and URL for your
original message.

Best wishes, David, with your project

I guess you found the text-mode installer. If not, see further down.

The text installer prints a text screen which describes your options,
represented by letters inside <> brackets. E.g. in the first screen
you can simply type 'I', followed by the Enter key, to start
installation.

It is a big installation, 8 or 9 GB. If that is a problem, you can
type S for Schem, followed by the Enter key, and then choose a
smaller scheme, e.g. b, then return to the main screen by R, and
then I for Install.

If you did not yet find the text installer: download and unpack the
zipfile
https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip, rather
than install-tl-windows.exe. This bypasses the gui 'pre-installer'.

Everything in the unpacked zipfile is in a subdirectory
install-tl-xxxxxx. There you find the main installer,
install-tl-windows.bat, which runs with a text interface if you give
it an option '-no-gui' or '-gui text':

install-tl-windows.bat -no-gui

I hope this helps.

Hi

This week's TeX Hour starts with Galileo Galilei?s Notes on Motion. It
finishes with next month's workshop at UCLA on Machine Assisted Proofs. Its
conclusion is that today the TeX community has special responsibilities, to
help build bridges between traditional paper and modern interactive media.

Dear Siep,

I tried to find the source of tlshell, but didn't succeed.

Could you see any possibility for me to locate the source of the strange 
behaviour? (I am not experienced with tcl, but expect, that I could 
decipher the commands and guess, which one could cause the problem on my 
computer. (The command line interface works fine, so I have no urgent 
need to resolve the problem, but I am curious, why this notebook behaves 
that differently from my other ones.)

According to the error message the last command was "version". At this 
point the GUI window doesn't show any version, so the error seems to 
occur at calling version or during processing its results. There are no 
error messages visible in the shell or anywhere else.

I would bet that the debugging has to be done on a machine, which shows 
the error; maybe due to some changes in the OS (by updates or anything 
else).

With kind wishes

Alois

https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/source/tlgui/tlshell_UAC.zip

But I do not think this will help you; it is just a wrapper invoking
wish.exe with tlshell.tcl, if necessary restarting to acquire admin
privileges. If you get a dialog box "backend gone" then wish.exe
could at least start up.

What happens if you start tlshell with an option '--verify-repo=none'?

Maybe you can get some useful info from the sysinternals utilities
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/).
