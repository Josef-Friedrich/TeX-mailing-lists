Message-ID: <CAGnHSEkxj46Etf+BmQQ_d6WGQQd+w5Yyv2z1v46sWFHzajhGHg@mail.gmail.com>

As reported in the link above, there are several references in tex(1)
shown as "The TeX for nroffbook" which I assume should "The TeXbook".
I confirmed this is neither an Debian downstream bug, nor fixed
upstream as claimed by the developer in the above report, by
installing texlive with "install-tl-unx.tar.gz" from tug.org, in Arch
Linux x86_64. One should be able to see that the corresponding pdf is
also affected.

Dear All,

Is it possible to integrate lltxplatform
(https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lualatex-platform) into TeXLive? It is a
compiled package for Lua, and produces lltxplatform.so or
lltxplatform.dll. This file should go where luatex can find it, so
according to CLUAINPUTS, texlive-bin/lua/ should do.

Also, what's the policy about these binary packages? Are they updated
once a year like other binaries, or when they land in CTAN, like usual
packages?

Thank you,

Hi,

It should not be texlive-bin/lua/,  but
texlive-bin/lib/lua/
is possible.

Hi Elie,

    Is it possible to integrate lltxplatform
    (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lualatex-platform) into TeXLive? 

Anything is possible, but ...

    It is a compiled package for Lua, and produces lltxplatform.so or
    lltxplatform.dll. This file should go where luatex can find it, so
    according to CLUAINPUTS, texlive-bin/lua/ should do.

Taco and I defined CLUAINPUTS a couple years ago but it has never been
used in TL.  That is, TL has never included any dynamic libraries,
whether related to luatex or otherwise, for a plethora of reasons.

Before we include any such .so, there should be an option in luatex
about loading .so's (maybe it already exists?), and the default has to
be off.  Otherwise our efforts at security are lost, so far as I can see.

Which means, it seems to me, that the feature is only useful for
particular users doing particular things, not for shipping stuff to be
used by everyone.

As I understand it, ConTeXt gets the list of OS fonts by running a
script at install time, or really mtxrun --generate time.  I expect we
could figure out something similar for lualatex.  Ideally even re-using
the same file if it exists ...

Overall, I think just about any alternative -- a script, a system call,
a whole separate program, whatever -- is preferable to a .so.

    Also, what's the policy about these binary packages? Are they updated
    once a year like other binaries, or when they land in CTAN, like usual
    packages?

They'd only be updated once a year, or more precisely when the binaries
are updated.  There is no miracle way to get them compiled on all
platforms on demand, and I don't want to impose repeated recompiling on
our builders (or manage such an effort).  I also expect it will take
quite some effort to get figure out the first one.

That's a difficult question...

It is useful for Windows users

Sadly, Windows has a mechanism that stocks some installed fonts only in
the registry, and not in a standard directory. Fonts installed this way
are not handled by ConTeXt. There aren't many cases where users install
fonts this way, but (AFAIK) the mechanism is quite recent and there
might be more and more demand on this...

There are currently two ways to access the registry in LuaTeX:
 - loading a .so file that calls the Windows API (lua-winreg,
lualatex-platform, etc.)
 - calling the "reg" command

The second is already forbidden by shell_escape_commands (which is
good), and if you forbid the first one, this means that users will never
be able to have all their fonts found by TeX.

The only other way this could be dealt with would be through fontconfig,
but fontconfig doesn't support the fonts in the registry, doesn't plan
to, and making a patch is not easy (fonts not in a standard directory
doesn't fit well with fontconfig architecture).[1][2]

> Overall, I think just about any alternative -- a script, a system call,

This means that all modules people need will have to be statically
linked with LuaTeX? This seems a difficult choice, and I'm not sure the
LuaTeX team is willing to do this... This will also forbid experiments
with harfbuzz, etc. Maybe there could be a list of allowed extensions,
that would respect openin_any and openout_any (lualatex-platform does,
it doesn't read nor write any file), and also removing "." from CLUAINPUTS ?

Ok

Indeed, hence my question...

The swiglib project
swiglib.foundry.supelec.fr
tries to address these problems.
My current opinion is to avoid to include dynamic shared object (ie so/dll
files) in TeXLive
and  set  a path inside the TDS .
ConTeXt already has a mechanism to load dso
(see 3.1 Application module location in the TDS
https://swiglib.foundry.supelec.fr/tb112/tb112scarso.html)
and it works quite well.
A command line switches as  --disable-write18  and --shell-restricted
currently are not implemented
but could be in the future (luajittex is more problematic),
but even in this case loading a dso poses always a security problem.
Another point is that a dso usually it's not available for the all the
platforms
and it can depend on lua version of luatex.

if we keep the modules outside the TeXLive
then they are optionals --- i.e. the user chooses to install them ---
and the developer has the responsibility to fix the problems.

Would it be practical to collect this information from the registry
and have it written to a file in a separate step, just as already
happens with mktexlsr and updmap?

I didn't think about this solution... That's a good one I believe, if no
external command nor compiled module can run in TeXLive! A little tool
doing that could be easy to write, the only thing would be to add this
call in different TeXLive hooks... What do you all think about this
solution? (this doesn't close the debate on compiled libraries)

Thank you,

Why not, but this means that if some documents rely on external
libraries, users won't be able to compile them, especially under Windows
where it requires very advanced knowledge to compile anything. So this
means that LuaTeX will never be able to use harfbuzz, etc.  This means
that if someone wants to experiment on harfbuzz (change harfbuzz for
anything here) will have to fork LuaTeX, statically compile harfbuzz
against it, and distribute "luatex-harfbuzz", same for all other useful
libraries...

That would be helpful... But I suppose that mean that you'll have to
link against -ltexlua (name to be defined) instead of -llua52, because
linking against -llua52 will never provide kpse-restricted funtions
right? That sounds reasonable...

Does it mean ConTeXt users will have all the nice swig modules, while
TeXLive users won't? Seems a bit unfair... This also means that TeXLive
will have a reduced ConTeXt?

> then they are optionals --- i.e. the user chooses to install them ---

But this also means that the average user can't install them (installing
such a thing under Windows is way beyond average Windows user's
ability). Even distributing shared libaries for LuaTeX through luarocks
and asking users to install them is, I believe, confusing for the
average user...

The solution is to educate users. All security problems stem from
hiding important knowledge, offering security settings in a not
understandable way and pretending false security. If you offer an easy
access to potentially vulnerable or malicious libraries to uneducated
users, you are doin a misservice. For uneducated users reduced but
safe system is more valuable than a potentially vulnerable systems.
Thos who need higher functionality should understand the risk and
should be educated.

Right, and it needs to load harfbuzz.so... I think it's an interesting
experiment and I think it would be a pity if there was no way for it to
be simply avaible and useable with TeXLive default settings...

I agree with all this, but security is really not important for most
users (otherwise they wouldn't use Windows), so I think there is a kind
of balance to find...

Anyway, I'd be in favor of something like:

- a setting in texmf.cnf called luatex_so_loading, with values "n"
(none), "r" (restricted) or "a" (all).

- restricted mode would only alow loading of xxx.so where xxx is in
another texmf.cnf setting called luatex_so_authorized, containing for
instance "harfbuzz" and "lualatex-platform", as these seem harmless...

- in all cases, I think "." should be removed from CLUAINPUTS (as it
induces security issues: if a script is allowed to write in current
directory by openout_any, it can write a .so file, load it, and override
openout_any settings)

With this setting available and "r" by default, the average user can use
a few safe libraries that will be useful in many cases (harfbuzz,
lualatex-platform, etc.), and people can make the security level higher
or lower according to their sensibility... What do you think?

Thank you,

Why ?
Just provide a dso of a binding of harfbuzz, put it into the right TDS
directory and load it with luatex.
The points are: 1) who does provide these dso ? 2) how to load it ?
With swiglib I provide some  dso, and I have shown how to load it in
luatex.
ConTeXt has his own loader (much better than mine), LaTeX can have another
one.

Only the luatex headers are mandatory
(under windows, symbols must be  resolved at compile time; under linux at
runtime).

(ConTeXt has not this script because we are discussing how to  integrate
them into the context garden, but in principle is easy, so it has low
priority).

A dso very likely could not be provide for all the platforms supported by
TeXLive:
this means that a tex code that for example runs in Linux could not run in
 Windows
or it could run and give different results.
This led to consequence that the same could have different result with the
same TL on different platforms
(for example swiglib have no dso for Mac, and only one for FreeBSD, so
these users already have very different results if they run a tex code that
uses a dso )
Of course a dso often need to be in sync with the updates of the lib, so
this led to management of the versions for the same TL and for different TL.

For these reasons I consider a dso  as an add-on under the control of the
user, not something that TL should care.

> The points are: 1) who does provide these dso ?

Precisely... I might misunderstood your point of view, but I though you
wanted no dso in TeXLive... which would mean that each package is
responsible for providing dso files, and then users would manually have
to go to like the github page of packages, and manually install or
compile them... Or maybe compiled binaries could be provided on CTAN...
I don't know... How do you see that part?

I don't think loading dso is really an issue here, it seems fairly easy,
the main questions are (I think):

- is dso loading allowed by default?
- are dso provided by TeXLive?

I'm not entirely sure I understand... Can you give a short example of
how to compile a dynamic library against luatex (if possible under Linux)?

So your proposal is to have something like a package manager a la
luarocks, specific to LuaTeX, parallel to TeXLive, CTAN and MikTeX... I
admit this is quite counter-intuitive to me, and it seems to make
another layer in something already quite complex... But if it's the way
to go why not...

I see...

In some cases yes, but in others (such as harfbuzz) no, and in some
cases it will be intended (lualatex-platform will of course not read
Windows registry under Linux)... I don't see obvious cases where this
might be a problem...

> This led to consequence that the same could have different result

Theoretically yes, though this seems quite rare...

Part of why distributing things with TeXLive will bring much more
homogeneity...

This smells like headaches... Especially if MikTeX doesn't follow
TeXLive precisely, this could mean that the package manager would have
to provide binaries for:
- different versions of the packages themselves
- different platforms
- different versions of LuaTeX
- possibly different versions of the distribution (ConTeXtgarden,
TeXLive, MikTeX)
- possiblty different versions of the package manager itself

I wish good luck to someone wanting to maintain that! Having the
binaries in TeXLive is more statical, but seems way more simple... at
least if this package manager is supposed to be shared by the different
formats... But maybe you meant that ConTeXt would have its package
manager and its compiled package database, "LaTeX" (whatever that means)
or TeXLive would have another one, etc.?

Thanks a lot!

I understand your workflow, but I also understand why users would want
installed fonts to work as the fonts in C:\\Windows\Fonts (the confusing
part is that these fonts actually appear in C:\\Winows\Fonts in the
Windows explorer, even though they're not actually here).

For shell_escape_commands yes, I think this could be extended to dso,
instead of just a on/off switch.

Ok, so having a big switch off by default for dso is thus excluded, as
this means LuaTeX would be unusable in the future...

The main point here I think is distribution: in the future, how will
ConTeXt ship dso? When will they be released, etc. will
they be included in snapshots, or will there be some kind of package
manager?

This is precisely the point: what about things you're not interested in?
(harfbuzz, lualatex-platform, etc.) Does it mean only you will choose
the dso present in ConTeXt and thus in TeXLive, or is there a
possibility to add a dso in TeXLive that is not in ConTeXt?

> but the reference is always the yearly tl distribution (and it is

So I think the main questions are:

- can dso run in TeXLive's "luatex" command?
- if so, what restrictions? how to compile the libraries so that they
respect openout_any, etc.?
- how are the dso compiled and distributed? Provided as binaries by
ConTeXt (preventing inclusions of dso that ConTeXt is not interested in)
or compiled by TeXLive?

Thank you,

Hi ?lie,

if you have not already done so, pleas read tlbuild.{pdf,info} and in
particular "5.3 Distro builds".

When building for the native TL distribution (as on the DVD), we only use
shared libraries when absolutely necessary, i.e., libc, libm, X11 libraries,
and (except for OS X) libfontconfig.  One reason is maximal portability, an
other that the location of non-system shared libraries has to be known at
compile time, quite impossible if that location is determined during the TL
installation).  The situation would be at least as bad for shared objects
loaded via dlopen() or similar.

All that is differnt for Windows where the DLLs can be in the same location
as the executable binaries, and thus there can be, and in fact is a shared
libkpathsea.

The situation is quite different when building TL for a GNU/Linux or BSD
operating system distribution, where one might use as many shared libraries
as possible (including the TL specific libkpathsea etc., since they are
installed in a location determind by the distro).

=================

Thus I see no way to put shared objects into the native TL distribution,
moreover TL should work not only for Windows and Linux but also for many
other systems (including some ancient ones where it not clear how to build
and load shared objets).

A distro is free to include such shared objets, preferably from some
canonical sources, and that should be possible in the context of TL, althogh
not as part of it.

Ok, then if LuaTeX is going to separate into one executable and several
shared objects, this means that TeXLive will no longer support LuaTeX?
If that's so, that should be publicly stated I believe, so that people
can start making a LuaTeX-specific distribution, or start using ConTeXt.

Thank you,

We're talking here about things loaded by Lua(TeX)'s "require" function,
that looks for .(dll|so) in directories listed by texmf.cnf's
CLUAINPUTS, so I don't think the problem you're talking about exists.

And how to place them for differnt architectures (e.g., coexisting i686 and
x86_64) such that the 32- and 64-bit executables find the corresponding
shared objects?

Remember, TL could be on a filesystem shared between 32- and 64-bit Unix and
Windows systems, with variables such as CLUAINPUTS pointing to system
independet locations.  One possibility would be that the "require" function
looks into architecture dependent subdirectories of CLUAINPUTS.

I think the problem is not the positioning. We can easiky have
	Master/lib/<ARCH>/...
and include that in some way. The problem is with portability within
the same arch/os combinations, from CentOS over SuSE to Debian et cetc,
all would need to be usable with *the*same* .so.

I am not sure if that works, we haven't tried. And I am not sure
I want t ask all builders to try it out ;-)

Good point, that's to be added to the debate...

I admit I didn't have this use case in mind...

What about

CLUAINPUTS =
$SELFAUTOLOC/lib/{$architecture,}/{$progname,$engine,}/lua//

?

(I don't know if "$architecture" exists, if not I think this would be
something to create, also I'm not totally sure this would expand the way
I think it would).

Thank you,

That goes beyond my knowledge, but if CentOS over Suse is able to find
the right luatex binary, would there be a reason for it not to find the
right .so? Or do you mean same binaries wouldn't be able to load the
same .so file on a different OS?

Thank you,

Yes, that is the problem. We are not making a distinction between OS,
but ARCH-OS, for examples
	x86_64-linux
which includes 64bit variants of all the major distributions, some
old, some new, some strange.

And no, we will not have
	debian-x86_64-linux
	centos-x86_64-linux
	ffobar...
No way.

Sure, I'm just trying to understand: do you mean that the x86_64-linux
luatex binary (which is the same under Debian, Suse, etc.) would be able
to load the x86_64-linux .so on Debian but not under Suse? Why would
this happen?

Thank you,

If I understand it well, the problem is that ".so" are usually
dynamically linked to other ".so" and this is what is distro
dependent.

And there is one more point. Some universities have network
installation. There is one TL version with binaries for all platforms
which is shared via NFS with unix computers and via CIFS with Windows
computers. All these computers must know how to find the correct
so/dll.

Ok, but if TeXLive manages to compile some .so files (for XeTeX for
instance IIRC) and make it generic enough to be used under Debian, Suse,
etc. then I fail to see why it wouldn't manage to compile some .so files
for LuaTeX the same way?

Ok, is this the case with all .so files? Or can .so files be statically
linked for instance? (I'm no expert in this area)

For instance if LuaTeX wants to split into one kernel and several
modules, will be it removed from TL?

Sure, but with

CLUAINPUTS =
$SELFAUTOLOC/lib/{$architecture,}/{$progname,$engine,}/lua//

this problem would vanish I suppose?

(1) TeXLive does not compile any .so files for XeTeX but rather uses the
libfontconfig.so.1 of the system installed in, e.g., /usr/lib64/.

(2) The trick is to compile the x86_64-linux binaries on a system with a
fairly old version of the GNU C Library in order not to depend on symbols
introduced more recently and not available on, e.g., CentOs5.  Compiling an
.so on such a system would help but there is still the problem of different
versions of other shared libaries.

The only dso I see are dll and none is problematic (almost all 32bit apart
./texmf-dist/scripts/context/stubs/win64/mtxrun.dll:            PE32+

lualatex-platform and harfbuzz don't seem to depend on other shared
libaries...

one (poor) solution would be to provide lualatex-platform for windows
only... It is very platform-dependant code anyway, and it's only under
Windows that it can do things that cannot be done otherwise simply.

what will happen when luatex will be split in one kernel + several .so
files? Will TL change it and compile everything statically under Linux?
If so, why not also statically compiling other things such as
lualatex-platform and harfbuzz?

If luatex (or whatever) is changed to depend on .so files, it will not
be installable in compiled form. Instead it will be necesary to
install the source codes, each users will have to have autodonf,
automake, compiler, development headers and tlmgr will have to compile
them. You can rely on dynamic linkig only if you compile for a
particular distro.

Ok, so the consensus seems to be "no shared library in TeXLive, due to
technical obstacles, especially under Linux". Unless someone has a new
argument, I think the discussion on this is more or less closed (and
might be reopened if luatex splits into dso).

A few points remain:

- should "." be removed from CLUAINPUTS?

- should CLUAINPUTS become
$SELFAUTOLOC/lib/{$architecture,}/{$progname,$engine,}/lua//
?

- should there be a restriction on loadable libraries?

- Hans, does it seem reasonable to have a ConTeXt script installing the
shared libraries provided by ConTeXtgarden, so that TeXLive users can
install them by running this script?

- could we imagine some place in the TeXLive svn for the source code of
these libraries; they would not be compiled, but TeXLive distro
packagers (Debian, Suse, Mac, whatever) can provide an additional
package "luatex-shared" or something like that, based on this source
code? That would ease their work and make things a bit homogeneous.

- as there doesn't seem to be problems with dll under Windows, could
there be an exception to the "no dso in TeXLive" rule for
lualatex-platform under Windows? It could be called by luaotfload (with
no error if absent) to read the registry under Windows

- if something is to be made by luaotfload to cache the font locations
in the registry, to be called by tlmgr (a bit like updmap, etc.), could
this be "luaotfload-tool --cache-registry" or should it be an
independent script? If it needs to be independent, what about the name
"luaotfload-cache-registry.exe"? The script wouldn't do anything under a
non-Windows OS.

Thank you,

A little remark so that everyone can follow: Luarocks compiles the
binaries on the user's machine, it doesn't distribute binaries per se.

Indeed, but I think it's way too complex for the average user... That
means your package will remain a marginal experiment (which is a pity).

On my machine LuaTeX finds the rocks without changing anything... I have
Debian/Sid with a vanilla luarocks.

executing luarocks would mean having luarocks in the
shell_escape_commands, which is certainly not an option... But users
could add the path to CLUAINPUTS, I think that's the safest option.

Indeed...

This discussion is really interesting for me, as I am the author of
experimental Harfbuzz module (resp. LuaLaTeX package for binary
library copied from SILE).

Isn't possible to use Luarocks to distribute binary modules? This
unfortunately means that user would need to install luarocks and then
modules by hand, but it's better than nothing.

I have in mind two possible approaches:

1. use standard Luarocks and use modified module loader to load
libraries. I used this approach in one answer on TeX.sx:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/219228/2891

the problem is that we probably don't have access to paths used by
Luarocks from LuaTeX, maybe we can extract them using
io.popen("luarocks path","r") and parsing the output?

2. use modified version of Luarocks and install binary packages
directly in $CLUAINPUTS

The first option seems more realistic to me.

Luatex has his own Lua interpreter, a binding should be  compiled following
the Lua API of Luatex
Or: a  binding for Lua 5.2.3 not necessarily works with Luatex.

PS
I have made a swiglib binding for harfbuzz 0.9.40 for linux 64bit and win32
in  an hour  or so (a nice break from a bug hunting)
foundry.supelec.fr/scm/viewvc.php/trunk/experimental/harfbuzz/?root=swiglib
Of course, I don't knwo if it works at all.

Is it compiled at install time, or at run time? If it is compiled at
install time, it is bad because the TEXMF tree may be physically
located eg in Synology and accessed by many computers with different
operating systems. If it is compiled at run time, the compiled binary
must be stored at the user's computer because the user has no write
access to TEXMF-DIST or TEXMF-VAR.

Luarocks don't get installed in the TEXMF tree, so in order to get your
use case working, a script would need to move the compiled rocks in an
arch-specific TEXMF tree... I don't believe there is a more
straightforward solution...

 ConTeXt Meeting 2015 in France)

Dear ?lie,

Assuming that you might be French (judging from your name) and given
that this year's ConTeXt Meeting is going to be in France (so
hopefully not too far from where you live):

    http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2015/

this might be an excellent opportunity for you to come to the meeting
and schedule a discussion about different ways (with pros and cons)
about packaging binary modules for LuaTeX.

We've been discussing some kind of automated builds of LuaTeX (and
other engines) for a while already, and planned to discuss how to
integrate automated "swiglib" builds as well. We don't have all the
answers ready at the moment, but some clever combination of
[semi-]automated builds (either using buildbots or humans who press a
button every now and then ? which already works well for building the
latest releases of LuaTeX, MetaPost and XeTeX), TLContrib and some
smart scripting hackery might result in some acceptable user-friendly
way to get the desired functionality to the users.

You should consider joining us and hope for a fruitful discussion
together with all the "players" (LuaTeX developers, TLContrib hacker,
ConTeXt garden packagers etc.).

Mojca

Good, sorry to make such a noise now, I didn't know this was being
discussed!

Sure, that sounds a good way to go for me: something simple, generic,
providing binaries for reasonable architectures (I think people using
CentOS5 should be skilled enough to compile themselves)... If things go
in that direction, then it's very fine!

This seems a good idea (though I've never actually compiled anything
with ConTeXt); it's not too far from where I live, I'll think about that!

It was being discussed, albeit not with a very high priority. (Some
higher priority tasks are being postponed for years.)

>> TLContrib

It's true that it's frozen, but:

(a) I guess it's just because Taco was mainly interested in
distributing an up-to-date LuaTeX at the time of setting it up; and
when LuaTeX didn't get any major updates between TL releases, the
repository staled.

(b) You'll have an opportunity to bribe the maintainer with a box of
beer to get it up and running with the latest TL if you come to the
conference.

(c) It's easy enough to set up some independent mirror (as long as you
don't have to deal with user management and only need a set of simple
scrips that would fetch the package content from some well-defined
repository).

You don't have to be a ConTeXt user in order to attend a meeting.

In fact, a bunch of regular attendants who never use ConTeXt come just
because of the great conference atmosphere. Similar is true for the
Polish user meeting (BachoTeX). Many participants don't understand any
Polish and many don't use any TeX at all. It's just the great
atmosphere, discussions, bonfire, singing etc. that makes people keep
coming back, often with families.

(We also need to make sure that Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard comes to
Nasbinals. Then we can organize a "parallel" hyphenation meeting as
well ;)

Hey,

There are no .iso and it's sum files in directory '
ftp://tug.org/../historic/systems/texlive/2014/ '. Why?
In other year directories iso-files is presented. And now we can download
release iso image only from 'ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/', but there are
no *source.tar.xz and other packages in this place, why?

And why 'install-tl-unx.tar.gz'  don't copied in 'hitoric'?

Where are right places to download source, net installer and current tree
for it?

(The DVD can be ordered from http://tug.org/store.)

I'll make an announcement in other places tomorrow, after more mirrors
have had a chance, but wanted to post here now, since people have
noticed the updated web pages, etc.

For links to the list of changes in this release (and a lot more),
see the TeX Live home page:
  http://tug.org/texlive/
(The MacTeX web pages will probably be updated later today or tomorrow.)

I'll be catching up on updates from CTAN over the next several days.

Thanks to all the many contributors of many things,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] automatically print dvi files to a printer on windoze
Message-ID: <557ACA8C.4020603@gartencenter-vaehning.de>


Hi,

is it somehow possible to automatically print DVI files to a particular 
printer, possibly adjusting printer settings like the paper size?

So far, I have verified that the labels /can/ be printed using dviout. 
However, I openend the DVI file and made the printer settings manually 
to then print the labels, and these manual steps is what I would like to 
automate.

It would be ideal if it could be boiled down to some program being run 
from a batch file like 'dviouot -P printer-1 -paper label-foo -f 
labels.dvi' so that a user simply clicks an icon (after verifying that 
the right size labels are in the printer) to print the labels.

just out of wondering, any reason you are using dvi for this? Remember that fonts are not embedded etc. (AFAIR)

Hardly anyone are working with DVI anymore.

Fonts are not the only problem. Buch more serious problem is that
paper size is unknown. It is possible to use \special but it depends
on the output driver to be used. It is much better to use pdftex
because the paper size can be given by several ways (geometry package,
zwpagelayout package, pdftex primitives) and it is properly set in the
resulting PDF. All PDF readers on all platforms will see the correct
paper size and many printer drivers are then able to switch the tray
if your printer contains several trays with different paper sizes.

The only reason is that it works.  I tried a PDF created with 
Libreoffice, and the labels didn't print correctly, though they were 
shown in the PDF file just fine.

I'm very much open for a better solution :)

Did you  remove the "scale image to ...." thingy in your PDF viewer?

That thing has hit me so many times when printing labels PDF labels.

My impression was that the PDF viewer does something with the paper size 
or whatever and thus messes up the printing.  I should probably do 
another test with a PDF file generated by pdflatex to see if it gives 
better results.  The geometry package is used to set the paper size and 
margins.

The printer doesn't have trays to select from.  Blank labels are fed 
from a roll inside the printer, and the printer driver knows what size 
labels are being printed by the user selecting the label through its 
options dialog.

adobe reader, at least, often defaults
to "fit" or "shrink oversized pages".

it's necessary to check the "actual size"
option to be sure that you're getting
what you see on the screen.

samething here.

If the labels comes out the wrong size it is usually down to one of two things

(1) Papersize is wrong, easily tested through say Adobe Reader if you use it. (consider to change the unit to mimileter if you do not remember your paper sizes in inches)

(2) Page scaling in the print menu. It should be set to none/nothing (AFAIR this is *not* the default setting, and I've never understood why an A4 printed as A4 can sometimes be scaled down)

But it *is* the viewers problem, not the PDF (when it is done correct)

No, the PDF viewer gets the paper size right but when printing, the
print dialogue offers quite a lot of options, for instance "fit to
printer margins". These options distort the output, sometimes in an
unpredictable way. You have to prepare PDF with the correct size and
switch scaling to "none".

Yes, I tried to make sure that such options are not enabled.  Perhaps 
I'm better off with a different PDF viewer --- there are so many options ...

I'll give PDF another try --- I have barcodes on the labels now ...

The various PDF viewers have different inteterfaces, s? it is not always easy to get right.

The interface for each program slaos varies on each platform.....

Ok, I did another test and it does work.

Now how I get them printed automatically?

Hi,

I have just installed TeX Live 2015 using "install-tl-advanced[.bat]" 
and all went smoothly.

When I click in "TeX Live Manager" or execute "tlmgr-gui[.exe]" in a 
command line, I get an error with the message "Cannot determine release".

But if I execute "tlmgr --gui" in a command line, it works perfectly.

Everything else is working with no flaws.

I'm working with Windows and I also have installed TeX Live 2014 (the 
TeX Live Manager 2014 works normally).

Any clues about what is happening is appreciated.

What is the output of "tlmgr --version"?

This also affects MacTeX and TeX Live Utility; the file
/usr/local/texlive/2015/release-texlive.txt
is missing. I'd assumed this was a MacTeX packaging problem,
but it now sounds like a TeX Live problem.

Create a file at D:/texlive/2015 with the content shown here:

https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/release-texlive.txt?revision=36787&view=markup

(assuming that's the correct location for Windows).

The output of tlmgr --version should be

$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 37488 (2015-05-23 19:58:40 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2015
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2015

(note the trailing blank link).

Hi,

I installed today new MacTex/TeXLive 2015 on Yosemity.

Remark 1: TeX Live Utility is named as "Tex Live Utility-SnowLeopard"
- --> ?

Remark 2: TeX Live Utility Repository Address ist empty.
Remark 3: http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet --> Internal
Error ...

If I take a working Repository Address and set it as Home Repository
and started TeX Live Utility new: see remark 2.

Any comments.

Greetings
Thomas

I expect this is a side effect of MacTeX including an ancient
version of TeX Live Utility that runs on Leopard.

Please be more specific. What is the output of

tlmgr --version

in the terminal? It has to be

$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 37488 (2015-05-23 19:58:40 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2015

or you will have problems. Please copy the list on
replies, in case I miss something.

Yes, the last row is crucial, and if you'd followed my
instructions, it would be present :-).

https://github.com/amaxwell/tlutility/issues/17#issuecomment-111517743

If you need more detailed instructions, try this in
Terminal:

1) cd /tmp

2) curl 'https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/release-texlive.txt?revision=36787&view=co' > release-texlive.txt

3) sudo cp release-texlive.txt /usr/local/texlive/2015

Disclaimer: you should understand and review each of these commands
before typing them in. I tested this, but I am not responsible for
any problems that arise from (mis)use of the command line!

This will do no harm, but I recommend removing ?-SnowLeopard?
from the name.

The error is strange, since the actual renaming code is a single
line which runs on all post Leopard machines, and should produce
?TeX Live Utility? or else fail and leave behind ?TeX Live Utility-SnowLeopard.?
On all systems I tested, it worked. I tested everything from
Leopard PPC and Intel through El Capitan.

In order to automate things you have to avoid all these colorful GUI
tools completely.  The most powerful command-line tool is Ghostscript.
It's advisable to install the latest release (9.16).

  http://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html

You can invoke Ghostscript from a batch file (and pdftex too, if
desired).  Ghostscript can convert PostScript and PDF to many other
formats.  My cheap printer understands PCL6 and this is how I invoke
ghostscript:

  gs -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -sDEVICE=pxlmono -r1200x1200 \
    -sOutputFile=- <ps-or-pdf-file>

First of all, on Windows you have to replace the command name 'gs' by
something else.  On Windows the name of the program is either
'gswin32c' or 'gswin64c'.

In order to specify the paper size, you have to consult the
documentation.

  http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.16/Readme.htm

In order to find out which output devices are supported, run
Ghostscript with the -help option.

You have to specify the resolution of your printer explicitly.  This
is important because Ghostscript converts vector graphics to bitmaps.
If you omit this option, a very low resolution is assumed and the
results are ugly.

The option -sOutputFile does what it's name implies.  If your printer
appears in the filesystem (for example "\\server\my_label_printer")
then you can can specify this file.  In my case output is passed to
standard output which is then redirected to an FTP client (LuaTeX)
which finally passes it to the printer.

Ghostscript is very powerful, hence there is no way to use it
efficiently without consulting its documentation.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <201506122329.t5CNT2Ir003318@freefriends.org>

Adam and all - the release-texlive.txt madness is my fault.
Profound apologies.

I changed things around this year so that the last line of
release-texlive.txt *in the released iso* (not in svn) once again
contains the date of release.  This was always intended to be the case,
and it actually was up until 2011.  Then in 2012-2014 it wasn't, for
various reasons.  Now in 2015 it is again.

Therefore the output of tlmgr version, in an installation from the iso
(or equivalent), is the four lines (exactly four lines):
-------
tlmgr revision 37488 (2015-05-23 19:58:40 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /u/local/texlive/2015
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2015
texlive-20150523
-------
Thus, I dearly hope that TLU is looking specifically at the third line,
rather than the last nonblank line.  (People running from svn will see a
blank fourth line rather than the release date.)

My bug was that I failed to include release-texlive.txt into the
installer tarballs, that is, install-tl-unx.tar.gz and install-tl.zip.
Therefore an installation from those tarballs, dated 20150523, would not
have the file.  

This should be rectified with tonight's build, which I think will end up
being install-tl-20150613.  (Last night's build didn't happen, for
various reasons -- just as well, it turns out.)  I will check tomorrow
morning.  It's not a quick thing to test.

I believe that this is not a problem with the iso images.  People
installing either tl or mactex from the iso should get
release-texlive.txt, since it is there in the image.  I did plenty of
test installations from the iso and they seem ok.

What I don't understand is why this error did not show up until after
the official release.  Did no one ever try doing an install from the
final installer packager, install-tl-20150523, and then run TLU?
Evidently.  But it seems surprising, and makes me think that I may be
misunderstanding where the problem lies.

People just running tlmgr or install-tl, with --version or whatever,
would not notice the problem, because we carefully wrote those programs
not to worry if release-texlive.txt was not there.  It seemed like
"extra" information rather than "required" information; I'd totally
forgotten about TLU using it.  Hence my error.  Sigh.  I guess we should
change that to at least give a warning.

On another front, the release year is in tlpdb.  That somehow seems a
more reliable way to get the information than parsing the version
output.  Do you read tlpdb now (I think the answer is no, but just
asking)?  In any case, we could change tlmgr version to use that.

Best,
Karl

P.S. Sadly, I'll be offline the rest of today ... fingers crossed ...

Given all of your work for the community, I'm happy to give you a pass!
Assembling TL is a non-trivial task.

Yes, I look for the 3rd line (or, more specifically, a line starting with
"TeX Live"); note that I use tlmgr --version instead of looking directly
at the file.

I installed the 2015024 MacTeX package on my system at work, but
apparently never found time to run TLU, unfortunately. Sorry about that.

I can read tlpdb, but this version-checking code predates it. That would
be an easy switch to make, I think, and I'd be happy to get away from
parsing tlmgr --version output!

Message-ID: <3b2af4b5c85532f26438844101a3f1a7.squirrel@box386.bluehost.com>

I rsynced the tlnet dir today from the jmu.edu mirror, so that I have a
local copy.

I unzipped install-tl-unix.gz, which gave
/stuff/texstuff/tlnet/install-tl-20150523.

I attempted to use the enclosed install-tl.  I included the flag
--repository, pointing at my local rsync'ed copy of the tlnet dir.  But
when I got the menu, I see that some of the default directory names have
"2014" in them:

 <D> directories:
   TEXDIR (the main TeX directory):
     /usr/local/texlive/2014
   TEXMFLOCAL (directory for site-wide local files):
     /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
   TEXMFSYSVAR (directory for variable and automatically generated data):
     /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-var
   TEXMFSYSCONFIG (directory for local config):
     /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-config

The other dirs in this list say 2015 in them.

Also, I completed the install anyway, and the file texlive-release.txt
says in it that the TL year is 2014.

OK, I now see that that particular mirror is considerably out of date. 
That was my fault.

But it's perhaps worth noting that I had the exact same problem when I
tried to install from the tarball available here:
http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html.  It's not very cool to
have the link on that page SILENTLY point to a tarball that won't install
TL2015.  Especially when there's little if any indication, once the
installation process has begun, that it's installing a prior year's TL. 
At the very least, the file "install-tl-unx.tar.gz" should have the year
in the filename somewhere, like "install-tl2015-unx.tar.gz".

As a totally separate point: once I rsynced from an up-to-date mirror, the
installation that resulted contained no "texlive-release.txt".

Where exactly did that tar ball download from?

Tug.org does not host the file if self. Probably the mirror in your area has not caught up yet.

I always recommend that people wait at least a week before downloading such that the mirrors are back in sync

Hi!

I've installed TexLive 2015 as usb installation and met such problem:

tlmgr-gui.exe - fails to start and shows error message "Cannot
determine release"

Using command line manager works fine

E:\Programming\tools\texlive\bin\win32>tlmgr.bat update -all
tlmgr.pl: package repository http://ctan.uni-altai.ru/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr.pl: saving backups to E:/Programming/tools/texlive/tlpkg/backups
tlmgr.pl: no updates available



The only changes i've made after was adding
"E:\Programming\tools\texlive\bin\" to the PATH

How to make gui manager to start?

That does not come from either tlmgr.pl nor tlmgrgui.pl.

Akira, do you have code in tlmgr-gui.exe that checks for that?

I am a bit lost where this is done? (Of course the fix is the 
same, having the release file)

First of all, avoid spaces after backslashes.  This cannot work (and
never did).  And "\ normalfont" cannot work either.

PLEASE provide a minimal example file which allows us to reproduce the
problems.  I assume that you are using pdflatex with the inputenc
package, but we need to know exactly what you are doing.

I suppose that you meant 'urspr?nglich' or 'urspr\"unglich' instead of
urspr\?unglich.  I fear that the control sequence \? isn't defined
anywhere.

This has nothing to do with \"\i.  Look at the disassembled excerpt of
the error message:

0063: LATIN SMALL LETTER C
0068: LATIN SMALL LETTER H
0061: LATIN SMALL LETTER A
0072: LATIN SMALL LETTER R
0020: SPACE
005C: REVERSE SOLIDUS
0075: LATIN SMALL LETTER U
0038: DIGIT EIGHT
003A: COLON
0308: COMBINING DIAERESIS
0020: SPACE
006E: LATIN SMALL LETTER N
006F: LATIN SMALL LETTER O
0074: LATIN SMALL LETTER T
0020: SPACE
0073: LATIN SMALL LETTER S
0065: LATIN SMALL LETTER E
0074: LATIN SMALL LETTER T
0020: SPACE
0075: LATIN SMALL LETTER U
0070: LATIN SMALL LETTER P

The LaTeX inputenc package complains about "COMBINING DIAERESIS".

Unicode supports several ways to describe characters.  There is a
codepoint for the character ?, for example, but it's also possible to
compose it from the character U and the diaeresis.  The latter isn't
supported by LaTeX.  The decomposed form of a character is sometimes
needed by sorting algorithms but shouldn't be used anywhere else.

It's hard to find out which character caused the problem because your
text editor obviously displays it properly.  Your best friend is the
.log file.  The error message is preceded by a line number.

If you've located the problematic line, just remove all letters with
diaeresis and type them again.  I doubt that your text editor is the
culprit.  Did you paste bibliography entries from the internet?  This
can be the cause of such problems.

After all, I'm wondering why you don't make use of UTF-8.  Why don't
you simply type 'urspr?nglich' or 'Ad?la?de' on your keyboard?
LaTeX and biblatex/biber already support UTF-8.

Regards,
  Reinhard

But isn't it still two different chars after the \ ? At least that is how it is shown on my tablet, the first looks like the normal result of `` (I can usually du that particular char on my Linux box), the second seems a normal "

Oh yes; I was addressing only the issue of <slash><space>, not other
issues with the input.

Thank you all for your engagement. But you did not focus on my problem so
far. The reason may be that I did not properly describe the problem. So let
me try once again.


   1. I do not have the slightest problem with ? when using it in the body
   of a "normal" TeX-file.
   2. The problem occurs ONLY if I am using ? in the entry of a BiB-file.
   Then the following happens with texlive 2015. (It did not happen with
   texlive 2014.)
      - Typeset the TeX-File. Ok - no problem.
      - Run BiB. Ok - no problem.
      - Typeset the TeX-File once again with the bib-file included. And
      exactly this produces the error Unicode char \u8:? not set up for use
      with LaTeX.
      - Looking on the pdf-file shows an i like \i (without the point over
      it).

Thank you for your interest.

Lutz.

Nonetheless, your sample input does cause problems even using PdfTeX :

Author = {von Chamisso, Adelbert [urspr\?unglich Louis Charles
Ad?la{\"{\i}}de de Chamissot de Boncourt]},

The error lies not in the dotless-i-with-diaresis but with the u-umlaut,
where the wrong character is used in your attempt to insert the umlaut
using \" (you have <backslash><left-double-quote>).  As I know nothing
about "inputenc", LaTeX, BibTeX or Biber, I cannot comment on your more
substantive problem, but I would recommend removing the braces around
"\i" since (a) they cannot be needed, and (b) they may be the source of
the problem.

We can continue the discussion ad nauseam.  But not now.  I've found
an amazing recording of the BBC Proms in the internet.  Philippe
Jordan conducts the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra on Shostakovich's
fifth symphony.  It's a brillaint recording.

OK, since your problem involves "inputenc", Bib{TeX|LaTeX|er} and LaTeX,
none of which I understand, I must regretfully leave it to others more
familiar therewith to help you get to the root of your problem.  But as
I assume that "inputenc" is in some way involved with input encoding,
and as you have now switch to pure Unicode input, I would recommend you
check if you have informed "inputenc" of this.

I was able to isolate the problem a few minutes ago. Biblatex generates the
? in an unusable code. If you change the problematic letter in the BiB-file
manually and then typeset the tex-file once again, everything goes without
problems. This is of course not a viable solution. So the problem is
Biblatex and nothing else. Lutz.

I can run my example without and also with biblatex

\usepackage[backend=bibtex]{biblatex}

and have _no_ problem. Create a _complete_ example which
shows the error.

Sorry, but the only thing which is unusable is your complaint.

No.  Please don't blame Biblatex.  It works as expected.  As you
noticed yorself, the culprit is your input file.  Don't blame others
for your mistakes.

Did you try the `safeinputenc` biblatex's option?

Am I alone in longinbg for a return to the days when TeXhax was a
friendly community where TeX users set out to help each other rather
than (as it would now seem) an unwelcoming and unfriendly place where
requests for help are met with rudeness and abuse ?

Phil, before you complain, PLEASE READ MY MAILS. 

  http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2015-June/036941.html

I spent a significant part of my spare time in order to to track it
down.  If nobody is able to read my mails, it's certainly not my
fault.

How many times has Lutz been asked to provide a MWE?  How many times
did he ignore the requests?

I explained in detail where the message 

  Unicode char \u8:? not set up for use with LaTeX.

comes from.  Nobody else made the slightest attempt to investigate.
If you think that this mailing list is an unwelcoming and unfriendly
place, then PLEASE investigate and answer these questions yourself.

Phil, do you really think that it's appropriate to blame the authors
of bibtex and biber for things they are not responsible for?

Do you really think that my statement "Don't blame others for your
mistakes." is overly rude?

What do you expect if someone tries to help and his help is ignored
and the same stupid question is asked again and again?

Again:

> Sorry, but the only thing which is unusable is your complaint.

> No.  Please don't blame Biblatex.  It works as expected.  As you
> noticed yorself, the culprit is your input file.  Don't blame others
> for your mistakes.

Phil, PLEASE explain to me why it's perfectly appropriate to blame the
authors of biblatex and biber for no good reason.  You blame me to be
overly rude when I say that there are mistakes in the TeX input file.
In which world are you living?

I'm pissed off.

Phil, your name is still absent from the TUG-2015 list of
participants.  It would be a pity if you don't come.  It's not too
late to register. I'm looking forward to meet you in Darmstadt.

Regards,
  Reinhard

When trying to update TexLive 2015 on my Mac via the TexLive Utility i am told i have the 2014 version installed - and that I must use a different repository. As I only have the 2015 version installed this is odd. I have carefully removed all earlier versions of TexLive to save space. Ideas for a fix would welcome? 
Thanks

Subject: [tex-live] TL2015: problem with hyphenation files and creation of
 pdflatex.fmt and latex.fmt
Message-ID: <loom.20150614T124944-385@post.gmane.org>

Hello,
I tried to install TL2015 to my laptop (Win8.1). 
First, I upgraded my previous installation using tlmgr (TL2014 which was
also upgraded from TL2013 via tlmgr). The update went smoothly, however when
I tried to pdflatex a file, I got an error message about pdflatex not
matching pdftex.pool. 
As I couldn't figure out what the message meant, I decided to install a new
copy after I uninstalled TL2014. I used both the net-install method and also
 the iso image method. Each time, at the stage of creation of the various
formats, I got the error message that 13 formats were not created. 
When I tried to latex and/or pdflatex any file (from the command line) I got
the error message that pdflatex.fmt and/or latex.fmt did not exist.

After digging in the logs, it turned out that the fmtutil utility couldn't
find various hyphenation files named dehypht-x-2008-06-18.* and so couldn't
create the format files. From what I saw TL2015 has newer versions of these
files named dehypht-x-2014-05-21.* all contained in the directory 
\tex\generic\dehyph-exptl. 
I copied the directory to my personal texmf tree, renamed the files, and
rerun fmtutil. This time everything went well. 
However, I am wondering why all this happened. Is there some other remain of
my previous installation that created the problem?

Thanks for any info,
Gregory

Phil, this is
1) not texhax
2) people here are friendly, but expect a certain level of cooperation
3) we are not here to fulfil your very specific expectations.

And from now please stop calling other members who try to explain and
help strange names. You are helping the community much less with
your useless comments than Reinhard with his trial to explain
everything.

Yes, that is probably the problem.

You could run check for the generated log files, or run
	fmtutil-sys --by-fmt latex
and check the log files *which* files are actually used.

My guess is that there are some remainders of language.dat or similar
hanging around

Howdy,

Just to be sure what does System Preferences->TeX Distribution Preference Pane say is your active distribution.

We warn folks that it takes quite a while before the MacTeX-2015 package gets distributed to all of the repositories. I still see multiple repositories with the MacTeX-2014 distribution.

Also note that there will be an updated version of MacTeX-2015, that has been submitted for distribution, and that will then take additional time to get distributed to the repositories.

Finally, unless you are low on disk space, there is no reason to remove previous versions of TeX Live since that Preference Pane allows you to switch between multiple distribution. It is always safest to install the new version and use it for a while to make sure that there aren't any incompatibilities between any crucial documents you are working on and updated packages, etc., in the latest version of TeX Live.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

If the TeX-Live list is "friendly", then I would hate to participate in
one that is unfriendly. There are a few invariably friendly contributors
(and I single out Akira-san as a paragon of politeness, although a few
others get very close), but unfortunately there are also a number of
contributors who can be relied upon to be acerbic, aggressive, abrasive
and intolerant.

> 3) we are not here to fulfil your very specific expectations.

There is no "we"; there are people with problems, and people who can
help with those problems. Some unfailingly attempt to do so in a
friendly and helpful manner; some usually attempt to help in such a
manner, but become exasperated when the information they seek is not
forthcoming, or when they believe (rightly or wrongly) that the
questioner is not understanding their replies, and allow that
exasperation to come through in their replies; and there are some who
simply make me ashamed to be a member of this community.

> And from now please stop calling other members who try to explain and

You must be confusing me with someone else -- I have called no-one
names, strange or otherwise. I have simply expressed a heartfelt wish
that all questions should be answered with politeness and respect, a
wish that in two occasions in the last 24 hours has been honoured more
in the breach than in the observance.

What I believe is that before anyone posts a reply, they should apply
the "bnb" test : that is, they should re-read their words and then ask
themselves "would Barbara Beeton, who has helped more TeX users than
most of us have had hot dinners, have written what I am about to
post ?". If the answer is "no", then it should not be sent -- it should
be re-written it in a /helpful/ way that neither sets out to demonstrate
that the question/questioner is stupid, nor sets out to demonstrate the
author's intellectual superiority.

I hear your opinion; I prefer to leave the judgement to those whose
opinions I respect.

This is becoming a problem of many forums. People searching help think
that all other people are clairvoyants who are able to answer even
questions that have not been asked. What I have seen is that a problem
was mentioned without presenting the real code. Other people claimed
that similar code runs perfectly. Then instead of presenting the
failing code some software tools were deliberatelly declared buggy
without demonstrating a bug. Do you consider such behaviour as
searching for help?

It happend to me that someone asked me for help. I wanted to see a
demonstratin of the bug and I received 300+ pages of code. I have
never answered, I have no time to read 300+ pages. I have also
received a bug report. I asked for a sample and I received about 50
lines of code. It took me some time but I was able to find the source
of the problem and I helped. In the third case I got to know that
someone says that my package does not work aty all. I contacted that
person, asked for a sample code and found a clash with another
package. I have modified my package and the problem disappeared. Cases
2 and 3 were useful both for me and for the person seeking help. Now,
am I impolite because I refused to read 300+ pages of code in my
leisure time?

What can we do if the failing code is not presented? If you can, it is
your turn to show that you are more polite and answer. However, I have
not seen your answer either. If you look at any bugzilla, you will see
that the instructions say that it is necessary to give an exact
sequence of steps to reproduce the error. It is not possible to help
without these steps.

Not biblatex. biber translates the latex commands to utf8.  And it
is biber that produce the dotless i + combining accent which
pdflatex can't handle.

Hi,

I ran TLU a number of times during the early pretest period,
but then ran into the habit of using directly tlmgr for upgrades
as I had to do this both on a Mac and on a GNU/Linux and
wanted to keep my work flow identical

I have followed Adam's procedure described earlier in this
thread and I confirm I could then run successfully TLU on TL2015
after that. 

This is with TLU 1.21 (I had TLU 1.19 but upgraded
as soon as I hit the problem solved in this thread; there was also
the problem that I had TLU still configured with the pre-test mirror,
but as I was reading the solution simultaneously
in my mail reader I am not sure now about the order of events)

this is on a mac os mavericks

thanks

Jean-Fran?ois

You might wanna give the archive a bit less generic term than 
`Archiv.zip`. Please call it `lutzBiblatexDiacritic.zip` (or something 
similar but saying something about the content).

Why? In both TL 2014 and 2015 t1enc.def contains:

\DeclareTextComposite{\"}{T1}{i}{239}
\DeclareTextComposite{\"}{T1}{\i}{239}

Hence both \"i and \"{\i} generate the same glyph.

It has nothing to do with latex and inputenc. The problem is with
biber. biber reads the bib and creates the bbl, and in the course
translates the commands to utf8 chars. \"a -> ?, and
Ad{\'e}la{\"\i}de is converted to Ad?la??de.

There has been other problem reports with the new biber regarding
this translation. Normally is it better to use utf8 in the bib
instead of commands.

Running the follwing

Will produce in the bbl-file:

Looking closer at the brced one:

utf8.def complaining about the latter.

Subject: [tex-live] fmtutil: can't enable/disable formats
Message-ID: <557DF8D9.8070802@gmail.com>

I'm having problems with fmtutil on Cygwin.  Since no one else has 
reported this, I assume it's a local problem.  But I'm not literate in 
Perl, so I hope someone can help me track this down.  I'm using version 
r37190 of fmtutil.  Here's what happens when I try to disable a format:

$ fmtutil-sys --disablefmt pdftex
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence 
order):
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf file for writing 
changes:

/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/fmtutil line 680.

/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/fmtutil line 707.
fmtutil [WARNING]: Format  is not defined.
fmtutil [WARNING]: Cannot (de)activate it.


If I disable the format by editing 
/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf and then try to 
enable it, I get the following:

$ fmtutil-sys --enablefmt pdftex

Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.

Ken

P.S. As far as I can tell, fmtutil works fine for actually creating 
formats.  For example, 'fmtutil-sys --all' and 'fmtutil-sys --byfmt 
pdftex' do create formats.  It's only enabling and disabling that are 
not working for me.

P.P.S.  I've tried both perl-5.14.3 and perl-5.22.0, with the same results.

It is difficult to diagnose the problem without a sample file but I
suspect you have not noticed the change in the format in TL2015, there
is a mandatory space between #! and the format name.

I did leave a space.  And in any case, this wouldn't explain the problem 
with *disabling* a format.

I'm attaching my /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf 
(after manually disabling pdftex.)

# Originally written by Thomas Esser, 1998. Public domain.
#
# As of TeX Live 2015, fmtutil reads *all* fmtutil.cnf files found.
# Consequently, any manual edits of this file (fmtutil.cnf in the 
# TEXMFDIST tree) will be lost on update. So don't do that.
#
# For guidance on how to achieve local configurations, see the man
# page of fmtutil, or the output of fmtutil --help.
#
# The format of the table is:
#
# format  engine  pattern-file  arguments
#
# The last "argument" must be the name of the file on which to run
# the ini-engine (such as initex).  If the ini-engine is e-TeX, and the
# e-TeX extensions should be enabled, the filename must be prefixed with
# a * character; this is essentially equivalent to the -etex option.
# 
# fmtutil always passes the -ini option to the engine.
# If no pattern-file is desired, use -.
# Either spaces or tabs can be used as separators.
# 
# Other notes:
# 1) tex and amstex just load hyphen.tex. No customization.
#    You can have your own customized (via babel's hyphen.cfg)
#    formats on top of plain by using "bplain.tex" instead of
#    plain.tex (e.g., bplain.ini file for bplain format).
#
# 2) etex-based formats load language.def, not language.dat.
#
# 3) The symbolic link to the right engines (e.g. bplain -> tex)
#    is generated by the "texlinks" script.
# 
# 4) usual comments start with "# ", whereas disabled configurations

Thanks, I will look into that.

Probably I never tested the calls to --enablefmt and --disablefmt.

I will check.

Both bugs fixed - now --enablefmt and --disablefmt should work again.

You were right. It was an old language.dat in my personal texmf tree
that had dehypht-x-2008-06-18 marked as the latest hyphenation file for
german. I removed it, together with every other configuration file in my
personal texmf, and re-created the formats without any problem.

Thanks!

Since TL2015 have just been released, you probably should not be getting more updated for TL 2014.

Message-ID: <r43lp9zee22s$.dlg@nililand.de>


I tried to update tcolorbox while the documentation was blocked in
the adobe reader. So the installation failed. 
That's not a problem and easy to repair by restarting with
??reinstall?forcibly?removed, but I wonder a bit about the messages
of tlmgr:

Installation of new version of tcolorbox did fail, trying to unwind.
xzdec: (stdin): Unexpected end of input
Cannot open tlpobj file:
D:/texlive/2015/tlpkg/tlpobj/tcolorbox.tlpobj at D:/tex
live/2015/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 74.


Does the "Unexpected end of input" indicates a problem?

Subject: [tex-live] Undocumented change in fmtutil --enablefmt/--disablefmt
Message-ID: <5580040A.4000409@gmail.com>

In TL2014, the commands 'fmtutil-sys --enablefmt cont-en' and 'fmtutil-sys 
--disablefmt cont-en' would enable/disable both cont-en formats (one with engine 
pdftex, the other with engine xetex).

This has changed in TL2015:

$ fmtutil-sys --enablefmt cont-en
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence order):
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf file for writing changes:
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil [WARNING]: More engines given for format cont-en.
fmtutil [WARNING]: Please specify one of the engines: xetex pdftex
fmtutil [WARNING]: No changes done.

Neither the error message nor the fmtutil help text explains *how* to specify 
the engine (by using the syntax "format/engine").  I suggest adding this 
information.  In the case of the help text, you should probably mention both

   --enablefmt FORMATNAME

and

   --enablefmt FORMATNAME/ENGINENAME

and say that the second form is mandatory if FORMATNAME occurs in fmtutil.cnf 
with more than one engine.

I have not tried but it may be the same with pdfcsplain, we have
formats for three engines but the formats share the same name:

Yes, it is the same.  I should have made it clear that I was just using cont-en 
as an example.

the manual still implies it is 200  but it doesn't really matter
as it was a spurious value before and it'll be gone next time
(0.)80 is the luatex version number

the manual says:


The pdfTEX related primitives will be removed from versions after
0.80. All the version related details
are available in the status table at the Lua end, for instance one can say:
\let\pdftexbanner \luatexbanner
\let\pdftexversion \luatexversion
\let\pdftexrevision\luatexrevision
if these are really needed in a macro package.

Is the following output better:
	fmtutil [WARNING]: More engines given for format cont-en.
	fmtutil [WARNING]: Possible engines: xetex pdftex
	fmtutil [WARNING]: Please select one by passing in cont-en/ENGINE
	fmtutil [WARNING]: No changes done.

This part of the help text:
  --enablefmt FORMATNAME[/ENGINE] enable formatname in config file
  --disablefmt FORMATNAME[/ENGINE] disable formatname in config file
                             If more formats share the same name but have
                             different engines, the ENGINE parameter is 
                             obligatory.


Does this satsify your needs?

Hmm, that means that prior to the update a backup was made
(that is *always* done independent of the backup setting)
but somehow the create .tar.xz could not be unpacked again with xz.

This *IS* strange indeed ...

If this is repeatable, it would be nice to track this down. 
My guess is that due to the acroread locking also the creation of
the backup failed, although this sounds strange...

SOrry, yes that is the case, especially with slow computers. The reason
is that every character is separately checked and a long list of checks
is done for each character to immediately show the list of matching
packages.

I don't know how I can make this faster.

Could it make sense to start with the matching only after at least three
characters have been entered?

Maybe... I am not a Windows expert but in past years we had an XLS
table on a shared drive. If it was open by someone, it was not
accessible by other people even in read only mode. It is thus possible
that acroread does not allow copyin an open PDF.

I'm not really surprised that tlmgr couldn't reinstall the backup --
after all the pdf of the doc was still locked.

I think I have seen this already on other occasions (I often forget
open documentations ...). At the next update I will try to remember
to force the failure. 

The backup seemed to be ok, tlmgr didn't complain and started the
installation of packages until it failed a nr. 5:

[ 5/19, 00:19/00:58] update: tcolorbox [3589k] (37258 -> 37530) ...

There is a good reason why most Windows installers tell you to close
all applications before running the installer.  Just because you can
get away with leaving apps open 99.9% of the time doesn't mean
you can't encounter big problems the other 0.1% of the time.

AFAIK even Acrobat Reader can be scripted but you should ask Windows
experts, not TeX Live maintainers. Windows experts can give you more
valuable Windows specific answers.

Subject: [tex-live] rotating column conent of a twocolumn document
Message-ID: <5581653A.2040804@gartencenter-vaehning.de>

Hi,

I'm trying to get the content within the columns of a twocolumn document 
rotated by 90 degrees.  The document goes like this:


\documentclass[10pt, twocolumn]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[paperwidth=86mm, paperheight=83mm, top=2mm, bottom=2mm, 
left=2.5mm, right=2.5mm]{geometry}
\usepackage{pst-barcode}
\setlength{\columnsep}{3mm}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\begin{document}

\par foo bar text
\vspace{0.3in} \par asdf laskfsd \psbarcode{content of 
qrcode}{height=0.35 width=0.35}{qrcode}
\par {\bf asdf, xcas}

\newpage

\par foo bar text
\vspace{0.3in} \par asdf laskfsd \psbarcode{content of 
qrcode}{height=0.35 width=0.35}{qrcode}
\par {\bf asdf, xcas}

\end{document}


The "paper" printed on is labels, i. e. two lables side by side.  Each 
page spans two labels, hence each column is printed onto one label.

That makes for rather high, while narrow, labels.  I would like to 
rotate the content of each column by 90 degrees.  This would make the 
label wide and not too high:  The physical label can be rotated 
physically when attaching it to something.

So far, I have tried the 'rotating' and 'scape' package, without succes: 
  It's possible to get a rotation by some angle, like 45 degrees, but 
not 90.

Subject: [tex-live] source build: context --version complains about unknown
	script
Message-ID: <20150616234555.GA21410@milliways>

Hi,

I am one of those people who is anal enough to build everything from
source "because we can".  I also try to maintain texlive at beyond
linuxfromscratch [ 'BLFS' ] and for that I have some test scripts to
check if things are working, driven by a configure script so that I
do not try to run tests which will not work.

One of the problems I had in the past year was broken verions of
context (when I tried my tests in distro installs under qemu), and I
worked around that by checking that 'context --version' would
succeed.  I've just built 2015 for the first time, and was
astonished to see that this failed.  Running 'context --version'
from the command line I see:

mtxrun          | unknown script 'context.lua' or 'mtx-context.lua

Using find, I can see that I do have an mtx-context.lua in
texmf-dist/scripts/context/ula/ : do I need to run a command,
perhaps mtxrun with a particular argument, to make context usable ?

TIA

Why are you using twocolumn mode when you actually want the text in
the second column simply below the text from the first column?

Dear Tom,

after installing TeXlive 2015 some of our users complained about a
problem with dvips. The resulting PostScript files could not be
rendered due to a missing macro (startTexFig).

I created a patch file which adds the definition (from TeXlive 2014)
to the corresponding prologue in texmf-dist/dvips/base/special.pro
(see attachment). I did not find a CI system to make a pull request -
so I?m sending the patch file to you as the maintainer of the original
Dvips program.

If the patch is ok for you, it would be nice if it could be merged
into the next dvips package update.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Josef

Nobody told me that context uses a different list - sorry for asking
here.  In case anybody hits the same problem, 'mtxrun --generate'.

That's because there are two labels side by side spooled up on a big 
roll from which they are being fed into the printer.  The labels cannot 
be physically turned before printing them.  The size of one page in 
latex is of the height of one label and of the width of two labels (plus 
margins).

Using twocolumn, I can print on the left side and on the right side of 
the page just in the way the labels are physically (and the data is) 
arranged.  The content of the right (second) column must not be below 
the content of the left (first) column but to the right of the left column.

Left and right column have different content, and each page (i. e. pair 
of columns) has different content.  The content of each pair comes from 
a single row of a table in a database.

Under these conditions, do you see a way to print the labels side by 
side as required when printing them top-down without rotation instead of 
printing left-right, using two columns?  Perhaps is possible --- though 
I can't imagine atm how that could be done --- yet probably not without 
making the printing algorythm hilariously complicated.

If you always get a pair of labels, you can do something like that
(without twocolumn but with the rotating package):

\hbox to \linewidth{%
\vbox to \textheight{\hsize .5\linewidth
  \begin{sideways}Label 1\end{sideways}}\hss
\vbox to \textheight{\hsize .5\linewidth
  \begin{sideways}Label 2\end{sideways}}}

You will have to insert some \hskip's, \vskip's and/or \centering into
the \vbox's in order to position the labels nicely.

I don't understand your description. But imho you are wrong. If you
can put your data side-by-side in two column you can also put them
one below the other.

Hi Tom (and Josef) - sorry for not explicitly reporting this to you.

The discussion was a post on tex-live:
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2015-April/036489.html
(followed by two replies from me, the first of which is about something
else, the second mentions psfig).

There was no option to not remove the macro, what with the explicit
"don't take money" provision.  I would have removed it myself long ago
if I had noticed it.

Since psfig itself was removed from TeX Live eight years ago (for the
same reason, as I recall), I didn't think it was necessary to note this
subsidiary thing in the publicized change list.  Sorry about that.

If you have any interest in trying to track down Trevor Darrell (psfig
author) and ask him about allowing psfig material to be released under a
free software license, that would be great.

Best,
Karl

Thanks, Karl!  I'll make note of that from here on out.

Josef, this is probably something your users should be
aware of; the non-free nature of psfig means that any
use is restricted to distributions that have properly
sublicensed the relevant code.  The license the code
was available under is incompatible with the GPL and
thus the code cannot be distributed with TexLive or
with most Linux distributions.

Your users might be able to switch to epsfig (with
some effort).  Otherwise, they may need to use a more
modern alternative.

I have all the others, but not those, and they couldn't be found in the

Nothing monumental ... these are two where the guide was printed in

Sorry, Ulrike.  When you understand his description you'll recognize
that his approach is reasonable.  Admittedly, there is a plethora of
other solutions too and I would prefer another approach.

Please note that there are many labels on a sheet, two per row, and
there are many rows.  We are not talking about just two labels.

However, I would first consider to use \rotatebox from the graphics
package rather than 'rotating' or 'scape'.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Howdy,

Is there a reason the labels package can't be set up to do the job?

Hello,

perl 5.22 shows warning (when script run with '-w' or 'use warning') on
very simple line:

printf('%*2$s',"a",6);

This of course concerns sprintf as well, so on my system (Archlinux
x86_64, testing) with perl 5.22 I see the following:

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

since the command \sc is no longer being used and causing warnings in  
recent LaTeX distributions I changed the gerapali.bst to use \textsc  
instead. This results in nothing but the disappearance of the warnings  
when using this bib-style.


With kind regards,

without having looked at the affected

It is a bit troubling to see that file `gerapali.bst` introduces itself 
as `% BibTeX `apalike' bibliography style (24-Jan-88 version)`, though 
there is a changelog from 1992

     15-feb-92   (MW)    Updated for use with `bibgerman.sty': things 
like "and"


Please, please, rename the file, and add the change you made to the 
list. I think using `\scshape` is better as well.

    I changed the gerapali.bst 

Thanks for the report, but ... in addition to the several apropos
comments already sent, any such changes must be uploaded to CTAN, i.e.,
the germbib package updated.

you're quite right, phil.  \sc isn't
defined as such in plain.tex (although
it is in manmac); how about "equivalent
to how \sc *would* operate if it were
defined in plain tex"?

If I print the labels below one another, they are still not printed 
sideways.

To print them sideways below one another, I would have to physically 
rotate the material which is printed on by 90 degrees, which, 
unfortunately, is not possible.

The stripe of labels is like this:


-----------------
|      | |      |   ^
| L1   | | L2   |   |
|      | |      |   |
|      | |      |   direction of feed
|      | |      |
|      | |      |
-----------------
|      | |      |
| L3   | | L4   |
|      | |      |
|      | |      |
|      | |      |
|      | |      |
-----------------
         ^ gap between 2 labels


How do you get them printed sideways by printing them one below the other?

Howdy,

If the order of the printing is no important why not use landscape mode. Use the geometry package to enforce it for the engine.

Good Luck,

Yes, the labels do not come in a package but are on a large roll.  One 
roll has 8000 labels, for example.  So you have a long stripe of labels 
which can be fed into the printer in only one direction as they spool 
off the roll through the printer.  This setup is very much like printing 
on "endless" paper as was common in the past before laser or inkjet 
printers became widely used.

If the labels were on sheets which could be fed into a laser/inkjet 
printer, I could simply rotate the sheets sideways.  There is no way the 
labels could somehow be fed sideways into the printer off the roll, not 
only because they are on a roll but also because of the way the printer 
is designed.  You cannot feed an "endless" printer sideways, either.


The easiest way might be to swap the paper size and set to "landscape" 
instead of "portrait" in the PDF viewer which is used to print:  I just 
found out that printing sideways doesn't even work with pages that do 
not have columns :(

Why is this even difficult at all?  It shouldn't be ...

Suggestion. Use PdfTeX and \pdfliteral. Sections 4.2/4.3 of the Adobe
PDF 1.7 (ISO 32000-1:2008) specification [1] state :

Therefore try :

	\setbox 0 = \hbox {\pdfliteral direct {0 1 -1 0 1050 150 cm}
		This text is rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise (0 1 -1 0)
			and translated through (1050 150) bp}
	\box 0
	\end

Hi Tim,
the "recent LaTeX distribution" you mentioned is LaTeX2e, which

Hi Barbara,
you can try this:

  \font\sc=cmcsc10

I must admit that I always believed that \sc was defined in plain TeX
but it seems that Lamport added it to LaTeX.  Maybe Don Knuth didn't
support small caps deliberately due to their design is poor.  

The lowercase glyphs are proportionally scaled-down instances of their
uppercase counterparts, also known as "faked small caps".

If someone on this list doesn't know what I'm talking about, look at

  http://vntex.sourceforge.net/fonts/samples/urwvn-test.pdf

On the last page, search for the line with the PostScript name
"VnTeXPalladioL-SC".  This line contains *real* small caps (designed
by Ralf Stubner).  The line above contains *faked* small caps.  IMO
the latter are awful and should be avoided.

I'm sure that Don Knuth didn't mention his small caps font in the
TeXbook because he was/is aware of its poor design.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I agree that VnTeXPalladioL-SC offers well designed caps and small caps,
but Don's "cmcsc10" is still /infinitely/ better than (e.g.,) Word's
attempt to fake small caps where they do not exist ...  For myself, if
forced to use Word and if I have no small caps font available, I usually
use normal weight full caps with bold weight simulated small caps.

Martin, you are right.  It's not related to TeX Live.

But is it really desirable to start a discussion from scratch
somewhere else after so many responses?  I doubt.

Hi,

the following M (non) WE example:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{kpfonts}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{siunitx}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepackage{floatrow}
\begin{document}
Foo
\end{document}
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

used to compile like a charm with TL 2014 but fails to compile with an
up to date TL 2015 with error:

  ?????
  ? (/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/floatrow/floatrow.sty
  ? (/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/caption/caption3.sty)
  ? ! No room for a new \dimen .
  ? \ch at ck ...\else \errmessage {No room for a new #3}
  ?                                                   \fi

  ?                                                   
  ? ? 
  ?????

AFAICS:

- using the `etex' package doesn't help,
- it is enough to remove anyone of the packages to "solve" the problem,
- it is enough to exchange `pgfplots' and `floatrow' to really solve the
  problem (but is not enough with some additional packages where another
  rearrangements are necessary).

It's unfortunate that such old files suddenly do not compile without
changes. So it could be nice to find and fix what is responsible of this
trouble. Do you have any idea?

Thanks in anticipation.

If you move floatrow earlier it works fine

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{kpfonts}
\usepackage{floatrow}
\usepackage{booktabs}

\usepackage{siunitx}

\usepackage{pgfplots}

\begin{document}
Foo
\end{document}


essentially the difference is that siunitx no longer loads etex.sty as latex2015
uses extended registers automatically, however there can be
differences around the edges,
in particular you need to declare inserts before the classic registers
are allocated.

I think I see what is going on here. Try

    \RequirePackage{etex}
    \reserveinserts{1}
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{kpfonts}
    \usepackage{booktabs}
    \usepackage{siunitx}
    \usepackage{pgfplots}
    \usepackage{floatrow}

    Foo

Can you explain *why* you think that DEK's fonts are better than
Word's faked small caps?  I don't see any difference.  Fonts are
proportionally scaled down in both cases.

But there is a significant difference though.  The faked small caps in
urwvn-test.pdf (line above "VnTeXPalladioL-SC") were created by
fontinst.  The difference is that fontinst fakes glyphs only if no
font with real small caps is available.  Microsoft Word fakes glyhs
even if fonts with real small caps are available and installed
properly.  Maybe recent releases which support OpenType fonts are
better in this respect.

I can't imagine that the results are acceptable.  But when *I* am
forced to use Microsoft Word, I simply deliver the crap they expect
and everybody is happy.  They don't expect anything but crap.

  Reinhard

That said, it would of course be better if document changes were not needed.
The problem really is an error in floatrow package which is declaring a box with
\newinsert rather than \newbox.

inserts are restricted to the classic tex registers below 256,  but
latex hardly uses inserts at all
(just two by default one for footnotes and one for \enlargethispage)
so the restriction
should not be a problem in practice,

Line 485 of floatrow.sty should be

\@ifdefinable\flrow at foot{\newbox\flrow at foot}

not

\@ifdefinable\flrow at foot{\newinsert\flrow at foot}

I'll see if I can contact the author.

Yes, I noticed this but:

1. it needs to rework the old files so backward compatibility is broken,
2. above all, it is not always possible if the underlying class load
   some packages that, hence, are loaded before `floatrow'.

But, in such a case, why isn't it enough to manually load `etex'?

Do you mean via \reserveinserts?

But, once more, it is unfortunate backward compatibility is broken...

I replied to this thread on TeXhax, bcc'ing TeX-Live so the members
thereof should know that I have tried to move it, but as the BCC'd copy
has not yet arrived back in my mailbox, I assume that the TeX Live list
doesn't like being BCC'd for some reason, so I repeat my reply below.

Suggestion. Use PdfTeX and \pdfliteral. Sections 4.2/4.3 of the Adobe
PDF 1.7 (ISO 32000-1:2008) specification [1] state :

Therefore try :

	\setbox 0 = \hbox {\pdfliteral direct {0 1 -1 0 1050 150 cm}
		This text is rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise (0 1 -1 0)
			and translated through (1050 150) bp}
	\box 0
	\end

Indeed, that works nicely, even with the non minimal file that revealed
the trouble: thanks!

Nevertheless, it would be unfortunate to have to rework all the files
loading `floatrow' and I hope its author will accept David's
suggestion...

Hi Phil,
this doesn't work for several reasons.  First of all, hw needs
PostScript because the PostScript interpreter has to render the bar
codes.  So it's better to stick with DVI and use PS \special's
instead.

Furthermore, the PDF operator "cm" means "concat matrix" and modifies
the graphics state of the PDF file.  If you don't use it within a
group, the first box is rotated by 90 degrees, the second by 180, and
so on.  Please note that the PDF graphics state has its own grouping
mechanism which is completely unaware of what you are doing in TeX.

And TeX doesn't know that and how you modified the PDF graphics state.
Using \pdfliteral properly is extremely difficult.  Even things which
look easy at a first glance, like changing colors, often lead to
unexpected results because the imaging models of PDF and TeX are
completely different.   

The best way to avoid these problems is to use \rotatebox from the
graphics package.  It takes care of these things.

Please try this file:

You need latex (not pdflatex) and dvips.  You can convert it to PDF
for previewing (ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages=/None) but in order to print
the labels this step is not necessary.

The next step will be to find out how to use Ghostscript in order to
convert the PostScript code to something the printer understands.  I
already posted an example for PCL printers but the paper size has to
be set explicitly in this case.

The PostScript file contains the line

  %%BoundingBox: 0 0 244 236

hence the relevant Ghostscript options are

  -dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=244 -dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=236

I've just seen on the CTAN-ann list that an update of the mathtools
package is available.  Its documentation confirms my statement.

  http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/mathtools/mathtools.pdf

See pp 27-28.  Similar things happened with colors before pdftex
introduced the color stack.  As far as colors are concerned, it's safe
nowadays to use LaTeX macros, AFAIK.  I doubt that page breaks in
hyperlinks can be handled properly on macro level and fear that the
problem cannot be solved without changing the behaviour of pdftex
primitives.

I've some experience with this low-level stuff since I wrote a LuaTeX
program which plots electrocardiograms.  I used Lua for signal
processing and scaling (from microvolts to millimeters) and wrote the
results directly into the PDF file.  The latter was necessary because
all existing graphics tools are too slow or produce too large files.

I could only write this program because I'm halfways familiar with TeX
programming, LaTeX internals, format files, PostScript, and the
related primitives of pdfTeX and LuaTeX.

But I definitely can't recommend casual users to go this way.  Things
are much too complex and require broad knowledge.

If there are high-level macros available, I strongly recommend to use
them.

Regards,
  Reinhard

This characterises the LaTeX approach v. the Plain TeX approach.  LaTeX
encourages the user to look for a package or packages that will solve
his/her problem; Plain TeX encourages the user to write a bespoke
package for him/herself.  By adopting the LaTeX approach, the "casual
user" will always remain a casual user, dependent on the work of others;
by adopting the Plain TeX approach, the casual user is forced to think
for him/herself, to research (in this example) the benefits and
limitations of direct access to the PDF transformation matrix, the
specification for the generation of bar codes, whether such bar codes
can be represented by nothing more complex than the superposition of a
sequence of TeX \rules & \kerns and the corresponding digit glyphs, and
so on.  And by so doing, the once-casual-user will become a power user,
able to think for him/herself, no longer dependent on the work of others.

Or more likely for most people, they decide TeX can't do what they want
for a reasonable effort and use some other tool.

If you wrote "for some people", Joseph, I would agree with you; but to
suggest that /most/ people are unwilling to learn, and simply want to
behave as parasites, using the work of others without investing any
intellectual input of their own in return, is at best an gross
overstatement and at worse downright offensive.  In my experience, most
people are more than willing to invest some intellectual input if, at
the end of the exercise, they believe they will thereby gain skills that
they will then be able to re-apply in other contexts and thus become
less dependent on the work of others in the future.

Suggestion :  ask Karl to create a "TeX-philosophy" list and moves this
discussion there.

A LaTeX user writes for instance

\usepackage{rotating}
...
\begin{sideways}
...
\end{sideways}

This will work the same way in pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex,
latex+dvips. If the user prepares the document in one engine? and for
some reason has to switch to another, it will still work. If the code
is written via \pdfliteral and the user has to switch to xelatex, it
will cease to work and will have to be rewritten.

Agreed.  And the user will thereby gain new knowledge that he/she will
be able to carry forward and re-apply in new contexts.

Well, each user is a parasite of operating system developer...

If someones topic is chemical thermodynamics, his main activity is
carrying out physico-chemical experiment yet he/she wishes to write
documents with nice math, then such a user simply does not have enough
time do delve into 800+ pages of PostScript Reference Manual and 800+
pages of PDF manual and manuals of dvips, pdftex, (x)dvipdfm(x). And
physico-chemical journals accept LaTeX, not plain TeX.

Also agreed.  I have made my point, I accept that others may disagree.
I have posted sample code shewing that the solution (modulo the
generation of barcodes) is trivial in plain XeTeX, and I am content to
leave it at that.

I don't have the latest tlmgr installed here, but TLU uses

tlmgr pdftex paper --list

to determine paper size. This bug showed up in prerelease,
but I thought it had been fixed. If not, you can ignore
the warning for now.

Dear Dr. Fink,

as a journalist of Germanys most successful monthly PC-magazine CHIP I am currently researching content for the enclosed DVD. Because of this I would like to offer our readers Your free software "Tex Live 2015" and "proTeXt" (if possible including upcoming versions) and distribute it as an additional service on any future CD/DVD, ISO-download and via CHIP-App-Tablet edition. Therefore I would be highly grateful if you would give me your approval.

Of course we will credit you and your web presence as the owner of rights.

Feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards from Munich,
Karsten Bunz

Dear Karsten,

first of all, I assume that you meant with Dr. Fink the maintainer
of TeX Live in SuSE. He will not be able to help you, as he is 
repackaging TeX Live for SuSE, but is not the main distributor
or developer.

You have also contacted the Office of the TUG, that is the best 
solution. In fact, Karl Berry will probably answer you, too, but
I start with somne information. Feel free to follow up (also
in German, if it is in private).

TeX Live is distributed in various ways:
* once a year we release a DVD
* besides that we have daily updates and network installations
Please see http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html for more details.

To our best knowledge, everything within the TeX Live itself
is freely redistributable, so you can include it at will, even 
without contacting us - BUT - we are happy to check what you
are going to distribute/present/write to make sure it does
not contain any mistakes.
To quote from http://tug.org/texlive/copying.html

	In short, this means that all the material in TeX Live may be freely used, copied, modified, and/or redistributed, subject to (in many cases) the sources remaining freely available. (Note: this is not true of all the software in the CTAN snapshot or in proTeXt, which are distributed alongside TeX Live in the TeX Collection.) 

So as long as you stay with TeX Live itself, you are fine.


Please feel free to contact me, this mailing list (texlive at ...), or
the office of TUG for further information.

Hi Karsten,
in addition to what Norbert already said, I'd like to mention that the
"TeX Collection DVD" (containig TeX Live for all systems, MacTeX for
OS X, and proTeXt for Windows) is already sold by Lehmanns Bookstore.
If the license is fine for Lehmanns, it's also fine for you.

You mentioned "Tex Live 2015" and "proTeXt" explicitly.  Unless you
want to put anything else onto the DVD its best (less error-prone) to
simply provide the "TeX Collection DVD" without any modifications.

Norbert already mentioned "network installations".  IMO DVDs are fine
for people with a poor internet connection.  In most cases network
installations are much faster and provide the latest stuff
immediately.  Even if you provide a DVD I think that it makes
sense to describe network installations in the article.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard and Norbert,

first of all many thanks for your quick reply and all the information concerning my request. Let me make some short annotations: I'm writing the "Freeware"-category in the CHIP-magazine and because of this, I am always researching for useful and interesting software - that is the reason why I found "Tex Live 2015". In this section I always write a short description of the tool and present it with screenshot to our readers. In my opinion it is very useful to put this software on our DVD in order that anybody can test the software without downloading it from the internet. We always use the downloads fron the official pages to avoid any problems applying the software like installers etc. In the description text I could make a cross reference to the "TeX Collection DVD".

Best Regards and thanks for your help
Karsten

If you want to put it on a DVD, you have two options:
- use the status at release time from the downloadable iso images
- use the tlnet directory from the CTAN mirror. Runing install-tl from
  there will do the very same as the DVD installer, only based on 
  the tlnet status of the day copied, including all updates up to this time.

All the best

Hi,

Not meaning to push but could you please include the updated
elocalloc package (submitted to ctan last week)
It's only one character difference (I managed to miss a %)

I'm a bit embarrassed about it as the forest package switched
to use elocalloc instead of etex, but it's producing spurious white space..
So if you could push the update through tlmgr I'd be grateful.


Thanks (and sorry!)

Hello, I just installed texlive 2015 on windows 8.1, which seemed to have installed correctly.



The root of the tl2015 tree is in the directory  g:\Experiments\sw\TeXLive\2015



However, when I try to run pdflatex, the format file is not found and cannot be generated.



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



C:\Users\goossens>pdflatex sample2e

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015/W32TeX) (preloaded

format=pdflatex)

restricted \write18 enabled.



kpathsea: Running mktexfmt pdflatex.fmt



The command name is g:\Experiments\sw\TeXLive\2015\bin\win32\mktexfmt

Running the command g:\Experiments\sw\TeXLive\2015\bin\win32\fmtutil.exe

fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence order):



fmtutil:   g:/experiments/sw/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf file for writing changes:

fmtutil:   c:/users/goossens/.texlive2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

Cannot get a temporary directory after five iterations ... sorry! at g:/Experime

I can't find the format file `pdflatex.fmt'!



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When I want to run tlmgr, I also have problems, as detailed below



?tlmgr update ?all? as a normal user (or as administrator, as shown below) does not get write access to the texlive directory.

Does somebody experience the same problems?



Thanks for your help.

Hi Karsten,

alost all has already been written by others. I just want to add that
it is possible to install TeX Live from a DVD, then point the tlmgr
package manager to the network installation repository and update from
there. The daily updates are short and low bandwidth is needed if
users start updating soon after the DVD release.

    Redundant argument in sprintf at

As far as I can see, this is a bug in Perl 5.22.0.  For instance, the
Perl manual has this example:

    printf '<%*2$s>', "a", 6; # prints "<	  a>"

Perl 5.22.0, with -w, reports the same warning:
  Redundant argument in printf at /tmp/x.pl line 1.

But Both arguments are being used -- the a is the value, the 6 is the
field length.  I'll see if I can report it to Perl.

I reported recently about this issue on the list with a solution, see
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2015-June/037025.html

As for the behaviour, it is documented in perldelta(1perl), section "New
Warnings":

   Redundant argument in %s

   (W redundant) You called a function with more arguments than were
   needed, as indicated by information within other arguments you
   supplied (e.g. a printf format). Currently only emitted when a
   printf-type format required fewer arguments than were supplied, but
   might be used in the future for e.g. "pack" in perlfunc.

   The warnings category "redundant" is new. See also [perl #121025]
   <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121025>.

The point of Karl was that the argument "6" *IS* actually used
by printf, it is the field width.

I have seen you rsolution but I don't think it should be necessary
to printf a format for printf .... that is crazy.

As soon as I have time I will look into it, for now the warnings
should be ignored.

Vladimir - the Perl people agreed that giving the warning in our case
was a bug.  (They didn't give me a url, but it is bug #125469 in their
RT.)  So there is nothing to do but wait for 5.22.1.  At least, it
doesn't make sense to me to insert contorted code just to work around
one incorrect warning in one version of Perl.  -k

I just tested with my Win8.1 VM without much problems.

Are there any special folder settings on that partition/drive?

Also I find this one a little strange

Cannot get a temporary directory after five iterations

Perhaps some of the more Windows capable people on the list can help with more suggestions

Message-ID: <20150625201033.80498e1f523117cecd2b7291@michaelshell.org>


(It was suggested that I repost this to the Tex Live list from the newsgroup
comp.text.tex ....)


The TeX Belleek fonts are a free replacement for the proprietary
MathTime Times-like math font:

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/belleek
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/belleek

Some/many publishers use or have experience with MathTime. It would
really be nice if the free TeX systems came with the Belleek fonts by
default so that we could rely on its availability.

However, it seems that there is a problem with copyright/distribution:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2007-May/013859.html

which stems not from the Belleek glyphs themselves, but rather from
their metrics, which are the same as that of MathTime.

Can't the TeX community find a way to get a set of distributeable
metrics for Belleek? It seems a shame to come so close after all that
work on the glyphs. Even if we have to deviate from the MathTime
metrics, having something that may typeset slightly differently is
much better than having nothing at all.


Lastly, I would like to know what is tbe best freely available
alternative to Belleek/MathTime. For example, how does mathptmx compare?


  Cheers and thanks in a advance,

  Mike Shell

Hello Michael,

My personal favorite is Michael Sharpe's 'newtxtext' and 'newtxmath'.
Also Michael is quite active in maintaining his packages, fixing issues,
improving metrics etc.

BTW: There's a 'belleek' package included in TL. It contains 3 fonts in
Type 1 and in TrueType format. But don't know if it comprises the
complete set of fonts that you had in mind.

Subject: [tex-live] hyperref trouble with color and graphicx
Message-ID: <CAJCZBmRnryYCTFb_i0SBmRdTdh4cANwnaWS2o2znh3j4Uhm-hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have some trouble with hyperref.sty when used at the same time with
graphicx.sty. The following LaTeX source can cause an error.
Please typeset using LaTeX + dvipdfmx.
(tiger.pdf can be obtained by converting tiger.eps with Ghostscript.)

----- test.tex -----
%#!latex -> dvipdfmx
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
\begin{document}
I will introduce an example of mathematical beauty.
\begin{equation}
  e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{eq1}) is called ``Euler's identity.''

Sample image here:
\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger} % tiger.pdf (extension implicit)
%\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger.pdf} % tiger.pdf
Tiger!
\end{document}
----- End of test.tex -----

The error message is:
----------
./test.tex:12: LaTeX Error: File `tiger' not found.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.12 \includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger}
                                        % tiger.pdf
?
----------

However,
* When "colorlinks" option is removed, test.tex causes no error.
* When .pdf extension is given explicitly, test.tex causes no error.

I think this is because "dvips.def" is loaded internally by color.sty
without driver option, and overloads "dvipdfmx.def" which has been
already loaded by graphicx.sty. This problem can be fixed:

l.2974 in "hyperref.sty" (2012/11/06 v6.83m)
----------
\DeclareVoidOption{dvipdfmx}{%
  \HyOpt at CheckDvi{dvipdfmx}{%
    \def\Hy at driver{hdvipdfm}%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx}{color}% <- Add this line!
  }%
}
----------

This will solve all the unexpected results coming from conflict
between two drivers.
I hope this information helps improve hyperref package.

Subject: [tex-live] Attention when upgrading to El Capitan
Message-ID: <7FF623DD-0F67-46EE-BF38-6193361364C4@mnsoft.org>

Hi Team,

The El Capitan upgrade will not carry along entries to /usr that do not come out of the box, such as /usr/texbin. This will break TeXLive by and large for all users upgrading. When upgrading to Yosemite, /usr/texbin already caused the upgrade to take "forever," as a result of which I had moved it out of there and replaced by a symlink. Now, this symlink, along with others I had there, were not carried over when upgrading to El Capitan.

I've opened a bug report for Apple, and they responded "This issue behaves as intended."

See below.

Best regards,

Matthias

Apple Developer Relations25-Jun-2015 09:22 PM
This issue behaves as intended.

If you have any critical software that is broken by this, please file specific bug reports on each application that is impacted so we can evaluate.

We are now closing this bug report.

If you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.

Please be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.

Matthias Nott17-Jun-2015 04:14 PM
Summary:
Have a symlink in /usr like /usr/texbin -> /Library/TeX/Distributions/Programs/texbin. Also have some symlinks to /opt/X11. None of those were carried over on upgrade. Re-adding them requires temporarily disabling rootless.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade Yosemite -> El Capitan.
2. Custom content in /usr is missing and can be re-added only disabling rootless.

Expected Results:
Everything in system folders should be carried along. Or not. A philosophical question probably.

At least users should be aware.

Actual Results:


Version:
El Capitan

Yes, of course I've tried switching the order of packages:

\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}

However, color.sty still calls dvips.def and conflicts with dvipdfmx.def.

One of possible solution may be:

\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx,color}% <- explicit option for color.sty
\usepackage[dvipdfmx,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}

But I think this kind of problem is hard to resolve on the users' side,
so I hope this can be handled on the package itself.

exactly which LaTeX installation are you using?

I replaced tiger with rose (as I had that one)

Then no problem with your MWE on TeX Live 2015, using latex + dvipdfmx

Subject: [tex-live] hyperref trouble with color and graphicx

Hello,

I have some trouble with hyperref.sty when used at the same time with
graphicx.sty. The following LaTeX source can cause an error.
Please typeset using LaTeX + dvipdfmx.
(tiger.pdf can be obtained by converting tiger.eps with Ghostscript.)

----- test.tex -----
%#!latex -> dvipdfmx
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
\begin{document}
I will introduce an example of mathematical beauty.
\begin{equation}
  e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{eq1}) is called ``Euler's identity.''

Sample image here:
\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger} % tiger.pdf (extension implicit)
%\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger.pdf} % tiger.pdf
Tiger!
\end{document}
----- End of test.tex -----

The error message is:
----------
./test.tex:12: LaTeX Error: File `tiger' not found.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.12 \includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger}
                                        % tiger.pdf
?
----------

However,
* When "colorlinks" option is removed, test.tex causes no error.
* When .pdf extension is given explicitly, test.tex causes no error.

I think this is because "dvips.def" is loaded internally by color.sty
without driver option, and overloads "dvipdfmx.def" which has been
already loaded by graphicx.sty. This problem can be fixed:

l.2974 in "hyperref.sty" (2012/11/06 v6.83m)
----------
\DeclareVoidOption{dvipdfmx}{%
  \HyOpt at CheckDvi{dvipdfmx}{%
    \def\Hy at driver{hdvipdfm}%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx}{color}% <- Add this line!
  }%
}
----------

This will solve all the unexpected results coming from conflict
between two drivers.
I hope this information helps improve hyperref package.
Regards,

?I'm tested on both MacTeX-2015 on OS X Lion (10.7.5) and
TeX Live 2015 on Windows 7 Professional.
All packages are up-to-date with tlmgr.

I failed to include ``tiger.pdf'' when ``.pdf'' extension is not explicitly
written in test.tex, but ``tiger.eps'' can be included even when ``.eps''
extension is omitted.

In my case TL15 on Linux, it includes both the .eps and PDF just fine

Do you mind posting the log? Just to be sure that there aren't any files picked up from the wrong place.

Are your sure there isn't a problem with tiger.*?

Hello,

I have some trouble with hyperref.sty when used at the same time with
graphicx.sty. The following LaTeX source can cause an error.
Please typeset using LaTeX + dvipdfmx.
(tiger.pdf can be obtained by converting tiger.eps with Ghostscript.)

----- test.tex -----
%#!latex -> dvipdfmx
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
\begin{document}
I will introduce an example of mathematical beauty.
\begin{equation}
  e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{eq1}) is called ``Euler's identity.''

Sample image here:
\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger} % tiger.pdf (extension implicit)
%\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger.pdf} % tiger.pdf
Tiger!
\end{document}
----- End of test.tex -----

The error message is:
----------
./test.tex:12: LaTeX Error: File `tiger' not found.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.12 \includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger}
                                        % tiger.pdf
?
----------

However,
* When "colorlinks" option is removed, test.tex causes no error.
* When .pdf extension is given explicitly, test.tex causes no error.

I think this is because "dvips.def" is loaded internally by color.sty
without driver option, and overloads "dvipdfmx.def" which has been
already loaded by graphicx.sty. This problem can be fixed:

l.2974 in "hyperref.sty" (2012/11/06 v6.83m)
----------
\DeclareVoidOption{dvipdfmx}{%
  \HyOpt at CheckDvi{dvipdfmx}{%
    \def\Hy at driver{hdvipdfm}%
    \PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx}{color}% <- Add this line!
  }%
}
----------

This will solve all the unexpected results coming from conflict
between two drivers.
I hope this information helps improve hyperref package.

OK, I pasted the entire log.
The test source is ``colorlinks-test.tex''.
tiger.pdf can be obtained from:

http://oku.edu.mie-u.ac.jp/~okumura/texwiki/files/tiger.pdf

----------
%#!latex -> dvipdfmx
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx,colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}
\usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
\begin{document}
I will introduce an example of mathematical beauty.
\begin{equation}
  e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{eq1}) is called ``Euler's identity.''

Sample image here:
\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger} % tiger.pdf (extension implicit)
%\includegraphics[width=3ex]{tiger.pdf} % tiger.pdf

\end{document}

You can see ``dvips.def'' after ``dvipdfmx.def''.
This is problematic...

Howdy,

The problem even exists for latex->dvips->ps2pdf processing. I.e., remove the dvipdfmx option from the two \usepackage commands and it still fails independent of order of the package calls. Fully updated TeX Live 2015.

Good Luck,

Hi, Herbert,

?
Dvips can include ONLY eps format, so you always have to use tiger.eps
?with the latex->dvips->?ps2pdf processing.
With dvips.def only, they can include only eps fomat. So they immediately
searches tiger.eps when extensions are implicit.

My problem is:

With dvipdfmx.def overloaded with dvips.def, the macros for including
explicit .pdf graphics is alive, but the macros for implicit extensions
are overwritten with one in dvips.def, which can include only .eps.

It would be even better to put \listfiles above \documentclass because
it lists verbosely versions of all files used.

Probably you have a rose.eps too. Use some file where you have only
a pdf. 

And Hironobu is right: color is loaded by hyperref but not with the
correct options and so the wrong driver is activated. 

One can get around it by using dvipdfmx as class option, or by
loading (x)color  with the correct option first, but it would a good
idea if hyperref would do it.

Yes, I hope so.
\PassOptionsToPackage{dvipdfmx}{color}
in \DeclareVoidOption{dvipdfmx}{......}
will work, as I said in my first post.

  Uwe,

For my own use, this would be the way to go. However, newtx is new
enough that there still are too many existing LaTeX systems that
don't have it yet and I can't ask authors to have to install it.

> BTW: There's a 'belleek' package included in TL.

I thought we couldn't distribute that. I wonder if it requires us
to obtain the MathTime font metrics file.

In anycase, if mathptmx is as complete as Belleek, then that
might be my best option.


  Cheers and thanks,

  Mike

I could reproduce this by installing as admin and disabling format
generation.

When I clicked the TeX Live Manager tile I got a UAC prompt to run
TLMGR with admin permissions. By clicking Actions / Rebuild all
formats I could generate the formats.

Of course this should not be necessary. Norbert?

Message-ID: <3236A536-CD46-4328-9572-00B0F7F1E7B3@uoregon.edu>

Matthias,

This issue was caught by the TeX Live developers on the very day
that Apple released the El Capitan beta to developers, and the
packages MacTeX-2015 and BasicTeX-2015 were revised to
handle it. 

For details, go to

	tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html

and read the section titled ?El Capitan? in the middle of the
page.

Users who updated to TeX Live 2015 can prepare for the
El Capitan update already, so their installations will work
when they update in the fall.

Authors of GUI apps for the Macintosh need to be
aware of the material on the above web page.

Re belleek - my reply at
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2007-May/013893.html is still the
situation, as far as I know.  Someone has to construct the metrics,
without just copying the original files.  Although the results can (and
should be) the same.

If anyone has a serious intention of doing that work, I suppose it would
be good to check with the FSF and Debian that they will accept the
result.  *I* will no matter what, because I am confident enough that
metrics are not, in and of themselves, copyrightable, but I suspect
others do not feel the same.

Another approach would be to ask pctex to release the metrics under a
free license, as Adobe did with their base fonts years ago.

Howdy,

I just got a call for help on the mactex-support list that looked curiously like the error message talked about in this thread, this time I seem to have tracked it down to 

Line 619 in the bigfoot package: \newinsert\FN at savebox -> \newbox\FN at savebox

as well as

line 209 in the manyfoot package: \def\MFL at newinsert#1{\newinsert#1% -> \def\MFL at newinsert#1{\newbox#1%

and the text following -> seems to fix the problem. Note: the bigfoot package calls in the manyfoot package.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

No unlike floatrow the footnote packages are using inserts so you can
not remove the \newinsert here,

Loading the packages earlier should work, or if not can you point me
at a test case?

I think I see what is going on here and will fix shortly. Note that this
is not a TeX Live issue per se and would best be reported via
https://github.com/latex3/svn-mirror/issues

Thanks!

BTW, if you see why the LaTeX warning: "Unused global option(s):
[key=foo]", please let me know :)

I have a fix in hand and checked in to our SVN. I have a few other
things to look at this week and will then aim to release.

> [key=foo]", please let me know :)

This is due to the LaTeX2e kernel not the expl3 code. You have in your
example

    \LoadClassWithOptions{article}

This passes all of the class options to article. It then populates the
unused list based on options it does not know. If you want to avoid that
use just

    \LoadClass{article}

I've asked the rest of the team about this before: the best that can be
said is that it's always been the case!

\LoadClassWithOptions was intended to provide a simplified interface
for packages that didn't declare any options but wanted to leave all
that to (say) article, and just change some defaults or new
environments etc.

A package handling its own options should use\LoadClass, and
explicitly pass any options that it wants to pass to article.

A class that is loading l3keys and using a new option handler is well
outside the design considerations of \LoadClassWithOptions.

But this is even more off topic for tex-live list than the start of
this thread:-)

You know, this actually was/is my position, and the approach I wanted to
go with as well. For an unknown reason, STIX was not an acceptable option.
If I ever find out why, I will let you know. Perhaps it has to do with
publisher back end processing capability. I've also read somewhere
that there are still some unsolved metric problems in the STIX fonts.

Me too - and I'd go further than that. I wouldn't allow half the
patents out there to be approved. And software copyright? Why,
I'd have those expire in a few years like with patents.


Anyway, I took Uwe's advice and installed the most recent newtxmath
to try out thinking maybe that could be the answer after all. I
installed it on an older (2011) TeXLive system. (It's good to check
what happens when an older system is used with it.)

My minimal test file here compiles error free:


\documentclass{article}

% select one
\usepackage{newtxmath}
%\usepackage{mathptmx}

\begin{document}

\section{Math Test}

Uppercase Greek plain:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = 2\Pi = 3\Phi = 4\Omega
\end{equation}

\noindent Uppercase Greek with mathnormal:
\begin{equation}
\mathnormal{\Gamma} = 2\mathnormal{\Pi} = 3\mathnormal{\Phi} = 4\mathnormal{\Omega}
\end{equation}

\end{document}


Under mathptmx, the result is as expected. However, under newtxmath
(version 1.437 2015-05-01) \mathnormal does not produce slanted
uppercase Greek letters - they remain upright. If I invoke
newtexmath's slantedGreek option, all the uppercase Greek letters
are slanted.

Can anyone try my example and tell me if it is also that way on
their system as well? There may be another/better way to control
math Greek italics, but even if so, my concern here is with the
existing author math code base out there when \mathnormal does
not work as expected.


  Cheers and thank you in advance,
  
  Mike Shell

Nowadays copyright expires 80 years after author's death. I would like
to have it expire much earlier.
