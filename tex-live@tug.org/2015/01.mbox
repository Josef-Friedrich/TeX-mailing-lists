Subject: [tex-live] TeXworks through TeX Live on Windows with multi-byte
	username
Message-ID: <CACJoV2uOOc2UDz+7E33A49i6iNx47_s3h6urrZMnrQkHLXiUzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, the TeXworks and TeX Live development teams and users,

We are annoyed by the behavior of TeXworks through
TeX Live on Windows.  When the username has Japanese
character(s), the beginning of the procedure of TeXwork's initial
procedure might use
  %USERPROFILE%\.texlive????\texmf-config\texworks
as the user's configure setting (and create the directory if not existing);
however, the later process might not uses the directory but uses
  %USERPROFILE%\TeXworks
as its setting.  The latter place is the default setting of the
TeXworks stand alone which means directly executing
tlpkg/texwoks/texworks.exe

We are reading some of the codes of TeXworks rapidly,
and guess this behavior comes from Qt library, but it is not
sure whether it is under control of the developer's thought.
  The source code which I have read is
    /svn/texlive/trunk/Master/source/texworks-0.4.4-r1004.tar.gz .
  You would concentrate Lines 144--149 and 886 in src/TWApp.cpp .

  You could reproduce the problem by override the TW_LIBPATH
  in texmf.cnf (under CP932 encoding) as
  -  TW_LIBPATH = $TEXMFCONFIG/????/texworks
     ... C:\Users\<USERNAME>\texworks would be used for user setting.
     though C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.texlive2014\????\texworks
     would be natural.
  - TW_LIBPATH = $TEXMFCONFIG/??????/texworks
    ... C:\Users\<USERNAME>\texworks would be used too.

Is the behavior intended?
Could you fix the difference whether TW_INIPATH has
multi-bytes characters (e.g., ???? or ??????)?

Best,
-- KUROKI Yusuke

Subject: [tex-live] etex_man.pdf formatting issue
Message-ID: <5D7F5EDE-6F66-40B9-A289-2267A099161A@free.fr>

Hi,

the file

/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/etex/base/etex_man.pdf

has (see for example on page 15) numerous TeX-XeT and TeX--XeT
where systematically the -XeT is bold on screen (tested on mac os x
with both preview and acrobat reader)

This seems like a bug, probably related to the chain followed
(which I didn't investigate) to produce the pdf from the source.
(by laziness I didn't try to locate the source, which is presumably in
some ascii text markup)

I suspect the -XeT is treated like an option, as for example one sees in 

/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/etex.man1.pdf

where all described options are indeed printed bold. Thus my conjecture
is that similar tools are used to produce both etex_man.pdf and 
etex.man1.pdf but what is suitable for the second is not 100% ok for the first.

best wishes

Jean-Francois

This is not a 'TeX Live thing': the PDF and sources are provided by the
NTS team. If you read the sources, TeX--XeT is produced by a macro
called \TeXXeT which is defined as

    \def\TeXXeT{\TeX-\revrm{\TeXXeTstate=1\beginR\TeX-\endR}}

with

    \DeclareFontShape{OT1}{cmr}{bxrev}{n}{<-> xbmc10}{}
    \DeclareTextFontCommand{\revrm}
      {\fontseries{bxrev}\fontshape{n}\selectfont}

so it look deliberate.

I didn't suspect NTS team still existed at this time and should have checked
before. I imagined the sources were (respectfully ;-) ) treated as some sort
of legacy material by the TeXLive team.

You are right of course. I was too lazy and should have checked the source,
my conjecture about a common ascii-text format for both etex_man and
the man page (which would have explained the boldening of things
following an hyphen) seems to have been quite completely misguided.

The visual effect of the bold font for -XeT is strange. Stranger still is that I 
noticed it only this morning and got puzzled over it!

Subject: [tex-live] Errors in installation via install-tl
Message-ID: <20150112025754.GA20249@henrique-pc>

Hi,

I already did some attempts to install TexLive via the install-tl script and
it failed everytime.

To catch the errors messages, I started a minimal build, I will attach all the
log file, but this is the end, wich contain the crucial part.

All I did is untar the file, enter root, and run ./install-tl

The error message:

Might be a good idea to mention what kind of system you are on.

Which version of the installer did you use (when you download and unpack it, the created folder has a date in the name.

Hi,

I already did some attempts to install TexLive via the install-tl script and
it failed everytime.

To catch the errors messages, I started a minimal build, I will attach all the
log file, but this is the end, wich contain the crucial part.

All I did is untar the file, enter root, and run ./install-tl

So I'm using linux. The distro is Sabotage-Linux https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage 

The perl version
is perl 5, version 16, subversion 3
The installer version is: 20150110

The shell is ash from busybox. I have write permission on /usr/local
Now I tried to set the path before the installation and didn't worked.
I also tried to install in my home folder and I got the same errors.
If I cd into the directory and try to run some of the bins, I get:

Not a good choice for non-experts.  Is there a reason you can't use a
mainstream linux?  If we know more about what you wish to accomplish we
might be able to provide useful advice.

You mentioned that you installed as "root".  That is generally not a good
idea.  A better
approach is to create the toplevel directory, e.g.. /usr/local/texlive, and
change the
ownership to an ordinary user who will administer texlive.

It is quite possible that ash isn't totally compatible with the texlive
scripts.  Can you install
dash or bash for testing?

The installer should use the appropriate path when running kpathsea

I also tried to install in my home folder and I got the same errors.

This appears to be the original problem.  Certainly if kpsewhich cannot
be found, nothing is going to work.  I can only surmise that the
kpsewhich binary in your directory is somehow bad (hardware, unlikely as
that seems), or is for the wrong platform.

    Undefined subroutine &main::print_error called at
    /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux/updmap line 24.

That was a consequence of kpsewhich not being runnable.  I'll fix the
error message.

Best,
Karl

You seem to be missing some essential loader or libs.

What does 
	ldd ./tex
say?

My guess is that your libc is somehow too different, here on my system
it does:
$ ldd tex
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffea3fe000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f7f28c9b000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7f288f2000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7f28fcb000)
$

As I said, libc seems to be the problem: THe web site states:
	experimental distribution based on musl libc
Whatever musl libc might be, it seems *not* to provide the loaders.

In this case you have to compile the binaries by yourself, not an
easy task.

Good luck.

No, I can use a mainstream distribution. But sabotage is the one I prefer.
And I had no problem I can't deal before.

I was doing this before, I did it with a normal user, and the same error.

This is something I suspect, I will try with bash.

With path here I mean the enviroment variable PATH of the binaries. I suspected
the problem was that texlive was trying to execute a file from the new 
installation.

~/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux $ ls -l ./tex
-rwxr-xr-x    1 henrique wheel       374416 Apr 28  2014 ./tex

~/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux $ ldd tex
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x7f68b3682000)
libm.so.6 => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x7f68b3682000)
libc.so.6 => /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x7f68b3682000)
                        
So now you talked about a interesting thing. You made me see that the tex binaries are
dynamic linked. Here, I don't have glibc, I use musl (the other libraries are normal).
So would this be the problem?

Yes, you are right.

So why texlive don't bring static linked binaries?
Wouldn't it be better and more compatible with other systems?
With static linked binaries would not need any other lib or dependence.

Is there a why dynamic is prefered?

We prefer static, and actually compile practically all libs 
statically. But *NOT* libc ... we go to great length that the
builds works on as many systems as possible, but that excludes
exotic or laternative C-libs, sorry.

    Is there a why dynamic is prefered?

It's my understanding that statically linking libc has a significant
chance of running afoul of different kernel versions.  A worse problem
than systems not having libc.  Yours is just about the first GNU/Linux
we've had reports on where our binaries don't work.

If you or anyone succeeds in creating binaries, we'd be happy to
distribute them, one way or another.

Message-ID: <20150113204534.RBiaY+3e%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>

I started this thread in October 2011 and eventually
reported that I had succeeded. Barbara Beeton asked me to
write up what I had done but I demurred saying

  I'm afraid there's not much I can say. The "re-creation"
  of the latex209 format went as follows: I found a latex209
  tree in a back-up and copied it to my current texmf
  tree, added a line to fmtutil.cnf and called fmtutil.
  That's about it, except for adding a symbolic link in my
  /usr/local/bin.

I've just had to figure this out again, and I now agree that
it may indeed be useful to document all the details :+)

If you don't have a latex209 tree, download

http://mirrors.ctan.org/obsolete/macros/latex209/distribs/latex209.tar.gz

unpack it somewhere and move it to

tex/latex209

(*not* tex/latex)
 
in a local or personal texmf tree.

Add the following line

latex209        tex             -               latex209.ini

to the 

# from eplain:

section of fmtutil.cnf.  Do 

kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf

to find this file.  Then do

fmutil --missing 

which should respond with

fmtutil: No errors, exiting successfully.

Finally, add a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin (or whatever
works in Windows) as follows:

ln -s /usr/local/bin/tex latex209

That should do it.

Message-ID: <loom.20150113T153550-67@post.gmane.org>

Hello,

I tried to install TexLive on win7 and it hangs on the "running package-
specific postactions."

It has occurred twice. The second time I captured the more verbose log using -
v option.

Steps I took:
1. Removed texlive folder from previous install.
2. Clicked the installer and selected the unpack option.
3. Right-clicked on "com" and selected "Run as Administrator"
4. Navigated to folder and ran the advance install command with -v option.

TexLive made it through all ~3000 installation steps but when it got to 
"running package-specific postactions" it hung.

The last parts of the log file are:

Seems to be a file permission problem.  But the directory
C:/PROGRA~3/MICROS~1/Windows/STARTM~1 isn't the one where TL is
installed by default.  I would expect "c:\texlive".  Did you change
the installation path deliberately?  You didn't mention it, at least.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Compiling from source
Message-ID: <20150114055928.GA24231@henrique-pc>

Hi,

I'm compiling texlive from source, but I'm in doubt about something.
I already compiled the source and installed the binaries to
/usr/local/texlive/2014.
I understood that I need to get extra files to make all the stuff work.
But I don't know where to get and what to do with it.
The link https://www.tug.org/texlive/build.html say to "copy/move he bindir
to the existing Master/bin/archname in a full TL checkout" but this sound 
pretty confusing. So should I clone TL from the mirror and move the binaries 
to the Master folder of it? But I have more than the bin folder in
/usr/local/texlive/2014, and also where should this new folder Master +
"the bins of /usr/local/texlive/2014" stay?

I already did a lot of mistakes, so I'm asking to now do the right thing.

!Summarizing, could someone tell what to do to end my setup with a working 
tex enviroment, starting from the point I stopped?

Regards,

Henrique Lengler

Here it tries to create a directory for the TL menu shortcuts. I'll
look into this.

Master/bin/archname directories exist in the TL subversion repository.
If you want to supply your build to be usable by other, the binaries
should be there and should be committed to the repository. If you
build it just for yourself, your binaries should be in
/usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/archname because texmf.cnf is searched in
a directory relative to the location of the binaries.

You mean you right-clicked on cmd.exe?

Can you send me install-tl.log in the root of the installation? I
want to see whether there is any other funny stuff.

But the problem may very well be yet another instance of excessive
file- and directory locking by Windows. Anyhow, I could not
reproduce your problem and I am not sure what would be the best
workaround in a case such as yours.

By the way: for testing, installing scheme minimal is much faster.

Hi Reinhard,
I didn't change anything. When the big dialog/wizard came up after I
executed the install command, I just hit "Next" or whatever it says.

The TeXlive files got installed into C:\texlive

So, I'm building just for myself. Will I need the files in Master, or do any

Maybe it is not clear to some people, but in Windows, menu shortcuts
must be under one of two special folders, one of which is for
single-user installations, and the other for all-users
installations. Naturally, both locations are outside the TL
directory tree.

Under linux it is not wise to do any maintanance as root, you will
have problems. The ls-R files will then be owned by root and whatever
you do later with tlmgr as normal user will fail due to "permission
denied". In order to make the binaries work, they must be in
/usr/local/texlive2014/bin/whatever and thsi directory must be at the
beginning of PATH.

I have this set up.

    ~ $ ls /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux | wc -l
    345
    ^- Number of binaries in the folder

    ~ $ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/x86_64-linux:/bin:/local/bin
    |       TEXLIVE PATH -^                 |

So in my /home/henrique folder I try:
    ~ $ tex samplefile.tex
    This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=tex)

    kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt
    I can't find the format file `tex.fmt'!

*Can't find tex.fmt?*

Let's try latex:
    ~ $ latex samplefile.tex
    This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.15 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=latex)
     restricted \write18 enabled.

    kpathsea: Running mktexfmt latex.fmt
    I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

So yeah, I have all the things set up, and I can't use the binaries. Why?

Henrique Lengler

Try:

mktexlsr
fmtutil-sys --all

The first command rebuilds the ls-R database, the second command
generates all formats

I am not sure whether updmap-sys (without any parameters) is needed
before generating the formats, probably not. The formats need just the
TFM files.

I don't know why, but when I did mktexlsr as normal user, it updated

Updating /local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/ls-R...

I don't know why /local since everything I did was in /usr/local, and I
 had no permission in /local.
I give me permission in /local, ran mktexlsr, it updated:
    mktexlsr: Updating /local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/ls-R...
    mktexlsr: Updating /local/texlive/2014/texmf-var/ls-R...
    mktexlsr: Done.
And I did: 
    ~ $ fmtutil-sys --all

After I tryied:
    ~ $ tex samplefile.tex
    This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=tex)

    kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt

Yes, the same error.

This is correct, the problem is somewhere else. Try the following commands:

kpsewhich --all texmf.cnf
env |grep TEX

The dropping of /usr does not make sense to me.  The scripts and
programs do not randomly change the paths as given.  Do you have any
tex-related environment variables set?

At any rate, 1) does kpsewhich cmr10.tfm find the tfm file?
If not, clearly nothing will work.  (The tfms are already in Master and
do not need to be built.)

2) how about kpsewhich -engine=/ tex.fmt?  If that's not there, the fmt
needs to be built (as is apparently the case).

3) why fmtutil-sys is failing, I cannot guess; you'd have to look at the
log.  Perhaps try building the simplest format by hand:
tex -ini '\input tex.ini'

As for the doc about building from source, I tried to write it as
clearly (yet tersely, because no one reads long instructions) as I
could.  Just saying it's confusing does not help.

All your problems are *BECAUSE* you don't have the files in Master.

Just building from the sources does *NOT* generate a working setup.
Only the combination of build binaries *AND* Master creates a working
setup.

This has all been mentioned many times.

Do you know how TeX works? If not, why do you try to build everything
manually without any experience ...????

Should I run this?

~ $ tex -ini '\input tex.ini'
This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2014) (INITEX)
! I can't find file `tex.ini'.
<*> \input tex.ini

Something that helps, are examples, I would like to see a pratical example to what to do
after make install. Note that this is the main question of this thread,
what I should do after compiling the source and make install, to have a working enviroment.

My case is described on the first message: http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2015-January/036223.html

I know and I said this, what I also ask is what to do with these files,
this I can't find in the internet.

Again, did you copy *ALL* the files from Master/texmf-dist to your

See, this is the simple answer I was waiting for. So now I will do this, and
probably will sove my problem.

The /local still seems wrong.

Anyway, what's not clear to me is what you have, which makes it pretty
hard to figure out why nothing works.  I guess you have the result of
running install-tl with our original (unusable for you) binaries?  I.e.,
several gb of tex stuff in /some/dir/texmf-dist?

If so, copy the bindir into /some/dir/bin/henrique, put that in PATH,
and see if kpsewhich can find cmr10.tfm then.  The standard path would be
/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/cm/cmr10.tfm

I deleted All the files of my fail install-tl attempt. They were in /usr/local/texlive/2014

There is no folder with this name here, I didn't copied Master yet, I'm downloading it.

No, my guess is he has the outcome of a 
	Build
run, which is a minimal texmf-dist tree without anything ...


That should give you a working installation

No, it is *easy* to find:
	http://tug.org/texlive/build.html
under
	Deployment and testing


Henrique, here is a short recipe what you *SHOULD* do:
* build the binaries, put them into
        /foobar/mybins/
* get the installer package install-tl.tar.gz (or zip)
* unpack it
* run   
        install-tl -custom-bin /foobar/mybins
* during the installation configuration do NOT change
  anthing related to binaries!

That should give you a working installation

I would remove "/local/bin" from PATH.  No TeX Live related file
should be there.  If there are already TL related files in this
directory for some reason, they only make debugging much harder.

As Zden?k already pointed out, the preferred way is to run

  chown -R henrique:users /usr/local/texlive

and to avoid doing anything as root.

  Reinhard

Something I don't know why, I'm my system, /local and /usr/local
are like clones, equal. If I change something in one folder, the
 same happen in the other.
e.g

~ $ pwd
/home/henrique
~ $ ls /local/
bin      include  lib      man      share    texlive
~ $ ls /usr/local/
bin      include  lib      man      share    texlive
~ $ mv BTL.pdf /usr/local/
~ $ ls /usr/local/
BTL.pdf  bin      include  lib      man      share    texlive
~ $ ls /local/
BTL.pdf  bin      include  lib      man      share    texlive

And I think they aren't symlink.
~ $ file /local/
/local/: directory
~ $ file /usr/local/
/usr/local/: directory

But my texlive env. is now working,

THANK YOU GUYS for the help.

Henrique Lengler

Hallo, I would bet it is a hard link.
Usually these hard links between directories can only be created by root, because it is assumed that the root understands the system sufficiently well.
Good luck

Theoreticaly, they may be hard links although hard links of
directories are rarely used and often prohibited. More probable is
that /local is also mounted as /usr/local. It can be examined by
issuing mount without parameters.

I installed TeX Live using the network install in /usr/local (as it is by default).

The value of TEXMFHOME is ~/texmf and of TEXMFLOCAL is /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local. However, my Linux distribution's package manager installed sagetex.sty in /usr/share/texmf and its documentation in /usr/share/doc. What is the best way to get TeX Live to see those two, without copying anything over? I read that modifying TEXMFLOCAL to include multiple trees is not encouraged (and even if it included /usr/share/texmf, texdoc still wouldn't find the documentation in /usr/share/doc). So, is there any alternative?

Thanks.

Here is what I do for our NFS shared installation
(I like to *not* have our in house stuff in texmf-local)



in /path/texlive/

I have

2014/
texmf-imf/

and in 2014/texmf.cnf

I have

% define IMF tree
TEXMFIMF = $SELFAUTOPARENT/../texmf-imf
 
% adding IMF tree
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFIMF,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFSYSVAR;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFIMF;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFDIST
TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFIMF,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST,!!$TEXMFDOC}


So you could just define your version of TEXMFIMF to be a specific (full) path to the root of there sage installed stuff.

(Here $SELFAUTOPARENT is /path/texlive/2014)

Check whether there are symlinks under /usr/share/texmf to
/usr/share/doc, which would make the files there findable.

If you do decide to modify texmf-local, the best place to do it is
in /usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf.cnf, i.e.  in <root>/texmf.cnf with
e.g. a line

TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOGRANDPARENT/texmf-local;/usr/share/texmf

Doing it with environment variables is considered less desirable.

Message-ID: <201501162252.t0GMqStd017165@freefriends.org>

My thought is to make symlinks specifically to sagetex.sty and its doc
file(s) in the existing texmf-local for TL. 

Just to note: as I understand it, any given version of sagetex may or
may not work with any given version of TL.  That's why they removed it
from CTAN and asked me to remove it from TL in the first place.  (I
don't know specifically what would break, just repeating the warnings
they told me.)

    TEXMFLOCAL to include multiple trees is not encouraged

I wouldn't say so much that it's not encouraged as that someone who does
so should be very clear on what they are doing, just like modifying any
environment variable or other settings.  (And it doesn't solve your
particular problem, anyway, as you pointed out.)

Good luck,
Karl

Under section 3.2.3 "Directories" in http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#installation

it's said

"This can be overridden by setting TEXDIR in the installer. The main reason to change it is if you lack write permission for the default location. "

This should better be

"This can be overridden by setting the shell environment variable
TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX before starting the installer.
The main reason to change it is if you lack write permission for the default
location, or if there is less than roughly 3.9 GB of space
left on the root partition on your file system."

Some TeX Live users are not familiar with the ways to manage environment
variables, so please consider providing examples for Windows and POSIX sh.

In which case, please omit the word "shell" from the proposed text. 
Windows users do not use shells, although many/most are familiar with 
the concept of the CMD prompt.

Message-ID: <62E46142-0948-4BA7-99AA-1CB67B34A085@axelkielhorn.de>

Hi,

I am currently learning ConTeXT in order to give a tutorial at the Dante meeting in april.
I would like to say that everything needed is already included in TeX Live, but I discovered that some modules are missing:

> animation/     GPL 3

> visualcounter/ Simplified BSD License

Since I see no reason to not include them (except for Space on the DVD) I would like to ask to include them in TL 2015.

Greetings Axel

i had always understood that tl gets its context pre-digested -- what
ctan has is a series of zips which iirc are mirrored (not by cambridge,
so i can't easily say where, but i've always assumed it's somewhere on
the context site).

since tl always starts from ctan, it rather looks as if you need to go
upstream to the context people for your request.

robin the non-contexter who manages the aforesaid mirror.

ps -- the other possible issue is that the packages aren't available on
a free licence.  i've found context contrib entries really shy about
licence information, and tl insists on a clear statement of licence.

Looking at CTAN, I found some of the modules, but not all of them.
I will take this to the Context list.

This looks good to me.

Even if the support files are GPLed (CTAN says Public
Domain), the fonts themselves are non-commercial.

remembering, as we do, that tex live doesn't hold files whose sole
purpose is to support commercial products.

Of course you are right.
The fonts get installed by getnonfreefonts into texmf-local.

No need to include the support files into TeX Live.

Just playing around on windows (7) a bit.

I noticed that if I install TL14 with admin rights (run as admin), then a non privileged user cannot start the manager via the start menu 

However, they can use tlmgr from the command line just fine to install extra packages, and they go directly into the C:/texlive/2014/texmf-dist

What is the recommended method for setting up TL in a computer lab where the students are not allowed to change the LaTeX installation (admin job to make sure it TL is up to date)?

I do not know they (the admins) are likely to allow placing TeX Live on a read only net share.

Yes, this is a loophole. The UAC prompt was only intended for
accidental mishaps, but I can understand that for a computer lab it
is not good enough.

Look at the icacls command-line utility to set the ACL (access
control list) for the TL directory.

I had a chat with one of the windows admins. ACL is the way to go, I think they are going to control it via AD somehow.

I did a test on a standalone win7 just to test it.

The key group is the pseudo group "Authenticated users", on my Win7 it has the same permission as "Users" plus "Allow Write". Removing that "Alow write" is a bit hairy (note that using "Deny write" is not a good idea as then even admin cannot change the files), but here is how I did it in a vertual win7 just as a reference for others


right click on c:\texlive, properties, security

Choose "Authenticated users"

Hit the advaned button

Under the "permissions" tab,  again choose "Authenticated userrs", also

remove the tick mark under "Include inheritable permissions from object's parent" (otherwise we cannot edit it)

now press "Change permissions"

Again choose "Authenticated user" and press "Edit"

For my test I gave "Allow" to the following entries

Traverse folder / execute file
List folder / read data
Read attributes
Read extended attributes
Read permissions

Hit OK/Apply all the way back out.

Now tlmgr can only be executed via run as admin or via admin dos promt, normal users get a read only error.


Seems to be a good solution for computer labs.
