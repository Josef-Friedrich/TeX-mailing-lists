Greetings.

Sorry the basic question but I would like to ask about the right way to
upgrade from 2014 to 2015 release.

TeX Live 2015 has not been released, so we do not make any statements
about *whether* it is possible to upgrade from 2014 to 2015, or
whether a new install is necessary.

I can contribute yet another test case where biber 2.0 aborts with
error. It happens when the macro \DH (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER ETH) appears
e.g. in an author's name:

% ---------------------------------
\begin{filecontents}{bibertest.bib}
@InProceedings{bibkey1,
author       = {Namewith\DH},
title        = {Title},
booktitle    = {Booktitle},
location     = {Location},
date         = {2015-05-01},
langid       = {english},
}
\end{filecontents}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{bibertest.bib}
\begin{document}
\nocite{*}
\printbibliography
\end{document}

But it works if you do

author       = {Namewith\DH{}inside},

so the culprit is not the macro \DH per se.

I tried to. But my attempts to create a new ticket in the bug tracker
end up with error 403. Don't know if I'm doing something wrong.

Sorry for a slow reply, but didn't have access to the MacBook.

I finally downloaded the MacTeX and Texmaker to my Linux machine,
transferred to a USB Key, copied over to the Mac and installed it
there. Installation of both went well.

I tried this morning to download the MacTeX.pkg file from the TUG site,
and still may not be getting what I need. A file MacTeX.pkg.download
shows up in the Download folder. I found the terminal on the MacBook. I
discovered that the downloaded MacTeX file is a folder. It contains two
files, Info.plst and MacTeX.pkg. The latter is 3.75 Mg/Gb and remains
that size. I'm beginning to suspect this is a network installer rather
than a self-contained TeX system.

It may be that I had suceeded without realizing it. It never occurred to
me that a download installer would be a folder. If so, the ".download"
file extension does not mean a download in process, but this is a
downloaded file. The folder can't be clicked to start the installation,
and my guess is that I can start the installation from the terminal
by simply entering the MacTeX.pkg binary. But this is not what the
instructions say to do. There does not seem to be an icon for the .pkg
file to click, but I don't know much about the GUI world and mices.

It's not a complete download. Safari will fix the name up and you'll just have a .pkg when the download is complete.

There is definitely a bug in gs 9.15 which prevents gs to find certain
files in its search path (GS_LIB).  Concerned are at least East Asian
fonts.  So you have to upgrade to 9.16 anyway.

Hi karl and Norbert and CS developers,

I would like to ask what is the status of Czechoslovak translation and what
is the time schedule. I will have some time during this weekend and I
already have poedit installed, so I could translate new messages in tlmgr.
would it be sufficient to submit the translation by Sunday midnithg (US
time)?

Hello,

I tried to do experiments with the example given at

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/242218/

because OP mentioned the XeTeX version is 3.14159265-2.6-0.99992, i.e. the 
binary form TL pretest. The behavior at my system is slight different than 
what reports OP. The PDF isn't generated because of xdvipdfmx fatal error. 
I created more simple MWE for such experiments:

    \font\f="Nimbus Roman No9 L"
    \nopagenumbers
    \f ABC
    \end

Now, I tried to run XeTeX from TLpretest:

   xetex test
   This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99992 (TeX Live 2015) (preloaded
   format=xetex)
    restricted \write18 enabled.
   entering extended mode
   (./test.tex [1]
   xdvipdfmx:fatal: sfnt: table not found...

If I try to do this step by step in order to get more information:

   xetex --no-pdf test
   This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99992 (TeX Live 2015) (preloaded
   format=xetex)

It seems that xdvipdfmx is trying to treat n021003l.pfb as a TrueType or 
OpenType (sfnt-format) font, which is clearly incorrect; it's a legacy 
PS Type 1 file. Your test with the 2014 version indicates this was not 
happening at that time.

There have been quite a lot of updates to font handling in xdvipdfmx 
recently, judging from the SVN log; I hope one of the developers who has 
been working on this can take a look and figure out why this is going wrong.

One difference in your logs is that the <NATIVE-FONTMAP: ...> reported 
for the Nimbus font was marked with [square brackets] in the 2014 
version, but these are absent in 2015. But I haven't looked into the

Howdy,

Using tlmgr via TeX Live Utility on the Mac I had an infrastructure update failure for TL2015-pretest today. Problem was that the new version had the same  version number as the older version.

Good Luck,

Here on windows it went smooth, version number was clearly different:

| [05.05.2015  6:57:31,84] self update: texlive.infra (37141 -> 37176)

My guess is that update-tlmgr-latest.sh wasn't updated
(TLU applies that instead of letting tlmgr update itself).
Looking at the HMC repo, update-tlmgr-latest.sh was
modified on 3 May at 1846, but archive/texlive.infra.tar.xz
was modified on 4 May at 1821.

Petr (Sojka), will you be able to do that this year?

    and what is the time schedule. I will have some time during this
    weekend and I already have poedit installed, so I could translate
    new messages in tlmgr.  would it be sufficient to submit the
    translation by Sunday midnithg (US time)?

Sunday morning is just fine for doc updates, both manual and strings.

I already commited Czech cs.po and will do Czechoslovak
translation of tldoc with Jano Busa (I actually started today

OK, if cs.po is translated and the translation is so urgent, I could help
during Friday and Saturday. Can I get the right to commit in order to be
more efficient? (I have been actively using svn for several years and also
have been maintaining several repositories on my server.)

It's not so urgent -- May 15 is my goal to have the doc updates all
committed.  Of course, sooner is always better.  I expect Petr and Jano
will be able to take care of texlive-cz.

    code points marked as ideographs in LineBreak.txt are set as catcode 11
    in LuaTeX, based on the pattern set by unicode-letters.tex and the Perl
    script which is used to generate this file.

    Most probably this area needs revision, at least to bring category codes
    into line between LuaTeX and XeTeX. 

Joseph, has there been any outcome on this wrt luatex?

I just changed the plain xetex.ini to load (a copy of) latex's new
unicode-letters.def instead of unicode-letters.tex, since no substantive
differences were evident (as you intended :).  I left the rest of
xetex.ini untouched -- some of it is duplicated elsewhere in latex, but
I doubt it's worth factoring that out.

That just leaves plain luatex using [luatex-]unicode-letters.tex, as far
as I know.  I'd like to either unify that or update it for current
Unicode, and soon.

The version of the manual (as included in texlive 2015 pretest) seems to

version 0.80.0 (eg that's the version given in the banner in section 2.2

But the yellow title cover page says

beta 0.79.3

Could that be changed to 0.80.0 ?

Hi!

http://ctan.org/pkg/ifxetex claims that the version of ifxetex
distributed by texlive is 0.5 and the copyright is from 2006-2008.

When one clicks on the 'Package documentation' link, the PDF that one
gets says it's version 0.6 and has a date of 2010/09/12.

This looks like the tlpobj file needs updating :)

Cheers,
 Thomas

No. CTAN needs updating ... Can you forward your message to CTAN

The relocatable key No value is presumably a catalogue error.

Well, this is strictly speaking correct, as soon as the package
is installed it is not relocatable anymore.

THe display of information is misleading. I am not sure, maybe I drop
the relocatable information for installed packages completely, 
as it is irrelevant, or show the value from the remote tlpdb.

I checked, and in the tlpretest tlpdb entry for etoc there is
correctly 
	relocated 1
meaning that a user can install it in user mode. That is all.

Hope that clarifies things.

I had been reading http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html and
wanted to try a few things. (on my pretest installation)

All packages (corresponding to LaTeX macro packages)
which I tried returned relocatable: Yes. 

I tried a few more this morning: hyperref babel newtx framed
kpfonts mathdesign newtxtt tabulary and all returned 
   relocatable: Yes
apart from newtx

Thus relocatable means "user-mode-installable" ?

It also helped me clarify to myself that I had been entertaining 
in my mind a confusion between "packages for TeX Live repos"
and "(generally) packages as bundled macro style files"

For example "tlmgr info newtxmath", or "tlmgr info tabularx"
both fail because those are indeed LaTeX packages, but they
are bundled into bigger things for TeX Live installation.

I do not see in the doc of tlmgr an action which given 
say foo.sty would return the corresponding TeXLive package ?

tlmgr which etoc      ->  
    "TeX Live package etoc"
tlmgr which tabularx   ->  
    "No TL package "tabularx". Perhaps you meant tabularx.sty ?
     Try out TeX Live package tools"
tlmgr which newtxmath ->  
    "No TL package with this name, but perhaps you will be interested
     in TL package newtx? indeed, among the 1878 run files installed
     with it, I could recognize newtxmath.sty"

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Indeed indeed, in the current tlpretest installation of mine
I also have:

mathdesign:
	relocated 1

etoc:
	relocated 0


while in the tlpretest tlpdb itself I have:
mathdesign:
	relocated 1

etoc:
	relocated 1


THat is interesting... I have to investigate this. 

My *GUESS* is that packages that have bene added *LATER* via tlmgr
have *no* relocated entry (as it does not make sense for them),
and packages that were installed during install-tl have relocated 1.

I need to invest, thanks for pointing me at that.

Yes. That is the only meaning.

Yes indeed.

$ tlmgr search --file tabularx.sty

	texmf-dist/tex/latex/tools/tabularx.sty

Maybe, yes, maybe merge the "search" into "info" .... need to think.

I think initially I wanted to check the doc on "tlmgr platform add" 
because earlier in the day I had added x86_64-linux to a a prior
i386-linux,

but then I ended up playing with tlmgr info

a propos "tlmgr platform add", it ended with 

    tlmgr ended with a warning

or perhaps it was rather

    tlmgr: action platform ended with a warning

but I wasn't told which warning. Some tlmgr $? would give it?

Later, before going to bed I decided
to check the html doc to learn how to get this warning
explicitely and drifted away with the info thing

the warning: I thought today I would find it in the tlmgr.log
file (on the distant machine where I did this yestereday) but
checking now I see in

  /---/texlive/2015/texmf-var/web2c/
only the output of tlmgr update actions

 
Here is another example with a warning:

~$ tlmgr info newtxmath
tlmgr: package repository /Users/---/Downloads/tlpretest
tlmgr: cannot find package newtxmath
tlmgr: action info returned a warning.

I am not worried about that, but yesterday after adding
platform x86_64-linux, I didn't know what had triggered the
warning.

(to make a long story short: after years of suffering 
with an obsolete TL2004, then a less obsolete TL2007, then
an even less obsolete TL2010 but no hope to get it updated
anytime soon, and thus with over the years hundreds of megabytes 
(including fonts) manually added to my ~/texmf, I was endangering 
a ridiculously small quota I have to live under, (the quota
ten years ago was perhaps at 200M... it got multiplied by 10 
after I adopted a life threatening attitude, but still)
... I finally understood last month that somewhere
on the file system there was no quota, thus I could
make there a full-install of TL2015. However when I connect
via ssh I end up on a 64bit machine, and not the 32bit machine
I am physically on overthere.)

I initially did a scheme=full install of TeXLive pretest,
thus in the case of etoc, it was indeed _updated_ later, but
it already existed before inthe tlpdb

Thanks, I understand now. Indeed relocatable appears only twice
in the full tlmgr html doc, when discussing user-mode

Thanks for pointing that out. I though to have read from A to Z
the html doc, but I must have been asleep already. The search
action is exactly what I was looking for.

I must hasten to add that I followed a weird course:

not knowing about platform add, I initially moved my 2015
to 2015-saved, did a scheme=basic install on the 64bit machine,
then moved the bin/x86_65-linux repertory into 2015-saved,
removed the 2015, renamed the 2015-saved to 2015

only later did I discover tlmgr platform add, and I did it

Perhaps I see in the log only update actions because the
install detected the files were already there ?

Message-ID: <CAFWv8DOJJEU9AFzP0o28dFaOTv19WpTGJOn3o_3cw1hJJ9FLpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

After running the following example,

    % !TeX program  = XeLaTeX
    \RequirePackage[2014/01/01]{latexrelease}
    \newXeTeXintercharclass\foo
    \stop

an error occurred:

    ! Undefined control sequence.
    \newXeTeXintercharclass ->\e at alloc
                                       \XeTeXcharclass \chardef
\xe at alloc@interc...
    l.3 \newXeTeXintercharclass
                               \foo
    ?

It seems that \newXeTeXintercharclass is always defined in LaTeX 2015/01/01,
while \e at alloc is not defined correspondingly.

I can copy some codes from xetex.ini to fix this issue,

    \makeatletter

    \IncludeInRelease{0000/00/00}{\newXeTeXintercharclass}{Extended Allocation}
    %
    % Allocator for \XeTeXcharclass values, from Enrico Gregorio
    %
    \newcount\xe at alloc@intercharclass % allocates intercharclass
    \xe at alloc@intercharclass=\thr@@ % from 4 (1,2 and 3 are used by CJK, AFAIK)
    \def\xe at alloc@#1#2#3#4#5{\global\advance#1\@ne
     \xe at ch@ck#1#4#2% make sure there's still room
     \allocationnumber#1%
     \global#3#5\allocationnumber
     \wlog{\string#5=\string#2\the\allocationnumber}}
    \def\xe at ch@ck#1#2#3{%
     \ifnum#1<#2\else
      \errmessage{No room for a new #3}%
     \fi}
    \def\newXeTeXintercharclass{%
     \xe at alloc@\xe at alloc@intercharclass\XeTeXcharclass\chardef\@cclv}
%at most 254
    \EndIncludeInRelease

    \makeatother

But I don't think this is a good workaround.

Best,
Qing Lee

I have changed tlmgr to do something like this. Is this what you would expect:

$ tlmgr info tabularx
tlmgr: package repository /var/www/norbert/tlpretest
tlmgr: cannot find package tabularx, searching for other matches:

Packages containing `tabularx' in their title/description:
carlisle - David Carlisle's small packages.
linegoal - A "dimen" that returns the space left on the line.
ltablex - Table package extensions.
numprint - Print numbers with separators and exponent if necessary.
tabu - Flexible LaTeX tabulars.
tabulary - Tabular with variable width columns balanced.
tools - The LaTeX standard tools bundle.
widetable - An environment for typesetting tables of specified width

Packages containing files matching `tabularx':
bidi:
	texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/bidi/test-tabularx.tex
	texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/bidi/tabularx-xetex-bidi.def

Hi Norbert

this amply satisfies my query ;-)

I discover the --global
option to the "search" action, will the
extended "info" action also accept it ?

the CTAN pages have a "see also" bit of 
information on package pages, the extended 
"info" would be a strong competitor for
people wishing to identify the well-established
packages in an area they previously don't 
know

ah, but --global does not work like I thought.
I tried with a minimal install (from the rsynced
to my disk tlpretest mirror) and here is what
I get:

~$ tlmgr search tabularx
 carlisle - David Carlisle's small packages.
 tools - The LaTeX standard tools bundle.

~$ tlmgr search tabularx --global
tlmgr: package repository /Users/---/Downloads/TEMP
 carlisle - David Carlisle's small packages.
 tools - The LaTeX standard tools bundle.

no, I understand, it is this problem with the
repository being wrong when doing such an install
(if that matters I did this with
 <O> options:
   [ ] use letter size instead of A4 by default
   [X] allow execution of restricted list of programs via \write18
   [ ] create all format files
   [ ] install macro/font doc tree
   [ ] install macro/font source tree
   [ ] create symlinks to standard directories
   [ ] after install, use tlnet on CTAN for package updates
)

~$ tlmgr option repository 
Default package repository (repository): .

~$ tlmgr option repository /Users/---/Downloads/tlpretest
tlmgr: setting default package repository to /Users/---/Downloads/tlpretest

~$ tlmgr search tabularx --global
tlmgr: package repository /Users/---/Downloads/tlpretest
 carlisle - David Carlisle's small packages.
 linegoal - A "dimen" that returns the space left on the line.
 ltablex - Table package extensions.
 numprint - Print numbers with separators and exponent if necessary.
 tabu - Flexible LaTeX tabulars.
 tabulary - Tabular with variable width columns balanced.
 tools - The LaTeX standard tools bundle.
 widetable - An environment for typesetting tables of specified width

Bye,

Jean-Fran?ois

Karl: tlpretest as updated this morning
does say

Hi all,

after seeing reports on \newXeTeXintercharclass I reprocessed my document
that makes use of both xevlna and ucharclasses packages. Both packages make
use of this primitive and the document was compiled without any error. I
have not checked all line breaks but it seems that 2015 gives the same
output as 2014.

actually I think that probably is a good workaround.
probably if   \RequirePackage[2014/01/01]{latexrelease} is specified
I should have undefined \newXeTeXintercharclass as well but that would just
have slightly changed the error message you got.

That's the consistent thing for the latex core to do as old releases
didn't define this
however of course in practice the format used did have the definition,
coming from the
ini file.

Currently the ini file is restructed to just making definitions
_before_ latex.ltx is loaded
so it might be best if we put this into latex.ltx, I'll discuss it
with the latex team.

as a matter of interest, did you need
\RequirePackage[2014/01/01]{latexrelease}
or did this come from a test file, didn't expect it to be used much
with extended tex formats
which by nature are subject to change anyway, so freezing th emacro
package is less useful
than with classic tex.

Actually I meant put it in the latex sources, it would not affect
latex.ltx or the format, just add
the \IncludeInRelease block that you showed to latexrelease.sty

I tried out \newXeTeXintercharclass\foo in plain and latex with
TL2014, 2013 and 2012 and it never gave an error. So it was defined
by default (probably in xelatex.ini, but I didn't check) already for
quite a long time and so imho shouldn't be undefined (or fail)
suddenly only because the newest LaTeX-format isn't used.

If you use an old format or the default usage of the new format then
it's defined.
It's only undefined if you use the new format and then use
latexrelease to make it
emulate an old one.

I think the two justifiable positions for the emulation would be:

to make it undefined (the part you quoted)
(because it wasn't defined in the old core latex release)

or to define it (the part I said we should probably do)
(because it was defined in the old ini file)

Actually what happens now is that all the inner workings are
undefined, but the top level
macro is left defined so you get an undefined command error on an internal macro
which is not so nice... (sorry:-)

This information is not available in the tlpdb, and also
not available unless visiting the CTAN site, thus tlmgr
is currently not able to provide this information.

If this information is stored within the TeX Catalogue,
then I can add this kind of data to the tlpdb on the
TeX Catalogue/TLPDB merge, but as far as I know it is
not contained in the TeX Catalogue.

Yes, this are the alternatives. On the whole I think that most user
would claim that the "latex core format" is the fmt and so based
one the kernel *and* the ini and would find it nit-picking to
exclude a definition only because it was in the ini and not the
kernel. 

I know that maintaining compability is not easy, but
\newXeTeXintercharclass is imho quite important and should if
possible work.

I also think that most users won't use latexrelease and so problably
never see this problem ;-).

Hello,

I'm new here, so I hope this is the right place to report this.

I have a problem with the lacheck utility (in utils/lacheck in the
source tree), which if I understand correctly is being maintained here.
The problem is that lacheck segfaults on the attached segfault.tex file.
(I tested it by running ./lacheck segfault.tex with lacheck compiled
from the latest source tree, and also with the lacheck package version
1.26-15 on Debian.) This segfault.tex file is a minified example of a
real-world file that also triggers the bug.

Does this segfault also occur for you? Can something be done about it?

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

Hi, I subscribe to the list but I am not involved into TeX-Live,
I tried out:

here is the output pasted with \ddd octal notation to avoid sending bad 
non ascii characters :

I can confirm this on my system.  The crash occurs in print_bad_match(), when 
lacheck is trying to report "unmatched end of file".  At this point gstackp == 
0, and the macro CG_FILE in lacheck.l:1063 makes an illegal memory access 
gstack[-1].

A quick fix for this specific case would be to insert a check for gstackp == 0 
in print_bad_match (and maybe exiting at this point).  But I don't know if that 
would solve the underlying problem.  There may be other places where the CG_* 
macros are called when the stack might be empty.  Would it be too drastic to 
modify these macros so that they always check whether gstackp == 0?

Hi,

this is for two or three suggestions for the TeX Live Guide,
anyhow I wake up too late for TL2015 surely, sorry about
that, perhaps for TL2016 ? 

I have three remarks:

1) a great deal of attention is devoted to Windows, and much less
so to some specifics of the Mac OS X brand of Unix.

Regarding XeTeX on Mac OS X in particular, I will be corrected if
I am wrong, which is quite possible, this information on making
TeX Live fonts visible to XeTeX is, afaik, incorrect

   3.4.4 System font configuration for XeTEX and LuaTEX .... 

   But if you have installed the xetex package on a
   Unix-compatible system, you need to configure your system....
   To set up the TEX Live fonts for system-wide use (assuming you
   have suitable privileges), proceed as follows:

     - Copy the texlive-fontconfig.conf file to /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf.
     - Run fc-cache -fsv.

XeTeX does not use this on Mac OS X, as far as I know, at least I
recall having followed the instructions some 3 to 5 years ago, got
bitten by it and moved forward to other things. Perhaps it changed
since?

I never understood how to let XeTeX see the TeX Live fonts except
via making them known to the Mac OS itself via the System GUI
(FontBook I think). Else, I must use "ExternalLocation" key to
\setmainfont from fontspec package, PLUS use filenames (not font
names).

Again this bit of experience may be now *completely invalid*, sorry
about that if this is actually the case. 

xetex-reference.pdf (dated May 21, 2013) does say that fontconfig
library is not used on Mac OS X (just checked) but I couldn't find
any further info within it either.

2) the "tlmgr" is the tool to manage one's TeX Live installation
and I find it rather under-documented in Section 5 of
texlive-en.html, in contrast to 

    i) the install process

   ii) the kpathsea/Web2C library

"tlmgr search" and "tlmgr info" are great tools to discover the
available things from command line, hence for GNU/Linux **and** Mac OS
X users. They are not documented in the TeX Live Guide. (didn't find them)

3) in contrast the Web2C/kpathsea is amply documented.

but this information is for some large part mainly relevant (now)
 to developers, not users. Indeed the time of the pk fonts is for
 99% of users gone, with the overwhelming use of pdf format with
 .pfb fonts or OpenType fonts, and
 even in dvi format for most fonts no use is made of pk bitmap
 fonts anymore. Thus all these detailed informations about file
 searching, which was very much relevant ten years ago is now very
 overwhelming for the average user, and I doubt very much many of
 them will read completely to the end.

Said otherwise: it works so well that average user does not
need to know the gory details

and vz fonts, perhaps the main point to stress is the dangers
of any use of updmap rather than updmap-sys

To summarize, my proposals are 

 - if possible, include some more details on the (mostly font related)
 area where Mac OS X differs from GNU/Linux,

 - detail tlmgr use as comprehensively as has been done for the 
installation process itself

 - move a large portion of the Web2C/kpathsea documentation to a
separate documentation for "system administrators and developers"

thanks for all the hard work, and sorry for expressing these
opinions too late for 2015

best wishes

Jean-Fran?ois

Have you considered adding compiled kpathsea (and possibly other?)
libraries to TeX Live?  As far as I can tell, there's no simple way to
do this at present.

We use a set of perl bindings for the kpathsea library internally here
at the AMS, so every time we upgrade to a new version of TeX Live, I
rummage through the source code and compile the libraries separately.
If the libraries were installed by default (or at least as part of an
optional package), I'd consider releasing the perl bindings.  It would
presumably be pretty easy to put together similar bindings for python,
etc.

Hi Herb,

thanks for the info, I didn't know about "creating a new Library" 
in FontBook. And about copying fonts into ~/Library/Fonts I never
went through this step as it seemed a waste of disk space ...


> Note: under OS X if you reference the font by Font Name rather than File Name xetex uses the OS to find the file. However, if you reference the font by File Name it will find the font in the texmf-dist/fonts/opentype folder.


and if one uses filenames it seems in my (renewed) experience 

1) one must use ExternalLocation option to \setmainfont
2) bold, italic, bold-italic variants with corresponding filenames 
must be listed explicitely


> Yes, fontconfig is not used under OS X.
> 

thanks for the confirmation. 

I am on 10.9.5 (mavericks). I experimented with your indications.

I will make a long story short because I spent two, no three, 
hours on this already.

1) I made the texmf-dist/fonts/opentype  repertory known to FontBook
as a "New Library" and it (sort of) worked

1a) I skip the details see however attached png about a problem
with Inconsolatazi-Bold

2) however FontBook would then take at least 2 or 3 minutes to
launch

3) then I removed (manually) the created xml file
"TeX OpenType Fonts.library" from
$HOME/Library/FontCollections, launched and quit FontBook

4) then the test file using TeX Gyre Termes still worked !

5) after 45 minutes it stopped working. Ok, I figured, some cached
file finally was removed

6) I redo the steps, but only with TeX Gyre repertory, because
I had learned my lesson about not overloading FontBook

7) currently simple test file does *not* work anymore (but see
end of message)

> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{fontspec}
> \setmainfont{TeX Gyre Termes}
> \begin{document}
> 
> Hello world.
> 
> \textbf{Hello world.}
> 
> \textit{Hello world.}
> 
> \end{document}


Currently all TeX Gyre files do show perfectly well
in FontBook (quit relaunch, quit relaunch, ok)
but simple test file does not compile with any one.

I discovered during my testings that XCharter works
There is

/..../texmf-dist/tex/latex/xcharter/XCharter.fontspec 

which seems to help out fontspec.

\defaultfontfeatures[XCharter]
  {
  Extension = .otf ,
  BoldFont = XCharter-Bold,
  ItalicFont = XCharter-Italic,
  BoldItalicFont = XCharter-BoldItalic,
  UprightFont = XCharter-Roman,
  SmallCapsFeatures =  {Letters=SmallCaps}
  }

Is this some hint that this could be the packaging of the
future for bundled TeXLive OpenType fonts and that they
would work out-of-the-box with XeTeX on Mac OS X ?

I have to report on another thing which happened, while
I first tried to make known the full texmf-dist/fonts/opentype
repertory to FontBook : 

--- This process found problems with Inconsolatazi4-Bold
--- (see attached png) and with the fonts whose names start
--- with  "Fandol"

I understand this not the appropriate mailing list to dwell on 
the user interface of Apple Mavericks Font Book but I just
want to point out that in my experience it appears to be
broken in various ways. I experienced  curious things.

I was hoping that it would be possible to generate via a script
directly the xml file I see that FontBook creates in 

$HOME/Library/FontCollections

but that was at a time I though the whole thing actually did work.

UPDATE: it now works again ! (Adventor, Pagella, Bonum, etc...)
and removing the Library from FontBook it immediately ceased
working. And re-adding it, it worked again. Don't know what
happened.


best wishes

Hi,

I am need of list of commands, but I don'i like


I included this:

\renewcommand{\lstlistingname}{Listagem}% Listing -> Algorithm
\renewcommand{\lstlistlistingname}{Listagem de comandos}% List of Listings

And this:



\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Par?metros do

Highcharts.setOptions({

Hi Jean-Fran?ois,
it's true that the installer is described more elaborately than other
things in The TeX Live Guide because this is the only document people
read before they install TL.  Once TeX Live is installed, more
documentation is available via texdoc, man, info, and <progname> --help.

I think that The TeX Live Guide shouldn't try to explain everything
in detail but tell people how to get further information.

I'm on Linux and thus don't know whether relevant points regarding OS
X are missing.

Windows definitely needs extra documentation due to significant
differences.  Not only the system is completely different but there
are replacements for some programs which are ubiquitous on Unix
systems but not available on Windows, etc.

 >  - detail tlmgr use as comprehensively as has been done for the 
 > installation process itself

As I said before, the installation process has to be explained in detail
because at this stage no other documentation is available.  Instead of
mentioning some of tlmgr's features, I'm convinced that users benefit
more when pointed to the complete documentation (tlmgr --help;
texdoc tlmgr; man tlmgr).

Full documentation can be accessed easily as PDF when TL is installed
(texdoc web2c; texdoc kpathsea).  And The TeX Live Guide contains
links to the HTML docs @tug.org already.

Do you ask for duplication because The TeX Live Guide is translated to
other languages?  I don't know whether developers really need these
translations.  Computers speak English.  If documentation is needed in
other languages though, it makes more sense to me to translate the
original texinfo sources instead, not only excerpts.

If we want that people read the document at all, it shouldn't be too
big.  Ideally it explains what users have to know before TL is
installed and how to get additional information later.  But links to
stuff @tug.org are ok.

IMO texdoc could be metioned more often in the document.  I fear that
still many users aren't aware of it.  This is a real pity.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I confirm that the problem is fixed for me, both on segfault.tex and on
my actual file. In fact I tested running the fixed lacheck on all TeX
files I have on my box, and none seem to make it return a non-zero exit
code.

Thanks a lot for fixing this so quickly!

Hi David,

    Have you considered adding compiled kpathsea (and possibly other?)
    libraries to TeX Live?  

Sure, we've considered it.  All the support for it is in the sources, as
you know -- that's not an accident.  The problem is deploying them in a
useful way.  In my experience, there is no way for a third party like us
to release shared libraries intended for general use and have them be
anything but a source of frustration.

You could release your Perl bindings regardless of what is or isn't in
TL -- I see no reason not to.  Most distros do include kpathsea
libraries.  So most users would like your bindings to work with those
libraries, rather than anything that could come with TL.

best,
karl

THis is not a support forum for LaTeX, but a mailing list to
coordinate the development of TeX Live.

Please contact your local user group, one of the many resources
on the web (tex.stackexchange is *very* useful), or proper mailing lists.

Thanks.

Just out of wonder

What exactly are you using those libs for?

Subject: [tex-live] Add include and lib directories to TeX live?

Have you considered adding compiled kpathsea (and possibly other?)
libraries to TeX Live?  As far as I can tell, there's no simple way to
do this at present.

We use a set of perl bindings for the kpathsea library internally here
at the AMS, so every time we upgrade to a new version of TeX Live, I
rummage through the source code and compile the libraries separately.
If the libraries were installed by default (or at least as part of an
optional package), I'd consider releasing the perl bindings.  It would
presumably be pretty easy to put together similar bindings for python,
etc.

Fair enough.

Sure, but it's a lot easier to write installation instructions if I
can just say "install this package" rather than "find the source code
and...".  My memory (and it's been a couple of years since I last did
it) is that it was more than just connecting to the kpathsea directory
in the texlive source code directory and then typing configure and
make.  But I might have missed something.

That's not clear to me, but it's moot.

It could be useful to see if this is worth resurrecting with your
bindings.  There was also a python-kpathsea
that used the library and headers in TeTeX.

For OS X, macports' texlive installs kpathsea libraires, headers, and
documents.

Where I work we use a Fortran source program for teaching and found
that installing Octave was the easiest way to get a working Fortran compiler
with the libraries we needed installed in student labs using Windows.  I
think
Octave no longer uses kpathsea, but someone may know of other applications
that provide a kpathsea library for Windows.

    Sure, but it's a lot easier to write installation instructions if I
    can just say "install this package" 

Understood, though of course you're not obligated to write installation
instructions to cover all cases (or at all).  In fact, I don't think it
would be remotely feasible to do so.  Getting Perl (or anything) to
dynamically load a shared library in a nonstandard location is
inherently a complicated, error-prone, painful operation.  Doing it in a
way that is portable in any way at all (across OS versions, across Perl
versions, across kpse versions) seems impossible to me.

    is that it was more than just connecting to the kpathsea directory
    in the texlive source code directory and then typing configure and
    make.

Indeed, it is more than that.  What I would suggest, for right now, is
linking to the manual that Peter (mainly) wrote about building TeX Live
-- http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html.

We don't have an exact recipe in there for building just kpathsea as a
shared library, but we could add it.  That's what a user of native TL
will have to do, as things stand.  (There's an example for building a
single program at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html#Build-one-package; building the
one library would be similar, though of course devil+details ...)

Of course, it's going to be up to the user to install it (somewhere),
and get your bindings to see it (somehow).  We can't document that part.

    I assume you mean Linux distributions?

And BSD, and third-party collections for Solaris/whatever, etc.

    > So most users would like your bindings to work with those

    That's not clear to me, 

Just FWIW ... from eyeballing support requests in various forums, my
sense is that a large proportion of people use miktex; of those who use
gnu/linux, my impression is that more use what their distro provides
than the native tl.  Perhaps the single largest group using native tl
are on macs using mactex.  Just my feeling.

(In an attempt to forestall the usual follow-ups at this point: I know
of no feasible way to gather reliable statistics on this perennial
question.  Lots of ways to gather unreliable statistics, but ... :)

Do you have a different feeling from what's incoming to AMS?
Just curious.

    but it's moot.

Ack :).

I suppose the non-use of fontconfig in Mac OS X is the main point,
thus the information given by Herb about the simplest, no hassle
way, to let XeTeX work with the TexLive distributed OpenType fonts
would be the thing to add.

There might be some other issues related to which versions
of ghostscript or Image magick convert to have or not, but
if people go the MacTeX way all will have been pre-resolved for them,
perhaps a pointer to some document on MacTeX site, if it exists.

There was an issue which arose with Yosemite about moving
things out of /usr/local before any major system upgrade and move
them back in. This was very well documented by Herbert Schulz 
and Richard Koch on
http://tug.org/mactex/yosemite.html
just inserting the link in the TeX Live Guide would help

In this context, I personally recommend people do a once and for all
sudo chown -R user /usr/local/texlive, and also for the texmf-local
this solves a lot of hassles.

Yes, I should not have expressed myself in a whining

on Mac OS, thus I complain" mode

Looking again, it might be only a matter of adding one example
with the tlmgr info (now that it has incorporated earlier
"search" and "list" facilities)

I wasn't meaning duplication, but excision from the TeX Live
Guide of some portions of the kpathsea/web2c.

Naturally, mentioning the executables bundled with web2c
as is currently done at the start of 7 A user?s guide to Web2C 
is indispensable.

But the somewhat detailed description of the syntax for texmf.cnf
files which comes afterwards might be a bit overwhelming 
for a user who just completed the installation (and thus had the 
customization done via the install-tl, and not in need at that
point to go into fiddling with the whole thing), and also a bit
overwhelming (to me) is the developed example of debugging a failed
compilation  7.2.4 Debugging actions.

I understand the difficulties with multi-lingual documentation.

It makes it hard to remove pieces, the whole thing has a natural
tendency to become incremental.

About incremental: the History section appears to me extremely
important and useful, for people who have gained some familiarity
with the system after one or two years of use.

there could possibly be a common section "Main tools for everyday
installation management"

tlmgr: updating an installation, exploring available things within
the installation, ...

kpsewhich: explain that files in <workingrepertory> have priority on files
in TEXMFHOME which have priority on files in TEXMFLOCAL which have
priority in TEXMFMAIN/DIST, a bit about TDS, how to use then kpsewhich
to check which foo.sty etc ... is actually used.

texdoc: insist on the quasi mandatory option -l or --list, because often
nowadays important info is in README's or other files which typically
are given less priority than foo.pdf. I often find that people do
not include in the main foo.pdf the changes from previous releases,
and that the README or some other file is the fastest path to that
information. If one gets into the habit of doing tlmgr update --all, 
one wants to see what changed when a package got updated.

mktexlsr and updmap-sys, mainly for adding fonts to texmf-local.

Hi David,

at the moment there is no way to build the Kpathsea library and nothing
else, libraries are only built as required by program packages.  But one
could build just one program that uses kpathsea (preferably a small one,
e.g., gsftopk).  One could then run 'make DESTDIR=<somewhere> install' in
the texk/kpathsea/ subdirectory (or at the top level and discard the
program).

It is important to specify the correct value for --prefix.  As of TL15 there
is the system dependent $libdir/kpathsea/c-auto.h in addition to the system
independent $includedir/kpathsea/*.h and $libdir/pkgconfig/kpathsea.pc
should be used to obtain the flags for using the library so this file must
contain the correct paths.

This required knowledge of the ultimate install paths is one reason why it
is not feasible to have the libraries as part of a generic TL distribution.

Peter

Dear All,

I'm writing you because I'm thinking about releasing a future version of
Gregorio on CTAN and, I hope, on TeXLive. GregorioTeX is just a few TeX
files, no problem, but it calls a small program called "gregorio", which
you can see the sources of here:

https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/tree/develop

It's in C, it parses standard input or a file, and generates TeX on a
file, or stdout. It can also generate the same format as the input or
another text format. It can't call another program, can't execute
arbitrary commands, and doesn't require any external library or script
language, uses gnu c99 with fortify flags. If it ever gets into TeXLive,
would it be considered "secure" enough to be in the
shell_escape_commands? If not, what else would be needed? I'm asking now
in case there are additional developments to do before proposing inclusion.

Thank you,

Hi Elie,

    It's in C, it parses standard input or a file, 

I can't look in detail right now, sorry, but here's what comes to mind:
if reading from a file, it should use kpse_in_name_ok[_silent] to ensure
it's allowed to read from it, and if writing to a file,
kpse_out_name_ok[_silent].  There are equivalent options in kpsewhich.
I imagine you might not want to link with kpathsea; perhaps a wrapper
script is the answer.  Or maybe a mode where it can only use
stdin/stdout.  I'm not sure.

The source should not require gcc; other compilers are used.
(I doubt this will be hard.)

Not a stopper, but the name "gregorio" makes me think of our friend
Enrico, rather than anything about chant, let alone chant+tex ...

Best,
Karl

ANd on another side, great. Gregorio was removed from Debian/stable
due to being unmaintained, outdated, broken (old version, RC bugs).
A new version would be great, especially if it would be part of TL.

Obviously this has to do with the origin of our mother tongue. I, with 
Spanish as my native language, immediately associate gregorio with san 
Gregorio, Gregorio Magno, cantos gregorianos...

I see two options here:
 - a compilation option to link with kpse, that would be only used in
TeXLive build (it seems too complex to ask users downloading gregorio on
github to compile kpse library first)
- a wrapper script, gregorio-safe

A few questions:
- would the first solution be acceptable? This would mean that users
installing gregorio from github on top of the TeXLive installation would
have an "unsafe" gregorio in shell_escape_commands

- where can I find the documentation of kpse_in_name_ok?

- Norbert: under Debian, pkg-config --cflags --libs kpse doesn't find
kpse, what is the easiest way to make some tests? should I checkout a
part of svn repository, build kpse and link against it?

- if a script solution is taken, what would be the most appropriate
language? Perl seems a good option as it's shipped with TeXLive, but
would it be safe enough to be in the shell_escape_commands? One of the
constraints here is that it would be good if gregorio users building
from github would be able to build this script too, so C with kpse
bindings would have the same problem as the kpse binding with the main
executable... Or maybe the wrapper script could be only in TeXLive, and
users installing gregorio on top of TeXLive would still call
gregorio-safe, but it would itself call the new gregorio... What do you
think?

We tried stdin/stdout only, but it would require lua to plug on both
stdin and stdout, which is a bit complex...

Shouldn't be a problem... It compiles in a mingw32 environment, and we
made everything with clang compatibility in mind. What other compilers
should I try?

As Axel noted, it depends a lot on the context... Gregorio is almost 9
years old now, it seems difficult to rename it...

Subject: [tex-live] tl15 status
Message-ID: <201505152335.t4FNZnDd024932@freefriends.org>

I've taken all the updates that made it to CTAN today (for some
definition of "today"), as usual.  I also updated context from the
"current" release that Hans prepared.

This was the end of regular updates for TL15.

Further uploads to CTAN will not be propagated to TL until regular
updates resume, after the release, sometime next month, I expect.  My
best guess at dates remains at http://tug.org/texlive.

I will consider package updates for the next few days on a case-by-case
basis, if and only if (a) the update is available on CTAN, and (b) you
can convince me that the update is fixing a critical bug and not
introducing more :).

This is so we can have a stable set of binaries and packages for people
to work with for the next few days, so that, hopefully, we'll release
something whose parts work together.

The only pending exception for packages is pgf: I have been talking with
ChristianF and we will jointly decide whether to update it after he
finishes preparing the release, which should be within a day or so.

The only other pending work I know of is two translations of the
tlguide.  I expect both of those to be done by Wednesday, and hence,
hope to build the final TL'15 image Wed or Thu night.

FYI, I will be completely offline Sun-Tue, inclusive, but will catch up
with everything when I get back before deciding when to go ahead.  So
don't worry if questions arise and seem to be left hanging for a bit.

Good luck to us all,
Karl

Message-ID: <CAO7dr0grfOggZy8JLehTSho3hweuSoVngYgmrqrJ+0yQ9y-HNw@mail.gmail.com>

The attached minimal example compiles for me on a system with a TeX
Live pretest of a week and a half ago, but fails on a system with a
pretest from today. It's definitely possible that there is some other
difference between the systems (e.g. missing font), so I would like to
check in here and see if others can reproduce the difference in
behavior.

Attached is the MWE that I compile with the command xelatex. Also
attached are the "good" log (from the pretest of a week and a half
ago) and the "bad" log.

Note also that in the good.log file, there are many warnings. So
perhaps the mwe.tex is supposed to fail to compile and it was a bug
(or lack of feature) that it did not fail to compile before?

Best,

Maybe I have something that falls in this category: The map file of the
newly installed font package 'SourceSerifPro' isn't yet activated.

There was an update of ctex the last days, so my guess is that
it is due to this.

Can you check whether installing an old version of ctex (do you have
backups as made by tlmgr, tlmgr restore ...) fixes the problem,
and if yes, maybe report again here *and* directly to the ctex authors?

Thanks a lot

Why are you setting the font encoding to T1? This is certainly wrong
(and the source of the errors).

Hello Scott,

I'm afraid that your original MWE is wrong.
The 'nofonts' option means that we do not use the default Chinese font
setting and will manually specify the fonts later.
It is a coincidence that the MWE works in old version of ctex package,
because recent versions of xeCJK package loads Fandol fonts when no fonts
are specified. We disabled this feature in ctex version 2.0.

You can remove the 'nofonts' option and then this simpler MWE should work
(on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux):

\documentclass[UTF8]{ctexart}
\begin{document}
???????
\end{document}

Anyway, I think the error message should be improved.

BTW, it doesn't matter to use \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}, if you know what
you are doing.

Best,
Leo

     - a compilation option to link with kpse, that would be only used in
    TeXLive build

Sounds good.

    (it seems too complex to ask users downloading gregorio on
    github to compile kpse library first)

Agreed.

    installing gregorio from github on top of the TeXLive installation would
    have an "unsafe" gregorio in shell_escape_commands

If users choose to do that, that's up to them.

Of course, I hope you won't *recommend* doing that, since it would
defeat the whole purpose.  How often will this C program change?

    - if a script solution is taken, 

Skipping all this unless we do end up taking this course.
It seems simpler to just make the C program do the right thing
in the first place.

    - where can I find the documentation of kpse_in_name_ok?

I briefly mention it in the kpathsea[.texi] manual, but more useful is
probably: grep name_ok kpathsea/*

    Gregorio is almost 9 years old now, it seems difficult to rename it...

I didn't realize it had such a long history.  I thought it was something
completely new.  In that case, agreed that it's better to keep the name.

Good, I've already implemented something in the last commits of

https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/commits/kpse

but I admit the diffs might not be easily readable... It seems to be
working well though.

Of course.

The only thing I don't have control on is TeXLive and MacTeX (nor MikTeX
of course) not providing kpathsea library, so people under Mac won't be
able to build gregorio with kpse... Under most Linux distro it's
relatively easy though. But I also don't know how to provide a .exe
linked with kpse... I don't think I can right? I think it's feasible not
to distribute anything under Windows except through the TeXLive
channel... But it's easy to build gregorio under Mac, so I can't prevent
people from not linking...

> How often will this C program change?

That's a good question, but what I was thinking was to take only very
stable versions into TeXLive... so maybe once every 6 month?

We would compile your program as part of the normal TL build, for all
platforms, and install it that way.  Thus, the binary would get updated
once a year.  It would be statically linked with the kpse we have at the
time, so our not distributing a separate kpse lib does not matter.

People who want to compile it on their own in between times would need
to either get enough of the TL infrastructure to build it, or figure it
out on their own.  We don't need to prevent anything.  We just need to
do the right thing with what we distribute.

Dear all,

Thank you everyone for your advice and corrections. As for if I know
what I'm doing, I certainly do not (perhaps I should have made that
more clear in my first email). I run tests of all of LyX's
documentation (we now have more than 4000 such tests). If a document
suddenly stops compiling, I investigate why. This list has been very
friendly and helpful in either fixing regressions or pointing out that
the documents are flawed to begin with. I really appreciate that.

Removing the "nofonts" class option leads to a successful compilation
of the MWE as well as the main document from which I derived the MWE.
I will also remove the use of the fontenc package for this document.

Thank you Norbert, Ulrike, Herbert, and Leo!

Scott

I guess "texlive2014-20140525.iso" and "texlive2014.iso" links point to
the same file. So, what about an extra link "texlive.iso" that
permanently points to the current texlive ISO file?

I installed pretest in windows and omitted the registry changes. Now the
2014 binaries are still active. Is there any way to change in between the
two installations.

You have obviously eliminated in the manager the symbolic link functions.
Now I wonder.

Choice of TeX system is determined by the path set. On Windows, this can
be adjusted using the Control Panel (search for 'environmental
variables'). I'd just add the appropriate location at the start of your
personal path.

Note that on windows the user path is appended to the system path.
So if the previous TL is on the system path then you need to change
the system path.

If you did accept the menu shortcuts, then anything started via
those shortcuts should see the right searchpath.

At my workplace, once something is in the system path nothing short of a
direct request from the Queen can get it changed.  It would be nice to have
a mechanism like macports where the path says the same and versions can
be switched by adjusting links (junctions?).

But it could only have got into the system path by Royal Assent in the
first place, surely ?  (One assumes that putting something in the system
path is no less difficult than changing something that is already
there).  Therefore if the Royal Assent has been granted once,
Her Gracious Majesty must surely be willing to accommodate subsequent
amendments thereto.

Most Windows users know how to change the path; very very few know about
links, junctions and so on.  So I for one would far prefer to leave it
as it is.

Then change the user PATH variable. Or change the PATH variable
temporarly in a command line. Both also works in systems without
admin rights. 
In my editor (winedt) I can change the environment variable locally
through a macro and so switch between miktex, texlive 2013, 2014 and
now 2015 with two keystrokes. I can even run the systems in parallel
in cmd windows and compare their output. I doubt that this would be
so easy if links/junctions were involved.

By default, the effective searchpath consists of the system path
with the user path appended. A TeX on the system path will be found
before a TeX in the user path. So, without admin permissions it may
not be possible to fix the global searchpath.

But the programs in the TL menu are called via wrappers which
prepend the corresponding version of TL to the searchpath.  The
command prompt in the TL menu also has the TL binary path prepended.
So you are ok as long as you run TL via the menu entries. And
different editions of TL each have their own menu.

Plus, as Ulrike writes, you may be able to fix things from within
your editor.

Well thinking about it I see some justification - a user path that
hides system folders could do some harm. It was only surprising as
I'm so used that user settings wins ;-)

Hi,
I installed texlive on windows 8 machine and trying to compile an example
latex file to check whether the installation has gone OK. I get the
following error while compiling the .tex file in texstudio editor.

Error: Could not start the command: pdflatex.exe -synctex=1
-interaction=nonstopmode "samplefile".tex



Make sure that you have installed a (La)TeX distribution e.g. MiKTeX or TeX
Live, and have set the correct paths to this distribution on the command
configuration page.
A (La)TeX editor like TeXstudio cannot work without the (La)TeX commands
provided by such a distribution.


I made sure i added the following path to .exe files in the PATH
environmental variable


C:\texlive\2014\bin\win32


Not sure if any other settings need to be provided to get it working.
Previously i got it to work on windows 7 machine without any additional
settings. Any ideas/suggestions would be appreciated.

Best regards,

Arun

What do you get when you type

path

in a command-prompt?

By default, the installer takes care of the searchpath.

Did you reboot after installation?

After reboot, was does

TeX Live installation and no legacy target directory c:\texlive.
There's no on-access virus scanner installed here, only ClamWin
on-demand scanner.)

1. Log-on as user with administrator privileges.

2. Open a command prompt with elevated privileges (e.g., type 'cmd' in
quick search and hit Control + Shift + Enter).

3. cd path\to\local\rsync\mirror

4. Run install-tl-advanced.bat

5. Click 'Continue' button in anti virus advice window.

6. In TL setup windows change first entry from 'scheme-full' to
'scheme-minimal'.  (I observe the same problem with a custom collection,
too.  I've tried several times.)  Don't change any other settings.
Note, 'install for all users' is set to 'yes'.

7. Hit 'Install TeX Live' button.

8. After installation close TL GUI.

9. Open new command window.

10. Type 'tex story' and hit Enter.  At the TeX prompt type '\bye' and
hit Enter.  The file compiles fine, DVI output is generated.

11. Log-off administrator user.

12. Log-on as normal user.

13. Open command window.

14. Type 'tex story' and hit Enter.  Bummer!

Installation log is attached.  There's no TeX log file created when
trying to compile file story.tex.

Anybody else observing the problem?

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

Have you tried to delete all generated files between steps 10 an 11?
Maybe they are owned by an administrator and ordinary users are not
allowed to overwrite them.

New command windows are opened in %USERPROFILE%, by default.  So, the
normal user should have no chance messing with files generated in the
administrator account.  BTW, story.tex is a file distributed by TL:

I do observe the problem with private TeX (and LaTeX) files, too.

	Hello Petr,

  Thanks for pointing out that discussion on TeX StackExchange.  The
problem you report, about xdvipdfmx crashing, has been fixed by Akira
(almost at the same time you started this thread, actually).  You should
now be able to reproduce the behaviour reported on StackExchange with
the XeTeX binary from 2015 pretest.  That bug is not yet fixed,
unfortunately.

	Best,

		Arthur

The problem is not files generated during the test, but reading the
format fails.  When copying C:\texlive\2015\texmf-var\web2c\tex\tex.fmt
to the current directory, compilation of story.tex succeeds even as a
user.  Copying the format as a user triggers a UAC dialog, though, i.e.,
user has not enough permission to read that file.

IMHO, the bug was fixed only partially. Suppose the following example:

   \font\f="Nimbus Roman No9 L"
   \nopagenumbers
   \vbox{\hbox{\f ABC}\hrule}
   \end

The result looks like:

    A  B  C
    ----

It means that XeTeX itself uses right metric and calculates the width of 
the \hbox equal to the width of the rule below it. But the xdvipdfmx uses 
bad metric and puts the spaces between letters.

Indeed. I wonder what would be the best solution at this moment:
changing the binaries to generate world-readable format files, or
incorporating an icacls command in the installer and in tlmgr.

As an immediate remedy, a command

icacls c:\texlive\2015\texmf-var /grant:r Everyone:r /t

should do the trick - assuming c:\texlive\2015 is the root of the
installation.

That seems to work for the moment.

But only if I change user name 'Everyone' to 'Jeder' (German
translation).  Otherwise your original command returnes an error

> Everyone: Zuordnungen von Kontennamen und Sicherheitskennungen wurden nicht durc

meaning 'Everyone: Could not map accounts and SIDs.'  Looks like the
all-users name needs one more level of abstraction.

After applying the icacls command from a command windows with
administrator privileges I was able to compile story.tex as a user.

Non-localized:

icacls c:\texlive\2015\texmf-var /grant *S-1-1-0:r /t

S-1-1-0 is the `well-known SID' for `Everyone'.

/grant adds to existing permissions, /grant:r sets explicit
permissions, so /grant seems best.

After running 'fmtutil-sys --all' from a command window with
administrator privileges I've got the same permission problem.
Re-running icacls solved the problem again.  But it looks like running
icacls from the installer and tlmgr wouldn't be enough.

Now I begin to understand why so many people claim that Windows is

Is this a new feature of the new fmtutil-sys?
I hear for the first time about ACL problem.

Message-ID: <CAJyx360j1bQiyq+fW5y5vTMOcerFV5+GgFZf6+5W4EvDbGk1Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I would like to request inclusion of these fonts to TeX Live (only
*.mf files are needed):

    CTAN: tex-archive/fonts/cyrillic/scyrillic

I negotiated this with the author and he agreed to cooperate.

Now it is necessary to find out what criteria a font package must
fulfill to be eligible for inclusion in TeX Live. Later I would like
to see them packaged with Debian also.

Please answer the following questions:

1) Is it sufficient to put only LICENSE file to the archive? Will the
following be sufficient for the LICENSE file?

--------------------
All the files in this bundle are distributed under the terms of
the Acacedimc Free License (AFL); either version 3.0 of the license,
or (at your option) any later version.

---------------------

2) How to make license information appear on this page?
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/scyrillic?lang=en

3) How to make this package included in TeX Live?

Best wishes,
Igor.

Stephan - after the failed installation, can you try to see, at the

  c:/texlive/2015/texmf-var/web2c/tex

  c:/texlive/2015/texmf-var/web2c/tex/tex.fmt
(or both)

which has the restrictive permissions?  The answer probably points to
different culprits and different fixes.

Hi Stephen,

can you please use copy the attached 
	fmtutil.pl
to 
	texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/fmtutil.pl
and see whether after another run of
	fmtutil-sys --all
you can still not read the format files, or whether a normal user
is now allowed to read them?

Thanks

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] Request for scyrillic fonts.
In-Reply-To: <CAJyx360j1bQiyq+fW5y5vTMOcerFV5+GgFZf6+5W4EvDbGk1Hg@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <201505231736.t4NHasMi021444@freefriends.org>

Hi Igor,

    I would like to request inclusion of these fonts to TeX Live
    CTAN: tex-archive/fonts/cyrillic/scyrillic

At least some are already there, in the package cmcyr.  Just with
different filenames?  (Gosh, it was a lot of years ago that I did those
renames.)  I only compared cmrz10.mf vs. cmcyr10.mf, but they were
identical.

But in case you want to proceed anyway, I'll answer the other questions.

    1) Is it sufficient to put only LICENSE file to the archive? 

It's not optimal, but yes, it's sufficient.
(Optimal would be to put a statement in each file.)

    Will the following be sufficient for the LICENSE file?

It's technically ok, except for your typo of "Acacedimc" instead of
"Academic".  The text of the license should also be included.

But using the Academic Free License is not especially desirable, since
it is incompatible with everything else.  Unless Alex has strong
feelings about it, I would suggest stating the fonts are public domain,
just like the cm originals and the cmcyr set.

For instance, this statement could be added to the README:
  This entire scyrillic font package is released to the public domain.

That is enough.  (The fontname reference in the README, and my old email
address, should also be updated or removed.)

    2) How to make license information appear on this page?
    https://www.ctan.org/pkg/scyrillic?lang=en

The CTAN folks will take care of this when the new version of scyrillic
uploaded (http://ctan.org/upload).

    3) How to make this package included in TeX Live?

Besides the license, the other issue is file names.  There can't be any
duplicates, and I see a half-dozen or so existing in cmcyr:
  cyrillic.mf cyrl.mf cyrsymb.mf cyru.mf cytextit.mf cytitle.mf

A few input statements elsewhere in the mf files would need to be changed.
If you want to go ahead, I would recommend renaming all the cy* files as
cmcys* (not just those duplicates), for consistency and clarity.  

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <201505232149.t4NLnQjB017131@freefriends.org>

What I hope will be the final build of TL'15 is now in the pretest
area.  mactex*pkg will be correspondingly updated by tomorrow.

Now there is the customary pause while the full TeX Collection DVD is
prepared.  When that is complete -- hopefully a couple of weeks at worst
-- and the image is finalized for manufacturing, we'll make the public
release of TL and MacTeX.

Of course, bug reports are still welcome, but only truly horrible
breakage will be cause for rebuilding.  Anything else can wait for when
regular updates resume.

Thanks to all,
Karl

It's the file.  I have only a restricted understanding of file
permissions, but here's what I get out of explorer:

Directory c:\texlive\2015\texmf-var\web2c\tex has the following
permissions set for group 'Benutzer' (Users):

  Read, Execute             +
  List directory contents   +
  Read                      +

Those permissions look quite ok to me and the group name sounds very
familiar.

After installation format c:\texlive\2015\texmf-var\web2c\tex\tex.fmt
has no such permissions for group 'Users'.  I think this is the culprit.

After running icacls the following permissions are set on the file for
group 'Jeder' (Everyone).

  Read                      +

But those permissions are lost as soon as 'fmtutil-sys --all' is run.

I tend to think permissions for group 'Users' instead of 'Everyone'
should be preserved on format files.

Screenshots attached.

Best regards,
Stephan Hennig

I can confirm that with that fmtutil.pl permissions for group 'Users'
are preserved on format files.  And I can compile story.tex as a normal
user.  Thanks!

Thanks for testing. We had another successful test report besides your
and my own tests, so ta slightly changed variant of that file
(where temporary directories are removed) is included in the final
release Kalr built today.

Thanks for point us out this bug, and helping debug it!

Then your editor is probably not set up properly, otherwise it should
work.

I guess if you open a cmd shell and type pdflatex it will start running.

Hi Norbert,
I guess pdflatex is not recognised when i type in the cmd.

*'pdflatex' is not recognized as an internal or external command,*
*operable program or batch file.*

Not sure if the installation went right. Executed the batch file
(highlighted in the attached snapshot ) during installation.
Best regards,
Arun

Do you have a directory c:\texlive\2014\bin\win32 and does it have
pdflatex.exe in it?

Also, there should be a log file c:\texlive\2014\install-tl.log with
more information.

Hi,

The version of ConTeXt in TeX Live 2015 is a bit weird, the
bibliography seems broken:

...al/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/context/base/publ-ini.lua:498:
attempt to index field '?' (a nil value)
stack traceback:
    ...al/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/context/base/publ-ini.lua:498:

    (...tail calls...)

This is weird because I didn't have that particular problem neither
before nor after the last TL update in the standalone ConTeXt
distribution, but maybe just the version that got included was broken
(and then quickly fixed by Hans in the next version before anyone else
noticed).

Given that TeX Live is now frozen it's probably not important enough
to hold off the release because of this, but in case that you plan any
other important changes before the release, please let me know. We
should then fix the problem as soon as the updates are enabled again.

At present there's nothing to force a rebuild, but it might happen.
I have no way of knowing, it's essentially up to Manfred and Klaus.

In any case, whatever happens for the release, it would be nice to have
it fixed in the first batch of updates, as you say.  Release a new
current with just that bug fix and I'll grab it then, if it doesn't
happen before?

I was trying out an example for cyrillic and during this mktexmf.exe
crashed. I could reproduce it with TL 14 and TL 15 (pretest).

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[russian]{babel}

\begin{document}
\Huge %must be a "new" size
????? ?? ??????? ?????

When running this mktextfm is called which then calls mktexmf:

kpathsea: Running mktextfm larm2488

The command name is D:\texlive\2015\bin\win32\mktextfm

kpathsea: Running mktexmf larm2488.mf

The command name is D:\texlive\2015\bin\win32\mktexmf
name = larm2488, rootname = larm, pointsize = 2488
mktexmf:

8.mf: successfully generated.

and then the windows dialog "mktexmf.exe funktioniert nicht mehr"
appears. 

Despite the crash the tfm is created successfully and the next
compilation runs smoothly (so every test has to use either a "new"
size, or one has to delete the tfm first).

Thanks for the report. Please try an attached patch t2aenc.def.diff
for $TEXMFDIST/tex/latex/cyrillic/t2aenc.def.
I'm using the patched t2aenc.def personally for a reason which I forgot.
With the t2aenc.def, I don't encounter the crash here (see below).

Thanks,

OK, that must be irrelevant.
I understand the inconvenience.  If I can find something, I'll fix in the
update phase of TeX Live 2015.

No the diff doesn't help here (I'm on window 7, 64 bit, I will try
on window 8.1. soon).

(It would have confused me very much if he had helped. 
 The diff only replaces 
  \DeclareFontSubstitution{\LastDeclaredEncoding}{cmr}{m}{n}
by 
  \DeclareFontSubstitution{T2A}{cmr}{m}{n}
and I can't imagine why this should change the mktextfm calls).

By looking a bit closer at the messages during the mktextmf call I
found the source of the problem: 

After the message

C:/Users/*****/.texlive2015/texmf-var/fonts/source/lh/lh-t2a/larm2074.mf:

kpsewhich complained 

    Cannot find larm2074.mf.

The reason is that my TEXMF was to long. I have a lot of texmf trees
for various projects and seem to have overstressed kpsewhich. After
removing some of the trees the compilation worked again.

(I don't know if the length of the string is the problem, or the
number of trees that kpsewhich had to search (and so run into some
time problem)).

I will have to improve my scripts so that I can remove unneeded
trees when switching to another project ;-)

Thanks a lot. My mktex* tools are very old and I found that
I limited the number of trees to be 16.
In the update phase of TeX Live 2015, I'll fix the problem
by increasing MAXTREES.

Thanks,
Akira

Probably not kpathsea, but the allowed length of the cmdline or so.

Just a wild guess, though

Hello,

Since I use updated TL2015-prtest, this example don't give any 
bibliographic references when I use htlatex, biblatex with biber backend 
; it's OK only when I use bibtex backend.

Always with tl2015, it's OK with pdflatex and biblatex/biber.

It's also OK with texlive-2014 for htlatex and pdflatex and biblatex 
with biber or bibtex.
I think
Here is the example :

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\RequirePackage{ifpdf}
\RequirePackage[francais]{babel}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}
\RequirePackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\ifpdf
\RequirePackage{hyperref}

\RequirePackage[tex4ht]{hyperref}
   \makeatletter

I compiled TL 2015 from source. After installing this I noted that
fmtutil was switched from fmtutil.sh to a perl version. This ftmutil.pl
requires mktexlsr.pl to be present, but that one is not even part of the
texlive-20150521-source.

Only the /bin/sh mktexlsr gets intalled as part of kpathsea.

What do I need to install to get a copy of mktexlsr.pl?

Hi Akira - I'm surprised to read this.  In the original kpathsea, there
is no built-in concept of "texmf tree", let alone a limited number of
them.  That is, the TEXMF variable is not special.  It is all just
strings being expanded.  I guess you must have need to make some rather
radical changes!

Best,
Karl

Irrelevant. Nobody ever said that the texlive-20150521-source is
enough to get a running/working system.

You need the Master/texmf-dist tree, also in svn.

There you find
	Master/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/mktexlsr.pl

I repeat: Taking the source.tar.gz, compiling, and using the inst
directory will *NOT* give you a working TeX system.
The source tar is only used for building the binaries *to*be*dropped*
into Master/bin/<ARCH>/

Hello everybody,

I have created a rewrite of pdfbook in python which supports the --letter
option and crops the pages automatically. It is already on ctan (
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pdfbook2) and I would like to
know, what has do be done for it to be included in texlive? It obviously
needs python but that should be present on most linux machines.

I gave it a new name as it has different requirements and, more
importantly, different behaviour than pdfbook. Most prominently it does not
(currently) support  the --shortedge and --signature options.

Greetings,
Johannes

I don't see a problem with including it in TeX Live.  Updates are just
frozen right now while we prepare the yearly DVD.  I hope I'll be able to
resume them in not too long.

Thanks,
Karl
