Hi Elie,

    Is there a way to test the integration into
    TeXLive, especially the compilation?

I think the best way would be to make a release-style tarball (doesn't
matter what the version number is) and tell me and Peter the url.
Or upload it to CTAN.

Trying to work from your development tree at
https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/tree/develop
would be harder.

    the compilation process, etc.

Hopefully "configure && make" does it, right?

FWIW, Peter and I wrote about the TL build process in some detail in
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html (or texdoc tlbuild if you prefer
pdf).

Best,
Karl

You can find gregorio-4.0.0-beta.tar.bz2 at the bottom of

https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta

so complete url :

https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases/download/v4.0.0-beta/gregorio-4.0.0-beta.tar.bz2

Indeed, there is a font generation process requiring python, fontforge,
etc. but the release tarball contains the compiled fonts, so no need for
that.

> Hopefully "configure && make" does it, right?

configure --with-kpse && make, indeed, maybe the path to the kpse
library should be passed in an env variable...

Hi,

on MacOsX (10.8.5) with MacTeX 2015.

xindy 37078 works perfectly but when I update xindy with tlmgr to obtain 
37716, I get error. The file animal.idx contenaing this line

\indexentry{chat!sauvage}{1}

fails when I do

texindy -L english   -C -utf8 animal.idx

I obtain Cannot locate xindy module for language english in codepage -utf8

I I restore xindy 37078, all work again.

Any idea ? Many users said me that they have no problem with 37716, but 
for my case...

That's probably caused by the change that should support spaces in
paths on Windows.

Does your MacTeX installation base directory have spaces in its name?

I am not sur to understand what do you mean by "installation base

all my file of texlive are installed in /usr/local/texlive/2015/

the name of my boot disk is "Princeps Inter Pares". But as the path is 
from /...

however, I have tested that:
- changing name by deleting space "princepsinterpares"
- updating xindy 37716
- trying

Your command is incorrect.
The correct one is

texindy -L english   -C  utf8  animal.idx

I obtain the same error as yours if I execute the incorrect

texindy -L english   -C  -utf8  animal.idx

Hi,

It is strange since other people don't complain
about the change made in 37716.
Try an attached patch xindy.pl.diff.
This will recover the old behavior, but spaces
are not allowed for the full path of modules dir
except on windows.

Best,

Subject: [tex-live] Issue installing Tex Live on Windows 10
Message-ID: <CAMzFSnmzWyOs9U7=-KkVDuDQ1QJpgi8a+ek5mKVei7_w+aqKeg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I tried to install Tex Live on a clean installation of Windows 10 home
64bit (so the system is clean and recently wiped and reinstalled) but i
have some issues.

When I start the installation process via network the CMD (anche
installation itself) shut down at the very beginning.
Right after the running of the installer or the batch file a popup show up
with an alert message. "Error of the application. It is impossible to start
the application 0xc0000142"
The title of the pop up is "Perl.exe"

This problem happens everytime at the start of the installation with the
windows bat file and with the advanced bat file.

The exe installer simply unpack the file (the green writings in the
software windows) but after that i can only click the close button and
nothing happen.
I imagine that after that normally should autoexecute the installation
process.

With the Tex LIve image (iso) the problem is the same that with the archive
with the batch file.

The issue happens with administration privilege too.

The issue happens with execution of batch file directly via prompt and with
code string of -no-gui or -gui text too.

I try install an external version of perl (strawberry) but the same happens.

If I overwrite the perl folder into the zip archive with the bin and lib
file from the strawberry installation then effectively the installation
start. Then the CMD stamp a very large list of problem about perl
(obviously is only a try).
I think the same issue is present if i copy the lib and bin folder from the
live cd, because perl.exe crash too in the live cd, so is pointless the
trying.

The system is "new", I wiped and reinstalled for two times two days ago.
Everything went fine, all the programs just work fine and the only issue is
with Tex Live.

I need this partucular suite for University.

I attach a link from the discussion on StackExchange Tex's Board:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/258364/issue-installing-tex-live-on-windows-10

Kind regards,

Andrea Eugenio

P.S. Sorry for the very bad english

This is the answer I posted on tex.stackexchange:

I just tested with a brand-new wx pro 64-bits and an advanced user
installand had no problems. To be exact: I downloaded the exe,
selected the unpack option and after it finished unpacking I
double-clicked install-tl-advanced.bat, but clicking the advanced
button also started up the main installer interface.

I searched for this "0xc0000142" error. Unfortunately it seems a
pretty intractable beast.

As a workaround, you can do a portable install on a usb stick from
another computer.

Find xindy.pl (should be somewhere in the scripts folder) 

Open it in an editor, open also the diff-file. Find in xindy.pl the
lines marked with - in the diff of Akira, and replace them with the
line marked with +.

(There are tools to apply a diff automatically, but such a small
change can also be done simply with copy and paste.)

Then save the changed file !  (May seem obvious, but sometimes the
obvious escapes our notice).  And best to copy the original "xindy.pl"
to a safe location from which it can be restored if all goes belly-up.

And when copying the lines remove the + sign at the beginning of the lines.
The file contains the line number in the original file, line number in the
changed file, a few common lines, the changed lines and a few more common
lines. If your text editor offers line numbering, it will not be difficult
to find the places that require changes.

If you do a net search for

"0xc0000142"

you'll find a lot of relevant links. One is:

http://deshack.net/windows-how-to-solve-application-error-0xc0000142-and-0xc0000005/

According to them, the problem is likely caused by a bad DLL on the system,
or that Perl.exe is referring to a DLL that is no longer in "good standing."

Which dll? As fas as I can see, the only possible TeX Live related
suspects would be the perl- and bundled mingw dlls.  But the problem
is not universal: I, for one, could not reproduce it.  And if it is
an external dll I would not know where to start looking.

Maybe some security setting? Here I would not know either where to
start looking.

Searching the web for 0xc0000142 reveals a lot of articles with
info on how to solve it. I can't help you directly with MS Windows
(at least with regard to trying something on my own system) because
I switched to Linux more than a decade ago and never looked back.

Well, I use Linux too, but I keep some real and virtual Windows
installations around because I have to deal with Windows users and
with Windows problems. But it is difficult to research a problem
that you cannot reproduce.

Yes, there were a lot of links, but none of the ones I checked, not
excepting the one you cited, jumped out as particularly useful or
promising. Also, I am not going to suggest a procedure to an
arbitrary user which involves renaming dlls or hand-editing registry
entries.

One issue is still open with the version 4.4.0 (svn rev. 38013): The
package now supports also LaTeX/dvips and comes with a
`fontawesome.map'.  The map file gets installed but does not get
enabled.  I think `fontawesome.tlpobj' lacks the following line:

    execute addMap fontawesome.map

Best, Arash

I fear that the error message "0xc0000142" isn't very helpful at all.
What does it mean?  Is it documented somewhere?  The link provided by
Michael is absolutely useless because nothing is explained.
The guy found a solution for *his* problem by trial-and-error.  Maybe
"0xc0000142" means that the operating system is currently in the
toilet.  It's known that Windows spends most of the time there.

DLLs are a pain on Windows because they are searched in PATH but their
filenames don't contain the version number.  Let me give an Example.

I installed GNU Octave on Windows many years ago.  It came with a file
called cygwin.dll.  Later I installed Cygwin but it always crashed,
simply because the ancient cygwin.dll was found earlier in PATH.

If you have Unix tools (MinGW, Cygwin) installed, you can easily find
out which DLLs are used by a particular .exe file:

  strings foo.exe | grep -i "\.dll"

It's not 100% reliable but works in most cases.

Writing a script which finds out which DLL is found first in PATH
isn't a big deal, but I have no idea how to determine its version
number.  And I fear that everything gets even more complicated if the
registry is involved.

I have no idea how to debug this issue.

Good night,
  Reinhard

I found a thread on the Microsoft community site:

http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/cmdexe-error-0xc0000142/21efc574-3279-441b-b3fd-005e46914564?auth=1

The last post was this:

"Sorry but i have to be honest and say this is the most useless thread
 ever created.
 
 every person with the error on here is like:

 "when i try and run cmd.exe i get the error that the application was
  unable to start correctly...blah blah blah"

  and EVERY single response is:

  "well to fix it first open an elevated command prompt....blah blah blah"


LOL! So, I guess that's representative of help on the issue at hand.
And bear this in mind with any additional URLs I mention below.

> I fear that the error message "0xc0000142" isn't very helpful at all.
> What does it mean?  Is it documented somewhere?

At this point, I believe it means that there was an error loading a
DLL - either because it is damaged or because it is unsigned (and not
because it is merely missing).

Now let us ponder that this is Windows 10 with so many bells and whistles,
30+ years of evolution - and it does not even tell us which DLL is the
culprit.

Anyway, the error can be caused by a damaged file. So the filesystem should
be scanned for errors.

http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/cmdexe-error-0xc0000142/21efc574-3279-441b-b3fd-005e46914564?auth=1

Also, the registry can be edited to allow the loading of unsigned DLLs:

http://upandready.typepad.com/up_and_ready/2014/03/autocad-2015-application-error-0xc0000142-autoruns-for-windows-.html
https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd744762%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

which would allow one to exclude that cause. But, as Siep mentioned, this does
involve editing the registry and not everyone is up to that.

It would be nice if there were a utility that fixes just that, but everyone should
be wary because there is a lot of malware out there that masquerades as quick and
easy repair utilities.


  Cheers,

  Mike

Actually, this is worth a try. Since Andrea can open a command
prompt, other than the person in the referenced thread, he could
copy-and-paste an explicit registry command, which should be safer
than stumbling around in the regedit GUI. Here goes:

Type <windows key>-x to get the maintenance menu, or whatever it is
called, and choose Command Prompt (Admin). Check the current value
of the key concerned by copying and pasting the following command:

reg query "HKLM\software\microsoft\windows NT\currentversion\windows" /v LoadAppInit_DLLs

(On one line)

If the value was already 0 or 0x0 then there is no point in
continuing. Otherwise, copy-and-paste the following, also on one line:

reg add "HKLM\software\microsoft\windows NT\currentversion\windows" /v LoadAppInit_DLLs /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

By the way: the TL installer started on my w10 system whether the
value was 0 or 1.

The package is quite new on CTAN, so be patient.  The license looks
appropriate.  But there are currently only two persons involved in
TeX Live package management.  Volunteers are welcome.

I saw pdbf-toolkit, but as far as I could tell, it can't be installed in
TL in its present state because it is not self-locating.  That is, it
cannot find its config/jar files relative to the executable location.

If you want to pursue it, I suggest studying arara, a relatively recent
Java-based package where the author and I dealt with these issues.  It's
on CTAN and in TL now.

(Or, people can just get pdbf-toolkit from CTAN and install it
themselves.  Or maybe distros will package it.  Wouldn't surprise me.)

Best,
Karl

Akira, which File::Glob is required for the xindy update?

On my 32bit Ubuntu 12.04 I get the the following error with the new xindy update

~$> texindy -L danish -C utf8 master.idx

"bsd_glob" is not defined in %File::Glob::EXPORT_TAGS at /usr/lib/perl/5.14/File/Glob.pm line 45
	File::Glob::import('File::Glob', ':bsd_glob') called at /opt/texlive/current/bin/i386-linux/xindy line 356
	main::BEGIN() called at /opt/texlive/current/bin/i386-linux/xindy line 356
	eval {...} called at /opt/texlive/current/bin/i386-linux/xindy line 356

BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /opt/texlive/current/bin/i386-linux/xindy line 356.

If I take a look in /usr/lib/perl/5.14/File/Glob.pm I find

%EXPORT_TAGS = (
    'glob' => [ qw(
        GLOB_ABEND
	GLOB_ALPHASORT
        GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC
        GLOB_BRACE
        GLOB_CSH

        GLOB_ERROR
        GLOB_LIMIT
        GLOB_MARK

        GLOB_NOSORT

        GLOB_QUOTE
        GLOB_TILDE
        glob
        bsd_glob
    ) ],
);

On my system if I change line 356 in xindy to 

use File::Glob qw(:glob);

it works fine again.

Message-ID: <20150814133055.30afe53e@hogwart.bsdlocal.net>

Hi there,
I'd like to know about proper (case wise) spelling of Metafont resp
Metapost.

In CTAN catalogue files we have it all:  METAFONT, MetaFont and
Metafont. Likewise for Metapost. IIRC, in PDF documents it is usually
a METAFONT resp. METAPOST logo.

It is not about visibility on ctan.org as the CTAN portal transforms for
instance Metafont to the proper logo. But  for the joy of consistency I 
like to straighten this out in our files.

Question: In our text based files which spelling should we choose? 

Thanks all.

I personally prefer to use all uppercase variants. Texts written in TeX
usually contains the corresponding logo. Alternatively I would suggest
Metafont and Metapost, I do not see any reason for CamelCase here. But this
is just my personal preference.

Hi,

When I was the maintainer of ?MetaPost", I tried hard to convince people to write it just like in this sentence. Not uppercase, and definitely not using any kind of logo font. I guess ?Metapost? would be OK too, but ?MetaPost? clearly had JD Hobby?s preference. 

MetaPost is somewhat like a contraction of the words Metafont and PostScript, and since PostScript is camel cased itself, it feels natural to mimic with that. 

Best wishes,
Taco

Thanks for this. Personally, I like more what Zden?k said. But this is
not about what I like or dislike. 

So from what you say it is clearly MetaPost.

So it will be interesting to see what others say about Metafont. I
mostly see either Metafont or METAFONT (but only with special logo
font). 

https://www.tug.org/metapost.html uses Metafont. It seems that this is
the correct way in a plain text file.

Thanks Phil. Interesting document. 

On page 2 Ulrik has

<+package> [1999/03/10 v2.0 LaTeX package for Metafont and MetaPost
logos] 

which are the variants I want to use.

I tried the command suggested in output (tlmgr install mcf2graph), but
that didn't work; this was the output:

The .tar.xz works, since I can manually uncompress it, I tried messing
up with tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm, but nothing I could change worked.

Thanks in advance for your help, and sorry if this is a bug due to
something worng on my side.

I finally found a way to make it work: I substituted "$xzdec" with
"unxz" (my system unxz) inside tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm at the line
where it is invoked, thus I could repair my install and finish the
update.

I hope someone could explain this behaviour.

Message-ID: <E1A6B5AC-49DD-453F-877F-D504F3102C35@free.fr>

Hi

I encounter a new pb while compiling tex files including eps images to pdf with the newly installed Texlive distribution

I?m working with Mac OsX and I?m using Texmaker 4.4.1

When compiling I?m getting this message : 
sh : repstopdf : command not found

Unfortunately, I?m also working with OSX Beta 10.11 so I cannot figure out wether the pb could come from TexLive 2015 which I?ve recently installed or if it comes from the beta OS which could cause pbs with TexLive distribution.

Does anybody have a similar pb ?
Thx

Sounds like the TL bin directory is not in the PATH as seen within
Texmaker.

repstopdf is just a symlink to epstopdf.

Good luck,

Are the TeX Live programs executable? This line comes from
	chomp(my $TEXMFSYSVAR = `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFSYSVAR`);
My guess is that you have mounted some USB media or something else
*without* executable permissions.

This would explain why the above xzdec command also fails, since
it is taken from the portable media.

THe perl script is running since it uses the executable perl
from your normal system, and does perl *does* run.

I have tried to use a modified search path with the index processor "xindy" but it doesn't work. The following trivial 	procedure works:

touch document.idx
touch foo.xdy
xindy -v -C utf8 -L general -I latex -M foo.xdy document.idx

Then I move the xindy style file "foo.xdy" in a subdirectory

mkdir xxx
mv foo.xdy xxx/

and call

XINDY_SEARCHPATH='./xxx:' xindy -v -C utf8 -L general -I latex -M foo.xdy document.idx

(Note the colon at the end of the path.)

This call give the following error:

Error in line 1:
(require "lang/general/utf8-lang.xdy")
ERROR: PROBE-FILE: wildcards are not allowed here: #P"/home/niepra01/lisp/**/lang/general/utf8-lang.xdy"

The xindy manual says:

The searchpath can be set with the environment variable XINDY_SEARCHPATH which must contain a list of colon-separated directories. If it ends with a colon, the built-in searchpath is added to the entire searchpath. 

What goes wrong here?

I work with an up-to-date TeXLive installation on Linux. Thanks in advance.

Dear Rolf Niepraschk,

> the entire searchpath.

The manual seems to be wrong. In the present xindy, xindy.run or
xindy-lisp.exe understand XINDY_SEARCHPATH. However if this is
set, it must be complete. No subtree searching is done.
And it seems that the built-in search path is not added to it.
The built-in search path is used only if XINDY_SEARCHPATH is not defined.

Usually it may be sufficient with
XINDY_SEARCHPATH="./xxx:/your-texmf-dist/xindy/modules:/your-texmf-dist/xindy/modules/base"
since partial subtree searching is done in xindy.pl.

Hello,

it seems that behaviour of fmtutil(-sys) has changed. When I try to
regenerate pdflatex, it says:

$ fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence
order):
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf file for writing
changes:
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil: running `pdftex -ini  -jobname=pdflatex -progname=pdflatex
-translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdflatex.ini' ...

I have texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf where pdflatex is generated with the
-enc switch in order to activate encTeX but the messages show that it is
not used. I do not know when it ceased to work, in the last times I used
XeLaTeX only, so I have not mentioned. I only know that it worked fine in
the pretest.

Hello,

I have just come home. I see that the formats here were last generated on
July 31 at 21:45 CES (summer time, i.e. +2:00) and my local fmtutil.cnf was

Hi Norbert,

sorry for my confusing emails, I will try to summarize it.

1. During pretest I tried on two x86_64 computers with Fedora and on
Raspberry Pi and my local fmtutil.cnf was read and encTeX was activated.

2. On my home computer (x86_64 with Fedora) everything works fine but the
latest "tlmgr update" was run on July 31 in the evening.

3. Yesterday I found that in my office computer encTeX is not enabled (I
did not notice earlier because I do almost everything in XeLaTeX now). I
did the following:

a) verified that I have the right fmtutil.cnf saved as
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
b) ran mktexlsr
c) ran fmtutil-sys --all

Nothing changed, no support for encTeX, thus I tried to update by
tlmgr update -self --all
The result was the same.

I verified again that my local fmtutil.cnf is right and ran:
mktexlsr
fmtutil-sys --byfmt pdflatex

Here I immediatelly see that the line from my fmtutil.cnf is not used.

After coming home I checked that I really use TL 2015 on both computers. I
mounted /usr/local/texlive/2015 from my office computer via sshfs, compared
fmtutil.pl and diff showed that the file is identical in both computers.
Thus I do not understand what might have happened.

Howdy,

I don't know if this is important but in one email Zden?k also said
`
kpsewhich finds consistently only this one on both systems:

/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
'
which I find strange since on one system the custom build seems to work fine.

Good Luck,

Dear Zden?k,

fmtutil-sys is working as expected for me:

fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence order):
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf file for writing changes:
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf


Perhaps you need to update the kpathsea database by running  mktexlsr first.


Rod

Hi Karl, hi all

(please keep cc)

it seems that indeed the mflogo font was butchered, there are no
.mf nor .tfm files, which makes the .pfb/.map file a bit useless.

I guess we should reinstatiate them.

mktexlsr is executed as a part of "tlmgr update". In addition to it I did
it manually twice. Perhaps I will have to run fmtutil-sys via strace in
order to see what it really does.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive installation: Integrity Checks,
	Cryptographic Signatures?
Message-ID: <55D58E11.1050608@rub.de>

Hi,

since I am having trouble with the TeXLive version packaged for my OS
Distribution, I would like to install a recent 'vanilla' TeXLive version
from https://www.tug.org/texlive/.

I was surprised to realize that
https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html does not promote any
(easily accessible) way for doing integrity checks for the installer.
After some digging I figured out that one can download the sha256
checksums from https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet.
Is there any particular reason for
not making these checksums easily findable? If not, I would like to make
the suggestion of adding these checksums to the primary download page
for the TeXLive installers.

(Of course, checksums published on a webpage could potentially also be
forged, but without some kind of trust link this problem is difficult to
solve. Hence, spreading the checksums is at least something...)

My second question is about the tlmgr program. When I install packages
using tlmgr, does it do integrity checks, e.g. by comparing checksums or
by verifying cryptographic signatures? Maybe I have overlooked
something, but so far I couldn't find anything in the manual of tlmgr.

I have a bad feeling when executing code on my system without any way of
making sure that the code is in fact the code it is supposed to be. It
would be helpful if the manual would mention this.

Thank you very much,
Moritz Schulte

It downloads the tlpdb which contains package sizes and md5sums,

No cryptographic signatures.

Hi Zdenek,

there is an *easy* way to debug, you simply have to check
	kpsewhich -all fmtutil.cnf
and see if it returns *your* fmtutil.cnf in the list.

If not, something is fishy. In this case, please use normal kpathsea
debug means
	-d-1
or similar.

fmtutil-sys calls kpsewhich -all fmtutil.cnf *after* setting TEXMFVAR to
$TEXMFSYSVAR and TEXMFCONFIG to $TEXMFSYSCONFIG.

If you rdirect call and the one from fmtutil disagree, please edit
the perl script and add the necessary debug statements *there*
in the kpsewhich -all call.

Thanks

Norbert

Hi Norbert,

thank you for the valuable advice. It helped me to find out that for some
strange reason some of my ls-R files became owned by root and thus were out
of date. After setting the correct owner and rerunning mktexlsr everything
works.

On news://fr.comp.text.tex, Daniel Flipo (maintainer of babel-french) explains :

> L'erreur (d?j? signal?e sur la liste GUT) est due ? l'installation dans

Short version, in english : this bug is due to e-french defining a french.cfg, which is read by babel-french.

This bug is corrected in a new version of babel-french which should reach texlive in a day or two :  it turns out that reading french.cfg is no longer needed in babel-french and can be safely suppressed in this 3.1h version. The explanation in french :

> Depuis la version 3.0, frenchb ne charge plus le fichier frenchb.cfg.

Hi

I did have changed all the paths by /Library/TeX/texbin in Texmaker paths in the Settings window but it did not work.

BUT it finally worked by entering /Library/TeX/texbin in the field ? Add to path ? bottom right of the Texmaker settings window.

Thx

Under OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) beta you need to reconfigure Texmaker so that it finds the binaries at /Library/TeX/texbin rather than /usr/texbin since writing to /usr is no longer allowed. Please read the `El Capitan' section at <http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html> and also the linked document at the end of the section.

Message-ID: <CAEW6iOiGTxtg9812jTwwz8JmYsEpXm+SEAEkjRqQ+VsgFBKrxw@mail.gmail.com>

Karl,

With the luatex support built in to latex 2015 release lualatex.ini
was restructured but we missed dviluatex.ini which is still using the
old code,

Could it be updated to just be:


\begingroup
  \catcode`\{=1 %
  \catcode`\}=2 %
  \directlua{tex.enableprimitives('',tex.extraprimitives('pdftex'))}
  \global\everyjob{\directlua{require("lualatexquotejobname.lua")}}
\endgroup
\input pdftexconfig.tex
% dvi output by default
\pdfoutput=0
\input latex.ltx



to match lualatex.ini, thanks.

I've used
require("lualatexquotejobname.lua")
here rather than
dofile(assert(kpse.find_file("lualatexquotejobname.lua")))
as all supported versions of luatex now use kpse for require.
The same change could be made in lualatex.ini so that it is the same as above
apart from the \pdfoutput=0 line,

thanks

David

I suppose you mean dvilualatex.ini(*).  You're right about that.  Your
proposed version looks fine to me.  I'll install it soon.

    I've used
    require("lualatexquotejobname.lua")
    here rather than
    dofile(assert(kpse.find_file("lualatexquotejobname.lua")))

Sounds good to me.  Will do that too.

thanks,
k

(*) I intentionally did not update the plain-based luatex.ini or
dviluatex.ini because of various discrepancies in various places (which
I can't re-research right now, sorry), and haven't gotten back to it
yet.

BTW, I assume this is a TL issue as with MiKTeX/Strawberry Perl
everything works.

I have looked into the TL svn repository and the module is not present
there. The strawberry perl is not a complete perl distribution (no perl
distribution is complete) but missing modules can be installed from CPAN.
Probably MiKTeX users have already complained and MiKTeX maintainers have
installed them. Installation of this module should probably be done on
Windows.

Yes, and imho (don't have the time to test now) it is this problem:

Hello,

I do not think that usage of an external perl is a good solution. It may
help some users who have another perl for other purposes. It may contain
modules that are currently mising in the TL version. However, this will
require users to install their own perl and if these users are not perl
experts, it will cause much more troubles and it will go against the
philosophy of providing a perl distribution as a part of TL for Windows.
IMHO the right solution is to install the missing modules to the TL
distribution of Strawberry perl so that Windows users are not required to
have their own external perl.

Message-ID: <CABq4i1MZ0StnCZSfRFFjtnNH2g9Cq1wM_uXN_f2qmE-M_TrJDw@mail.gmail.com>

I just had an update fail for babel-latin.doc.tar.xz. I got a cryptic
server error on a download from my normal mirror (rit.edu). I tried a
manual download from the ctan.math.ca mirror through my browser and noticed
the MacAfee antivirus was blocking the file with this message:

URL:
http://ctan.math.ca/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/babel-latin.doc.tar.xz
Media Type: application/pdf
Virus Name: McAfeeGW: BehavesLike.PDF.Exploit-BAY

Are others having this problem?

Best regards,
John Minter

  I'm not: I'm getting a file of Content-Type application/x-xz, dated
22 August 01:21 UTC, size 156008 bytes, that does look seem to be a
valid xz'ed archive.  Here are a couple of checksums:

	MD5     4ddf252cab759604183f19b15f5092e3

Hi Karl, 

maybe it makes sense to do that:

WDYT?

When I do kpsewhich --help in texlive 2015 I get (beside others)

-show-path=NAME        output search path for file type NAME (list
below).

but the "list below" is missing. Is this intended?

Perhaps it is an oblivion when -help-formats option was added.
(list shown by -help-formats)?

Aah. I hadn't seen this new option. There is my list ;-)

Hi,

by curiosity I ran tlmgr check runfiles on my uptodate TL2015
a few files are found

$ tlmgr check runfiles
# afoot.sty

diff /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmap/t1.cmap /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/mmap/t1.cmap

and for afoot.sty at least the diff shows significant differences.

is this of any relevance to anyone anywhere anytime ?

Message-ID: <55E47083.3090708@riseup.net>

Dear TeX Live maintainers

There is a problem with the doclicense package in TeX Live. The package bundles
some PDF files which are later used via \includegraphics so they need to be
findable via kpsewhich.

Example which should work in a TeXLive installation:

kpsewhich doclicense-CC-zero.pdf
