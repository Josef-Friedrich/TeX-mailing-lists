Tried "Update TeXworks" from the TeX Live Manager (TeX Live 2014) but 
told no new version yet exists.

Yes, it will take some time for new builds to be produced and uploaded.
Also, TL'14 will be frozen soon (if it isn't, already), so Tw 0.4.6 is
likely to appear only in TL'15 (due to see its public release in June).

All the best,
Stefan

Hmm, not in my case. I can grab the handle and move it upward to scroll
up in the output, and smae reversed, too.

Hi Akrem,

> (running on Debian, switching to user mode!)

This is a Debian installation, and you are not using vanilla
TeX Live, but the TeX Live that comes with Debian, so it
might be better to contact the maintainers (which by chance is also me):
	debian-tex-maint at lists.debian.org

Furthermore, isn't that clear: ...

apt-get install xzdec

should solve your problem. But I recommend reading the man page
of tlmgr before continuing, you will work in USER MODE and need
to set up the user mode first, see man tlmgr.

Best

Hi all,

I have TL2014 installed with libertine revision: 35870.  There is a text file `dingle' in opentype directory, which is IMO misplaced.

~> tlmgr info --list libertine | grep dingel
  texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/libertine/dingel

Is this a TL issue?  CTAN does not carry this file.

It is in libertine.tds.zip on CTAN, which is what gets installed in TL.

Looking at the file, it seems obvious it should not be there.
I removed it.  Bob T (the libertine maintainer) is on this list ...

Yes, it should be removed. For some reason a redirected
e-mail message was saved in that directory. That file also
made it into MiKTeX. I've removed it from my sources and
will upload revised files ASAP. Thanks for the report.

Hi there!

I have just installed tex-live via the net and I tried to use the command
tlmgr --gui
only to be told:

(running on Debian, switching to user mode!)
Loading local TeX Live database
  (/home/gwbennett/texmf/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb)
This may take some time, please be patient ...
cannot setup TLPDB in /home/gwbennett/texmf ar /usr/bin/tlmgr line 5336.
Compilation failed in require ar /usr/bin/tlmgr line 4445.

Clearly I have missed something about the establishment of TLPDB - is it
to be a directory and there is a permission problem ? My browse through the
documentation for tlmgr has not given me a pointer; I hope that the list
can.

By the way, where does TL keep its packages ?

Thanks for any and all assistance ..
Cheers

Hello,

I am using texlive-20130530 and I remark that the output of pdflatex in the terminal is formatted like that: an automatic line break in inserted after 80 characters.
It means that the lines are limited in length so it does not fit correctly in my terminal that can contains more characters for a line.

How to disable this automatic line break at 80 characters in the output of pdflatex please?

Thank you.
Best regards.

but you are running *NOT* TeX Live as installed from the net, but
as installed by Debian.

WHere did you install TeX Live to? To which path?

Did you adjust the PATH setting?

Nice this works using environment variables:
export max_print_line=1000
export error_line=254
export half_error_line=238

But this does not work adding lines to the end of the texmf.cnf file:
[...]
max_print_line=1000
error_line=254
half_error_line=238

Do you see why it does not work with the edited texmf.cnf file?

In fact, in the "/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf" file, there was already these lines:
error_line = 79
half_error_line = 50
max_print_line = 79

So, I have replaced them by:
error_line=254
half_error_line=238
max_print_line=1000

I have done that instead of adding these lines at the end of the file.
It works fine now.

I have also tried to create the missing "/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf.cnf" file and adding these three lines but in this case, it does not work.

In fact, as I am on Slackware 14.1, my texlive 20130530 has been patched.
So, my path are maybe not the one of the original texlive 20130530 version.
For example, instead of "/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf" I have "/usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf".
And I thought that instead of "/usr/local/texlive/2014/texmf.cnf" the system-distributed file could be "/usr/share/texmf.cnf".
Maybe my guess is wrong and it explains why it does not work with this system-distributed file.

Is there a way to know where is the system-distributed file?

At first, type "echo $PATH" and examine the result. You can also try "which
tex" to see which executable is used. In the list defined in PATH the first
one wins. Usually it makes no problem if you have several TeX distributions
in PATH but it may be a source of weird behaviour. Suppose you have TeX
from your linux distro in /usr/share/bin and /usr/share/texmf-dist and TeX
Live in /usr/local/texlive/2014. TeX from linux distros is often
incomplete. It may thus happen that you call some binaries from
/usr/share/bin and other binaries from /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/arch. I
saw a lot of weird errors causing by such a mess.

My suggestion is:
1. If you are happy with your linux distro's TeX, do not install TeX Live
from TUG
2. If you want TeX Live from TUG and you are unable to instruct you linux
not to install its own TeX, put TeX Live binary path to the _beginning_ of
PATH.

Other useful cdiagnostic commands are:
which kpsewhich
kpsewhich -all texmf.cnf

(kpsewhich manual is worth reading)

Message-ID: <552A4BC8.2070106@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I installed MacTeX 2013, MacTeX basic 2014 and TeX Live 2014 via 
MacPorts on my Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) machine.
Only the first two are listed in the TeX Distribution Preference Pane.
Both /usr/texbin and /opt/local/bin (MacPorts bin directory) are listed 
in $PATH in this order.
What am I doing wrong?

Best wishes.
Davide

This really belongs on the <MacOSX-TeX at email.esm.psu.edu> mailing list, since it is very specific to OS X.

But first: why both the MacTex and TeX Live installations?  And why MacTeX 2013, and not 2014?

Howdy,

I forgot to add that in a PS to my answer to him. Especially since MacTeX-2014 installs a complete, pre-configured TeX Live 2014. 

Good Luck,

Davide,

The TeX Dist Preference Pane requires that a data structure describing the distribution
exist in /Library/TeX/Distributions. The data structure is a small collection of symbolic links
to various parts of the distribution. MacTeX installs the data structure when it
installs TeX Live or Basic TeX. It is up to the authors of other distributions to install the
structure or ignore it. If they ignore it, their distribution will not appear in the Preference
Pane.

The symbolic link /usr/texbin is also installed by MacTeX. It points into the data structure, 
and then eventually into the distribution chosen by the Preference Pane. Many GUI apps
look for TeX in /usr/texbin by default, but most or all can be configured to look elsewhere.

If your distribution doesn?t install the data structure, there are two ways to proceed. One is
the manage all your GUI apps manually, reconfiguring them when you want to switch
distributions. A better approach is to invent a symbolic link, and configure your GUI apps
to look at that link. Then to switch distributions you only need redefine the link. Choosing
/usr/texbin for that link is not a good idea because the Preference Pane will rewrite it if
it has the wrong value.

    Is there a way to know where is the system-distributed file?

kpsewhich --all texmf.cnf
will show all texmf.cnf's that it finds in the path used for that.

kpsewhich --show-path=cnf will show the path.  (Typically long,

Hi,

I wanted to try out the TL2015 pretest, 

but I don't understand the situation with binaries, for example in 

/Users/???/Downloads/TL2015/bin/x86_64-darwin

I have

ttys000:Downloads (09:36)$ ls -l TL2015/bin/x86_64-darwin/xetex
-rwx------  1 ??? ????  19431216 22 mai  2014 TL2015/bin/x86_64-darwin/xetex

which is the TL2014 (not 2015) binary

I proceeded via

rsync -a  --delete --exclude="mactex*" -- ctan.ijs.si::mirror/tlpretest/ ~/Downloads/tlpretest/

then I ran tl-install and got the things installed in my

~/Downloads/TL2015

I manually manipulated the /Library/TeX/Distributions/ (this is on Mac OS X) 
to add a TeXLive-pre2015.texdist collection of symbolic links and it is
all perfectly fine.

However I got surprised with a test file for xetex + pstricks not
working properly
and in the
end realized that there was no problems with my symbolic links
but that the installed binaries were the ones of TL2014, not TL2015.

Is this a problem of my chosen TL2105 pretest mirror ?

True. The tlpretest repository for 2015 hasn't even been announced
anywhere yet and it is not yet ready.
Most "TL 2015" binaries haven't even been compiled yet.

If you want to experiment, you need to wait for at least a couple of
days (or more).

I didn't know tlpretest had not started, the schedule lists it with
a link for how to proceed,

It is still on schedule. The TL'14 repository was frozen and tlpretest
*is* there. (If you would try a few days earlier you would only see an
empty repository, no packages). But it is called "pretest" with a good
reason. Code and binaries have to transition from 2014 to 2015 *after*
TL'14 is frozen, meaning that at the moment of the initial tlpretest
setup, most of the stuff (if not everything other than repository
version) is still at "2014". You have to wait for a few days until the
person responsible for builds for your platform commits the binaries
(http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/).

Once that is settled, there will certainly be one problem or another
that will have to be discovered and fixed in the timeframe of the
testing period.

I am not familiar with the procedure, thanks for the explanations
As it turned out I had compiled the binaries back in November 
(precisely for the xetex+pstricks+Ghostscript 9.15 problem)
and
again early March from the svn trunk, thus I guess I can already copy 
them to my pre-TL2015 tree, as a temporary measure

Sure. You can use your own binaries. If you compile them again you'll
even get the "TL 2015" name. (You can also put the binaries under a
different directory, say, "x86_64-darwin14" and set the PATH variable
to point there. As long as the relative path to the rest of TL stays
the same, it should work.) There is even a command-line option (which
I forgot) that allows you to install binaries from a custom location.

I will do that. I have a note that it takes about 15 minutes compiling the binaries.

I rsync'ed, I now launch the compilation.

ok, on Mac OS (from MacTeX) we have a /usr/texbin symbolic link which we 
can point to the wished location 

there is no need ever adjusting PATH

ok I will simply copy the binaries (once compiled... done!) to my TL2015/bin/x86_64-darwin/

That's true, but then you need to adjust the symlink. I'm not sure
what happens if you adjust the symlink manually to a weird location
and then try to use the GUI tool for the rest of operations (switching
to a different distribution etc.).

Why? Shouldn't $TLROOT/bin/whatever-weird-name work as well?

I have not tried: I copied all produced binaries to my TL2015 tree.
I then had to recreate all formats.
Seems to work fine, I could compile my test file

For switching to a complete distribution there is no need adjusting 
the texbin symlink itself. 

What one does on Mac OS is to add suitable things to /Library/TeX/Distributions
(actually one does not do anything, the MacTeX guys do it, but here I am
being adventurous)

ttys000:~ (11:33)$ ls -al /Library/TeX/Distributions/
total 64
drwxr-xr-x  13 ???  wheel    442 13 avr 08:57 .
drwxr-xr-x   7 ???  wheel    238 28 jui  2014 ..
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102 13 avr 10:30 .DefaultTeX
drwxr-xr-x   8 ???  wheel    272 28 jui  2014 .FactoryDefaults
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102  7 sep  2012 Fink-teTeX.texdist
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102  7 sep  2012 MacPorts-TeXLive.texdist
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102  7 sep  2012 MacPorts-teTeX.texdist
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102 28 jui  2014 Programs
-rw-r--r--   1 ???  wheel  31302  7 sep  2012 TeXDist-description.rtf
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102  7 sep  2012 TeXLive-2012.texdist
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102 20 jui  2013 TeXLive-2013.texdist
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102 28 jui  2014 TeXLive-2014.texdist
drwxr-xr-x   3 ???  wheel    102 13 avr 09:01 TeXLive-pre2015.texdist

The TeXLive-pre2015.texdist is a collection of symlinks, I copied them
from TeXLive-2014.texdist and changed the destinations in an emacs dired buffer

The choice of distribution is then done via small utility
which changes only ONE link:

ttys000:~ (11:41)$ ls -l  /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX
total 8
lrwxr-xr-x  1 ???  wheel  35 13 avr 10:30 Contents -> ../TeXLive-pre2015.texdist/Contents

As for GUI tool, the one I use on Mac OS is TeX Live Utility,
it works well with the above set-up.

I have configured it to use a http TL2015 pretest mirror as home,
Currently it just says "no updates available", naturally as I did 
the rsync + tlinstall this morning.

>From now on I think I will be able to use it to update the TL2015 pretest
(including binaries). There will be no need for using directly tlmgr
(and I can trash my rsync'ed mirrored pretest tree)

Once TL2015/MacTeX is released I will only need to reset the default repository 
in TeX Live Utility to http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

best,
Jean-Fran?ois

Ah, OK. All should be fine then. 99.9% users would never do that,
which is why I didn't expect the existence of "TL 2015 pretest"
texdist on your machine either.

(Explaining to newbies how to create a texdist would be pointless /
way too complex and changing the PATH would be by far the easiest
solution. That was the reason why I initially suggested it. I know how
to make it, but nevertheless I never bothered making one for anything
else but experiments and relied on changing PATH for tlpretest in the
past.)

Dear Dick,

the data structure for MacPorts TeX Live is installed by MacTeX and as 
far as I can see the symlinks inside it point to the correct locations.
See also the last paragraph in
http://www.tug.org/mactex/multipletexdistributions.html

Also, MacPorts TeX Live is correctly recognized by texdist (although it 
also incorrectly lists MacPorts teTeX, which used to install files in 
the same locations of MacPorts TeX Live)

$ texdist --list
MacPorts-TeXLive.texdist
MacPorts-teTeX.texdist
TeXLive-2013.texdist
TeXLive-2014-Basic.texdist

What do texdist and the preference pane check to determine if a 
distribution is available?
I thought that the preference pane would use texdist, but this obviously 
is not the case.

Davide


P.S. I agree that the data structure should be installed by the 
distribution, even only because MacPorts can be installed in prefixes 
different from /opt/local, or to correctly discern between MacPorts TeX 
Live and MacPorts teTeX.
But this is not possible if MacTeX already installs them: what name 
should the data structures have (being the obvious ones already used)? 
Will the user see both the MacTeX-provided and the MacPorts-provided 
data structures? Who should delete the data structures provided by MacTeX?
I'm willing to help improving this (e.g. I could prepare a port for the 
data structure in MacPorts), but I don't know how we could migrate from 
the current situation to the desired one without messing with user files 
and expectations.

P.P.S. It would be very useful to have the preference pane available as 
a separate installer: I wanted to check whether the preference pane had 
been updated and I had to install MacTeX basic (i.e. about 285 MB more 
than I needed).

I don't like adjusting PATH because I always forget in what file it is
set up (some years back I recall some ~/.zsh.rc, now it is rather
~/.bashrc no ~/.profile no rather ~/.bash_profile) I always forget the
syntax (is it export? is it setenv?)

(to be honest I would only need modifying what's fortunately already 
there in .bash_profile, but I would be hesitant if I needed to do it from
scratch)

besides there is always this problem that I don't know if GUI app will
actually react to my .bash_profile, perhaps I need to do stuff in,
how is it called again, ah yes /etc/paths.d, well I had forgotten there 
is a TeX file in this directory with contents the single line /usr/texbin
(I had forgotten it and I don't need to worry about ever modifying it)

The Gerben Wierda/J?r?me Laurens TeXDist Preference Pane for Mac OS 
is truly a blessing (comes with MacTeX)

A single click and the whole distribution is changed back to TL2012 if I
wish

(the only trouble with the TeXLive architecture is that texmf-local
remains the same, which is not always appropriate, one can imagine
things were suitably added in 2012 by the user in texmf-local (CTAN
stuff not distributed by texlive), but not in 2014; as it stands each
year I must create a zip archive of my texmf-local, in case one day I
really want to recreate an exact earlier situation; which is all silly
dream anyhow as in the meantime the Mac OS will have changed and I am
not even sure the old executables will all still run. As for pdftex
etc... the few times I did it it worked)

It will but bash_profile is read only when the graphic environment starts,
therefore after changing bach_profile you have to restart your graphic
environment which is not pleasant. In my Linux computers I have
/usr/local/current which is a symlink to the current version. If I want to
use temporarily another version, I change PATH for a single terminal.

But that's just because windows binaries were committed yesterday already:
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive?limit_changes=0&view=revision&revision=36810
Mac binaries have only been committed today (and should theoretically
start working tomorrow).

I guessed that ;-). I just wanted to say that windows users can

In fact, it is not really a distro-provided package because Slackware 14.1 is not providing TexLive.
It is a package that I have built using a script from: http://slackbuilds.org/
Anyway, the problem is the same: If I need help with this package, I need to contact the packager, not this mailing-list.
However, I think my problem is not relative to the package itself as I am just wondering how TexLive is managing the path to find the texmf.cnf file.

And you have answered well, thank you:

$ kpsewhich --all texmf.cnf
/usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

$ kpsewhich --show-path=cnf
/usr/bin:/usr/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/bin/share/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/bin/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/bin/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/bin/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/bin/texmf/web2c:/usr:/usr/share/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/texmf/web2c://../texmf-local/web2c:/://share/texmf-local/web2c://share/texmf-dist/web2c://share/texmf/web2c://texmf-local/web2c://texmf-dist/web2c://texmf/web2c

I see these interesting path:
- /usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c
- /usr/share/texmf/web2c

They are interesting for me because the prefix "/usr/share" is my favourite in the prefix proposed by the command and because the "/usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c" and "/usr/share/texmf/" directories already exist in my system.

Is there a reason to prefer using the "/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf" file instead of "/usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/web2c/texmf.cnf"?
What happen if two "texmf.cnf" are available (one in each of these directories)?
Is there a way to have a local "texmf.cnf" file containing only my 3 added lines, and a global "texmf.cnf" file containing all the default lines in order to override only the part I want by editing my local file?
Maybe it should be better to have a hidden directory somewhere in my home directory to contain my "texmf.cnf" file?

Message-ID: <AEA4679A-7659-4DB2-B834-FFCC0A2B950A@free.fr>

Hi,

this morning I downloaded TL2015 in pretest and used tl-install,
with the following set-up

 <D> directories:
   TEXDIR (the main TeX directory):
     /Users/???/Downloads/TL2015

(I use this repertory because I excluded Downloads from Time Machine 
archival, this is Mac OS X)

   TEXMFLOCAL (directory for site-wide local files):
     /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
   ... more config ...

I discover now in my 

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

a symlink

texmf-local -> ../../../../../../../usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

it is from today at 8:58 local time.

I wonder the meaning of this and if it is normal part of the tl-install
action

Hi

I get

mktemp: illegal option -- -
usage: mktemp [-d] [-q] [-t prefix] [-u] template ...
       mktemp [-d] [-q] [-u] -t prefix 

trying
texhash --version 
and
texhash --help 
both do the same

however this texhash (mktexlsr) is the one I compiled
from sources on my mac os x 64bit

	* version.ac (tex_live_version): starting pretest, no more /dev.


I compiled simply doing ./Build

sorry if I make noise for badly compiled version locally on
my machine

as an aside: in case I get further problems of this type should I report
on this mailing list or rather on tex-k at tug.org ?

I had the same problem after installing it earlier on linux.

the problem seems to be located in the mktexlsr script (texhash is a
symlink to mktexlsr) which has on line 76:

treefile=`mktemp --tmpdir mktexlsrtrees.XXXXXXXXXX` || exit 1

looking at the same script from texlive 2014, every thing is identical
apart from that line and a few comments at the beginning. using the line
from 2014 fixes the problem:

treefile="${TMPDIR-/tmp}/mktexlsrtrees$$.tmp"

basically, mktemp doesn't have (currently, maybe a future version
will) an --tmpdir
flag

hope this helps

Greg

Subject: [tex-live] Texworks with Tex-Live on Linux
Message-ID: <552BDBE1.2040604@sdu.dk>

Hi all

I am confused about whether or not the Texworks editor is installed as 
part of the Tex-Live distribution on Linux systems.

According to the documentation the choice of editor on Linux is left for 
the user:
> https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-380003.5 
> (2nd paragraph):

> TEX Live installs TEXworks (http://tug.org/texworks) on Windows, and 
> MacTEX installs TeXShop (http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop. On 
> other Unix systems, it?s left up to you to choose an editor

Yet when I perform a manual installation of TexLive on Ubuntu 14.04 I 
see "TeXworks editor" as an option in the text gui installer: 
http://imgur.com/eJzJYzb

After completing the installation (with the components shown in 
http://imgur.com/eJzJYzb), and adding directories to path as suggested 
by the installer, I can successfully run commands like "pdflatex" or 
"tex --version" on the commandline, but I can not easily figure out how 
to open TeXworks. There is a folder 
/usr/local/texlive/2014/tlpkg/texworks, but it does not contain an 
executable. Invoking "texworks" on the commandline only cause my Ubuntu 
system to say "The program 'texworks' is not currently installed."

What is the deal here? Should I expect TeXworks to be installed in Linux 
or not? If it is indeed installed, how might I start it after completing 
the installation? I have tested this specifically on Ubuntu 14.04, and I 
do not know if similar issues exist on Fedora, Arch Linux, etc.

Thank you for your input!

Hi,

AFAIK Linux version of TeX Live does not install software tools that are
standard parts of Linux distros. TeXworks belongs to this class of
software. I do not have it but I have just verified that in Fedora it is
installable by yum. Other distros will certainly provide it as a package.
There may be a danger that it will install Linux distro's TeX. In such a
case you must be sure that TeX Live's bim path is at the beginning of your
PATH.

Yes, this was a change I suggested.

Huuuu? GNU coreutils' mktemp *does have
  -p DIR, --tmpdir[=DIR]  interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR; if DIR is not
                        specified, use $TMPDIR if set, else /tmp.  With
                        this option, TEMPLATE must not be an absolute name;
                        unlike with -t, TEMPLATE may contain slashes, but
                        mktemp creates only the final component

What kind of mktemp are you using?

A lot of places (stackoverflow, ask-ubuntu, tex.stackexchange.com etc.) 
you can read what you've said; that TeX-Live does not install binaries 
for TeXworks on Linux.

Can we confirm this from the documentation or the like? The installation 
guide says that the choice of editor is left for the user on Linux, but 
yet there is a option called "TeXworks" during the installation process 
on Linux. Couldn't the installation guide be a little more specific; 
maybe saying "(no binary installed, only settings files)"?

Subject: [tex-live] fmtutil in TL 2015
Message-ID: <20150414053907.GI20200@auth.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi everyone,

we are not sure whether *anyone* is at all concerned by this change,
but the tlpretest and TL2015 will bring a new implementation of 
fmtutil in perl, which also changes its operation mode in the same
way updmap was change to the "multi" updmap 2 years ago. That means,
from now on *all* fmtutil.cnf files are read.
That also means that the mechanism currently in use
	fmtutil-local.cnf
in TEXMFLOCAL/web2c wil lnot be supported anymore, if you have
any settings there they need to be moved over.

Far from being as oftne used as multi-updmap, I don't expect
too much problems with it. But there might be a few bugs and 
incompatibilities, please report them here.

ALso note for those integrators, that the format of the output
has changed.

For more details I have written an explanation with some examples:
http://www.preining.info/blog/2015/04/tex-live-the-new-multi-fmtutil/

All the best

> What kind of mktemp are you using?

Attached is the man page.

Excerpt:

MKTEMP(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                MKTEMP(1)

NAME
     mktemp -- make temporary file name (unique)

SYNOPSIS
     mktemp [-d] [-q] [-t prefix] [-u] template ...
     mktemp [-d] [-q] [-u] -t prefix

[...]

OPTIONS

     The available options are as follows:

     -d      Make a directory instead of a file.

     -q      Fail silently if an error occurs.  This is useful if a script
             does not want error output to go to standard error.

     -t prefix
             Generate a template (using the supplied prefix and TMPDIR if set)
             to create a filename template.

     -u      Operate in ``unsafe'' mode.  The temp file will be unlinked
             before mktemp exits.  This is slightly better than mktemp(3) but
             still introduces a race condition.  Use of this option is not
             encouraged.

[...]

HISTORY
     A mktemp utility appeared in OpenBSD 2.1.  This implementation was writ-
     ten independently based on the OpenBSD man page, and first appeared in
     FreeBSD 2.2.7.  This man page is taken from OpenBSD.

BSD                            December 30, 2005                           BSD

--exclude="mactex*" rsync://ftp.cstug.cz::pub/tex/local/tlpretest
/TeX/Live/2015/Pretest

Rsync appears to have done nothing for at least 12 hours; it just sits
there, and the file count remains constant at 9542; how is one meant to
know when Rsync has done its work and it is therefore safe to start
installation ?

Rsync should stop / finish working and return. If it doesn't stop for
a very long time, you can stop it manually (Ctrl-C) and run it again.
You can run it with a verbose flag (rsync -av ...) or even "--stats"
to see which files it is transferring.

If you suspect some problem with the mirror (rsyncd process stuck
somewhere), you can also try to sync from a different one just to see
if anything changes (our mirror is
rsync://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/).

I will check.

Did XeTeX accidentally become more "clever" about normalisation rules
during the last year? Or maybe it started doing automatic word
splitting and now automatically inserts spaces in the middle of
hyphenation patterns as well? It could also be related to changes in
ICU. It's weird because I don't see the pattern "?4?" appear anywhere.
There are these patterns:
35 ?4??
37 ?4??
39 ?4??
42 ?4??
44 ?4??
46 ?4??
52 ?4??
55 ?4??
but nowhere I see the isolated string reported as duplicate.

In case anything of the above is true, we have a problem that we need
to address before TL 2015 comes out.

There is no problem here to create xelatex.fmt (w32) (directory names are slightly different from TeX Live):

Thank you, Mojca; now tried with qualifier "-av", and it terminated,
using the same mirror.

I install 2015 pretest yesterday without problems. But todays update
fails:

I had the same problem this morning as Ulrike,
I used Tex Live Utility on a Mac OS, and after doing the "critical updates"

2015-04-14 06:34:30 +0000 Notice -[TLMMainWindowController _handleListUpdatesFinishedNotification:][76009]	Critical updates detected: (
     "texlive.infra",
     "texlive.infra.x86_64-darwin"
)

there was an error message  which I have lost now about version numbers
not having changed

and then TLU wanted always to go again the critical update

thus I quit and redid the installation via updating my rsync'ed
mirror  + install-tl

Yesterday April 13
I compiled all binaries from tldevsrc source repository and there
was no problem with generating formats for xelatex and xetex

Today I got the binaries from tlpretest mirror, and got the problem
  -rwx------    1 ???  staff  22651628 Apr 13 14:47 xetex

I tried just now to update my tldevsrc and I recompiled all binaries, 
on my machine (Mac OS X mavericks) and
now, contrarily to yesterday, xetex has the identical
problem as the one from today's tlpretest

(I had to manually do the various texhash because the current mktexlsr 
does not work on Mac OS X mavericks but the other formats had no problem
only xetex/xelatex)

I just wanted to confirm that I'm able to reproduce the problem on Mac
OS X 10.7. Like JF I had to manually patch mktexlsr first (lack of
"mktemp --tmpdir" as already reported in "problem (perhaps) with
texhash in TL2015 pretest" on the mailing list), but the format
generation broke at exactly the same point.

It might be worth noting that Peter imported the latest version of ICU
two days ago.

If you are willing to confirm the suspect, you can go to the source tree, run
    svn up -r36779
then rebuild everything and copy just the xetex binary into your TL
2015 tree, then try to remake the formats again.

It could also be that you would need to go as far back as r36558 if
the above won't help.
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=36559

In any case I suspect that we'll need some help from XeTeX developers.

Karl, should we temporary disable Thai patterns, so that at least the
formats will build for users willing to test the rest of tlpretest?

Are you really, really sure that it's not too early to get started on
pretesting? Why not just wait for Karl's starter's gun?

(1) The difference from yesterday in the case of xelatex.fmt:
xelatex.ini was updated for LaTeX2e <2015/01/01>, and now
unicode-letters.def is used instead of the unicode-letters.tex.
There is no problem here in the new LaTeX2e and xelatex.ini.

(2) For xetex.fmt, nothing is changed.
So it is strange if it was OK yesterday, but it is NG today.

Best,
Akira

Ah. Missing entries in unicode-letters.def/tex could easily explain
the behaviour we are seeing. It could be that the character
immediately following "?4?" is not/no longer defined to be a letter
(it might indeed be an accent or so).

The changes between unicode-letters.tex and unicode-letters.def are
too big to be able to diagnose anything quickly.

I wanted to look at the newest luatex, I wanted to try the new latex
and I just have some time - next week could be different. 

I'm not expecting that everything work. My system is setup so that I
can switch between the texsystem with two keystrokes, so testing
doesn't do any harm.

That was only a minor update from the icu-55.1 release candidate to the
final release, hardly affecting XeTeX.

> Is XeTeX going to switch back from HarfBuzz to ICU?

Certainly not, but XeTeX uses HarfBuzz for layout and some ICU libraries
(not the layout library libicule) for general Unicode things (and
libharfbuzz also uses libicuuc).

ICU with the layout library libicule and without HarfBuzz was last used for
TL'12.

Hi,

I am off my mac laptop for some hours, and can not test further
until later today. I hope I have not been sending everyone offtrack.

To recapitulate, yesterday I had

1) the pretest from yesterday morning

2) fresh compiled binaries (for mac os x) from the tldevsrc svn trunk. 
I moved all binaries after generation to the bin/ of my TL2015 pretest

3) I then regenerated all formats and got no error message
(I did not check the log, perhaps there were some silent errors)

Today I had

1) the pretest from today morning

2) which includes the binaries for darwin 64 bits

I also tried to recompile the binaries but this changed nothing

I *think* I also tried (but that was 2 hours ago and had lunch
in between) with the yesterday (home compiled) xetex binary together
with the today TL2015, and I got the same Duplicated Pattern errors

This made me think indeed something external to xetex had changed
in between

best

I look a bit at the difference between unicode-letters.tex and .def
and there are some more entries in .def. The most probable suspect
is imho

 \L 0E4C 0E4C 0E4C 

which didn't exist in .tex and which isn't a letter but a mark:
http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0e4c/index.htm

This unicode char is used above in the 55 line.

Hi Zdenek,

> I will check what it will mean to my setting.

If you used to change format definitions etc, then this will be
a good addition for you, as you only need to add it to
TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/fmtutil.cnf and it will be automatically
picked up. No need to edit anything.

Hopefully!

Argggg... that is a stupid bug indeed ... I fix it in a minute...

Do you have a log of the *original* self update:

No, I only have the log from the last attempt.

But I used for the first try this repository
ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/
and there update-tlmgr-latest.exe seems to be broken: its size is
reported as 0 bit. Could this be the problem? (in other repositories
the size looks ok)

Ok, I have switched back to using hard coded path in mktexlsr.
It seems that the variety of mktemp needs much more investigation
before doing such a switch.

That will fix the problems.

You were in the process of an rsync run on he server,
typical setup problems ..

I recommend running rsync 3-4 times in sequence and check that there
are no incremental changes before doing anything else.

If you can somehow reproduce the problem with self update on Windows,
please please let me know. I don't see any relevant changes.

Maybe also the texlvie.infra.tar.xz was 0 bytes ... that would make it
fail indeed.

Someone at some point has to catch the problems, report them and/or fix them.

While it helps to avoid reports like "ConTeXt doesn't work" before the
version of ConTeXt that's compatible with the latest LuaTeX even gets
imported, it doesn't hurt if problems like broken XeTeX formats,
broken mktexlsr on Mac etc. get fixed as early in the process as
possible.

If people are aware that they are testing and not installing tlpretest
for mission critical project, that seems perfectly ok to me.

To me it is not displayed as a 0-bit file but as a soft link:

Hi Norbert,

it was the same with fmtutil-local.cnf, I have just removed latex and
pdflatex and added definitions with encTeX enabled. this file has been
living in my TEXMFLOCAL for several years without any modification. I have
no time to read your explanation right now, I will read it at about
midnight.

I didn't use rsync (I don't have it) but the netinstaller and tlmgr
update --self.

Currently I can't do anything. I'm waiting if anything
(update-tlmgr-latest.exe or whatever) changes so that I can repair
tlmgr.  (just tried again first update-tlmgr-latest and then tlmgr
update --self and it fails).


But next time I will save the log ;-).

Certainly possible: we've checked for various things but it makes sense
to structure slightly differently (particularly when doing the parsing
with TeX).

If you read all of the set-up in unicode-letters.tex you'll find

    \def\l #1 {\L #1 #1 #1 } % letter without case mappings
    \let\m=\l % combining mark - treated as uncased letter

then later

    \m 0E4C

i.e. 0E4C ends up as

    \L 0E4C 0E4C 0E4C

but at the point of reading the file rather than writing it. In
unicode-letters.def I've tried to optimise for reading so do the work in
the processing step (as only I or another member of the team have to sit
through that).

It would not surprise me if there are errors in the set up at the
moment, but this one looks OK to me. For a check

    \showthe\catcode"0E4C %

Hi,

I tried the following experiment: copy the xetex and xdvipdfmx
binaries from TL2014 to my TL2015/bin/x86_64-darwin

and enerate the xelatex.fmt format with 
xetex -ini  -jobname=xelatex -progname=xelatex -etex xelatex.ini

There is no (Duplicate Pattern) error then.

And then xelatex small2e works (this is why I transplanted also
xdvipdfmx from TL2014)

apart from these two binaries, this is with the TeXLive2015 pretest
tree as off this morning.

XeTeX switched from ICU ?Layout Engine? to HarfBuzz, there is much more
of ICU than the layout engine (which is, incidentally, being removed
from ICU) and XeTeX still use parts of it.

Hi Norbert,

I have read your article and the change will have almost no impact on me, I
just have to move the stuff from fmtutil-local.cnf to fmtutil.cnf and
synchronize the file on all my computers. It is a matter of a few seconds
to do it.

That is exactly the only step necessary, unless you disable 
formats, in which case the format has slightly changed.

If you update today, you might get errors from fmtutil due to
a missing option
	--no-errors-if-no-formats
This options is now a noop, but I forgot to add it. Fixed for
tomorrow.

Also, running fmtutil-sys will tell you
	blabla ... hidden sysmode ....
Also fixed for tomorrow.

Note also that in the original report about Thai patterns, the error 
messages show lines from the patterns file with their last character 
U+0E20 (?) missing. Again, 0x20 in the lower byte (which will be the 
leading byte in the buffer on little-endian platforms).

It looks to me like there could be something broken fairly early in the 
input-scanning process (but after conversion from UTF-8 to UTF-16) 
whereby a line-final UTF-16 character that begins with 0x20 is being 
discarded as though it were a <space>. But this apparently doesn't 
affect the Win32 binary, as the testcases work fine for Akira. (Is it 
ONLY on OS X, or has this been observed on other platforms?)

Unfortunately, I don't have a current development build handy for 
debugging purposes. Anyone....?

It works OK for me on x86_64-linux an sparc-solaris (I'm not sure when
linux and mac binaries have been compiled, but sparc solaris binaris
include the "latest ICU patches" in TL tree for sure).

It's been pointed out to me that classical TeX does have this, so
presumably it is a deliberate change :-)

Yes, and \exhyphenpenalty is used to control it.

XeTeX has a new primitive to enable/disable it (I forgot its name)

Message-ID: <CAC1phyadxVR7mHAQ_V8Mo_G55Qrz17=pW9YAbcpm8fPO637Hsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to open a question of GNU FreeFont that should be clarified before
TL 2015 gets frozen for DVD. As we know, the latest official release is
quite old and its Devanagari block does not work with HarfBuzz. On the
other hand, the Devanagari block in the subversion repository is OK (I will
test it soon with TL 2015 pretest in order to be sure). This means that one
of the most beautiful Devanagari fonts is not officially available to
normal users. Some time ago TL 2014 started to distribute GNU FreeFont from
the head of the svn repository. This seems to be good news for users but
bad news for font developers. I see two possibilities:

1. If the font is ready for an official release, it would be good to
release it before TL is frozen for DVD production

2. If there are still too things to be resolved before release, we should
take advantage of the possibility of several TL repositories. The standard
repository should contain the officially released FreeFont while an
additional repository will contain FreeFont from the head of the svn repo.
The advantage is that those who prefer a stable font and do not need
Devanagari will not configure this additional TL repo. Those who need
Devanagari and are prepared to take the risk that the font does not work
will configure this additional repository.

Is this reasonable?

After some very very basic testing:

- There is a problem with the latest XeTeX as shipped with TeX Live
2015 pretest on Mac OS X.

- I tested x86_64-linux, sparc-solaris and Kakuto-san tested windows.
There are no problems on those platforms (using exactly the same TeX
support files). The x86_64-darwin binary from TeX Live 2014 also works
as expected, so it's unlikely that there would be something
fundamentally wrong with (La)TeX support files.

- The problem is reproducible with both x86_64-darwin and i386-darwin
(universal-darwin).

Hi Zdenek,

what you describe is already happening!

* TeX Live contains the latest released version

* my tlptexlive contains the svn head

The svn head was *never* part of TeX Live

So I don't see any problem here.

Unfortunately Steve was not very happy about this development, but maybe this has changed?

All the best

Norbert

Hi Norbert,

thank you for clarification. When the information appeared on Kevin's blog
and in the XeTeX list, it was not clear that the svn head is distributed in
the "opt-in" TL repository. I hpe this solution is OK.

Do you just package automatically the head or do you run some tests before
doing it? I have a lot of test files for Devanagari. The tests are not
machine radable, it is necessary to look at the PDF files. I can do it
before you package a new svn release.

Indeed: I'd forgotten about that one :-)

Of course, what goes into the traced log in LuaTeX might vary from what
pdfTeX does, even if the outcomes are the same!

  Good catch, that makes a very likely culprit indeed.

Hi Zdenek,

The latest release version of GNU FreeFont is the 2012 version.

The files in SVN are intermediate copies, untested, and known to be
broken in various ways.

I don't know what "opt-in" means in this context.

Zdenek, out of deference to you and your work with the FreeFont
project, I would be willing to cut some problematic areas out of the
development versions, and do some degree of testing, and make a
special release for your project.  This will take some weeks.  Will
that fit your plans?

Frankly, I'm shocked that anybody would consider releasing
intermediate versions of somebody else's project without discussing it
with them first...  but evidently it happens.  Somebody has
misunderstood something -- maybe it was me.  I will shut down public
access to the SVN of GNU FreeFont as soon as I get a chance.  We must
be free to commit questionable changes, without fear that somebody
will build them and release them to the public.

Of course, it's free software.  And since they have been freely
available for download, the intermediate files are also free software.
So in principle you can release those SVN files -- but if you do so,
please change the name of the font, and handle any bug reports about
them yourself.  We do not want bug reports on half-completed, untested
work.

Cheers!

This is a very bad idea.  Many people (including me) are following the
development with interest.

Well, this happens, and you can't do anything against that.  Instead
of `shutting down' I recommend that you create a `stable' branch that
holds `releasable' versions of the fonts.  The development branch
should be then explicitly declared as unstable (with a big fat README
explaining this in more detail).

> We do not want bug reports on half-completed, untested work.

Again, this is a bad idea.  You should rather ask reporters that they
(a) use a specific SVN version for testing, or (b) exactly specify the
used SVN version.

The LaTeX kernel changes about allocation mean that the etex package is
no longer needed to get extended allocation. As a result, etoolbox no
longer loads the etex package if a new kernel is available. Looks like
forest doesn't explicitly load the etex package but then relies on it.
Adding \RequirePackage{etex} should fix the document, but really the
forest package should get adjusted.

I recall having seen the relevant CTAN announcement with an etoolbox 
release on c.t.tex. I CC to the maintainer of the forest package.

I do not master grep enough to scan the style files for identifying
packages loading etoolbox but not etex AND relying on some things like
\locbox, there might be a few besides forest.sty

We did a sweep over TL before making the changes in the kernel: there
were a few uses of \loc.../\glob but most seemed to be in places where
etex was loaded explicitly.

Hi Norbert,

what does fmtutil do if TEXMFLOCAL/web2c contains foth fmtutil.cnf and
fmtutil-local.cnf? I got a warning that fmtutil-local.cnf was found but
according to install.log it seems that in such a case fmtutil.cnf is
ignored. I wanted to keep it just for the case that for some reason I would
like to rebuild formats in one of the previous TeX Live versions.

Message-ID: <552FB6B5.6000109@gmail.com>

The problem reported with Thai patterns, as well as the Korean problem 
mentioned by Dohyun Kim (incorrect \showthe output from a token list 
that should contain a couple of Korean characters), turns out to be a 
symptom of an input-processing bug.

This is a critical issue inasmuch as it can result in silently 
discarding certain characters from the user's input, with no indication 
that typesetting has failed in any way.

Any Unicode character whose low byte is 0x20 or 0x09 could be affected.

The problem arises from the (unsigned char) typecasts added in TL 
revision 34284:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/kpathsea/c-ctype.h?r1=34283&r2=34284&

Combined with the "fake" isascii() definition found at:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/kpathsea/c-ctype.h?annotate=34284#l27

which will override the system-defined isascii() if it is a function 
rather than a macro, this makes ISBLANK(c) return true for any UTF-16 
codepoint with 0x09 or 0x20 in the lower byte, regardless of its upper 
byte. This means that the code to "trim trailing whitespace" at:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/web2c/xetexdir/XeTeX_ext.c?annotate=36591#l454

will also "trim" various other non-whitespace characters, such as 
Latin-script ? and ?, Cyrillic ? and ?, Devanagari ?, Thai ? and many more.

One workaround would be to replace the use of ISBLANK there with an 
explicit test for the specific characters 0x09 and 0x20; but in case 
there are other ISBLANK uses, I think it would be better to fix 
kpathsea/c-ctype.h.

If we really need to provide the isascii(c) macro here (I don't know 
what other platforms/programs might break if we removed it), then I 
propose making it at least somewhat more likely to be correct:

- #define isascii(c) 1
+ #define isascii(c) ((c) >= 0 && (c) <= 0x7f)

This will protect ISBLANK from passing non-ASCII values through to 
isblank, and fixes the broken behavior in XeTeX.

(I don't have an SVN checkout set up for committing changes at the 
moment, so I'm cc'ing Khaled and Peter here, and hope one of you can 
take care of this promptly. Thanks!)

Hi all,

sorry for this message, fmtutil failed only on one of my computers because
I forgot to copy the new fmtutil.cnf to it. If the directory contains both,
I get the warning but the new fmtutil.cnf is found and used. I have just
succesfully recompiled an old book with TL 2015.

Sorry I was offline for the past few days and could not send the
official "pretest starting" announcement.  I'm glad people have been
going ahead with the testing nevertheless.

I expect to be catching up with the needed commits and any needed
replies over the next couple days.

Happy testing,

Hi Werner,

    - texk/dvi2tty/dvi2tty-5.3.4/Changelog

Both Svante and Marcel explicitly agreed to the full GPL here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=424018

Therefore that statement in the ChangeLog is obsolete (and never applied
to the C program anyway).  I'll remove it.

However, likely you may wish to exclude it from suse anyway, for the
same reasons that Debian did, if you read to the end of that lengthy
ticket.  I disagree with their conclusion and am therefore keeping the
program in TL.  I also don't want to debate it :).

Werner,

    - texk/dvipsk/contrib/PSTricks

That file isn't a problem, it's just an ancient copy of the PSTricks
readme.  I'll remove it.  pstricks itself was sorted out long ago, as
far as I know.

    - texk/dvipsk/special.lpro
    - texk/xdvik/psheader.txt

I removed the psfig definitions from those files (in the Build tree).
As far as I can see, there should be no adverse effects.  (Paul V., hope
you agree and install the same change in your upstream.)

I'll update the TL runtime (Master/ tree) with these and other changes
soon.

Best,
Karl

Hi Karl, Jonathan, Khaled,

this should really be fixed.  I have added  a test if iscascii is either
defined as macro or declared as function (or both) and only otherwise
   #define isascii(c) (((c) & ~0x7f) == 0)
(stolen from GNU libc).

Unfortunately this implies modifications in binaries for systems where
isascii is not defined as macro (supposedly Darwin and perhaps others).

Peter

Thanks, Peter; that looks like it'll work fine (I haven't tested 
locally, but the xelatex Thai-patterns issue should soon reveal whether 
it's behaving as it should).

One note: as far as I'm aware, the line

   #if !(defined(HAVE_DECL_ISASCII) && HAVE_DECL_ISASCII)

is unnecessarily complex (which hurts readability); it should be 
sufficient to write

   #if !HAVE_DECL_ISASCII

because the preprocessor treats undefined symbols as 0 when evaluating 
#if conditions.

(Or are there ancient, non-standards-compliant systems where this fails?)

Hi Jonathan,

yes, I know.  I just wanted to be on the safe side.

I have just compiled for Darwin where HAVE_DECL_ISASCII is now defined as 1!

x86_64 seems to be OK, I have not tried Raspberry Pi, will try tonight.
However, it seems that rebuild of XeTeX will be needed due to beginL/endL

As far as I know only darwin (certainly not linux, cygwin, and mingw).
For others one might test if <ctype.h> defines isascii as macro and rebuild
otherwise.

Subject: [tex-live]  isascii() comment
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1429283613.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

List traffic this week has discussed the use of isascii() in some
parts of TeX Live.

I just made experiments on about 40 flavors of Unix to see how it is
implemented, and found that on about half of the systems, it is an
external function, and on the others, expands to (equivalent) code
like one of these:

	return ((((c) & ~0x7f) == 0));
	
	return (((unsigned)(c) <= 0177));

	return (((unsigned)(c) < 0x80));

Both macro and function implementations are often found on the same
platform, with cc using the macro form, and c89 and c99 using the
function form.

POSIX documents isascii() as a function, whereas ISO C 89, 99, and
2011 have no mention of it whatever.

Subject: [tex-live] Default local disk repository seems to be wrong after
	install-tl from rsync'ed mirror
Message-ID: <140418FF-638C-43A0-8B75-6453E7E7F145@free.fr>

Hi,

after rsyncing from a TL2015 pretest mirror to my hard disk,
and running install-tl, the default repository location seems
to be wrong:

ttys000:~ (18:48)$ tlmgr update --list --all
tlmgr: package repository /Users/---/Downloads/TL2015
tlmgr: saving backups to /Users/---/Downloads/TL2015/tlpkg/backups
tlmgr: no updates available
tlmgr: Your installation is set up to look on the disk for updates.
To install from the Internet for this one time only, run:
  tlmgr -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet ACTION ARG...
where ACTION is install, update, etc.; see tlmgr -help if needed.

To change the default for all future updates, run:
  tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

I needed to do

ttys000:~ (18:48)$ tlmgr option repository ~/Downloads/tlpretest

and then it worked as expected
ttys000:~ (18:50)$ tlmgr update --list --all
tlmgr: package repository /Users/---/Downloads/tlpretest
tlmgr: saving backups to /Users/---/Downloads/TL2015/tlpkg/backups
update:   handout            [191k]: local:    36867, source:    36877

Notice that I had updated once successfully yesterday with TLU 
from the distant server via http,
but had not tried until now direct tlmgr use from my local copy of
the TL2015 pretest mirror (after rsyncing to make it up-to-date).

I followed these steps when first installing. This was before the
binaries, particularly xetex, had been updated, hence creation of
format files had no problem back then on Mac OS X (Darwin)

rsync -a  --delete --exclude="mactex*" -- ctan.ijs.si::mirror/tlpretest/ ~/Downloads/tlpretest/

cd ~/Downloads/tlpretest

./install-tl -repository .

Hi

Just to report that today's update (April 18, Europe) has
fixed the problem with the x86_64-darwin binary for xetex
which was discussed (at top level) in the Duplicate Thai 
patterns thread.

I just got a bit confused because the version number of 
xetex remained exactly the same

This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99992 (TeX Live 2015) 

thus I checked the logs to be sure  that the successful 
qeneration of xetex.fmt and xelatex.fmt was not to be explained 
by an hypothetical  temporary removal of the Thai hyphenation
rules. 

Thanks,

Jean-Fran?ois

ah sorry, I tried to follow but I had obviously not fully 
integrated the discussion in

[tex-live] Critical bugfix needed for XeTeX [was: Re: Fwd: Duplicate Thai patterns reported by XeTeX in TL 2015 pretest]

from a message by Jonathan Kew I think I understand
that a work-around has been found in the kpathsea
library, something was changed in

> kpathsea/c-ctype.h.

but the xetex code itself has not been changed (that's
what I understand, I may be wrong)

I did not quite get if the change in kpathsea/c-ctype.h
was only a work-around or the complete fix to the problem,
due to my ignorance,

Message-ID: <CAC1phyY4Gcp=sa7G4FN1Fr9Tj8cc=jZ7y2S7QjWfe-z4_mwqzA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have just rsync'ed installed TeX Live from x86_64 to Raspberry Pi and ran
fmtutil-sys -all in order to see whether it builds the formats. It ends
with:

cannot remove path when cwd is /tmp/Mp1Dlms0LS for /tmp/Mp1Dlms0LS:  at
/usr/share/perl/5.14/File/Temp.pm line 902

It seems harmless but it also says:

fmtutil [INFO]: /usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/lollipop.fmt
installed.
fmtutil [WARNING]: inifile cslatex-utf8.ini for pdfcslatex/pdftex not found.
fmtutil [WARNING]: inifile cslatex-utf8.ini for cslatex/pdftex not found.
fmtutil [INFO]: Disabled formats: 10
fmtutil [INFO]: Successfully rebuild formats: 44
fmtutil [INFO]: Failure during builds: 2

I hope that these 2 failures refer to those 2 waning. I will examine
cslatex-utf8.ini issue. It is not a problem in TeX Live, it certainly comes
from my local fmtutil.cnf. I know that Petr Ol??k made changes to CSTeX a
long time ago but old configuration might have survived in my Raspberry.

sorry for the (iterated) noise, I understand now this 
was really a fix to a problem from kpathsea,

it was all very clear in Jonathan's message to the list
with Subject 

Critical bugfix needed for XeTeX [was: Re: Fwd: Duplicate Thai patterns reported by XeTeX in TL 2015 pretest]

but somehow I had not read this as "critical bugfix in kpathsea 
is needed to avoid breaking XeTeX" ...

cheers,

Hi all,

examining my old installations I have found that cslatex-utf8.ini
disappeared from from TeX Live in 2012. I do not remember when I actually
used cslatex the last time, maybe in 2008. Maybe I was the unly person who
ever used this file. Unless anyone else complains, nothing needs to be done.

Message-ID: <20150418133532.Y_rSXtkd%tex_live@mmmmarascio.xyz>

Hello.  tlmgr from a TeX Live pretest installation seems to not work in user mode.  It won't create the user tree, e.g.,

$ tlmgr init-usertree
tlmgr: unknown action: init-usertree; try --help if you need it.

# TEXMFHOME=$HOME/.texlive/texmf
$ cd ~/.texlive && mkdir texmf && tlmgr init-usertree
tlmgr: unknown action: init-usertree; try --help if you need it.

Nor will tlmgr install into the user tree that it fails to create:

$ tlmgr --usermode install librarian
cannot setup TLPDB in /home/mmmm/.texlive/texmf at /usr/local/bin/tlmgr line 5330.

>From `tlmgr conf`: tlmgr revision 36854 (2015-04-14 14:08:59 +0200).  I obtained the pretest source from <http://mirror.hmc.edu/tlpretest>.
My operating system is Arch GNU/Linux.

$ uname --all

I can't think of other information that may be useful for investigating this matter.  But I'll gladly follow direction to provide anything else that may be relevant.  Thank you for any help!

Ah, that helps ...

Can you please apply this simple patch, add one line, and see if that
makes the error go away?

I am corresponding with Petr Ol??k off the list. If he decides it is a bug,
he will fix it in CSTeX, otherwise we will consider it a bug in my local
fmtutil.cnf (and this is more probable).

    I just got a bit confused because the version number of 
    xetex remained exactly the same

In general, the version numbers do not change during the pretest (or for
the final build), even while the sources are changing.  This is
obviously undesirable, but fixing it is not easy.  Maybe next year.

Folks,

I have MacTeX-2015 here, waiting until TeX Live binaries and Ghostscript became
stable. Everything is now in place to create the test version tomorrow
morning. After that, it should appear in the mirror sites within a day.

Hi all, I'm working on an update of script "ltximg" which works correctly on linux and windows, but does not work properly when replacing the version that brings in texlive 2015 (pretest ) for testing, causes conflict to make a system call "pdfcrop" . I can skip this problem somehow ?
This is the version in which I work for now.

Subject: [tex-live] Two problems solved (but it may be useful to report them
	anyway)
Message-ID: <1429566885466.87919@uark.edu>


TeX Live pretesters:

I just recently installed the texlive2015 pretest. I ran into only
two problems and those have been resolved, but I thought there might
be others who find themselves in my peculiar position who could 
benefit from hearing this story.

The first problem can arise if you are a windows user, with 
Take Command version 17 installed and?you run install-tl-wibdows.bat 
from a?TCC command shell. I did this and immediately received the 
message 
Cancel batch job C:\tl\install-tl-20150414\install-tl-windows.bat ? (Y/N/A) :

I traced this to the fragment "%path:~0,1" on line 24, and determined 
this to be a?bug in version 17 of Take Command because I updated?it 
to the slightly more recent?version (17.00.77) and the problem went away.

So if you are?a user of TCC, with?an early build?of version 17 
installed, then either update Take Command or run the install-tl 
batch file in a cmd.exe shell. (You can also run an earlier TCC: 
version 16 works OK.)

The second problem was that my texmf-local/web2c/ contained 
fmtutil-local.cnf and I got the message that I should probably 
rename it to fmtutil.cnf. I did that, but my 15 supposedly 
disabled formats were?generated anyway. In the?output of 
fmtutil --help one finds one has to use 
"? #! <fmtname> <enginename> <hyphen> <args>" 
to disable a format. 

It turns out that one has to?ignore the first two spaces in that 
line, but the space after #! is not optional. I didn't?test whether 
the other spaces?and arguments had to literally match what 
was in the Tex Live-supplied fmtutil.cnf, but simply  
copy/pasted them, prefixing "#! ", and all was well.

The first two spaces are just the formatting of the output, and should
not be considered part of the line, as you deduced.

After that spaces are necessary to separate the entries, but how many
is irrelevant. Actually only fmtname and enginename is necessary.

That is the idea.

Message-ID: <C78CDB0B-A118-4FB1-B526-BF86E0A9C04A@mac.com>

Hi, all,

I installed the MacTex-2015 package for the OS X (10.6.8) and then ran the TeX Live Utility to get updates.  I was informed, politely, that I had to install updates for "critical infrastructure".  After complete, I got an alert saying that after the update, the new and old versions had the same version number, and that if this persisted, I should wait until TeX-Live corrects the problem.

I quit and relaunched TLU, and this time, got a list of updates, which TLU proceeded to download.

I did not see this mentioned in earlier discussions, and I'm not sure that it matters, but am reporting to for "completeness".

Thanks as always for the hard work to keep TeX moving!

Message-ID: <019801d07bdb$87d23920$9776ab60$@gmail.com>

Hello,

 

In TeX Live, it seems that the "Abort typesetting" button of TeXworks cannot
stop a XeLaTeX typesetting.

In TeX Live 2014 it just stops xelatex.exe but leaves another process
xetex.exe running.

In TL 2015 the GUI gets dead when we press the button.

Any solution to this problem?

 

Best,

Okay, between this and the reports on the mactex list,
I?ll download it and try. What pretest mirror were you

Howdy,

I wonder if the problem is in xetex. I process

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setsansfont{Helvetica}
\begin{document}
Hello World!
\end{document}

with `xelatex -no-pdf` and get the following error:

\g__file_internal_ior=\read1

! Missing = inserted for \ifnum.
<to be read again> 
                   \l_fontspec_font 
l.5 \setsansfont{Helvetica}

so, possibly something isn't being set correctly in xetex itself. (I've already let Will Robertson, maintainer of fontspec, know about this.)
                           
Good Luck,

Some of you noticed that www.math.utah.edu was down for part of Monday.
Here is the explanation:

    There was a scheduled lower-campus-wide electrical outage from 5am
    to 5:30am MST Monday 20-Apr-2015.  Normally, thanks to machine room
    backup power, this should not impact central computer
    services. Unfortunately, this time it did, taking out all power to
    the backup power system, and then the entire machine room.  All
    computers, and network switches, ceased to function.

    When power was restored, we found considerable damage from
    corruption of the central network switch, to several machines that
    would not power on, or it they did, would not reboot. One desktop
    machine (NHFB's) had its video card destroyed, and another lost
    chunks of its memory.  As a result, although we got some services
    restored by late morning, it was not until about 5pm that we got
    all of the machines back up again.

Monday was thus a washout here, sigh...

Message-ID: <4CE87EB3-5106-4056-B1F8-EDE6EA6495A8@icloud.com>

Folks,

This list already has hints from Herbert Schulz of additional XeTeX problems
on the Mac in TeXLive 2015, independent of the bug, now fixed, in xdvipdfmx. 
The purpose of this message is to confirm the bug. 

MacTeX contains two
short documents, with source, to show users what XeTeX can do. Neither
typesets in XeTeX for 2015. Example:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{geometry} 
\geometry{letterpaper}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra,xunicode}
\defaultfontfeatures{Mapping=tex-text}
\setromanfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Hoefler Text}
\setsansfont[Scale=MatchLowercase,Mapping=tex-text]{Gill Sans}
\setmonofont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{Andale Mono}

\begin{document}

\newfontfamily{\A}{Geeza Pro}
\newfontfamily{\H}[Scale=0.9]{Lucida Grande}
\newfontfamily{\J}[Scale=0.85]{Osaka}

Here are some multilingual Unicode fonts: this is Arabic text: {\A ?????? ?????}, 
this is Hebrew: {\H ????}, and here's some Japanese: {\J ???}.

\end{document}  


By commenting out font commands, one can see that every font command
except one leads to the same error:

Missing = inserted for \ifnum
<to be read again>
	\l_fontspec_font
1.39 \newfontfamily{\H}[Scale=0.9]{Lucida Grande}

The font command which works is the line about Gill Sans.

Can you replicate this, Richard, eliminating LaTeX and its packages from
the equation ?  At the moment, your report seems to finger LaTeX or one
of its packages rather than XeTeX /qua/ XeTeX :

>> Missing = inserted for \ifnum
>> <to be read again>

This is certainly not a bug in xdvipdfmx, it is reported during macro
expansion. As Phil suggests, make the sample as simple as possible. Remove
all packages except fontspec and try with one font only. Make sure that you
really have these fonts. And limit the number of fonts per each test file
at the very minimum otherwise no one will be able to tell you where the
source of the error is and why.

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra,xunicode}
\setromanfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Hoefler Text}

\begin{document}

This gives the standard error reported earlier on ?setromanfont?.

Howdy,

And even shorter:

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setromanfont{Hoefler Text}
\begin{document}
Hello.
\end{document}  

PS: Hoefler Text is a .ttc font.

I attempted to replicate that in Plain XeTeX :

\font \romanfont = "Hoefler Text"
\romanfont
Hello.
\end

but do not have a font called "Hoefler Text"; can you come up with an
analogous example that fails when using a font that a normal Windows
user is likely to have ("Calibri", for example) ?

Folks,

In the message title for several earlier messages today, I confused XeTeX with TeTeX. Gulp.

After the final message, I got a message from Khaled Hosny saying that he had
fixed the problem. Just now, I compiled all the sources again, and tested
my two documents. Sure enough, most problems are fixed. THANKS, KHALED.

However ?

There is a final problem. Here again is the source:

????????????
%!TEX TS-program = xelatex
%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{geometry} 
\geometry{letterpaper}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\usepackage{fontspec,xltxtra,xunicode}
\defaultfontfeatures{Mapping=tex-text}
\setromanfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Hoefler Text}
\setsansfont[Scale=MatchLowercase,Mapping=tex-text]{Gill Sans}
\setmonofont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{Andale Mono}

\title{Brief Article}
\author{The Author}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This is a standard TeX document using Hoefler Text. It uses \LaTeX\ and
the standard \TeX\ graphic packages.

Here are some multilingual Unicode fonts: this is Arabic text: {\A ?????? ?????}, 
this is Hebrew: {\H ????},  and here's some Japanese: {\J ???}.

\end{document}  

??????????????

If the line near the bottom defining font ?J? to be Osaka is commented out,
and the corresponding Japanese text at the end is commented out, this typesets
fine. If we add back the line defining the ?J? font, but not the Japanese text,
typesetting is still fine. Adding the final line with Japanese text leads to the
message

I don?t know if this is normal. But in the end, xdvipdfmx cannot use the
font.

A shorter version that reproduces the issue:

\font\helv="Helvetica"
\ifnum\XeTeXcountvariations\helv>0\fi
\bye

Should be fixed in TL SVN tree.

This seems like a CID font issue in dvipdfmx, which I know near nothing about. A reduced test file:
\font\test="Osaka"\test ???\bye

Folks,

In the meantime, Herbert Schulz has been plowing through other
Mac fonts and has found one more problem .ttf font: Apple
Chancery. Same 

	\font\testit="Apple Chancery" \testit ABC

problem, producing :xdvipdfmx: fatal: Invalid font: -1 (1)

Folks,

You folks have the hard task of trying to fix XeTeX problems, while Herb and I have the
easy job of just testing fonts. It has occurred to us that a systematic test of Mac fonts
would be helpful, since XeTeX font problems occur mostly on the Mac. Enclosed is a sample
test of all the fonts on the Mac with names beginning with the letter A. All work in XeTeX.
By tomorrow morning, we should have a complete list of any standard Mac fonts which
cause problems in XeTeX.

Thanks very much for working on this issue.

Dick Koch

How do I build XeTeX and dvipdfmx out of TeXLive svn tree on Mac these days?

configure --disable-all-pkgs --enable-dvipdfm-x --enable-xetex
--without-x -C CFLAGS=-g CXXFLAGS=-g

builds dvipdfmx but not xetex, there is even no xetex target so
something must have gone wrong during the configure process. If I
don't add --without-x I will reach some X not found for MetaFont
error. (why do we even need that?)

  Under X systems, Metafont displays by default a window with the glyphs
of the font being compiled, that would be why you need X for a full
installation.  There is an executable called mf-nowin that does not open
the X window.

  Sorry I can't be more help with your main problem, I haven't been very
up-to-date with TeX on the Mac lately.

	Best,

Phew! Glad to hear that (for once) it?s not fontspec that is broken!
(Knocks on wood. I?m sure there are other problems lurking and I have quite a number of open issues on Github to address.)

The above test does not seem to work for XeTeX in TeX Live 2014.  For
the following (complete) test file :

\ifnum\XeTeXcountvariations\font>0\fi\bye
abcd
\end

no output is produced.  I would expect "abcd" to be typeset.

Why would you expect that? \bye will end the job, before you get to "abcd".

Because \XeTeXcountvariations should return 0 for XeTeX's default font,
should it not ?

Well, I have now worked through my entire collection of.ttc fonts, and
cannot find one that returns > 0 for \XeTeXcountvariations.  Can anyone
let me have a copy of such a font (installable under Windows, of course)
so that I can experience at first hand the problem(s) that such fonts
can cause ?

Phil, please reread the code... there is a

  Isn't there ;-)

  Just to double-up (or rather triple-up) on Jonathan's and Norbert's
messages: the code is *expected* to close the TeX file without reaching
the bit of text on the second line, thus producing empty output.

Folks,

I have completed testing all OS X fonts in Yosemite. I never buy additional
fonts and seldom install other programs, so my testbed is pretty close to
the fonts which Apple supplies.

Here are XeTeX source files for the complete test. When a font is commented
out, it did not typeset. Later this morning, we will give more information about
these problem fonts. A few failed to typeset in XeTeX, but the usual problem was
a failure in xdvipdfmx.

Folks,

Here is detailed information on the console output when fonts failed. Two
fonts on my list are actually OK: Ayuthaya and Mangla Singham MN (the
first two). Bad spellings in my source code. Here is new source code for
part 1 of the test:

The font type information above comes from Herbert Schulz, who reports that XeTeX has always had problems
with Skia. The problem with Kohinoor Devanagari was reported also under TL 2014.

I will eventually repeat these tests under TeX Live 2014 and report back. But perhaps this is the
important information for dividing up the task of debugging and fixing (when possible).

This name would be acceptable in raw XeTeX, as :

	\font \whatever = "GB18030 Bitmap"

I have no knowledge of the LaTeX interface to platform fonts, but it
might be worth adding the additional string quotes to see if that can
help here.

The ones with "Invalid fontname" are likely to be bitmap fonts that
XeTeX rejects them (it is certainly the case for the first and the last
ones), this is not new. The rest seems to be xdvipdfmx regressions
caused by the move away from using FreeType, but probably are old
dvipdfmx bugs that were not exposed to XeTeX users before.

Khaled

No idea, I just build the whole thing, but probably you can just copy
the build.sh script for XeTeX repo and use it.

Yes, I posted a correction to my earlier message as soon as I realised
this.  But as a result, I do not understand the purpose of Khaled's code :

	\ifnum\XeTeXcountvariations\font>0\fi\bye

Regardless of whether or not the \ifnum succeeds, the action would seem
to be the same (\bye); as I have no .ttc fonts for which :

	\ifnum \XeTeXcountvariations \font > 0

yields <true>, I cannot actually test the hypothesis that the behaviour
is identical regardless of whether \XeTeXcountvariations \font returns
zero or greater than zero, but would I be correct in thinking that
although the code /should/ behave identically, in practice it does not
and therefore there is an actual bug in XeTeX ?

There is a \bye at the end of the first line.

Folks,

I have now typeset the test files in TeX Live 2014. All fonts that work today
also worked in 2014. The full list of bad files for 2015 is given below. Either the error
messages were the same in 2014 and 2015 or else the font worked in 2014

These fonts that worked in 2014 but don?t now are particularly important,
of course. But notice that we also have recent error messages from 2014

The bug that is being fixed here caused \XeTeXcountvariations to not
?consume? its argument (or what ever it is called, it just didn?t take
any arguments), so the \font was lingering there confusing \ifnum, which
caused the rather misleading error message. If the code runs without
error, then all is fine as far as this bug is concerned.

Font variations is a feature of Apple?s AAT[1], and there is actually only
a single publicly available font which has them[2] AFAIK. Anyway, XeTeX
in TL 2015 dropped support for font variation entirely as xdvipdfmx does
not support them, so \XeTeXcountvariations always returns 0 now.

The message is misleading, what happens is that XeTeX finds that it is a
bitmap-only font and refuses to load it. Fonts not loaded in the first
pass goes through a fallback mechanism that try to load them the old way
as TFM fonts, which gives this kpathsea message.

Subject: [tex-live] Basic questions for MacTeX installation on a MacBook Air.
Message-ID: <20150424174805.GW30725@engels.historicalmaterialism.info>

I know nothing of Mac machines, but gave my wife a MacBook Air. She just
finished a term paper using Page, and that application was such a
disappointment that I'm moving her over to TeXMac. I've been using
AUCTeX with LaTeX on a Linux/debian machine for some years.

I'm having a problem installing MacTeX on her machine, probably because
I'm so ignorant about the Mac. I went to the TUG/MacTeX website and
downloaded the MacTeX package to her machine. This is where I ran into
trouble. The download never seems to complete. I assume that the 2.5
Gb file named MacTex.pkg.download is the equivalent on my machine of
MacTex.pkg.part and indicates a download in process.

Initially my wife's machine said it would take 30 hours to download, and
its now been over 24 hours. These are obviously wrong times even for a
2.5 Gb file. I downloaded the same file to my own machine on the same
network without a problem. Rather than report diminishing hours to go,
it just stopped reporting anything.

My first question is whether I'm correct to assume that the download
hung because the .download extension should have disappeared upon
completion. Does its presence mean the download failed? I just
started another download, but with the second one there is no indication
at all of the hours to go. 

I don't know how to access a terminal and if I can issue a command from
it to list files with their sizes to see the progress of a download.  I
know there is an internet connection. On a MacBook is the download
suspended if you close the lid for a sleep?

Where should the MacTex.pkg file be placed? I assume that it should be
moved out of the Download folder, but to where? One reason I ask is
because it is beginning to look like I'll have to put the file on a key
and copy it over to my wife's machine from the key. Does the MacTeX
installation program require the .pkg file to be in the Downloads
folder?

Hello list,

The following is largely superfluous given Dick's latest messages, but here it is anyway.

These are two files testing all the fonts in OS X, written originally in 2013 for OS X 10.8, at the time Khaled was partially rewriting XeTeX and we were testing it against all OS X fonts on the MacTeX list (and comparing with LuaTeX output for good measure).

I adapted the files last year to OS X 10.9, and just adapted it today to 10.10. The result runs fine with XeTeX and LuaTeX in TeX Live 2014. It doesn't with XeTeX in TeX Live 2015 (even a simple call of "Times Roman" in plain TeX yields  "sfnt: table not found").

The problematic fonts with TeX Live 2014 are


Blank output
============

Apple Color Emoji	(also with LuaTeX)
GB18030 Bitmap		(also with LuaTeX)
Hannotate TC		(also with LuaTeX)
HanziPen TC		(also with LuaTeX)

-> kpathsea:make_tex: Invalid fontname `Apple Color Emoji', contains ' '


Crash
=====

Hannotate SC		(blank output no crash in LuaTeX)
HanziPen SC		(blank output no crash in LuaTeX)
ITF Devanagari		(also with LuaTeX)
Kohinoor Devanagari	(also with LuaTeX)

-> xdvipdfmx:fatal: sfnt: table not found...

Yuppy SC		(also with LuaTeX)
Yuppy TC		(also with LuaTeX)

-> xdvipdfmx:fatal: CFF: Parsing CFF DICT failed. (error=-1) 


So this is fully consistent with Dick's latest message.

For comparison purposes, the PDF output on my setup is at (17 MB)

Probably. Even though (depending on the browser and the server) you
might be able to resume the download.

You could also download a torrent file
(https://tug.org/mactex/MacTeX.pkg.torrent) if enough people are still
sharing it. Transmission is a nice torrent client that also
automatically checks if the download is complete and uncorrupted.

But if you already have the file on linux, just copy it over to the
Mac. (On our network downloading MacTeX from the server is usually
faster than using an USB stick though ;)

There is /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app. You can browse to it
with Finder or use four-finger gesture to show you all apps.

Yes (or at least I would expect it to be). Whether or not you can
continue probably depends on the software and the server from where
you are fetching the file.

Anywhere. Just double-click it and it should start the installation.

I cannot say anything about fonts, but the code

   \ifnum\XeTeXcountvariations\font>0\fi\bye

gets the syntax of conditionals wrong, as the \fi ends the conditional
before \bye, so \bye is run in all cases.  The correct approach is

   \ifnum\XeTeXcountvariations\font>0 \expandafter\bye\fi

or something similar.

Bruno

Hi Richard,

Do you mind testing with these fonts again? Most of the Mac TrueType
fonts support should be fixed by r37043.

According to my test, at least the following fonts are working now:

Apple Chancery
HeadLineA
Osaka
PCMyungjo
PilGi
Skia

I still need to look into rest of the fonts, I suspect that there can
be problems supporting TrueType Collection fonts.

Khaled,

You wrote 

The ones with "Invalid fontname" are likely to be bitmap fonts that
XeTeX rejects them (it is certainly the case for the first and the last
ones), this is not new. The rest seems to be xdvipdfmx regressions
caused by the move away from using FreeType, but probably are old
dvipdfmx bugs that were not exposed to XeTeX users before.


This explanation is certainly true of GB18030Bitmap, which is described by the Mac
as type ?bitmap?. However, the error message from kpathsea about invalid fontnames
also is the cause of failure of the following fonts on our list, which are listed below
together with the ?type? of font from the Mac info about them:

Hannotate TC
Opentype Postscript

HanziPen TC
Opentype Postscript

Apple Color Emoji
Truetype

(The last font is the least important of the fonts on our non-working list.)

These two failed because in our current code we don't support CFF font
(CID Type 0) wrapped in TrueType Collection format, we only supported
CFF font in OTF format. I don't know if it worked with FreeType
before.

I will give it a try to fix it, dunno how difficult it can be though.

Jiang Jiang,

I recompiled and tested. Great work!

I download source using rsync. I suspect I got 37043, but not 37046,
because in my tests, YuppySC and YuppTC are still broken. I?ll download
and test again this evening.

However, the following fonts are fixed:

	Apple Chancery
	Headline A
	Osaka
	PCMyungio
	PilGi	
	Skia

These are exactly the fonts which worked in 2014 but didn?t work this
year. They concerned me the most, and it is wonderful to see them
fixed.

I believe the following are still broken

	(Yuppy SC) - maybe fixed now
	(Yuppy TC) - maybe fixed now
	Apple Color Emoji
	GB10830 Bitmap - (bitmap font, so maybe not fixable)
	Hannotate SC
	Hannotate TC
	Hansipen SC
	Hansipen TC
	ITF Devanagari
	Kohinoor Devanagari

Several of these have errors in the typesetting before even reaching
xdvipdfmx, as listed in an earlier message. 

I think the last six are the important ones. In particular, we already
have bug reports from last year on the last two. Jiang Jiang is well aware
of this, knows the reason. A fix may not be easy.

Great work, everyone!

Those two are CFF-TTC fonts, I don?t think they worked before, but they
are breaking for me in xdvipdfmx not XeTeX, so a different issue than
the ?kpathsea? one.

> Truetype

This is a bitmap-only font as well, it is just that the bitmaps are
colored.

Khaled,

On behalf of all Macintosh users, thanks for tremendous support the last couple of years.
Before you started, XeTeX was using a deprecated font library on the Mac, and Apple
was threatening to remove it any day. We were scared. Then you appeared, replaced
the Library by a supported one, and made other magical changes I don?t understand but
constantly use. Now XeTeX feels save again. 

I hope to meet you in person some day so I can say face to face just what your
work has meant for us.

Thanks!

Dick Koch

Hi Khaled,
it's a pity that you can't maintain these programs anymore.  I'm
deeply grateful for everything you did.

When I heard that TUG-2011 was supposed to take place in Cairo I had
been very glad to have the opportunity to meet you in person.  It's a
pity that TUG-2011 couldn't take place in Egypt.

I'm looking forward to meet you at a TeX conference in the near
future.  BTW, my favourite is BachoTeX in Poland.

Thanks again,
  Reinhard

Jiang Jiang,

FANTASTIC NEWS.

I?ll compile in an hour or two and test.

In the meantime, I want to declare that as far as I am concerned, the font
situation on the Mac after this fix is completely satisfactory, and you can
relax and Karl can release when he?s ready.

We truly appreciate the work you and Khaled did for us. There is some 
concern that our demands pushed Khaled over the edge; now we 
don?t want to do that to you.

Go to a movie, or buy a beer, or whatever, and send the bill to me.
And Khaled, you can do the same.

r37054 fixed (well, it's more like added) support for these fonts, so
I guess this concludes what we want to fix for TL'15. The remaining
ones are bitmap fonts which I'm not sure we want to support.

The only regression I'm aware of so far is the Mac suitcase files
support, that's unfortunate but I don't think I can bring it back (or
like to spend too much time with it unless there is a critical one I
want to get working) without significant effort, so probably we should
list it as known issue so that people who absolutely need this can
avoid stepping into the problem.

No problem, I don't mind fixing these at all, it's actually a nice
break for me during the weekend. Let me know if you notice any
regressions, since I can't promise what I can done so far don't have
any side effect or bug.

Folks,

Amazingly, the full story for XeTeX and Mac fonts is as follows:

	a) The following fonts were fixed and now work

	HeadlineA
	Hannotate SC
	HanziPen SC
	ITF Devanagari
	Kohinoor Devanagari
	Osaka
	PCMyungio
	PilGi
	Skia
	Yuppy SC
	Yuppy TC
	Apple Chancery

	b) The following fonts are broken, but Khaled reports
	that they are all bitmapped fonts; each produces the same
	error in the log, which does not involve xdvipdfm-x. 

	GB18030 Bitmap
	Hannotate TC
	HanziPen TC
	Apple Color Emoji

Note that Hannotate TC and HanziPen TC are broken, but
Hannotate SC and HanziPen SC work.

I declare complete success, and now I?m going to rebuild the binaries
on all Mac platforms so we can get these fixes in the tlpretest packages
for Mac.

Hannotate and HanziPen aren't bitmap fonts, they are OpenType
PostScript fonts wrapped in TrueType Collection format. I can confirm
that we can't use these yet, but the problem is most likely not in
xdvipdfmx but in XeTeX's font lookup code. I will look into this.

Hi Werner,

Do you aware of any problem with FreeType's TTC support in regards to
Hannotate.ttc and HanziPen.ttc added in OS X 10.9?

XeTeX has the following code:

error = FT_New_Face(gFreeTypeLibrary, (char *) pathname, 0, &face);
if (!error) {
    if (face->num_faces > 1) {
        int num_faces = face->num_faces;
        char *ps_name1 = getNameFromCTFont(ctFontRef, kCTFontPostScriptNameKey);
        int i;
        *index = -1;
        FT_Done_Face (face);
        for (i = 0; i < num_faces; i++) {
            error = FT_New_Face (gFreeTypeLibrary, (char *) pathname, i, &face);
            if (!error) {
                const char *ps_name2 = FT_Get_Postscript_Name(face);
                if (strcmp(ps_name1, ps_name2) == 0) {
                    *index = i;
                    break;
                }
                FT_Done_Face (face);
            }
        }
        free(ps_name1);
    }
}

to read a font from ttc and find out the index, for HanziPen.ttc for
instance there should be 4 faces, which face->num_faces reported
correctly. However, FT_Get_Postscript_Name() returned: HanziPenSC-W3,
HanziPenSC-W3, HanziPenSC-W5, HanziPenSC-W5 for these 4 faces, while
the correct ones should be: HanziPenSC-W3, HanziPenTC-W3,
HanziPenSC-W5, HanziPenTC-W5.

Jiang Jiang,

Unfortunately, here is a piece of bad news.

For rapid turnaround, I compile TeX Live on system 10.10, Yosemite.
However, the release version of TeX Live for Mac is compiled
on Leopard for PPC and Intel 32 bits, and on Snow Leopard
for Intel 64 bits.

All three of these compiles went through smoothly, but did not pass
dvipdfm-x tests. Here are the test logs. To be more precise, the dvipdfm-x
logs were OK, but one log on each machine for xdvipdfm-x was bad.
I believe all three files are essentially the same.

First on Leopard PPC:

All of these were compiled AFTER my previous Yosemite success, after upgrading
various source directories with rsync, so I assume the sources were up to
date.

pretest binaries)

If so, you can send me the xdv file generated, I will see if I can
reproduce that.

Looks like that's because for CFF fonts, we use the CFFFontName stored
in 'CFF ' table as the PostScript name instead of using the 'name'
table.

Unfortunately for these two fonts, the CFFFontName in 'CFF ' aren't
always correct for the TC variants.

I'm not sure if there is anything we can do here. Force getting
PostScript name from 'name' table?

Given that the CFF table can be shared between multiple fonts in the
collection, I think the answer is yes. IIRC, OpenType spec used to say
that both names must match, but that requirement was dropped in the
latest version for this reason.

Yeah, it's possible to do something like this as a fallback in XeTeX
font matching:

FT_ULong count = FT_Get_Sfnt_Name_Count(face);
for (FT_UInt j = 0; j < count; j++) {
    FT_SfntName sfnt_name;
    error = FT_Get_Sfnt_Name(face, j, &sfnt_name);
    if (!error && sfnt_name->name_id == 6) {
        char name_str[1024];
        memcpy(name_str, sfnt_name.string, sfnt_name.string_len);
        name_str[sfnt_name.string_len] = '\0';
        if (strcmp(ps_name1, name_str) == 0) {
            *index = i;
            break;
        }
    }
}

but xdvipdfmx still has trouble handling it.

Subject: [tex-live] mapping files for OpenType fonts which follow the
	Unicode system
Message-ID: <6f7fda69b87958f0544de636e43152b5.squirrel@mail.toybox.ca>

Here is the problem from a practical viewpoint. I wanted to produce, using
coded input, i.e. NOT by typing in Cree which as far as I can tell is what
XeTex is all about, a \Tex document containing Cree syllabics.

CTAN has the package casyll:
/usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/casyl/casyll10.mf
/usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/casyl/casyll10.tfm

The casyll fonts are not very nice and so I searched for nicer ones. I
found a whole set of excellent fonts at:

http://www.languagegeek.com/font/fontdownload.html#Full_Unicode

[There are also Cree and many other unicode fonts at:
http://www.wazu.jp/]

I much prefer using plain \Tex and dvips because of the greater control.
This did not pose a problem when using casyll, because that the .mf and
.tfm files were given. I was thus able to generate a font table and then
proceed to define my own macros in a file called [cree.mac]. So, e.g. the
Cree syllable "ma" was referenced via the definition:

(A.) \def\ma{\kern -1.0truept \char237}.

The languagegeek.com fonts are OpenType fonts which follow the Unicode
system for syllabics.

So here is the problem; all the articles, instruction manuals, etc
either assume that there is a map file or that you want to create a mapping
file with fontinstall or manually for Type1 fonts.

But what does one do if one ONLY has:
1. the *.ttf file, which one converts via ttf2tfm,
2. the knowledge of the Unicode for syllabics,
       but NOT
3. the *.map file.

There must be some way of converting (2.)---perhaps even automatically via a
shell command  "unicode2map"---into (3) so that I could proceed as in (A.).

As I said above, I have not found a way of doing this.   I examined quite
a few  *.map files (e.g. Arabic) which were already on my TexLive Linux
installation, but there does not seem to be a uniform set of rules.

Any references or suggestions would be most welcome. A fairly simple way
of creating the map file would provide \TeX users with a new set of fonts
for languages.

the report.

The new latex.ltx defines \newXeTeXintercharclass (previously provided
by xelatex.ini), but not \xe at alloc@intercharclass and similar "internal"
control sequences.

Looking at xeCJK.sty (or .dtx), I cannot tell if \newXeTeXintercharclass
can be used.  I hope so.  Liu, Lee?  (Scott's full msg, with the minimal

I'm not aware of any problems.  Please send me the fonts privately

Hi Roger,

    I much prefer using plain \Tex and dvips because of the greater control.

To use dvips, you have to have Type 1 fonts.  dvips does not
support truetype (or opentype).  Therefore you'd have to convert the fonts
you found to Type 1 (assuming their license permits it).  I don't have a
recipe, sorry.  Maybe otftotfm would be of help.

pdftex supports truetype fonts to some extent, if plain tex but not
dvips is of interest.  Thanh wrote an article explaining what has to be
done (not trivial): http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94thanh.pdf.

Similarly, luatex and xetex can also read otf/ttf fonts, and don't
require using Unicode input.  For XeTeX, it seems \XeTeXglyph and
related might do what you want (essentially \char for such fonts),
though I haven't tried it myself.  See http://ctan.org/pkg/xetexref.
I didn't look up LuaTeX, but I'm sure it has the equivalent.

There is no simple solution that I know of.  Hope something in that helps.

On a much simpler front,

    (A.) \def\ma{\kern -1.0truept \char237}.

You should put a space after "237", else unexpected expansion can bite you.
\def\ma{\kern -1.0truept \char237 }

I also have to wonder if you really mean "true" pt, i.e., that you
intentionally want the macros to work improperly if \mag is used.

best,
karl

I could look at this from the  latex side: the error message shows the new
allocation
mechanism from the latex 2015 release I can confirm I get the same error
here, investigating...

The new allocation scheme "knows" about xetex and always uses count257 here
just as count11 has (always)  been used to record dimen allocations.
As it is not allocated it doesn't have a name in the new scheme.


But for backward compatibility probably "something" should do

\ifx\e at alloc\@undefined\else
  \countdef\xe at alloc@intercharclass=257
\fi

possibilities for places where this could  go would be latex.ltx,
xelatex.ini or
somewhere in xecjk and/or ucharclasses packages.

Bit late to think about which is best at present....

interesting.

    \ifx\e at alloc\@undefined\else
      \countdef\xe at alloc@intercharclass=257
    \fi

don't we need to do the \countdef unconditionally?  (or rather, if
\xe at alloc@intercharclass itself is undefined.)  at the point where
xeCJK.sty (or whatever) is read, latex's \e at alloc may or may not be
defined, but it's still using \xe at alloc@intercharclass.  seems to me.

i will do it in xelatex.ini unless you want to do it in latex.ltx.

    Bit late to think about which is best at present....

it is not too late. this is what pretests are for.

it comes to the same thing really, you want to say

if the old latex allocation scheme is in use do nothing (as
\xe at alloc@intercharclass
already defined)
else
  \countdef\xe at alloc@intercharclass=257
fi

test for "old scheme" can be

\ifx\e at alloc\@undefined

or

\ifx\xe at alloc@intercharclass\@undefined\else

whichever you think looks more natural.

the test is only really needed if the code was added to the package
the ini file or latex.ltx can presumably assume that the new scheme
is being used.

Today's self update hangs on my windows machine, possibly because of the
perl update. Also tried from local repository but same story: update
--self doesn't finish. The task manager says that perl.exe is running.
I've been waiting 15 min or so then killed the process with Ctrl-C.

Do you think that uninstall/reinstall is due? Or could there be another

If I understood Roger correctly the fonts he found are unicode
encoded and then \char is the correct command. \XeTeXglyph is highly
font specific and only needed e.g. for symbol fonts where the glyphs
have no unicode point.

No this is not what xetex is about. You can in a xetex document type
in an ? and get the correct output. But you can also define a
command \def\euro{\char"20AC}  and then type \euro. 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
\def\euro{\char"20AC} \euro
\end{document}


You could also use a teckit-mapping to transform a latin input into
a cree output:

This looks as if it worked correctly in your case and you just killed
mktexlsr. In my case it didn't even get that far. It hang after

I have just tried on GNU Linux (Fedora) on x86_64 and everyting worked
smoothly. It may take some time to download the packages, I am on a gigabit
network so it is fast but if your connection is slower, time required for
reinitialization of an updated infrastructure may be longer.

Could it be that this problem is specific to windows? In this update
perl.win32 was included and I understand that updating the platform upon
which all the scripts are running is certainly not straight forward.

In unix systems, tlmgr can update itself while it is running. It is not
possible in Windows, you have to do this in two separate steps:
tlmgr update -self
tlmgr update -all

If you try the latter without the former, tlmgr should report that "tlmgr
update -self" is needed. I can try at home what happens if I do not specify
-self.

No need to try it. tlmgr will refuse to do anything unless the self
update ran. I'm aware of this. As I mentioned at the beginning it is
"update --self" that hangs.

My usual recipe is

    tlmgr update --self --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed

and works on Windows as well as Unix (tlmgr restarts itself after the
update).

Well I naturally did "tlmgr update --self". And then tlmgr says

G:\Z-Test>tlmgr update --self
tlmgr.pl: package repository http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/
tlmgr.pl: saving backups to D:/texlive/2015/tlpkg/backups

and then nothing happens but the CPU use raises and the ventilator
works a lot.

Folks,

There was a final glitch in XeTeX Mac font support. The patched versions
didn?t pass tests on the older platforms used to build TeX Live.
Jiang Jiang fixed that problem last night.

I have just submitted new Mac binaries with these patched versions,
and will make new beta versions of BasicTeX-2015 and MacTeX-2015
tomorrow. If you already have older versions of these, TLU should update
to the new binaries sometime tomorrow.

Mac fonts have many variants, and in some cases the patched versions cannot
access all the variants. I think this problem is being addressed. 

Many thanks to Khaled and to Jiang Jiang for very hard work on these
problems. Mac users own them a debt of gratitude.

Dick Koch

Hi,

I should note that TTC support is not complete yet, which means for
fonts like ITF Devanagari you can only use the first font in that ttc.
I intend to work on that but since I will have to do that after work
please expect some delays.

Yes. A manual run of mktexlsr (afterwards) completed in about 4 seconds,
(which is a bit slow compared to the situation on my mac os laptop), but
when I CTRLed-C the tlmgr self update, mktexlsr had been hanged (seemingly)
for some minutes.

It may be relevant that my /texlive/2015 is on a volume which is not
under my $HOME, I don't know the details of the underlying file system,
and the bottleneck might be there.

Indeed, during the update of packages the system again appeared to hang at
some point, perhaps due to some disk activity by another user.

Thus my report is probably not to be taken into consideration, at least
it is not at all of the same nature as your and Ulrike Windows problem,

Also I had left that installation without updating it for ten days, thus
I did not know what was the expected behavior and should presumably have
waited a bit before jumping to the conclusion something was hanged.

Message-ID: <5c12dc19.436.14cfb6bb2da.Coremail.shuwei1204@163.com>

Dear Developers,


     I have updated the OS of my computer to ubuntu 15.04 amd64 edition recently, and also update TeX Live to TeXLive 2015 from the ubuntu source.


     Then I found that when I use xelatex to complie my tex documents with some eps files which are produced by Adobe Acrobat Pro 9(my eps file come from pdf files), some error will occur like follows:
 
 
[27Error: /undefinedresource in resourcestatus

       But under TeX Live 2009 in Debian 6 and TeX Live 2011 in Ubuntu 12.04 and TeX Live 2013 in Ubuntu 14.04.02, They all works well with the same eps files.


       I tried to use pdf2ps and ps2eps command to re-produce the eps files from my source pdf files. The new eps files can be complied, but the quality is much lower than before.


        I attach a source pdf, a eps file produced by Acrobat 9 and another produced by pdf2ps and ps2eps command for reference.


                                                             ???

??? -- Are you /sure/ that you have obtained TeX Live 2015 from the
Ubuntu source ?  To the best of my knowledge, TeX Live 2015 is still in
pre-test and not yet available from any platform-specific sources.

I think the question is still relevant, for SFNT-CFF fonts, should
FT_Get_Postscript_Name return the name from ?name? table or the ?CFF?
table? This is relevant here because fonts in a font collections sharing
a ?CFF? table will return the same name (this is not a bug per se).

Using standard for windows tlmgr in the gui mode today's update went well.
I only had a warning:
  Argument "37001+" isn't numeric in numeric lt (<) at
  C:/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/ scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 2237.
  Executing action update

  tlmgr.pl: Preparing TeX Live infrastructure update...
  Backup option not implemented for infrastructure update.
  Finished

Then, after updating tlperl.win32 and restarting tlmgr all updates (11 
from yesterday) went smoothly.

Scott: I hope that xeCJK.sty will work again after tonight's build.
You might have to remake xelatex.fmt explicitly, though I hope not.

David and Joseph:

    test for "old scheme" can be
    \ifx\e at alloc\@undefined
    or
    \ifx\xe at alloc@intercharclass\@undefined\else

Doesn't make sense to me.

What we want is for \xe at alloc@intercharclass to end up being \count257.
latex.ltx doesn't define it.  Therefore I put this into TL's xelatex.ini:

\begingroup
  \catcode`\@=11
  \ifx\xe at alloc@intercharclass\@undefined
    \global\countdef\xe at alloc@intercharclass=257
  \fi
\endgroup

No \else on the \ifx.  If there was an \else, it would be a no-op, since
neither \xe at alloc@intercharclass nor anything else will be defined at
that point.  (I see no practical reason why the \ifx is needed at all,
but can't hurt.)

I can't put it after the \input latex.ltx since that ends with \dump and
Joseph already went to all the trouble of eradicating the hacks to do
stuff after that in the .ini.  Surely we don't want to resurrect all that.

If you decide to define \xe at alloc@intercharclass in latex.ltx, let me
know and I'll remove it from the .ini.

I have tested your AcrobatProduce.eps. My Ghostscript is 9.16.
There seems to be no problem here. See an attached epstest.tar.gz.
The problem must be concerned with Ghostscript.
Anyway, if you have pdf files, it is best to use them directly
in xelatex.

Thanks,
Akira

You're right, I might be a bug of Ghostscript 9.15 which is the version I am using.


And thank you for your advise to use pdf file directly. I didn't know that pdf file can be used directly by xelatex.

Well, I just couldn't get rid of the reported behaviour, for whatever
reason. So I brought myself to do a fresh install yesterday
(2015-04-27). Today the infrastructure update went smoothly as usual,
including self update: tlperl.win32 (37064 -> 37085).

In the light of the recent OpenType version, stuff in the SFNT's
`name' table(s) should always have priority.

Exactly.  One more reason that separate `name' tables in a TTC should
be used.

Looking into Adobe's freely available SourceHanSans.ttc (having a size
of 111 MByte, with a whopping number of 28 subfonts), I see that
FreeType doesn't do the right thing.  Fixed now in git, please test.

Thanks Werner! That patch works fine with XeTeX for the font I'm
testing (HanziPen.ttc).

Today I could test with another machine where tlpretest was not
reinstalled. The infrastructure update didn't work either. My conclusion
is therefore that windows users need to reinstall because self-updating
is not possible from tlperl.win32 <37064.

I got around the problem by using 

tlmgr update --force tlperl.win32

Thanks for testing.

Siep who provides the tlperl packages since ages is currently on
the BachoTeX conference. I hope she will read this and comment on it.

I have no idea what could go wrong here...

It would be great if *someone* could keep a failing Windows
installation for testing ... it seems that the simultaneous
update of tlperl and texlive.infra creates problems.
If we want to fix that, a testing bed would be nice ...
or, maybe we do not want to fix it anyway ;-)

Subject: [tex-live] \string in xetex
Message-ID: <CAEW6iOgiBzrYEmHVMcZFP5gPeCe9yRogx9QuXVhgkwGk=gtn7A@mail.gmail.com>

I asked a similar question on the xetex list but I wonder if anyone here
has a better grasp than me on the use of utf16 v utf 32 in xetex.web and
can offer any insight into the use of \string in xetex.

The attached file produces a log of

A=B
A=C
A=D
A=E
B=C
B=D
B=E
C=D
C=E
D=E


with luatex, but with xetex it produces

! Undefined control sequence.
l.6 \edef\c{\string??
                       }
?
! Undefined control sequence.
l.10 \edef\e{\string??
                        }
?
A=B
C=E
 )


which is clearly pretty wrong

(\string is producing two tokens with the UTF-16 representation,
rather than one token)


I don't think it's a show stopper for TL2015 as it's always been that way
as far as I can see, but it would be nice to fix it, but my attempts to do
so have taught me a lot about the web sources but not produced anything
usable.

Sorry I just realised that the undefined command error is due to different
catcode defaults for xetex and
luatex but if you add space after \string in \c and \e you get no error but
a log of

A=B
C=D
C=E
D=E


which is still wrong, fixed test file attached.

An aside here. With

  \edef\c{\string??}

I'd expect an error as ?? is a letter in UnicodeData.txt

    1D400;MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL A;Lu;0;L;<font> 0041;;;;N;;;;;

With LaTeX in TL'15 you see that with both XeTeX and LuaTeX as both are
now loading unicode-letters.def. However, for plain the formats are
build using unicode-letters.tex (XeTeX, up-to-date I think) and
luatex-unicode-letters.tex (based on an older unicode-letters.tex).
Probably the LuaTeX data file needs updating or alternatively they could
both use unicode-letters.def as this remains compatible with plain
although it's part of the LaTeX2e kernel distribution.

I must be missing something here. Whilst there is a problem with XeTeX
(try \show\c) the fact that A = B and C = D = E looks right: the first
set are letters, the second set other chars.

the updated test file starts with \catcode"1D400=12 so they should all be
the same
as reported by luatex.

Well yes, like I said that's the well-know issue with \string, XeTeX and
high chars. [At least it's well-know to me :-)]

Hi,

It is known that Ghostscript version 9.15 has a bug
not to load fonts through GS_LIB path.  The problem
could be around the bug.

Subject: [tex-live] XeTeX Complete Success
Message-ID: <C389BAAD-6902-401D-BA8B-AFB8CA4198F4@uoregon.edu>

Folks,

If you have been following this thread, you know that we wrote a script to test all fonts
in XeTeX which are shipped by Apple in Yosemite. A typical entry in this script was

	\font\ha=?Helvetica?
	\ha

	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

	1234567890

Apple shipped 215 fonts, and we discovered that 18 were broken.

However, this isn?t the full story because most of these fonts have variant forms. 
For instance, Helvetica is listed in Apple?s Font Book with variants

	Light
	Light Oblique
	Oblique
	Bold
	Bold Oblique

To test, say, the Bold variant, the first line of the previous test should have been

	\font\ha=?Helvetica-Bold?

The number of tests would increase to around 1000. Perhaps someone would
like to expand the test to the full list of variants.

Many of these variants worked fine. However, the Kohlinoor Devangari font has
five variants and only the first worked. This bug was reported by users who have
been anxious to use the font for some time.

JIANG JIANG HAS JUST FIXED THIS PROBLEM. 

All five variants of Kohlinoor Devanagari now work. Moreover, the Jiang Jiang fix
also fixes two fonts that up to now had been broken, so at this moment, as far
as I know, the story is that all variants work and all but two fonts work, both
Bitmapped Fonts. The only fonts that fail are GB18030 Bitmap and Apple Color
Emoji. As I understand it, bitmapped fonts aren?t supported by XeTeX, and how
many such fonts are even used nowadays?

This wasn?t a trivial fix; Jiang Jiang had to request a change in the FreeType
library. 

I just rebuilt the Mac binaries, but this new development causes me to rebuild again.
If I work fast, the binaries should be available for Macs via the standard update mechanism
tomorrow.

I personally am amazed at the speed with which these bugs were fixed. When I got
into this game several days ago, I knew nothing about fonts. Since then, I?ve mainly
learned that fonts are very complicated gadgets. Enormous thanks to
Jiang Jiang and the others involved in this story.

None revision line contains "+" in my texlive.tlpdb. Today's update 
warning:

Argument "37058+" isn't numeric in numeric lt (<) at 
C:/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 2237.
Executing action update

after updating infra (tlperl.win32 37064->37085) and restarting tlmgr
other updates (66) went well.

Yes, give me some time ... bit on stress.
I use + in some locations, but I wonder why this didn't occur till now.

There are currently some differences between the outcomes for XeTeX and
LuaTeX as for XeTeX we have settings for line break.  In particular,
code points marked as ideographs in LineBreak.txt are set as catcode 11
in LuaTeX, based on the pattern set by unicode-letters.tex and the Perl
script which is used to generate this file.

Most probably this area needs revision, at least to bring category codes
into line between LuaTeX and XeTeX. To do that there needs to be a
proper discussion of what the 'expected' catcodes are for different
Unicode code point types. I will raise this on the appropriate lists and
lay out what happens at present.

COmment from tlmgrgui.pl:

  # we have to take care since strings in revision numbers on the remote
  # and might contain "+" indicating sub-package updates
  # status

Staszek, can you get the current version of tlmgrgui.pl from svn
and try with that, and see if the same problem still happens?

Thanks

Done, I lowered revision number for tlperl.win32 in my local tlpdb, then 
updated only infra without problems or warnings. Thanks,

Ohhh, that is impossible .... what is BachoTeX without you?

And why don't you jump over to Japan for a meeting ...? We are here
close to China, on the Japan Sea side ;-)

Have a save trip!

Stupid question: Is this supposed to solve the initially reported
problem? If yes, what kind of testing should I do? tlmgr update --self
still hangs on a machine that hasn't been updated since April 26.

Should I run update-tlmgr-r37115.exe and then retry?

No, that is a fix for the +.. is not numeric error Staszek reported.

Concerning the tlperl update, I have no idea - absolutely.

I hope that Siep can check that in BachoTeX, but I don't know.

Howdy,

I don't know if anyone else has reported this and I'm not sure where to report the problem. Under TL2015-pretest the following bibliography reference fails when using [backend=biber] but is found when using [backend=bibtex]. The reference is found in both cases using TL2014-final.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
%\usepackage[backend=bibtex]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{tugboat.bib}
\begin{document}
\section{First Section}
Here it is:\cite{Koch:TB22-3-240}.
\printbibliography
\end{document}

Out of 13 references in my original document biblatex/biber was only able to find 7.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

I can confirm. This is biber's log:

[1] Config.pm:327> INFO - Logfile is 't.blg'
[113] biber-MSWIN:273> INFO - === Do Apr , 2015, 17:00:48

And then biber hangs.

On my Mac OS X, Biber does not hang, but it does not find the reference either

At Bachotex, internet is not very good, and I can not do much of any 
testing.

I was certainly aware of this thread,but had nothing to contribute. I am 
glad Ulrike found a workaround.

biber doesn't hang but takes some time (the bib is large), but I can
confirm that it doesn't like the titles of the entries
Hamid:TB31-2-197 and Kubik:TB10-1-65. Someone should make a bug
report for biber.
