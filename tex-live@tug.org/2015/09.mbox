    $ tlmgr check runfiles

Thanks for the report.  Yes, I know.  I have contacted all the authors
(years ago).  They said they will fix the conflicts in the next releases
of any of these packages (which I don't believe has happened, though I
haven't 100% re-checked).

Feel free to write directly to the authors -- the more who do so, the
more likely something will actually get fixed.

Meanwhile, since (bizarrely) I have seen no reports from actual users
about problems in actual documents, I have let it go. -k

Agreed, that's a bug. I'll add it.

First of all I am always amazed and grateful to all of you who put 
together the TeX DVD. Thank you.

But (and after that you knew that there would be a But), I have a couple 
of suggestions. First some background. I well remember how excited we 
were in my computer group to get a 256k hard drive (about the size of a 
fridge and freezer). Since then I have travelled across many computer 
systems. My present one is a Windows PC (can you get any other?) where I 
run Ubunto under Windows (don't ask, it's a long, painful, and 
half-forgotten story).

The bottom line is that in today's world I am woefully short of disc 
space, being limited to under 30G for my use.

I had TexLive 2014 installed with 1.2 G free space left. I wanted to 
install TexLive 2015 from the latest DVD but the installation soon 
stopped through, I presume, lack of space. Eventually after deleting 
much stuff (much of which I had used, even if only occasionaly)
I freed up 4.9G. At that point I could install TexLive 2015, which on my 
machine required 3.6G. I was installing via a terminal window which shut 
itself down when it decided that it had done enough. Then there was the 
tlmgr upgrade of stuff from 2014 to 2015 which, in my case, required 
another 0.25G.

I think that it would be very useful if the instructions that came with 
the TexLive DVD gave an indication of the hard-disc space requirements, 
mainly for TexLive itself but also for possible tlmgr updates from an 
earlier to a later version.

It would have helped me if there had been some indication in the 
documentation that the terminal window would close by itself so that 
there was no chance of seeing what had happened.

I know that I could have freed up the necessary space by deleting my 
2014 TexLive installation but I wasn't going to do that until I had a 
new working up-to-date version.

I'm still very appreciative of all the work that has gone into TexLive 2015.

The main screen of the text installer does tell you the required
disk space:

<C> customizing installation collections
     47 collections out of 48, disk space required: 4021 MB

Although it would be simple enough to request some input for the
user at the end, it would in most cases be an additional nuisance,
e.g. if the text installer was started from a pre-existing terminal
session, or under Windows, when the wrapper batchfile already ends
with a pause command.

Also, in recent versions of ghostscript epswrite has been replaced

BTW, during a network installation more space is required because all
downloaded .tar.xz files are removed when the actual installation is
finished.

When someone asked for an installation scheme which only supports the
new engines (XeTeX and LuaTeX), I experimented a bit with the
collections menu.  It turned out that it's not so easy to create a
reasonably small subset.  The reason is that fonts and documentation
consume a lot of space.  Maybe more optimization is possible if you
exactly know in advance what you need.  One could, for example, remove
support for all languages one doesn't understand, or remove ConTeXt if
not needed.  However, don't be disappointed if you don't save as much
space as you expected.

Peter, you said that you are running Ubuntu under Windows.  I suppose
that Ubuntu is running in a virtual machine.  If you need TeX Live on
both systems, it's sufficient to install it under Ubuntu but with
binaries for both systems.  On Windows you can mount it via Samba,
hence only the binaries have to exist twice on your machine.  This
saves a lot space.

Disk space is cheap nowadays.  But if you can't replace the disk for
some reason, you can at least use a USB stick as an additional disk.

This makes only sense on Unix because Windows doesn't mount USB sticks
and thus there is no file-system cache and everything is horribly
slow.  On Unix, however, you can even read a file from a USB stick
before it had been written to it.  Thus USB sticks can be used as
replacements for hard drives efficiently, at least on Unix.

Peter, I think that it's easier to add more disk space rather than to
fiddle with the TeX Live installer.  16 or 32 GB sticks are not very
expensive and even 64 GB sticks are affordable.  If you consider to go
this way, let me know.  I'll provide more information then.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Howdy,

Just updated to the latest l3 packages (via TeX Live Utility/tlmgr) and believe I'm again having problems with the unicode-math package.

Runaway argument?
\prg_do_nothing: \cs_gset_eq:NN \backslash \'::\exp_not:N 
./FancyTBL3XLTX.tex:54: File ended while scanning use of \__tl_rescan:w.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
l.54 \begin{document}
                     ^^M
? 

This is to notify the list since I've already gotten in touch with Will Robertson.

Good Luck,

Dear friends,

This is probably quite off-topic, but I'd like to hear from you if I 
should take this jest forward. Long story short, I was planning to 
include this note in the upcoming arara user manual:

http://i.imgur.com/DzNJQhm.png

The icon was freely obtained from an image database and available with 
no restrictions whatsoever about its usage.

IMHO it does not resemble with any official Office or Word icon in usage 
nowadays or in the past, although it makes a reference to the document 
format. The icon source is available as TikZ code in arara.sty and it's 
typeset with \wordicon in the main document.

Do you think it is safe to include this jest? I don't want to have 
hungry lawyers sending me angry letters. :) Also, I don't know if I am 
breaking any TL policy.

All the best!

I'm not clear where the jest is as I don't know the surrounding context. 
I would be happier if "proudly" was replaced by "unfortunately" but 
that, again, depends on the context.

Hi, Peter!

I dislike MS as well, although I have to help my dad once in a while 
with his spreadsheets. :) I thought of including this text just to make 
fun of MS and Office in general. The user manual is very complex, so I 
doubt it could be achieved with Word, and not to mention the beautiful 
typesetting (oh and it's memoir-powered! wink wink). :)

I am open to replacing "proudly" with "unfortunately", but for now I am 
more worried with potential licensing issues with the icon, even if it 
does not reproduce any original Microsoft work. :)

All the best!

Lacking the context, and knowing how humour can be easily
misconstrued, if I was doing it I would include 'not' in the text,
and change the 'W' icon to '!W' (or perhaps W-with-line-above, in
the spirit of active-low CPU signal documentation).  Or some other
negation sign, but '?W' would probably look ugly.

Hi Paulo,
it's probably better to convert the image to JPEG because that is what
Windows users expect.

PNG files look very strange to Windows users, not to mention vector
graphics...  Optimize the JPEG for maximum compression, Windows users
are accustomed to the artefacts and don't expect anything else.

The text can be improved too.  Use full justification and set

  \hyphenpenalty=10000 
  \tolerance=10000 

Microsoft Word users love interword glue.  The more the better.  This
way they can imply that they are using professional software.

Honestly, Computer Modern fonts are too common.  All Windows users use
Comic Sans if they need an individual font.  Maybe you shouldn't be an
exception.

If I was doing this, I would use the gimp to manipulate the icons :

I normally use it for photographs, with my own _very_ idiosyncratic
workflow, but in the last couple of months I needed some icons for
an sddm theme.  The process of painting into a small image is not
_too_ hard (zoom in, then zoom in a bit more, and select at the
pixel level).  From there, you can of course save in any suitable
format.

I saw someone noting that png files are somewhat alien to windows
users, but I guess you will end up with a PDF and whatever
intermediate format for the icon suits your process.

Whatever you do, enjoy it!

Hello!

An update to the latex3 packages in texlive has broken the
unicode-math package quite severely: running lualatex on the minimal
file

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

fails.

unicode-math has now been updated to fix this showstopper - please
could you update the corresponding texlive package?

Many thanks!

If you have an urgent need, installing the new unicode-math package, e.g.,
to texmf-local, from source is quite easy.  If the source package isn't on
your ctan mirror yet, you can download a snapshot zip file from github.

Thanks - I'd already done that!  But I can imagine this breaking a
lot of people's systems, as I'm guessing that unicode-math is a
moderately significant package, and I wanted to bring it to your
attention in case you weren't aware.

Best wishes,

Hi Julian - thanks. unicode-math is included for tonight's TL update.
It just hit CTAN.  As a rule, I update everything that shows up on CTAN
on a given day, although inevitably sometimes I miss a day or things
might need more effort and thus take more time.

Best,

Subject: [tex-live] Failure to create index with current xindy
Message-ID: <20150916195223.GA13157@milliways>

I normally use self-compiled texlive, as documented in Beyond
Linuxfromscratch.  But in my latest build I decided to use the
binary versions (we also cover that), and to try to get my head
around tlmgr, which worked fine.

But - in the past I had to create testfiles to ensure that I was
building asy, biber, and xindy correctly.  My current testfiles are
at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~ken/tex-testfiles/ called
latex-test-20150601.tar.xz (the docs are slightly out of date re
options, and in fact there is a minimal ConTeXt test too - just
run ./configure to check your available packages and TTF/OTF fonts).

With recent source builds (so, everything as at the 2015 release,
apart from slightly newer biber) my tests still work.

But with current binary texlive (x86_64-linux, if it matters) the
xindy tests do not produce an index.

I'm attaching a Makefile, cut-down xindy.tex, and a diff of the log
between good and bad.  I note that in my good version luaotfload
doesn't find the font and falls back to a file, that is not a
problem.  Versions of many packages have changed, but the important
thing is that xindy-xindy.ind is no longer created.

That test is a shorter variant of my original using lualatex.  I also
have a variant with traditional markup for accents - that uses
pdflatex ; texindy -d script -d level=3 -M lang/english/utf8-lang
xindynonlua.idx 2>&1 | tee xindynonlua.texindy ; pdflatex
--shell-escape : again, that does not produce an index, again the
.ind file is not created:

| runsystem(splitindex -m "" xindynonlua.idx)...executed.
|
| runsystem(texindy -M lang/english/utf8-lang xindynonlua-xindynonlua.idx)...executed.
|
|
| No file xindynonlua-xindynonlua.ind.

As always, it is possible that what I am doing is wrong (it took me
ages to find any xindy invocation which worked at all).  If so, a
pointer would be welcome.

The cut-down version is not a MWE (I want multiple pages to show
that the links from the index go to the correct page), but it is
fairly short (about 15K for this post and attachments, I think).

TIA

Here 'xindy-xindy.ind' was created after 'make' on windows.

Does a direct command
texindy -M lang/english/utf8-lang xindy-xindy.idx
work in your case with current xindy?

No, and I got an error message which made me think I understand what
has gone wrong:

/opt/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-linux/xindy.run: error while loading
shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file:
No such file or directory

Doh!  I installed non-wide libncurses6 without thinking.   After
fixing up my script to correctly install the .so.5* non-wide libs,
my normal tests work again.  Thank you so much, and sorry for the
noise.

Subject: [tex-live] Garbage in documents after upgrade
Message-ID: <55FC7433.801@alice.it>

For the sake of completeness, I want to flag the following issue 
occurred after today TL2015 upgrade (on OSX 10.10, Yosemite).

I rebuilt some documents and discovered that "List of Figures" and "List 
of Tables" (*) contain garbage (doc-wrong_pages_sample.pdf, in the 
attached archive). The same documents, built on September 02, don't show 
garbage (doc-OK_pages_sample.pdf, in the attached archive).

Out of curiosity, today there were these updates (after rsynced my local 
repo, /opt/tlnet):

I think I have found what causes this issue.

Removing the line

   \usepackage{subfig}

from the test case attached, cause the garbage going away. Obviously I 
need the "subfig" package in my documents.

Maybe I have to write to the "subfig" maintainers..

Ciao,
  Angelo.

Interesting report.

If you look at the file list of your file:

  ?????
  ?  article.cls    2014/09/29 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class
  ?   size10.clo    2014/09/29 v1.4h Standard LaTeX file (size option)
  ?   subfig.sty    2005/06/28 ver: 1.3 subfig package
  ?   keyval.sty    2014/10/28 v1.15 key=value parser (DPC)
  ?  caption.sty    2015/09/17 v3.3-111 Customizing captions (AR)
  ? caption3.sty    2015/09/17 v1.7-111 caption3 kernel (AR)
  ?????

you see that `subfig' didn't change since ages and, by contrast,
'caption(3)' changed in July. The latter was updated on CTAN only
yesterday:

  ?????
  ? http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.ctan.announce/12022/
  ?????

So I guess `caption(3)' is (are) the culprit(s), not `subfig'.

Best regards.

Indeed.. I notice this looking at the timestamps of

   ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlnet/archive/subfig.*

packages... and if I am right...

subfig includes caption package..

Maybe we have to write there..

In `caption's README, it is asked for bugs to be reported e.g. here:

I ran into a connectivity issue while running `tlmgr --update ` and
had to restart it as it was hanging due to the non-responding network.
When I restarted it, it told me that the package it was updating at
when I CTRL-C'ed it had been forcibly removed (and thus it didn't
updated it and it couldn't be find when compiling documents). That
behaviour seems undesirable. Is it normal or was it an error on my

I always use

     tlmgr update --self --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed


See
     texdoc tlmgr

Message-ID: <CAOhRkVYkkc+ntkdPcVAfzjd1yZOsunen_mOHAkZYQug=exJKfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to use Lyx 2.1.3 to create a small document using galician as
language. I am using Arch Linux and texlive-core 2015.37554-1. The
generation of the PDF fails with the following error (from the log):

! LaTeX Error: Missing \begin{document}.
> See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
> Type H <return> for immediate help.

 Looking into /usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tools/varioref.sty I noticed
the following lines in the galician section:

\let\reftextafter     {na p\'axina seguinte}%
> \let\refte*xtbefore    {na p\'axina anterior}*%


I do not know any TeX, but I observed that for all the other languages
either "def" is used instead of "let" for the equivalent lines or, if "let"
is used, is assigned to a "def" assignment. Based on this I replaced both
"let"s by "def"s in the previously mentioned lines of the galician section
and, after that, Lyx was able to generate the PDF.

It looks to me like a bug, but due to my limited knowledge I considered
that others should evaluate it.

The source to generate the sty file is this dtx:
http://ctan.space-pro.be/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/varioref.
dtx

Please, let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,
Jacob

thanks, that's clearly a bug (and the correct fix) I'll pass it on to the
right place.

Subject: [tex-live] Using a --profile and relative TEXDIR
Message-ID: <5602FAF1.5030702@morningstar2.co.uk>

Hello all,

I'm trying to set up some automation for a test system. Part of that
requires doing an unattended TL installation. Following the instructions
on https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html, I've first done a
manual installation to get a texlive.profile file, then used that for an
automated install after removing the TeX system.

All is fine if I use an absolutely unaltered file. However, as I'm not
using sudo I did the install in my home dir. That results in

    TEXDIR /home/joseph/texlive
    TEXMFCONFIG ~/.texlive2015/texmf-config
    TEXMFHOME ~/texmf
    TEXMFLOCAL /home/joseph/texlive/texmf-local
    TEXMFSYSCONFIG /home/joseph/texlive/texmf-config
    TEXMFSYSVAR /home/joseph/texlive/texmf-var
    TEXMFVAR ~/.texlive2015/texmf-var

where ~ has been expanded in the 'system' vars. If I edit them back to ~
then the installer fails. However, for my real use I can't rely on ~
expanding to anything fixed: how do I make this work?

(At present I'm going with install to /tmp as I can write there.)

    where ~ has been expanded in the 'system' vars. If I edit them back
    to ~ then the installer fails.

I guess we have to fix that bug.  The installer code is unfortunately
twisted.  I'll look into it as soon as I can (after the next TUGboat
..)  if no one else gets there first.

Just for kicks, you could try deleting the TEXMFSYS* lines.  I'm not
sure if they will remain undefined or if they will get automatically
defined based on TEXDIR (that's what happens when TEXDIR is set
interactively, in install-menu-text.pl::directories_menu()).

sorry,

Subject: [tex-live] Profile-based install: scheme plus selected extras?
Message-ID: <5603C09A.4060804@morningstar2.co.uk>

Hello all,

The documentation for using the -profile option with install-tl says the
best way to make a profile is to start from one from a successful manual
install. However, the installer interface doesn't seem to allow
selection of a scheme plus 'extras', so I'm not sure what goes into a
profile to achieve the equivalent of

    ./install-tl -scheme scheme-basic

     [path]/tlmgr install [list of extra packages]

I don't really want to use a bigger scheme, but the above seems a bit
inefficient: if I can get the installer to do everything there's only
one hash/format build phase.

What do I need in a profile to make that work?

Joseph

Interesting - in my case it succeeded and created a directory
	./~
(yes, as is)

I have a quick hack ready that replaces *ALL* values that start with ~
with $HOME (USERPROFILEDIR). Can you try the following patch to
install-tl:
@@ -1577,11 +1577,17 @@ sub read_profile {
   open PROFILE, "<$profilepath"
     or die "$0: Cannot open profile $profilepath for reading.\n";
   my %pro;
+  my $home = getenv('HOME');
+  $home = getenv('USERPROFILE') if win32();
+  $home ||= '~';
   while (<PROFILE>) {
     chomp;
     next if m/^[[:space:]]*$/; # skip empty lines
     next if m/^[[:space:]]*#/; # skip comment lines
     my ($k,$v) = split (" ", $_, 2); # value might have spaces
+    #
+    # expand ~ to home directory
+    $v =~ s/^~/$home/;
     $pro{$k} = $v;
   }
   foreach (keys %vars) {

Hi Joseph,
after you've chosen an installation scheme you can go to the
collections menu and enable additional collections.

A scheme is a set of collections and some schemes also contain a few
packages.  It's not possible to add/remove packages but you can always
add or remove collections.   

Instead of selecting a particular scheme you can go as well straight
to the collections menu, disable all collections ("-" key), and select
the collections you need.

If you think that installing a complete collection (though you only
need a few packages) consumes too much time, consider to write a shell
script which first invokes the installer in order to install a basic
scheme and then runs tlmgr in order to install extra packages.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

Thanks for that: I suspected there was no package-by-package selection
in the installer. I'll stick to the minimal scheme + tlmgr.

OK, bonus question: is there a way to do a smaller scheme than
'minimal'? It adds things like bibtex, dvipdfmx, etc., that for the very
restricted test set up I'm working on is not required. Ideally, I'd like
to start with just the TL infrastructure and add everything by hand,
i.e. enough TL for tlmgr/fmtutil/kpsewhich/etc. to work to allow me to
then do

    tlmgr install latex latex-bin ptex ...

Some time ago I tried to find how the installed TL can be reduced. There
are only two items that are realy huge, documentation and fonts. You
probably need fonts so if the space is your concern and you have good
network connection, do not install documentation. Whenever needed, you can
find the manual on the web. Space gained by removing individual packages is
negligible in comparison with the space occupied by documentation.

That's not really possible to influence, as far as I know. The TL
packages aren't split up in that way, so when you install 'latex' you
get not only latex.ltx, etc., but also interface2e.pdf, ... If I were
worrying about disk space I could remove stuff after the fact, but
that's not the target here. It's an automated system and I'm trying to
avoid downloading more from CTAN than necessary, so anything that is
altered after download is neither here nor there.

If I understand well the option marked with a red arrow on the screenshot,
unchecking this option will not install documentation globally. I have not
tried, my disk is large enough.

IIRC the installer has a checkbox about installing documentation.

Indeed, that will avoid installing stuff. However, it won't avoid
downloading it in the first place.

It *will* avoid downloading it ... the packages are split into
the runfiles, docfiles, and sourcefiles for each package, and only
those that are installed are downloaded.

OK, I see: that was not clear from for example "tlmgr info
--only-installed" (which doesn't show separate parts for these). I was
imagining that each package from a tlmgr point of view mapped to exactly
one archive file which was then split during installation if those
options were set.

Hi
I tried to install TeX Live 2015 on my windows 7 PC. I don't have any
antivirus & tried both "Instal-tl-windows.bat" &
"Instal-tl-advanced.bat" and in both of them, after installing all
packages the setup stops installing at "running package-specific

What should I do to solve this problem?

The postactions are mostly for menu shortcuts and file associations,
but there are also font-related scripts for dvipdfmx and xetex.

So your texlive should be mostly functional as-is.

If you want to investigate: run install-tl-advanced.bat from the
command-line with an option -v which makes installation more
verbose. The installer probably won't get around to writing a log
file, so you will have to make do with what shows up in the command
prompt window. But you can copy-and-paste from there.  At least, you
should get to see exactly where the installer gets stuck.

    OK, bonus question: is there a way to do a smaller scheme than
    'minimal'? 

It seems to me it should not be hard to allow "package" in profiles
(I would not want to deal with package-level stuff in the UI, but just
in profiles would be simpler).

Then you could build up what you want from zero, i.e., not specifying
any scheme or any collection (scheme-minimal = collection-basic, and
there is no smaller collection either), just packages.  I've wanted that
myself for testing sometimes.  But I'm afraid I have no ETA for even
beginning to look at implementing such a feature.

By the way, another thought I had was that perhaps in some cases, your
test setup could use an existing installation instead of creating it
from scratch.  That is, make the minimal thing if it doesn't exist, but
if it does exist, just update it.  Or maybe you're already doing that,
or it doesn't make sense for what you're doing.  Just a stray thought...k

Subject: [tex-live] Default installation violates filesystem hierarchy
	standards
Message-ID: <201509271041.56075.psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

Dear all,

I recently installed TeX Live 2015 on a GNU/Linux system and noted that, by 
default, the installer suggests installing everything (that is, binaries, 
documentation, configuration files, etc.) in a directory hierarchy rooted 
at /usr/local/texlive/2015.

I understand the motivations for keeping the installation rooted in a 
single directory, rather than spread out in the usual places 
(/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share, etc.).  However, I believe that 
/usr/local/texlive/2015 is the wrong place to root the installation, as 
this violates the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) used by GNU/Linux, 
and probably similar specifications used by other Unix-like OSes, such as 
the System V Application Binary Interface and the Intel Binary 
Compatibility Standard.

Section 4.9.2 of the FHS [1] provides an exhaustive list of directories 
that must appear in /usr/local, and refers to another exhaustive list of 
directories that may also appear there.  The "texlive" directory is in 
neither of these lists.  (The lists of prescribed directories largely 
mirror the ones for /usr, whose specification says that "large software 
packages must not use a direct subdirectory under the /usr hierarchy".)

Installing TeX Live in /usr/local/texlive/2015 therefore makes it difficult 
for other users to predict its location, and could interfere with automated 
package management tools and other software which expects a clean 
filesystem hierarchy.

I believe the proper place to root the TeX Live installation is under /opt 
(e.g., /opt/tug/texlive/2015).  The /opt hierarchy (see Section 3.13 of the 
FHS) was specifically created for add-on application software that uses its 
own internal filesystem hierarchy.  Provided a "provider name" such as 
"tug" is registered with the Linux Assigned Names And Numbers Authority 
(LANANA) [2], software packages installed under /opt/tug can use any 
directory structure they wish.  (On the other hand, if a package is 
installed into an immediate subdirectory of /opt, such as /opt/texlive, it 
is expected to contain the usual bin and share/man subdirectories.  For 
instance, binaries would need to go in /opt/texlive/bin, not 
/opt/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-linux.)

I suggest that the easiest way of fixing this is for TUG to register the 
provider name "tug" with LANANA (which seems to be free of charge, and 
involves little more than someone in a position of authority sending them 
an e-mail) and to update the TeX Live 2015 installer so that it suggests a 
default directory of /opt/tug/texlive/2015 instead of 
/usr/local/texlive/2015.

Regards,
Tristan

Yes, that is the default location, as it has been since many many
years (20?)

We never claimed that we follow the FHS, thus we are not bound to
the FHS. We are providing TeX Live on much more systems than Linux,
and while we are sure that the /usr/local is reasonably common,
I wouldn't be sure of the /opt hierarchy.

Why? If an admin installs it, he can use links into /usr/local/bin,
or, extend the system path properly (what I did on our local department
system).

Furthermore, there is as far as I remember or have seen *NO* 
package management system that installs into /usr/local.

You are completely free to install it there, there is nobody hindering
you in that, if you are deeply interested in FHS.

At least from my side I don't see any need to change a default which
has been in use for many years, just for a FHS which we don't follow.

Of couse, others here might have a different opinion, though.

All the best

Hi all

when I started to use Linux and TeX Live in 2005, /usr/local was a common
place for software that was not a part of the Linux distro. After the
default installation of Linux it was created automatically but /opt did not
exist. Even now if I compile a package from the sources (eg I needed a
newer version of gnuplot), "make install" installs it to /usr/local, not to
/opt.

Well, that's not exactly correct, is it?  TeX Live does claim to support 
"many Unix-based platforms, including GNU/Linux".  Since many Unix-like 
platforms (not just GNU/Linux) prescribe certain filesystem layouts (as 
GNU/Linux does with the FHS), it would be helpful for a software package 
claiming compatibility with these platforms to make reasonable efforts to 
abide by their standards.

Well, to be fair, I did list two specifications for Unix-like systems, 
other than GNU/Linux, which say that software packages with their own 
filesystem hierarchies should go in /opt.  Now, I freely admit that I have 
no idea how many TeX Live users are using a system adhering to one of these 
three standards.  If it's reasonable to think that they're in a minority, 
then by all means my suggestion to change the default directory was ill-
advised.  (Most of my experience has been with GNU/Linux and with System V-
derived systems such as Solaris and IRIX.  Perhaps the familiarity has led 
me to overestimate their market share among TeX users.)

Yes, I recognize that the default is only a suggestion, and that it's 
possible to install TeX Live wherever you want.  I was assuming (rightly or 
wrongly) that most users of TeX Live's Unix installer were running an OS 
where the defaults were not strictly in accordance with the OS's accepted 
standards.  If my assumptions are reasonable, then changing the defaults 
might be a sensible thing to do.  If they aren't, then my suggestion can be 
ignored.

Tristan

/usr/local has always been (and remains) the correct place to install 
packages compiled from source, provided that they put all their files in 
the "correct" places (executables in /usr/local/bin, libraries in 
/usr/local/lib, data in /usr/local/share, etc.).  The /opt hierarchy was 
created for those rare packages which do not follow this convention.

Wait, we are not *PART* of a *distribution* of these systems, thus we
do *support* it, but that does not mean we are bound by their rules.

Simple example:
* TeX Live as is from TUG runs perfectly fine on Debian, installed into
  /usr/local/texlive/2015
* Debian (not completely though) follows the FHS
* There are TeX Live *Debian* packages, and these packages *do* follow
  the Debian standard (coincidentally, I am also the Debian packager)

Thus, yes:
- TeX Live supports Debian, without following all its rules
  (not only FHS, but also rules about config files etc etc!)
- TeX Live *Debian* packages *do* follow the rules of Debian
  (including keeping configurations across remove-install cycles etc)

Helpful? I don't see why, but that is a matter of taste, not factuality.

As noted elsewhere, this is due to a one-line typo in expl3 which is
already fixed on CTAN. Until that propagates to TL, a fix is

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

  \expandafter\let\csname xetex_suppressfontnotfounderror:D\endcsname

Howdy,

I believe there is an update to the l3kernel package that went to CTAN that hasn't come through to TeX Live yet (as of 2015/28/09 here) that is needed by the fontspec and unicode-math packages that were already updated (a couple of days ago, 2015/26/09).

Good Luck,

I believe it?s on its way now.
Sorry all for the inconvenience.

By the way, the issue can be fixed by writing

    \expandafter\let\csname xetex_suppressfontnotfounderror:D\endcsname\suppressfontnoterror

before `\usepackage{fontspec}`.

Norbert Preining writes in reponse to a suggestion that the default
location for TeX Live installations be under /opt/tug, rather than
/usr/local:

>> Furthermore, there is as far as I remember or have seen *NO* 
>> package management system that installs into /usr/local. 

Actually, there are several that do so, and that is why we made a
decision at Utah a few years ago to use a unique installation tree on
all of our new systems: /usr/uumath.  See

	http://www.math.utah.edu/faq/software/software.html#FAQ-1

for a discussion.  The regrettable practice of GNU compilers
documented there is another strong reason to avoid /usr/local.

For TeX Live, I have no problem with the current default of
/usr/local/texlive/YYYY (in our case, YYYY = 2003, 2004, ....).  That
introduces only a single new directory under /usr/local, and does not
interfere with any other software, including those package managers in
the BSD world that install packages under /usr/local.

Also, symlinks are a reasonable way to get executables inside the TeX
Live tree visible to users with default search paths that include
/usr/local/bin.  Alternatively, and the one that we use, one can
simply add /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/bin/ARCH to PATH ahead of /bin,
/usr/bin, and /usr/local/bin.  [On many of our systems, there are at
least two other independent TeX distributions installed, including an
older one of our own that is retained from compatability with older
user (La)TeX files, and a second one in /usr/bin from the software
vendor or distributor.]

It is important to remember that ARCH is not a single choice: it may
be that on personal machines such as private desktops and laptops, but
it is most certainly not at large installations.  At my site, we have
about 50 flavors of Unix available, and all of the TeX
Live-distributed ARCH values are in use, plus several more that I
build locally, and many of them are provided from a single fileserver.

So, let's keep /usr/local/texlive/YYYY as the default in Unix flavors;
it can be trivially changed at install time by any user who wants a
different choice (and it can even be moved somewhere else after
installation, thanks to relative path addressing in TeXware).

Interesting. The FAQ you are linking to mentions some BSD Unix flavors.
Can you be more specific? I *really* thought that all packaging
systems install *vendor* packages inot / or /usr, but not /usr/local.
That would be really brain damaged for a packaging system to
install vendor packages into /usr/local ...

Hmm, I don't agree completely that this is regrettable, actually
I use it regularly to override system/vendor libraries with
newer/different versions.

But that is off topic anyway.

In this dualistic universe, there are usually two or more valid ways
of cataloging something - in the case at hand either by specific file
functions (/bin, /man, etc.) or by specific package (e.g., Xorg,
TeX Live, etc. - the files' "parent" class).

The former view facilitates system performance by reducing path lookup
times and reducing the complexity of the directory trees while the
latter facilitates ease of system administration at the package level.
The larger and more complex the package, the more appealing the latter
approach becomes.

Although most all source compiled packages do install by default into
/usr/local, they usually do so by dispersing their individual files into
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man, etc., not by creating a new package
directory in /usr/local. That is what /opt is for.

I believe that /opt was created for large packages to facilitate their
quick and easy wholesale removal or update. Any package that "disperses"
many files into /usr, /usr/local, etc., can be difficult to remove or
update in the absence of a package manager application (e.g., rpm).

( BTW, for installing source compiled packages, porg should be given
serious consideration: http://porg.sourceforge.net/ )

As far as TeX Live goes, I believe that the real issue here may not be
so much a matter of default behavior, but rather simply one of
documentation and user visible installation options, suggestions and help.

It is OK to keep the defaults as they are, but the /opt option should be
presented to users during installation and maybe with a short mention of
the various views/opinions here and the tradeoffs of using each. 

In my own opinion, TeX Live is a near perfect example of the reason /opt
exists in the first place.
 

  Cheers,

  Mike Shell

It's debatable whether Homebrew counts as "vendor" or not (it
certainly is a package manager), but it installs packages to
/usr/local:

https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md

On-topic: maybe /opt is more appropriate nowadays (or would be if a
new decision would have to be met now), but I do not see a strong
enough reason to change the defaults now.

TeX Live 1 was released in 1996:

   ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive/

So TeX Live will be 20 years old next year and I suppose that the
birthday party takes place at TUG-2016 in Toronto.

Regarding /usr/local vs. /opt, I think that the current state is okay
because

 * the default installation directory is just a default value which
   can be changed easily at install time,

 * the whole texlive tree can be moved/copied to anywhere else at any
   time,

 * most users don't need the latest stuff and are using the TeX Live
   packages provided by their Unix/Linux distribution anyway,

 * many users already have many releases under
   /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/ and expect a new release there too.

There are a few other things to consider.  The /opt directory often
contains stuff maintained by the package manager and thus many people
prefer another directory for whatever they install themselves.  IMO
/usr/local is a good choice.

TeX Live was derived from teTeX and teTeX was released in 1994.  So
the default installation directory is /usr/local for more than
20~years and changing it now sounds very strange to me.

The good news is that nothing is carved into stone and everybody can
tell the installer where to install TeX Live.

Tristan, I understand your point, but I fear that a change causes a
lot of trouble because most users expect the current behavior,
regardless of any standards.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <CANQYN6weGhAXf6gaPPj-tU4874i7Rwp9aS6-cUZ5+C-RoQ=pCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

While testing a package of mine with various engines I came across a
difference in behaviour for euptex, which David Carlisle tracked down
to come from texlive's main texmf.cnf

% (e)up(La)TeX, and for upmpost
TEXINPUTS.uplatex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{uplatex,platex,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.uptex   = .;$TEXMF/tex/{uptex,ptex,plain,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.euptex  = .;$TEXMF/tex/{uptex,ptex,plain,generic}//

The last line does not end with a comma, which means that only
subdirectories of /tex/ are searched, and not /tex/ itself (as far as
I understand).  One file I needed was thus not found by euptex (but
was found by every other engine/format combination I tried).

Perhaps this should be fixed for TeXLive 2016.

Regards,

Bruno

Indeed.

No need to wait for 2016, we can update texmf.cnf via the normal
package upgrade mechanism.

Thanks for your report

Message-ID: <20150929200037.GA28236@hl.fritz.box>

Dear TL team,

I just noticed an "interesting" bug in TL 2015 with lualatex and fontspec, 
running on openSUSE Leap 42.1 (beta) and 13.2:

running "lualatex" on the following very minimal file creates 
aux and pdf files (and other output files in real example) but not the log file
with permission 0666 == world-writable:

     -rw-rw-rw- 1 harald users     8 Sep 29 21:50 t.aux

     -rw-r--r-- 1 harald users    88 Sep 29 21:38 t.tex

if fontspec is not loaded, permissions are ok (0644 with umask 0022).

	FreeBSD 9.3
Message-ID: <20150930023520.40520463@diaforum.se>

Hi,

The last six years I have installed TeX Live from the DVD and thereafter
used tlmgr to manage, update and uninstall the TeX Live software without
any problems at all. During these six years my operating system has
always been different versions of FreeBSD.

I got the TeX Collection 2015 DVD on August 28 and uninstalled TeX Live
2014 with tlmgr and reinstalled TeX Live 2015. This was done on
my workstation. After some days i tried to: tlmgr update --all and got
this error message:

Can't locate TeXLive/TLConfig.pm in @INC (you may need to install the 
TeXLive::TLConfig module) (@INC contains: /usr/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive

The same error occurred also on this laptop on which I have installed
TeX Live 2015 via install-tl-unx.tar.gz from the Internet. Both of my
computers runs FreeBSD 9.3 and both get the same error message when
trying to use the tlmgr. (All options I give tlmgr gives the same 
error about line 92.) All the other TeX software works fine, via
softlinks in /usr/local/bin to the actual binaries like xelatex, [XeTeX
3.14159265-2.6-0.99992 (TeX Live 2015)].

Thank you in advance for helping me,
Best Regards,

Conny

Hi,

The exact path to tlmgr.pl is not the only important thing, you must have
your executables in PATH. I see that tlmgr is not run from
/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/$ARCH but from /usr/local/bin. If you created
symlinks in /usr/local/bin during installation, it is OK. You should fist
try by ls -l /usr/local/bin/tlmgr whether it is a symlink to
/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/$ARCH/tlmgr where $ARCH is your architecture,
probably x86_64-linux. Missing file TLConfig.pm should be in
/usr/local/texlive/2015/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm

Is
	/usr/local/bin/tlmgr
a *link* to
	/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/$arch/tlmgr
?

My guess is that
	/usr/local/bin/tlmgr
is a link to
	/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
which does *NOT* work.

How did you set up the links? Did you use tlmgr to do that, or did
you use something else?

Nothing to do with file permissions, but rather to do with a typo in
expl3. This is already fixed and updated in TL (though it's not a TL
bug). Run "tlmgr update -all" and the issue will be sorted.

Yes, I did create symlinks via the CLI O & L options:

<L> create symlinks in standard directories:  [X]
            binaries to: /usr/local/bin
            manpages to: /usr/local/man
                info to: /usr/local/info

Yes it is a symlink to bin/i386-freebsd/tlmgr which in turn is an other
symlink pointing t?: 
tlmgr -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

Yes it is.

Yes it is, but that 'tlmgr' in turn is a symlink to tlmgr.pl:

ls -l /usr/local/bin/tlmgr 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  46 13 Sep 03:46 /usr/local/bin/tlmgr 
-> /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/i386-freebsd/tlmgr  

ls -l ../texlive/2015/bin/i386-freebsd/tlmgr
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  wheel  41 14 Aug  2014 ../texlive/2015/bin/i386-freebsd/tlmgr
 -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl  

(This is from my i386 labtop, but it also apply to my amd64
workstation, both computers complain about line 92 in tlmgr.)

No, not directly, but indirectly as shown above.

No not tlmgr. For the laptop on which I now write this answer, I
used install-tl-20150911 (folder to do an Internet install) and then the
perl script install-tl. In the following CLI dialog I choose its O
and then the L option to get: 

create symlinks in standard directories:  [X]
            binaries to: /usr/local/bin
            manpages to: /usr/local/man
                info to: /usr/local/info

The same CLI installation procedure was als? done on my workstation,
but there I only used the TeX Collection 2015 DVD to install via its
install-tl. All I did was to install Tex Live 2015 the same way as I
used for the last six years without any later problem with tlmgr.


Thanks Norbert,

Hi all,

I think I have found a bug in tlmgr.pl. In the BEGIN block $MAster is based
upon __FILE__ (line 59 and below). If the user has not created symlinks, it
is $TEXLIVE/2015/bin$ARCH/tlmgr and the two paths unshifted to @INC are
relative to it. However, if a symlink is created, __FILE__ is
/usr/local/bin/tlmgr and the paths unshifted are
/usr/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive and /usr/tlpkg as can be seen in the
oroginal message. This means that it is necessary to resolve the symlinks
and then make the paths relative to texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

As a temporary solution it is possible to call tlmgr by specifying the full
path in /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/$ARCH, it works.

Hi Zdenek, 

Yes your ad hoc, workaround works - nice and easy:

root at maya [/home/ataraxi] # perl /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/i386-freebsd/tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2015/tlpkg/backups
[ 1/36, ??:??/??:??] update: babel-welsh [115k] (30299 -> 38372) ... done
 and so on ...

Thank you very much Zdenek!

Best Regards,

Conny
