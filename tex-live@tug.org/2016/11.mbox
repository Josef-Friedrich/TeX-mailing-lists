Yes, that is the current setup. You cannot suppress this.

ah... ok I confess I found this link

http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012/archive/cowfont.tar.xz

on an internet forum of mixed reputation.

Now that I think about it the cowfont was perhaps already
there in my TL install, or at least accessible but I think
I didn't even checked or tried.

(side-note: actually I had to uncompress the archive and re-do it
after having replaced "context" in repertory names
 with "hoekwater/koeieletters"
and hacked the cowfont.tlpobj file to reflect this, in an attempt
to make the archive fully TDS compliant)

Hence to sum up, my experience is limited to this unique occasion
so far ;-)

best wishes,

Jean-Fran?ois

No, it isn't.  It is nonfree.

    http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012/archive/cowfont.tar.xz

The cowfont has had some nice updates recently. I suggest installing
context-minimals and simply extracting the font files by hand, if you
are in the mood to typeset with cows or sheep.

Hmmm ... sorry, unless a much more convincing argument comes up
I will refrain from implementing special measures.

OTOH, I agree that it would be great to have a tlmgr usable
archive of fonts not in TL, think the getnonfreefonts ones,
that can be used to install these fonts into TEXMFLOCAL
and then it might be a good idea. THus, maybe later.

Hi folks,

Re-installing TeX Live 2016 on one of my build servers, I 
have listed "collection-science" in my profile file, but the 
installation process is silently skipping it.

Is this a known issue / deliberate behaviour? A mod on 
tex.stackexchange.com says "it's down as 'auto-remove'" but 
I don't know what this means.

This collection contains some packages that I want.

Regards
Tom

Hi Karl,

Are you saying that I need to change my profile? This is quite a big breaking change, possibly for many people. Is there not a backwards-compatible solution for the changes you're trying to make?

Also, for future reference, what is the best way to find out about this sort of change?

Thanks,

Hi Liviu,

(moving this discussion to the TeX Live list as it has nothing
to do with texinfo anymore)

> no, I don't *need* to recompile the binaries, but past experience with many other packages showed that some tools are not very happy when moved to a different folder then the one they were compiled for, so, mainly for safety reasons, I generally prefer to build everything from sources, with the actual `--prefix` set correctly during `configure`.

TeX Live binaries are all fully relocatable, otherwise we could not
offer the freeness to install whereever you want. Relocatability
is one requirement to enter TeX Live binaries set.

> my current solution for the extra tools required by my macOS builds is a custom instance of Homebrew, installed in $HOME/opt/homebrew; since this is a custom location, Homebrew automatically builds everything from sources; unfortunately TeX is on the Homebrew blacklist, and the only solution is to use a Homebrew Cask, which is a workaround that installs MacTex as root, in the standard location, and adds it to the PATH. 

I don't know why it is on the Homebrew blacklist, as everything *can* 
be done. People only need to ask for help, *after* having tried and
read the install documentation.

> so any suggestions on how to do this will be welcomed.

As I said, the easiest way is:
* compile the binaries yourself if you want,
* but them into Master/bin/<YOUR_ARCH>
* run the normal installer

Alternatively you can hook copy all the files you need yourself, and
just make sure to generate the correct config files (fmtutil.cnf, 
updmap.cfg, language.dat, .def, .dat.lua) and all will run.

I did the following:

- downloaded install-tl-unx.tar.gz
- copied the texlive.profile from MacTex
- edited it to use my local paths

```
texlive_prefix="${HOME}/opt/texlive/"

tmp_profile=$(mktemp)

cat <<__EOF__ >> "${tmp_profile}"
# texlive.profile, copied from MacTex
TEXDIR ${texlive_prefix}
TEXMFCONFIG ${texlive_prefix}/texmf-config
TEXMFHOME ${texlive_prefix}/texmf
TEXMFLOCAL ${texlive_prefix}/texmf-local
TEXMFSYSCONFIG ${texlive_prefix}/texmf-config
TEXMFSYSVAR ${texlive_prefix}/texmf-var
TEXMFVAR ${texlive_prefix}/texmf-var
binary_universal-darwin 1
binary_x86_64-darwin 1
collection-basic 1
...
portable 0
__EOF__
```

- started the install with 

```
... install-tl-20161029/install-tl \
-no-gui -lang en \
-profile "${tmp_profile}" -v
```

after a while (a long while), the install was ready (I'm convinced there are lots of options that I'll never use; btw, is there any documentation for the various options in the profile?)

then I removed the /Library/TeX folder, the /usr/local/texlive folder, and lots of unwanted things from /usr/local/bin (I hate when tools used during my builds are in /usr/local, because I never know which tools the builds really use).

both qemu & openocd manuals were generated with this new setup, apparently without problems.


for completeness, the result is the `install-texlive.sh` script, available from:

	https://gist.github.com/ilg-ul/46407a070844f764dec6f27bde385797

any comments/suggestions?

Liviu

This is complete rubbish, I cannot even imagine who conjured this up
in a state of complete drunkness!

Any reasonable person can look into the bin directory and see that there
are definitely many different 64bit arch files.

Good idea.

Not so good without adaption

You should have edited a bit more ...

Yes, because about 4G have been downloaded from a CTAN mirror.

> the install was ready (I'm convinced there are lots of options that I'll never use; btw, is there any documentation for the various options in the profile?)

Not really, because the idea is to use the install-tl script interactively.

Not created by the install script but someone else.

> the /usr/local/texlive folder, 

Neither that has been created unless you specified this location as target.

Hmmm, you have 
	option_path 0
in your profile. Are you sure that this file in /usr/local/bin were
generated by the installer? It *should*not*. If option_path 0 is set,
then no adjustment is done whatsoever.

> both qemu & openocd manuals were generated with this new setup, apparently without problems.

Of course, because that is how TeX Live is installed on tens of thousands of machines.

> any comments/suggestions?

Yes, run the installer once interactively to see what you are
talking about in the profile.

Hope that helps

I'm convinced you are right, but, on the other hand, if you look at the MacPorts install scripts, they are **very** complicated, beyond normal user comprehension.

certainly, but, not knowing what I'm doing, I was a bit afraid of generating an incomplete setup.

any suggestions are welcome.

this idea is certainly useful to those who know what it is going on. since I'm not one of the blessed, I would probably have answered Yes to all questions, and got even more, if this is possible.

ah, sure, they were created by MacTex.

the story started some time ago, by installing TeX via MacPorts. I first tried the texlive-basic, but my builds failed. I tried several iterations to add more packages, but the builds continued to fail. quite annoyed, I finally installed texlive-full, and my builds passed.

recently I decided to give up using MacPorts and migrate to Homebrew. since Homebrew does not directly support Tex Live, I had to use the 'casked' version, which installs MacTex and adds some links.

I was horrified by the pollution degree, and this is how I reached here. (MacPorts installed everything in the desired location).


> run the installer once interactively to see what you are
> talking about in the profile.

I did. I discovered that some paths should point to the local $HOME folder.

otherwise I disabled the Arabic, Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages, and saved a few MB. big deal!

the main problem is that I have no idea what TeX features people use in the manuals I need to generate during the builds I run.

I also have TeX installed in the Debian Docker images I use for the builds. in Docker I Installed texlive-full too (with "apt-get -y install texinfo texlive"), but the result was shorter, about 2 GB if I remember right; I'd be happy to identify the extra packages I selected this time, and remove them.


regards,

Liviu


p.s. as a personal remark, the interactive install is definitely not for faint-hearted 'civilians'...

How come is it not good? There are 4 GB worth of packages. Why is downloading 
that not good? If you want a small selection, you should select a smaller 
selection using the interactive scripts, but then, often, you will have to 
install a package in between when you need it anyway. So, by default, it is 
full.

Jumping in here to state that I think, if you're going to 
allow "profiles", quite simply their syntax and features 
should be documented.

I'm glad that profiles exist (not everybody wants to do 
things interactively - consider automation), but I've 
struggled a lot with the lack of documentation as well.

    Are you saying that I need to change my profile? 
    
I guess so. Norbert, this actually seems like the place where we could
do better: suppose a scheme-full (or scheme-anything) installation,
without any further customization of collections in install-tl. I think
the profile as written should not contain any collection lines, just the
scheme line. Then, for people who use a scheme, changing collections has
no impact. Wdyt?

    This is quite a big breaking change, 
    
I have to admit that editing one line in one text file, that you are
obviously cognizant of, does not seem "big" to me.

Or, per above, you can delete all the collection lines (assuming you
installed exactly some scheme) and then you don't have to worry about it
in the future.

    possibly for many people. 

We have changed collections many times over many years, and they will
continue to change, slowly but surely. You are the first person to
complain about this, that I can remember anyway.
    
    Is there not a backwards-compatible solution for the changes you're
    trying to make?

No, because the whole purpose of the change is to simplify things by
having one less meaningless choice.

    Also, for future reference, what is the best way to find out about
    this sort of change?

Sorry, I don't know. rsync the tlpsrc directory and look for changes in
the list of collection-* files? Get the commit mail, or svn log, or an
svn checkout of tlpsrc, and filter similarly?  --best, karl.

I don't know what a scheme is.

It may only be one line to fix it, but the effect is absolute failure - almost none of my docs built any more due to suddenly missing packages. Also, the failure was completely silent at the installation phase (the installation should have error'd out rather than just ignoring the removed collection) and I had to update and rebuild all 6 build server configurations in order to get usable systems again.

That is a big breaking change.

Every day? Every week?

Ideally breaking changes would be announced on a mailing list, or in release notes.

I haven't looked at this for a while, and will check it later to see whether it's improved since, but when I first built my profiles I found that this correspondance was only implicit and undocumented. I had to build my profile by trial and error, ultimately.

A simple reference of syntax and supported statements would be appropriate.

Hi all,

too many emails, so just a few lines:
* profiles have never been ment to be a general purpose tool for 
  installation, but mostly to enable restart of interrupted ones.
  I know they are used a lot now.

* I will improve profile handling in the installer:
  - better support to create them from the installer
  - warning/error when wrong keys are included
  - short explanation of syntax of the file

> I don't know what a scheme is.

Sorry, if you don't know what a scheme is then I am a bit
surprised - did you ever install TeX Live yourselft?

> It may only be one line to fix it, but the effect is absolute failure - almost none of my docs built any more due to suddenly missing packages. Also, the failure was completely silent at the installation phase (the installation should have error'd out rather than just ignoring the removed collection) and I had to update and rebuild all 6 build server configurations in order to get usable systems again.

It is not an absolute failure only because your documents do not compile.
You asked to install a set of collection and they were dutifully installed.

> That is a big breaking change.
> Ideally breaking changes would be announced on a mailing list, or in release notes.

People using TeX Live normally, that is install it and update it via
tlmgr, will not even realize a change, because everything is handled
transparently.

So this is not such an earth shattering change you might feel it is.
Only those very few that use profiles to install on a daily basis
and have profiles that might be incomplete might see a change...

Don't overdo it, stay calm.

We will still improve in this area, don't worry.

Norbert

Hi Liviu,

> I'm convinced you are right, but, on the other hand, if you look at the MacPorts install scripts, they are **very** complicated, beyond normal user comprehension.

I don't know where this script is, but I also have no intention
to fix up bad scripts for OSs I don't use ;-)

Why What? You asked to install all of TeX Live, and you got all
of TeX Live. Yes, that is it.

You could have read the installation document that describes all the options?
Normally reading documentation if one does not understand something helps.

> I did. I discovered that some paths should point to the local $HOME folder.

Yes, TEXMFVAR and TEXMFCONFIG are normally user specific.

> otherwise I disabled the Arabic, Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages, and saved a few MB. big deal!
>

Then install all of TeX Live and stop worrying about it.

> I also have TeX installed in the Debian Docker images I use for the builds. in Docker I Installed texlive-full too (with "apt-get -y install texinfo texlive"), but the result was shorter, about 2 GB if I remember right; I'd be happy to identify the extra packages I selected this time, and remove them.

That is not complete TeX Live, on the Debian side you need to install
	texlive-full
to get a similar experience. `texlive' is only a meta-package that installs
the '*-recommended' collections.

> p.s. as a personal remark, the interactive install is definitely not for faint-hearted 'civilians'...

One can use the GUI
	install-tl -gui perltk
or for the complete dummy, the wizard:
	install-tl -gui wizard
(default on Windows) to get simpler versions.

If you have any suggestion for improvement, we are happy to hear them,
but please be specific! General "I don't like it" etc is not helpful
for improvement.

Thanks

Norbert

Yes, many times - I am simply missing some terminology. I 
will research what a "scheme" is.

Sorry but, no, they weren't! collection-science was silently 
/not/ installed, and it contained packages upon which I 
relied. An announcement on a mailing list that this would 
cease to work would have given me notice to update my 
profiles at a quiet and convenient time.

As it was, I only noticed this because I had to do an 
emergency rebuild of the server profiles for another reason, 
then the TeXLive rebuild didn't work as expected and this 
occurred at the worst possible time!

I concede that doing an install-latest-from-web in what is 
supposed to be a reproducible build server image is not 
ideal, and that's my fault. Eventually I want to have proper 
self-contained installs. Eventually, I will probably end up 
archiving TeXLive 201n locally and rebuild from that. If 
install-tl-unx.tar.gz were versioned then I could at least 
download a specific, known-good version and avoid exposing 
myself to breaking changes like this, but the web download 
doesn't seem to work that way.

Anyway, I'm glad that the cause has been determined and 
things will improve a little in the future.

Thanks for your help.

Cheers
Tom

Even with a versioned install- nothing would change, because this is solely information obtained from the server. If you want something 100% the same you have to archive all of tlnet at a certain point in time.

the installer offers the following choices:

```
Select scheme:

 a [X] full scheme (everything)
 b [ ] medium scheme (small + more packages and languages)
 c [ ] small scheme (basic + xetex, metapost, a few languages)
 d [ ] basic scheme (plain and latex)
 e [ ] minimal scheme (plain only)
 f [ ] ConTeXt scheme
 g [ ] GUST TeX Live scheme
 h [ ] infrastructure-only scheme (no TeX at all)
 i [ ] teTeX scheme (more than medium, but nowhere near full)
 j [ ] XML scheme
 k [ ] custom selection of collections
```

which one is the equivalent of the Debian 'texlive' package, that you named the '*-recommended' collection? the 'medium' one?

I searched the texlive-en.pdf manual and could not find this information.

since Debian is generally a good reference, I would like to have on my Mac the same features as on Debian, after "apt-get -y install texlive".

FYI, none of them work on macOS, Apple does not provide Tk in the default setup:

Please check yourself:
	apt-cache show texlive | grep Depends
and you will get:
	Depends: texlive-latex-recommended (>= 2016), texlive-fonts-recommended (>= 2016), texlive-latex-base (>= 2016)
That means you would get
	collection-latexbase
	collection-latexrecommended
	collection-fontsrecommended
	collection-base
This is not comparable to any scheme we ship in Debian.

Because texlive-en.pdf is the documentation of TeX Live as shipped originally
by TUG.

Debian repackages TeX Live to comply with Debian packaging requirements.

That can be worked around, but I am not a Maccy.

All the best

FWIW, TeX Live Utility on the Mac will give you a graphical interface of sorts, but it's really only checkboxes for the profile options and a way to change the install path. You have to enable it via a hidden preference, described in TLU's Help book (read it via the Help menu).

Hi Norbert,
you don't need a MacIntoy.  For testing it's sufficient to temporary
rename Tk.pm.

The "problem" isn't Mac specific.  I just invoked install-tl --gui
on my server (Raspberry Pi with Debian Jessie) and got the same message.

BTW, there is neither Perl/Tk nor X11 installed on this machine and the
installer continued in text mode.  This is great and IMO a very
important feature.  The warning message is ugly but harmless though.

Replacing Perl's warning message is certainly a good idea because most
users expect a less verbose and more comprehensible message.

Norbert, if you intend to replace the message, I recommend to name the
package "perl-tk" rather than "Perl/Tk" because the former name is
used by most Linux package managers.  If an OS/X user invokes
install-tl --gui it's better to point him to MacTeX instead of
suggesting to install Perl/Tk.

Regards,
  Reinhard

perhaps TeX Live Utility, not MacTeX ?

after all, if the user wants MacTeX she doesn't worry about install-tl !

and the command line interface of install-tl is already quite graphical
of sorts with easily understood one letter or one digit commands, it is not
purely "on one line".

only problem I ever experienced is that I had to increase the number
of rows of my Terminal (on mac os x) to see the whole thing.

IMHO

My Gentoo system is definitely not up-to-date but I get

  $ emerge --search perl-tk
  *  dev-perl/perl-tk

instead of 

  dev-perl/Tk

Can anybody with a recent Gentoo release clarify?

Dear Nelson,
thank you for the info.  This clearly confirms that my Gentoo system
is not up-to-date.  On all other machines I'm using CentOS, Debian,
and Ubuntu and update regularly.  But updating Gentoo takes much more
time than I have ATM.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] strange behaviours in xetex and xdvipdfmx in MacTeX 2016
Message-ID: <3B7D58DD-C471-4F69-A1A0-D7DF4033E64E@me.com>

Hello,

I encountered the fact that xetex and xdvipdfmx in MacTeX2016 does
not recognise old true type font like "Lucida Sans", while it does
new ttc fonts like "Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN".

I also noticed that they ignores \addfontfeatures{CJKshape=JIS90}
while \fontspec[CJKshape=JIS90]{Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN} has no
problem to provide old font shape in Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN.

These behaviours were not present in MacTeX2013 - the very stable
version of MacTeX, and therefore I forced to use MacTeX2013.

Could you fix these difficulties in the next release of MacTeX?

Best, Norio

Message-ID: <C1415809-D15D-4B4E-8FC3-1E02159DD36A@gmail.com>

Hello CTAN team (cc: TeXLive list),

I'd like to request a new feature to CTAN package submission system,
that is "package dependency" entry field.

Currently, we don't have any generic interface for package contributers
to specify dependency on CTAN. This is sometimes problematic.
For example, newtx depends on kastrup, and luatexja depends on filehook.
However, both cases cannot be resolved by current tlmgr. The dependency
seems to be resolved manually by TeX Live team in some cases (e.g.
beamer depends on pgf), but it's getting harder and harder to set all
dependencies correctly by hand.

Of course the package authors can describe its dependency in README
or something, but it would be better if CTAN adds a new generic
form field to encourage the authors to do that in more explicit way.
It would be even better if TeX Live can import the dependency tree
automatically;)

 I agree that a system to describe dependencies would
 be an extremely useful thing to have.

 However, starting with an additional input field on the upload
 page would not solve that problem, from our point of view,
 because the question would remain of what to do with the
 additional information thus gained, i.e. where and how to
 store it.

 For CTAN, the answer to the last question would probably
 be quite clear:  introduce a new, optional, "depends" element
 for Catalogue entries.   I think we should discuss this
 internally.  Personally, I cannot find anything to say against
 it, exept that it must be understood that these can only be
 _hints_; we will never be able to provide a complete
 classification of all > 5000 Catalogue entries with respect
 to dependencies. 

 Once we would have that new Catalogue field, and the
 corresponding _output_ on the webpage, the _input_ question
 could be solved in a more or less formalized way.
 "Announcement text" and "notes to maintainers" would be
 sufficient, IMHO, but that's a secondary question.

    Just my 2cents
        Petra

Message-ID: <7acc7205-7918-256e-e322-4b7a4ac8e0d9@morningstar2.co.uk>

Hello all,

As many people will know, the LaTeX team have developed an expandable
FPU as part of expl3. That gets quite a bit of use, but one area we
can't currently address is random numbers. The pgf bundle has a
pseudo-random number generator, but that can't be expandable (you need
to track the seed). The usefulness of pseudo-random numbers has come up
a few times recently, and so we'd like to address this. (Expandable
floating point evaluation is pretty handy as an end user!)

Both pdfTeX and LuaTeX include a series of primitives that expose a
lower-level pseudo-random number generator (I assume from C: there is
very little actual code in the pdfTeX WEB source to implement these).
That gives us a way of providing expandable random numbers at the macro
level, but at present will be limited to those engines. As this is
something of an 'extra' (not core functionality), we will at present
accept that it's not doable in XeTeX/e-(u)pTeX (and issue an error if
requested), but it would be handy if the functionality could find its
way into those engines.

For reference, the 'full set' of primitives in this area is

- \(pdf)uniformdeviate
- \(pdf)normaldeviate
- \(pdf)randomseed
- \(pdf)setrandomseed

(LuaTeX drops the 'pdf' part of the names.)

Hello Hironobu,

    For example, newtx depends on kastrup, 

aka binhex.tex. Somewhat surprising to me, but ok, I see it.
I added it.

    and luatexja depends on filehook.

But, at least at a glance, only if array is not already loaded.

Therefore I would not recommend that luatexja unconditionally depend on
filehook -- one such case might not matter, but imagine if every package
listed every other package that it *might* load, across all engines and
all formats. You might as well install everything in the first place and
be done with it. Which is, not coincidentally, already the default.

As I've said before, conditional dependencies in the TeX world seem like
a problem beyond the state of the art. Debian's "weak depends" would not
be helpful, and I don't know of anything in practice that's gone beyond
that. It seems to me the only true solution is to load packages at
runtime a la MiKTeX, and that is an unsolved (and not easy) problem for TL.
New developers welcome :).

     it's getting harder and harder to set all
     dependencies correctly by hand.

It's no harder than it ever was: it's always been impossible, and it
will remain impossible :). It is not and cannot be a goal to list every
dependency. It's delusionary to think it can be done.

    seems to be resolved manually by TeX Live team in some cases 

It is effectively the authors (and users) who do it now -- they send
dependency information (like you just did), I (and Christian for MiKTeX
I suppose) add dependencies as is useful.

I have nothing in principle against the proposed CTAN field, as long as
it used for unconditional dependencies. Meaning something the package
requires every time it is loaded, with any engine. Anything other than
that is a slippery slope that will lead to more problems than benefit,
as far as I can see.

There are various possibilities for automatically determining
dependencies, going along autotesting packages. For example,
auto-creating a minimal document, running with -recorder (across
engines), and going through the output. It's an easy idea to have, not
such an easy idea to find time to actually implement. --best, karl.

Since all *TeX engines on Unix(-like) systems these days are built on
C code originally translated from the Pascal sources, it should be
possible to supply an interface in all such engines to a C-library
random-number generator.

Because the historical rand() is often platform-dependent, and poor,
I'd recommend the POSIX drand48() family, which is available on all
systems these days (and I can supply portable code if you feel the
need for it).  It repairs some of the defects of 32-bit linear
congruential generators, and should be able to deliver the same stream
of random numbers from a given starting seed on all platforms.

It is imperative that users be able to supply an initial seed, because
otherwise, it is not possible to generate independent streams of
random numbers of successive runs, such as might be needed for
multiple simulations.

However, the default seed should always be a constant, rather than one
dependent on time, process-id, or other internal data; that way,
successive runs are reproducible.  Unreproducible output may make
debugging impossible.

If you want to improve the quality of the generator beyond what
drand48() produces, contact me offlist for details of a simple
extension that costs almost nothing extra, yet dramatically lengthens
the period and reduces correlations between the output random numbers.

pdfTeX and LuaTeX *already have primitives* that generate random
numbers: I'm no C/WEB/... programmer but from pdftex.web I think it's
likely to be using rand() ultimately. Getting the same result from
pdfTeX and other engines on the same platform is what seems to me to be
important.

Note that the reason for asking about this is to allow pseudo-random
numbers for the type of thing that does make sense from inside a TeX
run. Examples are adding 'interest' in graphics, picking 'm from n
questions' in a list, etc. Being able to set the seed is useful (and
indeed implemented in pdfTeX/LuaTeX), but highly statistically
satisfying randomness is not. (I've never tested the pdf macro-based
implementation, but it's likely to be a balance between having some
'randomness' and being reasonable in TeX macros.)

Can you please elaborate on the usefulness of pseudo-random numbers in
a typesetting engine? I think it is a good thing to add features but
those features should be added for some good reason.

Indeed.

I've seen a variety of use cases for pseudo-random values, in particular
two which come up reasonably often. The first is selecting entries from
a larger 'pool' of values, for example for creating test papers. ('Use 5
out of the 20 questions I've written, picked at random'.) The second,
probably more common, case is in creating figures (for example using
TikZ). Depending on what one is representing, an element of
(pseudo)randomness is useful.

These use cases are beyond what might call the 'classical' idea of what
TeX is for, in the sense one could do them (and other uses) by hand or
using another tool and import into TeX. However, the programmable nature
of TeX attracts use in these ways. One can generate pseudo-random
numbers at the macro level, most obviously in the pgf package, and this
facility is used by many people. (My own use case for random values, in
creating some figures, uses the pgf implementation.) However, the need
to track the seed value to allow a pseudo-random sequence of values
means that any macro-based implementation is necessarily non-expandable.
The experience of the team with \fp_eval:n, the expandable FPU of the
expl3 bundle, suggests that expandable calculations are useful. In that
context, it would be nice to be able to offer some random value
abilities. (As noted at the start of this thread, that is already
possible in pdfTeX and LuaTeX and we will likely add something to the
FPU which currently will work with those engines only.)

Thank you very much for your prompt response. I would say that
this feature makes the typesetting engine more independent and
this is definitely a good thing. Also, I think it should be
implemented using the drand48 function as Neelson has already
suggested.

For the majority of "use cases", you just want a way to ensure that
packages
(with the appropriate version) needed for a specific task are installed.
Most users at my institute have either MiKTeX or a linux distro's telxlive
package.   MikTeX's on-the-fly package loading is nice when you have
Internet access, but users often want to work on documents in off-hours
while at sea or in the field with either zero or expensive Internet access.
They start with some existing template that worked on their desktop,
only to find that some packages are missing or outdated on the laptop
in the field.

The majority of these cases start with a publisher's journal or report
style/class.  Maybe it makes sense to have meta-packages for these
journal or report styles/classes.

This is really best done by maintainers of packages like a journal or
report style/class, but as you indicate, tracking dependencies is not
practical so it has to done by providing lists of packages
required, recommended, or suggested (e.g., commonly used by
authors) for use with a specific class.

Now that MiKTeX has repackaged things to be closer to texlive,
such lists might be useful on both texlive and MiKTeX.

Dear all,

I think the suggestion of Hironobu is a good idea, but we might
want something better...

This is what I have talked about and would like to implement:
* strong dependency:
	the package is loaded in any case
	(think of a \RequirePackage at the toplevel)
* weak dependency (suggest?):
	the package is loaded only under some circumstances
	(extra options, other packages loaded, ...)

We would like to have at least the strong ones reflected in the
texlive.tlpdb, but this is not trivial.

One approach would be to automatically (i.e., someone (me?) needs
to write code) generate test documents for many different classes
of packages/files, run them, examine the output of -recorder, and
derive strong dependencies from it.

Conceptually this is not difficult, there is already code to parse
the -recorder output in one of our scripts, so this should be an 
easy thing to *start* - but the devil is in the details ...

Anyway, I am with Karl - new developers are welcome - and we can 
provide guidance on how to start and work with it. Only that both
Karl and me are slightly overbooked ...

Best

Norbert

Hello,

Thanks for many replies to my proposal.

Of course I know, I don't want any perfect;) The new field is
only _encouraged_ (especially for "surprising" dependency)
and authors can decide whether to enter something or not.

Karl:

> It is effectively the authors (and users) who do it now -- they send
> dependency information (like you just did), I (and Christian for MiKTeX
> I suppose) add dependencies as is useful.

I don't think current procedure of adding "depend" to texlive.tlpdb
manually is sustainable. The package author uploads somepkg to
ctan, wait for texlive to include it, and send an email to Karl for
additional "strong dependency". The author have to send the
similar email to MiKTeX, and all the other distributors...?

Another thing to consider is that tlmgr (official script in texlive)
is not the only way of package management. When a user installs
texlive using platform-specific manager (apt-get or port), the
execution of tlmgr is almost disabled. Update and resolving package
dependency is left to each maintainer of the platform specific
packaging, so "depend" entry in texlive.tlpdb may no be referred
at all. This would mean duplication of effort in the worst case.

George:

I dindn't know much about MiKTeX, but on-the-fly package loading
seems useful. But, as you say, it would still happen that some
dependent package is missing while internet access is unavailable.

Norbert:

I've also read the previous discussion on tex-live list.
That would be very useful, but will require a lot of work.

I thought it would be better if the upstream, CTAN, takes some
new action. It may benefit all the distributions, including official
TeX Live, MiKTeX and platform-specific ones. Of course this
request would demand a lot of work to be done by CTAN team
and others, so I don't insist on the change. It's a mere suggestion,
so any better ideas are welcome.


Best,
Hironobu

I'm not *against* an improved approach, but the work needed for 'a new
implementation in pdfTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX, ...' is greater than 'add
more-or-less the current implementation from pdfTeX and LuaTeX to XeTeX,

OK please let me know how the pdftex thing is implemented and I will do the
thing with drand48. Then people can check the implementation, etc.

 If we add to the Catalogue new fields describing package
 dependencies, users will expect this information to be more or
 less _accurate_ and _complete_.  However, given our resources
 (or lack thereof) it is completely impossible to achieve either
 the one or the other.  Therefore, we would not like to
 introduce such a formal structure but rather accept author's
 hints and relate them, informally, in the last paragraph of the
 description text, as is done already whenever the author
 provides such information in the announcement.

 And, yes, authors should be encouraged to provide such
 information; but another field on the upload form (which 
 is already rather crowded) would probably not be the right
 way and would hardly meet the approval of our webmaster.

   Petra, hoping that authors reading this discussion may
          consider this aspect for future submissions and
          that others may follow their example.

Do you want a blog post on this? I can probably write something helpful,
not just from the CTAN data angle.

 Sounds to me like a good idea.

 As long as we don't get submerged, all of a sudden, by hundreds
 of requests ...   ;-)

 Just considering the matter for regular uploads and adding
 _once_  a "Note to the CTAN maintainers" with the information
 to be added to the package description would be perfect.

Subject: [tex-live] Difficulties in Rewriting the Core TeX WEB Code
Message-ID: <3788802.0h3PnnYriH@wadner>

Hi,

I was recently reading the discussion of adding a random number generator to 
the TeX programs on this mailing list. There, someone mentioned the probable 
need for changing the core TeX WEB code and not being thoroughly excited by 
it. 

My feeling is, it would be better to have the core TeX WEB code in a more 
modern format, however the idea apparently has very little traction (most 
probably due to very good reasons).

From what I understand, the WEB code (equivalently, the corresponding C code 
generated with the WEB2C compiler) has been almost unchanged for quite a few 
years now and all development is actually done on top of it using it as a 
black box. No one has tried rewriting it and it seems certainly not been due 
to the lack of manpower. 

So, my question is:
1. Would it be really more desirable to rewrite TeX WEB Code in more modern 
format (C, C++, Python, Haskell, Lua)? Would this generally lead to better 
package dependencies in flavors like LuaTeX? 

2. If the answer is even a little bit of yes, how does one start? Are there 
tests (example TeX file which should be successfully parsed) which are written 
to verify the implementation of TeX interpreter. I have been looking at the 
sources of the TeXLive distribution, and there do seem to be one or two files 
in the web2c part, but I'm not sure if they are enough.

There is LuaTeX, which contains TeX's WEB code translated to C and improved.

Which problem do you want to solve?

People using a fixed seed to get reproducible results would not be
well served by a change in the random number generator. Just because
something would be easy to change doesn't mean that change is always a
good idea.

A document using a fixed seed would have been generating reproducible
results with pdftex since these functions were added more than ten
years ago.

Changing the source isn't the issue, are you offering also to help
with user support to manage the change
and explain to people why it's not possible to re-create documents
that they created before they updated
their tex system?

That said, if you want to look, the version in pdftex is

@* \[7b] Random numbers.

starting at line 2507 of  source/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/pdftex.web

Sometimes change is necessary but here it really isn't clear that the
statistical properties of drand48 are superior to Knuth's algorithm
from metafont  (I've never seen any comparison of these, only between
drand48 and C rand)
Or whether any of these algorithms have any real flaws when used with
sequence lengths of the sort realistically
practical in a tex document.

By following this conservative line of thought, we should
not use OpenType fonts and stick to plain old but good Type 1
fonts! In fact, I would recommend dropping support for Type 1
fonts from XeTeX. If you want Type 1 fonts, use the ancient
engines. Also, each TeX destribution comes with all these
TeX-based engines. So these people can always use their
ancient files with no problem!

No, not at all. There is a big difference between offering new functionality
and offering existing functionality. when implementing existing tex features.

xetex (far more than luatex) follows tex very closely, so that in the
main, if you are
not using the extended features it works exactly like tex. All I am
suggesting is that
design philosophy should apply here.

Er no, That was entirely the point of my message.
I was replying to your offer to change the sources of pdftex. If that were done
people would _not_ be able to use their ancient (or even not ancient)
files and get the same results.

Existing functionality is something that is already there
but this discussion is on because this functionality is
not included in XeTeX. Also, this is not a TeX feature but
a pdfTeX feature!

That is why they ship all these different programs!
If all programs had the same functionality, there would
be no need to include them in the same distribution.
You simple want XeTeX and others to follow what you
think is correct. I just said that it is good idea
to provide this functionality but we/they should implement
it the way we/they like. You want pseudo-random number, you
will get them.

>> No one has tried rewriting it [TeX's Web code] ...

That is incorrect.  In the 1990s, there was a ground-up rewrite of TeX
in Java, but that project never received distribution.

More recently, there is a completely new implementation, JSBox, that
passes the trip test, allowing it to call itself TeX (though it
doesn't do so).  See

	Doug McKenna
	On tracing the {\tt trip} test with {{\tt JSBox}}
	TUGboat 35(2) 157--167
	https://www.tug.org/2014/slides/mckenna-literac.pdf
	https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb35-2/tb110mckenna.pdf
	https://www.tug.org/tug2014/slides/mckenna-JSBox.pdf

TeX's long use (since 1977--1978) is due to the high quality, and
portability, of its code.  Because it was developed in a time of small
computer memories (256KB RAM, or less), its designer had to make many
economizations that make the code more intricate that one would like.
Doug McKenna's clean-room implementation aims to be suitable for
64-bit machines, and eliminates many of the aggravating limits of the
original design.

However, any replacement for TeX will have to maintain compatibility
with millions, perhaps billions, of existing documents. If you just
want a new typesetting system, there are several wordprocessors that
could be used: they just do a poor job, particularly for mathematics.
And worse, they offer no document stability, since most are
proprietary, undocumented, and change unpredictably from time to time.
With TeX, I have recently retypeset documents from the 1980s without
issue.

Dear Hironobu,
as you already recognized, if it can't be done automatically (by
parsing the code) it's an enourmous amount of work.  I would have
second your suggestion one or two decades ago.  But disk space is very
cheap today.  In a few years internet access will also be much faster
and nobody will care about a few Gigabytes of disk space.  Thus I fear
that all the effort is in vain because very few people will make use
of the suggested features in the near future and honor your efforts.

It's already recommended to use scheme-full and the situations where a
customized installation is *really* necessary are quite rare. 

One could claim that TeX Live is modular and thus should maintain all
of it's dependencies properly.  Well, the decision to make TeX Live
modular was made two decades ago when disk space was very expensive.

I'm sure that most people simply install scheme-full as recommended
and am sure that all the effort regarding package dependencies will
not be honored at all in the near future.

Hironobu, I agree with you that dependency management is't perfect but
I'm also convinced that everything which requires manual operations is
unfeasible.  Changing the CTAN upload form doesn't help because many
packages will never be updated at all.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi everyone - I'm planning to make infrastructure changes to tug.org
this Friday morning, in my (US/Pacific) morning. So don't be alarmed if
tug is off the air for a while, and/or there is a failure of the
nightly TL update for a day or two this weekend. It will all work out in
the end, one way or another.

Specifically, tug.org is moving to a new site (!), so there will be a
new IP address. I'll send out another message after the move with the
specifics, but wanted to give a heads-up early.

It bears repeating at every opportunity: \hbox{thanks}^\infty to Arhus
and all the people involved for hosting tug.org there for the last many
(many) years.

Message-ID: <ae8c8d10-73e4-c3cf-9434-11727572c04c@simon-cozens.org>

Hello there!

You may know that I have extracted the PDF generation parts of dvipdfmx
into libtexpdf which is used by the SILE typesetter. So far I have been
trying to avoid messing with the code too much to avoid maintaining a
divergant fork, but now I am starting to add SVG-in-OpenType support to
SILE.

The way that SVG-in-OpenType works is that for each glyph string you
want to set, you go and look in the fonts' SVG table and see if there is
an entry for each glyph ID. If there is, the entry is an SVG graphic
which you render in place of the glyph. If there isn't, you use the CFF
or TTF outlines in the usual way. Of course the proper place to put this
is within the PDF generation layer; it's a function of rendering string
+ font to produce PDF output, which is what the backend of dvipdfmx
(pdf_dev_set_string and friends) does.

I've started hacking libtexpdf to do this, but it's kind of messy - you
need to add an SVG parser and also code to render SVG into PDF drawing
instructions. But I have something that more or less works.

If I come up with a patch to dvipdfmx to add support for
SVG-in-OpenType, would there be any interest in merging it?

(Ideally, it would be great if at some point dvipdfmx moved to use the
libtexpdf abstraction so we could share all this stuff more easily, but
last time I tried to do that I got caught up with kpse stuff and it
wasn't very easy to test.)

Hi Simon,

My personal opinion is that yeah, please go ahead. dvipdmfx is nowadays
maintained in TeX Live without any outside activity, contributors are
few, mostly the Japanese developers fixing bugs.

I would say go ahead, as long as current documents don't break it is
completely fine.

Also this would be very advisable in this case, and I guess we can sort
the problems with libkpse out.

All the best

Norbert

Hi all,

if I understand it well, Simon offers another thing. The OpenType fonts can
exist in several formats, Type1-flavoured, TrueType-flavoured,
SVG-flavoured. It seems to me that he wants to add support for
SVG-flavoured OpenType fonts.

Yes, that's right - fonts like Emoji Color One and Trajan Color Concept.
I'm talking about supporting the OpenType "SVG " table.

Right! I shall get on this.

Here is the best I could do with it, a version of dvipdfmx which
separates out the PDF generation backend from the DVI handling front-end:

https://github.com/simoncozens/dvipdfm-x/tree/libtexpdf

It works beautifully on an xdv created with xetex using OT fonts. Within
the libtexpdf submodule there is also a file called "library-poc.c"
which demonstrates using the libtexpdf library to create a PDF file with
an OT font; I've also been using the library successfully with SILE for
a few years. It's the best PDF generation library I've seen available.
(Thank you!)

But it will fail horribly on TeX fonts because of the kpse issues. It's
been a long time since I looked at why (and to be honest I was pretty
confused when I was looking), but I think the problem was to do with
creating the correct fontmap record for the located file: font names,
TeX names and file names all need to line up. I don't understand well
enough to do much more with it and I am finding it hard to test because
for some reason building it on my system doesn't use the local texmf.cnf
properly. Hopefully it will make sense to someone.

Does "libdpx" (included in the project below) have something to do with
libtexpdf? Or, is "libdpx" helpful to you?
https://github.com/clerkma/ptex-ng
The project ptex-ng is called "Asiatic pTeX", a TeX variant which derived from
Japanese upTeX (whose output is only DVI format; available from TeX Live)
and integrated dvipdfmx as a library into itself.

Interesting - I had not seen this! No, this is not related to libtexpdf
but obviously both of us had similar ideas.

I still think my idea is better (obviously!). ptexNg does not separate
out the PDF generation from the DVI processing, and it doesn't really
work as a hygienic library.

I think it's still worth trying to come up with a dvidpdfmx based on a
library like libtexpdf, because (if we can get it working) it gives a
clean separation of concerns between front and back end, as well as
providing a library which is generically useful for PDF generation in
other applications too.

Message-ID: <CAN0dEZw92KkNhzwxOc58EDLCQYjZMGe1X_Vgy--FjHvyXZK8+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
As part of trying to understand why some platex/dvipdfmx workflows no
longer worked after transition from TeX Live 2015 to 2106 (wrong DVI
bounding box), I read through all the documentation for TeX Live,
PDFTeX and the graphicx package.

Here are some suggestions to fix errors/unclear portions (unless I
have misunderstood the meaning) in the texlive-en.{html,pdf}
documentation.

Please see the accompanying text file for the raw bug list and
suggestions for improvement.

I also attach a dvips debug output for reference (one of the bugs
relates to this), no need to repeat experiment for the hard-working
volunteers who undertake the corrections.

Below I paste the contents of the corrections (not the dvips output
though) in-line into this email.

Best regards,
Gernot Hassenpflug
