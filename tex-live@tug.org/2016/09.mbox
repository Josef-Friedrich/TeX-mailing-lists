I have installed texlive 2016 with administrator rights. Today, I
experinced an error while updating. I wonder wether this will have
consequences. Please see the messages of texlive manger:

Hi Bernhard,
I don't know why the registry is involved here. Maybe Siep has a clue.

Did anybody else got the same message?

Can you check whether bitmap2eps.exe works?  If not, can you remove
the wintools package (using tlmgr) and install it again?   Do you get
the same complaint?

The wintools package was updated yesterday because I added PDF
versions of the fontconfig manual pages.  But I didn't touch anything
in texlive/2016/bin/w32/.

Everything worked fine when I updated TL yesterday on Linux.  Sure,
there is no annoying registry on Unix...

After all, it would be nice to know whether

 1. you are the only one who got this message,

 2. bitmap2eps works despite the message,

 3. if not, re-installation works without complaints,

 4. Siep has a clue.

Thanks for the report,
  Reinhard

I never managed to track down such failures to remove such registry
keys.  In all cases that I encountered, the connection with the file
extension WAS removed, so this failure was fairly harmless.

But in this case, since it concerned an update, the registry key
would have been recreated in any case.

By the way: bitmap2eps is a little wrapper script to convert bitmaps
to eps files which can be invoked by right-clicking a bitmap.

I am suspicious that something in the update process is causing this
error: If I look at

HKLM/Software/Classes/TL.DVIOUT.view.2016/shell/open/command the entry is
"k:\texlive\2016\bin\win32\dviout.exe" "%1"

in 
HKLM/Software/Classes/TL.bitmap2eps.convert.2016/shell/open/command the entry is
"K:\texlive\2016\bin\win32\bitmap2eps.exe" "%1" (with the drive letter in uppercase)

Whether this needs to be deleted, I can not judge. Is there any reason why this key has to be updated?
Regards
Bernhard

Subject: [tex-live]  status of Utah TeX Live 2016 binary archive
Message-ID: <CMM.0.96.0.1472837013.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

I continue to add new virtual machines to our test farm, and today,
added binary archives for the newly-released FreeBSD 12 and OpenBSD
6.0 (both on x86-64) to the site
	
	http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/

That increases the count to 102 distributions.

An attempt to build TeX Live 2016 on the new Fedora 25 (alpha) x86-64
failed with the default gcc (6.1.1 20160721 (Red Hat 6.1.1-4)) because
of an internal compiler failure in g++ while compiling the file.
texk/dvisvgm/dvisvgm-src/src/ToUnicodeMap.cpp.  Adding the -g option
to that step seemed to fix the problem, but the build again died.

I then switched to clang 3.8.0, but that failed in compilation of
libs/poppler/poppler-src/goo/GooList.cc.

Neither of these is a show stopper, because several other GNU/Linux
binary distributions work just fine.  Because this is an alpha
release, changes will be frequent. I'll retry the build as soon as I
notice an update in either gcc or clang.

By the way, within the last hour, clang 3.9.0 was announced:

I suppose this is just uninstall old + install new, without trying
to check which files or settings could remain unchanged.

Dear Philip,

> The suggestion by Akira-san resolves the problem :

It seems that I was wrong:

By experiments, I found that the renaming,
cachefile.NEW --> cachefile, almost always
fails if executed from the XeTeX binary even
in a user's writable directory.

Thus if you find a delay of time, run

fc-cache -v.

If messages
invalid cache file: ...
are shown, run

fc-cache -v

once more.

--- related function ---
FcBool
FcAtomicReplaceOrig (FcAtomic *atomic)
{
#ifdef _WIN32
    unlink ((const char *) atomic->file);
    /* fails always if executed from the XeTeX binary */
#endif
    if (rename ((char *) atomic->new, (char *) atomic->file) < 0)
    return FcFalse;
    return FcTrue;
}

Best,
Akira

Not particularly relevant to your problem, but in LFS (x86_64, no
32-bit, /lib64 as a symlink to /lib) the 2016 source built fine with
both gcc-6.1.0 and gcc-6.2.0.

Subject: [tex-live] binary distribution for TrueOS and TeX Live 2016 in O/S
 distros
Message-ID: <CMM.0.96.0.1472948738.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

I've just installed the 103rd binary distribution for TeX Live 2016 at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/

It is for TrueOS on x86-64

	https://www.trueos.org/
	https://www.trueos.org/handbook/introduction.html

which is the new name for PC BSD (for which a TeX Live 2016
distribution is also available):

	https://www.trueos.org/2016/09/01/pc-bsd-evolves-into-trueos/

TrueOS has a rolling-release model, so there are no O/S version
numbers.  It started with the recently-released FreeBSD 12.

The lead architect of TrueOS, Kris Moore, is also the co-host with
Allan Jude of BSD Now, a weekly TV podcast of 60 to 90 minutes each:

	https://www.bsdnow.tv/

As of this week, there have been 157 episodes, and I've had many
useful viewings from them.

Despite the newness of the DragonFlyBSD 4.7, FreeBSD 12 and TrueOS
releases, the default TeX versions in their software package systems
are still TeX Live 2015, and the brand new OpenBSD 6.0 only offers TeX
Live 2014.

However, ArchLinux (rolling release), Debian 8 (testing and unstable),
Fedora 24, 25, and Rawhide (rolling release), GNU Hurd 0.7, Solus

TeX Live binaries for FreeBSD should just work on TrueOS, if 'uname'
gives 'FreeBSD'. If not, a trivial change in TeX Live installation
script is needed to make it work.

Even FreeBSD-11 hasn't been released yet:
https://www.freebsd.org/releases/11.0R/schedule.html
AFAIR, FreeBSD-12 is just recently branched in SVN. Its release is
probably many years ahead.

Thank you -- further experiments after installing a further new font have indeed shewn this to be the case.  It would also seem that, in my case at least, that I have write access to the default location for FC_CACHEDIR so the effect of explicitly setting that to C:\TeX\Live\2016\FC_cache was to allow the initial creation of a new cache (which of course helped) but did not address the real problem that you have identified with :

#ifdef _WIN32
   unlink ((const char *) atomic->file);
   /* fails always if executed from the XeTeX binary */
#endif

Hi,

Is there any reason for the delay in updates. I tried three different
servers. While the update of platex and uplatex was there, the biber and
biblatex were not. Just curious.

Hi,

I have just discovered that the directory
http://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/Images contains a file README and a
link README.html pointing to it. The contents is (partially) HTML which isn't
looking good in the portal. I asume that the two files are mirrored to CTAN.

I propose to replace the file README by README.md and use markdown instead of
HTML. The link can be omitted.

Ciao

Gerd - the reason I created that peculiar setup is so there could be
live links when visiting /Images via ftp on tug or ctan or mirror sites.
Switching to Markdown would make ctan.org http pages prettier, but at
the cost of losing live links everywhere else, so that doesn't seem
good.  I wouldn't mind switching (back) to plain text and not have live
links anywhere.  I was just trying to be helpful to users.  -k

I understand your intentions. In this case I propose the following solution:

- Delete the link README.html
- Rename README to README.htlm
- Add a new file README.md with the same content and formatted as markdown

Then everybody would be happy. The ftp users could still read README.html in the
browser and the visitors on ctan.org would see the text immediately in a
readable form.

Another minor remark on the current HTML file
- The file does not contain a valid HTML file contents. At least the doctype is
missing. For older browsers <html>, <head>, and <body> would be nice. Not
everybody understands HTML5, yet.

Ciao

In this case and in similar cases a call like this

   pandoc --from markdown --to html --standalone \
     README.md --output README.html

may be useful to create a html file based on a markdown file.

Well, in this case it's just the other way around. The HTML file exists and the
markdown file is needed. (and note that pandoc knows nothing about the CTAN
dialect of markdown;-)

In fact I have discovered another trick. For TeXlive it should be enough to
simply rename README to README.md and adjust the link accordingly. Unfortunately
this reveals a bug in the CTAN markdown implementation. I will have a look into
it this evening...

All of these proposals make more work for me.  When it's important, I
don't mind, but this case is not important.  It's just one tiny file
with generic information that hardly anyone looks at.  So I don't want
to maintain it in multiple formats or generate different formats.  I
just want to edit one simple file and be done with it.

So I converted it (by hand :) to Markdown.  We'll see what it looks like
when it hits CTAN.  -k

Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.20.1609180252560.66485@au.gust.org.pl>

Our "font commission" encountered the following:
on CTAN (and consequently on TeXLive 2016) we have URW base35 fonts
from 2003!:
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/base35

In the meantime those fonts were corrected many times (the version from 2003
had many bugs and "badnesses" :-) )

E.g. on January 2015 there was much better release, and from July 2016 it 
seems that fonts are finally proper. Moreover the whole stuff contains also
fonts in the opentype format.

The whole history of changes can be found on:
http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=urw-core35-fonts.git;a=summary

The most recent release:
http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=urw-core35-fonts.git;a=snapshot;h=79bcdfb34fbc
e12b592cce389fa7a19da6b5b018;sf=tgz

The license on CTAN and for GhostScript are exactly the same -- GPL,
so we have full accordance for including the corrected fonts also in TeXLive,
after the whole work of renaming the fonts to the TeX convenions, as it 
was done before, and refreshing the new stuff on CTAN.

AFAIR these "new" fonts changed the metrics compared to previous
versions of some glyphs. Since these fonts are used as replacement
for the Base35 fonts, they need to be metric wise equal. But they
aren't.

Then there is the addition of completely insufficient and broken 
cyrillic... but I see that they have at least added the cyrillic glyphs
now for all fonts.

I am really not sure what is the best way to proceed, and maybe the new fonts
are again metric wise compatible ...

Staszek - you are reviving this repeated-many-times-over-many-years
discussion as if something has changed?  As far as I can see, nothing
has changed.  The existing base35 fonts should not be
metric-incompatibly changed, in my opinion, and the experience so far is
that URW does not attempt to retain any compatibility.  Which is fine
for them, but not fine for the TeX world.

The new fonts could be released under new names, if it is worthwhile.

And, in fact, Michael Sharpe has already done that for the
times/helv/courier that were the previous release -- the result is his
nimbus15 package on CTAN and TL.  He invested a lot of effort in making
the previous "new" release actually usable.  I'll send you a proof of
his article about it, and I'll tell him about the new versions.

As for licensing, what could conceivably be useful is if URW released
the new versions under the LPPL so you could use them (ie, add Greek and
Cyrillic) in TeX Gyre.  I can't undertake that effort, but it would be

Hi Staszek and Norbert,
the fonts do not only have to be metric compatible, they have to
provide exactly the same sets of glyphs as the original fonts released
by URW and maintained by Walter Schmidt.

The ghostscript fonts shipped with TeX Live are the same as those
which are part of the psnfss LaTeX package.  And psnfss provides .tfm
files for exactly these fonts.  This is why I maintain these fonts in
TeX Live at all.

The main problem is that the fonts were extended but their internal
names (the /FontName variable) were not changed.  The Type 1 font
specification (Adobe) clearly says that there shall never exist two
different fonts with the same /FontName.  For a good reason!

Some time ago someone told me that he created a PostScript graphic but
a particular glyph didn't appear in the document created with LaTeX
though he could see this glyph in a PS viewer.  It took me some time
to find out what happened.  It turned out that he used a glyph which
wasn't supported by psnfss, pdftex assumed that the font provided by
ghostscript and that in the texmf tree are identical and substituted
the font.  Such kind of problems are quite difficult to track down.

I'll look into the new fonts anyway.  But I don't think that we can
use them because they are not compatible with what we have in TeX now.

If they turn out to be useful, the only way to make them available to
the TeX world is to rename all these fonts (/FontName), create TeX
support files for them, and create two packages, one for TeX and one
for ghostscript.  I currently have no idea how to make such fonts
accessible to ghostscript on all platforms.

Please note that the problem I described above occured on Unix.
Windows users are in advantage because both, TeX and ghostscript are
using exactly the same fonts.  On Unix there is currently no way to
avoid such problems because TeX Live can't provide an adapted
ghostscript installation for all supported platforms.

BTW, ghostscript developers are aware of the problem.  I described the
problem in detail on a TeX related mailing list and noticed later that
someone forwarded this mail to them.

Chris Lidell said that the whole purpose of providing the URW fonts at
all is to support Adobe fonts embedded in printers (for previewing).
The Adobe fonts have much less glyphs than the respective URW fonts.

Thus, ghostscript offers two solutions now:

  1. If there is no Fontmap in $GS_LIB, the fonts compiled into the
     binary are used.  These fonts support only a subset of the URW
     fonts.

  2. If you install the gsfonts package, the extended fonts are used
     and come with their own Fontmap file.  These fonts have much more
     glyphs than their counterparts we are using in the TeX world.

Unfortunately neither of these approches is appropriate when TeX is
involved.  We need exactly the [sub]sets of fonts which are supported
by TeX (psnfss).  No more, no less.

Staszek, you said that the new fonts are also available in OTF format.
I don't see any reason to add them to our ghostscript package because
ghostscript certainly doesn't know what to do with them.  In TeX Live,
XeTeX and LuaTeX are the only programs which are aware of OTF.

After all, I'm convinced that the new gsfonts are considerably
improved and I'll look into them soon.

Staszek, you said

 > the version from 2003 had many bugs and "badnesses" :-)

I'm aware of some bugs.  Some of them are quite famous: The "T" and
"D" in Palladio (aka Palatino) are completely broken.  If you
encountered any other bugs, please let me know. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Karl, please don't make URW resposible for all this mess.

Ghostscript developers are the culprits, not URW.  Though ghostscript
developers are aware for years that they break everything, they didn't
make the slightest attempt so far to fix the bugs they introduced.

There shall never exist two different fonts with the same /FontName,
according to the Adobe Type 1 Font Format specs.  Ghostscript still
ships modified fonts with the original URW font names.  *This* is the
cause of all the trouble.

There is no reason to blame URW for anything.  There is absolutely
nothing URW did wrong.  They gratefully donated the fonts, no more, no
less.  They provided an update in 2002 in order to add the Euro symbol
and nothing had been changed since then.  The culprits are others.
Definitely!

Therefore TeX Live provides the original URW fonts.  Whatever is
shipped with ghostscript is a moving target and thus absolutely
unusable in the TeX world.  Everything can change at any time.  Only
the original fonts donated by URW are reliable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <CAFVhNZPhZ5i3H+F96Oa4HO+OV8mc5MBeP+SVbkL7ZLX7XVCGXg@mail.gmail.com>

To track the source of the problem I did a plain vanilla install of TL 2016
on top of a vanilla install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I installed nothing else
and updated TL. Running Asymptote on gets:

$ which asy
/usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-linux/asy
$ asy
asy: error while loading shared libraries: libglut.so.3: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory

ldd shows that libglut is indeed missing, and can be fixed with:

sudo apt-get install freeglut3

Is that supposed to be the normal situation? Should this be remaked on
post-install notes?

The installation is definitely broken. Even after installation of:

apt-get install freeglut3
apt-get install freeglut3-dev
tlmgr update --all

 If you try to run it on the simple file (example from the tutorial):

settings.outformat = "pdf";
settings.prc = false;
size(5cm,0);
import three;
draw(unitsphere);

it will bom with:

/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/asymptote/three.asy: 2905.13: runtime:

and no output is produced.

Try adding -V when you invoke asy.  That fixed similar problems for
me (the 2905.13 rang a bell).

Is your distro built with gcc-6 ?

Do you use TeX Live from TUG or the Debian packages? As I understand, TeX
Live from TUG does not install packages distributed by your Linux distro
and it canot in principle have dependencies because the maintainers do not
know whther you need rpm or deb or whatever. On the contrary, the Debian
packages will probably have the correct dependencies. Fedora installs
freeglut as default and asy just works.

I'm not the person with the missing freeglut, that was Paulo.  For
me, asymptote is now working - with the additional switch I
mentioned.

FWIW, I installed both source and binary on BLFS-7.9 (gcc-5.3.0)
without issues.   But when I built BLFS-7.10 (gcc-6) I had to add
the -V switch to the invocations of asy for 3D diagrams.

The gcc-6 comment was because of a different issue with the 2016
binary on a gcc-6 system.  I logged it at
https://github.com/vectorgraphics/asymptote/issues/23 in the hope
that google would find the workaround.  John Bowman commented on
my bug report that it is now fixed in TL2016 and git.

Ken,

Using "asy -V" did somewhat fix the problem ... it come back with a
lot of other errros messages, but it does produce output. I am using
"asy" as it comes in TL 2016 from TUG.

Hello,

now that LuaTeX 1.0.0 has been published so soon after the release of TeX Live 2016, I wonder whether you please could update LuaTeX to the stable version in TL 2016? Or is the difference between v0.95 and 1.0 so small that it would not be worth the effort?

Thanks in advance.

Best,
J?rgen.

No, I do not want to rebuild luatex 1.0.0 binaries now; I think it is
better to keep things stable.  Next year will be soon enough for TL.
Anyone who wants to work with 1.0 can build them from sources, or, I
imagine, get them from the context repos in due course.  -k

Following encouragement yesterday from David Carlisle, I was motivated to try to migrate from XeTeX to LuaTeX 1.0, but "anyone who wants to work with 1.0 can build them from sources" is a 100%-certain obstacle to adoption.  "Building from source" may well be the norm in the Unix world, but to the best of my knowledge the number of people who can build TeX Live for Windows can be numbered on the fingers of one hand ...

Thanks for your quick reply, Karl. I can well understand that stability of TL is as important an issue here. Although, I'm afraid, I'd have to subscribe to Phil's point of view as well. :( So we'll probably stick with v0.95 until next year.

I wonder, though, are we missing anything important? The last discussions I realised were about the change in the pdftex primitives in LuaTeX and luatex85 for restoring compatibility for older packages, am I right? AFAICS the binaries for macOS Intel are there. Should I just copy them to the bin directory of TL2016 in order to update my system, or could that be fatal?

Thx, again!

Best,
J?rgen.

Dear Philip,

If you want to obtain luatex 1.0.0 for windows,
please get at CTAN
luatex-dev-w32.tar.xz
some days later,
and try to copy only a single file "luatex.dll"
to bin/win32 after saving the original luatex.dll of 0.95.0.

Best,
Akira

Please see

Note that the present one is old, and does not
contain the new 1.0.0.

J?rgen, the changes you mention had been made deliberately before
TL2016 was released in order to allow users to adapt their code in
advance.  Maybe there are differences between 1.0.0 and what we have
in TeX Live but I don't think that they are significant.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

I just wanted to install TeX Live to my 8" Windows tablet and encountered
some issues. Mostly network-related,
but there is one line about inappropriate I/O I wanted to let you know
about. I've never seen a similar error.

Uwe

It would probably work. In case it doesn't, you can always revert
(either make a backup copy or reinstall the package from the TL
repository).

> http://minimals.contextgarden.net/current/bin/luatex/osx-intel/bin/

This would work, but you should get the 64-bit binary. For historical
reason the ConTeXt ditribution still uses confusing names. You
probably want

    http://minimals.contextgarden.net/current/bin/luatex/osx-64/bin/

or

    http://svn.contextgarden.net/suite-bin/tex/x86_64-darwin/luatex/

You only need luatex. The others are just symlinks.

I tried to make a TL repository from these binaries (Norbert sent me
some instructins), but I'm getting errors when I run those.

Phil, I was using 1.0 but I assumed you were using 0.95 from tl 2016?

The number of changes is very small (far far fewer than the changes
between texlive 2015 and 2016) so the 1.0.0 release is more of a
symbolic (but important) statement of stability rather than anything
that affects many users.

So I'd agree with Karl that the normal policy of updating binaries
only at a new texlive release should be fine here.

But will Hans and Taco not (want to) update the support files to full compatibility with 1.0.0 and push those to CTAN ?  If they do, then TeX Live could end up with 0.95 binaries and 1.0.0 support files ...

The number of changes is very small (far far fewer than the changes between texlive 2015 and 2016) so the 1.0.0 release is more of a symbolic (but important) statement of stability rather than anything that affects many users. So I'd agree with Karl that the normal policy of updating binaries only at a new texlive release should be fine here.

Not sure which support files you mean but I think you can be assured
that any files, either from the luatex team or elsewhere such as the
luaotfload files or the luatex support for latex will either work for
a range of luatex releases
(the usual case) or be held in the same branch as luatex 1.0 and hit
texlive and miktex only when the binaries update.

Perhaps similar, just occurred :

I can imagine three reasons:

1. Network error, the file was only partially downloaded

2. You hit the moment when the file is updated on the mirror from which you
install and the file is temporarily corrupted. It rarely happens with rsync
but it does happen and should be OK within a few minutes (it happened to me
once within 10 years of using TeX Live)

3. The tablet went into a power saving mode, download was interrupted and
after wake-up an incomplete file was used. I do not know whether it is also
the case of Windows tablets but it happens regularly on a MacBook with Mac
OSX 10.

Anyway, I would suggest to retry and see what happens.

TLMGR does not issue timestamps, but even after showering and shaving TLMGR is still "trying to unwind" :-(

Two hours later, still "trying to unwind".

Hi,

I have some potentially good news.

You can try to fetch the latest LuaTeX from
    http://texlive.contextgarden.net/
which Norbert helped me set up.

You need to ask others how exactly this works. I did something like:

tlmgr repository add http://texlive.contextgarden.net/2016-context tlcontext
tlmgr repository list
tlmgr pinning add tlcontext luatex
tlmgr --force remove luatex
tlmgr install luatex

but I'm sure there's a better way, I just didn't figure it out yet.

If you install ConTeXt from there, you'll all get a huge pile of
additional documentation.

I added x86_64-linux and x86_64-darwin to start with (just to test
whether it works at all), but I can easily add other architectures.
(Windows hasn't been tested at all.)

Please note that this is highly experimental / there is no promise of
stability yet.

If things fail, you can always revert back to the official binary with
tlmgr and without messing around with the TL tree manually

Well, didn't do much there than answering your questions.

> tlmgr pinning add tlcontext luatex

No, that should be

Unix:
	tlmgr pinning add tlcontext 'luatex*'
and on Windows without the quotes *I*guess!!
