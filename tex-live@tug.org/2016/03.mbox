I installed the latest version of TeXLive 2015 on Linux, updates all
packages and when I try to run Asymptote I get:

-> asy
Welcome to Asymptote version 2.35 (to view the manual, type help)
error: could not load module 'plain'

I see this mentioned in several places as an old-bug that has been fixed!
So it seems a bit strange showing up in TL2015!

Dear Ram?n,

Yes, in the case of MP inclusion, by assuming the use
of dvipdfmx.def or xetex.def, the origin is translated
suitably because the new dvipdfmx.def and xetex.def
requires llx = lly = 0. That works fine with dvipdfmx.def
and xetex.def. But apparently it is bad in the present case.
In r39897 in TeX Live SVN, a new option --fixorigin is
introduced, which disables the translation of the origin.
By using the new dvipdfmx:
dvipdfmx --fixorigin test.dvi
the same output as that by dvips is obtained.

Thanks,
Akira

All that was needed to fix the problem was a:

   export ASYMPTOTE_HOME=/usr/local/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/asymptote/

but why in the heck ... would a TeXLive binary need that???

Thank you very much for your quick fix.
I have not yet test it,
but I am sure it will solve my problem.

But, I'm afraid there are other problems not solved.
Please think on two packages that use
 \special{psfile=filename.eps},
one suited for dvips, and the other suited for dvipdfmx.
Using both packages in the same document,
it would be impossible to get the intended results of both,
so they will always be incompatible.

Another problem is that, after changing the semantics of
 \special{psfile=filename.eps},
dvipdfmx is no longer a proper replacement for dvipdfm.

I guess you could find some other compatibility problems
caused by changing the semantics of the primitive.
In my opinion,
the cleanest way to solve all these problems would be:
1) to keep the semantics of
   \special{psfile=filename.eps}, and
2) to define a new
   \special{pdf: psfile filename.eps}
   with the new semantics, in case it is really needed.

Best regards,
   Ramon

Dear Ram?n,

Thanks. I changed the option name and the default (r39900).
By default, nothing is changed.
So, in the present case,
dvipdfmx test.dvi
gives the right result.
In the case where dvipdfmx.def/xetex.def is used, and
there are images created by 'MetaPost', we use an option
--mvorigin. Note that the option is concerned with only
images created by MetaPost.  Usual eps images are included
correctly with dvipdfmx.def/xetex.def irrespective of the
option --mvorigin.

Best,
Akira

Thanks again. But I am not sure that
files created by MetaPost are so peculiar.

In order to ascertain that
all EPS images are correctly included,
I would suggest to take
the first example of the EPS specification [1], in page 8,
which is presented as a "minimally conforming EPS file",
and run a similar test.

1) File: example1.eps (6 lines)

%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%BoundingBox: 5 5 105 105
10 setlinewidth
10 10 moveto
0 90 rlineto 90 0 rlineto 0 -90 rlineto closepath
stroke

2) File: test2.tex (1 line)

A\special{psfile=example1.eps}B\bye

3) Run: tex test2.tex
4) Run: dvips test2.dvi
5) Run: dvipdfmx test2.dvi
6) Compare test2ps with test2.pdf

Best regards,
   Ramon

Hi Paulo,

    Welcome to Asymptote version 2.35 (to view the manual, type help)
    error: could not load module 'plain'

Does not happen for me (of course; I wouldn't have released it if that
failed).  I don't have ASYMPTOTE_HOME or other relevant envvars set.

By design, neither the asy binary (2.35) nor the asy support files
(e.g., texmf-dist/asymptote/plain.asy) have changed since the initial
TL15 release.

Maybe you have some other kpathsea envvar set that is interfering?  I
cannot guess.  asy (that is, the tl binary -- compiling direct from
upstream is different) constructs the default by running
kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFMAIN and appending "/asymptote" to the value.
(source file settings.cc)

If the above is insufficient, maybe more debugging info could be gleaned
by running env KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 asy </dev/null >/tmp/out 2>&1
and see what is happening with after the TEXMFMAIN lookup.

Good luck,
Karl

Karl,

The problem with asymptote has been resolved, but a question lingers about
the correct use of kpse and on top of that - about multiple installation of
TeXLive.

First the problem:

I have two installations of TL, one coming from Ubuntu  in
/usr/share/texlive/ and the other standard from CTAN at:
/usr/local/texlive/2015/ (where several others are installed at the same
top level).

The one from Ubuntu does not have a Asymptote installed. And when I use
TL2015 Asymptote, instead of using:

    /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-linux/kpsewhich

it uses the one in the PATH, which was:

      /usr/bin/kpsewhich

that was installed by the Ubuntu installation... and obviously cannot find
its own files.

And here is the big question:

I thought that a TL binary was supposed to use **always** the kpse of its
own distribution and not the one in the PATH. Is that not the case???

That is not the case and has never been the case.  The recommended
procedure has always been to set PATH according to the distribution you
want to use.  Like it says at the end of the install-tl output and all
over the documentation :).

Over the years, we have gradually worked toward making more and more
programs independent of PATH (more precisely, to use their own binary
directory before anything from PATH).  But asy is not one of those.
I'm not sure how practical it will be to do so, but I'll talk with
Bowman about it.

Karl

Dear Ram?n,

No, they are not peculiar.
(x)dvipdfmx can include eps created by MetaPost without
help of other applications such as Ghostscript.
However other eps files must be changed to epdf by
Ghostscript. The created epdf, in the present dvipdfmx.cfg,
have llx = lly = 0, so we need 'peculiar' handling in
dvipdfmx.def/xetex.def. Therefore when we use
dvipdfmx.def/xetex.def, we need 'peculiar' moving of the
origin for MetaPost-created eps files, since they are
not converted into epdf files.

Best,
Akira

But in the binary, my lualatex test crapped out:

Hi Ken

the new binaries need changes in the support files which will be included only after the freeze as they are not compatible with the 2015 binaries.

You need to wait till the freeze of TeX Live in about 1 month.

Thanks, but this is a pure binary install from install-tl-unx dated
20160226 so it appears to be broken.

Perhaps my original post was not clear - this is a new system, built
over the last few days, and I am telling the binary installer to use
/opt/texlive which did not exist before this.  And I do not have any
TeX in ~/.

the error looks a bit odd, but can you try with a current latex, it
looks like you have some files out of sync, you are using

LaTeX2e <2015/01/01>

there have been six latex  releases since then.

2015/01/01 patch level 1, 2015/01/01 patch level 2

That looks incorrect. As pointed out by David, your LaTeX
is
	LaTeX2e <2015/01/01>
while TeX Live ships
	LaTeX2e <2016/02/01>

Something is wrong on your side.

If you do not want to change PATH, it might be possible to do:

PATH=`which asy`:$PATH asy

Maybe it can even be defined as alias

Thank you for your patience with me.

I am now beginning to understand what is going on.
Let me please repeat what you are saying with my own words,
just to confirm that I am understanding you rightly.

The problem is caused by a limitation of Ghostscript
   http://ghostscript.com/doc/9.16/Issues.htm
related to bug 202735
   http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=202735
where I read that
"This is an architectural restriction in Ghostscript:
all devices impose an implicit clipping region
of [0 0 infinity infinity] in device space".

The solution is to translate the image
to the first quadrant coordinates using -dEPSCrop
when doing the Ghostscript conversion to pdf,
and then undo the translation.

Now, the peculiarity of Metapost generated figures
is that they use a known subset of Postscript operations
and then they can be converted to pdf without the
help of Ghostscript. In these cases the
final undo movement must be omitted.

I am very sorry for wasting your time,
but until I have learned of that limitation of Ghostscript,
I was doing the wrong deductions.
Thank you very much for your time,
and for your good work with dvipdfmx.

Can you suggest a few random files, please, which ought to have
recent dates ?  Oh, wait, I think I might have spotted the problem:

I see I have ~/.texlive2014 and ~/.texlive2015.

In .texlive2015/texmf-var/ I have directories luatex-cache and
web2c, with various subdirectories.

So, because the binary includes newer code than the past source
builds, but for the same year, those files are causing the
problem ?  Is there a preferred way to get rid of them, or to
refresh them ?

Thanks.

The problem in your log was not the binary version but the version of
latex.ltx which is old

what does kpsewhich latex.ltx show?

Random guess: your .fmt file (latex.fmt, pdflatex.fmt, etc.) has not
been rebuilt since the latex source files were updated.  Try running
fmtutil-sys --all  (or some such, as you prefer).  -k

Just for the record
ken at deluxe ~ $kpsewhich latex.ltx
/opt/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/latex.ltx

ken at deluxe ~ $ls -l
/opt/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/latex.ltx
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 252484 Jan 31 23:48
/opt/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/latex.ltx

I think it is the old files in ~/.texlive2015 that are causing my
problem.

Well, two people have now suggested this - but it does not help.  I
think the problem is because of the old files in ~/.texlive2015.

You can safely remove everything in ~/.texlive2015.  Files in this
directory take precedence.

fmtutil-sys --all creates files in /opt/texlive/2015/texmf-var for all
users.

If there is a .fmt file in ~/.texlive2015/texmf-var, you probably ran
fmtutil (without -sys) accidentally.

I suppose the real problem was that I was doing something very
unusual - building from source (repeatedly, on fresh installs over
the months, to check that toolchain and other changes such as to
grep[1] did not break it), and now _also_ updating the same year
from a newer binary build : separate systems, but shared /home.

I've now moved ~/.texlive2015 to {,-source}, created an empty
texlive2015-binary variant, and symlinked to the matching version.
That "just works".

Thanks for all the assistance.

[1.] gnu grep-2.23 broke xindy's build, the maintainer is aware and
meanwhile I've used awk in BLFS's 'recipe'.

Hello all,

After amsmath,sty is updated to 2016/02/20 v2.15, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
produces an unwanted space between `a' and `b' from the source below:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
{\mathversion{normal}a}b
\end{document}

Supplying a `%' in the definition of \resetMathstrut@ resolves this situation.

FYI, Ubuntu does have Asymptote so you don't need to install
TL2015 only because you need Asymptote.

"sudo apt-get install asymptote" will work for you.

Hello TeX Live builders.  Today is purportedly the day to begin
*testing* of the sources for the TL'16 release.

I know many of you have given the current sources a try or two.  That is
great.  If you haven't, please do.  The current sources are not final --
I still have to incorporate the musixtex autosp program into the tree,
among other things.  But, thanks to hard work by Akira, Luigi, and
others (we all miss Peter), the current sources should be pretty close.

Perhaps most importantly: if you have built the binaries for a given
platform in the past, but won't be able to this year, please let me know
asap.  List of people/platforms is below, to the best of my knowledge.

Finally, a crucial reminder: as usual, please do not commit anything to
the repository (Master/bin).  We are not nearly ready for that.  There
will be lots more discussion/warning before the user-visible pretest
starts.

Thanks,
Karl

As I already reported back in September 2015 on tlbuild (message
"LuaJIT segfaults on NetBSD"), everything builds fine on NetBSD
but the test suite fails for luajit:

FAIL: luajiterr
===============

[1]   Segmentation fault      ./luajittry -e "...
1,4d0
< ./luajittry: (command line):1: test
< stack traceback:

<       (command line):1: in main chunk

There has been no progress since then.

There has been progress. We diagnosed the problem and Luigi provided
an ad-hoc patch; the only problem is that he only fixed it for OpenBSD
and Solaris (and even that is somewhat inconsistent compared to other
platforms).

See http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=39893

Here's my (off-list) response (I can provide more context if needed;
but the major problem is that source/libs/luajit/m4/lj-system.m4
treats any platform that's not in a list Darwin/Linux, now also
SunOS/FreeBSD as "other non-POSIX platform" which leads to problems):

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Notice the same document built fine with TL-2015 upgrade I did on March

Thanks for the report, but this is not a TL issue.  I'm just installing
the new versions of biblatex and biber as they come along.  (Like the
release just made which evidently introduced this problem.  Or maybe
biblatex-philosophy needs to be changed.  I can't guess.)

I've forwarded your message to Phil Kime.  I think there bug trackers

Hi Angelo,

The problem seems to be that \ifblx at load@version at one was renamed to 
\ifblx at load@version at legacy in biblatex-3.3.  This happened in commit 
09f8438 in the biblatex git repo, which did a lot of renaming.  Phil, 
did you intend to keep the old names as legacy aliases?

I assume Phil means the author of biblatex-philosophy, who is Ivan 
Valbusa (ivan dot valbusa at univr dot it) according to the README at 
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-philosophy.

Yes, biblatex-philosophy is a style for biblatex written by Ivan Balbusa according to the doc so best contact him.

I generally don?t make compat aliases for internals as people shouldn?t be using them anyway and it makes for messy internals.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr error in windows7 "there is no disk in ..."
Message-ID: <1w6q9l7crs7k0.dlg@nililand.de>

I (sometimes, currently regularly) get an error when I start 
tlmgr update --list or tlmgr update --all in the command line on a
windows 7 machine. 

The error dialog shows "perl.exe" in the title and the message says
(in german)

"There is no disk on the drive. Please insert a disk into drive
\Device\Harddisk6\DR6"

I can cancel the dialog, it will reappear two more times and then
everything works without problems. But it is a bit annoying.

After some research and the help of e.g. this site
http://www.sleeter.com/blog/2013/08/fixing-the-there-is-no-disk-in-the-drive-error/
I found out that "Harddisk6" is on my computer is (probably) related
to a (quite unused) built-in card reader and there is really no disk
in it. But why does perl/tlmgr try to access it?

The problem is that not everything that package authors needs can be
access without sometimes using internals. 

In this case (as far as I can see) the style is trying to test for
the backend driver (and to call a sourcemap if biber is used). 

Imho this is something packages should be able to do and so there
should be a reliable and documented method for package authors.

I'm afraid that looks wrong to me. Either the style should work with
either backend or it should be Biber-only and use \RequireBiber for that
(which is a documented interface).

Hi Angelo,


The problem seems to be that \ifblx at load@version at one was renamed to

\ifblx at load@version at legacy in biblatex-3.3.  This happened in commit

09f8438 in the biblatex git repo, which did a lot of renaming.  Phil,

did you intend to keep the old names as legacy aliases?


There are some more problems with other biblatex styles ...

? As far as I know  the style works with every backend. It only
(like biblatex itself) has some additional features / use different
code if biber is used and so need to be able to do "\ifbiberbackend
... \else ... \fi". 

What's wrong with this? It is not different to "if etex" or
"\ifluatex" etc.

Indeed! I tried to remove "style=philosophy-modern" but it failed 
differently.. it seems that documents based on biblatex are totally broken..

I have not the *slightest* idea, sorry. The only thing I can say is
that it is *not* the tlmgr perl code that is trying to access that
directory.

What the perl internally does, sorry ... that is something a Windows
guru need to answer.

I have myself a card reader on Windows, but have never seen this message.

All the best

I see it regularly (from time to time); it is very annoying,
particularly because of the difficulty of tracking down exactly to which
device (e.g.,) ?\Device\Harddisk2\DR3" refers.

no, the default styles are all working and all others which use no
internal commands from biblatex.

It?s not a question of internal commands. Biblatex 3.4 completely reorganised the name formatting. Every style which changes name formatting ? which has nothing to do with ?internal commands? ? has to adapt to the new naming machinery. Without an update, many styles will stop working.

This is all documented in the release notes. I updated my own style biblatex-fiwi yesterday, the new versions should be available soon. It?s not terribly complicated to do ? it probably took me less than an hour ?, but style authors have to do it.

No, there is a clear incompatible change which affects quite a
number of "external" styles:

Message-ID: <CAEW6iOhdx3FGw8Okr79=-KLsv-HQn-Tf6W9gZCULoUS=vZO-ZQ@mail.gmail.com>

For various reasons I've been building texlive from an rsync'ed copy
of the texlive svn head and also luatex from the luatex svn
experimental branch.

Both seem to work but I notice that luatex.exe is 4 times larger if
built from the texlive tree

-rwxr-xr-x 1 davidc Domain Users  9425920 Mar 13 13:12
./build/texk/web2c/luatex.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 1 davidc Domain Users 41666668 Mar 12 17:04
/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/luatex.exe


There are of course some minor differences as the top one is 0.89.5
experimental and the bottom one is .89.4 but the main difference seems
to be that the first one is stripped.

 file reports

./build/texk/web2c/luatex.exe:                        PE32+ executable
(console) x86-64 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows

/usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/luatex.exe: PE32+ executable
(console) x86-64, for MS Windows


In both cases I used the supplied build script to configure/make

so the luatex experimental built with build.sh from:

https://foundry.supelec.fr/scm/viewvc.php/branches/experimental/?root=luatex

and the texlive svn one built with Build from

https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/



These binaries are only used for internal latex testing so it doesn't
matter too much
if I have a standard build, but so that I can trust the results of
these tests, do these results seem reasonable or have I built one or
the other system incorrectly?

I should have mentioned that I build using --enable-shared, but that 
shouldn't affect whether or not the executable is stripped.

Hi David,

On my last build of TeX Live from the svn repository (March 5), I got 
the following on cygwin64:

$ ls -l inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-cygwin/luatex.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kbrown None 9425408 2016-03-05 11:23 
inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-cygwin/luatex.exe*

$ file inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-cygwin/luatex.exe
inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-cygwin/luatex.exe: PE32+ executable (console) 
x86-64 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows

I'm not sure why your binary wasn't stripped.  Can you tell by looking 
at the build log?  Here's the relevant line from mine:

libtool: install: /bin/sh 
/home/kbrown/src/texlive/test.x86_64/build-aux/install-sh -c -s 
.libs/luatex.exe 
/home/kbrown/src/texlive/test.x86_64/inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-cygwin/luatex.exe

Sorry for the noise, this was mostly a case of user (me) error.

Thanks to Ken Brown for pointing me in the right direction.

After a full build, stripped and non stripped binaries are available

$ find . -name luatex.exe -exec ls -l \{\} \;
-rwxr-xr-x 1 davidc Domain Users 9423872 Mar 14 16:17
./inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-cygwin/luatex.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 1 davidc Domain Users 41666668 Mar 14 15:15
./Work/texk/web2c/luatex.exe

But actually I didn't tell the whole truth in the initial mail.

I ran the top level Build script but then to track luatex updates I
was using rsync and then just typing make in

/source/Work/texk/web2c

Thinking I was picking up the existing configure settings.

However, this _only_ makes the unstripped binaries (in that directory)

make install strip

or similar is required to do the final stripping.

This is more or less documented in

https://www.tug.org/texlive/build.html

but I missed the significance of the text there.

Subject: [tex-live] Sad news: Sebastian Rahtz
Message-ID: <56E9E739.3040203@simon-cozens.org>

Hello all,

I'm sorry to have to inform the TeX Live community that Sebastian Rahtz
passed away on the 15th of March. He was diagnosed with late-stage brain
tumours last autumn, and retired as the Chief Data Architect for the
University of Oxford IT Services before Christmas last year.

SPQR contributed to huge swathes of the TeX world between 1985 and 2000;
he founded TeX Live in 1996. He was one of the main instantiators of the
CTAN and responsible for the site's structure; he was involved in many
aspects of the TUG and UK-TUG community, including serving as TUG
secretary, chair of the technical council and member of the TUG board.
He wrote the hyperref package, now maintained by Heiko Oberdiek. He was
the first recipient of the UK Open Source Award.

Sebastian was the author of the LaTeX Graphics Companion and the LaTeX
Web Companion. From the 2000s onward, much of his time and energy
switched to the web, and Sebastian was occupied with XSL, Format Objects
and the Text Encoding Initiative, leaving less time for TeX work. He
stepped down from the TeX Live project in 2004.

In a 2009 interview for TUG[1], he said "I pride myself on having passed
on most of my TeX projects and not hung on to them in a dog-in-a-manger
way." That as many be, I'm sure for many of us, the name of Sebastian
Rahtz is still very much associated with TeX, and certainly for me at
least, the name of TeX is still very much associated with Sebastian Rahtz.

Please remember his widow Leonor and his two daughters.

Simon

Subject: [tex-live] biblatex-biber-2.4 and Data::Uniqid-0.12
Message-ID: <20160317035141.GA3937@milliways>

Apologies for straying off-topic [ I'm trying to build biber from
source, using system perl modules ], but I'm out of ideas where to
ask and hoping somebody here can give me a clue.

With biblatex-biber-2.4 Data::Uniqid is now essential, both for the
tests and at runtime.  But I cannot get the tests from
Data-Uniquid-0.12 to pass (there are four, the last one fails - it
should return 4 values but the second and third are zero, which is
apparently not acceptable).  And when I run biber no bibliographies
are produced - I'm guessing that the Data::Uniquid failing tests are
the likely cause of this.

This is on BLFS [ beyond linuxfromscratch ] using perl-5.22.1.
Almost all the links for failing tests in Data-Uniqid that google
apparently finds are either for failures in other packages as part
of a build where Data-Uniqid happened to be included, or are from
many years ago.

Clearly biber works for the developer (my memory says that he uses
osx), and Data-Uniqid appears to work in distros such as Fedora.  I
suppose what I really need is a "weird perl problems" list, if there
is one ?

Thanks for listening.

Hmm, here on Debian/sid I get no errors:
	libdata-uniqid-perl 0.12-1
	perl 5.22.1-9

Message-ID: <56EAA33F.1050900@gmail.com>

A Cygwin user reported that his terminal settings were changed after 
running texconfig (with no arguments, pressing return to enter 
interactive mode).  I think the problem is in the termCtl function in 
texconfig-dialog (around line 139), where 'reset' and 'stty sane' are 
called.  Shouldn't the program instead save and restore the terminal 
settings?

I haven't tried to look into where and why 'termCtl reset' is used, so 
maybe there's a good reason for the current behavior.

In Debian I am not shipping it anymore. It simply does not work

Thanks, Norbert.

You guys patch out the fourth test in Data-Uniqid, so I'll grab that
patch.  Obviously I have some other issue in my install - or in my
test scripts (there was a report that external stylesheets needed to
be changed, did not think that applied to me, but who knows).  But
first I need to change my tests to detect if the bibliography got
written in the PDF.

Cheers.

Hi Norbert,

    texconfig .... no please, can we kill this program at some point?

It's been around so long (longer than TL), I don't want to kill it.
Invocations like "texconfig rehash" or "texconfig findprog" might be
buried in workflow scripts.  I don't see that the benefit outweighs the
potential problems.

    It simply does not work with current TeX (Live).

At least some parts of it still work.  Those parts that don't should
report error messages.  I admit I haven't reviewed it in light of our
changes to fmtutil and updmap in past years ... -k

    Shouldn't the program instead save and restore the terminal settings?

In theory, sure.  But is there any portable way to do that?  I'm not
aware of one.  I am highly skeptical that stty -g works everywhere.  And
no, I don't want to spend time writing code to use stty -g if it's
available, not if it's not, etc.  Patches welcome :).

Otherwise, the solution, as Norbert implies, is not to use texconfig.

    I haven't tried to look into where and why 'termCtl reset' is used, so 
    maybe there's a good reason for the current behavior.

I'm sure it was just a matter of restoring sanity to the terminal after
doing screen-oriented stuff, ca.1990.  If you (or your user) want to try
deleting it and see if anything untoward happens these days, I guess I'd
consider removing it.  -k

I was building biber-2.4 against biblatex-3.4, I needed 3.3 (and
when I first noticed the version mismatch in the logs I convinced
myself that I needed the latest of both).

The following seems to do the job with no apparent ill effects:

Sorry for the very long delay, but the bug is now fixed in the sourceforge cvs.

(In case you were wondering, the part of your musixdoc file that triggered
the bug was Section 2.16.2 (page 61), which used the ptmr7t font, among
others.)

Also in case you may find it useful in the future, here's a near-minimal
(plain) TeX file that also triggers the bug:

------ begin file ------
Test hi hi

\vfil\eject

\font\foo=ptmr7t

\foo Hi again.
\bye
------ end file ------

Thank you very much for the bug report.

Sincerely,


Paul Vojta

Subject: [tex-live] last-minute update to xetex?
Message-ID: <56EE82A7.3050700@gmail.com>

Hi Karl,

I realize the sources for TL'16 were supposed to be final a couple of 
weeks ago, but as always..... is there a possibility of a last-minute 
update, or are we too late?

Specifically, in response to a recent request on the mailing list:

   http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2016-March/026542.html

I have just proposed a change (it's currently on a sourceforge branch, 
but could be merged to master at any time) to make the max hyphenatable 
word length user-adjustable. The default remains 63 chars (for stability 
of existing documents), but I've added a parameter 
\XeTeXhyphenatablelength that can be adjusted by the author (there's a 
hard limit of 4K, which should be enough for the foreseeable future...)

So, can we consider committing this to TL svn to be part of this year's 
release, or are we too far along already?

JK

I am not Karl, but please, go ahead and commit the changes.
The earlier the better. Till now we only did test builds.

Karl will update ICU to 57.1 after 23 March, so the sources
for TL'16 must not be final.
Please commit XeTeX 0.99996 to TL svn.

OK, given Norbert's and your encouragement, I have committed it (TL rev 
40084).

Subject: [tex-live] Can Noto fonts be made to work with fontspec ?
Message-ID: <20160321235138.GA16504@milliways>

I've recently installed the whole set of Noto fonts to one machine,
so I thought I would take another look at trying to use them with
lualatex and xelatex.

If, for english text, I try to force 'NotoSans' it appears to work.
But my test harness is really set up to check for font filenames in
the output from fc-cache.  If I try to specify NotoSans-Regular.ttf
then fontspec blows up :

(/opt/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.cfg)))kpathsea:make_tex:
Invalid fontname `[NotoSans-Regular.ttf]/OT', contains '['

Similarly with simplified chinese :

(/opt/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/tex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.cfg)))kpathsea:make_tex:
Invalid fontname `[NotoSansCJKsc-Regular.otf]/OT', contains '['

I cannot specify the names, e.g. in the format NotoSans CJK JP because the
spaces in font names are regarded as invalid.  Using single quotes
does not help, using double quotes seems to break the build anyway
because I am trying to set the fonts before \begin{document}.

All of my main texlive packages are built from the 2015 source, so
perhaps thing have already changed.  Is this a known problem ?

Spaces are used in the names of a lot of fonts and they do work with
fontspec. For instance, all TeX Gyre fonts contain spaces in their names.

Take a look at

which speaks about Source Han Sans wich is NotoSans.

Ah, right you are.  I was taking the name from what I could see in
libreoffice writer, I think that name started NotoSans but in fc-list
I can see (all on one line)
/usr/share/fonts/Noto/NotoSansCJKjp-Regular.otf: Noto Sans CJK JP,Noto Sans CJK JP Regular:style=Regular

And with \newfontfamily{\japanese}{Noto Sans CJK JP} it does indeed
work.  So, I guess that was a variation of "I can't find this font."

Thanks

Thanks.  I was trying to use the Source Sans CJK fonts when I last
tried this - at that time I assumed there was something too new in
them.  Now, Zdenek has pointed the way to me : after I replied to
him, I realised I was already using a korean font with a space in
the name, so the fontspec error about a space in the filename is
"misleading".  And for the rest, I need to take the second field
delimited by ':' from fc-list, strip the leading space, and use that
string instead of the font name.

For sad people like me, who think that scripting in bash is the best
thing since (whatever - I was going to say sliced bread, but I
prefer real bread ;-) this seems like another fun change to make.

As to font collections - I don't think the otf variant has bitten me
yet, but if I can continue to find time to play with fonts then I'm
sure it will bite me one day.

Cheers

Message-ID: <CAPT88+A92d+N3xqCr8zP0yOxOQMJRoyLb=TbThAvqsvFbZREPA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi TL Maintainers,

Thanks for adding the asapsym macros to TeX Live.

I put notes in README.md about file locations, but it appears these
were missed. I will be sure to put notes directly in the announcement
text in the future; my apologies for not doing that this time. Here
was my proposal (from README.md):

doc/
  generic/
    asapsym/
      asapsym.pdf
      README.md
fonts/
  opentype/
    omnibus-type/
      asap/
        Asap-Symbol.otf
source/
  generic/
    asapsym/
      asapsym.dtx
      asapsym.ins
tex/
  generic/
    asapsym/
      asapsym-generic.tex
  latex/
    asapsym/
      asapsym.sty
  plain/
    asapsym/
      asapysm.code.tex

At minimum, the file asapsym-generic.tex (currently placed in TL's
doc/ tree) should be moved somewhere into the tex/ tree for the macros
to work as expected. My suggestion was tex/generic/asapsym/, but
anywhere under tex/ will work.

There are a couple of other finer organizational points. On these, I
defer to your judgment, since this is my first package that has files
in several locations:

1. Move the Plain TeX loader file asapsym.code.tex into the tex/plain/
area (currently this is placed in tex/latex/ along with the .sty
file).

2. If my understanding of the TDS is correct, Asap-Symbol.otf should
not be placed in fonts/opentype/public/, because the supplier has also
produced proprietary fonts in addition to the free font used by my
package. My suggested location gives the supplier its own directory,
and using asap for the family name leaves room for the rest of the
ASAP font family to be added to TL in the future without needing to
shuffle things around.

Please let me know what you think about these items. Thanks in advance
for your thoughts,

PG

Subject: [tex-live] Can't adjust paper size with tlmgr --usermode
Message-ID: <56F6AEFD.7010406@gmail.com>

I'm puzzled by the following error:

$ /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/tlmgr --usermode dvips paper a4
tlmgr: package dvips is not installed - cannot adjust paper size!
tlmgr: An error has occurred. See above messages. Exiting.

In fact, dvips *is* installed:

$ /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/tlmgr install dvips
tlmgr: package repository http://mirrors.acm.jhu.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr install: package already present: dvips

I thought maybe I had to install it in user mode, but that doesn't work:

$ /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-cygwin/tlmgr --usermode install dvips
tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
Package dvips is not relocatable, cannot install it in user mode!

Is there a bug here, or am I misunderstanding something?

Indeed. This is currently not supported. The code contains traces
but that isn't working - and the warnings are not correct.
That is, paper setting is not supported in user mode.

I will think about how to fix that.

On second thought - and trial to write code - I leave it as
unsupported. paper configuration is fragile, needs update of
format dumps, all things that are not really supported in user
mode.

Sorry.

No problem.  I see that you've fixed the warning, so at least the 
confusion is cleared up.

Hi,

i noticed that the koma-script package from the net-archive is not 
splittet
-> contains doc and source.

In the hyph-utf8 package, some .txt-files are empty.

Is this intentional? No real issues, but maybe something to fix.

It's intentional, per the author's wishes.

  Yes, it is intentional.  The .txt files contain patterns and exception
lists (as .pat.txt and .hyp.txt respectively), one by line; hence when
there are none the file is empty (only relevant for exceptions, of
course).  Not ideal, but that was the way it's been since we implemented
plain text hyphenation data.  I think we already had a discussion about
this a while ago.

It seems something has broken the compatibility with siunitx package.

Passing issue in expl3: should be fixed within 24 h. (BTW, this is not a
TeX Live problem per se.)

So the files are needed even if they are empty? May i insert a comment, 
to make it nonempty?
I ask because i want to build a package for my linux-distribution and 
the build-tool warns about emtpy files.

No, they are not really needed.
They were just added for consistence/simplicity. We didn't think of
"problems" related to the files being empty, but you are certainly not
the only one who complained.

> May i insert a comment, to

Those files are meant to include one hyphenation exception per line. I
don't know where and how these files are used outside of TeX (or
perhaps in some TeX packages that I'm not aware of). There could be a
tool that would produce wrong results if it doesn't expect comments
(and even if it would expect comments, it is not clear whether a
comment would start with % or # or perhaps something else).

I would suggest you to simply remove those files rather than modify them.

Which Linux distribution?

We plan to introduce some changes to hyph-utf8 in the next month, so
if you are starting the packaging now and are not in a hurry, you
could also wait a bit longer in order not to spend effort on things
that you'll have to fix later anyway.

May I suggest that a one-line exception file of the form

	zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

would address all of these points ?

  Yes, for Johannes' use case that's clearly the way to go.

Ok, thanks for the information.

Thanks for the hint. I'm not in a hurry. Testing/changing my package(s) 
will take some time anyway. I'm building three packages. The first 
contains all binaries+minimal set of tex-packages(including hyph-utf8) 
to have a small working texlive-installation at about 50mb 
xz-compressed, the second package contains the remainder to provide a 
full texlive-installation. The third package comes with all documentation.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr init-usertree returns a warning on success
Message-ID: <56FACDC4.4010703@gmail.com>

A successful run of 'tlmgr init-usertree' yields the following:

$ tlmgr init-usertree
tlmgr: action init-usertree returned a warning.

That's because action_init_usertree has no return statement, so it 
returns the return value of its last statement, 'mkdir 
("$usertree/tlpkg/tlpobj")'.  That return value is 1 on success, which 
equals $F_WARNING.

I think there should be either a plain 'return', resulting in

   tlmgr: didn't get return value from action init-usertree, assuming ok.

or else 'return $F_OK', resulting in silence.

Hi,

the dvidvi-package contains manpages only, these are declared as 
"runfiles", but should be "docfiles".

Ok, doc and runfiles need to be shipped together per the authors 
licence, but could only the sources be put apart? It would save 
5mb(compressed) from my package. Maybe i should ask the author directly.

Please don't, Markus Kohm is not involved in the CTAN package.I am the
current maintainer of the packaging, it took a lot of energy and time to
agree with him on the current as it. It's not worth to start those
discussions again for a mere 5 MB.

Could you tell us where did you get the fixed version?

Thanks.

Almost don't dare to tell it here ;-) I updated from tug.org (though I'm
aware that this is not recommended and that one should update from the
mirrors)

Subject: [tex-live] problems with compiling LaTeX-documents
Message-ID: <56FCFAA2.1080606@student.uni-tuebingen.de>

Dear Sir or Madam,

I work with Ubuntu 14.04 and I have a serious issue while compiling my
LaTeX-documents. When I try, I get the following:

***
\RequirePackage{expl3}[2016/03/28]
\@ifpackagelater{expl3}{2016/03/28}
  {}
  {%
    \PackageError{xparse}{Support package l3kernel too old}
      {%
        Please install an up to date version of l3kernel\MessageBreak
        using your TeX package manager or from CTAN.\MessageBreak
        \MessageBreak
        Loading xparse will abort!%
      }%
    \endinput
  }
***

I installed TeXLive via the following instruction:
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1092/how-to-install-vanilla-texlive-on-debian-or-ubuntu
(Point "Installation", following every point exactly).

I tried

***
tlmgr update --self --all
***

several times, even newstart of the system didn't help, so I'm a little
helpless... Can you find out what goes wrong? Or do I just have to wait
a few hours an retry the update?

Thank you very much in advance!

Read the posting before yours ...

As a workaround: Try if it works if you open expl3.sty and change
the date to 2016/03/28. 

Or revert the update of l3packages.

OK.

Meantime, Ulrike provides a nice workaround on ctt: "As a workaround:
Try if it works if you open expl3.sty and change the date to
2016/03/28."
