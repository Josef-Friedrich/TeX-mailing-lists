Subject: [tex-live] tl15/tl16 changes to come
Message-ID: <201604022153.u32Lrpaq014206@freefriends.org>

I plan to make Monday night (April 4) the last regular update for TL15.
(The state of the packages will be archived as a tlnet-final directory
as usual.)

Then it will take several days to build and install the new binaries for
TL16, get format building to work, etc.  This will be available in the
tlpretest area (not tlnet), and updates will continue there for a month
or two before the release, as in past years.

More details when the pretest is available.  In general, I don't
anticipate any particular changes to the infrastructure and process from
previous years.  (The content is different story.)

Happy TeXing,
Karl

For a short presentation of texlive 2016 I'm planning to give: What are the 
most important changes in comparison to texlive 2015? Just three points?!

So I'm asking for the progress of tlmgr as well as LuaTeX and other enginges, 
as well as of important changes of packages, if you are aware of them.

Thank you!

Regards,

Alexander

Buuhhhh, hard to say. Everyone has different ideas. Mine would be:
* tlmgr: security improvements, in particular gpg signing and verification
* binaries: reproducible build support features (option to disable
	certain time stamps etc to obtain bitwise identical builds)
* packages: till now all packages have been updated in TL2015, so
	we will see what great changes come in the next two months

And last but not least - 2016 is not released and we haven't even 
started working on the integration and changes, so all of the above
might be wrong, irrelevant, or just hot air ;-)

Enjoy

Alexander: the list of changes between versions is one of the most
time-consuming and fragile tasks I undertake each year.  I can't give
you an off-the-cuff answer beyond Norbert's reply and my reply below.  I
will be writing up the information for the pretest.html web page in
upcoming days, as I always do.

    * binaries: reproducible build support features

As far as I know the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH envvar support, and the new
primitives for controlling dates and such, are only in pdftex.  And only
relevant for direct PDF output (not DVI).  Am I wrong?


Anyway, the biggest change in the binaries is certainly in luatex, which
has renamed or removed a great many primitives.  As far as I've been
able to discern, nearly every existing package and/or document using
luatex will need changes.

Hans graciously wrote an article for TUGboat summarizing the changes.  I
had hoped the TUGboat issue containing it would already be at the
printer by now, but due to circumstances beyond my control, that has not
happened and there is no ETA for the first TUGboat issue at this point.
Since I know this will be a critical issue to some people, I attach the
preprint (page numbers are bogus) for it, so those who are interested
can garner some information.

BTW, the LaTeX developers are well aware of this and have made yeoman
efforts to adapt LaTeX to the new regime.  Plain LuaTeX will reflect the
new changes, by design.  There will be new .ini and .cfg files galore.
All this will and must happen only for the pretest.

Good luck to us all,
Karl

Message-ID: <9F00A93E-629F-4CB8-9214-631506ACA565@free.fr>

Hi,

on pretest, the binaries arrived today. I wanted to prune 
the backups as I had already done the installation yesterday. 

(I work
via rsyncing a mirror first to my disk, then tlmgr update).

Not being familiar with the command line use of backup --clean
I first used --dry-run which reported no action to be performed.

~$ tlmgr option autobackup
Number of backups to keep (autobackup): 1

~$ tlmgr option backupdir
Directory for backups (backupdir): tlpkg/backups

~$ du -h /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups
 48M	/usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups

~$ tlmgr backup --clean=0 --all --dry-run 

does not output anything.

Then I did

~$ tlmgr backup --clean=0 --all

~$ du -h /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups
  0B	/usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups

Unfortunately I forgot to check after the first call
with --dry-run if anything had been pruned.

Hence I don't know if the first instance (with
--dry-run) already did the pruning.

By the way the clean=N syntax is a bit confusing
as apparently it says to *keep* N backups.

In the sequence of events above I in fact did
~$ tlmgr backup --clean=2 --all --dry-run 

after the one with clean=0 as I was a bit confused.

What is the correct way to use --dry-run ?

I am on mac os x.

Cheers,
Jean-Fran?ois

On a windows 7 PC in a normal user account I started the
install-tl-advanced.bat at first in a command line where the PATH
variable didn't contain TL15. In the gui I go red entries for
various installation pathes because the default installation
directory was not writable. 

So I stopped the installation and retried in a command line which
does know TL15 to check if the installer would pick up some info
from the older TeXlive. Now every path in the GUI had a default but
curiously all in the wrong partition C:, but my TL15 is in
D:\texlive.  Is this expected behaviour?

Indeed, but it should have logged something into
	tlmgr.log
(in TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c), even in dry-run mode.

No, it hasn't ;-)

Indeed, but it overrides the autobackup option, so well,
for now one has to live with that. 

> What is the correct way to use --dry-run ?

You did nothing wrong - if you don't want any actual action,
use --dry-run .

~$ kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFSYSVAR

~$ less /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log

does not display any pruning action, it only contains
today's update.

Start with
[Fri Apr  8 08:14:32 2016] update: texlive.infra (40294 -> 40301)

Ends with
[Fri Apr  8 08:17:57 2016] update: collection-fontsextra (40207 -> 40334)

OK, I was wondering if perhaps it had to come first or
something like this.

This is expected behavior. The installer does not try to pick up
information about pre-existing TeX installations. But the installer
does warn if it finds another tex directory on the searchpath.

By the way. The test for writability does not seem to work right.
I'll look into that.

Apart from that, for an admin install, the 2016 edition should make
the installation more effectively read-only for non-admin users, at
least for local NTFS-formatted local partitions, and only for Vista
and later.

Hmmm, not completely correct. The text mode installer tries to 
import old settings:
	sub import_settings_from_old_tlpdb()

But that is not supported in the other installers (gui, wizard).

Hi,

there is something I don't understand. When I issue

$ tlmgr conf

I see in the output

=========================== version information ==========================
tlmgr revision 40203 (2016-04-01 01:25:42 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2016
==================== executables found by searching PATH =================
PATH: /Library/TeX/texbin:/some:/colonseparated:/repertories:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin
kpsewhich: /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich
updmap: /Library/TeX/texbin/updmap
fmtutil: /Library/TeX/texbin/fmtutil
tlmgr: /Library/TeX/texbin/tlmgr
tex: /Library/TeX/texbin/tex
pdftex: /Library/TeX/texbin/pdftex
mktexpk: /Library/TeX/texbin/mktexpk
dvips: /Library/TeX/texbin/dvips
dvipdfmx: /Library/TeX/texbin/dvipdfmx

[......]

But "echo $PATH" in Terminal does not have the first
/Library/TeX/texbin, only the last one (which originates from
/etc/paths.d/TeX, as I am on mac os X).

What does the reported PATH correspond too ?

I just tested adding a dummy pdftex executable file in one of the
intermediate repertory (hidden above) and, as expected, "which
pdftex" issued in a new Terminal instance then reports the full
path to the newly created file, not the one which
/Library/TeX/texbin has a (many stages) symlink for.

Thus the initial /Library/TeX/texbin reported above by tlmgr conf
looks like an artefact, or isn't it ?

$ which pdftex
/foo/bin/pdftex

$ sudo rm /foo/bin/pdftex

$ which pdftex
/Library/TeX/texbin/pdftex


By the way I am aware I should rather prepend /Libray/TeX/texbin
from my .bash_profile, rather than have it appended via the
/etc/paths.d/TeX mechanism.

So far, I have had no issue as I don't have other tex
installations, nevertheless perhaps I should do.

/Library/TeX/texbin comes from MacTeX. To learn more, go to

	http://tug.org/mactex/elcapitan.html

and read about TeX and El Capitan, and also go to

	http://tug.org/mactex/multipletexdistributions.html

and read about MacTeX?s support for multiple TeX Distributions.


I think the behavior you report is correct. In Terminal, we append
/Library/TeX/texbin to the end automatically, as most users have
only this link to the TeX binaries, and thus use our mechanism to
handle multiple versions. Sophisticated users can modify $PATH
as they wish.

Hi Dick

thanks for answering but I re-iterate the issue I am pointing out :

$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin

$ tlmgr conf | grep PATH
==================== executables found by searching PATH =================
PATH: /Library/TeX/texbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin
tlmgr: didn't get return value from action conf, assuming ok.

as you see the PATH reported by "tlmgr conf" does not match the one from echo $PATH.

(I have removed from both outputs some repertories I have additionally
to the above; this, I am sure, irrelevant)

Perhaps the tlmgr is prepending /Library/TeX/texbin to its own PATH,
but if this is the case this is confusing to report it as "PATH" to the user,
because the
user will tend to think that calling "pdftex" on the command line
will first look for it in /Library/TeX/texbin. Which is *not* the case.

Thus if one needs to debug something this information from "tlmgr conf"
has the potential to makes thinks more difficult.

Nothing forbids me to add some "pdftex" in a an intermediate repertory
and it is the one which will be used by processes spawned from a Terminal
shell or other processes inheriting my environment.

This is the issue here. It is quite possible than tlmgr actions use
the PATH as reported (that would be logical), but in such case it should
be said that this is the case. Perhaps I overlooked something in the documentation.
I only found

As per /Library/TeX/texbin symlink, 
I created it myself last year in anticipation
that perhaps I would upgrade to Yosemite. But as I don't have a Retina
display and dislike the smartphone looks of Yosemite/El Capitan I stuck
with Mavericks.

It is located at end of PATH, because it is inherited from the
 /etc/paths.d/TeX file which an earlier MacTeX installation
had with TeX file containing "/usr/texbin". I simply adapted it
thus indeed my set-up inherits from MacTeX, but currently I am
on a vanilla TeXLive 2016 pretest install, not on MacTeX.

I also use the TeXDist Preference Pane from bygone years.

By the way, only today did I realize that it insists on 
re-creating the /usr/texbin link which I though I had
suppressed last year.

I upgraded it to 2.7.2 version following a link
from one of the info pages you are pointing to in your message,
but it shows the same behaviour. I will try to check after posting this
if the other version whose name contains "osx 10.10" runs on Mavericks,
so far I didn't even try as that seems doubtful but who know, if it
does surely it will not recreate the /usr/texbin.

I don't see that, and I thought it had been fixed last year. 
For reference, TLU uses

$ tlmgr pdftex paper --list
letter
a4

and I check its exit status.

Hi

I don't read Perl, but it seems that the issue is simply that
the TLPaper.pm

which I find in /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/TeXLive

# $Id: TLPaper.pm 39129 2015-12-17 11:34:14Z preining $
# TeXLive::TLPaper.pm - query/modify paper sizes for our various programs

isn't in sync with the current situation regarding 

/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.dat

which is read by pdftexconfig.tex.

It seems TLpaper.pm wants to examine pdftexconfig.tex but
that was TL2015 set-up and now it will fetch from pdftexconfig.dat

Obviously I am just too impatient and the pretest is really a pretest ;-)

Cheers

Jean-Fran?ois

I get 

$ tlmgr pdftex paper --list
(undefined)
letter
a4

$ echo "$?"
0

I didn't clarify that I have already switched to the pre-test.

I have 

$ kpsewhich --all pdftexconfig.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex

and the file pdftexconfig.tex uses TeX macros to read pdftexconfig.dat

For some reason I have in /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist

a TLPaper Perl module which seems fitted to TL2015, not TL2016.

Yes, TLPaper.pm needs to be updated.  Thanks for the report.

Norbert, the stuff we discussed and you did earlier changed again, so
should probably be ripped out.  Please see the tex-ini-files package
-- there's a new .dat file now.  I'm guessing you can take it from
there, but of course let me know if there's anything more we need to
figure out :).  Thanks, K.

    Perhaps the tlmgr is prepending /Library/TeX/texbin to its own PATH,

That is correct.  We (TL) go to a lot of trouble to prepend the
directory in which executables are found to PATH, for most scripts that
we maintain.  (Still not done for everything, but the basic tl scripts
and mktex* scripts do it now, I believe.)

Undoubtedly it could be documented better (or at all -- I'm not sure if
we actually say it anywhere now except the source code).

    but if this is the case this is confusing to report it as "PATH" to the user,

I understand your point.  On the other hand, it seems to me it would be
equally confusing to report it as anything else, because that value *is*
the PATH value that is being used by tlmgr.  -k

The fix made it to my computer after today's update (svn 40377)

tlmgr backup --clean=0 --all --dry-run

This is the problem:

It's my fault.  At Peter's suggestion, I'm building the TeX Live binaries with 
shared libraries on Cygwin (cygtexlua52-5.dll and three others).  But I didn't 
do whatever is necessary to make sure those libraries get installed.  I'll 
figure it out and fix it.

Sorry for the trouble.

I just did -- added the dlls to the various *.tlpsrc that seemed to

    it fails (shouldn't @INC have
    /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts not /texmf-dist/scripts ?

Indeed.  (It's because it couldn't determine `dirname $0`, essentially.
We should probably abort earlier when that fails.)

    /usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-cygwin/fmtutil: kpsewhich
    -var-value=TEXMFROOT failed, aborting early.

I believe some of the cygwin dll's are missing from the build at the
moment.  I'll fix what I can see for tonight.

Thanks for the report,

TL2016 pretest still with luaotfload 2015/12/09 v2.6 OpenType layout system
but on the other hand the LuaTeX seems newer. Perhaps this is the cause.

Does
luaotfload-tool -u -vvv
also crash?

Here (win32), I tested by eliminating font cache
luaotfload-tool -u -vvv
with success.

Next, lualatex test.tex
with

% test.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
Hello
\end{document}

was ok.

However, lualatex test2.tex
with

% test2.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Kozuka Mincho Pr6N}
\begin{document}
Hello
\end{document}

failed with

... ...

nt #2 to '__index' (invalid option 'orig_pos').

Thus I also think that the present luaotfload is not compatible with the
new fontloader in luatex 0.95.0.
But I don't encounter the crash on win32.

Thanks,
Akira

Sorry I see your message only now.

Yes it did. I did it only after seeing eg9 (wonder who that is ;-) ) on the github tracker.

It crashed with

luaotfload | db : Loading font /System/Library/Fonts/LastResort.ttfSegmentation fault: 11

I am on mac os x.

Following egreg's advice I added LastResort.ttf to the black list.

Then I did again 
    
    luaotfload-tool -u -vvv

with success.

My minimal example then compiled.

Hi, 

sorry for harassment ;-) 

when cherry-picking collections at install time, one is
prompted

Enter letter(s) to select collection(s): 

Perhaps it should read

Enter letter(s) to (de)select collection(s): 

Being brave, I tested and confirm that the letter
acts as a toggle...

(thus perhaps "toggle" or "toggle selection of" ?)

LuaTeX's font loader should be tested for compatibility with LastResort.ttf.
Even if blacklisting is a viable workaround, LuaTeX shouldn't have crashed.

Hi,

I swear I do other things during the day (like eating),
but here it goes again

all three of 

    \setmainfont[BoldFont={* Black}]{Hoefler Text}

    \setmainfont[BoldFont={* Bold}]{Gill Sans}

(and with correct fonts)

common to these fonts is that they are of the *.ttc type

I am on Mac OS Mavericks. These are System fonts there
eitehr in /Library/Fonts or /System/Library/Fonts.

The main font is found, the problem is with the bold one.

(after blacklisting LastResort.ttf to fix previous issue

Subject: [tex-live] luatex bug reporting in tl16
Message-ID: <201604112152.u3BLqvYb024657@freefriends.org>

JF and everyone: there are massive, sweeping, pervasive (emphasis by
redundancy :) changes in luatex this year.  See below for some links.
Just about every package and document using luatex will probably need
some change or another.

Thus, there will be undoubtedly be problems galore, at all levels.  I
expect what you have already reported is just the tip of the iceberg.
The tex-live list is not the place to report these bugs.  The
appropriate people are not, usually, on this list.

If the bug is in the engine itself (crash, discrepancy with
documentation), then it should be reported to the engine developers.

If the bug is with a package, then it should be reported to the package
developers.

If you can't tell whether the bug is with a package or the engine, make
your best guess anyway and write to one or the other.  I know it may not
be obvious.  I know many developers are coy about their contact
information.  I can't solve those things.  But just sending bugs to
tex-live because a lot of people are on this list, as has become common
practice (not just about luatex), is not sustainable.  Sorry to be a
curmudgeon about it, but I see this quickly spiralling out of control.

Thus, unless the bug is with the TL packaging, i.e., we are distributing
stale files or have files in the wrong place, the report shouldn't go
here.

Good luck to us all,
Karl

2) The article Hans wrote for TUGboat, which I previously posted to the
list.  Page numbers are final now, so here is the PDF that will be

one-year moratorium in this case):

hi Karl,

it is only for lack of knowledge on my part on where to report that
I used this list as my main medium ...

I fully sympathize with your concerns. Sometimes it is hard
to identify the place where to report; and to disentangle a priori
if the issue is a LaTeX one, a LuaTeX one, a fontspec one, a luaotfload
one, ... and I admit indeed I considered tex-live mailing list
as a possible way to reach in one sweep all possible kinds of developers,
for these issues I had encountered.

I opened a ticket
https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload/issues/328
about the problem with ttc fonts (at least on mac os x).
People are invited thus to go there for updates.

For the record: I have not all been on the look-out for a systematic
hunt for bugs ! I don't use LuaTeX, only LuaLaTeX and only on one
project, for some reason having to do with using a feature file for
a font.

I tried today to compile the thing and the problem reported arose.
As I am not familiar with LuaTeX development environment and
as testing bugs is really time costly I didn't additionally adventure
on the net for finding the suitable locations.

If things are on GitHub which I am a bit familar with now,
then that's all too easy for me to do all my ticket raising there.

>From following at a long distance I understand the LaTeX team
has already done a massive effort into absorbing the changes,
thus I think perhaps your description is a bit pessimistic
about "changes to all documents": I think those using LaTeX
which is a bit majority of people are to a large extent
"protected" by the already done work at the LaTeX dev repo.

Best
Jean-Fran?ois

Message-ID: <201604112243.u3BMhdcs001241@freefriends.org>

Addendum 1: as J-F pointed out to me privately, due to much work by the
LaTeX developers, straightforward LaTeX documents have a decent chance
of working without change.  (At least once some of the
non-LaTeX-core-but-still-pervasive packages are fixed.)  I still surmise
that pretty much anything that actually uses luatex-specific features
will need changes.

Addendum 2: I should have said that if all you know is that something is
broken and you really don't know where to direct the report, well, that
is what the general help forums are for, such as
http://lists.tug.org/texhax (mailing list),
http://latex-community.org/forum/ (forum),
http://tex.stackexchange.com/ (q&a).

Because it is about non-free fonts, which is out of the
policy of TeX Live.

Message-ID: <20160412072022.GG11600@logic.at>

Dear all using TL pretest,

today I have committed a big bunch of changes to verify integrity
of downloaded packages by cryptographically signatures.

If the rebuild succeeds tonight (which is unlikely, though ;-)
from tomorrow on there should be hardly any change besides some
additional output like:
	$ tlmgr update --list
	cryptographic signature of http://localhost/tlpretest-norb/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512 verified
	tlmgr: package repository http://localhost/tlpretest-norb
	....

In case something breaks badly you can easily disable these checks
using hte new command line option
	--no-verify-downloads

By default *if* a gpg binary is found verification is attempted.

What basically happens is that the tlpdb that is downloaded is checked
against a sha512 checksum, and the sha512 checksum is checked against
a detached gpg signature.

The releases are signed with a GPG key
	0x06BAB6BC TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>
with fingerprint
	C78B 82D8 C795 12F7 9CC0  D7C8 0D5E 5D91 06BA B6BC
(actually with a signing subkey for those interested in details)

This key is signed with both Karl Berry's and mine gpg key:
	0x30D155AD Karl Berry <karl at freefriends.org>
	0x860CDC13 Norbert Preining <norbert at preining.info>
All the three keys are readily available on keyservers for those
who want an even higher level ;-) (BTW, this email is also signed
with my key)

Comment for Windows Users:
I don't expect that the current code works out of the box on
Windows, and even more, I don't guess there are many Windows installations
with gpg binaries in the path.
We are discussing ways to distribute statically linked gpg binaries for
Windows TeX Live users without breaking the extremely stupid export
restrictions and requirements imposed by the US and many other countries.


Please let us know (here on the list) of any probelms you encounter. In
case something breaks, it would be great if you can send the output
of the breaking tlmgr call with -v command line added. Thanks.

All the best

Norbert

Does that mean that Windows users should install pretest from today's
repo state, because after tomorrow it might no longer be possible?

I've delayed until now because I didn't yet notice an official starting
signal from Karl.

No, it means that Windows users will 99% not get any verification,
but installation will still work and tlmgr update etc all as usual.

No worry, we don't lock out Windows users ;-)

You can install it via

Yes I know I can install it (I prefer brew to fink). But my point is that the same problem as for windows installation for Mac' users just wanted to have a Mac TeXLive

My understanding is that unless you happen to be amongst the paranoid
few, you can safely live without GPG verification for TeX Live 2016 just
as you have lived without it for all previous iterations of the suite.

Understood ... so here goes my real question:

There is a huge collection of TeX-ready fonts out there (on CTAN and
elsewhere) which are not available on TL. This is vexing because the
technology to make these installs a single command line like ...

    font-install Antiqua

has been in place for over 2 decades now, but we keep on insisting that all
users make this installs by hand in an extremely cumbersome and rarely
intelligible sequence of commands and edits... making it one of the darkest
corners of TeXLive.

"getnonfreefonts" offers 99% of the infrastructure needed for the job, it
is just a tiny bit that is needed to complete it.

What would be the preferred direction: To have these natively in TL or
installable via a script?

I like this very much! But I'd say we should distribute gpg binary in
that case, just as we distribute xz, xzdec and wget. Building gpg
isn't any more complicated.

I don't know what you are talking about that super simple font
installation, but I can guarantee you - and I have packaged a lot of 
fonts - that font installation cross platform is not trivial.

I even more ... as soon as the first built did run successfully, I will
do test on Windows, too - pre-built tests are a pain and I only
did them on Linux.

Please let me know your findings!

We are talking about fonts that have already been packaged - this is about
installation and not packaging for TeX.

Saying that something is packaged does not give any useful information. How
is it packaged, as zip, rpm, deb, ...? If it is a zip, what is the
directory structure inside it? What is the format of the font, is it MF,
Type 1, TrueType, OpenType? What is the encoding of the font? Which
languages and scripts are supported? If a font is properly packaged, it
means that all this information is present in a metafile understandable to
an infrastructure that is able to put the files to correct directories and
is able to inform the operating system and/or a particular TeX distribution
that the font is available. CTAN usually contains archive files, not
packages. In order to use them a user has to collect all this information
and install the font. There is nothing like super simple font installation
unless it is an OpenType font and you can just copy the *.otf to a system
directory.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.10.1604131805090.12989@newton.feld.cvut.cz>


Hello,

I started with experimenting with tl-pretest and I have found that the 
pdftexcofig.tex file is generally changed. I know that this is common 
Parkinson's law that sowtware is more and more complicated (without 
exlicit needs). This is exactly such example.

A pdfTeX user is not interested that LuaTeX changed its primitives. This 
is LuaTeX problem, not pdfTeX problem. And pdftexconfig.tex is used 
primary in .ini files by pdfTeX. So, more good approach is to keep 
pdftexconfig.tex unchanged and only luatexiniconfig.tex should be adapted 
in order to share the same values given in pdftexconfig.tex. We need not 
to create any new file like pdftexconfig.dat.

Now, the bug description: The \unless primitive cannot be used in the 
pdftexconfig.tex file because there are people they generate pdftex 
format without initializing eTeX. One way to fix this bug is such file:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

% tex-ini-files 2016-02-27: pdftexconfig.tex

% Load shared (PDF) settings in pdfTeX

% This needs a bit of work to read the file line-by-line
\begingroup
   \catcode`\{=1 %
   \catcode`\}=2 %
   \catcode`\#=6 %
   % From apnum.tex
   \def\loop#1\repeat{\def\body{#1\relax\expandafter\body\fi}\body}%
   \let\repeat\fi
   % The format of the data lines themselves is simple
   \def\parse#1 = #2\relax{\expandafter\global\csname pdf#1\endcsname = #2 
}%
   \def\storedpar{\par}%
   % Read the raw data
   \openin0=pdftexconfig.dat %
   \loop\ifeof0 \else
     \read0 to \line
     \ifx\line\storedpar\else
       \if\relax\line\relax
       \else
         \expandafter\parse\line\relax
       \fi
     \fi
   \repeat
\endgroup

\global\pdfoutput = \ifx\dvimode\undefined 1\else 0\fi\relax
\global\let\dvimode\undefined

\endinput

------------------------------------------------------------

But better correction is to keep the pdftexconfig.tex unchanged.

The aim of splitting the data here is that this allows easy parsing of
the shared information by pdfTeX and LuaTeX. Notably, pdftexconfig.tex
has changed over the years in part to try to 'keep up' with Lua(La)TeX.
There are of course other approaches: for example, one could read
pdftexconfig.tex in Lua and try to extract out the relevant data lines.

There's a wider programming idea that 'data' and 'code' are often best
separated, and parsing the older format of pdftexconfig.tex isn't
particularly attractive. As such, the use of a separate .dat file seemed
to me to be by far the best way of handling multiple requirements. Part
of the plan was that this should also be relatively easy for other tools
to pick up on (though what exactly happens there I leave to the TL experts).

pdfTeX has had the extensions for many years, and the standard
format-building routine enables them. Indeed, it's pretty unusual to
want no e-TeX but other additions: normally people who want no e-TeX
want Knuth's TeX90. However, I guess it's reasonable (and doable without
massive complexity) to cover the 'no e-TeX' case here. I'll adjust the
'model' files I've submitted to CTAN and presumably that will be picked
up for TL.

There are about 50 fonts in CTAN which are in TDS and are not part of
TeXLive. If is zip, tar, rpm ... it is not really different, the important
part if that TDS organization is ready.

Now the format is all over the place: MF, Type 1, TrueType ... and a LOT of
that work to classify them will have to be done. But my point is -- this
should be done only ONCE and then all users of TeXLive could reap the
benefits, instead of the situation that we have right now where this has to
be re-done and re-done by each individual user ... and probably with a very
low rate of success because of the cumbersome process.

15 years ago there was a reason to keep some fonts out of TeXLive - the
space on the CD being probably the most important, but right now there
seems to be no reason to keep them out.

There are two ways to do it:

  A- Include them on TeXLive

  B- Make their download and installation automatic via a script.

and my question was essentially -- which way is preferable?

There are NO reasons why font-installation should not be a completely
automated process. It is like that already for some (the 10 fonts covered
by getnonfreefonts, MathTimePro, MinionMath, ...) but the scripts are
proliferating without any need for it. The script for the last two
literally mimic getnonfreefonts line by line.

Can you give some examples? The antiqua font you mentioned in your
first posting is part of texlive:
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/urw-antiqua.

> but right now there seems to be no reason to keep them out.

As Norbert already mentioned the main reason to keep fonts out are
the license. E.g. garamondx is missing as it has a "Do Not Sell
Except by Arrangement" license (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/garamondx). 

I wonder why you are asking on the texlive list that they provide
scripts to install fonts which have a license which doesn't allow to
include them im texlive.

Maybe, there exist a sed/grep etc. scripts for parsing the old format of 
pdftexconfig.tex. Now, somebody changes this file. This is totally unfair.
Please, keep the old format of pdftexconfig.tex. You cannot imagine how 
many automatons exist in various linux computers based on the old format 
of pdftexconfig.tex.

It is simple to share these data with LuaTeX. LuaTeX is able to set the 
old names of these seven primitives in \begingroup \endgroup environment, 
set \globaldefs=1 and do \input pdftexconfig, if needed. And all is more 
simple.

"pdftex -ini" is default starting point for pdfTeX and this default does 
not indludes eTeX extensions. You cannot generalize what is "prety 
unusual" only from the state of your computer.

Isn't exactly the point, Ulrike ?  Whether one thinks it a good idea or
not, TeX Live has a policy of excluding anything that it deems
"non-free", so it cannot (by definition) include these fonts.  But an
open-source script (i.e., "free", in the TeX Live sense) that a user can
use to /add/ such fonts to his or her own personal TeX Live
installation, is surely a Good Thing [tm], and its inclusion in TeX Live
can only be of benefit.

But as you should know texlive doesn't include tools which have the
sole/main purpose to support something unfree.

But isn't the question just why there aren't more fonts supported by getnonfreefonts?

It is clear that the tool it self cannot be included in TL as per policy.

But what keeps the script from supporting more available non-free fonts?

Microsoft Windows is "something unfree", yet TeX Live includes support
for it.  One might reasonably assume that this is because the TeX Live
developers recognise that a very large number of people choose to use
Microsoft Windows (I am one), and that to disenfranchise them would not
be in anyone's interest.  Why, then, discriminate against those (again,
such as myself) who wish to use unfree fonts as well as an unfree
operating system ?

sed/grep and other tools are not available in Windows, they will have to be
compiled and distributed with TL. I now that GNU utilities have already
been compiled for Windows and can be downloaded from somewhere but normal
Windows users do not have them.

I see a distinction between providing support for a free program that 
runs on an unfree operating system and supporting non-free programs that 
run on unfree operating systems.

TeX Live does not support Windows as well as it does not suppor Mac and
OS/2 although it runs there. TeX Live does not help you to install Windows
and run them, this is the difference.

Perhaps nobody did sent Reinhard a nice mail and asked him to
support a font ...

It can be automatic if all fonts are packaged exactly the same way. If you
do not force all font authors to pack the distribution in an exactly the
same way, the script will sooner or later crash.

I can show you a ton of fonts for which that will NOT work! And that you
have to disable some Map's and enable others in oredr to make it work.

Is GPL good enough? What license are acceptable and which ones are not?

"Antiqua" for example is on CTAN, available under GPL but not on TeXLive.

With the additional information on how they are packaged it should be
enough. A few subroutines to deal with each class... and the info laid out
in a flat DB should be all that is required.

getnonfreefonts is the counter-example of what you saying above. It install
10 different fonts which are packaged in different ways, and it does it
beautifully.

So do I.  But (an enhanced version of) "getnonfreefonts" is (a) not
unfree, and (b) does not run only on unfree operating systems.  So I am
not clear what point you are seeking to make.

I think even Bill Clinton would have thought twice before making that

TLContrib, <http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/>, is a TeX Live-compatible
repository from where packages not accepted to TeX Live can be easily
downloaded. I don?t know how well-maintained it still is, but it
suffices as a proof-of-concept.

TeX Live does not contain installation images of Windows, Mac and other
operating systems, does not contain documentation of these systems, does
not even contain instructions how to obtain them, install them or run them,
hence there is no support for these systems, I am pretty sure. TL only
supports free programs so that they work on several operating systems
including the non-free ones.

No, getnonfreefonts is a script that can install selected fonts where the
packages were manually tweaked by Reinhard (or maybe somebody else too).

Yes, I am indeed volunteering to do a lot of the work, but I can't seem to
get the simplest of all questions answered. What would be the best way (for
TeXLive) to do this:

 A- Placing the fonts in the TeXLive installation

 B- Writing a script that will take care of the font installation after the
TeXLive install.

Correct! I agree with you that some of these fonts are not properly
packaged.

Well, the answer is simple:

1.  Package the fonts in the TL-compatible format

2.  Put them into http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/

3.  Ask the users who want these font to add
    http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/ to their repository list.

Hi Paulo,

    What would be the best way (for TeXLive) to do this:

    A- Placing the fonts in the TeXLive installation

    B- Writing a script that will take care of the font installation after the
    TeXLive install.

If the fonts are available under a free license, upload a new version to
CTAN (with the author's permission, etc., etc. ... good luck) and I will
endeavor to install them in TL.  To the best of my knowledge, all of the
free fonts on CTAN are already in TL.

If the fonts are available only under a nonfree license, patch
getnonfreefonts to support them and send the patch to Reinhard Kotucha.

If you can convince font authors to switch from nonfree to free, that is
great.

(As mentioned before: Antiqua has been in TL, and TL's predecessors,
since the font was first freely released in the 1980s or so.  That's the
only specific font you've mentioned.  So I don't see anything I can do
right now.)

best,
karl

Karl,

What can you do to convince me that Antiqua is part of TeXLive?

The TUG.dk Font Catalogues says very clear on the page:

    http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/antiqua/

"Antiqua is *not* part of TeX Live."

If I try: "kpsewhich antiqua.sty"  or "kpsewhich uaqrrc.afm"

it comes back with nothing and if I try to process a file from the
font-package I get:

! LaTeX Error: File `antiqua.sty' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: sty)

So in what "form" is Antiqua a part of TeXLive???

Dear Dick,
I've now added

 | Some systems (Mac OS/X, BSD) provide <tt>curl</tt> instead of
 | <tt>wget</tt>.  In this case type
 | <pre>
 |    curl --remote-name https://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
 |    texlua install-getnonfreefonts
 | </pre>

to the web page you mentioned above.

On Windows getnonfreefonts itself uses wget.exe provided by TeX Live.
On Unix it checks whether wget is in PATH.  If not, it checks whether
curl is available.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In addition to what David said, from
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/antiqua :

    Con?tained in:
      TeX?Live as an?ti?qua
      MiKTeX as an?ti?qua

and "texdoc antiqua" will pull up the documentation.

The Font Catalogue webpage must be referring to this LaTeX package
(that is, a .sty file) only. The font is there in TeX Live, but for
whatever reason this particular support package is not. I'm not sure
I'm qualified enough to understand why, though.

Hope this helps to convince you. :-)

I see that antiqua.sty is on CTAN in psfonts/urwvf/latex2e/antiqua.sty.
The story of urwvf is too long to go into.  I'll review the situation again.

Oh, many people did.  And they asked politely.  I'm sad that I had to
disappoint them all.

There are a few constraints:

 * I'm not willing to provide TeX support files unless I can provide
   the actual fonts as well.

 * I only support fonts which cannot be *distributed* freely.

 * I only support fonts which can be *used* without any restriction,
   even in commercial environments.

 * Both, the fonts and the TeX support files must be downloadable
   from reliable servers.  CTAN is certainly the most reliable one.

 * The fonts have to be useful.  There are many fonts in the internet
   which do not even support the full ASCII character set and thus are
   completely useless in the TeX world.

Thus, only very few fonts can be supported.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Indeed.  As a linux user who has had to, again, find time to look at
ttf and otf fonts in general (thanks, kde, for recommending Noto), it
appears to me that *most* online sources of fonts give *zero*
information about licensing.  Perhaps users of non-free OS's do not
care about licensing.

There are a few reputable fonts sites which list fonts along with
their licenses.  And from those I can see many fonts.  From the
sites which ignore licenses there are hundreds, probably thousands,
of ttf and otf fonts.

So if you want to have everything available, why not just, outside
of texlive, download all of them ?  Of course, having *too_many*
fonts makes document creation outside of texlive with a particular
font awkward - but that is O/T for a texlive list.

But perhaps I am misunderstanding - for modern text I prefer to use
xelatex with fontspec (I care about being able to render *all*
current languages/scripts which I might find online) so I only really
care about ttf and otf files - the original question was perhaps
aimed at other font types and other engines ?

Unfair? Maybe call it development? We have changed several
configuration file formats a few times, due to needs and
convenience.

We don't do these kind of things lightly, but it happens.

Nothing *unfair* here.

In TL we are having 
	pdftex -ini ... '*pdfetex.ini' 
which activates the eTeX extensions.

And that is the fact since several years AFAIR.

And *you* cannot generalize what is usual from *your* computer's state.

Fact shows, that it is different.

This is entirely true but the file was never intended for wider use.
It's part of the 'system dependent' code that is used by TeX
distributions. (The settings here are about TeX Live not pdfTeX 'per
se'). In particular, I note that if you look at other TeX distributions
(most obviously MiKTeX) the file may be different. (Yes, it's highly
likely that Linux users are using TL but I'm looking at this from the
wider POV.)

The file has been changes several times over the years and does not have
a documented format.

> Please, keep the old format of pdftexconfig.tex. 

This is ultimately a call for the TeX Live developers. I've written some
suggested files which they are free to take, ignore or modify.

It's more complex than that as in LuaTeX we'd have to track which
primitives we'd enabled that way and clean them up afterwards (so that
the config file has no impact on primitive availability). (Using the Lua
interface doesn't help if relying on reading a file written in TeX
primitives.) Moreover, that leaves issues for any other format that also
needs this data: the settings are originally for pdfTeX but are really
for 'TeX formats generating direct PDF output', which covers more that
"pdftex".

I wasn't, but rather from the nature of the formats one gets from a
standard TeX installation. Both of the 'big' distributions (TeX Live and
MiKTeX) build formats with e-TeX enable other than for "tex". There's no
particular need to build new formats with the extensions disabled even
if you don't like them: you can simply not use them, and TeX will behave
as it always has (though of course with direct PDF output).

As I've said, I'd be happy to adjust my suggestion so it will work for
non-e-TeX cases. I can see your point about scripts so I can look at
dealing with renames from the LuaTeX end, though I'm mindful that this
might not be too popular with the TL team at this stage. I'll wait to
hear from them before doing anything.

As I've noted in my other reply, I guess I can make a suggestion that
avoids altering pdftexconfig.tex (or rather simplifies it slightly from
the 2015 version) and works with LuaTeX using Petr's suggestion of
\globaldefs. Would this work for the TL developers?

Baaahhh, everythiing works, it just creates work on our side.
We need to parse the files for the paper configuration (TLPaper),
and I need to adjust that for every change.

THus, from my point of view I am happy with the current code 
and would prefer no further changes.

If I want something is the option to load *additional* .dat files
(Debian Dev hat on) so that paper size configuration can be
separated into another file. But I can do this myself, too.

Yes. Almost all such change brought problems in the past. But I don't want 
to return to them.

We expect a development in (relatively) new sofware like LuaTeX, XeTeX. 
But pdfTeX is very old and many people use it for its (relatively) 
stability as an engine with direct output to PDF and with microtypographic 
enhancements. And changing the core .tex file used in .ini files for 
pdfTeX is a bad message: "no, pdfTeX is not stable".

It *is unfair* when you are doing it in (relatively) stable software.

No only one. There are manuals on internet which describe internals of 
TeXlive configuration. People use them. For example the discussion about 
"tlmgr paper" a few days ago is *only one* example of many others similar 
problems. Do you know how many linux distributions use pdftexconfig.tex 
directly in other manner than how it is used in TeXlive?

"*pdftex.ini" is only one way how to generate pdftex which is based on 
etex.src. People can use many other ways, for example without etex.src.

If fact, there is -enc extension in pdftex (since 2000, i.e. "several 
years") and I don't expect that "it is pretty unusual to want no encTeX".

It is evident that there is a bug in pdftexconfig.ini because \unless is 
used here. I hope that this needs no more discussion.

Sorry, this is not only my copmuter's state. People, for example, use my 
books where behavior of software is described. When it is changed by 
blusterous developers then this part of the book gets to be invalid. The 
last case of this type was the changing behavior of --no-virtual option in 
the otftotfm. Kerns and ligatures were generated but newly they are not 
generated. Unless exactly we need not to use virtual fonts for implementig 
this. And my new book (TeX pro pragmatiky) gets to be invalid on page 132. 
The *printed* form of this book were sent to hundreds TeX users:(.

This is reason why I am very deliberate during each "development" change.

I?ve been ignoring TLContrib for some time now, and I feel kind of bad 
about it. It needs updating to support the current and next TL releases.

In my defence, people have not exactly been pounding on my door demanding
action. I will try and find time to do some maintenance, but it would
be really nice if there was a volunteer willing to take over. TLContrib
consists of a bunch of perl scripts and a subversion backend for storage,
in case anyone is interested. If nobody jumps in, then I will try to do 
some work myself sometime next month.

Best wishes,

I looked at miktex when the discussion came up and see that in the
main there is the new pdftexconfig.tex, and the pdftexconfig.dat in
a tex/generic/config2 (remark the 2) folder. 

There is also a   pdftexconfig.dat.in   which contains entries like

      pageheight       = @page_height@
 
but this is in a tex/generic/config folder along with some
luatexconfig-file. 

In the user data-tree in the Appdata-Roaming I could find a
pdftexconfig.tex (problably generated automatically) with "normal"
entries like 
\pdfcompresslevel=9
\pdfdecimaldigits=3

Miktex has also in pdftex/config/ a pdftex.cfg which contains
entries like

compress_level 9
decimal_digits 3

and was/is (if I remember correctly) used to generate the
pdftexconfig.tex. 

This makes all a bit unsorted impression. 

Has miktex been informed about the changes in the pdftexconfig
structure?

(I personally like the split between data and code, and actually in
miktex it has already be used, as the data was in the cfg).

Hello Ulrike,

I did include Christian on the earlier discussion about this as it's not
TeX Live-specific. Obviously this is all just model data so he's free to
do what he likes on it!

Update sent to CTAN using Petr's suggested version of \loop and also
adjusting xelatex.ini to avoid directly using \protected.

There is another aspect not discussed yet. If a user looks into an ini 
file and sees \input pdftexconfig then his/her first idea is: what this 
file does do? And he/she looks into pdftexconfig.tex. When the original 
format is here then avarage user needs two seconds to understand it 
because there are only nine clear and understandable lines. He/she can 
copy it to the working directory, modify values and re-generate format, 
for example. Or he/she can set these values in the document directly. We 
call this situation: "simplicity is power". On the other hand, if there is 
pdftexconfig.tex as suggested, average user is lost. He/she don't see the 
reading process of pdftexconfig.dat because this is not mentioned in .log 
nor on terminal when generating format.

I know many TeX users, I am consulting TeX problems on email continuosly 
(hundreds emails of this type per year), so I know, what avarage user is 
able to understand. And I know that there are many various methods of 
using pdfTeX, not only with eTeX enabled and with etex.src loaded. And, of 
course, not only LaTeX:).

I vote to keep simplicity, i.e. the pdftexconfig.tex can look like:

---------------------------------------------------------------

% pdftexconfig.tex

% Paper size: dimensions given in absolute terms
\pdfpageheight       = 297 true mm
\pdfpagewidth        = 210 true mm

% Enable PDF 1.5 output and thus more compression
\pdfminorversion     = 5
\pdfobjcompresslevel = 2

% Low-level settings unlikely ever to need to change
\pdfcompresslevel    = 9
\pdfdecimaldigits    = 3
\pdfpkresolution     = 600
\pdfhorigin          = 1 true in
\pdfvorigin          = 1 true in

--------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in another mail, in the end this comes down to what works for
the TeX Live team. I can arrange to load such a file for LuaTeX (and
other cases) but need to know that they would be happy. Norbert has
already indicated that he'd rather not have to deal with further changes
in the data format (even though this would be going back to a form from
a few years ago).

I note that's quite similar to pdftexconfig.dat :-) Missing the
\pdfoutput line which presumably should also be there.

Depending on the outcome of discussion, I will make sure the loader adds
a line to the log stating that the .dat file has been read.

If it is a simple format then it is good and no problem. But if it is convoluted TeX code I have to parse I'm not happy.

Petr's proposal as well as the dat file are both fine for me, but the simpler the better, and best it is if it is the same file for all formats/engines.

Of course. But if you could tell me how the inclusion of an item of free
software (such as "getnonfreefonts") in a free software distribution
(such as TeX live) would violate any licence, I would be interested to know.

Phil please, don't play the complete ignorant.

No license problem, but policy problem.

That has been stated about a hundred times, and I am sure you are well aware.

If you are unhappy with the policy, feel free to make your own TeX distribution or take over maintainance if you think you can.

I don't "play" anything, Norbert; Reinhard stated that the inclusion of
"getnonfreefonts" in TeX Live would violate a licence, and I asked
"how"; as simple as that.

> No license problem, but policy problem.

That is a completely different kiddle of fish. It was always my
belief that the matter was a political one rather than a contractual
one, but Reinhard stated otherwise; therefore it was important that
the situation be clarified so that all are aware of the realities.

Taco,

Are there scripts etc somewhere available? Can you push them eg to github?

Consider the following example, to be compiled with pdftex -shell-escape

\input knuth

\input "|echo x"
\input "|echo x"

The log file contains

The knuth.tex file appears to being input four times, but it isn't. So it's
probably a small issue of some string that's not cleared.

Curiously enough, the log is fine if story.tex is input instead of
knuth.tex:

I guess the difference is that \vfill\eject is executed before ending the
input.
If I do

\input knuth\relax\vfill\eject

the log contains

This is just a preparation for the upcoming modifications. The two 
config directories will be merged/cleaned-up when I put the new LuaTeX 
into the main repository.

I am watching the parallel universe (i.e., I'm reading the TL mailing 
lists ). The final MiKTeX setup will closely resemble the TL setup.

I raised this with the pgf team a while ago: I'll do so again.

I made a bug report some days ago:
https://sourceforge.net/p/pgf/bugs/384/

You can get around the problem with 

\def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-pdftex.def} %for texlive 2016

before you load pgf/tikz etc.

Correct. My script looks for the .sty file. And it is not part of TeX
Live. I never considered the possibility that latex support file is
*not* part of TeX Live while the font itself is not. I still don't know
whether to characterise the font as included in TeX Live or not...

Hi Palle,

    My script looks for the .sty file. And it is not part of TeX Live. 

I'm sure this is not the only such case.  

    I never considered the possibility that latex support file is *not*
    part of TeX Live while the font itself is not.

It is not uncommon for the font and LaTeX support to be developed by
different people at (radically) different times.

Also, some fonts are available only in OTF/TTF format.  For these, no
.sty (or .map, .tfm, etc.) file would be normal.  I see you do scan for
this, e.g., GNU Freefont (should be "GNU" not "Gnu" btw) and XITS are
listed as "OTF only".  (And they are listed as "part of TeX Live", yay.)

However, the Asana-Math package, with fonts Asana-Math.otf and
ASANA.TTC, http://ctan.org/pkg/asana-math is not listed on
http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/opentypefonts.html.
Not sure what happened there.

(BTW, on that page, and about.html and anywhere else, "Opentype" should
be "OpenType". :)
    
    I still don't know whether to characterise [antiqua] as included in
    TeX Live or not...

For now, don't worry about it.  If there are problems getting
antiqua.sty into TL, I'll write you.  It won't happen instantly, but it
should be doable.

I see about.html starts with:
  The aim of The LaTeX Font Catalogue is to display all free fonts
  available for easy use with LaTeX, 
                              ^^^^^
so at least it is consistent for antiqua.sty to be omitted ...

Hi,

Dear all,

> today I have committed a big bunch of changes to verify integrity
> of downloaded packages by cryptographically signatures.

After a few days of fighting with rebuilding and fixing, the changes
have finally landed today in tlpretest. 

For those who have already installed tlpretest: You *cannot* update with
	tlmgr update --self
but have to use the
	update-tlmgr-latest
method.

Please report strange happenings here, best with tlmgr -v ...

For Windows users
-----------------
(the following is my personal project and not affiliated with TeX Live or TUG!)
If you want to have gpg verification on Windows without installing
gnupg manually, you can install a package prepared by me via:
	tlmgr --repository http://www.preining.info/tlgpgwin32/ install texlive.gpg.win32


Warning for all users
---------------------
As tlpretest has not started officially ;-) all this might change again.


Some remarks from the first email:
> In case something breaks badly you can easily disable these checks
> using hte new command line option
> 	--no-verify-downloads


ALl the best

User jfbu on mac os x 10.9.5 reports that all went fine.

gpg as installed via Fink (also gpg2 but I gather it is not used).

Yes, sorry just saw it (I'm reading the list in a newreader in a

After the confusion with the self-update the update worked fine, but
gpg isn't used (windows 7):

Thanks for the report, I will check. There program detection on Windows hasn't seen much (means no) testing by now ;-)

I only checked that with the packages I prepared it works.

Will report back.

Hi all,

what is the exact syntax? I installed tlpretest just before cryptographical
extensions were introduced and had no time to test anything, not even
update. Now update fails because update-tlmgr-latest is not recognized. I
tried to first update -self but it does not help either. I have repeated
the actions with -v, see below.

Hi Zdenek,

You need to get the file
    update-tlmgr-latest.sh
>From the tlpretest directory and run it while having tlmgr in the path.

It will update the TeX Live installation where the tlmgr resides to the latest infra stuff.

Hi Norbert,

thank you, now it works. I already have the keys from the keyserver so the
message is:

[wagner at hroch486 texlive]$ tlmgr update -self -all
cryptographic signature of
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512
verified

I have noticed one slight problem: update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha512 does not
contain the right file name, it contains revision number instead of
"latest", thus sha512sum -c update-tlmgr-latest.sh.sha512 reports an
unexisting file. I have edited this file, change the name and the checksum
was reported as correct. Probably I could also mak a hard link and the
result would be the same,

Hi Zdenek,


>thank you, now it works. I already have the keys from the keyserver so


No need for that. We ship the TeX Live key in tlpkg/gpg and use that as home dir for gpg. From the user side no action is necessary.

Only the super paranoid can verify the TeX Live distribution key with Karl's and my key.

Indeed, thanks, will try to fix that.

> gpg as installed via Fink (also gpg2 but I gather it is not used).

I haven't tested tlmgr yet, but I wanted to say something about GPG on Mac.
I too have both gpg and gpg2 installed (via MacPorts, respectively GPG
1.4.19 and 2.0.29).
Of course I would prefer tlmgr to use gpg2 (gpg is installed only as
dependency of another package).
Would it be possible (at least on Mac, I don't know if it may be of
interest for other platforms) to first search for gpg2 in the path and
then, if not found, for gpg?

Best wishes.
Davide

Gpg will not interfere with the user's gpg files!! We call gpg with --homedir ..../tlpkg/gpg

Nothing will be touched in the user's directory.

Thus, I don't see a particular need to search for other gpg versions.

What is the reason you would prefer gpg2?

On my machine gpg could (and probably will, in a not so distant
future) be uninstalled, as soon as it will not be needed as a
dependency anymore; on the other hand I'll surely keep gpg2 installed.
It's not a matter of disk space (of course GPG is rather lightweight),
but I'm sure I won't remember to install gpg, may I change machine or
need to reinstall in the (again, probably not so distant) future.
Best wishes.

You have to download update-tlmgr-latest.sh from the tlpretest repository
and run it. Afterwards you will be able to work with tlmgr as usual
(announced by Norbert a few hours ago).

update-tlmgr-latest

manually

The pretest period has not officially started, thus you should be aware that Problems mit arise and should read the mailing list here.

The last about 10 E-Mails were mostly concerning this topic and I have made an announcement that updated with tlmgr directly will not work.

Please don't run pretest if you are not willing to actively read this mailing list, and wait till 2016 is released.

You need to update using update-tlmgr-latest.sh

You will use update-tlmgr-latest.exe in Windows, everything is available
from the tlpretest repository.

\pdfxxx commands not being defined will be a common theme with the new luatex.

Package authors have mostly been notified for uses that show up
searching the texlive tree but
until the packages are updated you can (usually) put

\RequirePackage{luatex85}

as the first line of the document to alias all the pdftex and other
names that have been removed in recent luatex.

Ok, I just wrote a note there.  (It should only be an issue for a couple
days until non-Mac people on the pre-gpg pretest have updated.  We don't
intend to change texlive.tlpdb directives again.)

BTW, at this point the only reason I still haven't made the official
pretest request/announcement is due to the one more (hopefully last)
paper size change.  Hopefully that will all go in shortly (I just
committed the ini files) and tonight's build will be a reasonable

Subject: [tex-live] Uploading a new CTAN package - how to specify
 dependencies?
Message-ID: <CAMRzUNm6nt4wh2WX+m2W=+-MmNaiFZ4bw+bgmW1Gq_9ysCpXZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am about to upload a new CTAN package. Since internally it has several
relatively independent
pieces, I would like to structure it as two or three separate CTAN packages.

The question is - how do I specify the dependencies? The dependency
structure I have in mind
is like this:

churchslavonic
     |
     |- fonts-churchslavonic
     |
     |- hyphen-churchslavonic

The goal is to make TL automatically pull and install fonts and hyphenation
patterns when "churchslavonic" is installed.

I am aware of "tlobj" and "tlsrc" files, but I have trouble finding out how
can I include them
(or equivalent info) into the CTAN upload.

Please, advise

Regards,
-Mike

Good idea.

You cannot but write in the README or similar.

That can be done on our side ...

> I am aware of "tlobj" and "tlsrc" files, but I have trouble finding out how

By using these files, but they have *nothing* to do with CTAN.
Please do NOT upload any of tlpsrc or tlpobj files to CTAN, it only
creates more work.

Thanks.

> can I include them
> (or equivalent info) into the CTAN upload.

Simply write what is necessary. And *after* the files have been 
included in TL, check and report if there are any problems.

Thanks.

Actually, that will *not* be fixed. Sorry. The reason is that these
are links, and we do not want to change the name in the original.

If you want to check the checksum, please download (or rename)
the versioned file.

Thanks.

In the near future I will implement the following logic:
if TEXLIVE_GPG env variable is set -> use it
else if there is gpg -> use it
else if there is gpg2 -> use it
else do not verify.

Hope that works for you.

I did install your gpg package on a win 10 and this worked fine.
Here on the win 7 I have the external gpg installed. I choose the
standard location and so its path is 
C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\pub

and I get the following error from tlmgr:

verification failed, output:
Der Befehl "C:/Program" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder
konnte nicht gefunden werden.

verification failed, output:
Der Befehl "C:/Program" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder
konnte nicht gefunden werden.

Looks like missing quotes ...

Suggestion: The message "Setting up gpg did not succeed!" sounds like a
severe error. It could make users worry that something went seriously
wrong and results in a broken setup.

What about changing the phrasing such that it becomes clear that this is
just for info? Perhaps something like "Couldn't detect gpg so will
proceed without verification".

For the rest I should say that I've installed pretest today on my
Windows box. Setup worked as usual and everything is fine for me so far.

Ahh,indeed.

You could try to edit TLUtils.pm, search for 
	sub gpg_verify_signature {
and below that change the
	run_cmd("$::gpg ...
to
	run_cmd("\"$::gpg\" ...
the otherg args are already quoted, but not the prog itself.

If you do it, let me know whether it worked out. Thanks

Hi Ulrike,

> NO, scrap that ... sorry ......

Ok, I have now committed a working version. I have tried it myself
on Windows 10 with gpg(4win) installed in C:\Programs (x32) or similar.

Will be in tomorrows update (if rebuild succeeds).

All the best

Norbert

Last night's build included the hopefully-final paper size hacking (many
thanks to Norbert and Joseph) and more signature hacking (Norbert
again).  So, I hereby declare the pretest officially open for business,
with thanks to everyone who has already been trying the pre-pretest :).

The binaries are surely not 100% final, but should be close.  I'm not
aware of any specific stoppers or pending changes at this time.  (Not
all platforms are updated yet.)  There will be at least one more build
of the binaries, but they're certainly worth trying now.  This includes
asymptote.

The pdftex, xetex, and TeX Live guide documentation have not been
updated yet, among others.  I hope all that will converge fairly soon.

Regular updates from CTAN will continue (into the pretest) for another
few weeks.

Good luck to us all,
Karl

Is there a need to re-install or are these changes distributed through
the regular update?

Hi

Yes there was a hiccup in the automatic signing due to introduction of a new script for signing instead of copying the same invocations in several places.

This has been fixed already and tomorrow there will be signatures again for the TeX live.tlpdb.

There are no sha256 anymore, tlu needs to be updated to use the sha512 files.

Howdy,

Just installed MacTeX-2016 pretest without problems. As far as I know it was built using TeX Live 2016 pretest of late 4/16.

There still seems to be problem with setting the default paper size for pdftex. It continues to be undefined when running

tlmgr paper

even though I've run

tlmgr paper letter

and tlmgr reports it having been set for pdftex and rebuilds the formats.

Hi Ulrike

Today is already bed time here, will check tomorrow. Maybe the changes to adapt for gpg and gpg2 have brought some regression.

I made a fix yesterday before the rebuild. Maybe this fix did not make it into the current MacTeX build. After running the updater to the latest infra, do you still see this problem?

I installed MacTeX 2016 pretest today and there seems to be a serious problem with lua(la)tex and/or luaotfload. The following MWE currently fails to compile with lualatex:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
Hello world.
 \end{document}

Luaotfload starts to generate a new database and then crashes. Here?s the end of the log:

luaotfload | db : Font names database not found, generating new one.
luaotfload | db : This can take several minutes; please be patient.

Howdy,

Using <http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest> I seem to have the latest texlive.infra. I'll wait until tomorrow and see if it's updated again.

Thanks for all you hard work.

Howdy,

I just noticed that /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex has paperheight and paperwidth rather than \pdfpaperheight and \pdfpaperwidth. I know that there are changes for luatex (I don't know if this is one of them) but then there is a problem with paper size for pdftex.

Good Luck,

Howdy,

Sigh that should be `page' instead of `paper': pageheight and pagewidth instead of \pdfpageheight and \pdfpagewidth.

PS: Looking back this may have been reported and discussed before.

Good Luck,

I don't have that location from a pure TeX Live install but

/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex

which does have (today) 

\pdfpageheight       = 297 true mm
\pdfpagewidth        = 210 true mm

maybe your ran some extra scripts ?

Best

I do have a texmf-config repertory but it is empty apart from an ls-R file

no \pdfpaperheight / \pdfpaperwidth and looking in pdftex manual I see no reference to those

  Thanks for the report.  It may be a side effect of the rise in the
total number of classes to 4096.  I'll investigate.

Karl,

I am deeply interested in your review of the situation because I have 48
other fonts in the same (or similar) situation and would be nice to
understand the problem.

As soon as I have it, I'll review the other ones and send you a more
complete list ...

Thanks, that did the trick.

Still, there are a couple of problems with the latest version of lua(la)tex. I realize that most if not all of time are due to not yet updated packages, still, I thought it would be good to report them.

The following commands break the compilation:

\pdfminorversion
\pdfcompresslevel
\pdfobjcompresslevel

I guess this is a result of the recent luatex cleanup, but from a quick googling I could not find any reference for this.

Pgf has serious problems; for example, calling the package todonotes results in the following error:

> ! Package pgf Error: Driver file ``pgfsys-luatex.def'' not found..
> 
> See the pgf package documentation for explanation.

Ulrike Fischer seems to have reported this problem already, see https://sourceforge.net/p/pgf/bugs/384/

Microtype also does not work at the moment, I get the following error:

Finally, I get the following message (which is not fatal) dozens of times:

Let me know, if you need more specific information on any of these issues.

Please -- if you are trying out the pretest -- you should also check

Subject: [tex-live] gregorio program in shell_escape_commands
Message-ID: <201604172343.u3HNhpXB012168@freefriends.org>

Hello TeX Live folk,

As I mentioned in the pretest news
(http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html), and as some of you may have seen
on this list a while ago, Elie (Roux) requested adding the gregorio
utility program to shell_escape_commands.  It is part of their
gregoriotex package (http://ctan.org/pkg/gregoriotex) for typesetting
Gregorian chant.

Issues such as memory overruns, checking return values, running
valgrind, etc, have been dealt with.  The program should pay attention
to kpathsea texmf.cnf paranoia settings and (in the TL binary) not call
out to external programs.  Here is a description of some of the work and
research:
  https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/issues/697

I couldn't find anything problematic in the current code, so I've gone
ahead and added it to shell_escape_commands for the pretest.
(Thanks for all the hard work, Elie, Henry, and friends.)

Any further review or testing would be all to the good, of course.
Upstream repository:
https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio

Sources in TL:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/gregorio/gregorio-src/

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. This is the first program added to shell_escape_commands since we
invented it a few years ago.  For those who may not be familiar with it,
the idea is to allow TeX programs to execute these programs (and only
these programs) even when --shell-escape has not been enabled; it's the
list allowed by --shell-restricted, which is enabled *by default*, due
to shell_escape=p in texmf.cnf.

Since I'm here, for the record, the full list is, as of right now:
shell_escape_commands = \
bibtex,bibtex8,\
extractbb,\
gregorio,\
kpsewhich,\
makeindex,\
mpost,\
repstopdf,\

Well, I have to support old versions of tlmgr. Maybe introducing
another version check won't be a big deal; I'll have to look
closer.

But ... well, yes, might be annoying, but it is correct, the
authenticity of the packages cannot be verified. This is a
new feature introduced very recently.

Probably you have gpg on Linux, and see a different message, namely

Ok, I see that loading 'luatex85' helps. So perhaps this is a
compatibility issue between 'geometry' and the new luatex engine.

Shouldn't TL comes with that gpg program for OS on which it is installed?

After all, it already has wget, xz etc. for (almost) every platform on 
which TL is installed.. or not?

No, unfortunately no. Complain to stupid export restrictions. It post us an army of lawyers.

But there is my personal project of atlmgr repository for a package shipping agpg. Feel free to search the archives, I announced it 2 days ago.

More soon on a webpage.

Just an aside on this debate: 

When I had to set up an all new OS X Mavericks system in 2014, I installed gpg from MacPorts, as I used to on 10.4--10.6.8. Shortly after that, the enigmail project announced they would drop support for gpg and replace it with gpg2. So I installed gpg2, only to find that enigmail on the Mac is incompatible with enigmail on Windows. I could only communicate with other Mac users. I remember longish threads on both the enigmail, and a gpg list at the time about those problems, which finally stem from Werner Koch's idea to have a demon running in the background which does not work as it should on platforms other than Linux. 

I still have gpg installed on my machine, but I stopped using it actively after that test. And I don't think it's a good idea to depend on a user-installed gpg for TeX Live because there are issues that depend on the packaging system you select and the flavour of OS X, etc. you are running. Everything else the Linux developers are keen to bring into the game is shipped with TeX Live on other platforms, including a complete Perl installation, etc. I think, too, this should be a part of the installation, or you should please think about other ways to verify the integrity of packages. Also, there is so much that has to be changed in TL this time around (luatex, xetex, the preference pane in OS X...), so you might like to think about postponing the crypto features until next year. Do we really need this? My 2 ct.

Best regards,
J?rgen.

Instead of reiterating points, could you please read my messages?

There are legal international contracts hat limit the export
of cryptographic software.

Are you ready to defend TUG in front of an US court? If not, please
stop bothering us.

I *personally* have already provided a way for users.

Finally, one technical remark: the setup works with both gpg1 and gpg2,
and I can only imagine that your enigmail setup was buggy, because
this is not my experience.

As Norbert wrote, these are the stupid export/import regulations.
Cryptographical software must not be exported from USA. Once gpg becomes a
part of TL and appears on a server in the USA, it will be illegal to export
TL to other countries. Let's assume that we want to overcome this problem
by not allowing to distribute TL from USA. However, there is another
problem, cryptographical software must not be imported to France. Once gpg
becomes a part of TL, it will be illegal to use TL in France. And there may
be more similarly stupid regulations. Thus you should not complain here,
you should complain at the governments of these countries and request
cancellation of these stupid regulations.

If gpg is not found then tlmgr install packages without verification
and apart from an additional message you don't see any difference.

Imho it is a good idea to add verification, and if Norbert is
willing to invest time to implement it I at least try to help (by
reporting bugs).

Howdy,

There was another texlive.infra update that failed when using TeX Live Utility (TLU) this morning. My repository was <http://ftp.math.utah.edu:80/pub/texlive/tlpretest/>.

Downloading and using update-tlmgr-latest.sh (with sudo) didn't clear up the problem (I believe this is what TLU uses for texlive.infra updates). However running `sudo tlmgr update --self` seemed to work and then TLU was able to update the other packages.

This was on two systems running OS X 10.11.4 (El Capitan); one with gpg and the other without gpg.

Good Luck,

Yes, this is what I use, and TLU will be broken until I find time to rewrite its hashing. After a quick attempt yesterday, it's more involved than I thought.

If the script doesn't work when run manually, that's some other problem.

Not as far as I'm concerned, but it will be a few days before I can test a fix on my end. Good thing Mac TeX users aren't compulsive early adopters or anything. ??

Just a minor issue: texmf-dist/doc/texlive/index.html says that the

the numbering in section "Z" it can be seen that this number has more

No no no.. If it is not possible to have gpg like xz, wget etc. with TL 
distribution, you should not add this behavior.. or you should disable 
this by default.

But... just a moment.. For tlmgr we have the autobackup option which the 
user can set to 0.. why not a similar option for gpg:

sudo /opt/texlive/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr option gpg 0

I am sure you can do this with a few click..

On OSX I have verified gpg does not exist but TL DOES complain..

I am quite aware of that. But normally the license of the few lines og
LaTeX code (as in antiqua.sty) is with a free license and the font
itelsf with a less free license. So normally if the font is included in
TL the -.sty is. But this is not always so I see...

No, this can never be a reason.

And even if you can convince Norbert to add an option which allows to
control this behavior, everything which enhances security has to be
turned on by default.  Always.

It seems that you prefer convenience to security.  Not a good idea,
IMO.

Checksums are fine in order to ensure file integrity i.e., to make
sure that transmission errors are detected.  If somebody is able to
fake a file, he's able to fake the checksum as well.  So no security
at all.

Hence I like Norbert's idea and appreciate his effort very much.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I do not scan for this. I have decided to only include OTF fonts that
are available with TexLive. Otherwise a wide range of fonts would be on
the list for me to include and maintain. Thus if the font is in OTF it's
part of TeXLive.

Actually most of the fonts not included in TeXLive is installed with
'getnonfreefonts'  (all but one).

No, I don't prefer convenience but you are changing the policy of TL.

It was to make TL as much as possible self-contained adding programs it 
needs in the distribution. Only rarely you allowed that someone of those 
program were already installed on the OS..

Now, you not only do not add the program (for any noble reason that you 
want) but also allow for it to not be installed or not available from 
the OS. It is the first time I "hear" this kind of argument on this list..

If you want add that, it should be off by default. Then you can say:

  Dear user, have you installed gpg? May you install it? yes? do you 
want to check for security? yes? then enable it with:

tlmgr option gpg 1


What is the logic of installing something that then, perhaps, you can 
not use?

This is my opinion.

Do you like that? DO that, but it is only a security illusion..

Hi all,

> Any further review or testing would be all to the good, of course.

There is an example main-lualatex.tex in
doc/luatex/gregoriotex/examples.

How to test the example:

The present xcolor package is not compatible with the
new luatex beta-0.95.0. Thus please add

\RequirePackage{luatex85}
\RequirePackage[pdftex]{xcolor,graphicx}

before the line

\documentclass[11pt]{article} % use larger type; default would be 10pt

(info from David).

Then
lualatex main-lualatex.tex
should be ok, since gregorio is a restricted-shell-escape command.

Best,
Akira

I have reread your original e-mail again. I do not see any complaint made
by tlmgr, there is not even a warning, it just informs that gpg was not
found and prvcessing continues. It does not pretend to work securely, so I
do not see any illusion. The current behaviour is useful for those who know
what gpg is, are able to install software and thus get more security.
Without this message these people will not know that it is worth to install
gpg. Do you really want to keep people uninformed and let them use less
security although more secure way is readily available?

Hi Angelo,

>tlmgr option gpg 1

Please read the manual of tlmgr, there is already a way to do this:

tlmgr config tlmgr verify-downloads 0

(Afair as I am on my mobile. Written in three man page)

But the default will remain as it is.

Norbert

Thanks for this info. But it does not help to resolve the problem here.
I don't find something wrong in my path.

The problem remains even after calling

set path=C:\Programme\texlive\2016\bin\win32

I also openend a command prompt inside
C:\Programme\texlive\2016\bin\win32 and called xelatex. All the same.

In the latest binaries, the structure of XeTeX is
the same as that of pdfTeX. If the size of xetex.exe is 1536 bytes,
you have the latest XeTeX.
I hope the latest xelatex works for you.

Best,

Hello Akira,

The size of my xetex.exe is 3.785.216 bytes. So I will wait until the
latest win32 binary makes it into pretest.

This is a bug that has not been fixed due to another failure in
the rebuild today ... many things changes, many chances to mess things
up.

Tomorrow hopefully we have a successfull rebuild... at least 
locally here on my computer it worked now (after some fixes).

All the best

Actually most of the fonts not included in TeXLive is installed with
'getnonfreefonts'  (all but one).

Palle, is this really correct? For example, can we install "Literaturnaya"

or the Emerald fonts (ECF) with getnonfreefonts? I tried and and
"getnonfreefonts --list"

does not list them.

Howdy,

Sorry, I can't seem to find an email address to send this to.

With the update to TL2016 pretest this morning it appears that the hyperref package (or hpdftex.def file) is broken. I get the error

 Package hyperref Error: Version mismatch!

(hyperref)                * 2012/11/06 v6.83m: hpdftex.def.

when attempting to typeset a file under pdflatex that has typeset fine before.

Good Luck,

For once texlive is the correct list here as the problem is in the
texlive packaging,
you can make a quick local fix by putting the version string in
hyperref.sty back to 2012/11/06 v6.83m

Trying to install the pretest. I've tried three repositories
but keep getting these errors on two different systems.
Typical message:

TLUtils::check_file: removing /tmp/MuH0Jo1BS7/pst-infixplot.tar.xz, sizes differ:
TLUtils::check_file:   TL=0, arg=3340
TLPDB::_install_package: downloading did not succeed

And when the package downloads finish, the installation
stops because texmf.cnf is missing.

I've not noticed that my internet connection is flaky. If I
re-install texlive-2015 I don't have these issues.

Did you run pretest already a week ago or before? If yes, then you need to update with update-tlmgr-latest.{sh,exe} once, first.

Downloaded tl-install-unx.tar.gz from 

http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/

tar zxvf tl-install-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-20160418
sudo ./install-tl --repository ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/ (or others)

On two Centos7 systems.

Approximately 1 in 20 packages had size errors.  I also tried 

--no-persistent-downloads

but same issues.

That is something that is either related to an outdated mirror or a bad connection.

I cannot imagine any other reason. Before pushing out we automatically do a full install of all packages from the new tlpretest.

Then I'll wait till I can install texlive-2016 from a

Hi,

perhaps not of any actuality, but on updating (for last time) 
some linux computer with TL2105, I got the message (skip to last line)

$ tlmgr update --self
TeX Live 2015 is frozen forever and will no
longer be updated.  This happens in preparation for a new release.

If you're interested in helping to pretest the new release (when
pretests are available), please read http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.
Otherwise, just wait, and the new release will be ready in due time.

The last line made me think ``oh, perhaps after all I already did final update''.

But:
$ tlmgr update --all
TeX Live 2015 is frozen forever and will no
longer be updated.  This happens in preparation for a new release.

Isn't the "tlmgr: no updates available" of the first invocation misleading ?

I was having a lot of problems connecting to the Utah mirror 
via http last night in order to test TLU. The hmc.edu mirror 
was better (though it hadn't synced with latest TL yet).

Now trying to use rsync to download the whole directory (and
then update it incrementally if there are size errors).

Neither the syntax at the tlpretest site nor the syntax in
man rsync work:

rsync -a --delete --exclude="mactex*" ftp.math.utah.edu:texlive/tlpretest tlpretest/

asks for my password.

rsync -a --delete --exclude="mactex*" rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu::texlive/tlpretest tlpretest/

says

ssh: Could not resolve hostname rsync: Name or service not known.

rsync -a --delete --exclude="mactex*" rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu/texlive/tlpretest tlpretest/

says

rsync: failed to connect to ftp.math.utah.edu (155.101.98.136): No route to host (113)

whereas 

ping ftp.math.utah.edu

works fine.

Do I need to specify a non-standard port or a specific user?

Neither https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html nor man rsync suggests
that -- is necessary after the options.  I finally got

rsync -a --delete --exclude="mactex*" rsync://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/  ..

to work (though I'm not in Europe).  The source paths for rsync at

https://www.tug.org/texlive/mirmon/

do *not* end with /.

This is not texlive issue at all, but for information:
luaotfload v2.6 seems to be inconsistent with LuaTeX 0.95.0.
The new version 2.7 from github
  https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload
works well. (See also Issue #328.)

Hi Bob,

    Neither https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html nor man rsync suggests
    that -- is necessary after the options.  

Right, because it is not necessary.

    Neither the syntax at the tlpretest site nor the syntax in
    man rsync work:

Sorry to say it, but I don't believe you accurately copied the syntax in
either case.  I admit it's a confusing and error-prone point, which I
wish could be different.

In short, there are two syntaxes for rsync:

  ftp.math.utah.edu::texlive/tlpretest
or
  rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu/texlive/tlpretest

The first (rsync's own made-up syntax) uses a :: to separate host from path.
The second is the standard url syntax for any protocol, no :: anywhere,
but rather PROTONAME://HOSTNAME/PATH.  Just like, say,
"http://tug.org/texlive".

Since the mirmon page uses the :: syntax (wouldn't be my choice, but I
don't want to hack the mirmon script for this), I changed pretest.html
to use that too, in a vain attempt to reduce confusion.

    rsync -a --delete --exclude="mactex*" rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu/texlive/tlpretest tlpretest/
    says
    rsync: failed to connect to ftp.math.utah.edu (155.101.98.136): No route to host (113)

That syntax is correct and works for me right now.  You can test without
actually transferring files with, e.g., (no destination directory):
rsync rsync://ftp.math.utah.edu/texlive/tlpretest | head 

I believe that what happened in this case was a sad coincidence of an
Internet outage that prevented access to utah.edu (and a lot of other
places) at the time you were trying it.  Lots of my nightly cron jobs
(not related to TL or rsync or Utah) failed.  Ping working does not
prove a working TCP connection ...

    Do I need to specify a non-standard port or a specific user?  

No.  The mirrors support anonymous access on the standard rsync port.

    https://www.tug.org/texlive/mirmon/
    do *not* end with /.   

Ah.  I hadn't noticed that mirmon was "helpfully" removing the trailing
/ from the rsync urls.  In my mirmon source file there are trailing /'s.
I think I've changed the mirmon script to keep the /'s.

Anyway, as jfbu described:
With a trailing / -> save files locally at the "top level", e.g., README.
No trailing / -> save files locally with the last dir component, e.g.,
"tlpretest/README".

So either is workable, it's a matter of what one wants.  I admit it's
another confusing point, and the description on the man page is not
exactly simple to read.

    My rsync is the latest available for Centos7.

Aside: CentOS (actually Red Hat) lies about version numbers in most
packages.  They backport changes from version X+1, X+2, ..., to version
X, without changing the reported version number.  So you never really
know what you have, relative to the original upstream release.  Sigh.

Anyway, the security stuff in rsync is almost always about the server,
rather than the client, so probably nothing to worry about.  (tug.org
runs the latest rsync, which I compile from the original source rather
than relying on any distro.)

Best,
Karl

In texlive.tlpdb of pretest you have in 00texlive.config

depend minrelease/2013

but tlmgr of TeX Live 2013?2015 cannot handle the repository, because it does 
not know keywords containerchecksum, doccontainerchecksum, and 
srccontainerchecksum. Wouldn't it be better so set minrelease to 2016?

After the -self update today I no longer can update when my

Looks like a quoting problem.

Hmmm, bit it was detected correctly (and at that time we run --version!)
but cannot run. Strange.

Can you send me the output of
	tlmgr update --list -v

I will track it down on my own Windows installation ... :-(

This is *really* strange ... I just tried it and it worked without
a hinch.

The only difference is that my gpg is in 
	c:\tex live\2016\tlpkg\installer\gpg\gpg.exe
but there is also a space in the name.

See what I get:

Bob Tennent <rdt at cs.queensu.ca> reports issues with rsync to ftp.math.utah.edu
on Wed, 20 Apr 2016 12:06:58 -0400.

About 6am MDT (GMT/UTC - 6hr) yesterday (Wed 20-Apr-2016), we had a
network hardware failure elsewhere on campus that took parts of lower
campus, including my building, entirely off the campus network, and
the Internet, for about two hours.  The hardware failure was
accompanied by a DNS misconfiguration somewhere on campus that
happened several hours earlier, and compounded the network problem
diagnosis.

Internet service was restored about 8am, but for several hours
afterwards, we saw intermittent network connection failures.

Please retry your rsync attempts.  Things may be better today.

The outage was more serious for me, hanging my desktop for many hours,
and finally forcing a reboot after an uptime of six months on a host
that supports about 20 VMs. Subsequent system updates continue to fail
to complete successfully, and the latest CentOS 7 kernel panics on
reboot, so I have to manually select a previous version.  As a result,
I've been out of e-mail contact for 26 hours, and expect to spend much
of today recovering.

Hi,

AFAICS, `latex2rtf':

isn't part of TeX Live, though its license (LPPL) is compatible.

Is there a reason for that?

Thanks.

Hi Denis,

    https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latex2rtf

A free software license is necessary but not sufficient:
http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html#exec

In short, (1) an executable also needs to be self-locating (find any
support files relative to its own location, preferably using kpathsea),
and I'm fairly sure that latex2rtf isn't; (2) it needs to use automake.

   Though I've located the file "luajittex.fmt" at
   $TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/luajittex/luajittex.fmt.

If $TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/luajittex/luajittex.log exists, what's in it?
Any indication of the error?

If not, try running the given command from the command line and see what
happens.

Both the initial installation and subsequent fmtutil-sys --all do work
with me, including luajittex, so it is at least possible ... --karl

This is now fixed in `ucharclasses.sty'.  However, there's still a
limitation in `latex.ltx'.  The code

  \ifx\XeTeXcharclass\@undefined
  \else
  \def\newXeTeXintercharclass{%
   \e at alloc\XeTeXcharclass\chardef\xe at alloc@intercharclass\m at ne\@cclv}
  \fi
  \ifx\XeTeXcharclass\@undefined
  \else
    \countdef\xe at alloc@intercharclass=257
    \xe at alloc@intercharclass=\z@
  \fi

is not correct for XeTeX 0.99994 and newer since up to 4096
\XeTeXcharclass registers are now supported.  Is there a chance that
`latex.ltx' gets updated accordingly before TeXLive 2016 is out?

Yes, this file exists, though no indication of error here; I've attached
the file to this message as "luajittex-sys.log".

This fails, apparently while digesting "\unless" in pdftexconfig.tex;
please see the attached "luajittex.log".

Hi,

some days ago Herbert Schulz on this list in a "pdftex paper size"
entitled thread also reported a problem where he mentioned similar
location

> /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex

as in second log above, 

I am now curious about how it comes that both of you have that location,
that it seems to conatin
a version of pdftexconfig.tex which was a fleeting one, whereas on
my install I don't have anything in texmf-config ?

perhaps it depends on how installation worked initially ?

on my install tlmgr paper pdftexconfig.tex is at 

/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex

and there is only one

Indeed, good hint!!!


The solution is the following: After calling
	tlmgr paper .....
or similar, a copy is generated in texmf-config, because otherwise
the changes might get overwritten.

This file (at least)
	texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
needs to be removed!

I attached a possible pgfsys-luatex.def there, and attach it also here.
Changes:
* pdfpage(heigth|width) -> page(height|width)
* add three lines:
\protected\def\pdfobj {\pdfextension obj }
\def\pdflastobj {\numexpr\pdffeedback lastobj\relax}
\edef\pdfpageresources {\pdfvariable pageresources}

That worked for me

Thanks for your attention.

Unfortunately, this doesn't solve my problem: I get the same "Fatal
format file error" when I call luatex after trying each of the following
(with appropriate privileges).

1. removing $TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
2. running `tlmgr paper letter` then removing
   $TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
3. running `tlmgr paper letter` then moving
   $TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex to
   $TEXMFDIST/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex

I notice that the original file in
$TEXMFDIST/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex doesn't change when
I run `tlmgr paper letter` (with appropriate privileges): here, the paper
size remains A4; I dunno whether this is what's supposed to happen.

My next step will be to reinstall TL'16.

Every time I try to update my 2016 TeXLive pre-pretest installation to the recently released pretest (on Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.4) via the command line tlmgr, namely

sudo tlmgr update --repository ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/ <ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/> --all

I get the following error message:

Unknown directive ...containerchecksum c59200574a316416a23695c258edf3a32531fbda43ccdc09360ee105c3f07f9fb77df17c4ba4c2ea4f3a5ea6667e064b51e3d8c2fe6c984ba3e71b4e32716955... , please fix it! at /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 210, <$retfh> line 5579.

This happens with all the repositories in TeXLive?s web. Could this be fixed, or I just need to erase my installation and install the pretest from scratch?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Try downloading and running update-tlmgr-latest.sh from
ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest.  Normal updates with
tlmgr might be possible after that.  If it doesn't work, yeah, simplest
to reinstall.  -k

Reinstalling seems to have solved the problem: luatex now runs without any

Subject: [tex-live] [pretest] pdfcrop crashes when called from certain
 directory
Message-ID: <84r3dwwgdi.fsf@siart.de>

This is a really weird problem that I observe after today's update.
pdfcrop (or actually gswin32c) crashes when called from one special
directory:

d:\user\coupling-structure-letter\figures>pdfcrop s-params.pdf
PDFCROP 1.38, 2012/11/02 - Copyright (c) 2002-2012 by Heiko Oberdiek.
!!! Error: Ghostscript exited with error code 5!
C:\Programme\texlive\2016\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:677: command failed with exit code 13:
perl.exe c:\Programme\texlive\2016\texmf-dist\scripts\pdfcrop\pdfcrop.pl s-params.pdf

The crazy thing is that it works in any other directory that I have
tried instead. I have no clue what is special about that one directory
so that it provokes such a crash.

Actually I can't tell

- if it is really related to today's update (because I can't reproduce
  it in other directories, so the problem could in principle be older)

- if it is related to pdfcrop.pl or to PSTricks (this file s-params.pdf
  contains a PSTricks graphics, PSTricks was updated today, other PDFs
  work fine in this directory, s-params.pdf works fine in other
  directories)

Really weird. Perhaps someone got some idea. If not, please don't waste
too much time this, because it's really shady and I would not know how
to isolate the culprit. Platform is XP.

The cases I've seen with pdfcrop gives error is when the pdf file
has page larger than the maximim page size (\maxdimen).
Try to run pdfinfo on the pdf(s) in that folder and see the
pagesize field.

Meanwhile I think I could exclude PSTricks from the list of possible
causers. I get the crash even with the simplest document like

% --- s-params.tex ---------
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hallo Welt.
\end{document}
% --------------------------

after the sequence

latex s-params
dvips s-params
ps2pdf s-params.ps
pdfcrop s-params.pdf

I get the reported crash of gswin32c during the pdfcrop run. But, as I
wrote, only from within one particular directory. In any other directory
it works fine (which is something I really don't catch).

Ahhh, first email: d:\user\coupling-structure-letter\figures>pdfcrop s-params.pdf

If the same file works in other directories than that sounds like HD problems (bad secs or similar) can you run a filesystem test?

Sorry. It was somehow hidden in the call that I showed in my first
message. It is

,----

`----

For instance I tried the same in 

,----
| d:\user\coupling-structure-letter

where everything is fine.

Could the problem be the length of the full path name?

Perhaps that's also out of question. I tried in

No. There are 8 files and 2 subdirectories. So it's also not overly
crowded.

I found that the error also depends on the filename of the .tex file.
With some filenames it works. But I can't tell in which way. At least it
has nothing to do with the hyphen ...

Filesystem check did not show any problems.

I'm tearing my hair ... Thanks to all those who have given hints so far.
I will continue my search in the direction filesystem or so. But for the
time being I don't assume it's TL related. Rather think I have to
exorcise the devil from my computer ;-)

It is the whole name

,----
| d:\user\coupling-structure-letter\figures\s-params.tex
`----

that pdfcrop (or ghostscript) does not like, for whatever reason. If I
move everything to a different volume/partition, say

,----
| f:\user\coupling-structure-letter\figures\s-params.tex
`----

I get the same crash. When I do a rename like

,----
| f:\user\coupling-structure-let\figures\s-params.tex
`----

the crash is gone.

Filename length perhaps (buffer over-run)?

If you're using the bundled Windows gs with TeX Live, it was recently
updated to the latest release, 9.19, which could well be the culprit
(somehow ...).

Also, I think pdfcrop --debug will show the exact gs invocation (if it
doesn't, it should), which might make it reproducible with a single
shell command.  -k

Norbert considered a file system problem (bad sectors).  Did you
remove the files from

  d:\user\coupling-structure-letter\figures

before?  In this case the (potentially) bad sectors will be used
again.

However, I wouldn't exclude a problem related to file permissions.  Is
there anything different related to this directory?

  Reinhard

I have two systems, both OS X: 10.6.8 (Mac Pro) and 10.11.4 (Mac Book Pro), and both have been updated to the TL-2016 pretest.

I updated (TLU 1.24b3) both systems.  On 10.11.4, the update succeeded; it was last updated before this problem showed up, and today the update worked w/o issue.

On 10.6.8, the listing failed with the "TLCrypto.pm" error on Friday AM and again today:

2016-04-23 14:58:03 -0700 Notice -[TLMOperation main][28535]	Undefined subroutine &TeXLive::TLCrypto::platform called at /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLCrypto.pm line 210.

I checked the email threads on this, but my take is that this should now work.  Did I overlook something?

Thanks!

Try "Reinstall TeX Live Manager" from the Actions menu.
Dick Koch had a similar problem, I think, and it was
resolved by getting the latest infrastructure updates.

Yes, that?s correct.

I?m sure it is equivalent, but I used Terminal and
wrote

	sudo tlmgr update ?self ?no-verify-downloads

This gave critical updates and then TLU worked for
regular updating and everything else.

Yeah; that worked for me as well.  I inadvertently replied only to Adam, but I'm now updating w/o problems.

If there is a chance to improve the output of pdfcrop --debug, it
would be quite helpful to provide error messages from ghostscript as
well instead of just mentioning its exit status.  Don't know whether
pdfcrop --debug does it already, but it should.

Error messages from ghostscript look quite weird at a first glance but
are extremely helpful though.

In order to solve Uwe's problem we have to know *how* ghostscript
crashed.  ATM we only know *that* it crashed.  Without ghostscript's
error messages we can only guess.

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is what pdfcrop --debug spits out:

At least I can say that it might be related to gs 9.19. I have the same
problem with TL15 final, but it does not appear with TL14 final.

The only special thing about that directory is that it is under VC by
subversion (TortoiseSVN). But I could reproduce the crash on a different
HD volume with the same path (except the drive letter). Therefore I
would exclude file permissions, TortoiseSVN, and bad sectors as
potential culprits. The problem also disappears in subdirectories. So it
isn't the path length either.

... and maybe with -f /path/to/s-params.pdf

However, shouldn't the argument of -f be quoted in order to allow
spaces in file or directory names?

anything from them stating an explicit license on their own code.

2) It needs to be uploaded to CTAN.  It is better for everyone when

Sometime ago there was an issue with els elsarticle.cls  ; it turned out
that on CTAN version was 1.20

and on their site 1.20b (both of the same date but different) and only the
second was correct. Some people contacted Elsevier support and they
promised to address this disparity but still did not. Also some support
templates available only on their site

https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/latex-instructions#elsarticle

It is not sufficient to persuade the publisher to make one time upload, it
is necessary to persuade it to maintain their submission on CTAN.

pdfcrop checks the file name for unsafe characters, that
would require quoting, and uses a temporary file with a name
without spaces in this case.

Just guessing, what happens if you put the file with the same name to a
directory with a different name but the same number of characters, e.g.
d:\user\figures\coupling-structure-letter ?

What happens if you remove everything beside the s-params.tex/pdf?

(I tried to reproduced your setup on my maching and see nothing
problematic

D:\user\coupling-structure-letter\figures>pdfcrop  s-params.pdf

compiles without problems in texlive 2016.

Hi Uwe, I seem to have lost the information, which Windows version are you on?

I tried testing earlier today on my Win7 VM

c:/Users/daleif/coupling-structure-letter/figures/

without problems

Hi, a student just came by with a Win10 (he'll get back to me with the OS details)

He wanted to install TL15 on it, and the installer crashed because he did not have access to create c:\texlive
(seemed to work fine when we used run as administrator)

I've just never seen this issue on newer windows computers where the user is the only user on the system.

just FYI

We took a screen shot of the error, but the student haven't send it to me yet, I'll send it on when I get it

As Heiko wrote, pdfcrop tests for unsafe characters in the file name and if
such characters are present, a temporary file is used. Thus I got an idea
that there may be a problem with some exact number of characters in the
file name during this test, one character less or one character more is OK.
But it is just my guess.

Hi all,

is there a commandline switch which can instruct Xe(La)TeX to print the
full path of the OTF font used to the log file? I encountered problems with
TL 2016 and GNU FreeSerif but before I report a bug I would like to be sure
that it is not my problem. Most probably I have several instances of the
font in my computer and I want to know which one was found. I know that the
full path is written in the xdv file but I would prefer cleaner way of
diagnosis.

Hi Zdenek,

I would run xelatex with the xdv output option and then run xdvipdfmx manually, afair one can see the font used.

Other idea is to use the -recorder option.

I don't think there's a command-line switch, but have you tried setting 
\XeTeXtracingfonts=1 in your document?

Thank you, this works. And it showed that the fonts are loaded from strange
directories, I will have to fix my setup.

Crashed? The installer should check first whether it is possible to
create c:\texlive, and if not, let the user choose something else.

Another possibility is that Windows needs time to become aware of

happen.  Can the user create c:\texlive manually?

I'm still waiting for the error message (I do not know his name, so I cannot send him an email).

The error clearly stated that TL could not create c:\texlive

it did not present an alternative interface (we were using the simple installer, the user had first tried the .exe, I prefer to download the zip and run it from there)

Hi,

there is an important difference between Windows Home and Windows Pro.
Windows Home do not allow to set different permissions for different users.
Thus any user can write to C:\.  Windows Pro allow to set permissions and
in the default setup only system and administrators can write to C:\. Most
computers have incorrect setup so that an administrative account is used
for everyday work (the user is in the "administrators" group). If the
user's account is set properly, he/she is not allowed to create C:\texlive.

On my Pro system, where I am logged in as a non-admin user, I am
able to create subdirectories but not files in C:\. Only when trying
to create a file do I get a UAC prompt.

Now I found that the crash of pdfcrop happens only during the complete
conversion chain, i.e. when pdfcrop is preceded by

latex s-params
dvips s.params
ps2pdf s-params.ps

then

pdfcrop s-params.pdf

crashes. When I close the command window, re-open a new one and call

pdfcrop s-params.pdf

again, it runs smoothly.

Confirmed. Probably some package(s) may not match the

I have no idea how Windows works, but could it be that
ps2df is not  finished when pdfcrop starts?

Can this be controlled in a batch file?

Do you mean that you could create c:\texlive without UAC prompt?
This would reinforce my suspicion of a timing problem.

Some new observation:

In addition to gs in TeXLive I have a separate installation of
Ghostscript. Now I removed this one from my path and the crash is gone.

Obviously it makes a difference which ps2pdf is called, although both gs
are version 9.19.

But still I wonder why it works everywhere but in this directory. I've
been working with this constellation (own Ghostscript takes precedence
over TL) for years.

No. As I wrote earlier, a normal user should be able to create
c:\texlive without a UAC prompt. As I wrote before, sometimes
Windows appears to need time to realize what it has done.

But before adding a delay, I would like some confirmation that that
was the problem, and not something else.

Message-ID: <E00B5EAA-A78B-4A16-82AE-45D27930C262@web.de>

Hello,

the engine detection is not working with LuaLaTeX and, e.g., the geometry package as well as the microtype package. An MWE would be:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[verbose]{geometry}

\begin{document}
Test
\end{document}

At TL2016 it shows in the log: *geometry* detected driver: dvips
At TL2015 it is pdflatex.

This breaks microtype as well as geometry. For geometry it was mentioned before, but no reason was given (cp.: lualatex does not obey geometry). 

The detection schemes seem to be quite different in the geometry package (ifpdf.sty, ifluatex.sty) and microtype (check if \directlua is defined). At least they do to me.

Hans uploaded a fix to the issue tracked here:

    https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload/issues/340

See the mirror for details:

    https://bitbucket.org/phg/context-mirror/commits/4668b7323a6bc1b01e72418fb646b697d68bbcb7#chg-tex/context/base/mkiv/font-otj.lua

The fix will be part of the upcoming bugfix release of
Luaotfload.

If you are using an external Ghostscript, ps2pdf is certainly an
MS-DOS batch file, but for the Ghostscript installation shipped with
TeX Live I replaced all these batch files by Lua scripts.  

To be more precise, I did't look at the MS-DOS batch files at all,
I actually ported the Unix shell scripts to Lua.

Maybe the MS-DOS batch file provided by the external Ghostscript is
the culprit.  All these batch files are quite old and probably not
maintained for decades.

For TeX Live I ported them to Lua because I don't have Windows but the
Lua scripts are completely platform-independent. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Dear Andy,

In lualatex, \ifpdf is true, so I think that
in the present geometry package, which is
relatively old, the driver may be detected
as pdftex. But I don't know details.

Akira

Ok. I will keep this possibility in mind and continue to observe the
situation.

Many thanks to all who racked their brains about this weird problem. For
the time being I think it's not worth to put more effort (and more list
traffic) into this. The reproducibility of this phenomenon is so bad (I
can't even reproduce it myself in other directories or on other
computers) and it is so singular that further investigation would mean a
lot of effort for a little gain.

Hi all,

the syntax of ghostscript invocation does not change so the MS-DOS batch
files most probably work. However, the MS-DOS subsystem has a lot of
limitations, does not understand long file names, does not understand
special characters in the file names (you have to guess what is the alias
name known by the subsystem), command line length is limitted. As a result,
in many situations these batch files are nowadays unusable.

Andy's problem is that geometry uses the *dvips* driver which is
clearly wrong.  (I don't know if the pdftex driver works correctly
without the luatex85 package).

Hi Siep, I've got the screen dump from the user (attached, I've removed his name)

He is on 

Win 10 home version 1511.

I've asked him to test making a folder in c:\ and describe what happens.

Maybe it should catch the error better and give the user an error message, I think a lot of normal users get scared by a back trace like that.

No. As I wrote earlier, a normal user should be able to create
c:\texlive without a UAC prompt. As I wrote before, sometimes
Windows appears to need time to realize what it has done.

But before adding a delay, I would like some confirmation that that
was the problem, and not something else.

ifpdf.sty will give false for \ifpdf (and then select dvips) unless
you have the latest ifpdf.sty
that was added to the tl2016 pretest the other day. however the pdftex
back end won't work
without \RequirePackage{luatex85} at the start of the file (and if you
add that the old ifpdf.sty will also work)

Well, a backtrace is useful to us.

I did some testing on a W10 Pro VM, where I am not an admin, with
the wizard installer. I had
no trouble installing in c:\texlive. But when I selected "C:\Program
Files (x64)" then the installer complained, as it should, that it
could not install there. So in both cases the installer behaved as
intended.

The fact that your user could install ok as admin makes a timing
problem is less likely.

Has this laptop been acquired via the university? Then there might
be some nonstandard permissions.

The output of the command

icacls c:\

may tell us more about the permissions.

It is his private laptop

I'll ask him to run the icals command

I've never encountered this either on windows. (We were joking that perhaps Windows started inforcing things on file system level like Apple have started in El Capitan)

Hi Norbert,

in the meantime I did another experiment because the situation seems to be
more complex. The pretest was originally installed on an old computer with
Fedora 17, its HW is close to its death. I have imported the keys to gpg
and cryptographic signatures worked. I have installed Fedora 23 to a new
computer and when copying files from the old computer to the new one I
rsync'd the whole /usr/local/texlive. I have not imported the keys. Today I
ran tlmgr update as shown in the previous mail. The old computer with
Fedora 17 still lives so I tried to run tlmgr update on it and this is the
output:

$ tlmgr update -self -all
cryptographic signature of
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512
verified
cryptographic signature of
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.sha512
verified
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups
[1/1, ??:??/??:??] update: texlive.infra [345k] (40527 -> 40770) ... done
Restarting tlmgr to complete update ...
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest
(verified)

tlmgr update --list -v was run on both computers after the update, the
output is attached.

I have Fedora 23 on my home computer too, tlpretest was installed there,
not rsync'd. I will try in the evening.

Hi Zdenek,

thanks, the log files tell me all I need. The problem is that the
cached tlpdb is not redownloaded, but that is not counted against
verified. Logical error. Will fix soon.

One more thing:

> I have imported the keys to gpg and cryptographic signatures worked.

What do you mean? You don't have to import anything, all is automatic.
We use a different pubkey than your normal (by using the --homedir
argument to gpg). So you can remove the TeX Live key from *your*
personal keyring if you want.

All the best

Yes, I know, you wrote it some time ago but at that time the keys were
already imported. I know from CentOS and Fedora that the rpm packages are
verified and I must have the keys (or agree to import them), so I
originally thought that i will need the TL key in my keyring.

Really??? This is very stupid of CentOS/Fedora ...

Debian ships its own key tool which contains the standard keys, but one
can add additional with apt-key.

Anyway, that's not my business. If I do something similar in TL (allow
for different keys) it will be Debian like with tlmgr key ...

All the best

To be precise, the standard keys are parts of the installation image but it
is then possible to install packages from other sources as EPEL etc. They
may use other keys and these keys are again installed as rpm packages.

Dear Texlive:

I write to you because an error message invited me to.

I tried this on my MacBook Pro (2012) running El Capitan.

prompt$  tlmgr update -list

and got this
-----

/Library/TeX/texbin/tlmgr: verification of checksum for
ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/ failed: cryptographic

against

failed. Output was

Permission denied

gpg: Fatal: can't create lock for
`/usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/gpg/trustdb.gpg'


Please report to texlive at tug.org

------
Then I tried

primpt$ sudo tlmgr update -list

and got this:

------

Password:

tlmgr: package repository ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/
(verified)

tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups

tlmgr: no updates available

( ls -ld /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/gpg/  shows

drwxr-xr-x  6 root  staff  204 Apr 27 18:40
/usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/gpg/

so it is not surprising that sudo was needed.)

Is it right to require 'sudo' for such an operation?  All the above
commands are run from

an administrative account, but my day to day work is not.  As a day to day
non administrative

user I cannot use tlmgr this way?  But tlutil seems to work fine for the
non administrative

me, so I am really confused.


Thanks in advance, & with all best wishes

Do you have write permissions? If not, then well, yes, that does not
work. But update will not work anyway without write permissions.

Well, updates are requiring root access.

Because it asks you about authentication I guess, but I don't know
the internals.

ANyway, I will investigate and see whether I can do something, but I am
not sure.

THis is *strange* because on Linux (here on my system) it works
without a problem, but warns that it cannot write trustdb. I did add
some print statements and get the folloiwng (with a user that does not
have write access to the installation):

$ tlmgr update --list
DEBUG::: returning 0 gpg: Signature made Thu 28 Apr 2016 10:17:43 AM JST using RSA key ID 19438C70
gpg: NOTE: trustdb not writable
gpg: Good signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>"
!
tlmgr: package repository /var/www/norbert/tlpretest (verified)


So I am a bit surprised ....

Can you try with exporting the folliwng environment variables before
running tlmgr update --list:

	TL_GNUPGARGS="--no-secmem-warning --no-permission-warning --lock-never"
	export TL_GNUPGARGS
followed by
	tlmgr update --list

Does that fix the problem for you?

Hi all,

With TL2016 pretest, the following test file requires a
"pgfsys-luatex.def" driver while compiled with lualatex. It required
"pgfsys-pdftex.def" with final TL2015.

I cannot install texlive-full due to a very slow internet connection and
I have not found out which package installs "pgfsys-luatex.def".
Can anybody help?

\RequirePackage{luatex85} allows us to use pdfTeX-like primitives, but
still \Gin at driver detected by graphics.cfg is "luatex.def". This makes
pgf to call non-existent pgfsys-luatex.def, so currently you can force
pgf to call pgfsys-pdftex.def.

\RequirePackage{luatex85}
\def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-pdftex.def}

BTW, not a tex-live issue at all. Already reported (and also with a
workaround) in:
https://sourceforge.net/p/pgf/bugs/384/

Thanks Hironobu for this clarification. My bad guess was to look for a
TeXLive package holding file "pgfsys-luatex.def".

Yes, this makes tlmgr seem to work as it did under TL2015: that is, without
needing to
exercise root privileges just to see if something needs updating.  I
understand why
root powers are needed to actually install stuff, but resent  needing them
to simply
check if updates are available.  Presumably tlmgr has long since had a
mechanism
for preventing concurrent runs clobbering the TL tree; if so, I don't see
why gpg needs
to do file locking, too.

Happy & grateful, with all best wishes,
Jim Reeds

Folks,

MacTeX installs TeX in /usr/local/texlive/2016, a location owned by root.
Therefore to administer TeX Live, you need sudo. I am told that many
Linux distributions install in user space, and thus don?t need sudo.

This also applies to TeX Live Utility, Adam Maxwell?s GUI
interface to tlmgr. This program will list packages without an admin
password, but whenever you ask it to perform a task which will modify
the TeX Distribution, it asks for an admin password.

Norbert says he?ll look into this, but I see no reason to do so.
Of course you are free to install TeX Live yourself, and then
you can install in user space.

If you mean TeX Live Utility, no, it does not prompt for authorization
just to list packages. I also have no problems listing updates in Terminal
on OS X 10.11 w/o authorization:

$ tlmgr update --list --repository http://ftp.math.utah.edu:80/pub/texlive/tlpretest/
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.math.utah.edu:80/pub/texlive/tlpretest/ (verified)
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups
autorm:   babel-ukraineb           : local:    30298, source: <absent>
?
[snip package list]

Perhaps Jim has some environment variable set in Terminal that
is causing issues with GPG?

Hi all,

as already written several times, it is not recommended to install TL as
root in Linux. Thus many years ago I manually created (as root)
/usr/local/texlive and changed ownership of this directory to me. Can
MacTeX bi installed by an ordinary user if this additional step is done
manually using sudo?

Maybe. But we never had any problems with root-owned distribution and
it's been that way for years (or at least I'm not aware of any
problems).

Hi

I too (but on Mac OS X) many years ago changed ownership of /usr/local/texlive
to me

Spares quite a few hassles in various situations.

TeX Live Utility detects it and does not use sudo then.

In that case I create a specifik user, that owns the installation, others only have read permissions.

Made the switch after I multiple times ended up with only repad permossions for myself after a manual update (this was before tlmgr). I only noticed this when users complained

Yes, that is expected.
In the restricted mode, all arguments are quoted,
so kpsewhich foo >>bar does not work.
Only very simple commands are allowed in the

Zdenek,

As far as I know, installing with MacTeX and then changing
permissions on /usr/local/texlive works fine.  You can test this
directly by temporarily renaming the texlive folder.Then install
BasicTeX and change permissions on the newly created
texlive directory. Check that standard operations work I
conjecture that they do..

MacTeX installs an auxiliary structure in /Library/TeX/Distributions.
In case of trouble, the permissions on Distributions could, I
suppose, be changed.

I?d like to ask a favor. Users like you who understand Unix
should do whatever they like.. Iff you have colleagues
who know nothing about Unix, and you set up TeX for them,
please don?t make a similar change UNLESS you give them
your card and say ?if you have trouble, call me.?

Herb Schulz and others support MacTeX users,
who rarely report permission changes and often aren?t aware
of them. Several times, he has spent days back and forth before
discovering that the user?s computer has been completely
reconfigured by technical support.

Dick

I don't think anyone has answered specifically: NO. 
Apple's installer will reset the ownership of the tree to root,
which is the default for /usr/local. You can use chown -R to
change it _after_ install, and I do this on one of my systems
to ensure that TeX Live Utility keeps working with unprivileged
users.

The worst problems I've seen are from users who set an overly
restrictive umask because they took advice from some random
dude on the internet. Explaining how this is a problem just
leads to "MUH PERMISSIONS" and "MUH SECURITY."

By and large, Mac users are morons about UNIX, and should not
take (or be given) advice from UNIX users, especially with
respect to permissions and environment variables. In my opinion,
of course, as a long-time Mac user.

At various points in this discussion, it has been mentioned that on 
linux it is recommend to install TeXLive as a normal user.  What are the 
reasons for this?  In the installation instructions 
https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html the recommendation is 
merely stated, but no justification is given.  Why should this be 
different between linux and OS-X?

A quick Google search did not show an obvious place to find this

There may be no difference for quite a lot of users but remember that you
may need to add additional (probably nonfree) files to texmf-local. If
texmf-local is owned by you, you can do it but you cannot run mktexlsr
bechase during installation the ls-R files were created by root and are
thus owned by root. As a developer of packages I have a few more TEXMF
trees added. Years ago when my TL was installed and updated by root it
happened to me several files, that ownership of ls-R files was changed to
root, I did not noticed that mkteclsr reported a permission error and it
took me some time to figure out why the new files are not found.

I really hate the concept of sudo, it may be quite dangerous. Assume you
leave a computer for a moment and forget to lock it. At that time anybody
may come and use sudo to do a harmful action. Such a person can do it
without knowing the root password. And if a malicious code can be invoked
via internet (abusing vulnerability in some software), sudo gives root
permissions to an attacker who does not need to know the root password, so
the malicious code running as a normal user can get root permissions it
that user is allowed to use sudo.

As others, I used to intall TL as root for many years without any
trouble, except maybe when I tried to run tlmgr's GUI (but I prefer CLI
anyway).

Message-ID: <ADCC80F3-2DB7-4F40-9333-7710F7A4EB33@free.fr>

Hi,

the TeX Live guide already mentions regarding LuaTeX ``Sweeping
changes to primitives, both renames and removals,...''

Also luaotfload is undergoing important changes (in my limited
experience, it is much much faster) including removal of
previously supported features.

https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload/blob/master/NEWS

* Remove support for builtin Fontforge libraries (this includes
  the PFA, PFB, DFONT, and feature file readers).

As mentioned by Bruno Voisin on TeX on Mac OS X list
(https://email.esm.psu.edu/pipermail/macosx-tex/2016-April/date.html
but not yet updated), this is particularly relevant to mac os x
users as legacy system font Times, Helvetica, Courier, Monaco,
Geneva, Helvetica Neue are in DFONT format.

Naturally, this is in state of flux, as the luaotfload repo is
actively maintained. Perhaps the removed features will be
re-implemented in Lua.

But in case some previously working things are really removed,
probably TeXLive guide could contain brief mention of it to the
unwary.

Hi,

the explanations in 3.4.4 System font configuration for XeTEX and LuaTEX for  ``Unix-compatible system'' do not apply to Mac OS X (xetex does not use fontconfig there). This arguably should be clarified, because Mac OS X is a ``Unix-compatible system''.

Giving up. at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 2741.

It seems then that the installation didn?t complete successfully. What could I do to fix this error (short of starting from scratch!)?

Thanks everybody,

Artemio

Just to add to my previous post, I found the following messages towards the end of the installation:

Indeed, that is not good and installation was not successful.

In fact, it should have stopped installation earlier - my fault. Fixed
now in the code and will be in tomorrow's installer.

That would allow restarting the installation again.

Subject: [tex-live] pgfsys-luatex.def file
Message-ID: <20160430134438.GC6760@wienerschnitzel>

Dear all,

I have taken a second look at pgfsys-luatex.def and have replaced
(using perl) all the occurrences of old macros/primitives that have
been replaced in newer luatex.

I have tested the file with several of my documents containing pgf/tikz
drawing, all without any problem.

I attach the file, and if some other people could test it it would be
great.

Send also to the pgf bug report.

All the best

Norbert

1. Create a file: "a  a.tex" with sample data.

2. Run: $pdflatex a\ \ a.tex

3. Get an error:

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (MiKTeX 2.9)

for some reason pdflatex has converted 2 spaces into 1 in the file name.

Interesting, the comment in three commit mentions that this cannot be reached in user mode.

I need to check again, thanks for the report

Dear Ivanov,

That is not a bug, but a feature.
Only one space between non-space characters is
supported in a file name in TeX.

One should not have spaces or tabs in file names to start with.
This is bad habit that windows brought to the world.

If needed, one can use underscore in long file names to make
them more clear to read, or even a dash -. But a space
in a file name causes too many problems as is well documented
in many places.
