    Thanks for the quick fix!  BTW, who is managing the bug tracker?

Arthur Reutenauer and Jonathan Kew are the only ones with write access
to the xetex bug tracker.  I already emailed them about this and other
issues.  -k

  I'm happy to close the bug, but it would be best if Werner were able
to run the new code and confirm that it is fixed.  I don't think he has
done so.

Subject: [tex-live] svn repository format upgrade
Message-ID: <201602020013.u120DmF6027780@freefriends.org>

I have upgraded the texlive subversion repository on tug.org to
format 7, which comes with svn release 1.9.3.  Purportedly it has
both space and time improvements:
  http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.9.html#fsfs-improvements
The last revision committed in the old repository format was 39544.

It is supposed to be interoperable with older clients, so my hope is
that this change will be invisible to everyone, except that perhaps
things will be a little faster.  My own checkouts, made with a couple
of svn client versions, seem to be working fine.

The disk space occupied on the server decreased about 16%, BTW.

Fingers crossed,
Karl

Message-ID: <CAJCZBmRMpYAOX+L6EtQh2o=o76trkkkTy7Tgbwm6hJmzom8hgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Today I updated TeX Live 2015 using tlmgr.
Soon after that, I found that LuaLaTeX no longer
works.

MWE is:
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\[
F(x)=a+b+c
\]
\end{document}
and compiling with lualatex (beta-0.80.0) with format
LaTeX2e <2016/02/01>, all the math symbols (such as
`=' and `+') are broken.

After I recovered LaTeX2e <2015/10/01> patch level 2
and regenerated lualatex.fmt, everything seems to be ok.
The release of LaTeX2e <2016/02/01> for supporting
LuaTeX beta-0.87.0 can be too fast...

Thanks for the report. I'll take a look at this: I have some idea where
it might be. (I suspect it's nothing to do with supporting v0.87, but of
course can't be sure until I've fully check.)

(BTW, not a TeX Live issue: I'll forward to the rest of the team.)

Issue identified: it's not in latex.ltx but rather in a support file.
There's a conceptual question to consider but that needs some time: for
the present I will alter the relevant support file to maintain the older
behaviour.

Hello Joseph,

Thank you for early response.
(And sorry for reporting in the wrong list)
I confirmed LuaLaTeX on LuaTeX beta-0.89.0 also has the same problem.
I'll wait for the arrival of new support files in the nearest mirror. Thanks.

Message-ID: <CALBOmsZ0TYm2EwD0VTe578g-OdagnP_UkXRx=GC4=-7M_WZkAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

For the last few years we have been going through hectic testing &
patching of Asymptote in the last moment before the freeze of TL
sources.

I would love to see Asymptote support Python 3 and I submitted a long
patch, but there are still some problems. See:
    https://github.com/vectorgraphics/asymptote/tree/python3

(xasy from MacTeX 2015 fails to work for me unless I explicitly start
it with python2 because I had to switch to python3 as my default
Python interpreter.)

I would be grateful if any of you would be willing to test and
contribute patches now, so that we could end up with a functional
support for Python 3 in time for TL 2016.

Thank you,
    Mojca

If someone sends me a new x64_86 GNU/Linux binary (or a link to it),
I'll happily do that ? I don't have the time to compile TeXLive by
myself.

I converted encoding of mendex.1 from EUC-JP to UTF-8.
I hope it will satisfy the requirement.

Thanks!  My only remaining concern is the PDF versionof the manpage ?
does the japanized groff version support UTF-8?  The current upstream
groff's PDF output for Japanese is, well, sub-optimal :-)

Howdy,

Someone mentioned this problem for LuaLaTeX but I'm seeing the same thing with XeLaTeX. Compiling the following MWE with XeLaTeX shows the problem:

\documentclass{article}
%\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
\(A=B=C\)

If you un-comment the fontspec line all seems to be well. This is with TeX Live 2015 and all updates.

Yes sorry there was an error in the unicode data loader (or rather it
over ambitiously set unicode based mathcodes which are not correct if
you are using classic tex math fonts) I believe we have already pushed
an update to ctan. If you need a fix urgently the updated files are at

https://github.com/latex3/unicode-data

sorry about that.

Subject: [tex-live] LaTeX 2016/02/01 or fontspec issue?
Message-ID: <56B3BC1C.7060009@free.fr>

Hi all,

The following test file fails with new LaTeX 2016/02/01 and fontspec
2.5a: the latin letters are properly typeset in Latin Modern but the
symbols (punctuation signs, etc.) are typeset in FandolSong-Regular.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{xeCJK}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\begin{document}
\showoutput

?? \LaTeX ???\par
abcd :;!?-`?()\{\}[]

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I report here because I am not sure it is a LaTeX/fontspec/xeCJK issue.
I suspect LaTeX or fontspec as this test file compiled properly with
LaTeX 2015/10/01 and fontspec 2.4.

Best wishes,

Hi I think this is the change in character class handling in the

Dear all,

How can I use tlmgr to basically tell me what the latest revision of
the packages I have installed is. I am not talking only about tlmgr
(which I can get with tlmgr --version), but of any LaTeX package. For
example, if I log this information, and if upgrading causes an error
for me, I can say "well, it worked with revision ABC".

Kind regards,

Xu

I believe that "tlmgr info blart" will give you what you want for package "blart"

Thank you, Justin for your reply. I am actually interested in the
revsion number of the most recently updated package. From what I
understand, tlmgr might update package blart from 200 to 204 and
foobar from 190 to 205. Suppose that it is only those two packages. I
want to have the number 205 but without specifying 'foobar'.

Kind regards,

Xu

Before updating you can use
   tlgmr update --list
and extract this information, maybe with --machinereadable added, but after updating tlmgr itself had no idea about what has been updated.

But you can check TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr.log and extract the information from there.

This is quite recent, since I use the TexLive Manager on a regular basis and the bug happened after updating last week. The bug disappears when changing the package order (therefore it may prove harmless for the user), and is not specific to the langage given as an option for babel (the very same bug happens for [german] for example).

change the order:

\usepackage[francais]{babel}
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}


However, why do you need luainputenc? utf8 is already the default
encoding for luatex.

Texlive "just" packages what's there it can't mostly change the
package code so you need to report this upstream to Javier to fix in
babel. It probably should force that UTF-8 is in fact the file
encoding in force when reading the utf8 patterns.
(\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc} turns _off_ luatex's utf8 support)

Incidentally do you have a good use case for using luainputenc
(especially with utf8 encoding) from time to time looked at whether to
integrate something like that into inputenc but there are some issues
(not least with hyphenation:-) and no obvious real use cases for new
documents.

I don't think old device names should be removed, because epstopdf can
be used with old versions of ghostscript.  That list of devices are
those which are allowed in restricted name (despite the name of the
variable, which is rather confusing to me).

    siep> Also, in recent versions of ghostscript epswrite has been replaced

I can add eps2write.  I see a number of other new devices in current gs
that should be added too.

However, I have a bigger question: for the restricted epstopdf, do we
need to allow the --device option at all?  Does anyone actually use
repstopdf to convert EPS to a bitmap?  That's what's being implemented
here and I find myself doubtful.

It would clearly be less ongoing maintenance to just disallow the
--device option completely in restricted mode, so that repstopdf
unconditionally and unchangeably outputs PDF (device pdfwrite).
Would anyone notice?  The non-restricted epstopdf would still accept
--device (with any value).

Reactions?

Thanks,
Karl

How feasible would it  be to allow *tex and texlua to run under
restricted shell escape?

Since they run under the same texmf.cnf security settings as the
calling tex document it would appear that it ought to be safe?

The following document for example run with pdflatex typesets  "300"
calculated by lua (and some other text, the removal of which is just
detail:-) but currently it requires --shell-escape.


\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\expandafter\input\expandafter
{\detokenize{"|luatex '\directlua{print(100+200)}\end'"}}

    How feasible would it  be to allow *tex and texlua to run under
    restricted shell escape?

The problems I thought of (and put in texmf.cnf comments) back when we
created --shell-escape were that a) the --shell-escape option itself
must be disabled, and b) openout_any must be forced to "p", even if the
openout_any value for the top level tex is something else.  openin_any
should probably also be p.

And ... do I want to create new rENGINE binaries for (m)any values of
ENGINE, with all the concomitant pain and confusion?  Not at all ...

Beyond that, for Lua specifically, although I know that Lua was designed
to be a secure embedded language, it would take a lot of effort to
research and disable possible "exploits" in such a context.  For
starters, obviously dynamic library loading must be disabled, arbitrary
file reading/writing, and who knows what else (not me)...

If the practical goal is to use luatex features in other tex's, maybe
some crippled form of texlua, specifically, could be created (not by me)
and allowed.  But is that useful enough to be worth the trouble?  If
nothing else, the performance would be pretty awful, even on today's
machine, even given everything, so couldn't use it in even moderately
intensive contexts, I suspect.

?

Oh so you did, sorry:-)
Funny thing was I was reading those comments just the other day in a
different context but didn't come to mind when I  was musing about
this this morning.

ug so you would (certainly disabling --shell-escape)

No. New binaries wasn't what I had in mind, so just "no" is OK:-)

If it weren't for the possibility of passing a comandline option to
the restricted call (which I'm happy to accept kills the idea)
wouldn't the issues with libraries and file writing be just the same as
a top level lualatex call? ie the internal call wouldn't be able to write
or load libraries that a direct call to luatex could do?

Not sure I had a _practical_ goal, was just musing on possibilities;-)

certainly it's not worth going to any trouble. It's always possible to test
any such idea using a top level --shell-escape, and if there are practical
applications and timing isn't too bad either just live with needing the flag
or look then if there is a safe configuration that could be used.

TL2016 is not even in pre-testing yet, so you'll update your TL2015
packages as normal. It is possible, though not recommended, to update
from one TL release to the next if you point an 'older' version at a
'newer' set of packages.

    wouldn't the issues with libraries and file writing be just the same
    as a top level lualatex call?

The difference is that programs enabled by shell_escape should be safe
for someone to download an arbitrary document, e.g. written by someone
else, and process with tex, and be reasonably assured that nothing
terrible will happen.

Whereas at the top level, the user is doing the invoking, so they are
assuming some risk :).  

shell_escape came into being earlier than luatex.  I admit I hadn't
really thought about it before.  Without Lua in the picture, the
defaults for shell_escape stuff are a decent attempt at being secure, as
far as I know.  I doubt anyone would want Lua(TeX) to be crippled so as
to make lua(la)tex invocations secure by default, which seems like what
it would boil down to.

Thus, anyone invoking lualatex from the cmdline (or through their GUI)
should know (in theory anyway) that Lua can do all kinds of things and
results cannot be guaranteed.  I'm not sure if we can do better.

Hmm.

Thanks,
K

But my understanding is that recent luatex _does_ prevent lua from
using os.execute
and similar commands using the same texmf.cnf settings as write18 so
with details to be determined
it's not so different from running classic tex.

    But my understanding is that recent luatex _does_ prevent lua from
    using os.execute and similar commands using the same texmf.cnf
    settings as write18

1) I wasn't aware of this.  All to the good.

2) If dynamic library loading is enabled by default, any theory of
enhanced security is chimerical, as far as I can see.

3) Besides \write18 restrictions, there is openout_any to be considered.
If Lua is allowed to write to any file anywhere ...  I have to wonder
about network access too, which is not an issue with any other TeX.
That is the most common way to spread viruses and such, after all.

On Windows, (luaTeX beta-0.89.1)
--
-- test.lua
os.spawn('cmd /C del /Q abc.tex')

texlua test.lua

worked, and abc.tex was removed with
openout_any = p

hmm the manual says

The  switches --[no-]shell-escape, --[enable|disable]-write18, and --shell-
restricted have the same effects as in pdfTEX, and additionally make
io.popen(), os.execute,
os.exec and os.spawn adhere to the requested option.

...

In keeping with the other TEX-like programs in TEXLive, the two Lua
functions os.execute and
io.popen (as well as the two new functions os.exec and os.spawn that
are explained below) take
the value of shell_escape and/or shell_escape_commands in account.
Whenever LuaTEX is run
with the assumed intention to typeset a document (and by that I mean
that it is called as luatex,
as opposed to texlua, and that the commandline option --luaonly was
not given), it will only run
the four functions above if the matching texmf.cnf variable(s) or
their texconfig (see section 4.15)
counterparts allow execution of the requested system command. In
`script interpreter' runs of LuaTEX,
these settings have no effect, and all four functions function as
normal. This change is new in 0.37.0.


Is that not working? (I'll test the cygwin version I have tomorrow)

It works for os.execute(), but here it does not work for os.spawn().
Similar safer codes are written also for os.spawn().
I'll study later today, if I'm wrong or ...

I was wrong.

Both of
--
-- t.lua
os.spawn('rm abc.tex')

and

--
-- t.lua
os.execute('rm abc.tex')

remove abc.tex by "texlua t.lua" with shell_escape = p.

Both of
%
% t.tex
\directlua{os.spawn('rm abc.tex')}
\bye

and

%
% t.tex
\directlua{os.execute('rm abc.tex')}
\bye

do not remove abc.tex by "luatex t.tex" with whell_escape = p,
but remove abc.tex by "luatex --shell-escape t.tex".

Akira

In texlua, os.execute() etc. should be allowed freely, as in the
present implement, since texlua is used as wrappers of various
applications on Windows TeX Live. Thus it should not be in
shell_escape_commands, I think.

It took me a while to answer? since I tried to find a case for using using luainputenc, and failed to find anything other than the ability to switch smoothly from lualatex to pdflatex.

If I remember correctly, using babel with luatex proved not reliable without luainputenc some years ago, which is why I used luainputenc with the utf8 encoding in the first place. However, testing on some typical documents, I do not find any problem with TexLive 2015, so I guess I can simply erase this line in my documents?

Thank you all in the TexLive List for the great work you do : as a user, I really appreciate your commitment,

Yes agreed definitely, texlua has unrestricted access so shouldn't be
allowed  in the restricted setting.

Hi,

The inconsolata package was updated a few days ago, and since then the font
is not discovered by lualatex/fontspec/luaotfload when using
\setmonofont{Inconsolata zi4}.

I have tried different naming scheme although that was the one I have been
using for a while without issues. I tried regenerating the font database
with luaotfload-tool. The only thing that worked was to specify the
filename instead.

looking at the luaotfload-names.lua.gz before and after the update, the
metadata in the font changed:

before the update:

   ["basename"]="Inconsolatazi4-Bold.otf",
   ["familyname"]="inconsolatazi4",

Hi Greg,

Problems with packages should be reported to their maintainers (Michael
Sharpe, in this case).  I passed on this one.

Filename lookups are vastly more reliable/portable anyway ... -k

 Hello

Some days ago I updated Tex Live 2015 with
tlmgr -all
and now my Tex Live doesn't work.
TexStudio says it can't start pdflatex.

If I try to run pfdlatex directly it says.

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015/W32TeX)
(preloaded format=pdflatex)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
---! c:/texlive/2015/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt doesn't match
pdftex.pool
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)


fmtutil --all    doesn't solve the problem either
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence
order): fmtutil: c:/texlive/2015/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf fmtutil:

I've tried to repair everything from Tex Live Manager , runing as admin, no
errors but pdflatex still doesn't work.

I don't use firewall, and the antivirus is not the problem.

What should I do?

Thanks

For some reason your pdflatex.fmt was created with a different version of
pdftex.pool. It is necessary to regenerate the format, most probably all
formats. You can do it by:

fmtutil-sys --all

Reinstalled everything and still the same problem.
The problem only happens with the 64bit executable,  the 32bit one is OK.

Now, after   fmtutil -sys --all   it works, thanks.
I don't know if this happened to others too

It sometimes happens, usually if you have wrong setting of PATH during
update. The *.pool files contains all strings including the error messages
so if the files do not match, TeX is unable to display a better error
message.

Please read  "00README.TLW64"  carefully if you want to use 64bit binaries:

    The 64bit binaries are made with the latest sources. Therefore several
    TeX engines may not be compatible with the present TeX Live. Thus users
    should run the command
    fmtutil-sys --all

Akira

There are no pool files anymore.  Strings are compiled into the binaries
for about a decade.  Taco is our hero.

Hence the error message

  c:/texlive/2015/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt doesn't match
  pdftex.pool
  (Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

is misleading.  There *is* no file "pdftex.pool" in TeX Live and no
program needs it.

If you get this error message though, there must be something wrong
wrong with the binary and a more reasonable error message would be
"This can't happen".

BTW, the string "This can't happen" is already in the string pool. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

First of all, many thanks for your W32TeX!  I also use your TLW64
binaries on top of my TeXLive 2015 and my observation is also that
TeXLive uses its own binaries everytime fmtutil is triggered upon an
update.  Hence, I have to issue

    fmtutil-sys --all

manually in order to match the fmt-files to TLW64 binaries which come
first in my PATH.

Best, Arash

Shouldn't it be "specify" instead of "specificy"?

Thanks for catching that, Denis. That's actually the first typo I
spotted. I should have focused on that first before getting excited
about hunting for other typos.

Thanks for committing, Norbert.

Message-ID: <3defbac1.3a64.152fcff42e3.Coremail.13122528038@163.com>

Hi there,

Back in the time when I first tried to have a taste of Latex I run into a problem that I posted on Askubuntu: http://askubuntu.com/q/706561/398861. It really have bothered me many times and I wrote an answer there myself recently only to find that it just doesn't work actually. I have set the VMWare to make the system have a maximum storage of 80G, but after the configuration the sda1 only has 20G as original. Then I have created a new filesystem sda3 which has about 15G storage. So I thought I have two methods to tackle the problems: 1) enlarge the root filesystem or 2) install tex-live into the new volume.

Could anyone please point me in the right direction? Thanks.

I know nothing of Ubuntu.  Under Windows 7 64-bit, a full installation
of TeX Live 2014 requires of the order of 7.5Gb :

In Fedora TeXlive 2015 (scheme-full) requires 5.1 GB. The difference is
that TL is based also on programs that are parts of Linux (ghostscript,
perl, etc.). These programs have to be shipped with TL for Windows and it
takes some additional space. If you need to save space, do not install
documentation, you can always find it on the web.

TeX Live 2014 requires 5.2 GB on Linux.  If Windows needs much more
disk space, it's very likely that data blocks are larger than on
Linux.

Which file system are you using, FAT or NTFS?  AFAIK the size of data
blocks is 4 kB on NTFS by default (same as on Linux) but on FAT file
systems it depends on the size of the disk and large blocks are quite
common.

Is it possible to spot the size of data blocks on your system somehow?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yeah, you're right. I need to remove the documentation. I've successfully linstalled Texlive by changing the value of tex_prefix variable from /usr/local/texlive to a new directory in the new volume.

Mea culpa -- the figures I reported previously were for the whole of
D:\TeX\Live; they should have been restricted to D:\TeX\Live\2014. The
corrected figures are as follows :

	32453 Directories
	132775 Files
	4 780 224 567 bytes

Cluster size is 4096 ("4096 bytes in each allocation unit")

However, testing on some typical documents, I do not find any problem with TexLive 2015, so I guess I can simply erase this line in my documents?

Here is an example, involving french guillemets. When using luainputenc, the quotation marks are printed as expected; which is not the case without luainputenc :

% !TEX TS-program = luaLaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[francais]{babel}
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}

\begin{document}
?French guillemet?
\end{document}

However, using fontspec, everything compiles fine :

% !TEX TS-program = luaLaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}

\begin{document}
?French guillemet?
\end{document}

Other example (euro, german sharp s) are given on 
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/230268/new-century-schoolbook-font-in-lualatex

Herbert Voss, asked why I needed luainputenc : I need some symbols which are not available without luainputenc, unless I switch to fontspec. Being a happy user of the fouriernc fonts, I have yet to find an Opentype font matching fouriernc. TexGyre Schola is unfortunately not an option : as seen on http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TeX-Gyre-Schola , the dots on i?s are hardly readable, which is not the case with fouriernc.

fonspec as default loads some packages for unicode support. Anyway, if you
want to have correct hyphenation, you should use:

\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setdefaultlanguage{french}

This will load fontspec automatically.

Without fontspec and without luainputenc it uses

LMRoman10-Regular  Type 1C

and with fontspec it uses

LMRoman10-Regular-Identity-H   CID Type 0C

However, using fontspec should be the default and then there is
no need for luainputenc

Being a happy user of the fouriernc fonts, I have yet to find an Opentype font matching fouriernc. TexGyre Schola is unfortunately not an option : as seen on http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TeX-Gyre-Schola , the dots on i?s are hardly readable, which is not the case with fouriernc.

Hello,

I'm Software Engineering student, in Brazil. I would like to know if the
tex-live applied to GSoC organization. Because I have a project idea that
involves LaTeX and I would to work with it in GSoC.

Thanks :)

I'm afraid that you asked too late (after the deadline for application
has already passed). TUG did not apply.

Dear list members,

Does anyone have a copy of the source code for OPatGen? It used to be here:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/patlib/, but now that page is gone.

Yes, I know OPatGen is old and doesn't compile anymore, but I'm
wondering if it could be resurrected.

Thanks,

Aleksandr

Subject: [tex-live] dvipdfmx and dvips(k): different special psfile output
Message-ID: <20160228120339.83277bcd4c8319729fe19441@ramoncasares.com>

I have found what it seems a bug in dvipdfmx.
It happens using \special{psfile=auxiliar.0},
when auxiliar.0 is a ps file with llx and lly no 0.

I've concocted the following minimal test case,
that I run in a Debian Jessie (stable) OS
with TeX Live installed:

1 File: auxiliar.mpost (8 lines)

charcode:=0; cm#=28.45276;
w:=4cm#*pt; h:=2cm#*pt; d:=1cm#*pt;
pickup pencircle scaled 1pt;
draw (0,0) -- (0,h) -- (w,h) -- (w,0) -- cycle;
draw (0,0) -- (0,-d) -- (w,-d) -- (w,0);
draw (-1cm,-2cm) -- (w,h);
shipit;
end.

2 Run: mpost auxiliar.mpost

You will get ps file auxiliar.0 (612 bytes).
mpost version 1.999.

3 File: test.tex (1 line)

A\special{psfile=auxiliar.0}B\bye

4 Run: tex test.tex

You will get dvi file test.dvi (228 bytes)
tex version 3.14159265.

5 Run: dvips test.dvi

You will get ps file test.ps (27 kB).
dvips(k) version 5.994.

6 Run: dvipdfmx test.dvi

You will get a pdf file test.pdf (2 kB).
dvipdfmx version 20140317.

7 Compare the outputs of test.ps and test.pdf

They are different!
Look at the location of letters A and B.

Best regards, 
   Ram?n Casares
