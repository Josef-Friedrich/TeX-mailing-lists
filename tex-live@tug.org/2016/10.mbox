Good morning,

I was told by Karl Berry that this was the right place to ask my question. I have problems updating TeXLive on Ubuntu. My situation is described in details here: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/324918/cannot-update-texlive-2016

I hope you can help me.

Best regards,
A.P.

Do you have the path to TL 2016 binaries at the beginning of PATH? What
does echo $PATH return?

It seems to me that kpsewhich looks to a dofferent installation.

You probably are calling the tlmgr from Ubuntu. What does 
   which tlmgr
say?

    I get an error message: !LaTeX Error: Environment proof undefined.

the proof environment is defined in the
amsthm package.

since the proof ends with an equation,
to avoid having the end-of-proof box on
a line by itself, place
  \qedhere
before the \end{equation}.

also, there shouldn't be any blank lines
in this example; however, i assume that
they are introduced by the mailer you
are using.

    I also tried to fake it by adding a square at the end of my proof with \boxempty. I also get an error message,

that isn't going to work properly.

    How can I solve these problems using teX Live?

\usepackage{amsthm} and follow the

Dear Humberto,
first of all, none of your problems is related to TeX Live.  You'll
encounter the same problems with any other TeX distribution as well.

It seems that you are quite new to the LaTeX world.  Hence I strongly
recommend to consult

  http://tug.org/begin.html 

This page provides links to many useful documents about TeX and LaTeX.

LaTeX provides some basic facilities but most of its features come
from external packages.  If you want to use the align environment,
you have to include the amsmath package, for example.

It's essential to know how LaTeX works and I strongly recommend to
consult the documents mentioned above.

Regards,
  Reinhard

 It was equally surprising to me.

 The author wrote to CTAN asking us to remove this package from
 the archive, arguing it was "too old" and contained "too many
 typographical bugs".

 I tried to convince him _not_ to do this, mentioning that this
 would lead to removal from TeX Live as well, which would be a
 pity, given that this is a standard reference.  But it seemed
 that he knew exactly what he was doing and that this was what
 he wanted.  So there we are ...

 BTW:
 http://mirror.ctan.org/obsolete/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf
 still exists.  (Hope it won't have to disappear, too ...)

there will be a new version with less bugs and nicer typography
at http://tug.org/hvoss/PDF/. It will be finished as soon as possible.
And all examples will be standalone documents.

We are volunteers, and sometimes real world forces us to spend time
differently than immediately importing updates from CTAN.

Please wait a bit.

     (updated today) is v1.54, but in ctan is the v1.55

If you look inside the pst-eucl.tex file in TL, I suspect you will see
a \fileversion of 1.55.  At least I do.

That is, I surmise you are looking at the tlmgr GUI version, which may
not be accurate, due to timing of updates of the different pieces
(specifically, the Catalogue file vs. the TL rebuild).  See, e.g.,

Subject: [tex-live] tilde in file/folder  names (again)
Message-ID: <43fti67pmxzf.dlg@nililand.de>


Due to a question on the miktex bug tracker I made some tests with
folders and file names with a tilde in it on windows10.

There was a long discussion about this in 2014, and there Akira
claimed that on texlive 2015 it should work:

http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2014-June/035507.html

But all my tests in tl15 and tl16 (and miktex) fail. 
They fail due to the active tilde with plain and latex, even if the
file names are quoted:

G:\>pdftex "Z-Temp\~foo\test-tilde"
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live
2016/W32TeX) (preloaded format=pdftex)

 restricted \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode
! I can't find file `./test'.
<to be read again>
                   \penalty


with the other engines (xetex, luatex) one gets similar results.

Has there be some regression?

Usual tilde may not work. But I think tilde in "short file name"

Yes, you are right,

pdftex TEST-S~1 works, where TEST-S~1 is the short name of
TEST-Something.tex

But pdftex TEST~T~1 doesn't work, where TEST~T~1 ist the short name
of test~tilde. 

Rather confusing. Does pdftex internally first expand the short name
to a long name? This would explain why the "short tilde" doesn't
matter.

Yes, TeXs first change short name into long name.

If the engine does expand ~ can't do anything about plain tex, but for
any formats based on etex we _could_
fix this by using \protected\def~{...}  in the format so it is safe in
filenames.

Somewhat related to a parallel discussion elsewhere about use or not
of etex in latex.

which is true but not that relevant as of course the bash commandline
is expanding ~ to my home directory here.

That would make sure that ~ doesn't expand to \nobreak\space, and gets
passed as a character to the engine's file open code, whether
\input{~/foo} then means foo.tex in the user's home directory is down
to kp.. you:-)

actually before you do, let me check some of the tex expansion side,
was just trying now and \protected not working quite as I thought,
but it's late, someone else free to try

I'll report back later

but


\catcode`A=13

\protected\defA{x}

\input xAb


\bye

looks like it is expanding A anyway so perhaps I'm just wrong about
\protected, it happens:(

! I can't find file `xxb'.

The documentation says :
>
> \protected
>     is a prefix, analogous to \long, \outer, and \global; it associates with the macro being defined an attribute which inhibits expansion of the macro in expansion-only contexts (for example, within the parameter text of a \write or \edef); if, however, the parser or command processor (TeX's `oesophagus' and `stomach', in Knuth's alimentary paradigm) is currently demanding a /command/, then the \protected macro will expand in the normal way. This behaviour is identical to that displayed by the explicit expansion of a token-list register through the use of \the; the same model is used elsewhere in e-TeX to achieve a consistent paradigm for /partial expansion/. 
>
so the question is "is \input an expansion-only context or does its use cause the parser or command processor to expect a command ?  The TeXbook says "the expansion is null; but TeX prepares to read from the specified file ...".  I interpret the latter as indicating that expansion will be inhibited when \input expands to null, but not inhibited when TeX prepares to read from the specified file.

Sorry about that, I was completely wrong!

I was confused why \protected worked to make _ safe in filenames after
a package had made it active, but didn't work for ~  as I'd just had
an answer accepted on stackexchange doing that

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/334705/tex-capacity-exceeded-ot1ztmcm/334712#334712

but the reason turns out that that was completely wrong as well
(despite having been upvoted and accepted, you can't trust anything on
the internet:-)

in latex it _seems_ to work if you use the brace form \input{aaa_b} or
\input{~/xxx} and just look at the missing file error as latex avoids
tex's primitive missing file loop and generates an error with \write
and \errmessage in which case \protected does stop the expansion so
you get an error that aaa_b is not found, but it's actually looking
for aaa and typesetting _b :(

anyway sorry for the noise and raising false hopes of an easy fix.

David

That is one of many reasons why I refused to participate in its activities, another being the mechanism for allowing discussion on a topic to be arbitrarily terminated.

This is not a problem with stackexchange but to be expected when you
communicate with people.

In all ((la)tex and non latex support) chanels I have visited over
the years (usenet, email, forum, tex.sx) I had cases where I wrote
an answer, got greatful "this works great" feetbacks and then
realised that  I had written nonsense.  

And I saw cases where people sticked stubbornly to a rubbish
solution even if they were told that it would bite them and that
they are better alternatives.

Expecting that every vote or tick is correct means that you expect
that everyone carefully test solutions, spent time to ponder over
them and don't make errors when judging the code -- not a very
probably scenario.

sometimes I go to stackoverflow or other places on stackex
looking for an already provided
basic answer about Python, GNU Make or whatever, and indeed,
if I am logged I will upvote the accepted answer if it also
solves my question.

but what I have observed many times on stack.exchange is that
people upvote answers which solve problems they were not
confronted with to start with, that they have no competence
to judge, and that they even don't test at all. Nice pictures
will more easily draw upvotes. This is a phenomenon you see
when you provide a new answer to an old question which had
a disputable accepted answer. Providing a new answer brings
the question upfront on the site, and in an automatic
manner you see upvotes going to the already accepted answer,
at a speed so high (it seems traffic is much lower nowadays,
so perhaps two years ago) that it is not possible that the
people have tested the code. Meanwhile your new, imaginative
answer, remains unread, un-understood, and un-upvoted.

anyway, perhaps we can observe what happens with

Hi Phil,

a typical example is here: 

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/334933/is-there-a-need-for-a-more-modern-tex

rather than providing a decent answer explaining xetex, luatex, LaTeX3, they just terminate the question. Even as a registered user I can't even express a vote to re-open it.

now the poor guy who asked the question goes away with a poor opinion of the TeX community, for sure.

I am saying this despite a kind of subdued tone in this question, like the guy felt like asking permission. Well he/she adopted subdued tone but was quickly expelled nevertheless !

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Yes, a not unusual example, and one I find totally unacceptable.  It would seem that there is a small cadre of regulars who take it on themselves to "police" Stack Exchange, declaring "off-limits" any message that fails to meet their particular criteria without any consideration as to whether or not the question is (a) valid, and (b) worthy of discussion.

I don't believe *this* discussion is related to TeXLive in any way,
which is the topic of this list.

If you want to discuss tex.se, there's a chatroom
(https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/41/tex-latex-and-friends)
and there's meta (http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/). And texhax still exists.

Best

I can only repeat my remark:

>> Expecting that every vote or tick is correct means that you expect
>> that everyone carefully test solutions, spent time to ponder over
>> them and don't make errors when judging the code -- not a very
>> probably scenario.

Relevance and popularity is not the same and in all voting systems
sometimes the wrong candidate wins. But unless you want to restrict
votes and judging to the "capable experts" or not vote at all you
will have to accepts that sometimes questions about donkeys gets
much more points than a imagitive answer and that only a few experts
realize (and care) that your answer is better than an existing one.  

Btw: while I take votes and ticks into account when looking for code
I never take them as ultimate as I know that votes and ticks are
rewarded by non-experts and so can be wrong.

TeXworks (/qua/ TeXworks) will not complain that files such as "booktabs.sty" or "paralist.sty" are not present, since TeXworks is concerned primarily with the location of executable images, not style files.  It will be LaTeX (or one of its successors -- PdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX, ...) that complains about such things.  Therefore since you are using TeX Live, the question would be better put on the TeX Live list -- tex-live at tug.org <mailto:tex-live at tug.org> (cc'd).

As Philip wrote, it is not a problem of TeXworks but ox *LaTeX binaries.
First you should preferably install LaTeX packages by your packaging
manager, i.e. apt-get if you have Debian TeX Live packages, or tlmgr if you
have TeX Live from TUG. These managers will automatically put the files to
the correct places and do all other important actions. It may occasionally
happen that you need a file which is not available from the packaging
system. In such a case you can:

1. If you intend to use the file with one document only, the best way is to
put it to the working directory of your document
2. If you plan to use it in several documents, put it to a directory under
$TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex and then run mktexlsr. You will find the real
location of $TEXMFLOCAL by
kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL

The most frequent problem of people having TeX Live from TUG is setting of
PATH. Linux usually installst its own TeX distribution based on
dependencies. Both distributions may then conflict. If you have TeX Live
from TUG and want to use it, you _must_ have its binary directory at the
_beginning_ of PATH. And this is not the only requirement, it must be set
properly. If you run tex from a terminal, the setting is read from
~/.bashrc but if rou invoke tex from a GUI such as TeXworks, the setings is
read from ~/.bash_profile (it is not a matter of TeX Live, it is defined
this way in UNIX systems). You can make a simple document hello.tex
containing:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello
\end{document}

Now run pdflatex hello from the terminal and save the log file. The compile
the same file from TeXworks. Compare the location of article.cls in these
two log files. If they are different, you have this very problemm, GUI does
not use the same PATH as the terminal. I solve the problem by setting
everything in ~/.bashrc only and my ~/.bash_profile contains:

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Remember, if you change ~/.bashrc, you must reopen the terminal window. If
you change ~/.bash_profile, you must logout and login.

Hope this helps.

I think that they have a policy to avoid discussions about whether program X is better than program Y (to avoid things like emacs vs. vi flamewars).

Avoiding flame wars is undoubtedly a good thing.  But preventing intelligent discussion as to whether X is better than Y is very ill-judged; how better for a newcomer to learn whether to opt for (say) XeTeX or LuaTeX than to read an intelligent discussion between advocates of each ?

Someone prefers LuaTeX for some reason. Someone prefers XeTeX for some
reasons. Someone prefers LaTeX, someone plain, someone ConTeXt. If these
people present arguments supporting their preferences, a newcomer can find
mor exactly his/her needs and choose what will best suit to him/her. There
is no absolute winner in engines and formats, each of us has different
needs and preferences, discussion will help newcomers to find their way.

Good point.

I often wonder why there are so many engines .... is this due to output format needs?

Hello,

The installation of uppunctlm package in texlive seems wrong:
currently all files are installed under doc/fonts/uppunctlm, but
tex/* and {tfm,vf}/* should be under tex/latex/uppunctlm and
fonts/{tfm,vf}/public/uppunctlm respectively.

Regards,
Hironobu Yamashita

Message-ID: <4B2902CE-4729-44D6-8066-B77D6830EB49@free.fr>

Hi,

the Asana-Math README contains:

*******************************************************************
NOTE: Ideally, the font should be installed systemwide. However,  *
the .TTC file should be installed only in Windows systems and it  *
is provided for people using FireFox, Word, etc. In addition, the *
.TTC file should not be included in a standard TeX installation.  *
On Unix or Unix-like system, an administrtor can install either   *
the .otf or the .TTC file in her system.                          *
*******************************************************************

I was bitten recently by this because XeTeX was finding the .TTC
file, which contrarily to the .otf file creates a problem with
input such as $\dot{x}$.

The reason why my XeTeX was finding the .TTC is secondary 

(I am on
mac os x, and I have symlinks to /opentype and /truetype TeXLive
repertories in my $HOME/Library/Fonts, and for some reason
\setmathfont{Asana Math} resulted in the TTC font being used),

but taking into account the above, could there be a way to
split the package into two so that using `tlmgr` it becomes
easier to remove the TTC font ? or even better that `tlmgr`
will not install ASANA.TTC if not on windows ? (I don't know
if such architecture dependent thing are possible for tlmgr
when handling non-binaries)

I can suppress it manually but an update in the package will probably 
result in texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/public/Asana-Math/ASANA.TTC
reappearing.

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Just curious... with this setup, does Asana Math show up in Font Book? 
What faces does it show as being present in the family, and can you 
disable the .ttc version there so that the .otf becomes the "active" one?

Hi All,

I am really sorry I didn't reply sooner.

The depth and precision of your answer was astonishing and very valuable 
for me.

I didn't want to install the tex libraries using the package manager 
because I needed to install them in an external drive.

I ended up changing the paths inside Texworks itself as you gentlemen 
suggest, I already tried to do so, but I was expecting that the path 
would have been checked recursively, it is not.

I want to iterate on how much I appreciate your deep and precise answers.

Thanks

Simone Mosciatti

2. I seldom (never) use FontBook because I have had dire experiences with it (abysmally slow or hangs for long periods of times.) (*) 

(*) I recall now that this was impression left on me by attempts to use "Font Libraries"

It shows **three faces.** This put me into considerable turmoil (because I had mixed up with symbolic links earlier today doing some tests and thought it was a remnant) going to such extremes as 

$ sudo atsutil databases -remove  (and reboot)

with the hope to clear the FontBook preferences regarding activation of fonts (I also removed ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontRegistry.user.plist, to no avail).

But it is simply the fact that there seems to be indeed two fonts in the .TTC, as confirmed by running "strings" on it, I get

Asana Math
Regular
FontForge : Asana Math : 3-10-2007
and FontBook says it has 4886 glyphs

and

Asana
Regular
FontForge : Asana : 30-5-2015
and FontBook says it has 4886 glyphs

FontBook tells me location of the first is 

/Users/XXXXXX/Library/Fonts/TeXTrueType/public/Asana-Math/ASANA.TTC (copie inactive)

and the second

/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/public/Asana-Math/ASANA.TTC


(these are the same locations, actually).

And the third one is the .otf file with location

/Users/XXXXXX/Library/Fonts/TeXOpenType/public/Asana-Math/Asana-Math.otf (copie active)

and 3378 glyphs reported by FontBook


3. Yes I can de-activate the **two** fonts associated with ASANA.TTC. I did this, as reported 
above with (copie inactive) and (copie active) respectively.

After this, XeTeX indeed uses the only one FontBook activated, i.e. the .otf one.

Hi,

in the package bibtex, i think
apalike.tex and apalike.sty should move from docfiles -> runfiles

While looking through the docs, here and there one finds .doc-files.
It feels a bit strange and pointless to me to use a another/proprietary 
format for tex-documentation. Btw, only about 0.25% of all 
documentation-files are .doc-files

Hi Johannes,

True enough, thanks.  Fixed for tonight, I hope.

    It feels a bit strange and pointless to me to use a
    another/proprietary format for tex-documentation.

I agree, but I don't have the energy to try to talk to authors about
it.  If you or anyone else does (ha :), feel free, by all means.

Since .doc files can, in practice, be read with free software
(LibreOffice etc.), it's not a problem.  (Also, in theory, the file
format is "open" now, but that's a different story which you are
probably aware of ...)

Finally, as I'm sure you know, many of the TL files with extension .doc
(like bibtex's), are not Microsoft word-processor documents, but just a
text file that happens to have extension ".doc".

Thanks,
Karl

Long ago, emtex used the .doc extension for plain text
documentation. This is at least the case with
texmf-dist/doc/bibtex/germbib/apalike.doc.

Collections are not created easily, and in particular not for
a single package - imagine what kind of explosion that would
mean if everyone wants a collection for its own package.

Furthermore, we do not track dependencies between packages
by now, mostly between collections. datetime2 is contained
in collection-latexextra, which already depends on collection-pictures,
which contains pgf.

That means, those who install collection-latexextra to get datetime2
will automatically get pgf, too.

Last but not least, checking datetime2.sty I don't see any reference
to pgfcalendar, the only RequirePackage calls are 
	\RequirePackage{tracklang}
	\RequirePackage{etoolbox}
	\RequirePackage{xkeyval}[2006/11/18]

pgf* is only used by datetime2-calc which is optional addon.

Thanks

Not just emTeX: you see old open source stuff using .doc generally for
this purpose. 'One of those things': not much can be done (there is no
single point of truth for extension meaning).

As there is a collection-texworks with one package and one collection, i 
thought it could be an idea to put the 43 datetime2-packages also in a 
collection. The collection-latexextra would look a little more clear, as 
it would have contained the the new collection instead of the single 
packages.
It was just a thought, no problem to leave it as it is.

> Furthermore, we do not track dependencies between packages
> by now, mostly between collections.

At least some packages have set some dependencies, e.g. beamer depends
on pgf an xcolor. I thought it is convinient to add dependencies to 
packages beside that collections depend on collections.
I'm aware that there was never a complete dependency tracking planed.

Ok, no hard dependency.
Thanks for the explanation.

In reference to
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/336067/change-default-metafonts-mode-resolution-as-when-called-directly-from-pdflatex
I would propose a change in TeX Live 2017.

The default value of \pdfpkresolution (currently 72) should be set
according to a variable in texmf.cnf, so setting it in pdftexconfig.tex
would no longer be needed. Of course, regenerating formats would still be
needed after changing the value in texmf.cnf, but that's much less of a
burden than having multiple copies of `pdftexconfig.tex` around.

Ciao

This has a different reason, namely that ship texworks binaries only for Windows, but not for any other arch. I would be more than happy to get rid of it, though ;-)

>I'm aware that there was never a complete dependency tracking planed.

Indeed, I'm working on a more complete solution that does some magic to add dependencies, but due to real world requirements (new job, baby) I cannot dedicate as much time as I would like to.

Have you called updmap, enabling the map file? Have you
actually generated a map file? Which instructions are you

TeX Live W32 does not see mktex.cnf.
In TeX Live W32, write in your texmf.cnf as
MAKETEXPK_MODE = yourdefaultmode
for example,
MAKETEXPK_MODE = canonex

The other platforms read mktex.cnf.

Years ago, the extension .doc was used to indicate a heavily
commented .sty file. The comments provided documentation of
the package. One could simply rename these files with .sty endings
or run them through some tex macros (collectively referred to
as docstrip) to remove the comments. This was a precursor of
the current .dtx packaging system.

Many of these .doc files are left over from that era. One of
these is apalike.doc (which should really be deleted because
apalike.sty has since been changed and actually has even
more comments).

Sorry, but changing pdftex to require a dpi value in texmf.cnf, instead
of having it in the fmt, just doesn't sound right to me.

The current state is that people can easily change the mode/dpi
per-document, as Martin wrote. It's not clear to me that it should be
"easy" to change the system default. For one thing, it's going to be
different with other engines.

I had thought there was a way to override the .fmt settings with
environment variables, but it seems pdftex does not allow for that. (That
much would be easy enough to change, with no impact on anything.)

BTW, if the difference between bitmaps generated for "ljfzzz" and those
generated for "ultre" is not a concern, setting the resolution to 1200
suffices.

I suspect the preferred answer would be to autotrace the shuffle font
and get rid of the need for bitmaps in the first place ... --thanks, k.

    Only 2 out of 31622 files (0.0063247%) are M$-Word documents and
    I suppose that the authors just forgot to convert them to PDF.

a quick look at these three files shows
the following:

 - upmendex.doc is a pure ascii file

 - ijdc-v9.doc is a latex file, with this as its identification:
   \ProvidesClass{ijdc-v9}
    [\Version\space Class for submissions to the International Journal of Digital Curation, volume 9 onwards.]
   the comments at the top say
   %% This is file `idcc.cls',
   %% generated with the docstrip utility.

 - similarly for idcc.doc:
   \ProvidesClass{idcc}
    [\Version\space Class for submissions to the International Digital Curation Conference.]

so the first one is documentation,
probably intended for a --help response.

the other two are .cls files.  why they
are named *.doc is anyone's guess; i
think an inquiry to the author(s) would
be in order, with a request for regeneration.
the .ins file *does* specify .cls as the
extension.

net information gained from this exploration:
zero word files in the collection.  "merely"
a most unfortunate naming coincidence.

Do you have a .map-file? And if yes, what happens if you add to your
document \pdfmapfile{=<the-name-of-your-map-file>.map}

Howdy,

I believe this problem has been solved offline. It seems that `updmap` was run at some point  and there was an interfering map file in the personal texmf-var. 

Good Luck,

These are doc files which are word files according to the file
command. There are only 2, both accompanied by pdfs:

./doc/fonts/stix/STIX_Font_1.1.1-latex_Release_Documentation.doc
./doc/fonts/stix/STIX_Font_1.1.1_Release_Documentation.doc

There are also docx documents, again, accompanied by pdfs:

./doc/fonts/tex-gyre-math/test-word-texgyre_pagella_math.docx
./doc/fonts/tex-gyre-math/test-word-texgyre_schola_math.docx
./doc/fonts/tex-gyre-math/test-word-texgyre_bonum_math.docx
./doc/fonts/tex-gyre-math/test-word-texgyre_dejavu_math.docx

These are NOT identified as word files (grep -v means 'does not
contain').

Subject: [tex-live] usermode with TEXMFLOCAL as usertree
Message-ID: <D439DDC3-F41F-4E01-8E4C-EF97151BE8A2@free.fr>

Hi,

I wanted to give a try to usermode. For some reason I prefer
installing things in TEXMFLOCAL. But the installation (of
some font) ended up doing updmap. I needed to revert its effect
and issue updmap-sys.

Is there a "localmode" which would handle TEXMFLOCAL, hence for
font installs, use updmap-sys by default.

I think this could have some use, if you manage an installation
and for some reason want to keep the a pristine up-to-date
TeXLive w(say with scheme-full), and
want to install things not in TeXLive, perhaps some fonts
which will be kept from year to year.

(although I personally put my texmf-local under /texlive/YYYY/
because it may contain perishable things as well and I may
want to recreate exact same situation of some years back.)

Of course.  The intention was to identify the files which are neither
recognized as text files nor as Microsoft Word files by file(1).  For
exactly this reason I didn't pass the output to wc -l in order to
expose the names of these files.

However, there is certainly a bug in the Unix file(1) utility I'm
currently using

  $ file --version
  file-5.11
  magic file from /usr/share/misc/magic

or in its configuration.  For all other human readable files the
output contains either the words "text" or "ASCII text" but as you can
see above, each line ends with a comma instead.  This is certainly not
intended.  Maybe I should look for the latest release and file a bug
report if the problem still exists.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Nelson Beebe investigated and answered off-list.  He found out that
RedHat and CentOS shipped file-5.11 with a revised version of
magic.mgc.

The revised version of magic.mgc is now part of the distribution.
After upgrading to file-5.29 I get the same output as you.

  Reinhard

I can't reproduce this, all works fine here.
Anyway, and beside that there's also the rsync-able svn, i didn't find

On ctan there is

which is not same release tarball.
Could that tarball be replaced by texlive-20160523b-source.tar.xz?

It is common for all the anon ftp slots on tug to get used up by stupid
robots or whatever. Despite my limiting by IP address, etc.

    beside that there's also the rsync-able svn, 

In addition to the svn, the whole historic/ directory is available by
rsync ... tug.org::historic/systems/texlive/2016/ 

    On ctan there is
    http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/texlive/Source/texlive-20160520-source.tar.xz,
    which is not same release tarball.

Oops. I updated the directories on tug. I'm not sure if CTAN mirrors
that directory continuously or only when I ask them to update. We'll see
what happens in the next 24 hours or so ... --thanks, karl.
