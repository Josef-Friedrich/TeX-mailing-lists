Subject: [tex-live] extractbb can not read the pdf file generated by mutool
Message-ID: <A55D1456C668557155600E6@math.sci.hokudai.ac.jp>

Dear all,

For the pdf file made by mutool ( http://mupdf.com/ ), I get the 
following warning with extractbb.

extractbb:warning: Invalid xref table entry [0]. PDF file is corrupt...
extractbb:warning: Error while parsing PDF file.
extractbb:warning: test.pdf does not look like a PDF file...

The xref table in the pdf file is as follows and there is an empty line 
in front of the trailer. This is why extractbb fails.

---------------
xref
0 5
0000000000 00001 f 
0000000018 00000 n 
0000000064 00000 n 
0000000116 00000 n 
0000003698 00000 n 

trailer
<</Size 5/Root 1 0 R>>
---------------

I wrote the attached patch and now it works well.

Sincerely,
Noriyuki Abe

Subject: [tex-live] TL expl3 update broke a mwe for me
Message-ID: <20160103062129.GA8417@cotopaxi.vpn.ufl.edu>

Attached is a minimal example file. When I compile it with lualatex, it fails
after a recent TL update. The simplicity of the file and the strange error make
me think it could be something specific to my setup so I wanted to check her to
see if anyone else can reproduce with TeX Live 2015.

Attached is mwe.tex, on which I run lualatex; mwe_bad.log, which is my log
after a compilation with an updated TL; and mwe_good.log, which is my log after
a compilation with an updated TL after the following commands:

sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr restore --force l3packages 37997
sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr restore --force l3build 37991
sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr restore --force l3experimental 37997
sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr restore --force l3kernel 38014

The error that I get is:

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> ...or: for example, they allow "MASSE" and "Ma??
                                                  e" to match. 
l.4195   \__unicode_map_inline:n { CaseFolding.txt }

Can anyone reproduce?

I'm on Ubuntu 15.04.

Best,

Scott

This looks like an encoding error.  It would help if you copy and paste the strange output into od or xxd for example.

Your non ascii sequence seems to be C3 83 C2 9F, which appears as a double UTF-8 encoding or something similar. Either the encoding of your mail, the encoding of your system or the encoding of the CaseFolding.txt file is bad, I would bet.

With your numbers above, written in binary form you have:

	11000011 10000011

and

	11000010 10011111

that are quickly calculated into ascii / unicode numbers through the guessed utf-8 encoding

          01.   x in [000000.00000000.0bbbbbbb] ? 0bbbbbbb
          10.   x in [000000.00000bbb.bbbbbbbb] ? 110bbbbb, 10bbbbbb
          11.   x in [000000.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] ? 1110bbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb
          100. x in [bbbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] ? 1110bbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb

where we just need the 2nd (10) rule, here.

	decode_utf8(11000011 10000011) = 000 1100 0011
	decode_utf8(11000010 10011111) = 000 1001 1111

This again is a UTF-8 sequence (guessed again).

	decode_utf8(11000011 10011111) = 1101 1111 = DF

	unicode DF = ?	(latin small letter sharp s)

So "Masse and Ma?e" match.

First shot: What is your system encoding. Most systems now use UTF-8 encodings. Check your locale, by just typing locale. This is an output for my system:

	# locale
	LANG=en_US.UTF-8
	LC_CTYPE=de_DE.UTF-8
	LC_NUMERIC=de_DE.UTF-8
	LC_TIME=de_DE.UTF-8
	LC_COLLATE=de_DE.UTF-8
	LC_MONETARY=de_DE.UTF-8
	LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
	LC_ALL=

Try your example with a utf8 system encoding.

regards

ingo

Ah, no, I get the same error. But what is latin9 luainputenc anyway?

It seems to be broken. Do you really need latin-X?

Convert all your source files to utf8 (with iconv for example) and leave the bad old codepages for people who still run windows 95 or whatever.

There it is: When luatex reads CaseFolding it fails to read over a UTF-8 Sequence in a comment!

There are two errors. 1st, the luatex parser should not try to read "control sequences" in comments, should it? 2nd, a file that contains ASCII representations of unicode characters should onl have comments in the 7bit ascii range.

Replace line 20 of CaseFolding.txt with 

	# full case foldings are superior: for example, they allow "MASSE" and "Ma(sharp s)e" to match.

for example and the luatex error is gone.

regards,

ingo

I'll take a look at this. I guess I'll have to add a defensive test in
case users have picked an encoding other than UTF-8. (For the present,
loading luainputenc after tcolorbox, or rather expl3, will solve the
problem.)

(Ideally, I'd not use encodings other than UTF-8 with LuaTeX: the docs
must be new so there's no real reason to use others. However, this I
guess must be supported.)

I don't understand (I have little knowledge in this area). Are you
suggesting a make a change to my system? From what I see, I do have
UTF-8 set:

$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"

LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=

Which change do you recommend I make?

Scott, it might be more relevant to know which editor you use. They do not always save in the encoding set by the locale.

I'm suggesting its odd to use LuaTeX with a latin9 file, which is what
you've told luainputenc you are using. However, as I say this is an
issue that is fixable in expl3 and will be available over the next day
or so.

    The xref table in the [mu]pdf file is as follows and there is an

Thanks for the report and patch.  Just eyeballing it, it looks ok to me
(except having spaces around if conditions, etc., would be nice :).

Hi,

More permissive approach would make
implementation simple and clear.

I will try some other implementation later.

I found pdftopng in texlive and found it quite useful to create in a

But is is not in miktex and I would like to make a feature request.
Can someone tell me where the official sources are so that I can
point miktex to them?

BTW...

I was not aware of `pdftopng', and with good reason: it doesn't exist on
Linux:

  ?????
  ? $ locate pdftopng
  ? /home/bitouze/texlive-svn/Build/source/libs/xpdf/xpdf-3.04/doc/pdftopng.1
  ? /home/bitouze/texlive-svn/Build/source/libs/xpdf/xpdf-3.04/doc/pdftopng.cat

  ? /home/bitouze/texlive-svn/Master/bin/win32/pdftopng.exe
  ? /home/bitouze/texlive-svn/Master/texmf-dist/doc/support/wintools/pdftopng.pdf
  ?????

As it seems to come from `xpdf' which is available, I guess, mainly for
Un*x systems, why doesn't ir exist on Linux?

Hi,

I've looked the code and proposed patch, and found two problems.

First, mfgets() function can not be used to read a line anymore if you
are willing to allow arbitrary amount of white-space characters to
appear; it returns null-terminated strings while PDF spec. allows
null characters to appear anywhere within a line since they are
simply kind of white-space characters in PDF.

Next, garbage after valid data is not detected since it simply does
sscanf() and does not check the data unread.

The second problem is also in the original code. But, If you think
that arbitrary amount of white-space characters (including empty
lines) can be inserted between each pieces of xref data and xref
subsections, as oppose to current implementation, you need to do
more works to be consistent.

On Linux, ghostscript can do it. pdftocairo from poppler-utls can do
it, convert from imagemagick can do it.

Ah OK, so not part of TeX Live.

But, strange nevertheless: on my Linux box (Mageia 5):

  ?????
  ? $ rpm -ql xpdf                
  ? /usr/bin/xpdf
  ? /usr/share/applications/xpdf.desktop
  ? /usr/share/icons/large/xpdf.png

TeX Live does not include software which is available in Linux.

None of them are available on Windows?

And I guess `pdftopng' is a handy wrapper.

The original xpdf stuff has been superseded by the poppler fork. On
my ubuntu, xpdf now uses the poppler libraries. I guess pdftocairo
is an expanded version of the original pdftopng/pdftoppm.

If I remember correctly, there is both a xpdf and an xpdf-tools on Linux (Ubuntu), perhaps it is in the later. Otherwise just search for it.

This one exist in miktex too. But it doesn't know the -png switch,
only a -jpeg.

In texlive (windows) pdftoppm exist too, but another version, and it
doesn't know the -jpeg switch.

Yes, but xpdf's developer also provides binary packages for all the xpdf
utilities (although not xpdf itself, which is Unix only) for Windows.

See

http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html

under "Precompiled binaries"

: x86, Windows -- pdftops, pdftotext, pdftohtml, pdftoppm, pdftopng,
: pdfimages, pdfinfo, pdffonts, and pdfdetach only:
: xpdfbin-win-3.04.zip (includes 32-bit and 64-bit binaries) (10794993 bytes) 
: ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdfbin-win-3.04.zip


That should provide Ulrike a way to easily get pdftopng under Windows.

TeX Live provides a hidden Ghostscript for Windows.  It's visible to
scripts in the TEXMF tree and is supposed to support scripts shipped
with TeX Live.  In order to minimize network traffic it's only a
subset of the official distribution, see

  tlpkg/tlgs/README.TEXLIVE

How to install your own scripts is explained in

  bin/win32/runscript.tlu

The drawback is that you need wrappers (Windows) and symlinks (Unix)
in texlive/YYYY/bin/<platform> and thus have to install everything
again when YYYY changes.  What I usually do in such cases is to create
a TDS compliant directory structure somewhere else, put all files and
symlinks there, and create a zip file which can be extracted in
texlive/YYYY.

If you just want to use Ghostscript on the command line, there is a
program called "rungs".  Try

  rungs -help

On Windows it runs the hidden Ghostscript shipped with TeX Live, on
other systems the Ghostscript found in PATH.  I don't know much about
MacTeX but I suppose that it works there too, one way or another.
So you can try

  rungs -sDEVICE=png256 -sOutputFile=foo.png ...

on (hopefully) any platform.

However, don't try to use TeX Live's Ghostscript as a printer driver.
This is not supported.  But everything else should work.  If not, let
me know.  See also

   http://www.ghostscript.com/Documentation.html

  Reinhard

The problem is not so much to "somehow get" pdftopng (actually it
seems to work if one uses the version from w32tex.org along with the
kpathsea dll) or pdftocairo (which sounds interesting) too, but what
is the best source for a tex distribuation like miktex. Maintaining
a tex system is a lot work and I don't want to make it more
difficult than necessary.

One option is to forget about the xpdf- or poppler utilities and
instead write a very small C program which calls Miktex Ghostscript
with suitable parameters.

Actually, the poppler libraries are already part of the MiKTeX
source. But looking, at the source tree, I get the impression that
TeX Live gets its xpdf utilities directly from the original foolabs
xpdf sources.

Dear all,

Do you mean that, for example, "x ref" or "xre\0f" should be also 
accepted? Otherwise, I think mfgets works.

You want to check that the data is valid?

Could you tell me what extracbb should do? Currently (if I'm not 
mistaken), with my patch, extractbb allows

* empty line (a line containing only spaces and comments.)
* comment or spaces after xref entry and "xref"
* spaces before "xref" or "trailer"
* spaces before and after <first> <size> and comments after it

and it may (not always) give warning if it is not like this.

Hi,

> accepted? Otherwise, I think mfgets works.

No, both "x ref" and "xre\0f" are invalid.

mfgets() is supposed to return a pointer to null-terminated byte strings so
it should not be used for reading data which can contain null characters
within that.

Consider the following example,

xref
\0?0 2
0000000000 00001 f
0000000032 00000 n
2 1 foo
0000000182 00000 n
3 1\0bar
0000000322 00000 n
4\01
0000001236 00000 n

The first subsection is valid, the second subsection is not, and the
third is not valid too. The last one is subtle. (I think it is invalid but
if you want to treat null characters just like spaces it might be valid)

I think the proposed patch won't treat all cases properly.


Thanks,

Shunsaku Hirata

Windows?

Strange - no idea what kind of error that might be.

I cannot find these strings anywhere, seems there are some hidden
control sequences embedded somewhere?

Ahhhh ... I guess I know what it is ...

Can one of you please *edit*
	tlpkg/TeXLive/TLDownload.pm
at line 124 and add
	print STDERR "outfn = $outfn\n"
just above the "eval ..." line.

After that, please run again and send me the output.

Dear all,

I see. Now my question is

* should extractbb strictly reject an unexpected input?

I think Hirata-san's answer is "yes". If the answer is "yes", then I 
agree with that we can't use mfgets. But the current extractbb (without 
my patch) accepts an unexpected input.
This is a problem of the policy of dvipdfmx.

Perhaps I did something wrong. Now I get

C:\>tlmgr update --list
syntax error at C:/Programme/texlive/2015/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLDownload.pm line 125, near "eval "

The region around line 124 looks like this:

    ($outfh, $outfn) = tempfile();
    print STDERR "outfn = $outfn\n"

As I thought ... but I cannot reproduce it here on linux
even with \ embedded. Strange.

Can you try the following: Instead of the eval "END line .. insert:

	eval "END { unlink(\'$outfn\') if (-r \'$outfn\') ; }";

So the escaped " are changed to '

Then rerun tests, please ...

Thanks

Looks good! The "Unrecognized escapes" disappeared:

Can you also check whether the above file still exists or has
been removed? Should be

	Dokumente und Einstellungen\siart\Lokale was auch immer\Temp\...

Please try whether you can locate this directory, and if yes, 
the file.

Thanks

I'm not the one who decides if the patch is to be accepted.
I am just commenting on it as a person who is listed as an author of dvipdfmx.

I don't know what you are going to say.

However, maybe I should clarify some of  my point and opinion.

The first one is that with mfgets dvipdfmx fails to read input which should
now be considered as valid input.

As for the part related to detecting errors in input, I think, the purpose of
detecting errors is to let dvipdfmx give up reading data as early as possible
when input file is not considered as a PDF file or is a broken PDF.  Dvipdfmx
should do what it can do for that.


Could you explain about "the policy of dvipdfmx"?

It still exists. I think, they have never been deleted in the past
because there are lots of such files in that temp dir. Each 48 bytes in
size.

Hi Uwe,

Hmmm, just to be sure: please remove all those same sized files, then try again and see whether the files remain.

> I think, they have never been deleted in the past

Yes indeed, that was what the recent changes tried to fix. For unix it worked, but Windows is strange.

Going back to my Windows installation and trying it myself there ....

Bummer. Thanks for testing. I need to check with the shipped version
of perl we are using. Something seems to be wrong ...

But I think the current extractbb doesn't do that...

Anyway, I added some checking for inputs. The alternative of scanf("%u %
u") is really ugly... I hope someone will make a better one.

If you think that one is good, please include it.

This may or may not have anything to do with the problem, but
Windows file locking can be very persistent for no apparent reason.

But in the past Perl always issued an error message when a file
couldn't be created and I would expect one if a file can't be removed.

Uwe, testing with admin permissions shouldn't be necessary because the
temporary files supposed to be deleted were created by the same
process, either with admin or user permissions.  Furthermore, names of
temporary files are only known within the process which created them.
Hence tlmgr cannot remove temporary files from former runs.

Regards,
  Reinhard

To all suffering from this:

Please wait a few more days, we will push out a new update fixing
this in short time (2 days is my guess).

For those who want to fix it by themselves:

open tlpkg/TeXLive/TLDownload.pm with an editor and
  . remove around line 123 the following line:
	eval "END { unlink(\"$outfn\") if (-r \"$outfn\") ; }";
and if you want to get the full change
  . replace the ($outfh, $outfn) = tempfile(); line with
	($outfh, $outfn) = tempfile(UNLINK => 1);
    (i.e., add UNLINK => 1 between the round parenthesis

The first one is the problematic issuing the error messages.
The second is the correct fix which will first go to tlcritical
for one day, and after testing from my side (also on Windows)
it will be shipped out.

Sorry for the inconveniences

Norbert

Hello, Shunsaku,

>> This is a problem of the policy of dvipdfmx.

I think that abenori-san would like to say
"This is a matter of DVIPDFMx's policy".  Since abenori-san
(and some of the readers including me) does not know the
policy exactly, we need to hear it or make some conclusion in this time.

Best,
  Yusuke.

Ah, I understand. Well, whenever I think that a particular problem could
be concerned with file permissions I'm very suspicious of Windows, so I
gave it a try. But you're right, here it is just about creating and
deleting a file by the same process. That should be within the realms of
possibility even on Windows.

Looks fine for me. No (apparent) runtime problems, no temp files left
behind.

All programs we distribute should be robust against bad input files,
including stray nulls and other such things.  This doesn't necessarily
mean rejecting all possible bad input, but it does mean they shouldn't
crash.  A crash means it is a potential (though unlikely) attack vector
for bad guys.

I don't think this necessarily means never using scanf.  It does mean
avoiding anything where the input can be overrun, such as gets() (just
the common example, I know that is not being used here; I don't know
about mfgets).

This is not extractbb/dvipdfmx-specific.

Does that help/clarify/make sense?

Or disk space/quota?

Anyhow, because so much did get installed correctly, it can hardly be
a permissions problem.

TeX Live does not require any special permissions. The user installing TL
must have rights to write to the installation directory. If symlinks are
required, the user must have rights to create symlinks in /usr/local/bin.
That's all.

Subject: [tex-live] TeX (eplain) error in updates applied 10 Jan
Message-ID: <5693C28E.9000609@gmail.com>

I hope this is a useful place to report an error.
I updated my 2015 version on 20 December 2015 and everything
ran fine. Then I did the same update on 10Jan 2016 and found that
when I used a  TeX script which had an \input eplain in it, I got:

pdftex    bib_all
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX Live 2015) 
(preloaded format=pdftex)

==========================
After  running tlmgr restore every thing was normal again.
The eplain_head.tex script referenced above contains:

Sorry about that I'll update CTAN in a minute but if you find the commented
block for the 2.5 change, change it to say

% 2.5 define the global allocation to be the standard ones
% as extended allocation is already in use. Helps with
% compatibility with some packages that use these commands
% after loading etex.
% 2.6 avoid error from outer if used with (e)plain
\expandafter\let\csname globcount\expandafter\endcsname
                \csname newcount\endcsname
\expandafter\let\csname globdimen\expandafter\endcsname
                \csname newdimen\endcsname
\expandafter\let\csname globskip\expandafter\endcsname
                \csname newskip\endcsname
\expandafter\let\csname globmuskip\expandafter\endcsname
                \csname newmuskip\endcsname
\expandafter\let\csname globtoks\expandafter\endcsname
                \csname newtoks\endcsname
\expandafter\let\csname globmarks\expandafter\endcsname
                \csname newmarks\endcsname
% end of 2.5/2.6 change

Message-ID: <201601112244.u0BMiVgf000961@freefriends.org>

    i found the script hard code about line 1216 /usr/local/textlive.

It is not hard-coded.  The operator on that line is ||=.

  $tex_prefix ||= '/usr/local/texlive';

Thus, as seen a half-dozen lines above, you can override that default
with the TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX environment variable.  (Also, everything
that depends on $tex_prefix should be separately definable, at least
that was the intent.)

Also, the string "/usr/local" does not appear in
http://pastebin.com/qTJ4umgi as far as my search can see, so I don't
understand.  I can't guess why the "untarring" of amstex failed.

Finally, you might look at .../2015/install-tl.log, if you haven't
already solved it.  (Seems like we should report that path when we say
"Installation failed".  It would also be nice if all the lines written
to the terminal went to the log.  Maybe one day.)

Good luck,
Karl

Not as far as I can see.  It's a normal package, part of

Don't know, sorry.  Maybe others can come up with a guess.  -k

I now have checked with three different servers. Since I myself didnot
interfere with the installation, can I get the package otherwise?

I can confirm that if you have a full installation of TL15, package
'proofread' is part of it. Perhaps your installation is incomplete on
some points.

This is what you could try next:

  tlmgr update --reinstall-forcibly-removed --all

  tlmgr install --reinstall proofread

  tlmgr install --reinstall collection-latexextra

The latter might take a while because it will reinstall all packages
that are assigned to collection-latexextra

Message-ID: <569D1E7D.3050606@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Dear All,

Is there a date for the first binary building for TeXLive 2016?

I'm planning to upload Gregorio[0] on CTAN but I'd like to know when it
will be best (Gregorio is under very active development).

Also, I'd really like the command "gregorio" to be in the default
"shell_escape_commands", there has been some reviews by Peter a few
month ago, and a small one by Karl a few weeks ago, but it seems there
are still some things to review. The problem is that I don't really know
what is considered a good level of security. I've opened an issue on the
tracker of Gregorio about it[1], feel free to put some comments. If some
of you can give advises on how to improve security in the C code[2] in
order to allow gregorio in shell_escape_commands, that would be most
welcome!

Thank you,

Elie

    Is there a date for the first binary building for TeXLive 2016?

March 4.  I posted the usual tentative schedule on tug.org/texlive a few
days ago.  Basically the same as last year.

    I'm planning to upload Gregorio[0] on CTAN but I'd like to know when
    it will be best

Well, since gregorio is already in the TL sources (thanks to Akira and
Peter), any time is fine.

When you have something ready, let me know in advance before you upload
it anywhere and I will take a look.  Hopefully the code will be
basically stable at that point.

    Also, I'd really like the command "gregorio" to be in the default
    "shell_escape_commands", 

Yes, known.

Currently pdftexconfig.tex sets \pdfdecimaldigits=3

and Joseph's suggested luatex 0.85+-aware config setup copied that setting

As I note in a question to luatex list

http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2016-January/005601.html

this currently makes every plain and latex document issue a warning with
luatex 0.87+


warning  (pdf backend): forcing decimal digits to 4



I've asked in the above mail if luatex could allow a setting of 3 but if not
is there any problem with setting this to 4 generally so luatex and pdftex
share settings?

In other words was there a particular reason to choose 3....

Message-ID: <CAEW6iOiXGqgbOR9s6-B777rTXRp632BYkgf5kfmEVEXHtJA9yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

as you probably know luatex 0.87 changes "a few things"  I just submitted
to ctan a luatex.def file derived from pdftex.def but avoiding all the
\pdfxxx commands that are no longer defined.

This is usable already with color/graphics via an explicit option such as

\usepackage[luatex]{color}

as the default action for unknown options is to look for a .def file of
that name, however the next release of the graphics bundle will include
"declared" luatex option to match dvips, pdftex, luatex options.

It would be helpful if the color and graphics .cfg  files defaulted this
option if used with a new luatex.

For reasons I don't fully understand the .cfg files aren't on ctan but
directly in th etexlove sources so I'm attaching some possible versions to
this message (for texlive and BCC'd to Christian for miktex information)
they should detect luatex and then set up luatex or pdftex options
depending on \luatexversion.

The cfg files and luatex.def are also in github at

https://github.com/davidcarlisle/luatex-def

(luatex.def under LPPL, same as pdftex.def, color.cfg and graphics.cfg
under whatever approximation to public domain makes sense in your
location:-)

Although this isn't really needed until tl2016 it might be good if they
could be pushed into tl2015 so that anyone who is testing a luatex 0.88
binary in a texlive 2015 tree will have a chance of graphics working by
default. But your choice, something like will be needed for the texlive
2016 test releases anyway, so sending now.

[other parts of latex support for luatex 0.85+ will be in the next update
of latex, hopefully end of this month, updated ltluatex.lua in base,
updated graphics and color in graphics and a new package for shell escape
(\write18) in tools. Also updated .ini files as proposed by Joseph already
on this list]

thanks

Not that I know of, but then I probably wouldn't know.  (Ross, Thanh?)

However, in any case ... changing it at this late date would mean, I
think, that most PDF output from pdftex would be gratuitiously different
from what was produced before.  That doesn't sound like a good outcome.
On the badness scale, I'd say that's rather worse than not being able to

a reply giving any rationale for
why the change was needed, given the small amount of calculation in a pdf
file it seems
surprising that 4dp is really needed and just makes the file bigger.
perhaps luatex will revert to allowing 3.....

AFAIR Hartmut Henkel investigated a decade ago and came to the
conclusion that more than 3 decimal digits don't make sense.

As far as the backend is concerned, it sounds reasonable.  PDF's unit
is a "big point", and with \pdfdecimaldigits=3 the resolution in the
PDF file is about 0.3?m.  This should be sufficient in most cases.
If it's not sufficient in a particular case, the configuragtion can be
changed. 

Hans said that many transformations are involved.  Sure, if too many
"cm" ("concat" in PostScript) operations are written to the PDF file,
rounding errors add up.

Hans distinguishes between LuaTeX internals and the (PDF) backend.

So what does \pdfdecimaldigits actually control?  Since LuaTeX is
written in C I would expect that numbers are either floats, doubles,
or integers internally and numbers are represented with a reasonable
resolution.

Does \pdfdecimaldigits really control how numbers are processed in the
innards of LuaTeX?  That would be strange.

If \pdfdecimaldigits only controls how numbers are represented in a
PDF file, I don't see any reason to overwrite settings read from the
config file and I still don't understand why a setup for pdftex isn't
appropriate for luatex.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Re graphics.cfg: why did you remove the special hack at the end that

That stuff has been there since day one, so I'm loath to remove it now.
Unless you want to change LaTeX's dvips.def in this regard ...

Possibly, or more exactly for these cfg it could have been my idea, it's

Thanks for reminding me: I _have_ changed dvips, also I changed trig to use
"0" and "1" rather than the unexpandable  "\z@` and "\@ne" so that
luatex.def
doesn't have to patch it (nor pdftex.def but I didn't change that)

Note also that the big conditional block of code for eps to pdf conversion
I put in
luatex.def (which seems the more natural place) if it was in pdftex.def
rather than
in a pdftex-conditional block in graphics.cfg then graphics.cfg would look
a lot simpler
(the same as color.cfg, essentially) but I left that for now.

The updated dvips.def and trig.sty are in the latex svn and we are
targeting a
release for 1st feb (latex2e 2016/01/01) so these cfg need to wait until
then,
sorry about that.

change log in graphics svn says:

2016-01-03  David Carlisle  <latex-bugs at latex-project.org>

    * graphics.dtx, color.dtx: add luatex option. (luatex.def to be
    distributed separately.)

    * trig.dtx: make pre-calculated trig values expand to digits
    rather than use \chardef

2015-12-30  David Carlisle  <latex-bugs at latex-project.org>

    * drivers.dtx: dvips can deal natively with compressed eps
    (was in texlive's graphics.cfg)

I think it is generally a good idea to have local .cfg files and find their
meaning in the local guide. Its implementation is straightforward. If there
is a need for such a local .cfg file, it can be placed in texmf-local which
is searched first. If it is not found there, the default .cfg will be read
from texmf-dist. Thus it will work for both kinds of users.

Yes, sure it's just that (as now) when changes are suggested in the default
version it's not so clear where to go, for texlive I can mail here, I
BCC'ed Christian as a heads up for miktex but other distributions it's not
so clear what they do.

if we put them also on  ctan as we do for the .def files then there would
be a canonical place for them. (same true of .ini files for format creation
actually)

\pdfdecimaldigits=3 ?was a decision that makes sense for most cases. A
larger value
results in bigger pdf output without visible change to human eyes.

When outputting a dimen to PDF, ?pdftex rounds the value represented in
scaled
point by tex to a real number in PDF, and
?
 \pdfdecimaldigits says how
many digits can be after the the decimal point. The differences between the
outputted value in PDF  and the desired value (in scaled point) are
tracked, in order
to minimize the accumulation of rounding errors.

Example (roughly):

- pdftex needs to move the pen to the right by 123456 sp

- convert to bp: 123456 sp = (123456/65536)*(7200/7227) =
1.87675124533001245328

- \?pdfdecimaldigits??=3 => outputted value: 1.877

- pdftex takes into account that the pen was moved to the right by
  1.877bp = 1.877*(7227/7200)*65536 = 123472.36352 = 123472 sp

- the difference (123456 - 123472) will be considered when  the next pen
movement comes

Thanks for the confirmations.

For those not following the luatex list, Akira and Hans have adjusted
things so in the next (after 0.88) release of luatex, 3 will again be an
allowed value, so I think that the plan is to keep that as the default for
luatex and pdftex in the format initialisation.

Subject: [tex-live] 1 byte Buffer Overflow in writet1.c / t1_builtin_enc()
Message-ID: <20160122104320.78e0941e@pc1>

Hi,

By testing pdflatex with address sanitizer I discovered a buffer
overflow in the code in writet1.c in the function t1_builtin_enc().

It is in this line:
            if (sscanf(p, "dup %i%256s put", &i, t1_buf_array) == 2 &&

The problem is that t1_buf_array is exactly 256 bytes, that means it
can only hold a string of 255 bytes because of the zero-terminator byte
of the string.

I didn't easily find out where t1_buf_array gets allocated, but I think
changing this from %256s to %255s should fix the issue.

I find the structure of the tex-projects a bit confusing, so I'm not
entirely sure if this is the right place to report this. This file
appears twice in the texlive source I have here:
./texk/web2c/pdftexdir/writet1.c
./texk/dvipsk/writet1.c
and almost identical code appears here:
./texk/web2c/luatexdir/font/writet1.w

The code that gets triggered when running pdflatex (on a random,
trivial tex input file) is the one in pdftexdir. But I assume this
should be fixed in all instances where this code appears.

Attached is a patch.


This is the error message from Address Sanitizer:

Shouldn't the file identifies itself as

  \ProvidesFile{luatex.def}[2015/12/30 v0.01a Graphics/color for LuaTeX]

instead of

  \ProvidesFile{luatex.def}[2015/12/30 v0.01a Graphics/color for pdfTeX]

?

Oops yes thanks!


I should mention that we decided to move the github repo to the latex 3
project so
I'll update that and ctan then delete that davidcarlisle/luatex-def
<https://github.com/davidcarlisle/luatex-def>  repo and further
 development is as

https://github.com/latex3/luatex-def

Message-ID: <580F1B96-2093-4C75-A7B3-A1BB0405FA40@posteo.ch>

Hello

I have found a wrong behaviour of grffile (oberdiek) with lualatex (MacTeX 2015) on OS X 10.11.3 (El Capitan).  The minimal example is:

`
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{luatextra}
\usepackage[british]{babel}
\usepackage[babel]{csquotes}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[unicode, citecolor=blue, linkcolor=black, urlcolor=blue, colorlinks=true, bookmarksopen]{hyperref}%teal
\usepackage[multidot=true, babel=true, extendedchars=true, space=true]{grffile}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{Img here/My image.pdf}
\end{document}
`

Folder `Img here` contains file `My image.pdf` with a picture.  However, when trying to compile it with lualatex it complains:

`! Package pdftex.def Error: File `Img here/My image.pdf' not found.`

The example worked with MacTeX 2015 on OS X 10.10.X (Yosemite), and it also works with MacTeX 2014 on 10.11.3 (currently running the downgraded version).

Howdy,

I doubt this has anything to do with the version of OS X. I get the error when compiling with lualatex on both OS X 10.10.x or OS X 10.11.x. It does compile with TeX Live 2014 (via MacTeX-2014). It also compiles with TeX Live 2015 (via MacTeX-2015)if I compile with pdflatex (removing the loading of luatextra, of course). I conclude that the problem is with the version of luatex that comes with TeX Live 2015 and would guess it is a problem on TeX Live 2015 on other systems (unless it's a problem with compiling under OS X).

Good Luck,

Online search for the given error just returns the TLUtils.pm script.
The same problem happened to a colleague of mine, so it seems not to be 
a problem of my machine. We are behind a proxy, which should be 
configured fine since the package loading worked. If I can give any 
other information so you could point me at a solution, I'll happily 
provide them.

Any help is highly appreciated,

Arno

Hi Arno,

that looks like an old installer! How do you install, ie, from which installer package?

Hi Norbert,

thanks for the quick reply. Indeed, the old installer was the problem. I downloaded that once but did not use it at that time, then forgot about it and now just used it without considering to get a new one. (We do not use that machine too often)
However, as my colleague tried the installation, I think she had a fresh installer. That's why I did not try with a new one for me since I thought it should be the same error.

Anyways, problem solved,
thanks again,

best,
Arno

Subject: [tex-live] [PATCH] CWEB+XDvi (1/2): support for source specials
Message-ID: <13828.1454170439@frotz.progn.net>

Hello TeX Live,

The attached modifies web2c's change file for cweave.w so that the the
woven intermediate .tex files contain a new notation for filenames and
line numbers at the beginnings of sections, and modifies cwebmac.tex to
recognize the new notation, all in order to include filenames and line
numbers in source specials in the .dvi for XDvi's forward and reverse
search features.

Would the web2c maintainers please let me know how such a feature
(either this implementation, or another) might get included?

Compatibility note: I've made the new feature default to off in both
cweave and cwebmac, but that's just for upward compatibility for the
improbable(?) case of someone using a cweave with my change and a
cwebmac without it. (The converse should work fine, however.) I don't
know what this project's policies are around upward compatibility of
individual pieces; if policy is that programs and dependencies will
always be found with the appropriate corresponding versions, then it
should be harmless to have this feature default to on in cweave (but not
in cwebmac, as there are third party programs that use cwebmac).

(Additionally, I should note that by inspection, simply inserting source
specials just before or just after the \N command sequence didn't work
very well for XDvi's forward and reverse search features: sometimes the
source special would end up on the wrong page, for example. This is why
I thought it necessary to modify the CWEB TeX macros the way I have.)

Finally, I've been using git-svn to track Build/source. If someone needs
this patch formatted differently for inclusion, please let me know.

Thank you,
Richard

Subject: [tex-live] [PATCH] CWEB+XDvi (2/2): reorganize PDF code & add
	hypertex support
Message-ID: <14179.1454172452@frotz.progn.net>

Hello TeX Live,

I wanted to get clickable navigation links in the woven output of cweave
under XDvi (via hypertex specials, which XDvi recognizes), and this
turned out to involve a bit of rejiggering of the PDF support in cwebmac.
Toward that end, the attached modifies cwebmac in 4 ways, mostly to move
around the time at which the PDF macros are defined and expanded:

(1) Hoist all the PDF-specific command sequences upwards in the file and
hide them behind a layer of indirection (mostly to support items (2) and
(4) following).

(2) Define all the PDF command sequences unconditionally during the
input of cwebmac, but only execute them when \ifacro is true inside the
indirection layer from item (1).

(3) Add some PDF-specfic command sequences for destinations and links by
page number for the table of contents. (This isn't really related to my
goals, but I was touching this stuff anyway.)

(4) add a branch in the destination and link command sequences of the
indirection layer from item (1) to emit HyperTeX specials when \ifacro
is false and \ifhypertex is true, for clickable navigation links in the
DVI under XDvi.

I believe all of the above is compatible with the current default
behavior of cwebmac.tex. However, with the attached changes, the user
can put

\hypertextrue 

in the limbo text at the top of the main .w file in order to get
clickable navigation links for XDvi when cwebmac line 9 is commented.
(When cwebmac:9 is uncommented, the PDF specials take
precedent. Additionally, by delaying the \ifacro usage as this changeset
does, the user who wants PDF goodies via tex+dvipdfm(x) can put

\acrotrue

in the limbo text rather than uncommenting cwebmac:9.)

Would the web2c maintainers please let me know how such a feature
(either this implementation, or another) might get included?

(Note: this change conflicts slightly with the change I've submitted in
a previous message to add source specials to the woven DVI, so I'm also
attaching a patch that combines this message's content with that one's.)

Finally, I've been using git-svn to track Build/source. If someone needs
either of these patches formatted differently for inclusion, please let
me know.

Thank you,
Richard

Subject: [tex-live] [PATCH] Add action to XDvi for user-defined subprocesses
Message-ID: <15091.1454183268@frotz.progn.net>

Hello TeX Live,

Attached is a patch that adds a new action to XDvi, called user-exec,
that runs a subprocess with the current DVI file's pathname stored in
the environment variable XDVI_PATH.

I use this action for a somewhat complicated purpose having to do with
CWEB, but the action itself is generic. As a digestible hypothetical
example of its use:

-- ~/.Xdefaults --
xdvi.mainTranslations:#override\
  <Key>m:user-exec(xdvi-remake)
--

-- ~/bin/xdvi-remake --
cd ${XDVI_FILE%/*} && make ${XDVI_FILE##*/}
--

Note: I've been working on this change using the xdvik in the texlive
source tree, so the attached patch is against that. I'm a bit unclear
about the status of the upstream/upstreams(?) at SourceForge. If it's
preferable to submit changes there for eventual re-inclusion in TeX
Live, I can do that.

Finally, I've been using git-svn to track Build/source. If someone needs
this patch formatted differently for inclusion, please let me know.

Thank you,
Richard

In principle Paul applies things upstream and we sync from him in TL,

Thanks a lot. Fixed in r39517.
The font "Sampige.ttf" seems not to support to get_glyphname.
After the fix, your example gives an attached "testsampige.pdf"
with a warning
No Unicode mapping available: GID=164

Akira

Thank you, Karl.

In case it matters, for the other patch, most of it is just reorganizing
the command sequences that produce internal links in the PDF so that
they've all always got names; this way, even if the HyperTeX code were
left out or some other set of special effects should be supported
instead of PDF or HyperTeX, the user could redefine those names to get
the desired results. (As the code is currently laid out, some things
have names but the names are conditionally defined, and other things
don't have names but are conditionally expanded, so it wasn't possible
to just redefine things that were already there.)

Anyway, if desired, I'd be happy to produce a sequence of discrete
changes leading up to the results, if that'd make things more
digestible.

Thank you,
Richard

The fix looks legit to me, Sampige.ttf doesn't have valid psName
entries according to its post table dump from ttx (see attachment).

Werner, what's the expected behavior here? Does read_v2_post_names()
in dvipdfm-x need improvement?

Please follow groff's `preconv' manpage to add a proper emacs-like
encoding tag to the `mendex.1' manpage and probably other non-ASCII or
non-UTF8 manpages of TeXLive, e.g.

  .\" -*- mode: troff; coding: euc-jp -*-

While this doesn't ensure proper formatting with a non-Japanese groff
version, it makes the man page readable with recent versions of groff
within a standard UTF-8 terminal, e.g.

  groff -k -Tutf8 -mja -man mendex.1 | less

(`-k' activates auto-conversion of encodings, `-Tutf8' sets a UTF-8
terminal as the output device, `-mja' activates rudimentary Japanese
support, and `-man' loads the macros for manpage formatting.)

Thanks for the quick fix!  BTW, who is managing the bug tracker?  I
think it should now be set to `resolved' (or at least to `confirmed'
or `in progress', or something similar).

This warning message is not clear to me.  What *exactly* does it mean?
Let's assume there are valid PS glyph names in the font's `post' table
? such PS glyph names can still be arbitrary, without the possibility
to derive Unicode representations.

Indeed, this is a bug in the font.  It seems to be an old,
unmaintained one (the link given in the font itself no longer works),
which is a pity, since (a) it is probably one of the most used fonts
for the Kannada script in the GNU/Linux world due to being part of the
standard bundle of Indic TrueType fonts, and (b) it is quite beautiful
also.

The fix in the font is very easy to do (namely to change the `post'
table to format 3, to get rid of all PS glyph names) ? any Indic users
on the list who could find out whether there is a canonical site
and/or a maintainer to whom this could be reported?

I'm not acquainted with the code, but you are on the safe side if
empty PS glyph names are completely ignored (since valid PS glyph
names are never empty).  It seems this is what the code does now.

Thanks a lot. I asked that the author.

Best,
