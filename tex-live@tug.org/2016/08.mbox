please do not place the PATH change in .bashrc

then if you start your editor from, say a menu, then it will never find LaTeX from the PATH as it is not running a bash shell.

.profile is a better choice.

On a system which has never before had TeX installed, that directory
will not be in the PATH.  Try
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/i386-linux"

If your shell is bash, put that in ~/.bashrc (and remember to change
it when you upgrade to 2017 next year ;-).

If your shell is NOT bash, perhaps you can set the PATH in
~/.profile.  Or maybe ubuntu will source that in ~/.bashrc.

I've not heard of that problem, perhaps you downloaded it to a
filesystem mounted with 'noexec' in its options.  Check where you
downloaded it to, then run 'mount' and check what it tells you.

In the instructions for how to Integrate vanilla TeX Live with Debian 
(on this page: http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html), the last command 
in step 4 is phrased for TL2015, not TL2016.  While it's easy enough to 
fix once you look at it and realize what's going on, it should probably 
be updated.

Also, it might be advisable to add a note near the links for the older 
releases mentioning the need to change the year in that last line to 
match the release you're trying to register.

Subject: [tex-live] dropped fontspec dependency ?
Message-ID: <58EBD1A9-1BAB-49DF-8044-842DFEFCB7FA@free.fr>

Hi,

during Summer I update software only about once a month, having
rare periodes of internet access

today I was surprised that updating texlive resulted in dropping
fontspec, polyglossia, unicode-math...

I surmise something has been changed into dependencies of latex-recommended
or like collections.

I don't have time to compare to earlier status to figure out quickly 
which collection to now additionally enable if I do want to be able
to use fontspec+lualatex/xelatex. Can you help telling me?

[edit by myself:] seems what I want is collection-unicodetex.

my status is
$ tlmgr info collections

As you can see, this year for some reason I did not install the full TeX-Live.

Today's update produced log containing this: (I was using on Mac OS the TeX Live Utility whose latest version 1.26 I wanted to check, rather than command line tlmgr)

Ok, self-answering, I see I need to add collection-unicodetex.

Has this been discussed somewhere ? I see no thread -- oh sorry I found this just now

Well, sorry for noise, but doing it nevertheless to make worthwhile my investigation ;-)

Karl, indeed, we need
	collection-xetex
	collection-luatex
and maybe
	collection-latexrecommended
to depend on 
	collection-unicodetex

I did add dependecies from c-xetex and c-luatex on c-unicodetex
for the Debian packages, but I think that should actually be in
the original collections.

All the best

I thought about that, but if we add those engine dependencies, then
anyone installing those packages would end up with both xe(la)tex and
lua(la)tex.  But many people only use one or the other.  So that did not
seem right.

As for latexrecommended, that should not be necessary, if it is, maybe
more things should be rearranged.  Maybe c-latex since all the
unicodetex packages are in fact latex right now, and that's not likely
to change and I can't see that it matters since any installation that
cares about c-unicodetex will already have c-latex.

Sigh.  -k

P.S. Belated idea: maybe it would be better to forget the new collection
and just add all those packages to c-latexrecommended.  Although they
are useless for people not using xe/luatex, the total size is small, and
I don't see it getting much bigger.

Also, it seems to be the 53rd item in the C install-tl menu :(.  -k

I don't see why? Someone installing
	collection-xetex
would get
	collection-unicodetex
but *not* collection-luatex.

Readng you other text I think you reversed the dependency. I want to
have
	name collection-xetex
	depend collection-unicodetex
...

> As for latexrecommended, that should not be necessary, if it is, maybe

Hmm, I am quite sure that *several* packages in colelction-latexrecommended
depend on packages in unicodetex.

Fine with me ... They are not o big indeed.

The new biblatex-abnt package release was installed with error. The

The correct place as cited on package readme may be

Hello

I have used dvips from TeX Live 2016 on the attached DVI file. I get
in the (attached) postscript file:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0

%%PageOrder: Ascend

But PageOrder is a comment introduced in Postscript DSC 3.0 and is not
present in 2.0

Is it a bug in dvips ?

thank you

Seems so.  Is PageOrder the only DSC introduced in Version 3.0 which
dvips can insert?  And which values are supported?

If no other values than Ascend are supported, it's certainly better to
drop the DSC rather than to change the shebang line.  All programs
assume an ascending order by default.

I assume that TeX always creates pages in ascending order.  Hyperref
supports semitic languages too, where right pages have even numbers
and left pages have odd numbers.  But it assumes that pages in the pdf
file are in ascending order and just tells PDF viewers and printers
how to position facing pages.

IMO the DSC is superfluous and can be removed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

%%PageOrder: Descend
and
%%PageOrder: Ascend

For the former, try
dvips -r1 test.dvi
(reverse the order of the output).

I know Tom likes
%!PS-Adobe-2.0
and
%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-2.0 (for epsf)
to support old printers.

Nowadays I myself think that
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
and
%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0 (for epsf)
may be ok.

Best,
Akira

Perfect.

Sounds reasonable - and preferrable - math is science, right? ;-)

But I only want to say: The *size* itself is irrelevant - it would
be more interesting to compare the number of included CTAN packages.
Som ehave huge data sets or loads of pdfs that increase the size,
but do not actually provide "content".

All the best

What is important for old printers is the PostScript Level, not DSC
version. Printers interpret the code and treat DSC as comments. DSC is
important for software toos so that they can extract specific pages
without the need to understand PS. If I remember the specification
well, such tools should ignore all DSC which they do not understand.
This make the tools both upwards and downwards compatible.

    But PageOrder is a comment introduced in Postscript DSC 3.0 and is not
    present in 2.0

Ok, but is this actually causing a problem?  I don't recall any report
ever about the presence of %%PageOrder, despite the non-conformance.
I would think it would have come up by now.

Anyway, if we're going to make a change, I'd rather remove the comment
than switch to 3.0.  That seems to have less potential for useless
disruption to me.  From what I can tell from the spec
(https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf),
the primary purpose of %%PageOrder is for documents with interdependent
pages.  As far as I know, that's not the case for dvips; pages depend
only on the preamble.  So it "shouldn't" (ha) hurt to remove it.  -k

In order to understand the process of the rotating package, I read the

however I cannot find it in texlive 2016. I checked the documentation
and the directory of rotating.sty. There is also no subdirectory where
it might be hidden. The docu is from july 12 2016. Can you please help?

    [...]

i've taken a look at where rotating is
located in tex live 2012, and the doc
area (texmf-dist/doc/latex/rotating)
contains these four files:

  README
  cat.eps
  examples.tex
  rotating.pdf

on ctan, rotating now seems to be
included with the graphicx collection,
and indeed the examples file is absent.
the readme file there identifies a
file rotex.tex as examples of use of
the rotating package; quick inspection
of the contents indicates that the
files are essentially the same, and a
diff shows only "reasonable" changes.
(\includegraphics is used instead of
\epsfig, for example.)

perhaps there are still vestiges of
the old file names in the documentation.
although it has been updated.

(re tex live: there is now an empty
directory .../tex/latex/rotating
that is no longer needed.)

Using the rotex.tex file I could solve my problem, which was the wrong
direction of the rotation and the problem that the figure appeared not
on the next page possible but on a page at the end of the section
together with other figures. That has been solved.
Thank you very much

our installation is dated june 12,
so it was before your update.  okay,
that question answered.  must have
been a few days between updating
graphics and the removal, since all
the files associated with rotating
are certainly in the "right place".

thanks for the datestamp.

sorry if the rename caused confusion but "examples.tex"  seemed like a
rather over-generic name, so I renamed while merging in to the
graphics bundle.  However I see I left a line

rotating.dtx:% A set of examples is given in the file \texttt{examples.tex}


I'll fix that to say rotex.tex before the next release.

together with TeX Live comes the editor "TeXWorks".  I'm not sure, if it
is installed by default on Windows or if you have to select it, when
installing TeX Live.

Search for it in your program list.  Other editors, that are made
especially for TeX and Windows are for example TeXStudio, TeXmaker, or
TeXnicCenter.  Of course, you can also use the Windows Editor (notepad),
but it doesn't provide a lot of functionality that is useful for writing
TeX files.

I hope this helps for your start.

Regards,
  Stephan

Subject: [tex-live] luaotfload tries to recompile an existing .luc file
Message-ID: <CAN1usO3sA6r2ZSL41SsRDJU-mVeDt0aU0sEi0+Jke9tgiyWwPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Consider the following snippet:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\begin{document}
Test
\end{document}

Compiling with lualatex, one can read in the log file:

(compiling luc:
/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/fonts/otl/lmroman10-regular.luc)
(load luc: /home/christophe/.texlive2016/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/fonts/otl/lmroman10-regular.luc))

Note that I installed TeXLive with root privilege.

So luaotfload tries first to compile a .luc file in a directory
without write permission and then load the existing one in an other
directory. I think it should load directly the existing .luc file.

As I don't know if it is a TeXlive or a luaotfload issue, I created a
tracker issue: https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload/issues/375.

Note also that it was originally a question asked at tex.se:
http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/324564/8425

What do you think?

Thanks

The current value of TEXMFCACHE in
/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf
and
/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/web2c/texmfcnf.lua
is
TEXMFCACHE = $TEXMFSYSVAR;$TEXMFVAR

What happens if you set
TEXMFCACHE = $TEXMFVAR
in your own texmf.cnf and texmfcnf.lua
in, for example, /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/ ?

Best,
Akira

I can't imagine that this would be a reason.  Try to open TeXworks,
select "File" -> "Open" from its menu bar and select your TeX file.
Obviously, the file needs to be somewhere on your hard disk.

If that doesn't work, I unfortunately cannot help you, because I've not
used Windows for years and don't know, what current Windows does wrong
then.  Please consider to search for your problems with the search
engine of you choice (Google, Bing, ...).

>Could you recommend me some tool to check/clean/repair registry

I'm not sure that hacking the registry would help.  There might also be
a method the tell the Windows file manager to open *.tex files with
TeXworks, but I've no clue how it's done in current Windows versions.

And, as mentioned by Zdenek Wagner, please consider reading some manuals
and documentation, where everything is explained in a way it should
work.

Best,
  Stephan

See, for example,

      http://tug.org/begin.html

where there are links to good documentation, including a video.

I would advise you to post your questions in the TeXhax mailing list:

      http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

as it deals with general questions about the TeX world. texlive at tug.org 
is for problems specific to the TeXLive distribution, rather than how to 
use TeX and friends.

Axel

Dear Carles --

(1) Make sure you installed everything (I think this is referred to as "Collection: full" by the installer, but I may be wrong)
(2) Click Start / all programs / TeX Live 2016 / TeXworks  2016
(3) When TeXworks has launched, click File / Open and browse for "eq15.tex"

This works! Thank you!

So do you think it is a TeXLive bug?

    So do you think it is a TeXLive bug?

I don't believe so.

My (shallow) understanding of TEXMFCACHE is written in the comment just
before the definition:

% First writable tree here is used by Lua(La)TeX for the font cache.
..
TEXMFCACHE = $TEXMFSYSVAR;$TEXMFVAR

Therefore it is intentional that there is more than one tree.  I do not
know the details of what luaotfload is doing (differently), or what it
should do (differently).  I hope Philipp and the other maintainers can
figure it out in response to your bug report there.  Thank you for
submitting the report there.

If $TEXMFSYSVAR was removed from the list, that would eliminate the
possibility of a system-wide fontcache for lua(la)tex fonts.  That
doesn't especially make sense to me.

Best,
Karl

Dear Carles,

.tex is not a generally known extension. It is a plain gtext file yet it is
not guaranteed that it will always have a MIME type of text/plain. Even if
you have a specialized editor for TeX installed, it is possible that
association will not be found. On my Linux computer it is sometimes opened
in TeXmaker, sometimes it cannot be opend and I have to save it to my local
disk. Anyway, even if you manage to open it directly from the e-mail in
some IDE, the permission might not allow you to process the file. You
almost always have to save the file to your disk.

Thank you very much everyone for your interest.


I also consider some kind of incompatibility because I am not only able to open .tex files, but I can not open the editor when I click on the icon of TeXworks editor. When I click on the icon appears this error message (see attached photo, Windows 7 shows in Spanish that is not able to check the editor). Although I select to execute ("Ejecutar") the software, my Windows 7 Home Premium is not able to open it.


Perhaps I should try to install TeXstudio editor, for example.

(1) Make sure you installed everything (I think this is referred to as "Collection: full" by the installer, but I may be wrong)
(2) Click Start / all programs / TeX Live 2016 / TeXworks  2016
(3) When TeXworks has launched, click File / Open and browse for "eq15.tex"

Howdy,

The update to acro received this morning via tlmgr has a README that says it's version 2.6b but everything else, including acro.sty is 2.6a.

Good Luck,

I do not understand Spanish and I am not a Windows expert but it seems to

And would be answered with "Yes" by a typical Windows user ? without
hesitation. :)

I found on the internet a screenshot of TeXworks editor running on Windows 7 (see attached photo), so I should have no trouble with the operating system. I also disabled my Avast antivirus, but I am not able to open .tex files or TeXworks editor.


I don't know what to do.


Best regards,

Carles

Regardless the file I want to open (see attached photo number 1), Windows 7 always asks me the aforementioned question. After answering "Ejecutar"....


i) I can open these files:

- TeX Live command-line

- TeX Live documentation

- TeX Live Manager

- TeXdoc GUI


ii) I can't open these files:

- DVIOUT DVI viewer

- TeXworks editor (after clicking "Ejecutar" appears a framework only during a fraction of a second, the file does not open and nothing else happens)


iii) I can open this file but with an error message:

- PS_View

Error message: Psv Error - Failed to create a temporary file name - error 5: acceso denegado (see attached photo number 2)


Thank you for reading me,

Dear Carles,

if you do not go step-by-step and just add other errors messages, no
one will ever be able to help you. Can you ansver Philip's question
from his latest email?

"acceso denegado" definitely does not signal problem in your operating
system, it is just a problem of your workflow. Without giving the
exact steps nobody will help you. I can have exactly the same error in
Linux or Mac OSX if I ignore the operating system conventions.

  Carles,

You don't have to post photos ... and 8MB ones at that.
Your text description is more than adequate. I'm just shocked
sometimes at how the younger generations are so unaware of
of the amount of computational resources/bandwidth they
often marshall for even the most simple of tasks. They
used to say a picture is worth - nay "costs" - a thousand
words, but today I think tens of millions is more apt.

Anyway the error is "access denied" - that ps_view tries to
create a temporary file in a directory which the user does
not have access permission. This could be do to:

  1. a needed temp subdirectory has not been created
  2. the user has not been granted needed access permissions
  3. ps_view is set to use an incorrect temp directory

This has been a known problem under Vista and affects
applications other than PS_view:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2008-October/018700.html
http://www.vistax64.com/vista-security/96380-acrobat-distiller-error-acrobat-8-1-vista.html

The post by Paul Smith Guest for the Acrobat Reader 8.1 problem
may also work in your case - run PS_view with admin rights once
to create the temp folder and then alter its permission rights
as/if needed.

Also:

https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?t=25874

And aren't MS Windows error messages great? - as if it would
kill them to display the actual path for the access that
resulted in the error.

Anyone happen to know what temp path PS_view uses?


  Cheers,

  Mike Shell

Ok Zdenek. My answer to Philip's question is:


After clicking "Ejecutar" (when I try to open TeXworks editor) appears a framework only during a fraction of a second, the file does not open and nothing else happens.

And when you try to open it from the command-line, e.g. type in a
command-prompt:

c:\texlive\2015\bin\win32\texworks.exe

Maybe that gives you more useful feedback?

I begin to suspect that TeX Live 2015 did not install fully/correctly.  Perhaps one of the TeX Live team will be able to tell you where to find the installation log, which it might be useful if you then posted.

Where can I find the applicable documentation for the grep script

-script grep ...`.  In particular I'm interested in knowing which grep 
options are available and which are not.

man mtx-grep

But please repeat that question on the ntg-context mailing list. This
is not a normal grep, it's most likely a self-cooked script from
ConTeXt that uses lpeg for matching patterns.

Ok Zdenek. My answer to Philip's question is:


After clicking "Ejecutar" (when I try to open TeXworks editor) appears a framework only during a fraction of a second, the file does not open and nothing else happens.

The installation log, install-tl.log, is in the root of the TeX Live
installation, typically in c:\texlive\2015.

Warnings are not suppressed with scrollmode (I wonder why pdftex does 
suppress them unless in batchmode).

Concerning spaces: we're not (even aiming at exact) log compatible. 
Warnings, errors etc are kind of normalized and can get intercepted with 
lua. Things like opening / closing files - the () thing - as well as the 
way names get repported can differe with e.g. pdftex (maybe even more in 
the future).

The way tex reports (macros, expansion stuff, boxes etc) we try to keep 
as compatible as possible / reasonable.

Backend and engine messages are often independent things anyway.

I think there is not much you can do here other than accept the 
differences (and expect more in the future)

and somehow program around it.

In the 20 years regression testing for LaTeX I remember several 
occasions where spaces popped up in new places (or linebreaks) when a 
new release of web2c was released. This is the same thing and as Hans 
said, lua code will interrupt things and so start new lines in places.

It is a bit surprising that there is a lot of space differences between 
batch and scroll mode but ...

would be nice if there are less, but it is fairly clear that the 
different engines will behave differently here as this is not something 
that matters except when trying to parse the .log file

Guess you need to normalize by hunting for ) as the first char in a line 
combine it with the previous line and then see how far that gets you

maybe it helps to know that there are

- tex messages and errors: these go through the more or less traditional 
machinery, but spaces and newlines can creep in as a side effect of 
linebreaks (max length, utf etc); some extended mechanisms can output a 
bit more in tracing

- backend (or subsystem) warnings and errors: in pdftex/xetex some might 
come from kpse, some from third party libraries, some from within but in 
luatex most of them are normalized (which took a bit of time / effort), 
so where the pdftex backend can report "bla bla" luatex will often 
report "category: bla bla"; some harmless errors became warnings and 
some warnings became errors, so that also can be different); for too 
isolated libraries one can expect anything in terms of messages but 
normally it's then a fatal error anyway

I used said method of equivs in https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html 
on Ubuntu 15.10 and 16.04 (though not on a VM) and it worked as 
expected. When I installed TeXworks (with Synaptic, but I'm sure it 
would have been the same with apt-get), it only installed

     libqt4-scripttools (4:4.8.7+dfsg-5ubuntu2)
     libsynctex1 (2015.20160222.37495-1)
     texworks (0.5~svn1363-6build2)
     texworks-help-en (0.5~svn1363-6build2)

On the other hand, the binaries you got installed won't affect your work 
if you prepend to your PATH the TeXLive path:

     /usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-linux

(if your architecture is 64 bit, or the corresponding if it is 32 bit).

*Also*, you have to make sure that TeXworks path

     File -> Preferences -> Typesetting

has the TeXLive path on top (I don't use TeXworks, but Emacs, though I 
just tried it, and it works OK).

The debian page describes how to build the equivs package

just for checking, did you remember to install that texlive local package that you had just build? It is that packages that tells apt-get that certain packages (or equivalents) there of  have already been installed

You can check via

dpkg --get-selections | grep texlive

The only result I get (on Ubuntu 14.04) is

texlive-local

Hmm, that is strange.

texmaker on Debian (and so I guess Ubuntu), does not depend
on texlive-binaries:

$ apt-cache show texmaker
...
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1), libgl1-mesa-glx | libgl1, libpoppler-qt5-1 (>= 0.24.5), libqt5concurrent5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5core5a (>= 5.5.0), libqt5gui5 (>= 5.2.0), libqt5network5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5printsupport5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5script5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5webkit5 (>= 5.0.2), libqt5widgets5 (>= 5.2.0), libqt5xml5 (>= 5.0.2), libstdc++6 (>= 4.1.1), libsynctex1, zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4), texmaker-data (= 4.4.1-1.1)

...

checking the equivs of 2016 I ee all texlive related entries, including
latex-beamer, provided by texlive-local version 2016 if built from the
correct equivs file.

Can you not just simply try to remove texlive-binaries, and if that
works, all is fine, if not, it wil tell you that this is not possible
because foorbar is depending on it:

$ dpkg --purge texlive-binaries
dpkg: dependency problems prevent removal of texlive-binaries:

I understand that it should, but I'm saying in practice it doesn't on my 
VM.  I can verify that the texlive-local package is installed, but 
apt-get still wants to install texlive-binaries as part of the texmaker 
installation.

I get the same list of dependencies as Norbert from texmaker.  When I 
try to purge texlive-binaries I do get a dependency warning:

dpkg: dependency problems prevent removal of texlive-binaries:
  asymptote depends on texlive-base-bin; however:
   Package texlive-base-bin is not installed.
   Package texlive-binaries which provides texlive-base-bin is to be 
removed.

So obviously it's asymptote that's creating the problem.  Now, I never 
asked for asymptote to be installed (just texmaker) and it's only listed 
as a recommended package for texmaker, so I'm not sure why it would have 
been installed.  Is there a configuration setting that would elevate 
"recommends" to "depends"?  If I remove it, I can successfully remove 
texlive-binaries.

Further, I notice that texlive-base-bin is not listed in the equivs 
file.  I would guess, then, that there is a problem with chaining 
"provides" as texlive-local (as built by equivs) provides 
texlive-binaries which should, in turn, provide texlive-base-bin. 
Perhaps texlive-base-bin should be added to the equivs file?

Indeed.

Please edit the equivs input file, and add
	asymptote
to the long list. Then run the equivs command again, and install
the package. After that you can remove asymptote, too.

> So obviously it's asymptote that's creating the problem.  Now, I

It is not a problem, it is supposed to be so.

Yes, by *default* recommended packages will be installed. That has
been the case in Debian (and thus Ubuntu) since many many years
(20+?)

> that would elevate "recommends" to "depends"?  If I remove it, I can

No, see above. But there is one to not install recommends by default.

Which version of asymptote do you have installed? In *my* version 
(2.38-1) there is *no* depends on texlive-base-bin.

Anyway, that is fine, that was an old name of the package that is not 
existing anymore. 

> Perhaps texlive-base-bin should be added to the equivs file?

Not needed.

So texlive provides asymptote.  Got it.

Well, in my defense, Ubuntu is not my primary system (that's a Mac).  I 
have Ubuntu VMs for the purpose of testing cross-platform compatibility 
and helping to troubleshoot other people's installations.  However, it's 
always good to learn new things so I'll keep this in mind for the future.

> Which version of asymptote do you have installed? In *my* version

The version installed on Ubuntu 14.04 is 2.15-2build2.  Clearly that's 
well out of date compared to yours, but then the TeXLive version that 
apt-get finds on that system is TL2013, so it's probably a matter of an 
old system being behind the times.  On my 16.04 VM the version is 2.37-1 
(with a dependency on texlive-binaries and not texlive-base-bin), quite 
a bit closer to yours.

Dear all,

following advice from https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html, I was
able to integrate my TeXLive installation in the package list of Kubuntu
16.04.

It seems that the template file for TL2016 is missing at least two more
package replacements: asymptote and texinfo.

Note that 'asy' requires 'libglut.so.3' to start, which is provided by
package 'freeglut3'. This should be listzed as a 'Depends:' list entry.

Attached I submit a small patch file to accommodate these changes.

Cheers and thanks for this cool trick,
Andreas

I tried to install texlive 2016 from the DVD onto a Ubuntu system. I 
left the installation running while I had supper but when I returned 
there was nothing showing on the screen so I don't know if there were 
any error messages or suchlike. I changed the .profile file to pick up 
the 2016 version rather than the 2015 version. It seemed to run 2016 on 
sample2e.tex but all the other files it used were from 2015. I tried 
"tlmgr update -list" but I got a message saying

"Unknown directive ...container checksum c59200567...,please fix it! at 
usr/local/texlive/2015/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 210, <$retfh> line

Any ideas? Should I try and delete the 2016 version and start again 
staring at the screen for a couple of hours?

Thanks

Apologies for the noise. I hadn't realised that I had to shut down and 
restart Ubuntu for the change to the .profile file to take effect. 
Perhaps, though, I will discover other problems along the way.

Dear Peter,
there is no need to reboot your system at all.  Since ~/.profile is
executed when you log in, it's sufficient to log out and in again.

For testing it's sufficient to start a new terminal and type

  . ~/.profile

The first dot means "execute the script within the current shell".
You can now check in this terminal whether everything works as
expected.  The change has no impact on other processes which are
currently running.  Thus it's quite safe.  You can't break anything
but this particular shell if you did a mistake.

If everything works fine you can launch other programs from this
terminal but if you want to launch programs from a menu provided by
the window manager, you have to log in again in order to make the GUI
aware of the changes in your ~/.profile .

There is no need to re-boot a Unix system at all except if a system
update provides a new kernel and you want to use it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] fc-cache documentation ?
Message-ID: <57C14BB9.8060904@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

I discovered, after considerable trial and error, that running :

    fc-cache -v C:/Windows/Fonts

before attempting any XeTeX compilation caused a multi-second improvement in performance (without the preliminary fc-cache command, loading the first font took upwards of 10 seconds, even with an SSD as C:).  But TeXdoc fc-cache tells me it does not have anything relevant.

Where is fc-cache documented, please, and how is the "normal" user to learn (a) of its existence, and (b) of its potential importance.

The question is fully legitimate.

It's the usual discrepance between developers and users.  People who
start with coding often change to a unix-like platform because command
line tools like TeX are natural there.  However, Joe User stays on
Windows and needs different, much enlarged documentation because the
basics are so different.

In particular, FontConfig (which fc-cache is part of) runs on
virtually all GNU/Linux or BSD boxes *automatically* because it is the
de-facto font managing standard on unix-like boxes.

Thank you for acknowledging the validity of the question, Werner.  But I am still puzzled as to know how how Knuth's "B L User" is intended to (a) learn of the existence of fc-cache (and presumably, some of the other fc-tools), (b) understand their potential importance in terms of the run-time for XeTeX and friends, and (c) learn how/when to invoke fc-cache.  Having posted my question earlier, I then thought that perhaps the reason that TeXdoc has no entry for "fc-cache" is because one is not intended to invoke it directly, but rather through (e.g.,) "tlmgr"   However, I then ran "TeXdoc tlmgr" and found no mention of fc-cache therein.  So, is there any part of TeX Live that interacts with fc-cache (or with any other element of fontconfig), or is the latter a completely separate subsystem on which TeX Live depends but does not invoke directly nor document in any way ?  TeXdoc fontconfig also returns "Topic unknown".

  By reading the documentation?  Try ?texdoc xetex-reference?.
Fontconfig is mentioned in the second paragraph of the part about fonts.

  Yes, it is.  Had you really not heard of it before?

But there is no mention of "fc-cache" (the only "fc-" command mentioned is "fc-list").  To be told that "the font is looked up through the operating system, using the fontconfig library" does not really make it clear that if one is experiencing significant delays loading fonts that one needs to search outside the TeX Live documentation in order to learn how to address such issues.  One might reasonably think that if a major component of TeX Live such as XeTeX relies heavily on another component (fontconfig) that is installed /as a part of/ TeX Live (all instances of fc-cache.exe on my computer reside in *:\TeX\Live\*\bin\win32), then (a) the TeX Live manager might expose an interface to fontconfig, (b) that the TeX Live documentation might make some mention the importance of fc-cache, and (c) that if running fc-cache is a necessary prerequisite to obtaining satisfactory performance when compiling XeTeX source files, that fc-cache might be run automatically (or
semi-automatically) rather than relying on the user (a) having heard of it and (b) thinking to use it ...

Ah.  Thank you.
> Had you really not heard of it before?
Clearly I must have read at least once of "fc-cache", otherwise I could never have thought to try it, but how, when and where I learned of its existence I wot not.

  Yes, it would be helpful to mention fc-cache in addition to fc-list.
Do you have any concrete suggestion to improve that paragraph?

  Indeed, this is not stated in the reference documentation.  Nor do I
think it is necessarily true.  And this issue is clearly about XeTeX,
not TeX Live.

Not yet, because I have been using fc-cache only since yesterday and do not as yet have any idea why (a) things seemed to suddenly go a lot slower, and (b) then speeded up again after running fc-cache.  Is it the case (for example), that if I add a single font to the Windows font collection, then even if that font is not referenced by my XeTeX sources it is nonetheless necessary to manually run "fc-cache C:/Windows/Fonts" before I will once again be able to compile without waiting well over ten seconds for the first font to load ?

I respectfully disagree.  The TeX Live manager exposes an interface to "the font map database" (whatever that is), which is presumably used not by TeX Live itself (apart from the TeX Live Manager and the local and remote repositories, it is hard to think of anything that /is/ TeX Live rather than software installed /by/ TeX Live), yet it does not expose an interface to fontconfig.  Presumably the font map database is crucial to some element(s) of the software that are installed by TeX Live (?LaTeX?), just as fontconfig is crucial to other elements of that software (XeTeX), so why expose an interface to one but not the other ?

  That sounds a little odd, but not all that unexpected.  I shouldn't be
surprised if this very issue had earlier been mentioned on public fora,
for example the XeTeX list.

It depends on fontconfig implementation and configuration. In the
early Linux version fc-cache was run automatically only on reboot,
later it was changed to run once a day. It can be configured in the
configuration file, the default was later changed to one hour, now 10
minutes. This means I no longer run fc-cache manually, I just wait a
short time after adding a font.

I am shocked that it takes so long.  On linux (or at least the
version I use), we recommend running fc-cache after installing or
deleting fonts.

Somebody once suggested that it is good to put each set of fonts in
its own subdirectory, to speed up cache access - but even on the box
where I have several hundred fonts (I was comparing those which are
current, and installed all of Noto - with over 400 fonts in one
subdirectory) it is usually quick.  Specifically, it only updates
caches in directories where things have changed.

> Where is fc-cache documented, please, and how is the "normal" user to learn (a) of its existence, and (b) of its potential importance.

For a 'nix user, man fc-cache.  I assume you don't have manpages, so
the reply suggesting that you use google was appropriate for finding
the docs.  I am told that google gives different results to different
people, based on their search history, but for me there were at
least two links to the documentation in my first few results.

For 'a', I don't know. For 'b' - my understanding is that the caches
are rebuilt as-necessary if fontconfig detects that something has
changed.  From that, rebuilding the caches is normally a one-off
process - so if the first run of xelatex caused the cache to be
rebuilt (I'm assuming all your fonts are in a flat directory, not
subdirectories) then the second run should not need to repeat that.

If you continue to see the problem (and have not changed the
installed fonts in the meantime), I suspect that something else is
the problem.

Thanks for that - I'll have to read the source.

So this boils down to the following question:

  Is fontconfig automatically run Windows if a font changes (in one of
  the directories observed by fontconfig)?

Or to formulate it differently:

  On Windows, does TeXLive install fontconfig as a background program
  that is capable of monitoring the system font directories?  [Note
  that it is not necessary to handle fonts within TeXLive, AFAIK,
  since XeTeX and friends can use the texlsr data base.]

In case the answer is yes, the next question would be

  On Windows, does the TeXLive installer provides an interface to
  configure the directories observed by fontconfig?

Clearly /I/ don't know, but it is an important question; based purely on empirical evidence, I suspect not.

Can it/they ?  Is it not the case that whereas a file has but one name, and can therefore easily be found using the texlsr database, a font can have many names, many/most of which cannot be derived from its file name, and therefore one needs a more sophisticated database for fonts -- in other words, this is perhaps why fontconfig is required in the first place.

I cannot find one, but I did discover an XML file called (I think) "fonts.conf", and when I looked inside I saw that (of course) it reflected the original installation partition (E:) rather than the SSD partition (C:) to which I had copied TeX Live in an effort to speed things up before I discovered that a call to fc-cache was actually what was needed ...  So here, too, an interface from TLMGR to fontconfig would be very useful, so that one does not have to hand-edit XML files.

No.

fontconfig and tools is installed and during installation a one
time fc-cache run is performed.

In TeX Live for windows, fontconfig is used only by
XeTeX, in which the fontconfig is linked as a simple
static library. So fc-cache should be invoked manually.
If fonts are used by "file names", Kpathsea is used
instead of fontconfig in all platforms.

I sent Reinhard, who maintains documents in
doc/supports/wintools, manuals on fontconfig tools.
I hope he will add them if he agrees they are ok.

Best,
Akira

There is no fontconfig daemon or such thing, at least on Windows (but
i've never seen that too on linux)

Afaik, the cache is run automatically once, when fcinit() is called
and does not find its cache file.

So what is needed (it would seem) is for fcinit () to check whether the cache is valid, and if not, to re-run fc-cache.

One quick check for cache validity would be to record the last-modified date of each of the font directories and compare the current value with the recorded value; if the current value is more recent, the cache is potentially invalid; if the current value is earlier than the recorded date, an internal consistency check error should be signalled.

Dear Philip,

FcInit() is called by XeTeX, thus, as you know,
caches are created automatically if needed, with
a considerable delay of time. If you run fc-cache
before, there is not the delay.

I'm not familiar with fontconfig.
My experience seems to show that, if even a single
font file is added/removed/changed, it is needed to
update caches.

Best,
Akira

What I was experiencing was that the delay occurred at the start of /every/ compilation (regardless of the fonts that the sources referenced), and that the only way to prevent this was to run fc-cache C:/Windows/Fonts by hand (the last learned by trial and error).

That is borne out by my experience, but do you not think that a modification to the behaviour of fcinit (), as suggested in my earlier message, would resolve the problem ?

Philip,

Your suggestion might need administrator rights on each run, boy on Windows and UNIX. This is not very nice.

Font support is system stuff and should not be managed in user level programs.

Why would that be the case, Norbert ?  Reading the last-modified date for the system fonts directory (on my Windows 7 Ultimate system, at least) does not require administrator rights, and all of the other operations (such as marking the cache invalid, re-creating the cache, etc) operate entirely within the TeX Live hierarchy ...

I still don't understand, Norbert.  Exactly which operations do you believe might require elevated privileges ?  Reading the last-modified date for the system font directory{y|ies} ?  (not required for Windows 7 Ultimate).  Manipulating the cache ? (this already takes place).

Dear Philip,

In a file

create a line

FC_CACHEDIR = c:/your/writable/directory

The file

is read before distributed

in texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf:

FC_CACHEDIR = $TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/cache

So in an admin install, admin permissions are required to update the
font cache. Note that as of the 2016 release, the entire TL
directory is write-protected for non-admin users.

A Windows-only option in tlmgr to (re-)run fc-cache would help.

For our university installation, I have added lines

FONTCONFIG_PATH = $TEXMFVAR/fonts/conf
FC_CACHEDIR = $TEXMFVAR/fonts/cache

to <root>/texmf.cnf because I do not control the system fonts of
users.

Is there a way to run fc-cache separately for TL fonts and for
system fonts?

Dear Siep,

> Is there a way to run fc-cache separately for TL fonts and for
> system fonts?

I remember that in my implementation for windows, it is simplified that
cache files go uniquely into FC_CACHEDIR.
Since fontconfig is used only by XeTeX on w32,
FONTCONFIG_PATH = $TEXMFVAR/fonts/conf
FC_CACHEDIR = $TEXMFVAR/fonts/cache
is desirable. The above variables in texmf.cnf are
used only by windows.

PS:
XE_FONTCONFIG_PATH and XE_FC_CACHEDIR have precedence:
If XE_FONTCONFIG_PATH is defined, then FONTCONFIG_PATH is not used.
If XE_FC_CACHEDIR is defined, then FC_CACHEDIR is not uded.

The above may be convenient in the case where users have
different fontconfig with different env. vars FONTCONFIG_PATH and FC_CACHEDIR.

Best,
Akira

This (and your remaining questions) is a documentation issue; Akira is

AFAIK, this already happens.  However, fontconfig currently doesn't
know in advance whether building the cache will be expensive.  We have
a similar problem with lilypond; we would like to show a message

  please be patient, the font cache must be created

if necessary but fontconfig doesn't provide an API for that.

	tlmgr postaction [--w32mode=user|admin] install script xetex

does that, so not Windows only ;-)

You would need a lot of knowledge of the internals of TL to figure
that out.

Hi Siep,

That why there was a smiley.

Can you suggest a modus operandi for the suggested tlmgr action that works nicely with the XeTeX postinstall script?

Thanks

If XeTeX consults fontconfig only in order to map font names to file
names, a list of file names should be sufficient.  LuaTeX is different
in this respect because it converts OTF to Lua and thus has to
recreate the cache whenever a newer version of a particular font is
installed.

Creating cache files is an expensive operation.  LuaTeX rebuilds the
cache whenever you try to access a font which doesn't exist.  Maybe
XeTeX does something similar.

However, LuaTeX rebuilds the cache also if you misspelled the font
name in your TeX file.

It would be nice to determine first whether the cache has to be
updated at all.  Comparing directory listings is an inexpensive
operation.  XeTeX could use fontconfig (fonts.conf) in order to
obtain a list of directories containing fonts and in LuaTeX,
luaotfload maintains a list of font directories by itself.

Checking in advance whether rebuilding the caches is necessery at all
by an inexpensive operation can save a lot of time, especially when
people misspell font names in their TeX files.

Phil, I really appreciate your suggestion.  There is no reason to
update the caches if nothing had changed.  And detecting changes in a
few directories is a cheap operation which takes only a few
milliseconds.

Regards,
  Reinhard

But if file permissions are too restrictive, users can't install fonts
themselves.  LuaTeX already creates a cache file for each user in his
HOME directory by default.  I don't see any reason for fontconfig to
behave different.

Sure, the system admin should provide a reasonable set of fonts, but
users should be able to add additional fonts at any time.

Actually, this operation should be done by fontconfig itself...

At least in Linux fontconfig allows cache per user but it is a
frequent source of problems. I do not know why the developers decided
that fontconfig will update its cache automatically and IMHO it was
the right decision. My /etc/fonts/fonts.conf contains (it is the
default, I have not changed it):

        <config>
<!--
  Rescan configuration every 30 seconds when FcFontSetList is called
 -->
                <rescan>
                        <int>30</int>
                </rescan>
        </config>

Thus I never call fc-cache myself, only in case of strange problems.
Fontconfig can handle different kinds of mispellings, I can use TeX
Gyre Termes, TeXGyreTermes or even texgyretermes. However, if I do not
specify the exact name in XeTeX, which is in this case TeX Gyre Termes
(with spaces), the XeTeX run takes a long time.

For a single-user install everything should happen automatically, so
no need for any provisions in tlmgr.

For a multiuser install and an admin run, two actions would be
useful:

1. re-running fc-cache

2. switching to per-user caches by simply appending
   FC_CACHEDIR = $TEXMFVAR/fonts/cache
   to the root texmf.cnf.

It appears that a system fontconfig and a user cache work just fine
together.

Yes, this is what Joe User wants!  You install a font, and an
application that uses fontconfig sees this font within 30 seconds or
after a new start (whatever happens earlier).  The former, however,
needs some additional code in the application which is usually
missing, so a restart makes everything work fine.

However, if no font cache exists ? on Windows, there is no global font
cache for the system but usually a per-application/per-user cache ?
fontconfig doesn't provide a means to find out in advance whether
creating and/or updating the cache will be expensive.  In case of
lilypond (and XeTeX probably also), it looks like the application
freezes in an endless loop, since scanning fonts can take a very long
time.  For example, scanning `NotoCJKSans.ttc' takes more than a
minute on my not so slow notebook.

Another issue is that (some?) fontconfig versions before 2.11 scan the
user's font directory `~/.fonts' (or the equivalent directory of
Windows) again and again: A cache entry gets created but it is
immediately invalidated.  If you have a large amount of fonts in that
directory, fontconfig slows down considerably.  Meanwhile, there's fix
for this behaviour, so I recommend to upgrade to the latest fontconfig
version 2.11.

Note also that fontconfig for Windows doesn't find fonts registered with
the registry, while other applications do, which can lead to some user
complains:

My apologies if I missed this answer in the discussion, but TL's
documentation answers both:

3.4.4 System font configuration for XeTEX and LuaTEX

XeTEX and LuaTEX can use any font installed on the system, not just
those in the TEX trees. They do these via related but not identical
methods.

On Windows, fonts shipped with TEX Live are automatically made available
to XeTEX by font name. On Mac OS X, supporting font name lookups
requires additional steps; please see the MacTEX web pages
(http://tug.org/mactex). For other Unix systems, the procedure to be
able to find the fonts shipped with TEX Live via font name follows.

To facilitate this, when the xetex package is installed (either at
initial installation or later), the necessary configuration file is
created in TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf.

To set up the TEX Live fonts for system-wide use (assuming you have
suitable privileges), proceed as follows:

    1. Copy the texlive-fontconfig.conf file to
    /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf.
    2. Run fc-cache -fsv.

If you do not have sufficient privileges to carry out the steps above,
or if you want to make the TEX Live fonts available to only one user,
you can do the following:

    1. Copy the texlive-fontconfig.conf file to ~/.fonts.conf, where ~
    is your home directory.
    2. Run fc-cache -fv.

You can run fc-list to see the names of the system fonts. The
incantation fc-list : family style file spacing (all arguments are
literal strings) shows some generally interesting information.


6.2 Additional software included on Windows

fc-list, fc-cache, ...
    The tools from the fontconfig library allow XeTEX to handle system
    fonts on Windows. You can use fc-list to determine the font names to
    pass to XeTEX?s extended \font command. If necessary, run fc-cache
    first to update font information.


Best, Arash

Apropos of this discussion, those members of this list who also subscribe to the XeTeX mailing list will know that a few days ago Apostolos Syropoulos asked for volunteers to test Frederika2016 :

> I am working on the digitization of Frederica Zapf (the Greek part of > Virtuosa Zapf) and I would like to know if there is anybody in this > list who would like to play a bit with font and give me some > feedback.

I volunteered, Apostolos sent me a copy of the font, I installed it, re-compiled the Catalogue of Greek MSS in LPL after changing the Greek font from Palatino Linotype to Frederika2016, reported that a couple of glyphs appeared to be missing (GREEK NUMERAL SIGN (Dexia keraia) and  GREEK LOWER NUMERAL SIGN (Aristeri keraia)) and that was that.

Today Apostolos sent me a new copy of the font, I installed it, re-compiled, and found the glyphs still missing; Apostolos said they were now present, sent test files to shew the missing glyphs were found on his system, then suggested that perhaps I was still using the old version of the font and sent a further version.  The new version also had no effect when installed.

Then he sent a test file that referenced the font as "[Frederika2016.otf]" rather than as "Frederika2016" as I had been using, and with that change I too could now typeset GREEK NUMERAL SIGN (Dexia keraia) and  GREEK LOWER NUMERAL SIGN (Aristeri keraia) using "[Frederika2016.otf]" but not if using "Frederika2016".

I then :
> deleted every instance of Frederika2016.otf I could find; deleted the font Frederika2016Italic from the Windows font directory; ran fc-cache; re-booted; deleted a single instance of Frederika2016 from the registry; and finally, in desperation, I deleted the entire contents of :

Can any knowledgeable person please tell me how I can ask XeTeX/fontconfig where it is finding Frederika2016 ?

Maybe running with   \XeTeXtracingfonts=1   would provide some clues?

However, I cannot find "Frederika2016.otf" in C:/Windows/fonts (even as System Administrator), and do not know how to interpret "D^^A/Windows/fonts/Frederika2016.otf".
A thought :  I wonder if C:/Windows/fonts is unwriteable to normal users, and therefore Windows UAC has created a hidden directory which it covertly maps to C:/Windows/Fonts ...

Hi Siep,

I don't understand. *What* should happen?

During install/update of xetex the fc-cache is run already.

Do you mean when new *fonts* are installed, then we should run
fc-cache?

Ok, that can be done.

That needs only documentation and users should do that. There is
already the option to use
	tlmgr conf texmf FC_CACHEDIR '$TEXMFVAR/fonts/cache'
(if I remember correctly).

One aspect of the mystery is now solved.  Although Windows Explorer claims that there is no file called "Frederika*.*" in C:/Windows/Fonts, an elevated command prompt and a simple DIR reveals that the files (there were two) exist, and at the same elevated command prompt they can be (and have been) deleted.  The font has been re-installed, the test file now compiles correctly, and the two missing GREEK NUMBER signs appear as intended.

However :

1) The compilation [1, attached] takes 20 seconds to compile /every time/, almost all of that apparently being concerned with the font loading
2) The log file [2, attached] contains cryptic references to (e.g.,)

-> K^^A/Windows/fonts/Frederika2016.otf

        and

-> b^^N/Windows/fonts/pala.ttf


where I do not understand the meaning of K^^A and b^^N.


Given that, during my earlier test, I was able to see XeTeX re-populate C:\TeX\Live\2016\texmf-var\fonts\cache when I emptied it by hand, it is not clear to me why it cannot now re-create the cache(s) once and once only and then allow my compilation to proceed without a further need to re-create the caches on subsequent runs.  Could a clue to the problem lie in the name of the only one of the cache files to have been modified today :

> d031bbba323fd9e5b47e0ee5a0353f11-x86.cache-7.NEW
The first line of this file contains the string :


> Version:1.0 StartHTML:0000000107 EndHTML:0000000598 StartFragment:0000000538 EndFragment:0000000562
>
> C:/Windows/fonts
>
The suggestion by Akira-san resolves the problem :

> In a file
> .../texlive2016/texmf.cnf
> create a line
>
> FC_CACHEDIR = c:/your/writable/directory 
Following this change, the second and subsequent compilations proceed at the anticipated speed.

A xetex run should trigger fc-cache when needed. The original
problems of Phil Taylor were caused by misconfiguration.

This works right only if the user has write access to the cache
directory.

Later today I'll install a new font in windows and try to use it
with xetex and see whether it really works as advertised.

Of course, a button in the GUI would be easier to find. It would be
even better if xetex or fc-cache could complain and give the user a
hint if fc-cache needs to run but the cache directory is not
writable. But that is not a job for us.

Although I am no longer in a position to test, it is possible that the following Explorer location may also have disclosed the existence of the concealed font file :

On the bright side: only the cache file for Windows is regenerated.

On the dark side: the fc-cache runi, if triggered by xetex,
apparently can not or will not overwrite the original file
d031bbba323fd9e5b47e0ee5a0353f11-x86.cache-7 but instead created a
file d031bbba323fd9e5b47e0ee5a0353f11-x86.cache-7.NEW

Removing the old one and renaming the new one restores normality.

Whether the new font is actually used makes no difference.

I doubt that fontconfig developers are willing to do this.  Whenever
you run apt-get install, yum install, etc. in order to install
a new font, all these installers run fc-cache automatically.

You only have to invoke fc-cache manually after installing a font
manually.  IMO this should be sufficient.

Yes, I referred strange behaviour in my e-mail of 09:50 today:

> Given that, during my earlier test, I was able to see XeTeX re-populate C:\TeX\Live\2016\texmf-var\fonts\cache when I emptied it by hand, it is not clear to me why it cannot now re-create the cache(s) once and once only and then allow my compilation to proceed without a further need to re-create the caches on subsequent runs.  Could a clue to the problem lie in the name of the only one of the cache files to have been modified today :

Yes, I should have mentioned it.

I wasn't worried by the lack of mention, Siep -- just was not sure whether you had seen the message.

I wasn't clear enough, sorry.  fontconfig *does* update the cache if
necessary.  However, it would be great to have a (heuristic) function
that tells you in advance whether this operation becomes expensive,
for example, if the cache file is missing, or a great number of fonts
have to be scanned, or whether the size of the fonts is large, etc.,
etc.

On Windows 7, files that would otherwise be written in a protected directory (such as C:\Windows\) end up in:

C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Windows\

where username is the current user's login name.

On the other hand, when I cannot seem to find a file in an obvious place (for example, if I saved a file in Excel and look for it in C:\User\luecking\Documents\) I have discovered that our IT guys have configured things so that it is saved to a network server called \\mydocs.uark.edu<file:///\\mydocs.uark.edu>, which I have access to through the "Libraries" tree in my "Computer" window. Probably \\localhost<file:///\\localhost> is similar.

No, "\\localhost" refers to the Windows PC itself, Dan, not to a server.  The location is identical to C:/Windows/fonts, but Windows treats the latter as special (it won't shew the contents as files, only as fonts) whereas the former is treated as a normal directory.
