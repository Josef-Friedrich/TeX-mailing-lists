Subject: [tex-live] Build binaries with static libraries

    At least readline is problematic for me

If you want to go to the trouble, you could download original readline
source from ftp.gnu.org, build only a static version, install it
somewhere completely separate (like we do with the clisp libraries), and
link against it there. Dick has been trying this, haven't got all the
details yet, but we'll get there.

I don't see the need to include readline (or anything else) in TL just
for the sake of asy on a few non-backward-compatible-by-design OS's and
decline to do so. --best, karl.

Re: readline and asymptote

On the Mac, we have always compiled asy with static libraries for readline, Fast Fourier Transform Library, and GNU Scientific Library. I mentioned my method to Karl, who found it "baroque", and I won't describe it here. Karl suggested an easier way: install the libraries and include files in a directory in $HOME and then instruct the asymptote build system to also look there. The first half was easy, but I had trouble setting Environment Variables to make the second half work. That's where I was when Karl wrote his note. But now, following a suggestion of Karl, the whole business works. I'd be happy to provide the easy recipe to anyone who wants, but I suspect most readers can do this themselves.

Hi,

This is a TeX Live Manager 2016 UX bug report / plea for help, in the form
of a question (?subject). Or am I using the 'Remove' button wrong?

More details: Everything I tried to delete ended up being needed by some
kind of "collection", and upon trying to delete an entire collection I was
informed that those collections are in turn needed by various "schemes",
ultimately leading to "scheme-full" through some dependency chain. So I
removed scheme-full to get rid of the root dependency, but of course that
uninstalled every single package (and took hours to run).

Favoring Lite, Portable apps, I'm not happy with a 5Gb default install and
over 100k files. I wanted to cherry pick the available packages; at first
pass keeping everything I don't know if I absolutely do not need. Only
getting rid of various universities' templates, subjects I'm not interested
in, excess fonts, glyphs, and support for languages I do not speak. Going
in alphabetical order, I got tired of reading descriptions and checking
boxes after reaching packages that begin with a letter "c", so I hit the
Remove button.

But you would have done better using the advanced installer, which
lets you pick a smaller scheme and then refine your selection at the
collections level.

Two answers:

1* install scheme-minimal, then use tlmgr to only install the
   packages you need. And you can remove them again.
   You asked for scheme texlive-full, so all is installed and
   required by it.

2* RTFM ... 
	tlmgr remove --force
for removing packages without caring for collection requesting it
	tlmgr remove --no-depends
remove collections without removing depending packages

Enjoy

Howdy,

The following input,

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\begin{document}
Help!
\end{document}

using tikz and pstricks in that order, and typeset using pdflatex seems to produce malformed pdf output. 

I know you shouldn't use pstricks and typeset with pdflatex however we've had multiple people using a template that does just that. We've been telling folks how to correct the problem but wonder if there should be a problem propagated to the pdf in the first place.

Unfortunately, the latest version of macOS Sierra seems to have problems with the file; previous macOS versions didn't have these problems. Apple knows about the problem and is working on a fix but we have no idea how long that will take.

Note: removing the loading of tikz (before pstricks) removes the problem. Typesetting using latex->dvips->ps2pdf creates a good pdf. Also, changing the order of loading the two packages also creates a good pdf. So, the loading of pstricks seems to be changing something loaded by tikz (not too surprising that they would step on each other's feet a bit in this circimstance) which then propogates into the pdf even though neither package is actually used.

This is  not a tex-live issue (can't really handle package conflicts at
this level)
but anyway I get no error just the warnings about non-pdf specials
and the resulting pdf doesn't appear malformed, at least xpdf, acrobat
reader
and the pdffinfo utility don't complain about it?

I get no complains either. But looking at the pdf (with
compresslevel 0) I can see that the pdf refers to three objects:

/ColorSpace 3 0 R /Pattern 2 0 R /ExtGState 1 0 R 

but the object themselves are only there if one load pstricks before
tikz:

1 0 obj
<<>>
endobj
2 0 obj
<<>>
endobj
3 0 obj
<<  /pgfprgb [/Pattern /DeviceRGB] >>
endobj


So I think it possible that some viewer complains. But it would
involve a lot of work and time to identify the reason and I don't
think it is worth. The users should simply not load pstricks.

I uploaded a new version of pstricks.tex to CTAN, which should
be available on TL in a  couple of days.

Hi

Documents using the package hvfloat do not compile (`! LaTeX Error: File
`hvfloat.sty' not found`) even though the package is installed. I suspect
that the package is not installed at the right place. In my installation it
is located here:

texlive/2016basic/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hvfloat/latex/hvfloat.sty

It does not seem right to be under `doc`

Has no effect. I also tried -aux-directory and the combination of them.
I tried absolute pathes (using the correct dir delemiter \) and relative

No effect. No error. The temporary build files occure in the same place

The option should be before the file name:

G:\Z-Test>xelatex -output-directory=out test-utf8

works fine for me.

Hello everyone, I have TexLive 2016 (upgraded) running winenpro (x64) and
fedora 25 (x64). After updating on both operating systems I realize that
the following file does not compile in win10 (pdflatex -recorder).
The file is as follows:
% test
\documentclass{article}%
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{libertine}
\usepackage[libertine]{newtxmath}
\useosf % for osf in normal text
\begin{document}
Hola 2017 :) and $2017$
\end{document}
Any idea that is what is happening?
Attach auxiliary files for clarity

You have an obsolete libertine.map on your system.  Use

  kpsewhich libertine.map

to find it.  Remove it (and any other obsolete files)
and run updmap or updmap-sys.

updmap: Updating ls-R files.

Anyway I do not understand how it happened, I only update using
tlmgr update --self --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed
In any case,  the problem is gone.

Thankful for everything.

Well, you did run once
	updmap
and now you have user supplied files, that override the ones by the
system.

updmap did tell you the problems.

You should not run both updmap-sys and updmap ...

(TL2017 will fix this  hopefully)

The problem will reappear with *EVERY*NEW*UPDATE* because you have
local updmap genrated files which override those of the system.

If you have NO idea of what I am talking, then best is probably to
remove the listed offending files in 
	~/.texlive2016/texmf-var/fonts/...

I will have it present for the next one, before running the updmap-sys
command look in the options (if there was -force) to write the local
configuration ... I think I will remove the problematic files so I do not
have problems in the next update . Regards... PS: Plans for update the

If you have *no* private fonts in ~/texmf/fonts ... (in your TEXMFHOME), then
you should:
* remove ~/.texlive2016/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
* remove the files under ~/.texlive2016/texmf-var/fonts/map/
* run *only* updmap-sys and *never* updmap

Ok I understand. A while ago I installed "getnonfreefonts", will cause some
problem with this?
(Perhaps having installed this caused my initial problem with libertine)
Best

Subject: [tex-live] Fatal fontspec error: "cannot-use-pdftex"
Message-ID: <594cb73c-169c-3858-90d0-8cf7ab1471ec@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have TeXLive installed on both Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10 with no 
problems but today just after the update process I got an error with 
fontenc package:

Fatal fontspec error: "cannot-use-pdftex" The fontspec package requires 
either XeTeX or LuaTeX. You must change your typesetting engine to, 
e.g., "xelatex" or "lualatex"instead of plain "latex" or "pdflatex". For 
immediate help type H <return>.

This error message is wrong because I am using pdflatex to compile.

I did run pdflatex with my tex file (with beamer) before and after the 
update. Just after the update had ended (without any error message) I 
did run the same file and got that error message.

I can not identify the source of this issue and I would like some 
guidance on how to proceed

Thanks,

JHissa

The error message is because you used pdflatex.
You have included the fontspec package, and that requires xelatex or
lualatex and does not work with pdflatex.

David,

The "culprit" is the `dantelogo.sty' package:

\@tempswatrue% suppose latex or pdflatex

%

\ifXeTeX\@tempswafalse\else\ifLuaTeX\@tempswafalse\fi\fi

%

\if at tempswa% we have (pdf)latex

\message{We run (pdf)latex ... }%

\PassOptionsToPackage{T1}{fontenc}%

\RequirePackage{fontenc}%

\def\dante at font{\fontencoding{\encodingdefault}\fontfamily{DANTE}\selectfont}%

\else

\message{We run (lua)xelatex ... }%

\RequirePackage{fontspec}

\newfontfamily\dante at font{DANTE}%

[Extension=.otf,

BoldFont=*-Bold,

ItalicFont=*-Italic,

BoldItalicFont=*-Bold-Italic]

\fi

%


Maybe there is some issues with the first message line. Well, I removed 
it (don't know why I am using it) and now all works again.

Thanks,

JHissa

It is possible to fool the test in dsntelogo, but it must be done by

If you call
	getnonfreefonts
instead of
	getnonfreefonts-sys
then yes. Because it calls the respective updmap/updmap-sys.

Hello,

I have tried to install TL on Windows 10 (Czech localisation). I have
downloaded install-tl-windows.exe, stored it on our NAS and first
tried to run it by clicking to its icon. It did not work, so I tried
to start it from my USB stick again by clicking. It did not work
either so I opened a DOS window, tried from the USB stick but with the
same result. I have copied the file to the HD but the result was the
same. In all attempts I only got a blue window saying that "this
application cannot run on your computer". This is not my computer, I
am installing TL to a colleague of mine and I do not know Windows 10
and do not know how to find a relevant information in order to find
the reason of the problem.

I have no idea, but you can try to download the zipfile. The exe is
just a small wrapper around the zipfile.

You could try the batch-file in install-tl.zip:

For completeness: the exe installer is not generally incompatible
with Windows 10.

Thank you and sorry for the noise, I just have not seen this error

Message-ID: <4a9b64ff-d6a0-b3b5-8464-ddef98d0d4cc@freenet.de>

Dear all,

although TeXlive 2016 is frozen, I need assistance with the following
situation: I am trying to install a local version of 'cwebmac.tex', but
TeX picks up a different variant.

'kpsewhich cwebmac.tex' correctly reports:
/home/andreas/.texlive2016/texmf-var/tex/generic/cweb/cwebmac.tex

'kpsewhich -a cwebmac.tex' lists three variants:
/home/andreas/.texlive2016/texmf-var/tex/generic/cweb/cwebmac.tex
/opt/texlive/texmf-local/tex/generic/cweb/cwebmac.tex
/opt/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex

However, when I run 'tex url.tex', I get this:
This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2016) (preloaded format=tex)
(./url.tex (/opt/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex) *1
! Undefined control sequence.
l.5 You can send e-mail to \pdfURL

(The missing macro is defined in my local 'cwebmac.tex'.)

Happy Easter,
Andreas

Hi,

Plain TeX first reads tex/plain and its subdirectories and if no match is
found, other directories are searched for. This is why the last one of the
list wins because it will be searched first. If you want to get the same
result by kpsewhich, you have to specify -progname tex in order to force
the same order of directories.

Thanks, this helps a bit. 'kpsewhich -progname tex cwebmac.tex' says:
/opt/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex

However, this is quite counterintuitive.

If I set a soft-link from '~/.texlive2016/.../cwebmac.tex' next to the
CWEB source, both kpsewhich and tex pick up the 'most local' file. :o)

Why? Do you expect that files under the `latex' format
	.../tex/latex/...
are found when running plain tex? No. So you should also expect that
files in the `plain' format first use files under
	.../tex/plain/...

Simple bottom line: If you want to replace a file, make sure that you
place it in the very same hierarchy tree in TEXMFHOME or TEXMFVAR
(btw, TEXMFVAR is not really a good place for a cwebmac.tex replacement!)
and not somewhere else.

That's the trick! So my TeXlive installation _was_ misconfigured in the
first place. After setting TEXMFHOME to "~/.texlive2016/texmf", finally
'tex' found its local stuff as expected.

Also, I was able to fix the installation settings in CWEBBIN:
https://github.com/ascherer/cwebbin/blob/master/cwebbin.spec#L66

Now the installation of CWEBBIN overrides 'cwebmac.tex' of TeXlive if
necessary (although attow both ship the same version).

Many thanks,
Andreas

No, it wasn't misconfigured. Your file placement was wrong, that is all.

You can have of course TEXMFHOME=~/.texlive2016/texmf, but that is
not the default.

Both. My long-standing TeXlive installation wasn't _fully_ configured.

Sure, but the default "~/texmf" wasn't even useful for my system; I only
have uppercase directories in $HOME. And until the experiment with a
modified 'cwebmac.tex', I had no user-local overrides at all. (There
_are_ a few system-local packages in '/opt/texlive/texmf-local/'.)

After moving "~/.texlive2016/texmf-var/tex/generic/cweb/" to
"~/.texlive2016/texmf/tex/plain/cweb/", 'tex' (and 'kpsewhich -progname
tex') didn't even bother to look into that path. Only after setting
'TEXMFHOME' to '~/.texlive2016/texmf/', it worked as expected.

In order to make my installation of CWEBBIN override 'cwebmac.tex' in
the future, I also had to change 'generic' to 'plain' in the specfile.

Thanks again for your guidance.

This is exactly what is written in the documentation and I wrote you how to
correctly invoke kpsewhich. The strategy is more than 20 years old when
LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX 2e had to live side by side and there were different
files for each format but with the same names. It is used up to now and
will be used many more years in the future. By definition tex/plain and
subdirectories contain files intended for plain TeX, tex/generic contain
files usable by any format and any engine. It is normal that a
format/engine prefers more specific files to the generic files. This is the
reason why plain TeX does not accept your "generic" file if a "plain TeX
specific" file with the same name exists. Thus if you have "plain TeX
specific" file that should override the system-wide file, it must be under
texmf-local/tex/plain.

Then it is TeXlive who is storing 'cwebmac.tex' in the wrong place. ;o)

Don Knuth changed the 'Makefile' of CWEB 3.6 in May 2000 to install
'cwebmac.tex' in a 'generic' setting (although running it through LaTeX
is almost a no-op):
https://github.com/ascherer/cweb/commit/16047cfe3179ee613147ca0c54f07a7ae4c82110#diff-b67911656ef5d18c4ae36cb6741b7965R21

In CWEBBIN, I just followed the CWEB convention. For compatibility with
current TeXlive, I change CWEBBIN's behavior, but I wouldn't press DEK
to do the same in CWEB.

Hello,

TL2016 from MacTeX2016 on macOS El Capitan TeX Live Utility says, no
updates available. So this seems to be the final version.

When I call texdoc (I haven't done so for quite a while), terminal
yields the following message:

Mangold:~ juergenfenn$ texdoc footmisc
/Library/TeX/texbin/texdoc:7: module 'texdoc.main' not found:
	no field package.preload['texdoc.main']

	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/loadall.so'
	no file './texdoc.so'
Mangold:~ juergenfenn$

Apart from that, TL still works fine.

J?rgen.

Juergen,

On my machine, running MacTeX-2016 updated a few days ago, texdoc works fine,
pulling up documentation for footmisc and many other things. Here

	/Library/TeX/texbin/texdoc

is a symbolic link to
	
	../../texmf-dist/scripts/texdoc/texdoc.tlu


Is that true for you?

BTW, I know it worked on my machine too. But texdoc does not find any
documentation now.

I can live with texdoc.net for the time being, but I reported the
problem in case it should be a bug related to a recent update.

Yes, it's an alias. And when I drag and drop it from the Finder to
Terminal I get the same result as before:

Hi Andreas,

    Don Knuth changed the 'Makefile' of CWEB 3.6 in May 2000 to install
    'cwebmac.tex' in a 'generic' setting (although running it through LaTeX
    is almost a no-op):

Indeed.  As far as I can see, cwebmac.tex cannot be usefully used with
LaTeX. (E.g., it defines \title and many other things; no good can come
of all that in a LaTeX context.) Dual use under at least plain and latex
is the purpose of the /generic/ subtree. So whatever Don is doing in his
Makefile, I think it is better for it to stay in /plain/ in TL. -k

An initial build for the TL 2017 pretest is available now.
Information at https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html as usual; it's
essentially the same process as previous years. Changes to the engines
this year are rather minor.

As I write this, the mactex and mactex-basictex-*.pkg files aren't quite
ready yet, but I expect Dick will upload them within a day or two.

The TL manual has not yet been updated, and there will be more changes
and more builds, but we have to start somewhere.  Give it a try if you
wish.  --thanks, karl.

Folks,

The tlpretest site now has mactex-2017.pkg and mactex-basictex-2017.pkg.

Note that our support policy has changed. MacTeX now supports the last three
versions of macOS, exactly the operating systems for which Apple releases
security patches. So mactex-2017 and basictex-2017 require Yosemite, 
El Capitan, or Sierra.

The TeX Live install script has legacy binaries for older versions of 
macOS, supplied by Mojca Miklavec.

Should not be possible to maintain compatibility with older version? Is 
there a technical reaseon to break compatibility?

Some installers (macports, anaconda python) fiddle with startup scripts so
you
should also check for a change to your PATH.   The error you cite can occur
if the texdoc script finds a texlua from some other TeX installation.

This has been fixed already:

There still *IS* compatibility.

We have binaries available for versions down to Mac OS X 10.5, so you
can easily install TeX Live on an older machine and it should work out
of the box (the installer is slightly broken today, but it should be
fixed by tomorrow), even though i386 and ppc might disappear next year
due to the pressure of C++11 standard that's not really supported in
the shipped libstdc++ from 2009 and earlier.

And in fact, if you are still using one of the ancient platforms, we
would be enormously grateful for testing (in particular on 10.5 ppc
and i386).

> Is there a technical reason to break compatibility?

Yes and no. It's mostly due to heavy workload to make sure that
binaries compile, install and work properly on:

- 10.5/ppc
- 10.5/i386
- 10.6/i386
- 10.6/x86_64
- 10.7
- 10.8
- 10.9
- 10.10
- 10.11
- 10.12

The installation in fact used to be tested on *every single one of
them*!!!! Now imagine stacking 10 pieces of hardware and installing a
4 GB file on each and every one of them. And whenever there was an
update or a problem, repeat the process, clean up everything and go
from scratch again.

Add to the fact Apple's policy of constantly changing their APIs, so
that two or even three compatibility versions of each GUI app had to
be provided. Plus compiled for ppc, i386, on multiple OS versions,
with different versions of Xcode each, with almost each GUI app having
its own compatibility matrix. And Apple changing their installer and
security policy each year.

You still have all the latest and greatest TeX Live binaries for older
platforms, you just loose the "one click to install that 4 GB dmg". If
you need GUIs, you can install an older MacTeX or fetch them. If you
are on an ancient platform, there's a good chance that those GUIs are
no longer receiving any updates anyway.

The other aspect is that users should be encouraged to use a supported
system if they want a smooth user experience which is why 10.10 has
been deliberately chosen (even if there was potentially no technical
reason not to start at 10.9).

That said, we would welcome any effort to help writing a simple GUI
installer for Mac (for example in Tcl/Tk or Python/Tk) and bundle it
as an app.

I don't understand: the only problem is the installer, but the binaries will be ready ?

All the command-line tools (other than perhaps the latest dvisvgm and
a few more) will be available and you can always install them with
tlmgr as on any other unix (or windows) platform. You can even use
Perl/Tk (requires X11) if you need a GUI. It's just that the 4 GB dmg
installer for MacTeX will no longer work on < 10.10.

So, there will be a tlmgr command to tell to switch from texlive 2016 to texlive 2017?

No. You would install TL 2017 separately. I'm not yet sure about the
next step, but we could make a directory structure that would let you
switch between TL 2016 and 2017 via TeXDist Prefpane or from TeX Live
Utility for example.

I installed TL 2016 almost the same way as on Linux but instead of
/usl/local/texlive I created ~/texlive due to security settings. I do not
plan to switch between several versions of TL because the harddisk on my
MacBook is not so large.

See:
    https://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html
for TL 2017 testing binaries or
    https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html
for TL 2016 (or TL 2017 once it's released.)

For pretest (feel free to pick another mirror):

wget http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar xvzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl...
[sudo] ./install-tl -repository http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/ [-gui]

And then you setup the PATH to point to your binaries.

Folks,

A couple of words about the support change and then I'll keep quiet about the matter.

First, thanks to Mojca for continuing to build the appropriate binaries. She has
described our reasons for the change quite well.

Second, the MacTeX web site has a page explaining how to install TeX Live
directly using the TeX Live install script:

	http://tug.org/mactex/alternateinstall.html <http://tug.org/mactex/alternateinstall.html>

The advantage of this page is that you are told how to change a few default
options at the start of the script, to conform to the configuration of MacTeX.
If you do that, answers to support questions will continue to work for you.

There was a complaint about Apple's constant changing of API's. I do not
agree with this complaint. Last year, I built the ppc binaries on a machine that I bought
in 2003. It was 14 years old. I built the i386 binaries on a machine from 2006. Over
this period, Apple changed processors, changed from 32 to 64 bits and
changed the Cocoa runtime to solve the "fragile base class problem." 
And they switched from $125 for a yearly update to $free.

If you have an old machine, you can continue to use the TeX you used
last year. It didn't suddenly become obsolete. If your hard disk fails, we
archive all the old MacTeX packages and you can get one and be back
in business. Or you can change the install method slightly and use
the new 2017 binaries from Mojca.

Why did we make the change? Last year about 90% of our energy was spent
compiling and testing on old systems used by 5% to 10% of users.
This made no sense. Users who DID update their systems had to use
TeX software compiled by machines from long ago.

There is a more controversial reason, which I'll mention in passing. 
TeX is often used in a university setting, where there is increasing
emphasis on the need for security. In this setting, it is important for
users to keep their operating systems up to date and install the
latest security patches. When a user doesn't do this, they put their
colleagues at risk. I do not fear that TeX itself is a security risk,
but in this atmosphere it felt strange spending so much time supporting
systems which the university really ought to retire.

Ah, I now see that the pre-test instructions differ very significantly from the production ones :

Pre-test:    rsync -a --delete --exclude="mactex*" somemirror::/some/path/ /your/local/dir
Production:    rsync -a --delete rsync://somectan/somepath/systems/texlive/tlnet/ /your/local/dir

No <scheme> or "://"  in the pre-test syntax but instead a "::" after <somemirror>; might this explain the problem ?

As far as I can see, texosquery-jre8 should be allowed in the restricted

However, the following plain TeX document only works if the call is

  pdftex -shell-escape test

Here's the test.tex file:

Hi,

the version of lualatex in pretest doesn't seem to anything with the
--shell-escape flag.

Compiling a simple document with minted loaded for example will complain
that I need to compile with --shell-escape despite actually having done so.
the same document compiled with pdflatex compiles fine.

I am running on linux 64bit.

Dear Greg,
could you provide a small file which allows others to reproduce your

I don't think it's an engine problem, this plain tex file


\directlua{os.execute('ls')}

\bye



lists the current directory just if luatex --shell-escape is used, but I
can confirm that this
latex file gives the warning that -shell-escape must be used, even if it is
used

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{minted}

\begin{document}

z

\end{document}


so I guess that one of the packages in chain isn't detecting the new luatex
settings.
too late to debug tonight:-)

Hi Reinhard

sure. this document does it for me:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage{minted}
\title{test}
\author{me}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\end{document}

compiling it with lualatex --shell-escape gives an error, pdflatex
--shell-escape works fine.

Cheers

I have found a bug in lstatslib.c, and luatex-core.lua.
See attached lstatslib.c.diff, and luatex-core.lua.
There may be related places which need changes.

UNIV: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.

This did not appear to be the root cause of the problem (but it is nonetheless a potential source of confusion, and the change in syntax should be documented).  I finally overcame the problem by adding "-L -v " to the command-line incantation -- "-L" avoided the symbolic link error (the documented incantation would appear to assume that symbolic links are supported on the target file-system) and "-v" allowed me to observe progress.

New bug reports :

1) Using "install-tl-advanced.bat", and click-and-drag in (e.g.,) the TEXDIR dialogue box does not clear the inverse-video "selected" indication when a character is typed

this is an incompatible change in luatex

<http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/36800640#36800640>

\directlua{print('shell-escape = ' .. status.shell_escape)}


\bye

if run with no --shell-escape option returns texshell-escape = 2 in
2016 an texshell-escape = 1 in 2017

so pretty much anything doing a status enquiry (minted, eps inclusion,
the shellesc package, ....) is broken

I'll take to luatex list

Rsync supports both, i.e. the two expressions are equivalent.

nor can it be found in the "Environment variables" section of the system properties inspector.  What leads the installer to believe that it is set ?

This is one level deeper than the installer is willing to create.

It is created by the batchfile wrapper. We shall exclude it from the

I accept that, yet find it very odd; it is the */only/* application (of hundreds, if not thousands, installed on my machines) that fails to respect the host O/S standards for the user interface.  Surely I am not the only user who routinely re-locates the various TeXMF trees from their default locations with every new release of TeX Live.  I may be the only person to report the problem, but I am certain that I am not the only one to be inconvenienced by it.

It happened to me twice today; on the first occasion it finally dismissed the box after eight or nine clicks; on the second, not even 20 would suffice, so I had to resort to the [X] button.

Is there any reason for that restriction ?  A 3-level hierarchy such as C:\TeX\Live\2017 seems very logical to me, and allows the parallel trees C:\TeX\Live\2016 and C:\TeX\Projects.  Without the necessary-and-sufficient three levels, my C:\TeX\Live\TeXMF\Local tree would be forced one level higher, to C:\TeX, whereas it in fact a part of TeX Live rather than TeX /qua/ TeX.

But why is it set to E: when I am installing on C: ?

We are not happy about it ourselves, but I see no simple remedy.

If you do have C:\TeX\Projects, then c:\TeX would normally already
exist, and you would not run into this.

It points to the perl of the installer, not the perl of the
installed system. Long ago, we tried setting environment variables
in windows from within perl, but that did not work right. But
setting them in the wrapper has the unfortunate consequence that
perl noes not see the original environment anymore.

It is with high probability the only one using Perl/TK. Mac users complained about the same visual incompatibilities, and a nice soul wrote a front end to tlmgr that adheres to the UX standards.

Feel free to contribute your front end adhering to the Windows UX standards

You installed TL two times?

Anyway, the reason is that there are IO intensive operations running that block the GUI responsiveness. Unpacking a big package takes time and CPU cycles, and unless the installer is not reprogrammed to use threads it will not be more responsive. So hitting cancel 20 times is like a small baby (my 1+ year old is in this phase now) who doesn't get immediately what she wants.

Please try a bit of patience!

Yes, because we think two levels is enough.

In your case you only have to have c:/TeX bring available to get going.


Enjoy

Thank you.  (I am delighted to report that XeTeX, at least, continues to function as I would wish).  But I have failed to move successfully "texmf-dist" to the location I would prefer (C:\TeX\Live\TeXMF\Dist)  without breaking everything, even after modifying C:\TeX\Live\2017\texmf.cnf"; is it possible ?

You can choose whatever language is fine for you.
Adam wrote TLU in ObjC (AFAIK).

Possible for sure, but you need to know kpathsea and how it finds its
first texmf.cnf ...

I have to add that Norbert just wrote "new bindings" that makes it
hundred times easier to do so.

For the TeX Live Utility for Mac OS X see:
    http://amaxwell.github.io/tlutility/
    https://github.com/amaxwell/tlutility

Those sources are not yet using the new interface.

Yes, Objective C and C, so none of it will be useful
for Windows. I suggest making a native Windows app
so that users get the look and feel to which they're
accustomed:

Nor will they :). Norbert's shell is great, but would
be complicated for me to wrap, as we discussed offlist.

Alectron (https://electron.atom.io/) allows to write a cross-platform GUI
which looks like a native app. There are two problems:

1. I am not sure whether it is available for all platforms supported in TL

2. The GUI will have to be rewritten in JavaScript

I just mention its existence but I know that such a change would require a
lot of work and I am not sure wheter its benefit is worth the effort.

OK, may I ask how one learns what those "new bindings" are and where to find them (and their documentation) ?

The first link I completely failed to understand (well, the contents thereof, I mean); the second seemed clear enough but appeared to require the use of "git" (which I don't have, and with which I am completely unfamiliar) in order to find the sources.  But on reading the prose it would seem that in order to replicate Maxwell's work for Microsoft Windows one has to be familiar with Windows GUI programming, which I am not.  The most portable interface would, I suspect, take the form of a locally-served web page, but because a browser runs in a secure sandbox I cannot see how it could trigger the appropriate actions in the command-line installer unless there were also a local ASP.NET server.  So for the moment at least I am stymied.

I could not see what point was being made there.  Presumably that was a screen-shot of Microsoft Word 2003 with all toolbars displayed concurrently, but in real life one exposes toolbars only selectively, so apart from demonstrating what all toolbars displayed concurrently would look like, what was the reader intended to infer ?  At least in Word 2003 one /could/ expose the necessary-and-sufficient set of toolbars for the task(s) in hand; in more recent versions, that fundamental requirement has been tacitly jettisoned and replaced with a distinctly user-unfriendly  so-called "ribbon" interface in which one has to continually re-select orthogonal ribbons in order to accomplish even the simplest set of tasks.

That would seem to be /exactly/ what I would need.  Now I feel inspired/motivated to investigate.

No. You can browse the sources online.

Well, yes. In order to write a program one also has to be familiar
with at least one (suitable) programming language, I guess. You have
tons of options, there's no need to know the lowest level command.
There's Qt, wxWidgets, Tcl, Gtk, ATL, WTL, MFC, .Net, Visual Basic,
Delphi, the suitable bindings in almost any scripting language, ...
the list goes on and on.

If talking about a webpage, you could use CEF (Chromium Embeded
Framework) and get full access to the system. It wouldn't give you the
native look and feel though unless you try really hard with the CSS.
But then you need to know all of it: C++, HTML, CSS, JS, build tools
like CMake, ...

Thank you.  I now realise that when it says "Use GIT or SVN ...", it is not in fact necessary to use either (explicitly, at least); the entire source directory can be downloaded as a ZIP file, but the expanded results are horrendous (dozens, if not hundreds, of individual files).  Are C programs always like this, or can one write a single-source C program of equivalent complexity expressed as a single file containing multiple procedures ?  (You will gather from this question, if it was not already obvious, that I have no knowledge of C whatsoever).

Zden?k's "Electron" would seem to be an alternative to this, and one that requires only a knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with all of which I am extremely familiar.  I shall investigate Electron, I think.  But I still need to know how one learns of Norbert's "new bindings", or even the old ones; where are they to be found, and where are they documented ?

It is similar to writing a book in TeX. You can put each chapter in a
separate file and use \input to include them in the main file or you can
put everything in a single file. It is the same in C/C++. When writing a
larger program I prefer splitting the code into several files.

Tools as git or svn help you to keep the history. I do it even when working
on a TeX document and it helps me to collaborate with colleagues. We use
LaTeX even for writing grant proposals. Of course, you can work without
versioning.

I tried yesterday night: I downloaded MacTeX and installed it
on a MacMini (Intel) running 10.5. Only x386_64 binaries were
installed, not universal-darwin.

Do you mean i386 or x86_64?

There's no x386_64 and universal-darwin no longer exists. MacTeX (dmg
installer) no longer supports anything below 10.10.

You can try:

wget http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar xvzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl<complete_the_rest>
./install-tl -repository http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/

# or: [sudo] ./install-tl -repository
http://ctan.ijs.si/mirror/tlpretest/ [-gui]

(or follow the instructions for rsyncing everything first)

And then add the path to binaries to PATH.

The "sudo" and "-gui" are optional, -gui probably doesn't work unless
you installed Perl/Tk and you only need sudo if you want to install to
a folder where you don't have write permissions. If you install as a
regular user, you should configure the paths (you can also install to
/tmp/texlive for testing).

> Norbert's "new bindings"

Try
	tlmgr shell
You need to (in your program)
* open a pipe to "tlmgr shell"
* read the output of the program
* send commands and interpret the output

Sample session that can be done after asking all the questions
$ tlmgr shell
protocol 1
tlmgr> set repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
OK
tlmgr> load remote
OK
tlmgr> set machine-readable 1
OK
tlmgr> setup-local /path/to/new/installation		WARNING: not implemented
OK
tlmgr> install scheme-full
...
OK
tlmgr> quit
Thanks for playing.
$

Note that for now the
	setup-local
is not implemented.

But you can start by writing a front end for tlmgr itself, that would
be already great, and all the functionality is available via tlmgr shell.

Documentation: tlmgr man page (you know by now what a man page is, we 
explained it to you already), or the generated web page on tug.org.
All the actions can be done in shell, too.

Enjoy

I wanted to check what they are using. Apparently
(https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1170) the project still
depends on some part of Chromium (Content module,
http://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module), it's just packaged
in a more user-friendly way, to make the barrier to entry lower.

Sadly this is not an option for older versions of Mac OS X as it
requires 10.11 to build it and probably 10.9 to run it. They have
pretty hard requirements (not even C++11 alone is sufficient).

It should be installed with tlpretest already.

Umpf, all these npm node stuff, I am always very suspect of them.
Too unstable, unclear, in flux.

I am thinking more of a python/gtk or so, or native C.

If you need just pipes for communication with tlmgr shell, you do not need
any special npm modules.

Do not count out Tcl/Tk. Recent versions (8.6.6) feel much more
native than Perl/Tk, which is based on 8.4.

The 2007 TL GUI was written in Tcl/Tk.

Ah, so the TeX Live installer and the TeX Live Manager are one and the same thing ?  I don't think I had ever fully realised that.

Yes, the need for "npm" worried me too -- I am still trying to find out how one installs "npm" in the first place -- but overall the solution seems a good one :  HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a very simple and straightforward way in which to express a limited-choice GUI.  As regards backwards compatibility for (e.g.,) earlier versions of the Apple Macintosh operating system, is this an issue ?  Can users therefore not continue to use the older installer, whilst more up-to-date users could use the new one if/when written ?  Just as we offer "Install-TL" with various options (GUI, Advanced, Microsoft Windows, ....) could we not do the same with different GUIs (GUI, Electron-Gui, etc.) ?

npm is a part of node.js, you find the installer on
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/. I tried on Windows 7 and the
installation  reported a conflict with Acrobat Reader DC. It said that it
will unintall AR and it will have to be installed manually again. I
confirmed, installation of node.js was completed and Acrobat Reader DC
still worked.

No. This year MacTeX dropped support for old OSes, so one can no
longer use the old installer. And Perl/Tk on Mac is both non-trivial
to install and looks super ugly. Of course you can always say that we
should not bother about those users who can always install TL2016. Why
would they want the latest TL binaries if they refuse to upgrade or
buy new hardware?

It's just that I would find it a pity to spend a lot of time writing a
new GUI that would hardly benefit anyone and would not be really
portable.

As for the users of the latest macOS: why would they use another
installer if the existing one works perfectly? Unless that new
installer would be really *top*.

 distributions as well)
Message-ID: <7F903926-E02C-444B-B932-BAAA6DA5A333@gundla.ch>

Hi all,

I've tried to link an external library to LuaTeX, but this gives an error. This problem is an old problem described here:

http://tracker.luatex.org/view.php?id=555

I quote from the page:

------------------------------------
When building LuaTeX without --nostrip (which is the current default behaviour), loading external libraries is a game of luck. For example the sqlite3 bindings from http://luaforge.net/projects/luasqlite/ [^] create a library on OS X that require the symbol _luaL_argerror to be defined in the LuaTeX binary:

error loading module 'lsqlite3' from file './lsqlite3.so':
    dlopen(./lsqlite3.so, 2): Symbol not found: _luaL_argerror
  Referenced from: /Users/patrick/Downloads/lsqlite3-7/lsqlite3.so
  Expected in: flat namespace
 in /Users/patrick/Downloads/lsqlite3-7/lsqlite3.so

Building LuaTeX with --nostrip solves this issue.

By having "--strip" the default in build.sh, it is not possible for any user (on OS X, perhaps also on other platforms) to use this (and other) external library without downloading the LuaTeX source, download XCode, compile LuaTeX and put LuaTeX in the correct place.

Howdy,

Today's update brought a new xindy to my TL 2017 pretest. But I can't get it to run. I get

$ texindy --version
xindy release: 2.5.1
texindy script version: 1.13

and don't know why it's missing. This is under macOS 10.12.4 (Sierra).

Can I temporarily copy the version from Tl 2016?

Good Luck,

I grabbed xindy.mem from the pre-update TL 2017 pretest version and xindy is now working. So the update removed xindy.mem but didn't replace it. I don't know if the occurs on other systems.

Message-ID: <d0d0a69f-319e-306e-244c-d4552746cbad@gmail.com>

Dear tex-live list members (especially Reinhard),

I'm currently considering about improving CJK opentype/truetype font
support for tlgs (that is, ghostscript bundled with texlive win32),
and some questions arised.

Here is what I learned about current tlgs:

* distributed with pre-generated cidfmap (called cidfmap.TeXLive)
* Resource directory is built into the binary

IMHO, this framework cannot fully support CJK fonts available on
TeX Live or Windows.

[1] How can we embed CJK opentype fonts with dvips+ps2pdf?

An example:

kanji-config-updmap-sys --sc fandol
uplatex chinese-test
dvips chinese-test
ps2pdf chinese-test.ps

% ===== chinese-test.tex
\documentclass[uplatex]{jsarticle}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage[main=japanese]{pxbabel}
\begin{document}
\foreignlanguage{schinese}{????????}\par
\end{document}
% =====

(the command "kanji-config-updmap-sys" is used for choosing
  "fandol" preset of font mapping.)
the resulting PDF file is wrong, because it does not show any
Kanji characters. This is because ghostscript is not set up
properly. To get a correct result, we should tell tlgs the path
of opentype fonts to be embedded:

c:/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/fandol/FandolSong-Regular.otf

However, I cannot find any way of doing that.

[2] Can current distribution support both windows7 and windows10?

An example: on windows 7, "MicrosoftYahei" family is bundled in ttf format,
but on windows 10, it is bunled in ttc format. Current cidfmap.TeXLive
has an entry for ttf format, so it fails on windows 10.

p.s. Norbert and I are considering about adding windows support
for "cjk-gs-integrate"; it is a perl script to generate symlinks
and resources required for ghostscript to use CJK opentype/
truetype fonts. It would be better if we can determine which
font file (ttf or ttc) should be used for each installation.

Hi,

Just to add that the error also occurs on Linux. So it doesn't seems to be
OS dependent

Cheers

Yes, I can see that for project to which multiple contributors are expected, keeping each functional module in a separate file makes sense; unfortunately the naive user, coming to the project for the first time, then has no idea which file to open in order to gain an overview of the program's operation unless it is given a really obvious name (which seems not to have been done in the case of Maxwell's TeX Live interface), and this problem is exacerbated if one has no idea what the various extensions mean (".h", ".m" and so on).

Hmmmm ... let me count ... around early 70ies .c became common for C
source code, that means, you haven't been actively programming for
nearly 50 years.

I am deeply impressed with your eagerness to write a GUI with that

I have /never/ programmed in C (thank God), but I continue to program in JavaScript, C-sharp, Algol 68 (and, of course, TeX) to this day.  And I was still programming in Pascal, Fortran, VAX/VMS assembler and so on well into the early 90's -- not everyone leapt on the C/Unix bandwagon.

"Eagerness", no -- I have better things to do with my time -- but a willingness to /try/ to contribute to TeX Live's development, even if you personally believe that a lack of familiarity with single-letter extensions and what is, to my mind, the most execrable programming language even to have been let loose pose an almost insuperable obstacle to success.  Writing a Windows GUI from scratch, I would regard as an impossible task(for myself); attempting to write one with the add of a framework such as Electron would seem not only to be potentially achievable but also interesting, challenging and worthwhile.

Howdy,

Using the version from TL 2016 doesn't work. However I did grab a copy from a TL 2017 pretest before the update and that seems to work just fine. 

I don't use xindy much except for testing some packages (e.g., glossaries) and occasional use with xelatex.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Hi Patrick - sorry, but I am not enthused about distributing an
unstripped luatex in TL. There's the annoyance of a special case in the
build, and the downside of occupying extra space for the benefit of a
tiny percentage of users.

In addition, being able to load .so files is immediately and completely
insecure, so the fact that it fails with the TL does not seem bad to
me. (Of course, this is just random "semi-security", not anything real,
but I'll take what I can get. If there was some way to configure
"disallow loading .so's", I think it should be set in TL.)

Overall, it seems to me that people who want to use .so files should be
able to build from the sources themselves, or get a binary
elsewhere. --best, karl.

Hi all,

I just want to chime in here, Hironobu has explained the problems,
I just add a few things:

> * distributed with pre-generated cidfmap (called cidfmap.TeXLive)

I think this is not so much a problem. In case we adjust cjk-gs
tools we can cater for that.

> * Resource directory is built into the binary

This is a serious problem.

Reinhard, would it be possible to recompile gs in a way that the
resource dirs are not compiled into the binary?

We (Japanese TeX users) recommend that, otherwise overriding
several items and installing fonts for CJK use is not possible.
(See https://www.preining.info/blog/software-projects/cjk-fonts-ghostscript/
for details).

> [2] Can current distribution support both windows7 and windows10?

This could be solved by running cjk-gs-integrate for tlgs after 
installation.

> p.s. Norbert and I are considering about adding windows support
> for "cjk-gs-integrate"; it is a perl script to generate symlinks

Indeed, we should continue there ... lost it completely out of the mind,
sorry.

Norbert

Our interested CJK fonts are only searched in Resource/CIDFont, Resource/Font.

Please test
http://www.w32tex.org/toolsw32/tlgs.zip
if it is usable or not as tlgs.

fonts and lib directories are those of the present TeX Live tlgs.
bin,  iccprofiles, kanji, Resource directories are from my gs921w32full-gpl.exe.
All dirctories are needed, but the directory kanji is not used usually.

annoyance? It is an advertised feature of LuaTeX which works on Linux and Windows, but not on Mac. So I'd consider this a bug. If I remember correctly, linking on OS X works for some modules but not for others. 

> and the downside of occupying extra space for the benefit of a

a) I am not sure if this actually increases size of the binary (significantly) First this seems to be a problem on OS X only and I have read some reports that this does not increase the size, depending on the command line arguments given to strip. But I have to investigate further. This comes up on the LuaTeX mailing list once in a while and on the web (tex.stackexchange.com). 

b) How many users must be affected by a bug to work on a fix (which is a very trivial fix)?


> In addition, being able to load .so files is immediately and completely

so is linking to .so files worse than shell escape?

Both can be switched on and off, so in a secure sensitive environment one can turn it off. And I can't see a security gain if this works on Windows and Linux, but not on Mac.

> Overall, it seems to me that people who want to use .so files should be

I disagree. Being able to use software like mysql directly from TeX is a \HUGE benefit of LuaTeX. I have gotten several emails in the last years discussing the ability do this. 

Sorry that I keep insisting, I believe this would be a very good thing if we can fix this.

the size increase is about 1MB on OS X (just tested here with "strip -u -r" which makes the luatex binary work here). I hope this is not the worth the discussion.

Unpacking a big package takes time and CPU cycles, and unless the installer is not reprogrammed to use threads it will not be more responsive. So hitting cancel 20 times is like a small baby (my 1+ year old is in this phase now) who doesn't get immediately what she wants.
After introspection and further testing, I do not believe that this is the cause.  At the time that the <cancel> fails to take effect, no packages are being installed.  The dialogue box in question is the "Enter path for TEXDIR"  box, and having used left-mouse-down-at-right-end followed by drag-to-left-extreme [1], the <cancel> button has no effect no matter how many times repeated..  Transferring focus to another window or process and then restoring it to the dialogue box is sufficient to allow <cancel> to have its intended effect.

I seem to remember that fully stripping some binaries (was it
wget/xz/asy?) reduces their size for about a factor of ten. Shipping
such unstripped binaries is definitely a no-go. But if we are talking
about 1 MB, I fully support the idea of doing this is an a way that
would let users be more creative when using (Lua)TeX, it's hopefully
just a matter of figuring out how to patch the build scripts to do the
right thing.

It would be interesting to compare the result of the size of the full
set of TL binaries on various platforms:
- without strip
- with "strip -u -r"
- with "strip"
and then decide how exactly to patch. If partial stripping is only
relevant for LuaTeX and increases the size of other binaries for some
significant amount, we could change the patch accordingly. If size
difference is irrelevant and "strip -u -r" works on all platforms, we
could use that everywhere.

It would also be interesting to create some really minimal test that
we use on multiple platforms for checking whether this dynamic loading
of libraries works as expected.

Just my two cents.

(I have no problem taking care of that "manually" for the platforms
I'm building for, but you probably need that for the latest version of
macOS and it would be much nicer to fix this for everyone, not just
for a single platform.)

On MacOS El Capitan, man strip says:

              "When  strip  is  used  with no options on an executable
file, it checks

       that file to see if it uses the dynamic link editor.  If it  does,
the
       effect of the strip command is the same as using the -u and -r
options."

Are you able to confirm that the same scenario elaborated in a non-Windows context results in a successful cancellation at the first attempt ?  Such confirmation, if available, would make such an error report more useful.

Yes, absolutely no problem on Linux. Response time to pressing the Cancel button
is 0.

I already wrote in a previous mail that I could not reproduce it
either (on Windows).

Worked fine the first time.

Failed a second time, but clicking once or maybe twice in an empty
area of the text was sufficient to deselect the text. Subsequently,
abort worked just fine.

I could accomodate you as to an enterprise edition. Instead, I used
my 64-bits w7 pro.

In view of the inherent imperfections of Perl/Tk, I do not consider
this glitch worth making a fuss about. But if you want to file a bug
report, be my guest, especially if it stops you from further nagging
this list about this dialogue.

And Phil: please keep the xetex list out of this.

OK, I have Ultimate and Enterprise here (TeX Live 2017 only on Ultimate so far) , but upgraded all my Professionals while it was still possible, so do not think I can find a Professional against which to test.

If I could identify the version of Perl/TK that is used in the TeX Live distribution I would do so, but so far I have failed so to do.

No idea how XeTeX came to be included at some point; that was clearly not my intention.

====================
BUILD PLATFORM

64-bits Windows 7 SP1 running under VirtualBox on
Linux.

GETTING THE PERL SOURCE

I downloaded the latest stable Perl source 5.24.1 from CPAN.

THE COMPILER

The file README.win32 in the root of the distribution contains
compilation instructions, which lists various supported MinGW
distributions. I used mingw64-w32-gcc4.9.2_20150513.zip from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ and
32bit_dmake-4.12.2-bin_20140810.zip from
http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/32_tools/
====================

All modules were freshly downloaded via metacpan,org, unless I
already had the latest version. For [Perl:]Tk:

https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Tk/Tk.pod

Hi Phil,
a few days ago you said that you can abort any process immediately on
Windows.  Today I had to remove a few files and directories at work
using the Windows Exploder.

A dialog box popped up saying "preparing for deletion...".  A quarter
of an hour later I pressed the [cancel] button.  Nothing happened.
Then I pressed the cancel button in the title bar.  No immediate
response either.

A few minutes later the message changed to "aborting...".  After the
lunch break there was still the same message and I had to shut down
the system with brute force.  Removing the stuff with Cygwin took only
a few seconds. 

I mention this because I encountered this problem just a few days
after you said that such things work perfectly on Windows.  And I
encounter such or similar problems every day.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As I wrote in a previous mail, you may have to change
runscript.tlu a little. See an attached runscript.tlu.diff.
But I don't know it works or not.

No, I can't cross-compile gs on my main system.  If Debian provides a
gcc cross-compiler which can create binaries for Windows I could try
it on one of my Raspberries. 

Does it really hurt when the resource dirs are compiled into the
binary?  The (incompable) fonts are compiled into the binary too, but
when I provide lib/Fontmap the fonts *I* provide are used.

So I'm wondering whether ghostscript insists on built-in resources
even if they are available on the file system.

Sorry, I've missed your previous mail. It works fine with
your patch. Thanks.


Dear Reinhard,

Yes. As Akira wrote, "Our interested CJK fonts are only searched in
Resource/CIDFont, Resource/Font." There is a need to install
whatever CJK opentype fonts we like, *exactly* into these dirs,
so Resource dir should be available for users.

 > The (incompable) fonts are compiled into the binary too, but

Addition to lib/Fontmap is not valid for CJK opentype fonts.

In the case that you decide to use gs for windows compiled by me,
you may be able to remove incompatible fonts in my tlgs/Resource/Font,
which probably are not used because of your lib/Fontmap, but please
don't remove the directory tlgs/Resource/Font itself. The directory
tlgs/Resource/Font will be used by Hironobu and Norbert for files
for "composefont".

/Something/ (I wot not what) awful happened to the Windows file system w.r.t. Windows 7;
mass deletions now take an eternity, for reasons that are beyond my ken.

There is a real difference between the mass-deletion scenario in Windows 7 and the cancel scenario for the TeX Live installer; for the latter, the cancel is /ignored/, not heeded but actioned after an interminable delay (if at all).

But let us move on -- work on an Electron-based installer is looking very promising, and I will report more if/when I succeed in integrating it with the non-GUI installer interface.

you are right. Using the default ./build.sh script seems to be fine (for linking libraries). My observation is, that there must be something different done to the binary in the texlive distribution. 

Who packs the OS X binaries into texlive? Is there any preprocessing step done after running ./build.sh in the LuaTeX directory? Or is the build script different from the original LuaTeX one?

I see, but I don't understand what is going on there.

Is there a difference in the build process (or in the linking process) compared to the build.sh script from LuaTeX? 

(I have tried tl2017 on Linux and my testfile seems to work there, but not on OS X.)

OK, modulo the bindings to the non-GUI installer, all the rest of the infrastructure is now in place with one key exception :  I need to populate the Installation collections window.  I could obviously do this by hand, but somewhere in TeX Live there must be a file or files that define its contents, and define how the selected options change when the Scheme is changed, but I can find neither of those.  Could someone familiar with the present GUI installer please tell me where that file or those files are to be found, and their names, please ?

AFAIU, all the information is in tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb. Lines `name
scheme-...' define schemes. tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPDB.pm has methods for
tlpdb files.

But maybe you had figured out this much yourself. I guess Norbert can come
up with more specifics.

If you take a look at LuaTeX's build.sh, you'll notice the following lines:

    STRIP=strip
    case `uname` in
      Darwin     ) STRIP="strip -u -r" ;;
    esac

The TL's build script is way more complex, but in principle it runs

    make world

and that one runs

    make install-strip

See Makefile.am and aclocal.m4.

I suspect that it should be possible to do

    export STRIP="strip -u -r" ./Build

but it would be even better if the default strip command could be
replaced when compiling on Mac (and for Mac rather than with some
cross-compiler).

OK, so I go from (e.g.,) "name scheme-full", noting its shortdesc "full scheme (everything)" /en route, /via (e.g.,) "depend collection-basic" to "name collection-basic" and its shortdesc "Essential programs and files" and similarly for all the other dependencies.  That shouldn't be too hard, 'though it will be interesting to see how large the necessary associative array will be in JavaScript.  If I build the latter iteratively rather than trying to soak up the entire TLPDB as a  monolith it shouldn't be too large, but I will try the monolithic approach first just to see what overheads are involved.

Hi Philip.

Simply list all the packages of the tlpdb named "collection-..."

> I could obviously do this by hand, but somewhere in TeX Live there must be a file

Yes, it is called texlive.tlpdb and contains all information you need.,

> OK, so I go from (e.g.,) "name scheme-full", ...

I think I have explained this in several talks and articles in TUGboat.
But for you I do it again:
There are three levels of packages in TeX Live:
* normal packages (practically everying) indicated by the tlpdb
  key/value
  	category Package
* collections (indicated by the package name "collection-???" *and*
  by the tlpdb key/value 
  	category Collection
* schemes (indicated by the package name "scheme-???" *and*
  by the tlpdb key/value
  	category scheme

"Schemes" are overlapping collections of TeX Live packages. They can
depend on "collections" and "packages".

"Collections" are non-overlapping collections of TeX Live packages,
they can depend on other "collections" and "packages", but it is 
guaranteed that the same package is *not* included in two different
"collections".

(Note that I put quotes on purpose to distinguish between the
defined concepts in TeX Live, and general mathematical concepts)

That should give you most of the necessary information (besides the
rest of the tlpdb, like executes ...)

Enjoy

Norbert

Hi Siep

Now install-tl-windows.bat does not work with the following error:

"win_version" is not exported by the TeXLive::TLWinGoo module
Can't continue after import errors at C:\Users\kmaeda\Desktop\install-tl-20170422\install-tl line 64.

I think that install-tl should be fixed according to the changes of TLWinGoo.pm (rev. 43941).

Best regards

Fixed by removing this import, r43976. Should show up tomorrow.

Hello all,

I installed TL'17 on my Mac a few days ago ('vanilla' TL, not MacTeX). I
see that /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf.cnf doesn't have any 'real'
content, whereas in previous years it has

    TEXMFHOME = ~/Library/texmf
    TEXMFVAR = ~/Library/texlive/2016/texmf-var
    TEXMFCONFIG = ~/Library/texlive/2016/texmf-config

i.e. adjusts the various variables to use the standard OS location for
these items. Is this change to be expected?

Summary of my attempts so far on a Mac Mini (Intel) running Lion

1. Installed MacTeX
2.It has no binaries for i386-darwin
3. Downloaded the TeX Live installer for Unix
3. Installed the Perl module Digest::SHA
4. Launched the installer, using a minimal scheme (plain and latex)
5. Fixed the symbolic links in
/Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs so texbin points
to i386 which points to the binaries for i386-darwin
6. Tested a file with pdflatex: successful compilation
7. Tested a file with LuaLaTeX: successful compilation
8. Installed xetex with tlmgr
9. Tested the same file: successful compilation

Ciao

on which platform are the macOS binaries built? With which strip command?

It seems to be that we are close to a proper solution. No objection has been raised to my statement that 1MB increase in size would fix the bug of the broken macOS distribution of LuaTeX. Now it looks as if it is just a matter of placing the correct strip command in the right place. Can anybody help here?

Thanks

Since this year on 10.6 for x86_64-darwinlegacy and on 10.10 for
x86_64-darwin. (It used to be 10.6 for x86_64-darwin.)

Unless someone did anything about it, the strip command is simply
"strip", whatever that resolves to.

It has always been this way. Only MacTeX uses the ?personalized? local TeX

It depends on which change you are talking about.

This was indeed to be expected until a few days ago, the paths you
mention have never been default anywhere but on MacTeX.

However exactly the opposite has changed two days ago:

This will hopefully not be necessary (we'll probably publish a script

Hi,
I just see what went wrong.  Because I don't have Windows and thus
can't compile the binaries myself, I install the Windows distribution
of Ghostscript using Wine on my machine and. 

However, the Windows version seems to be crippled.  I can see the
directories you mentioned in the sources (ghostscript-9.21.tar.xz) but
they are not included in gs921w32.exe.

  /home/reinhard/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/gs/gs9.21:
  total used in directory 104 available 30231864
  drwxr-xr-x  9 reinhard users  4096 Mar 20 00:54 .

  drwxr-xr-x  3 reinhard users  4096 Mar 20 00:54 zlib

My scripts currently just put the bin/ and lib/ directory into tlgs/
and add a font/ directory containing the URW fonts maintained by
Walter Schmidt.  I'll adapt them now so that they copy the missing
directories from ghostscript-9.21.tar.xz (the source distribution) and
we can adapt runscript.tlu accordinly.

But which files in these directories are actually needed?  In
Resource/Font I see Nimbus* and URW* and I don't know what they are
good for.  Resource/CIDFont doesn't contain any Japanese fonts.  How
do they get there?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Ulrike,

    ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest

FWIW, I get "verified" with that location.

    (not verified: gnupg not available)

The installer cannot find a usable gpg. The code is in
tlpkg/TeXLive/TLCrypto.pm, notably test_one_gpg. Essentially, it calls
"gpg --version" and sees if it exits successfully. It looks for gpg in
PATH, and calls it with the absolute file name (on Windows). It also
checks the name "gpg2", and can be overridden with the envvar TL_GNUPG.

Using -v should show (lots of) stuff about what it's doing ...
hope the problem can be found ... -k

I checked in texlive 2016: there was a gpg.exe in
\texlive\2016\tlpkg\installer\gpg. (It was not in my path). 

But in texlive\2017 I can't find something similar.

libpng, openjpeg, and zlib are maybe considered as garbage. However,
the distribution is complete barring the garbage. All other necessary
directories in the sources are in the binary gsdll32.dll.

I think that you had better simply use one compiled by me, which does not
include Resource etc. in the binary gsdll32.dll, with your fonts directory
and lib directory. Double resources in the gsdll32.dll and in another
directory may easily introduce confusion and troubles.

They are fonts which are incompatible from our point of view.
I also don't know what they are good for.

> Resource/CIDFont doesn't contain any Japanese fonts.

Available CJK fonts will be installed by Norbert and others.

For Nimbus and URW, fontconfig on 'nix knows about these and
documents them in 30-metric-aliases.conf (they are versions of common
fonts).

Not sure what the gs versions are used for nowadays.  I think they
might be just a legacy from before fontconfig.  But I don't have any
PS printers, perhaps those might need them.

As you say, nothing to do with Japanese.

Dear Reinhard,

> Resource/CIDFont doesn't contain any Japanese fonts.

If you are using Debian or some unix, you can run by yourself

sudo cjk-gs-integrate --link-texmf --force

to see what is necessary for CJK users. You will find many
symlinks in Resource/CIDFont and snippets in Resource/Font,
and they should be created at users' site for each installation.

will also help you. Currently it does not support windows due to
lack of tlgs Resource dir, so we are requesting to preserve it
instead of compiling it to binaries. (we're already preparing
https://github.com/texjporg/cjk-gs-support/tree/win32-support
to support Akira's tlgs on win32.)

Hi Joseph,

others have answered, but although I was involved in these changes,
I couldn't grasp the meaning from the emails immediately without
much thinking, so here my version:

>     TEXMFHOME = ~/Library/texmf
>     TEXMFVAR = ~/Library/texlive/2016/texmf-var
>     TEXMFCONFIG = ~/Library/texlive/2016/texmf-config

The texlive/YYYY/texmf.cnf file is created by the normal installer
when during installation some settings are changed from the default
in the systemwide (texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf) and contains only
the changes, not the whole texmf.cnf.

MacTeX usually installed the above changes to conform with Mac
standards.

Up to 2 days ago, the normal TeX Live installer did *not* do this
automatically, but left it to the user to change these settings.

2 days ago (Mojca sent link) after some discussion we decided to
change the default TeX Live installer to automatically use the
above locations instead of the standard ones when running on Darwin.

THus, if you do a new installation from current tlpretest, you should
again find the above file.

Hope that helps

Norbert

Hi all,

I finally have a small test file to try it out:

this is the file lib.c:
-----------------------------
#include <lua.h>
#include <lualib.h>
#include <lauxlib.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>


static int testfunc (lua_State *L)
{
  const char* str = "Hello world!";
  lua_pushstring(L, str);
  return 1;
}


int luaopen_foo_lib(lua_State *L) {
  struct luaL_Reg myfuncs[] = {
    {"testfunc", testfunc},
    {NULL, NULL},
  };
  lua_newtable (L);
  luaL_setfuncs (L, myfuncs, 0);
  return 1;
}
------------------------

and this is the LaTeX file:

-----------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luacode}
\begin{document}
\begin{luacode*}
foolib = require("foo.lib")
texio.write_nl(foolib.testfunc())

\end{luacode*}
\end{document}
------------------------

The instruction to build on macOS is:


------------------------
cc -c  lib.c -I /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lua/5.2.4_1/include/
cc -flat_namespace -bundle -undefined suppress -o lib.so lib.o
------------------------

(adjust the path to the Lua header files)

and then copy the result into a directory "foo" relative to the TeX test file above:

------------------------
cp lib.so <path to test.tex>/foo/lib.so
------------------------

Now lualatex test.tex should print a "Hello world" to the console:

------------------------
....
(/opt/texlive2017/texmf-dist/tex/luatex/ctablestack/ctablestack.sty)))
(./test.aux)
Hello world! (./test.aux))
 360 words of node memory still in use:
   2 hlist, 1 vlist, 1 rule, 2 glue, 4 attribute, 45 glue_spec, 4 attribute_lis
t, 2 write nodes
   avail lists: 2:7,3:1,4:1,5:5,7:1,8:1,9:1
....
------------------------


Now: this does not work on my machine using the tl2017 binary, but with a self compiled binary from the LuaTeX source. 

It looks to me as if it _not_ a matter of stripped / not stripped but something different, which I have still no idea what it could be.

I have a sort of deja-vu. I wonder if I asked the same already last
year. In any case: on my PC where I have an external gpg in the path
it works, and I will install your package on my laptop asap.

Hi Ulrike,

Not the very same, but the deja-vu is correct. We introduced this
feature in pretest 2016 and you were one of the early testers and
adopters. So it was installed all the time since pretest 2016.

Patrick Gundlach,

I'm the guy who compiles the Mac binaries for TeX Live. This year I'll compile on Yosemite for
Yosemite, El Capitan, and Sierra, and these are the binaries that will be in MacTeX and BasicTeX.
Meanwhile, Mojca Miklavec is compiling binaries for older systems.

One of my rules has been that TeX Live for the Mac is exactly the same as TeX Live for all
other platforms. I never reach in and "twiddle a source." This is to counter the persistent
rumor that Mac users think they are different and their hardware isn't standard and ...

Your experiments are very interesting.  I'll compile them and test later today, since 
they imply that compiling on the Mac breaks luatex. That case doesn't fall under my
philosophy(!!)

In the meantime I want to return to the security issue which Karl raised in the
original messages on this issue. I haven't studied the language used by Lua, but it looks like the
test function could do more or less anything, and your example calls luatex without the
equivalent of --shell-escape. What am I missing?

Thanks all for the clarification: must have copied it 'forward' from an
earlier MacTeX-based set up (I set up TL'16 'directly').

Hi,
I just uploaded the missing files and your binaries and applied your
patch to runscript.tlu.

However, I suppose that

  --    ..os.getenv('WINDIR')..'/Fonts;'..TEXMFDIST..'/fonts')

, what you commented out, is still needed, at least the last ")".

If gs doesn't look into subdirectories we have to add more paths to
GS_LIB but I can't test it here.

Regards,
  Reinhard

your and Karl's concerns are valid, of course. LuaTeX provides the command line switch --safer to disable the module loading.

I fail to understand why security is given if module loading works out of the box on Linux but not on Mac, which is the status quo.

That I remembered. But I had forgotten that you had setup a personal
repository for gpg and that I installed on my laptop gpg from there
(I found your old posting now:
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2016-April/038039.html)

Perhaps it would be a good idea to extend the installation
instruction for windows with a "you need gpg and how to get it"
section.

But is it true that one /needs /"gpg", Ulrike ?  My understanding was that it was completely optional, and I for one have never felt any need for it.

If one wants to get rid of the warning which started this thread
then yes. My wording was a bit short but I trusted Norbert and the
others of the texlive team to be intelligent enough to add the
necessary "ifs" as in "if you want verification then ...".

Ah, "if you want to get rid of the warning" ... That is rather different, and now I understand.  From your earlier message I had thought that "gpg" had become essential w.e.f. TeX Live 2017.

Thank you very much!

I propose some small improvements:

[1] There are duplicate file names,
* lib/cidfmap and Resource/Init/cidfmap
* lib/Fontmap and Resource/Init/Fontmap

For simplicity and better compatibility with unix-like systems,
please move (or merge?) the ones in lib/ into Resource/Init.
Also, it would be nice to move lib/cidfmap.TeXLive and
lib/Fontmap.TeXLive to Resource/Init.

[2] Although the directory Resource/Font is empty, it should
be kept in svn repo forever. To prevent an accident, putting some
stub (like README) would be helpful.

The situation is now much better than before! I will be glad to
write cjk-gs-integrate with win32 support in a couple of days.

Dear Hironobu,
yes, duplicates are awful and should be avoided.

But there is one thing we have to consider:  There is a DVI viewer for
Windows called "dviout" which probably has hardcoded paths to tlgs
directories, in particular to lib/.  I once made a little change and
someone told me that I broke dviout.  We have to be careful. 

I don't have Windows, hence I can't test dviout myself.  But I can
test everything else here if I install Ghostscript on Linux exactly
the same way as in TeX Live for Windows.

Akira, can send me the output of ./configure e.g., what it prints to
screen?  

I'd like to build a test bench for Ghostscript.  Any files which help
me to test CJK support are welcome.

Not necessary.  The directory Resource/Font is copied from the
ghostscript sources, hence it will always exist.  It's my script which
removes all files therein in order to avoid clashes with the fonts we
provide.  And even if Ghostscript devopers decide to drop the
directory, my script will issue an error message.  Don't worry.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm not on Unix, so I cannot run ./configure.
I don't even install TeX Live itself, so I cannot be
a tester, very sorry.

dviout didn't come to my mind, and I don't use dviout so testing is
difficult for me. However, good news:
I tested with r44032, and found that removing the ones in Resource/Init
is enough, because ghostscript can read lib/cidfmap and lib/Fontmap.

So, please remove Resource/Init/cidfmap and Resource/lib/Fontmap.
Then, I can adjust cjk-gs-integrate to work with lib/cidfmap.


And, one more comment: current lib/cidfmap has

%EOF

with no new line at the end of file. Our cjk-gs-integrate has to parse
this file, and that will become much easier if there is a new line.


All the best,
Hironobu Yamashita

Hi Hironobu,

Done (rev. 44039).

Sigh!  I'm aware of this problem and the sole purpose of the "%EOF"
comment is to remind me.  Maybe I'll better tell Emacs to warn me when
I attempt to save a text file without a trailing linebreak.

Thanks for your hints.  I hope that everything works now and you can
proceed with cjk-gs-integrate.  I'm offline from Apr 28 to May 3.  If
you encounter any problems during this period I'll care about them
when I'm back from TUG-2017.

  Reinhard

Don't ask me why. It's true that some minor changes have been
introduced during the last night, but in my case the binary size
actually *decreased* during the last night after I added "strip -r
-u". (I didn't try to compile exactly the same sources twice though.)

before: 360392
after:  346984 (with STRIP="strip -r -u")

Can you please do some further tests with binaries from svn
(x86_64-darwinlegacy)?

I think I have successfully added win32 support for cjk-gs-integrate on 
GitHub.
I will announce it in the next mail, along with a small test case.

Subject: [tex-live] Multiple files and synctex not working
Message-ID: <B4BCCF1B-AD9B-41BC-88D6-4E4208D7F926@gmail.com>

Dear all,

Sorry if my message does not belong here but I have no idea where to report this bug. 

I have an issue with synctex and working with multiple files. More precisely, I have a main file main.tex and three files (one for each chapter) chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex and chapter3.tex. I use "include" in main.tex to add the chapters to my pdf. I have also several figures in my first chapter, they are tikz pictures that I define in separate files (figure.tikz for example) that I put in chapter1.tex with "input".

Doing this, synctex does not work in the third chapter, but it works fine in the first and second one (I tried it on macOS 10.12.4 using texshop and Atom+Skim+latexmk). 

It seems to be a known bug : for examples, see https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/t34931/texworks-synctex-works-only-partially
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/350266/texmaker-inverse-search-error?noredirect=1&lq=1

But the answers do not work for me. Is there someone maintaining synctex to whom I can report this bug ?

Thank you

Hello,

I'm using Tex Live 2016 on OSX Sierra 10.12.4. The Tex Live Utility (1.26) had been working fine for me until a couple of weeks ago. Since then, it connects to the configured repo, spends the expected amount of time doing an apparent query and then reports that no updates are available. A quick look at CTAN shows that there are plenty of updates going in all the time, and it behaves this way regardless of the repo I choose so I assume the problem is at my end. 

Any suggested remedies are appreciated. 

Thanks.

	cjk-gs-integrate support)
Message-ID: <A1A1B93B-9F05-4B5A-AB2A-72A12B36A5C2@gmail.com>

Dear all,

With the help of Reinhard and Akira, I added win32 support for cjk-gs-integrate.
It can set up CJK opentype/truetype fonts for use with ghostscript.
Obtain test version of cjk-gs-integrate.pl from GitHub (win32-support branch),

https://github.com/texjporg/cjk-gs-support/tree/win32-support

and put it under TEXMFLOCAL/scripts/cjk-gs-integrate.

It also supports all common unix-like systems (like Debian and Solaris),
in addition to Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10 and macOS 10.12.x Sierra.
Please test with up-to-date TeX Live 2017 pretest (later than r44039).


Instructions:

1. run
  cjk-gs-integrate --force
as administrator privilege, to generate gs resources.
That means, windows users should start command prompt as administrator.
and for unix users (except for cygwin) sudo is needed.

2. prepare the following cjktest.tex:

\documentclass[uplatex]{jsarticle}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage[main=japanese]{pxbabel}
\begin{document}
Nimbus\par
\textsf{Nimbus}\par
\texttt{Nimbus}\par
???????????\par
\textgt{???????????}\par
\foreignlanguage{schinese}{????????}\par
\foreignlanguage{schinese}{\textgt{????????}}\par
\foreignlanguage{tchinese}{????????}\par
\foreignlanguage{tchinese}{\textgt{????????}}\par
\foreignlanguage{korean}{??, ?????.}\par
\foreignlanguage{korean}{\textgt{??, ?????.}}\par
\end{document}

3. run
  kanji-config-updmap-sys ipaex
  kanji-config-updmap-sys --sc fandol
  kanji-config-updmap-sys --tc arphic
  kanji-config-updmap-sys --ko baekmuk
to set up map files for dvips (sudo will be required for unix).

4. run
  uplatex cjktest
  dvips cjktest
  ps2pdf cjktest.ps
to obtain cjktest.pdf. It should be a document with Japanese/
Simplified Chinese/Traditional Chinese/Korean fonts embedded.

5 (optional). if you see some "standby" status when executing
one of the followings:
  kanji-config-updmap-sys status
  kanji-config-updmap-sys --sc status
  kanji-config-updmap-sys --tc status
  kanji-config-updmap-sys --ko status
then switch maps by executing e.g.
  kanji-config-updmap --ko unfonts
and test 4. again.


Please report any results. If it's successful, then Norbert or I will
register the new version on CTAN. Thanks.

The freeze issue is actually listed if you run the TL manager from the commandline (TeX Live Utility is a Mac feel front end of sorts for tlmgr)

sudo tlmgr update --all --self

I get this message

TeX Live 2016 is frozen forever and will no
longer be updated.  This happens in preparation for a new release.

If you're interested in helping to pretest the new release (when
pretests are available), please read http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.
Otherwise, just wait, and the new release will be ready in due time.
tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.uib.no/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)
tlmgr: saving backups to /opt/texlive/2016/tlpkg/backups

If will then install updates if there are any left missing before the freeze.

It seems TL Utility does not this for this freeze and inform the user.

Perhaps you should inform the maintainers of the TL utility tool for Mac

TeX Live 2016 has been frozen in preparation of the 2017 release, due June.

TLU does show this, but not as an "alert".  It shows up in the log window (which you have to open; I always keep the log window open, to see what might have gone wrong when things don't go as expected).

Believe me, I know. There's no robust way to present tlmgr error/warning messages; all I get is an exit code, and I don't want to rely on parsing tlmgr log messages.

The tex-live mailing list is for problems relating to the TeX Live distribution, not for the individual components.  You can always use the "texhax" list, and if there is a better place, someone will let you know.  See the TUG home page for details.

I have found that there are times that synctex doesn't work, but generally, the answer seems to be out-of-sync between source and synctex files.  At the risk of asking the obvious, did you try removing the "aux" files (in particular, foo.synctex.gz)?

Hi,

is there a way for a sysadmin, reluctant to install on its Debian server
a vanilla TL and to update it, to install an up to date TL 2016 (I mean
its "frozen for ever" version) via an ad hoc repository?

All the best.

Jerome Laurens is still maintaining synctex. He's committed a number of
nontrivial changes to fix that \pdfxform issue, among other things. They
initially had unfortunate ramifications, but we all hope the bugs are
fixed now, and things should be better after tonight's build. -k

What do you mean? Vanilla TL and the "up to date TL 2016 - frozen for ever"
is the same, absolutely.

If you ask for *Debian* packages made from these very files, sorry, no.
I don't have time to build them. The latest packages available in
testing and unstable are very close to the final frozen status of TL2016.

Sorry for the imprecision:

1. by vanilla TL, I meant the one installed from the TeX Collection DVD
  or the official `texlive2016.iso' file (available since 23-May-2016)
2. by "frozen for ever", I meant the previous one installed but updated
  after a recent `tlmgr update --self --all' (with the message "TeX Live
  2016 is frozen forever and will no longer be updated.  This happens in
  preparation for a new release.").

I'm not sure to understand: the latest packages available in testing
and unstable are very close to 1. or to 2. above?

Thanks!

Ok, in this case there is no DVD/iso version of what is in the frozen state.
The last tlnet dir is the only source, and is currently still on CTAN,
and will be later available on some archives.

Very close to 2.
Differences:
* updates of normal packages have stopped a bit earlier due to
  freeze of Debian pre-release
* binaries are more uptodate with many bugfixes backported into
  the Debian packages

Could let me know what's the command line(s) to run in order to
get installed what is very close to 2?

Dear Hironobu,
with the attached Emacs Lisp file and the line

  (require 'insert-eol-at-eof)

in ~/.emacs I suppose that I can avoid such problems reliably in the
future.  Maybe other Emacs users are interested too.  There is an
Elisp variable "require-final-newline" but I prefer to be asked
whether I want to append an EOL or not.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hurray. I tried the example in the old bug report and one from
tex.SX and they work in texlive 2017 (but fail in miktex and texlive
2016), so it looks as if the bug(s) are really gone. Thanks!

I have still problems with texstudio and its pdf viewer: when I do "Go
to PDF" in txs then the corresponding place in the pdf is found,
however, clicking on the same location to "Go to source" brings me to a
different place in the source file: other file, other section.

I just tried the example from here
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/263105/synctex-fails-for-input-files-related-to-fancyhdr-graphicx
with the newest texstudio (2.12.4) and the "go to source" to the
input file works fine with texlive but not with miktex. 

This is on windows 10, if you have another OS it could be that you
didn't got the updates yes.

Message-ID: <56e813c2-af1f-fc47-e3c5-616167b9353b@gmail.com>

Hello,

I try to compile some documents with pdflatex (pdfTeX, Version 
3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017)).

pdflatex crashes with the simple document below (segmentation fault).

%%%%%%%%
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{fadings}
\begin{document}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%

I use Ubuntu 17.04 (zesty).

Sincerely,

    pdflatex crashes with the simple document below (segmentation fault).

I think you have one of the buggy interim pretest versions. Neither the
current x86_64-linux nor i386-linux pdftex binary in the pretest
crashes for me.  (Instead there is a "dangling objects discarded" msg.)

Unfortunately the version numbers don't distinguish, but the file sizes
of those current binaries are:
2382744 Apr 27 00:08 i386-linux/pdftex
2214600 Apr 27 00:40 x86_64-linux/pdftex 
(don't take the dates too seriously)

Thanks for the report. -k

I get that dangling object warning with the 2015 and 2016 (release)
i386-linnux binaries too, so I'm not inclined to worry about it.
Though it doesn't show up with the 2014 binary ... k

My version was:

I reinstalled pdftex and now I have:

I (on windows) get  the warning with 2014 too (and 15-17). But as it
is an empty document anyway I wouldn't worry much. The warning
disappears if I add content to the page.
