I'm using a simple patch to avoid this crash.  The problem is that
gcc-7.1 *does* align if specified but lua52 lua_touserdata() does
not return an aligned type at all.

Ok, I'll add "depend chemgreek" to mhchem.tlpsrc after the release (soon).

Hi,

whether I do texlua -v or luatex --credits, I don't get the information
about which Lua interpreter is used.

How can I get that ?

I hesitated where to post that, finally here (avoiding double-posting)

Thanks,

Thanks Philip in the mean time I found the trick of texlua foo.lua
with foo.lua a one line file print(lua.version)

no easier way?

(that one can use from a shell script for example)

Luatex is always (till now) compiled with lua 5.2 since they use an adapter version.


No need to check anything, you know you will get 5.2.

It seems to me that JFBU is very wise in wanting to be able to test with /which/ version of Lua LuaTeX has been compiled, since it may well change again in the future.

Should, of course, have read "What about /pre/-version 0.75 ?".

I think you'll find, Norbert, that JFBU is far more concerned about /future/ version changes than historic.  In the absence of any definitive statement from the developers that LuaTeX will be compiled with LUA 5.2 for the remainder of eternity, I continue to believe that JFBU is very wise in wishing to be able to easily check which version.

Hi Phil and Norbert,

thanks for the kind help. JFBU indeed thinks luatex is deficient
into not being able to inform straightforwardly the user about
a core component as "lua -v" would do,
but JFBU also thinks that Luatex is never going to become a part
of his future either.

Thanks again,

Jean-Fran?ois

Dear Jean-Fran?ois,
nothing is impossible if you're on Unix.

Try this on the command line:

  echo '\directlua{print(lua.version)}\end' | luatex | sed -ne '/^\*\*/s/..\(.*\)/\1/p'

You can use this code in a shell script, of course, and you can even
assign the result to a variable:

  luaversion=$(echo ....)

You have to call luatex because texlua expects a script.  But it
doesn't matter because texlua is a symlink to luatex anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

thanks Reinhard, this does it indeed 
but has the effect of a texput.log file created

as in Phil's report ...

now, some rm texput.log clean  up is needed

I briefly looked at texfot but from its man page I deduced
it is not a way to inhibit texput.log, it only analyses
TeX console output

and I am not aware of any command line option to the
*tex binaries which would mean "do not produce a log file"

there is -output-directory which can be used to dump them
I guess in /tmp

Hi,

1. apologies because I tried to post to tlbuild but
   later thought I should not, as an end-user.
   probably it will get moderated away which is better.

2. since then I found a post by Mojca
   http://tug.org/pipermail/tlbuild/2017q2/003831.html
   explaining some background precisely on my question

3. contents of message:

at least on x86_64-darwinlegacy and possibly also x86_64-linux

(there I only checked the man page because

dvisvgm: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by dvisvgm)
dvisvgm: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by dvisvgm)

but I am used to the fact this Ubuntu 16.04 has lots of problems
and it is out of my control)

it appears that TeXLive 2017 will still be with dvisvgm 1.15.1

Is this the case with other architectures ? (or how can I check that?)

Hi Jean-Fran?ois,

For x86_64-linux I can answer: I'm building the binaries on a very old Debian system, but dvisvgm requires a new compiler, which normally comes with a new glibc etc etc. 

That means that all but dvisvgm and asy are fine in even very old systems, but those two need a bit newer ones.

If you can build binaries of the two on old systems, please do so and send me them.

I guess for the other archs it is the same.

Hope that explains a bit

Norbert

ok, I learned the issue from Mojca's post to tlbuild about darwinlegacy

If this is feasible I will, but I can't in immediate future.

 I hope no admin rights needed ?
the x86_64-linux I have access to is installed on very strange network and I am not sure actually
where is physically located the CPU running the processes (my sysadmins have explained
at least thrice over the years but I still do not understand)
(take it just as a hint that I may not be fully qualified for the task)

I do understand naturally that binary builds have constraints related to architectures.
More problematic probably than
the `-o` problem with dvisvgm is that its 1.15.1 release does not support TL2017 xetex

You don't need admin rights for compiling TL (unless compiler and some
other build prerequisites are missing), but you don't even need it to
install TL.

A more important thing than the binary itself would be figuring out
which linux distribution & version and which compiler to use to be
able to compile dvisvgm (C++11) while retaining as much backward
compatibility as possible.

We didn't know this at the time of compiling TL 2017 binaries. When
weighing between having outdated software on a legacy platform and a
non-functional binary on older platforms, I decided for an outdated
binary. But if that's a problem with that, I guess I can fix it. The
options are:

- build with the latest clang against libc++ which will only work on
10.7 and later (or theoretically also on 10.6 with libc++ installed
manually / with MacPorts)
- figure out if -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 would work with the latest
gcc to link against the system libstdc++

The fastest way for you to get it working would be to compile dvisvgm
yourself with CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++".

To avoid confusion: In 2017, the x86_64-darwin OS X binaries have dvisvgm 2.1.3 and are for users running macOS 10.10 or later. Mojca is providing binaries for older Mac systems: powerpc-darwin, i386-darwin, and x86_64-darwinlegacy.

I would say that it would be a reasonable feature request to add the
version of Lua to the end of this list:

$ luatex --credits
This is LuaTeX, Version 1.0.4 (TeX Live 2017)
The LuaTeX team is Hans Hagen, Hartmut Henkel, Taco Hoekwater, Luigi Scarso.
LuaTeX merges and builds upon (parts of) the code from these projects:
/.../
Compiled with libpng 1.6.29; using 1.6.29
Compiled with zlib 1.2.11; using 1.2.11
Compiled with poppler version 0.52.0
Compiled with mplib version 2.000

It should be pretty straightforward to do that and the list is way too
long already, so another line would not even be noticeable :).

Hi Norbert

regarding x86_64-linux, I can only connect over ssh to the machine at work.

$ dvisvgm --version
dvisvgm: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by dvisvgm)
dvisvgm: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by dvisvgm)

$ which dvisvgm
/longpath/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux/dvisvgm

Thus I looked
at its man page and it reports 1.15.1. Then I checked 
directly the file

/longpath/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/dvisvgm.1

and it is indeed the 1.15.1 one.

Hence I do not know which version of dvisvgm is installed there.

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Use anonymous as a usert name and your e-mail address as a password. It
seems that the web browser somehow caches the credentials so it asked for
login, I cancelled it, accessed the server from command line and the next

Is texlive 2017 using 2016 in multiple places?  Directories? 
Documentation? Installer?

=======================

I was starting to install texlive 2017 on a linux box.  I followed the 
link at:

https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

and I downloaded the installer.  I'm using the installer 
install-tl-20170413, which came from the mirror:

http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/

The file was last modified on 12-Apr-2017.

When I run the installer using

install-tl -gui

the gui is not the same as Figure 3 in:

https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#installation

Instead there is 2016 wherever there was a 2017 in the Figure. In 
particular, the title is TeX Live 2016 Installation.  Also, TEXDIR is 
/usr/local/texlive/2016, and so on.

Is this the 2016 installer or the 2017 installer?

I tried downloading it again to see if a different mirror might have a 
different version, but it was the same.

Is this the correct installer for texlive 2017?  If not, am I looking in 
the wrong place for the 2017 installer?

===========

The quick install documentation suggests a pre-install cleanup:

rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2016
rm -rf ~/.texlive2017

Should the first be 2016 or is texlive 2017 being installed in that 
directory?

BTW, the full installation documentation does not mention this cleanup.

==================

Thanks,

--Bob

Have a look at <http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/
tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb>. You will see, it's still TeX Live 2016.

You should wait at least till tomorrow. A lot of mirrors still have TeX Live 
2016.

Hello George, *,

well, first of all, I have to apologise for answering this late. :( I
was into too many projects -- both, private and business -- that kept me
from looking into the problems much earlier. Again, sorry about that. :(

Now that it's that time of the year again, I had a look at the new
MacTeX version prior to the new release, and I must say, of course,
George was right. My $PATH had indeed been corrupted by MacPorts. I
managed to fix it, and everything works fine again.

You can install MSYS

  http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys

on Windows in order to get sed.exe

The command

  sed -ne '/^\*\*/s/..\(.*\)/\1/p'

replaces

  | This is LuaTeX, Version 1.0.4 (TeX Live 2017/W32TeX) 
  |  restricted system commands enabled.
  | **Lua 5.2
  | 
  | warning  (pdf backend): no pages of output.
  | Transcript written on texput.log.

by

  | Lua 5.2

MSYS also provides a lot of other quite useful tools.

Unlike Cygwin, MSYS only depends on MSVCRT.DLL and the only
requirement is that the supplied programs are in %PATH%. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

I suppose that texlive2016* will be removed soon.  Everything else
makes sense.

Formerly, and still.

No, it doesn't. I've seen this happen when an ftp client wrongly
interprets a connection failure as "needs a username/pw", when the
actual error (as reported) is "limit of available anonymous connections
reached, try again later".

I intentionally restrict the number of simultaneous anon connections to the
tug ftp server because spiders, browsers and others commonly (ab)use it.

FWIW, I haven't yet seen a need to restrict rsync access, and the entire
ftp tree is available through rsync too ... -k

    Hence I do not know which version of dvisvgm is installed there.

The x86_64-linux binary in TL17 is dvisvgm version 2.1.3.
I compiled it on centos7. It's unfortunate about the libc requirements,
but that's life with C++11.

I guess I decided to leave the man page as the old version for the sake
of the platforms that didn't update. There's no way to have different
per-platform man pages in TL.

You can run strings dvisvgm | fgrep 2. to see a bunch of numbers, but
admittedly there's no way to know that the "2.1.3" output there is the
program version number. Oh well. --karl

Hi,

Ok, then it was probably just the additional release traffic.
I was using chrome.

Perhaps it just takes a while until all mirrors catch up after the TL17
release. I also saw that (at present) the tlnet subdirectories are in a
kind of "mixed" state on some mirrors.

On the CTAN root node texlive/Images/ looks fine:

<ftp://ftp.dante.de//pub/tex/systems/texlive/Images/>

It's possible that the mirror doesn't use the --delete flag with
rsync. In that case one should contact the maintainer of the mirror.

Indeed. The strange point is, the mirrors are supposed to be mirrored
and I guess the root one never was in a mixed state.

But wait and see...

Hi Karl

I see.

One could imagine having the two man pages ready and
then a symlink decided at install time would resolve
between the two ?

similarly there could have been perhaps a dvisvgm1 and a
dvisvgm2 and at install time, the bin/dvisvgm would have been
symlinked to the correct one admissible for the platform ?

or even a dynamic check of glibc requirements deciding
which binary to symlink to at install time ?

(on platforms where compiling dvisvgm 2.1.3 is too problematic
both legacy and current could have been the same binary file)


> You can run strings dvisvgm | fgrep 2. to see a bunch of numbers,...

This works fine.

By the way, dvisvgm --version returns

dvisvgm (TeX Live) 1.15.1

with no mention of 2016 or 2017

and

dvipng --version has more output inclusive of
kpathsea version.

but does not say explicitely either whether 2016 or 2017

I understand I am asking for a priori redundant information
but as TeX Live has yearly releases it could be argued that
just having TeX Live in version string is not informative enough.

Some people have multiple TeXLive not all installed by themselves
(there was a time where there was system wide TL2004, TL2007,
all masked by my own TL2015 install)
and debugging problems can be easier where version information
is as complete as possible (without becoming too verbose, naturally)

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Not necessary.  The TeX Live 2016 images disappeared from CTAN (Dante
node) a few hours ago.  The mirrors will be in sync soon.

Programs that are not developed in the TeX Live repository are
just imported as is and only minimal (necessary) changes applied
(dvisvgm), while programs developed in TL can/have been changed
and thus give more detailed information.

Feel free to submit patches to both TL and upstream authors
for better reporting.

No, I don't think so. 

IIRC, each year when Karl puts the new texlive image into the
system/texlive/Images/ directory there exists both the new iso and the
previous' year iso for a day (or at most two).  Then the next day Karl
drops the older iso (presuably by a script) and things are back to
normal.

So, it is just the case that the mirrors have to catch up.

Hi Jean-Fran?ois,

you can get more verbose version information if you set the optional
argument of --version to 1 (or "true" or "yes"), e.g.

$ dvisvgm -V1

dvisvgm 2.1.3 (x86_64-pc-linux)
-------------------------------
brotli:      0.6.0
clipper:     6.2.1
fontforge:   20160721
freetype:    2.8.0
Ghostscript: 9.20
kpathsea:    6.2.2
potrace:     1.14
xxhash:      0.6.2
zlib:        1.2.11

Martin

Dear all,

I've just updated my installation of TeXlive 2017 and have a minor issue
with my multi-lingual letter format in Koma-Script 'scrlttr2'.

Until now I had 'USenglish' and 'UKenglish' in the list of selectable
languages (among others), but 'pdflatex' refused to find 'USenglish.ldf'
and 'UKenglish.ldf'. There are, however, both files in all-lowercase
'usenglish.ldf' and 'ukenglish.ldf'. The language selectors themselves
are unchanged, so all I had to do is adjust the list of options in
'anschrift.lco' for Koma-Script.

Is this to be expected after the recent round of package updates? I did
not find anything in this respect for 'babel-english' on the
CTAN-Announcements list nor in the Babel documentation.

Cheers, Andreas

Hi Martin, thanks.

Are you using a system with case-sensitive file names?

Yes, english has changed and now proxy files are used. I'm on
MS Windows, so I didn't catch this problem. I'll try to fix it
asap.

While this is all nice at true, it only applies to a single binary and
from what I understand, TL 2018 will probably require C++11 anyway, so
any huge hacks invented now will be obsolete by the time of TL 2018
(and won't reach many users of TL 2017 who happen to download the ISO
images or install from DVDs anyway). This is the first time that we
ever shipped different versions of binaries.

Probably a much better option would be to simply provide binaries
somewhere for download, so that users can fetch an alternative binary
(just once) if needed.

I can try to figure out if I can compile dvisvgm for Mac OS X without
having to depend on libc++, but for the time being it's probably
fastest if you compile it yourself. If you refuse to upgrade your OS
to a supported version (OS X 10.9 is out of support window), you need
to live with / handle consequences :)

This is indeed the best solution.  TeX Live should provide something
which works everywhere, even if it's not the latest release.  tlmgr
supports external repositories like

   http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/

already.

Message-ID: <d44e796ec578fd597e2f7e7126aae9e3.squirrel@box386.bluehost.com>

The docs for TL 2017 say that installation "profiles" have some slightly
different variable names.  They also seem to say that we can continue
using the old ones.

In practice, this does not seem to be the case.  I tried it, by modifying
an existing profile for TL 2016 and simply replacing "2016" with "2017"
wherever it occurred.  But install-tl flamed out with an error about
unrecognized variable names:

Message-ID: <CALBOmsafEGHc0LjeqcfS3=cb_JhmJsDC_ftzM9_LLBznUBLZQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to suggest creating a small GLIBC/GLIBCXX lcompatibility
table for different versions of different Linux distributions. Plus
the list of available compilers (and maybe the difference based on
which compiler is being used).

I volunteer to collect the data together, but it would help if someone
(Karl, Norbert?) would tell how exactly to test and then we could
collect some statistics. Maybe Nelson would be willing to provide the
output of some simple tests files from various exotic machines, but
getting data from some common Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS machines should be
doable without too much effort.

This would be useful in the future for:
- picking the most suitable OS to do the builds on
- knowing in advance which OSes will be compatible with it.

I can help with Fedora, if you tell me what to do. I have a few computers
with old versions that were not updated for some reasons. I also have two
Raspberries with different versions of Raspbian.

  Have you looked into the available information?  This page, for
example,

	https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/timeline/glibc/

has a list of glibc versions with notes on backward compatibility.
Probably not enough, but it?s a start.

  That page also sounds interesting (?Running new applications on old
glibc?):

  Best,

It's macOS 10.12.5.  I'm not using the darwinlegacy packages.

Below is the entire profile that works fine on TL 2016, but which fails
with TL2017.  (I first replace "2016" with "2017"  in the dirnames for the

I started the little game on this Ubuntu 16.04 where I have no admin rights

$ readelf -V `which dvisvgm` | grep 3.4.15
  010:   2 (GLIBC_2.2.5)   5 (GLIBCXX_3.4.15)    6 (GLIBC_2.3)     4 (GLIBCXX_3.4)

  0x0090:   Name: GLIBCXX_3.4.15  Flags: none  Version: 5

$ readelf -V `which dvisvgm` | grep 2.14

  0x00e0:   Name: GLIBC_2.14  Flags: none  Version: 13

$ readelf -s `which dvisvgm` | grep 2.14
   251: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND memcpy at GLIBC_2.14 (13)

$ readelf -s `which dvisvgm` | grep 3.4.15
    17: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND _ZNSt8__detail15_List_nod at GLIBCXX_3.4.15 (5)

This seems to indicate that to palliate 
$ dvisvgm --version
dvisvgm: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by dvisvgm)
dvisvgm: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by dvisvgm)


I would have to hack only the two memcpy and (?) _ZNSt8__detail15_List_nod functions 

If I had not two overdue over important deadlines I could try it out at least.

Don't know if LD_PRELOAD would be honored though. (I was even surprised readelf
was available; earlier when I connected over ssh I basically had nothing to
my disposable, I only did it to access a "push new files to work homepage" command)

I am very surprised about


2.14	2011-05-31	0/1/2/6

I didn't know this system on which I daily suffer (at least Firefox
works enough for buying train tickets) was that old.

this is weird as Ubuntu 16.04 is running on it and I thought
it was somewhat more recent than 2011.

Maybe there is some other reason it doesn't have (find) GLIBC_2.14

Dear getnonfreefonts users,
in the past it was possible to download the getnonfreefonts installer
once and use it with any version of TeX Live.

In TeX Live 2017 a few internals regarding map- and format-file
creation were improved and getnonfreefonts was adapted accordingly.

If you have TeX Live 2017 or any newer version, you have to download
and execute the latest installer from

  http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/

As from now there is no program getnonfreefonts-sys anymore, instead
you have to invoke getnonfreefonts with either --sys or --user.
You'll get an error message if you omit one of these arguments.

The reason for this change is that many users ran into trouble in the
past because they invoked getnonfreefonts accidentally though they
actually meant getnonfreefonts-sys.  See also

  http://tug.org/texlive/scripts-sys-user.html

The current versions of getnonfreefonts and its installer are supposed
to work with older versions of TeX Live too, but please don't install
getnonfreefonts again if an oder version is already installed.

Please let me know if something doesn't work as expected.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Umpf, indeed, several have been forgotten, sorry for that.
I will push changes to the repo so that the net installer fixes this.

Please wait a bit, and thanks for the report.

Is TL2017 not yet available at CTAN mirrors? Here's what I
get when I try to update from a pretest installation:

/usr/local/bin/tlmgr:

I've tried many mirrors and I get the same result. Also on
other systems.  

I presume I could re-install but I'd rather not have to do
that if the problem could be fixed more easily.

and ftp://ctan.math.ca/tex-archive/ does indeed indicate that there is no such second-level directory as "tlpkg" (without or without the double slash prefix/delimiter).

This double slash looks odd ...

Indeed, Probably just a wrong URL. In

  <ftp://ctan.math.ca/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/>

I see a proper tl17 repo.

Hi Bob,
the path is wrong, please try

 tlmgr option repository ftp://ctan.math.ca/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet

Yes, that works.  But then I suspect many links at 

https://www.ctan.org/mirrors?lang=en

are wrong.

But are those not links to CTAN hierarchies, Bob, rather than links to TeX Live installation repositories ?

The page titled Installing TeX Live over the Internet links
to that page:

  your best bet is to choose explicitly from the list of CTAN mirrors

with no explanation of how to navigate to a texlive
repository.

So would you not agree, Bob, that it is the documentation that is at fault rather than the links as earlier asserted ?

Yes. But perhaps the relevant script could be made more
robust by testing for a tex-archive path.

A few days ago there was a discussion about gcc7 and a patch was sent around.

Please check the archive.

Other than that we can't help you much. We are building on very old systems to ensure maximum compatibility, and this might simply be just another gcc bug as we had them already on several instances.

Good luck

Norbert

That looks wrong, there should be a tlnet in there somewhere. My guess is that this is simply not the correct url.

Hello Norbert,
Firstly apologies. ?The texlive archive didn't show up in my original search but after joining the list and emailing the out the request I found the thread. ?I have applied the patch to luaffi/ctype.c and luaffi/ffi.h and that has resolved the issue.
Many thanks for the reply and the patch. ?I can test with gcc-6.3.0 as well if people want (using gcc-7.1.0 currently).
Regards,Ross

 A few days ago there was a discussion about gcc7 and a patch was sent around.

Please check the archive.

Other than that we can't help you much. We are building on very old systems to ensure maximum compatibility, and this might simply be just another gcc bug as we had them already on several instances.

Good luck

Norbert

Wrong. Please see https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

Choosing a download host

It can take an hour or more to copy all the files, depending on the installation method. If you are downloading over the network, by default a nearby CTAN mirror is automatically chosen. If you have problems, it is good to choose a specific mirror and then run install-tl --location http://mirror.example.org/ctan/path/systems/texlive/tlnet instead of relying on the automatic redirection. 

The script is already doing auto-detection of mirrors etc, only if you 
pass in wrong URLs then there is not much one can do.

Best

Compilation using pdflatex consistently fails the same way (the precise
font is irrelevant):

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600

(see the transcript file for additional information)
!pdfTeX error: latex (file eccc1000): Font eccc1000 at 600 not found
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

Moreover I find the whole subtree
`texlive/2017basic/texmf-var/fonts/pk/...' in the directory where I
compiled.

Do you have the EC fonts installed? My guess is that the basic variant
does not contain enough fonts for your document.

(there was one `/` missing).

Hi,

I'd like to report a bug in tlmgr.pl.

It messes up relative paths to the files it needs during the execution.
Here is its output:
$ /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl --usermode search document.cls
Can't locate TeXLive/TLConfig.pm in @INC (you may need to install the TeXLive::TLConfig module) (@INC contains: /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/../../texmf-dist/scripts/texlive /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/../../tlpkg /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl /usr/share/perl5/site_perl /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib/perl5/core_perl /usr/share/perl5/core_perl) at /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl line 98.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl line 98.

OK, that is easy, it's going only two levels back (as bolded), but should do it three times. But I don't want to edit the code - it's looking for /usr/share/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLConfig.pm, so we can set PERL5LIB to /usr/share/tlpkg/, right? It helps, but not much:

$ export PERL5LIB=/usr/share/tlpkg/
$ /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl --usermode search document.cls
/bin/sh: /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/../../tlpkg/installer/config.guess: No such file or directory
/usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl: could not run /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/../../tlpkg/installer/config.guess, cannot proceed, sorry at /usr/share/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 231.

it fails looking for file "/usr/share/tlpkg/installer/config.guess"

I'm using ArchLinux and its packaged texlive-core version 2016.43757-1.

Yours,
Chris

This problem is fixed in mactex-basictex-20170607.pkg, which should propagate to mirror sites in a few days.

Hi

I just installed TexLive2017 on a Mac running OSX10.11.1. I am trying to place some custom macros where TexLive will find them. I tried
~/texmf
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
~/Library/texmf

None of these worked, contrary to what I thought I understood in https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-430005 ! In each case when my TeX file says \input macros, TeX says it can't find macros.tex that I placed in the above locations.

I did check that, when I place the macros in the same folder with the main .tex file, everything runs fine. 

Although I didn't change anything after installation, I did try
tlmgr conf
and confirmed that TEXMFLOCAL=/urs/local/texlive/texmf-local
                   TEXMFHOME=/Users/<me>/Library/texmf

By the way, the files I placed have permissions
-rw-r--r--@
and the folder texmf has permissions
drwxr-xr-x

So I'm stumped!
Thanks for any suggestions

If so, ~/texmf will not work, but /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local and ~/Library/texmf will work. These locations must have the same directory structure as TeX Live. So tex can find files in (or files in folders in)

	~/Library/texmf/tex

and pdflatex can find files in (or files in folders in)

	~/Library/texmf/tex/latex

Bibtex files are a special case; see the Q & A link on http://tug.org/mactex <http://tug.org/mactex>


Note that files in ~/Library/texmf will be immediately visible, but /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local requires running texhash afterward.

Subject: [tex-live] Issue on installation method "install-tl -gui=perltk"
 under Solaris 11.3
Message-ID: <CADG7YJ3Oy1+fVUxfckjwnwHGrufUGbes6eWx-VKxS3sZJdANSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Thank you for the product.

When attempting to install TexLive 2017 under Solaris 11.3 x86_64 I've got
the following message:

prime at desktop-01:~/install-tl-20170606$ ./install-tl --location
ftp://mirror.utexas.edu/pub/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/ -gui=perltk
Loading ftp://mirror..../systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
Installing TeX Live 2017 from: ftp://mirror.../systems/texlive/tlnet
(verified)
Platform: i386-solaris => 'Solaris on Intel x86'
Distribution: net  (downloading)
Using URL: ftp://mirror..../systems/texlive/tlnet
Directory for temporary files: /tmp/Oi0PB0CDRg
image file format "png" is not supported at
/usr/perl5/vendor_perl/5.12/i86pc-solaris-64int/Tk/Image.pm line 21.

After a while I brought the following solution I'd like to share with you.
Perhaps you may consider it a future fix.

Under the Solaris 11.3 x86_64, Tk::Photo doesn't support PNG or JPG files.
My solution was to convert the file to a BMP version 3 and adjust the script
<extract-dir>/tlpkg/installer/install-menu-perltk.pl
as follows:

*$ grep -n -i png install-menu-perltk.pl <http://install-menu-perltk.pl> *
24:#require Tk::PNG;
206:  my $img = $fl->Photo(-format => 'bmp',
207:  -file => "$::installerdir/tlpkg/installer/texlive.bmp");

I've converted the texlive.png file in the same directory as follows:
*$ convert texlive.png bmp3:texlive.bmp*

By the way, as a pre-requisit, I had to install a Solaris 11.3 package
named perl-tk-512:
*# pkg install perl-tk-512*

Best regards,
Carlos Azevedo.

If you're using LaTeX, install your files at

  /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex

or in a dedicated sub-directory

  /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/my_personal_macros
  
and run

  mktexlsr

in order to update the filename database.

    Yes. But perhaps the relevant script could be made more
    robust by testing for a tex-archive path. 

Hi Bob - I don't feel that heuristic tinkering with the given path is
desirable, ie, guessing if something is a CTAN mirror url minus the
tlnet or not.

    The page titled Installing TeX Live over the Internet links
    to that page:

I added a few words about the need to append "systems/texlive/tlnet" to
the top-level mirror urls given on ctan.org/mirrors. hope it
suits. --thanks, karl.

Hi Krzysztof,

    I'm using ArchLinux and its packaged texlive-core version 2016.43757-1.

I think you need to report this to ArchLinux. tlmgr is not intended to
be used by distros (they have their own packaging, after all...), but if
they do, it's up to them to adapt it ... --good luck, karl.

Yes, this is also to be expected, not only on solaris but most Unix

Not a bug in tlmgr.

You are not supposed to call tlmgr in this way. Tlmgr.pl expects to be invocated
from
	ROOT/bin/<arch>/tlmgr
which is a link to the above tlmgr.pl file. In this case it will find the
modules automatically.

If your distribution does not provide proper links, nor updates tlmgr.pl, then
it is best not to use tlmgr, or only in -user-mode !

Please report to arch linux maintainers

Babel now includes a directory with locale files for about 200

So a simple question - which is the best way to package,
distribute, etc., those files for them to be bundled with

I have several machines, most of them with Linux, one Mac and I might also
use it on Windows where symlinks do not work. For thsi reason my
texmf-local lives on subversion (git can be used as well) so that I can
update it on all my computers from a central repository. And, of course,
mktexlsr is important ufter udate.

When running

luaotfload --update --force -vvv

all TeXLive directories are scanned for fonts: 2017 _and_ 2016

How can I prevent the scanning of all main dirs except of the
current one of 2017 without deleting the old 2016?

I was using a shell in emacs, and I don't see it. But I do get the same 
message if using a command line.

The file mentioned (cygwin1.dll) is not the same, but I suppose that's 
because you are using cygwin.

Hi Herbert,
I suppose that you meant

  luaotfload-tool --update --force -vvv

I can't reproduce your problem on Linux.  That would be disastrous
here because I have TL-2003 ... TL-2017 installed.

  Reinhard

Asymptote for Windows was compiled under Cygwin, thus it requires

  tlpkg/asymptote/cygwin1.dll

and a few other shared libraries.

This is the reason why "cygwin1.dll" can appear in error messages even
if you don't use Cygwin at all.

  Reinhard

The cygwin1.dll was too old, and updated in r44526
in TeX Live. Try again after a few days.

Hi,

I was trying to use this
<https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/newspaper-slash-news-letter-template/wjxxhkxdjxhw#.WTm-xOv1AqM>
template on Overleaf but I got an error,

File `newspaper-mod.sty' not found. ^^M

I tried installing it by typing tlmgr install newspaper-mod as said in the
doc but that didn't work either. Do you know what could be the problem?

In-Reply-To: <59394C63.6070105@tex-tipografia.com>
Message-ID: <201706082209.v58M9F7Y000490@freefriends.org>

Hi Javier,

    Babel now includes a directory with locale files for about 200
    languages. They are in the tds bundle, but in CTAN are zipped.

I assume this is CTAN:macros/latex/required/babel/base/locale.zip
aka TL:texmf-dist/doc/latex/babel/locale.zip.

By the way, I see two spurious temp files in that zip,
#babel-be.ini# and #babel-de-AT.ini#.

    which is the best way to package, distribute, etc., those files for
    them to be bundled with TeXLive?

What you have in the .tds.zip looks fine to me as far as the locale
stuff goes.  But the .tds.zip has a separate problem:
makeindex/babel/bbglo.ist and bbind.ist (from bbidxglo.dtx) are missing.
Can you include those in the build? Then I could use the .tds.zip.

It's not critical, but I also see that the standard files, like
germanb.sty, mention compat/ in their comments:
%% This is file `compat/germanb.sty',
But there is no compat/ directory in the .tds.zip, or the source.
So it would be nicer if it wasn't mentioned -- just build the files in the
"top" directory instead of a compat/ subdirectory?

A second not-critical thing is that those same standard files say to
report bugs to Johannes, which has got to be wrong nowadays.

And one other question, just for information: who is maintaining all of
these new files? You? The individual babel-* maintainers, who feed
changes back to you? (The *.ini files have no bug-reporting information
at all, nor does the README-locale explain.)

In any case, it seems a step backward to return to having all this
information in one centralized package. You say in the README they're
essentially "finished" (except for the ones that aren't :), but it seems
highly improbable to me that they will need no maintenance. This is just
the situation we went through with babel the first time, when it was
unfortunately stagnant for many years due to centralized control.

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] how to get `tlmgr remove` NOT to make backups
Message-ID: <b160c81ff02730d4f36cec0d1846e0a7.squirrel@box386.bluehost.com>

It seems to be a new feature of TL2017 that `tlmgr remove foo` will make a
backup of foo.

I only want backups made when I `tlmgr update foo`, not when I `tlmgr
remove foo`.  So I consulted `man tlmgr` to see if there is some flag I
can pass to `remove` to prevent the backups, or perhaps a `tlmgr option
blahblah` that I could set once and for all to prevent the new behavior.

However, I can't seem to find any such information there.  What's more,
`man tlmgr`, under the "remove" action, then under the "--backup" option,
falsely claims that:  "[If] neither option is given, no backup will be
made."  (I suspect that's a copy-paste error, with the text taken from the
help for `tlmgr update`.)

So:

1. Is there a way to prevent backups being made during `tlmgr remove foo`,
*without* disabling backups for `update`?  If so, what is it?  If not,
there should be.
2. Can there be a `tlmgr option remove_wont_backup` that the user can set
once and for all to stop this?

I'll fix it, as well as the rest of the problems.

For the moment, I'm the maintainer. I'll continue developing babel
incrementally, and therefore I still need some control over the ini
files. They are auxiliary and won't replace the externally maintained 
language files (which, on the other hand, are just a few).

I meant version 1. I must point this out. Not only they will require
maintenance, but they will be expanded.

Not a bug in tlmgr.

You are not supposed to call tlmgr in this way. Tlmgr.pl expects to be invocated
from
ROOT/bin/<arch>/tlmgr
which is a link to the above tlmgr.pl file. In this case it will find the
modules automatically.

If your distribution does not provide proper links, nor updates tlmgr.pl, then
it is best not to use tlmgr, or only in -user-mode !

Please report to arch linux maintainers

Hello,

I found a difference in "mktexfmt" between unix and win32:

* mktexfmt runs "user mode" of fmtutil on unix (r43793)
* mktexfmt.exe on win32 runs in "system mode" (r44449)

Is this difference intended, and which behavior is better?

Thanks,

In the case of windows, it is expected that fmtutil-sys
may not be rejected if TeX Live is installed under a
suitable directory. Thus I decided to choose fmtutil-sys.

Anyway it must me quite rare that mktxfmt is called.

Does your more recent statement (i.e., the one cited at the beginning of the message) mean that if the situation encountered which led to our earlier correspondence were to re-occur, "mktexfmt" would now invoke "fmtutil-user" rather than "fmtutil-sys", and would I therefore once again have to run "fmtutil-sys" manually as you earlier recommended ?

Dear Philip,

The mktexfmt is called only if a relevant format file
is not found. If it is called, the format file is created
under
$USERPROFILE/.texlive2017/texmf-var/web2c/$engine
if the updated binary became effective.
Here $USERPROFILE is %USERPROFILE% in Windows notation.
$engine is the name of the engine such as xetex.

fmtutil-sys creates formats in the other directory:
TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFROOT/texmf-var/web2c/$engine.

When you run fmtutil-sys, please erase format file in
$USERPROFILE/.texlive2017/texmf-var/web2c/$engine
since formats in
$USERPROFILE/.texlive2017/texmf-var/web2c/$engine
are prefered compared with those in
TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFROOT/texmf-var/web2c/$engine.

Akira

Yes, that part understood.  But when we discussed related problems on 25/05/2017, the scenario we were discussing was a full install of TeX Live, rather than an explicit post-install user action.  So does the fact that "mktexfmt" now invokes "fmtutil-user" mean that, since "mktexfmt" is called (many times) as a part of a full TeX Live installation, all formats created as a result of that installation will now be in user space rather than system space ?

Subject: [tex-live] babel doesn't know USenglish anymore
Message-ID: <ohibvt$rr0$1@blaine.gmane.org>

Hi,

since an upgrade to TeXLive 2017, babel doesn't know the option
USenglish anymore. Using the option usenglish (lower case) works with
TexLive 2017, but does not work previous versions. The current
documentation of babel still calls the option USenglish (with upper case
US) and it seems that this writing is supposed to be the right one.

The problem is caused by the fact that the file installed by TexLive
2017 is called usenglish.ldf, not USenglish.ldf. This matters, on UNIX
at least. Ironically, usenglish.ldf contains the line
	\ProvidesLanguage{USenglish}

It seems, that earlier babel versions had a document option USenglish
which simply loads english.ldf. With recent versions however, there is a
usenglish.ldf and babel.sty doesn't provide a document option USenglish
anymore. Long story short, it seems USenglish is now implemented
differently and is currently broken.

I'm using TexLive 2017 as installed by Gentoo Linux.


Kind Regards,
  Sven

I have TeX Live 2016 on my Windows 10 notebook, and I'm trying to install
TL17.

I launched `install-tl-windows.exe` and it gave me the error shown in the

I've downloaded `install-tl.zip`, unzipped it and run
`install-tl-windows.bat`. After installing a certain number of packages it
gives me this error:

Dear Philip,

No, mktexfmt is never called as an installation process.
In the installation, fmtutil-sys is called.

The mktexfmt is called when a user invokes an engine, for example
xetex test.tex
if xetex.fmt does not exist.

Thus, usually, it is rare to see mktexfmt is running.

Best,
Akira

The author of babel is already aware of the problem and it will be
corrected.

We have to look into this error in a resumption of a failed
installation.

Apparently, you got the same bad ukranian package. Try to explicitly specify a
different repository, e.g.

install-tl-windows -repository ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/

My personal point of view is that it makes much more sense to keep
things centralized (but open) in this case.

A counter example for the old babel situation is what you end up when
various people (did not) maintain hyphenation patterns. Each file with
its own language and file naming convention, each file with its own
set of macros, each one incompatible with each new engine on the
horizon.

It makes a lot more sense to me to keep one central repository
somewhere in the open (some svn or git repository that's accessible by
anyone), keep a somewhat open policy, so that individual language
files can have some kind of "individual maintainers" that keep adding
new translations, potentially correcting the old ones, providing input
and feedback when new functionality gets added, ...

When new functionality gets added or when the format of localisation
files changes, it makes sense to keep files at one central place and
modify them all at once. This also makes sense in the light of
potentially merging Babel and Polyglossia one day (even if not
entirely merging, they could get the translations from the same pool
of strings for example).

(Non)maintenance of any package is something that should be solved on
a different level. If the maintainer disappears, one needs to have a
mechanism for someone else to pick up where the previous maintainer
left off. Even if individual language files for Babel were
decentralized and the core package was "locked and unmaintained" at
the time when XeTeX came up, this wouldn't really help in any way.

The important thing is:
- to have a source repository available in public
- to have a tracker available somewhere, so that even if the
maintainer doesn't respond quickly, other users can still have access
to patches submitted by their fellows
Nowadays that's much easier than years ago when all the personal
emails would end up in the void.

Probably the perl can't understand complicated non-ascii path.
Try to make a directory c:\mytmp:
mkdir c:\mytmp

and define environment variables TEMP, TMPDIR, TMP
to be c:\mytmp

On the screen, I see GPG failed hash check since it cannot find
the path which is printed as
C:\Users\xxxxxAppData\Local\Temp\...
(Sorry, my environment may input backslash character a Japanese currency 
mark.)
xxxxx are Chinese characters and obviously GPG failed since there is NO 
directory separator before AppData. Following AppData, the directory 
separator characters are visible and seem to be OK.

It has been known that some software packages fail
when it encounters a pathname that contains " " (space) or
as suggested by Akira a non-ASCII characters.
So probably, GPG is the culprit.

So in this case, given the pathname not understood by GPG has 
"AppData\Local\Temp"  definitely, you should set TEMP, TMPDIR, and TMP 
to be ASCII only pathname in order to make sure gpg will create or 
receive understandable pathnames for itself.

An old debate, and an old dilemma -- without a simple answer.
Both have its strengths and shortcomings, and I'm not sure
this list (about TeXLive) is the best place to reopen it.

Message-ID: <CA+RLzGAwT-uC4AgS+VnoYyL1xbYdP5cteyipw4=sUSuXc9Jo3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TeXLive maintainers,

I've faced a problem (with download) during install-tl run. I rerun
that. The problem is that it  redownloads everything from the very
beginning (as can be seen through the installation process and through
my network statistics), which is very annoying when run several times
(in fact, it doesn't allow installation because of different
intermediate download errors).

A better behaviour would be to redownload only those packages, for
which the download failed.

I'm writing to this mailing list because I'm not sure whether that was
reported or suggested before (there seems to be no issue tracker), and
it was written here: https://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html

Best regards,
Yaroslav Nikitenko

Yaroslav -- I don't know whether the TeX Live installer really downloads everything again (I suspect it does not), but to avoid the problem completely you could use "rsynch" for the download phase ("rsync" is most definitely incremental) and then install from the local mirror that "rsync" will create.

Already fixed and submitted to CTAN: there was a misplaced brace, sorry.
Fix until that propagates is

    \makeatletter
    \def\Ginclude at bmp#1{%
       \let\Gin at page\@empty
       \let\Gin at pagebox\@empty
      \Ginclude at dvipdfmx{#1}{image}%

Dear Philip, many thanks for the suggestion.

I've added the links and posted it here
https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/374651/71097

I still think that to check what was downloaded before should be the
default, and not to redownload every package. At least links to this
problem (like this one
https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-mirror.html) should be put to
documentation of install-tl (or even there could be an option to
redownload packages or not).

Best regards,
Yaroslav Nikitenko

Understood, Yaroslav.  I am not connected with the TeX Live team in any way, I simply commented to suggest a methodology that I personally use and which I find more reliable than a network installation.

Hmmm ... what is dviinfox, it is not in texlive-20170524-source.tar.xz
nor in texlive-20170520-source.tar.xz but in texlive.tlpdb.xz

It seems that somwhow the snapshot point is a moving target ;?

That is a perl script, considered as a dviware package.
dviinfox in a bin directory is a symlink to the script.

Hi Yaroslav,

are you sure that the packages were really downloaded again? My connection
rarely dies, so I have only one experience when the download failed due to
full disk. It seems to me that all packages were verified whether the
already downloaded ones are at the latest version. tlmgr probably does not
know whether you retry immediatelly or a few days after failure.

I have not looked into the source code so I may be wrong.

yes, I'm sure that everything was redownloaded, because I watched the
names of packages and network statistics. The same experience had
other people on stackexchange (I sent a link earlier).

This was not tlmgr, but install-tl script.

    Hmmm ... what is dviinfox, it is not in texlive-20170524-source.tar.xz
    nor in texlive-20170520-source.tar.xz 

Those are the release tarballs. They won't change.

    but in texlive.tlpdb.xz

That's the trunk development.

    It seems that somwhow the snapshot point is a moving target ;?

Not at all. 

There are three basic choices:

1) use the source tarball or, equivalently, the 2017.0 tag. That's what
was released and what will be on the DVD.

2) use the branch2017 branch, which (in a day or two -> as soon as I
have time) will include three painful bugs in luatex which I felt were
critical enough to commit fixes for.  Meaning that most (not [yet] all)
of the builders have made new binaries with them. Those new binaries
are/have been distributed through our tlmgr as usual for native
TL installs.

The branch will not include dviinfox or anything else, just those bug
fixes. (if you want them now, before I update the branch, you can get
the updated files from the luatexdir/ dir from the trunk -- that is all
and only the critical fixes.)

3) the trunk is the trunk, of course.

This is the same situation as it's always been, it's just that it's been
quite a few years since we had the need for case 2). I guess 2017 is an
unlucky number.

I've updated branch2017 with the luatex source changes (r44590),
and made a new tag texlive-2017.1 to mark the point (r44591),
so diffs between the tags texlive-2017.{0,1} can be made.

Hi Yaroslav,

We are well aware, and we had in former times a mechanism that kept the
downloaded packages around and re-used them for installation, so that
no double download happened.

Then, lots of people complained that during an installation of scheme-full
the disk usage exploded to about 6+ Gb (due to full installation plus 
one set of all packages).

Thus, for now  we delete the packages.

Furthermore, continuing an aborted installation by reading the already
installed packages and only install the rest: This is not possible at
the moment, and I am not sure how to guarantee that all files of all the
hitherto installed packages are actually installed.

Package managers like dpkg (on Debian) hit hard on the hard disk by syncing
files permanently to guarantee consistency. I am not sure if we want to 
do something like this for install-tl.

What might be possible is the following: If install-tl breaks down and writes
a profile, then it already knows that the installed packages are fine, and
writes a hint into the profile, so that a restart of the installation 
can continue from there. I will look into it.


Last but not least, on sx you wrote
	I have no idea how to implement the crypic instruction

	install-tl --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]

well, the EXTRA-ARGS are those arguments you passed in to install-tl
on the original installation, like --repository or something else...
In most cases not necessary. So in most of the cases you simply do
	install-tl --profile installation.profile
*AS*IS*.

Hope that helps

Norbert

Ok, that should be fixed with tomorrow's rebuild. I have updated the installer
to convert (hopefull) all old keys to the new names, and warn about keys
that are not used anymore.

Let me know if you find more problems, thanks!

What I believe would be more helpful would be the highest version of
GLIBC available in libc.6.so.

That is, something along these lines:
    readelf -V /lib/libc.so.6 | grep GLIBC_2.9

and find the highest version of GLIBC. (Or find the highest number
with a regex.)

I'm currently collecting some notes here:
    https://github.com/TeXLive-M/texlive-buildbot/issues/6


LuaTeX with the latest poppler compiles fine on Debian oldstable (7)
and requires GLIBC_2.7, but dvisvgm requires a newer gcc compiler
(4.8.1), so Debian stable or so.

Message-ID: <20170618004915.6374c45f@posteo.de>

Hi,

I am following TeXLive via SVN, and since today's update to revision
44623, I found the \pagecolor macro, intended to change the paper
colour in the output document, doing nothing in an (at least for me)
inexplicable pattern.

cat > mwe.tex << EOF
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\begin{document}
\pagecolor{red}
\LaTeX
\end{document}
EOF

Working as expected (red background):
xelatex mwe.tex
latex mwe.tex

NOT working (white background):
pdflatex mwe.tex
lualatex mwe.tex

xcolor.sty has not changed since 2016-05, and color.sty behaves the
same. So the reason apparently lies somewhere deeper.

Unfortunately, I cannot locate the date of this change narrower than to
say that in -r44569, \pagecolor has still worked as expected.
By today's -r44621 update to tlmgr-installed TeXLive, the same issue
has been brought to the officially distributed packages, too!

I didn't dive too deep into the code yet. I just wanted to report this
ASAP, as maybe someone has a clever idea about it (-:.

Best,
Johannes

This example was OK in pdflatex with the very old
pdftex.def: 2011/05/28 v0.06e.
So probably different behaviors in pdflatex and lualatex
are due to the new pdftex.def and luatex.def.
I expect that pdftex.def and luatex.def will be fixed soon.

Best,
Akira

Indeed: fix in hand, just have to upload to CTAN.

For the present

    \makeatletter

\edef\GPT at pagecolortrue{\global\unexpanded\expandafter{\GPT at pagecolortrue}}

\edef\GPT at pagecolorfalse{\global\unexpanded\expandafter{\GPT at pagecolorfalse}}
    \makeatother

will sort the issue.

I'd expect this to be fixed with a couple of days more widely.

The solution Siep Kroonenberg suggested to me (to install from another

Strange, I just tried with the current TL status that has
  2017/06/17 v1.0d Graphics/color driver for luatex
  2017/06/17 v1.0e Graphics/color driver for pdftex
and I don't see any problematic behaviour?!?!

Message-ID: <DB693D58-1306-4D95-8126-29D54E43E3CA@gmail.com>

Hello,

I added small patches to texk/seetexk and texk/dvidvi to accept
pTeX DVI which might include Japanese vertical writing.
(TeX Live svn r44637 and r44638 respectively)
Previously those programs rejected pTeX DVI due to id-byte = 3
or use of extended opcode 255.

For "dvibook" in seetexk, a new option "-r" (switches to right-hand
side binding signature, which is common for Japanese, Hebrew
and Arabic) is also implemented.

The patched version does not include any backward incompatible
changes. If you find some issues, please report to Japanese TeX
Development Community list, issue at texjp.org .

Many thanks to Takuji, who has tested the patch in advance
and commit to svn on behalf of us.

Turns out this is some generated code.  The source .w file has proper
spacing applied.  I managed to work around this by adding newlines (e.g.
putting PRIu64 on a line by its own) which are retained by the
generator.

Unfortunately I'm not familiar at all with the generator to be able to
suggest anything to solve the problem in a more elegant way.

For those interested, the patch I made can be found on the original
Gentoo bug: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621726

Please Cc me if you want a reply from me, as I'm not subscribed to the

Subject: [tex-live] instopt_letter seems not to work
Message-ID: <ee4d03b109b42a425a82e2964169f95e.squirrel@box386.bluehost.com>

I install TL using a ready-made profile.  This profile contains the line

  instopt_letter 1

which, if I understand properly, is supposed to cause the default
papersize to be "letter".

However, it doesn't actually cause this to be the case if the profile also
contains the line:

  selected_scheme scheme-infraonly

I say this because after installing with this profile, and then manually
doing "tlmgr install scheme-minimal", a call of "tlmgr paper" shows all
four paper size reports as being A4.

Perhaps this is because until the scheme-minimal is installed, there is no
way to change paper settings yet---I don't know, as I'm no TeXpert.  But
then shouldn't e.g. "tlmgr install scheme-minimal" consult the *created*
$TEXLIVE/tlmgr/texlive.profile for the presence of "instopt_letter 1", and
if found, automatically change the paper size to "letter"?

Hi Jack,

Umpf. Ok. Yes indeed, in this case it does not work.

> then shouldn't e.g. "tlmgr install scheme-minimal" consult the *created*
> $TEXLIVE/tlmgr/texlive.profile for the presence of "instopt_letter 1", and

No. The profile is only consulted during installation and not later on.

I guess we should say that the above option sets the paper size to
letter for *those*program*being*installed* from (dvips,pdftex,...),
but not for future added programs.

Karl: Do we want to change this into a tlpdb-option where the preference
is saved into the tlpdb, *and* updated in the config files?
There is a problem here, since we allow different settings for different
programs, so the interpretation would be: If nothing is specified, use
the paper size as specified in the tlpdb.

Not sure if we want to go that way, though ...

Hi Joseph, hi TeX Live,

(please keep Cc)

here at Debian we got a bug report that a document stopped being
compilable with 2017. I can reproduce this with a MWE on current TL2017.

The MWE is:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\newcommand{\foobar}[1]{\scalebox{-1}[1]{#1}}
\lstset{breaklines=true,prebreak=\foobar{A}}
\begin{document}
\begin{lstlisting}
some very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long line
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}

and the error is:
! pdfTeX error (\pdfsetmatrix): Unrecognized format..
<to be read again> 
                   \endgroup \set at typeset@protect 
l.10 \end{document}
                   
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!


It seems that this was not a problem in TL2016 (tested by the submitter,
but not by me).

Any ideas?

All the best

Norbert

Yes: 'Oh for goodness sake' :)

It seems that listings is redefining \space, which oddly enough causes a
few issues! Here, we have

    \edef\GPT at temp{%
      \Gscale at x\space0 0 \Gscale at y
    }%

whereas older versions had a 'private' version of \space.

I guess we'll have to go back to some non-public version of \space, but
that redefinition is pretty risky (it's widely known that \space is an
macro which expand to an explicit space).

Hi Joseph,

thanks for your prompt answer, and I am sure you'll find a good solution.
Considering that listings is quite common (in some areas I guess) a
fix is probably highly appreciated!

Thanks

Indeed, this is a bug in CWEB: https://github.com/ascherer/cweb/issues/4
or rather a misfeature, because CWEB predates C99/C++11 and does not
support many more features introduced after its inception.

You are not the first to do this: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/86aeac048c3d4d6b8d9c264e1b84776d0e3bbbb7/packages/texlive/c++11.patch

This issue will be closed. CWEB provides the '@=' directive for writing

Better still is this line in 'pdftoepdf.w':
snprintf(ck, PDF_CHECKSUM_SIZE, "%"@= @>PRIu64@= @>"_%"@= @>PRIu64,
(uint64_t) size,(uint64_t) mtime);

I'm working on the graphics drivers for LaTeX and support for /Decode:
this was in pdftex.def until recently, and we are now looking at
documenting it across drivers.

Based on the approach in pdftex.def and support for /Interpolate in
dvipdfmx.def, I've tried something that boils down to

    \leavevmode
    \vskip300pt
    \special{pdf:image (example-image-a.png)}
    \vskip300pt
    \special{pdf:image (example-image-a.png) <</Decode [0 0.5]>>}
    \bye

This produces the expected PDF but yields the warning

    dvipdfmx:warning: Ignore invalid attribute dictionary.

As far as I can see the /Decode syntax is OK and matches that which
works without issue in direct PDF output mode (\pdfximage).

Anyone know if this is a dvipdfmx issue, if there is something wrong
with the /Decode syntax, etc.?

Joseph

I have found a candidate line to change.
But I'm not sure that is right, so I'm asking the author.

Best,

Hi,

I have made a successful custom installation of TeXLive 2017 but a second
installation into another computer using the profile generated by
install-tl failed:

./install-tl --profile texlive.profile

said

Scheme scheme-custom not defined.

Installation log and profile file attached.

Cheers,

Alex

Did you use the most current installer from the web, or the one from the DVD (or similar)?

I thought I fixed that one ...

Hello Norbert,

I used the latest installer from the web: install-tl-unx.tar.gz from
the link at www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html.

Hello Norbert,

I think this may help: using "-init-from-profile texlive.profile" works,
i.e., the
installer gets all the custom options correctly from the profile, but it
wouldn't be
a unattended installation...

Indeed, fixed in svn. Either grab the current install-tl file or wait for
tomorrow.

My tests did work out, please report any further inconsistencies.

Thanks for the report

Hello Norbert,

Just downloaded install-tl-unx.tar.gz
<http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz>. It
untars to install-tl-20170625.
So, I guess it contains the fix for install-tl. Actually, "install-tl
-version"
now says "revision 44624".

Unfortunatelly, I am getting the exact same response as before:
"Scheme scheme-custom not defined."

A diff between the current version of install-tl and the previous one
does not show much, just a few blank lines:

diff install-tl-20170625/install-tl install-tl-20170621/install-tl

Message-ID: <20170626100830.169d1c07.psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>

Dear all,

I'm trying to obtain TeX Live 2017 by BitTorrent.  The torrent file
linked from <https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html> doesn't seem
to work -- all six trackers specified in that file are either timing
out or redirecting to localhost.  I thought that this might have been
the result of my ISP blocking traffic to these hosts, but I tried from
a couple different networks and got the same result.

Can anyone else confirm whether they have the same problem?  If so,
perhaps that torrent file could be replaced with one that specifies
some live trackers.  Providing a Magnet link instead of or in addition
to the torrent file would also help.

Regards,
Tristan

Right now, I have a steady 2 MB/s download via DHT using 7 seeds and 
10 peers. 

But yeah, all six trackers appear to have problems, none of them connect.

Yes, after enabling DHT my BitTorrent client eventually found some
peers and started downloading the ISO.  Probably best not to assume that
all visitors are using DHT, though -- it's not enabled by default on all
BitTorrent clients, and many casual users won't even know what it is.
Adding some reliable trackers to the torrent file would be a more
robust solution.

Regards,
Tristan

To be fair, I don't think there is such as thing as a "casual user of 
Bit-torrent" ...

I can easily create a new torrent file; I believe I took some trackers

I've send new torrents to Karl who has uploaded them; please test.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr gui: update with multiple repository
Message-ID: <3219935.yanVKnm6Yl@x61s.fritz.box>

Hello,

if I configure tlmgr to use multiple repositories:

main =  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
KOMA = https://www.komascript.de/repository/texlive/2017

with active pinning for files in the KOMA repository, and if I use the GUI, 
button "Load Default", it loads only a database from http://mirror.ctan.org/
systems/texlive/tlnet. The message in the log window states:

| tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.sharelatex.com/tex-archive/systems/
texlive/tlnet (verified)

But it does not load https://www.komascript.de/repository/texlive/2017. 
Moreover it ignores my pinning for some packages in repository KOMA and shows 
updates for, e.g., koma-script from main repository.

To get updates from all repositories I need to select a dedicated main 
repository, e.g.

| tlmgr: package repositories
| 	main = ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)
| 	KOMA = https://www.komascript.de/repository/texlive/2017 (verified)

is fine and it shows updates from repository KOMA, too.

This problem does not occur, if I do not use the gui but command line `tlmgr 
update --all`.

Is the different GUI behavior intended?

Regards
Markus

Hi Markus

>Is the different GUI behavior intended?

Definitely not. Interesting finding, thanks for your detective work. There must be some special treatment of the mirror service, I'll check a bit later.

Thanks

Here is the fix:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl?r1=44388&r2=44710

or use tlcritical, or fetch only tlmgrgui.pl from the above site.

I tried it and it works, but please let me know if you find any further
inconsistencies!

Thanks a lot

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] Please default \pdftrailerid{} to SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH if
	exported
Message-ID: <1498585586.2194864.1023120288.05C0C7A6@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi tex-live,

Please consider defaulting the \pdftrailerid macro to the value of
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH if this is exported in the environment.

Whilst we can get a reproducible PDF output in some situations, the
ordering of the elements in these IDs varies. For example:

  -/ID [<A979E943C51DC1AAE48AAFF27BBA5A0D> <EA2B7DBF37C8E3DC2AA0AFDAA1FF4E0C>]
  +/ID [<EA2B7DBF37C8E3DC2AA0AFDAA1FF4E0C> <A979E943C51DC1AAE48AAFF27BBA5A0D>]

This varies depending on the *path* from which you are building,
presumably due to the default pdftrailerid being seeded from the
full path name.

Using SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH would make sense here as it the old behaviour
is unchanged. Another alternative could be to set the default to the
empty string if SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is exported.

I believe this is the code that actually prints these tokens:

  http://sources.debian.net/src/texlive-bin/2017.20170613.44572-
2/texk/web2c/pdftexdir/pdftex.web/#L20126-L20129

(I would provide a patch but my WEB is very very rusty...)


Best wishes,

Seems to be working well now; most of the tracker hosts are indeed
resolving.  Many thanks!

 graphic whose file name contains multiple dots
Message-ID: <CADionr6s1bw7qqVnicS=O5rLSEYbBUh2pj1ts9bxRLSgmbeC2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

There is a regression after upgrading to TeX Live 2017, that
(pdf/xe/lua)latex cannot compile the following minimal document:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{example.image.png}
\end{document}

where example.image.png is a PNG image file whose name contains two
dots. And here is the error message:

! LaTeX Error: Unknown graphics extension: .image.png.

However, the same example can be compiled in TL16 smoothly.

What's more, when the image file contains some invalid UTF-8 sequence,
XeLaTeX will produce a segment fault.

I guess it is an issue about graphics-def. And I hope the problem can
be fixed properly.

Best,
Leo Liu

Hi Leo,

The graphics package has always treated the first "." as delimiting the
extension: for me your example fails in TL'16 and TL'17. Moreover, we've
not changed the filename parsing at all. Can you give \listfiles details
for your two runs?

On the second point, I guess this is an engine issue though if the file
has invalid data in it then all bets are off anyway.

Now that *might* need an update for XeTeX/dvips as there are some
changes to internals that patching won't work with.
