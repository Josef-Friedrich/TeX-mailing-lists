Subject: [tex-live] texlive not installing on unstable
Message-ID: <f9e93a0c-f6b6-37f0-0076-12a2bcb9c972@wlu.ca>

Hello,


I have been dealing with this for a week now to no avail. After a dist-upgrade, texlive gets stuck in its installation and I cannot even kill the process. It gets stuck on building formats:

Setting up tex-common (6.09) ...
Running mktexlsr. This may take some time... done.
Running updmap-sys. This may take some time... done.
Running mktexlsr /var/lib/texmf ... done.
Building format(s) --all.
    This may take some time...



I left it for couple of days but it still did not finish (4.12.0-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.12.13-1 (2017-09-19) x86_64 GNU/Linux)
I did purge and remove all old packages and directories to deal with latex, tex, auctex, etc ... and tried to do a fresh install but was faced with the same issue. I did also try to downgrade to testing and had the same issue.

Any help is greatly appreciated



Jean

Hi Jean,

you are trying to install the Debian variant, this list is only for
upstream original TeX Live.

I will answer you in another email an move the discussion to the
Debian TeX mailing list.

Message-ID: <4f2cead5-feb3-7835-abcc-a005f4380bfe@schoepfer.info>

Hi,

when compiling from source, tools like a2ping,afm2pl + accompaniment 
files ... are installed, which is all fine for binary files.
These packages(including their accompaniment files) also exist in the 
netarchives, in texlive.tlpdb tagged as TLCore, but there are also 
packages(e.g. hyphen-packages) tagged as TLCore which are not present in 
the texlive source tarball.
For packagers, the accompaniment files are partly overlapping, as the 
netarchive from some packages have not the same content/filenames.

I'm looking for a way to use either the accompaniment files from 
sourceinstall or from the netarchive.
Just overwriting with netarchive files may lead to unused files or 
duplicated files.
Thanks for any hints.

Btw. a2ping from the source tarball does not install the manpage, which 
is present in a2ping.doc.tar.xz

Hi Johannes,

Yes, there is overlap between Master and Build. Yes, this is bad.
No, there is no ideal solution at present. Sorry.

I doubt the "TLCore" category perfectly reflects anything.  All those
categories really do is define the default patterns for file inclusions
in the package. Don't take them seriously.

I do advise overwriting/extracting from Master. That should be fine for
all package files, because Master is what we distribute. Build is
essentially development sources, so has all the usual attributes of
instability, quick changes, lack of testing, etc.

The a2ping man page, among others, does not exist in the upstream source
repo (or at least did not, last time I checked for updates). Therefore
it is not in Build, but since it is still useful to distribute, I
include it in the Master man pages. (If you want it in the sources too,
talk to the program maintainer(s), I can't undertake that.)

Sorry I don't have better news, but that's the reality. -k

Hi Johannes,

to add to what Karl has said, here a short list of things I do in
Debian where I use the Build/source hierarchy for building "binary"
packages and use the Master (or in fact tlnet checkout) for building
the "arch=all" architecture independent packages.

To avoid duplication of files installed from the one and the other
several things has to be done *after* the staged installation but
before packing up. This is the *Debian* way but not all of it is 
necessary. I prefer having all the arch=all (architecture independent)
files as much as possible in the arch=all packages, and keep the
arch=any package containing mostly only actual binaries.
(Mostly because I update arch=all more often, arch=any practically never)

In the texlive-bin (from Build/source) package(s):
- remove all of shared directory (texlive/texmf*)
- remove several man pages (latex, pdflatex, ....)
- remove tex4ht links in bin
- remote all the files and links installed by
	Build/source/texk/texlive/tl_scripts
  (see below)

In the texlive-nonbin (from tlnet/Master) packages:
- add the files from 
	Build/source/texk/texlive/tl_scripts
  (see scripts.lst file)

It all needed a bit of iterations, but well, that is what I came up for
Debian and it is running since about 10 years in this style.

All the best

Norbert

Are there "wrong" links in bin especially with tex4ht, or is it about to 
remove any link in bin, which later on, after tlnet additions, will 
generated the correct way by "make texlinks"?
Or do you do no "make texlinks" at all and generate the links in bin in 
another way?

Johannes

I don't use texlinks at all, but the links are contained in the
packages I install from tlnet.

In principle *everything* is in the tlnet checkout packages, but on
Debian I *am not allowed* to use the precompiled binaries, but need
to compile them myself.

I use the scripts.lst from the Build/source when building the
arch=all (arch independent) packages to create the links of tex4ht
and all the others.

The reason is I don't want to ship in
	texlive-binaries
(which is the arch=any) dangling symlinks
	/usr/bin/foobar -> ../share/texlive/texmf-dist/scripts/foobar/foobar.pl
etc. The files under texmf-dist are shipped by the arch=all packages, so
the actual links in /usr/bin should be shipped in the same package.

Thus, I reuse the scripts.lst from Build/source to create the links in
the arch=all, and remove the (dangling) symlinks when building the
arch=any binaries.

Because most Mac users are likely to produce PDF, rather than DVI,
output from TeX documents, we may start to see questions/complaints
about PDF display with TeXShop and TeX Live.  One of our local users
already reported the issue to us after his laptop was upgraded
yesterday to High Sierra.

Hi everyone,

betterbib [1], a (Python) command line tool of mine which helps improving
and maintaining your BibTeX files, has picked up some popularity recently.
Perhaps it'd make a good addition to TeXLive as well. If you're interested,
let me know if any modification would have to be made.

Cheers,
Nico

Hi Nico - thanks for writing.

    https://github.com/nschloe/betterbib

First, it needs to be available through CTAN. (ctan.org/upload)

Also, it needs to be self-locating, though I'm not sure if you need to
do anything special for this with Python.

That is, the installation on TL would be

  /arbitrary/tlroot/bin/PLATFORM/betterbib
  -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/betterbib/betterbib.py

with the subsidiary .py files installed in that same
../texmf-dist/scripts/betterbib/ dir. So the main .py file needs to
find them there, at runtime.

In particular, it must not be required to run Python's usual setup.py
(which I see in your repo) at any point, since the paths are not known.

For an existing example of multi-file python script in TL, see the
pythontex package. (I hope it works.)

Best,
Karl

Is it possible to update the package via an API or would I have to go to
the website manually each time I release a new version?

You mean an API to get betterbib into our subversion server? No, that is
not possible.

And yes, every update you want to get into TeX Live needs to go through CTAN.
This is how everyone is doing it.

OTOH, if you meant that the API is used to update the actual installation on
the *user* computer, then well, in principle you *could* try to do it, but
in many cases the user running the script will not have *write* permissions
to the location where betterbib is installed. (Unix root/user, Win admin perm...)
So I think this is not a good idea.

All the best

That's what I meant.

Whenever I publish a new version of betterbib, I use a simple Makefile to
push the data upstream. This works

  * for releases on GitHub [1] (via `git tag v1.2.3 && git push --tags`) as
well as
  * for releases on pypi [2] (via `python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
&& gpg --detach-sign -a dist/* && twine upload dist/*`).

This makes releasing new versions really easy for me. Having to manually
open a browser, navigate to a website, copy-and-pasting some information
from the package into input fields, and clicking a submit button would be a
step back, and I can already see myself forget doing it.

Perhaps this is a feature you'd like to add sometime in the future.

Cheers,
Nico

Nothing I can influence. I am not CTAN maintainer ... we are doing the TeX Live
stuff, and pull from CTAN. But CTAN maintainers is a different group.

I think they might be open to suggestions, but since all are volunteers (not like
github etc staff) implementing things takes time, or patches from contributors ;-)

 AFAIK our webmaster has been thinking about such an interface
 for a _long_ time, but it seems that this is more complicated
 than expected, and then the backend doesn't seem to be
 100% stable either ...

 In any case:  given that all the uploads are checked by hand
 (although with the help of some tools) and then installed one
 by one, I would be a little scared of uploads arriving with
 a github-like frequency ... ;-)

   All the best

I agree completely. I wasn't sure, but my guess was that this is
overly complicated.

haha, indeed ;-) TeX dev pace is much more relaxed.

Emphasis on *relaxed*. :) arara 4.0 is on the development branch for two 
years, maybe I will do something next year for the upcoming TUG in 
Brazil (or not, I want to save energy too). :)

 Your corrections are incorrect:
   By default, this installs only the packages without the doc and source tree. Please see --with-doc and --with-src to install doc and source tree also.

This is not true. What is installed depends on the settings in the texlive.tlpdb. you have set that to not install doc and source files, so further installs will not install it.

Please read the section about options, tlmgr option, on how to change these settings.

Well then, betterbib is probably not for CTAN. Thanks everyone for the
input!

Well, it is up to you whether you want your software in TeX Live, we cannot follow the wishes and desires of each of the few thousands of contributors.

Good luck with your endeavors

Dear Norbert,

Thanks for all your help.

Here is the updated help file. The change I suggest is enclosed between 
a pair of xx. I did not know how else to indicate them.

Please let me know if you find the suggested change suitable and let me 
know if and when you actually implement it.

NAME
    tlmgr - the native TeX Live Manager

SYNOPSIS
    tlmgr [option]... action [option]... [operand]...

DESCRIPTION
    tlmgr manages an existing TeX Live installation, both packages and
    configuration options. For information on initially downloading and
    installing TeX Live, see <http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html>.

    The most up-to-date version of this documentation (updated nightly from
    the development sources) is available at
    <http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html>, along with procedures for updating
    "tlmgr" itself and information about test versions.

    TeX Live is organized into a few top-level schemes, each of which is
    specified as a different set of collections and packages, where a
    collection is a set of packages, and a package is what contains actual
    files. Schemes typically contain a mix of collections and packages, but
    each package is included in exactly one collection, no more and no less.
    A TeX Live installation can be customized and managed at any level.

    See <http://tug.org/texlive/doc> for all the TeX Live documentation
    available.

EXAMPLES
    After successfully installing TeX Live, here are a few common operations
    with "tlmgr":

    "tlmgr option repository ctan"
    "tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet"
        Tell "tlmgr" to use a nearby CTAN mirror for future updates; useful
        if you installed TeX Live from the DVD image and want to have
        continuing updates. The two commands are equivalent; "ctan" is just
        an alias for the given url. Caveat: "mirror.ctan.org" resolves to
        many different hosts, and they are not perfectly synchronized; we
        recommend updating only daily (at most), and not more often.

    "tlmgr update --list"
        Report what would be updated without actually updating anything.

    "tlmgr update --all"
        Make your local TeX installation correspond to what is in the
        package repository (typically useful when updating from CTAN).

    "tlmgr info" what
        Display detailed information about a package what, such as the
        installation status and description, of searches for what in all
        packages.

    For all the capabilities and details of "tlmgr", please read the
    following voluminous information.

OPTIONS
    The following options to "tlmgr" are global options, not specific to any
    action. All options, whether global or action-specific, can be given
    anywhere on the command line, and in any order. The first non-option
    argument will be the main action. In all cases, "--"option and "-"option
    are equivalent, and an "=" is optional between an option name and its
    value.

    --repository url|path
        Specifies the package repository from which packages should be
        installed or updated, overriding the default package repository
        found in the installation's TeX Live Package Database (a.k.a. the
        TLPDB, defined entirely in the file "tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb"). The
        documentation for "install-tl" has more details about this
        (<http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html>).

        "--repository" changes the repository location only for the current
        run; to make a permanent change, use "option repository" (see the
        "option" action).

        For backward compatibility and convenience, "--location" and
        "--repo" are accepted as aliases for this option.

    --gui [action]
        "tlmgr" has a graphical interface as well as the command line
        interface. You can give this option, "--gui", together with an
        action to be brought directly into the respective screen of the GUI.
        For example, running

          tlmgr --gui update

        starts you directly at the update screen. If no action is given, the
        GUI will be started at the main screen.

    --gui-lang llcode
        By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the
        environment (on Windows via the registry, on Unix via
        "LC_MESSAGES"). If that fails you can select a different language by
        giving this option with a language code (based on ISO 639-1).
        Currently supported (but not necessarily completely translated) are:
        English (en, default), Czech (cs), German (de), French (fr), Italian
        (it), Japanese (ja), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Brazilian Portuguese
        (pt_BR), Russian (ru), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Serbian (sr),
        Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi), simplified Chinese (zh_CN), and
        traditional Chinese (zh_TW).

    --debug-translation
        In GUI mode, this switch tells "tlmgr" to report any untranslated
        (or missing) messages to standard error. This can help translators
        to see what remains to be done.

    --machine-readable
        Instead of the normal output intended for human consumption, write
        (to standard output) a fixed format more suitable for machine
        parsing. See the "MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT" section below.

    --no-execute-actions
        Suppress the execution of the execute actions as defined in the
        tlpsrc files. Documented only for completeness, as this is only
        useful in debugging.

    --package-logfile file
        "tlmgr" logs all package actions (install, remove, update, failed
        updates, failed restores) to a separate log file, by default
        "TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/tlmgr.log". This option allows you to specify a
        different file for the log.

    --pause
        This option makes "tlmgr" wait for user input before exiting. Useful
        on Windows to avoid disappearing command windows.

    --persistent-downloads
    --no-persistent-downloads
        For network-based installations, this option (on by default) makes
        "tlmgr" try to set up a persistent connection (using the "LWP" Perl
        module). The idea is to open and reuse only one connection per
        session between your computer and the server, instead of initiating
        a new download for each package.

        If this is not possible, "tlmgr" will fall back to using "wget". To
        disable these persistent connections, use
        "--no-persistent-downloads".

    --pin-file
        Change the pinning file location from "TEXMFLOCAL/tlpkg/pinning.txt"
        (see "Pinning" below). Documented only for completeness, as this is
        only useful in debugging.

    --require-verification
    --no-require-verification
        Instructs "tlmgr" to only accept signed and verified remotes. In any
        other case "tlmgr" will quit operation. See "CRYPTOGRAPHIC
        VERIFICATION" below for details.

    --usermode
        Activates user mode for this run of "tlmgr"; see "USER MODE" below.

    --usertree dir
        Uses dir for the tree in user mode; see "USER MODE" below.

    --verify-downloads
    --no-verify-downloads
        Enables or disables cryptographic verification of downloaded
        database files. A working GnuPG ("gpg") binary needs to be present
        in the path, otherwise this option has no effect. See "CRYPTOGRAPHIC
        VERIFICATION" below for details.

    The standard options for TeX Live programs are also accepted:
    "--help/-h/-?", "--version", "-q" (no informational messages), "-v"
    (debugging messages, can be repeated). For the details about these, see
    the "TeXLive::TLUtils" documentation.

    The "--version" option shows version information about the TeX Live
    release and about the "tlmgr" script itself. If "-v" is also given,
    revision number for the loaded TeX Live Perl modules are shown, too.

ACTIONS
  help
    Display this help information and exit (same as "--help", and on the web
    at <http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html>). Sometimes the "perldoc"
    and/or "PAGER" programs on the system have problems, resulting in
    control characters being literally output. This can't always be
    detected, but you can set the "NOPERLDOC" environment variable and
    "perldoc" will not be used.

  version
    Gives version information (same as "--version").

    If "-v" has been given the revisions of the used modules are reported,
    too.

  backup [--clean[=N]] [--backupdir dir] [--all | pkg]...
    If the "--clean" option is not specified, this action makes a backup of
    the given packages, or all packages given "--all". These backups are
    saved to the value of the "--backupdir" option, if that is an existing
    and writable directory. If "--backupdir" is not given, the "backupdir"
    option setting in the TLPDB is used, if present. If both are missing, no
    backups are made.

    If the "--clean" option is specified, backups are pruned (removed)
    instead of saved. The optional integer value N may be specified to set
    the number of backups that will be retained when cleaning. If "N" is not
    given, the value of the "autobackup" option is used. If both are
    missing, an error is issued. For more details of backup pruning, see the
    "option" action.

    Options:

    --backupdir directory
        Overrides the "backupdir" option setting in the TLPDB. The directory
        argument is required and must specify an existing, writable
        directory where backups are to be placed.

    --all
        If "--clean" is not specified, make a backup of all packages in the
        TeX Live installation; this will take quite a lot of space and time.
        If "--clean" is specified, all packages are pruned.

    --clean[=N]
        Instead of making backups, prune the backup directory of old
        backups, as explained above. The optional integer argument N
        overrides the "autobackup" option set in the TLPDB. You must use
        "--all" or a list of packages together with this option, as desired.

    --dry-run
        Nothing is actually backed up or removed; instead, the actions to be
        performed are written to the terminal.

  candidates pkg
    candidates pkg
        Shows the available candidate repositories for package pkg. See
        "MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES" below.

  check [option]... [files|depends|executes|runfiles|all]
    Executes one (or all) check(s) on the consistency of the installation.

    files
        Checks that all files listed in the local TLPDB ("texlive.tlpdb")
        are actually present, and lists those missing.

    depends
        Lists those packages which occur as dependencies in an installed
        collection, but are themselves not installed, and those packages
        which are not contained in any collection.

        If you call "tlmgr check collections" this test will be carried out
        instead since former versions for "tlmgr" called it that way.

    executes
        Check that the files referred to by "execute" directives in the TeX
        Live Database are present.

    runfiles
        List those filenames that are occurring more than one time in the
        runfiles sections.

    Options:

    --use-svn
        Use the output of "svn status" instead of listing the files; for
        checking the TL development repository.

  conf [texmf|tlmgr|updmap [--conffile file] [--delete] [key [value]]]
  conf auxtrees [--conffile file] [show|add|delete] [value]
    With only "conf", show general configuration information for TeX Live,
    including active configuration files, path settings, and more. This is
    like running "texconfig conf", but works on all supported platforms.

    With one of "conf texmf", "conf tlmgr", or "conf updmap", shows all
    key/value pairs (i.e., all settings) as saved in "ROOT/texmf.cnf", the
    user-specific "tlmgr" configuration file (see below), or the first found
    (via "kpsewhich") "updmap.cfg" file, respectively.

    If key is given in addition, shows the value of only that key in the
    respective file. If option --delete is also given, the value in the
    given configuration file is entirely removed (not just commented out).

    If value is given in addition, key is set to value in the respective
    file. No error checking is done!

    The "PATH" value shown by "conf" is as used by "tlmgr". The directory in
    which the "tlmgr" executable is found is automatically prepended to the
    PATH value inherited from the environment.

    Here is a practical example of changing configuration values. If the
    execution of (some or all) system commands via "\write18" was left
    enabled during installation, you can disable it afterwards:

      tlmgr conf texmf shell_escape 0

    The subcommand "auxtrees" allows adding and removing arbitrary
    additional texmf trees, completely under user control. "auxtrees show"
    shows the list of additional trees, "auxtrees add" tree adds a tree to
    the list, and "auxtrees remove" tree removes a tree from the list (if
    present). The trees should not contain an "ls-R" file (or files might
    not be found if the "ls-R" becomes stale). This works by manipulating
    the Kpathsea variable "TEXMFAUXTREES", in "ROOT/texmf.cnf". Example:

      tlmgr conf auxtrees add /quick/test/tree
      tlmgr conf auxtrees remove /quick/test/tree

    In all cases the configuration file can be explicitly specified via the
    option "--conffile" file, if desired.

    Warning: The general facility for changing configuration values is here,
    but tinkering with settings in this way is strongly discouraged. Again,
    no error checking on either keys or values is done, so any sort of
    breakage is possible.

  dump-tlpdb [--local|--remote]
    Dump complete local or remote TLPDB to standard output, as-is. The
    output is analogous to the "--machine-readable" output; see
    "MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT" section.

    Options:

    --local
        Dump the local TLPDB.

    --remote
        Dump the remote TLPDB.

    Exactly one of "--local" and "--remote" must be given.

    In either case, the first line of the output specifies the repository
    location, in this format:

      "location-url" "\t" location

    where "location-url" is the literal field name, followed by a tab, and
    location is the file or url to the repository.

    Line endings may be either LF or CRLF depending on the current platform.

  generate [option]... what
    generate language
    generate language.dat
    generate language.def
    generate language.dat.lua

    The "generate" action overwrites any manual changes made in the
    respective files: it recreates them from scratch based on the
    information of the installed packages, plus local adaptions. The TeX
    Live installer and "tlmgr" routinely call "generate" for all of these
    files.

    For managing your own fonts, please read the "updmap --help" information
    and/or <http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html>.

    For managing your own formats, please read the "fmtutil --help"
    information.

    In more detail: "generate" remakes any of the configuration files
    "language.dat", "language.def", and "language.dat.lua" from the
    information present in the local TLPDB, plus locally-maintained files.

    The locally-maintained files are "language-local.dat",
    "language-local.def", or "language-local.dat.lua", searched for in
    "TEXMFLOCAL" in the respective directories. If local additions are
    present, the final file is made by starting with the main file, omitting
    any entries that the local file specifies to be disabled, and finally
    appending the local file.

    (Historical note: The formerly supported "updmap-local.cfg" and
    "fmtutil-local.cnf" are no longer read, since "updmap" and "fmtutil" now
    reads and supports multiple configuration files. Thus, local additions
    can and should be put into an "updmap.cfg" of "fmtutil.cnf" file in
    "TEXMFLOCAL". The "generate updmap" and "generate fmtutil" actions no
    longer exist.)

    Local files specify entries to be disabled with a comment line, namely
    one of these:

      %!NAME
      --!NAME

    where "language.dat" and "language.def" use "%", and "language.dat.lua"
    use "--". In all cases, the name is the respective format name or
    hyphenation pattern identifier. Examples:

      %!german
      --!usenglishmax

    (Of course, you're not likely to actually want to disable those
    particular items. They're just examples.)

    After such a disabling line, the local file can include another entry
    for the same item, if a different definition is desired. In general,
    except for the special disabling lines, the local files follow the same
    syntax as the master files.

    The form "generate language" recreates all three files "language.dat",
    "language.def", and "language.dat.lua", while the forms with an
    extension recreates only that given language file.

    Options:

    --dest output_file
        specifies the output file (defaults to the respective location in
        "TEXMFSYSVAR"). If "--dest" is given to "generate language", it
        serves as a basename onto which ".dat" will be appended for the name
        of the "language.dat" output file, ".def" will be appended to the
        value for the name of the "language.def" output file, and ".dat.lua"
        to the name of the "language.dat.lua" file. (This is just to avoid
        overwriting; if you want a specific name for each output file, we
        recommend invoking "tlmgr" twice.)

    --localcfg local_conf_file
        specifies the (optional) local additions (defaults to the respective
        location in "TEXMFLOCAL").

    --rebuild-sys
        tells "tlmgr" to run necessary programs after config files have been
        regenerated. These are: "fmtutil-sys --all" after "generate
        fmtutil", "fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.dat" after "generate
        language.dat", and "fmtutil-sys --byhyphen .../language.def" after
        "generate language.def".

        These subsequent calls cause the newly-generated files to actually
        take effect. This is not done by default since those calls are
        lengthy processes and one might want to made several related changes
        in succession before invoking these programs.

    The respective locations are as follows:

      tex/generic/config/language.dat (and language-local.dat)
      tex/generic/config/language.def (and language-local.def)
      tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua (and language-local.dat.lua)

  gui
    Start the graphical user interface. See GUI below.

  info [option...] [collections|schemes|pkg...]
    With no argument, lists all packages available at the package
    repository, prefixing those already installed with "i".

    With the single word "collections" or "schemes" as the argument, lists
    the request type instead of all packages.

    With any other arguments, display information about pkg: the name,
    category, short and long description, sizes, installation status, and
    TeX Live revision number. If pkg is not locally installed, searches in
    the remote installation source.

    For normal packages (not collections or schemes), the sizes of the four
    groups of files (run/src/doc/bin files) are shown separately. For
    collections, the cumulative size is shown, including all
    directly-dependent packages (but not dependent collections). For
    schemes, the cumulative size is also shown, including all
    directly-dependent collections and packages.

    If pkg is not found locally or remotely, the search action is used and
    lists matching packages and files.

    It also displays information taken from the TeX Catalogue, namely the
    package version, date, and license. Consider these, especially the
    package version, as approximations only, due to timing skew of the
    updates of the different pieces. By contrast, the "revision" value comes
    directly from TL and is reliable.

    The former actions "show" and "list" are merged into this action, but
    are still supported for backward compatibility.

    Options:

    --list
        If the option "--list" is given with a package, the list of
        contained files is also shown, including those for platform-specific
        dependencies. When given with schemes and collections, "--list"
        outputs their dependencies in a similar way.

    --only-installed
        If this option is given, the installation source will not be used;
        only locally installed packages, collections, or schemes are listed.

    --data "item1,item2,..."
        If the option "--data" is given, its argument must be a comma
        separated list of field names from: "name", "category", "localrev",
        "remoterev", "shortdesc", "longdesc", "installed", "size",
        "relocatable", "cat-version", "cat-date", or "cat-licence". In this
        case the requested packages' information is listed in CSV format one
        package per line, and the column information is given by the
        "itemN".

  init-usertree
    Sets up a texmf tree for so-called user mode management, either the
    default user tree ("TEXMFHOME"), or one specified on the command line
    with "--usertree". See "USER MODE" below.

  install [option]... pkg...
    Install each pkg given on the command line, if it is not already
    installed. (It does not touch existing packages; see the "update" action
    for how to get the latest version of a package.)

    xx
    By default, this installs only the packages without the doc and source tree. Please see --with-doc and --with-src to install doc and source tree also.
    xx

    By default this also installs all packages on which the given pkgs are
    dependent. Options:

    --dry-run
        Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed
        are written to the terminal.

    --file
        Instead of fetching a package from the installation repository, use
        the package files given on the command line. These files must be
        standard TeX Live package files (with contained tlpobj file).

    --force
        If updates to "tlmgr" itself (or other parts of the basic
        infrastructure) are present, "tlmgr" will bail out and not perform
        the installation unless this option is given. Not recommended.

    --no-depends
        Do not install dependencies. (By default, installing a package
        ensures that all dependencies of this package are fulfilled.)

    --no-depends-at-all
        Normally, when you install a package which ships binary files the
        respective binary package will also be installed. That is, for a
        package "foo", the package "foo.i386-linux" will also be installed
        on an "i386-linux" system. This option suppresses this behavior, and
        also implies "--no-depends". Don't use it unless you are sure of
        what you are doing.

    --reinstall
        Reinstall a package (including dependencies for collections) even if
        it already seems to be installed (i.e, is present in the TLPDB).
        This is useful to recover from accidental removal of files in the
        hierarchy.

        When re-installing, only dependencies on normal packages are
        followed (i.e., not those of category Scheme or Collection).

    --with-doc
    --with-src
        While not recommended, the "install-tl" program provides an option
        to omit installation of all documentation and/or source files. (By
        default, everything is installed.) After such an installation, you
        may find that you want the documentation or source files for a given
        package after all. You can get them by using these options in
        conjunction with "--reinstall", as in (using the "fontspec" package
        as the example):

          tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc --with-src fontspec

  key list|add file|remove keyid
    The action "key" allows listing, adding and removing additional GPG keys
    to the set of trusted keys, that is, those that are used to verify the
    TeX Live databases.

    With the "list" argument, "key" lists all keys.

    The "add" argument requires another argument, either a filename or "-"
    for stdin, from which the key is added. The key is added to the local
    keyring "GNUPGHOME/repository-keys.gpg", which is normally)
    "tlpkg/gpg/repository-keys.gpg".

    The "remove" argument requires a key id and removes the requested id
    from the local keyring.

  option
    option [show]
    option showall
    option key [value]

    The first form shows the global TeX Live settings currently saved in the
    TLPDB with a short description and the "key" used for changing it in
    parentheses.

    The second form is similar, but also shows options which can be defined
    but are not currently set to any value.

    In the third form, if value is not given, the setting for key is
    displayed. If value is present, key is set to value.

    Possible values for key are (run "tlmgr option showall" for the
    definitive list):

     repository (default package repository),
     formats    (create formats at installation time),
     postcode   (run postinst code blobs)
     docfiles   (install documentation files),
     srcfiles   (install source files),
     backupdir  (default directory for backups),
     autobackup (number of backups to keep).
     sys_bin    (directory to which executables are linked by the path action)
     sys_man    (directory to which man pages are linked by the path action)
     sys_info   (directory to which Info files are linked by the path action)
     desktop_integration (Windows-only: create Start menu shortcuts)
     fileassocs (Windows-only: change file associations)
     multiuser  (Windows-only: install for all users)

    One common use of "option" is to permanently change the installation to
    get further updates from the Internet, after originally installing from
    DVD. To do this, you can run

     tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

    The "install-tl" documentation has more information about the possible
    values for "repository". (For backward compatibility, "location" can be
    used as alternative name for "repository".)

    If "formats" is set (this is the default), then formats are regenerated
    when either the engine or the format files have changed. Disable this
    only when you know what you are doing.

    The "postcode" option controls execution of per-package postinstallation
    action code. It is set by default, and again disabling is not likely to
    be of interest except perhaps to developers.

    The "docfiles" and "srcfiles" options control the installation of their
    respective files of a package. By default both are enabled (1). Either
    or both can be disabled (set to 0) if disk space is limited or for
    minimal testing installations, etc. When disabled, the respective files
    are not downloaded at all.

    The options "autobackup" and "backupdir" determine the defaults for the
    actions "update", "backup" and "restore". These three actions need a
    directory in which to read or write the backups. If "--backupdir" is not
    specified on the command line, the "backupdir" option value is used (if
    set).

    The "autobackup" option (de)activates automatic generation of backups.
    Its value is an integer. If the "autobackup" value is -1, no backups are
    removed. If "autobackup" is 0 or more, it specifies the number of
    backups to keep. Thus, backups are disabled if the value is 0. In the
    "--clean" mode of the "backup" action this option also specifies the
    number to be kept. The default value is 1, so that backups are made, but
    only one backup is kept.

    To setup "autobackup" to -1 on the command line, use:

      tlmgr option -- autobackup -1

    The "--" avoids having the -1 treated as an option. ("--" stops parsing
    for options at the point where it appears; this is a general feature
    across most Unix programs.)

    The "sys_bin", "sys_man", and "sys_info" options are used on Unix-like
    systems to control the generation of links for executables, info files
    and man pages. See the "path" action for details.

    The last three options also affect behavior on Windows installations. If
    "desktop_integration" is set, then some packages will install items in a
    sub-folder of the Start menu for "tlmgr gui", documentation, etc. If
    "fileassocs" is set, Windows file associations are made (see also the
    "postaction" action). Finally, if "multiuser" is set, then adaptions to
    the registry and the menus are done for all users on the system instead
    of only the current user. All three options are on by default.

  paper
    paper [a4|letter]
    [xdvi|pdftex|dvips|dvipdfmx|context|psutils] paper [papersize|--list]

    With no arguments ("tlmgr paper"), shows the default paper size setting
    for all known programs.

    With one argument (e.g., "tlmgr paper a4"), sets the default for all
    known programs to that paper size.

    With a program given as the first argument and no paper size specified
    (e.g., "tlmgr dvips paper"), shows the default paper size for that
    program.

    With a program given as the first argument and a paper size as the last
    argument (e.g., "tlmgr dvips paper a4"), set the default for that
    program to that paper size.

    With a program given as the first argument and "--list" given as the
    last argument (e.g., "tlmgr dvips paper --list"), shows all valid paper
    sizes for that program. The first size shown is the default.

    Incidentally, this syntax of having a specific program name before the
    "paper" keyword is unusual. It is inherited from the longstanding
    "texconfig" script, which supports other configuration settings for some
    programs, notably "dvips". "tlmgr" does not support those extra
    settings.

  path [--w32mode=user|admin] [add|remove]
    On Unix, merely adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages, and
    info pages in the system directories specified by the respective options
    (see the "option" description above). Does not change any initialization
    files, either system or personal.

    On Windows, the registry part where the binary directory is added or
    removed is determined in the following way:

    If the user has admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is not given,
    the setting w32_multi_user determines the location (i.e., if it is on
    then the system path, otherwise the user path is changed).

    If the user has admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is given, this
    option determines the path to be adjusted.

    If the user does not have admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is
    not given, and the setting w32_multi_user is off, the user path is
    changed, while if the setting w32_multi_user is on, a warning is issued
    that the caller does not have enough privileges.

    If the user does not have admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is
    given, it must be user and the user path will be adjusted. If a user
    without admin rights uses the option "--w32mode admin" a warning is
    issued that the caller does not have enough privileges.

  pinning
    The "pinning" action manages the pinning file, see "Pinning" below.

    "pinning show"
        Shows the current pinning data.

    "pinning add" repo pkgglob...
        Pins the packages matching the pkgglob(s) to the repository repo.

    "pinning remove" repo pkgglob...
        Any packages recorded in the pinning file matching the <pkgglob>s
        for the given repository repo are removed.

    "pinning remove repo --all"
        Remove all pinning data for repository repo.

  platform list|add|remove platform...
  platform set platform
  platform set auto
    "platform list" lists the TeX Live names of all the platforms (a.k.a.
    architectures), ("i386-linux", ...) available at the package repository.

    "platform add" platform... adds the executables for each given platform
    platform to the installation from the repository.

    "platform remove" platform... removes the executables for each given
    platform platform from the installation, but keeps the currently running
    platform in any case.

    "platform set" platform switches TeX Live to always use the given
    platform instead of auto detection.

    "platform set auto" switches TeX Live to auto detection mode for
    platform.

    Platform detection is needed to select the proper "xz", "xzdec" and
    "wget" binaries that are shipped with TeX Live.

    "arch" is a synonym for "platform".

    Options:

    --dry-run
        Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed
        are written to the terminal.

  postaction [--w32mode=user|admin] [--fileassocmode=1|2] [--all] [install|remove] [shortcut|fileassoc|script] [pkg]...
    Carry out the postaction "shortcut", "fileassoc", or "script" given as
    the second required argument in install or remove mode (which is the
    first required argument), for either the packages given on the command
    line, or for all if "--all" is given.

    If the option "--w32mode" is given the value "user", all actions will
    only be carried out in the user-accessible parts of the
    registry/filesystem, while the value "admin" selects the system-wide
    parts of the registry for the file associations. If you do not have
    enough permissions, using "--w32mode=admin" will not succeed.

    "--fileassocmode" specifies the action for file associations. If it is
    set to 1 (the default), only new associations are added; if it is set to
    2, all associations are set to the TeX Live programs. (See also "option
    fileassocs".)

  print-platform
    Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform
    (hardware/operating system) combination to standard output, and exit.
    "--print-arch" is a synonym.

  remove [option]... pkg...
    Remove each pkg specified. Removing a collection removes all package
    dependencies (unless "--no-depends" is specified), but not any
    collection dependencies of that collection. However, when removing a
    package, dependencies are never removed. Options:

    --backup
    --backupdir directory
        These options behave just as with the "update" action (q.v.), except
        they apply to making backups of packages before they are removed.
        The default is to make such a backup, that is, to save a copy of
        packages before removal.

        See "update" action for more.

        neither option is given, no backup will be made. If "--backupdir" is
        given and specifies a writable directory then a backup will be made
        in that location. If only "--backup" is given, then a backup will be
        made to the directory previously set via the "option" action (see
        below). If both are given then a backup will be made to the
        specified directory.

        You can set options via the "option" action to automatically make
        backups for all packages, and/or keep only a certain number of
        backups. Please see the "option" action for details. The default is
        to make one backup.

        The "restore" action explains how to restore from a backup.

    --no-depends
        Do not remove dependent packages.

    --no-depends-at-all
        See above under install (and beware).

    --force
        By default, removal of a package or collection that is a dependency
        of another collection or scheme is not allowed. With this option,
        the package will be removed unconditionally. Use with care.

        A package that has been removed using the "--force" option because
        it is still listed in an installed collection or scheme will not be
        updated, and will be mentioned as forcibly removed in the output of
        tlmgr update --list.

    --dry-run
        Nothing is actually removed; instead, the actions to be performed
        are written to the terminal.

  repository
    repository list
    repository list path|tag
    repository add path [tag]
    repository remove path|tag
    repository set path[#tag] [path[#tag] ...]
        This action manages the list of repositories. See "MULTIPLE
        REPOSITORIES" below for detailed explanations.

        The first form ("list") lists all configured repositories and the
        respective tags if set. If a path, url, or tag is given after the
        "list" keyword, it is interpreted as source from where to initialize
        a TeX Live Database and lists the contained packages. This can also
        be an up-to-now not used repository, both locally and remote. If one
        pass in addition "--with-platforms", for each package the available
        platforms (if any) are listed, too.

        The third form ("add") adds a repository (optionally attaching a
        tag) to the list of repositories. The forth form ("remove") removes
        a repository, either by full path/url, or by tag. The last form
        ("set") sets the list of repositories to the items given on the
        command line, not keeping previous settings

        In all cases, one of the repositories must be tagged as "main";
        otherwise, all operations will fail!

  restore [--backupdir dir] [--all | pkg [rev]]
    Restore a package from a previously-made backup.

    If "--all" is given, try to restore the latest revision of all package
    backups found in the backup directory.

    Otherwise, if neither pkg nor rev are given, list the available backup
    revisions for all packages. With pkg given but no rev, list all
    available backup revisions of pkg.

    When listing available packages, "tlmgr" shows the revision, and in
    parenthesis the creation time if available (in format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm).

    If (and only if) both pkg and a valid revision number rev are specified,
    try to restore the package from the specified backup.

    Options:

    --all
        Try to restore the latest revision of all package backups found in
        the backup directory. Additional non-option arguments (like pkg) are
        not allowed.

    --backupdir directory
        Specify the directory where the backups are to be found. If not
        given it will be taken from the configuration setting in the TLPDB.

    --dry-run
        Nothing is actually restored; instead, the actions to be performed
        are written to the terminal.

    --force
        Don't ask questions.

  search [option...] what
   search [option...] --file what
   search [option...] --all what
    By default, search the names, short descriptions, and long descriptions
    of all locally installed packages for the argument what, interpreted as
    a (Perl) regular expression.

    Options:

    --file
        List all filenames containing what.

    --all
        Search everything: package names, descriptions and filenames.

    --global
        Search the TeX Live Database of the installation medium, instead of
        the local installation.

    --word
        Restrict the search of package names and descriptions (but not
        filenames) to match only full words. For example, searching for
        "table" with this option will not output packages containing the
        word "tables" (unless they also contain the word "table" on its
        own).

  shell
    Starts an interactive mode, where tlmgr prompts for commands. This can
    be used directly, or for scripting. The first line of output is
    "protocol" n, where n is an unsigned number identifying the protocol
    version (currently 1).

    In general, tlmgr actions that can be given on the command line
    translate to commands in this shell mode. For example, you can say
    "update --list" to see what would be updated. The TLPDB is loaded the
    first time it is needed (not at the beginning), and used for the rest of
    the session.

    Besides these actions, a few commands are specific to shell mode:

    protocol
        Print "protocol n", the current protocol version.

    help
        Print pointers to this documentation.

    version
        Print tlmgr version information.

    quit, end, bye, byebye, EOF
        Exit.

    restart
        Restart "tlmgr shell" with the original command line; most useful
        when developing "tlmgr".

    load [local|remote]
        Explicitly load the local or remote, respectively, TLPDB.

    save
        Save the local TLPDB, presumably after other operations have changed
        it.

    get [var] =item set [var [val]]
        Get the value of var, or set it to val. Possible var names:
        "debug-translation", "machine-readable", "no-execute-actions",
        "require-verification", "verify-downloads", "repository", and
        "prompt". All except "repository" and "prompt" are booleans, taking
        values 0 and 1, and behave like the corresponding command line
        option. The "repository" variable takes a string, and sets the
        remote repository location. The "prompt" variable takes a string,
        and sets the current default prompt.

        If var or then val is not specified, it is prompted for.

  uninstall
    Uninstalls the entire TeX Live installation. Options:

    --force
        Do not ask for confirmation, remove immediately.

  update [option]... [pkg]...
    Updates the packages given as arguments to the latest version available
    at the installation source. Either "--all" or at least one pkg name must
    be specified. Options:

    --all
        Update all installed packages except for "tlmgr" itself. Thus, if
        updates to "tlmgr" itself are present, this will simply give an
        error, unless also the option "--force" or "--self" is given. (See
        below.)

        In addition to updating the installed packages, during the update of
        a collection the local installation is (by default) synchronized to
        the status of the collection on the server, for both additions and
        removals.

        This means that if a package has been removed on the server (and
        thus has also been removed from the respective collection), "tlmgr"
        will remove the package in the local installation. This is called
        ``auto-remove'' and is announced as such when using the option
        "--list". This auto-removal can be suppressed using the option
        "--no-auto-remove" (not recommended, see option description).

        Analogously, if a package has been added to a collection on the
        server that is also installed locally, it will be added to the local
        installation. This is called ``auto-install'' and is announced as
        such when using the option "--list". This auto-installation can be
        suppressed using the option "--no-auto-install".

        An exception to the collection dependency checks (including the
        auto-installation of packages just mentioned) are those that have
        been ``forcibly removed'' by you, that is, you called "tlmgr remove
        --force" on them. (See the "remove" action documentation.) To
        reinstall any such forcibly removed packages use
        "--reinstall-forcibly-removed".

        If you want to exclude some packages from the current update run
        (e.g., due to a slow link), see the "--exclude" option below.

    --self
        Update "tlmgr" itself (that is, the infrastructure packages) if
        updates to it are present. On Windows this includes updates to the
        private Perl interpreter shipped inside TeX Live.

        If this option is given together with either "--all" or a list of
        packages, then "tlmgr" will be updated first and, if this update
        succeeds, the new version will be restarted to complete the rest of
        the updates.

        In short:

          tlmgr update --self        # update infrastructure only
          tlmgr update --self --all  # update infrastructure and all packages
          tlmgr update --force --all # update all packages but *not* infrastructure
                                     # ... this last at your own risk, not recommended!

    --dry-run
        Nothing is actually installed; instead, the actions to be performed
        are written to the terminal. This is a more detailed report than
        "--list".

    --list [pkg]
        Concisely list the packages which would be updated, newly installed,
        or removed, without actually changing anything. If "--all" is also
        given, all available updates are listed. If "--self" is given, but
        not "--all", only updates to the critical packages (tlmgr, texlive
        infrastructure, perl on Windows, etc.) are listed. If neither
        "--all" nor "--self" is given, and in addition no pkg is given, then
        "--all" is assumed (thus, "tlmgr update --list" is the same as
        "tlmgr update --list --all"). If neither "--all" nor "--self" is
        given, but specific package names are given, those packages are
        checked for updates.

    --exclude pkg
        Exclude pkg from the update process. If this option is given more
        than once, its arguments accumulate.

        An argument pkg excludes both the package pkg itself and all its
        related platform-specific packages pkg.ARCH. For example,

          tlmgr update --all --exclude a2ping

        will not update "a2ping", "a2ping.i386-linux", or any other
        "a2ping."ARCH package.

        If this option specifies a package that would otherwise be a
        candidate for auto-installation, auto-removal, or reinstallation of
        a forcibly removed package, "tlmgr" quits with an error message.
        Excludes are not supported in these circumstances.

    --no-auto-remove [pkg]...
        By default, "tlmgr" tries to remove packages which have disappeared
        on the server, as described above under "--all". This option
        prevents such removals, either for all packages (with "--all"), or
        for just the given pkg names. This can lead to an inconsistent TeX
        installation, since packages are not infrequently renamed or
        replaced by their authors. Therefore this is not recommend.

    --no-auto-install [pkg]...
        Under normal circumstances "tlmgr" will install packages which are
        new on the server, as described above under "--all". This option
        prevents any such automatic installation, either for all packages
        (with "--all"), or the given pkg names.

        Furthermore, after the "tlmgr" run using this has finished, the
        packages that would have been auto-installed will be considered as
        forcibly removed. So, if "foobar" is the only new package on the
        server, then

          tlmgr update --all --no-auto-install

        is equivalent to

          tlmgr update --all
          tlmgr remove --force foobar

    --reinstall-forcibly-removed
        Under normal circumstances "tlmgr" will not install packages that
        have been forcibly removed by the user; that is, removed with
        "remove --force", or whose installation was prohibited by
        "--no-auto-install" during an earlier update.

        This option makes "tlmgr" ignore the forcible removals and
        re-install all such packages. This can be used to completely
        synchronize an installation with the server's idea of what is
        available:

          tlmgr update --reinstall-forcibly-removed --all

    --backup
    --backupdir directory
        These two options control the creation of backups of packages before
        updating; that is, backup of packages as currently installed. If
        neither options is given, no backup will made saved. If
        "--backupdir" is given and specifies a writable directory then a
        backup will be made in that location. If only "--backup" is given,
        then a backup will be made to the directory previously set via the
        "option" action (see below). If both are given then a backup will be
        made to the specified directory.

        You can also set options via the "/option" action to automatically
        make backups for all packages, and/or keep only a certain number of
        backups.

        "tlmgr" always makes a temporary backup when updating packages, in
        case of download or other failure during an update. In contrast, the
        purpose of this "--backup" option is to save a persistent backup in
        case the actual content of the update causes problems, e.g.,
        introduces an TeX incompatibility.

        The "restore" action explains how to restore from a backup.

    --no-depends
        If you call for updating a package normally all depending packages
        will also be checked for updates and updated if necessary. This
        switch suppresses this behavior.

    --no-depends-at-all
        See above under install (and beware).

    --force
        Force update of normal packages, without updating "tlmgr" itself
        (unless the "--self" option is also given). Not recommended.

        Also, "update --list" is still performed regardless of this option.

    If the package on the server is older than the package already installed
    (e.g., if the selected mirror is out of date), "tlmgr" does not
    downgrade. Also, packages for uninstalled platforms are not installed.

    "tlmgr" saves a copy of the "texlive.tlpdb" file used for an update with
    a suffix representing the repository url, as in
    "tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb."long-hash-string. These can be useful for fallback
    information, but if you don't like them accumulating (e.g.,
    "mirror.ctan.org" resolves to many different hosts, each resulting in a
    possibly different hash), it's harmless to delete them.

CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR
    There are two configuration files for "tlmgr": One is system-wide in
    "TEXMFSYSCONFIG/tlmgr/config", and the other is user-specific in
    "TEXMFCONFIG/tlmgr/config". The user-specific one is the default for the
    "conf tlmgr" action. (Run "kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFSYSCONFIG" or "...
    TEXMFCONFIG ..." to see the actual directory names.)

    A few defaults corresponding to command-line options can be set in these
    configuration files. In addition, the system-wide file can contain a
    directive to restrict the allowed actions.

    In these config files, empty lines and lines starting with # are
    ignored. All other lines must look like:

      key = value

    where the spaces are optional but the "=" is required.

    The allowed keys are:

    "auto-remove", value 0 or 1 (default 1), same as command-line option.
    "gui-expertmode", value 0 or 1 (default 1). This switches between the
    full GUI and a simplified GUI with only the most common settings.
    "gui-lang" llcode, with a language code value as with the command-line
    option.
    "no-checksums", value 0 or 1 (default 0, see below).
    "persistent-downloads", value 0 or 1 (default 1), same as command-line
    option.
    "require-verification", value 0 or 1 (default 0), same as command-line
    option.
    "verify-downloads", value 0 or 1 (default 1), same as command-line
    option.

    The system-wide config file can contain one additional key:

    "allowed-actions" action1 [,action,...] The value is a comma-separated
    list of "tlmgr" actions which are allowed to be executed when "tlmgr" is
    invoked in system mode (that is, without "--usermode").
        This allows distributors to include the "tlmgr" in their packaging,
        but allow only a restricted set of actions that do not interfere
        with their distro package manager. For native TeX Live
        installations, it doesn't make sense to set this.

    The "no-checksums" key needs more explanation. By default, package
    checksums computed and stored on the server (in the TLPDB) are compared
    to checksums computed locally after downloading. That is, for each
    "texlive.tlpdb" loaded from a repository, the corresponding checksum
    file "texlive.tlpdb.sha512" is also downloaded, and "tlmgr" confirms
    whether the checksum of the downloaded TLPDB file agrees with the
    download data. "no-checksums" disables this process.

    The checksum algorithm is SHA-512. Your system must have one of (looked
    for in this order) the Perl "Digest::SHA" module, the "openssl" program
    (<http://openssl.org>), the "sha512sum" program (from GNU Coreutils,
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils>), or finally the "shasum"
    program (just to support old Macs). If none of these are available, a
    warning is issued and "tlmgr" proceeds without checking checksums.
    (Incidentally, other SHA implementations, such as the pure Perl and pure
    Lua modules, are much too slow to be usable in our context.)
    "no-checksums" avoids the warning.

CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION
    "tlmgr" and "install-tl" perform cryptographic verification if possible.
    If verification is performed and successful, the programs report
    "(verified)" after loading the TLPDB; otherwise, they report "(not
    verified)". Either way, by default the installation and/or updates
    proceed normally.

    The attempted verification can be suppressed by specifying
    "--no-verify-downloads" on the command line, or the entry
    "verify-downloads = 0" in a "tlmgr" config file (described in
    "CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR"). On the other hand, it is possible to
    require verification by specifying "--require-verification" on the
    command line, or "require-verification = 1" in a "tlmgr" config file; in
    this case, if verification is not possible, the program quits.

    Cryptographic verification requires checksum checking (described just
    above) to succeed, and a working GnuPG ("gpg") program (see below for
    search method). Then, unless cryptographic verification has been
    disabled, a signature file ("texlive.tlpdb.*.asc") of the checksum file
    is downloaded and the signature verified. The signature is created by
    the TeX Live Distribution GPG key 0x06BAB6BC, which in turn is signed by
    Karl Berry's key 0x30D155AD and Norbert Preining's key 0x6CACA448. All
    of these keys are obtainable from the standard key servers.

    Additional trusted keys can be added using the "key" action.

  Configuration of GnuPG invocation
    The executable used for GnuPG is searched as follows: If the environment
    variable "TL_GNUPG" is set, it is tested and used; otherwise "gpg" is
    checked; finally "gpg2" is checked.

    Further adaptation of the "gpg" invocation can be made using the two
    environment variables "TL_GNUPGHOME", which is passed to "gpg" as the
    value for "--homedir", and "TL_GNUPGARGS", which replaces the default
    options "--no-secmem-warning --no-permission-warning".

USER MODE
    "tlmgr" provides a restricted way, called ``user mode'', to manage
    arbitrary texmf trees in the same way as the main installation. For
    example, this allows people without write permissions on the
    installation location to update/install packages into a tree of their
    own.

    "tlmgr" is switched into user mode with the command line option
    "--usermode". It does not switch automatically, nor is there any
    configuration file setting for it. Thus, this option has to be
    explicitly given every time user mode is to be activated.

    This mode of "tlmgr" works on a user tree, by default the value of the
    "TEXMFHOME" variable. This can be overridden with the command line
    option "--usertree". In the following when we speak of the user tree we
    mean either "TEXMFHOME" or the one given on the command line.

    Not all actions are allowed in user mode; "tlmgr" will warn you and not
    carry out any problematic actions. Currently not supported (and probably
    will never be) is the "platform" action. The "gui" action is currently
    not supported, but may be in a future release.

    Some "tlmgr" actions don't need any write permissions and thus work the
    same in user mode and normal mode. Currently these are: "check", "help",
    "list", "print-platform", "search", "show", "version".

    On the other hand, most of the actions dealing with package management
    do need write permissions, and thus behave differently in user mode, as
    described below: "install", "update", "remove", "option", "paper",
    "generate", "backup", "restore", "uninstall", "symlinks".

    Before using "tlmgr" in user mode, you have to set up the user tree with
    the "init-usertree" action. This creates usertree"/web2c" and
    usertree"/tlpkg/tlpobj", and a minimal usertree"/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb".
    At that point, you can tell "tlmgr" to do the (supported) actions by
    adding the "--usermode" command line option.

    In user mode the file usertree"/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb" contains only the
    packages that have been installed into the user tree using "tlmgr", plus
    additional options from the ``virtual'' package "00texlive.installation"
    (similar to the main installation's "texlive.tlpdb").

    All actions on packages in user mode can only be carried out on packages
    that are known as "relocatable". This excludes all packages containing
    executables and a few other core packages. Of the 2500 or so packages
    currently in TeX Live the vast majority are relocatable and can be
    installed into a user tree.

    Description of changes of actions in user mode:

  User mode install
    In user mode, the "install" action checks that the package and all
    dependencies are all either relocated or already installed in the system
    installation. If this is the case, it unpacks all containers to be
    installed into the user tree (to repeat, that's either "TEXMFHOME" or
    the value of "--usertree") and add the respective packages to the user
    tree's "texlive.tlpdb" (creating it if need be).

    Currently installing a collection in user mode installs all dependent
    packages, but in contrast to normal mode, does not install dependent
    collections. For example, in normal mode "tlmgr install
    collection-context" would install "collection-basic" and other
    collections, while in user mode, only the packages mentioned in
    "collection-context" are installed.

    If a package shipping map files is installed in user mode, a backup of
    the user's "updmap.cfg" in "USERTREE/web2c/" is made, and then this file
    regenerated from the list of installed packages.

  User mode backup, restore, remove, update
    In user mode, these actions check that all packages to be acted on are
    installed in the user tree before proceeding; otherwise, they behave
    just as in normal mode.

  User mode generate, option, paper
    In user mode, these actions operate only on the user tree's
    configuration files and/or "texlive.tlpdb". creates configuration files
    in user tree

MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES
    The main TeX Live repository contains a vast array of packages.
    Nevertheless, additional local repositories can be useful to provide
    locally-installed resources, such as proprietary fonts and house styles.
    Also, alternative package repositories distribute packages that cannot
    or should not be included in TeX Live, for whatever reason.

    The simplest and most reliable method is to temporarily set the
    installation source to any repository (with the "-repository" or "option
    repository" command line options), and perform your operations.

    When you are using multiple repositories over a sustained length of
    time, however, explicitly switching between them becomes inconvenient.
    Thus, it's possible to tell "tlmgr" about additional repositories you
    want to use. The basic command is "tlmgr repository add". The rest of
    this section explains further.

    When using multiple repositories, one of them has to be set as the main
    repository, which distributes most of the installed packages. When you
    switch from a single repository installation to a multiple repository
    installation, the previous sole repository will be set as the main
    repository.

    By default, even if multiple repositories are configured, packages are
    still only installed from the main repository. Thus, simply adding a
    second repository does not actually enable installation of anything from
    there. You also have to specify which packages should be taken from the
    new repository, by specifying so-called ``pinning'' rules, described
    next.

  Pinning
    When a package "foo" is pinned to a repository, a package "foo" in any
    other repository, even if it has a higher revision number, will not be
    considered an installable candidate.

    As mentioned above, by default everything is pinned to the main
    repository. Let's now go through an example of setting up a second
    repository and enabling updates of a package from it.

    First, check that we have support for multiple repositories, and have
    only one enabled (as is the case by default):

     $ tlmgr repository list
     List of repositories (with tags if set):
       /var/www/norbert/tlnet

    Ok. Let's add the "tlcontrib" repository (this is a real repository,
    hosted at <http://tlcontrib.metatex.org>, maintained by Taco Hoekwater
    et al.), with the tag "tlcontrib":

     $ tlmgr repository add http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012 tlcontrib

    Check the repository list again:

     $ tlmgr repository list
     List of repositories (with tags if set):
        http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2012 (tlcontrib)
        /var/www/norbert/tlnet (main)

    Now we specify a pinning entry to get the package "context" from
    "tlcontrib":

     $ tlmgr pinning add tlcontrib context

    Check that we can find "context":

     $ tlmgr show context
     tlmgr: package repositories:
     ...
     package:     context
     repository:  tlcontrib/26867
     ...

    - install "context":

     $ tlmgr install context
     tlmgr: package repositories:
     ...
     [1/1,  ??:??/??:??] install: context @tlcontrib [

    In the output here you can see that the "context" package has been
    installed from the "tlcontrib" repository (@tlcontrib).

    Finally, "tlmgr pinning" also supports removing certain or all packages
    from a given repository:

      $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib context  # remove just context
      $ tlmgr pinning remove tlcontrib --all    # take nothing from tlcontrib

    A summary of the "tlmgr pinning" actions is given above.

    The graphical user interface for "tlmgr" requires Perl/Tk
    <http://search.cpan.org/search?query=perl%2Ftk>. For Windows the
    necessary modules are shipped within TeX Live, for all other (i.e.,
    Unix-based) systems Perl/Tk (as well as Perl of course) has to be
    installed outside of TL. <http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk> has
    a list of invocations for some distros.

    The GUI is started with the invocation "tlmgr gui"; assuming Tk is
    loadable, the graphical user interface will be shown. The main window
    contains a menu bar, the main display, and a status area where messages
    normally shown on the console are displayed.

    Within the main display there are three main parts: the "Display
    configuration" area, the list of packages, and the action buttons.

    Also, at the top right the currently loaded repository is shown; this
    also acts as a button and when clicked will try to load the default
    repository. To load a different repository, see the "tlmgr" menu item.

    Finally, the status area at the bottom of the window gives additional
    information about what is going on.

  Main display
   Display configuration area
    The first part of the main display allows you to specify (filter) which
    packages are shown. By default, all are shown. Changes here are
    reflected right away.

    Status
        Select whether to show all packages (the default), only those
        installed, only those not installed, or only those with update
        available.

    Category
        Select which categories are shown: packages, collections, and/or
        schemes. These are briefly explained in the "DESCRIPTION" section
        above.

    Match
        Select packages matching for a specific pattern. By default, this
        searches both descriptions and filenames. You can also select a
        subset for searching.

    Selection
        Select packages to those selected, those not selected, or all. Here,
        ``selected'' means that the checkbox in the beginning of the line of
        a package is ticked.

    Display configuration buttons
        To the right there are three buttons: select all packages, select
        none (a.k.a. deselect all), and reset all these filters to the
        defaults, i.e., show all available.

   Package list area
    The second are of the main display lists all installed packages. If a
    repository is loaded, those that are available but not installed are
    also listed.

    Double clicking on a package line pops up an informational window with
    further details: the long description, included files, etc.

    Each line of the package list consists of the following items:

    a checkbox
        Used to select particular packages; some of the action buttons (see
        below) work only on the selected packages.

    package name
        The name (identifier) of the package as given in the database.

    local revision (and version)
        If the package is installed the TeX Live revision number for the
        installed package will be shown. If there is a catalogue version
        given in the database for this package, it will be shown in
        parentheses. However, the catalogue version, unlike the TL revision,
        is not guaranteed to reflect what is actually installed.

    remote revision (and version)
        If a repository has been loaded the revision of the package in the
        repository (if present) is shown. As with the local column, if a
        catalogue version is provided it will be displayed. And also as with
        the local column, the catalogue version may be stale.

    short description
        The short description of the package.

   Main display action buttons
    Below the list of packages are several buttons:

    Update all installed
        This calls "tlmgr update --all", i.e., tries to update all available
        packages. Below this button is a toggle to allow reinstallation of
        previously removed packages as part of this action.

        The other four buttons only work on the selected packages, i.e.,
        those where the checkbox at the beginning of the package line is
        ticked.

    Update
        Update only the selected packages.

    Install
        Install the selected packages; acts like "tlmgr install", i.e., also
        installs dependencies. Thus, installing a collection installs all
        its constituent packages.

    Remove
        Removes the selected packages; acts like "tlmgr remove", i.e., it
        will also remove dependencies of collections (but not dependencies
        of normal packages).

    Backup
        Makes a backup of the selected packages; acts like "tlmgr backup".
        This action needs the option "backupdir" set (see "Options -"
        General>).

  Menu bar
    The following entries can be found in the menu bar:

    "tlmgr" menu
        The items here load various repositories: the default as specified
        in the TeX Live database, the default network repository, the
        repository specified on the command line (if any), and an
        arbitrarily manually-entered one. Also has the so-necessary "quit"
        operation.

    "Options menu"
        Provides access to several groups of options: "Paper" (configuration
        of default paper sizes), "Platforms" (only on Unix, configuration of
        the supported/installed platforms), "GUI Language" (select language
        used in the GUI interface), and "General" (everything else).

        Several toggles are also here. The first is "Expert options", which
        is set by default. If you turn this off, the next time you start the
        GUI a simplified screen will be shown that display only the most
        important functionality. This setting is saved in the configuration
        file of "tlmgr"; see "CONFIGURATION FILE FOR TLMGR" for details.

        The other toggles are all off by default: for debugging output, to
        disable the automatic installation of new packages, and to disable
        the automatic removal of packages deleted from the server. Playing
        with the choices of what is or isn't installed may lead to an
        inconsistent TeX Live installation; e.g., when a package is renamed.

    "Actions menu"
        Provides access to several actions: update the filename database
        (aka "ls-R", "mktexlsr", "texhash"), rebuild all formats
        ("fmtutil-sys --all"), update the font map database ("updmap-sys"),
        restore from a backup of a package, and use of symbolic links in
        system directories (not on Windows).

        The final action is to remove the entire TeX Live installation (also
        not on Windows).

    "Help menu"
        Provides access to the TeX Live manual (also on the web at
        <http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html>) and the usual ``About'' box.

  GUI options
    Some generic Perl/Tk options can be specified with "tlmgr gui" to
    control the display:

    "-background" color
        Set background color.

    "-font "" fontname fontsize """
        Set font, e.g., "tlmgr gui -font "helvetica 18"". The argument to
        "-font" must be quoted, i.e., passed as a single string.

    "-foreground" color
        Set foreground color.

    "-geometry" geomspec
        Set the X geometry, e.g., "tlmgr gui -geometry 1024x512-0+0" creates
        the window of (approximately) the given size in the upper-right
        corner of the display.

    "-xrm" xresource
        Pass the arbitrary X resource string xresource.

    A few other obscure options are recognized but not mentioned here. See
    the Perl/Tk documentation (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Tk>) for the
    complete list, and any X documentation for general information.

MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT
    With the "--machine-readable" option, "tlmgr" writes to stdout in the
    fixed line-oriented format described here, and the usual informational
    messages for human consumption are written to stderr (normally they are
    written to stdout). The idea is that a program can get all the
    information it needs by reading stdout.

    Currently this option only applies to the update, install, and "option"
    actions.

  Machine-readable "update" and "install" output
    The output format is as follows:

      fieldname "\t" value
      ...
      "end-of-header"
      pkgname status localrev serverrev size runtime esttot
      ...
      "end-of-updates"
      other output from post actions, not in machine readable form

    The header section currently has two fields: "location-url" (the
    repository source from which updates are being drawn), and "total-bytes"
    (the total number of bytes to be downloaded).

    The localrev and serverrev fields for each package are the revision
    numbers in the local installation and server repository, respectively.
    The size field is the number of bytes to be downloaded, i.e., the size
    of the compressed tar file for a network installation, not the unpacked
    size. The runtime and esttot fields are only present for updated and
    auto-install packages, and contain the currently passed time since start
    of installation/updates and the estimated total time.

    Line endings may be either LF or CRLF depending on the current platform.

    "location-url" location
        The location may be a url (including "file:///foo/bar/..."), or a
        directory name ("/foo/bar"). It is the package repository from which
        the new package information was drawn.

    "total-bytes" count
        The count is simply a decimal number, the sum of the sizes of all
        the packages that need updating or installing (which are listed
        subsequently).

    Then comes a line with only the literal string "end-of-header".

    Each following line until a line with literal string "end-of-updates"
    reports on one package. The fields on each line are separated by a tab.
    Here are the fields.

    pkgname
        The TeX Live package identifier, with a possible platform suffix for
        executables. For instance, "pdftex" and "pdftex.i386-linux" are
        given as two separate packages, one on each line.

    status
        The status of the package update. One character, as follows:

        "d"     The package was removed on the server.

        "f"     The package was removed in the local installation, even
                though a collection depended on it. (E.g., the user ran
                "tlmgr remove --force".)

        "u"     Normal update is needed.

        "r"     Reversed non-update: the locally-installed version is newer
                than the version on the server.

        "a"     Automatically-determined need for installation, the package
                is new on the server and is (most probably) part of an
                installed collection.

        "i"     Package will be installed and isn't present in the local
                installation (action install).

        "I"     Package is already present but will be reinstalled (action
                install).

    localrev
        The revision number of the installed package, or "-" if it is not
        present locally.

    serverrev
        The revision number of the package on the server, or "-" if it is
        not present on the server.

    size
        The size in bytes of the package on the server. The sum of all the
        package sizes is given in the "total-bytes" header field mentioned
        above.

    runtime
        The run time since start of installations or updates.

    esttot
        The estimated total time.

  Machine-readable "option" output
    The output format is as follows:

      key "\t" value

    If a value is not saved in the database the string "(not set)" is shown.

    If you are developing a program that uses this output, and find that
    changes would be helpful, do not hesitate to write the mailing list.

You should also take into account that TeX Live is intended for users, not
for developers. If I see that a toll has too many releases within a short
time, I became afraid that it is released in a buggy state and hence I
cannot rely that it works. Or it may just evolve so rapidly which in turn
means that there is a high risk that after an update my work chains will
stop to work. I think that developers should first think what is really
necessary to release to public and what is just intended for developers
needing the bleeding edge and for beta testers..

I am the guy who has been packaging KOMA-Script for a while now. I have
automated so much of the upload process it takes me way less than 5 minutes
to get it done. And KOMA-Script consists of 1000s of files. Why don't you
create a make target which creates the necessary files for CTAN and upload
each major release. Your work seems to be pretty cool, it could be helpful
for a lot of users.

The TeX community has given you TeX/LaTeX, by providing your work to the
community you give something back. :-)

not really. I was just distracted by too many other things which came in along. Discussions and questions help me to raise the priority. Thus things should become slightly better wrt the upload automation now;-)

    Is it possible to update the package via an API or would I have to go to
    the website manually each time I release a new version?

CTAN not providing a dedicated API does not have to be a barrier. Just
write a simple script to POST to the form at ctan.org/upload. I surmise
that is simpler than what any API could provide, anyway. --best, karl.

We already have such a script on CTAN. Unfortunately it assumes an old version of the upload form. Thus it is disfuctional now (and the author is unreachable).
An API has the advantage that CTAN will provide a documented and reliable interface which can be used for this purpose -- not relying on a volatile web form.

The API itself is already in place. I am working on the documentation and testing and on a script for the client side to simplify the upload: edit a configuration file and invoke a command on the command line (which can be integrated in any build and deployment tool).

Hi

Very simple, this is *NOT* a mirror of CTAN, but a fake/stupid page.
Please don't use it.

How did you came to the idea to use this one?

Hi Nico,
how comprehensive is the Crossref database used by betterbib?
What does it support?

Crossref database contains about 100 million entries for science
publications. It's fed from the publishers themselves. On average, I would
estimate it knows about 80% of the publications cited in any given paper.

Cheers,

Sounds just like what I'd need; I'll keep an eye on the development. For
now, I'll just continue publishing betterbib on PyPi.

Thank you for your effort.  I just too a quick look into Crossref, and
was feeling a bit disappointed of the provided data.  I'm in the field
of Software Engineering/Formal Verification and the examples I checked
were not of a very high quality.

If it doesn't need too much work, I would suggest to query DBLP [1]
especially for publications in computer science.  They have more than
3.3 million publications only from computer science in their index, and
edit the entry's data to increase the level of comprehensiveness.  The
same might hold for other disciplines and sources.

Regards,
  Stephan

Thanks Stephan for the good suggestion. I've filed an issue for DBLP [1] to
which you can subscribe if you want to keep track. It's a bit weird that
they don't provide DOIs, but it looks like they provide a nice API so it
shouldn't be too difficult to do.

Cheers,
Nico

Dear Nico,

there is a DOI search and if I export an entry into BibTeX I get a DOI
as well.

I've seen this, but the API doesn't expose this information. Probably an
unfortunate oversight.

Hi,

some mostly cosmetic things found in texlive.tlpdb:
-some packages depend on themselves, is it worth if i provide a list to 
remove these deps?
-package amsfonts has some spaces here "execute addMap      euler.map", 
should be "one" space.
-pmxchords.ARCH consists of a single link, pointing to pmxchords.lua, no 
binary involved at all. Is it against some policy that this link isn't 
in package pmxchords?

Hi Johannes,

    -some packages depend on themselves, is it worth if i provide a list to 
    remove these deps?

I'm happy to see the list, at least. It may be a result of some
dependency (semi-)auto-generation.

    -package amsfonts has some spaces here "execute addMap      euler.map", 
    should be "one" space.

It doesn't hurt to have multiple spaces. It's just to make the .tlpsrc
file prettier. No change needed.

    -pmxchords.ARCH consists of a single link, pointing to pmxchords.lua, no 
    binary involved at all. Is it against some policy that this link isn't 
    in package pmxchords?

No, this is normal. The .ARCH subpackages are present when a package
installs anything in the bin/ARCH/ subdirs. Whether it installs a
binary, script, or symlink is immaterial.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Johannes,
there are no links to scripts in texlive.tlpdb at all.  Symlink
targets depend on where the texmf trees are located relative to the
bin/ directory and this is configurable at install time.  Furthermore,
there are no symlinks on Windows and we have to use wrapper scripts
instead.

Sorry for the noise, I overlooked the *.ARCH entries.

Indeed, seems to be a problem with our script that auto-generated
dependencies for formats. We will look into it.

Hi Dr. Werner,

I don't know if this can help, but a C program is available;
You can obtain chkfont.c from dviout subversion
http://tug.org/svn/dviout/trunk/
and it can be easily compiled using gcc or any other C compiler.

$ chkfont jis.vf

prints

        "jis.vf" is in VF format
        checksum                = 00000000
        design size             = 10485760 2^{-20} points = 10 points

Well, short and long descriptions are auto-generated from the TeX 
Catalogue, so as soon as there are entries for them, or the tlpsrc are
properly linked to some TC entry, they should show up.

Message-ID: <1DA7D4BE-7940-4392-9ED2-F4718CBE7E66@vallettaventures.com>

I am not sure if this is the correct place to send this bug report, if it is not, please let me know and I?ll post it to the correct list.

I work on Texpad, a LaTeX editor for macOS/iOS and we have come across what we believe to be a bug.  I have constructed a bash script to reproduce this bug (tested on macOS 10.12 with case insensitive HFS+, and on macOS 10.13 with APFS).

Running the script will create 3 pdfs in the /tmp/rootdir folder, all of which I believe should come out the same, however the 3rd pdf is missing some content.  This is because a subfile has not been loaded when I think it should be.  This happens when there is both a <somename.tex> file and a <somename> folder in the output folder, the <somename.tex> file will not be used.  It does not happen if it is not in an output folder, and it does not happen if that <somename> folder is not there.

I have attached the script and also uploaded as a gist here https://gist.github.com/vallettaventures/484ff776d045422b07b369c905e2a3f3 <https://gist.github.com/vallettaventures/484ff776d045422b07b369c905e2a3f3>

Hi Duncan - it's fine to report the problem here, although in principle
tex-k at tug.org would be a more specific place (no need to resend this
one). This behavior is presumably not particular to pdftex, as what
files get read in the presence of such conflicts is mostly resolved by
the common kpathsea code. I will take a look as soon as I can.

Thanks for the report. --karl

I cannot reproduce the bug on windows.
I have made an equivalent environment:

c:/temp/rootdir/outputfolder/subdir
c:/temp/rootdir/subdir
c:/temp/rootdir/subdir.tex
c:/temp/rootdir/main.tex

main.tex:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
1
\input{subdir}
3
\end{document}

subdir.tex:

2

In c:/temp/rootdir, I tried
pdflatex -output-directory c:/temp/rootdir/outputfolder main

I attach c:/temp/rootdir/outputfolder/main.log.
You can see that ./subdir.tex is successfully read.

Best,
Akira

I tested on OS X (10.11.6 El Capitan) and Windows 7.

With your bugreport.sh,

On OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan
The second and third pdfs are missing "2".

On Windows 7:
All pdfs are the same and correct.

This was my mistake, as I ran the script twice.
That means, only the third pdf is missing "2".

---

The behavior of -output-directory is described in web2c/lib/openclose.c;

 ??? /* Look in -output-directory first, if the filename is not
 ?????? absolute.? This is because .aux and other such files will get
 ?????? written to the output directory, and we have to be able to read
 ?????? them from there.? We only look for the name as-is.? */
 ??? if (output_directory && !kpse_absolute_p (nameoffile+1, false)) {
 ??????? fname = concat3 (output_directory, DIR_SEP_STRING, nameoffile + 1);
 ??????? *f_ptr = fopen (fname, fopen_mode);

So, the file name should be as-is (including the file extension).
I'm not sure this is a desirable behavior or not.

The different behavior on win32 is due to the behavior of fopen().
fopen(dirname, "r") returns NULL on Windows, but returns a valid
pointer on Unix file system.

Subject: [tex-live] that nasty \undefined in supp-pdf.mkii again
Message-ID: <20171024031437.xspzigacxbnwkqf5@burischnitzel.preining.info>

Dear all,

back in 2010 (!!!) https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2010-March/025102.html
I complained about the fact that a minimal tex document
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  \newcommand{\undefined}{\textbf{undefined}}
  \begin{document}
  This is an \undefined\ command.
  \end{document}
does not work anymore. This was due to the auto-loading of supp-pdf.mkii
that was introduced in TL2009 (or so).

The reason is that supp-pdf.mkii uses
  \ifx\writestatus\undefined
to check for an undefined commands.

I argued that this is wrong to do it this way, especially since this
is loaded now in LaTeX. See
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2010-March/025107.html

There was the conclusion that pdftex.def should deal with this and
Heiko send a fixed pftex.def:
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2010-March/025126.html

I tested that and it worked.

But alas here we are in 2017 and a colleague just asked me the very same
question, because he writes a logic text book and uses \undefined as
a macro.

Can we somehow work that out again?

All the best

Norbert

I have to say I'm surprised anyone would use \undefined as a macro, but
I guess as it's a 'user' name (cf. LaTeX's \@ifundefined) then there's
always a chance.

Heiko's earlier mail doesn't say what fix he proposed, and the old FTP
site is no longer available. It seems most likely that the approach of
ensuring \undefined is really not defined is likely to be best,
something like altering the current

    \InputIfFileExists{supp-pdf.mkii}{}{}%

to

    \let\GPT at saved@undefined\undefined
    \let\undefined\GPT at undefined
    \InputIfFileExists{supp-pdf.mkii}{}{}%
    \let\undefined\GPT at saved@undefined

I guess will do it. I'll discuss with David C.

Hi Joseph,

If you discuss programming languages or syntax or similar, there is
a chance that \undefined is used as a proper macro. Nothing that
is queer to me.

Indeed, I tried that, too.

You can see the changes in older pdftex.def. E.g. in one from TL14 I
see

\def\GPT at catcodes#1{%
  \expandafter\edef\csname GPT at restore@#1\endcsname{%
    \let\noexpand\undefined
        \expandafter\noexpand\csname GPTorg@#1 at undefined\endcsname
    \let\expandafter\noexpand\csname GPTorg@#1 at undefined\endcsname
        \noexpand\@undefined

and so on ...

Ah yes: part of the rather 'extended' catcode business that was there.

Concerning TeX development I am just a casual bystander. But as far as I
understand only packages and updates that are uploaded to CTAN will make
it in TeX Live. Certainly, we can't expect TL maintainers to permanently
scan the entire web for anything that might be useful.

So the actual contact persons would be the aastex developers. If they
upload 6.1 to CTAN it will end up in Tex Live - otherwise it won't.

However, after reading

<http://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex/linux.html>

I got the impression that they might have their reasons for not
releasing it to CTAN.

In theory, the TeX Live maintainers may decide to make an exception to the
rule and include a package not published on CTAN. However, a package can be
included only if it has a free license. I do not see any license on the
aastex web and without the license the maintainers are not allowed to
include the package.

Hi,

I contacted the journal and immediately got a response from Greg Schwarz, the AAS Journals Data Editor, that updating AASTeX in CTAN was on his radar. He has been uploading it routinely:

https://ctan.org/pkg/aastex

But he hasn't updated 6.1 yet because he is working on a few bug fixes first.

Thanks!
Leo

My guess is that you are using Debian or Ubuntu, right? Because in TeX
Live upstream that is called
  collectioon-publishers
and Debian/Ubuntu use the package name
  texlive-publishers

In this case it depends on your release of Debian/Ubuntu, and there is
nothing we here can do.

Next: I have checked our side (TeX Live) and here there is AASTeX is not
updated.

So please upload yourself or request an upload of the update to CTAN,
after which it will enter TeX Live semi-automatically within a few days.

Thanks

Norbert

Hi,

`tlmgr conf`'s output contains near top

and explicit full paths for various executables inclusive
of pdftex and dvipdfmx

it does not report situation for xetex/luatex, 

perhaps the info could be added?

This is in case one needs to help someone having PATH problems,
of course seeing that tex, pdftex, dvipdfmx all look right
is ample enough information that xetex and luatex are visible
too, but well...

I also prefer PATH* environment variables to be printed in a readable
form.  Something like

  echo $PATH | tr : \\n

or similar, for PATH, MANPATH, and INFOPATH.

No line should contain more than 79 characters, whenever possible.

Not sure if this is a good idea since there are soooo many PATH
and many kpathsea variable where expansion could be tricky.

I've added DBLP to betterbib now. Use with

betterbib --source dblp in.bib out.bib

Hi,

yesterday I was using TeXWork and than the program crashed while I started
the run.

It appeared a popup notification of error status 0xc0000020. Than I tried
to uninstall a re-install tex live several times, but the full scheme
always stop its installation.

Now I don't know how to fix the problem and re-install TeXLive.

Before the crash I had updated the laptop with "Cumulative update for
windows 10 Version 1709 for amd64-based Systems (KB4043961)", may it cause
this issue? How can I solve it?

I hope you had enough information in order to help me.

Thank you,

Francesco Zamboni

Thanks, Norbert for the quick adjustment of "tlmgr conf" output to 
produce more readable tabular output.

Could you please consider sorting the lines in each of the output
blocks too?  The current output has unpredictable order of the
program and environment variable names.

Yes. But everything I find about error 0xc0000020 indicates that
your windows is in trouble.

But if windows works nevertheless ok, I suggest that you use the
advanced installer and see whether you can install a smaller scheme.
Afterwards, you can still try to add everything else by installing
the full scheme via TeX Live Manager.

some packages containing metafonts aren't tagged with font-mf in

esrelation euxm feyn knuthotherfonts niceframe montex vntex fdsymbol

Please inform the TeX Catalogue (CTAN) people, we just take what is in there.

I surmise CTAN will take care of this; as Norbert said, we just take the

Subject: [tex-live] [Tex Live] Not updating on portable drive
Message-ID: <002201d3517c$ba7942a0$2f6bc7e0$@asme.org>

I have Tex Live on a portable drive and on my Windows 10 computer.

I can update Tex Live on my computer but when I try to update it on my thumb
drive I receive a not updates available message.

Is there a fix to this other than a reinstall on my thumb drive.

 

Thank you.

Joe

No, on the command line. Please open a CMD terminal (or Powershell) and
type in
  tlmgr repository
and send the output.

I get 404 on that, that is probably a bad mirror.

On the drive do:
  tlmgr option repository http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet
and that should be enough.

Subject: [tex-live] Beware of CTAN today :)
Message-ID: <1a2f1759-6fdd-4780-67d6-e60c2c323535@gmail.com>

I want to report a CTAN-related injury!

I was sitting in front of my computer, minding my own business, when 
Ulrike mentioned CTAN had a nice Halloween theme. Cool, I decided to 
check it out!

Headphones on, 85% volume. In retrospect, it was a terrible idea. :)

All of a sudden, a huge scream from the site! I got scared and fell off 
my chair! Nothing hurt, except my feelings of being an idiot. :)

BEWARE, THERE'S SOME SORT OF SPOOKY SCARY THINGY IN CTAN!

Happy witch hunting. :)

Cheerio,

Paulo
