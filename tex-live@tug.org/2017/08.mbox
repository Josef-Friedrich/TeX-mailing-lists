Don has fixed the offending CWEB code 'skew-ternary-calc.w', so that it
should work with either version of 'epsf.tex'. The canonical way to
place an '\epsfbox' together with other material in one math display is
to wrap it in an '\hbox'.

Yes, that is what I wrote. *into* the project directory.

Please read the documentation, I don't know.

Message-ID: <CAMnMovJYHOjJpQgGgZc2vjXKxAOhK9qcY5DOTtVKGsMcnu0OEg@mail.gmail.com>

hi there,

I just installed on a brand new machine the TeXlive 2017 using Enrico
Gregorio's guide
<http://profs.scienze.univr.it/~gregorio/texlive-YEAR-ubuntu.pdf>

Everything is fine except for the fact that when I launch the tlmgr I get
the following error:

afcuttin at millenium-falcon:~/idic-comml$ sutlmgr
Loading local TeX Live database
(/usr/local/texlive/2017/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb)
This may take some time, please be patient ...
bad pad value "2m": must be positive screen distance at
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl5/5.22/Tk/Widget.pm line 1218.
at /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 295.
Compilation failed in require at /opt/texbin/tlmgr line 4724.

the command sutlmg is just an alias for sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr -gui as per
the installation guide.

Unfortunately it seems that Google is not my friend at finding a solution
to this error.

(BTW, this is also a question on TeX.stackexchange:
https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/384565/177)

thanks,

I have finally nailed a bug that I have been chasing for a while now ... in
which some simple numbers on a PDF file disappears under Evince display on
Linux after some routine TeXLive maintenance operations.

We have seen it for a few years now, after long sequences of operations of
instal/update/etc ... the Evince display would become messed up, and
yesterday I was able to nail it to the commands to make TeX fonts available
system-wide, recommended by Karl in Section 3.4.4 of the TL Reference
Manual:

cp $(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR)/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf
/etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf
fc-cache -fsv

Here are the displays of Evince and Xpdf, before and after the command is
ran.

Before:

[image: Inline image 1]
After:


[image: Inline image 3]
We use xelatex on the file below to generate the short PDF file:

\documentclass{minimal}
\RequirePackage{pst-barcode}

\begin{document}
    \psbarcode{978-85-8337-082-6}{includetext}{isbn}
\end{document}


This is On TL-2017 on Ubuntu 17.04.

Dou you have the same problem with the ean13isbn package? It makes use of
\vrule and fonts only, no postscript, no special tricks.

No we do not. ean13isbn works nicely and all the way up the chain to
luatex, in fact we have just changed to it because of these reasons.

I have one "complaint" though about ean13isbn. To make the title (ISBN
123456..) of the SAME size as the bar-code is NOT a requirement of the
standards, so allowing for a slightly larger size and a bit more detached
from the bars would make that part more readable (to humans), and so a
better bar-code.

Herbet,

The results of my "pdffonts" are exactly the same:

$ pdffonts barcode.pdf
name           type              encoding         emb sub uni object ID

Courier        Type 1            Standard         no  no  no       9  0

Did you run the two command I sent on the email?

*cp $(kpsewhich -var-value
**TEXMFSYSVAR)/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf *>*
/etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf
*

*fc-cache -fsv*It is only after you run them that you will see the problem.

Hi friends!

Paulo, I always run those two commands after a TL install/upgrade and I 
got the correct output in both Evince and Xpdf.

My setup: Fedora 26 x86_64 (all updates) + TL2017 (all updates). Just in 
case, that's my Evince version:

[paulo at cambridge ~] $ rpm -qa | grep evince-3
evince-3.24.0-3.fc26.x86_64

Cheerio!

Please look at the tug.org/texlive/debian.html page, I think it has to do with apparmor. On that page a lot of things are explained by a friend.

But it is a wild guess, no time for detailed reading, right in the middle of a move on houses...

I know that this is in the manual, but I *STRONGLY* advice against it.
There are some broken fonts, some that mess up fontconfig due to naming
issues, all kind of bad things can happen. In Debian I have been pushed
to do this for long time, but always rejected and recommend people
adding only those fonts one by one that they are actually use.

Just my 2Yen

I imagine people are doing this for the sake of XeTeX, and not really to
use TeX fonts in LibreOffice...so it should be on TL's lap the
responsibility to get these fonts to XeTeX without damaging anything else
on the machine - specially a PDF viewer, like Evince.

It definitely should come out of the manual -- because under the tow of
that section, tons of people are recommending that all over SX and other
places. Better yet, the section should probably say

     ** DO NOT DO THIS ** It was recommended in the past, but we know
better now that ....

In the TeX world we are acquainted with a lot of blind-recipes like updmap,
mktexlsr, texhash, ... some of them people have no idea what is going on,
so if it is  a recipe out there - it should be a good one!

I still do not know who is at fault here... Is it the PDF file?
PST-barcode? fc-cache? The machine? Evince?

Hi Paulo,

pdffonts says in our case emb=no which means that the font is not present
in the PDF. The rendering engines is then (almost) free to do whatever it
wants. Usually the engines have their built-in fonts. If a font with the
same name is found, it is usually used but it need not be the intended
font. If it is not found, the rendering engine often has replacement rules
and selects a font. If there is no matching replacement rule, either a
default font is used or nothing is displayed at all. Thius is why documents
without embedded fonts look differently in different viewers. Usually
ghostscript has reasonalbe replacements so you can often fix the problem by
post-processing the PDF file by ps2pdf (yes, it is able to build another
PDF from a PDF).

Well the fonts are not embedded. So you are more or less at the
mercy of the system fonts, the font configuration and the pdfviewer.

Do you see the problem also when you run latex+dvips+ps2pdf?

If yes you could try if it disappears if you embed the fonts
(https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/74307/2388), and then try to find
out how to do the same with xetex.

Subject: [tex-live] Packaging for invoice2 omits translations
Message-ID: <2e5350bb-5381-f4c3-9cfe-7f7e46bfc052@cs.tu-dortmund.de>

Hello all,

as far as I can tell, the ctan2tds script needs special handling for 
CTAN packages with .trsl files (translations w/ the translations 
package), which is missing for my invoice2 package. As a result, the 
localizations are missing at runtime.

The attached patch adds (by my understanding of the source code) the 
required exception for invoice2. I'd be happy if you could include this 
fix into TeX Live.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi Zdenek,

I did expect that embedding was the problem I was seeing, but I am after
the source of the problem -- because:

1- XeLaTeX embeds fonts by default, so if in this simple case it is not
embedding, something is wrong, possibly with PST-barcode, possibly XeTeX.

2- I have tons of files that do NOT have embedded Courier and Helvetica
(created by other tools) on my machine. The installation of TL should not
mess up with my ability to view them.

XeLaTeX embeds fonts if it is requested in the config file of xdvipdfmx
which is the default (for good reasons). PST-barcode creates an EPS file
and dvipdfmx inserts it to the output PDF. The fonts are embedded only if
they are embedded in the EPS file which is not the case.

The algorithms for representing unembedded fonts are quite complex and are
defined in the config files of the viewers. A subtle change in te font name
or font id may play a significant role. In addition, you never know what
are the exact substitution rule in a particular viewer. TL does not
interact with the PDF viewers.  Of course, you can manually install TL
fonts so that a particular PDF viewer will find them but you never know
what happens if you give the file without embedded fonts to someone else. I
have seen a lot of different problems, some of them really weird. And a few
years ago it cost me quite a lot of money because the phototypesetter
intepreted them in a really different way than my printer. Thus
verification of at least partial compatibility with PDF/X or PDF/A is a
must.

Zdenek,

Thanks for putting laying bare what is going on.

There are two issues here, one that is not TL's problem which is
PST-barcode producing files with Helvetica and Courier when the user has
not requested - it should use just plain standard TeX fonts, most probably
LM fonts, and use Helvetica and Courier only if the user so requests. I'll
take the issue up with Herbert.

The other one is - TL installation and maintenance should not interfere
with the way Evince displays a PDF. It works fine before and then it breaks
after the installation. As Norbert said it is probably doing something
really wrong with those two fonts.

The problem is not which fonts are used but they are not embedded. It is
not sufficient to just request LM or TeX Gyre, they must be embedded which
is not a simple tast without having a complete PostScript interpreter which
XeLaTeX is not.

The biggest problems I have ever seen were caused with Times, Helvetica and
Courier. Even Adobe violates its own specification. Another problem is
fontconfig because it does not always work according to its specification.
So the source of the trouble may be fontconfig, not TL, not Evince. It is
difficult to guess. I had two computers with the same version of Fedora,
the same version of TL, the same installed fonts, the same config files for
fonconfig. On one computer everything worked, on the other I got weird
errors. The problem was that fontconfig apparently did not obey the
configured order of directories when searching for the fonts.

Yeahhh ... but there is a huge difference in between the two here:

Embedding Helvetica and Courier are hard because the machine at play may
NOT have them to begin with.

Embedding LM or TeX Gyre is easy -- you just make a fake undisplayable text
(as part of the PDF file) with all the font characters -- in our specific
case only 14 characters are needed.

I hear what you are saying. Paulo Cereda has just told me that is is NOT
occurring on TL'17 under Fedora. So far we have seen it on all Ubuntu
machines we have installed since 2015. So it looks like the problem is
distribution specific.

It is not the TL installation, but the fact that you did make available all fonts to fontconfig. This is an optional step and of course influences *every* program that uses fontconfig.

They ask for a font name like "Helvetica" and fontconfig returns whatever thinks for best to it. By adding a bunch of fonts, several providing the name Helvetica or something similar, there will be a change.

Nothing TL can influence or change.

It is even more complex:
1. Each PDF viewer has its own substitution rules
2. Fontconfig has its own suibstitution rules

It is hard to say which rule wins. In addition, fonconfig is built in such
a way that it always returns a glyph. If the glyph does not exist in the
current font, it takes it from another font. Suppose that you want to
typeset citt? and you select a font containing only US ASCII. Fontconfig
returns c, i, t from the selected font but ? is not there, fonconfig
therefore selects it from another font which it considers compatible.

Okular has the most useful substitution rules at least for the documents
that I have to read but embedding is the only reliable solution. Do not
waste time by tweaking substitutions, it may work on your computer but you
will be surprised what can happen if you give your files to someone else.

Hi,

I'd like to report the following problem with gzip.exe from the TeXLive
distribution.
As far as I can see, this gzip.exe doesn't keep files timestamps when
compressing files.
This is a bug and it maybe worth tracking its source, in case it has an
impact somewhere
else in win32 TeXLive binaries.

Best regards,

Fabrice

Two developments today:

Herbert updated pst-barcode to embedd the fonts. CTAN will be updated
shortly.

I did confirm what Paulo Cereda said, Fedora 26 does not exhibit the
problem. In fact after checking some other machines, the problem seems to
be bound to Ubuntu.

That's exactly what I have written: if the fonts are not embedded, you
never know what happens if you give the file to somebody else.

In the future, copy and paste the relevant parts of the error message
text. No one wants to have to load an image viewer and zoom in to read
your text. Also, text in image files is not readily searchable from the
net and so in the future others with the same problem won't find the
solution.

A quick net search for

texlive "can't spawn cmd.exe"

revealed:

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/83363/problem-with-installing-tex-live-under-windows-8
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/139908/problem-installing-tex-live-under-windows-8-resistant-to-past-fixes
http://tex-live.tug.narkive.com/KwMPlG2t/error-on-texlive-2013-installation-can-t-spawn-cmd-exe

which suggests the most likely cause is an improper PATH variable
setup.

The original PATH variable can be found here:

https://superuser.com/questions/973153/standard-value-of-path-variable-windows-10

and is

%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\

in which %SystemRoot% is usually set to C:\Windows

It seems to show that the time stamp of 'test'

However, the time stamp is not restored by

gzip -d -N -vv test.gz

in spite of the message.
I don't know details and I could not resolve this problem.

Subject: [tex-live] segfault on build-testing luatex
Message-ID: <20170807130945.uhxv34gkvoswma5q@bulldog.preining.info>

Dear luatex masters!

I am trying to hunt down a build failure on Debian. We are building
of the sources from svn 44572, which is practically the released
version of TL2017.

When building normally nothing happens, all works out well. But when
building using the Debian rules files I see an error on testing
in luaimage.test, namely at the first line:
	./luatex -ini luaimage || exit 1
The log file does not contain anything but:
	...
	This is LuaTeX, Version 1.0.4 (TeX Live 2017/Debian)  (INITEX)
	 restricted system commands enabled.
	../../../texk/web2c/luatexdir/tests/luaimage.tex
	(../../../texk/web2c/tests/basic.tex Preloading the plain format: codes,
	registers, parameters, macros, math definitions, output routines, hyphenation))

	Beginning to dump on file luaimage.fmt
	 (format=luaimage 2017.8.7)
	2374 strings using 6763 bytes
	10085 memory locations dumped; current usage is 132&5003
	1335 multiletter control sequences
	\font\nullfont=nullfont
	0 preloaded fonts
	No pages of output.
	Transcript written on luaimage.log.
	Segmentation fault

Now the funny part is the "Segmentation fault" at the end ...which
is really a pain, because everything worked out properly.

I have put into the luaimage.test file a line `set' to see the
complete environment, and copied it. After some adaptions (see below)
and running it I get no errors and successful builds

The only things I changed are converting local path (../../../texk/web2c/luatexdir/)
to absoilute path (/home/norbert/.......). Nothing else.
And with this minuscule change I get a proper compilation.

So I am really completely surprised about what could go wrong, and
why luatex does not report any errors. Note that I also added
--debug-format to the failing luatex invocation, but there was no
change in output.

Does anyone have any idea how to debug this?

Why does luatex properly dump a format and then die?

Thanks for any suggestions!

(and please keep Cc)

Norbert

OK I see it with gcc 7.1 and -O3 , but not with -O0

It happens when luatex exits and closes the state L;
the garbage collector calls the pending finalizers and luaffi fails.
I am working on the luaffi code,  it could be that will aply the patch.

Today I received snail mail from Knuth. He is absolutely not amused
about the 'official' epsf.tex (2.7.4) with '\leavevmode' inside
'\epsfbox'. This version not only breaks 'skew-ternary-calc.w' and a few
other example CWEB programs, but "would require thousands of changes to
TAOCP."

Would those in charge of epsf.tex on CTAN and TeXlive please consider
fixing this in a compatible way. Maybe it would be feasible to separate
epsf.tex for plain TeX with the original functionality from epsf.sty for
LaTeX with the extra '\leavevmode'.

Best, Andreas

Hi Andreas,

There is no one "in charge of" epsf.tex except Nelson. Neither CTAN nor
I want to reach in and change a file that someone else maintains. I'll
write more to you and him separately. -k

Hi there,

Apologies if this has come up before (I'm sure it has), but I'm trying to
get a stable, reproducible installation of texlive across multiple systems,
including different people's computers and a continuous integration
service. I've written a script [1] which installs texlive from
ftp://tug.org/historic/ which has been working fine, however recently the
server seems to have become flaky and I'm getting random download failures
which prevent installation (TLPDB::_install_package: downloading did not
succeed). I can't switch to a mirror because historic/ is not mirrored. I
found https://ctanmirror.speedata.de/ and will give that a try, however I
just thought I would post here as it would seem to be a good idea if
historic/ was mirrored along with all the other texlive content. Also I'd
be grateful if anyone has any other suggestions.

Thanks,
Alistair

Alistair Miles asks on Thu, 17 Aug 2017 11:45:10 +0100 about mirrors
for the historic TeX Live material.  From the file

	ftp://tug.org/historic/README

I find 

	The master is
	ftp://tug.org/historic, and it is mirrored at
	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic and
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic.

I maintain the Utah mirrors, and they appear to be working normally.

We had a semester-break operating system upgrade two nights ago that
took services away for about an hour, but otherwise, our servers
generally run for many months between reboots.

    recently the server seems to have become flaky 

Nothing has changed wrt tug.org. I surmise any "flakiness" is because
there is (and has always been) a noticeable limit on ftp
connections. I've done that because in my experience web browsers tend
to use up all available ftp connections anyway, and it was untenable.

    be grateful if anyone has any other suggestions.

Use rsync://tug.org/historic/... instead of ftp.
Or rsync://rsync.math.utah.edu/historic/... for Nelson's mirror.

But also, I don't understand you're doing. You're installing TL16 But
TL16 is never going to change again. So where does "continuous
integration" come in? And "continuous integration" and "stable" are
polar opposites anyway.  I don't get it. And why not use TL17? Oh well,
whatever.

    historic/ was mirrored along with all the other texlive content. 

It's not feasible to dump XX more gigabytes of old unchanging stuff onto
ctan.org and every ctan mirror. CTAN does not hold old versions of
anything, in general.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

Thanks Nelson, I only checked a couple of mirrors and they seemed to be
missing historic/, good to know it is mirrored at Utah.

I'm writing a paper with latex source in a github repo. Whenever anyone (me
or collaborator) makes a PR to incorporate some changes, the CI service (I
use travis) automatically builds the PDF. So the CI service is a way to
check if someone has made changes that break the build, and to avoid any
breaking changes getting into the master branch.

I'm using TL16-final to guarantee that texlive won't change under our feet.
I.e., if I run my texlive install script today, it will have the same
results as running it in a week or a month. This is very helpful to get all
collaborators using exactly the same texlive software versions, and also
getting exactly the same installation on the CI server.

This is similar to pinning dependencies when working on a software or
analysis project. E.g., we use conda to install Python for our data
analysis work, and we pin versions of all installed Python packages so all
team members are using exactly the same software, and everything is
consistently reproducible.

Fair enough if space is a premium. Just wanted to register that for us,
being able to get an exactly reproducible texlive install is very useful.

Alistair

Hi Alistair,

> I'm using TL16-final to guarantee that texlive won't change under our feet.

Then please once download the tlnet of 2016 final to a local device, and
continue to install from there all the other computers.

As Karl said, we cannot put loads of Gb just for historic purposes.
If someone wants the tlnet of 2016, either get it from historic, or
preferrably as described above, get it *once* and then distribute it
yourself.

Another option, if you want a stable, is using the iso image of TL2017,
which *is* distributed via CTAN and which does not change either.

It doesn't matter. But if you will only have a couple of .lua files, I'd
suggest putting them into tex/ just to keep everything together. After
all, babel is not primarily a lua package. Up to you, though. --best, karl.

Ok. It will go to tex then.

Imho lua files meant to be used by a package (like e.g.
luaotfload-main.lua) should go in tex/..., while lua-files used by
some wrapper.exe (like e.g. luaotfload-tool.lua) should go in
scripts/....  (this also means that in my opinion luacolor.lua is
misplaced).

One colleague complained that on Debian Stable TL2017 installation failed
several times with the following messages like these:

TLUtils::check_file: removing
/tmp/srbe_kS07h/ZjJXWh_YrE/collection-humanities.tar.xz, sizes differ:
TLUtils::check_file: TL=584, arg=580

Installation failed.


He had no problems with TL2015 and TL2016. Any suggestions how can he
overcome the problem (and any guess what is the reason of the failure)?

Server is out of date I guess. Please wait a few hours, or try a different

It would seem that ~/texmf doesn't search recursively any more.

Own stuff in ~/texmf/tex/latex (and generic), as has been for many happy
years.

Some packages as files/softlinks in the directory and this works.
However where the package is within a subdirectory/link the search
fails.

FWIW it works with pdflatex but not lualatex.

Ideas/solution?

It does, as long as you put the files into the correct places.

Do you have an ls-R file by chance that is not updated?

Without more details nobody can guess what is the problem.

Sounds like a setup proble.

Yes, send details!

* location of files
* how they are loaded/included
* which program you are using
* ...

Sorry, both of them are still in development and not ready for actual consumption, but usable to a certain degree. Development is in the TL repo to immediately test on different archs.

Both are frontends to tlmgr and will hopefully provide better gui than tlmgr gui win the future.

Tlshell is a Tcl/Tk frontend written by Siep, tlcockpit is Scala/Java frontend written by me. You need Java and JavaFX installed (but not Scala).

For both you need the tlcritical version of tlmgr for now.

Hope that helps

Norbert

I've tried both tlshell and tlcockpit. tlshell starts up, but at the
moment without any action, but that's ok, it's in development state.

On the other hand I can't start tlcockpit (strace shows FUTEX_WAIT).
Which version of Java/JavaFX is needed? I use the openjdk versions from
Fedora 26. Which .jar-files have to be in the classpath?

Not a question of JavaFX but of a tlmgr that is not updated.

A tlmgr from tlcritical is necessary for now.

If you have tlmgr from tlcritical, then I am surprised. I run 
Java 8 with OpenJFX on Debian sid:
ii  openjdk-8-jre: 8u144-b01-1  amd64        OpenJDK Java runtime, using Hotsp
ii  openjfx        8u131-b11-2  amd64        JavaFX/OpenJFX 8 - Rich client ap

On Windows I tried it with the latest JavaSE downloaded from Oracle.
In both cases it started when tlmgr was from tlcritical.

If not, then it will wait for ever for the correct prompt ... that might
be your problem.

For newer versions see
	https://github.com/TeX-Live/tlcockpit
there in jar/tlcockpit.jar is always the newest version.
I am not updating TeX Live evcery day with this jar, but only when
some bigger changes are.

Thanks for testing.

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] A bug in TeX Live's TeX engines (all of them): Literal
 trailing tabs are typeset
Message-ID: <CA+-Lr-BjwxW=weJJQ2H32hFc3x2rNSRb-9d4ri_tdakuroDoWA@mail.gmail.com>

Consider the following Plain TeX manuscript

---
\catcode9=12\relax% ASCII 9 is tab
.\ \ .\par%
.
.%
\bye
---

It's impossible to tell, but there's a tab just after the dot on the
third manuscript line.

This manuscript typesets thus:

---
.  .
. .
---

Observe that there seem to be two spaces between the dots on the first
line, but only one space between the dots on the second line.

The reason seems to be that the TeX Live engines discard trailing
tabs. However, this goes contrary to both the TeXbook and the source
code, which make it clear that only trailing spaces should be
discarded.

This is what the TeXbook has to say about in the matter (p. 46):

---
TeX deletes any <space> characters (number 32) that occur at the right
end of an input line.
---

And this is what the TeX source code (texdoc tex) has to say about it
(section 31, p. 16):

---
Trailing blanks are removed from the line; thus, either last=first (in
which case the line was entirely blank) or buffer[last ? 1]?"?".
---

Respectfully yours,
Evan Aad

It was my fault. As tlshell was working out of the box, I thought my TeX
Live installation was good enough to start tlcockpit.

Now with tlmgr from tlcritical tlcockpit looks fine, I'm curious about
the next development steps.
