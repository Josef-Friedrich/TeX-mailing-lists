 using install-tl-windows.bat
Message-ID: <CANROs4f7jSd78nwZuceR-_PKKRkNDfJnYhsoP9_er1rwOET1eA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When I try to install TeX Live on Windows using the batch file
install-tl-windows.bat (from install-tl.zip), an error dialog like
this will pop up twice:
https://db.yihui.name/images/install-tl-win-lua.png It says

> This program (fmutil-sys.exe and updmap-sys.exe) can't start because luatex.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

I'm using the automated installation:

  install-tl-windows.bat -profile=texlive.profile

and here is the content of texlive.profile:

selected_scheme scheme-infraonly
TEXDIR ./texlive/
TEXMFSYSCONFIG ./texlive/texmf-config
TEXMFLOCAL ./texlive/texmf-local
TEXMFSYSVAR ./texlive/texmf-var
portable 1

The problem only occurs when I use the infraonly scheme on Windows.
Other schemes or operating systems don't have this problem.

I wonder if it is a bug of the Windows installer. Thanks!

Regards,
Yihui

Message-ID: <CANROs4cXNyUNV2EUDYb3bJHEt2fZdo4RJ4wcKuas+QVysM0s7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

If I install TeX Live without docs (e.g., set option_doc 0 in a profile
file for automated installation), `tlmgr path add` is fine, but I'll run
into an error like this when I run `tlmgr path remove`:

  sh: line 0: cd: $TEXDIR/texmf-dist/doc/man: No such file or directory

I wonder if we could get rid of this error message by checking if the dir
exists before cd.

Subject: [tex-live] texhash not updating ls-R-TEXLIVEDIST
Message-ID: <dcc63a2ae88cbaadd95e64047cdf3a61@garymlewis.com>

Hi -

This problem started with a "ebgaramond.sty not found" error when 
running a tex file in TexMaker.

Summary:
ebgaramond.sty does not appear in ls-R-TEXLIVEDIST. Running sudo texhash 
does not add the sty file.

Brief synopsis (reboots not identified):
1. Reinstalled OS (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
2. Reinstalled complete texlive (as sudo).
3. Reinstalled TexMaker (as sudo).
4. Added /usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux to $PATH in .bashrc.
5. Ran sudo texhash.
6. Ran myfile.tex in TexMaker. Same error: ebgaramond.sty not found.
7. grep -i "ebgaramond.sty" ls-R-TEXLIVEDIST returns nothing.
8. But, running pdflatex myfile.tex from the command line works fine 
(sty file is found).

Is this a known bug? If not, what other information can I provide now?

Thanks.

Gary Lewis

I would guess that your editor is using the system tex that came with
ubuntu not finding the one you just installed. either because it is
using some explicit path like /usr/bin/pdflatex or because it is using
a different PATH

This is very rarely useful and doesn't give you an opportunity to find a
solution to
the original issue.

A better approach is to pick a texlive administrator (e.g., the regular
user of a
single-user systems), use "sudo" to create /usr/local/texlive and transfer
ownership to the texlive administrator.   Now that it is installed, a
"chown -R ..."
can fix things.

Did you use a package from the temaker site or somethings else?

Have you tried running texmaker from the command line where pdflatex
works?  A GUI program started from a menu may not get the same PATH as
a shell program.

I agree with David.  You might get better advice from the TexMaker
site.

Hi all,

similar thing happened to me when I installed TeX Live as root, then added
texmf-local and placed some files there and created ls-R files as a normal
user, then updated TeX Live as root and then installed a few new files into
texmf-local as a normal user. During update even the ls-R files in
texmf-local were regenerated and now owned by root, therefore when
installing later files into texmf-local the ls-R could not be updated by a
normal user. So the problem is certainly in the ownership of the ls-R files.

And as George wrote, if you run a command in terminal, the setting of the
whole environment (including PATH) is taken from ~/.bashrc but if you write
it from a menu of a program started by GUI, the environment is taken from
~/.bash_profile, so you must ensure that both load the same settings. If
you change ~/.bashrc, it is sufficient to open a new terminal, if you
change ~/.bash_profile, you must log off and on. These are not bugs but
documented behaviour, see your Linux manual.

Hi Gary,
TeX Live neither provides, maintains, nor evaluates a file called
"ls-R-TEXLIVEDIST".

TeX Live provides and maintains ".../texlive/2017/texmf-dist/ls-R".
This one of the ls-R files updated by texhash.

I don't know where "ls-R-TEXLIVEDIST" comes from.  It's definitely not
maintained by TeX Live (texhash/mktexlsr).  Thus you can safely remove
this file.

I recommend that you check the configuration of TeXMaker.  There is
absolutely no reason to configure anything as far as the directory
containing the binaries is in $PATH
(/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux in your case).

If TeXMaker needs to locate any files by itself, it should simply use
kpathsea/kpsewhich:

  $ kpsewhich ebgaramond.sty
  /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ebgaramond/ebgaramond.sty

George White recommeded to change ownership of the /usr/local/texlive
directory tree.  This is definitely a good idea and I'm glad that
he mentioned it.  Let me elaborate on it.

It's a common misconception to believe that everything is secure only
because it's installed with root permissions.  The exact opposite is
the case.

Use sudo only in order to maintain your operating system, never
install software by yourself as a privileged user.

Instead, run

  sudo chown -R gary:users /usr/local

and /usr/local is yours.

Whenever you invoke a command with sudo, a small typo can break the
whole system.  Use sudo with care and avoid it whenever possible.
Always maintain your own stuff as a non-privileged user.

Regards,
  Reinhard

IMHO the whole concept of sudo is wrong and I never use it. It allows
unprivileged user to do privileged things. If you have your own personal
computer and do not share it with anybody, then it makes no sense not to
know the root password. You can then do "su -" and enter the root password
and you know that your actions are potentially dangerous. If the computer
is shared by several people then it is stupid to give them the right to use
sudo. A privileged administrator should take care of the system setup,
security etc, other user should not have right to access system settings.
Thus sudo with unlimited rights is wrong.

What about a traceroute to see where it hangs?
Do you have a VPN on?

Hmm, strange. Should be back to normal according to:
http://status.ovh.net/?do=details&id=15229
But there are more problems it seems
https://twitter.com/ovh_status?lang=en
so maybe simple wait a bit, should turn out eventually.

I'm not using sudo either, but I assume that the idea is to prevent
unexperienced users from being logged in as root permanently.  This is
a good idea, IMO.

I also use su(1) in order to maintain my system but I configured PS1
in /etc/bashrc so that I'm warned

and similarly for Emacs

(if (> emacs-major-version 23)
    (if (= (user-uid) 0)
	(set-face-attribute
	 'mode-line nil :foreground "Yellow" :background "OrangeRed")
      (set-face-attribute
       'mode-line nil :foreground "Cyan" :background "Sienna"))
  ;; older Emacs:
  (if (= (user-uid) 0)
      (progn 
        (set-face-background 'modeline "OrangeRed")
        (set-face-foreground 'modeline "Yellow"))
    (progn
      (set-face-foreground 'modeline "Cyan")
      (set-face-background 'modeline "Sienna"))))

I've always a lot of X-terminals and Emacs instances running on
various virtual screens and it's very helpful if I can see immediately
who I am.

On multi-user systems sudo can be configured to allow a particular
user to run a particular program/script with root privileges.  This is
quite useful if an admin doesn't want to give the root password to a
user who only needs to run one or a few privileged programs.  

I'm convinced that sudo(1) is quite useful if configured properly, see
also sudo.conf(5), sudoers(5).  I must admit that I have absolutely no
experience with sudo.  The very first thing I do whenever I boot a new
Linux installation is

  sudo passwd

in order to proceed with su(1).  But I'm convinced that unexperienced
users shouldn't do that.  It's simply too dangerous to be logged in as
root permanently.  With my Bash and Emacs setup it's less risky.

Hi,

everything has been said, but once again:
* you have two TeX Live installations, one in /usr/local/texlive and one
  in /usr/bin, the former one installed by yourself, the later one 
  is the one shipped by Debian/Ubuntu.

* ls-R-TEXLIVEDIST is the one from Debian/Ubuntu, not the one in
  /usr/local/texlive/...

* Your problem with TeX Maker is that you start it from the GUI
  (Desktop) and the PATH for the Desktop is not adapted to include
  /usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux, thus it does not use
  the correct files.

Possible solutions (one of them):
* set up the PATH in /etc/profile.d/.... to include the correct one
  echo "PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2017/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH" >> /etc/profile.d/texlive-path.sh
  echo "export PATH" >> /etc/profile.d/texlive-path.sh

* use the *same* directory for TEXMFLOCAL for both the Debian/Ubuntu TeX
  Live and the upstream by doing:
    echo "TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf" >> /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf.cnf
  NOTE that the directory 
    /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
  will NOT be searched anymore.

Hope that helps.

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] "tlmgr list" became unusable
Message-ID: <64a70ed3343662e3dc68c6c41184edf1.squirrel@box5445.bluehost.com>

For years, "tlmgr list" would output a list of all packages and
collections, on one line each.  Those that were installed had their line
begin with an "i".

Today I needed "tlmgr list", and when I did it, I found that it now spits
out so much verbose information that it's unusuable.  For each item, it
displays the same thing that "tlmgr info [item]" would display.  I.e., the
whole record for it, "longdesc" and all.

I think this is breakage, and should be fixed.  The old output is useful
for quickly scanning for things.  Also, you can easily use it to get a
list of all your installed/uninstalled packages and collections.  (Just
grep for those that start with "i", and then sed out the colon and
everything after it.)

I can't imagine what the point of the new output is.  If one wanted to see
*all* of that, one would just examine the file "texlive.tlpd", or run
"tlmgr info" with no arguments.

Moreover, the new out put is severely slow, because the amount of
information to be processed and displayed is now so large.

I see that according to "man tlmgr", even the latter is supposed to do the
one-line-each output.

Bisection of my local git repo reveals that this change was introduced
with whatever the last update that required "tlmgr update --self" was.  It
appears that this is the one that changed the version of tlmgr to 45838.

Try

tlmgr info --data "name,localrev,shortdesc"

instead. Installed packages have a non-zero value for localrev. The
output is in csv format.

This somewhat works, but is not the same as the documentation
advertises:

info [option...] [collections|schemes|pkg?]

With no argument, lists all packages available at the package repository, prefixing those already installed with i.
[?]
The former actions show and list are merged into this action, but are still supported for backward compatibility.

Sorry, a feature loss during rewrite. Fixed in the repository. If you
want to fix it yourself till the next texlive.infra update, patch
  texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
with the following patch:

Thanks, but the patch does not apply to tlmgr.pl.  E.g., the original file
contains no "is done below" string.  Perhaps this patch is against master
rather than what is available to users.

If this works on Windows...
Is it correct, that if a linux distribution provides another/newest 
version of urw-core35 type1 fonts and ghostscript, there is no Problem 
with metrics or "same sets of glyphs" when texlive/psnfss uses the same 
fonts by changing the corresponding map-files?
I assume generating font description(fd) files and virtual fonts(vf) 
would also be necessary, or would there be much more to be done from a 
linux distribution point of view?

Hi Johannes,
I fear that there is no satisfying solution.  We currently have three
different fonts with the same internal variable /FontName.  Each
supports a different set of glyphs.

 1. TeX Live provides and supports the fonts gratefully donated by
    URW.  None of the fonts were modified except NimbusSanL-ReguItal
    (uhvro8a.pfb) due to a severe bug in /germandbls, see
 
      http://tug.org/~kotucha/germandbls.pdf

    The original font is still available (uhvro8a-105.pfb).

 2. Ghostscript has subsets of these URW fonts built into the binary.
    These fonts are used if there is no file called "Fontmap" in
    Ghostscript's search path (GS_LIB).  Many glyphs were removed from
    the URW fonts but an additional glyph was added to the symbol
    font.

    According to Chris Liddell, a Ghostscript developer, the sole
    reason to provide any fonts at all is to have a replacement for
    the Adobe fonts built into PostScript printers.  Thus glyphs not
    supported by Adobe were removed from the URW fonts.

 3. Ghostscript offers an external font package.  It comes with its
    own Fontmap file and thus overrides the built-in fonts.  These
    fonts come with additional (Cyrillic) glyphs.   

The problem is that all three fonts are incompatible but have the same
/FontName.  According to Adobe's Type 1 specification there should
never exist two fonts with the same /FontName.

Many programs do not embed fonts into generated PostScript files but
only mention their name, for instance

  /Palatino-Roman findfont

If such a file contains Cyrillic characters, the corresponding glyphs
will only be shown in programs based on Ghostscript (gv, ghostview)
and only if the extended fonts are installed.  If you are using the
built-in fonts, even Ghostcript will not display them.

If such a file is used in the TeX world, only the psnfss fonts are
available and the Cyrillic glyphs are lost.  It's nasty because users
usually don't get an appropriate error message and often don't notice
that some glyphs don't appear in the final PDF file.  And even if they
notice that some glyphs are missing, debugging is extremely painful.

Nothing can be done in TeX Live in order to solve this problem.  Every
font can be supported if the necessary files are available but there
is absolutely no way to support different fonts with the same name.

The only reasonable thing you can do as a Linux distributor is to
offer an additional font package as an alternative to Ghostscript's
"urw-base35" fonts.  The fonts are here:

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlgs/fonts/

Users cannot install both font packages at the same time because fonts
with the same name are indistinguishable.  If you want to provide both
packages though, one of the actual Fontmaps has to be commented out.

This means that lib/Fontmap should either contain the lines

  % (Fontmap.GS) .runlibfile
  (Fontmap.TeXLive) .runlibfile

or

  (Fontmap.GS) .runlibfile
  % (Fontmap.TeXLive) .runlibfile

IMO it was a big mistake to modify the original fonts donated by URW
but not to change /FontName.  Thus I'm convinced that an alternative
font package based on the original URW fonts as shipped with TeX Live
is by far the best solution.  I even recommend to install these fonts
by default because this is the only way to make PostScript files
halfways portable.

Let me know if you are interested in a font package providing the
original URW fonts for use with Ghostscript.  During the next three
weeks I'm on leave and thus have more time as usual.

Regards,
  Reinhard

With fontforge, i did a short compare of base35 font Times-Roman from 
ctan with the newest fonts-core35 release from 
https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/urw-base35-fonts, which seem to be 
the fonts builtin in the newest ghostscript 9.22, by
sfddiff base35/pfb/utmr8a.pfb fonts/NimbusRoman-Regular.t1
There are a lot of differences and new glyphs in the newer font, but it 
seems the only glyph missing in the newer font is "commaaccent".

I'm confused, you mean e.g this
https://packages.debian.org/stretch/gsfonts ?

If it's true that the github-artifex base35 fonts only misses one glyph 
per font,
Would it be possible to make the texlive psnfss package work with this 
fonts?
Just to know if i got it right: If it can be done in texlive, would this 
base35 problem be solved, if all distributions would "reset", and start 
over to only use the newest base35 realease?

Thank you very much for the offer, but i think i can do this on my own 
in case.

    seems the only glyph missing in the newer font is "commaaccent".

My recollection from looking at a previous update from URW is that there
were changes in the metrics and kerning tables too.

    Just to know if i got it right: If it can be done in texlive, would this 
    base35 problem be solved, if all distributions would "reset", and start 
    over to only use the newest base35 realease?

No. If we overtly changed the base35 fonts in TL, old documents will
typeset differently. That's not acceptable.

What can be done is to make a new font package with the new fonts, and
then people who want them can have them. Michael Sharpe did this for a
previous update from URW with just the "core 3",
Times/Helvetica/Courier, fonts: https://ctan.org/pkg/nimbus15
Michael's article about the work might be of interest:
  http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb37-2/tb116sharpe.pdf
(and his articles about his many other font projects might be of related
interest: http://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/listauthor.html#Sharpe,Michael )

With enough work by the interested and willing parties, options could be
given to existing psnfss and other packages to switch to the new fonts,
once they are available. But we can't (or rather, I won't) just change
the fonts out from under the TeX world. --best, karl.

Sorry for the confusion.  It's confusing indeed.  I actually meant the
font package offered by Artifex and formerly by Aladdin.  But when I
tried to download the package again, I found a statement on their
website

  "The latest font set is included with the Ghostscript package."

I also see now that the built-in fonts have Cyrillic glyphs too.  It
seems that current versions provide the same set of fonts regardless
of whether they are compiled into the binary or not.  Sounds good at a
first glance but unfortunately the .afm files are missing.  They are
not used by Ghostscript itself but are needed by programs which create
PostScript files.  Kerning information is only available in .afm files
and not in the actual fonts (.pfa or .pfb).  TeX's .tfm files are also
derived from .afm files.

Admittedly I wasn't aware of the Debian package.  It seems that it's
derived from the font-package formerly provided by Artifex/Aladdin.
It contains the .afm files at least but I didn't investigate any
further.

The fonts shipped with Ghostscript now are lacking /commaaccent.  I'm
quite sure that it's not intended and should be reported.

Adapting psnfss means to break *all* existing documents using
/commaaccent.  At the moment documents are only broken when the
modified fonts are used.

No, they have to use the original, unmodified URW fonts.  It's not
only sufficient that all glyphs supported by psnfss exist in a font,
the opposite is also problematic: If you create a PostScript file with
an external tool and use glyphs which are not supported by nfss, these
files look ok with a Ghostscript viewer but cannot be included in TeX
documents.

The psnfss package is maintained by Walter Schmidt.  He deliberately
based it on the original URW fonts because the Type 1 specification
doesn't allow modifications without changing /FontName.  And as you
can see now, anything except the original fonts is a moving target.
The psnfss package is immutable for a good reason.

Please note that in the TeX world we need absolute reliability and
stability.  I was able to compile my diploma thesis after a quarter
century with LaTeX2e though there was only LaTeX-2.09 at that time and
there was no need to touch any file.  This is what TeX users expect.  
We cannot adapt TeX packages to moving targets.  That would break
zillions of existing documents.

Thus I recommend that Linux distributors provide a separate font
package containing the original URW fonts.  I'm not aware of any other
reasonable solution.

  Reinhard

Hi,

though I still receive mails from tug.org, I cannot access to
www.tug.org since a few weeks.

AFAICS, not everybody is affected by this problem:
  ?????
  ? http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/tug.org
  ?????

I noticed tug.org is hosted by OVH (at Roubaix, less than 100 km than my
place!) so I asked OVH's team about this issue and I was told that,
since the tug.org IP (91.121.174.77) is not managed by OVH, they cannot
tell at the moment what's cause of the problem.

My Internet service provider is Bouygues Telecom, France and my current
(I guess not fixed) IP is:
  ?????
  ? 128.79.251.206 
  ?????

- If you blacklisted it or a range it belongs to, could you relax this
  policy? 
- If not, OVH's team suggested you open a ticket.

Thanks in anticipation.

Hi,

you can try:

traceroute www.tug.org

(or tracerte in Windows) which will tell you where the problem is. Some
sites on the way may be configured not to reply so the problem may be a few
steps further than you will see.

I sent it to OVH's guys. They said that, indeed, the culprit (last) IP
is an OVH one but told me to contact the tug.org administrator since the
tug.org IP (91.121.174.77) is not managed by them.

So rbx1-c1-a72.fr.eu (91.121.131.219) is the last machine which responds,
the promlem is thus somewhere between his machine and www.tug.org. I do not
know whom to contact.

Can you connect to www.preining.info which is hosted by the same company
(kimsufi)?

You need to conact kimsufi https://www.kimsufi.com/en/ in case of
connection problems.

The servers are at OVH, but they are leased (AFAIU) by kimsufi and
resold from kimsufi. OVH does not take any responsability.

No, we don't blacklist anything AFAIR.
Karl should confirm that.

Now, that said, trying disconnecting your internet connection - power
down and reset your modem/router, even disconnect it from the wall
for an hour or so. Try forcing a change in your router's IP address.
You can find info by doing a search for:

how reset router IP address


The above said, if I had to bet, my money would go on that the problem
you are seeing is the result of a MTU/fragmentation/ECN router bug
issue within an ISP network. See:

https://superuser.com/questions/386708/cant-access-some-websites-possible-mtu-issue-on-the-router
http://blog.glinskiy.com/2009/02/packetization-layer-path-mtu-discovery.html
https://fitzcarraldoblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/why-cant-i-access-a-specific-web-site/

In short, something is "special" about the packets your system is
generating, not necessarily "wrong", just "rather unique" and this
is triggering a bug in a router downstream. Of course, the network
provider doesn't believe it is their problem because, "Hey, our
stuff works for everyone else, so we *must* be OK."

Under Linux/Unix, you can do a 

ip link list

to see the Maximum Transmit Unit (MTU, aka send packet size) each
of your network interfaces is using. The MTU on the outgoing interface
should not be over 1500. You should try setting it lower, to say, 1450:

ifconfig wlan0 mtu 1450

You can also try enabling Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
(PLPMD) and see if that has any effect:
 
echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mtu_probing

Another source of such problems is buggy routers that do not
support Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) which is controlled
under the Linux kernel via

/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn

e.g., 
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn

see for example:

http://bloat.bufferbloat.narkive.com/BtoUTYXS/ecn-blocking-router-found


Anyway, I think the line of reasoning above is on the right track,
even if not perfectly spot on with regard to the name of the
specific network parameter that is triggering the bug in your
case.

If you find the cause, please do let us (as well as the ISP) know
who is the offender. 


   Cheers,

Not disconnected but powered down every night, is it enough?

Sigh... I read on my ISP forums that either my IP is fix and it cannot
be changed, or it is dynamic and I shouldn't have this problem since
such a long time.

Well, I'm not sure: what are the commands to run before?

Sigh... beyond my skills.

I blindly run the commands above but no success for my problem.

If my router and/or my ISP were wrong, I probably encountered this
problem with other sites, isn't it?

Of course.

Many thanks for such a detailed message!

Denis,

Sorry for your connectivity issues... but this is the best holiday season
mystery so far.  :)

Do all computers, smartphones, etc., from your location show the same
symptoms?

Regards,
Richard

since it will most assuredly take a different path, etc., to www.tug.org.

Yes, either with a laptop or a smartphone connected to my router by

Bingo! That works :)

I guess we can conclude neither my router nor my configuration are the
culprits...

Yes, your computer gets and IP address form DNS, your home router can most
probably connect to your ISP only and the next routers try to find the way,
so the problem lies most probably even outside your ISP. Tor is an
anymizing service, so your computer then connects to another server which
finds the way to tug.org from somewhere else.

Denis, the actual problem is not solved so far, sorry.

When you start the Tor browswer, it says, for instance

  Your IP address appears to be: 62.212.73.141

But this IP address is not yours and you get another one when you
start the browser again.

What happens is that your browser connects to this remote machine and
the remote machine sends your requests to www.tug.org and sends you
the results.  This works, of course, because

  http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com

already told you that everbody except you can access www.tug.org .

Using the Tor browser is probably a nice workaround for http(s) and
ftp but it doesn't help if you need rsync, for example.

 > I guess we can conclude neither my router nor my configuration are
 > the culprits...

I can't imagine that there is something wrong at your site because you
said that everything else works fine.

BTW, tug.org and preining.info have completely different IP-numbers:

  tug.org:         91.121.174.77
  preining.info:   142.4.209.99

Maybe one of the routers between Calais and Roubaix is
screwed up.  Can anybody tell me what * * * means in the output of
traceroute? 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Given that is the case, has you tried using OpenDNS?

Exactly. Tor is primarily used to  hide your identity from the target
server so that you cannot be tracked and the cookies, if there are used,
cannot identify your computer.

starts with one hop, tries 3 times and then increases the number of hops by
one and tries again until it either reaches the target or 30 hops. If set
initially to 1 hop, the packet expires at the very first router and its IP
address is returned. With 2 hops the IP packet gets on step further so this
way you can trace the whole way. * * * means that no reply packet was
received which may have one of two reasons:

1. The router is configured not to reply for ping packet
2. The router is unreachable

It is quite common to have * * * in the middle of a route but in any cas
you find the IP address of the furthest router that responded.

DNS is not the problem. The problem is that a router finds a way to the IP

Denis - please try now, with my apologies. It's all my fault.

Sorry that the mystery is actually so uninteresting, but the answer is
that I do have to blacklist a few addresses/ranges -- spiders that don't
respect robots.txt and try to crawl our entire svn tree (with all
history), which is just too much. I don't have any foolproof way of
detecting them, and I wrongly added 128.79.251.206 to the list at one
point. --sorry, karl.

Hi all,

it seems to me that the problem is at the router at position 7 in the
traceroute output sent by Denis. Yo can see that if responds only once, the
next two attmpts fail, and when TTL is set to 11 hops, two different paths
are attempted. I tried to access this router just now and it is
inaccessible. Or probably the problem is even on router 6 that should have
never tried the next one and use another path. It is definitely not a
problem of DNS because my computer finds the same IP address. So DNS
spoofing is not the problem. This is my trace:

$ traceroute www.tug.org
traceroute to www.tug.org (91.121.174.77), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  gate.czw57 (192.168.1.1)  9.945 ms  9.936 ms  9.931 ms
 2  62-141-11-99.tmcz.cz (62.141.11.99)  10.023 ms  10.235 ms  16.212 ms
 3  62-141-13-18.tmcz.cz (62.141.13.18)  16.271 ms  19.412 ms  23.496 ms
 4  62.168.52.65 (62.168.52.65)  22.326 ms  24.754 ms  28.199 ms
 5  ae-2.fra2027-ex1.gtsce.net (193.85.195.94)  35.877 ms  39.003 ms
41.273 ms
 6  * * *
 7  be103.rbx-g1-nc5.fr.eu (178.33.100.158)  60.547 ms  58.720 ms  62.512 ms
 8  * * *
 9  vl10.rbx-g3-a72.fr.eu (94.23.122.73)  55.899 ms  54.242 ms  56.437 ms
10  * * *
11  tug.org (91.121.174.77)  37.863 ms !X  37.069 ms !X  39.435 ms !X

Now, comparing again my route with that found by Denis, I see that
vl10.rbx-g3-a72.fr.eu is on the right path but Denis is sometimes sent by
router #7 to a wrong direction. Both http, https, and ftp are TCP services
and establishing a connection requires sending several packets. If they do
not go correctly to the server, connection will never be established.

It was interesting to read this discussion, and it is great to see so
many helpful people here.  Being a complete noob, however, I wonder
whether there is a possibility to find out such blocking more easily ?
if I understand the issue correctly, all of the suggested solutions
were flawed more or less, pointing to the wrong places.

[We are way off-topic here, but adding one more msg to the pile ...]

Hi Werner,

    all of the suggested solutions were flawed more or less, 

No: blacklisting was suggested early. But no one besides me had the
crucial information that tug.org was indeed blacklisting a few
addresses, and all the other intervening messages happened before I even
saw the discussion. Unfortunately I did not think of this the first time
Denis raised his issue, a week or two ago.

The traceroutes were consistent with blacklisting -- from Denis's host
it got to the last router before tug and then * * *'d, whereas from
other hosts it got past that to tug. That was the most definitive
information.  There's no way to prove blacklisting without access to the
host, as Zdenek said.

FWIW, I have seen all of the other suggested culprits cause
trouble in other situations, from packet fragmentation onward.

I have the idea that fail2ban could be used nowadays to detect
problematic spiders; that would be much preferable to my hardcoded
iptables-level blacklist, since it would expire after a while and give
the IP another chance to behave itself. But the last time I looked at
the various fail2ban filters in this area, none seemed like what I
really wanted -- they wanted heavyweight databases (no thanks), or
depended on third-party blacklists (no thanks), or had other issues, and
I couldn't quite get to hacking one myself. If anyone has any
recommendations in this regard, I'd like to hear them (but probably best
to write me off-list, as this has nothing to do with TeX Live).

Thanks,
Karl

Message-ID: <3898b1d9-8dd2-2609-094c-fa6f17e7b164@earthlink.net>

Recently David Carlisle has released his xii-lat.tex file (see TUGboat 
38,3) as a follow on from xii.tex. Both of these files are part of 
TeXlive but when I tried to process them (by pdftex) they were not 
found. Eventually with help from TEX.SE 
(https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/407065)  I discovered that they 
were under \usr\local\texlive\2017\texmf-dist\doc\plain. I feel that the 
TDS should be organized in this case so that pdftex xii will produce 
xii.pdf (and similarly for xii-lat or other (La)TeX files of the same 
nature).

Perhaps a new category called, say, fun, could be developed for these 
kind of files?

Not very good idea. It would add sooooo many files to the search space, with
a high probability of file name clashes etc. No, doc files will not be
automatically searched by kpathsea. They (the doc files) *are* different
beasts and not supposed to be input files *unless* you want to typeset
the documentation.

Hi Peter - I understand the desire. I put xii and xii-lat into doc
precisely because I felt like anyone who wanted to typeset those files
could find them as part of the fun. It's not like they are needed to do
any typesetting. In general, all example/demo/fun files are in doc.
It's obviously no big deal for two files, but ... such was my reasoning.
Wdyt? -k

P.S. DavidC: wdyt about combining the two "packages"? I surmise the
package infrastructure overwhelms the size of the actual files
.. whatever, no biggie.

I think doc is fine really.

Is it possible to make
texdoc xii
work (show the pdf) if it's in doc? that might be a slight improvement
but if not I'd leave things as they are.

I wondered about adding the new one into the existing xii package in
ctan but they would have wanted updating package dates etc and I quite
liked having old dates in the xii area so I think a new package is
fine.
It doesn't really need to be in texlive at all (not that it _needs_ to
be on ctan either:-)

that is for the best, I agree. Having gone to to the trouble to write
such ---obfuscated--- clear code, I didn't want to make it _too_  easy

Thanks for solving it Karl! I had forgetten to cc the list one of my email
replies to Denis. From that, he had indicated that he could reach the
tug webiste via a anonymous web proxy (like the TOR idea from Rick Graham
which worked), but knowing that doesn't help us much to understanding why
he was blocked. Still, it is great to have these workarounds if needed in
a pinch.

A good clue was when Denis said that both his laptop and smartphone were
blocked. So, knowing that, it was then very unlikely to be a network/OS
configuration issue on (both) those very different devices - it then
had to be one of the routers on the chain to tug.org, or the server
itself.

Denis, I would still ask your ISP (and/or do a net search for reset IP
for your router model) to find out if there is anyway for you to be able
to change/reset the IP number your router is using. Because one day this
kind of problem might happen again with another site and there likely
won't be such a helpful "Karl" at the server end to open the blocked
IP for you.


  Cheers,

  Mike

I believe that it was just a mistake and there is very low probability that
it will become again. And such mistakes remain unnoticed if a person does
not complain because at the server side everything works as it should.
Changing IP address may be impossible, For instance, my home ADLS router
has ficed IP address and I am glad to have it. Other computers (allowed by
me) can automatically connect to my diskstation and send backups. Andsomer
servers allow administrative access from whitelisted IP address so without
a fixed IP address I would not be allowed to do my work. So there are good
reasons to have an unchangable fixed IP address and ISP may assign it as
default.

If only !? I have to pay for a single fixed IP address at home, and in 
the hotel we have to pay for a block of five fixed IP addresses on our 
FTTP connection and a further one on our ADSL2+; I very much doubt 
whether any major ISP offers a fixed IP address without charge.

Hi Karl,

Thanks for your thoughts and, as ever, your ongoing efforts.

Another (unwanted and probably undesirable) suggestion. Could another 
subdirectory be added to doc/plain as /doc/plain/fun? xii and xii-lat 
could be put into this as well as, say, happy4th, and any others of the 
same ilk

With best wishes to everybody for the Holiday Season and 2018.

Peter W.

Hi Peter - Sorry, but I resist. Experience has shown that subdirectory
levels are not the best way to differentiate content-level things,
because there are too many ways to do it. The subdirectories now are by
format/program and then by package and that's it. Simplicity is good.

To achieve the purpose, there are keywords ("topics") maintained in the
CTAN catalogue, and tlmgr info searches them, among other things:

$ tlmgr info frivolous
..
Packages containing `frivolous' in their title/description:
happy4th - A firework display in obfuscated TeX
pst-fun - Draw "funny" objects with PSTricks
reverxii - Playing Reversi in TeX
xii - Christmas silliness (English)
xii-lat - Christmas silliness (Latin)
..

https://ctan.org/topics/cloud shows all such topics (there are tons).

best,
karl

Subject: [tex-live] location of chktex files
Message-ID: <CANeU4n9GYwPnXtzbsgDE-UBiz-Q9W8yv_SZgUKNQ5rpAnLMBfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, I have a small query regarding the location of the script
files "chktex", in my fedora 27 system with updated TeXLive 2017 I get the
following:
$ ls /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/chktex/
chktexrc
$ ls /usr/local/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/scripts/chktex/
chkweb.sh  deweb.pl
Is the location of "chktexrc" correct? or should it be located in
/scripts/chktex/?
Saludos

Hi Pablo,

    Is the location of "chktexrc" correct? 

I haven't looked at this since Peter B set it up, but I ran 
  strace chktex hello.tex 2>&1 | grep chktexrc
and it did indeed find texmf-dist/chktex/chktexrc. So I conclude the
answer is yes, it is in the right place (for TL; other installations
might put it somewhere else). --best, karl.

Hi Karl,

> 	partially: the tex file is distributed, but not the script.

Indeed, the wordcount.sh is not there ... ctan2tds says in sub
MAKEwordcount:
 print "YOU-MUST-DO! update /tmp/wordcount.sh to source/texk/texlive\n";
It seems something has gone wrong, as the wordcount is nowhere to be
found in tl.

Best

Norbert
