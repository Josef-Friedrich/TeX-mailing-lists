Subject: [tex-live] Wrong pgf manual path in texdoctk.dat
Message-ID: <45486C79.6020802@ecology.uni-kiel.de>

Hi there,

pgf 1.0+ changed the location of the manual from
  latex/pgf/pgfuserguide.pdf
to
 generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/pgfmanual.pdf

This change is missing in texmf/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat (TL 05 as well as
svn).

So I propose to replace the pgf line there with

pgf;User's Guide to the TikZ/PGF
Package;generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/pgfmanual.pdf;

Yours

Karsten

Subject: [tex-live] using JadeTeX with TeX Live
Message-ID: <BAY125-F257B16AB312104DE5D6FF8A3F80@phx.gbl>

I have been trying to make JadeTeX work with TeX Live on a linux RedHat9 
system with no success so far (although I think close).     Wondering if 
someone can help as I see references to use of jadeTeX in the maiing list 
but nothing telling me what I'm doing wrong.

Firstly, I've installed Live TeX by downloading the source.tar.bz2 and 
running Build, i.e. not from am ISO.    Everything appeared to be ok 
although the resulting main tex directory is not in a standard place (it's 
in /sysbuild/livetex).    But after adding  
/sysbuild/livetex/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu  to my PATH, some things seem to 
work ok.

My intended use of jadetex is with the jade backend processors of docbook, 
mainly pdfjadetex.   I've used this on another older system with success 
(but that was with tetex which was already installed).

Now, when I try to follow the instructions for installing jadetex, I come 
unstuck in trying to create the jadetex.fmt and pdfjadetex.fmt.   The 
instructions on the jadetex site seem to imply that latex is needed and that 
a file jadetex.ltx is neded as input (it's referenced in the jadetex.ini and 
pdfjadetex.ini files provided by jadetex).    I don't have latex so I assume 
the tex in my livetex will do it,  but
cd /sysbuild/jadetex-3.13; tex jadetex.dtx
This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.3)
kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt
fmtutil: format `tex' not available.
I can't find the format file `tex.fmt'!

Ok, so I need to build tex.fmt - but I'm not sure how, and all the following 
fail :
fmtutil --cnffile /sysbuild/livetex/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf  --fmtdir 
/sysbuild/livetex/texmf/web2c --byfmt tex
fmtutil: format `tex' not available.
That is because there is no file tex.ini anywhere in or under my 
/sysbuild/livetex - should there be?
(Also I saw mention of an executable fmtutil-sys in some documentation but 
there is no file with that name in my system)

different attempt :
texconfig formats
reports
can't find /sysbuild/livetex/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps

(In fact there is a directory /sysbuild/livetex/texmf/dvips/config but it's 
empty).

It looks to me that my livetex is not setup correctly but I don't know what 
is wrong.     This is my first use of TeX Live, always before I have used 
tetex, but saw that Live TeX has superceded tetex.
I am completely stuck -    can anyone please help?

John

It is now fixed in the repository.  I also added the keywords "tikz"
and "graphics" for people using the search function.

Many thanks for the hint.  If you find any other bugs in texdoctk.dat
please report them here too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes,

$ kpsewhich tex.ini
/opt/tex/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/plain/config/tex.ini

It seems that your TeXLive installation is incomplete.

The TeXLive build system is much more complicated than the teTeX one.
Unless there are no binaries for your platform I recommend to download
the ISO image and install the binaries. 

This is what I get using TeXLive-2005:

$ jadetex '\relax\stop'
This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)
 %&-line parsing enabled.
entering extended mode
JadeTeX 2002/01/25: 3.12
No pages of output.
Transcript written on texput.log.

You don't have to run fmtutil directly and if the system is set up
properly you don't have to specify any paths.

$ texconfig init jadetex
fmtutil: running `pdfetex -ini   -jobname=jadetex -progname=jadetex &latex jadetex.ini' ...
This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5) (INITEX)
 %&-line parsing enabled.
entering extended mode
(/opt/tex/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/jadetex/config/jadetex.ini
[... many lines omitted ...]
No pages of output.
Transcript written on jadetex.log.
fmtutil: /home/reinhard/.texlive2005/texmf-var/web2c/jadetex.fmt installed.

If TeXLive-2005 is installed properly it shouldn't be necessary to
create any format files.

However, at EuroTeX 2003 there had been a talk by Simon Pepping about
DocbookInContext.  I do not know anything about the state of the
project.  Maybe it's worthwhile to contact the Context people.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As I just showed texdoctk to some of my coworkers, this actually might
happen.

Does this occur when running configure as part of the overall TL  
configure process, or only if you try to configure this directory  
separately? The scripts are primarily intended to work as part of the  
whole TL build, and may not work correctly in isolation.

I'll try to look into this, but may not have the opportunity right away.

Subject: [tex-live] Tex-live question.
Message-ID: <454A6F62.6050804@cs.ucsd.edu>

Karl, 

I have what I hope is a easy question.  I need some help with the 
kpathsea mechanisms.  
I have installed the full tex-live on the Mac OS X tiger system and it 
all works (with the
possible exception of kpathsea.)    I have installed the X11 environment 
and am running
the xterm with a tcsh shell.     

When I run tex it complains it cannot locate epsf.tex/epsf.sty.   I will 
paste below the
output from texconfig config showing the environmental configuration.    
Moreover,
I have checked that epsf.tex/epsf.sty is located within
       /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/generic/epsf/
Moreover, the ls-R file within  /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist  
contains this info as
well.

The same behavior occurs with latex -- when latexing sample2e.tex;   in 
this situation.
I obtain ! LaTeX Error: File `article.cls' not found.   Once again, the 
texmf-dist ls-R file
contains this location correctly.

What do I need do with kpathsea?  

Many thanks in advance.

Walt

Karl, 

I have also run kpsewhich in the debug 8 mode showing paths.  
I see a compile time path that does not look at all like the
OS X tiger directory structure.     

My previous message shows the OS X structure to be
	/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf  etc...

I have pasted the output from  kpsewhich -debug 8 epsf.tex   below

There is no mention of texmf-dist here; in fact, only web2c directories are
mentioned.  Recall epsf.tex resides in the generic/epsf/ subdirectory.

Do I have to compile web2c/kpathsea for Mac OS X?

Thanks again for your time and advice.

Thanks. I'm not sure what's really causing the problem, but here are  
some things I notice...

(Copying to tex-live list again, as the problem appears to originate  
outside the parts that I have any knowledge about. Seems to be ttf2pk- 
related; see below.)

(1) You are running a prerelease version of gcc (config.log shows  
that it is "gcc version 4.1.2 20060531 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux)"). I  
don't know if this is a factor; most likely it is fine, but if you  
are able to try a different (possibly more stable) version, that  
might be a good experiment.

(2) The xdvipdfmx configure process fails because it tries to use "  
" (space) as the command to run the C preprocessor (CPP). You can see  
this in the config.log file, for example:

========================

## ----------------- ##
## Output variables. ##

CCDEPMODE='depmode=gcc3'
CFLAGS='-g -O2'
CPP=' '
CPPFLAGS=' -I$(top_builddir)/../../texk -I$(top_srcdir)/../../texk'

========================

(3) This bad setting for CPP appears to be coming from the ttf2pk  
configure process; this is shown by grepping your tlbuild.log file  
for "preprocessor\|configuring in":

========================

Notice how the CPP value was originally "gcc -E", from the top-level  
configure script. This was cached and used by all the sub-configures  
up until ttf2pk. But ttf2pk's configure apparently didn't use the  
cached value, but came up with its own value (blank). This then went  
into the cache, and breaks the subsequent configure of xdvipdfmx. (It  
could also have broken xdvik, but apparently that script didn't  
actually try to use the value.)

So the question becomes why ttf2pk's configure is not behaving  
correctly, and this is not clear to me at the moment. Are you using  
the configure scripts directly as checked-out from TL, or do you run  
reautoconf locally to regenerate them on your system? Do you have  
environment variables that would affect the choice of compiler tools?

One thing that concerns me is that texk/ttf2pk contains both  
configure.in and configure.ac. Presumably one of these is obsolete;  
could it be that the wrong one is being used in generating the  
configure script?

You could try passing --without-ttf2pk to the Build script, to see if  
this will bypass the bad configuration step and then see if xdvipdfmx  
can be configured and built successfully; but of course that would  
not be a real solution, only a workaround for testing purposes.

Subject: [tex-live] tex-live install
Message-ID: <200611031937.kA3Jb3P17491@f7.net>

Hi Walt,

    compile-time path = /usr/local/Build/i386/TeXLive.tl2005/share/texmf:/var/tmp/texfonts

The compile-time path is not normally relevant.  Instead, the tex
binaries are "self-locating".  So if the main tree is
/usr/local/texlive/2005, the binaries should be at
/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/powerpc-darwin (or i386-darwin).  Are they?

Actually, never mind.  I believe the last line shows the problem:
TEXINPUTS=.:/Users/burkhard/TEX

Try changing your envvar setting to include a trailing :, like this:
TEXINPUTS=.:/Users/burkhard/TEX:

As you may or may not have noticed, TL is set up to search $HOME/texmf
automatically.  So if you used `texmf' instead of `TEX' for your
directory name, you wouldn't have to have any envvars at all.

By the way, what generated all that debug output?  It is very nice.

Best,
Karl

Karl,


IIRC, a longer time ago I asked you to accept `8g' encoding for groff,
and you agreed.  I assume that you've updated your local copy of
variant.map, but you haven't installed it in TeXLive.  Is this
intentional?

A similar thing is `8v' encoding, still marked as `to be defined'.
Reinhard has already added a lot of Vietnamese fonts ending with `8v',
and which use T5 encoding...

Subject: [tex-live] "other-free" licence definition in the catalogue
Message-ID: <10073.1162629465@cl.cam.ac.uk>

we (the ctan team) have added a new "licence" definition to the
catalogue (though there aren't any entries using it yet...).

we will label as "other-free" packages whose authors appear to have
intended to make them freely available, but "got it wrong", or didn't
even try to specify use of one of the standard licences (e.g., just said
"this package may be used and distributed freely").

the intention is not to subvert anyone's efforts towards licensing of
"correctly" specified packages -- the idea is to have a less draconian
category than "other" has been up to now.  you may care to compare the
two entries

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/help/catalogue/licenses.other.html
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/help/catalogue/licenses.other-free.html

as you will see, other-free does no more than suggest that it's more
likely to be safe using packages thus categorised than does other.

Message-ID: <86psc3ildh.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

carlisle.tpm contains entries for ltxtable.pdf (DocFiles) and
ltxtable.tex (SourceFiles).  But the actual RunFile, ltxtable.sty, is
missing.  It is packed in ltxtable.tex with a filecontents environment.

If I was to fix this, would I have to adapt one of the perl scripts?  Or
should I manually generate ltxtable.sty and add it in the tpm file?

TIA, Frank

For example, I've been at a loss how to classify a package whose source
code has a different license than its documentation (GPL vs. FDL).

This is only in TeX Live 2005, the current svn depot has ltxtable.sty
already included and the tpm file lists it.

No, I simply haven't yet rewritten/reinstated the script I used to run
via cron to update fontname and other stuff into TL.  It'll happen.

    A similar thing is `8v' encoding, still marked as `to be defined'.

I changed "to be defined" to "T5" in variant.map.

Thanks - I did that (and see why you say more complicated) and eventually it 
all works fine ...

I did try some of the alternative "smaller" options provide by command <s> 
of the install-tl.sh -
but none other than "full scheme" worked for me.   I tried
F TeX Live medium scheme       ===>>>  could not find the pdfjadetex fmt
H XML typesetting scheme        ===>>>   could not find some file ecrm1000
I won't be able to leave it there using all 1GB (it's on a temp backup 
partition).    Do you or anyone know if it's possible to somehow customise a 
livetex installation for running pdfetex and jadetex?   The smaller ones I 
tried used only 200MB and 100MB respectively.    This full one has about 12 
languages I will never use.   But I don't know what is safe to erase.     Or 
can I add the missing pices to a smaller one?    Maybe some use of texconfig 
might do it?

Hello Jonathan,

No, I don't run reautoconf. And I didn't find such variables in my
environment.

Yes, without ttf2pk, the configuration ends with success.

OK -- not surprising, but good to have confirmation of this.

If you're not running autoconf or the reautoconf script locally, then  
it won't make any difference -- you'll just be running the configure  
script that came from the repository.

> Yes, without ttf2pk, the configuration ends with success.

So this confirms my conclusion that the issue is ttf2pk's configure  
script that is failing, and storing a bad value in the cache, which  
then breaks later configure processes.

Anyone able to investigate the ttf2pk configure problem? I'm guessing  
(from comparing my log from a Mac OS X build with Peter's Linux log)  
that it may be triggered by the --with-system-freetype option.

Peter, could you try building without system-freetype (but with  
ttf2pk), and see if that helps?

JK

    Why is the documentation for etex in texmf-dist?  

I suspect it's because there are also macro files, like etex.sty, and
putting all of them in texmf-dist meant that more of the tpm creation
could be automated.  Just a guess, I didn't do it.

    Shouldn't it be rather in texmf/doc/etex/, similar to, say,
    texmf/doc/pdftex?

I suppose, but does it matter?  Or maybe the pdftex doc should be moved
to texmf-dist.  After all, if the idea is that texmf contains only stuff
which is architecture/distribution-dependendent, neither *tex doc falls
into that category.  I dunno, am inclined to do nothing unless there's a
compelling reason to change.

Thanks,
karl

That is cm-super.  Perhaps try XML and then add the "extra fonts"
collection (C from the installer).

    can I add the missing pices to a smaller one?    Maybe some use of texconfig 

Not texconfig, but you can choose the collections to install via the
interactive installer.  What you want is the "HTML/SGML/XML sup"
collection for jadetex, so I guess another thing to play with is start
with the basic or medium scheme, add that HTML collection (and "extra
fonts"), and build up from there if more is needed.

As for languages, you can deselect them with L.  So that would be
another approach: start with scheme-full, get rid of the languages and
anything else that looks obviously useless.

Sorry it isn't as easy as it might be.

Best,
Karl

Hello Jonathan,
yes, it's triggered by the --with-system-freetype. Without this option,
there no such problem.

Jonathan and all,

I just renamed several of the XeTeX-related directories to try to make
the tpm names more understandable -- e.g., not "config.tpm".  I doubt
anything depended on those intermediate directory names, but let me know
if anything seems problematic.

The tpm files in general are updated now to current reality, and the
dependency/coverage checks are clean.  Next I'll try some test installs
and update the map files.

Hi Karl!

I have again submitted loads of updates in one go. I have changed
strategy and wrote a script that analyzes the output of ctan2tl and
now I am going from easy to hard updates:
- no files added/deleted, no lines changed
	-> just add it to tpm-ctan-check
- no files added/deleted, but files changed
	-> add it to tpm-ctan-check and update the package
Up to here I am more or less finished
- 1 file added/deleted, files changed
	These are the packages I want to do today.

After today I have one more day and then I am leaving for
Cambodia/Vietnam, so nothing from my side. I checked in the scripts into 
	SVN/Build/tools/etc
for those who want to check themselves, no doc, will probably not work
out of the box.

Anyway, have a nice time.

Yes I know, but these scripts are in development, I thought about
including them directly in tools after they have grown into something
at least a bit useful. But you can move them if you want, I don't mind.

BTW: Should I check in the file which gives the two diffs for all the
missing tpms? It is usefull to look at *which* tpms one should work on,

Interesting reading, thanks.  Git is fine for Keith and X and whatever
else (we might use it for gnuzilla), but I have no intention of losing
another year migrating TL to something else.  Especially when the UI is
declared as "needs improvement".  I certainly don't claim that svn is
optimal, but I think it works well enough, and there are plenty of other
more important things to work on.

By the way, I plan to upgrade subversion on tug soon, and hopefully then
make use of the new repository compression features that were mentioned
earlier.

Thanks,

I looked back in the .err file from when I tex'd using the full install and 
saw it found a file

.../texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cyrillic/t2acmr.fd

and sure enough there is no 
./usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cyrillic in my custom-build 
tree -  so I thought I would just copy that one dir from the full build into 
the custom build, which I did, and to my surprise it still gave the exact 
same complaint.    I guess the lower-upper case distinction is significant!

I trie once more, this time choosing every possible latex option, (but still 
rejecting macro/font doc and source trees) and still same complaint.   So 
now I give up.   Maybe I can ignore this error, latex certainly continued 
ok, but do you or anyone know what options I would need to specify to 
provide latex with its T2Acmr.fd ?

Yeah.

I was trying to update dvipng, but ran out of time halfway through (a
while ago).  I thought I had reverted my changes, but apparently not.
Meanwhile, another new version has been released, so an update has to
happen anyway.

It's another thing that I have to straighten out, unless someone else
can dive into the autoconfiscation stuff.  (And then there is dvipdfmx
and who knows what else.)

Thanks,

Hi John,

    tree -  so I thought I would just copy that one dir from the full build into 
    the custom build, which I did, and to my surprise it still gave the exact 
    same complaint.    

Did you run mktexlsr after copying the directory?

    I guess the lower-upper case distinction is significant!

I thought LaTeX checks for both.  And the filename has been lowercase
for a while, if not forever.

I'm puzzled as to why you're getting the error in the first place,
though.  Are you typesetting Cyrillic?  Perhaps it's related to some XML
thing.  Like it's trying to support everything possible in Unicode since
XML wants Unicode, regardless of what is actually needed.

     options I would need to specify to 
    provide latex with its T2Acmr.fd ?

My guess is to include the "langcyrillic" collection -- do L to
customize language collections.

Best,
Karl

I did not - but have now done so and latex now finds its    
.../texlive/2005/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cyrillic/t2acmr.fd
so that was the answer to that problem - thanks.

I am not knowingly typesetting Cyrllic, no.     a very ordinary en_US file, 
but the source is sgml which is then parsed by docbook V4.5CR3 and formed 
into tex by openjade, so who knows what was introduced by that.   Naively, 
the string "cyrllic" (case insignificant) does not appear in the tex input 
file ...

I tried that as part of a later rebuild and that worked too.    So I now 
have an un-tinkered-with final build of 576128 Meg which tex's a 
from-docbook file with no errors (for this document).   I assume it is also 
safe to erase the texmf-dist/doc directory?      at least, for tex'ing 
documents?     As that is at 100MB and I can always get it back temporarily 
if I need it.    (Is it on the web anywhere?   I am a bit confused by all 
the different tex docs)

Thanks very much indeed for all your help!

John

Subject: [tex-live] utopia fonts free license clarification
Message-ID: <200611171945.kAHJjc008886@f7.net>

I am happy to announce that Adobe has graciously clarified the licensing
terms of the Utopia font family, making it clear that the fonts can be
modified, and such modifications can be redistributed (this was
previously ambiguous, unfortunately).  Therefore, the Utopia fonts can
now be considered free (as in freedom), and will be included on the next
TeX Live.

I have updated the license terms in the original Utopia afm and pfb
files, and the new files are available at http://tug.org/fonts/utopia,
and soon from CTAN:fonts/utopia.  The actual font information (glyphs,
metrics, etc.) is entirely unchanged.

For those who are concerned about such things, the precise license terms
from Adobe and other legal information is also available at
http://tug.org/fonts/utopia.

Happy typesetting,
Karl

That's great news, nice work.

I've resently started to use utopia and fourier quite a lot, both in my 
own projects and promoting it to others. So making it more easily 
available for the basic user is great news.

Yes, it's certainly not needed at runtime.  If you have texmf/doc and/or
the top-level hierarchy texmf-doc, those can be deleted too.  Likewise
*/source.

    Is it on the web anywhere?   

Well, the TL repository itself is on the web
(http://tug.org/svn/texlive).  But usually one is best off looking at
CTAN (http://www.ctan.org) when doing package research, etc.

Subject: [tex-live] context/metafun memory sizes
Message-ID: <45618E96.60107@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

I just looked at texmf.cnf and saw these values (in relative
order of appearance)

   main_memory           = 1500000
   main_memory.context   = 1500000
   main_memory.mpost     = 1500000
   main_memory.mpost     = 1000000
   main_memory.metafun   = 2500000

   pool_size             = 1250000
   pool_size.mpost       =  500000
   pool_size.metafun     = 1000000

I propose to include only this:

   main_memory           = 1500000
   pool_size             = 1250000

Context's main_memory requirements compared to other packages are
no longer as excessive as they once were, it seems ;-)

Metafun can easily run with 1 mln words less, the extra size is
only needed for really, really large images.

Additionally, if there are various metapost main_memory sizes, you
have to be really,really careful about using -progname or the new
metapost 0.99 will refuse to load the .mem files.

Message-ID: <4561C381.9040607@elvenkind.com>


Hi,

I just checked in the sources for metapost 0.99. Hopefully, it will 
compile ok (rev #2470)

However, I am not completely done yet.

* Still missing is mpware/dmp.

   There is quite an important update adding support for groff as well
   as heirloom troff, but: the (new) one in the metapost distibution
   does not use kpathsea for file searching, whereas the (old) one in
   texlive does.

   I am not sure what the best course of action is... attempt to patch
   the new version for use with kpathsea or include the non-kpathsea
   version?

* Still missing are the TEXMF files.

   Also still missing are the files for Master/texmf-dist; I am
   awaiting a reply from Werner and/or Michail on the best location
   for the troff-related files.

* I have changed 'convert', but not 'convert.bat'

   Mpost now needs mp.defines for the font inclusion library
   (mpdir subdirectory). But I have not touched convert.bat. I do
   not understand that file, and if I change anything I'll probably
   break it completely, so i decided to leave it alone.

* Cross-compilation:

   mpdir/loadcpool.c is compiled into executable form, and is then
   used to massage mp.pool into loadpool.c for inclusion into the
   executable (instead of runtime mp.pool discovery). This should work
   ok, except that in the metapost distribution,  I have cross-compiler
   support in autoconf/Makefile.in.

   Cross-compile support appears to be lacking from TeXLive, so I changed
   "$(native)" to  "./". But if there actually _is_ cross-compilation
   support this needs fixing; building mpost won't work under a
   cross-compiler right now.

Greetings, Taco

It built on tug.org, and mpost --version works.  Yay!  Thanks!

       the new version for use with kpathsea or include the non-kpathsea
       version?

I defer to you and Werner on deciding what to do.  Not being a groff
person, I don't know how important the kpathsea searching is there.

    * I have changed 'convert', but not 'convert.bat'

Hopefully Akira (or someone) can make the Windows build work, one way or
another ... Akira, any chance of looking at this when you have a chance?

   Cross-compile support appears to be lacking from TeXLive, 

As I recall, we've never tried to support cross-compilation in the TL
source tree.  At any rate, I'm not worried about it for now.

I presume the settings

That's great, simply great!

However, I am still concerned about details of the wording: The license
is granted to "the TeX Users Group".  Does that mean that only TUG is
allowed to modify and (re)distribute the fonts?  What about a publisher
who wants to accompany their book on LaTeX with a copy of a TeXlive DVD?
Or should we read "TeX Users Group" as "anyone among those who use TeX"?

Oh, yes, I must apologize.  I missed the following part:

,----
| The TeX Users Group is also permitted to sublicense, and grant such
| sublicensees the right to further sublicense, any or all the foregoing
| rights through multiple tiers of distribution.

I guess by distributing it with TeXlive, the TUG is doing this, at least
implicitly.

    The license is granted to "the TeX Users Group".  

Yeah.  Suboptimal, but that was only way Adobe would do it.

    Or should we read "TeX Users Group" as "anyone among those who use TeX"?

No.  But TUG has granted the sublicensing modification and/or
distribution rights to everyone (as Reinhard just replied).

Message-ID: <200611240001.kAO01oA08296@f7.net>

I am thinking of removing the mathtime and lucida metrics from TL.  It
seems to me that they can only cause confusion and inconsistencies --
any new users should be getting the packages from TUG and/or PCTeX
(which contain everything), and the few existing users who bought the
packages from Y&Y can get the updated files from CTAN, if they want
them.

Am I forgetting some constituency who will miss them?
Any other objections?

Thanks,
Karl

Dear Dr Sebastian Rahtz,

I shall be grateful if you could help.

I have the MacTeXdmg distribution, and I make use of
TeXshop on MacOSX.4. The distribution didn't come with
kuvio.tex, and I had to download and install it from
CTAN.

I have tried to install the arrsy font, which is a
subdirectory, but it distorts kuvio.

J S Milne (Guide to commutative diagram packages ?
www.jmilne.org/not/CDGuide.pdf), also makes this
observation.

I am writing to ask if this problem can be rectified;
and I shall be pleased to read from you.

Best Wishes

Offiong Offiong

Hello Offiong,

(Sebastian is mostly "TeX Live emeritus" these days, so I'm replying.)

    I have tried to install the arrsy font, which is a
    subdirectory, but it distorts kuvio.

You need to write to the kuvio and/or arrsy authors about this.  I have
basically no knowledge of using the package.

As it happens, I learned that kuvio is not distributed under a free
license, so it will not be in the next edition of TL at all.  It was a
mistake that it was ever included.  (It forbids modification, among
other things.)

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <200611260201.kAQ21Ai29822@tug.org>

Hi Eddie,

I hope you won't mind making the small changes below to the configure.in
in lcdf-typetools.  Otherwise --enable-tetex-build doesn't know that
opentype is available.  The AC_MSG_NOTICE just makes me feel better that
I know which path is being executed.

(I've had some advice from the autoconf list about possible ways to
avoid having to hardwire every kpse-related test when
--enable-tetex-build.  Something to look into later.)

By the way, was the removal of the ChangeLog from the source
distribution intentional?  Just curious.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Gerben,
don't worry about TTF fonts in psfonts.map, ps2pk.map, or dvipdfm.map.
They don't hurt.

If you want to use TTF fonts with pdftex and equivalent Type1 fonts
with other programs it's best to use the pdftex primitives \pdfmapfile
and \pdfmapline.  They are described in the pdftex manual.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

I guess you could specify --dvipsoutputdir and --dvipdfmoutputdir to be
something temporary and remove it after?

But I agree with Reinhard that it's better to just have all three maps
be the same.  It's already intolerably confusing.  And maybe dvips
and/or dvipdf[m][x] will acquire truetype/opentype support one day.
(Maybe the latter already has, for all I know.)

If anyone may want to use the .tex file sometime in the future the
\pdfmap primitives can provide a record of the fonts needed by the
document.   Anytime you use some non-standard fonts it is probably
better to use the primitives than some clever map file(s) that may not
 be available in the distant future.

Hi all,

I am pleased to announce that a beta version of the upcoming
MetaPost release can be downloaded:

    https://foundry.supelec.fr/frs/?group_id=13&release_id=185

There is a source distribution available, and also binary
packages for linux and win32 (cross-compiled using mingw32).

There are a few differences compared to the previous beta:

* The manual 'mpman' is now up-to-date
* Hartmut found a few typos in the 'mpgraph' manual
* Some small changes are made to the groff font support
* dmp now uses kpathsea searching by default
* makempx is now a compiled executable on all systems.

This is the definitive version for TeX Live, and has already
been committed to the texlive repository (#2554, #2555).

Have fun,

Taco

Hi Taco,
it seems that makempx.c is missing in the TeX-Live repository.  There
is only a shell script makempx.in.

gcc -o makempx makempx.o  ../lib/lib.a ../../kpathsea/.libs/libkpathsea.a -lm
gcc: makempx.o: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [makempx] Error 1

Regards and many thanks,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <86zmaawr99.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

a Debian user just reported that dstroke.map is not included in
TeXlive.  This is still the case in the repository:

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tpm/doublestroke.tpm

does not list stroke.map, although it exists in

http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/doublestroke/

The consequence is that the (installed) Type1 files are not used.  I
think the map file should be included in TeXlive.
