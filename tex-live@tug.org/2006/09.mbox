Hello

This is probably off-topic, but forgivable.

I've started a thread on c.t.t. that I hope
is of interest to some of the readers here.

If this interests you, I suggest you join
in the discussion on c.t.t. (but not here).

I finally figured out something important:  if I let the texlive sources 
as found in
http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/source/source.tar.bz2
build the way the way they want to build, unmodified, kpathsea will look 
for texmf.cnf under /usr/share/texmf.  That's great, because that's how I 
need things organized.

That's also startling because the texlive data tree as installed from the 
standard texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso lands at 
/usr/share/texlive/2005/texmf*.  And that path is nowhere on the paths 
searched by kpathsea as built above.

Am I overlooking something obvious?  Do I have the wrong .iso?

BTW, based on a message from Reinhard on 8/1/06, I get the impression 
that I should let the texmf/ tree created by the build override the one 
installed from the .iso, but texmf-dist/ should come from the .iso.  Am I 
right?

Yes, there are no paths compiled into binaries.  The config files are
found relative to the place where the shell finds the binaries.
All you have to do is to keep the directory structure intact.

    <installdir>/[<platform>/]bin/
    <installdir>/[share/]/texmf*

The directories "<platform>" and "share" are optional.

In your case, it will look like this:

    /usr/bin
    /usr/share/texmf*

A binary in /usr/bin which supports kpathsea will search for

    /usr/bin/../texmf.cnf

and

    /usr/bin/../share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

The first one usually doen't exist.  It is useful for local changes
made by the system administrator.  A variable which is set there will
not be overwritten when the second file is evaluated.  That means that
a system admin can change variables here and nothing will be lost
after a system upgrade.

Yes.  The stuff in texmf-dist is system independent.  There are macro
packages, documentation and so on.

The files in texmf are generated or modified at compile-time.

For instance, each tex engine needs a matching pool file.  Pool files
are platform independent but pdftex-1.40 will not work with
pdftex.pool from pdftex-1.30.

I did not tell you the whole truth about texmf.cnf yet.

It is not sufficient to find texmf.cnf, all the other files have to be
found too.  Files are found relative to the bin directory, but it
makes a difference whether the binaries had been compiled with the
--disable-multiplatform option or not.

You can check yourself:  Compare the texmf.cnf file which you created
yourself with that which comes with TeXLive.

You'll see that the texmf base directory is called $SELFAUTOPARENT in
texmf.cnf provided by TeXLive and $SELFAUTODIR in that you built
yourself.

The reaeson is that TeXLive has to find them in

     <installdir>/bin/<platform>/../../share/texmf*

and in your case they have to be found in

     <installdir>/bin/../share/texmf*

Assume that TeXLive provides binaries for every platform you want to
support.  You don't have to compile anything yourself then.

Just install TeXLive in /tmp, move the bin directory and the texmf*
trees to appropriate places and replace all occurrences of
$SELFAUTOPARENT by $SELFAUTODIR in /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.

A few words about texmf-dist:

If you can put the whole texmf-dist tree into your distribution, that
would be best.  If you have to create a subset it does not make much
sense to re-invent the wheel.  I recommend you look into other TeX
distributions, for instance Debian.

If you try to do everything yourself it's a lot of work for you.  But
it is also desirable that the various TeX distributions are not too
different.  It is easier to provide help to people who ask on the
mailing lists if all the TeX distributions are quite similar.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have no problems increasing this and doing a recompile. But I would 
need to know *exactly* what to change and where as I do not have the 
time to find this out myself. So, this should first be taken up on the 
TeX Live mailing list.

Ladies and gents on texlive: what needs to be changed here and does 
anything need to be changed at all or is it a matter of config values 
at runtime after all?

Subject: [tex-live] License auditing: Consequences
Message-ID: <86odtvvi2h.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

as outlined in my previous e-mail, I've found some files with non-free
license statements, or none at all (and am probably going to find
more).  I am sure that I will not be able to do all the work of
contacting authors (of sometimes age-old packages) and talking to them
about proper licensing.  Therefore I'm considering sending postings to
comp.text.tex (and maybe also language-specific TeX groups), asking for
help. 

In order to be able to express properly the urgency and consequences of
non-relicensing, I would like to get some information about how TeXLive
used to handle, or is going to handle such cases.  Debian is in the
fortunate position to posess a non-free archive, which - although not
part of Debian proper - serves users well.  Therefore we may be able to
sort things into the non-free category more lightheartedly than
TeXLive. 

How would you act on files

- without any license statement, except the implicit grant to distribute
  (by uploading to CTAN)

- with some sort of public domain statement, not saying clearly what
  this means (problematic since "public domain" doesn't exist in may
  jurisdictions) 

- saying that they are licensed under license $FOO (mostly LPPL), but at
  the same time "explaining" what that means in words that never really
  matched the proper meaning of $FOO, or only old versions

Do TeXLive people make a difference in license requirements between TeX
input files and examples or documentation?  Would a package with a "this
file is under license $foo" header in the style file, but no license
information at all for documentation qualify for inclusion in TeXLive?

Thanks in advance,
Frank

ctan experience is that one gets essentially no response.

but surely, if texlive is a part of debian tex strategy, confusion is
engendered if there's no clear split between free and nonfree, in
texlive?

fwiw, we have had to give up the ctan nonfree tree; we did a small
amount of systematic work on it, and realised that the two would end
up roughly equal sizes: we simply don't have that amount of processing
effort.

i mark them licence 'unknown' -- my assumption is that such packages
should be regarded as nonfree

i mark them licence 'pd' -- i really have no clear idea how such a
thing might be treated legally, but we do have that implicit
permission to distribute.

> - saying that they are licensed under license $FOO (mostly LPPL), but at

i mark such packages as other.

i tend to let such packages stand, provided they have the standard
rubric "or any later version, at your convenience".

another one that is bothering me is:

- claiming a licence that requires source distribution, but not
  providing source.

i'm searching such things out, and marking them unknown (see above),
hence nonfree (in my view).

if the documentation is a derived product (as is often the case with
latex and context things), this isn't an issue (or is it?).

i've not investigated the licences applied to documentation, in fact.

note, when i say above "i do <x> to a package", i'm referring to what
i write in the tex catalogue.

What a tremendous amount of work.  I only wish the same amount of work
could go into improving the distribution.

    - without any license statement, except the implicit grant to distribute
      (by uploading to CTAN)

Not intended to be included in TL.

    - with some sort of public domain statement, not saying clearly what
      this means 

I certainly allow public domain (as does the FSF, as far as I've ever
heard).  For one thing, many fundamental parts of the TeX system are
labeled "public domain", going back to dvitype and most notably
including metapost, not to mention the tex live documentation.  It would
be nonsensical to exclude them from TL.  

      (problematic since "public domain" doesn't exist in may jurisdictions) 

I can't do anything about that.  Virtually any license will be
interpreted differently in different jurisdictions, seems to me.

Personally, it seems to me that public domain is the least restricted
license possible!

    - saying that they are licensed under license $FOO (mostly LPPL), 

If they obviously intend the thing to be free per FSF definition, then I
don't quibble over the exact wording, although clarity would clearly be
preferable.

    Do TeXLive people make a difference in license requirements between
    TeX input files and examples or documentation?  

Not intentionally.

    Would a package with a "this file is under license $foo" header in
    the style file, but no license information at all for documentation
    qualify for inclusion in TeXLive?

The source should be available.  As Robin said, for most latex packages
(and hence most of tl), the source is the dtx file, so that's fine.

When the source is not available, either I exclude just the
documentation (context being the main example here) or the entire
package (some small latex packages I have noticed).

Best,
Karl

Hi Robin,
does it mean that no packages will be added to the nonfree tree any
more or does it mean that the nonfree tree will disappear former or
later?

it means that nothing is being added to it at the present.  just now
we're working flat out on user interfaces, and haven't time to
classify, catalogue, code ... as much as we would like, let alone
juggle trees.

Lee -- In web2c, most of the bibtex arrays are dynamically grown as
necessary; the 5000 BUF_SIZE is the initial size, not that hardcoded
maximum (in contrast to the original code).  It would seem your big
entries have found something that is still hardwired, or something else
is going wrong.  Can you please send the aux and bib files that cause
the problem so we can try to reproduce?

Not in the sense that I would exclude them.  But I've been told
repeatedly that it's better to add "You may freely use, modify and/or
distribute this file".  This is because "public domain" is not a
well-defined concept in many jurisdictions, and somewhat problematic
even in the US, and *may* cause problems if someone else gets hold on
the author's intellectual property.  

Therefore, if Donald has to touch many files anyway, we can as well
request him to do this, too (or have someone else do it; a public
statement "go ahead and reupload my packages with the changes proposed"
would be fine, too).

Only a lawyer would see problems -- here in Canada a "misplaced" comma
in an industry-standard boilerplate contract clause seems to have cost
one large telco a few million $.

Cleaning up licenses is not only important for TeX itself, but also
serves as an example of "best practices" that will encourage others to
exercise care with licensing.

Sorry, I don't know the answer there.  I mean, it's true there is no
texconfig.exe binary in the distribution, but I don't know what (if
anything) has replaced it.

    2, those $TEXMFxxx not replaced with real directory names in the
    texmf.cnf file

They're not supposed to be.  Is something causing a problem?  It seems
like you have a basically-working system ...

    pdf: image inclusion failed for (reverse_linked_list.eps).

PDF files do not allow for inclusion of general .eps files.  Try running
epstopdf reverse_linked_list.eps, and then including the .pdf.

Best,
Karl

    "You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this file".  

Those exact words?  I guess it is good, except, hmm, the usual ambiguity
in "free".  I wonder about 
  "You may use, modify and/or distribute this file without restriction".

Also, with a copyright line, or no copyright line?

    we can as well request him to do this

Agreed.  And I have no objection to changing the various tiny TL files
which say "public domain" now.  If you or anyone would like to prepare a
patch, that would be great :).  And I can have Eplain changed.  But I
don't really want to explain this to Knuth or Hobby ...

Steven's "D section" in the file "config" for dvipdfm
is the one for Unix:

D "zcat -f %i | gs -q ..."

If he changes the line as follows (one line):

D "gswin32c -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sPAPERSIZE=a0
-sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4
-dAutoFilterGrayImages=false -dAutoFilterColorImages=false
-dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode
-dUseFlateCompression=true -sOutputFile=%o -c .setpdfwrite -f %i -c quit"

eps will be changed into pdf automatically by Ghostscript.

Akira

Subject: [tex-live] Bug in syntax package
Message-ID: <44FE266C.7000106@pakin.org>

The syntax.sty package that ships with the 20051102 version of TeX Live has
a serious bug: Line 191 refers to a nonexistent \@foundunderscore macro
that gets triggered when an underscore is used in the right-hand side of a
rule.  (At least, that's how I encountered the problem.)  I have no idea
where this version of syntax.sty comes from.  The version on CTAN, which
doesn't have this \@foundunderscore bug, is dated 1996/05/17 and is version
1.07.  The TeX Live version is also dated 1996/05/17 but is version 1.9.
Here's a diff of the two versions:

<                 [1996/05/17 1.9 Syntax typesetting (MDW)]

thank you Akira, using of gswin32c elimates the previous error and i
got a pdf file.  but in the file, there is no picture!  i then checked
the debug messages, then found the following line:

Are you really on Windows ?

I think you are using graphicx package.
Please try to include the package by the 'dvipdfm' option:

\usepackage[dvipdfm]{graphicx}

If failed to include eps, transform eps to pdf manually
as Karl said:
epstopdf reverse_linked_list.eps
(or perl somewhere/epstopdf.pl reverse_linked_list.eps)

In order to embed the pdf, you have to invoke the command:

ebb reverse_linked_list.pdf

before compiling the source by latex. This command creates a file
reverse_liked_list.bb which contains information on BoudingBox.

In this case also, the above 'dvipdfm' option for the
graphicx package is important.

Best regards,
Akira

It is possible that dvipdfm denies to embed the PDF
because PDF version is newer than dvipdfm knows.
Please try by lowering the CompatibilityLevel:
-dCompatibilityLevel=1.3

shall i try asking?  if so, what exactly should i say?  i note (from
working on context stuff for the catalogue) that there's an fsf page
outlining pd -- i presume that's reliable, so i guess i should read
it.

there has been at least one attempt to explain the issue to knuth.  i
think that, at the time, his world didn't encompass the concept people
of ill will being involved with tex stuff (i wonder if the present
increasing nastiness of the world at large has changed his mind?).

don't know hobby.

it's from mark wooding's mdwtools, and the licence is gpl.  i do
occasionally hear from mark (he was briefly on the uktug committee),
but he seems to hop email addresses and i don't know where he is now.

i'll have a try at contacting him again.

meanwhile, please submit a corrected copy of the .dtx and we'll get it
to ctan in time for the next texlive.

I don't see an ambiguity in "freely".  The adverbial construction for
"without cost" would be "for free" instead.

Message-ID: <357531321.26397@eyou.net>

Dear all,

I am using TeXLive 2005 now, however, I found that it more slower than
TeXLive 2003. Every program, e.g., latex, pdflatex, dvips, and so on,
is lower than the one in TeXLive 2003 distribution.

I run ``latex sample2e.tex'' from command line, the command latex in
TeXLive 2005 completed the compilation using about 6.95 second, however, 
the one in TeXLive2003 using about 1.45 second. 

Of course, the timer here is wall clock. I don't know how to time the 
program run time under Windows.

My OS is Windows XP, and I run those program from command line (cmd).

Any suggestions will be really appreciated!

Best regards,

Jinsong

I cannot help on this, but I can comfirm that TL is getting slower and 
slower.

Our Linux servers does not get any faster, so the argument that peoples 
PCs are getting faster and faster so the TL compilation speed is not a 
big issue is simply not true.

Thanks to Jerzy for pointing me the program ntimer.exe 
which displays the Elapsed, Kernel, User and Idle time
of the image specified in the command line.

After run latex from TeXLive2005 and TeXLive 2003 using
the following command:

ntimer -l -f -s latex sample2e.tex

I get the following results (get with diff), it shows that
the TeXLive2005 is much slower that TeXLive2003.

Does it just because using pdfeTeXk instead of e-TeXk? 
If it's true, how to switch to e-TeXk from pdfeTeXk?

If you are producing DVI in either case, then the one number which
looks disconcerting is "Total System Calls": with the use of kpathsea
and its database, they number of system calls should remain
comparable.  The other numbers can be due to a larger executable
(because the initial arrays have larger sizes), in particular if
memory is somewhat scarce.

But the quadrupling of the system calls sounds like something one
should try to track down.

Is the TL2005 version generating DVI or PDF output by default? If  
PDF, that would explain some slow-down (though not usually as much as  
you seem to have). If it's generating DVI, then there should be  
little difference.

How are these two TL systems installed -- on the same machine? On  
different disks? Could one texmf tree be on a significantly faster  
disk than the other?

Does the TL2005 setup also have a large personal (non-hashed) texmf  
tree?

Is the machine low on RAM? I can imagine that might matter more with  
TL2005 as the programs typically allocate more memory these days.

FWIW, my Dell machine (nearly 2 yrs old) runs "latex sample2e" with  
TL2005 in about 0.2 - 0.3 seconds (real time; varies a bit from one  
run to the next). That's under Linux, not Windows, and I don't have  
TL2003 alongside to compare, but it doesn't "feel" slow to me.

I guess I didn't express myself sufficiently clearly:

   * The syntax.sty that's on CTAN works fine.

   * The syntax.sty that ships with TeX Live 20051102 is buggy.

   * Both versions have the same release date but the TeX Live version
     has a later version number.

When I wrote, "I have no idea where this version of syntax.sty comes
from" I meant, "because it's not the one from CTAN".

this also depends on

(1) the size of the tree
(2) the size of the format 
(3) the memory settings for tex 

i would not be surprised if these differ for your setup for 2003 and 2005

How much of each did you install?  I suspect the biggest time penalty
is associated with the size of the texmf trees.

Matlab startup times are much less when the matlab tree is excluded
from AV scans.  Has anybody checked this for TeX on Win32?

Well, some confusion will stay anyway: Unless the FSF presents a revised
version of the GFDL which is acceptable to the majority of Debian
developers, GFDL-licensed documentation in texlive will be in a separate
non-free Package in Debian, anyway.  So there's not *much* more
confusion on the users' side if some input files are in non-free, too.
However, I'd rather avoid this, both because I generally dislike these
"my type of freedom, your type of freedom" discussions, and because it
would be much more work.

I had at least one without such a rubric.  I'm not sure whether this has

the gfdl is pretty much a joke, afaics (at least one reputable-seeming
source seems to contradict its terms -- as distributed it formats with
latex into a terrible mess).  anyone who can persuade the fsf to sort
the thing out will be doing the world a good service.

probably not, but without even knowing what packages you're looking

Ah, it's varwidth.sty, by Donald Arseneau, with

No "or later", but the file that's currently behind that link does not
require renaming if you do the "identify to the user" stuff.  That's
contradictory, and we don't know which older version he referred to (we
can only guess if we know what was there in 2003, but I fear that
changed...) 

Anyway, I'm not going to remove files from Debian with such a reasoning.
Even if it had only the one sentence after "Essentially", it would be
free IMO, so the intention is clear, and this I trust every judge will
also find, at least where I live.

The problem is that the GFDL is not a software license and was never
intended as such.  So it was not intended to meet the definitions of
free software.  I find it a rather good compromise for publishing
documents that are to be available on paper mainly.  The closer
documentation becomes integrated into and a part of software, the more
problematic this gets, however.

Since Debian does not view documentation separately from software, it
is not surprising that they don't consider GFDL free.

GFDL will get overhauled after GPLv3, and at least the invariant
sections are slated to leave according to Eben Moglen.

How much the FSF and their legal counsel will take into account that
the relationship between typical GFDL documents and software turned
out different than anticipated will remain to be seen.

The pdfTeX manual is currently licensed under the GFDL (it seemed a
good idea then). What are the preferred alternatives? Not GPL or BSD,
please.

For a basically standalone manual, I still consider this a good choice
and better than most alternatives.  GFDL is more problematic for
something like Emacs, where manual sections are used for interactive
help and frequent code examples and DOC strings are exchanged between
the code and the manual.

This kind of cross-license-threshold maintenance is strictly speaking
only possible for the copyright holder of both the code and the
manual.

When a manual is not as tightly integrated with code as that, the GFDL
is not much of a problem.  Debian has recently voted "GFDL with no
front and back cover text and no invariant sections" as "free", so
that is not a problem.

It is inconvenient that this still considers the usual guidelines for
a GNU project documentation, something like one line of front cover
text and two lines of back cover text, unfree (instead of left to the
opinion of the package maintainer).  But that's Debian.

The GPL contains a clause that interactive programs need to announce
some stuff (unless the original didn't either), and I'd consider that
to be in the same ballpark.  Whatever.

I don't think there are many licensed intended predominantly for
documentation.  The advantage GFDL has over the GPL is that it is
feasible to distribute printed copies of the material.  GPLed
documentation does not allow circulation of printed copies without the
corresponding source code, or a written offer to it.

If the documentation is basically not of much interest in printed
form, that might be another option.

Of course, "free for all purposes" is also possible if one does not
mind somebody else putting this into software or hardcover in a form
which is not permitted to be further copied or redistributed.

    Creative Commons ShareAlike

I find the CC licenses extremely confusing, because there are so many of
them, and many of them are nonfree.  What does ShareAlike do?

My own preference these days is just to use the simplest thing possible,
because I'm just not concerned with someone else claiming the work as
their own.  It's never happened in 20+ years and I can't see it ever
happening (and if it does, I still don't care :).  That used to be
"public domain", but now I guess it is Frank's sentence.  (Sigh.)

However, I agree with whoever that GFDL with no Cover Texts or Invariant
Sections is still ok for standalone documents like the pdftex manual.
Everyone accepts it, and it is not a bad thing.  It is probably used
more than any other single doc license -- e.g., Wikipedia uses it.

Cheers,
karl

do what you want with the doc, but acknowledge source,
and the same licence must be used on derivatives. We use
it for all documents in OSS Watch (http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/).

I would say that CC is that. it has the same virtue as the GPL,
that its widely used and understood, and has lawyers to
help defend its status. It also has clear metadata
to attach.

Runs into the same problems as the GFDL when trying to share text

My whole problem with "CC" is shown by this sentence.  There *is* no one
CC.  There are tons of licenses promulgated by CC, all with very similar

That's not very fair. They started out on day one saying that
they would draw up a small number of separate licences,
and they have stuck to it. They are not all free, but that
was not a criterion for them.

I don't see an etex-based latex in the win32 binaries, but you could try
the same test with a plain document, e.g., 
  tex story \\bye
  etex story \\bye
  pdftex story \\bye

The multitude of extra system calls seem suspicious, as David said.
Offhand, I'd guess that it is searching a big directory on the physical
disk in one case and not the other, which is a function of the
configuration files and not the binaries.

    Is the TL2005 version generating DVI or PDF output by default? 

DVI.  The programs "latex", "tex", "etex", etc., have always generated
dvi by default, and always will (as far as I can imagine).  

    FWIW, my Dell machine

Indeed.  Also FWIW, on my various machines of various speeds, I have
seen no significant difference in runtime over the years.  It runs a lot
faster than I can edit, that's all I know :).

Frankly, for something like TeXlive, I don't see the point in having
PDFs instead of DVI.  Take up much more space (how many copied of
cmr10 do we want on the disk?) and are much slower to access.  TeXlive
has a viable and fast viewer for DVI, one could even set up the DVI
files to be compiled with source specials into the source tree, and if
any Type3 fonts happen to end up in the PDF, they are at fixed
resolution, whereas with DVI one still has a chance to render them
properly for the configured printer.

Hi Robin,

    shall i try asking?  

That would be great.

    if so, what exactly should i say?  

I think you should request that he use Frank's sentence 

  You may use, modify and/or distribute this file without restriction.

in preference to his various other versions at saying the same thing,
including the "public domain" statements, and inserting it into the
files where there is no statement.  Frank's original msg has the
specific file lists:
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/attachments/20060904/208886ad/attachment.mht
  

Also, it would be very desirable to fix the license on shapepar.sty and
varwidth.sty (assuming he wishes to do so).

However, it would probably be good to wait to ask him anything until
Frank confirms the above.

    i note (from working on context stuff for the catalogue) that
    there's an fsf page outlining pd -- i presume that's reliable, so i
    guess i should read it.

The FSF page doesn't talk about the concerns Frank has raised.
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#PublicDomainSoftware

There is a very long wikipedia page about it.  I got bogged down before
I could figure out if it said anything about our situation or not:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain

    there has been at least one attempt to explain the issue to knuth.  

Interesting.  But there are more important (IMHO) legal issues to ask
Knuth, like the strange license statement in tex.web vs. his statements
about TeX's legal status, etc.  Barbara has said that she has put this
on the list of things to bring up to him the next time he reviews TeX
"bugs".

    i think that, at the time, his world didn't encompass the concept
    people of ill will being involved with tex stuff (i wonder if the
    present increasing nastiness of the world at large has changed his
    mind?).
    
I don't see it as a matter of nastiness; I still haven't seen that
happen, in reality, but rather a matter of endless legal quibbling, ie,
free software/open source programmers having to turn into lawyers :(.
Which seems unavoidable.  All very depressing.

    don't know hobby.

I don't either, but as I recall, AT&T lawyers were involved in making MP
"public domain".  If that's so, I rather doubt it would be easy to change it.

Thanks,
Karl

The TeXLive 2005 and TeXLive 2003 have been installed on the same disk.
And the directory of TeXLive 2003 is much bigger than that of TeXLive 2005.

BTW, my machine:

Both TL system have a nearly same texmf-local. And the TL2003 have much

I have 512M RAM, and when I run those test, there are no additional program

It also depends on the terminal output, particularly on the size of the
xterm window (!), e. g. compare

$ time pdflatex yourfile.tex

with

$ time pdflatex yourfile.tex 2>&1 > /dev/null

Here it's e. g. (both TeX Live 2005)

real    0m1.561s
user    0m0.388s
sys     0m0.013s

vs.

real    0m0.403s
user    0m0.354s
sys     0m0.027s

So it's very critical to have exactly the same conditions for both
tests.

There's one mistake in the mail in that attachment:  shapepar.sty does
*not* have a non-commercial license.  Instead, it has a "public domain
but identify changes":

% Copyright (c) 1993,2002    Donald Arseneau
% These definitions may be freely transmitted, reproduced, or modified
% provided that any modifications are clearly identified and this notice

I think this is okay.

To me it seems not so problematic: According to
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf and the
Copyright notices of Volume B of C&T, tex.web is in the public domain,
but the name (of the file and of TeX) has a trademark-like protection.
The only problem is that newer versions of tex.web still have the
restrictive clause that we all know they have; but I would regard the
written text to be more important - after all the differences are only
patches which often are not only copyright by DEK.

Of course it would be desirable to replace the README by a reference to
C&T or the TUGboat article.

At least in the english version, there are some phrases that make Debian
folks uncomfortable (I hear the scottish version is okay, but then I
don't like the idea of having versions of a license for global
distributions that are not only translated to other languages, but also
jurisdictions - the scottish one is in english, too...).  But CC will
soon release a draft for a new version that addresses Debian folks'
concerns, at least so I have been told.

If that happens, this new version might be a better alternative than
GFDL without invariant sections, since it still has its flaws (overly
broad anti-DRM clause, etc.)

If we could agree on a convention for naming the documentation
files (so that they are not confused with the actual macro being
documented) then putting the source of the documentation out
there would be the best thing IMO. If an European puts documentation
out there it will likely be in an A paper size. An American will
use letter size. In either case it is an awkward size for
someone's printer.  Given the .tex version of the document one can
adjust one or two statements and get the correct size for local
printing. 

OTOH if you put a dvi out there then I must convert it to
to pdf in one or two steps and print it via Acrobat Reader, using the
"fit to paper size" feature. This shrinks the document which
makes it harder to read. (My eyes are old.)

I haven't tested it this AM but intuitively actual source would
be smaller than even dvi.

Well, TeXlive certainly comes with the documentation source.  What
isn't there is a system to access it, but the legibility of LaTeX
source would make that a mixed blessing without a special reader.

Having a more direct way of recompiling documentation might be nice.
I am rather sceptical, however, whether doing this on demand would be
good idea.  It would cause delays when you need the info fastest.

I don't see that this would be different with preprovided PDF files.

Depends on whether the source listing is included in the target file,
or just the documentation part.  For the CTAN browsing clientele, a
PDF without code listing is probably appropriate, for the installed
system, a DVI with code listing and maybe source specials.

The current one-size-fits-all is not really the most persuasive to me.
At one point of time, we'll have to come up with something less rare.

if only it were that simple: while there are those who would welcome a
common format for uploading packages, i am (still) regularly startled
by the variations that submitters manage to come up with, to confuse
us mere archivists (and in parallel, distribution managers).  the
latest witty twist is with heiko oberdiek's small packages that may in
principle be distributed just as .pdf files -- the .dtx source is
attached to the pdf.  

while it's true in principle that one could simply distribute source,
and let the user get on with creating their own documentation, i
can't imagine the average user will be happy with producing their own
documentation.

i don't understand your point here: sure, we oldies (and visually
disabled people such as my wife[*]) struggle with any documentation, and
any shrink we experience adds to our discomfort.  yet no-one suggests
that you may not recompile the sources, just that there's a simpler
route for those for whom it's appropriate.

mostly it is.  however, distributing compiled documentation is
inevitably an overhead by comparison with a source-only distribution.

To recompile the documentation the  documentation
source needs to be included with the package  and usually it isn't. With
the source the  visually impaired can take a further step and
change the font size. That is one of the great virtues of TeX. It
is possible to publish a document in many forms with minimal
changes. I am working today on a pamphlet which is 5.5 x 8.5 inch page
size. After I finish collating cover with text, stapling and
folding the thing I will take the same source and create a 8.5 x
11 pdf for online downloading. (The third version takes a bit
more work. It is plain text.) I use the Context \startmode
\stopmode convention but the same effect could be achieved with a
little more work in other forms of TeX.  But I digress as
usual...

Which if I understand you is precisely my point. Source is
smaller and allows the reader to customize the document to
his/her needs.

    And the directory of TeXLive 2003 is much bigger than that of TeXLive 2005.

That doesn't actually mean much, given ls-R files.  The question (well,
one question) is whether the configuration files are telling the
binaries to search the disk in the 05 case and not the 03 case.  You
might diff the texmf.cnf files and see if anything looks suspicious,
like a missing !!.  You might also run kpsewhich --debug story.tex (say)
and compare the output to see if there are major differences in what
gets searched.

If you are a glutton for punishment, you might try getting Akira's
current W32TeX binaries and see if they are better or worse.
http://www.fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp/kakuto/win32-ptex/web2c75-e.html

Anyway, all we can really do is randomly throw out wild guesses.  If you
want to actually find where the differences are, you'll need to run it
under some kind of profiling tool that can tell you which functions are
taking all the extra time.  (And I have no knowledge of profilers on
Windows.)

Regarding the various doc questions.

In the past, TL compiled its own dvi doc files.  TL now uses the pdf's
from CTAN.  For various reasons, this provides better results in many
cases, and takes much less effort on my part.  Thus, I have no time or
interest in doing anything else.

David, if you or anyone cares to take on the job of producing DVI doc
files with or without source specials, they could be perhaps be included
as well, or at least distributed from the web site.

As for doc file names, I fully agree that in many cases they could be
improved (manual.pdf??!!), and anyone who cares to take on the job of
talking to authors about it will have my appreciation, for whatever that
may be worth!

System calls can easily be tracked by running

That's OK by me. David, would you imagine that many users need to reed
the documentation *before* installing the whole stuff? pdf seems the
best for that.

Eh, well, providing that *all* dvi viewers can accept source specials
in the same manner (I've learned that "source specials" could be 
missuderdstood between different TeX distributions).

Ps. David, I really like your effort to the TeX community (not to mention
fine guitar playing and climbing the Bachotek hut :-), but would 
you please to stop any comments concerning Windows? That would be great
for us, as we (still well nondefined community) try to provide TL for
both worlds (including also damned Windows). Thanks for rething that...

Uh, we are talking about TeXlive here?  The DVD with a live TeX system
including viewers on it?  So why wouldn't they be able to read the
documentation before installing the whole stuff?

> pdf seems the best for that.

TeXlive contains DVI viewers.  It does not contain PDF viewers.  So I
really don't understand how you gather that the users will be able to
view PDF without problems, but not DVI, if what they have is a TeXlive
DVD.

We are not talking about different TeX distributions here but about
TeXlive.  So we need only worry about the viewers in that.

But not all of them support e.g. scaling and rotation. So some DVI documents 
(e.g. grfguide.dvi) wouldn't show the final result. Maybe transformation into 
PS or PDF could be done on the fly or at installation time or the user may be 
told to do it.

But some documents e.g. about font packages may even need non-free fonts. 
Because of this some documents need to be PS or PDF. Because of this DVI 
couldn't be the one and only used format. It only could be the prefered one.

OTOH, if you DON'T include compiled documentation then you have to
make double sure that the documentation will indeed compile on an
arbitrary system, which looks like a hassle to me.

most docs _will_ compile on arbitrary systems, but many offer barriers
to compilation (on any system).  hence my position: compiled docs are
a requirement in a distribution that's supposedly easy to use.

john's quote omitted that part of my argument.

the speed of a tex run under windows (but probably any system) is to 
some extend determined by the file lookup but after the first tex run 
file caching normally deals with that

fabrice has optimized his kpse driver to deal with the way windows deals 
with filenames (unicode) [since  the ls database is just a text file 
conversion needs to take place] / this is also related to sub-runs, like 
mp ones, which demand reloading of the kpse data, which is taken care of 
by shared memory mechanisms

personally i have not noticed a speed difference; factors that influence 
things are memory (pdftex may allocate more memory, macro packages may 
load more patterns, map file handling, 'tex' suffix appended lookup, 
etc); actually map file lookup has been improved much the last few 
years;  since pdftex uses some mem of itself, it may be that it crosses 
the system mem boundary and swapping starts taking place

I don't think error-prone stuff like that should be done at
documentation access time.

Wouldn't profiling the system calls under Unix suffice already for
figuring this out?  Or is it likely that the Windows port does its
work sufficiently different so that the results would not be
transferable?

I thought that in most respects, the Windows and Unix executables
should be compiled from the same source code, right?

As a ppoint of comparision, I ran "time latex sample2e" and "strace
latex sample2e"
on a Fedora Core 4 linux system (1.8Ghz P4) using a) standard tetex3
from the distro, b) my TL2005.5 testbed, which has several additional
texmf trees for testing
and pdftex-1.40.0-beta-20060906 (Web2C 7.5.5).  The binaries used for latex are:

The extra lines are due to RedHat's texmf.cnf listing some non-existent paths.
Maybe tetex3 would look faster using a properly configured texmf.cnf.

no, one reason for fabrice quitting the dev is that this was not the

i upgraded from 2003 to 2005, but unfortunately found that the CJK
processing no longer works.

when i run dvdipdfm on a CJK dvi file as usual,

$ dvipdfm wudi-res-zh.dvi

got the following error:

------------------------------

i do have a gbkkaisl42.tfm and kpsewhich can locate it, and i also
have gbkkai.afm and gbkkai.pfb.

it seems the ttf2pk can not find a font map file or the map file is
not correct. what map file it need and where should i put it?  can
anyone show me a clue to check?

thanks.

Even without changing the compiler flags, using different compilers,
options, runtime libraries, etc. can have a big impact.  In an earlier
post I compared TL2005 with
RH tetex3.  TL2005 is normally built with static libraries.
Relinking with all dynamic
(as was done for tetex3) gives run times only slightly longer than the
tetex3 times:

Fabrice put the kpathsea structures in shared memory so they didn't
have to be loaded again for each run.   TL2003/fptex sometimes asks
you to restart the programs after updating the texmf trees -- I don't
recall seeing this on TL2005 (Win32), but I also don't recall TL2005
on Win32 taking 7 s. to compile sample2e.
I doubt Fabrice's tweaks make that sort of difference.  My experience
has been that most programs have similar run times on linux and Win32
(but it generally takes considerably more effort to get things to work
properly on Win32).

Subject: [tex-live] missing fonts for 'texdoc TETEXDOC'
Message-ID: <4501C9CC.4060301@rpath.com>

I have an install that is pretty close to working.  And a glitch that 
makes me wonder.  I run
   texdoc TETEXDOC
I get successful handling of logo*, cmr*, and cmsy* fonts and failures 
for ec-lmt* and zppl* fonts.  texdoc ends up substituting cmr fonts for 
the missing ones, and the document displays quite legibly.

For example, zpplcmr.  A careful search of my texmf trees reveals
   texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts/alias/adobe/mathppl/zpplcmr.htf
(a very small and uninformative file) but no related .mf from which a 
.tfm or .pk might be generated.

A second example, ec-lmtt10, fails differently.  I find
   texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/lm/ec-lmtt10.tfm
but no .mf or .pk to go with it.

Am I looking at a failure of installation, or an old document that names 
forgotten fonts and is tolerated because it is still readable?

i just installed old pdftex-1.21a into TeX Live 2005, and there is also
pdftex-1.40.0-beta-20060906 in parallel. Here with debian sarge and

model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3700+
cpu MHz         : 2211.360
cache size      : 1024 KB
bogomips        : 4374.52

is result of compilation of the pdftex 1.40.0 sources:

$ time pdftex_121a pdftex-all.tex

real    0m5.229s
user    0m3.382s
sys     0m0.110s

$ time pdftex pdftex-all.tex

real    0m5.054s
user    0m3.219s
sys     0m0.106s

so there is no speed reduction for newer pdftex at all. This test is
with same compiler, same texmf.cnf, and the same TeX tree.

I installed TL-2003 on my 64 bit AMD machine.

The result is quite interesting:

TeXLive-2003 needs only

real    0m0.044s
user    0m0.036s
sys     0m0.004s

while TeXLive-2005 needs

real    0m0.177s
user    0m0.068s
sys     0m0.012s

Well, there are no 64 bit executables in TL-2003.  Hence I installed
the 32 bit binaries provided by TL-2005.  They are a little bit slower
than the 64 bit binaries but much slower than TL-2003.

real    0m0.183s
user    0m0.084s
sys     0m0.012s

But there is a significant difference between TL-2003 and TL-2005:

This is e-TeXk, Version 3.141592-2.1 (Web2C 7.5.2)
This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)

It seems that the point is that LaTeX provided by TL-2003 is based on
Knuth's TeX while it is based on PdfTeX in TL-2005.

I also tested it on my old machine with TL2005.

What I'm wondering is that I can compile the file on my 8-year old
machine (350 MHz and 256 MB) in less than 0.7s while Jinsong
needs more than 6 seconds.  If I recall correctly he has twice as much
memory.

  Reinhard

Well, in practice, any pdf viewer is already available for the users.
On the other hand, dvi previewers needs fonts to be installed
(or proper .map files available for the run). We can find more examples, 
where DVI could make some problems.

I'm not sure if "source special" is implemented for both previewers
(like xdvi and windvi). As for Windows, we are going perhaps to switch to 
dviout, nobody knows at the moment, but let me try to be 
optimistic... Please keep in mind, that I'm still trying to ride both

then see this comparison, all with TeX Live 2005, again with debian
sarge and this CPU:

model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3700+
cpu MHz         : 2211.382
cache size      : 1024 KB
bogomips        : 4374.52

now all in DVI mode:

$ time tex pdftex-all
This is TeXk, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)

real    0m2.941s
user    0m1.347s
sys     0m0.044s

$ time pdftex_121a pdftex-all
This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.3)

real    0m2.913s
user    0m1.417s
sys     0m0.038s

$ time pdftex pdftex-all
This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.0-beta-20060906 (Web2C 7.5.5)

real    0m2.955s
user    0m1.454s
sys     0m0.037s

Pretty much the same speed (which is the expected). So if TeX Live 2005
is slower than 2003 (which i don't have), it might be

* different compiler
* different TeX tree
* different kpathsea library (any changes in the hashing mechanism?)
* different X window size

Sure.  By magic.

The last time I looked, a TeXlive system had fonts installed.  Whether
you run it from DVD or from disk.  We can rely on the set included in
a minimal TeXlive installation.

Start by finding _one_ example.  We are talking about TeXlive.  And I
don't see how you can have a TeXlive installation without a minimal
set of fonts and a working DVI previewer either on hard disk or DVD.
Really.

Source specials don't jump out from the DVI file and attack the user
if they are not kept under control by the previewer.  They just get
ignored by a previewer that does not use them.

I really don't understand why you try bringing up Windows all of the
time.  It is a total red herring and has nothing to do whatsoever with
which format the documentation is in.

Is there a particular reason you bring it up at this time instead of
when it would have been relevant?

IIRC, I was not the one bringing up the OS debate, but rather someone
else was of the opinion that we should be bothered primarily to what
happens on Windows, the rest being unimportant.

I don't remember the details any more, and I don't think that it is
useful harping on three month old discussions.

IIRC there are no DVI-Viewers for MacOS. There is xdvi, but you need to 
install the X11 system to use it. Viewing PDF is supported by the OS.

Which are missing for at least one supported OS.

Yes, we can /rely/ on a /minimal/ installation.
But when I want to look at a package supplying special fonts, I have to 
install it first to view the dvi file. And I have to create the pk 
files, only to discover that they are not what I wanted.

Could we stop making up strawmen?  Nobody claimed that we should use
_only_ DVI files.  That was the point of using tools like pdffonts in
order to find out which files are safe, in a batched manner.

MikTeX 2.5 is using pdftex now.  If there were some basic problem with
pdftex there would be many complaints from people upgrading from 2.4.

6.95 s. is clearly way outside what would be expected, but I doubt we
can understand the problem without data from Win32 afflicted machines.
  A number of people have suggested tests (kpathsea debug settings,
tools from sysinternals, disabling AV scans), and these suggestions
are in the archive for any Win32 user who encounters the problem and
cares to provide data.

Which would be a large shortcoming.  There are quite a few things that
work _only_ via the DVI route, like PStricks.

TETEXDOC.tex uses palatcm.sty, which  uses old font names and seems to
have been classed as "non-free" (so probably isn't beign maintained).

You could use "mathpazo.sty", which gives:

PStricks doesn't even work with DVI, it requieres some kind of 
PostScript interpreter, thus providing a document that is using 
PStricks in DVI format is even less useful than providing one in DVI 
format generated by dvips/gs.

I don't think it is included in TeX Live but that wasn't the question, was  
it? It is freely available from

Thanks for the link nevertheless.

The next question is:
Why is TeXniscope not on CTAN?

why are so many things not on ctan?

author doesn't know about ctan.

author doesn't approve of ctan.

author can't be bothered.

the choice is yours.

we (the ctan team) do occasionally go chasing, but mostly we don't
have the time (or energy).   _you_ could usefully encourage the author
to submit it, if you felt like helping.

With Context PSTRicks and metapost are accommodated by multiple
passes.  Context is of course very slow as compared to other TeX versions
because of the multiple passes and voluminous messages. 

Getting back to the question of speed, perhaps pdftex without
etex should still be maintained, Right now pdftex is just a synonym for
pdfetex, which is not needed by most users. Without the etex
added pdftex would be smaller and presumably faster. 

Of course I would like to see a thing called "pstex" which went
from source to PostScript, but that is just a dream.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 2005 is slower than TeXLive2003
Message-ID: <357809850.10065@eyou.net>

Dear all,

I hope my question is only a special case.

I have install the TL2005 again, and now, it has a similar speed
compared with TL2003. I don't know why.

The previous version of TL2005 is installed from a the TL2005 Live DVD.
I just copy /bin, /texmf, /texmf-* and /xemtex to my disk and set proper
environment. It's seems ok, but has a very low speed. However, in the same
way, the TL2003 works well.

Now, I install the TL2005 from the TL2005 Live DVD using the provided installer,
and all seem works.

I compared the directory of both TL2005, and don't find any different.

I also install the following TeX distribution according to Karl's advice, http://www.fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp/kakuto/win32-ptex/web2c75-e.html
It's very fast. And I like the way of its installation.

It seems that the installer of TL2005 is too simple, and don't give enough
information to user.

Thanks to everyone who paid attention to my question.

Best regards,
Jinsong

Only the author knows for sure. But it seems unmaintained: The last
version is from 2004-12 and does not work on 10.2 (all taken from the

The size and speed differences should be negligible.  It is PDFTeX
that causes the speed bump, not eTeX.

My guess would be that the installer also puts something somewhere
which fixes the "HOME directory", and that in absence of that, your
installation searched the whole disk instead.

Uh, what?  Because it works better than a manual copying of the _live_
files, it is "too simple"?

Well, 10.2 is unmaintained as well. :-)

Most Mac users use TeXShop anyway, I only keep OzTeX around in case I 
need a DVI-viewer, but that is unmaintained as well.

So there is no maintained DVI-viewer for OSX (aside from XDVI)?

fyi: only as many passes as needed are used (mayeb it's more prominent because texexec takes care of additional passes when needed) 

concerning speed, there is also a relationship between what is loaded in the format and not; in that respect context has not become slower (actually faster) but this may not be true for other packages that e.g. load more patterns than in the past; it also depends on what font metrics are present in the format; in general, this makes it very hard not only to tell the speed difference between versions of tex the progranm, but also between versions of macropackages. my experience is that a small tex tree runs much faster; i also noticed that on an xfs filesystem (unix) tex runs faster 

speed remains a fuzzy area

LaTeX wants you to use eTeX, and so does ConTeXt, I think.
Don't tell me that doesn't cover "most users".....

I am not sure why a shell script called "pstex" which does
 1.TeX ->{dvi|pdf}
 2.{dvi|pdf}->PostScript
is really very different from a clone of pdftex
which generates PS.

Why you want PS, of course, is beyond me :-}

I installed the beta-test versions of TL2005 by copying a tree generated using
linux and the install CD (selecting multiple binaries for the various
platforms).
I recall some minor changes were needed in texmf.cnf for Win32.  The
Win32 installer replaces texm.cnf with a WIn32 version -- what does
the live DVD use?

Did you use the win32 version of texmf.cnf?   The original can be found at:

http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf-4WIN

I think the default version (e.g., used on linux) puts generated files
under $HOME/.texlive2005  (because some multi-user systems prohibit
users from writing outside their home directory).

I'm glad you found a way to get things working.  We still don't know
why your attempt to copy the live DVD failed, but since the same files
appear to work fine when installed using the GUI tool, we can rule
most of the possibilities, which leaves a kpathsea problem, which can
be checked using the built-in debugging options.

Maybe section 4.2 of the 'live' document needs some elaboration:

1.  indicate that "latex sample2e" should never take more than 1-2 s.
unless you are using an antique computer.

2.  mention the role of kpathsea and the debugging capabilities

Why? The eTeX don't make it noticably slower.

But if you want, go ahead. But the pdfTeX team won't do this.

This doesn't help very much unless you can tell the user what he
should do if it's too slow.  Compiling one file doesn't provide much
information.  You get more information if you compile a small *and* a
large file.  The small file will give you a hint how fast all the
auxiliary files are found and the large file provides more information
about the speed of the tex binary.

However, I don't think that it makes much sense to mention this in the
TeXLive documentation unless we can give clear instructions how to
solve such a problem.

  > 2.  mention the role of kpathsea and the debugging capabilities

The kpathsea documentation is already available in various formats in
TeXLive (info, pdf, html).

  Reinhard

Any reasonable system will almost certainly have a working PDF viewer.
 PDF viewers are useful to a much broader community than just TeX
users, so the TeX community doesn't need to be concerned with support.
  Fabrice (who has considerable frontline experience with TeX on
Win32) made the decision to drop dvi support in xemtex.   Many TeX
users have no need to work with .dvi files, and are not at all
hindered by lack of a DVI viewer.

At work, where Win32 is the "standard", every PC has Adobe Reader and
I rarely encounter problems (when XP was new, buggy video drivers did
cause rendering errors or even crashes viewing PDF's).  Users who are
new to TeX (many recent science PhD's never encountered TeX in school)
are accustomed to viewing documents with Adobe Reader.  Experienced
TeX on Windows  users expect a DVI viewer with the capabilities of
Y&Y's DVIwindo, are disappointed by the free tools, and end up using
PDF. Win32 DVI viewers have not been as reliable as Adobe Reader, and
have less "polished" interfaces (e.g., hyperlinking, bookmarks,
outline views, scripting).    Examples (ConTeXt, beamer, etc) that
might interest someone considering whether to invest the effort to
learn Tex do use these PDF capabilities.

ttf2pk.cfg is located in texmf/ttf2pk/; it loads ttfonts.map which sits
in fonts/map/ttf2pk/config/.

Either add your personal map file to ttf2pk.cfg or extend ttfonts.map.

thank you, after using dvipdfmx and did a lot of configuraion works, it works!

but  pdflatex and xdvi still have problems. it seemed both of them
caused kpathse to invoke mktexpk to create bit map fonts due to some
fonts can not be found,  such as

warning: gbksong42 at 720 can not be found
kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode  / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+120/600 --dip
720 gbksong42

i can find many gbksong42 in my system, so i can not understand what
fonts  were really missed and why mktexpk failed.

Hi.
  I continue to mantain TeXniscope. The site refers to the fact that  
it only works on >10.3 (so not on 10.2). The current released version  
is 0.3.4 which I admit is a bit old but no major bugs has been  
discovered and it is quite OK for day to day use. I've "unofficially"  
released a version 0.3.5 for which I provide only source files (major  
code reorg+ small bugs removed). Somebody reported to me that it  
compiles fine under Intel but due to imported libraries (and lack of  
time from my side) I still do not have a Universal version.

If you are interested in the sources for 0.3.5  you can find them here:

http://www.ing.unipi.it/~d9615/homepage/mac/TeXniscope-v0.3.5-src.tgz


Best regards,
Massimiliano Gubinelli

I surmise that the map files need to be updated to include those fonts
-- psfonts.map, pdftex.map, etc.  This means running updmap, but I don't
know the name of the CJK map file.  That is, assuming the CJK fonts are
available in Type1.  Werner?

    okay, can you tell me what things i should put into ttfonts.map? thanks.

ttfonts.map is for TrueType fonts.  

By the way, the .htf files you found are (no surprise) not real fonts.
They're used by the tex4ht program to make html/xml/etc.

Karl

    i installed texlive 2005 on Windows XP and by far found that the
    dvipdfmx is bugy while it is okay in my linux box.  it just can not
    run, and after i replaced it with another version from MikTex,
    everything seems okay.  does anyone know the reason?

What's included in TL05 is whatever dvipdfmx was current then.  I am not
surprised that things have been improved since then.  

Although, http://ftp.ktug.or.kr/KTUG/dvipdfmx/ doesn't seem to have a
newer release.  That's kind of odd; maybe I'm just missing it.  Be good
to ask the authors what the story is.

Hi Ken,

       texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts/alias/adobe/mathppl/zpplcmr.htf
    (a very small and uninformative file) 

The htf files are used only by the tex4ht program in producing
html/xml/etc. from .tex files.  They aren't the real fonts, as you know.

    but no related .mf from which a .tfm or .pk might be generated.

No .mf for zpplcmr (= palatino + computer modern, presumably the cm has
missing math symbols).  I believe it's implemented as a virtual font,
zpplcmr.vf.  Running vftovp should show the base fonts which are
actually used.  Sorry, I can't track it down now.

    A second example, ec-lmtt10, fails differently.  I find
       texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/lm/ec-lmtt10.tfm
    but no .mf or .pk to go with it.

ec-lmtt10.tfm (and indeed all the *-lm* tfm's) are mapped to Type1 fonts
in psfonts.map, et al.  The ec- prefix names the font encoding.  In this
case, it goes to lmtt10.pfb:

ec-lmtt10 LMTypewriter10-Regular "enclmec ReEncodeFont" <lm-ec.enc <lmtt10.pfb

    Am I looking at a failure of installation, 

If your psfonts.map is lacking the above line, and/or you do not
actually have lmtt10.pfb, that's an installation error (unless you
intentionally left out the LM (Latin Modern) fonts, which I would
definitely not recommend).  updmap should be run to install the
necessary map files.

    or an old document that names forgotten fonts and is tolerated
    because it is still readable?

I'm not sure if anything else has supplanted zpplcmr, but I suspect it's
still widely used.  ec-lmtt is relatively new (and recommended).

Best,
karl

As far as fonts are concerned, nonfree means that you are not allowed
to distribute the original fonts and/or you are not allowed to modify
them except for subsetting.

You are allowed to use them and give documents containing them away.
Critical are only documents which contain a complete font.

Of course, nobody would buy a font if the license does not allow him
to give a pdf file containing the font to someone else.

Unless I misunderstood this message I think that he means that ps/pdf
files can contain embedded subsets of fonts which cannot be freely
distributed.  The point is that that dvi files only contain references
to fonts but not subsets of the fonts themselves which means that the
complete fonts have to be provided by TeXLive which is impossible if
the license does not allow to distribute them freely.

I do not see any problems with ps/pdf files which contain embedded
subsets of such fonts.

For Unix, I simply haven't had time to integrate xpdf, and there is
no one else doing such things.

For Windows, there is no free (libre) PDF viewer, as far as I know -- if
anyone knows of one, I'd love to proved wrong!  I really wish a Windows
programmer would come forward to port gv or xpdf or whatever.  (The xpdf
backend stuff is ported, but not the actual viewer.)

i guess so.  just need to know what stuff need to put into what font
map.  i provided some info here:

in my fonts/map/dvipdfm/cid-x.map:

gbksong at UGBK@	UniGB-UCS2-H	:0:simsun.ttf
gbksongsl at UGBK@	UniGB-UCS2-H	:0:simsun.ttf -s .167
gbkkai at UGBK@	UniGB-UCS2-H	:0:simkai.ttf
gbkkaisl at UGBK@	UniGB-UCS2-H	:0:simkai.ttf -s .167
...

in my cjk.map

gbksong01 SimSun01 <gbksong01.pfb
gbksongsl01 SimSun01 " .167 SlantFont " < gbksong01.pfb
...
gbkkai01 KaiTi_GB231201 <gbkkai01.pfb
gbkkaisl01 KaiTi_GB231201 " .167 SlantFont " < gbkkai01.pfb
...

and, the 'find . -name "*.map" gives

./dvips/cjk.map
./dvipdfm/dvipdfmx/cid-x.map
./dvipdfm/gbkfs.map
./dvipdfm/cid-x.map
./dvipdfm/gbkhei.map

I think you might be surprised.  I have refrained from buying fonts in
the past for this reason [*], but friends and colleagues tend not to
understand me when I explain why.  The lack of awareness around
licensing issues is enormous.

[*] Don't ask which fonts.  I no longer remember.

"The Font Installation Guide" by Philipp Lehman comes to mind. IIRC the
sources are prepared for this document to be typset using different
fonts, but this would be a real pitty in this case.

IIRC one is not allowed to embed Thesis/The Sans into PDF files and
offer that file on a web page. Not even in subsetted form. And that
isn't a rarely used font.

this excludes all documents (samples) that explain how to deal with nonfree fonts (being 99.999 % of the fonts) which in turn makes tex less interesting

There will be a conference in Marrakesh, see
http://www.ucam.ac.ma/fssm/tug2006/. There will be a few lectures on
typesetting Arabic and since Persian (as well as Urdu and Farsi) use
Arabic script, you can probably reuse something.

There is a looong list of files on TeXLive which can't be properly
handled on MS-DOS (just run doschk) -- I don't talk about compressed
docs but TFM files and the like.  IIRC, there are similar file name
restrictions on CD-ROMs which don't run extensions like Joliet or Rock
Ridge -- is this a problem?

Curious.... this is a (bad) side-effect of the xu-hyphen "wrappers"  
that I have recently added for many pattern files. What puzzles me is  
why I didn't encounter this when testing them prior to adding to TL.

Anyhow, I have just committed a fix; please update to rev 2122 and  
see if this solves the issue for you.

Thanks, and apologies for the trouble.

I seriously doubt that 8.3 should be of any concern today. The only
filesytems for which this matters are
- FAT (DOS, which is long out of date),
- ISO 9660 level 1 (CDROM), for which various work-arounds exist, and
- ODS-? (RT-11/OpenVMS), for which newer versions exist.

the rt-11/rsx-11 file systems didn't last beyond vms v1.6 (which i was
using in something like 1978); it was labelled ods-1 when ods-2 was
introduced with vms v2.  things branded as "openvms" (hah!) may still
have the capability, but using it would be as daft as using dos fat on
win xp.

The file names on FAT are shortened and emTeX has several documented
strategies how to find the files if a long name is used in \input or
\usepackage.

Subject: [tex-live] failure to build mptopdf.fmt
Message-ID: <D7AF8F3C-B337-4FC0-A1FF-D9C8AFC54627@sil.org>

After the latest update to context/base/supp-pdf.tex in texlive, the  
mptopdf format will no longer build.

This is because it no longer loads supp-mis.tex, but the supp-mpe.tex  
module that is loaded after supp-pdf still requires this (and doesn't  
check or load it).

A simple patch to allow mptopdf.fmt to build would be:

Last time I looked there was not a reliable way in Linux to write
to a NFS partition. Hence those of us who run both OS' on one
computer tend to format the Windows partition using the older FAT
form. I know that there are extensions that purport to allow one
to write on a NSF partition from Linux, but I don't know how
reliable they are. Hence self-mounting Linux systems like Knoppix
and Slax mount such partitions read-only by default. 

Now how does this affect TeX? Well a good way to introduce the
newcomers to Open Source Software such as TeX is to provide them a
complete system on a cdr. That eliminates temporarily at least
the barrier of doing a TeX install. After they get over the
initial fear factor then they can proceed to do a normal install.
But TeX without the ability to save files is pretty useless. 

It is possible to package up a whole fistful of useful text
processing tools on a cdr without requiring the beginner to
download this, download that, download the other. Sebastian
Rahtz did this with a variant of the Knoppix distribution. If TeX
does not replenish its user base it will eventually disappear.
Already the use of TeX in academia is reported to be shrinking. 
The self-loading demo disk that can be used for real work is a
marketing tool we must be prepared to use. None of us are
immortal.

which will be fat-32, not dos fat.  fat-32 doesn't enforce dos fat's

so?  you've admitted that fat-32 on linux is usable (it has its
limitations, and it's said not to be as efficient under windows as is
ntfs, but it'll do for a start-up experiment.

I know it is slightly off topic but there is better solution than dual
boot --- free VMWare server. We have WinXP in our institute on a 2.7
GHz Pentium and even simple programs are slower than simple programs
in Linux on my ancient 150 MHz Pentium. Now I have 64bit 3.4 GHz
Pentium dual core with Linux as the only OS and WinXP running inside
VMWare server. It runs much faster, unlike on the computer in our
institute it does not take ages to open a PDF in Acrobat Reader. The
virtual machine has just 4 GB HD and I have Samba running in Linux so
that I can save files from WinXP to my Linux disk. I have VMWare
server also on my notebook with 1.6 GHz Pentium but without WinXP (I
have only 1 license for WinXP).

Anyway, live CD with just the most important packages would be a good
idea. Similarly, it might be useful to prepare so called virtual
appliance, i.e. an image of some Linux distribution with TeXLive
already installed which could be downloaded and run as a virtual
machine in VMWare. There are several appliances on www.vmware.com

Yes, and I failed to note that you were talking about the earlier
16 bit FAT, and not the newer 32 bit version. I was up late last
night (primary elections in Mayland.). Please ignore previous post.

modern Live Linux CDs use unionfs, to allow the appearance
of saving to disk.  more likely, you'd work with a USB pen

the practical problem is that TeX is

actually, it is "vfat" which is an extension to the FAT directory
format which allows to store (long) unicode filenames on the FAT
partition. the partition itself may be either FAT16 or FAT32 - it does
not matter: FAT16 differs from FAT32 only by the (maximum) number of
allowed clusters on the file system (2^16 in case of FAT16 and 2^32 in
case of FAT32); but both FAT16 and FAT32 can contain long filenames:
they won't be visible by legacy DOS versions, but will be visible
under windows95 and later versions (and on linux, of course, with
the "vfat" filesystem type).

Best,
v.

I can recommend debian etch, which provides TL2005, in a VMWare
player.  At work  (where Win32 is the "corporate standard") I use
VMWare player in Win XP on a 2Ghz P4 with 1G RAM and two disks (mostly
so the Windows paging file can be on a separate disk).   One of our
"mission critical" apps runs on Fedora Core, so I also have a VMWare
player running FC5 that gets TL2005 from an NFS share.  Clock time for
typical jobs is about 5x that of a native install, which gives me time
to read error messages before they fly off the top of the screen.

If you can't find a suitable appliance you can create one yourself using QEMU
to create the initial (empty) virtual disk file, or install debian
into another player's virtual disk.  For best performance, however,
you need to install VMWare modules for disk, network, and video  The
appliances I tried from www.vmware.com don't do this (I think it was
unclear whether the files could be distributed), but there are
instructions on the web.  The modules have to be rebuilt each time you
update the kernel, which is a bit of a nuisance.

This is beyond what can be expected from most Win32 users.   My
players have site-specific customizations, so are not suitable for use
outside my workplace.  The total size of the debian player files with
texlive, compilers, and a reasonable set of tools was about 7G last
time I checked, while my FC5 player has grown to 14GB.

I'm not sure if there is a need to distribute a VMWare player with TL
pre-loaded.   In my case, VMWare is necessary for a few specific apps
that don't run on Win32.  TL in linux is needed to build (literate)
programs and program documentation.     So linux in a VMWare player on
Win32 provides access to a toolset that includes TL as just one part
of the overall environment.

Looking at the single font name I suspect that font is accessed in GBK
encoding.  This means that there should be a font mapping file
(probably named gbksong.map) which contains the following:

  gbksong01 gbksong01 <gbksong01.pfb
  gbksong02 gbksong02 <gbksong02.pfb
  gbksong03 gbksong03 <gbksong03.pfb
  ...
  gbksong94 gbksong94 <gbksong94.pfb

(94 lines).  If you don't have this, create one.  A proper location in
the local TEXFM tree is

  fonts/map/dvips/gbksong/gbksong.map

Then, add a line

  Map gbksong.map

to web2c/updmap.cfg and rerun the updmap script.  Assuming that you've
also installed the TFM files properly, everything should work now.
Please don't install `enc' files for this font in case they have been
created.

>     okay, can you tell me what things i should put into ttfonts.map?

Assuming that you haven't created Type 1 subfonts with the
`subfonts.pe' script but used ttf2tfm to create TFM files (and you
really want to use pixel fonts instead of outline fonts), just use the
last line which ttf2tfm writes to the terminal.  It should look
something like this:

  gbksong at UGBK@  <your font name>

For direct use of TTFs with pdftex and dvipdfmx, please read
doc/latex/CJK/doc/pdfhowto/HOWTO.txt and follow the instructions.

This looks ok.  It maps the subfonts used in TeX back to the TTF.

Sorry for being a pain in the neck, but the issue about the generated

   texmf-dist/fonts/source/lh/lh-t2a/laliker.mf

must still exist, or TFM generation fails (like larm1000.tfm).

With other words, the files created by

Interesting. Is there a TeXLive available now (a beta perhaps)
that has some or all of the above updates but is in
either tarball or iso form? If so where exactly?

Thanks, I'll add this paragraph to my version too. BTW, it seems that
the TeXLive version is a rather old one from xdvik_22_40v; it also
contains a typo in the following lines:

% This file ps2pk.map which will automatically be updated by the `updmap'
% script.

The current one (from xdvik-22.84.10, unchanged from 22.84.9 which was
also in teTeX-3.0) can be found on:

http://xdvi.cvs.sourceforge.net/xdvi/xdvik/texk/xdvik/texmf/xdvi.cfg?revision=1.9.2.3&view=markup

One would probably need to update the comments about teTeX for
TeXLive, though ...

Kind regards,
Stefan

Window Languages appeared but under main window.
Move main window, you be able see hidden window.
You can download latest release tlpmgui without this annoyances from
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui
You need all files and folders and next run tlpmgui-1.xy.exe

WinEdt is not included on TeX Live (and never will be), because of its 
shareware status.
People are free to install any favourite text editor for their own.
We cannot force them to install any specific editor, anyway.
Please see The TeX Live Guide (live.pdf), page 17.

I did not intend to suggest that Winedt was on TeX-Live.  There was
(and still is, I suspect) confusion because WinEDT has an environment
variable "LaTeX-Help" which Alex says should point to the directory
containing LaTeX2e.chm.  My post was intended to point out only that
there was no LaTeX2e.chm on TeX-Live (2005).  Tomek ?uczak responded
that LaTeX2e.chm was a part of WinEDT, Alex which Alex vociferously
denied (see attached).  I think a part of the problem is that not all
have been cc'd on replies.

Message-ID: <4515601B.10407@univ-lille1.fr>

Hi Norbert, hi all!

I have switched from tetex to texlive in Debian testing and use now
the texlive debian packages instead of my TeXLive2005 distribution
(that I have kept aside to be able to check possible differences).

Everything works fine and smooth for me, thanks *a lot* to all of those 
who worked hard on this project!

Only Chinese (CJK in fact but I only use Chinese) support is missing: 
there is no `texlive-lang-cjk' package, I tried to install the following 
packages instead:
cjk-latex, gs-cjk-resource,  freetype1-tools (these are OK),
the TTF fonts:
xfonts-arphic-bkai00mp, xfonts-arphic-bsmi00lp,
xfonts-arphic-gbsn00lp, xfonts-arphic-gkai00mp (OK too),
but the corresponding tfm-arphic-* packages:
tfm-arphic-bkai00mp, tfm-arphic-bsmi00lp,
tfm-arphic-gbsn00lp and tfm-arphic-gkai00mp
require tetex and *not* texlive. It looks like an (easy to fix?) 
dependence problem in the tfm-arphic-* packages...

Are there plans to build a `texlive-lang-cjk' package which would 
install all the stuff needed to typeset CJK languages, including the 
standard (free) fonts and their map files?

Thanks again and best wishes,

There already exists a new latex-cjk package that is compatible with
both the teTeX and TeX Live packages in Debian. It hasn't been uploaded
yet, though. See als <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/377222>.

Hi all,

I would like to install a minimal TeX system on my computer, an intel
mac running OS X. What I had in mind was something to process plain
.tex files, and something to turn the resultant DVIs into PDFs. Also,
I suppose I might like to have to have some nice fonts like Computer
Modern, etc.

Can anyone point me in the right direction? It seems very hard to get
a working TeX without all the LaTeX stuff and a bunch of utilities.

Best Wishes,
Casey

you can compile it yourself, surely?  that way you could create
a distribution for the one or two people a year who ask for a
plain-only distribution.  (speaking as a ctan maintainer, i can assure
you we would be happy to serve such a distribution for you.)

failing that, why not install a complete thing and delete the stuff
you don't want?

Last time I looked the TeX Live installer did not force you to install

    Subject: [tex-live] How do I know svn has worked if I get this output?

Indeed, I think it didn't work.  You can check by comparing your files
in the given directory to the online stuff at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive (or rsync yourself a copy).

    svn: Can't copy  
    'Master/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pstricks/.svn/text-base/CHANGES.svn- 
    base' to  
    'Master/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pstricks/.svn/tmp/text-base/CHANGES.svn- 
    base.tmp': No such file or directory

I assume the line breaks are email artifacts.  This seems like something
went wrong in the SVN directories -- perhaps an empty directory got
removed (outside of svn)?  I have had that issue before, but I've never
seen svn itself corrupt its files.

Hmm.  Perhaps the easiest way to recover is to rm -rf
doc/generic/pstricks and then svn update it again.  At least, I think
that should work.

Sorry,
k

Hi Casey,

    What I had in mind was something to process plain
    .tex files, and something to turn the resultant DVIs into PDFs. 

The extended TeX called pdftex will produce pdf's directly, instead of
DVI.  (pdftex has been around a long time.)

    I suppose I might like to have to have some nice fonts like Computer
    Modern, etc.

Indeed, it would not be possible to typeset anything without fonts :).

    Can anyone point me in the right direction? 

One way is to run the TL cmdline installer install-tl.sh (it should work
on macosx, just be sure it uses bash).

Then use the s command to change the scheme.  Set it to scheme-basic.

Then use the c command to change collections.  Deselect
collection-latex, leavin just collection-basic.

Then use the p command to change packages.  Deselect everything you
don't want.

Then i to install (after making any changes to paths, options, etc.),
and should have a non-latex installation.

As suggested, I imagine it is possible to do something more or less
equivalent with i-Installer, then deselecting all the latex packages,
but I don't know details.

Hope this helps,
karl

If you use pdfTeX to generate PDFs, you don't actually need any pfbs,
if you use just the default PDF fonts like Times and don't embed them.

Message-ID: <17687.8554.789743.282022@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
I'm wondering which texmf tree I should use.

The most up-to-date one is Build/source/inst/texmf but unfortunately
it doesn't provide updmap.cfg.

There is an updmap.cfg in Master/texmf/web2c.

If I use Master/texmf instead of Build/source/inst/texmf it's very
likely that I miss other things which are generated by the build
process.

Or should I put both directories into TEXMFMAIN?


Master/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg contains an entry

   Map proto10.map

but proto10.map doesn't exist.  Are the archaic fonts incomplete?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Pdftex lets you go directly to pdf -- do you really need .dvi files?

You might consider adapting the minimal ConTeXt to you needs:

http://www.pragma-ade.com/context/install/macosxtex.zip

I'm not sure if this has universal binaries -- if not they must be
coming "real soon now".   There will be a texmf tree and some ruby and
perl scripts you don't need, but
the system is all contained in a single directory so it should be a
good starting point for your own "minimal" distribution.

Alternatively there is a minimal Context distro available. It has
executables for pdfetex and Context (actually texexec) but not
tex, Latex or pdflatex.  For most purposes pdfetex can be used
instead of plain tex. It is essentially a superset of plain tex. 

It comes in two zip files, For my Linux system the two zips are
justtex.zip & linuxtex.zip.  You would need the macosxtex.zip
instead of the linux file. 

The two zip files total about 70 MB. Expanded they occupy about
180 MB. You could still do significant pruning as Robin suggests. 

Visit 
http://www.pragma-ade.nl/download-1.htm
for the downloads. 

The Texlive distro is much bulkier (a full cdr) but the install
script allows you to pick and choose what you want to install.

Subject: [tex-live] texmf and updmap
In-Reply-To: <17687.8554.789743.282022@zarniwoop.ms25.local>
Message-ID: <200609252226.k8PMQQ408846@f7.net>

    I'm wondering which texmf tree I should use.

Master/texmf.

    The most up-to-date one is Build/source/inst/texmf 

That's created by the make install in the Build script.  It's not part
of the repository.  Build/source/inst is essentially just a staging
directory.

    If I use Master/texmf instead of Build/source/inst/texmf it's very
    likely that I miss other things which are generated by the build
    process.

Everything needed to run should be in Master/texmf, because that is what
eventually gets distributed.  Unfortunately the process of updating (or
even checking) Master/texmf from the make install to inst/texmf is not
automated.  I would very much welcome help (scripts, volunteers, ...) in
this regard :).

    Or should I put both directories into TEXMFMAIN?

It shouldn't be necessary to change TEXMFMAIN (or anything else) from
the version in the repo.

    but proto10.map doesn't exist.  Are the archaic fonts incomplete?

I updated from a new release of archaic, and Peter provides an "all in
one" map file now.  I haven't done the rebuild which updates updmap.cfg
(not to mention psfonts.map, pdftex.map, etc.) yet.  Another thing I'd
be glad to have help with.  I've written some scripts, but I don't trust
them enough to automate the entire thing at this point.

Thanks,
k

    Does anybody know where to report this bug? 

Well, the place to report LaTeX bugs is the LaTeX bugs database,
linked on latex-project.org.

    It seems there is an error in the LaTeX release of earlier this
    year.

My recollection is that dvipdfm.def is not (any longer?) part of LaTeX,
i.e., not generated by graphics-drivers.ins.  I wrote a message about
the confusing situation vis-a-vis the <driver>.def files a little while
ago (met with deafening silence).  So maybe the bug is not in LaTeX?

The dvipdfm.def in TL is dated 1999/9/6, FWIW.

It is part of the graphics-tds.zip I downloaded earlier this year (in  
tex/latex/graphics) so the bug was in LaTeX but I haven't downloaded  
for a while.

    this is a graphics-tds from texlive

There is no "graphics-tds" per se in TL, either.  I assume Gerben means
the graphics from Heikos' tdsified LaTeX.

And yes, I believe that .def removal was a change in August sometime
(for Heiko's pkg, not original latex).  In any case, that's when it
trickled down to me -- I sent my earlier msg about the .def files on 23aug.

this is a graphics-tds from texlive?  latex distributes no such thing
(and never has).

if it had the 2005-12-01 latex in it, it's buggy.  if it had an
earlier latex in it, it was just out of date.

except that there is no dvipdfm.def in latex graphics release any more
(see the ltnews17 that came with the latest release, iirc)

it's nothing to do with latex, honest.

we couldn't hope to maintain drivers in the distribution, and so we
made a public announcement that we wouldn't.

Hi,
I noticed that updmap is in bin-tetex while updmap-sys is in
bin-kpathsea. IIRC updmap-sys is just a wrapper of updmap. So should
updmap-sys belong to bin-tetex instead of bin-kpathsea?
The same situation is applied for fmtutil (fmtutil, fmt-util.1and
fmt-util-sys.1 are in bin-tetex while fmtutil.cnf, fmtutil.cnf.5,
fmtutil.8 and fmtutil-sys are in bin-kpathsea)

This one was always a mess. In our repository it only exists as this file  
and we have no access to the source files listed:

%% textures.dtx  (with options: `copyright')
%% AI3_Crops.dtx  (with options: `copyright')
%% portable.dtx  (with options: `copyright')
%% textures.dtx  (with options: `banner,Textures')

%% portable.dtx  (with options:  
`Textures,supportsEPS,AlwaysReadFile,color2')
%% textures.dtx  (with options: `TexturesRules,')

This file is 1997/5/28 v0.3 and this is the latest to be distributed with  
Textures according to the reports I got from users.

I'll see if I can get in touch with the guys at BlueSky.

Yeah, we probably won't see any new releases of that. The one you have is  
this one, right?

Similar to textures.def. The version available on ctan in the archive

I didn't expect the Debian upload to be so slow.  That's why I didn't
update the Alioth repository.  But I'll upload the new CJK packages
to Alioth (same as in the NEW queue ATM) as well ASAP, which fixes the
Thai fonts.

There are several texlive-lang-* packages.  Should I also create a
virtual package called "texlive-lang-cjk"?

No I'm not subscribed to the Debian TeX Maintainers mailing list.  I'd
hoped my new ISP's newsserver would include the newsgroup
linux.debian.maint.tex, but apparently it doesn't exist.

I guess so.  I'll make the changes.  Thanks.

Returning to an old thread....

In the (normal) case where srcdir != builddir, the second line here  
causes a disconcerting (though harmless) message to be generated  
during the configure process:

     ../configure: line 1: cd: utils/sam2p: No such file or directory

This occurs because the build directory utils/sam2p has not actually  
been created at the time the configure script does this test, so the  
cd fails (and $dir2 ends up as an empty string).

IMO, it would be good to suppress this (if only because it may  
needlessly alarm people). I'd like to suggest we change this line to  
read:

     dir2=`cd utils/sam2p 2>/dev/null && /bin/pwd`

Or are there portability (or other) reasons why this would be a bad  
idea?

Agreed.

Sounds fine to me.  Please install it.

Thanks for the report. It builds OK for me on a couple of Linux  
systems, but I'm not surprised if there are some configure issues  
still to sort out.

My first guess is that you don't have fontconfig (or the fontconfig  
headers) installed, and xdvipdfmx doesn't build correctly without  
them. If you can install fontconfig-dev or whatever is equivalent for  
your Linux system, you could confirm whether this is the issue. (If  
I'm right, then obviously configure needs to check this better.)

Anyhow, I'll try to look into this. I've been wondering whether we  
should attempt a static build of fontconfig within TL, to avoid the  
dependency... but it's unclear whether this would work if the distro  
is using a customized FC configuration.

(The build should support a --without-xdvipdfmx option, if you want  
to build everything else for now.)

Subject: [tex-live] About SVN speed issues
Message-ID: <87k63lmlf0.fsf@florent.maison>

Hi,

While upgrading my Debian unstable chroot, I noticed this:

  Subversion 1.4.0 will SILENTLY UPGRADE the format of any working copy
  it touches.  Thereafter, you won't be able to use earlier Subversion
  releases with the same working copy.  The good news is that this new
  format is much more efficient than the old; you should notice a
  respectable speed increase for operations such as 'svn status',
  especially with large checkouts.

  1.4.0 also brings an incompatible enhancement (known as 'svndiff1') to
  the repository storage format, reducing disk usage by something like
  30%.  However, this ONLY affects new repositories, created with svnadmin
  1.4.  Existing repositories will continue to use the old format.  If you
  want to take advantage of svndiff1, dump and reload your repositories.

Maybe this could help you?

Note that the first paragraph is about an improvement for people running
a recent SVN on the *client* side.

Hi Florent,

    Maybe this could help you?

Looks like it, very much, although I might wait until 1.4.1 to switch
the repository :).  I trust the new svndiff1 repositories can
interoperate with 1.3 and earlier clients?  (I looked around a little
but didn't quickly see the answer.  If you don't either, that's ok.)

Thanks,
Karl

I really don't know more than the small message I forwarded to the list,
but I would be very surprised if the new repositories didn't
interoperate with earlier clients.

So it would seem.

    should attempt a static build of fontconfig within TL, to avoid the  

I think "we" should (ie, you :), if you can find the time).  For all the
same reasons that we include all the other libraries.

    but it's unclear whether this would work if the distro  
    is using a customized FC configuration.

Can "we" (again, ie, you :) try an experiment along those lines?  Write
to some FC mailing list for advice?  Ask other people to try some test
binaries?  I dunno ...

I've never looked at FC myself, at all, so I'm just shooting in the
dark, sorry ...

Thanks much,
k
