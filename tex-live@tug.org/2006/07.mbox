No. This is not the current trend is business. I know that people here
will have reluctance to that, but the MS strategy is to sell packaged
stuff, from the pda to the multimedia box for home cinema or the cash
machine.

And MS want it but mass market consumers want it too. They want to plug their digital
camera onto their multimedia box and watch the slideshow. They want to
play games the same way they do on a Playstation. Etc. They want to read
and send their emails on their (preferably HD, plasma or lcd) tv set.

They don't want to be bothered with directories, command line arguments
or whatever.

This is the thing behind preinstalled OS. And from a pragmatic point of
view, I don't see any problem in selling PCs with preinstalled OS.

Try to imagine your (well recent) car sold without any software ? Do you
think people would be foolish enough to buy it ? Or your mobile
phone. Or your watch. Or etc.

This is the main reason why I think that the only real answer to a
commercial company is another commercial company and not the current
various open source and anarchical models.

Sorry for the delayed response, but I followed your advice and chose the first work-around to the installation problem. After logging in as root, I modified my PATH so that GNU tar would be found first. The installation then completed without any problems. This is a nice, simple work-around. Thanks for all the research on this. It may be useful to add a note about installation on Solaris to the "TeX Live 2005 - bugs and updates" web page at http://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html, for other Solaris users who may encounter this problem.

Well, since day 1, the GPL has always had the possibility of "offering"
to distribute the sources in lieu of actually distributing them.  The
exact method is not specified.  A url seems fine to me as one
possibility.  The main point is that if someone asks for the sources,
you have to produce them, for up to three years after your binary
distribution.

It is much better and simpler to actually distribute the sources in the
first place, and that is what we do, and that is what I think we should
continue to do.

To everyone involved in the UNIX vs. MS discussion:

tex-live at tug.org list has been created for the discussion of the
development issues of the TeX Live. However, this list is *not* a forum
for UNIX vs. MS flame postings. Please respect this.

We all (I assume) want TeXLive to provide support for both Unix and MS
platforms. But if all you want is to discuss which system(s) are best
and why, then please try another mailing list - gmane or google should
give you ideas about suitable alternatives.

Yes, but an url is not enough for GLP2.

Uh what?

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

"On a medium customarily used for software interchange".  A URL is not
such a medium.  And calling an ftp or http server a medium might be a
bit of a stretch.

Anyway, any offer under 3b has to be a _written_ offer.  That's not
something we can do for a CD image.

Agreed.  A duty to be three years around and send stuff "at cost" is
just impractical.

Yes, and they propagate viruses because they do not distinguish
between opening a file and executing a program, they attach huge
jpeg's to mails (size doesn't matter, they don't even know how large
the file is), they convert vector graphics to jpeg (because they have
heard that jpeg provides compression) before they attach them to
mails, they send mails as html requiring fonts which nobody has on his
system, they attach word documents, assuming that everybody has the
fonts they use...

It would be better indeed if windows users know a bit more about what
they are doing.

I'm amazed that Windows still hides file-name extensions by default.
This "feature" had been responsible for propagating the I_LOVE_YOU
virus some years ago.  The name of the attached file was
LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs .

It's also amazing to see how easy it is today to write a virus.  A few
years ago writing a virus had been a real challange.  Everything had
to fit into the boot sector of a floppy disk.  Today it's sufficient
to attatch a BASIC script to a mail and simply ask people to execute
it.

Fabrice, if you think that it is appropriate to compare Windows users
with people whose purpose of life is watching football matches, I
don't disagree generally.

However, if we are talking about TeXLive, I think that the situation
is a bit different.  I cannot imagine that someone who uses TeXLive
under Windows ist *that* stupid.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Many people I know are complaining that it is impossible to buy a
mobile phone today which is just a mobile phone.  There are no mobile
phones which only provide the functionality of a mobile phone today.
People have to pay for features they don't need.  There is a big
market for mobile phones which are just mobile phones.  

  > Or your watch.

It seems that the discussion becomes quite bizarre now so that it is
better to stop it.  If you really think that you need a watch which
requires to install a Microsoft service pack twice a year, be happy
with it but don't try to convince other people that this is a good
thing.  Nobody is interested in such a shit.

I'm glad to have a watch which is not infected by Microsoft and it
still works.  I can even switch to another time zone without rebooting
the system.

  Reinhard

Well, I don't want to be bothered by the clutch and the turning
signals and the steering wheel or the road rules while driving. And I
want to just be able to grab a gun and go shooting.

So what?

I do. First of all, because de facto it means I can't choose what I
want to install and not. Secondly because, as I said, giving the
*illusion* that it's easier doesn't help: it actually makes thing
worse.

BTW, if it was all about ease of use, how comes people used DOS when
Apple had a GUI?

I have never said that I feel good with many implications of this. I'm
just trying to explain that many people here don't seem to live in the
real world.

There is no reason that in the future hardware and software not be
merged. Evolution of technology tend to produce new objects with
identified function(s). You have been used to a programmable
computer. Our kids will be used to computers designed for a couple of
uses, possibly configurable but definitely not used to program them in
the same way you did.

And I think that my point  about the MS being a commercial company has
not been understood.

This point about learning the command line to do any job (or learning TeX to
typeset documents). You think that people are clever, so can understand
that easily (well, understand maybe, easily I'm not so sure). So
Microsoft is making people more idiot than they should be because MS is
providing them with tools that don't exercise their intelligence.

But this is the same thing everywhere. Look at the blockbusters at the
movies. Most of them are insipid, when they do not propagate very mean
ideas. But most people go and watch it. They buy it on DVD. And so
on. Whereas valuable movies remains unknown to the vast majority. Why ?
Because those blockbusters allow you to watch something by being
passive. You only have reactions (to explosions or whatever). You don't
have to think. Whereas more confidential movies require you to think. 

I don't see why commercial software should escape this scheme. If you
people can do something without having to think how it works, they will
do.

As I see it this is the real mechanism behind this anti-ms behaviour.

Have a nice week-end all of you,

Fabrice

How about actually reading the mails you reply to?  He already explained

My understanding is that simple redistribution of untouched
binaries _still_ carries with it the obligation to supply source.

The law (I am talking about the UK here) is not entirely clear
about distinguishing between the postman  who delivers
a CD to me (who is a mere agent), and TUG which prepares
the CD distribution. But in the recent hoo-ha over Mepis
most legal experts seemed to agree that making up a CD
of software, choosing what to put on it, adding documentation
etc, constitutes a redistribution. You cannot say "oh just
get it from the source I got it from".

I speak with some shame here, since I have for several
years prepared CD distributions of Linux (remastered
Knoppix etc), and failed to meet the conditions.

Of course, I am not a lawyer; but we did consult
one of Oxford University's lawyers about this a few days
ago (after the Mepis news), so hopefully I am not
totally blathering.

Neither about OS flamewar, but about user's behaviour, which is, as I

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0607011827270.15941-100000@beba.cesnet.cz>

Hello,
as you could read from the TUG 2006 conference web page at
http://www.ucam.ac.ma/fssm/tug2006/, I plan to present a lecture on babel
support for Hindi. The language definition file successfully grows in my
home computer. It strongly depends on the Velthuis Devanagari for TeX
(preprocessor, macros, fonts). Since Velthuis Devanagari is distributed
with TeX Live as well as MiKTeX, I would be happy if the Hindi language
could also be automaticaly included in babel. I would therefore like to
know where and how I should submit hindi.dtx and patches to language.dat,
babel.ins and other files. I would like to keep maintenance of hindi.dtx
so some mechanism of proper transfer to standard mechanism should be
established.

The Velthuis Devanagari is being developed on CVS at sarovar.org. Is it a
good idea to create directory velthuis/tex/generic/babel/velthuis there
and put hindi.dtx into it?

Velthuis Devanagari v2.14 contains definitions which may conflict with
babel. Version without conflicts is currently available from CVS only and
will be released before I am satisfied with hindi.dtx. There are no
changes in the preprocessor, only several macros are implemented in a
different way. No changes in existing files will be needed.

I can't see how it's relevant.  And there have been postings that pose
some clearly phrased questions that can be discussed, answered or
re-phrased;  this subthread however is not targetted at any goal, it
seems.

I think that this problem is independent of the operating system.  The
problem is simply that a filename is just a sequence of bytes and a
program has to guess which encoding vector is appropriate.

hm, i more get the impression that people (kids) don't want that kind of 
training, they just want to get started and learn while doing. Many 
programs (as well windows as a whole, or a fresh linux destop) does 
offer those 'introduction' and 'tips' things but how many (new) users  
take the time to  follow the learning  route

there was a time that when you installed a new version of an os, reading 
a few pages could bring you up to date, that time has gone

the same is true for tex, when there were hardly any options (macro 
packages, fonts, styles) live was simple and there was only one way to 
go (resulting in all docs produced by tex look the same)

nowadays a user sees someone else's more advanced document and want to 
do the same, directly; there ar ewiki's, mailing lists, examples etc and 
there is no real need to first go through a long learning process;

as a side effect, in the beginning of tex, people wrote introductions, 
articles etc, but less and less now; the longer a mailing list is 
around, the more expert the average crows gets;  every new tex user 
immediately becomes part of the group of advanced users

look back at the last 20 years and then extrapolate to 20 years from 
now: our current operating systems (and discussions) will look silly and 
dark age; and tex ... maybe we have realtime rendering all around and 
deal with information in completely new ways; just as many kids will not 
recognize the thashcan ice on as representing a can, they may no longer 
think of files and systems. (btw, does your computer's desnk top look 
like your desktop?)

it would be an interesting exercise to extrapolate what tex live 2020 
should look like, because we may need some time to get that done; 
operating systems have come and gone then, and we may even face 
ourselves (tex users) with extinction; and think of 2040 when someone 
has to come by and install your computer ... (with or without tex)

hm, i occasionally use manpages (but more often print manuals) of 
progs;  i must admit that i don't even know how to make man pages

the problem is that once i start writing man pages (that i don;t use 
myself) others will ask for windows or mac help files ... i'd rather 
spend time on the manuals themselves
> In general, I would like to see man pages for *all* binaries included

i happily leave that to users; technically it should be possible to process a manual source (to say mptopdf) so that it produces a man page but not all manuals have the same structure (which means that i'd have to write additional styles); maybe 

 pdftotext somemanual.pdf somemanual.man 

is enough. 

As said, i happily leave creating man pages to users so I cc to the context list.

Very nice!  It contains a lot of typographical buglets -- and a main
one, namely that `mptopdf' isn't mentioned at all.

I'll fix these and send it to this list so that it can be included in
TeXLive, ConTeXt, and Debian.

Yes, it seems someone just decided to symlink mptopdf.1.gz to
texexec.1.gz...

Thank you very much.  The original is in 

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/doc/man/man1/

where you can also find some more manpages, e.g. for texfind and
texshow, a very rudimentary one for fdf2tex/tan, etc.

There are books for educators that discuss the different approaches to
learning between the generation of college teachers and college
students.  For many students, most of their computer experience has
been with gaming, which encourages "risk-free" experimentation in a
"world" where the possibilities can be enumerated using a small
integer.  Educators (and people trying to make TeX accessible to a
wide audience) need to recognize the different approaches to learning.

No -- my desk has many layers of paper (papers waiting to be entered
in bibtex and filed, scribbled notes on the backside of old printouts,
flyers, etc.) that I would recycle if the bin wasn't already
overflowing.  I keep the computer's desktop neat because the capacity
to file or delete stuff doesn't require heavy lifting and can be done
while waiting for TeX runs.

TeX will evolve in ways that are difficult to predict or understand --
some ideas (think pdftex) will prosper.  Others (think of my poor
colleage used Y&Y TeX for a book, only to discover that figures which
worked using dvipsone weren't acceptable to dvips) will die out.  I
expect future math typesetting systems will be better integrated with
applications (symbolic maths, stats, etc.) and will automate the
processing steps (latex, bibtex, latex, ...).  ConTeXt gets many of
these right, so in my opion a TeX system that doesn't properly support
ConTeXt is badly broken.

I do hope literate programming will be rediscovered at some point.

In the future I expect to see TeX better integrated with other
applications.  This implies more reliance on system-specific font
configuration (Y&Y, xetex), and much more reliance on the use of 3rd
party languages and GUI tools.  The danger is that incompatible
systems will evolve from TeX on each mainstream platform.

Uh, oh, this man page doesn't handle mptopdf at all...

Do you have something better?

.SH SYNOPSIS
.
\fBtexexec\fP [\ \fIOPTION\fP .\|.\|.\ ] \fIFILE\fP [\ .\|.\|.\ ]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B \%texexec
is a Perl script that provides several functions:
.
.IP o
Process a TeX file.
This includes performing as many runs as necessary of 
.BR tex (1),
.BR texutil (1),
and
.BR metapost (1).
Options allow you to select the output format, the pages to process, paper
size, and so forth.
.
.IP o
Create new ConTeXt formats (with
.BR \-\-format ).
.
.IP o
Post-process existing PDF files, including merging multiple files, and
extracting and rearranging pages within a file, similar to the functions
provided by
.BR psnup (1)
and
.BR pdfmerge (1).
.
.IP o
Extract or strip documentation from ConTeXt source files, using
.BR texutil (1).
.
.IP o
Run METAPOST to generate figures from METAPOST source files.

.SH OPTIONS
.
In this man page, all switches are specified in full, but they can be
abbreviated to the shortest unique string.
Thus,
.B \-\-ver
works the same as
.BR \-\-verbose .
.
.SS "General Options"
.
.TP
.B \-\-alone
Avoid calling other programs if possible.
For example,
.B \-\-alone
prevents

.
.IP
For example, the
.B MikTeX
TeX system (for DOS/Windows) can embed information in the DVI file
that allows you to find the line in a source code file corresponding
to the line in the typeset output.
It uses a switch called `\-\-src' to activate this functionality,
and can be used from
.B \%texexec
as
.
.EX
\f(CWtexexec \-\-passon="\-\-src" somefile\fP
.EE

The actual layout of the pages is specified with the
.B \-\-print
switch.
.
.TP
.B \-\-pdf
Shorthand for
.RB ` \-\-output=pdftex '.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-print= KEY
Specify the layout of the final output.
.I KEY
can be
.BR up ,
resulting in two pages per sheet, double sided, or
.BR down ,
resulting in two rotated pages per sheet, double sided.
Use the

switch to specify the original page and sheet size.
.
.
.SS "Creating \fBConTeXt\fP Format Files"
.
.TP
.BI \-\-format= FORMATFILE
Specify a format file for typesetting.
.B \%texexec
prepends the string `\f(CWcont\-\fP' to the name you give, so you can type

.TP
.BI \-\-textwidth= WIDTH
Set the width of the original text.
Specifying this parameter with a single-sided original allows
.B ConTeXt
to adjust the page layout for double-sided output, producing much more
attractive results.
.
.IP
With the
.B \%\-\-pdfarrange
flag, specifying more than one file results in all of the files being
combined in the final result, allowing you to add title pages, decorated
part separators, and so forth.
.IP
You can also do more complex manipulations, such as adding additional text
to the page by setting up a small file with layout definitions and a simple

.B \%texexec
uses
.BR \%texutil (1)
to obtain the list of figures to process.
.
.
.SH "USAGE"
.
.IP o
Each
.B ConTeXt
user interface (language) has its own format.
The following command generates two formats, one using the English interface
for typesetting in English, and one for Dutch:
.
.EX
texexec --make en nl
.EE
.
.IP
By default, the language used for typesetting matches the user-interface
language (set with
.BR \%\-\-interface ).
It is possible to use one language for typesetting and another for messages
by changing the relevant settings in
.IR \%cont\-usr.tex ,
but these languages can also be changed on the command line with a command
such as
.
.EX
texexec --make --language=pl,cz,sk --bodyfont=plr en
.EE
.
.IP
That command generates a
.B ConTeXt
format file with an English user interface, and the main language set to
Polish
.RB ( pl ).
The default body font is the Polish version of Computer Modern Roman
.RB ( plr ).
Czech and Slovak hyphenation patterns are also loaded so that Czech and
Slovak text included in a source file are typeset properly
.RB ( cz
and
.BR sk ).
.
.IP o
When the appropriate formats are present, a file can be typeset by typing
.
.EX
texexec test
.EE
.
.IP
.B \%texexec
tries to determine what interface it should use to typeset
.I \%test.tex
by looking for a line such as
.
.EX
% interface=en tex=pdfetex output=pdftex
.EE
.
.IP
at the top of the file (i.e., on the very first line).
This line is equivalent to
.BR TeX 's
format line,
.RI ` FORMAT ').
.
.IP
By default,
.B \%texexec
produces a DVI file.
The
.B \-\-pdf
flag tells
.B \%texexec
to produce a PDF file instead (by running
.BR pdftex (1)).
You can also be more specific about what drivers
.B \%texexec
should use, by specifying a command line such as
.
.EX
texexec --output=dvips,acrobat test
.EE
.
.IP
which specifies the use of the
.B dvips
driver (which is the default), combined with the use of Acrobat-specific PDF
instructions.
.IP
After an error-free run,
.B \%texexec
executes
.BR \%texutil (1)
to determine whether additional runs of
.BR tex (1)
(or
.BR \%pdftex (1))
or any utility programs (e.g.,
.BR \%bibtex (1)
or
.BR \%makeindex (1))
are necessary.
You can suppress these additional runs by specifying the
.B \-\-once
or
.B \-\-runs
flags:
.
.EX
texexec --once test
texexec --runs=2 test
.EE
.
.
.SH INITIALIZATION
.
When starting,
.B \%texexec
first looks for the file
.IR \%texexec.ini ,
which specifies the location of various programs and configuration files,
and specifies the programs to use.
The
.B \%\-\-verbose
flag causes
.B \%texexec
to print the information in
.I \%texexec.ini
to the terminal and the log file.
.
.P
.B \%texexec
requires Perl.
On Unix and Unix-like systems, no special steps have to be taken to get
.B \%texexec
to work beyond installing Perl and having the
.BR perl (1)
binary in your path.
On Windows systems, however, you may need to run Perl by typing commands such as
.
.EX
perl texexec.pl optvar(ARGS)...
.EE
.
.P
The
.B fpTeX
distribution comes with a program called
.B \%runperl.exe
that can be copied and renamed to
.BR \%texexec.exe .
You also have to rename a copy to
.B \%texutil.exe
(see
.BR texutil (1)).
The
.B teTeX
and
.B fpTeX
distributions, at least, should perform the necessary steps as part of their
installation sequence \(en if you have problems, however, you may need to
follow the advice given here.
.
.P
The file
.I \%texexec.rme
contains default configuration information.
If no file
.I \%texexec.ini
exists (in
.IR TEXMF/context/config/ ,
you should copy
.I \%texexec.rme
to that directory and rename it to
.IR \%texexec.ini .
Make any necessary changes to this file to reflect the layout of programs
and directories on your system.
.
.
.SH ENCODINGS
.
Some languages require specific character encodings to represent their
alphabets (beyond the basic ASCII encoding).
Although you can use TeX commands to represent these characters, such as
`\f(CW\e.z\fP', it is easier to use a text editor that includes direct
support for these characters and let
.B ConTeXt
translate them to the necessary TeX commands.
For some languages, this approach can also improve the performance of TeX's
hyphenation algorithms.
.
.P
.B ConTeXt
supports several of the most commonly used encodings.
Check the files beginning with
.IR enco\- ,
.IR lang\- ,
and
.I font\-
in the
.B ConTeXt
distribution for more information.
.
.P
.B web2c
distributions (such as
.BR teTeX )
support a mechanism to map document encodings to
.BR ConTeXt 's
internal encoding, font encodings, and hyphenation patterns.
.B \%texexec
provides a document option and a command-line flag to pass the necessary
information to
.BR tex (1)
or
.BR \%pdftex (1).
You can add lines such as
.
.EX
%& \-\-translate\-file=cp1250pl
.EE
.
.P
or
.
.EX
% \-\-translate=cp1250pl
.EE
.
.P
to the beginning of your document, or specify the
.B \%\-\-translate
flag on the command line, as in
.
.EX
texexec \-\-translate=il2pl somefile
.EE
.
.P
Note that using language-specific encodings makes your file less portable
than using ASCII.
It may not be possible for other people to typeset your documents on their
systems.

This is wrong, I think.  mptopdf is a script of its own, which not
always call texexec.  Hans, do you have a good documentation file?
This one

Please check the man page and check it in if everything is OK.  BTW,

Fine; I fear we have to ask Tobias and Claire for their parts, and Hans
has to aprove the parts that have been extracted from the TeXexec

in principle this is an option, but only when some commandline args are 
also linked along

the advantage of texexec is that it will use a full blown and therefore 
provide a few more options, like working around some mp bugs/limitations 
and checking if sub-tex runs are needed; mptopdf on the other hand uses 
a small plain based format (fast conversion, but no handling of special 
features like shading, transparencies, graphic bitmap inclusion in mp)

Just because kids would like things to be in a certain way it doesn't
mean it should be so.

Please note that I'm not saying that everything possible should be
done to ensure that the installation and use of the programs is as
easy and comfortable as possible, but there are insurmuntable limits
to this. Otherwise, you end up with people like my father's colleague
who put all of his "documents" in a single Word file, printing off the
pages he needed each time he needed a certain document; and then
panicking when he had to send a single such "document" over via email.
Or like this other friend of mine who saw three "copies" of an
important document and deleted two of them ... except the "copies"
were links, and one of the things she deleted was the original
document. Or consider the way formatting is obtained by most simple
Word users ... (not to speak about the LaTeX users entering *math
mode* to obtain *italics*)

As I said, Windows gives an *illusion* of simplicity and that training
is not needed. But it is not so. And when "reality" strike and any
form of maintenance is required (which is more often than most people
might like to think) it's a thousand times more nightmarish.

This all being said, I repeat, I'm all for making the experience as
comfortable as possible for everybody.

OS/2 and Linux do not display the file name correctly but can at least
rename the file. Windows displays the file name correctly (the locale can
somehow be geussed) but when trying to open it or rename it, it complains
that the file does not exist. This is the difference.

Hi Zdenek,

    could also be automaticaly included in babel. I would therefore like to

Any modifications to Babel naturally need to go into the babel sources
and be released there.  I hope Johannes can reply to you about that.
For TL, I definitely wouldn't want to modify the core Babel files as
they are released on CTAN.

Separate files that you maintain on their own, like hindi.dtx, could
perhaps most easily go into the velthuis package, since you say there is
such a strong dependence.  E.g., tex/latex/velthuis/hindi.dtx.

language.dat is another painful story.  That is conglomerated together
from many sources.  If you tell me the entry or entries needed for your
package(s), and a two- or three-letter abbreviation to use, I can do
that.

Best,
Karl

Considering the staggering amount of damage done through botnets, it
would seem like this is as prudent as letting kids just get started
with driving a car and learn while doing.

I wonder why the discussion focuses on Windows. It's all the same with
Macintosh systems. Maybe even worse.

It would be better to put it in Babel but it can be used even without
modifying the core files, it will only be missing from Babel
documentation.

In fact, hindi.dtx is a source for hindi.ldf which is being generated
during Babel installation. In order tomake it work babel.ins must be
modified. Hoewver, it is possible to just generate it separately and put
it under tex/generic/babel/... because all Babel files reside there.

Addition to language.dat is the easiest thing. There are no hyphenation
patters, therefore zerohyph.tex is used and the line is simple.

Not all .ldf files reside in tex/generic/babel, and I think it is better
to use a separate directory (say tex/generic/hindi) as long as the hindi
support is not part of the official babel system.

Yes, rsync is a good option, I didn't see this one. Thanks!

I just don't want to download 700 MB, when I only need about 200 MB...

The debian packages could also be an option.

(i will update the manual later this year to reflect new features)

the new version of texexec is compatible with the old (perl based) one 
but does a few more things; it has most texutil functionality 
integrated;  there is no longer a texexec.ini file used

I'm no OS X expert -- my wife uses OS X, but not TeX, and I installed
TeX on the boss's X laptop.

Mac OS X, linux, and unix are all "#!" OS's (POSIX system calls, the
command shell supports globbing and will run a script under the
interpreter specified in a first line that starts with "#!") .   They
generally provide sh and perl and can share support scripts (updmap,
etc).   Missing bits (X11 on OS X) are on the vendor CD's and simple
to install.

I guess OS X users do have to find ghostscript to use tools like
epstopdf, and ruby for current
ConTeXt.

There are lots of Win32 users.  Depending on the background and
sophistication, attitudes towards free software, etc., they have
widely varying expectations.  For many
Win32 users, expectations are not met by any of the free "#!" derived
TeX implementations, not only because the installers are weak (xemtex
does use MSI, but takes even longer to install than Matlab, and the
fonts don't show up in the OS), but because functionality is missing.
Many Win32 users expect GUI front ends or editors (WinEDT) with
buttons to run TeX, and expect .dvi viewers (e.g., Y&Y's DVIwindow) to
allow you to cut and paste from the viewer into MS apps with a
metafile format using scalable outline fonts.  Many Win32 apps can do
this, so Win32 users who do much of their work in MS Office are
disappointed when they find free TeX systems don't support it.  It is
a serious problem for Win32 users in organizations that expect
presentations in MS PowerPoint format.

Win32 is not a "#!" OS and the machines you bring home from a store
are not particularly suited to running TeX ported from "#!".  Thus a
live CD has to implement the support tools and also arrange to provide
perl, ghostscript, etc.

Maintaining a TeX distro on _ANY_ platform has proven to be too big a
job for a small group.  One one hand, it is harder for Win32 people to
support TeX if they have to implement native Win32 versions of the
scripts in C as well as the additional code needed to replace missing
functionality.  On the other hand, it is harder for the "#!" crowd if
they have to live by the constraints of the Win32 environment, and
particularly annoying because Microsoft has shown little interest in
making it easier for their customers to  use "#!" mechanisms.

The real bind (for the contrarians among us who take perverse pleasure
in providing TeX for Win32) is that if you provide perl, ghostscript,
ruby, etc. for the people who just want to use TeX on a Win32 system
they brought home from the store, you risk breaking other systems
where users have installed particular configurations of 3rd party
tools needed by their applications.

Hm, Werner put his changes in the public domain.  Do you mean that you
agree that the complete manpage be in the public domain?  Or would you
like a software license?

Message-ID: <86odw5mo0z.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi everybody,

I have tried to contact Petr Olsak a couple of days ago, having hoped
that, after the end of the thread about csTeX licensing, emotions had
calmed down a bit, and we could achieve a solution to the license
problems.  However, I have no yet gotten any answer from him.

Does anybody know about his whereabouts (maybe he's just on holiday?),
or does anybody think he's the right person to talk to him?

I feel very uncomfortable with continuing to distribute csTeX with its
self-contradictory license, "GPL with appendix".  It is
self-contradictory because the GPL part does not allow me (the
distributor) to impose any additional (not in the GPL text) restrictions
on the redistributed files, while the appendix requires me to do so.  In
consequence, the whole thing seems undistributable except by the
original author.  

As I understood it, the LPPL is what Petr really wants[1], and it just
requires some polite and friendly pushing by the right person.

What do you think?

Regards, Frank


[1] "the same as TeX" is what I think he said somewhere.  In writing
this would mean to s/Donald E. Knuth/Petr Olsak/;s/TeX/csTeX/ in
ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/macros/plain/base/README, but I don't
think this is a text anybody should use today as a new license.  In
particular, distribution (of original or modified versions) is only
allowed implicitly.

    It would be better to put it in Babel but it can be used even without
    modifying the core files, it will only be missing from Babel
    documentation.

So much the better.

So add the files under velthuis for now, and when it's working, update
that.  If they get added to core babel later, great.  Meanwhile, at
least the functionality will be available.  Ok?

    Hoewver, it is possible to just generate it separately and put
    it under tex/generic/babel/... because all Babel files reside there.

No, I agree with Ralf here.  Files under tex/generic/babel/ should be
part of the actual babel package.  Your files should stay under
velthuis.  They should still get found, no problem.

Thanks,
Karl

OK but it should be tex/generic/velthuis because the *ldf files are used

quite so.  if you've got something that demonstrably works, put in a
change request on the latex bugs site, for category babel (mailing
just johannes _might_ have the required effect, but so far, i suspect
i'm the only other member of the project who even knows about your
upgrade).

quite so.  if you have something that works with babel, adding
johannes to the loop of getting it onto tex live seems counter-
productive.  otoh, i imagine it's reasonable to assume the new stuff
would appear in released babel within a year.

Fine.  As long as they are in a directory named `velthuis', the
arrangement of the intervening directories doesn't make much difference,
as a practical matter.

Let me know when you're close to a release and have a tree to look at,
and we can iron out any remaining details then.

Hi Claire, hi Tobias,

you are noted as the authors of the mptopdf and texexec manpage which
you must have written long ago.  (Actually it's installed in Debian as
mptopdf.1, but only documents texexec).  You didn't attach a license
statement back then.  Now it has been revised by Werner Lemberg, and
he and Hans Hagen as the author of the texexec manual have suggested to
put the text into the public domain.

Do you agree?  I would then add the sentence

"This manual page may be freely used, distributed and/or modified".

For reference, I attach the complete text, as revised by Werner.

Many thanks in advance, Frank

Hi all,

As the address babel at braams.xs4all mainly receives spam this discussion landed 
in aa spam folder Where I spotted it just now.

I will be leaving for a family holiday this weekend so I am not able to do 
anyhing related to babel for the next coupe of weeks.
Pleas remind me when I am back (in august) and we'll work something out to 
incorporate this into the main stream of Babel.
I have a lot of other update requests and bug reports lying around so it is 
high time that I do some work and create a new release.

Kind regards,

Johannes Braams

Here are rpath we would like to automate the process of downloading and

only format I can see available on the texlive page is .iso, or various 
compressed forms thereof.  To mount an .iso file requires root

Is the texlive content available as a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 archive?  Or 
is there another option I have overlooked?

Back on this msg from April.

    As far as I can see the shell script wordcount.sh is placed under

I guess I am tempted to do nothing, after all.  It is just so painful to
deal with adding stuff in the bin directories, and I thought that anyone
who actually wanted it would find it in source.  And the script is six
years old and you're the first person to say anything about it.

  wget -r http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/inst

This is the content of the install CD.  Run this command in a
temporary directory and execute install-tl.sh .

install-tl.sh is an interactive tool, that's probably not exactly what
you want.  But maybe it is sufficient to unzip all files in the
archive directory.

  Reinhard

Cool, glad you're interested.

    To mount an .iso file requires root privileges

I certainly might be wrong, but I was under the impression you could
create an fstab entry that allowed non-root to do a mount.  I've never
actually done it for an iso, though.

    Is the texlive content available as a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 archive?  Or 
    is there another option I have overlooked?

If you want the last released version, Reinhard's wget suggestion will work.

You can also use rsync, 
for either the last release (rsync tug.org::texlive-Contents) 
or the current sources (rsync tug.org::tldevsrc).

Hope this helps.

My fstab entry is:

Hmmm. I haven't need to count words for over 10 years.  The problem
with tools that aren't readily useable is that nobody else uses them,
so when it _is_ needed it isn't likely to work.

> ... None of which are good reasons, I know.  The method does seem
> fairly clever :).

And does something that isn't easy to do with the tools at hand.
Why not put wordcount.sh in the texmfscripts directory like the .pl
and .rb scripts?

For unix/linux a simple wrapper script (based on the texexec script
from tetex, which has  the ugly portability hacks needed to run on
those 1-of-a-kind legacy unix variants ) can find it with
kpsewhich and pass it to appropriate shell.  If any cares to install
sh.exe on Win32 they can
use something like irun to make a .exe equivalent.  The advantage of
this is that the bin files don't have to be updated every time the
scripts are changed, for example:

------------------------------------   runtexmfsh    --------------------
#!/bin/sh
# runtexmfsh -- run .sh script via "kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts"

# Portability: most unix/linux systems with /bin/sh

# to install, e.g., wordcount
# copy wordcount.sh to a texmf/scripts directory  and run "ln -s
runtexmfsh wordcount"
# in the texlive "bin/<arch>" directory

# History:
# based on teTeX-3.0 texexec script, probably last revised by Thomas Esser

# License:
# Changes by George N. White III, 9 July, 2006 are in the public domain
#     to run wordcount.sh,  replace .pl with .sh and change name to "runtexmsh"

Subject: [tex-live] LyX and cmr truetypes
Message-ID: <1152528343.7237.24.camel@pc118>

I've been installing LyX on Linux here for a few years, following
demand, but am not a user myself. Somewhere along the line, mathematics
typefaces have stopped working - I now have LyX 1.4.1 built for use with
the Qt GUI toolkit. A check on the LyX/Qt FAQ -
http://wiki.lyx.org/FAQ/Qt - shows that the LyX people advise that a
suitable collection of Truetype CMR  (etc?) typefaces be installed, e.g.
http://movementarian.org/latex-xft-fonts-0.1.tar.gz
- LyX apparently uses fontconfig - 
http://www.fontconfig.org/wiki/ - to find the typeface files.
(fc-list(1) shows that we haven't up to now had cmr or any other
typefaces of TeX origin known to our fontconfig system.)

How does all this sit with TeXLive? Would it be best if I installed the
`latex-xft-fonts' somewhere apart from TeXLive, or should I associate
them with our TeXLive installation by putting them, say, under
$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/truetype/public/xft-fonts/? Whereever I put them, is
there any danger that my indexing them in our fontconfig installation
will upset anything that TeXLive supplies?

Thanks, Reinhard; that helps.  (I can't muck with fstab because the 
"recipe" (script) I'm writing will be used on a lot of machines I don't 
control and can't have root privileges on.)

Now I realize I also want to automate the process of doing a full or 
nearly full install.  Anybody know enough to instruct me?  I could imagine:
   a. hacking away at install-tl.sh until I have a non-interactive,
      pre-scripted way of doing the same thing
   b. Using install-pkg.sh on various collections until I have 
everything
      I need.
Recommendations?  (Would an install-pkg of collection-basic be enough to 
get up and running?)

The crude method is to install it once and then copy the texlive/2005
tree. The information in ls-R is relative so that it will work. Of course
you need binaries for all platforms.

       a. hacking away at install-tl.sh until I have a non-interactive,
          pre-scripted way of doing the same thing

What I do for my non-interactive test installs is simply feed input to
TL in a here document, see below.  I wrote it for myself, so it's
bare-bones, but maybe it will give you an idea.

A non-interactive variant or front-end or option or whatever for
install-tl would be most welcome, e.g., using the usual configure
--prefix and other options.  If you feel like hacking up something
distributable, that would be greate.

    Recommendations?  

For an installation from scratch, my recommendation would be to use
install-tl, not install-pkg.  (And I also recommend doing the full
[default] installation, so that you never have to use install-pkg
afterwards, either. :)

    (Would an install-pkg of collection-basic be enough to 
    get up and running?)

I don't know.  

BTW, I'm sure the current sources don't install properly.  I haven't
updated the tpm's in quite a while.

Happy installing,
Karl

Hi John,

    - LyX apparently uses fontconfig - 

I don't get it.  How is TeX (no fontconfig there) supposed to work?  Or
does LyX no longer use TeX at all?  Well, whatever...

    How does all this sit with TeXLive? 

It doesn't.  We don't use fontconfig (or truetype cmr, for that matter).

    $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/truetype/public/xft-fonts/? 

I can't see any harm in doing that (good choice of path :), and I
suppose it's theoretically possible that some TL tool or another might
do something with truetype.

    Whereever I put them, is there any danger that my indexing them in
    our fontconfig installation will upset anything that TeXLive
    supplies?

I can't see any.

Best,
karl

Debian <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/tex/lmodern> indicates
that the type 1 lm fonts work with TeX Live and fontconfig.  I
installed it on my debian system, but there were errors trying to
purge the old texlive and then install the current texlive.  I haven't
had the chance to investigate due to a rash of equipment failures, so
can't say whether it really works.  If you have access to debian it
might be worth a look.

I assume that it doesn't matter where you install them and fontconfig
is configuered properly.  However, they are not used by TeX.  Hence,
if you put them into $TEXMFLOCAL, your ls-lR file will be larger.

I personally would put them where the other system fonts are.

  Reinhard

Lyx uses system fonts for the editor and runs (pdf)latex in the
background.  Hence, what you see is an approximation of what you get.

If you make Computer Modern available to X11, the approximation will
be better.  It's still an approximation but with CM you can have
SC+OSF in the editor, for instance.

PdfTeX can use them.  But I don't see any good reason.  They are
derived from the Type1 fonts and their quality is certainly not
better.  And TL provides the Type1 fonts anyway.

I suppose that XeTeX will make all the TeX fonts available to X11. It
will use fontconfig.

I'm curious what happens if the CM fonts are accessible by X11 (and
thus by web browsers) and someone uses tex4ht to create an HTML file
typeset in cmr...

  Reinhard

It does work, but some fontconfig or pango bug (see
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354537) sometimes
causes the wrong variant to be selected (e.g., a small caps shape
instead of a roman shape).

I think that LyX uses Tex only for the final typesetting.  For the
on-screen display while editing, with it's WYGiWYM approach, it uses
other ways to display math.

I don't use LyX myself, and I cannot tell for which parts it uses
fontconfig (on Debian, it isn't linked against fontconfig directly,
anyway, it uses it indirectly via its QT dependency); anyway it also
uses preview.sty.

Thank you to everyone who replied. From people's replies, I think it
would be sensible not to put these typeface files under TeXLive, but to
add them as a separate package which unpacks
under /usr/X11/lib/fonts/xft-fonts, say. They're not expected to
interfere with anything that TeXLive provides, but it seems sensible to
keep them separate.

/usr/X11? Never seen such a path. Moreover, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/ is
deprecated from X.Org 7 onwards. FWIW, in Debian, the fonts are under
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/latex-xft-fonts/, which looks sensible to me.
If you really need files in /usr/lib or whatever directory for some old
non FHS-compliant app, you can always use symlinks.

No, the other way around: XeTeX makes all the X11 fonts (or to be  
more precise, all the scalable fonts that are visible to fontconfig)  
available to TeX.

Subject: [tex-live] Inclusion of LuxiMono in TexLive?
Message-ID: <x8m3bd88ny7.fsf@gollum.daimi.au.dk>

Hi there


Our local Latex-sysadmin encouraged me to write a mail with the
following request.

The 'listings' package recommends[1,p.53] the font package
'LuxiMono'[2] for displaying typewriter fonts in plain and bold, which
can be of general interest for displaying source code.


Any chance of including LuxiMono in TexLive?


Kind regards

Unfortunately the LuxiMono fonts are not free enough for direct
inclusion in TeX Live. There is, however, the getnonfreefonts script,
which downloads and installs such fonts. An alternative font, which is
included in TeX Live, would be BeraMono (=Bitstream VeraMono for TeX).

Subject: [tex-live] OK to update freetype2 source in TL?
Message-ID: <0AB70A2F-0DF7-4C2B-85D3-D8668A7B9E9A@sil.org>

The texlive/Build/source/libs directory includes both freetype and  
freetype2 sources. (These are entirely separate libraries, not two  
versions of the same thing.)

I'd like to update the freetype2 sources (currently 2.0.9) to the  
latest release (2.2.1), both to benefit from improvements and bug- 
fixes, and because the configure/make support in 2.2.1 seems better  
able to support a typical out-of-source build. This will help with  
getting xetex to build reliably as part of tex-live.

As far as I can tell, freetype2 is not currently configured/built/ 
used at all on Unix-like systems (only the older freetype library is  
used, for ttf2pk). But freetype2 is apparently used in building fpTeX  
on Windows. So it's possible that updating the freetype2 sources will  
require some configuration tweaks for that build.

I don't have a W32 development system, so can't try this myself. So  
would someone who builds tex-live on Windows care to try updating the  
freetype2 sources, and see if all goes smoothly? Or are people happy  
for me to commit the new source to TL, and then we'll deal with any  
unexpected issues afterwards if/when they arise?

Comments, suggestions, advice all welcomed....

Subject: [tex-live] case sensitivity
Message-ID: <792536F4-5889-4A70-A3DA-25661C3C50D5@sil.org>

There are currently two files in Subversion that differ only by case:

   Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/arabtex/Unash.fd  [older]
   Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/arabtex/unash.fd  [recent addition]

I guess this is inadvertent, as they have identical contents; but it  
makes it impossible to check out a working copy to a case-insensitive  
volume. So could we please remove one of the [Uu]nash.fd files?

There is also a file Uxnsh.fd in the same directory, but this has no  
lowercase counterpart. For comparison, there is also uheb.fd, which  
is also related to font encoding "U" but has an all-lowercase name.

My suggestion would be to remove "Unash.fd", and also rename  
"Uxnsh.fd" to "uxnsh.fd" for consistency; I notice that within  
Unash.fd, for example, it says \ProvidesFile{unash.fd} with the  
lowercase form.

your recommendation would be correct according to the thinking that
the latex project has: lowercase files are preferred, but nfss always
checks for the uppercase version.

that \ProvidesFile could cause tedious warning messages.

the best way seems to be to compare (using "diff -ruw") the current
sources which are in TeX Live repository with the vanilla (official)
2.0.9 sources, and then apply any differences again to the official
2.2.1 sources.

Naming convention has changed a couple of years ago due to problems with
mixed case names on some platforms. The names of .fd files consists of
encoding and the font family and encoding is now in lowercase. Of course,
\ProvidesFile must also contain the name in lowercase.

The findings:

(1) The declaration of one internal Freetype function,  
FT_Render_Glyph_Internal, has been changed in TL to make the function  
public.

However, a recursive grep over the TL source tree doesn't find  
anything outside of freetype2 itself that actually uses this. Perhaps  
some tool used to call this but has been changed to use the public  
APIs instead. So I don't think it's necessary to apply this change  
any longer.

(2) There's the addition of __cdecl to several callback functions,  
and __cdecl and __declspec(dllexport) to public APIs.

I'm not sure about the status of these. As far as I'm aware,  
freetype2 is usable "out of the box" on Windows, and shouldn't  
require any changes to build with standard compilers (either gcc or  
Visual C++). I suspect these modifications were needed for older (16- 
bit?) compilers, but may be outdated now -- either not needed with  
current compilers, or provided by the standard freetype2  
configuration on Windows. I'd be reluctant to make changes like this  
to the standard freetype2 sources unless there is a confirmed need.

(3) There are added win32.mak, depend.mak, and freetype2.rc files in  
the TL copy.

I can add these to the new 2.2.1 subtree, and try to update the  
content where appropriate (e.g., version information in the .rc), but  
will not be able to check the correctness of the resulting files.


So I'd suggest that we update to unmodified freetype-2.2.1 sources,  
and add the files required to build in the tex-live context -- I  
presume that means the existing Windows-related .mak and .rc files.  
I'll also be needing to add withenable.ac and freetype2.ac, as this  
library will be used in the Unix (etc) builds of xetex. Any changes  
in the actual FT sources would only be reintroduced if shown to be  
necessary.

OK?

JK

    and add the files required to build in the tex-live context -- I

What actually needs freetype2?  Akira, do the Windows binaries that you
build use freetype2?  I'm wondering if those TL-specific Windows files
are really needed, given that freetype2 has Windows support already.

    OK?

Yes, please go for it, and thanks.

Seems regrettable that you are (I assume) on such a volume.

IIRC W32 binary uses freetype 2.2.1 in dvipng.exe, ttf2pt1.exe

Message-ID: <82319743-2D8A-4C9B-8C32-237EB03B0695@sil.org>

Hi Klaus,

I've become aware that the arabtex package as found on CTAN includes  
two copies of the file "unash.fd", differing only in the case of the  
filename:

     /tex-archive/language/arabtex/texinput/Unash.fd
     /tex-archive/language/arabtex/texinput/unash.fd

The contents of the two files is identical; even the \ProvidesFile  
macro gives the lowercase form in both files.

The existence of the two copies leads to problems when checking-out  
from a copy of the CTAN package to a case-insensitive volume.  
Therefore, would you mind removing Unash.fd from the package? There  
should be no need for this file even on case-sensitive systems, and  
my understanding is that current LaTeX conventions call for all- 
lowercase filenames, although the code will check for both.

In addition, it might be desirable to rename

     /tex-archive/language/arabtex/texinput/Uxnsh.fd

with an all-lowercase name, for consistency, although this does not  
currently cause problems as there is no second copy. (This file also  
has \ProvidesFile with a lowercase name.)

Thanks,

Jonathan

Building the tex-live source tree currently fails on Mac OS X  
(10.4.7), because "make install" in utils/sam2p fails with an error:

	cp: illegal option -- a

This comes from the "install" target in utils/sam2p/Makefile, which uses

	cp -a sam2p '${bindir}'

to copy the binary, but -a is not a universally-available flag for cp.

On Linux, -a is a synonym for -dpR; but as all that's being done here  
is to copy a single binary, most of the flags seem irrelevant. Could  
this be changed to use "cp -p" instead?

We've already had pst4pdf

Could you please enlighten us if it should be replaced by pst-pdf,

The 2.2.1 source is now committed, and added to the top-level  
configure script. Everything built OK for me, modulo the sam2p  
Makefile issue noted earlier, on both Mac OS X and Linux. (The Build  
will create libfreetype.a even though nothing actually requires it  
yet... this will change in the future.)

Currently nothing in the Unix TL world (but only until xetex source  
is added).

Yes, but I believe Akira has been using a separate (up-to-date) FT  
lib anyway, not the sources from TL.

OK, I have *not* added anything Windows-specific to the new freetype2  
directory, but if a need becomes apparent, we can revisit this.

should be replaced by pst-pdf, the other package is obsolete.

Hi Rolf,

I believe this is fixed in the current development sources.

Before the script is used pst-pdf.sty will extract postscript
stuff (ie pstricks-environments) and stick in in a "temporary"
file (<filename>-pics.*). The script ps4pdf is only issued
_after_ this temporary file is created by the package pst-pdf.

But maybe Rolf can describe this better...

Ideally, ttf2pk should be updated to FreeType 2.  I've heard rumours
that someone has done this already, but...  Well, as usual, no time
for that.  Basically, ttf2pk is orphaned.  Any volunteers?  I got no
responses some time ago on comp.text.tex.

Hi Herbert and all,

Well, ok, I did that in TL.  But:

- is pst-pdf related to pstricks, other than you maintaining both?
  If not, the name pst-pdf seems rather misleading.  (Plus the TUGboat
  article you wrote talked about ps4pdf. :)
  
- can you tell CTAN to move macros/latex/contrib/ps4pdf/ to obsolete/ and
  leave behind a symlink to pst-pdf?  There's no reason someone would
  know to look in pstricks otherwise.

- Subversion noticed that scripts/ps4pdf.bat has CRLF line endings on
  only the last few lines.  Shouldn't either all the lines end with CRLF,
  or none?  At least it would make version control happier, even if it
  makes no difference to Windows.

Thanks,
Karl

it's not herbert's to move: rolf niepraschk is the author (he's also
co-author of pst-pdf).

i hacked at the catalogue entry to point people in the direction of
pst-pdf, but that doesn't necessarily help.

All .bat files are simply broken, but should be first changed on CTAN, I 
hope.

Reading the other threads I take it that "pst-pdf.sty" will be
included in the next release.

Thank you for the consideration.

makes no difference on windows, but may look funny in windows editors that guess the line endings from the first few lines, so consistent usage is better

Hi Julian and all,

    This next patch does the job correctly.  An alternative, simpler,

I installed the first of your two alternative patches, the one which
does remove the empty path elements.  Why not.

I also restored /. before the $TETEXDIR in the definition of TEXMFCNF in
TeX Live's texmf.cnf.

Thanks,

Hi Jonathan,

Back on this mail from May 21:
    By removing dvipng from line 96 of reautoconf.texk, so that it runs  
    autoconf-2.13 instead

Thanks.  I saw the same behavior.  I made the change to the current
Build/source/reautoconf (which I renamed from reautoconf.texk in the
meantime).  I also then ran reautoconf and checked in the newly made
configure's -- let me know if things seem wrong.  (I also changed
reautoconf to use /usr/bin/autoconf for the "new" autoconf, which it is
on my system, while /usr/bin/autoconf2.50 didn't exist, and was probably
a typo for 2.59 anyway.)

My next job along these lines is to integrate our changes into dvipng's
original configure.in so we don't have to continue with our own ...

Hi Nora,

    ..unzip: invalid option -- x

You can get a real unzip from http://www.info-zip.org.  First time I
ever heard of an unzip without -x :(.

Alternatively, it might work to install from the DVD ("live") iso,
instead of inst.  Then I don't think unzip is necessary.

Sorry I've been out of the loop for a while. Need to re-clarify some things

One reason I was building texlive from source is because I (from some nefarious reason) can not download files of more than 20 megabytes or so through the firewall inbetween me and the world.

With the Tetex source package, I was able to downloaded it and when it was 
make and make installed it gave a complete system.

I get the impression that TexLive can not do this.  Am I wrong?

Or who can I accomplish this?

In the long run, the open source community can't overcome all the
barriers created by misguided policies.  Sometimes users have to
remind management that the project is more important than the rules,
and that wthout access to open source tools the project will fail.

What is complete?  TeTeX was a very basic TeX system, TeX Live tried
to support platforms other than unix/linux and include everything that
they are allowed to distribute.

>

It has been always been possible to download the TL sources and
compile, but the all-inclusive approach means the base texmf tree is
much larger than for teTeX and that builds may not go as smoothly as
they did for teTeX if yo are on one of the more obscure unix variants
supported by teTeX.

Linux distros provide source packages, often these consist of a base
archive and a set of patches, so it is not that hard to build the
package on other systems.  It remains to be seen how the linux vendors
will deal with the loss of the teTeX distribution -- some may backport
selectively, others may adapt TeX Live. The MikTeX package manager has
been ported to linux, which gives you another means to get updates to
macro packages within teTeX or TeX Live.

If you only need basic TeX, it might be quite practical to simply
update your existing teTeX piecemeal with pdftex and any macro
packages you need.  In the short run some linux distros may take that
approach.

You can download a ready-to-use version of TL-2005.

  rsync --verbose --links --recursive --compress \
      --exclude=texlive/source \
      --exclude=texlive/support --exclude=texlive/xemtex \
      tug.org::texlive-Contents <install-dir>

texlive/source contains two large zip files, one of them is >20MB.
support and xemtex contain windows stuff.

Binaries for all platforms require 200MB.

If you don't need binaries for all systems, add --exclude=texlive/bin
and download the binaries for your platform later, for instance:

  cd <install-dir>/texlive/bin
  rsync --verbose --links --recursive \
      tug.org::texlive-Contents/texlive/bin/alpha-linux .

You can browse the tree

    http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive

and maybe you find a lot of other things you want to exclude.

Please also read the rsync manpage, there are certainly more options
you want to use than in the example above.

  Reinhard

Hi Darel,

    With the Tetex source package, I was able to downloaded it and when
    it was make and make installed it gave a complete system.

Correct.

    I get the impression that TexLive can not do this.  Am I wrong?

You are not wrong.  make install in the TL sources builds the binaries,
but does not create a usable support tree.  Because (as George said) the
TL support tree is much much larger than in teTeX, and maintained in
other ways.

    Or who can I accomplish this?

rsync the TL Master tree, then manually copy the binaries into place.  I
believe I wrote about this in an earlier reply.

Or, if you don't want to deal with that, get the TL 2005 CD or DVD from
a user group for a few dollars (or get a friend to send one to you, or
whatever), install it that way, and then you can copy your cygwin
binaries into the resulting bin directory.  The current sources should
work fine with the 05 tree -- Staszek and I have made lots of updates
since the 05 release, but nothing critical or that should cause
compatibility problems.

Does any of that help?

Best,
Karl

Sorry, I meant "lineara", of course.... unless we want to lowercase

from here (without looking at texlive itself) i would claim that all
files of the form

relate to the package, except for

  graphics/epix/contrib/LinearAxis.cc

there was a troubled archive development path for fonts/linearA, since
the author asked for it to be included in peter wilson's archaic fonts
set, and we thrashed around a bit before realising we couldn't do that
while peter was out of electronic contact on holiday.

Yep, deleted this one.  I had accidentally semi-committed the package as
"lineara", then changed my mind and made it "linearA" (I usually try to
avoid capitals in package names, but since CTAN and every file in the
package was named that way ...), but failed to notice this leftover.

Hi John, 

I just replied to this on ctt, mostly reproduced below.

Regarding context, there is nothing special about the context in tl;
it's whatever version is current at the time.  So if the current context
release doesn't work for you, it's unlikely that whatever comes in tl
will either.  I'll send you some hints separately.

Best,
karl

Although Lars is right that email to texlive at tug.org is a better place
to discuss TL specifics, since I saw your note, I don't mind answering.
 The answer is, I don't know :(.  Not any time soon.  I just hope it
will be before 12/31.

As for updates, there have been lots; I try to work on the package
backlog (still counted in the hundreds) almost every day.  You can use
the development tree if you're willing to be a guinea pig -- I do
myself.  (The binaries have not been updated yet, so it's "just" the
package updates so far, for the most part.)  The most convenient way to
get it is probably rsync, as detailed on http://tug.org/texlive.

If anyone has time and inclination to get involved with helping with
the package updates, I would love that.  I wrote down the prerequisites
and first steps at http://tug.org/texlive/pkgupdate.html.

Hi,
some years ago I experimented with parallel makes of teTeX and noticed
that this is not really possible with stock make; one needs the gnu
extensions for multiple targets
(http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multiple-Targets).

At that time the decision was to use only stock make features and not
use gnu extensions. Is this still uphold? gnu make can be easily
installed on most Unix plattforms, I think.

Subject: [tex-live] Where is the master control switch?
Message-ID: <44C4EA04.7080303@rpath.com>

Incorporating texlive into the rPath Linux distribution, I need to put 
the texmf tree somewhere else than where tex expects it by default.  So 
the question: there's all sorts of configuration in the texmf tree, but 
what methods does it use to determine where the texmf tree is to begin 
with?

When I try to run an ill-configured tex I get:

kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt
/usr/bin/mktexfmt: line 331: /texconfig/tcfmgr: No such file or directory
fmtutil: config file `fmtutil.cnf' not found.

Is it normal to have a /texconfig directory at root level?  Or are 
environment variables a more normal approach?  /texconfig may be what I 
need to do.  Where do I go for the documentation of its contents?

Thanks to all,
Ken Brooks

There's a compiled-in default for finding texmf.cnf, and in there are
all the other paths.

I don't think texconfig will help you.  How did you run configure?  In
particular, which --prefix argument did you use?

In that ill-configured installation,
  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFMAIN
expands to the empty string.

In a better installation, a texmf.cnf file defines this variable to
something that makes sense. There is a search path TEXMFCNF which defines
where to look for texmf.cnf files. I guess that your installation does
not even find a texmf.cnf file. To check, just
  kpsewhich texmf.cnf

> Is it normal to have a /texconfig directory at root level?  Or are 

It is $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig/tcfmgr.

If you don't go the regular route, be prepared to read some documentation
(e.g. the kpathsea manual) and to debug some scripts.

Message-ID: <8B9C2430-EA00-4FB5-A6E6-527AED4E52FB@sil.org>

FYI -

I have added the ICU library code (used for xetex) to the TeX Live  
source tree. This is a slightly modified version of the ICU 3.4  
release, so I've added it as libs/icu-xetex to indicate that it is  
not exactly as released. (See also libs/howto/icu-xetex.)

I have also updated the top-level configure and make scripts so that  
the ICU libraries will be built as part of the standard ./Build  
process. This seems to work fine for me on Mac OS X and Linux....  
YMMV. If these changes lead to build problems for anyone, please let  
me know and we'll try to resolve whatever issues there may be.

(./Build won't try to compile xetex itself, as not all the sources  
are present yet. But I'm gradually trying to get all the pieces in  
place....)

I don't know.  How important is the parallel building to you?  I am not

done with other makes (BSD, in particular; maybe MacOSX, not sure).
Although installing gnu make is easy enough, adding new requirements of

Not really. It will become more important with more cores (I currently

Wouldn't it be possible to have a GNUMakefile and a Makefile in the
relevant directories, so that the people who want to use GNU make can do
it?  Maybe only in the unreleased tree for testing purposes, and finally
- after a round of checking whether the nonGNU Makefiles are correct -
they are removed from the release tree?

I almost suggested having both GNUmakefile[.in] and Makefile[.in],
but that would mean maintaining two nearly-identical files.  Sounds
ripe for error.

CHeers,

P.S. I'll be offline until next Saturday (August 5).  Happy hacking,
everyone.

Can autoconf do this? And if it can maintain two versions of
Makefiles, can it also generate the right version (i.e. either gmake
or make)?

I almost forgot: pdfTeX does need gmake allready. We got a bug report

Sorry, I forgot about autoconf.  And I'm not an autotools wizard, so I
have no idea how to accomplish this.  

Sorry for the noise,

So does that mean that we might as well move to gmake wholesale, or
does it show that we should try to be make-agnostic?

I vote for gmake, but will check what's the problem with bsd-make. Can
autofoo handle a setup that will use bsd-make if gmake is not
available?

If pdfTeX can be compiled with many variants of make on many operating
systems but not with BSD make, I fear that it means that BSD make is
incompatible with the original SysV make.

The question is whether it's worthwhile to support all the variants of
make.  I suppose that the OpenBSD people solved this problem within a
few minutes by installing gmake.  You can invest a lot of time to make
the Makefiles work on OpenBSD but if gmake can be installed easily I'm
sure that nobody honors your effort.

Can a web2c distribution be compiled with lex and yacc on all
platforms or aren't flex and bison required anyway?
If people have to install flex and bison, why not gmake?

Relying on gmake has some advantages: There is only one program, hence
there is only one manpage.  gmake provides additional features and it
seems that at least Martin wants to use them.

If somebody prefers that every variant of make can be used I don't
understand why we can live with the fact that flex and bison are
required at least on some systems.

Maybe.  But that means that additional stuff has to be maintained.  If
gmake can be installed easily on every system you can invest as much
time as you want and nobody honors your work.

To summarize the advantages of gmake:  One program, one manpage, no
ugly workarounds in autoconf, everything is easier to maintain, and
Martin will be happy.

  Reinhard

Fabrice, 
it seems that it doesn't make much sense to try to contact you
directly.

Whenever I reply to a mail which contains your email address I get the
following message from supelec.fr:

Subject: [tex-live] MacOS X + CJK
Message-ID: <19351.1154052946@pabst.cs.uwm.edu>

I signed up for TUG to receive the TexLive CD so that I could have a
version of latex that worked with CJK already installed.
Unfortunately, this didn't work:

(1) I have a Mac (i386, 10.4.7) and so I installed MacTex from the
    TexLive 2005 disk.  But after trying it, I discover that MacTex
    doesn't have CJK installed.  Oh well.

(2) Next I tried to use the main TeXLive distribution.
    I installed it (with sudo install-tl.sh) with all
    default options.  Then I sudo'd texconfig (rehash)
    just in case it still needed configuration.

    But then when I run latex or pdflatex on a chinese CJK file,
    I get the output:
....

After some looking around in ls-R files, I see that my installation
comes with GBK kai *.htf files and NTU sm *.htf files but no .hbf
files (apart from some CNS-40 files) and definitely no NTU kai files.

Why does mktexnam say special.map is out of date?
Did I miss some part of the installation I was supposed to do? 
Do I need to get the NTU kai files from somewhere else?
Can anyone recommend an easy way to get CJK to work on latex on Mac OS X ?

Have a look into the file <texmf>/doc/latex/CJK/examples/README to see
which fonts are available on the TeXLive CD.  You should try

  \CJK{Bg5}{bsmi}

I think that the problem is that pdftex builds outside the source tree
(the build.sh script works this way).  Not all versions of make support
this properly.

Is that reason enough to switch to GNU make entirely?

Hi Hans,
thanks for the info.  This means that it has nothing to do with my
mails.  It also means that I cannot do much about it.

On the other hand, I just sent a mail to ntg-pdftex which did not
bounce.  "reinhard.kotucha at web.de" had been accepted.  Do different
ntg mailing lists use different spam filters?

I'm still clueless...

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've been using bash and gmake to build TeX binaries on SGI Irix 6.5
since at least teTeX-3.
Pdftex 1.40beta--20060725 builds using SGI's compilers (but there
hasn't been time for proper tests).  I did try building
pdftex-1.40beta last winter on a system that had only the standard SGI
tools.  There were "don't know how to make xxx" issues that are not
hard to get around (using a successful linux compile for comparison)
but the binaries didn't work due to a known bug in one of the
compilers (the same inertia that prevents installing GNU tools also
results in systems going years between upgrades or patches).  In the
past, tetex's configure has needed bash, and there have been problems
with awk, sed, cp, compilers other than gcc, etc.

Someone working on linux can't be expected to keep track of every
idiosyncracy of "legacy" systems, much less work around bugs for which
patches are available.   Users of legacy systems should expect extra
work, either to install GNU tools or to provide portable code.

In mktex.cnf (localted in the web2c directory of some texmf tree), find the line
  ${MT_FEATURES=appendonlydir:varfonts:fontmaps}
and replace it by
  ${MT_FEATURES=appendonlydir:varfonts}

That might improve the situation.

] 
]   \CJK{Bg5}{bsmi}

OK.  I was using cjk-write-file which added 

\def\CJKhook{\CJKenc{GB}\CJKenc{Bg5}}\ifx\CJKpreproc\undefined\def\CJKpreproc{cjk-enc}\RequirePackage[global]{CJK}\AtBeginDocument{\begin{CJK}{}{}\CJKspace}\AtEndDocument{\end{CJK}}\else\CJKhook\fi

at the beginning of the file.  I tried putting in the \CJK command you
mentioned, but it still used ntukai48.  Maybe I put it in the wrong
place? Is ntukai48 some sort of default?  Fortunately, I was able to
find CJK-fonts.zip (which included ntukai48) in CTAN and installed
that.  Then once I copied ntukai48.{hbf,bin} into the current
directory, I got pdflatex to work.  (It seems strange that maketextfm
doesn't use kpathsea.)

I like using emacs for CJK things since it is able go display CJK
characters correctly, when (it seems) TeXShop doesn't know how.
Perhaps if I install cyberbit ?

In any case, I can use emacs and the AUCTeX hack in the CJK package for emacs:

(load-library "cjk-enc")

; using CJK with AUCTeX

  (defun TeX-run-CJK-LaTeX (name command file)
    "Create a process for NAME using COMMAND to format FILE with CJK/LaTeX."

; use next code line for Mule instead of the (balanced) expression
; containing `cjk-write-all-files'
; -- no multifile document support!
;   (cjk-write-file)

    (cjk-write-all-files (concat (TeX-master-directory)
                                 (file-name-nondirectory file)
                                 ".tex"))
    (TeX-run-LaTeX name command file))

  ;; replace the error source file `*.cjk' with `*.tex' (and `*-cjk.bib'
  ;; with `*.bib'), then C-c ` can be used as usual.

  (add-hook 'TeX-translate-location-hook
            '(lambda ()
               (if (string-match "\\(.*\\)\.cjk$" file)
                   (setq file
                         (concat
                           (substring file
                                      (match-beginning 1)
                                      (match-end 1))
                           ".tex"))
                 (if (string-match "\\(.*\\)-cjk\.bib$" file)
                     (setq file
                           (concat
                             (substring file
                                        (match-beginning 1)
                                        (match-end 1))
                             ".bib"))))))

  (require 'tex)
  (add-to-list 'TeX-command-list  
    '("CJKLaTeX" "%l '\\nonstopmode\\input{%s.cjk}'" TeX-run-CJK-LaTeX nil t))
  (add-to-list 'TeX-command-list  
    '("CJK" "pdf%l '\\nonstopmode\\input{%s.cjk}'" TeX-run-CJK-LaTeX nil t))

The last sexp is a little addition of mine to run pdflatex since it
seems dvi files are almost useless on a mac.  Almost certainly writing
"pdf%l" is just waiting to break when someone gives a path to the latex
processor.

Thanks for all the help.

Well, this is documented in cjk-enc.txt.  You have to say

  \CJKencfamily{Bg5}{bsmi}

instead to set the default font for Bg5 encoding.

Yes.

TeXShop displays CJK characters fine, using the fonts included with  
Mac OS X. I'm not sure how well it would work with non-Unicode  
encodings, though; I guess you'd have to explicitly set the encoding  
of the source file (see Preferences and check the Help). If you have  
the encoding set to MacOS Roman or something like that, then it'll  
certainly have trouble.

A Unicode Chinese document in TeXShop typesets fine through XeTeX (or  
XeLaTeX) with no special effort; just choose one of the Unicode- 
compliant Chinese fonts included with Mac OS X; no need for special  
packages to support different encodings, etc., it "just works".

Others have responded to the font issue, but it is important to note
that "sudo texconfig-sys ..." should be used for system-wide
configuration. Just "texconfig ..." will create files in
~/.texlive2005 so should be run without the "sudo". You may now have
some files under your home directory that are owned by "root", which
may cause problems for other tools such as automatic format
generation, backups, etc.

I have read the kpathsea manual, and the original texmf.cnf, and I am
left with a few questions.  I'm a little unclear on what has to take
place at compile time vs. what is established at runtime:

1. Does a texmf.cnf need to be available at compile time when the
various tex programs are built?  In general, does the texmf tree as a
whole need to be installed for best results before compiling tex programs?

2. There are so many choices.  I'm wondering about best practices for 
handling the numerous variables named in all-caps, found in texmf.cnf 
and elsewhere: TEXMFMAIN, TEXMFLOCAL, TEXMFDBS, VARTEXFONTS, etc.
Should these best be handled as
- command line parameters to "configure"?
- environment variables present when configure is run?
- entries in texmf.cnf (presuming that TEXMFCNF has been set already)
- or, environment variables present at runtime?

3. I have already observed that setting TEXMFMAIN as an environment
variable at runtime is inadequate.  How many such variables would need
to be separately set at runtime to make things work right, if the texmf
tree is not where it was expected to be at compile time?

These variables are defined inside texmf.cnf. If your texmf trees are
elsewhere on HD, change the definitions of these variables inside
texmf.cnf, the definitions are close to the beginning of the file. If your
binaries are not able to find texmf.cnf, set the TEXMFCNF environment
variable so that it points to the directory where your texmf.cnf resides.

I cannot speak for all programs in TeXlive, but for the basic ones it is
not needed.  More specifically, for all that are also in teTeX 3.0; we
build our Debian package of the binaries without having the texmf tree
installed.

I don't think that you can pass them to configure; at least its --help
output does not tell this.  What I would do is patch
Build/source/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in (this is the source file for paths.h
which sets the compile-time default).  But in fact the only thing that
is set at configure time is the search path for texmf.cnf.  All the
others can (and should) be set at runtime in texmf.cnf.

No idea, and it probably depends on the program that is called.  But I
think you don't need this:  All you have to make sure is that texmf.cnf
is found.  Better do this by changing texmf.in.

Subject: [tex-live] One step closer
Message-ID: <44CE6CFB.2070905@rpath.com>

Please don't lose patience with me; I'm digging through a lot of docs and 
getting closer.

I followed the doc's advice and ran configure with
--prefix=/usr/share/texmf --datadir=/usr/share
and let the makefile install the resulting world.
Somehow I don't think that was quite it, because I'm seeing paths that 
involve /usr/share/texmf/texmf.  Here's a scenario (output broken into 
lines for easier reading):

[kenb at metaria texmf]$ kpsewhich -show-path=.fmt
.:!!/home/kenb/.texlive2005/texmf-config/web2c: 
!!/home/kenb/.texlive2005/texmf-var/web2c:/home/kenb/texmf/web2c: 
!!/usr/share/texmf/texmf-config/web2c: 
!!/usr/share/texmf/texmf-var/web2c:!!/usr/share/texmf/texmf/web2c: 
!!/usr/share/texmf/texmf-local/web2c:   !!/usr/share/texmf/texmf-dist/web2c

[kenb at metaria texmf]$ tex /home/kenb/story.tex
This is TeXk, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)
  %&-line parsing enabled.
kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt
/usr/share/texmf/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/mktexfmt: line 331:
/usr/share/texmf/texmf/texconfig/tcfmgr: No such file or directory
fmtutil: config file `fmtutil.cnf' not found.
I can't find the format file `tex.fmt'!


Questions:
1. I'm not quite clear from the doc how to determine exactly what 
subtrees are driven by --prefix and which ones are driven by --datadir. 
Or why it looked in /usr/share/texmf/texmf/texconfig instead of 
/usr/share/texmf/texconfig where tcfmgr really is.  So what made it look 
for tcfmgr where it didn't install it?

2. Which makes better sense: to have /usr/share/texmf and 
/usr/share/texmf-dist etc. as siblings?  Or to have texmf-dist etc. all 
exist under an overarching texmf directory?

Thanks to all,
Ken Brooks

It's certainly better to read the teTeX documentation (I just see that
it is also in TeXLive) first (run: texdoc TETEXDOC) before diving into
kpathsea details.  TETEXDOC.pdf provides a good overview.

kpathsea is working in the background and you'll have to understand
how it works only if you want to do unusual things or if something is
broken.

The TeXLive build system treats the texmf trees and the binary tree
separately.  To compile the binaries, go into Build/source and run
the script ./Build .  That's all.  If configure complains that the
main texmf tree cannot be found, ignore the message.

Avoid environment variables.  You don't need them when you compile the
binaries and you don't need them at runtime.  They are always a source
of trouble.  You only have to set TEXMFCNF if TeXLive is installed on
a read-only media.  In this case texmf.cnf has to be somewhere else.

It doesn't matter where the texmf tree is at compile time.  If
configure complains, don't worry.

At runtime, all that is important is that you have a proper directory
structure:

	/some/path/bin/<platform>/
	/some/path/share/texmf*

The directory 'share' is optional.

/some/path can be a path to an arbitrary directory and you can change
it at any time.  The only thing you have to do is to make sure that
/some/path/bin/<platform> is in $PATH so that the binaries can be
found by the shell.

If you keep the directory structure intact, binaries determine the
directory in which they reside and then look for a texmf.cnf file
relative to this directory.  You don't have to change anything in
texmf.cnf unless you change the directory structure.

If you want to change TEXMFMAIN or any other variable for some reason,
there is one thing you should know:

In most cases it is not useful to change the texmf.cnf file provided
by TeXLive.  You can have your own texmf.cnf file

	/some/path/texmf.cnf

This file is found before texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf and variables you set
there are not overwritten when texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf is evaluated.

In other words, you have to put only the variables there which you
want to change.  This makes sense especially because the sources you
are using are under development and texmf.cnf might change as well.

BTW., you first asked for a method to download TeXLive which avoids to
transfer large files, such as the disk image.  I assume that you had
been interested in a stable release but what you are using now is very
unstable.  Expect that it doesn't always work.  If you intend to make
your copy of TeXLive available to many people I recommend to use a
stable release.

If you are more interested in a stable release, please let me know.
I think that there are other solutions.

A few hints about the TeXLive build system:

All you have to do is to run the Build/source/Build script.  The
binaries will appear in Build/source/inst .  It is a good idea to copy
them to somewhere else if the build was successful because the inst
directory is purged at the beginning of each build and everything is
lost if it fails.

The texmf trees can be symlinks to /some/path/share .  See above.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes. paths.h gets the default for TEXMFCNF from it (plus a few other
defaults). A texmf.in in contained in the source tree and texmf.cnf
and paths.h are automatically generated out of it. You don't need an
installed texmf.cnf file.

That's easy: just make sure that the path in paths.h has a good
compile-time default for TEXMFCNF. Next is to make sure that the texmf.cnf
file *at runtime* has good values for these variables.

Better avoid that.

It works to overwrite what a possible texmf.cnf file would define. Maybe,
your problem was something else...

Have you considered to set KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 (envvar, produces a lot
of debugging output)? Have you checked if some variables are derived by
some SELFAUTO* variables? These are always set relarive to the location
of the binary and cannot be overwritten in the environment.
