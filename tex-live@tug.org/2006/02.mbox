This makes sense to me.  Both use the same basic compression algorithm,
after all.  So I can believe that the difference, as you suggest, is in
zipping individual files vs. one big file.  Of course .tar.zip would not
make sense to distribute, Phil's same complaints would stand,
even more so :).

That is quite good.  Almost 25% better than anything else.  (And somehow
I thought bz2 had been approaching )
That makes me think it would be worth offering as another download
option at some point.  

    - 7zip is slow,

Speed on compression doesn't matter so much.  How is it at
decompressing?  Closer to gz/zip (ok), or bz2 (bad)?

Thanks for doing these tests.

Hi John,

    TeXLive 2005 bugs list overstates the problem - though
    written for LaTeX 2.09, picins (has been modified so that it) works fine
    with the current LaTeX.

Thanks, I changed it.

    has it been deliberately omitted from the Sauter Metafonts in the
    TeXLive distribution or not?

I don't remember.  I'll have to look into it again.  My guess is, not
deliberate, and I'll just add it next year.

    Perhaps what is needed is for the TeXLive installation script to make
    sure that $VARTEXMF/texfonts and all its needed sub-directories exist
    with appropriate permissions?

The mktexmf script itself should do that -- can you check the code?  In
general, I think each script should be responsible for creating the
directories it needs.  There are so many possibilities that it would be
hard to centralize it.

Thanks,
k

I suppose that in Hans' example the content of the ISO-images had not
been compressed.  Hence, compression gain depends much more on the
program than it does when the content of the image is already
compressed.

I must admit that I did not read all the documentation.  I don't use
zip very often and installed 7-zip just after I read your mail.  The
7z manual page is quite short and refers to additional documentation.
At least there is a command line option which allows you to select a
compression algorithm.  Maybe some of the programs can be tweaked to
fit a particular need.

(Look at the previous paragraph.  Seems that Emacs does character
protrusion now :) 

It seems that in this particular case (compressing an ISO-image which
contains compressed files), it does not really matter very much which
compression scheme is used, there is only a more or less significant
difference between compressed and uncompressed files.

It also seems that for TeXLive-2005-install.iso it doesn't make much
sense to provide anything else but zip.  It compresses even better
than bzip2 and de-compression speed is much better.

As far as CTAN is concerned, Robin provides all the packages as zip
files.  He asked before he made this decision and nobody complained.
It is desirable that everything on CTAN is available as zip.

There is certainly no problem to provide the images in different
formats at http://tug.org as we do at http://vntex.org . But there,
the differences between zip and bz2 are more significant.  For the
TeXLive-ISO it only makes sense to consider whether providing a
compressed version or not, thinking too much about which algorithm
to use certainly means wasting time.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, re-compression of an already compressed source isn't going to
help much. The ideal would be if it was possible to compress the data
*in* the ISO, rather than the ISO itself, with 7z.

Now, the interesting part about 7z is that it has gathered a lot of
interest, so although it was initially only available on Windows, it's
being ported to POSIX systems. NSIS, the former NullSoft Installer,
uses LZMA since version~2.

It's probably too late to do anything about it for this ISO, but for
the future it may be a good thing to evaluate: IMO it makes sense to
use it as packing format for multiplatform distributions, so it may be
useful to cram more stuff on the images (rather than for packing the
ISO image itself).

And yes, this would have to be brought up with the CTAN maintainers
too. Or maybe we should wait for 7z to get a little more widespread

Yes, the 7z format can make use of different compression algorithms,
but the most commonly used is the general purpose LZMA, which uses the
same concepts as zip and gzip (i.e. Lempel-Ziff) but allows a much
wider range of tuning options to improve the compression ratio
(therefore getting nearer the 'perfect' ratio).

One of the up sides of 7z is that *if you have lots of memory* you can
usually squeeze a few extra bytes by using insane parameters. However,
this gets very slow (especially if it starts swapping!), and may
require quite some memory for decompression too. (The manual explains
the exact requirements.)

The whole kpathsea should be replaced by a compressed database of
files accessed by flat file names with a separate index for each of
the various search categories.

TEXINPUT=.:!?ist!$TEXMF/database.dat

would then use the "ist" index into the given database file name for
lookink up index style files.

Something like that.

No ls-R.  That would make TeXlive fast, compact, multi-user capable
also when writing, and would render the compression discussion moot.

ah, i forgot to test that (deleted the files already), but i suspect 
that decompression is probably ok; it's the analyse that takes the time

another nice aspect of the 7zip approach is that you can put the 
binaries alongside the zipped iso and that users then have a allround 
(un)zipper, so maybe it's worth switching to this method

Subject: [tex-live] Comments on 7z compression tools
Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1138800002.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

Yesterday, I made build attempts for version p7zip_4.30 of the 7z
compression tools.  Unless these are universally available, we CANNOT
use them in distributions, and 7z fails badly.

Here are notes about what I found.

Source distributions:

	http://www.7-zip.org/
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/

p7zip_4.30 is not autoconfigurized, and as a result, (1) it forces use
of gcc and g++, and (2) it fails to build on several platforms.  Also,
you need to do "make all2" to get it to build 7z and 7za, instead of
just 7za alone.  In addition, the files 7zip/Crypto/AES/MyAES.h and
7zip/Crypto/7zAES/SHA256.h are missing newlines at the end of the files.

Build failures occurred on at least these systems:

	Alpha	OSF/1 4.0 and 5.1	error: `timegm' undeclared
	IA-32	FreeBSD 5.0		cannot find -lpthread
	IA-32	NetBSD 1.6		pthread.h: No such file or directory
	IA-32	OpenBSD 3.2		wchar.h: No such file or directory
	IA-32	Solaris 10		sys/endian.h: No such file or directory
	MIPS	SGI IRIX 6.5		undeclared multibyte function mbrtowc()
	PowerPC	Mac OS X		sys/endian.h: No such file or directory

Builds succeeded on these:

	AMD64	GNU/Linux
	Alpha	GNU/Linux
	IA-32	GNU/Linux
	IA-64	GNU/Linux
	MIPS	GNU/Linux
	PowerPC	GNU/Linux
	SPARC	GNU/Linux
	SPARC	Solaris 7, 8, 10

The top-level README file also contains this warning:

	FIRST : DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on
	Linux/Unix because : - 7-zip does not store the owner/group of
	the file.

    682955930  TeXLive-2005-install.iso.zip	(4.4735%)

For the record, bz2 does substantially better on the live iso:
 1355640832 texlive2005-live-20051102.iso
  615288756 texlive2005-live-20051102.iso.bz2
  658347704 texlive2005-live-20051102.iso.zip

Not surprising -- when there is real compression to be done, bz2 wins,
but when nearly everything is already compressed, it doesn't matter.

I'll think about making live.7z some time, which will probably compress
better and decompress faster than bz2 ...

For now, I've made zips on tug.org for both live and inst.  After all
that ...

I can only find a little general discussion of this new-in-TeXLive-2005
mechanism in the TeXLive 2005 Guide section "4.1 The texconfig program",
and no specific mention of the potential problem. (Not having read this
section immediately after I installed TeXLive here, I hadn't realised
that I was supposed to run 'fmtutil-sys --missing' to prevent all the
users here getting latex.fmt etc. in their $HOME/.texlive2005
directories!)

When I ran `fmtutil-sys --missing', the problem then went away!

Nor can I find any mention of this in the tex-live mailing list archive
(I searched for tcfmgr).

nice to see a speed race between zip, bz2, and ..., but the performance
differences between all these are a toss as soon as mechanics like
seeking DVD heads or swapping hard disks get involved. I still have the
impression that the major speed brake for the TeX-Live DVD at least here
on my PC is some weird DVD head positioning repeated thousands of times
during the installation process.

Does anybody have an idea how this is connected e. g. to the way the DVD
is organized, or the way the install script works? Or is it only my
silly DVD here, and for anybody else it runs smooth and round, but just
slow?

Actually, I have a p7zip i-Package in the *Experimental* i-Directory  
both for i386 and powerpc. But I did compile the unix port of P7ZIP,  
which is p7zip_4.14.01 and which can be found on SourceForge.

I run something like

         (cd "${P7ZIPSOURCES}" && make clean )
         (cd "${P7ZIPSOURCES}" && cp makefile.macosx makefile.machine )
         (cd "${P7ZIPSOURCES}" && make all2 )

Hi Hartmut,

    impression that the major speed brake for the TeX-Live DVD at least here

Sure, when actually installing off a physical dvd that will be many
times slower than anything else.  And obviously decompression will have
happened already in that case; the (de)compression discussion is only
relevant for downloading.

    Does anybody have an idea how this is connected e. g. to the way the DVD
    is organized, 

No clue.  We have a big directory and run mkisofs on it.  That's all we
do.  Master/Tools/MakeImages.sh.  If there's something better to do,
info is welcome.

    or the way the install script works? 

The inst install just does unzip on the archive/*.zip files.  The live
install has to get the file lists (from the lists/ dir) and then copy
those files individually.  Thus it is (a lot) slower.  I suspect it
could be made faster if someone cares to invest time into it.

Best,
karl

Fine, glad to hear it, but I cannot take that statement and alter the TL
scripts ...  I guess I should have said, "volunteers are welcome" or
"patches are welcome" instead of "info is welcome" :).  At this point,
"info" just gets put on my ever-lengthening list and probably nothing
will be done with it in the foreseeable future.

mkisofs has a -sort option which lets you specify files to put
where they'll be found fast. Knoppix makes use of it, but
whether it nakes a huge difference is hard to say. Nor is it
obvious what the algorithm would be which files to put together.

Indeed.

I spent a lot of time on optimizing. Installation from dvd could be 
faster from iff TL structure were changed a lil bit. When inst gathers 
files to be copied, large groups of files such as

	foo/bar/a
	foo/bar/b
	foo/bar/c
	...

are smashed to

	foo/bar/*

AFAIR adding this feature was about 40% profit in speed. If all big 
packages were grouped in this way, dvd installation would be faster, but 
probably  not much faster... So if one is in hurry, please install from 
cd, that is fast enough I belive.

It depends on filesystem used. Some time ago I did a test on a computer
with dual boot OS/2 Warp 4 + GNU Debian Linux, i.e. the same processor,
the amount of RAM, physically the same HD and CD drive. I had to copy the
whole CD to HD. In Linux I used cp --recursive, FS was EXT3, in OS/2 I
used copy /s, FS was HPFS. In OS/2 copying took approx. 10 times longer!

I have now deleted the whole installation of TeXLive 2005 and installed it
again from the ISO image texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso on my HD. The
machine is:

processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 3
model name      : Pentium II (Klamath)
stepping        : 3
cpu MHz         : 233.866
cache size      : 512 KB
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
coma_bug        : no

cmov
mmx
bogomips        : 466.94

FS on HD is EXT3. I measured the times during installation, scheme was
texlive_full

Initialization of collections: 17s (before I got the prompt)
Copying files:               5:20

Dear Colleagues --

Having just received my TeX Collection 2005 DVD (thank you, Robin!),
I was suprised on inserting it into a Win/XP system to be prompted to
install Protext.  Would it not be better to have Autorun.inf launch
a neutral  TeX Collection 2005 installation selector which would allow
the user  to choose between ProTeXt, CTAN, TeX Live and ConTeXt without
leading the naive user to believe that ProTeXt installation is a necessary
pre-requisite to the others ?  As it stands, the Autorun.inf file contains

	[autorun]
	OPEN=protext\Setup.exe

which launches the ProTeXt installer which itself displays "ProTeXt - 
Installation"
in the title bar and then goes on to offer as Open: options  ProTeXt, 
CTAN, TeX Live
and ConTeXt .  It was with more than a little trepidation that I 
selected TeX Live,
being fearful that, no matter what I chose, it would still install 
ProTeXt first ...

Difficult one. I was delighted to see this behaviour, because it means
I don't need to give each new user a seminar on all the possible options
but instead simply hand them the disk and say "Install it".

But I agree, for the more knowledgeable user, it's suboptimal. Maybe the
disk label should say that experienced users should cancel the default
installation and open {something}.pdf or whatever instead.

With teTeX-3.0, texconfig has been redesigned. The script "texconfig"
implements the batch functionality, "texconfig-dialog" implements the
curses based "gui" (is there anybody who wants to write a different /
better gui?). tcfmgr is the "texconfig file manager" which can be used to
check out / check in config files. So all the "magic" about TEXMFCONIG
and how to look up config files is in there. updamp and fmtutil also
use tcfmgr.

I did not especially mention tcfmgr. It is used "behind the scenes". If
kpsewhich properly expands variables if it can find the config files,
you will hardly ever notice it. And if kpsewhich does not work this way,
something usually is broken in the installation or configuration.

Subject: [tex-live] kpathsea and gsftopk problem
Message-ID: <0IU200EBNW92XM@smtp16.wxs.nl>

After years of using my (outdated) installation of fpTeX I, finally switched
to TeXLive. As fpTeX was very close to teTeX/TeXLive, I don't have many
problems. Of course, there's always something that breaks.

The weirdest problem I've stumbled upon occurs whenever kpathsea tries to
find a PK file for a Type 1 font that does not yet exist. It runs mktexpk,
which in turn runs metafont first, followed by gsftopk. The entire mktexpk
run succeeds, so the PK file needed is generated, added to the correct
directory, and the corresponding ls-R is updated. However, kpathsea still
thinks it has failed. This problem only occurs with Type 1 fonts, not for
metafont files.

For example,

  gsftopk ptmr8r 600
  returns exit code 0

  mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ptmr8r
  returns exit code 0

  kpsewhich -mktex=pk -dpi=600 ptmr8r.pk
  returns exit code 1

(Before every run ptmr8r.600pk was deleted of course.)

The output of the last command is:

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600
ptmr8r
mktexmf: empty or non-existent rootfile!

As a result, windvi won't show any new fonts, unless I close windvi and

Can anyone else reproduce this problem?

The file system is iso9660 in both cases.

I can't imagine that HPFS is so much worse than ext3.  It might be
worse, but certainly not 10 times worse.

It is more likely that Linux supports a larger cache than OS/2.

Everything has to be read from the CD *once* and can then be retrieved
from memory (RAM) many times under Linux.  Does OS/2 use all the
unused memory for this purpose?

  Reinhard

no, I have no such plans, sorry.

At the moment, I am not even sure about the future of teTeX. The efforts
to reuse existing packages (debian packages of TeX Live, miktex packages,
miktex infrastructure ported to unix, etc.) seems to be a much better
way than duplicating the work and making a stand-alone distribution.

The source of teTeX is 100% contained in TeX Live, so there won't be a
loss, too.

? The problem of slow dvd installation under windows is *not* a problem 
of reading cd or cache (cd/dvd is read once of course), but problem of 
many system calls. Ye, i'm not proud of that, but don't have a better idea.

Karl

Lets take lm fonts package; consist of over 700 files; insteads of 
calling syscopy for each file (would be a horror), sys is called just a 
couple of times, with wildcards instead of full paths:

	cmd>syscopy texmf-dist/fonts/afm/public/lm/*
	cmd>syscopy texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/lm/*
	cmd>syscopy texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/lm/*
	...

Suh a wildcardish list is built under assumption that the name of 
package is also the name of directories containing files of that package 
(as above).

Now lets take amsfonts package to comparison; it consist of about 300 
files, but while installing from dvd, it takes much *more* time to 
install amsfonts than lm's! Why? All because for some reasons (history?) 
a main directory for amsfonts package is not 'amsfonts' but 'ams' -> 
thus no wildcards heuristic can be used -> thus many system calls are 
performed -> thus slow. While installing from cd, only *one* call is 
performed per package, thus quite fast. And thus I doubt if file system 
or cache or compression or winworld is guilty here...

I am afraid that this is the problem, the cache in OS/2 is too rigid. I
sent a 1.2GB file via scp to my notebook with 512 MB RAM which otherwise
did nothing and ran on batteries so that laptop mode tools optimize the
disk usage. It seems that Linux used approx. 400 MB for cache.

Oh, I see.  Yes, being smart enough to do that would help the unix
installer a lot too.  

    main directory for amsfonts package is not 'amsfonts' but 'ams' -> thus 

Yeah.  I wanted it to be amsfonts but was overruled.

There are far too many special cases like that.  Oh well ...

Hi Ruben,

Thanks for the report, but unfortunately, as far as I know those Windows
versions of the mktex scripts are no longer maintained (Fabrice is now
focused on pdf).  Unless someone here (Akira, Pawel, ...?) would be able
to take a look?

BTW, this doesn't solve the stated problem, but Fabrice wrote a
pdfopen/pdfclose program which can let you reload a pdf in acrobat
instead of open/close, which may let you preview your documents well
enough in pdf mode.  I see someone modified it to have a --back option:
http://magic.aladdin.cs.cmu.edu/2005/07/15/pdfopen-and-pdfclose/

And just to mention for the record, Taco made the same thing work for Unix:

Best,
Karl

What is not contained in TL is your actual selection of stuff in your  
(size-ok-for-internet) texmf tree. Do you have some sort of  
documentation or scripts to make your tree?

I never could get used to pdfopen/pdfclose (although I'll give the --back
variant a try). PDF does look far better than DVI. But the
debug/tex/proofread-cycle just doesn't really fit. Adobe's reader is just
sooo bulky.

GhostScript had serious text rendering issues which strangely enough Windvi
never had, even though it uses GhostScript to prerender the fonts--go
figure. But it looks like 8.5x has gotten a lot better, so I've got a way
out.

It must be a regression somewhere, as fpTeX 0.7 didn't have this bug.

Anyway, I'd be grateful to anyone willing to take a look at it.

Hi Ruben,

Thanks for the report, but unfortunately, as far as I know those Windows
versions of the mktex scripts are no longer maintained (Fabrice is now
focused on pdf).  Unless someone here (Akira, Pawel, ...?) would be able
to take a look?

BTW, this doesn't solve the stated problem, but Fabrice wrote a
pdfopen/pdfclose program which can let you reload a pdf in acrobat
instead of open/close, which may let you preview your documents well
enough in pdf mode.  I see someone modified it to have a --back option:
http://magic.aladdin.cs.cmu.edu/2005/07/15/pdfopen-and-pdfclose/

And just to mention for the record, Taco made the same thing work for Unix:

Best,
Karl

teTeX is not "size-ok-for-internet".  It still provides a lot of stuff
which most people don't need.  As a VnTeX maintainer I don't want to
complain too loudly, though.

TL is a CD/DVD distribution where size has never been a major problem.
But TL ***already has*** a package management system which allows you
to select what you need.  The only thing which is missing is a WEB
interface.  I suppose it's just a matter of time until someone who is
familiar with something like PHP will do.

Another way would be to support Christian's MikTeX packages and use
them to create TL.  In this case, people can install a very small TL
package and can download the stuff they need.

I had been quite shocked at the moment I heard that Thomas thinks
about giving up teTeX.  But on the other hand I expected that it will
happen former or later all the time.  It's very frustrating to see
that many people are working on the same thing (the texmf tree).

Maintaining a texmf tree is really hard work.

The most severe problem of TeX is that there are very few developers
but plenty of ideas.  Maintaining different texmf trees means wasting
resources.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I agree, it's gotten a lot better. And it feels a lot faster too. Or maybe
that's just my new computer.

I'll take the hint and switch to PDF. Heck, maybe I'll switch to Context
too. No promises though. Still, the competition just isn't really getting
past the expl3 phase or years now, while Context's just buzzing with life.
But I digress.

Anyway, maybe it's time. Thanks for Windvi while it lasted, Fabrice! And
thanks to everyone for the parts of TeXLive that are working. 

There's a whole weekend waiting for overfull \hboxes: off to play!

The jewel would be a common package manager for both -) I had such a mad

Nevermind. I've made a test installing standard tl schemes (tlpm, 
running dvd, with not documented --debug option). It reveals that cases 
like amsfonts are rather exceptional. Most of (large) packages live in 
self-named directories, so the gain wouldn't be huge I guess.

I was talking about the tetex-src tarball which only contains stuff which 
is also part of TL.

Regarding the texmf tarball, the teTeX tree and the TL tree have been
maintained totally independend from each other. But, I can hardly imagine
that my texmf tree contains things which are not part of TL. Both
distributions take CTAN sa their source and I used to be much more
selective about what to include and what not.

> Do you have some sort of documentation or scripts to make your tree?

Parts of the tree are controlled by scripts:

Some ad-hoc scripts:

  rsync -a --log-format=%f /t/ctan/support/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.pl /t/src/tetex-texmf/scripts/thumbpdf/thumbpdf.pl

But, most packages are maintained by Makefile.tetex contained in the
tetex-texmfsrc tarball. E.g. to update microtype, I usually do
  cd /t/src/tetex-texmfsrc/source/latex/microtype
  make -f Makefile.tetex update
  make -f Makefile.tetex clean
  make -f Makefile.tetex
  make -f Makefile.tetex doc
  make -f Makefile.tetex install

The paths for these Makefile.tetex (and the build rules) are all set up in
  source/generic/make.rules
  source/latex/make.rules

And, I have a local CTAN mirror (set up as /t/ctan with a symlink
/tex-archive -> /t/ctan) which I update by running

  rsync --verbose --links --hard-links --owner --group --exclude='.in.*.' \
  --times -r --delete --sparse --numeric-ids dante.ctan.org::CTAN/ \
  /tex-archive/

All my stuff is mirrored to tug.org, so you can get it by fetching it from
  rsync://tug.org/tetexdevsrc/

Yes.  There is much that can be done to help -- tools to locate
duplications, packaging of updates in a way that can be installed in
user texmf trees, etc.

>From my perspective, supporting small international scientific
organizations where contributions to multi-author docs come from
people on a wide assortment of platforms and widely varying levels of
support, the crunch comes when the texmf trees in the different
distributions diverge.   The big problems are support for fonts
(author A gets one symbol from a font that is not included on author
B's distro) and bug fixes.  In most cases, such problems could be
resolved by installing a package from CTAN in a user's texmf tree.

It is one thing to invest months packaging TeX Live 2000+N, and
entirely another to continue updating the packages for N+1,...  Some
users are quite ready to install new versions of a package to their
personal texmf tree directly from CTAN, but many are very reluctant to
get involved with anything that doesn't come "packaged", and there are
real concerns from people who need a stable configuration for the book
they started 15 years ago using plain tex and their own macro package
but also need to generate articles and reports using 3rd party formats
that assume a current TeX system.

What are the biggest problems faced in packaging teTeX or TeX Live? 
Certainly the lack of consistent organization to individual packages
in CTAN is a major problem that teTeX and TeX Live have had to
confront.  Do packagers needs to revisit some of this work?
How hard is it to resolve issues related to different configuration
standards and conventions on target platforms?

Better fine-grained updating would be a big help in overcoming
differences in the base packages of different distros due to the
initial selection of packages or to differences
in the timing of releases.  MikTeX and TeX Live do allow users to pick
and choose packages to install, but for TeX Live there is no mechanism
to make updates available when CTAN changes.

In my experience there is much to recommend a system where a TeX
distro sits in a standalone tree and can be put to work with minimimal
adjustments to the system configuration.  Are we heading to a world
where the user must choose one and only one distribution?  Does this
matter if we are diligent to ensure that all distros support user
updates so the practical differences between distros are kept to the
minimum?

In practical terms, I see teTeX as a reasonable basic TeX system, but
most people will need something more, so (given that disks are cheap)
in most cases TeX Live is a better choice.
To me the ideal package manager would install teTeX and allow you to
keep adding packages until you end up with TeX Live.  I'm not sure how
well redhat and debian systems would handle this fine-grained
approach, and there is the problem of what should be installed by the
user and what should be installed "system-wide".

Wow, had no idea they had this whole other font family (besides Gentium)
lurking in the wings.

In essence, Charter extended greatly for Unicode.  I hope someone
(Michael?) can make TeX support for it.  It would be nice if (Xe)TeX
could be listed as one of the "Applications that provide an adequate
level of support for Charis SIL", although I rather suspect they will
balk.

Meanwhile, I will write Victor Gaultney about getting permission for a
TeX release to use the Charis name.

    >> At the same time, SIL has also released an update of the Doulos

Times Roman extended for Unicode, but no italic/bold/bold italic.

    that we should examine the license to see whether it could be included

The OFL has already been scrutinized and both the FSF (for sure) and
Debian (I believe) declared it free(*).  If we can make the TeX support,
we can include the fonts on TL, etc.

Message-ID: <8F22E559-9080-41C0-B0C6-9733E8954171@nielsjonas.demon.nl>

Hi, I'm a Mac man, discovering Linux Ubuntu on a second PC. Ubuntu  
5.10 is still having teTeX 2 in its repositories, not that recent...  
Yesterday I read in the comp.text.tex newsgroup about TeXLive and I  
decided to take the risk, removed teTeX from my Ubuntu PC and  
downloaded and burned the TeXLive 2005 ISO.
I'm still not an Unix hero yet but thanks to the online documentation  
I managed to get through the initial (full) installation.
After pasting a 'PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/i386-linux:$PATH;  
export PATH' in terminal things seemed to work. Great! I was  
delighted, even more when things like hanging punctuation and margin  
kerning finally worked on my Ubuntu PC.
For some stupid reason I thought I had to reboot. I shouldn't have  
done that but I did and when I wanted to continue my playing around  
with TeXLive, pdflatex in particular, I got the dreadful message in  
terminal: command not found. Rereading the online documentation  
learned me that I was probably too impatience again, I didn't put  
'PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH' in the
$HOME/.profile file. So I did that later.

  # ~/.profile: executed by Bourne-compatible login shells.

  if [ "$BASH" ]; then
  if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  . ~/.bashrc
  fi
  fi

  mesg n

  PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH

That didn't work:

niels@p3:~$ latex --version
bash: latex: command not found
niels@p3:~$

TeXLive runs after entering 'PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/i386- 
linux:$PATH; export PATH' in terminal.
So my question is: what am I doing wrong and what do I have to do to  
get TeXLive running?
TIA, Niels

I placed this as the very end of my ~/.bashrc

export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/i386-linux:/home/daleif/bin:$PATH

If youre a Debian (ie including Ubuntu) user, it makes
much much more sense to install TeXLive using the
Debian packages, rather than from the CD.

~/.profile is executed only when the shell is a login shell, otherwise
~/.bashrc is executed.

Fortunately ~/.profile executes ~/.bashrc,

  >   if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  >   . ~/.bashrc
  >   fi

(there is no manpage for ".", try "help ." without the quotes.)

so it's better to set the PATH in ~/.bashrc because this will be
executed whenever you start a new shell.

For a system-wide installation look for a file /etc/bashrc or
/etc/bash/bashrc.

  Reinhard

In most cases, but certainly not all.

Other packages may depend on the old tetex.  The generic TeX Live 2005
install puts everything in one tree that can be shared via NFS with
unix and OS X (perhaps even with Win32).  You can enable it at will
simply by adjusting the PATH variable, so if you encounter a problem
using TL2005 it is easy to check against the older version, and it is
easy to check that documents you create with TL2005 will also play
well with the original tetex.

true. but this (to my mind) pale into insignificance
compared to the advantage of a system using proper
package management.

My understanding is that the Debian setup splits everything into

other package except X.  No /usr/TeX/{bin,share,...} or anything like
that.

AFAIK it should be

source ~/.bashrc

I have no idea what that '.' does. 'source' works for me.

I did install TL 2005 from CD, didn't want to wast bandwidth on it now 
that I had the installation CD from TUG.

Niels' first attempt was to put it into ~/.profile instead of
~/.bashrc.  This didn't work.  I suppose that he never tried to set
the PATH in ~/.bashrc in favour of a system wide installation.

On my TeXLive installation I get

  /opt/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/subfig/ltxdoc.cfg

after the call

  kpsewhich ltxdoc.cfg

I think this is bad.

'.' does the same as source. If you set PATH in .profile, you must log off
and on or use 'su', if you set it in .bashrc, it is sufficient to start a

Could you please write to the subfig author and politely suggest that

Meanwhile, I'll avoid installing it next time around, if he doesn't
change it.

While your at it, please tell him to review his license:

%% Any modified versions of this file must be renamed
%% with new filenames distinct from ltxdoc.cfg.

I seriously doubt that that's intended, as it will obviously not
work (ltxdoc only uses ltdxdoc.cfg)

As I said before, I looked at LDP, but I think that everything there

I'm not sure if this is really what you're after, but it's what I found
when researching the question for others ... if you learn of anything
especially good, please let me know.

   Much the LDP is not Linux-specific, I think it's still worth a look.
   Looked to me like the interesting stuff starts in chapter 2:
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/chap_02.html
   (There's a pdf at http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux.  It's big.)

   Here is one page with a brief intro to the most basic commands, for
   the true beginner:
http://librenix.com/?inode=4052

   O'Reilly publishes a book Learning the Unix Operating System; I
   usually find ORA books to be pretty good, although I don't know this
   one in particular:
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lunix5/

   Finally, I ran across this list of intro (and other) books
   (Unix step-by-step sounds appealing :):

Message-ID: <op.s4mej3lz7qi7tm@edward-gtmx944r.uchicago.edu>

I really hope this isn't a RTFM kind of question.  But I've looked really  
hard, and I can't seem to find anyone who's ever mentioned my problem.

Actually, it might not really be a problem.  See, TeX Live (v. 1.0,  
2005.10.13 [starkit 8.4.11]) is taking an incredibly long time to  
install.  As in hours (3+, at least).  Is that right?  I am new to TeX, so  
I don't really know if this is common, but I'm worried something is  
wrong.  It's about 1/4th of the way done, so far.  I am using  
'scheme-medium.'

I use WindowsXP Pro.  I have 768MB of RAM, an Athlon 2100+ (1.7GHz), and  
about 2.8GB of HDD space left before the install started (now down to  
2.54GB).  I am installing from a DVD-ROM drive which I think is limited to  
only 4x speed.

I am very excited about using TeX, specifically for math related  
endevours, but at the moment I'm kind of daunted by the entire thing.

Hi Ned,

    I use WindowsXP Pro.  I have 768MB of RAM, an Athlon 2100+ (1.7GHz), and  
    about 2.8GB of HDD space left before the install started (now down to  
    2.54GB).  I am installing from a DVD-ROM drive which I think is limited to  
    only 4x speed.

On such a machine, I can believe it is taking hours to install.  It
seems rather excessive to be only 1/4 done after 3 hours, but I guess
I'd still most likely wait it out.

If you have it, you might try installing from the "inst" CD, instead of
the "live" DVD.  Not only is the CD reading speed probably higher than
the DVD reading speed, but for various stupid technical reasons, the
"inst" installer runs much more quickly.

I don't know what "starkit 8.4.11" means.  Sounds intriguing :).  Where
did it come from?  Also, the final release date was actually 20051102,
although I doubt it makes any substantial difference.

Best,
Karl

Karl, you are not joking, are you? What is wrong with "such a machine"? 

I never tried to install from the DVD but if this is the expected install time
on "such a machine" then there is something terribly wrong with the installer...

just a thought ... it's a dual layer dvd, isn't it? So what if the data is on one layer and the index on another?

Installing TeX does take much longer than typical Win32 applications
that install a few large files, but this seems excessive.  Win32
installs from the install CD on lesser machines take a couple hours
(McAfee AV) while doing other tasks (email, X-server).   Have students
been using your machine?  Are you confident your machine is free of
parasites (viruses, trojans, spyware)?   Does your machine perform
well on other tasks?   [Compare the time to md5sum the TeX Live .iso
file (a few minutes on WinXP 2Ghz P4) and to g95 compile the slatec
library (1400 functions -- which can take hours on WinXP 2Ghz P4 and a
fraction of an hour on the same machine running linux).  How long does
it take to rebuild the ls-R files?]  What filesystem are you using and
have they been defragmented?  I find it really pays to defragment NTFS
on WinXP every night, and I generally try to have a separate "scratch"
partition that is empty except when being used for .iso images being
transferred to CD or DVD.  Many no-name PC's are delivered with
incorrectly configured BIOS that kills performance and/or reliability.

Or something is terribly wrong with a platform where it is terribly
hard to write a robust installer.  Maybe the installer should run a
couple benchmarks and give an estimate of the install time.

It wouldn't be such a problem if you only have to do it once a year,
but WinXP systems need rebuilding from scratch rather more often
(especially those that encounter students).  If you have access to a
linux machine, you should consider running the linux install script
with Win32 added to the list of binary systems.  The resulting tree
(when mounted via a network share or copied over to local disk) works
on Win32 after you set a few environment variables (PATH, PERL5_LIB,
GS_LIB, ...) and replace texmf.cnf with texmf.cnf-4WIN.

Subject: [tex-live] install TL from net
Message-ID: <17385.18170.535908.115981@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
it would be nice if people can install TeXLive from the network
instead of downloading the complete ISO image.  Most people do not
need all the packages provided by TeXLive.  Also, packages can be
updated after TL has been released.

When the packages are available on the server, maybe they can be
maintained continuously and a TL release will be just a snapshot of the
packages.

There are several ways to achieve this goal, one would be to adapt the
MikTeX package tool, another one would be to use the TeXLive install
script.

I'm not familiar with the TL package management system and, even
worse, I don't have much time at the moment.

However, I installed a small TeXLive from the net successfully
yesterday by adding a few lines to install-tl.sh.

The result is quite promising, I selected "Essential programs" and
"The bare TeXLive" in the standard collections menu and "German" in
the languages menu.

With 1Mb/s DSL I got:

  $ ./install-tl.sh

  [...a lot of stuff omitted...]

  Welcome to TeX Live!

  real    9m0.713s
  user    0m5.556s
  sys     0m10.861s



That's what I've done:

I copied the content of the install-CD to a directory, removed
everything in the "archive" directory and made this directory
writable.

Then I modified install-tl.sh according to the following patch:

I use wget with the --timestamping option (-N) so that it just mirrors
the files.  No package is downloaded twice when you install new
packages later, even if you select these packages in the menu, unless
the file has been updated on the sever.

The unzip -o option is only for testing.  Remove it if you change
anything in texmf-var.

The patch above does not alter the behaviour of the script when the
installation media is a CD.  Files are downloaded only if the archive
directory is writable, which is never the case on a CD.


BTW., a zipped version of http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/inst is
about 61.3 MB when the "archive" directory is empty.  That's still too
much but I think that the files from which the menues are derived
should be mirrored as well.

Some programs are not available for each platform.  However, the
install script assumes they are.  But when I installed vntex, I even
got messages like:

  http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/inst/archive/cm.x86_64-linux.zip
           => `/home/reinhard/texlive-2005-inst/archive/cm.x86_64-linux.zip'

  Connecting to tug.org|130.225.2.178|:80... connected.
  HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found
  23:59:32 ERROR 404: Not Found.

cm fonts are certainly not platform dependent and if the install
script looks for files which don't exist (it checks whether a zip
file exists before it attempts to extract it) it is quite explainable
that installing from a CDROM is slow.  Or did I do something wrong?

As I said, I don't have much time now.  Anyone out there who is
interested in making something useful from it?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

Thanks for all your advice on my previous question - things finally  
installed, but I am now told by a few other people that using the 'live'  
disc is a very slow way to install.

I have a second question.  I was wondering whether I might find a  
specification for LaTeX, similar to those offered for HTML and Java.  I  
have always found these to be helpful resources.  If not, then I guess  
there are enough books to keep me busy anyway.

from postings it looks like someone installs the whole lot, in which case it makes more sense just to copy the dvd's texmftrees directly, install the binaries in a known path and set the texmfcnf env var to point to the right spot, 

(i must admit that i never install tex on windows/linux using an installer, one you have a tex setup, updating is just copying -)

I have not tried TL 2005 from DVD yet. Last year I installed TL 2004 from
DVD on my notebook M6R with Linux FC2. I do not remember the time exactly
but full install took something like 15 to 30 minutes.

2 of the 6 bugs listed for TL2005 could be fixed by updated (msg and
pst-3d) packages.

This could also help testers, as testing some individual packages can
be done indpendently from the issues related to the overall packaging
and allows testers to test individual packages in those small chunks
of time you get while waiting for some other task to finish.  Many
packages could be tested by installing to a texmf-test tree, even
using a base system that was installed using .deb or .rpm (or .msi?)
packaging.

fpTeX provided network updates, but the implementation was fragile
(early versions had problems displaying the tree of available packages
on some machines).  It was quite useful for TL2003, mostly because it
provided updates to fix bugs in the initial release.

At some point, however, you have to think about updating binaries and
shared/global configuration files (texmf.cnf).  There is a bit more to
a TL release than "just a snapshot" -- it is the time to make the
shared/global changes and also to root out conflicts.

The downside of piecemeal updates is that you enable conflicts, e.g.,
you have packages A-1.1, B-2.1, C-3.0 installed, then new versions
A-2.1 and B-2.2 are released, with B-2.2 needing A-2.1, but C-3.0
needing A-1.1.  In practice the person who wrote A has never actually
looked at C, so is unware that A-2.1 broke C.  Murphy says there will
be one group of users that need B-2.2 but never use C, and another
that use C but not B (and that you can only learn of this 5 minutes
before you are scheduled to leave on a 2-week holiay).

Updates can be simple bug fixes or new versions of macro packages. 
For TL, human intervention is needed to determine whether an update to
a macro package on CTAN is a simple bug fix or a significant change
affecting other packages.
OTOH, it could be helpful to know which packages have complex
dependencies and which can be updated independently, so I see benefits
to releasing network updates to selected packages when CTAN changes.

Or just manually unpack the .zip files.  I did try the MikTeX
installer, but the debian kernel I was running at the time had
"issues" with the SGI xfs hosts NFS directory we use to share TL2005
and (several kernel updates later) I haven't had the chance to
revisit.

The fact that it took relatively few changes to implement network
installs is a tribute to a robust initial design and to simplicity. 
People will always want software to do more.  It is often better to
err on the side of simplicity, but that often means more work (to
manually analyze conflicts) for users.  The trick is to minimize the
opportunities for users to get into messes that take
developer/maintainer time.

Hi there,

installing medium TL scheme under windows from DVD (average machine) 
takes minutes, not hours. Not that sluggish -) If one spends hours, it 
means something hangs. I would encourage to start tlpm.exe that shows 
real progress info.

I've just tried under WinXP, for comparison of timing posted in this 
thread. 1.8Ghz, 1GB RAM machine, no antivir, fragmented hd, not heavy 
processes in the background.

installing scheme-medium (19654 files 377 packages)

DVD: 21 minutes
CD:  3 minutes

So, if installation time exceeds such reasonable time, definitely 
something is going wrong. Please run

cmd>tlpm.exe
tlpm>inst scheme-medium.scheme -d C:\yourTeXdir

from cmdline and trace the progress info. Does it go on? Does the log file

	C:\yourTeXdir\tlpm.log

grow up?

here i still have the very slow DVD installation caused by lots of DVD
seeking. Simple experiment:

mkdir /tmp/xxx
cd /cdrom/texlive/texmf-dist/fonts
cp -a * /tmp/xxx

and the DVD starts rather periodic seeking here and copies damn slow,
this simple copy of 425 MByte needs 7:40 minutes here, 1 MByte/s,
AMD64-3700 sarge. A simple tar on the harddisk takes a few seconds. I
have checked by ls -i the inode numbers for the copied sequence of
filenames on the DVD, but the inodes are near to each other, there is
nothing suspicious. Some DVD housekeeping that forces seeks? But if one
is patient, finally everything is ok.

The problem is gone since I added the path of my textlive installation 
in my PATH variable.  I did not realize I forgot this the first time 
because tetex has been installed by default with Debian and I wasn't 
knowing it.  So the the hyperref package was missing to my tetex 
installation, not to my texlive installation.  I uninstalled tetex to 
avoid conflics and now all is fine.

I don't think that anything should be updated which requires changes
to configuration files.  TL-2005 should not be maintained any more
when TL-2006 is released.  I don't think that binaries should be
updated at all unless the files on the CD contain severe bugs or the
update provides a very significant improvement.

When the TL texmf tree can be updated at any time I'm sure that
package authors/maintainers will be much more interested to support
TeXLive directly instead of just putting the files on CTAN.

And not every package can be updated.  In particular, a package can
only be updated unless old files have to me removed.  

But bugs can be fixed in most cases.

  > The downside of piecemeal updates is that you enable conflicts,

I switched to Gentoo Linux now which does exactly that.  I hope it
wasn't a mistake, but as far as I can tell I'm amazed how good
everything works.

I doubt that TL maintainers have the time to resolve such problems.

   $ find /opt/tex/texlive/2005 -type f | wc -l
   55312

Hence it doesn't matter very much whether a package is updated by it's
author or a new TL release is made.  Nobody can say whether there are
such conflicts between packages.  It would even be much better and
more secure when package authors are more motivated to make sure their
stuff works properly in TL rather than rely on Karl and Staszek.

I just tried to install from net and I'm not sure whether this is the
preferred way to do it.  There had been some meetings of CTAN
maintainers and TeX system disributors in Bremen (2003) and Darmstadt
(2004) where things like this had been discussed.  I don't know the
results of the discussions.  Hope that I meet Thomas Esser in the near
future.  Or did someone write something down during this meetings?

The reason I had been able to install from net by adding only very few
lines of code is not that the install script is simple.  I must admit
that I even don't know how it works.  All I did is to download a zip
file before the script wants to install it.  But there is no doubt
that the install script is well designed.

I'm also wondering what people need.  MikTeX can download missing
files on-the-fly.  But should we really go so far?  People don't care
about what they have installed already, but when they disconnect their
laptops from the network, they should know exactly what they need and
what they have installed before they use their laptops en-route.

At least, my approach enables people who do not have a flatrate to
install a small TeXLive which contains everything they need and
nothing else in a very short time.  Downloading the complete ISO image
takes much more time.  And as I said before on this list, without a
flatrate time is money.

  Reinhard

Yes, it could happen that  some data file is on the one layer and
the accompanying index file is on the other.

FIrst, if the double layer DVD could make installation of e.g. TeXLive
painfully slow due to data residing on different layers then the
installation from the plain TeXLive DVD (ehich isn't double
layer) shouldn' be a problem. Right?

When burning a double layer dvd first an iso image will be created by
using mkisofs. At this tage we have no notion of layers. That comes
later when a premastering will be done. 

Premastering is hidden when the burning is done by a drive which is
capable of burning  a DL DVD. I did like this for the TeX Collection
2005.

In this process I do not see any possibility of directing files to a
specific layer. 

I would assume that for burning the iso image on a DL DVD the iso image
just gets cut in two pieces for the two layers. This means that likely
two files residing in the same directory will happen to live on the
same layer on the DVD. Exception might be a directory which starts at
the first layer and ends at the second layer.

The question now is if mkisofs could be told to keep certain files
"together" (keeep in mind there is no notion of layers for mkisofs)

What I've found is (from the man page of mkisofs):

  -sort sort file
              Sort file locations on the media. Sorting  is
controlled  by  a file that contains pairs of filenames and sorting
offset weight- ing.  If the weighting is  higher,  the  file  will  be
located closer to the beginning of the media, if the weighting is lower,
              the file will be located closer to the end of the
media.  There must  be  only  one space or tabs character between the
filename and the weight and the weight must be the last characters  on
a line. The filename is taken to include all the characters up to,
              but not including the last space or tab  character  on
a  line. This is to allow for space characters to be in, or at the end
of a filename.  This option does not sort the  order  of  the  file
              names  that  appear in the ISO9660 directory. It sorts
the order in which the file data is written to the CD image - which may
be useful  in  order  to  optimize  the  data  layout  on a CD. See
              README.sort for more details.



Perhaps this gives us a possibility to keep certain files together on
one layer by giving them equal weights.

The iso image of the TeX Collection 2005 had the following order of
directories from a mkisof's point of view:
/ctan    		( 4368186 ) 
/texlive  		( 1245653 )
/protext  	( 691000 )
/mactex  	( 659665 )

In parenthesis I've included ths sizes of the directories.

>From this I would assume that the directory of the iso file system and
the ctan stuff are on the same layer. This would imply that for
installing TeXLive, ProTeXt or MacTeX it has to be switched constantly
between the layers which is especially bad in the case of many small
files.

If my thoughts are no too far from reality I should be able to do the
following:
Creating a DL DVD putting /texlive, /protext and /mactext
on the first layer and testing an installation of TeXLive to see if
this makes it faster.

I thought the idea was for a double layer DVD to make things faster by
putting "close" files on different layers at the same position, thus
less head movement.

    on the first layer and testing an installation of TeXLive to see if

It sounds interesting.


Another issue is how new double-layer drives are.  We still have lots of
users with no DVD drives at all, as we know.  If DL drives are even
newer than "standard" DVD drives, I fear we couldn't use it anyway ...

Thanks for looking into this.

AFAIK all DVD drives do double-layer, as double-layer DVDs were
invented right at the start.

<quote src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_layer">
DVD recordable discs supporting this technology are backward
compatible with most existing DVD players and DVD-ROM drives.
Many current DVD recorders support dual-layer technology, and the
price point is comparable to that of single-layer drives, though
the blank media remains significantly more expensive. Currently
the technology has severe problems with compatibility in DVD
players. Dual Layer Drives will work with Regular DVD-R drives.

I thought the idea of double layer was to double (well, not exactly but
almost) the capacity. :-)

Who should do it? putting "close" files on differnet layers at the same
position. As I said, mkisofs has no notion of layers and when burning,
e.g. using growisofs then the burner gets fed the iso image chunkwise
burning each chunk immediately after receiving it.

Message-ID: <6.2.1.2.0.20060227150740.0036fc90@mail.rpi.edu>

Hi,
I've installed TL2005 on my own WinXP machine and I'm encouraging faculty, 
staff, and students at RPI to do so.
But I found something that is an inconvenience and causes many 
inexperienced users to get stuck.

The config files for dvips and pdftex under the texmf-var tree are 
read-only, which means users can't edit them to change the paper size for 
letter size. The solution is to change the Windows properties of these 
files before trying to edit them, but this is an annoying extra step. I 
don't know how many of our users just gave up on making the changes and now 
their margins will be wrong when they print.

I don't see how this can be changed at this point, but perhaps in the next 
TL distribution?
Any other reports of this?

Thanks for TeXLive,
-Harriet

I think this is OK.  The original texmf trees should be "shareable".
Rather than change the original files, users should make copies in
their home texmf and
make any changes there.  It might help to put comments in the files:

# This is config.ps, the dvips configuration file.   Users are discouraged from
# customizing files in the system directories which will be overwritten when
# the system is upgraded.  Instead, users are encouraged to place customized
# versions of this file in one of their own "texmf.../dvips/config"
directories
# and run texhash to refresh the ls-R files.  To verify that the new
configuration
# file is being used, run the following commmand in a shell:
#
# kpsewhich --progname=dvips --format='dvips config' config.ps
#
# When the system is upgraded, users should compare their customized
# configuration files to the system versions and adjust accordingly.

Thank you, Robert and George, for your helpful comments and
suggestions.
Robert's suggestion works great; I'll incorporate his attrib command
in my local instructions for changing the paper size.

George, I understand your thoughts on not changing the original
config files, but the files under texmf-var are not the originals
(which are in the texmf tree). For years, the official instructions
have been to change the config files in the texmf-var tree, and this
year's TeXLive instructions still say to change these files. This is
the first year that the texmf-var tree has been read-only. So I
think it's reasonable to change this attribute.

Do the people who put together TeXLive see these emails? I do think
the read-only permissions on texmf-var were unintended this year.
Thanks again for your help,
-Harriet

Open a DOS window, go to the base directory of your Texlive (perhaps
C:\Texlive2005) and enter

attrib -R texmf-var\*.* /S

this change the attributes of all files in the texmf-var branch to writable.

Yes.  The texmf.cnf for windows puts texmf-var this before the $HOME/texmf.
On linux, TEXMFVAR=$HOME/.texlive2005/texmf-var.

I haven't given out the TL2005 install CD very widely, in part because
the people who have problems with TL2003 need some updates that didn't
get into TL2005, and there seem to be problems with WinDVI and user
fonts so now I'm testing a mixture of Win32TeX (by Kakuto), dviout,
and TL2005 (and using linux for real work!).

TL gets put together into a test versions and fixed only as far as
testers report problems.   I did most of my testing using the linux
installer and copying the tree over to Win XP, but I had my own
texmf.cnf for our particular situation (user home dirs on a network
drive).

Hi Harriet,

    Do the people who put together TeXLive see these emails? 

Yes.  The Windows installer was developed and is maintained by Pawel
Jackowski and Staszek W., who are both on the list.  I hope they will be
able to fix the problem for next time.

Klaus noted that he needed to do the Windows installation as
administrator.  Maybe for the same underlying reason.

Windows installer do not touch file attributes; they remains ro as they 
are on CD. Although I like to have original config files somehow 
proteted, must agree, that texmf-var should be editable. Staszek, Tomek? 
What do you think?

Don't think so. Cmdline installer needs rights to create tex-root 
directory and copy files into it. Preparing system however (env 
variables, meybe some tmp files) may need administrative privilages. Tomek?

    Although I like to have original config files somehow 
    proteted, must agree, that texmf-var should be editable. 

I agree, of course.  And, it would be very nice if there was a simple
check box during the installation to allow the user to switch between
letter and a4 paper.  It is undesirable for users to have to figure out
all the config files to edit to do this -- there are a bunch.  (And it
has to happen before any .fmt's are made, too.)

Thanks,
