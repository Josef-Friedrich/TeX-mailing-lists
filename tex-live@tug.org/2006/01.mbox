I decided to use TMP because teTeX and TeXLive already depend on it.  

texconfig:
  tmpdir=${TMP-/tmp}/tctmp.$$

updmap:
  tmpdir=${TMP-/tmp}/$progname.$$

fmtutil:
  tmpdir=${TMP-/tmp}/$progname.$$

If /tmp cannot be used, teTeX and TeXLive users have to set TMP anyway
and hence I used it as well.

Anyway, thanks for the hint.  After a discussion with George White
about the security problems with /tmp I added some code to /etc/bashrc
which creates a directory /tmp/<UID>-<login-name> if it doesn't exist,
sets permissions (rwx only for the owner), issues a message "ask your
system administrator..." if this cannot be done (file with this name
exists and is owned by someone else) and sets TMP, TEMP, and TMPDIR
respectively.  Obviously, some programs ignore all three variables.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The people from LyX have problems with the latest texlive and
the windows part. Is the windows part still supported, or
is this the same as proTeXt?

Could you do this for me please. You know more details about this than I do.

proTeXt works fine with LyX. It is very similar to my LyXWinInstaller,
the difference is that I ship LyX as editor, protext comes with
TeXnicCenter and WinEdt.

TeX Live2005 *has* epstopdf for Windows. eps2pdf has never been used in TL.

Doesn't this epstopdf assume that there is a Perl somewhere?

Ok, this is what I am doing now, too, but this *shouldn't* be necessary,
at least IMHO!

Nup, wrong. (La)TeX has \textwidht and \textheight, and there is some
code in artcle.cls and the .clo files (I assume that you ment telling
dvips via -tlandscape that thisdocument is set in landscape mode, but
this is not what I am talking about):

article.cls:
\DeclareOption{landscape}
   {\setlength\@tempdima   {\paperheight}%
    \setlength\paperheight {\paperwidth}%
    \setlength\paperwidth  {\@tempdima}}

in size12.clo:
  \setlength\@tempdima{\paperwidth}
  \addtolength\@tempdima{-2in}
  \setlength\@tempdimb{390\p@}
(assume one column)
    \ifdim\@tempdima>\@tempdimb\relax
      \setlength\textwidth{\@tempdimb}
    \else
      \setlength\textwidth{\@tempdima}
    \fi

So the texwidth is tried to be set. But I beleive that this computation 
is done before the landscape mode is changed, and the textwidht is not 
recomputed (interestingly the textheight is!).

Best wishes

Of course, but that was *not* the question.

What I want is from some LaTeX master to tell me either that it is
necessary to use geometry or set the textwidth/height manually, or that
there is a problem with the implementation, or that I need something
else.

The implementation in the standard classes does not try to maximize  
\textheight and \textwidth. On the contrary, it tries so see if the  
predefined ``optimal'' values fit on the paper, and if it doesn't, reduces  
them to fit the margin specifications. Here are the comments from  
classes.dtx.

%    First, we calculate the maximum |\textwidth|, which we will allow
%    on the selected paper and store it in |\@tempdima|. Then we store
%    the length of a line with approximately 60--70 characters in
%    |\@tempdimb|. The values given are more or less suitable when
%    Computer Modern fonts are used.
% \changes{v1.1a}{1994/03/12}{Have old values for width in native mode}
%    \begin{macrocode}
   \setlength\@tempdima{\paperwidth}
   \addtolength\@tempdima{-2in}
%<10pt>  \setlength\@tempdimb{345\p@}
%<11pt>  \setlength\@tempdimb{360\p@}
%<12pt>  \setlength\@tempdimb{390\p@}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    Now we can set the |\textwidth|, depending on whether we will be
%    setting one or two columns.
%
%    In two column mode each \emph{column} shouldn't be wider than
%    |\@tempdimb| (which could happen on \textsc{a3} paper for
%    instance).
%    \begin{macrocode}
   \if@twocolumn
     \ifdim\@tempdima>2\@tempdimb\relax
       \setlength\textwidth{2\@tempdimb}
     \else
       \setlength\textwidth{\@tempdima}
     \fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    In one column mode the text should not be wider than the minimum
%    of the paperwidth (minus 2 inches for the margins) and the
%    maximum length of a line as defined by the number of characters.
%    \begin{macrocode}
   \else
     \ifdim\@tempdima>\@tempdimb\relax
       \setlength\textwidth{\@tempdimb}
     \else
       \setlength\textwidth{\@tempdima}
     \fi
   \fi

So yes, if you want terribly overlong lines in a one-column, landscape  
document, then you have to either manually set \textwidth or use a package  
that will do it for you.

Yes. Perl (a minimal) is installed on Windows by default, but can be 
deselected if you already have it. See TL doc (and also tlpmgui help).
Perl is required by many important tools: epstopdf, mptopdf, updmap, 
texexec, texdoctk and much more.

Thanks 1000 times. That was what I missed.

(Background: I had to make a wid table for display, and thought
landscape is enough)

Ok, I will try to remember this.


Side note/question: Was this always like this?

updmap is a sh script and doesn't need Perl.

True on Unix.  Not so on Windows, to my knowledge, which is what the
question was about.

(This double source is a big problem in itself, which we've talked about
too many times.  Sigh.)

I do not feel that I have a good understanding of the relationship between 
TeX Live (http://www.tug.org/texlive/) and teTeX 
(http://www.tug.org/tetex/).  It would seem that these are both 
distributions of TeX and that I should choose between them when 
considering adding TeX to a new system.  How should I decide between TeX 
Live and teTeX?

I have also observed that teTeX seems to be more widely distributed, in 
that RPMs for it are in RedHat Linux distributions, and there is a Solaris 
package available at http://www.sunfreeware.com.  The TUG home page 
however, advertises TeX Live and does not mention teTeX.  Is TeX Live more 
official or supported by TUG than teTeX?

Please let me know how I should view these two distributions.

teTeX and TeXLive are based on the same source tree;
at any given time they may vary a little in which version
of a program or library is included, but there is no
separate development.

they differ mainly in the accompanying support tree
of fonts and macros. teTeX is really only divided into a
base collection and a set of extras; TL is divided into a
set of several dozen collections, each comprising a set
of packages. The TL packages and collections are very much
larger than what is teTeX; teTeX is a rational choice of what
a sensible setup is, whereas TL is simply more or less
everything available (under the conditions that it be on
CTAN and have a free licence).

TUG and the other LUGs do put direct  effort and money
into TL. But Thomas Esser (teTeX) is part of TL too, so it
is not really favouring TL over teTeX.

The main glory of TL is its metadata about packages and
collections, which made it possibly to automatically
derive Debian packages for each of the separate
collections.

How do you decide? depends on what you want a TeX
setup for. teTeX will be perfect for the vast majority
of mainstream users. TL will be a better starting point
if you intend to maintain a complete setup for a very wide
variety of users.

Hi Donald,

Just to follow up a little on Seb's response ...

    How should I decide between TeX Live and teTeX?

As Seb said, if you want a maximal distribution, use TL.  If you want a
more "medium" distribution, teTeX is fine.

    I have also observed that teTeX seems to be more widely distributed, in 
    that RPMs for it are in RedHat Linux distributions, and there is a Solaris 
    package available at http://www.sunfreeware.com.  

This is primarily because teTeX can be configured/compiled/installed
similarly to most other free software packages.  TL can't.  (Long story.)

    The TUG home page however, advertises TeX Live and does not mention
    teTeX.  Is TeX Live more official or supported by TUG than teTeX?

No, TUG supports both.  The teTeX home page is in fact on tug.org, and
there are lots of links to teTeX, e.g., on begin.html, interest.html,
etc.  I hadn't thought to put a link on the home page itself, but it
sounds like a good idea, so I just did it.

Also, just to be clear, all support of all the free distributions is on
a volunteer basis.  TUG has exactly one administrative employee; about
as far as banks of support operators answering phones in India as one
can imagine :).

Best,
Karl

One more comment: if you need just a few "exotic" packages according to
distribution for mainstream users, you most probably find them on TL and
just install. You will hardly find such a package as .rpm or .deb for
teTeX, you will have to add it manually.

Message-ID: <BAY17-DAV3AB4AC250CAA435AFC1A6C4270@phx.gbl>

Hello all,

I have a small question about the difference in contents 
between the "live" DVD and "inst" CD versions of TeX Live 2005.

Looking at http://www.tug.org/texlive/, I understand there 
are 2 differences between the 2:

[PACK] The TeX Live 2005 "live" DVD contains unpacked files,
       while files on the CD are compressed,
and also
[XTRA] The "live" DVD contains extra stuff (proTeXt, MacTeX 
       and a snapshot of CTAN).

I expect the extra material in [XTRA] adds up to a substantial 
amount of data.

Now, looking at http://www.tug.org/ftp/texlive/Images/ I notice:

texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso      02-Nov-2005 01:33   682M
texlive2005-live-20051102.iso      02-Nov-2005 01:11  1293M

DVD image size = 2 x the CD; fine, uncompressed and extra material.

But:

texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso.bz2  27-Nov-2005 02:22   653M
texlive2005-live-20051102.iso.bz2  27-Nov-2005 02:37   587M

After compression, the DVD image becomes smaller than the CD! 
I believe that compressing the image gives better results than 
compressing each file individually, maybe BZ2 offers better 
compression than TAR.GZ/ZIP, but where does the (lots of) [XTRA] 
stuff go? And if after compressing everything, it fits in less 
than 650M, why would be anything left off the CD?

So my question: is there any difference between the 2 
in what files/ directories are included, or it's just the 
compression?


Thanks in advance for any clarification,
Gh Savulescu

    So my question: is there any difference between the 2

The texlive2005-live iso is just the TL part of the DVD image.  It does
not include the protext, mactex, ctan portions.

I don't believe the entire DVD image is online anywhere, as such,
although each piece is available separately.

I'm a bit worried that I am wasting my time with svn (yet again).  I've
checked in the Master tree by now (no Build yet), and an svn update from
the top (with nothing to actually update) takes about five minutes, and
that's on the (basically unloaded) local machine.  Is that going to be
acceptable?  I don't want to put more time into it if not.  (Commits are
fine, updates on partial trees are fine, etc., but the whole-tree update
...)

If anyone would like to try checking it out (anonymously=readonly, I'm
not ready to create accounts yet), try svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk
and let me know how slow (or fast :) it goes.  (If you aren't already
familiar with svn, ignore this, I will have real startup instructions
when the time comes, if it does.)

Although I dislike many things about perforce, perhaps their model of
repository syncing is better suited to such a huge hier as TL.  As far
as I understand it (not that far) p4 sync does not do everything svn
update does, but what it does is enough most of the time.

Thoughts?

P.S. This is using the fsfs filesystem from Hans, and glad of it; the
Berkeley DB backend have caused me nothing but headaches in the past.  I
haven't had any db errors with fsfs.

Hi Karl,
many thanks for all the work you have done to move to svn.  You absolutely 
did not waste your time.  It works perfectly for me:

$ time svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk tl-dev
Checked out revision 1478.

real    118m34.122s
user    0m51.147s
sys     1m24.861s

$ time svn update tl-dev
At revision 1478.

real    0m34.278s
user    0m3.884s
sys     0m1.156s

$ time svn update tl-dev
At revision 1478.

real    0m32.665s
user    0m3.816s
sys     0m1.208s

$ time svn update tl-dev 
At revision 1478.

real    0m31.359s
user    0m3.792s
sys     0m1.272s

$ time svn update tl-dev
At revision 1478.

real    0m31.586s
user    0m3.772s
sys     0m1.308s

Half a minute is totally acceptable for me.

Please do not give up svn.  It's a good thing.  It works good for me.

Maybe your client is not working properly, the svn system itself seems
to work as expected.

BTW., I tried this on my new machine with the svn package provided by
Gentoo.  The DSL download rate is 119 KB/s here (as reported by wget).

Yes, I remember my headaches and I'm quite grateful for the
information provided by Hans.

Many thanks again for everything you have done so far, the time you
spent is definitely not wasted.

Please tell me the total size of the svn directory.  I'm a bit short
of disk space on my Laptop...  The old P4 size of the TeXLive tree
(with only binaries for i386) is around 1.2GByte.  I fear that I need
at least twice as much, right?

update is a bit slower on this (somewhat older, P3@733,

On case insensitive OS (Windows), an error (cannot copy) occurred at
svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-doc/doc/french/epslatex-fr/Danger.eps.
Maybe it is due to the existence of Danger.eps and danger.eps.
Are these files different ones?

That doesn't seem unacceptable to me.  There's no
question but that Subversion is considerably slower
for some operations than Perforce, but that just means
adjusting ones work to a slightly different way of thinking.

It is, because of the server metadata which avoids
a complete local trawl.

I'm doing a complete co over my wireless connection
to my cable connection. I expect it to take hours!

Hi everyone,

Interesting that the svn connection over the net is faster than local
access.  Disk contention maybe.  Anyway, thanks for all the positive
words, and I'll work on importing the Build tree next so we can get
going again.

    Maybe it is due to the existence of Danger.eps and danger.eps.
    Are these files different ones?

It seems they are different.  (Both files exist in perforce too.)

I will have to write to the epslatex-fr author about it.  Thanks for

It seems so.  I copied the tree to my old machine and get:

$ time svn update tl-dev
At revision 1478.

real    3m44.075s
user    0m26.750s
sys     0m9.630s

Obviously disk speed matters.  In your case the head has to move quite
often between the repository and the local copy on your disk.  I
suppose that it would be significantly faster when they are on
different disks.

The bottleneck here (old machine) is the IDE controller which only
supports udma33 while the disk itself provides udma66.

It seems that your result is explainable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Doesn't seem to work. Manually setting DVIPSRC as GW suggested didn't
work either. As far as I can tell, the .dvipsrc file is simply
ignored. And the documentation is not helpful -- it seems to say
unequivocally that the file is to loaded between config.ps and any
command line arguments.

Configuration directory was restricted to $TEXMF/dvips// some day.

In order to use ~/.dvipsrc, search for the following lines in texmf.cnf:

% Dvips' config.* files (this name should not start with `TEX'!).
TEXCONFIG = $TEXMF/dvips//

and change them into

% Dvips' config.* files (this name should not start with `TEX'!).
DVIPSRC = .dvipsrc
TEXCONFIG = $TEXMF/dvips//;$HOME

Subject: [tex-live] ConTeXt documentation in "commercial" products
Message-ID: <86d5ip9680.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hello Hans, hello texlive list,

please take my apologies for bringing this up, but it seems I need to.
According to mreadme.pdf, the documentation is under a different license
than the code, with a "currently" attached to that statement.
Unfortunately, the license chosen for the documentation does not allow
inclusion in TeXLive (and Debian, hence the other Cc).

The problem is the prohibition to use it for commercial purposes.  This
is explained later as

,----
| The non--commercial part is mostly a safeguard. We don't mind if user
| groups distribute printed copies, publish (parts of) manuals and/or if
| authors use example code in manuals and books about ConTEXt.
`----

However, if a bookshop like Lehmann's in Germany creates TeXLive (or
Debian) CD-ROMs and sells them, this is commercial use - even if the
price is hardly more than the production costs, and even if DANTE, the
german user group, gets a bunch of them for free.  After all, the
purpose is to bring customers into the bookshop in the hope they also
buy something else.

On the other hand, I understand that Pragma wants to prevent anyone from
printing and selling a book or booklet with the documentation.  But I
assume that it would be possible to do this without such restrictions.

What do you think?


As for a practical solution, maybe simply using the GPL for the
documentation would maybe already do the trick, since the publisher
would have to provide the source code on the same medium, i.e. written.
I assume it's even possible to declare that the rights granted by the
GPL do not apply to print, or more specifically, to state that the
copyright holder grants and restricts the same rights for any digital
representation (like a PDF file) that the GPL gives for "object code",
but not for any printed representation which isn't covered by the GPL,
anyway.

Dear colleagues,
we think on reorganization of the directory structure in CVS so that the
devanagari package could be easily released for CTAN, TeXLive and other
distributions. I would like to ask what is the correct directory for
documentation. Currently manual.*, README and copying reside in
doc/fonts/devanagr but they document not only fonts but also macros both
for plain TeX and LaTeX. In the near future we will have another README
file for Type 1 fonts. What would be the correct documentation for such
file? The package also contains a few sample files, both as *.dn and
*.pdf. What is correct directory for sample files?

Sincerely,

Zdenek Wagner

Hi Zdenek,

    Currently manual.*, README and copying reside in
    doc/fonts/devanagr but they document not only fonts but also macros 

My impression is that it is better for users if documentation for a
package is in one place, where feasible.  Whether it is
doc/fonts/devanagr or doc/generic/devanagr or whatever does not matter
as much as the doc for the package being together.  Including samples
and README's.  Feel free to make a subdir for samples, e.g.,
doc/fonts/devanagr/demos.

In terms of distribution, the easiest way to incorporate big packages
like this into TL is if they are on CTAN in exactly the final
directories, so all I have to do is copy them.  See, for instance, the
Lucida package I uploaded recently.  (Perhaps devanagr is already like
this, I don't remember.)

Sound reasonable?

Thanks,
Karl

Unfortunatelly not, I have only manually restructured the package for TL.
I would like to have the same directory structure on CVS so that
preparation f releases is simple. I will do it tomorrow.

I agree with this.

I'll look into this when TL has completed the move to SVN (and when I have
moved too).

On the subject of directory structure, is there any way we can settle
down to making the TL* installers use the same default each year? It's a
PITA writing documentation to say that "your TeX system (ie your texmf
directory) is put at /usr/TeX" [or C:\TeX or C:\Program Files\TeXLive\
or whatever] only to have to change it every year (and maintain all the
older versions).

I realise that some circumstances may dictate a change occasionally,
but it looks bad if with one hand we proclaim the virtues of the TDS
internally but can't get our act together on whereabouts to install it
(by default -- obviously a user can choose to put it at /opt/TeX or
G:\myprogs\ if they so wish).

Any chance?

If so, please follow that also for *all* macros, e.g., 
tex/generic/devanagr/
I completelly agree with Karl's good suggestions. As for my taste,
the main contents of devnag package are fonts, other files (macros)
serve mainly as support for using *fonts*. So (perhaps) it would be 
better something like:
doc/fonts/devnag (with a subdirectory for samples)  
tex/latex/
tex/plain/
fonts/ (all the font stuff)

The final decission is in your hands.

Hi Peter,

    down to making the TL* installers use the same default each year? 

The Unix TL installer has used /usr/TeX every year since its inception
(I think) until last year.  So it's not a matter of it warping all
over the map.

I wanted to change it because, first, /usr/TeX seems like totally the
wrong place these days.

Second, having a static path was misleading -- installing release N in
/usr/TeX and then installing release N+1 in the same /usr/TeX has never
been a good idea at all.

The new location is /usr/local/texlive/YYYY, to ameliorate this.
Before, the documentation *recommended* that you change the default to a
path like that.  That seemed dumb, so I proposed changing the default in
the first place.

     "your TeX system (ie your texmf directory) is put at /usr/TeX"

But documentation could never have said that and be correct more than a
tiny fraction of the time.  The default is just the default.  In fact,
everyone I know changed it.

Also, it very much varies by platform -- probably c:\texmf (c:\tex?) is
the most common on windows, /usr/local/teTeX on Mac, and
/usr/{bin,share,...} on Linux (most people run the teTeX that came with
their system, rather than installing TeX Live on their own).

So I'm not sure what can be done here?

    can't get our act together on whereabouts to install it

It doesn't seem like a matter of getting acts together to me; there *is*
no location which will suit a plurality of sites.  In fact, it might be
better to have no default at all :).

    virtues of the TDS

Well, I like the TDS less every day :).

I will add the following sentence to the readme:

If you distribute \CONTEXT\ and related software on electronic media
as part of \TEX\ distributions, you may also distribute the manuals
in electronic form, preferable as provided by the maintainers of
\CONTEXT.

Btw, context documentation is part of the tex collection but not of tex 
live; the reason is that tex live only ships documentation for which a 
source is avaliable (and since there is never the guarantee that a 
source is complete, will run, has all graphic and font resources with 
it, it means that this criterium is hard to meet, i.e. what is a source: 
if i generate an html page from an xml file, it has no source either). 
Technically this means that a pdf file like mreadme.pdf will not be 
distributed. Afaik substantial context documentation and samples (over 
100 meg in pdf form) are no part of linux distributions either. But i 
have absoutely no problems if the manuals are distributed (as long as it 
does not cost me time).

Currently, context manuals are put (stepwise) under svn, and for 
practical purposes it's done on one of our internal machines with a copy 
on taco's website. However, there is no guarantee that each document 
runs as intended (i.e. there are fall backs when i use for instance non 
public fonts, or non public graphics, and i don't provide support for 
that).

At some time I may put a zip archive with the manuals alongside the 
other context zips, but i wonder is there is any interest in those tens 
of megabytes.

BTW, concerning GPL and manuals ... manuals are no programs and i like 
the simple and understandable CC ones; this is also the reason why i use 
the CC GPL variant, because then users (and i) don't have to read and 
understand those tens of pages of legal stuff -)

In that case it's me. I could have sworn that /usr/TeX was new last
year, because my previous install (TL, Linux, 2003) went into 
/usr/local/texmf and I don't think I asked for that.

It absolutely is, which is why I was astonished at anyone choosing it.
It flies completely in the face of the accepted norm (/usr/local).
At least we're not doing an IBM and insisting it goes in /opt :-)

Umm. Installing in /path/to/app-x.y and softlinking the current version
to /usr/local/whatever is a fairly standard practice though.

This is a big improvement (and doing away with the caps is good too).

On Linux, sure. The real problem comes with Windows users.

The Windows users I have spoken to about this are baffled that it's
not in C:\Program Files where everything else is. But given the probs
with spaces in file paths (make you go bald, teeth fall out, lower
the libido, start nuclear wars, etc) it's understandable. What the
users don't understand is why TeX systems have problems with filepaths
containing spaces. Or other random punctuation.

    since there is never the guarantee 

Guarantees aren't necessary, in my mind.  With context, there is
probably no way to guarantee that anyone can ever get exactly the same
result as you unless they come over to your office and duplicate your
disks :).  (Probably not even that would be enough.)

The main point of free documentation is to allow, in principle, someone
who makes changes to the free software it describes to also update the
documentation.  Distributing pdf's doesn't allow that.  Making a
good-faith effort to distribute sources (even if not necessarily
complete / guaranteed to run) does.

Any interest in reconsidering?

    if i generate an html page from an xml file, it has no source either). 

If you generate an html page from an xml file, the xml file is the
source.

    understand those tens of pages of legal stuff -)

Well, the GPL is five pages typeset, but your point remains the same :).

>From my point of view for TL, what I care about is having the *same*
name in the various parts of the tree:
tex/whatever/packagename
doc/whatever/packagename
fonts/tfm/whatever/whatever/packagename
fonts/type1/whatever/whatever/packagename

And so on.  The crucial thing is that everything in a directory
"packagename" belongs to the same package.  If some directories for a
given package are named "foo" and others named "bar" (as is too often
the case), it is a pain to deal with.

Therefore, if you want to call the package "velthuis" instead of
"devanagr" and make all the packagename directories be "velthuis",
that's ok with me.  If you want to make subdirectories under "devanagr"
named velthuis, that too is ok (you can make subdirs named anything you
want, it doesn't matter to the tools).  What would be difficult is if
some packagename directories are named velthuis, others named devanagr,
others named wikner, or whatever.

Hope this makes sense.  If you care to make up a proposed directory
layout (before actually making all the changes in your repo), I'd be
very happy (grateful in fact) to take a look.

    Also, can we use 'devanagari' instead of 'devanagr', or are we still 
    restricting filename lengths to eight characters?

There is no problem with names > 8 chars.  Feel free to use "devanagari"
if you wish.

i'd say: write a new or additional manual -)

btw, the fact that tex distributions seems to differ slightly (just read 
messages on the context list about installing tex on linux) does not 
mean that those who change things also document things; in the end the 
questions come to the source of the program ...

also, if users take pieces of manuals, rewrite it, make better manuals 
... fine for me, as long as no-one bothers me ... my main point is that 
i don't want to be responsible for that and that i don't want to let 
users be confused about what version is 'the real one'

>Any interest in reconsidering?

well, for a while now context users can download sources of manuals 
(more will follow) from our svn repository; if they change and patch 
fine, as long as they don't  let it end up in the commercial publication 
domain (and thereby entering a real copyright mess); guess why i never 
published one of the manuals as book: i want copies to be freely 
available. I leave it to others to do that and as the licence says: 
potential authors are free to use the examples for that purpose (it's 
actually one of the reasons for making them available).

i bet that there are pdf's (and maybe html's) in texlive with no sources -)

(anyhow, as an escape one can always use pdftotext and then claim that 
he/she has clever macros that can turn the resulting text file into a 
nicely typeset pdf file)

On the other hand it is "language support".

Is it a matter of taste?  If it is, something is wrong.  In the main
texmf trees we have tex/{generic,plain,latex,context,...} and I think
that if a package provides TeX macros and fonts, people search for
documentation about TeX macros, not for documentation about fonts.

A LaTeX user expects documentation for Polish in doc/latex and not in
doc/fonts though the fonts consume more disk space than the macro
packages.

I think that people want support for a particular language and expect
that the system provides the needed fonts.

The only reason to have doc/fonts is that there are so many *latin*
fonts.  That's a problem indeed.  But the existence of this directory
is quite illogical.  Is there any file at all which describes a font
itself rather than a macro package?

Zdenek, I'm aware that changing anything can cause trouble.  But I
don't see any good reason any more to stick with the 8.3 naming scheme
for filenames.  There is no maintained TeX distribution supporting a
system which has such a restriction.  So why not change the directory
names from "devanagr" to  "devanagari"?  And why not provide a file

dev.sty
________________________
\typeout{...}
\input{devanagari.sty}
________________________

for a while.

Compatibility is a good thing.  But do we want to have the crappy 8.3
names in 100 years?   If not, what is the difference between changing
it now or changing it in 100 years?

The name "devanagr" is quite ugly and hard to remember.  "dev.sty" is
quite convenient for lazy people like me, but...

  Reinhard

Hi Peter,
texlive can be installed everywhere.  Don't know whether you write
documentation for your local users or an article for TUGboat, but if
you want to tell people where particular files reside, why not write
an article about programs like kpsewhich.  The man pages are not very
good and an article in TUGboat would certainly be quite appreciated.

Well, here is a problem, but "generic" is OK for all formats.

OK. So fonts+macros are well deposed in generic/devnag . I can only add:
do not put .fd and .sty files into tex/latex/devnag. That's the point.

Hmm, why not, if we have so many _font packages_ not related only
to LaTeX? For years I've corrected so many packages for TL, which was 
first declared as _latex_ packages (completelly wrong, as Hans can use them
in ConTeXt, and Jacko and me in Plain :-)

No. Language specific macros should go into latex/foo or plain/foo
It is not a case of devnag, as it contains support for several language
scripts.

If I want to insert some words in Tibethan in the Polish text? Sorry,
but devnag seems to me european (sorry, latin) oriented.

Well, I can use (hapilly) so many fonts without worrying about
any .sty or .fd files :-)

Dear colleagues

There were several comments on the directory structure for Velthuis
Devanagari. I am afraid that I would mess the things if I tried to merger
the e-mails and quote them. I will therefore try to make some summary.

First I should  mention that non-member postings to
Devnag-general@lists.sarovar.org are not allowed and wait for moderator
approval. I approved all of them a few hours ago but we live in different
timezones. Some developers thus have not read the mails yet.

Velthuis Devanagari is based on Latin input because regular TeX cannot
read multibyte characters without use of active characters. This is not a
good solution. Previous versions of the package made use of active
characters but it caused conflicts with MusixTeX and ArabTeX. Reading
multibyte characters can be implemented with encTeX but I am not sure that
it is available in all distributions. Moreover, there are users of this
package in India. I know of a few of them who asked us for help.

The package provides both macros for language support and fonts. The fonts
themselves cannot be used without those macros and the preprocessor and
the macros are bound to the fonts. The LaTeX style emulates some babel
features, it defines Hindi texts for \contentsname, \chaptername, \today
etc. Everything is dokumented in a single document and a few samples are
added. It contains both plain TeX and LaTeX support, i.e. all macro files
must not be in the same directory. We should follow the search paths for
the formats.

Let's assume that XXX is the package name. We will decide whether it is
velthuis or devanagari or whatever.

The directories for font files would be:
fonts/map/dvips/XXX/dvng.map
fonts/afm/public/XXX/   (for .afm)
fonts/source/public/XXX/  (for .mf)
fonts/tfm/public/XXX/  (for .tfm)
fonts/type1/public/XXX/  (for .pfb)

LaTeX macro files will be in
tex/latex/XXX/

plain TeX macros in:
tex/plain/XXX/

documentation and samples in
doc/generic/XXX/

The LaTeX package may be devanagari.sty but I would implement dev.sty in
the following way (so that laTeX internals know what's going on):

\ProvidesPackage{dev}[YYYY/MM/DD Loading devanagari.sty]
\DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToPackage{\CurrentOption}{devanagari}}
\ProcessOptions
\RequirePackage{devanagari}

Is this OK?

Question mainly for devnag developers:
Should XXX be:

1. velthuis
2. devanagari/velthuis

Thank you Zdenek and Karl for your work on getting the devnag package into 
tex-live.

Can we somehow specify 'velthuis' in the directory structure? I 
requested such a change a while ago in CTAN so that the devnag package now 
resides under 'language/devanagari/velthuis/'. I requested this with the 
intent of eventually moving the wikner package from 'sanskrit' to 
'devanagari'. This existing taxonomy is a bit confusing.

Also, can we use 'devanagari' instead of 'devanagr', or are we still 
restricting filename lengths to eight characters?

Anshu

That's a good idea.  I've long had separate Velthuis and Wikner 
directories under devanagari on my machine, to keep things clear.

The same is true for tex-live (and all tug lists).  Has to be that way
these days, as we all know ...

    Is this OK?

It all looks fine to me.

I don't understand.  Why do you want to put fonts to generic/devnag?
And why do you want .sty files not to be in tex/latex/devnag?  They
can contain arbitrary latex code.  I wonder whether all .fd files
should better be moved to tex/generic because they can be used by
plnfss.  Does Context understand .fd files as well?

When .sty files can be used by latex and plain tex they should
go to tex/generic.  But it is not the case for all .sty files.

I talked about documentation, not about macros.

If you want Tibetan or Arabic or Chinese or Vietnamese, just put the
TeXLive-CD into the drive and select the languages you need in the
install menu.  I don't think that people should care about fonts.  It
should be obvious that the fonts will be provided.

Hello,

I installed the Win32 distribution but couldn't get it to work because
lack of expertise. I didn't know how to enable the "extra" directories
and then sample.tex didn't work out of the box like it does with Miktex.
Dan Luecking who likes the fpTeX-like functionality was kind enough
to explain how he fixed a few problems. I am reinstalling Win32 now,
and have decided to give it a whirl since there have been some pointers.
Originally, I didn't think this was a suitable distribution for Win users
who are new to both (La)Tex and WinLyX, now officially supported.
I suppose this group of newish users would be better off with ProText.
The new installer works really well!

"What TeXLive2005 _appears_ to have done, is take xemtex and
add the missing programs, but recompiled and/or relinked to the
new DLLs when necessary.

I found it worked out-of-the-box for my mode of use on one
computer, but required editing modes.mf (changing localfont
from ljfour to jetiiisi on the other).

Three small problems:
1. the intallation program allowed some customization. When I chose
one of these a dialogue window popped up. But every time the mouse
cursor strayed over the main window, it (the main window) rose to the
top, covering the dialogue. This started out confusing (the dialogue
seemed to have disappeared), then became merely annoying when I
figured out what was happening.

2. One can select any of several schemes to install. To be on the safe
side I installed more than I needed and tried to delete things I
didn't need. To my suprise, most of the texmf-dist and texmf-doc trees
were read-only. This was an annoyance, especially for some
configuration files that needed to be edited (modes.mf, for example).

3. A third problem just surfaced, involving updmap. I tested and found
that the previous (2004) version of TeXLive had the same problem (2003
did not, but it had a different problem).

The problem is in updmap and the dvipdfm_ndl14.map it produces.

Dvipdfm requires a .pfb _file_name when a font is embedded, and seems
to require a _font_name when the font is not embedded. The
dvipdfm_ndl14.map that updmap produces fails to include either a
filename (correct) or a fontname (incorrect). When
dvipdfmDownloadBase14 = false in updmap.cfg, dvipdfm.map is equal to
dvipdfm_ndl14.map. With the fontnames omitted, dvipdfm tries to call
gsftopk and embed a type3 font.

The solution is to always embed all fonts (make sure
dvipdfmDownloadBase14 = true in updmap.cfg).

The eps to pdf conversion does fail out of the box, but that seems to
be because dvipdfm can't take PDF higher than version 1.3. One needs
to change the config file so that the eps to pdf conversion process
(the line beginning with D) produces version 1.3 or lower. I use
  D "epstopdf --outfile=%o --nocompress %i"
in config and edit epstopdf.pl (which produces 1.4 by default on my
system). Instead of editing epstopdf.pl, one could
  set GS_OPTIONS=-dCompatibilityLevel=1.2
on the command line or use a gs command in config that sets the level:
  D "gswin32c.exe -q -sPAPERSIZE=letter -sDEVICE=pdfwrite
-dCompatibilityLevel=1.2 -dUseFlateCompression=true -dNOPAUSE
-sOutputFile=%o %i -c quit"
(all on one line). Problems can occur "out of the box" because the
out-of-the-box config file has incorrect quoting for windows. The
config-win provided (copy it to config) uses epstopdf. Using dvipdfm's
-vv option quickly showed me where the problem lied (in the pdf
version produced by epstopdf).

I remove quoting around the file names (%o and %i) in config's D
option, and never use filenames or paths with spaces in them.

Miktex's dvipdfm used to get this wrong consistently also.

Hope this helps those out there who have problems with this.

I never use dvipdfm without manually producing pdf from eps where
necessary (using tools that get the PDF version right)."

Not that the work is finished .. but a big step is taken.

Thanks again and all the best

No, fonts must be in the fonts/... tree because updmap, dvips, pdftex and
other programs expect them to be there.

No, we have LaTeX macros which will be under tex/latex/ and plain macros
which will be under tex/plain/. Remember that the fonts cannot be used
without these special macros and without the devnag preprocessor. ConTeXt
does not understand .fd files, font support is done in a different way.
However, I have never used ConTeXt and I do not know how to incorporate
Velthuis Devanagari into it. Maybe somebody else could do it.

That's what I want to achieve. TL works like that with Velthuis Devanagari
too, and always did so, but the directory structure on our CVS is
different. The same holds for the release on CTAN. It means that the
directory structure must be reorganized. Similarly, if some distribution
does not contain Velthuis Devanagari and a user takes it from CTAN, he or
she must manually copy the files to correct directories. Now we would like
to make the developers' work easier and less prone to human errors and
help those who take the package from CTAN. We plan to change the dirctory
structure on CVS and I disliked that documentation in TL was under
doc/fonts/devanagr... I think that doc/generic/velthuis would be better.
The users need not care where the macros reside if everything works, only
developers will care.

Subject: [tex-live] svn timestamps too new
Message-ID: <200601232246.k0NMkEq10764@f7.net>

Next svn question: turns out that svn does not store mtimes.  It stores
commit times, on a per-revision basis.  What this means is that all the
files in the tree have a timestamp of late December/early January
instead of their "real" modification time (years old, in many cases).

The "per-revision basis" means that, in practice, it's not possible to
fix the mtimes with the current tree.  In most cases I checked in
hundreds or thousands of files at a time, so I see little point in
"choosing" an mtime for all files in each set of committed files.

So, to fix this, I'd have to start over with a new tree, and commit the
files essentially one at a time, changing the mtimes afterwards.

My question is, is it worth it?  I'm inclined to say no, that we can
live with the checkin time as the "starting" mtime.  But I wanted to
mention it, so you-all weren't surprised when you saw the files were all
"new".

There will be some agony with the Makefiles, I'm sure, but I think that
can be dealt with.  (My next step is try a test build, anyway, so I'll
see how bad it is.)

Below is the mail from an svn person on which I'm basing this.

Thanks,
Karl

The repository does not store mtimes at all. It only stores the  
commit time.


You can change the commit time after the fact, if you install a pre- 
revprop-change hook allowing such changes. Simply set the svn:date  
property of the revision. Note that the date applies to the entire  
revision, not to individual files. If you want to be able to set the  
date of individual files, you must commit them in individual revisions.


Another option: There is the unofficial meta-data-versioning branch  
of Subversion which tracks file mtimes among other things, if you're  
interested in putting that together and building it.

I do not know svn, I just guess: cvs has an option for import to use
mtimes as an initial commit time. Isn't there similar option in svn?

I think that xemtex (my version) does not function like fptex or
Cygwin->tetex for Windows, which is why Dan liked it ->Win32.
I don't mean at a very general level, but like why Protex differs from 
Win32. Something must have been added to produce fptex functionality.
The user perceives what the program works like, not how many
files were carried over from xemtex and so evaluates the change.
I think Tomasz Luczak did the installer for Win32. Who modified
the functionality to appear more like fptex? Were fptex files used as a
basis, or were the files newly conceived? Outside of including Windvi.

Stephen

Doesn't it cost you more time if people don't have the (up-to-date)
documentation installed along with their TeX distribution, find some old
version somewhere on the net and start asking stupid questions?

Oh, font replacements wouldn't be a big problem; graphics without
"sources" (the preferred form of modification) probably would be.  But
if you start putting this in the public, maybe we'll end up with a
distributable source of the ConTeXt documentation sooner or later, even
if it's impossible now.

The point is that as a general rule, we want to be able to modify the
documentation.  Imagine me writing FKonTeXt, with some of the internal
defaults changed to suit my and other's special needs - I think it'd be
much better if I could provide the users with a correct manual for
FKonTeXt, instead of just a "these are the differences to ConTeXt,
besides that read the ConTeXt docs".  

> BTW, concerning GPL and manuals ... manuals are no programs and i like

I'm not sure, and I'm not a legal guy, too; but it seems to me that the
CC licenses without any commercial restriction would be okay provided
that the source is available.

This is a worthwile goal, but I fear it must be enforced rather by
social pressure than by law.  And the CC license you chose doesn't
enforce it, anyway.

I won't bet against this; but we are about to start a big "check the
docs" effort for the Debian packages (of texlive and teTeX), and will
approach all the authors where no source is available.

nowadays most users consult the up to date wiki and from there look 
further; older distributions (i.e. sysadms not willing to update the 
system) is a bigger pain; also, most context users update on a regular 
basis (because they want to use the latest pdftex trickery or fonts or 
have asked for features) and again the wiki is then the place to find 
examples.

as said, if distributions take those sources and add them, it's ok for me

(btw, for a long time the tex book source code was distributed with the 
restriction that one might not publish them; this was ok for most users 
an dit was a nice resource; the same is true for some fonts: personally 
i don;t care that i may not change them, as long as i may use them, so 
in the end it's the users who pay the price for a too strict selection)

hm, i must say that upto now i never saw a manual (to some big piece of 
software) that was such an adaption; actually, there are not that many 
systems that ship with over 100 meg of documentation and samples; in 
most cases one ends up with buying a book (and in addition a pdf file 
for online viewing); so, in practice, context users are not that bad off;

we'll see what happens in te long run, for the moment i like the  cc  
licence  because i can understand it; actually, when someone told me 
that the gpl licence gets renewed and that one should really have a 
close look, i already got the uncomfortable feeling that i'd to look 
into the matter again since the context source code comes with a 
cc-wrapped gpl licence

[actually, for emotional reasons i'd rather not that users use the same covers since i consider them part of the context look and feel; for the same reasons i stimulate users to make their own styles just in order not to get this 'documents that scream tex/context'; too many coding samples make users lazy; also, to bring manual source code in such a state that users can learn something from it (which is my objective), take quite some effort and 'clean source code' is one of my conditions for making them available]

i dunno; it's not a very strict restriction (i could havetaken a more strict one) 

anyhow, the restrictions in the licence only concerns making money out of printed manuals (if someone delivers a copy for printing cost that's ok); if someone wants to write books using examples in the source code of the manuals, fine; fyi: i have no plans to make any money from the manuals or documentation myself either: (1) i'm no brilliant writer, (2) it does not pay off, (3) i prefer putting stuff on the web for free, (4)  lack of time anyway, (5) that way i can make them the way i want]

You are aware that the Creative Commons Deed is just a wrapper around
the "real" GPL?  You didn't include it in mreadme.pdf, but on the
website (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/) it says:

,----
| This is a human-readable summary of the Legal Code (the full <a
| href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Gener al Public
| License). 
`----

If you click on "Disclaimer", you get

"This Deed itself has no legal value".  So it seems in your
(understandable) desire to make things understandable for mere mortals,
you went one step too far.

If you look at the GPL text, it instructs you how to indicate that a
work is licensed under it, and this includes saying either "GPL, version
2.0" or "GPL, version 2.0 or later".  You have the choice (and of course
as the copyright holder, you can always change the version number or add
the "or later" if you later want to).

That's perfectly acceptable, it's just not how I (and Debian, and
texlive) define Free Documentation for Free Software.  But you are not
in bad company, RMS himself thinks that Documentation does not need the
same freedoms as software.

I understand; but the text of the license, even if it's not your
intention, forbids inclusion of the manuals, original or modified, on a
CD that is sold in a shop, which is commercial even if that particular
CD might cost only the production price.

When I said
"add the missing programs, but recompiled and/or relinked to the
     new DLLs when necessary"
I meant the _added_ programs were (re)compiled/(re)linked.

That is, one cannot directly include old binaries from fptex that are
not in xemtex because the DLLs have been changed since the most recent
fptex. One would need to recompile them against the new DLLs (and
possibly add a missing DLL or two). So I was only saying I assumed that
that was what had been done.

yeah, i need to look into that (for the moment i assume that 3 will be 
ok; the only problem i'm told of is that it's tricky to afterwards stick 
to an older version)

There's not even a link to the "full thing", so I doubt that any judge
would accept that the GPL applies.

Yes, you mention this, but one cannot find out what "the whole thing"
is.  There's a Deed for the GPL on Creative Commons' website, but also
there, there's no version information (except in the URL, but that has
no legal value either).  So a user cannot reliably find out which
version was on CC's site when you wrote your text.

copied from the pdf at the web site:

We?re not going to fill n pages with legal stuff, so if you want to know 
more, you have
to consult the web for the legalities mentioned. Here are a few starting 
points:

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/legalcode
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/legalcode

to me this is as good as a reference to some article in a law or whatever

(btw, cc has a nice site and i have a weak spot for that)

hm, if it means that someone always has to include the whole lot ... bad thing; in whatever law environment one can point to an article in a law, so why not with a GPL; actually, if a copy is really needed, then i need a second lifetime in order to read all instances in the software (each file) i use since one can have made a typo; lucky us that it's english and we don't have an encoding problem as well -) 

If I buy something in a shop, references to whatever legal things involved are just references, actually, some of the law is implicit, so my bet is that a reference to GPL is pretty sound; if not, even if someone violates it with respect to context, i'll not seek the courtroom anyway (up to day i never saw one inside and i want to keep it that way) 

I trust you guys to include a copy of the GPL someplace in the zips or media.

Oh, yes - I didn't spot these since I expected the license links at the
bottom of the "Deed" as it is on Creative Common's web site;  I guess
it's okay that way.

I'm not sure.

That would at least save you from the question which version was
intended, in case CC switches to GPL v 3

Hi all,

A TL2005 user working on a Linux Debian Sarge platform reports that the

For instance, instead of

he gets a non executable file:

BTW, other links in texmf/doc/man/man1 and in texmf-dist/doc/ also fail

Subject: [tex-live] here.sty missing from TeXLive 2005
Message-ID: <1138274026.7214.10.camel@pc118>

David Carlisle's package here.sty (which adds the 'H' option to the
figure environment, meaning "put the float here") was present in TeXLive
2004 (texmf-dist/tex/latex/ltxmisc/here.sty) but is not in TeXLive 2005
(with that name). It is also no longer in CTAN - which is the immediate
reason for why I suppose it is no longer in TeXLive. Is there an
underlying reason, however?

I thought of the possibility that the figure environment might now add
'H' to its list of positional specifiers, but a quick check shows that
not to be true.

Of course, I could recommend to the users here that they use package
float instead (it provides the specifier 'H') - but I know that they'll
ask why they should alter many years of papers written in LaTeX.

For the minute, I'll just carry here.sty across into texmf-local.

The same functionality is now included in float.sty.

Right.

I too was distressed that backward compatibility was broken in such a
major way, but I guess that was David's decision.

    For the minute, I'll just carry here.sty across into texmf-local.

Sensible, until the day it stops working for whatever reason, I guess.

Maybe a wrapper here.sty that just inputs float, if it's new enough,
could be constructed somehow?  I don't know.

bzip.org (not that you care, I know).

    Is there any /real/ reason why ZIP compression (which is
    universally understood) cannot be used rather than the obscure

iso's are already compressed; I don't think the

significant, whereas bz reduces by a some number of megabytes, as I
recall.  Been a while since I looked at the numbers.

You don't say what platform you're on.  The Unix installer of the live
version has always been slow (ironically enough, the inst installer is
faster); I didn't think it was especially worse this year than before.
I cannot speak to Windows.

Dear Robin/all -- Khanh didn't answer my message as to where her
("our") copy of TeX Live 2005 might be, so rather than waste Robin's
time and TUG's postal budget, I downloaded a copy and burnt a
DVD for myself.  I /would/ have downloaded from CTAN had there
been any useful information as to how to un-BZ2 it, but there
was none, so I downloaded the straight ISO file from Aarhus.
Is there any /real/ reason why ZIP compression (which is
universally understood) cannot be used rather than the obscure
"BZ2" compression method ?

My main comment concerns the /unbelievably/ long time it took
to install (compared to previous releases).  Yes, I chose the
"full" option, but then deselected all language other than
English, CJK & Vietnamese and removed any packages I didn't
want (e.g., Ghostscript, Pictures, TeXinfo, ...), so what I was
installing should have been comparable to what I have installed
previously.  As far as I could judge, it was between five and
ten times slower than the previous installer.  Is this a known
issue, and are there any plans to improve installation speed ?

I /do/ care : why does the note that says you /really/ shouldn't
download the ISO not point the user at Bzip.org ?

I'll ZIP it on my home m/c (don't have WinZIP on the office m/c
yet) and see how it compares (in size) to the BZ2 offering.

Ah, I sometimes forget that not yet everyone in the world has
forsaken VMS for Windows :-)))  Windows XP/PRO, 3.2MHz, 2Gb,
unfragmented discs with 2 spindles and 8 x 32Gb partitions, all 
virtually empty.

OK, I cc'd the TeX-Live list; perhaps the Windows installer authors
will be able to shed some light.

Since you install the whole lot, isn't copying the texmftrees in the regular way faster then? I always do it that way.

Not /that/ inferior.  BZ2 compression produces a 587Mb file;
WinZIP produces one of 616 Mb.  The difference is so small
that I really cannot see that it matters, whereas the universal
comprehensibility of ZIP compression is a strong argument
for its adoption in preference to BZ2.

There was a time when I eschewed installers completely, but
as time passed I became at first indifferent to their use
and finally addicted.  I have now reached the last sad stage,
and no longer remember how to do without them :-(((

Then it is a networking problem on your side, here the page shows up.
And for asking where it is, please use google "I'm feeling lucky"  and
you are there ... including windows binaries.

    BZ2 compression produces a 587Mb file;
    WinZIP produces one of 616 Mb.

Maybe 29MB is not significant to you.  It is to lots of other people.

    comprehensibility of ZIP compression is a strong argument for its
    adoption in preference to BZ2.

You are the first person I can recall who complained about being unable
to use the .bz2 files.  No doubt there are others who simply didn't
report their problems, but, overall, I don't think it's our job to
explain every piece of software involved.  We want to encourage people

I think the reason for that endless installation is the speed of
your computer. Nowadays 3.2MHz isn't enough to run Windows :-)

I've just burnt a second copy (at home) and it manifests
the same symptoms as my office copy : it doesn't autoplay.
Looking at the file structure, there seems to be one
unnecessary level of indirection, with everything being
dumped in a directory "texlive" rather than at the top-
level, as a result of which (I think), Windows doesn't
see "Autorun.inf".  Is this an error in the ISO file ?

Me included. I don't have anything personal against bzip2 except that
it's unheard-of, unusual, and non-standard. Granted, it's on my FC4
machines, but TeX CD/DVD images are the only things that I ever use
it for, so I have to RTFM every year to remember what to type. Goddess
help the poor individual user.

It doesn't bother me now, having got used to it, but it's hard to
explain to technically-sophisticated people that using bzip2 does *not*
make others go "oooh, that's clever/sensible", it makes them go
"goddammit why can't they follow standard practice". We have enough
problems as it is, explaining to newcomers why LaTeX isn't like Word,
and adding a non-standard compression method just accentuates the
problem.

Bzip2 *does* compress better, but 30Mb out of 600Mb is 5%, which is IMHE
*much* less than the increasingly common degradation in download speed
encountered by the average broadband user on a contentious connection --
in other words your domestic connection is more likely to be a cause of
slowdown than is a 5% difference in file size. Users on corporate and
campus networks have bandwidth coming out of their ears, so it's
irrelevant; and users on dialup aren't going to download DVD images.

In any case, \begin[linux]{snobbery}gzip is far preferable to
[pk/win]zip\end{snobbery}\smiley.

True, otherwise we'd be explaining to them how to click on a mouse
button as well. A certain level of grok is expected. I just think bz2
is a little over the edge (but not enough to want to change it if there
are compelling technical reasons for staying with it that I am unaware
of).

> We want to encourage people
> to join user groups, after all.

We also want to encourage them to download the image...

It could also be the way Windows seems to copy files. I know it was 
apparent in the days of MS-DOS and Win95, and I was told it had all
changed in 2k/NT/XP, but every time I see a big install on Windows,
it seems to spend an inordinate amount of time just copying. Is it
still using some stupid DOS copy code underneath?

Phil, you have my deepest sympathy for having Windows foisted on you
after VMS (assuming it was foisted :-)

I absolutely agree with Karl.

And I absolutely agree with the phrase "I don't think it's our
job...".  

I think that even Windows users are smart enough to pass an error
message to google when they don?t know how to proceed.  And it should
not be too difficult to install software which can extract tar.bz2
files even under Windows.

The compression algorithm ZIP uses is amazingly inefficient if a lot
of small files are involved (for instace the tex4ht font files).  In
certain cases zip files are ten times larger than tar.bz2 files.

Sticking with ZIP is as annoying as sticking with 8.3 filenames.
Sorry, but in which world do we live today?

Efficiency of compression algorithms does not matter very much if you
have DSL (and maybe even a flatrate).  But many people have to live
with their slow and expensive internet connection.

You certainly will not understand what I mean unless you had been in
Vietnam (12 PCs connected to a single voice modem in an internet cafe
in Sa Pa).

Regards,
  Reinhard

In fact it is not stand-alone ISO, but part of a greater one DVD
distributed as "TeX Collection 2005". However you can use it,
as described in the documentation (run tlpmgui directly, etc.).

We know that "live" installs sloooowly on Windows. Pawe? Jackowski
adapted the program just befere a release and it uses standard Windows'
xcopy :(. Sorry for that, but you know: no time, no help from 
anybody else, etc.
Please use "inst" TL version which installs quite fast.

All the best,

come on, guys, get a life. bzip2 has been around for
_ages_, is good and efficient. I use it all the time,
its not rocket science to type "bz2" into google

Why do people only regard things Microsoft provides as a standard?

bzip2 is a standard for many years now.  It?s a pity that (some)
Windows users are not aware of it.

Maybe bandwidth comes out of your ears, but this is certainly not the

same sloooowness on my Linux PC. The sound of the DVD during install was
that it was constantly positioning the head back and forth, seems for
any individual file. So the slowdown here might be just by the sum of
these many positionings. Could this be an issue in the install script,
that some auxiliary install file at the other end of the DVD must always
be read before extracting any zip file?

When I still used a Windows installation (up to around 2001), one of the
first things to do was always to install a archive program.  I very soon
switched from illegally using WinZIP without registration to using a
free alternative - forgot the name, but it should be easy to find -, and
this application did understand bz2.  Googling for "windows zip bz2
free" gives lots of hits, some sounding like free-as-in-beer, some
-as-in-speech, but I can't see the problem.

Just returned from there, Reinhard (Viet Nam, I mean, not
Sa Pa on this occasion); ADSL ubiquitous :-)  But no-one
in Vietnam is going to try to download the TeX Live DVD from
an Internet cafe in Sa Pa, nor would anyone in their right
mind try to download it with less than broadband, in which
case 587Mb v. 616Mb is a noise-level difference.

And I absolutely disagree with both.  If you use standard utilities,
I accept there is no reason to document them; if you use something
as non-standard as BZ2, then there is every reason to document it.

The instructions tell them not to bother if they don't know how
to proceed.  That's gratuitously offensive and will lead to
others doing what I did : downloading the ISO file at great
cost to everyone because no clue is given as to how to undo
BZ2 compression.

Chr1st, you're now telling me that under the BZ2 there's another level
of indirection ?  This is insane.  ZIP compression does both
seamlessly.

But overall, on TeX Live Live, the difference is less than 5%.
noise-level, IMHO.

A world in which ZIP compression is uniquitous and BZ2 niche.
That's the /real/ world, Reinhard, not some ideallistic view
of how it might be.

And they should /not/ be downloading the TeX Live ISO if that is all
they have; the probability of success is (I estimate) less than 1%
over a 56K modem.

(1) in that case you'd have to install gzip instead of bzip which does 
not change the problem
(2) gzip operates on one file (pipe) while zip is able to create an 
archive of files (so, zip is a replacement for tar+gzip, but you know 
that -)

btw, on windows using winrar will solve most compression/archive problems

 (a happy user of zip, although the public version is inferior to the 
good old pkzip one because that one had better selective zipping options 
built in)

there can be several reasone:

(1) xp uses a journaling file system (and unless you use xfs or reiser 4 
on unix, journaling slows down there as well)
(2) all filenames have to be uncoded

The unicode aspect is also the reason why kpsewhich on windows is slow: 
after loading the database all names need to be converted to unicode and 
comparison be done at that level; this is why on windows kpse is a 
deamon which then makes it fly (esp when system calls are made from tex 
to other tex related programs)

'even under 'windows' ... actually installing software is seldom a 
problem under windows, not much more than under any other os (somehow 
each time when i install a unix server i have to install afterwards 
programs like unzip, wget, etc, so in the end it al boils down to soem 
user intervention)

i often do z double zip:

zip -9 two

well, zip can make archives of files; being accustomed to zip, i always

it may have to do with the speed; compressing big files using bzip is so 
much slower that one will stick to zip

also, it has never been integrated in an archiver (like zip -bz or so)

also, in most cases, incoming is fast, but outgoing slow, so for posting  files it makes sense as well

could indeed be a reason; depending on your setup, windows can first index the file, which then should speed up reading

so, how about putting at the place where the iso is downloaded bunzip's binaries for win|lin|mac ?

WinZip 9 and 10 should be able to uncompress bzip2.

PKZip is able to uncompress bzip2.

The free 7-Zip (--> www.7-zip.org) is able zu uncompress bzip2.

There are more usual zip/unzip programms that know bzip2.

So, what's the problem you are discussing about? The WinXP explorer cannot 
open/decompress bzip2 on it`s own. That's not a real problem, because on 
almost every magazine CD you may find an unzipper that can.

And do you know why its enviroment contains OS2LIBPATH? That's because it
borrows from OS/2 by IBM. That's why 16bit OS/2 applications work in
Windows and some command-line 32bit applications work if you have RSX
installed. Maybe OS/2 version of bzip2 works in Windows... (I have not
tried).

Does this, or the new Creative Commons license, also apply to older
versions, in particular to the version included in teTeX 3.0?  In this
case we (Debian) could distribute the ConTeXt documentation in our
non-free section (still non-free because we don't have the sources
currently).  And I wouldn't like to use the new version's documentation
(with its CC license) and bundle it with the ConTeXt version in teTeX
3.0, since that would cause confusion.  That's why I specifically ask
whether this applies to the old version, too.

With older i assume that you mean the pdf's (we started putting manual sources under svn recently)? Sure go ahead and distribute them. I don't think there was even any restriction in distributing the pdf's at least not from my side (they have been in the tex collections in separate trees anyway). The whole licencing issue with respect to manual sources is mostly there because it concerns sources.

It wouldn't occur to me that .bz2 is "obscure" to some people, but I
spend as liitle time as possible on Win32.   I agree with Hans that
bzip2 binaries (or links) should be provided in the directory with the
.iso.bz2 files.

Was the disk fragmented?  This seems to be a big problem with NTFS.
Win32 users expect to rebuilt systems from scratch early and often, so
install speed matters.  Linux installs are done rarely so speed is
less of an issue.

I have now done a number of installs of TL2005 for linux+irix using
linux (via the script) and Win32 for Win32 (using the GUI), mostly on
a batch of identical 2GHz P4 machines, but also on 600 mhz PIII linux
machine.  The Win32 install takes much longer but not more than 2-3x
longer (NTFS disks were defragmented before installing).  I attribute
this to McAfee, but different files are needed (e.g., ghostscript on
Win32, linux+irix binaries on Linux).

    a copy of the "TeX Collection 2005" DVD, is there a
    single ISO file that I need or several ?  

The exact image as burned on the DVD distributed by the user groups is
not (and has never been) available.  You could ask Manfred for it if you
really insist.  He's the only one who's ever had it (or needed it).

    I do not know how to merge them : Nero assumes
    1 ISO -> 1 DVD ...

So, my suggestion (which you probably won't like) is, don't bother going
to all this trouble.  Instead, do what is easy: if you want TeX Live,
download TeX Live.  If you want proTeXt, download proTeXt.  If you want
MacTeX, download MacTeX.  If, for some crazy reason, you want CTAN, then
set up a CTAN mirror.

Best,
karl

This is actually rather interesting, I had a user who came and complained 
about this very thing, pdftex producing different margins than TeX.

When has this changed? I don't use plain TeX or pdfTeX myself so I haven't 
noticed. The user in question claims that his document worked fine under 
both systems in TL 2004.

<quote>
- \pdfhorigin (dimension) 
This parameter can be used to set the horizontal offset the
output box from the top left corner of the page. A value of 1
inch corresponds to the normal TeX offset.  This parameter is
read when pdfTeX starts shipping out a page to the pdf output. 

For standard purposes, this parameter should always be kept at 1
true inch. If you want to shift text on the page, use TeX's own
\hoffset primitive. To avoid surprises, after global
magnification has been changed by the \mag primitive, the
\pdfhorigin parameter should still be 1 true inch, e. g. by
typing \pdfhorigin=1 true in after issuing the \mag command. Or,
you can preadjust the \pdfhorigin value before typing \mag, so
that its value after the \mag command ends up at 1 true inch
again. 

- \pdfvorigin (dimension) 
This parameter is the vertical companion of \pdfhorigin, and the
notes above regarding \mag and true dimensions apply. Also keep
in mind that the TeX coordinate system starts in the top left
corner (downward), while pdf coordinates start at the bottom left
corner (upward).

DSL is available in cities, in less populated regions you will be less
successful.  Even in Germany some people will never get DSL.  The
reason is that telephone lines had been designed to cover a frequency
spectrum up to 3.4 kHz.  Attenuation increases with frequency.  Hence,
the lengths of lines is quite limited for high speed data transfer.

Sorry, but I forgot to mention that I did/do not regard the ISO images
as something special.  When we discuss whether we can expect from a
Windows user that he is able to extract a bzip2 file or not, I think
we talk about [de]compression programs and not about ISO images.

The images are an exception here because their content is compressed
already.  Thus, the gain is quite small.

I must admit that this example is not a good one.  However, very few
people in those countries have a flatrate.  Time is money. And 5% less
time means 5% less money.  In most cases it?s much more than 5%.

BTW, Thanh built a house in Long Thanh (halfway between Saigon and
Vung Tau) and he is waiting for DSL for more than a year now.  He does
all the mail exchange and downloads in an internet cafe.

He will probably get DSL when many of his neighbours ask for it or if
one of them dies. 

His parents (in Sai Gon) have DSL now.  This makes things easier, but
without a flatrate, time is money, as I said before.

On the other hand, I?m happy to see how fast Viet Nam evolves these
days.

  Reinhard

Not a problem on Linux:

You could also `install' texlive by mounting the live cd image.

AFAIK, TeX Live on *ix doesn't depend on any particular locations.  So
long as the bin/<arch> directory is properly set in your PATH list
everything should work, but if you want a more conventional PATH
setting you can use symbolic links.  This has the advantage that you
can quickly switch, e.g., between an NSF mounted texlive tree and the
loop mounted .iso, simply by adjusting the symbolic link without the
need to change the PATH setting.   One feature of the .iso is that you
can't make changes, but even that can be accommodated using unionfs.

See also the discussion in the newsgroup comp.text.tex
(pdftex broken in tetex-3: offsets incorrect).

Here I posted some code that can be put into the plain format
for pdfTeX in PDF mode that adds the \pdf{h,v}origin fixing
into the macros of \magnification:

  \expandafter\def\expandafter\m@g\expandafter{%
    \m@g
    \pdfhorigin 1 true in%
    \pdfvorigin 1 true in%
    % Also correction of \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight
    % is a good idea.
  }%

With converting of \pdfpage{width,height} to truept:

  \expandafter\def\expandafter\m@g\expandafter{%
    \m@g
    \pdfhorigin 1truein%
    \pdfvorigin 1truein%
    \mag@fix\pdfpagewidth
    \mag@fix\pdfpageheight
  }
  \def\mag@fix#1{%
    #1=\expandafter\convert@truept\the#1\relax
  }
  \begingroup
    \catcode`P=12
    \catcode`T=12

My format contains (teTeX) is generated on pdftex.ini:

    \input pdftexconfig\pdfoutput=1
    \input plain
    \dump
    \endinput

pdftexconfig.tex contains:

    \pdfoutput=1
    \pdfcompresslevel=9
    \pdfdecimaldigits=3
    \pdfpagewidth=210 true mm
    \pdfpageheight=297 true mm
    \pdfhorigin=1 true in
    \pdfvorigin=1 true in
    \pdfpkresolution=600
    \pdfminorversion=4
    \endinput

The test file

    \showthe\pdfpagewidth
    \mag\magstep5
    \showthe\pdfpagewidth
    \null
    \end

The result is two times 597.50787pt and the page size of the
media box in the generated pdf file is:
  1481.05 bp x 2094.62 bp
--> much too large.

Regarding \hsize, \vsize: any setting before \magnification
is overwritten by the code of \magnification in plain.tex.

Indeed.  This same issue came up for \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight
back in the spring:

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/c49436b76fce7d2b

particularly http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/msg/c2af41100272529e

These should all be handled like \hsize and \vsize, where they are set 
to ordinary scalable units in the format or config files, but set to 
"true" units in \m@g.  I don't see why you need \mag@fix\pdfpagewidth

I switched to TeXLive 2005 on Linux here today after offering it for
'local beta testing' for a few weeks. Here's what the users have found
so far:

* The 'picins' package has been dropped since TeXLive 2004; which is
fair enough, since CTAN classifies it as a LaTeX 2.09 offering (though
the 2nd edition of the LaTeX Companion does not make that clear), and
picinpar is a better replacement;

* Trying to use Blackboard Bold at 11pt:

In previous years, the problem seemed to be that the file b-bold.mf was
missing from the collection of Sauter Metafonts in
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/sauter, though it was obtainable. I used
to add it and change texmf-dist fonts/source/jknappen/sauter/bbold11.mf
to input b-bold instead of bbold.

Things seem to have changed this year, so I've not done the above. For
the minute, I've made a temporary fix by copying
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/bbold/bbold10.mf to bbold11.mf, unaltered
- it's perhaps close enough, but what is the clean fix, please?

* It's amazing how much of the users' own material uses \ifx\pdfoutput
\undefined, but those who haven't already moved to package ifpdf some
time ago are finally doing it - now, when they are forced to do so! -
with only a few grumbles.

Hi John,

    * The 'picins' package has been dropped since TeXLive 2004; which is

Yes, it was CTAN's moving the package that prompted me to drop it, as I
recall.  People still use 2.09, huh?  I suppose I could reinstate it,
but since you said picinpar is a good replacement, might as well not?

    Things seem to have changed this year, 

They did?  What happened?  I do have some vague memory of a report
(probably from you :) along these lines, but I can't find the actual
changes.

    In previous years, the problem seemed to be that the file b-bold.mf was
    missing from the collection of Sauter Metafonts in

Isn't it b-bbold.mf?  I see that on CTAN and in teTeX.

With b-bbold.mf present, I thinkmktexmf should be able to generate bbold11.mf.
It does this to get the fundamental info:
sauterroot=`kpsewhich b-$rootname.mf 2>/dev/null`
(followed by a bunch of special cases.)

Can you try that out?

   * It's amazing how much of the users' own material uses
   \ifx\pdfoutput \undefined

I'm not surprised.  Virtually every recent TUGboat article did that,
too.  It was the recommended test since day 1.  As everyone reading this
list is bored of hearing about by now, I never did like the decision to
incompatibly change it.  Nothing to be done now, though.

Thanks,
Karl

'picins' was removed because it is not free software. See the discussion
in last october. Unfortunately, I haven't had time yet to follow up on
the possible contacts suggested by Joachim in that thread. Anybody?

bzip2 is supported by almost every archiver on Windows nowadays. There
is an excellet free and open source one (7-zip) at www.7-zip.org

Incidentally, 7-zip even has its own format (7z) which in many cases
packs much better than anything else. But it's even less known :)

Yeah.  If someone would like to try 7zipping the TL iso, I'd be
interested to know how it fares, both in how well it compresses and in
decompression time.

Message-ID: <200601310148.k0V1m9119433@f7.net>

After losing a week struggling with the software to convert a p4
repository to svn, I'm ready to give up.  It's too bad, because it can
do 99% of the job, and the result is very nice, but I can't find any
reasonable way to get the last 1%, or any way to get a consistent
hierarchy generated without the problematic pieces.

If anyone has significant time and interest to pursue it in the next few
days, let me know and I'll send the details, of which there are many.
Meanwhile, I'm going to move ahead with getting the build and the update
scripts working again with svn, and writing some info about the new
setup.  When that is all done, we can finally open the repo for general
changes again.

observations: 

- zip is less inferior to gzip than suggested on this list (compare compressed tarballs); zipping without tarball leads to larger files because then the files are compressed individually (inefficient for the many small files in the tree)

- 7zip is slow, (somehow afm files are compressed very slow); since files are added in the sort order of the suffix, my guess is that its compression may depend on the filetype, slower on text than on binary data

- bzip2 is slow too

so, 7zip is okay, but only when part of a more or less automated workflow

Though I can't be sure that picinpar is a complete replacement for
picins, I tend to agree - I've managed without picins all this time. By
the way, the TeXLive 2005 bugs list overstates the problem - though
written for LaTeX 2.09, picins (has been modified so that it) works fine
with the current LaTeX.

Sorry, yes - that name is what I meant to write. My main question is:
has it been deliberately omitted from the Sauter Metafonts in the
TeXLive distribution or not?

I added b-bbold.mf and deleted the copy of bbold11.mf I added manually
(a copy of bbold10.mf) and also the pk and tfm files generated as a
result of that:
$VARTEXMF/texfonts/pk/ljfour/jknappen/sauter/bbold11.657pk and
$VARTEXMF/texfonts/tfm/jknappen/sauter/bbold11.tfm,

but things (the disposition of the Metafont files) seem to have changed
this year as I said, so my next step of changing
$TEXMF/fonts/source/jknappen/sauter/bbold11.mf thus:

2c2
< input bbold;
---
> input b-bbold;

isn't possible because that file no longer exists.

But that last doesn't seem necessary, either - my problem was that my
texfonts directory had not had a 'sources' sub-directory created in it
with permissions drwxrwxrwt; once I did that, the presence of b-bbold.mf
allowed mktexmf to do the trick.

Perhaps what is needed is for the TeXLive installation script to make
sure that $VARTEXMF/texfonts and all its needed sub-directories exist
with appropriate permissions?

Thanks Karl,

True. Instead, they would contact VietTUG, the Vietnamese user group:
   email:    kyanh_at_o2.pl
   web site: www.viettug.org
to find/work out how to get the 2005 Collection.

But the instructions are meant as help, not an offence. Instead of
fighting BZ2, or a bandwidth, or other downloading problems, get a copy 
(or another copy, if you lost the first one) from a user group!

i'm not so sure if it works that way in a country where one can buy a copy of windows or illustrator or ... for one dollar on the corner of a street; there are user groups in vietnam, china etc, but they don't have the membership fees that other lugs have; maybe tug and the eurolugs should send those local user groups a bunch of dvd's (for free) for their members and those interested. I can even imagine that we send left-overs since then one can rsync a local tree with a new one which is rather efficient.

Subject: [tex-live] dvips cannot find figures (again)
Message-ID: <1138727712.7241.131.camel@pc118>

I see that the new version of dvips(1) provided with TeXLive 2005 has
been configured with 'z1' (security on) in config.ps by default - i.e.
it will reject attempts to reference files by absolute pathnames, and
the use of Unix commands in \specials. Alas, the error messages the end
user sees aren't clear, and have caused panic here among those who did
not read the TeXLive documentation!

Rather than the message:

dvips: Could not find figure file /usr/john/elephant.eps; continuing

wouldn't something like:

dvips: Refusing to read figure file /usr/john/elephant.eps on security grounds - use option -R0 to override; continuing

be more informative - and ditto with similar messages?

I know that this is a dvips matter I should raise with the author, but I
feel that the TeXLive developers should have something to say about
this.

LaTeX doesn't find it.

He should be in

Hi John,

    dvips: Refusing to read figure file /usr/john/elephant.eps on
    security grounds - use option -R0 to override; continuing

There is no question that dvips diagnostics could be improved in many
instances, including this one.  Patches would be welcome :).

    I know that this is a dvips matter I should raise with the author, 

Indeed, I don't think Tom is on this list; he's on tex-k, though.  It's
also the case that I and others have made most of the (exceedingly few)
changes in recent years to dvips, although Tom still answers mail
occasionally about it.

Best,
Karl
