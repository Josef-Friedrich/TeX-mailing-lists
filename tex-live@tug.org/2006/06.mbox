No need to apologize.  I personally think that the GFDL is a really bad
license, but removing stuff licensed under it is primarily a political
decision.  I agree with the decision made by Debian, but I have no
problem if other people don't take similar steps.

There is no such thing as a Debian .dpkg file.  A Debian source package
consists of

foo_<version>.orig.tar.gz
foo_<version>-<debrevision>.diff.gz
foo_<version>-<debrevision>.dsc

(the last one being a control file).  The orig.tar.gz file should be the
pristine upstream tar.gz file, if it exists, or a directory or zip file
or similar repacked into tar.gz.

Similarly, TeXLive just copies the files from CTAN into its tree, and
only adds some things (like infrastructure, build instructions etc.).
There are no changes made, and that is the important thing.  

Especially since it's hard to tell what the "pristine upstream sources"
are:  When I upload something to CTAN, it will be in a tar.gz.  But on
CTAN it will be present in unpacked form, or you can retrieve it as a
zip file.

Personally, I think TeXLive should use as much dvi in its
documentation tree as possible, preferably using Source Specials.
Quite faster to access.  If you have the TeXLive CD (or an installed
TeXlive version), you have a working TeX setup with a known minimal
set of fonts (CTAN in contrast needs the online documentation in PDF,
since the TeX system of prospectively interested people is an
unknown).

Some packages on CTAN already follow an alternative approach:  They do
not put their files directly into CTAN://macros/latex/contrib/foo/ (or
wherever), but instead into a mini-TEXMF tree rooted at foo/.

A assume that you mean the top level directory which contains the "Build" script.

Regardless, I can't find an "insall-live.sh" in any of the directories.

  * From the top level I tried:   find . -name install-live.sh -print
  * => Resulting in nothing.
  * Then I tried a   tar -vtjf source.tar.bz2 | grep install-live.sh
  * => Again nothing.

My "Build" script ends up in the same directory as the tarball file, which is in a directory I made names ..texlive.

So I can just make up a Master Tree?  Say /usr/local/texlive or /usr/local/texmf?

Build puts all binaries in ../texlive/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin

Environment variable is: OSTYPE=cygwin


So now I have all of the binaries.

I need to set TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFSYSVAR....

But, I don't know where to....  just make up to /usr/local/texlive  and ...texlive/share/texmf?

I am sorry that I don't know alot about the innards of this yet.

I thought source specials were only useful for navigating between source

Not yet - they are not even in unstable, just in experimental at the

Being able to jump to the .dtx file in question is helpful because you
can cut&paste better from the corresponding source.  And even more so
if there are several source files, like with source2e.dvi.  Code reuse
is one of the major selling points of FOS.

And with regard to forward search: if you want to print the relevant
pages from source2e.dvi for some lines in ltfloat.sty, being able to
use forward search will be beneficial.

Source specials obviously impact the dvi size, but I think that the
cost/benefit ratio is much better than for using PDF altogether.

Yep, I'm remembering that it was always a lot of work to get teTeX
fully Filesystem Hierarchy Standard[1] compatible.  Which is simply
all configuration should be located at /etc/texmf/, all variable
data should be located at /var/lib/texmf/ and /var/cache/fonts/
for fonts, all static and independed data should be located at
/usr/share/texmf/.  Note that /usr/ could be mounted read only
accordingly to the FHS and even if, the teTeX setup has to work
flawless.  This reqires that e.g. the ls-R files within
/usr/share/texmf/ are symbolic links which points into /var/lib/texmf/.

Beside this I use a subdirectory teTeX/ in /usr/share/texmf/ for
the binaries in teTeX/bin/<arch>/ and the manual and info pages.
This because this enables me to export all of this via NFS.  Clearly
the stuff is included with symbolic links into the standard
execution, info and manual paths.

This is not neccessary, because /usr/share/texmf/ls-R must be written only if 
something was written or deleted from /usr/share/texmf, so you need only 
write permission if you've had write permission already. In all other cases 
(searching files by kpathsea) only read permission to ls-R are needed.

At rpm generation of ls-R may simply be a post install and post deinstall call 
(so at update it will be called twice instead of once, but this shouldn't be 
a problem).

E.g. Live-CDs/DVDs work with precreated ls-R and never need write permission.

No, surprisingly enough :), I meant what I said: the Master directory.
Do a full checkout of TeX Live, not just the Build directory.  There is
a Master subdir sibling to Build (the directory, not the script):
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/

    i686-pc-cygwin

Ok, thanks, I will try to add that arch to the install scripts.

    But, I don't know where to....  just make up to /usr/local/texlive

No.  To have a usable system, you need the stuff from Master.

Yes, sure, and that is fine (and easy for TL).  It makes sense for big
packages.  But the vast majority of packages do not do that -- and in
fact it would be way overkill for (say) standard latex packages.

I guess I will try to put together a more concrete proposal, and we can
see if any package authors feel like following it, and go from there.

A couple of pleas:

1) finite task: if anyone could take on the job of figuring out exactly
   what in cm-super can be replaced by Latin Modern, that would be very
   welcome.  It should end up being most of the non-Cyrillic files, but
   it needs careful examination and creation of the right map file entries.
   
   I've written about this at length earlier (toward the end of the last
   year's release), but can re-discuss with anyone who has time and
   inclination to work on it.


2) infinite task: help me with updates!  It's hard for me to even keep
   up with the daily uploads to CTAN, let alone the backlog of the last
   six months.  It doesn't require any deeply technical or TeXnical
   knowledge, mostly a bit of careful attention to what is happening and
   a tiny bit of perl+sh programming on occasion.

What do you mean by "non-Cyrillic files"? If you are refering to
non-Cyrillic /font/ files, then these do not exist. For example 

/usr/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/cm-super$ egrep sfrm1000.pfb cm-super-*.map
cm-super-t1.map:ecrm1000 SFRM1000 "T1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t1.enc <sfrm1000.pfb

Um, yes - I was remembering using the program dpkg (I haven't run a

Agreed.
It would be nice though if it generated .dvi documentation (like teTeX
did), as the pdf documentation contributes to the packaging space issues
on distributions like Fedora. Maybe that should be filed as an RFE by
distributions it affects (I'm not personally too concerned about it).

I personally like dvi documentation better anyway, it loads faster from
texdoc on my elderly laptop.

If dvi files were self-contained, that would be fine.
The glory of PDF is that it has no dependencies
on external graphics files, metrics, fonts etc.

The dvi documentation for package X which
uses fonts will not work until package X is installed.
This is the argument used in the past, anyway.

Speaking for myself, I haven't used a dvi file in I don't
know how many years. It was a good idea in its time,
like TeX itself,....

there is a definite tension here.  we strongly dis-recommend dvi documentation
on ctan: while it's quite possible to set up a rule for dealing with it, we
don't believe it's transparent to the random browser user, and in any case you
can't guarantee that dvi documentation will run on a user's machine.  we 
(still)
have dvi docs, typically on the fonts/ tree, that won't actually run until 
you've
installed the package -- which rather defeats the purpose (in our world) of
holding the stuff at all.

> I personally like dvi documentation better anyway, it loads faster from

it loads faster on my rather fast workstation, but i tend to keep an acrobat
reader running, which makes the extra delay acceptable.  (for an old enough
laptop, that technique is probably not useful.)

fwiw, i find the argument about source specials rather hard to get my head
around.  how does one find the file that's being referred to, given that it's
typically on someone else's file system, more than likely a system that's
got a different structure than your system.  am i missing something here?
(i don't actually use source specials myself.)

Maybe.  Nobody is talking about CTAN (where PDF is all appropriate and
Source Specials make little sense).  We are talking about a TeXlive
tree, where the locations of source code and dvi file are fixed
relatively to each other, so with a properly set up compilation
environment, source specials should contain proper relative path names
pointing to the pristine source location of the TeXlive source tree.

That's a valid point for not using dvi documentation on the web, but
with a TeX distribution like TeX Live - the package the documentation
refers to is installed, either on the live DVD or on the hard disk.

Until very recently, I did the latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf route for
everything, but I mostly just use pdflatex now. I still use it though
when I want to view a work in progress that's not finished, it is very
useful for that IMHO.

And for making documentation less of a packaging space hog ;)

FWIW, it's much easier to look for a string with xpdf than with xdvi,
because after typing Ctrl-F in xdvi, you have to place the mouse pointer
exactly on the search text field before typing the string you want to
look for. Which is quite annoying. :-|

Did you report this as a bug?  Stuff like this should be fixed rather

Of course, I agree. I hope it is not a problem caused by the graphical
toolkit in use.

I didn't report the problem because I was about to reply that DVI files
weren't searchable in xdvi when I loaded the manpage to find out that
was wrong!

The problem is now reported at:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1499566&group_id=23164&atid=377580

(also, I believe xdvi can use Motif or lesstiff instead of Xaw--don't
remember precisely; here, it uses Xaw; maybe someone on this list has
xdvi working with the other toolkit and doesn't see the problem?)

I think this problem depends on the widgets.  xdvi(k) with
Mofif/lesstif doesn't have this restriction, Xaw does.

    Through approrpiate reencoding a font file like sfrm1000.pfb is used for

I see, thanks.

I didn't make this clear before, since it wasn't clear in my mind.  But
your reply makes me realize that the hope is to use LM for the
non-cyrillic encodings, and thus be able to keep a smaller set of
cm-super files in TL (e.g., just 10pt or whatever), since far fewer
users would be affected.  My recollection is that Vladimir said at one
time that this sounded ok to him.  I hope it still does.

In any case, I am sure we will need to save space somewhere to still be
able to make an inst CD, I've already added enough new packages to put
us over 700mb.  Perhaps it will finally be time this year to have
inst/CD be a subset of the live/DVD, instead of being identical, but
that will mean a lot of infrastructure changes.

Anyway, unless a volunteer comes forward, it's likely nothing will
happen in this regard, so whatever :).

sure - since the LM fonts are of better quality, it is good to use
them whenever possible instead of the cm-super fonts.

if their metrics for the T1 and TS1 encodings are compatible with the
EC fonts (which i don't know/didn't check), then they could be used
instead of cm-super fonts for these encodings by removing the map
entries for the EC and TC fonts from cm-super-t1.map and
cm-super-ts1.map and using the corresponding entries of the LM fonts
(note that some entries in the cm-super-{t1,ts1}.map files are for the
T1- and TS1-encoded CMBright and CM Concrete fonts, which are probably
not provided by the LM fonts, so one should remove only the entries
corresponding to the EC and TC fonts from these map files, and retain
the ones for the CMBright and CM Concrete).

Best,
v.

Re DVI (with or without source specials) vs. PDF in TeX Live:

1) I got a small but steady stream of complaints about people unable to
   deal with the DVI files for whatever reason -- using a web browser on
   the hierarchy, don't have the fonts, whatever.  No complaints as of
   now about PDF.

2) In these days of routine 50-100gb disks, I'm not impressed by the
   space argument.  GNU/Linux distributions can choose what collections
   to include and what to leave out, which will have a far greater
   impact than PDF vs. DVI.  I wouldn't expect full TL to go on Linux
   distribution discs in the first place (but whatever).

3) Most importantly, CTAN has PDF.  Therefore all I have to do for TL is
   copy the PDF.  This has been a significant time savings -- creating
   the doc dvi was one of the most fragile parts of the CTAN->TL
   operation.
   
4) So, as long as I'm doing the bulk of the TL updates, TL will continue
   to have PDF.
   
5) Of course, anyone is free to make dvi's, with or without source
   specials, if they wish, for redistribution or whatever.  If it's done
   in a timely and systematic way, personally I would be happy to
   include the dvi's on the TC DVD, or in TL, or whatever makes sense,
   we can figure it out if it comes to pass.  But I can't take on the
   additional job of creating them.

It is impossible to provide dvi files for all dtx files unless this
can be done automatically.  If someone writes such a script, it's
better not to use it to create dvi files which go into TeXLive.  
It's much better to distribute just that script.

the problem is precisely that such a script has to have built-in
knowledge about the package and how its docs are supposed to be
processed.  there are a significant number of packages on ctan that
just won't work in (what i think of as) the standard way -- process
.ins, process .dtx -- enough that every so often i'm surprised by
another twist.  yesterday's little excitement was a package that
demanded to be processed by pdflatex: no particular reason, just the
author apparently thought that would be a good thing to do.

if i were king of the world, none of this would happen...

That's not the standard way.  The standard way is process .ins,
process .drv.  Only if there is no .drv generated, is .dtx worth a
try.

ah.  the .drv style is in *so* much of a minority in latex2e packages,
it never occurred to me to suggest it.  it's presumable a pre-2e
notation?  (i never used the pre-2e doc stuff.)

every 2e package i've created follows the style used in the latex
kernel, which i had simply assumed was in some way "standard".

however, your alternative technique has the advantage of being
programmable.  dealing with packages with no .ins file (you're
expected to run docstrip direct and guess what options to type) isn't
(afaict) programmable.

locate .drv on a TeXlive source tree spews out so many .drv files that
I won't post them here.

And in the beginning of LaTeX2e, .drv files were more common than now.
The reason probably so that you could make use of the files even in
the absence of docstrip: you could use the .dtx file for their
ultimate function (style file or class file or similar) without
running docstrip if you wanted to.

2 questions/ideas:

- is there a list of not-already-updated packages? Can the list be put
  into the svn repository? Maybe the mailbox of not done CTAN announce

- there was a script to do the updates, but I haven't used it for some

No. One advantage of drv is that you are allowed to change the drv,

what does that give you, that you don't get from ltxdoc.cfg?

not that i care much, you understand: as i said earlier, .drv-based
documentation is readily recognised in a script, so it's not a
problem.

I think the space argument does not refer to disk space but to the size
of distribution media (TL is facing that problem, too) and for some
people network bandwidth.

BTW, unfortunately the TL collection level is not the right place to
define a subset of TL with size /and/ utility comparable to teTeX. But
how TL can be used is as replacement for teTeX is a different issue.

Unfortunately they are not compatible even for identical design size. I
have reencoded lmr10.pfb and sfrm1000.pfb with appropriate encoding
vectors to T1 encoding (lm-ec.enc and cm-super-t1.enc) and used
Reinhard's t1diff to compare the results. If anybody is interested, I
can make the resulting PDF file available. In addition I have also build
a LaTeX file that shows /some/ of the differences (process with
pdflatex):

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\pdfmapline{=ecrm1000 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmec ReEncodeFont" <lm-ec.enc <lmr10.pfb}
\begin{document}

{\font\x=ecrm1095 at 10pt\x
\makebox[10em][r]{EC font EC metrics:}
n\"{\i}n \k{i} \k{o} \S 1 \S 2 \S 3 \S 4 \S 5 \S 6 \S 7 \S 8 \S 9 
}

\makebox[10em][r]{LM font EC metrics:}
n\"{\i}n \k{i} \k{o} \S 1 \S 2 \S 3 \S 4 \S 5 \S 6 \S 7 \S 8 \S 9 

\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont
\makebox[10em][r]{LM font LM metrics:}
n\"{\i}n \k{i} \k{o} \S 1 \S 2 \S 3 \S 4 \S 5 \S 6 \S 7 \S 8 \S 9 

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \pdfmapline command does what has been suggested, ie using LM fonts
together with EC metrics. Next, 11pt EC is optically scaled down to 10pt
for reference. As we know this is not the same as 10pt EC, but for the
present purpose this is good enough. You can compare 11pt at 10pt with
10pt at 10pt by commenting \pdfmapline. The next line then uses 10pt EC
metrics but with LM fonts. Finally, the LM fonts are used with their own
metrics. 

IMNSHO it is clear that the top EC/EC and the bottom LM/LM lines are
good (with the exception of \k{i} in the case of LM), but the middle
line which uses the LM fonts with EC metrics is not acceptable, since
the '?' is offcenter, the ogonek accents are to far to the right, and
the numbers are way to close to the section mark. All this and probably
more is the result of lmr10 and sfrm1000/ecrm1000 having different
metrics. Of course, there is the additional problem that EC has many
more design sizes than LM.

>From my point of view one must not use a font with incompatible metrics.
If one follows this, there are two posssibilities, if one wants to get
rid of (parts of) cm-super in order to save space:

1) Change the t1cm*.fd files to point to TFM files from LM instead of
   those from EC. This is a radical and incompatible change, though,
   since LM and EC differ wrt to metrics and design sizes. (And wrt the
   interpretation of some code points in the T1 encoding.)

2) Stick to EC for metrics /and/ fonts, but inlcude only a part of
   cm-super, hence unchanged documents will use Type3 fonts in some
   places now, where they used to use Type1 fonts before. The excluded
   part of cm-super could be made available as download and on the DVD.
   Maybe Reinhard's script for downloading nonfree fonts could be
   extended to handle this case, too.

As one can see, both cases have their drawbacks. There is no free lunch ...

In the second case, one still has to decide which subset of the cm-super
fonts should be included. I see four possibilities:

1) The teTeX approach: No cm-super at all. Tell people to use LM
   instead. Easy to implement, maximal space saving, but also maximal
   problems with Type3 fonts.

2) The type1ec approach: Include only the 10pt design size and tell
   people to use type1ec with option '10pt' or download not included
   fonts. Not difficult to implement, large space saving, still many
   problems with Type3 fonts.

3) Try to define a subset of design sizes to include, maybe based on the
   ones used by fix-cm.sty. In addition, one could exclude all design
   sizes of Dunhill, Fibonacci Medium/Slanted, Funny Roman/Italic and
   probably a few more. Not easy to implement, probably one half of
   cm-super can be excluded that way. Problems with Type3 fonts should
   be minor, especially when fix-cm.sty is used.

4) Leave it as it is, ie include all of cm-super. Easy to implement, no
   problems with Type3 fonts, but also no space saving at all.

Again, each possibility has its own set of (dis)advantages and it is a
question of priorities which route to follow.

BTW, the closest one can get to a 'free lunch' is probably the usage of
pfb2t1c and t1c2pfb, both available from CTAN:ps-type1/cm-super/debian.
The idea behind these programs is that a Type1 font can be reencoded in
such a way that compression is much more effective. A real life example
from cm-super:

$ ls -l sfrm1000.*
total 1104
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf ralf 138204 2006-06-03 14:36 sfrm1000.pfb
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf ralf 137661 2006-06-03 14:37 sfrm1000.pfb.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf ralf 518467 2006-06-03 14:37 sfrm1000.raw
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf ralf  96385 2006-06-03 14:37 sfrm1000.raw.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf ralf 137594 2006-06-03 14:36 sfrm1000.t1c
-rw-r--r--  1 ralf ralf  66202 2006-06-03 14:37 sfrm1000.t1c.gz

(The raw files are produced with t1disasm.) So by shipping t1c files,
one can save about a factor of two in compressed size. Of course,
dvips/pdftex/... do not understand this t1c format, hence the files have
to be converted back on installation, which makes this step more
difficult. In addition, the 'Live' version would have to inlude the pfb
files. One could add a 'mktexpfb' script that calls t1c2pfb as needed,
but I am not sure if it is worth the effort.

Usage of pfb2t1c is not limited to the cm-super fonts. However, right
now it does not work with LM, probably because the LM fonts include an
explicit default encoding vector instead of using StandardEncoding (I
have no idea why the LM fonts are build that way). This looks like a bug
in pfb2t1c. If this bug can be fixed, applying pfb2t1c to all Type1
fonts in TL would give quite nice space saving.

This message has gotten pretty long, but I think I ahve covered all
possibilities. I am not in the position to make any decisions, though.

Where do the Type 3 fonts come in?  Is this mostly a question of
support for  languages outside the lm domain?

5) For a really minimal distro that is still useful for generating
documentation for screen viewing, use math fonts compatible with
something from the (system default, usually some URW collection)
laserwriter 35 fonts and a tt font suitable for software documenation.
 For people who are sufficiently unhappy to invest some bandwidth and
disk, lm and cm-super are available.  A lot of time will be spent
discussing which fonts to use, but otherwise not hard to implement.

Unless a volunteer steps forward to actually do the hard cases (2 or 3),
"easy to implement" will carry the day.  It would be nice to have the
option of choosing between these options when installing TL.

I think option 5 has advantages for linux distros where the size of
teTeX is a bit painful, especially given that many users won't install
it, but it needs to be clear that the basic package can be updated to
something more complete (e.g., TL) without breakage.  Many people who
try TeX for program documentation are put off by cm (cmtt makes it
hard to fit program code in a line, and the fonts are anemic compared
to the fonts people are used to seeing).

This makes a lot of sense, but fails the "easy to implement" test.
For the people who are in a position to implement this, disk and
bandwidth are likely not
a big issue, so (unless they are getting a salary) who ever does it is
really doing it for someone else's benefit.

More compact cm fonts should, however, be of interest to linux vendors
where supporting many languages wins over font "quality" for those
languages supported by lm.  Using pfb2t1c for a fix-cm.sty subset of
cm-super fonts as suggested in option 3 seems like a useful compromise
for a teTeX replacement.

[ which is Xaw, on Debian ]

Unfortunately, this is precisely the case. Upstream developer Stephan
Ulrich says the bug doesn't happen if xdvi is compiled with the Motif
toolkit.

So, this *is* a damnation. DVI is baaaad.

I fear that this license is not appropriate for TeXLive.  Does TL
contain this package alraedy?

nothing to do with the licence.  just that i would have had to hack
the code of the documentation to make it compile under latex rather
than pdflatex.

On Solaris, it seems that xdvi-motif.bin is the one which comes  with the TL2005 CD.
I've got only this one in the bin directory.

    BTW, unfortunately the TL collection level is not the right place to
    define a subset of TL with size /and/ utility comparable to teTeX. 

That's why the scheme level (set of collections and/or packages) exists.
No one seems especially interested in doing that right now, but the
possibility is there if the need arises.

So the Xaw port is flawed.  That does not mean that the problem is
intrinsic to Xaw.

trouble is, that would would mean decoding teTeX and working
out which TL packages it corresponds to. Its not that easy,
from memory.

it would make sense to install the TL "medium" scheme
and simply compare footprints, for a start.

Maybe. But I've encountered the very same problem with other
applications before; one of them was gv, IIRC, which uses Xaw3d. True,
Xaw3d is not Xaw, but the "feature" may well be a common one between
both libraries.

Please get in contact with Frank K?ster. He is doing something very
similar for teTeX on Debian, as he collects all the tpms which are
included in tetex in some way for license checks.

So it might be useless to do it double (I mean the check which tpm
relate to teTeX).

Stefan Ullrich once said that he didn't recommend lesstiff because of
the problems.  But looking at LESSTIF-BUGS it seems to me as if lesstiff
should work well unless one is using expert mode.  So giving the user
the choice might be a good idea.  We could try to provide a binary
linked to lesstiff, both managed with update-alternatives.

Message-ID: <200606032311.k53NBlB15742@f7.net>

Hi Ralf,

Thanks *very* much for the test file and analysis.

    Unfortunately they are not compatible even for identical design size.

Yes, very unfortunate.

The original goal was to use LM where possible.  But given the metric
incompatibilities you've found, it seems that replacing EC/cm-super with
LM is not possible.  So \usepackage{lmodern} has to remain the way to
access LM from LaTeX for the foreseeable future.  Drat.

As an aside, it seems it would be nice, given today's world, if Latin
Modern was somehow adopted in core LaTeX as at least an "equal" choice
with the EC fonts -- though I admit I'm not sure what that means, and
anyway doesn't help us now.

    So by shipping t1c files, one can save about a factor of two in
    compressed size.

>From the choices you've admirably and clearly laid out, this is the one
that stands out to me.

Given the failure of replacing EC with LM, the remaining issue for TL is
the inst cd.  As a community, I really doubt we want to give up the cd
just yet -- every year the question is asked, and every year the members
say "we still have cd drives, please don't do only dvd".

Furthermore, from TL's perspective, it seems highly undesirable for the
inst cd and the live dvd to have "slightly" different contents.  I'd
rather leave off whole architectures from inst than change package
contents.  (Easier to implement too.)

So, I surmise that the thing to do (just restating what you wrote) is:
- include pfb2t1c and t1c2pfb in TL
- compress the t1's when making the zips for the inst cd
- uncompress the t1's when installing from inst

Yikes.  Maybe some other way of saving enough space will present
itself.

Anyway, time will tell.  Thanks again, very much, for looking at this.

Karl

P.S. A somewhat related question: can you easily adapt your test file to
compare LM and *CM*?  (I briefly tried and failed.)  I.e., are LM
outlines usable with CM metrics?  Knuth himself has said that various of
the improvements in LM are desirable ... just wondering, at this point.

Subject: [tex-live] Proposal for collection reorganization
Message-ID: <20060604110354.GB30719@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all!

We would like to propose some changes to the collections. These proposal
came up after some discussion on the Debian texlive packages, and make
sense in general.

Of course I will make all the necessary changes if accepted, but please
first lets dicuss and see if we TeX live agree:


Suggestions to tpm restructuring:
=================================

* fpl/mathpazo
	move fpl from fonts-extra to fonts-recommended
	move mathpazo from math-extra to latex-recommended

	Reason: PSNFSS asks for these fonts

* charter
	move charter from fonts-extra to fonts-recommended

	Reason: PSNFSS asks for these fonts

* rsfs
	move rsfs from fonts-extra to fonts-recommended

	Reason: PSNFSS asks for these fonts
	
* (HA-prosper)/beamer/powerdot
	move prosper from latex-recommended to latex-extra
	move beamer and powerdot from latex-extra to latex-recommended

	Reason: the later are more up-to-date and advanced (more used?)
	packages

* jura*
	move jurabib from lang-de to bibtex-extra
	move juramisc, jurarsp, juraabbrev from latex-extra to lang-de

	Reason: juramisc, jurarsp, juraabbrev is specific to German law, 
	while jurabib is used in humanities and literature, too.

* pdfcprot/microtype
	move pdfcprot to latex-extra
	move microtype to pdfetex (but see below)

	Reason: microtype is the preferred method, pdfcprot is old

* other simple moves
	mhequ -- Multicolumn equations, tags, labels, sub-numbering.
		from latexextra to mathextra
	ogonek -- Support for Polish typography and the ogonek.
		from latexextra to langpolish
	uhrzeit -- Time printing, in German.
		from latexextra to langgerman

* collection-chemistry => collection-science
	merge other scientific packages
	(units, scipaper, textopo, algorithm,...)
	into a new latex-science
	List has to be determined

* various publishers and thesis styles
	move from latex-extra to publishers
	(proposed but probably incomplete list)
  IEEEconf -- IEEEconf proceedings
  aastex -- Macros for Manuscript Preparation for AAS Journals.
  apa -- American Psychological Association format.
  asaetr -- Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers.
  ascelike -- Bibliography style for the American Society of Civil Engineer.
  gatech-thesis -- Georgia Institute of Technology thesis class
  imac -- International Modal Analysis Conference format.
  jhep -- JHEP style.
  jpsj -- Document Class for Journal of the Physical Society of Japan.
  muthesis -- Document classes for University of Manchester Department of
   	Computer Science.
  nature -- Prepare papers for the journal Nature.
  osa -- Macros for Optical Society of America Journals, etc.
  ptptex -- Macros for 'Progress of Theoretical Physics'.
  sae -- Typeset an SAE technical paper.
  siggraph -- SIGGRAPH conference class.
  tugboat -- LaTeX macros for TUGboat articles.
  uaclasses -- University of Arizona thesis and dissertation format.
  ucthesis -- University of California thesis format.
  uiucthesis -- UIUC thesis class.
  umich-thesis -- University of Michigan Thesis LaTeX class.
  york-thesis -- A thesis class file for York University, Toronto.

	Reason: the fit better there

Finally something which should be discussed:

* Remove collection-pdfetex and move all the files into latex-base or
  latexrecommended?

What do we need the collection-pdfetex for? It does *not* contain the
pdfetex binary, but only pdf related stuff:
  cmap -- Make PDF files searchable and copyable.
  etex -- An extended version of TeX, from the NTS project.
  ifmslide -- Presentation slides for screen and printouts.
  pdf-trans -- Transformations of TeX boxes for pdfTeX.
  pdfcprot -- Activating and setting of character protruding using pdflatex.
  pdfpages -- Include PDF documents in LaTeX.
  pdfscreen -- Support screen-based document design.

I think I'd put ifmslide, pdfslide and pdfscreen in latex-extra these

No idea, this is what it is stated in 00readme.txt of psnfss:
-----
...
Fonts required for PSNFSS
The "Base 35" fonts
Adobe Utopia
Bitstream Charter
FPL (=Palatino SC/OsF)

Makes sense. This was not a fully finished proposal, just a start of
discussion. If we kill this collection, than some packages will be moved
here and there. 

Thanks Sebastian!

I generally agree, but I remember two complaints on ctt (one of them

computers.

mathpazo.tpm contains many font files (pfb, afm, vf, tfm) and one LaTeX
input file: texmf-dist/tex/latex/mathpazo/ufplm.fd. Most likely this is
either a duplicate or an older version of the corresponding file in
psnfss.tpm: texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfss/ufplm.fd. I would therefore
suggest removing ufplm.fd from mathpazo.tpm. In addition I think that
fonts-recommended would be more appropriate for mathpazo.tpm, since all
other fonts that PSNFSS asks for are (going to be) part of this
colleciton. 

[...]
>   pdftexdef -- The pdftexdef package.

What is the point of this package, anyway? It seems to contain only
source files, whereas the actual pdftex.def is in graphics.tpm where it
belongs.

Speeking of pdftex.def. Recently pdftex.def acquired some new code to
give sensible error messages when the files needed for MetaPost->PDF
translation (supp-mis.tex and supp-pdf.tex from ConTeXt) are not
available. I think this was triggered by an error in the teTeX-splitting
done by SuSE. These two files are part of a separate ConTeXt package. I
don't know about TL proper, but TL in Debian seems to have the same
defect. One can install LaTeX and MetaPost, but without installing
ConTeXt, one won't be able to include MPS files directly. Maybe one
could put these two files into the MetaPost collection instead?

Do you remember which changes Knuth considered desirable?

Anyway, replacing CM in its Type1 incarnation from Bluesky Research with
LM is easier than replacing EC with LM, since the former possibility has
been explicitly taken into account. For example, LM contains uppercase
greeks and many other glyphs just to take care of the rather odd
encoding of the CM fonts (cmr5 and cmr10 having different encoding etc).
LM even comes with a set of encoding vectors and map files for using it
instead of CM (text, CS, PL, and VN variant, no math; lm-rep-*.map).
AFAIK bsr.map and bsr-interpolated.map have allready been split into
parts that can be replaced by LM and parts that cannot (ie math fonts).

How good does this work? I have reencoded several fonts from LM with the
appropriate encoding vector and compared the resulting fonts with the
appropriate font from CM. From the limited set I have tested, it seems
as if the metrics are identical. The outlines are almost identical,
however the position of some accents has been changed. This can cause
problems when the original accent position is taken as basis for further
macros. The simplest example for this is the \hbar macro that in LaTeX
simply overprints a mathitalic 'h' and a macron accent. The macron
accent in LM is slightly higher than in CM which somewhat distrubes the
look of \hbar. Here is an example file:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}

\pdfmapline{=cmr10 LMRoman10-Regular "enclmrepcmrm ReEncodeFont" <lm-rep-cmrm.enc <lmr10.pfb}
\usepackage[ngerman,english]{babel}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\newcommand{\teststring}{\'e \`e \"a \"o \"u 
  \foreignlanguage{ngerman}{\"a \"o \"u} $\hbar$}
\begin{document}

\makebox[10em][r]{CM font CM metrics:}
\scalebox{1.08}{\small\teststring}

\makebox[10em][r]{LM font CM metrics:} 
\teststring

\makebox[10em][r]{CM font CM metrics:} 
\scalebox{0.85}{\large\teststring}

\makebox[10em][r]{LM font LM metrics:}
{\fontencoding{T1}\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont\teststring}

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The argument to \pdfmapline comes straight out of lm-rep-cmtext.map. The
next lines compare scaled up 9pt CM, 10pt LM with 10pt CM metrics,
scaled down 12pt CM, and 10pt LM with 10pt LM metrics and T1 encoding.

One can see from this example that in the lines where 10pt LM is used
for the macron accent (2. and 4.), the bar in \hbar is uncomfortably
close to the top serif of the 'h'. 

In addition, one can see the changes that have been made to some
accents. The accute and grave accent have been shifted horizontally,
while the dieresis has been shifted down. In principle, the latter is a
good thing. At least to my german eyes the first set of '? ? ?' looks
better, when LM is used. The problem is, that the too high dieresis in
CM has been known for a long time, which is why german.sty and its
descendants contain code to lower it. This is what one sees in the
second set of '? ? ?'. Here CM (1. and 3. line) and LM with precomposed
glyphs (4. line) look good. On the second line, which we are interested
in, the dieresis is a bit to close, especially for the ?.

I don't know if there is any other code around that is based on the
explicit position of the accents in CM. If yes, similar problems to the
ones shown above should be expected. Also I have only tested fonts from
the bsr collection so far, not from the cs, pl, or vn variants.

There is a further problem that the hinting of the LM fonts is rather
strange at the moment (v0.99.3), as they contain many unnecessary hints.
Actually I am surprised that up to now I have only found one problem
that is visible in real life (small cap 't' appears smaller than, eg,
small cap 'e' or 'f'). But then, I haven't searched systematically for
hinting problems. (That's one of the most boring works I can imagine.
;-)

The problems shown above are less severe than those shown for the
EC->LM replacement. But the potential gain is also smaller, since bsr,
cs, pl, and vnr fonts together bring in less than 10M of PFB files. And
at least for bsr, only a part can be replaced by LM.

That is close to case 1 in the first list: change the fd files. (I don't
see a possibility to offer both choices.) It would be nice if we had an
intermediate LaTeX release that would not only use the LM fonts but also
switch to T1 encoding as default and fix some other problems in LaTeX 2e
that cannot be corrected without formating changes. But this is very
unlikely to happen.

Definitely not easy. Norbert has implemented this for the cm-super
packages in Debian, but their installation happens on a much more
controled system. BTW, there is one nice thing about pfb2t1c and t1c2pfb
that I forgot to mentione. One can actually put a hole series of PFB
files into on T1C file (eg the complete cm-super fonts). Simply calling
t1c2pfb on that single file will produce all PFB files with proper
names.

No, it is question of users not ready documentation and therefore
forgetting to add \usepackage{lmodern} to their documents that use T1
encoding. Unfortunately a rather realisitic situation.

Since the main size limitation lies in the installation medium, it is
difficult to imagine how such a choice could be offered. Only if some
other size reduction technique is employed (eg pfb2t1c) so that the full
cm-super could stay on the install CD, such a choice could be offered if
somebody invests the time. I had considered doing the splitting sketched
in case 3 for the cm-super packages in Debian, which could of course
also be used in TL. But I am not sure if I find the time for this in the
near future. :-(

I think this may be true if you try to install everything, but I have
recently had to install TeX on three old-desktops-recycled-to-servers
(basically 300MHz processor, 2.5Gb disk, 256Mb memory) and with 128Mb
more memory I managed to trim down FC5 to just over 1Gb and installed
TL basic so that some graduate students have somewhere to do their
theses. It's not ideal, but in an academic environment where there is
zero money available it *is* just possible.

During a tidy-out recently I found an old 30Mb HardCard (for the benefit
of younger readers, this was a hard disk mounted on a standard PC card
so you literally opened the lid, put it in, and closed the lid and you
suddenly had an extra 30Mb hard disk). On it I discovered a complete
copy of WordStar 1512 and emTeX, so I stuffed it into a colleague's XP
system and rebooted, and was able to open a command window, edit a file
run it through LaTeX, print it to disk using dvihp, and copy/b to the
attached printer :-)

They are already in 'scheme-context.scheme'. They also belongs to

when did thumbpdf stop being a standalone script (called by a shell
wrapper).

making it a texexec call means latex users have to have to load
context bundle, regardless.

doesn't bother me (since i've got decent sized discs) but makes a bit
of a mockery of carefully separating the context and latex bundles.

    don't know about TL proper

I haven't updated context in TL yet.

Norbert/Frank, do you rebuild the Debian packages frequently?  E.g., do
the updates I have been making get reflected in some Debian test
package?  Or do you only trigger Debian building manually?  What I'm
really asking is whether there is any value to updating supp-*.tex now,
separately from updating context?

    could put these two files into the MetaPost collection instead?

Well, of course those two files could be moved, just requires some more
script hacking to move them out of a context directory when context is
updated, and into some other directory.  I'd have to think about how
best to handle it.

Anyway, it does seem to make sense to separate them so that (La)TeX
users can benefit from them without necessarily having to install all of
ConTeXt.  Hans, is it ok with you?  (Naturally, they wouldn't be in any
big latex package either, so that context users would have to install
all of latex to get them :)

Thanks,
Karl

Probably simply because it's one of the very few free high-quality
fonts.  So having support for it readily available is a good thing.

However, "required" is clearly up for interpretation, since TL does not
include Utopia and that's "required" too.

    What is the point of this package, anyway? 
    
I don't know where those files came from.  From the README, it has to do
with the hsb color model.  Sebastian?  Anyone?  Am tempted to blow it
away, since it's nothing in the live tree and it's not on CTAN.  Can't
tell who wrote it, can't tell license.

No it is not. The psnfss 00readme.txt states this clearly:

No, no need. Only tell me if there is something important to be updated

Ok, I see the point. If someone only want context, he still needs this
packages, but not the full latex bunch.

So we leave it like it is, or?

Well, what are the less far-reaching ones? Send me an answer to the

it, no need to do it yourself (it is only editing of the collection-*
tpms, or?)

Ok.

In fact I have reverted this change in Debian. Currently in TL it is a
link to texexec, which executes the .pl in TEXMFDIST. I moved for the
Debian packages the .pl script into /usr/bin instead of the link. I
would say this makes more sense.

If I recall correctly, the problem is not the license itself

 > Permission to use, reproduce, display and distribute the listed
 > typefaces is hereby granted, provided that the Adobe Copyright

but the fact that it is unclear where the license files on CTAN come
from.

I asked Werner Fink from SuSE and he forwarded my mail to a few people
at SuSE who are involved in license stuff.  Juergen Weigert and
Egbert Eich pointed me to:

 http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/xorg/font/adobe-utopia-75dpi/README?view=markup

The original license is obviously in the Xorg sources again.  It seems
that Kevin Martin found it in the X11R5 sources half a year ago.

No good news for Thanh, though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Indeed, there is no Debian package build from collection-binaries, only
from collection-basebin.

Hi Norbert,

Really glad you wrote :).

    ctan2tds or so

I've written some wrapper scripts around ctan2tds.pl and tpm-factory.pl
and others - see http://tug.org/texlive/pkgupdate.html, which I just
wrote.  So doubtless it needs improving, let me know.  And the process
described there has itself never been used by anyone but me, so it's
likely that there are hidden assumptions in the scripts that I didn't
think of.

Let me know ...

Thanks much,
karl

thumbpdf is not related to context or texexec so i think that there is 
an error there:

texexec = self resolving stub to calling parent => texexec.pl

pdfthumb => link to texexec => self resolving stub to calling parent => 
pdfthumb.pl

anyhow, the context texexec.pl script has been replaced by a ruby variant

the recommended way to cal context related scripts (for unix) is as 
follows but there are alternatives possible (up to the packager)

- copy texmfstart.rb (from scripts/context/ruby) to a 
someplace/bin/texmfstart

- create stubs in bin, either manually, or by using:

texmfstart --make all

such a stub looks like:

#!/bin/sh
texmfstart texexec.rb $@

so, texmfstart is the launching program. I've introduced this approach 
for several reasons:

- this way i'm independent of changes in tds (i only need to adapt 
texmfstart) in the sense that i can provide backaward compatibility 
(i've been bitten in the tail too often)
- it does some caching of paths (passing kpse lookups to child calls) 
when scripts call other ones which speeds up processing
- by using 'texmfstart somescript' directly one does not need stubs 
which avoids conflicts with names
- it can be used (in web server apps) to  initialize multiple tex trees 
(needed when one runs old and new trees in parallel)
- it can act as a kpse server (by using a built in kpse functionality) 
which in more complex workflows is faster
- it can locate and launch documentation and/or assiciated programs
- it can be used to launch application that need full paths to resource 
files in the texmf tree
- some more

the collection of scripts that come with context is rather large and not 
all of them need to be stubbed; the prefered list is:

texexec (former perl script, now ruby script with integrated texutil; 
manages tex runs and creates formats)
texutil   (former perl script, now ruby script, stripped down 
functionality, will become obsolete
texfont  (perl script, will be ruby script some day, creates tex font 
metric files)
pstopdf (former perl script, now ruby script, assumes gs and optionally 
imagemagick and inkscape to be present)
mptopdf (perl script, will become integrated in mpstools)
makempy (perl script, will become integrated in mpstools)
ctxtools (ruby script)
pdftools (ruby scrip)
xmltools(ruby script)
textools (ruby script)
mpstools(ruby script)
tmftools (ruby script)
exatools (ruby script)
runtools (ruby script)
rlxtools (ruby script)

existing aliases in the alias file (when present) related to context 
need to be  removed (should not have been present in the  first place)

in order  to work well with xetex, aleph and pdftex, contex assumes that 
the TEXFONTMAPS path is set to: (i get reports that this is not the case 
in linux distributions)

TEXFONTMAPS   = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{$progname,pdftex,dvips,}//

So far,

Hans

sure, you can package any way you want, but in order to avoid conflicts i suggest that they are taken from the regular context file set and still end up in 

tex/context/base  

and not somewhere else so that we don't get duplicate entries when users do install context. 

(there is a cont-mpd zip file that only has this mp relatex stuff)

    What do we need the collection-pdfetex for? It does *not* contain the
    pdfetex binary, but only pdf related stuff:

A number of other collections depend on it: collection-context,
-htmlxml, -langczechslovak, -latex.  And scheme-full, scheme-gust,
-gutenberg, -medium, -xml.

I don't know what to make of it all.  In particular it does seem
right for collection-context to depend on something that includes a
bunch of latex packages.

In general, your changes seem fine to me too.  Do you want to start
making some of of less far-reaching ones now, or have me do it, or?


As far as ufplm.fd goes, the question is, where does that file originate
= where is it maintained?  Psnfss, right?  Then yes, it would be
desirable to remove it from mathpazo.  I'll look at that.

Thanks,
karl

when i generate a new cont-tmf zip, i also make a cont-mpd.zip file which contains those files, 

supp-*.tex files don't update that frequently but i somethimes stumble into old ones that date from the time that they were located in the pdftex related downloads, so best remove old copies from tex source trees, the tug web site (not sure if they are still in the pdftex section) etc

after a request from karl, we've junked all copies on the archive
except macros/pdftex/graphics which is supposed to contain an
expansion of current cont-mpd.zip for the benefit of non-context
users.

(for some reason it also contains a .pdf file: i don't know why...it
will probably get deleted in the course of the next 24 hours.)

Good news. Stephan Ulrich wrote the following to the bug I reported:

  Oops, sorry, my comment was a bit premature ... turns out that it *is*
  possible to force input focus for the text field also in Xaw; patch is
  attached. Committed to 22.84.11-RC9 (STABLE) and 22.84.13-CVS11
  (HEAD).

So, as far as I am concerned, there is no need for an alternative
compiled with lesstiff anymore.

The only mu in *CM* is in the math italic fonts, which cannot be
replaced by LM. Actually this mu seems to be the model for the mu in
LM. I think you are talking about the mu in *EC*. The LM-mu is indeed
much better than the EC-mu. Interestingly, for the commen usage '?m',
IMO the combination EC-metrics with LM-fonts looks best, but that
doesn't work in other cases ... 

> and dollar to start with 

In which font shape? At least in CM Roman and LM Roman the dollar signs
have identical outlines.

In case you where refering to the section sign ?. Here the shape in LM
is an imporvement over CM/EC (though the glyph looks a bit to dark IMO).
It does have different metrics, though, as one could see from my EC-LM
example. This does not cause problems when one tries to replace CM by LM
because the section sign is taken from CMSY, which can't be replaced by
LM. So there are no changes here.

Good news indeed.  Does this work with both focus-follows-mouse as
well as click-to-focus?

it's currently an S with some vertical bars; there was some discussion 
about it at eurotex 2005 as well;

anyhow, afaik changing it is not on the agenda now

i must admit that i don't know anything about CM/EC (i.e. the EC part) since i never used it (only aer) and with regards to ConTeXt i never had any much user interest for it either, so we could switch to LM without problems (apart from changes in names and map files in the process)

With click-to-focus: perfect. Thanks, Stephan!

With focus-follows-mouse:

  After hitting Ctrl-F, the search box has focus so that you can type
  the search text. Fine. Then, if you hit Enter several times so that
  xdvi starts searching again from the top of the file, the search box
  loses the focus, but I suppose that's not a surprise for people who
  use focus-follows-mouse mode (because xdvi showed a new dialog box in
  the meantime asking whether to wrap-around the search).

I couldn't reproduce this with either of Gnome 2.4, KDE 3.2, fvwm or
twm: hitting RETURN repeatedly should close the dialog box and return
to the search window with the focus unchanged. Which window manager
are you using? (Maybe we should take this back to the SourceForge bug

OK. I'm putting both lists in Cc again, then. I think we're getting at
the end of this subthread (with a positive outcome), and I'd find it
awkward to leave people on these lists with unanswered questions (but I
recognize it's a bit off topic for the texlive list, sorry).

IIRC, the confirmation dialog did appear over the search dialog, but the
mouse pointer was elsewhere from the beginning of the experiment (and
wasn't magically moved by the WM). I did the whole test with the
keyboard only, and wasn't "lucky" enough to have the search dialog box
appear right under the mouse pointer!

Hans, we discussed that 2 (or 3) years ago
("can we separate supp-miss.tex and supp-pdf.tex from the whole
context package, so latex (and even plain pdftex) users could use that
without installing the whole context?"). The answer was "no" and I 
undestand your arguments. As those files should go into _the same_
tex/context/base/ directory along with other context files, we cannot
make separate package for them, as it would break the whole concept
of packaging. So we are at the same point for TL and other distribution,
and pdflatex users have to install also context (which is done
more or less at the scheme- level).
(having the same files in the two different packages on CTAN archives
is completelly different mater here).

Perhaps it is good time to gather such files into tex/generic/context
(something similar as cont-mpd.zip on CTAN with an exception of not using
here tex/context/base), but I undestand well that for context users
supp-* are still pretty well _base_ files.
wdyt?

I don't understand that.  Why shouldn't it be possible to have two or
more tpm files put ordinary files into the same directory in a TEXMF
tree, and remove only their "own" files when they are removed?  Maybe
I'm missing something specific to TeXLive, but generally I would say
that this is exactly the point of "packaging".  At least if this is more
than just zip'ing up things, and keeps a list of installed files around
or in the installation program.

> So we are at the same point for TL and other distribution,

Linux distributions surely do *not* have that problem; we can just move
supp-*.tex to a different deb/rpm than the other context files.

indeed, i'm not going to put generic context files under tex/generic; 
too much work for me, and of no use either; it would also make my own 
source tree hard to maintain

indeed, the only trickery is to make sure that when users have installed 
context and want to de-install latex, that the supp- files stay there, 
but i happily leave that to the packagers; i assume that tex is not the 
only package where files are shared

the files probably could be put in (say) tex/plain/generic/context or so, if one can assure that context (when used) does not see them first (which i would expect from alphabetic ordering) but that too much depends on the way the file system is written; if the texmf.cnf file is ok, then context will search its own directories first, so that's no problem either, apart from more tricky updating and so;

I meant move.  Having the same file twice in a TEXMF tree is not
desirable.  As already discussed in this thread, we wouldn't move it
into a tpm that contains lots of LaTeX stuff, but in some other, small
tpm which then would be needed by LaTeX and ConTeXt.  How this splitting
would be reflected in Debian package I cannot tell (not familiar enough
with the splitting).  

The point I wanted to make is that thanks to deb or rpm packaging, it is
easy to move files around between packages, contrary to what I
understood from Staszeks mail.  I was not talking about a specific
suggestion for supp-*.tex.

I hope you meant to say copy instead of move. Otherwise context users
would be forced to install latex to get a working system, basically
creating the same problem in reverse, but even worse (*every* context
user needs those files).

Yup you do. Building of tpm files is semiautomatic as it scans the tree
and puts all the files in "foobar" called directories into the tpm
foobar.tpm. THere are of course some exceptions, but we try not to have
too many.

If I am wrong, Karl, Sebastian,  correct me.

Oh, I see. There would be a package matching cont-mpd.zip's contents,
and a package matching cont-tmf.zip _minus_ cont-mpd.zip.

Hm, I thought that updating texlive is not supported, and a new tree is
created anyway?  And for the Debian packages, we can use Depends: with
proper versions in them to ensure the files are always there.

  hm, i'd keep the files in cont-tmf as well, since what would happen if 
  someone has an old mpd and then installs a newer tmf

we see here the conflict between maintenance of context, as a separate
object, and the maintenance of tex systems as a whole, which task
involves some context code that is of use to systems other than
context.

from my point of view, maintaining a the contents of cont-mpd
separately seems eminently reasonable; from yours, it seems to me that
cont-mpd is no better than a slight distraction that you generate pro
bono.

this is all very tedious, and comes from the undisputed fact that
there are people who really don't want latex, or really don't want
context.

perhaps there ought to be two completely separate distributions of
cont-mpd, like ghostscript/afpl and ghostscript/gnu -- one of those
distributions is nominally separately maintained by a non-context
person, who "blesses" any changes you make into the non-context
distribution.

note that this is an attempt to "square the circle" of the two
requirements without imposing an extra load on you -- i wouldn't dream
of suggesting you're not capable of doing the job.

well, updating context between tex live releases is done by means of 
users unzipping the cont-tmf file in texmf-local and then regenerating 
the formats

(or, once a user has a running system, he/she can do "ctxtools --update" 
which will fetch the zip, unzip the changes, and regenerate the formats)

i have no problem with providing 

supp-pdf-ripoff.tex 
supp-mis-ripoff.tex 

which tne can be put someplace else in the tree (i.e. someone whould then adapt latex to load that file); the independent mptopdf format is something else; if someone wants that, installing the context tex files is a small price to pay (mptopdf provides more features and may even demand more context support files once metapost gets extended). 

(these files then will be distributed as part of mptopdf alongside other files and it's up to maintainers to move them to the right spot) 

(i can then start optimizing supp-pdf for context [which so far i didn;t do because of its generic character] without the need to keep latex usage in mind and only critical patches could make it into the copy)

It still is, the confusion is in the name of the generic shell wrapper
that does "perl `kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts $0` ...", which got
called "texexec" instead of "generic_wrapper_to_run_perl_scripts".

On debian with texlive:
$  file $(which thumbpdf)
/usr/bin/thumbpdf: symbolic link to `texexec'

For many (pdfe)TeX users, context has become is an essential utility due to the
mpost support macros and robust scripts for pstopdf, pdftrimwhite, etc .

btw -- the current context provides a "texmfstart" script, so
"perl `kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts texexec.pl` ..." has become
"ruby `kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts texmfstart.rb` texexec.rb ...".

So the "generic_wrapper_to_run_scripts" formerly known as texexec
needs to have a ruby counterpart, or we a new script that "knows"
which names get passed to perl and which ruby.

Hope your disk has space for ruby too!

A free license that allows derived works? Thanh wants to add Vietnamese
glyphs to Utopia. Unfortunately the current license of Utopia does not
allow derived works. The above license is just the old one that has been
present on CTAN all the time. It had been lost in the XFree and Xorg
sources, though. It seems they have now copied it from some X11R5
sources. Hence Utopia can go back into t1-xfree86-nonfree or however
this package will be called next, but not into TL.

Good question. Adobe does not grant you the right to modify the fonts,
though: 

Permission to use, reproduce, display and distribute the listed typefaces
is hereby granted,
[...]

It might be that Adobe had a differnt intention, but by the above I
don't see how anybody but Adobe would be allowed to make chages to
these fonts. :-(

well, the x people should ask that then, maybe something: "if we modify the font, do we still need to add the adove reference, or do we need to state explicitly that adone is no longer responsible for the design"; 

i can also imagine that they hav eno problem with "extending the font with missing glyphs"

Hi,

This is the first time I try to use package curve with my Debian texlive
distribution, and found the following problem when pdflatex'ing my cv (it
is supplied a pdf photo file):

This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.30.5-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)

Indeed the file is not there, although a ltxtable.tex is.  Can somebody
please let me know where this should be reported (if this is not the right
place) or what needs to be corrected in my procedure?

It is not desirable in general.  But it is probably ok in this case
because it is used by two independent systems which have their own
kpathsea search paths.

Hi Sebastian,

    ! LaTeX Error: File `ltxtable.sty' not found.

TL did not install ltxtable properly.  So you reported it to the right
place :).

For the moment, you can get ltxtable.{sty,tex} from:
http://tug.org/teTeX/release/3.0/texmf-dist/tex/latex/carlisle/

I'll see about fixing it for this year's TL release.

Thanks,

Re Utopia, I have been working with a good fellow at Adobe (whom Thanh
wrote to originally) to get the license clarified.  We are close.
Pretty much the only remaining barrier at this point is that the legal
guy who has to sign his name to the document is on vacation for a few
weeks.

All in all, I am moderately hopeful that at least by the time TL'06
rolls around, we will have a truly free Utopia that can be included.
However, nothing's done until it's done.  Time will tell.

Re supp-*.tex.

Having LaTeX load duplicate files named supp-*-whatever.tex seems
like a recipe for inconsistencies to me.  But if we want to go this
route, it could be done without any need for time spent by Hans.
   
E.g., the little shell script I wrote to autoupdate cont-mpd on CTAN
could just make a copy of the files under the names, say, supp-*-mpd.tex
(or -ripoff if that's what Hans really prefers :).  Then we could have a
package/tpm just with those files required by latex.

But there's no point in doing this unless the LaTeX maintainers agree to
make the changes to load the files under the new names.  I don't know
who to ask about that.

Having a version of the macros for latex that is actually forked and
maintained independently (by who?) seems like a poor outcome to me,
which is more likely to cause problems than anything else.

Karl

P.S. If the package to be able to use mps in latex happened to be a
standalone program that took a few mb, no one would complain and the
question would not arise.  So just pretend context is that program.
See?  No problem :).

ACK. I have not expected how difficult it seems to be within TL to
associate some files with a different TPM ...

:-) The problem is more that many people it is not clear that they need
(parts of) ConTeXt for this MPS to PDF conversion. However, the new
pdftex.def should make things better.

actually, we don't maintain pdftex.def any more (it's not even in the
graphics driver file) -- heiko's formally looking after it (as opposed
to de facto looking after it).

hans seemed to suggest he had reasons to fork, anyway.

Automatically generating tpm's has both advantages and disadvantages,
for sure.  I have had to make a lot of tweaks to get things to work out,
but overall, I am glad Fabrice wrote the tpm-factory.pl that he did.

Norbert,

I recall that you (and/or Frank) put together a script last year which
pushed license information from the Catalogue into the TL TPM files.  I
asked you to hold off actually running it on the master files at that
point since it was close to the release.  

So now is the time to actually instate it ... and this means a change to
the DTD, right?

    Ok, I see the point. If someone only want context, he still needs this
    packages, but not the full latex bunch.

That would make sense, but I left the crucial "not" out of my sentence:
it does *not* seem right for context to depend ...

I don't know what to do with it right now.

    Well, what are the less far-reaching ones? Send me an answer to the

    it, no need to do it yourself

Ok, thanks.  I will reply again in a bit.

    (it is only editing of the collection-* tpms, or?)

As far as which packages go in which collection, yes, that is all.

all fine, please do it.

	move jurabib from lang-de to bibtex-extra
	move juramisc, jurarsp, juraabbrev from latex-extra to lang-de
I assume you mean collection-langgerman.  Maybe you call it lang-de
in Debian (a much more logical name :)?  Anyway, the moves are fine.

        collection-chemistry => collection-science
fine ... except do we care at all about a chemistry (or science)
collection?  Would a user ever bother to install just that?  I find it
hard to imagine.

	move from latex-extra to publishers

also fine, except same question as above: would any user ever just
install collection-publishers?  Again, I find it hard to imagine.  Do we
need to bother making the distinction?

	merge other scientific packages
	(units, scipaper, textopo, algorithm,...)
	into a new latex-science
I suggest putting those scientific packages simply into
collection-science [if it remains] instead of bothering with
latex-science.  Is there any significant non-latex science?

May I vote against that? Hans, please, it would be a horror to keep
the two instances, even for you. Not to mention that latex users have to 
follow that (also in all existing documentations), and... even pdftex 
basic example should be changed.
Let's try to find an another solution which could satisfy all (not only
latex and context users :-)
Please, consider that supp* files were adopted by the rest of the world
(Robin and Karl have already kindly mentioned well that).
So, having always in mind that such files are _basic_ for context users,
would you please consider moving them to tex/generic/context/
Of course, you can still keep such a new layout in cont-tmf.zip.
Both pdflatex and context users could benefit it in the real distributions
like TL, MiKTeX, etc. All in all, the packagers like Karl or Christian or me
could provide collections like "context" (context+cont-mpd), as well as
pdfetex (containing only cont-mpd). It would be somehow easier to follow such
exception for distributions.

ACK, I believe that Hans hears and would kindly accept my suggestions...

for me, it would introduce many problems with the trees that i have all over the place (there have been similar problems before when files moved due to changes in tds and i lost way too much time by that); 

of course, you're free to move the files there if you want, since the context zip only reflects one way of packaging 

also, there are more generic files in context (like syst-gen) which is used in ppchtex (actually, in the coming overhaul of context quite some files will become more generic); on the other hand, keeping files generic is rather painful [there have been quite some patches in supp-pdf because of interference with latex package loading for instance] 

now, since we're only talking of supp-pdf, i can imagine the following to happen

- i create a meta-pdf.tex file for context; there i can also start optimizing the code (speed up, using more context system features) 
- supp-pdf and supp-mis then are no longer used in context and can move 
to generic; i can still maintain them and provide patches (although the converter is by now rather stable) 

(btw, there is not that much real generic code in tex live -)

Indeed, I think that is only one collection that is meant here. Whether
one should call it 'science' or 'latex-sicence' is a differnet issue.
Since you asked why to introduce such collections, I guess I could add a
bit of reasoning here.

As Norbert said, this proposal originates from our discussion on TL in
Debian. There is one important difference between TL proper and TL in
Debian: In TL proper you can install individual packages defined by a
TPM file, while in TL in Debian you can only install complete Debian
packages at a time. These Debian packages follow roughly the collections
in TL. The result is that eg the texlive-latex-extra package is really
huge and can only be installed all or nothing. We have had users asking
for a more finegrained splitting, and IMO it makes sense to try to
achive this.

Now in principle we could just implement this in Debian. However,
Norbert does not want to diverge to much from TL proper, and I think
that TL itself could profit from a more finegrained splitting, too. I
have installed TL on win32 machines a few times, and it always took me
ages to find the packages I wanted in the huge list of packages in
latex-extra. I don't know what the unix installer looks like, but with
the win32 installer it would have been helpful to have smaller
collections which can be searched easier.

Rarely; but I think there are lots of users who would explicitly *not*
install it.  Separating such things makes sense, too, doesn't it?

One more issue, though:  In english, "science" is pretty much a synonym
to "natural sciences".  In other languages, for example german and
(according to dict.leo.org) french, the corresponding term
(Wissenschaft/science) is also used for humanities, social sciences
etc.  Therefore, collection-science might be misleading for many
users.  Not that I could suggest a better word...

Again, many users will *not* install it.  For example me.

Message-ID: <200606071659.k57Gxht23024@f7.net>

Hi Ralf,

    mathpazo.tpm contains many font files (pfb, afm, vf, tfm) and one LaTeX
    input file: texmf-dist/tex/latex/mathpazo/ufplm.fd. Most likely this is
    either a duplicate or an older version of the corresponding file in
    psnfss.tpm: texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfss/ufplm.fd. I would therefore
    suggest removing ufplm.fd from mathpazo.tpm. 

My question is, what generates ufplm.fd?  Isn't it the mathpazo fontinst
sources?  The top of the file says that it is generated by pazofnst.tex,
which is part of the mathpazo package.  (CTAN:fonts/mathpazo/pazofnst)

I tried actually running tex pazofnst.tex, but it failed to find
pplr8a.afm -- not surprisingly, since the afm's in mathpazo are named
fplm*.  So obviously the sources are not in sync with what was actually
used :(.

psnfss/psfonts.dtx says that it \ProvidesPackage mathpazo, but doesn't
actually generate any ufpl*.fd files that I can see.

However, notwithstanding all that, sibling fd files such as ufplmbb.fd
exist only in psnfss, even though they are listed in pazofnst/Makefile
(and ufplm.fd is not).

So, I kind of surmise that the fd files are generated in mathpazo and
then copied/redistributed in psnfss and removed from mathpazo.  And
ufplm.fd was left behind in mathpazo by mistake.

This all seems pretty fuzzy, but anyway, I removed it from mathpazo.

Thanks,
karl

Indeed. mathpazo is part of PSNFSS. All metrics and fd of PSNFSS are
generated with fontinst. The sources for this can be found in
CTAN:/fonts/metrics/psnfss-source (or something like this).

Most likely. mathpazo used to be a separate package but was integrated
into PSNFSS at one point. However, there are worse things than this:

<rant>
I am really getting angry at the way TeX packages get handled in Ubuntu:

http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/tex/mathpazo-type1

shipping an old version of the actual fonts is not a good idea ... :-(

    the bar in \hbar is uncomfortably
    close to the top serif of the 'h'. 

I forwarded that to Jacko & Janusz.  Thanks.

    the too high dieresis in CM has been known for a long time, which is
    why german.sty and its descendants contain code to lower it.

Too bad.  I can't imagine any way the macros can know whether LM or CM
outlines are being used, since cmr10.tfm is being used in both cases.
And it would be a step backward to continue the too-high dieresis in LM.
Given this, it seems we cannot replace CM with LM.

    There is a further problem that the hinting of the LM fonts is rather
    strange at the moment

I reported that to J&J too.

Thanks again for your careful analysis.

Shouldn't collection-publishers contain *all* classes used to write conference or journal papers?
I don't find here the Elsevier classes I use in my field (elsevier, ifacmtg)
Besides, in
/usr/local/TeX/texmf-dist/tex/latex
there is a IEEEtran directory next to the IEEEconf one.

I made some changes to the Tpm.pm module to actually save this, the
changes are minimal, I include them here. If you agree I (or you) check
them in.

In fact we are not using them anymore, because we wrote some scripts to
use the texcatalogue automatically for tpm files, so to say separatng
this out. 

Furthermore, we have extended the license information in the Catalogue.
A typical entry now looks like:
In abstract.xml:

<license type='lppl' version='1.1' checked='2006-02-08' username='norbusan'/>

which means that the abstract package in version 1.1  is of lppl, and the
user norbusan (me) has checked this on checked='2006-02-08

The full dtd entry for license in the catalogue is now:
<!ELEMENT license (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST license 
  type (artistic|bsd|dfsg|fdl|gfsl|gpl|gpl2|gpl3|knuth
       |lgpl|lppl|lppl1.2|lppl1.3|gfsl|nocommercial

  version  CDATA #IMPLIED
  file     CDATA #IMPLIED>


licence	type of license
checked	date of check
version	version of the package checked
username	who checked
file	where is the license information

Up to now only Frank and me have checked licenses and slowly adding
these information to the TeX Catalogue. It is a pain, but well ...

The patch I did did only read the license field and wrote it into the
tpm file, so either we extend this patch to copy everything, or we take
the patch as is.

Here is the patch with some comments. Please tell me how we should
continue? Extending the patch to get all the information into the tpm
file (will it work?), or...?

(patch is also attached)


--- /usr/TeX/texlive-src/Master/Tools/Tpm.pm	2005-11-19 20:49:53.000000000 +0100

Hi all!

Can someone help me with my svn problem. I want to submit something, and
it always goes like this:

svn commit
(edit commitmessage)
Authentication realm: <svn://tug.org:3690> texlive
Password for 'norbert': 
Authentication realm: <svn://tug.org:3690> texlive
Username: preining
Password for 'preining':

Committed revision 1665.

Ok, my username here is norbert, this is true, but I checked out the
files as preining at tug.org, and my .svn/entries tells me:
   url="svn://preining at tug.org/texlive/trunk"
   repos="svn://preining at tug.org/texlive"
So I would have supposed that it should work, but it doesn't. Any ideas?

Best wishes

Norbert

CORFE (n.)
An object which is almost totally indistinguishable from a newspaper,
the one crucial difference being tat it belongs to somebody else and
is unaccountably much more interesting that your own - which may
otherwise appear to be in all respects identical. Though it is a rule
of life that a train or other public place may contain any number of
corfes but only one newspaper, it is quite possible to transform your
own perfectly ordinary newspaper into a corfe by the simple expedient
of letting somebody else read it.

for a while there have been composed characters with lowered umlauts in 
the lm beta fonts (actually, context even supported that -) but for some 
reason those variants have been removed (maybe because no one was using 
them); there are some alternatives in lm (.alt, .prep, .oldstyle, .dup 
.ts1, .. e.g. there is an alternative $ as well: dollar.os); i suppose 
that reintroducing the e|o|i|u umlauts again in lm is not that complex, 
but even then, one will need to make an associated set of encoding files 
(context ships with a few) as well as enable the fonts etc etc

(btw, lowering the umlauts 'manually' will break hyphenation; also, 
maybe germans want their umlauts low, that is not to say that other 
countries/languages want them low as well)

ad 2) collection-chemistry/-science

Reading through the list of packages in collection-latexextra I have a
hard time to make a selection what to move to -science and what not.
Where do we draw (IF WE DO!) the line? Computer science move yes or no,
some special packages yes or no, radical approach?

I would opt for a radical approach to move *everything* which is somehow
related to natural sciences, linguistic, philosophy etc into this
package. This way we would get two decent sized collections where
latexextra contains stuff which is generally usefull, while science
cotains specific stuff.

current -chemistry plus
(from latex-extra)
  SIunits -- International System of Units.
  begriff -- Typeset Begriffschrift.
  bibleref -- The bibleref package.
  biocon -- Typesetting biological species names
  bitfield -- Draw bit field data structure diagrams.
  bytefield -- Create illustrations for network protocol specifications.
  clrscode -- Typesets pseudocode as in Introduction to Algorithms.
  complexity -- Computational complexity class names
  computational-complexity -- The computational-complexity package.
  covington -- Linguistic support.
  ednotes -- Typeset scholarly edition.
  formula -- Typesetting physical units.
  functan -- macros for functional analysis and PDE theory
  hepparticles -- Macros for typesetting high energy physics particle names.
  hepunits -- A set of units useful in high energy physics applications.
  karnaugh -- Typeset Karnaugh-Veitch-maps.
  ledmac -- Typeset scholarly editions in parallel texts.
  linguex -- Format linguist examples.
  metre -- Support for the work of classicists
  mhs -- Historical mathematics.
  miller -- Typeset miller indices.
  nassflow -- Drawing Nassi-Schneidermann diagrams and flowcharts.
  newalg -- Format algorithms like Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest.
  objectz -- Macros for typesetting Object Z.
  rst -- Drawing rhetorical structure analysis diagrams in LaTeX
  struktex -- Draw Nassi-Schneidermann charts
  t-angles -- Draw tangles, trees, Hopf algebra operations and other
   pictures.
  textopo -- Annotated membrane protein topology plots.
  youngtab -- Typeset Young-Tableaux.

This is a tentative list, if someone wants to go through the packages
you are welcome.


BUT: We have to decide whether we really want to do this, it is hard to
find a decision for some packages, but a splitting into two vaguely
normal sized collections would be nice.




3) collection-pdfetex

As discussed, we leave this package as context depends on the tpms
inside (or wants them), but maybe not all the latex packages.

What is open is the stuff of microtype/pdfcprot

> * pdfcprot/microtype
> 	move pdfcprot to latex-extra
> 	move microtype to pdfetex (but see below)

microtype is latex only, or? Does context have any use of the microtype
package? (maybe the def files for char protruding?).

If no, the we should put it into latex-recommended, if yes, into
-pdfetex.

OTOH pdfcprot: Is it used by context? Does itmake sense to have it in
-pdfetex?



Thanks a lot for the attention and all the best

I don't think these packages belong in a collection named with the
English word "science".

Other than that, I have no particular objection to moving the ones you
have suggested into collection-science.

    microtype is latex only, or?

AFAIK yes.

    Does context have any use of the microtype package?
    
I believe it is all built in, somehow.

    OTOH pdfcprot: Is it used by context? 

I doubt it.

Hans?

In general, I can't get a grip on collection-pdfetex right now.  Maybe
we should come back to it later.

Thanks,

Try version 1.00.  Jacko told me that some hints are wrong in the old
version because the description in the Adobe docs are not clear.

Version 1.00 is *much* better.

Jacko is still interested in bug reports.

Ok, linguist I included into science, but we can leave it in extra, ok

Easy: context people need these packages or want these packages, but not
the rest of the latex world. So -pdfetex collects stuff which is usefull
for both latex and context people.

iirc, microtype has in effect taken over from pdfcprot (it appeared
around the same as the last release of pdfcprot in 2004).

certainly microtype is the only one under active maintenance, just
now.   (and it's got a better name -- not hinting that it's a pdf-only
package...)

Same problem, now the other way round:  English speaking people will not
expect linguistic stuff in "science".  Is there a word for
"Wissenschaft" or french "science" in english?

    "Wissenschaft" or french "science" in english?  

Doesn't having collection-science be natural sciences result in a big
enough package that we don't need to try to make further distinctions?

    In fact we are not using them anymore, because we wrote some scripts to
    use the texcatalogue automatically for tpm files

I don't understand.  Certainly using the Catalogue for anything we can
is desirable.

    Furthermore, we have extended the license information in the Catalogue.

In the original Catalogue, or in a Debian variant thereof?

    Please tell me how we should continue? 

Seems like including all the licensing info would be best, I see no
reason not to.  But you are the ones who want it and wrote the patch, so
whatever you want to do is fine with me :).

    The first block is only here to define a mapping from TeX live tpm names
    to Catalogue entries.

In at least some of these cases, I think it would be easy (and better)
to simply change the tpm name to match the Catalogue name.  Probably
can't make it 100%, but where possible.  And maybe in some cases the
Catalogue name could/should be changed.

I notice several of your special cases are just case changes.  Here I
think it would be better to simply check for the $name and then
lc($name) instead of having to list them explicitly.


Anyway, the change itself seems fine to me.  I guess I should check it
in and try to rebuild the tpm's first.  I'll wait until we/you decide
about the "extra" info first, though.

Thanks for the careful explanations.

Sorry, I was unclear: At first I used the tpm license entries to
generate a Licenses file fro Debian. Now I am using another script Frank
and I have developed to list all the files and the respective licenses.
So currently we do *NOT* use the license information provided in the tpm
files, because we think the central point should be the TeX Catalogue.

There is no Debian variant. It has been changed already everywhere, you
may not have noticed. At least in the cvs repository of the catalogue it
is changed.

> Seems like including all the licensing info would be best, I see no

Good with me. I think too that it makes sense. Maybe some other
application will/can use this information.

Will not work IMHO: The tpm names are derived from the direcory names
where the files are located, so we cannot arbitrary change names without
moving loads of files around. DO I miss something?

This should be easy.

If we can get the info in easily, perfect, but I have in fact *NO*
experience in extending the tpm dtd with the necessary pieces AND
extending the patch to get all the information.

I would start with the current status and see what happens. Afterwards
we can add more cases to include the additional fields from the
catalogue.

    Separating such things makes sense, too, doesn't it?

Not entirely, not to me.

So now when a Debian user wants to write a TUGboat paper, they would
have to figure out what collection it's in and install that separately.
This general problem of installing minimal/basic/small distributions and
then forcing users to figure out which additional packages have to be
downloaded in order to get their work done has probably frustrated more
people than any other single thing about TeX installations.  Isn't
letting people get their work done without fuss more important?

Along these lines, I discovered that WinEdt has a nifty feature of
parsing error messages and offering to download (through the miktex pkg
mgr) the right package.  Now *that* is a great feature, to my mind.
Maybe someday some Unixy/free equivalent can be implemented.  Then
having an initial small installation would not be so bad.

Anyway, whatever.

Hello,

I had problems installing texlive2005 on AIX52.

The installation routine after entering "Install" just ended with
something like error in install-tl line 51, test routine needs parameter.

It stopped installation at the end of routine "prepare_dirs" in common.sh.


After removal of trap command in this routine installation works ??? (!)

    Password for 'norbert': 

1) does 
  svn list svn://preining at tug.org/texlive
ask for a password?  It shouldn't (more than once).

2) does
  svn --username preining ...
work?

3) Auth information is stored in ~/.subversion/auth/.  Maybe if you poke
   around in those directories you can find entries for tug.org which
   explain why norbert is being tried first.  Or if you just remove them
   and try again, maybe it'll be saved properly.
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s02.html explains more, sort of.

I would expect that svn would of course try a saved username of preining
for a given repo before resorting to the system user name norbert, but I
do not know this for a fact.

We could just change your svn username to norbert :).

I have made this change in the dvipdfmx config files for TeX Live.

Christian, I imagine you'll want to do the same for MiKTeX.

Cho and Shunsaku, I'm not sure if it's in the dvipdfmx distribution
itself, but if so, I imagine you'll want to change it there too.

Indeed, which is why both LM and EC use an intermediate value between
those from CM and from CM + german.sty. IMO the precomposed glyphs are a

Unclear Adobe docs, that sounds like ghost hints <comparing old and new>
indeed, v0.99.3 has positive 'ghost hints' while v1.00 has negative
ones. That is indeed something that is not mentioned in the Type1
specifications. The problem with to many hints is still there, though.
And yes, I did sent a more detailed message to Jacko.

BTW, it looks as if the metrics have changed between v0.99.3 and v1.00,
eg the section sign is now narrower than before, so still wider than in
CM/EC. Guess I will redo some of my tests ...

This is known for a long time (credit goes to Walter Schmidt) and has
been reported to them before. The point is that there are good reasons
for this change. It just happens to have an unwanted side effect ...

I will have to retest with v1.00. Maybe there have been changes there.
Also, I am definitly not qualified to check the PL, CS and VN variants
of CM. Maybe it is possible to replace those. And atleast wrt to the to
low umlauts one could argue that people writing in German should use T1
encoding anyway, where this problem does not exist. Unfortunately,
nobody reads the documentation telling them so ... :-(

no, context is self contained and has its own font handlers (i suppose 
that microtype has to do with hz and fonts) and definition system (since 
context has beeen a test bed for early pdftex features,  there has never 
been a dependency)

since many context users use metapost, a dependency on some mp package 
makes sense

context third party modules are collected in the context wiki, and 
packaged in a tds structure; they are automatically uploaded to ctan and 
come with tpm files;  (i occasionally fetch them and collect them in a 
zip for downloading); if you run into context third party files that are 
in the wrong structure, you can mail to the context development (or 
announce) list or regular context support list and we will make sure 
that it is corrected (or in the worst case, removed).

context tex files can be recognized easy since there is a (kind of 
prescribed) structure in the names:

xxxx-yyy.tex : base files
xxxx-yy.pat|hyp: pattern files (not to be aliased!)
m-*.tex : tex related modules
x-*.tex: xml related modules
p-*.tex: private modules
t-*.tex: third party modules
s-*.tex: public style files
u-*.tex: user modules

context.tex : the main file
cont-en.tex  etc : different user interfaces

plus some readme and interface documentation files (xml format)

metapost files have names like:

mp-*.mp
metafun.mp

i don't even know what pdfcprot does; actually, there have never been 
dependencies on  other that the files that ship with context; nothing in 
generic is needed either (does not hurt if context wants to use plain as 
well)

(in the past i've seen remarks in linux distributions that context 
depended on pdftex and even that was wrong: it can run on any tex, not 
that it matters now since we only have pdfetex and xetex)

(i can send you a list of files that we use in the so called minimal 
context distributions)

So this means we could actually kill the collection-pdfetex and move the
packages to the respecitve places (partly latex-recommended, partly
latex-extra).

This is IMHO a good move if we all agree on this.

Concerning context: I am still hoping that someone is packaing context
independently from tetex and texlive, so that one package can be used
for both texlive and tetex IN DEBIAN. (hints hints hints for the lurkers
on these list, one of you want to take over this job!?!? ;-)

I would argue that both Math and Computer Science are kind of "special"
regarding (La)TeX, but I'm also not that much bothered with a -science
package, if it is not huge.

Oh, BTW, I have just released a new version of algorithms. I don't know
when you plan on releasing a new TL version, but I would appreciate if
the newest version were included.

BTW #2, I plan on doing a new update of algorithms to help improve the
documentation and incorporate support for new features. If the
"deadline" for the newer TL release is not "real soon now", then I would
like to get this version included in TL.

And I would volunteer to be (another of) Norbert's guinea pig for Debian
packages. :-)

I have in mind having a more or less minimal installation of Linux with
some packages for fellow co-workers to typeset their papers and some of
the systems where I will install things are quite old.

If I can end up with a live CD containing AUCTeX + Emacs + TL (or some
subset of it) and some tools for using the "interweb", then I guess that
I'd help many friends.


Thanks, Rog?rio Brito.

On the other hand, complaints are also frequently made by Debian users
that packages are too large, contain useless cruft, and force one to
download only the important things manually from CTAN.

But I don't have a strong opinion here, do what you think good.

Ok, since the CS, PL and VN versions of CM have official maintainers, I
assume that there will be some sort of announcement (especially for
distributers) when everything has been sorted out. 


Hans Hagen <pragma at wxs.nl> continues to write:

I don't understand this. The AE fonts are just a bunch of virtual fonts
to make CM look like (almost) T1 encoded.

Do you mean you are using LM with CM metrics, or have you changed to use
LM alltogether? I had assumed the latter were the case. And I really
would prefer if it were possible for LaTeX, too.

from the perspective of support (by usergroups, on tex related lists etc) i'd suggest to make packages not too small; otherwise one ends up with 'do you have this installed' kind of support with all related problem of users trying to locate what is missing 

(i think that open office would not be used that much if users had to install it in pieces or answer questions when installing; they just accept this 80 meg zip which expands to a few hundred meg; the same for compiling some simple prog on linux: if i have to install 60 meg kernel stuff because it's needed to resolve whatever needs to be resolved, who am i to complain; and i'm not even talking about updating 80% of a system in order to run a rdcent prog that demands the whole lot related to graphics to be updated too); nowadays a couple of uploads of one's vacation trip pictures takes much more than the average tex distribution; actually, if we could (snd some day will) run directly from zip files, nobody will notice the many files)

it depends what packaging is; on the context list are some users who made/discuss an rpm; i myself provide so called minimal context installations

i always understood that tex live could/did handle such things; for context users need (1) the base collection of fonts and (2) the content of the main context zip; 

in the so called minimals i use a different set of font metrics so that would mean that with regards to fonts only type1 and ttf is needed, but that's another story

No, which means that Debian users could call

	aptitude install context

and get a working context system. It would automatically install the
texlive binaries necessary (texlive-base-bin or tetex-bin) and run the
necessary scripts for format generation.

This way your releases would be faster mirrored to the Debian packages
(if the maintainer of the Debian packages does this fas enough)

packaging here meant creating a Debian package.

Most users learn one packaging system: SuSE -> yast2/rpm , RedHat ->
whatever/rpm, Debian aptitude/dselect/deb, ...

Hardly anyone wants to install any files from CTAN or so by hand.

the PL people are the same as the LM people; the CS maintainer are 
already discussing the move; the VN maintainers are aware of LM as well, 
so no additional announcements are needed; just wait till the PL/CS/VN

because context already had pl/cs/vn/etc support kind of hidden for the user (automatic) the change for users was not that large; no special packages need to be loaded and such

Thanks, no it is working. I forgot that I never have submitted anything.
BUT: It is strange: I have checked out as preining at tug.org, but when
submitting without having saved the password it assumes user $localuser.

So *ONE* time you have to specify the username and password, than it
works. Why it doesn't propose the right username in the beginning, I
have no idea.

Thanks a lot and best wishes

(i've not installed 1.0 at all, let alone looked at the maths...)

No.  I was also puzzled by Norbert's statement until I noticed I was
getting this mail via debian-tetex-maint at lists.debian.org, too.  Within
Debian, some parts of teTeX and TeXlive are not installed, and instead
there are separate packages with separate maintainers.  And consequently
more frequent updates.  For example, lmodern in Debian is 0.99.3, while
teTeX 3.0 has only 0.92.  beamer.cls/pgf is an other example: All have
in common that they are developed actively and have quite fast (and
important) releases.

It would really be nice if some Debian guy would offer to maintain a
separate ConTeXt package for Debian, so that the latest version is
always in Debian unstable, even if teTeX or TeXLive still contains an
outdated one.

The repository allows anonymous read access, and therefore svn didn't  
really use the "preining@" at all when you did a checkout, and so  
this username wasn't saved.

It proposes your local username if nothing else is either specified  
in the command or already cached; and it only caches your credentials  
when it actually authenticates for the first time, which hadn't yet  
been needed.

I assume Robin was refering to this:

    which means that tetex/texlive will become mainly a  latex installation?

I know Norbert didn't mean to imply otherwise, but just to be sure: TL
will of course continue to include context.

(And teTeX is moribund.)

    the newest version were included.

It will be.

    "deadline" for the newer TL release is not "real soon now", then I would
    like to get this version included in TL.

There is no deadline at this point, beyond "much later".  No problem to
include whatever version of algorithms is current when the time comes.

    If I can end up with a live CD containing AUCTeX + Emacs + TL (or some
    subset of it)

You'll definitely need to make a considerable subset to fit on a CD.
Maybe try scheme-medium for starters.

Anyway, if you do come up with a "live" package of TeX + friends, we
could certainly distribute it from tug.org if you like.  (Probably not
as a physical CD, though.)

Cheers,
karl

I just did some work on remastering the excellent Ubuntu. See
http://wiki.oss-watch.ac.uk/UbuntuDapper/Remaster

It would be (relatively) trivial to making a version
including a lot of TeX. Its just a matter of deciding
what else to throw away.

    that it matters now since we only have pdfetex and xetex)

Plain TeX (aka "tex"), as currently configured in TL, still uses the
more-or-less original TeX code, without etex or pdfetex changes.  Maybe
it's time to change that.  I wonder what Knuth would think.

I doubt he would be enthused, since it takes away his convenient
access to TeX executables of his own, making it harder for him to
judge the veracity of TeX bug reports (which he'll look at in 2006 and
2011 or so).  It also makes it harder for other developers to get a
quick idea about whether a bug is just in PDFeTeX or indeed TeX
itself.

Now technically speaking, the trademark and whatever restriction is on
the "TeX" name and banner.  The "tex" executable name should not be
covered.

What one could do is to have "tex" default to PDFeTeX and provide a
separate "plaintex" command in an optional collection that is kosher
Knuth.  And perhaps can even be configured to be the default "tex"
with the right symbolic links.

Anyway, history repeats itself the other way round.  The hoi polloi
who claim to use Linux rather than GNU will be the same that will
claim that they are typesetting their documents with TeX, when indeed
their typesetter will not be allowed to be called TeX by decree of
Knuth.

There probably is a fine joke in that, but I doubt I'd want to hear
it.

Hi Matthias,

    The installation routine after entering "Install" just ended with
    something like error in install-tl line 51, test routine needs parameter.

    It stopped installation at the end of routine "prepare_dirs" in common.sh.

    After removal of trap command in this routine installation works ??? (!)

Thanks for the report, but we can't just delete the trap command (and I
can't understand how it could have generated an error like you describe).

I wonder if it's an issue with the /bin/sh shell on AIX 5.2.  There's a
suggestion to run /bin/bsh under AIX.  Does /bin/bsh install-tl.sh work
any better?

If not, please run something like this if you can:
  /bin/sh -vx install-tl.sh --debug
and save all the output (both stdout and stderr), including the actual
error message(s).  With that, I might be able to figure out what is
going wrong.

Thanks,
Karl

    So currently we do *NOT* use the license information provided in the tpm

Ok.

    because we think the central point should be the TeX Catalogue.

Good.  Me too.

So therefore it seems to me that there is no need to change the tpm's to

    Will not work IMHO: The tpm names are derived from the direcory names

    moving loads of files around. DO I miss something?

Yes, directories would have to be renamed.  I don't suggest trying to do
this on a wholesale basis.  Just that, when we notice that a package
being updated for whatever reason has a name in the Catalogue that is
different from the tpm name, we install the update under the Catalogue
name (and eliminate the old one of course).

if there's a problem of this sort, it's probably a good idea asking
the ctan team and graham (all on the ctan list) whether the catalogue
entry ought to be renamed instead.  there's an awful lot of history to
the structure of the catalogue, and some of the names are just plain
eccentric.

Me too.  Never mind, sorry I mentioned it.

(Although even `tex' announces itself as `This is TeXk', but it is only
relatively small web2c-ish changes that caused that, not any significant

That's nothing in the binary that forces the "k". It is the texmf.cnf
settings which trigger this.

Maybe, there should be some kind of
  tex.parse_first_line = f
lines which disable "k" extensions for just "tex", so that the system
still has one format that meets Knuths requirements for saying "This is
TeX, ...".

Even if you could get LM to work with CM metrics the resulting
confusion should not be underestimated.  Look at Helvetica/Arial/URW
Nimbus Sans -- 99% of the world thinks they are using Helvetica, but
in reality 90% are using Arial, 8% are using URW Nimbus Sans, and 2%
actually have and use Helvetica.

People increasingly expect LaTeX to play well with ConTeXt and other
applications via SVG, PDF, etc.  If LaTeX substitutes LM for CM
without forcing users to realize the change, then users will want to
use CM in the other apps and wonder why some glyphs look different.

Many people are already using LM because they need the glyphs.
Forcing the rest to switch may create some short term angst, but in
the long term the TeX community benefits if most people can use the
same fonts and understand which fonts they are using.

It need not be that bad. In fact, CS fonts are overset of CM fonts, the
first half is identical. For the purpose of testing the possibility of
replacement cs*.pfb with lm*.pfb I typeset a part of real Czech test some
time ago with version 0.99.3, now with 1.00 (the previous version was
given to Boguslaw Jackowski). I you do not know that the text was prepared
with metrics of the CS fonts and the output created with LM fonts, you
will hardly be able to recognize it. Of course the metrics are slightly
different. You can see some small differences in line breaking if the text
is typeset directly with LM fonts.

Anyway, people who really need CM or CS fonts will most probably able to
instal them themselves.

Hi all,
I am forwarding the CTAN announcement. New version of Velthuis Devanagari
is already on CTAN. As discussed a few moths ago, the name of the package
has changed and velthuis.zip should replace the older devanagr.zip. The
preprocessor has also changed. The package contains statically linked
Linux binary as well as binaries for Windows and OS/2.

another issue to keep in mind is the following. imagine that one has a 
document that includes older documents (or graphics) that use cm; in the 
worst case one may end up with many instances of the same font; one 
reason is that lm has different [internal] names than cm [CMR10 and 
such]; so, in order to comfortably make the switch, one also needs to 
have map files that do something lile:

CMR10 CMR10 < cm.enc < lmr10

(and not the verbose lm name in the second column)

[another solution is to have multiple fontname entries in a map file, 
something that is on the agenda for pdftex]

Message-ID: <448D6CB0.60601@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

A while back Ivo Welch asked for a pdftex extension such that it
could handle unidirectional pipes (either inbound or outbound).
He was even willing to donate money for such a feature.

The easiest place to add this functionality was in the web2c specific
openclose.c (and because of the inherent system dependancy it is also
the most logical place), so I have written a (test) patch for this
and uploaded it to sarovar (also attached to this email message, it
is really small).

I've already received word from Akira that he will be happy to add
this functionality to W32TEX, so: could this be considered for
addition in the next TeXLive as well?
(I know it would make Ivo really happy and it would also result
in him donating some funds to the TeX Development Fund @ TUG).

The patch makes open_input() and open_output() assume file names
that start with the pipe symbol (|) are actually requests for
read or write pipes, so it allows TeX code like this:

    \input "| perl -e 'print sqrt(\value{page})'"

or

   \immediate\openout1 = "|sort > sorted.tex"
   \immediate\write 1 {b}
   \immediate\write 1 {a}
   \immediate\write 1 {c}
   \immediate\closeout1
   \input sorted


Cheers, Taco

In some programs (e.g., bibtex), shellenabledp becomes unresolved.
In such cases, I simply linked

/* shellenabledp.c
   for programs which need shellenabledp
*/
int shellenabledp = 0;

This surely is avoided by smarter way.

Akira

Hi,

This is my fault: because I was writing this for pdftex,
I never even considered the fact that the file is also used
for a lot of other programs (besides pdftex).

What we *could* inlcude are parts of the tpm<->TeX Catalogue naming

My first list was taken without too much objections, so here is another
proposal for collection-science which incorporates all this

collection-chemistry plus the following stuff from collection-latexextra
  SIunits -- International System of Units.  
  begriff -- Typeset Begriffschrift.
  biocon -- Typesetting biological species names
  bitfield -- Draw bit field data structure diagrams.
  bytefield -- Create illustrations for network protocol specifications.
  clrscode -- Typesets pseudocode as in Introduction to Algorithms.
  complexity -- Computational complexity class names
  computational-complexity -- The computational-complexity package.
  ednotes -- Typeset scholarly edition.
  formula -- Typesetting physical units.
  functan -- macros for functional analysis and PDE theory
  hepparticles -- Macros for typesetting high energy physics particle names.
  hepunits -- A set of units useful in high energy physics applications.
  karnaugh -- Typeset Karnaugh-Veitch-maps.
  metre -- Support for the work of classicists
  mhs -- Historical mathematics.
  miller -- Typeset miller indices.
  nassflow -- Drawing Nassi-Schneidermann diagrams and flowcharts.
  newalg -- Format algorithms like Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest.
  objectz -- Macros for typesetting Object Z.
  rst -- Drawing rhetorical structure analysis diagrams in LaTeX
  struktex -- Draw Nassi-Schneidermann charts
  t-angles -- Draw tangles, trees, Hopf algebra operations and other
   pictures.
  textopo -- Annotated membrane protein topology plots.
  youngtab -- Typeset Young-Tableaux.

Please tell me your opinion!


> 3) collection-pdfetex

As Hans explained that context has no necessity whatsoever of the stuff
in pdfetex, I would suggest killing this collection and moving the
packages/tpm contained in it a bit around, please comment to my
proposal:
  cmap -- Make PDF files searchable and copyable.
        cmap.sty and friends
                to latexrecommended
  etex -- An extended version of TeX, from the NTS project.
        etex.sty, etex.src, etexdefs.lib
                seems to be really basic, where do we put it? into
                collection-basicbin, or collection-basic?
  ifmslide -- Presentation slides for screen and printouts.
        latexextra
  pdf-trans -- Transformations of TeX boxes for pdfTeX.
        latexextra
  pdfcprot -- Activating and setting of character protruding using pdflatex.
        latexextra
  pdfpages -- Include PDF documents in LaTeX.
        latexrecommended
  pdfscreen -- Support screen-based document design.
        ??
  pdfslide -- Presentation slides using pdftex.
        latexextra
  pdftexdef -- The pdftexdef package.
        only source files with test contents, what is this, kill it?
  pdftricks -- Support for pstricks  in pdftex.
        latexextra or pstricks (in the later case note that pstricks does
        not depend on latex)
  pdfwin -- Customizable windows for screen output.
        latexextra
  xbmc -- Skeleton package.
        latexextra
  bin-pdftools -- Support tools for PDF files.
  bin-thumbpdf -- Thumbnails for pdfTeX and dvips/ps2pdf.
        2 "binaries", perl scripts, should be moved to basicbin, or?
  eso-pic -- Add picture commands (or backgrounds) to every page.
        latexrecommended


and in parallel move microtype to collection-latexrecommended.

Best wishes

IMO pstricks makes more sense.

FRAMLINGHAM (n.)
A kind of burglar alarm usage. It is cunningly designed so that it can
ring at full volume in the street without apparently disturbing
anyone. Other types of framlingams are burglar alarms fitted to
business premises in residential areas, which go off as a matter of
regular routine at 5.31 p.m. on a Friday evening and do not get turned
off til 9.20 a.m. on Monday morning.

AE fonts can be mapped to LM fonts. It will reduce the space required for
all *.pfb and I believe that the result will look nicer. Of course,
ae*.tfm must be preserved.

??? 
The AE fonts are a bunch of TFM and VF only, which are mapped to CM in
the end. There are no special PFB files. Where exactly do you want to
change this to LM?

BTW, the total size of these TFM and VF files is below 600K ...

Message-ID: <20060610092710.F260D3D87@string1.ciencias.uniovi.es>

Hello.

It is my first post on this list.  First of all, I want to acknowledge
the efforts in developing this fine TeX distribution.  In my humble
opinion, TeX Live is an excellent distribution for TeX users, perhaps
the best one for people that, as me, want to customize TeX not installing
superfluous packages that will never use.

Just a though: may I suggest providing DPS-enabled binaries for xdvik in
platforms that support it?  (e.g., Solaris)  Requiring GhostScript is
a bit odd on platforms that are able to render PostScript without
additional software.  Support for both DPS and gs would be great.

Cheers,
Igor.

thanks, robin.  IMHO, this may have been a simple change for Taco, but
I predict it will mean a quantum leap for users in the long run.  it
means nothing less than that end users can now write more complex
macros in a different way.

for example, without knowledge of tex programming, I can now compute
figures or rearrange text.  my first project will be to write a perl
function that takes a long tabular column, sorts it, and outputs a
latex table with multiple columns.  very easy to do in perl, magic in
latex.  then again, everything seems like magic in latex.  [perltex
was a good idea, but way too slow---and required a specialized install
and was not everywhere available.]  taco's new feature will hopefully
make latex far more attractive for end users in ways that we cannot
yet predict...

PS: I dropped an email to the webmaster at the tug donate web form,
which seems to refuse to accept my money.

regards,

/ivo

one more suggestion to the pdflatex maintainers:  it would be nice to
have a wrapper, suggestively named

   \pdfinput18{shell command whose stdout will be treated like
material from an input}

or perhaps pdfexec18 .

Really? I think I missed those. Although I am not sure if I would put

ACK. 

BTW, the 'emp' package for embedded MetaPost can go from c-latexextra to
c-metapost IMO.

Ooops, acronym and algorithm. Anyway. I have added unitsdef
to my list, it makes sense in -science. listings I would leave in
-extra.

It makes things platform dependent. You my try to get the list of JPG
files by \exec18{ls *jpg} which will run on unix systems but not on
Windows and OS/2 because ls does not exist (unless TeX is run from some
port of unix shell for such a platform). I see better future for
incorporating LUA because it will be the same everywhere.

Lua will not solve this problem either.  You still have to write:

    os.execute("ls *jpg")

In Perl you can at least use the builtin function readdir instead of
passing the command to a shell.  There are only a few functions in Lua
which interact with the operating system.

Well, VF's get around the problem of changing existing fonts (e.g., to
add missing glyphs or alternate shapes).  In my view the main drawback
is that such fonts are known only to TeX.

I don't consider an old document "broken" if there is a simple recipe
to make it work with a current system.  Carrying legacy cruft means
that users get "stability", but also means they have too many choices
so some will make bad ones, which ultimately causes problems for
users, consumes bandwdth on c.t.t., etc.

I suggest adding a texmf--D-E-P-R-E-C-A-T-E-D tree to support legacy
docs.  Packages in this tree should have added notes explaining what
changes should be made to existing documents to replace deprecated
packages with "recommended" ones.

A document is broken if it doesn't work.

TeX/LaTeX has been used as an exchange format, especially because it
is so stable.  This is its strength and I think it shouldn't be given
up.  It would be a mess if people have to repair their old documents
whenever they update their TeX systems.

An additional texmf tree doesn't solve anything because this is
invisible to a user.  Where do you want to put explanations?  Into
this tree?  I doubt that people find it there.  Many people are not
aware that there is documentation in texmf/doc.

For old documents the only solution is to provide the old files.  

Regarding new documents, I think that the onlyamsmath package is quite
interesting.

  Reinhard

replacing cm by lm happens (in the case of e.g. aer) in the map files so 
in practice there should be no problems; of course there can be problems 
with dvi files (i dunno if dvi viewers read soem config file, but if so, 
that one can be adapted too) but then, dvi is non portable anyway

this is what a deprecated tree can provide: if one has severe problems, 
due to specific local setups (for which one needs to archive anyway) one 
can be adviced to install the texmf-deprecated tree alongside

in this case it's the tfm files that determine the metrics 

in the future, different metrics may show up, but then we need to use different names (for the tfm's) as well; one of the objectives of the lm project was to get rid of the cm clones/derivates

Hi,

In the other cases than pdftex, it was necessary to set
fullnameoffile:

fullnameoffile = xstrdup (fname);

just before popen(..., "r") and reset it after the added code

if (fullnameoffile) {
   free (fullnameoffile);
   fullnameoffile = NULL;
}

because maketexstring(fullnameoffile) fails in texmfmp.c.

BTW, on windows' cmd.exe,
perl -e "print sqrt(4)"
is ok, but
perl -e 'print sqrt(4)'
is ng.
Therefore
\input "|perl -e 'print sqrt(4)'"
fails, while
\input "|perl --version"
works.

This may be a limitation of cmd.exe.
Are there any solutions?

Thanks a lot,
Akira

I will rewrite the code so that it is only available in pdftex
(by changing the pascal code instead of openclose.c). That way,
all this black magic with the other executables can be avoided.
I am sorry for the time you spend on it already.

I'm afraid not but the differences are so tiny that it is possible to use
lm*.pfb with cm*.pfb.

Hi Taco,

The problem with implementing this in openclose.c is that it gets  
compiled once for all the binaries, so there is no opportunity to  
conditionally-compile the feature for a subset of programs.

Could I suggest that rather than changing the pascal/web code of  
pdftex, you consider doing the implementation in a C function  
somewhere such as texmfmp.c, where it can be readily available for  
use in pdftex, omega, aleph, xetex (but can be excluded by  
conditional compilation for MF, for example).

It's the same in OS/2. I cannot use such one-line scripts in awk/perl/sed
if they contain a quoted string. I could use them if I start some
unix-like shell inside cmd.exe.

I am not sure howq a separate TEXMF tree would help here. However, a
collection-deprecated for old stuff that is only included for
compatibility reasons might be interesting. But who is going to sort
through the the TL TEXMF tree?

I haven't redone my analysis from
<URL:http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2006-June/010431.html> on this
for v1.00, but no one has questioned these statements even though they
knew that v1.00 existed at that time. So I don't expect a lot of changes
wrt to this an stand by my conclusions from there:

,----
| The problems shown above are less severe than those shown for the
| EC->LM replacement. But the potential gain is also smaller, since bsr,
| cs, pl, and vnr fonts together bring in less than 10M of PFB files. And

This could be fixed by allowing either one of these:

   "...\"...\"..." or '..."..."...'

as a valid 'quoted file'. WDYT?

Unfortunatelly not. If the command line argument contains spaces, cmd.exe
requires to put it inside "...". If a string is used in GNU awk for OS/2,
it also requires "...". Thus the argument would have to be something like
"... "string" ..." which, of course, does not work and I did not manage to
find any escaping mechanism. Bash allows '... "string" ...'.

I would like that, but in the current situation that solution still
needs support from the web2c change file.

Intercepting open_input() and  open_output() is easy, because the web
uses aopenin() and aclosein(), that are #defined in one of the header
files.

But the C function aclose() is called directly from the web
source,  so it cannot be aliased in a header file (and a hook is
required because pipes have to be closed with pclose()).

I assumed some massaging would take place in the executable. As I
understand it, there is absolutely no way to get a double quote in
a filename using the current syntax. If TeX would allow and convert
("...\"...\"...") to (..."..."...) the problem of using the correct
quotes for the current shell would be passed back to the user.

Since when's that? The first line of pdfcprot.sty is: 
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}

Maybe you are confusing pdfcprot with protcode.tex?

It's easy enough to change the change/header/c files however it works

You're probably in the best position to make the patch ... ?

Message-ID: <200606142204.k5EM4Xo26857@f7.net>

Hi Igor,

Thanks for the nice words about TeX Live.

    Just a though: may I suggest providing DPS-enabled binaries for
    xdvik in platforms that support it?

Thanks for the suggestion, but I fear this isn't really practical.
Volunteer time to compile binaries is in short supply already -- trying
to compile multiple variations of xdvi will only complicate an already
too-complicated process.  (xdvi is by far the most problematic program
to build now, due to variations in X libraries.)  Since you're the first
person who's ever written about this, I don't think there's an
overwhelming demand out there.

You might consider compiling xdvik yourself from the original source
(http://xdvi.sourceforge.net) with 
  configure --with-ps=dps

Whether the dps support is up-to-date is another question ...

Regards,
Karl

Can 
    My first list was taken without too much objections, so here is another
    proposal for collection-science which incorporates all this

Besides those already mentioned, ednotes is definitely not "science".
Where does the science list stand now?

    > 3) collection-pdfetex

In general, I suspect most of the packages in collection-etex are
already in other collections.  Anyway, I have no particular problem with
your suggestions.

  etex -- An extended version of TeX, from the NTS project.
  [...]
                seems to be really basic, where do we put it? into
                collection-basicbin, or collection-basic?

It is already in basicbin, which is where it should stay.

  pdfscreen -- Support screen-based document design.
        ??
I'd say latexextra.

  pdftexdef -- The pdftexdef package.
        only source files with test contents, what is this, kill it?
I already did kill it.

  bin-thumbpdf -- Thumbnails for pdfTeX and dvips/ps2pdf.
        2 "binaries", perl scripts, should be moved to basicbin, or?
It seems apparent that the whole installation of thumbpdf needs
reexamination.  In any case, it seems more like binextra to me than
basicbin.

Thanks,
Karl

Thanks for adding the cygwin support and in the arch menu.

Ok, good! I will create a new patch that does not interfere

Attached is a patch file with changes based on the TL source,
as checked out this morning. This trime, I have verified that
   * I can still 'make world'
   * that the executables do not segfault

There is one change needed in the core web2c: the C routine
aclose() is renamed to close_file(), and cpascal.h has an extra

   #define aclose(f) close_file(f)

The rest of the changes is in texmfmp.h (redefined #defines)
and texmfmp.c (three new functions). I'd be obliged if someone
would apply the patch and commit the code.

Cheers, Taco

No no and no. The tpms are distributed on the collections *without*
overlapping! The overlap is in the schemes only!

The collections do not contain double occurrences of tpm! AND PLEASE

    No, it is not in basicbin, there is etex-bin!! This is different.

Ah, now I see.  collection-basicbin includes bin-etex, not etex.  Sorry
for my confusion.

So, looking again, how about putting etex into collection-basic.  The
macros and doc in etex.tpm seem, well, basic.

Thanks,

Well, OTOH there's more to science than maths and physics. ;-) Perhaps
a collection of packages related to linguistics, phonetics, law and
the humanities would be of interest. There is already a number of
packages for this field listed from

  http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html#humanities

up to

  http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html#linguistics

Yes, sure.  But collection-science should remain for "hard" sciences, I
feel pretty sure.  That's just how it is commonly used in English.

    a collection of packages related to linguistics, phonetics, law and
    the humanities would be of interest. 

I don't object to having a collection-humanities.

However, I have to reiterate that I think this splitting consumes an
awful lot of time for an awful small gain.  In fact, I rather think it
will cause more problems (missing packages) than it will solve.  People
always want smaller downloads, but they also always want the packages
they use, because of course *those* are critically important :).  Anyway ...

    I was not sure when replacing xdvi in TeX Live with a
    customized version of this tool was a good idea.

The version of xdvi(k) in TL is simply whatever was the latest xdvi
release.  There shouldn't be any issues with compiling it from source
and using the new binary in the TL bin directory.

Hope it helps for you ...

To tell the truth, *I* could do without *any* math packages at all, I
have never ever used amslatex etc. I am well aware that I represent a
minority among LaTeX users, but I have had private mails from users
writing theses in Psychology, the Law, or Economics, I think they
would be quite happy if they could chose a collection for the social
sciences and the humanities while installing or even before
downloading. I think the number of ConTeXt users us smaller than
theirs, and there is a separate scheme for context in TL.

Hi,
when I install the complete TeXLive system on Windows XP, the
installer does not check whether there is another version of Perl
already installed on the system.

TL prepends the path/to/binaries to PATH and sets the environment
variable PERL5LIB accordingly.

The Perl version which had been installed before TeXLive has set the
value of PERL5LIB somewhere else rather than in the environment
variables dialog box, maybe in the registry.  Don't know how Windos
works.

When I run the command "set" in a DOS window, I see that TeXLive's
value of PERL5LIB is appended to the value provided by the Perl system
which had been installed previously.

When I invoke Perl, I get the Perl provided by TeXLive which then
complains that the file Config.pl doesn't match its version.

After I uninstalled TeXLive's Perl using the TL installer it seems
that everything works.  However, the environment still contains
useless stuff.

It would be better if the TeXLive installer could check whether a Perl
system is already installed.  This can be done by running 
"perl --version". 

It should be sufficient to add texmf*/scripts to PERL5LIB if
Perl is installed already.

If Perl provided by TeXLive is updated once a year it would not be a
problem to use it and remove the other one.  Unfortunately a Perl
module I need insists of having Perl installed at C:/Perl instead of
just running perl -e "print @INC" to find out where to put it.
Quite annoying...

  Reinhard

A few years ago, many Windows systems had MS Office and very little
else.  Now there are many applications that rely on java, perl,
ghostscript, tk/tcl, ... and there are robust packages to install
these with decent bug tracking and update schedules.  SInce these
are often installed by some application, the user may not even know
that they are using
them.

Ghostscript has similar issues, but in this case TL doesn't have
library files that aren't included in standard gs.  The main issue is
that the default gs installer doesn't edit the PATH, so TL's installer
would need to find gswin32c.exe and update the PATH accordingly.

Is it really necessary to include perl and ghostscript in TL for
Win32? What about ruby (used by the new ConteXt scripts)?  These are
both readily available and easy to install on Windows XP. These are
useful outside of TL and it is asking for trouble to include a
version that is likely to break other tools.

I'm not that concerned about compatibility issues for the different
versions of the 3rd party tools that are installed -- this is just as
big a problem on linux, etc. so TL tools need to work with both old
and future versions of perl, gs,  ruby, etc.


Maybe the DVD version should have a directory of the recommended 3rd
party tools (emacs, perl, ghostscript, ruby, GNU utilities).  With the
most widely used packaging and configurations using the default
locations, conflicts with 3rd party apps such as the one mentioned
above are less likely, users can get required updates from places
other than TL, and TL maintainers can focus on things more directly
involving TeX (many people would like a more robust dvi viewer).

Many users find they don*t need to make .dvi files when using preview latex.
The biggest source of confusion I see with Win32 users is that they think
"run LaTeX" should be an editor menu choice.  A precompiled emacs with
auctex is now available from:
ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/auctex/emacs+auctex-w32-2006-05-14.zip

If you wish to convert EPS images to PDF for use with pdftex via epstopdf,
you need perl. The script does nothing special so that any Perl5 will
work.

Do you know whether epstopdf.exe is included in MikTeX? I do not use
Windows myself and at least some MikTeX users do not know about
epstopdf.exe and use the perl script.

Subject: [tex-live] texk/web2c patches for xetex
Message-ID: <E57F9AF7-5FAA-4541-AEF2-61C3B76CD0B1@sil.org>

To support building xetex, a few of the "shared" source files in texk/ 
web2c need some changes; in particular, there are changes in:

	texk/web2c/lib/texmfmp.c
	texk/web2c/texmfmem.h
	texk/web2c/texmfmp.h
	texk/web2c/texmfmp-help.h

The xetex changes are controlled by an #ifdef XeTeX conditional, so  
they should have no ill effects on the other programs that use these  
sources. However, before checking-in any code, I wanted to offer  
people the chance to see the proposed patches; see the attached diffs  
(based on revision 1686 from Subversion). If there are any concerns  
that this may break other things, please let me know.

(Most of the xetex code is in a separate directory that will be added  
within texk/web2c, which should have no impact on any other programs.)

Hi Jonathan,

    people the chance to see the proposed patches; see the attached diffs  

No real issues, but I wonder if the xetex-only functions (u_open_in and
so on) would be better in a separate file, instead of glomming them into
texmfmp.c.

Also, not to be trivial, but would you mind formatting the code in the
shared files with two spaces instead of tabs?  Personally, I also find
"FILE *f" preferable to "FILE* f", but anyway ...

Olaf, any comments?

Thanks,
Karl

Sure, that's reasonable. I've just moved a bunch of stuff over to one  
of the xetex-only files, so the diffs on texmfmp.c will be cut down a  
bunch.

(Most of this goes back quite a while; it got written wherever it was  
convenient at the time, in terms of access to the right headers,  
etc., and hasn't been touched since. But it's no real problem to move  
some functions around, and it'll keep them out of the way.)

Fine; I'll tidy up a bit and come up with a fresh set of diffs in a  
while.

Any system relying on 3rd parties programs like Ghostscript, Perl or
whatever that are non standard (and for which sources are publicly
available) can't rely on existing versions of these tools (versions
installed on the client machine). The problem is that there is no way to
check that the features you expect from these tools are provided (or in
the best case, it is a nightmare to maintain). There are too many
version of Perl, of GS or even of the zlib library. Moreover many of
these tools do not publish themselves by following the MS guidelines so
you may have to check by yourself for conflicts. It happened that
Rational Rose (http://www.ibm.com/software/rational) came with and
mf.exe executable ... that was found on the PATH. Other products may use
gswin32c.exe or perl.exe or whatever.

[1] _The only reliable way is to provide the version you need and to hide it
from the rest of the system._

I may have done that in the past and I agree that it was wrong. However
in this case you are using an old version of TL.

There is nothing secret in the registry. It behaves much like the
environment, except that it is system and lan wide for any user/machine.
It is a distributed database.

At one point, the GS guy changed their mind in the way they were looking
for the gs library. In the old days, they looked for GS_LIB in the
environment, and if it were not found, they looked into the
registry. And when they switched to the 8.x series (AFAIR), they stopped
looking into the environment, which means they prevented people to
locally override settings.

And cross your fingers and pray for this stuff to work. At some point,
texlive supported the texdoctk program that needed perl + tk + the right
extensions ... Are you sure that because you find perl.exe on the client
machine, you will find also everything you need ? See my [1] point.

I don't know whether we can expect that everybody has a DVD drive.
Replacing a CD-ROM by a DVD drive might even be impossible for people
with older laptops.

If more 3rd party software is desired, I fear that it has to go on the
DVD.  There will be more macro packages and more fonts than last year
and probably there will not be even enough space for Perl in the near
future. 

Of course, Ghostscript is needed.  I'm not sure about Ruby.  Recently
Hans said that all the 3rd party apps are easy to install under
Windows.  But on the other hand I find it very annoying that you have
to download things from different places.  It doesn't hurt if it's on
the DVD.

As a Linux/Emacs user I can understand them.  It's no problem for me
to use bash, but Emacs is so convenient...

I recently installed it on several machines at work and I'm impressed
how good it works.  I also have it on my USB stick (Windows Survival
Kit).  Installation is pretty easy, all you need is to unzip the file
in an arbitrary directory and put an icon on the desktop.

However, it needs a home directory and the environment variable HOME
to be set properly.  Some Windows users had not been able to do this.

It would be nice if this can be done by the LeXLive installer.  The
TEXMFHOME tree can then go there as well.

If this is the only thing Windows lost, you are in luck.

OK, here is an updated version of the diffs for xetex support, after  
shifting some xetex-only stuff into separate files (and checking that  
it still builds!)

Any further comments are welcome.

In settings->system->advanced->environment I see the value of PERL5LIB.
When I say "set" at the DOS prompt, I see the value twice, once with
slashes and once with backslashes (or vice versa, I can look into it
on monday again).

I understand, though I still wonder how it can be accomplished to hide
TeXLive's Perl reliably from the rest of the system.

    I'd be obliged if someone
    would apply the patch and commit the code.

I did that (rev 1688), modulo a tiny bit of reformatting and using
strchr instead of index :).  I also made a note to include this in this
year's news.

Thanks much, as ever.

Which epstopdf.exe?  CTAN://tex-archive/support/epstopdf/epstopdf.c ?

I sent a bug report to the author a few years ago but did not get any
response.  The last three bugfixes applied to epstopdf are missing,
hence I cannot recommend it as a replacement for the Perl version. 

There is no license information.  He says that it is a translation of
Sebastian's program, so it seems that he wants to have it under
Sebastian's license, but my experience is that programs which do not
come with a clear license always cause bellyache.

If texmfmp.c is changed as follows, as I said before,
Taco's shell-escape extension works for all "TeX" programs.
Of course related
#if defined(pdfTeX) || defined(pdfeTeX)
should be replaced by
#if defined(TeX).
I think this change is not harmful.

Best regard,
Akira

Thanks. The above "all" of course does'nt include XeTeX
which has its own procs.

Sorry if I'm being slow this morning, but in looking at this code,  
I'm puzzled why there's a need to set (and then free)  
fullnameoffile .... I don't see what it's used for.

When makefullnamestring()

strnumber
makefullnamestring()
{
  return maketexstring(fullnameoffile);
}

is called, assertion fails in maketexstring if
fullnameoffile == NULL, whereas maketexstring in
pdftex allows NULL.

An easy way out is to set fullnameoffile,
though it is not the full-path but the command
name in this case ( to see the command name is not bad ).

Best,
Akira

But as I read it, your suggested change frees fullnameoffile again,  
before open_in_or_pipe returns. So by the time makefullnamestring()  
would be called, that memory is gone. If you get the right result,  
it's only by chance, because the memory hasn't been re-used yet, but  
the behavior is undefined, and sooner or later it'll fail for someone.

(To confirm this, you could reset fullnameoffile to NULL after the  
free() call, as the memory it pointed to is no longer allocated; then  
I expect the maketexstring assertion will fail again.)

In the non-pdftex case, rather than freeing fullnameoffile right  
after opening the pipe, you can free it right before allocating a new  
one:

        fname = (string)xmalloc(strlen(nameoffile+1));
        strcpy(fname,nameoffile+1);
+#if !defined(pdfTeX) && !defined(pdfeTeX)
+      if (fullnameoffile) free(fullnameoffile);
+      fullnameoffile = xstrdup(fname);
+#endif
        *f_ptr = popen(fname+1,"r");
        free(fname);

That way, the new value stays around long enough to be useful.

Or am I misunderstanding how this all fits together?

If you want reliability, use Cygwin or run linux in a virtual machine.
 Don't forget that Win XP is now reasonably mature, while new Win32
versions are coming into play.

It isn't realistic, particularly given the difficulties of doing
development under Win32, to expect TeX to run reliably on a Win32
system chosen at random.  Any tools you provide may break at any 2nd
Tuesday when MS patches another dozen security flaws.  You have to
define the interfaces you need.  If you say you only want Win32 system
calls, you might as well run Cygwin.  If you require some relatively
basic perl, gs, etc. then you can rely on people outside the TeX
community to make sure there are versions that work despite whatever
curves MS decide to throw.

As long as there are people providing the 3rd party tools with decent
Win32 installers it is quire reasonable to take the approach: TL will
work with current versions of the 3rd party tools.  If you currently
have older versions you may need to update them.

A few people will run into conflicts where a particular app insists on
a older version of some utility.   There are options (virtual
machines, cygwin) for such situations so it isn't necessary for TL to
support such situations.

If you call gs in a script you can use command-line switches, so the
big problem is finding the "right" gswin32c.exe, perl.exe, etc. (some
systems have many copies).

I use texdoctk on Win32 with Active State Perl -- the big problem is
that the database
isn't complete.  I assume the tk bits are included in ASP.  I do have
colleages who swore off Perl on Win32 a couple years ago because they
couldn't get it to work for ConTeXt.  I get also reports from people
who can't get ghostscript batch files to work (e.g. the epstopdf
support in WinEDT).   Win32 is fragile and TL can't repair badly
damaged Win32 configurations.

I have now done so. acute, grave and circumflex are closer to CM in
v1.00 than in v0.99.3. There are no changes with respect to macron and

I ahve redone these tests with v1.00. There are no changes with respect
to \"{i}, \k{i}, and \k{o}. The section mark in v1.00 is slightly
narrower (and lighter!) than in v0.99.3. It is still wider than in

Since you use TL05, I assume you talk about 'tlpmgui' installer.
The fresh installer version I test a couple of days ago 
(ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui) seems to be more pleasant 
regarding 3rd parties.

Personally I hate programs that overwrites anything without saying
'watch out' or at least 'sorry' (: And I also don't use Perl from TL, so 
will insist on pretty fair overwriting policy.

btw, questions suggestions and comments can be sent to

If you want reliability, avoid Cygwin.

No piece of software is less reliable (and less understandable) than Cygwin for a
Windows user. Especially, cygwin programs are picky about the exact
cygwin dll version that is installed. Also the pathnames converted to
the unix syntax (together with mount points) is something relaly heretic
in a windows environment.

I am ok with this one. BTW it is a good idea to run any os in a virtual
machine. It isvery easy and convenient to backup a vmware virtual machine and
restore it.

TeX by itself is a C program and once compiled runs at least as well
under any current flaovurs of Windows as under any other OS.

    > Any tools you provide may break at any

Absolutely not. Any TeXlive tools are totally independant of the
system. The only link is the msvcrt.dll C runtime dll and this one is
never impacted by these updates. It changes only every couple of
year. And you still may use the old versions, because Windows will pick
the version provided in your TeX binary directory if there is one, even
if other programs are using a more recent one.

I'll stop there. This is a never ending discussion.

Hi Zdenek,

    New version of Velthuis Devanagari

I've updated the TeX Live repository, including the win32 binary and,
for testing, the linux binary.  (I also updated the devnag.c source file
so that when the platforms are rebuilt, we should get new ones.)

It sure was easy to just copy in the directory.  Thanks for setting it
up that way.

Please check the results if you can ...

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Taco (and all),

Does the mpto stuff actually use the first-line %& feature these days?
I seem to recall that you were changing things around in that area.

Thomas E. suggested that we do
tex.parse_first_line = f
in texmf.cnf -- then "tex" would still be Knuth TeX, "This is TeX ...".
The &% feature is, I guess, the only feature that makes it not so.

I couldn't think of anything else likely to be relying on "tex"
understanding %&.  Can anyone?

We could always do something like dektex.parse_first_line=f as a
fallback, but clearly it would be nicer if "tex" was "TeX".

Thanks,
Karl

apparently Artifex has changed the license of GhostScript from AFPL to

It is mentioned in the manual, but 'makempx/mpto' do not actually
create '%&' lines, that is strictly under user control.

In the metapost manual, '&%' lines are explained as a web2c/miktex
extension, so simply adding a line to say that it may only work for
'non-knuthian' TeX is quick and easy.

As far as I can see, the banner is only controlled by src_specials_p,
file_line_error_style_p and parse_first_line_p (all three can be set
from texnf.cnf).

To get a "true" Knuthian TeX, you have have to disable some of the
command line initex options (-enctex, -mltex, -8bit) as well, since
they store information in the format file.

The win32 animal is so complex (different corporate standard configrations,
different user backgrounds, different hardware, etc.) that we are like
the 3 blind men and the elephant.

Here we are discussing a "TeX system" including the tetex shell
scripts, context perl and ruby scripts, etc.

I guess this is the key issue for 3rd party tools (such as perl).
Most of these tools come from linux/unix and have support for graphics
(perl-Tk) and networking that must be difficult or impossible to
implement in Win32 using only msvcrt.   We have getnonfreefonts and
texsync that use file transfer tools.

> I'll stop there. This is a never ending discussion.

I suppose the take-home lesson is that the Win32 animal is so diverse
that no single solution will meet every need.  In the end, if there is
a large group with similar requirements, they will find ways to port a
TeX system, so the main thing is to minimize collateral damage when
making changes to core programs.

Did you install gs with TeX Live?  If not you may need to add the gs
"bin" directory to your PATH variable.

I gather that windvi is not being maintained, but since there are
alternatives, I haven't investigated or even paid attention to fixes.
The alternatives include:

1.  pdf workflow, as you mention or using pdf(la)tex to get to pdf's in 1 step.
2.  auctex with preview (a new version was just released and for XP
you can get an emacs binary that is easy to install and "works for
me").  Many people who use a dvi viewer only because it is fast when
working on a complicated layout find previews more efficient, but not
everyone is compatible with emacs.
3.  dviout, which seems to be maintained, but may share some problems
when generating pk fonts.  There is adequate documentation in english.
4.  ps workflow, using gsview to display the output.

there are (currently) three win versions 98,2000,xp in use and normally 
if one has the latest (shipped with tl) lib dll's things should run ok; 
in this respect windows is not different from linux (we now have some 10 
versions of each distribution) and macosx (not to forget os9) with 
pp/intel variants as well; i think that we must accept that operating 
systems are not stable (exept maybe systems like vms and solaris) longer 
than a (few) years(s) and i already have nightmares about installing 
windows 2021 and suse 31.2 and OSX.81 (and good dreams about texlive 2073)

i think that (at least in the past) the problem was with the library 
paths; also, installing a new perl (or gs) without uninstalling the old 
thing is also a cause for problems (on linux there is a similar problems 
with gs, where one can end up with mismatches between fonts and ps lib 
files on the one hand and binaries on the other depending on where 
things are expected and what env vars are set [i sometimes solve that by 
using the latest windows stuff in combination with the generated latest

anyhow, i think that nowadays os's have become monster apps and the fact

    It is mentioned in the manual, but 'makempx/mpto' do not actually
    create '%&' lines, that is strictly under user control.

Ah, right.  I should have reread my own writing :).

    As far as I can see, the banner is only controlled by src_specials_p,
    file_line_error_style_p and parse_first_line_p (all three can be set
    from texnf.cnf).

Yeah.  The other two are off by default, but I guess adding an explicit
setting would be good.

    To get a "true" Knuthian TeX, you have have to disable some of the
    command line initex options (-enctex, -mltex, -8bit) as well, since
    they store information in the format file.

I'm not too worried about options.  Since users must explicitly specify
them, it should be pretty clear to them that they are deviating from
Knuth.  If not, not our problem, anyway.

Thanks.

Cygwin is a self contained environment.  You can run programs which
are not in this environment, but it doesn't make much fun.  I assume
that copying programs and the DDLs they need to a Windows environment
doesn't make much fun too.  There are differences in path delimiters
and line breaks as well.  Cygwin is a nice thing unless you leave this
environment.  It is not made for people who prefer the Windows GUI.

But for TeXLive cygwin is not an option.  That would mean that TL has
to provide the complete cygwin distribution, which is impossible.
And it doesn't solve the original problem.

As far as Perl is concerned, I think it's best when the installer

* installs Perl provided by TeXLive unless there is a Perl already
  installed,

* gathers some information about the existing Perl (i.e., is Tk.pm
  installed?) and asks the user how to proceed.

That would be helpful, I dont't think that much more can be done.

Maybe.  But there are subtle differences, though.

Since we know what we need for TL, it shouldn't be too difficult to
check with "perl -e".  Everything can be checked this way.

I don't see any problems here.  On my old machine I have 35 versions
of ghostscript installed, on the new machine there are 24 versions
(don't want to install ancient libraries any more) and there are no
problems.  I can select a particular version by setting an environment
variable, for instance:

   GS=7.05 gv somefile.ps

or
   GS=6.52 gs -help

   [...]
   Search path:
     . : /opt/ghostscript/fonts : /opt/ghostscript/local :
     /opt/ghostscript/6.52/lib
   [...]

My wrapper script even allows me to say:

   for version in `gs --versions`; do
       GS=$version epstopdf infile.eps outfile.ps 
   done

It is pretty simple to do such things under Linux.

I also have several TeX distributions, of course.  This is also very
easy under Linux.  The shell script TL2005 starts a new shell with a
different environment (and a different prompt).

I also have different versions of acroread, xpdf... 

I don't know much about Windows, but under Linux you can do almost
everything.

Yes, but I'm amazed that everything works so well under Linux.

sure, and equally simple to do it under windows, however ... for who do 
we make tex live? windows (and i assume also mac) users want to run 
tthing swithout the need to revert to shell programming; fabrice made 
xemtex (fptex ++) for schools (teachers and such) and they (normally) 
want something that installs as easy as any program under windows: click 
a setup program, want some minutes, and get working; if you'd tell them 
-in case of conflixts- to open a shell (cmd) and key in some magic code, 
tex no longer is a valid option

who is our intended audience ...

My impression is that you are not really interested in solving the 
problem of installing tl/perl under windows, but to agitate, how simple 
linux world is :) Well, I don't say it is not elegant and powerfull, but 
if one is familiar with programming, *everything* becomes easy under 
windows too, unless one compares cmd with sh. IE why don't you learn 
JScript -- windows built-in, huge programming language? Because it is 
not a part of your intrests, and its ok, in exactly the same way, why 
normal people don't want to learn talking with black'n'white machine via 
shell.

For instance, Octave also requires some part of cygwin and gnuplot. One
package is just EXE which installs the necesary parts without asking the
user. It is installed in such a way that the user does not even know about
it and these parts can hardly be used outside Octave. However, the
installation does not destroy cygwin and gnuplot if they are already
installed ane they continue to work. Maybe it could be done in some
similar way with Perl and TL.

It is always advantageous to WORM (= write once write multiple). If the
same task is implemented in bash for Linux, Rexx for OS/2, JScript for
Windows etc., you will still be rewriting programs from one language to
another. I like thechnologies like TeX and XML because they are platform
independent. I can develop something in OS/2 and others can use it in
Linux, windows and elsewhere. The port of teTeX in OS/2 depends strongly
on Perl, pdksh and various GNU utilities. Everything is called seamlessly
and I can invoke tex, dvips, etc from the toolbar of my editor. It's
because all these tools are ported to OS/2 and the OS/2 command window
does not differ from the command window of unix-like shells. And all these
programs can also be started by clicking to som icon, if somebody does not
like the command line...

I just had the pleasure of trying to transfer files from one computer
under Windows XP to the next for my father.  Attempting to copy his
personal files to the memory stick with a recursive copy failed early
in the process because of some user-specific file being opened by the
system (which is certainly no impediment at all under Linux).  The
copy operation did not even ask whether to skip this file.  It just
aborted the whole process.  How very user-friendly and easy.  Trying
to look at the file properties of files cut short the "path to file"
at the end (the most important part of the path) because the window to
display the properties in is too short.  Resizing the window is not
possible.

Somebody I told this to said "yeah, well, you switch the explorer
display to `list' to do this".

And don't get me started on the scroll bars which jump back to home
when you try dragging them and skid off horizontally (or have they
fixed that yet after decades?).

I mean, get real.  This sort of stuff is supposed to be the outcome of
usability labs?  KDE or GNOME would get drowned in ridicule for such
antics.

No, a lot of things are quite inconvenient under Windows by design.
And I don't understand why they keep them time and again, or even make
them worse.

this is a pointless discussion; i never had the problems that you 
mentioned; on the other hand, i always have problems with kde/gnome when 
i occasionally have to use linux; (my prefered editor, scite, works 
flawwless on windows, but craches frequently on linux so maybe after all 
the windows gui lib is not that bad -)

hm, if windows's design is so bad, then why do so many linux gui things try to mimick it ... (or the macs); (btw, you don't want to know how often i can get x windows to crash, the whole point in such things is that one, once one is accustomed to a system, intuitively gets to know what to avoid / not use), but, as said, it's a pointless discussion and a matter of taste, we could as well be talking about music .. are the musical capabilities of your prefered performers better than mine?

If you move off a scroll bar horizontally accidentally while dragging,
it does not jump back?  You can just copy the home directory tree of a
user that is currently active without XP balking out and aborting
because the user's registry is open?  If you "View properties" of a
file or link, the dialog can be made to display the whole path of the
file without getting cut off?

Congratulations.

Those things I described don't get mimicked at all, sorry.  I can copy
trees even while files are being accessed, I can resize any "view
properties" dialog if I wish to if it happened to cut off information,
and dragging a toolbar does not require me to stay at the exact
horizontal location of the toolbar while doing so.  On neither Gnome,
KDE, any toolkit I'd want to use, or Mac.

I was not talking about matters of taste.  The deficiencies I
described have no redeeming purpose whatsoever.  They are inconvenient
and nothing else.

There are more than 50 operating systems easily.  I know no GUI and OS
except that of Windows (and maybe MSDOS) with those problems I
described and which hit me just because I had to work for a few hours
with it.

If you prefer to consider the package as a whole worth having, that's
your privilege and a matter of taste.  But declaring clear
deficiencies as a matter of taste or non-existent does not make sense.

And no, nobody mimicks _those_, and for good reason.

They've always released both AFPL and GPL versions in the past.  I think
this is simply following suit (ie, the GPL version is released later than
that the AFPL edition).

It is differnt this time. There used to be something like a one year
delay between the AFPL and the corresponding GPL version. This time

AFPL 8.54 26 May 2006
 GPL 8.54  2 Jun 2006

See <URL:http://www.ghostscript.com/article/71.html>

Besides this, there isn't much on ghostscript.com. However, accoring to
Raph Levien's diary?, they really want to make the GPL version 'leading
edge' and try to get ESP GS merged. It this works out in the end, this
sure will be a good thing.

I just don't understand why Windows has to be considered sacred: with
every other system, deficiencies may be pointed out and eventually
fixed.  With Windows, you hit upon denial and irrational defense and
unrelated pseudo-rationalizations immediately.  I don't get it.

Such a strive does not seem to be very effective.  The deficiencies I
mentioned have been present in Windows 1.0 already.  Instead of fixing
the old problems, new stuff gets tacked onto the top.

But I was not talking about matters of taste.

Not in my book.  In my book it is about getting a large, reliable and
readily assembled TeX distribution into the hands of those that can
make use of it.  Of course, the readily assembled character increases
the possible target audience.  But the quality is not merely a
secondary means for proselytizing new users: it is worthwhile in
itself, and for existing users.  That TeXLive expands the prospective
TeX user base is a side effect.

Well, I was rather put off about the incessant whining that Windows
must be all good.  I find it ridiculous.

It is not a problem for our community.  If working alternatives are
more convenient than TeX, it is time to move on and/or improve TeX.
People that prefer other means are not a problem.  TeX's qualities
don't depend on everything else being too painful to consider.

In fact, I prefer it if people have WYSIWYG hacks and tools they can
work with, if that suits their style of work better.  In that manner,
the TeX community has its focus on the things desirable for TeX on its
own instead of those that don't work elsewhere.

That does not mean that we need to glorify their choice of operating

C:\.. might be the whole disk.  Unix may have no /.. but you can
perfectly well delete all files too, given that you are root (which
you are more or less by default on Windows).  In fact, Unix will not
even stop at files that are currently open.

The ability to cause awful damage with small commands is not unique to
any operating system, even though Windows is somewhat more susceptible
to it because of its traditionally lax file permissions (while the
mechanisms for protection are available, they can't be really employed
consistently without causing applications to fail).

I do not mean C:\.., it was C:\some\path\.. ! No matter how deep .. is, it
means the whole disk when deleting.

Sarcasm is not what should be used here to make a point. Each and every 
operating system and user interface (especially visual) has it's 
deficiencies, at least for those who are not at home with them. 
Otherwise what point would there be in the constant strive to improve 
them? I feel at home in my home which doesn't mean that it is perfectly 
organized and have problems when being somewhere else -- it takes me 
time to get used and find my ways around what I perceive as deficiencies 
and such.

Matters of taste do matter. What is TL about?  I think that it is about 
getting TeX being used by as wide as possible audience. Nobody can claim 
that there are no Windows  users, so instead of whining that Windows is 
bad and fighting flame wars about Christmas being a better holiday than,

Hi Pawel,
I just replied to Hans who talked about problems he had with gs under
Linux.  It has nothing to do with Perl in TeXLive or Linux/Windows.

I am not talking about Linux users who have no programming skills.
These people will certainly rely on the package management system of
their distribution which hopfully prevents conflicts between different
versions of a program.

And your assumption that I'm not interested in solving the Perl
problem is wrong, of course.

Regards,
  Reinhard

                  Help Wanted for gwTeX Survival!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

With the end of teTeX as a separate distribution, Gerben Wierda needs 
another source for the main texmf tree of his TeX redistribution for
Mac OS X and could use help from someone with good make/sh skills to
create a script-like solution to generate a teTeX texmf-clone from
TeX Live's Master tree as he does not have the time to do the initial
work required to change from teTeX to TL as a source. This is not
exceedingly difficult, but it is a decent bit of work.

You need to have decent make/sh (an alternative tool that may be
employed  is perl, but no other (to keep the amount of tools needed 
acceptable)) skills and have a Mac running Max OS X 10.3 or up.
The work includes:

        --- setting up your own TL Master copy with perforce (and
thus installing perforce and learning to use it). The move to svn
from perforce will be done later as the current build environment
is tied to perforce versioning and it is not wise to do two types
of changes simultaneously;

         --- setting up your own copy of Gerben's build environment
(some directories, Makefiles and such) and learning how it works;

         --- analyzing teTeX's texmf tree and rebuilding its content
(not necessarily its layout) from scratch from the TL Master tree;

        --- discussing with Gerben along the way on how all of this
can be solved best. Alternative solutions are of course possible
(a creative mind is welcome), but the above way is deemed to be the
lowest impact (e.g. minimal changes for the users and thus minimal
support requests to Gerben after the change has taken place);

         --- testing and supporting users (via the Mac OS X TeX
mailing list) during the transition.

------------------------------------
Estimated time for a skilled person:
------------------------------------
a few days to learn everything, a week to build the basic Makefile
entries, test etc. All of this spread over a month or so.

Please respond by email to: Gerben.Wierda at rna.nl

Hans, I'm not talking about TeXLive users but about that:

BTW., I still do not know what you want to achieve by using Windows
libraries under Linux.  I'm sure they are exactly the same.  Search
paths are compiled into binaries, hence there is no need to set
environment vars.  Fonts and PS lib files are usually in
ghostscript/<version> and the binaries will always find the files in
the appropriate directories.

TL can't meet the needs of all users.  What it can do is

1) strive to overcome barriers that make it harder for people like
Fabrice to create good distros for specific requirements (in
particular, most derviative distros end up being platform-specific),
and

2) strive to play well with existing user applications, including utilities like
gs, perl, etc.

Analyzing the problems that arise in Win32 is important, not just
because many TeX users want to use Win32, but because the things we
learn are likely to help with problems we will encounter when new
platforms appear.  The ability to use a platform tool after checking
for the required functionality is helpful because it provides
information that can be used to fix broken external tools and because
the tests will be useful in other situations (e.g., porting to a
totally new OS ten years from now).

This discussion is useful if it leads to some general agreement over
the approach to 3rd party tools:

0) if 3rd party tools aren't readily available through packages, they
can be considered for inclusion (e.g., sam2p)

1) don't break a user's existing tools unless the user agrees

2) try to use existing tools by checking against defined requirements
(and avoid tools where it is difficult to analyze the configuration).

3) strive for portability in core components

This thread deals mainly with points 1+2, but the others are important
because we need a replacement for teTeX, which violates (3) due to the
reliance on shell scripts.

Only if they are compiled under cygwin.  There are also versions of
octave and gnuplot which do not depend on cygwin.

The disadvantage of using cygwin is that you have to say
/cygdrive/c/texlive instead of c:\texlive.  This would be inconsistent
with the rest of TeXLive.  

I must admit that I never tried to run a cygwin program outside the
cygwin environment.

I do not see any advantage to have Perl in a cygwin environment.
texdoctk, for instance, expects a program called "perl".  It doesn't
matter whether this "perl" uses the cygwin dll or is compiled under
MinGW or whatever.  You'll always run into trouble if there is already
something else called "perl".

What George meant is that you can avoid name clashes if you run
TeXLive in a virtual machine.

Instead of a virtual machine you can add TeXLive to cygwin, the other
tools (perl, gs, xpdf...) are already there.  Cygwin has its own
search path for binaries and so on.  It doesn't interact with the rest
of the system.

You can then rename cygwin.exe to texlive.exe.

However, there are many reasons not to do so:

* Cygwin is good for UNIX people who are forced to use Windows.  I
  doubt that Windows users like it.

* People want to use programs outside the cygwin environment as well,
  which is a bit inconvenient.

I don't think that it's useless to add TeXLive to cygwin, maybe
someone will do it in the future, but I think that it's not
appropriate for the TL distribution.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That's what I meant by circumstances.  "Nobody forces nobody" meant 
"bodies" in our community.
But there are many windows shops around and if we want to have presence 
there we should to
a large extent play the game in conforming to the habits of users or 
rather the rules of the platform.
Complaints don't move things forward as MS is not very responsive to say 
the least.  Complaints
spiced with ad personam remarks only create bad feelings.  We should be 
open and responsive to
the problems by trying to solve them taher than complaining.  I fully 
agree with the recent posting
from George:

if i remember right it had to do with bin vs usr/bin and related relative paths; it was around v 8.30 or so; the problem was that the libs etc didn't end up in the right place (copying didn't work), so i just took the lot from a windows installation (same version) and it somehow did work; the problem with compiling under linux is that one has to (somewhat) fight this usr local or whatever is expected and default on your installed system; i often end up with moving things from usr/bin to bin or reverse (i know that there are all those path switches for make scripts but i've been bitten by that too often, ending up with messed up other progs due to lib replacement); 

anyhow, when i want an up to date system (and no messing around with dependencies and libraries) i just reinstall linux, this normally takes about a coffee break and then i have an updated system; actually that's also what i'd advice tex users with regards to tex installations: just wipe out the old stuff, install the whole new lot, if possible by copying the whole tex live cd/dvd; saves you much trouble, conflicts  and time -) and .. nowadays tex installations are small compared to the rest

indeed! i remember the times that 4tex (before tex live) happily 
replaces ones ghostscript with an older version; i think one of the 
problems (may be gone now) was that tex distros could only ship ancient 
gs's; i'm not sure how many other goodies suffer from this; one of the 
problematic progs is imagemagick because it's name 'convert' conflicts 
with installed other progs; actually, i sometimes wonder to what extend 
installed binaries have conflicting names (iin the past i saw readline, 
access and similar names come by which sounds pretty generic to me but 
nevertheless were tex related)

And it helps using them if scrollbars require two-dimensional aiming,
if copying directory trees aborts because files are open for read
(almost unavoidable if you want to save a user's personal directory
tree), and if dialogs cut off important information and can't be
resized?

Sorry, I don't buy that.  Those are pure usability issues and have
nothing to do with "system administration of other non productive
task".

I was talking about stuff that is harmful in every imaginable respect.
There is no benefit whatsoever preserved by those things I described.
If you think differently, then please state any benefit you see with
any of the described things.

Rather than fixing the scrollbar dragging which has been similarly
painful since Windows 1.0, Microsoft chose to promote mouse wheels.
Nothing wrong with wheels, but fixing the scroll bars to not require
the mouse to stay on-bar while dragging would have been an independent
benefit.

And that the explorer _aborts_ copying completely because of a single
file (never mind that the reason it won't copy it is completely
lunatic in itself) is not sane user interface design.  Windows asks
"are you sure?"  "are you really sure" "I bet you don't know what you
are asking for" questions all of the time, so why doesn't it ask here
whether one wants to skip this file in order to complete an otherwise
perfectly useful operation?

Basically, there are usability and internal issues that hit me in the
face the moment I use Windows.  Stuff that should not escape usability
labs, and certainly not so for the decades Windows has been in use
already.  Stuff that will hit _anybody_ in the face if he tries to use
Windows.

And that's why I just don't get the "we should try to make things as
Windows-like as possible, because Windows is just great" sort of talk.

It is enough that we have to cater for Windows.  We don't need to
sweet-talk it.

forces sounds bit hopeless -) i can understand why organizations want some uniformity; it's not new and dates back to mainframe times; however, nowadays one can use vm's which is what i happily do

on the other hand, given that one favourite editor is available, nowadays there for most users it does not make much difference (firefox, open office, thunderbird, acrobat, ... it all runs on lin/win/mac) so ...; ok, gs has different gui's but that's less important

with regards to tex and tex related workflows, most tools that make sense (for me) run on all platforms, so one can choose the platform that one feels most comfortable with i.e gives one the best user experience;  

i think that the most noticable platform related tex thing currently is xetex, because it hooks into system fonts, and that's a rather os dependent issue (what fonts one gets, what support is provided, what quality is rendered, etc)

Maybe because they have such a large base of users who aren't interested
in programming computers, or update them or doing system administration
or other non productive task, but only to use them. 

The windows users base is so large that MS can't change the behavour of
its interface without causing more harm than benefit.

Last time I played with one of these fancy wm for X that were
flourishing, I spent hours on configuration, to get a behaviour that was
... well just mine. That is I can't get the same behaviour on another
machine without installing the same wm and a copying a couple of files. 

I was also scared when I realized that many applications just didn't
care about the behaviour I defined, so on the same desktop you had apps
behaving completely differently wrt to ui. Rather disturbing.

Nothing is perfect is this world.

Teraterm ssh does not need cygwin. Moreover, it can just be copied to a
computer, no installation is needed. The file of a zip file is about 1.2
MB, so that it can be transferred on a single diskette. It can also be run
directly from a memory stick. I found it a few years ago on the
installation CD of Redhat Linux 6.0 and I still use it if I must use ssh
from someone else's Windows computer. WinSCP doen not need cygwin either
afaik but it must be installed.

Yes, this is important. OS/2 has its own hostname with slightly different
format of output than GNU hostname. If it is parsed by another tool, it is
important to use the correct version. There are also different versions
GNU utilities. I need one version for running TeX but this version does
not work with cvs, so that I run TeX from scripts which temporarily
prepend the correct directory to PATH and set the DLL directory to
BEGINLIBPATH.

It is similar in OS/2. Some tools ported from Linux expect its file e.g.
in /usr/lib on the current drive. It means that if I have two disk, I must
have it both in C:\usr\lib and D:\usr\lib. If i connect a network drive as
Z:, I would have to put the files to Z:\usr\lib too. The current port of
teTeX for OS/2 requires one environment variable, namely UNIXROOT. The
files are then looked for in %UNIXROOT%/usr/lib (system libraries accept
both forward slashes and backslashes). It might be a good idea also for
programs ported to Windows.

I have a copy in http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/ssh-win32/ with two changes:
1. known_hosts is filled with host to which I most frequently connect (but
it is not up-to-date)
2. Number of rows is limited inthe configuration to 25 because otherwise
it did not work when connecting to OS/2

It can also be fetched from https://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/ssh-win32/ and I
can look at the server certificate in order to verify that I get the
correct version.

Is there a reason why the pipe symbol is always at the beginning? I 
think the syntax

   \input "command |"

would be much clearer (for \input files).

Following the syntax of open in Perl, it should be \input "command |". In
gnuplot notation it would be \input "< command". Octave (similarly as C)
distinguishes between fopen and popen, so maybe it should be
\pinput "command" or something like that.

Just a matter of taste: I like it a bit better at the beginning.

This extension does not need a web change file so far, and if that can
be avoided I believe we should. But whether or not any kind of special
symbol is before or after the command is up for grabs. If there is a
consensus on a syntax change, I will not object. But not do the coding, 
either ;)

one can define \pinput as a macro

also, often \input is not directly uses, so special commands can handle it

I think that the problem is that ghostscript does not support relative
paths for security reasons.  I tried to write a Fontmap file with
entries like "../../texmf/fonts/type1..." but gs refused.

It is problematic, of course, to move directories if paths are
compiled into binaries.  If you fear that wrong configure options
break your system, there are a few solutions:

* "make -n install" doesn't install anything,

* "configure --<options> --prefix=/tmp
  allows you test it before you do the final installation.  You don't
  have to be root to do that.

I don't think that environment variables solve any problems.  You set
them today but you don't remember them when you update the system a
few weeks later.

I doubt that using the Windows lib files solved your problem.  It is
more likely that you played with env vars which made it work.

It is a good idea (in fact, it is Thomas Esser's idea) to 
"cp ~/.bash_history <some other file>"  which allows you to examine
later what you have done to make it work.

  Reinhard

There are many programs which do not allow me to use my favourite
editor.  I have to use the crap they call an "editor".

When talking about editors, I really have to acknowledge that Windows
XP now provides an editor which is able to process files larger than
64kB.  It's indeed a big step.  I had been waiting for this feature
for 20 years.  Many thanks to Microsoft!  It's really a big step for
mankind!

  Reinhard

Sorry, but I didn't met a Windows user yet who is really happy with
Windows.  Windows users are a special species:  They are completely
unhappy with Windows but they are not much motivated to try anything
else.

on my desk is a boot "windows xp annoyances for geeks" and i've once read parts of "word annyoances": funny and honnest books; i wish there were a "linux annyoances" and "tex annoyances" because that i (and users) should not feel lonely in their fight against the odds -) 


==== intermezzo

(1) maybe one complains less if something's free (or more when one has paid for it) 
(2) i paid for nearly all my linux cd's so when things don't work i complain about linux (but not on lists) 
(3) when installing my mums computer i wanted to give linux a try (only brower and mail needed anyway) but after two days of struggling with the wireless i decided to buy a copy of windows (so that we don't end up with an unhappy linxu user); and let me mention: i had help from a guy who spends the whole day professionally working with all kind of linuxes
(4) when discussing such things on needs to keep in mind that many windows (and mac) users started using it when linux desktops were way behind (and even now some apps that runs smoothly on win/mac don't run that way on linux)
(5) using linux has definitely advantages when you use certain tools that are not available on other platforms (but how many texies need them)
(6) when solving a problem with an os, i prefer to google into 'it sucks and does not work' than into 15 suggested solutions that don't work but cost me time 
(7) linux users have the freedoms to adapt their software (although i can suppress that urge -) but windows users have the freedom to complain 

etc etc etc ... discussions like this depends on the what experience and arguments one brings along and there is no right and wrong; we have a freedom to choose and be (un)happy with the os we choose, the car we drive, the books we read, etc 

this thread is a bit like one about using tex versus msword (or its clone open office); why should we feel an urge to convince happy word users to switch to tex and become unhappy tex users? 

====== tex

so, how about tex (and the future) then 

i got the feeling that which each year of tex live the 'let's make something great for all platforms and treat them equal' were coming more close to 'tex live is for linxu geeks only' (the split in win/lin code base is the most prominent sign of this)

i wonder if it wouldn't be better to think about: 

- texlive as a tds complient resource thing only
- keep the binaries (and platform things) out of the game 

that way we can have 

- tex live + linuxtex (vendor dependent variants) 
- tex live + miktex
- tex live + ptex (pretty good cjk distribution)
- tex live + cross-platform-tex 

etc. it saves a lot of discussion, we no longer need to maintain the same binary set for each platform, it would open roads for (indepedent) binary installers, etc

it's not so different from what happened last year 

(to be honnest, i think that the tex community is not (or no longer) capable of thinking cross platform)

my sister seems entirely happy with it.  it's corporate policy that
windows should be used, but she's self-employed...  ;-)

there is a linux annoyances book.  blurb in the latest o'reilly
catalogue i have around here.  can't see there ever being a tex one ;-)

as a win and linux admin, i was thinking of buying the new book.

there are lists for this sort of complaint, but as has already been
said, this is not that sort of list.

please, folks...

[hans, the rest of your mail poses valid topics for discussion, but
since i'm a new boy on this list i don't want to fire off discussion
on things i've only a shadowy grasp of...]

I'd like to find any reference to such a limitation. The only reference I have
found about notepad is that it seems to hold the file in memory, so you
may need a large amount to open large files.
KB PSS ID Number: 311800 from 7/8/2002

And anyway, Windows has not been designed for developpers. If you want
a decent editor, there are many available.

Not the TeX community, but this TeX(Live) community. 

Anyway,  the Windows slot  is perfectly filled   by MiKTeX and there are
certainly much more MiKTeX users (undeclared  to TUG or other LUGs) than
teTeX/TeXLive/whatever web2c based users. (It would be interesting to try
to call for a poll BTW).

Normal Windows users around me prefer to use MikTeX because it can easily
be installed directly from Internet. Some windows users from CSTUG prefer
TeXLive because we send then CD/DVD every year.

It's okay for me. Just wanted to be sure that the syntax is settled when 
I start implementing this feature (in MiKTeX).

Dear friends!

I wanted to inform you that I am leaving for more or less 5 weeks
without any regular internet connection, and not the time to care for
many things but the most important.

So don't expect any answers, development, comments, bug fixes from me in
the next time.

For those who are interested, I am off 1 week acclimatising with some
friends, then 2 weeks of federal mountain guide course, and then 2 weeks
with clients in the swiss alps. In all this time I have about 3 days of
free time, ... seems like a lot of work is expecting me.

In August I hope to manage to work up all the stuff which has
accumulated.

So, if there is anything with high emergency, there is time till friday
morning ...

Best wishes

Norbert

This issue is already available as PDF from the above mentioned web page.
you will not understand the text but you can understand the table. You
will see that some people use TeX on several platforms. You can count them

Not quite sure whether we are a special species. Sooner or later
you'll find that some application you really need is not available for
other platforms, so you stick to Windows. Back when I had Linux in a
dual boot installation I had to reboot to Windows so often it just
didn't make much sense any more to run Linux for teXing only. I also
cannot say that I am completely unhappy with my platform of choice. In
the first place it is very easy to get support in any form for Windows
systems. The main problem is not Windows, but the omnipresent MS
Office on Windows systems. But this is really OT, except for that it
shows how important a Windows version of TL really is.

Regards,
J?rgen.

Most MS Office documents may be processed by OpenOffice.org and now even
VMware Server is free so that you can have Windows inside Linux. See
www.vmware.com -- I use this solution in my computer because sometimes I
really need Windows.

Many linux users need tetex only to format documentation when building packages.

In my experience, among LaTeX users, MiKTeX is preferred by
users/groups that have no exposure to teTeX, while web2c distros are
preferred by people who move between Win32 and unix/linux (especially
where the texmf tree is on a network share).

I recently helped a colleague convert a book originally prepared using
Y&Y tex and author plain tex macros to pdftex.  Most of the work was
in converting fugures from
"EPS" to pdf.  Many of the figures had bounding boxes that cout off
parts of the figure, some weren't EPS at all.  I ended up using
several different systems due to problems with the utilities (outdated
version of epstopdf not handling Mac newlines, ghostscript barfing on
certain figures, etc.).   We expect any distro to handle simple tasks,
so the differences that matter are in the details.

Total numbers aren't that useful when the community is fragmented.
It would be better to ask if there are significant numbers of Win32
users for whom MikTeX isn't suitable.  Certainly I have read of
problems with context in the past.

Curious view, to my mind. If you use Office, why
do you also want TeX? don't people use TeX
because they cannot bear Office?

There is another article, Josef Pol?ch: Anketa u?ivatel? TeXu, in
http://bulletin.cstug.cz/bul20033-4.shtml (Czech language) which covers
other topics, e.g. how the users came to TeX, from where they learned TeX,
what kind of problems they had (or have) and what they are missing in TeX.
It might be interesting to make a similar questionnare filled in by a
larger community.

How so?  I find that the kind of documentation accompanying Unix-like
systems is more suitable for engaging one's own brain in solving
problems.  There are files documented in manual pages, and editable
files, too.  In Windows, stuff tends to stick in binary files in
unknown and undocumented locations, and you click around for accessing
them.  There are "knowledge database" articles which might spell out
where to click around to achieve a certain effect, but I find this
less than satisfactory.  If you clicked around too much or imprudently
and incoherent cruft managed to accumulate in binary files due to
that, you are best off reinstalling the system.

The kind of support that is actually affordable to private persons is
usually of the "blind leading the blind" variety due to the closed
nature of Windows.  In contrast, getting high-quality information from
other private persons seems to work better for me with free software.

Also I don't see a satisfactory replacement for the man page
infrastructure (which every separately distributed application can and
usually does employ) on Windows.

Could you spell out the kind of support you find easy to get for
Windows?

convert to HTML using TeX4ht etc, which can make bitmaps
of the maths, then read the HTML into Open Office
and save as .doc. No Word required.

It will look horrible, of course :-}

Which brings me to a question I always wanted to ask: Could you please
ship the latest NTEmacs with AUCTeX pre-installed with the next
version of TeXLive? As it used to be with earlier versions of TL.
Would be of great help for Windows users without broadband access.

Have a look into the mailing lists and into the newsgroups. Hardly
anyone mentions TL for Windows there any more. Since Fabrice quit
TeXLive (thanks for your excellent work, Fabrice), MiKTeX took over
because it is so easy to install and easy to update, despite all its
shortcomings. These are the reasons mentioned most often when MiKTeX 
is recommended.

J?rgen.

It was?  I was of the opinion that the shipped stuff was from XemTeX
and used XEmacs rather than NTEmacs.

> Would be of great help for Windows users without broadband access.

It might be a reasonable idea to use the CVS Emacs executable with
AUCTeX that is available from <URL:ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu>,
either in addition to the previous shipping of XEmacs, or replacing
it.  I am not sure whether XEmacs provides compelling value if the
delivered port is not selected and prepared for TeX users like it had
been previously done by Fabrice.

There is no evidence ... just looking around me and also probing the TeX
related messages I can read (GUT list).

Also the activity on sourceforge seems quite high:
http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=10783&ugn=miktex

Don't know if we can rely on it. 2000 downloads per day seems very
high.

Not all universities labs in the world are filled with Linux PCs
... Here in France the Windows market share is high even in
universities. 

Also, from my experience, Linux is not well implemented outside of
some kind of cs/maths/sci departments. Other people having other
requirements do use TeX also.

It doesn't deny  anything because 50% of  TeX under Windows  users using
TeXLive today ... what do they use ? MiKTeX  is distributed with TeXLive
... so what conclusion to draw ?

For myself, my guess would be that 60-70% of TeX users use TeX under
Windows and almost all of them today under MiKTeX. But tht's only my
guess. Just out of curiosity, I would be interested in real figures.

Not that much if you pay attention to what you do. Some colleagues did
that beacause in a group of 5 of them, only one was used to LaTeX, but
they wanted to use the revision system available with MSWord. So the
main document has been done with LaTeX, they exchanged revisions on the
.doc imported from the HTML converted document. It worked. The final
document has been typeset in PDF with PDFLaTeX.

I wish I could get rid of MS Office but unfortunately, our
adminsitration and 99% of other colleagues find it perfectly usable. So
as we live in a democracy (and anyway I'm not the boss in my place :-))
.. I have to bear MS Office.

And to add another opportunity for a flame thread ... it is even
impossible to expect to share document work between MS office and Open
Office. Or at least the last attempt I had to do that failed
miserably. I have been given a document model for some sort of
catalogue. Trying to fill the model under Open Office gave a result
which was very different from the MS Office one.

I am typesetting books and the authors give me manuscripts in MS Word. And
sometimes I have to prepare text for some organization (e.g. some
conference) and they strictly require MS Word. Now I will have to cope
somehow with a mathematical text, it must be in MS Word and I have it
currently in LaTeX...

Unfortunately, converters don't work good enough. When doc format is
required I use OpenOffice for writing directly.

as already mentioned, when one runs multiple trees, fptex binaries are quite useful; i'm not sure where ptex gets the sources from, but that one is popular in the far east (where they also have their own unix variants if i'm right) 

if i remember right, the main reason for fabrice to quit was the fact that it was impossible to reach a state where there is one code base (merged patches and so) and that fact alone made me feel rather sad

miktex's success is, apart from sophisticated packaging, also due to the fact that the author went its one way and is free from cross platform woes; however, i dunny what the state is of the miktex unix port (announced some tiem ago on the website)

I'm inclined to agree. For daily interchange

I didn't mean to say that I use MS Office.  However, on most Windows
boxes MSO is installed. What we need is a TeX system that most Windows
users can manage because otherwise they will stay with the Office
suits. See the other post on TL vs. MiKTeX. 

I don't remember a question on de.comp.text.tex lately by someone who
said he used TL under Windows.

Yes, NTEmacs was shipped with TeXLive (fpTeX) up to TL 6 or 7 with
AUCTeX installed. After all, that's how I came to use it.

1. It took me years to learn how to read a manpage. Let's face it:
   Most people will never be able to use unix-like online help files.

2. I work in the legal profession where Windows prevails. Everyone
   around runs Windows. I have become rather experienced, but it was a
   great help in the beginning to know that literally everyone you
   meet knows how to use Windows + MS Office. It was the right choice
   to opt for Windows, then. No regrets. But it was the wrong choice
   to opt for MS Office. So I corrected the latter, but not the
   former. 

3. The more experienced you are the less you rely on external,
   personal support. Linux may be more widely spread in the, say,
   "technical" community, but not elsewhere.

4. At least to me it is much easier to select hardware for Windows
   than for a Linux system. I think this is very much the same for all
   users outside the IT community.

5. Isn't this all OT here? ;-)

Regards,
J?rgen.

i had a peak of web traffic on the cambridge ctan a few months back.
turned out it was the same machine downloading miktex repeatedly:
amounting to nearly 40gbytes of stuff.  miktex on cambridge ctan is
somewhat over 400 mbytes: a determined person, whoever it was.

my point being, that you can't necessarily count on sanity from the
raw statistics.  (and thinking about it, 2000/day from one site is a
heck of a lot of bandwidth ... even allowing that sourceforge is a big
site.)

In this sort of project, you get what people are willing to provide.
I'm not surprised that fewer people are willing to write code for
Win32 than for linux.

If all the above can really work with a common texmf tree, this plan
makes lots of sense.  In practice the installer needs to tell the
user:

"found pdfetex version 1.20 in the path! Please update to version 1.30
or higher or adjust your configuration"

It would be good to maintain a list the TeX binary packages with which
the TL tree is expected to work.  This would give certain linux
vendors an incentive to update their tetex packages and provide a URL
other than "how to report a problem" in replies to certain bug
reports.

What we loose:

1) the ability to promote the spread of useful new binaries (e.g.,
sam2p, xetex).
2) control of versions of texmf/scripts that were copied over to
    the binary distro in years past (rather than use the kpsewhich
    method to find scripts in the texmf tree at runtime)
3) uncertain support for legacy unix systems (now that tetex is not
being maintained)
4) opportunities to complain about certain OS's

There could be some benefits to people trying to put together new
linuix distros -- rather than deciding what to include on the basis of
user requests, the distro can
provide a really minimal texmf tree (e.g., using system fonts) and
suggest to people who want more that they install the TL tree.

eh, i don't understand what you mean, fabrice provides whatever is

so ...)

since tex live is TDS compliance any TDS compliant binary package should 
work; actually, i had the impression that linux packagers ship patched 
versions of texmf.cnf files (in etc instead of web2c) so the most that 
can be done is to have sort of 'reference texmf.cnf' file, which is what 
tex live provides

i dunno what sam2p is -)

xetex emerged on the mac, and once ported to a more generic backend 
(xpdfmx) is now avaliable in linux and windows so it demonstrates that 
new things (when found useful) are picked up (actually, dvipdfmx for a 
long time was only standard available in the windows part of tex 
distributions, maybe because most cjk users use windows, i dunno)

i fear that this is too much related to 'distributer policies' which 
themselve relate to the different operating systems; i admit that it's a 
tough part of the game

but don't most linux distributions base their tex stuff on debian then? 
(i dunno how standardized tex is among linux distributions, mayb eonly 
differences in what gets installed, not so much the locations)

sam2p is a very interesting program, written by Peter Szabo, which
converts various bitmap formats to EPS or PDF.  It is incredibly fast
and produces extremely small files.  It's a good alternative to
ImageMagick.

      http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p

I'd like to have sam2p in TeXLive-2006, but there are still some
problems.  sam2p can be compiled like any other program (configure &&
make && make install) without any problems under Linux but I don't get
it compiled in the TL build tree.  It assumes that all generated files
will go to the directory where the sources are.  This is not the case
for TeXLive.  Peter has not the time to adapt it for TeXLive and I
have no experience with autoconf.

If we don't get it compiled in the TL build tree, I think as a last
resort it is sufficient to provide pre-compiled binaries for Windows.

The stable release of Gentoo Linux provides a sam2p package already
and I suppose that most other Linux distros provide it as well.

  Reinhard

It's still beta, but some posters on de.comp.text.tex have said they
are already using the package manager and it's said to work alright.

For sure most linux distributions base their TeX stuff on teTeX; whether
the rpm-based distros borrow from us (Debian) I do not know.  I've heard
rumors, but I guess this means more something like "take the things that
seem to fit, leave the rest", and not that Redhat or SuSE rpms are based
on Debian work.

The locations should be pretty much the same, except that there are
different numbers of TEXMF trees:  In sarge (released one year ago),
Debian had a TEXMFMAIN and a TEXMFVAR tree, plus support for TEXMFLOCAL
and TEXMFHOME trees.  The next release will have TEXMFDIST (teTeX or
TeXlive, depending on the admin's choice, or even both combined),
TEXMFMAIN (other TeX packages in deb format), TEXMFVAR, TEXMFSYSCONFIG,
plus support for TEXMFLOCAL and the user trees.

Placement of binaries, manpages etc. is standardized by the Linux FHS.

    don't get it compiled in the TL build tree.  

Integrating sam2p into the TL build is still on my list.  I'm sorry I
haven't gotten to it yet.  (If any other potential TL developers would
like to take a crack at it, so much the better. :)

The same is probably true between different versions of MS Office.  I
have worked too little with current MS Office to be sure, but it was
like this when I still did.  In the old times, my wife used StarOffice
just for the purpose of converting doc files from one version to the
other...

Does Christian intends to port the complete MikTeX to UNIX or just the

MikTeX users usually install a very small package and all missing
files are downloaded on-the-fly when they are needed.  And they
download updates from the server.  I don't know how to rate the number
of 2000 downloads per day.  Maybe it is not *that* much.

Sorry, no. Compatibility with MS Office is at least ensured. Ok, you
can't expect to load files produced by version 11 with version 10
without a glitch. But onward is ok. 

Anyway, that was not the point. The point was that the same .doc document read
by OpenOffice last version and MS Office 11 looked awfully different;
the layout had a title and the rest of the page on 2 columns. Under MS
Office, only 1/3 of the secon column was filled up when both columns
were filled up under Open Office. Also under Open Office, the vertical
layout looked really weird.

Anyway, that means that you can't even use OpenOffice when your
colleagues/administration is using MS Office.

If you could put this version of Emacs for Windows on CTAN it would be
included in the TeX Collection automatically. Probably, no further
work by the TL team would be needed. How about this, David?

thats a bit harsh. 99 out of 100 daily documents
go fine between OO (version 2) and Office. Its just
that 100th document, like yours, where all
hell breaks loose.

I don't recall when I last had any problem
reading a .doc file.

Not a good idea in my book: there is a reason it is on alpha.gnu.org:
this is development software straight from the tap.  It means that any
particular snapshot might turn out rotten.  Only a pick-and-test
procedure will avoid drawing a lemon reliably.  And that means that it
should get manually placed into TeXlive, not just as a random
snapshot.  That way, testers have a chance to change the choice of the
included version.

david doesn't "just put" a thing on ctan: we need to be convinced that
it's sensible for ctan.

i fear it would be difficult to persuade the team as a whole.  there
are limits, and while we've had the mac editor alpha since time
immemorial, i would fear a bilious explosion of wittering on c.t.t

Subject: [tex-live] Xemtex and updmap
Message-ID: <20060622012735.GA14503@canax3.onu.edu>



Hi:

 I was using TexLive2005 on windows XP but I couldn't get it to work
 with Xemacs and auctex, and I was having problems with windvi, which
 would render ligatures like fi with a theta. So I uninstalled Texlive
 and installed Xemtex. Everything works OK. I was trying to use
 D.P.Story's acrotex presentation bundle, in which he has apb.map with
 two tfm files. I was able to successfully install it with texlive, but
 Xemtex gives me no end of trouble. I tried to put apb directory in
 C:\PRogram Files\Xemtex\texmf-var\fonts\map and put the apb.map in the
 apb.directory. Also in the fonts\tfm I put apb with the tfm files from
 D.P.Story. I added Map apb.map to updmap.cfg in texmf\web2c and tried
 to run updmap --cnffile updmap.cfg --enable Map=apb.map but this comes
 up with a no such file on line 687....

 texmf-local instaed of texmf-var does not work either. I tried updmap
 --cnffile updmap.cfg --edit --enable Map=apb.map but it seems to choose
 Notepad as the editor and that is a nightmare. The documentation seems
 to suggest that I can get another editor, but I have not succeeded.

 I have tried various other ideas following updmap --help, but they all
 fail. Anybody knows how one installs a font.map in Xemtex? Googling has
 not given me any useful hints.

 Thanks.

You need to run updmap from a shell inside XEmacs :

M-x shell

and do whatever you need from there.

Not always. A year ago I received a text in Hindi written in MS Word with
Arial-Unicode. I tried to open it in the new computer with the latest
WinXP and Office with all Service Packs applied and did not managed. I
tried in several other computers but nothing help. Finally I was able to
open it in Linux in OpenOffice.org 1.1.3.

Well, the trick with non-backwards-compatibility was that once anybody
who you exchanged documents "upgraded" to the newest gadgetry,
everybody was forced to cough up and follow suit.  I think
forwards-compatibility tended to work reasonably most of the time, in
contrast.

Some Win32 users edit TeX files with Word, use PowerPoint for
presentations, and Excel for plots. In the Win 3.1 days, Y&Y's
dviwindo let you paste equations straight into PPT, but now with Win32
and TL they make png images of equations for use in PPT, whch is OK
because current hardware can handle 300 dpi images.

Well, adding Emacs to CTAN isn't exactly a surprise. We have
extensions for vi and nedit as well as AUCTeX on CTAN already. So why
not add the editor itself to CTAN, too? 

David is right, of course, as far as QA for the alpha port of NTEmacs
is concerned. OTOH there have been quite encouraging reports on
d.c.t.t. about this port, though I didn't test it so far. The official
NTEmacs from <URL:http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/> is stable. I
have been running v21.3 long enough to be able to say so.

Would be the easiest way to ship the most important editor for TeX on
CD/DVD to the Windows users amongst the members of the user groups.

Because it is not TeX-specific?  Strictly speaking, neither is
Ghostscript, though.

The overall number of reports on the AUCTeX list for Windows is rather
low and has dropped sharply since we provided the precompiled
version.  It's probably to be taken as a good sign overall.

But it does not support preview-latex and a few other features.

I am not convinced that "easiest" spells "best" here.  I think the
CVS Emacs/AUCTeX compilation would make a good offering on TeXlive,
but don't think that there is a good place on CTAN right now.

Thanks for the hint. It solves some problems but not all. To recap:
D.P. Story has a map file apb.map whose contents are the two lines

webdings Webdings
winding  Wingdings-Regular

and two tfm files Webdings.tfm and Wingding.tfm. He gives the
instruction of how to install the fonts in MikTeX:
1. copy updmap.cfg from web2c to \localtexmf\miktex\config
2. To the bottom of this copied updmap.cfg add the line
   # ding for APB
   Map abp.map
3. copy abp.map to \localtexmf\miktex\config
4. copy the apb folder containing tfm files to \localtexmf\fonts\tfm
5. refresh data-base and run initex --mkmaps.

and test installation with webdings_test.tex.

When I modified this procedure for texlive for windows, I just changed
the updmap.cfg in texmf/web2c, copied the tfm files to /texmf/fonts/tfm
did the update with updmap and successfully tested with installation.

Xemtex seems to be giving me no end of problems. I ran the shell from
withing xemacs as you suggested (updmap --cnffile updmap.cfg --enable
abp.map) with all kinds of variations of placing the tfm files and
nothing seems to work.

I have tried adding Map abp.map to the bottom of /Program
Files/Xemtex/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg, put the abp.map in
..texmf-var/fonts/map/abp, the tfm files in texmf-var/fonts/tfm/ (and
also other variations ). It was not able to find the abp.map files, and
it was clear from the log file the the pdftex.map files was being lloked
at. So I added the two lines in the abp.map to the bottom of the
pdftex.map, but I get the following error:

Warning: pdflatex.exe(file C:/Program
File/../texmf-var/fonts/map/updmap/pdftex.map): invalid entry
webding: font file missing) , the compilation goes through, but it does not find the files. 

Could you give me some hints as to how to proceed?


1. All latex files seem to come up with the non-fatal error:

Cannot execute command "[DocClose(%.s")]" (error 16393). Is there
something wrong with my installation?

2. D. P. Story's Acrotex Presentation Bundle requires that all latex
files be latexed 3 times then the dvi converted to pdf through dvips
and Acrobat. Xemtex does not appear to allow simple latexing directly
from xemacs. Is it possible to do a simple latexing in xemacs?

Thanks.

Maybe because there are reasons why you should not have installed both
texlive and xemtex ...

Starting from a fresh xemtex installation, the following command inside
an XEmacs shell should work :

updmap --enable Map=abp.map

    > 1. All latex files seem to come up with the non-fatal error:

    > Cannot execute command "[DocClose(%.s")]" (error 16393). Is there

No, it happens the first time you try to view the document in Acrobat
only because the file has not yet been opened in Acrobat. Subsequent
trials will close the document that is open before compiling it. The
message is harmless.

No, XEmTeX is targetted at producing pdf and html documents for latex
and context, but by direct pdflatex compilation. For other schemes, you
are on your own. Albeit I could look at D.P. Story stuff and provide
some configuration for it.

It is a great advantage for TeXLive maintainers if things which will
go to TeXLive are on CTAN.  In TL-2005 there are some outdated
packages because the authors didn't send the latest versions to CTAN.

TeXLive developers do not have enough time to search the web for more
appropriate stuff.  They rely on CTAN.

I understand that not everything can go to CTAN.  There must be a
limit.  I also understand that CTAN maintainers are not interested in
endless discussions about such a limit.

Robin, is it possible to have at least everything on CTAN what Karl
wants to have in TeXLive? 

Regards,
  Reinhard

this is fine: so long as everyone is aware that ctan is also dependent
on authors to upload their stuff (or make it available for us to
mirror).  i'm currently chasing a package (xymtex), but that's pretty
unusual -- mostly i just don't notice, and i'm unusual in even trying.

well, of course, there are things now on texlive that are not
accessible via ctan (other than the cd image we hold).  karl's
convinced me that this is ok ... reluctantly convince.

in general, however, we're keen to hold anything tex-related ...
within reason.  i remain rather unsure about complete (general)
editors, but that's a personal view (so far).  it would appear that
david is reluctant for emacs to be on ctan, for a different reason.

I am sorry I did not make this clear. I uninstalled texlive before I 
installed xemtex.  So what you have suggested below I have already 
tried. As I wrote earlier, the log file shows that no reference is made 
to the abp.map. Perhaps I am doing something pretty foolish, or the 
Acrotex presentation bundle is not compatible with Xemtex.  I will try 
to ask D.P.Story as well, be he has not shown any familiarity with 
xemtex: his instructions are only for miktex and Y&Ytex.

I recall that I earlier had problem running pdflates with files which 
contained .eps graphics files. SO I had to get the dvi file first, 
convert it to ps and then pdf. Is Xemtex able to handle files with .eps 
graphics files?

Which is not the only solution. The other one is to convert the eps
drawings in pdf and let pdftex process them.


    > Is Xemtex able to handle

epstopdf is provided to let you do the conversion. You can even make it
happen at compilation time automatically.

I just looked into it.  The license sounds quite funny:

   You may not distribute Tera Term Pro Web by any means to
   any other individual, company or entity.

Maybe I have to read the license more carefully to find out whether
I'm allowed to use this program at all.

Hi:
    I installed Texlive 2005 successfully on windows XP, but because I 
found it difficult to get it to work with Xemacs so I unistalled it and 
installed Xemtex. This had other problems, so I  unsintalled it and 
reinstalled TexLive. Now I get the error:

 error copying "C:/TexLive2005/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf": no such file 
or directory. The program selects automatically texmf-var/web2c; I seem 
to recall that the first time the directory was texmf-web2c for TEXMF.

THe details for the error gives:

while executing "source $filename install"
invoked from within (if file exist (file dirname $sourcedir) tlpm.exe) 
then
  {source $filename install}
 else {
      tk_message ... etc

I tried all kinds of things like deleting the old TeXLive2005 directory 
before reinstalling, but nothins seems to work. I have tries both the 
dvd and the cdrom, both give the same result.

Have I change unwittingly changed something, or is there are problem

I avoid Win32, but the recent emacs+auctex bundle has worked well as
long as I remember to close the acroread window before regenerating
PDF's (if was using Win32 a lot I'd put pdfopen/pdfclose into auctex's
configuration).

What problems?   When multiple apps don't work properly there may be a
hardware problem, disk problems that can be cured with a "chkdsk/f",
etc., or misconfiguration.
With Win32 starting from a clean install (with all the security
patches) is often faster and gives a better end result than endless
chasing problems.

Check http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2005-October/009109.html
for details
of a problem in the way the PATH is handled in the registry.

I installed and uninstalled TL2005 test versions on a couple systems
that had xemtex
"uninstalled", but haven't tried it with the final version.  My
experience has been that "uninstall" doesn't always clean everything
from the registry and environment.  After an "uninstall" it is good
practice to verify that all traces are removed using regedit (make
backups!) to search for entries that should have been removed.  I also
examine the output of the "set" command in a cmd.exe window for
references to the unistalled software.  For testing, I just renamed
the old texlive2005 directory so I could compare with the new install
to see what changed.  I also like to snoop with regedit and "set" to
see what was added after each install, so I know what to look for when
verifying a "remove".

I think the installer docs tell you what variables and registry
entries are used by TL2005.  From memory, the texlive2005\bin\win32
directory is added to the PATH,
and entries for PERL (PERl%_LIB?) and a temporary directory are added.
 Fptex put a lot of stuff in the registry that didn't always get
removed by "uninstall".  Xemtex and TL2005 were much less annoying
(e.g., either they don't set much or the uninstall is better).

1. remove old TeX Live directory
2. remove old environment variables: TLroot, TEXMFCNF and TEXMFTEMP
3. remove path to TeX Live/Xemtex from Path variables
4. remove tlpm*.* from your %Temp% directory
5. download fresh installer from
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui - all directory
6. close all explorer windows - important!
7. rename tlpmgui-1.33.exe to tlpmgui.exe - recomended
8. run tlpmgui-1.33.exe or tlpmgui.exe and install TeX Live

If you have Ghostscript or Perl already installed, you should unmark
these collection. Current version of tlpmgui recognize PERL5LIB and
GS_LIB and query you whether to modify these variables or not.
Unfortunately collection will install if you don't unmark manually.

Please let us know on our list tlpmgui at gust.org.pl.

Best regards

anything at tug.

Ken, thanks for reporting.

I don't remember when we changed this; it used to work with pkg-tex for
some time, but now it doesn't.

No, first of all also here pkg-tex has to be replaced by debian-tex.
But even that doesn't work;  I am not sure whether checking out via http
is supposed to work at all.  With the svn method it works:

svn checkout svn://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-tex/texlive

(note that wsvn must be changed to svn here).

Not to start another flame thread, but that may interest some people. In
attempt to compile web2c with MingW (which I consider an interesting initiative,
contrarily to Cygwin), I noticed a huge annoyance.

I tried to grep for something in a large bunch of files... MinGW grep
seems uninterruptible, either with Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break in the XP
console. This kind of problem does not happen when programs are natively
compiled under Windows. 

So I guess that  justifies the reason _not_  to rely on those adaptation
layers. If you want Unix,  then put Unix on your  PC box, but if you run
Windows, prefer natively compiled programs.

I have just tried the devnag preprocessor version 2.14 which was compiled
by mingw version 3.4.2 in Windows 98 and the test was run in Windows 2000.
Ctrl-C works fine.

I admit that my version of mingw is quite old, at that time it was
distributed as a single file. I did not manage to make newer version of
mingw working, I do not know which files I really need and since I am not
a Windows user, I just want to compile devnag for others, I decided not to
read the lengthy documentation.

If you are using Debian or Ubuntu: these distros have mingw32
cross-compiler packages, even for the powerpc platform.

Which doesn't prove anything about reliability of MSYS-1.0.dll !

c:\>grep foo */* */*/* */*/*/*

in a large source tree. 

c:\>c:\local\MinGW\bin\grep.exe --version
grep (GNU grep) 2.4.2

Depends on MSYS-1.0.DLL of 01/05/2004.

Repeatable behaviour.

My own compiled Gnu Grep 2.5 does not exhibit this behaviour, but it is
compiled and linked against MS libc.

Now think about an Emacs using such an uninterruptible grep.exe in the
background.

Sorry, I downloaded this stuff directly from the mingw site. And I won't
download MSYS dll sources to find the root of the problem, albeit I
expect it to be in the expansion of arguments on the command line which
your test doesn't use.

Hello TeXLive maintainers,

I'd like to ask the following question:
ConTeXt has 'migrated' most of its scripts from Perl to Ruby. 
Would it be possible to include Ruby to the TeXLive distribution?

Thanks,
Richard

I wonder if that would be a good idea. Perl is not part of TL either, 
is it? Or bash, etc. Someone creates a new TeX-based module for music 
which uses Lisp, are we going to include Lisp?

What could help people is to add warnings if certain tools are not 
available, advising the user to install them.

Yes, there is a Perl for Windows.

No need to provide these programs for UNIX.  But for Windows it's
helpful if important programs are on the CD or DVD.

Fully agreed! Of course, experimenting with Cygwin or MingW is still 
welcome, but somehow off-topics on that list, as we want to provide
TL for simple Win32 users, not for hackers who love and need to install
all that emulating u*x mess.
I'd prefer to concentrate on what and how can be done for web2c win32 
port, and I hate (sorry!) all that discussions about which system is 
better, etc. etc. I'm convinced that so many good works in the TeX area
(fonts, macros, beautifull publications) are made using only Windows, 
so such discussions are simply unfair and useless. As I recall, such
discussion is somehow hot especially on May and/or June, every year... :-)

Sitting well on both (linux and windows) horses,

Yes, I forgot to mention that I had in mind the Windows installation.
Currently, the bin/win32 directory contains perl.exe and even bzip2.exe, gzip.exe, gunzip.exe etc. None of them are unfortunately present on a Windows machine by default. :-(
Regarding ConTeXt itself - with the current distribution (TeXLive 2005), it is possible to install TeXLive and run ConTeXt directly (because the version included still uses Perl scripts). If you add the recent ConTeXt into the next TeXLive distribution, the Windows users will have to install something additional or they will probably use ConTeXt with the old Perl scripts.
So I'd suggest to include the Ruby interpreter for Windows into the TeXLive distribution if possible (I don't know how about the licensing issues etc.).

-Richard

Most Linux distributions also have no ruby by default.

Well, but having to install externally downloaded software sort of
defeats the idea of a live TeX system.

I am not sure, I think that I had to check Ruby manually during
installation. It was present on the installation DVD of Fedora but default
was not to install it.

Well, this is already a bit offtopic, I guess. 
But,  IMHO, the TeXLive distribution should contain everything needed to  process a *.tex file by the TeX (ConTeXt in particular). 
By the way, if you run for instance "texmfstart.exe texexec.rb" with no Ruby installed, it simply DOES NOTHING... :-(

The Windows port of LyX provides installers, which ease the download/install
of needed third party programs (if not already present)
http://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows

Would that be appropriate for TeXLive on Windows ?

I guess that dependency management would do it for Linux distributions.

I don't think that it's a big problem to install Ruby from a Linux
distribution.  Does anyone know about a Linux distribution which does
not provide Ruby?  Is there a Linux distribution which does not
provide sam2p?

Including Ruby for UNIX would mean to integrate it into the Build tree
so that binaries for all platforms can be created. 

There had been a discussion on the teTeX list about texinfo many years
ago.  Many people preferred the texinfo version provided by the system.

For Windows the situation is different:  Though I agree with Hans that
it is quite easy to install 3rd party software, it is annoying to find
out from where to get the latest release and download it.  Ruby is not
the only thing, there are also ghostscript, graphics conversion tools,
emacs... 

As David said, there is the live system.  People who are using it
usually never used TeX before and just want to try.  They are very
impatient, of course, and they give up if they are not able to make it
work in a reasonable amount of time.

The live version is on the DVD and I think it's not a problem to
provide everything Windows users need.  I don't know how much space is
left on the install CD, former or later the installer will say "Insert
Disk 2" anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In my view, it definitely doesn't make sense to integrate Ruby into the
TL build structure (or otherwise attempt to include it) for Unix.  I am
already overwhelmed getting all the actual *TeX* stuff updated, never
mind including big new OS programs.

If someone can provide Ruby executables for Windows, I am not opposed.
However, I cannot seek it out or test anything for Windows (as usual),
so others will have to take care of it if it's going to happen.  (Same
is true for Windows emacs+auctex, etc.)  I don't think it's an absolute
necessity to include it.


What *would* be nice, for all platforms, is if the top-level context
scripts could report "ruby is not available, please see http://whatever"
if ruby is not present.  Then it would be even less important to include
it in the distribution.  Hans, would that be possible?


    rk> I don't know how much space is left on the install CD, former or
    later the installer will say "Insert Disk 2" anyway.

I have no intention of attempting to do a multidisc CD distribution,
although, as usual, if someone else wants to get deeply enough involved
to implement it, I don't especially object.

At the moment, the only way I see to make the inst disc fit will be to
leave out some of the more obscure Unix architectures.  Picking and
choosing other sorts of packages would mean a lot of changes to the
infrastructure, so I can't undertake that either.

Karl


P.S. Regarding Texinfo, I personally would be happy for Texinfo to *not*
be included in TL.  However, when I have proposed that in the past,
others have strongly preferred that it continue to be included.  So
fine.

you're joking, aren't you?

a google for ruby + download brings you to a page where one can find 
installers for windows (and once installed, due to file assiciations one 
can runy scripts without the need to rename them to suffixless files)

ghostscript, imagemagick, emacs ... all easy to install

it all depends on how you look for files, so unix users looking for a 
windows file may search differently than windows users for unix files

concerning unix: when i need the latest version of something i download 
a tarbal with code, compile it (several steps involved), become root in 
the process, etc etc. just as you have problems with locating and 
installing a windows installer, windows users may find that compile 
route troublesome ...

so ... i got the feeling that we're entering an os-pre-con-discussion 
loop here ...

anyhow, tex live has to be installed anyway, so i can imagine that on 
the dvd we put (for windows users) copies of the installers of most 
important stuff that comes in handy (ruby, perl, gs, inkscape, emacs, 
vi, whatever); space enough

for linux users we can then stick to a bunch of readme files (or 
scripts) explaining how to install these things using the dvd's 
(assuming one had the installation on dvd) or the web (assuming that one 
has a connection)

for mac users ... well, they have ruby already installed, and gerbens 
installer takes care of the rest (also non tex progs)

problem solved

People who use TeX professionally will certainly be able to solve
their problems themselves.  They know what TeX is (hopefully) and
install it.

The live system is mainly used by beginners, and it is very unlikely
that a beginner needs XML.

Hans, what do you propose?  Not to provide Ruby for Windows?  And why?

  Reinhard

Again, the purpose of a live CD is not to have to install a lot of
software.

You are always assuming Internet connection and broadband and
whatsoever, but a lot of people are interested in TeXlive because they
can't afford that.

I don't even have net connectivity with my Windows partition, and I am
certainly not going to change that, given Windows' security track
record.

Hi Reinhard

indeed, because i think that most (windows) context users install tex live on their disk (i just copy the lot) and if they know that ruby is needed (could be mentioned in the installer) they can install ruby alongside; if needed i can make texmfstart a binary which then can report a missing ruby (which reminds me that i need to do that for miktex) 

the most important thing is that the stubs to the scripts are right but that's true for win/lin/mac 

if users are really desparate, they can download the minimal context distribution for windows which ships with the stuff needed, and is just a subset of tex live (where else should i get the files -) 

(even if ruby is installed, once users start doing fancy things they will need gs, pstoedit, imagemagick, inkscape, xsltproc, etc etc) 

the most troublesome part of an installation (or update) is not in the binaries, but in (missing or changed) fonts, patterns, etc but i tend to  get rid of such dependencies) 

let's not make the live of the packagers more complex than it is already

This another damn assertion about Windows.

I'm on the CERT  list (Computer Emergency  Response Team) for the French
National   Research Network. I   did  statistics on their  vulnerability
alerts. And  believe me or  not, but over  almost  a year 1/3  where for
Windows, 1/3 for Linux and 1/3 for other OS (mostly SunOS).

So Windows is not more vulnerable, but it is probably
a better target because it is much more widely spread.

Ok, I'll stop there.

don't worry, one gets the sec patches for a relative long period even 
when new versions come out, and i never had a problem with security 
anyway (interesting is that i cannot get security fixes for my two year 
old linux boxes, but then i don't worry about that either);

beware of pdftex ... it links to png lib which has a security breach 
(just fixed but could be a problem if you don't update)  ... the danger 
is in the pictures -)

It is already the case that Windows XP first edition is "out of date"
with regard to security in the respect that it takes longer to
download and install Service Pack 2 on a broadband connection than it
takes for the first virus infections to occur.  I am not putting my
system (it is pre-XP since I don't care for phone-home to Microsoft
and let them remotely destroy my system without recompensation if they
want to kind of licenses) on the net.

Debunking those numbers has been done elsewhere.  The severity of
vulnerabilities and how often they get counted (after all, there are
hundreds of different Linux systems), and for what _scope_ they get
reported (Windows contains almost no applications out of the box,
Linux thousands) has to be taken into account.

Botnets consist of Windows PCs, whether you like it or not, and for
whatever reason.

Probably better.

Microsoft's latest "security uploads" include a utility that checks
for "legitimateness" of the Windows copy and nags if it considers you
available for that treatment.  Can't be removed, either.  The next
version is supposed to be compulsory, and to put the system down if
you haven't had your system phone home to Microsoft for three months.

The XP license explicitly allows Microsoft to remotely change and also
permanently damage your system without recompensation, even if you
have a legitimate license.

No way, Jose.  My computer is too important for my work.

I update my Linux box pretty frequently, don't worry.

crap ... my first version of linux is also out of date, actually, my 
first 9 versions of suse are out of date, i cannot longer update a web 
server that runs v 7, but i can still update my windows;

well, i update the mac automatically, and my linux boxes automatically 
so why not the window machine?

it sounds like you don't *use* windows, so better be careful with claims

anyhow, keep ranting this way and windows people will quit from this 
list and you will be freed from them

That's your choice. TL isn't made mainly for you, but for users. And
these users use XP now and will use Vista next year, so we have to
provide a TL for XP.

I still maintain that it is contraproductive to demand that every
Windows user of TeXLive should be required to have broadband (never
mind internet access).

And this holds independently to whether you consider my personal
reasons not to use net access under Windows noisome or not.

one does not need broadband more than for updating linux; also, one definitely needs broadband to download the twice per year huge whole system updates on linux; which btw is why i have broadband (this is the first year that i could actually download a suse instead of buying one) 

btw, i wonder how many tex users have modem only connectins, since even the cheapest broadband is cheaper than the phone

miktex users (a not neglectable group) install everything over the web 

we should be careful not to make assumptions that may be wrong, maybe texies are more up to date (broadband, cable, wireless) than you assume

It is not different if you get queued for a free service, or if your

With TeX.  Certainly.

I still don't see why having to download (or otherwise acquire) and
separately install utilities essential for the running of TeXLive on
Windows should be a good idea.  And that you have had nothing but
pleasant experiences with broadband net access for Windows does not
really convince me otherwise.

Why has this suddenly become an issue? ConTeXt has depended
on an external scripting language for about 10 years now,
whether it be Perl or Ruby or whatever it was that Hans
used to favour in the 1990s. I don't recall anyone
moaning much about it. TeX Live is not realistically
a "live" system these days, it's just hardly conceivable
anyone would use it like that, surely? Its a nice
complete distribution on a CD or DVD ready
to install, that's all.

Why does this list generate so much emotion
and anger? come on, guys, its just
computer software, its not real life.

I guess I am just lucky that I don't need ConTeXt.

I actually use it as a live system usually under every operating
system for starters, and install just when I need it frequently.  It
is also useful for carrying around.  While I agree that under Linux,
common utilities can be expected to be available on the installation
media of the operating system itself, the situation is different for
Windows.

Even if such executables are not provided in the live Windows tree, I
should think it reasonable to put them as installable images onto the
DVD if the licenses make that possible.

> Its a nice complete distribution on a CD or DVD ready to install,
> that's all.

Uh, last time I looked, it ran directly from the media and that's what
has given it its name.

I think we should not rule out that, say, people in Nigeria use a
TeXlive DVD for typesetting.  Also, TeXLive makes a nice carry-along
work environment.  If you are forced to install additional software
before it works, this hampers the versatility.  And having to download
it is even worse.

Now if this mainly concerns ConTeXt, I'd probably shrug my shoulders
and say "Hans' call".  I don't think it a good idea, but as long as it
only renders ConTeXt unusable for people without broadband, I can live
with that.

Nonsense.  Mail order exists.  And indeed, TeXLive is to a significant
degree distributed by mail order.

The sales numbers for TeXLive appear to speak a different language.

Yes, the more I read this, the more I compare this assembly to the one

When will you guys admit that what disturbs you much is that Microsoft is a
commercial company that makes _money_ by _selling_ software licenses and the real reason
beyond this anti-ms behaviour is much more political than technical ?
(or at least this the way I see it).

It is easy to argument on the defects of Windows, but 
my kids are playing on their computer for years, my father started to
use it at almost 70 to send emails, connect to the internet, do
audio/video conferencing with messenger (talking to my kids), my wife is
using her computer too for her job heavily each day. BTW, they don't
expierience much annoiyances. And now imagine I
switch all these people from their XP os to some Unix version and change
all the applications too for Unix ones. Don't tell me that they will agree and be
satisfied. Just because they don't want to do any kind of programming,
they don't want to type in shell commands, they don't want to understand
how it works. They just want to use it.

Let computer scientists use tools for computer scientists but for the
good or for the bad, Microsoft has done a lot to make computers
accessible to the largest number of people.

For the record: I became a member of Dante because the TUGs offer TL
every year, and I wanted to support that. I also depend on CDs on my
olden laptop machine. My internet costs about 10 Euros/month which is,
believe it or not, double the cost for voice telephony in my case. If
I subscribed to DSL I would at least double my internet costs. No way.

Some do, some don't. I installed everything from the proTeXt CD, and I
update or add the packages I need by hand because I don't like *any*
automatic updating. Been there, seen that.

What would this change about the content of the TL CDs/DVD? It should
be as complete as possible. For *any* platform. Broadband is an option
for those who can afford it, it should not become a prerequisite for
using TL. Besiders, a CD/DVD is probably the broadest band you can
ever get. ;-)

I never spoke against that.  I spoke against providing a TeXLive DVD
that won't be able to run without making additional downloads and

Well, we should either support it or not.  Before letting this
possibility slump, I'd think it appropriate to figure out whether
indeed nobody uses this anymore.

Because they don't have broadband?  Or are you talking about using the
DVD (or CD) instead of installing?  Well, because large disks are
_expensive_ to acquire there?

I thought the whole point of TeXLive was that not everybody was

To repeat my previous point, apparently lost in the noise: if someone
cares to find or create a ruby.zip file for Windows that can go in
/support, it can go there.  If not, not.

If someone wants to go further and make a ruby package that is
installable in TL, that's cool too.

We are talking about whether to provide executables or at least

Which is the reason why we finally moved my 65-year old mother over to
Linux.  That way, she can't do nearly as much damage to the system
inadvertantly as she managed previously.  And the system can be
examined for problems (usually "disappeared" files saved to some
strange directory) remotely via ssh.  Even though it is a bit of a
nuisance that the 33kBit modem connection blocks her only phone line.
Which is _much_ cheaper than broadband even taking her online times
into account (she does almost only Email, and batches that).

Fine, so let's make TeXLive more useful on Windows by delivering it
with all tools necessary to run TeXLive under a computer made
accessible by Microsoft.

That was the point I was trying to make about the missing
ruby on linux. It may be on the distribution CDs or you may
have to download it (The situation is much worse on
commercial unices btw), but the main thing is that it
is not a true 'live' system.

If you install TeXlive on linux, then try to run context
straight away, it will fail. In fact, the only system where
it runs out of the box (that I know of) is on MacOS X.

Sure you can add ruby for win32, but that does not make it
a 'live' system all of a sudden, and the problem is not
specific to win32 to begin with.

You've posited they have a computer with DVD player; I suspect they
have some disk space too. We're not talking  children in a village
here, after all - they're using Ubuntu Linux supplied by Mark Shuttleworth,
and OpenOffice.

yes. and because of that, you can build a Live CD
with TeX on with a pretty simpled "apt-get" command.

the whole broadband issue is not related to installing (downloading) 
texlive, but only to some users downloading a few extras (a few meg ruby 
zip for instance)

downloading a complete os or updates for os's is another thread;

actually, if one depends on cd's dvd's for that, for the price of the 
bi-annual update cd's/dvd's one can pay the broadband -)

texlive dvd's are pretty cheap, for members only a few euro's, contrary 
to say suse or redhat professional, so that's a different issue

i remember the days when at user groups meetings we discussed the option 
to give away dvd readers to members so that we could stick to dvd's only

indeed

they may as well be ahead of germany with respect to fast connections, 
wireless, etc etc

even in bachotek (middle of nowhere) we had fulltime isdn lines (the 
only problem there was that some folks used the lines for downloading 
400 meg movies thereby crippling the rest)

they (the tex target audience) in nigeria etc do have mobile phones, 
probably internet, cars, computers, etc over there

ok, maybe not all school kids, but how many schoolkids are using tex in 
europe? i may hope not too many

There is a one-click installer at
http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?RubyInstaller

I understand that it can be redistributed under either the Ruby
License (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt) or under the GPL,
although the package also contains Windows redistributables.

hm, what is large, actually small disk are hard to get nowadays

there was a time that tex was eating up many resources (read 500 meg 
unzipped) but nowadays it's getting small (fits on a mem stick of 10 
euro) compared to the rest; an expanded open office takes more than a 
usable tex install; even the memory that tex uses is neglectable 
compared to what other progs or the os uses; a basic os (unzipped and 
not running from cd) install easilly takes a couple of  gig's and 
probably more if you want the fancy things as well

once we are able to run tex from zip files, people won't even notice 
that it's there

(i remember the times that the ntg had this bunch of floppies that were 
send in circle among members; next time i visit germany i must check if 
it's indeed as primitive over there as you suggest)

I think it can safely be assumed that the readers of the list have
understood the topic at point.

Depends on your source of CDs/DVDs.  And again: don't presume that
broadband pricing is the same worldwide as it is in cities in the
Netherlands.  There are areas where net connectivity is quite worse
than even my mother's 33.1kBit Modem (which at least is the limiting
factor here, not the provider).

my guess is that things will go as last years: manfred will talk to the 
people involved and gets things done (the extras on the dvd)

when the time is there i'll provide couple of links to installers that 
then can be copied on the dvd; plenty of room anyway

(no need to make packages, we can take the installers that are available)

"Under the GPL" implies that we'd also need to provide the
corresponding source code or a written offer.

The relevant parts of the above license file would be

    3. You may distribute the software in object code or executable
         form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

           a) distribute the executables and library files of the software,
              together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
              on where to get the original distribution.

           b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
              the software.

           c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, with
              instructions on where to get the original software distribution.

           d) make other distribution arrangements with the author.

      4. You may modify and include the part of the software into any other
         software (possibly commercial).  But some files in the distribution
         are not written by the author, so that they are not under this terms.

         They are gc.c(partly), utils.c(partly), regex.[ch], st.[ch] and some
         files under the ./missing directory.  See each file for the copying
         condition.

While 3a) looks fine for TeXLive, it is actually contradicted by 4.
Assuming that the specified files are under GPL, it would appear that
the whole dual-license thing is not really watertight according to the
interpretation put forward by the FSF and not yet contested in court.

So it would appear that we'd be better off providing a corresponding
source package as well.

so a pointer to source code would be enough, and maybe even:

google for "ruby source code download"

No. The considered legal view is that this
is not sufficient to meet the terms of the licence.
To comply with the GPL, we must offer to
supply the source code to the recipient
directly, for the exact version of Ruby which
we supply.  A vague "go google for the source
if you want" could have the FSF after us.

You've hit the greatest problem of Windows, the computer pretends to be
cleverer than a user. Such users often do not know what a directory is and
what a file is, they even do not know that files have names because Words
picks some phrase from the file and turns it into a file name. I have too
often problems opening someone else's Word documents in my Windows
computer because the file name contains national characters in a different
locale. I must first rename the file either in OS/2 or in Linux. The users
have no understanding of OLE so that they link images instead of embedding
them. We too often receive documents with missing images and tables. Of
course people will not understand how the programs work internally
similarly as the driver rarely knows what's going on inside the engine.
However, everybody knows the purpose of safety belts, steering wheel and
the clutch, unless he or she has a car with an automatic gear box.

It would be even better if Microsoft understood that most people have
usable brains. I taught one young lady to use computers, even the command
line. A few years ago I managed to teach her XML within 15 minutes
although she has never studied any university. Recently she came into a
course of making web pages. She learned HTML 3.2 and she realised, that
she understands it well because I taught her almost everything in the 15
minutes' explanation of XML.

At the danger of repeating myself: the state of affairs in cities in
the Netherlands is not the same as that everywhere on the world.

I was not talking about Germany.  Apart from that, there are
considerable areas in Germany where you can't get broadband.

well, then we can put the tar.gz file with the sources alongside (i 
suppose that we don't have to explain in detail how one generates the 
binaries)

btw, an interesting side effect is that in addition to support on the 
derived work (the tex distribution) user groups may end up in providing 
all kind of support (offering sources, burdning additional cd's, hiring 
web servers to serve the sources, etc); i wonder if that's the real 
intention of gpl. Say that i have 1 meg of webspace and provide a ruby 
script, does that mean that i also need to provide the 10 meg of 
libraries that are used and even the source code of the binaries needed 
to run them ... quite impractical); i'd expect that nowadsys, with the 
availability of networks references to locations would be enough; i 
wonder if such things will evolve to more practical ones some day

I think one has to take the attitude that the GPL conveys enormous 
benefit; but there is  a quid pro quo,
it isn't a free lunch

No. The rule is that you have to provide the source of material that you 
distribute. No more, no less.
If you don't distribute the library or intepreter, you're fine.

the GPL 3 is under discussion now....  I cant recall offhand whether it 
improves in this area.

Not really.  That's what the "or CD" was about.

Uh what?  You are talking about large cities in South Africa, I was
talking about Nigeria.  They happen to be on the same continent, yes,
but I don't think you'd claim that the IT situation in Nicaragua and
Texas is the same?

And Ubuntu?  We are still talking about what to provide with the
_Windows_ part of TeXLive, aren't we?

Requiring broadband...

I think it is pretty obvious that this "discussion" fails to get
serious arguments, so I suggest restricting it to the topic of what to
provide for a Windows distribution.

And I don't think it appropriate to dump the "Live" part of TeXLive
through the backdoor.  Either it is supposed to be part of the
offering or not.  And if it is to be removed formally, then I think we
should first try to figure out whether nobody indeed uses it nowadays.

ah, good! so we should have some central place where we can collect all the url's that matter (better be safe), something 'readme.url' in the root of tex live?

It would appear that the stuff on
<URL:http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167> provides single
installation executables.

It would probably be appropriate to include the latest "stable"
version at some point during the process of preparing for the next
TeXlive release.

Excuse me, what are you arguing about?  I think nobody in this thread
ever doubted whether installing ruby on windows is easy or not.  The
only questions, apart from flames, that were discussed seem to be

- Is it necessary and possible to include a ruby installer archive on
  the TeXlive media?

- Is it possible to prepare it for live use, i.e. without local
  installation?  How important is live usage?

The answer to the first question is yes, with the link above.  The
second question so far has only been asked, not answered.

Only if parts are copyrighted by the FSF itself.  Which is possible
judging from the license text I quoted.  But in that case the whole
dual-license stuff seems somewhat fishy.

The GPL states:

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
    source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

The real intent is that source (or access to it) accompanies any
binaries.  Yes, this is an expected side effect.  It is the reason all
free software packaging formats have correspondent source packages,
and all GNU/Linux distributions are accompanied by source CDs/DVDs on
the download sites or in the media packs.

Most Ruby scripts would not be considered a derivative of the Ruby
interpreter.  Compiled versions of them might be borderline, as long
as the compiled parts includes GPLed components from the compiler.

The problem is that there are no bandwidth guarantees.  I can place a
server online via packet radio, and it will usually be able to provide
enough bandwidth for several Emails a day.  Hard to draw the line
here.  It is also not fair to put the burden on providing the source
on an upstream party.  For example, if Microsoft chose to distribute
some GPLed software from an unsuspecting private person, divulging
itself of the source duty by pointing to his web site, his site would
be shut down because of too high a load.  Then he would either have to
provide the bandwidth at his own cost (for Microsoft's business) or
stop access to the source.  The latter is no option if he already got
parts licensed from somewhere else.

The GPL already states that it is ok to put up the sources at the
_same_ download location where the binaries are gotten from, and that
upstream then can't be made responsible if downstream chooses to
download only the binaries.

The nature of a public license, namely that distribution might get
_far_ larger than expected, makes it mandatory that the source code
duty might not get delegated upstream but should stay with the
binaries.

I'd suggest that this subject (and other similar ones) should be  
viewed in three parts, not just two (for any given OS that texlive  
supports):


(1) is it appropriate to include an installer for [utility X on  
system Y] on the texlive media?

-- yes, space (and licenses) permitting, if it is useful for specific  
TeX-related tasks.


(2) should [utility X on system Y] work "live" from the texlive  
media, without local installation?

-- as above, where feasible, though it's not critical that every tool  
can run this way if we don't have the time and resources to get this  
done in all cases.


(3) should the texlive installation process install a "private" copy  
of [utility X on system Y], or should local installations default to  
using already-available utilities, and leave the user to install them  
separately if needed?

-- this is the hardest call, IMO.... In the case of my OS X and Linux  
machines, I don't want a texlive installer that sets up a separate  
sandboxed copy of Perl/Ruby/Python/Ghostscript/ImageMagick/whatever;  
I want the TeX world to use the current versions of these utilities  
from my system. If texlive includes packages so that I can install/ 
update to the versions it needs, so much the better, but that's not a  
high priority.

I'm less familiar with the Windows world, but my instinct is to favor  
system-wide installation of such things there as well. I realize that  
a lot of these tools are not typically preinstalled, though, so it  
would be nice if a texlive installer could inform the user of missing  
pieces and where (on the TL media) to find them, or even offer to  
automatically install them. But I have no idea how to go about that  
on Windows.

this reminds me, on linux i ran into the situation that xetex expects 
imagemagick to be installed (which is kind of tricky since there can be 
multiple versions)

for such occasions fptex always had the relevant lib files present in 
the bin path, using some unique name; what do you suggest with respect 
to unix: installation alongside or depends on the os packages (libs)? (i 
assume that on the mac gerben takes care of it)

The usual texlive approach has been to statically link pretty much  
everything, but I'm not sure how practical this is for a tool that  
depends on imagemagick, which in turn depends on a bunch of other  
libraries.... at some point, we may have to say "it won't run unless  
you have at least version XX of imagemagick.... or rebuild the  
binaries on your own system, linking against the version you have".

What's really annoying is when distributors change the library name,  
so that existing binaries can't run without updating the makefile and  
relinking. I suppose it may be needed because of binary  
incompatibilities between the library versions. But I'm not sure that  
deciding to build our own separate space, so that we control  
everything, and ignore the outside world is a good answer. I don't  
want to operate in a "TeX ghetto".

For Linux distros, I'd guess that most packagers will rebuild  
binaries using dynamic linking, and package them with appropriate  
dependencies on other packages, rather than use statically-linked  
binaries from texlive. It's then up to the packager and the package  
management system to deal with version issues, etc. I can easily see  
that you could have run into problems with xetex, though, as it isn't  
yet being handled in that way.

(BTW, on the Mac, xetex doesn't use imagemagick; it uses quicktime to  
import graphics.)

the windows version of xetex is some 20 meg (if it had been statically 
linked), so i guess that a static linux version is about that size; for 
texlive i think this is ok since there is room on the dvd; after all 
there are bigger files in the tree

sure, choosing for such dependencies is up to the distributer (as long 
as they also provide support to users who don't get it running, need 
help with compiling, locating binaries or whatever libs); for user 
groups it's rather handy that they can say: "if something fails, take 
texlive (te/fp/gwtex cq. miktex), and if it works all right then, seek 
help elsewhere"

For a live system, it might be possible to stuff the required binaries
into a separate private directory and then just adapt the PATH
variable of the executing process to include this separate directory
without putting it in the system-wide PATH.  preview-latex by now does
something like that with most of its installations for preview.sty, in
order not to have to resolve conflicts and installations and whatever
with a preview.sty in the system tree.

Doing this for libraries as well will take some doing.
You'll have to wrap everything in a shell script
or the like.

Hello,

I've built a source rpm for teTeX, and I would like to do the same now for
tex-live. teTeX provided a texmf-tar archive and a source-tar archive.
I can see on the tug or ctan servers a source.tar.bz2 but no archive for
the texmf tree, only some uncompressed texmf-trees and the iso-images.
Could you provide please a compressed texmf-archive?
With that, it would be much easier to build the source-rpm...

Greetings, Peter

Win32 users are used to running via some GUI or an editor with "LaTeX" buttons.
(People who don't use WinEDT are always asking me for help making
4allTeX work in Windows XP).  WinEDT generally provides 2 ways to run
the external programs (macros and batch files, and they provide their
own versions of things like pstopdf.bat).

The problem with all this is that a) you risk breaking things for the
people who want to use the installed tools, and b) the list of stuff
we need is growing.

I don't think TL will be able to keep up, since the people who are in
position to actually to the work are so few.  It would be better to
put the effort into some sanity checks for the installed tools to warn
users about missing/broken/"too old" 3rd party tools.  I'd rather see
more of the tools (e.g., JabRef.jar) that are interest only to TeX
users.   If there are enough people running Win32 without decent
network access, there should be a much larger demand for a CD/DVD with
tools such as perl, ghostscript, sam2p, imagemagick, inkscape,
cinepaint, ruby, Java, tk/tcl, .... than there will ever be for TeX
Live.  If somebody does a nice job of THAT, we might think about
including it in TL.

Pardon me but I  think you definitely  missed the point  and this is yet
another damn assertion about Windows/Microsoft (and to some extent, that
applied to Apple years ago).

You have hit the greatest problem of computer scientists. They tend to
think that the computer should force his discipline upon the
user. Because it is the way they learn how to use (read program, hey
they are computer scientists) computers. And this what you did with
this young lady.

Mass market need computers for which the user has no effort to
provide. Tasks people need should be accessible easily, quickly,
effortlessly in a way that seems unthinkable to (some) computer
scientists. If I believe in something that is stable wrt humankind, it
is that people will always chose the solution that requires the less
effort. People on this list are certainly not of this kind.

You may not agree on this point, but on a huge scale, I bet that it is
always the solution requiring the less effort from the user that will
win. If you expect your user to understand actually what is happening,
or to learn some exotic language, then you will lose.

An often heard argument against applications using cygwin is that you have to 
download an install a lot of cygwin packages. I've been often told that 
cygwin applications are unusable because of this. So if there's no DVD 
containing all parts needed to run TeX on a normal consumer PC this would 
also be an argument against TeX and if such a DVD would be available this 
argument wouldn't fit.

BTW: I know TeX users at companies that are not allowed to download and 
install anything from internet. Some of them are allowed to install software 
on their local machine from CD or DVD. Some need help from admins for 
installation. If they need help from admins the admins often don't accept 
DVD/CD-R or -RW. The "commertial" TeX-Live-DVDs are accepted. But I don't 
think, that downloaded add-ons will be accepted. So if TeX-Live wants to be 
TeX for everybody all needed tools should be part of the DVD.

I'm glad that there's no such problem with LaTeX, because companies I know 
often do not use ConTeXt but LaTeX.

Nothing else than providing the tar.gz file is required.  Since we are
talking about Windows programs, I doubt that anyone wants to compile
them himself.

It's nice to hear that GPL 3 allows links to the sources, but I fear
that we cannot apply GPL 3 yet.  The final version is planned for next
year.

I don't see big problems here.  Ruby, Perl, Ghostscript... provided by
TeXLive are not modified.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  If people
have problems, it does not matter whether they installed it from the
CD or downloaded it from somewhere else.

If someone has a problem though, I'm sure that there are many people
on this mailing list who are willing to help.

At the moment the sources have to be provided on the DVD but I think
that next year it is sufficient to provide links.  If there is no need
to modify the programs the links can point to the site where the
programs come from instead of tug.org.

Regards,
  Reinhard

strange argument, one can run context as any other tex, but it's more comfortable when ruby is there, if needed i can convert the scripts to binaries; companies i know have no problem with it  

if a company uses tex, then they probably use it in some kind of workflow for which they need to install whatever needed, and installing ruby is a small price 

btw, for you info: the ruby scripts (one actually only needs texexec) is just a commandline for context and also does things like index sorting, keeping track of the number of runs needed etc; i feel sorry for the latex users who need to do that manually (although i would not be surprised if some use make files, perl scripts or whatever, which then also leaves them in the cold since tex live does not provide those either) 

I've explicitly chosen to write this stuff using a scripting language and not rely on some traditional programming language [in which case c would never have been my choice since i never felt comfortable with it; and the original modula versions lacked cross platform compilers]; the fact that the tex commmunity is not able to maintain a real cross platform source tree (ask fabrice) has proven me right in this choice 

anyhow, those who use tex in a more advanced workflow need additional tools anyway; maybe we should discuss which xml tools to include in tex live (xsltproc to start with). 

but, since it looks like context is the reason we discuss this, we can as well quit this discussion; as someone remaked already, context users are quite capable of installing ruby, to which i can add that the last tex collections also shipped with self-contained windows environments build around an editor that could run from the dvd directly.

Understanding files and directories takes no more than five minutes if it
is properly explained. Do you consider five minutes as long learning with
great effort?

Every year I get dozens MS Word documents unreadable in MS Word on my
computer from those who denied to spend these five minutes.

Greetings,

    the texmf tree, only some uncompressed texmf-trees and the iso-images.
    Could you provide please a compressed texmf-archive?

I don't really understand.  Can't you just get it with rsync, which will
do the compression over the line?  Or, if you want the released version,
then it's there in the ISO, so just get it and unpack it?  There are no
"sources" for the Master tree, it is what it is.

Sorry, but I can't spend more time on infrastructure than absolutely
necessary, I am so far behind with updates.

Best,
Karl

It is not my point. Wether it is 5 or 10 or 30, my point is that it is
not 0 minutes.

I don't understand this one? Do you mean because of included documents

Please.

If you want to drive, you have to get a licence and some training.
Even if driving a round is a task you need. You don't need to become a
mechaninc to learn to drive, but you need to know a minimal set of
things about the way cars work, plus all the rather complex rules
about on-the-road behaviour.

You don't let kids near acid bottles or guns, because you know they
can't handle them and could get hurt.

Computers should be no different: they are complex tools with complex
functionality that can do a lot of damage. No one should be let near
them without some minimal training.

Windows has made things worse, not better, by giving the illusion that
training is not needed.
