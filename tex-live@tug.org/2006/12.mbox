Thanks to Werner Fink, a scheme-tetex.tpm is now available in the TeX
Live repository.  It approximates the teTeX distribution, of course, so
anyone who wants can get that subset.  Happy to fix any discrepancies
people notice -- I didn't test it myself, beyond syntax.

Best,

Subject: [tex-live] TL 2006 documentation
Message-ID: <200612032217.kB3MHRW16303@f7.net>

Hello TeX Live documentation folks (and everyone),

I have made some very small updates to the TeX Live documentation for
2006, the release process for which is underway -- a short new section
on non-interactive installation, a couple of new people in the
acknowledgements, and a (very) brief summary of the year's changes.
Thus, I hope that the translation updates won't take much time this year.

I do not expect significant further changes, so please feel free to
update your translations.  Unless you already have TL's Subversion
repository checked out, it's probably easiest to just send me the new
source file(s) to check in.

The new live.tex for English is at:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-doc/source/english/texlive-en/live.tex?view=markup

For purposes of comparison, the 2005 live.tex is in the archive/ subdir
as usual:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-doc/source/english/texlive-en/archive/live-2005.tex?view=log

I've updated the HTML and PDF versions for English also:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/live.html
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/live.pdf

At the moment, I see no need for any changes in the top-level
readme.LL.html file
(http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/readme.en.html).  So that's one
less thing to do.

As you know, 2006 is drawing to a close, so time is unfortunately the
shortest it's ever been.  If you know you won't have time to do the
update within the next two weeks, please let me know so I can try to
find another volunteer.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. If there are other significant updates that should be mentioned,
please let me know asap.  I listed xetex, metapost, and pdftex
specifically.

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2006 binaries attempt
Message-ID: <200612060205.kB625QL15245@f7.net>

I just finished (as far as I know) updating the source for various
utilities in TeX Live today.

So I'd like to request all the binary builders (Tigran, Gerben, Norbert,
Manfred, Sebastian, Olaf, Vladimir, Apostolos, Ludger, David, Tim --
bcc'ing some of you in case you're wondering) to attempt a build from
the current sources.  If you don't already have them, you can retrieve
them by rsync or anonymous svn, see http://tug.org/texlive/svn.

Please report problems here, or send me (url's to) tgz's if success.  Or
feel free to check in the new binaries yourself (I will give you svn
write access if need be, of course).  On the other hand, if you don't
remember what architecture you were building, or know you won't have
time/interest to be able to do the compiles this year, please let me
know ASAP.


What is included: XeTeX and accompanying libraries, metapost update,
assorted utilities.

What's not included: the still-coming pdftex update.  I hope it will be
there soon.  This and a relatively minor update to XeTeX are the only
outstanding items (for the binaries) that I know of.

Especially because of xetex and the libraries, it will be very useful to
try a build now, even though it won't be the final one, to find any
problems.

Thanks,
Karl

The delays in obtaining e.g., pdfetex latest version may mean that the 2006 
release may not be available until January. Should we make a virtue of 
necessity and rename the current product as TeXLive 2007?  This might take 
some of the time pressure off for the next release 12 to 14 months from now. 

Just a thought.

I seem to recall seeing a note somewhere that ICU has problems with  
parallel makes, though I can't seem to find any reference to this  
just now.

I see similar failures with texinfo on Ubuntu 6.06 (Intel x86).

Ot it might set an arguably undesirable precedent
that TeX-Live comes out only in alternate years :-(

I've tried with .NOPARALLEL in various Makefiles, but given up. Their

    here's a patch for the manpage of tex, the program.  

I installed it.

    I'm not sure about the meaning of the
    environment variable mentioned by the submitter.

It's already described later on in the man page, under "ENVIRONMENT".  I
added a ref.

    Somebody care to report this upstream (the tex-k list, I suppose)?

There is no need.

Thanks,
k

Thanks, I'm really busy these days (job interviews, writing
applications,...), only today I granted myself some time for TeX cleanup
work - yesterdays job interview was, well, a little promising ;-)

    I see similar failures with texinfo on Ubuntu 6.06 (Intel x86).

I can't debug it because it doesn't fail for me on any system I have
access to.  It obviously has to do with what
termcap/terminfo/curses/etc. libraries are installed on the system.
Texinfo has minimal needs as far as the actual code goes; I expect the
problem is in the configure madness which tries to figure out which
library to use.

If anyone can debug the configure test (or whatever), or give me access
to a system where it fails, great.  Otherwise, I'm helpless.

I hate standalone info.

The "minor update to XeTeX" has now been checked in to svn; I don't  
expect there to be further changes to the code for the TL release.

I'm sure there will be tweaks needed to configure and build properly  
on the various targets; reports (and patches) are welcome. Note that  
the build system needs to have the headers for libfontconfig  
installed. (I don't think configure checks this properly at the  
moment, so you'll get a compile failure if the headers are missing.)

On Ubuntu 6.06, installing the libncurses5-dev package solves the  
problem for me.

The issue is that no ncurses headers are installed by default (nor  
any other terminal library), so configure can't find one to use; it  
prints "WARNING: probably need a terminal library, one of: ...", but  
continues, and we then get link errors in the build.

The "configure madness" isn't really broken; it makes a valiant  
attempt to find a usable library, and warns if it can't (see above).  
I guess it doesn't stop with an immediate error message on the  
grounds that there may be systems where a term lib isn't needed (in  
particular, dgjpp, according to the comments).

The TL source tree includes libs/ncurses, so one possibility would be  
to use our own copy of that, instead of letting configure find an  
installed term library. But that would be a pretty radical change to  
make at this stage.

It's not clear to me how we can easily modify the texinfo  
configuration so that it falls back to TL's private copy of lib/ 
ncurses only in the case where no installed term lib is found;  
because it is set up to try a whole list of different possibilities,  
it's not as simple as other libraries where we have the option to use  
a system version or our own.

Martin, does installing libncurses5-dev (or equivalent for your  
distro) solve the issue on your system?

Yes. :-)
It's ncurses-devel-5.5 (and ncurses-devel-32bit-5.5) on SUSE 10.1.

I now have 273 entries in inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/. I hope
that this is the right number...

It's the same number as I have in inst/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/, so  
that's an encouraging sign, I guess.

I believe so.  That's how many are in the x86_64 tarball that Tigran

when I'm working on the new Texinfo release next year sometime.

No need -- using TL's curses would be preferable, just as it is in

Well, the library is present, so programs that use it can run -- just  
the "development" package (headers, etc) isn't included by default.

Well, that would be easier to configure. But easier still is to  
install the appropriate headers on the build machine. :)

Message-ID: <B1BD376E-F1D8-4D77-8813-7912FE2FEF09@sil.org>

On my Mac OS X 10.4.7 (Intel and PPC) systems, ./Build ends with a  
link failure in dvipng:

gcc  dvipng.o color.o draw.o dvi.o font.o misc.o pk.o set.o special.o

section (__TEXT,__text)
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [dvipng] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 1


This occurs because there is a hash_create in the system's libm,  
which clashes with the function defined in kpathsea, and the system's  
dynamic libm is linked before the static kpathsea library.

The problem will not arise if libkpathsea.a is listed *before* -lm in  
the link command. However, a further problem then shows up: there are  
a bunch of unresolved references to Mac OS X functions. I believe  
these are coming from libfreetype, which uses Mac APIs to interact  
with the OS font system. To resolve these references, we need to add  
"-framework ApplicationServices" to the link command.

So I'd like to propose the following patch to texk/dvipng/ 
configure.ac (and the resulting update to texk/dvipng/configure,  
after re-running autoconf in that directory):

The effect is to move libkpathsea.a earlier in LIBS, so it is found  
before libm, and to test for the existence of the Mac OS X  
ApplicationServices framework and add this to the link if present.

This will allow a successful build on current Mac OS X systems, and  
should be harmless elsewhere; if I don't hear objections, I intend to  
check it in tomorrow after some further testing here.

    This occurs because there is a hash_create in the system's libm,  

Pretty bad for something as fundamental as libm to export a symbol like
that, especially with no leading _.  Any chance of getting Apple to fix it?
(Of course, I should have called it kpse_hash_create in the first place,
but I never expected kpathsea to be installed as a system library, as it
has been.)

    So I'd like to propose the following patch to texk/dvipng/ 
    configure.ac (and the resulting update to texk/dvipng/configure,  

Sounds fine to me (anything along those lines).  The dvipng/configure.ac
bears little resemblance to the original, so we may as well hack at
will.  Eventually I hope to do our stuff with --enable-tetex-build, as
with dvipdfmx, but I got bogged down.

I'm really glad you found a way to deal with it.

    after re-running autoconf in that directory):

My experience was that autoconf 2.59 had to be used for dvipng; later
versions failed in one way, and the early autoconf2.13 used elsewhere
fails in other ways.  It's a sad state of affairs, but I just went with it.

Apparently some versions of libc have exported this symbol, too; see  
http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2004-February/ 
005536.html, which concerned an equivalent problem but on FreeBSD. So  
it may not be Apple in particular, but (certain versions of) the GNU  
C libs.

I don't think it's a problem provided that the system libraries like  
libc and libm are listed late in the link command. The issue arose  
because the dvipng configure ends up putting -lm very early.

Checked in, after verifying that it builds on both OS X (PPC and  
Intel) and Linux (x86).

Message-ID: <f35545860612081429ua9b6c0ag99eb85961bd6297b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I tried to install tex-live today using rpmbuild --rebuild --force
http://pmrb.free.fr/texlive/texlive.spm.  I noticed a couple of
issues.

1) I tried to build and it failed.  I changed a few things in the spec
file, and then tried to build again.  It started the rsync again
instead of using the gzip that it already made.  It turns out that
someone checked in files to the svn repository during my install so
the version number changed.  Not wanting to download everything again,
I hard coded the old version number into the spec file.

2) It compiled it's own freetype2 even though I have the
freetype2-devel package installed.  The error I saw was: configure:
warning: ft2build.h not found. Using my own freetype2 sources.
ft2build.h is in /usr/includes

3) The build failed.  Below is the end of STDERR output.  I have a log
or both STDERR and STDOUT if you would like to look at them.  Any idea
why it failed?

    because the dvipng configure ends up putting -lm very early.

Yeah, that was my mistake.  Thanks for rectifying it.

This sounds like an issue for whoever maintains the texlive.spm  
you're using. The default TeX Live build *always* uses its own  
freetype2 (and various other libraries), regardless of -devel  
packages you may have; so the spec file you're using must be  
attempting to configure the build differently.

Either it failed to build xetex, or something was missing or  
inconsistent about the initialization files/macros for the xetex- 
based formats. As suggested by the fmtutil error message, check for  
xetex.log and xelatex.log files in /usr/local/texlive/texmf-var/ 
web2c; they may indicate what is wrong.

(As you're trying to build from a snapshot of the development tree,  
it's entirely possible that something was in an inconsistent state at  
the point where you copied the files.)

Yes, that's it; assuming you have xetex 0.996, you need an updated  
version of one of the setup files, Master/texmf-dist/tex/generic/ 
xetexconfig/unicode-letters.tex. I suspect that's what caused the  
failure for you. The new version is now available in svn (rev. 2644).

Hi Karl, hi all!

Any ideas ?

$ gcc --version

(same of course g++)

I can use gcc-3.3 if there is need, but how do I have to invoke the
Build script to get all the configure to use gcc-3.3 and g++-3.3?

I wonder.... what happens if you comment out the line "#include  
<locale>"? On my systems (Mac OS X, Ubuntu 6.06), it doesn't appear  
to be required. I guess it's residue from older code, and could  
simply be deleted.

I suspect you may run into other problems with gcc 2.95, e.g.,  
building the ICU libraries -- I'm not sure if they still support this  
version.

> but how do I have to invoke the

Do you have the gcc_select tool, to set the default compiler version?  
That would probably be the easiest approach:

     sudo gcc_select 3.3

Then Build as normal. You can of course revert to 2.95 afterwards, if  
preferred for other projects.

Something like:

env CC=gcc-3.3 CXX=g++-3.3 Build 

?  Can't say I know for sure if all the configure's will respect that.

Alternatively, make [g]cc/[cg]++ symlinks in ~/bin or wherever to the
3.3 versions so they are found first in PATH :).

Cheers,

A Debian user found that ugq.map is not activated in the Debian

Hi all!

I have build a sarge chroot and I am compiling texlive there, with

But I did find another problem:

terminal.o(.text+0x15c): In function `terminal_begin_using_terminal':
../../../../utils/texinfo/info/terminal.c:152: undefined reference to `tputs'

Same with:
../../../../utils/texinfo/info/terminal.c:236: undefined reference to `tgoto'
../../../../utils/texinfo/info/terminal.c:494: undefined reference to `tgetnum'
etc etc

What am I missing?

I think you'll find that you need libncurses5-dev (or some similar

Yup, this is what I got. WOrking, compile continued down to compiling
in texk/web2c/xetexdir/ where it broke, because I didn't have
libfontconfig1-dev installed, damned.

Restart ...

you need to install fontconfig headers, AND restart the build from

Sorry, it's not; xdvipdfmx gets configured differently depending on  
the availability of fontconfig headers. (And without fontconfig, it  
won't actually build successfully [except on Mac OS X]).

I should make the configure phase halt with an error in this case,  
rather than proceed to configure something that won't build! Some  
day, when time permits....

Message-ID: <2670174A-DC85-43D3-9354-ED2F6D92F417@sil.org>

I thought it might be useful to make a list of tools/packages/ 
libraries that need to be available for a successful build of TL  
binaries on a Linux/Unix-ish system. This is in addition to the  
standard compiler/linker/make tools, of course. A "developer"  
workstation may well include all these items as standard, but  
"desktop user" configurations often don't include the development  
tools or headers by default.

So here are some items that I've had to add to a default installation  
in order to build TL binaries (exact package names vary between  
distros and versions):

* flex
* bison
   - needed to build the web2c tools
   - alternatively, I expect lex/yacc would probably also work

* texinfo
   - required during "install" of dvipng
   - the build doesn't use the version just created as part of the TL  
build

* libncurses [or other terminal library & headers?]
   - required by texinfo/info
   - ensure header files are available, not only the shared lib
   - may require a -dev[el] package to be installed

* libfontconfig
   - required by xetex and xdvipdfmx [except on Mac OS X]
   - ensure header (fontconfig/fontconfig.h) is available, not only  
the shared lib
   - may require a -dev[el] package to be installed

Are there others I haven't noted?

Perhaps it would be useful to include these notes in Build/source/ 
README or some such place, after people have added any further  
comments/missing items.

What puzzles me is that the build process is really messed up at the
end, as it asks for texi2dvi/tex:

First strange thing, there is no ./mkinstalldirs, seems a bit strange

/usr/bin/install -c dvipng /texlive-src/Build/source/inst/bin/alphapca56-unknown

texi2dvi -I ../../../texk/dvipng ../../../texk/dvipng/dvipng.texi

Yes, so it is, definitely.

Ok, so that is what my questions come from!?! Do I have all the binaries 
now installed, or did the install process terminate too early to get all
binaries installed?

Thanks for any comments

(PS Why did this happen: I have a chroot environment with minimal packages
installed, ie no TeX system, no nothing at all, only the necessary
devel packages)

Your list looks far from complete; I get 273 binaries on Linux/i386.

You definitely didn't get them all installed (assuming they were  
built successfully).

I believe you need a working texinfo installed. (You just built one  
as part of TL, but the "install" process that's part of the build  
doesn't know how to use it.)

You might also need an existing TeX installation on the build  
machine; I'm not sure of that at the moment.

HTH,

There are some things that are definitly missing: dvips, dvipdfm(x) and
xdvipdfmx.

    First strange thing, there is no ./mkinstalldirs, seems a bit strange

It is in $(srcdir).  I changed Makefile.in.

    :  -I../../../texk/dvipng ../../../texk/dvipng/dvipng.texi

I re-committed dvipng.help and dvipng.info.  It's not intended that a
working Texinfo or TeX have to be present for the build to complete.

    I have a chroot environment with minimal packages

I'm not sure if attempting to find the "minimal" set of packages needed
to build is really worth the effort.  But maybe with the above changes,
it'll go through ...

  I remember I needed a working tangle installed when I built TL'05 on my
Sun machine (the Makefile couldn't use the binary just output during the
compilation process). If by ?TeX installation? you mean a set of TeX
input files, pattern files, etc., I think it's needed, too.

Dear all,

as you know, I've compiled i386-linux binaries for TL for some years
only because they worked well on many linuces (enough old).
Now I cannot build because I cannot find needed libraries (esp. for 
xetex). So it is perhaps time to switch to somehow more modern (but not 
so much modern) distribution having libfontconfig, etc. 
Could anybody help? Please have in mind that for, e.g., xdvi we need 
xaw toolkit switched on (see Build/source/Build for more info).

Hi Staszek,

I have been (sucessfully) building i386-linux on tug.org.  Our system is
(by design) several years old; I hope that will be old enough to avoid
shared library problems, etc., for GNU/Linux users.

I'll try to check in a new set of binaries tomorrow, so it can be
tested.  (And hopefully make a new test image; have some final tpm
things to straighten out.)

Meanwhile, new binaries for sparc-solaris, i386-solaris, sparc-linux,
powerpc-aix, and x86_74-linux are already there.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Staszek, I'm very grateful that you provided binaries last year
which work on my old machine.  It would be great if you can provide
binaries for old machines this year too.  Run ./Build --without-xetex
on your old machine and xetex can be compiled on a newer machine.  On
old machines xetex will not run anyway, but all the other programs
will.

Version 2.47 will have this patch!

The removal of ChangeLog was an oversight -- but my build system doesn't keep 
ChangeLog up to date anyway.

I have worked a bit on the German translation. But as I haven't done the
former translations (and since I am not very good in translating), I
attach the diff of what I did. If you want I can submit it, or someone

Hi, 

here are some suggestions.  For the German-speaking readers who don't
know me in person: I live in Zurich, but I'm not Swiss...

And from a point of view of typography, it should be d.\,h. or something
close to that, but it should be consistent.

Not a translation issue, but I think that "We would be glad if you would
become a member..." would sound much nicer and more encouraging than
"You are asked to...".

"Weiters" might be an austriacism (?), it sounds strange to me.  But why
not mirror the different flavors of German...

I just ran a build on Mac OS X and got 266 binaries. As there are two  
OS X-only tools (xdv2pdf and its helper T1Wrap), this looks  
consistent with your result. I expect to check in new powerpc-darwin  
binaries later today.

I'll also update and do a new build on Linux, to see what the latest  
count is there.

I checked with the old binaries from the last year and that is the
outcome:

REMOVED binaries (not any longer present):
	dvigif
	uniqleaf

NEW binaries (not present in the old builds):
	ctxtools
	exatools
	luatools
	mpstools
	mtxtools
	pdftools

There are 264 files in inst/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
(binaries+symlinks). 

I'm using a slightly modified Build script which copies the files to a
directory which I have in $PATH unless the build fails.

This directory contains 273 files and I get:

$ ls -l | sed -e '/Dec 11/d'
lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users       9 Dec  7 23:13 altpdfaleph -> altpdftex
lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users       9 Dec  7 23:13 altpdfamstex -> altpdftex

lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users       9 Dec  7 23:13 altpdfcont-nl -> altpdftex
lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users       9 Dec  7 23:13 altpdfetex -> altpdftex
lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users       9 Dec  7 23:13 altpdflambda -> altpdftex
lrwxrwxrwx 1 reinhard users       9 Dec  7 23:13 altpdflatex -> altpdftex

-rwxr-xr-x 1 reinhard users     178 Dec  7 23:13 altpdftex

Apparently altpdftex and the 8 symlinks pointing to it had been
removed after Dec 7.

  Reinhard

    Apparently altpdftex and the 8 symlinks pointing to it had been
    removed after Dec 7.

Yes, I excised these recently after Vladimir reminded me.  (The scripts
did nothing last year but print a warning to use simpdftex, so now it is
time to remove them.)  This is why there are fewer executables now.

As for the previous list of removals/additions that Norbert sent -- yes,
that looks correct to me.

Thanks,
Karl

hi all,
I've just got the distribution downloaded now, and my first attempts (HPux10.20) are running into trouble with freetype2:
> /bin/sh: OBJ_DIR:  not found.
> /bin/sh: OBJ_DIR:  not found.

any ideas on where I should start looking? 
The Makefile in Build/source/Work/libs/freetype2/Makefile
starts with these lines:

TOP_DIR   := /nas/scratch/tiarno/Build/source/libs/freetype2
OBJ_DIR   := /nas/scratch/tiarno/Build/source/Work/libs/freetype2
OBJ_BUILD := $(OBJ_DIR)

Subject: TeX Live 2006 binaries attempt

I just finished (as far as I know) updating the source for various
utilities in TeX Live today.

So I'd like to request all the binary builders (Tigran, Gerben, Norbert,
Manfred, Sebastian, Olaf, Vladimir, Apostolos, Ludger, David, Tim --
bcc'ing some of you in case you're wondering) to attempt a build from
the current sources.  If you don't already have them, you can retrieve
them by rsync or anonymous svn, see http://tug.org/texlive/svn.

Please report problems here, or send me (url's to) tgz's if success.  Or
feel free to check in the new binaries yourself (I will give you svn
write access if need be, of course).  On the other hand, if you don't
remember what architecture you were building, or know you won't have
time/interest to be able to do the compiles this year, please let me
know ASAP.


What is included: XeTeX and accompanying libraries, metapost update,
assorted utilities.

What's not included: the still-coming pdftex update.  I hope it will be
there soon.  This and a relatively minor update to XeTeX are the only
outstanding items (for the binaries) that I know of.

Especially because of xetex and the libraries, it will be very useful to
try a build now, even though it won't be the final one, to find any
problems.

Thanks,
Karl

Are you sure that you use GNU make?  FreeType needs 3.78.1 or newer.

I trust you. I have done my build by installing a TeX system in the

Just in case it's not.... you need libfontconfig installed,  
*including* headers (which requires installation of a separate -dev  
or -devel package on some systems; I have no idea how the HP  
organizes this).

A possible complication arises if fontconfig gets installed somewhere  
that isn't in the default directories for headers and libraries, such  
as under /usr/X11R6 instead of /usr. Some distributions seem to do  
this, unfortunately.

Currently, I believe you can use something like

   --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6

to tell the xdvipdfmx build where to find it, but the configure/make  
process for xetex itself doesn't respect this. I need to figure out a  
good way to add this in (it's part of the big texk/web2c build  
process, which I don't like to touch if I can help it!). Meanwhile, a  
workaround (ugly, but simple) would probably be adding symlinks in / 
usr/lib and /usr/include, so that the files are found.

    I have submitted my changes plus the corrections from Frank to the
    depot, now someone else can work through it.

Thanks.

When I run make pdf in Master/texmf-doc/source/german/texlive-ge, I get
errors, starting with \XeTeX being undefined
(I just used \def\XeTeX{Xe\TeX}, life is too short :), and continuing
with missing $ inserted at 
l.1124 ...reibt \dirname{\$TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
                                                  /2006.
                                                  
\dirname just uses \path, which is supposed to come from hyperref.  It
works in the English version.  (Maybe the german tex-live.sty should
input the English tex-live.sty and then make changes, instead of being
entirely its own thing.  Whatever ...)

If someone could look at this while I work on other things, that would
be great.


By the way, make html failed for me with the current tree on Daniel's
French translation update (works for English).  I'm not sure yet if it's
my problem or Eitan's.  So don't be surprised if make html fails too.

Thanks,

  There's a strange bug with the url package on page?3 of the PDF file
for the french documentation: a URL in the second paragraph of the
introduction has to be broken across lines, and TeX commands appear
verbatim near the break point:

	http\unskip \ 
penalty \@M  ://www.ctan.org.

  The corresponding TeX code is on line 113 of the source file. I have no
idea if it is related with the aforementioned failure, but it's an error
anyway.

  Sorry for crossposting to tex-live; I'm not subscribed to tldoc.

Subject: [tex-live] glyphlist issues
Message-ID: <20061213.093424.85409113.wl@gnu.org>


I've had some mail exchange with one of the authors of dvipdfmx: It
already understands the extended glyphlist.txt format as used by the
lcdftools package.  Consequently, I've moved glyphlist.txt to the
texmf-dist tree and created a new package (glyphlist).

I've also split glyphlist.txt into the original file as distributed by
Adobe and an extension file -- interestingly, this has been slipped
through in TeXLive during an update to recent versions of lcdftools.

Since previously a normal run of dvipdfmx always created a warning
about the wrong location of glyphlist.txt (which might be quite
irritating to ordinary users) I think it was OK to do the change right
now.

Please test.

I've just committed some configure modifications (svn rev. 2716).

For those who have fontconfig installed somewhere other than /usr/lib  
and /usr/include, it should now be possible to use --with- 
fontconfig=DIR to specify the prefix; thus,

   ./Build --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6 (...other options...)

should work for systems where it is installed under X11R6, for example.

Staszek wants to build all binaries except xetex on his old machine
and asked me to adapt the build script so that files are installed
where he wants to have them.  He has no time to do it himself.

When I run configure --without-xetex I still get:

 checking for fontconfig header files... yes
 checking for FcInit in -lfontconfig... (cached) yes
 checking for Mac OS X ApplicationServices framework... no
 configure: tetex build enabled, LIBS now: -lkpathsea -lm  -lfontconfig

What will happen if the fontconfig headers are not found?  Will
-lfontconfig be omitted then?  I assume that an old machine is slow
and I don't want that Staszek runs into trouble.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

Ah, that's coming from the xdvipdfmx configure, which does its own  
check, separate from what I just added to texk/web2c/configure for  
xetex.

If Staszek doesn't have fontconfig available on his build machine, he  
should build --without-xdvipdfmx as well. The xdvipdfmx build will  
also fail if FC is missing. (Currently, xdvipdfmx is slightly broken,  
inasmuch as configure will run successfully without FC, but the  
actual compile will fail. So you don't want to go there.)

I believe that if you run configure --without-xetex --without- 
xdvipdfmx (...etc...) it will not check for fontconfig at all (if  
everything works as intended).

Yes, now I get:

dvipng needs freetype2, which is in source/libs/freetype2.  Is that getting
omitted from the build also, due to the --without-xetex?

Your compile line doesn't mention freetype2.  When I do a normal Build,
I get the needed -I..etc/freetype2.

Ah, looks like dvipng requires Freetype2, and configure didn't know  
about that. I've added a line to the script (rev.2717); please try  
again.

Many thanks again.  It compiles without any problems now on my system.

I get 261 files and I suppose that the missing files are xetex,
xelatex, and xdvipdfmx.

Hi,
The current HP (hppa2.0-hp-hpux10.20) binary is here:
http://www.jtartlabs.com/test/

hmmm, there's an index.html there, try this to get the actual file:
http://www.jtartlabs.com/test/HPTeXLive.tar.gz

compiled with:
make distclean
Build --without-xetex --without-dvipng --without-xdvipdfmx

I'll try again next week if I can install the fontconfig and freetype stuff.
thanks,
--Tim Arnold

Hi all!

I have changed Tpm.pm and tpm.dtd to do two things:
- manage different names between tpm and Catalogue
- update the license information from the Catalogue

This should not brak anything, but we should watch out.

If not I can help, on the debian svn we have a post-commit hook script

You should only need fontconfig (with headers) installed; freetype2  
will be built within the TL tree by default (and I'd recommend  
leaving it that way, as many distributions have older versions). If  
fontconfig is installed under some place such as /usr/X11/ 
{lib,include}, the configure script now supports the use of --with- 
fontconfig=/usr/X11 to locate it.

For Freetype2 (and the ICU libraries, also used by xetex) you do need  
to be running a fairly up-to-date GNU make.

Hi Norbert,

    Is there a svn commit mailing list? 

No.

    If not, can we create one, I would
    like to get the svn commit messages.

I have a cron job that mails me nightly all the commits/log msgs from
the previous job, via the file Build/cdbuild/logs/svnlog.  It would be
easy enough to mail you the output too, if you want it that way.

    If not I can help, on the debian svn we have a post-commit hook script
    which does this.

It's also fine with me to set up a normal svn-commits list, if that's
your preference.  Please advise ...

Thanks,
k

I think it would be nice to have a svn-commit list, with a header set to
list-reply-to: tex-live at tug.org, some people will subscribe to the list,
those who want to,

BUT: if it is only me, it is ok to send me the cron output, too! Only if
there are more people having interest a list would make sense.

So, as long as nobody speaks up, let it be as it is now and include me
into the cron jobs mailing. Thanks.

Best wishes

OK, I've made some further changes to the configure/make setup, and I  
believe the --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6 setting should now work for  
both xetex and xdvipdfmx. (It's a bit messy, as they seem to deal  
with passing flags down through configure and make in different ways.)

I tested building on a Linux system where I had moved the fontconfig  
lib and headers from /usr to /usr/X11R6/{lib,include}/; without the -- 
with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6 option, I see the same failures as you  
have reported, and with it, I get a successful build. So I hope this  
will work for you.

not straightforwardly, because TeX uses the name
by which the program is called to decide which TeX format
file to use, and how to set TeX paths. So if you call pdfetex
as "mex", it searches some extra directory trees, with
polish-specific stuff.

there are three choices

 1. the Poles yield, and call "mex" something like "polishtex"
 2. Matlab yields (when did it add "mex" to its repertoire?)
 3. the texlive-lang-polish package is marked as being in conflict with 
Matlab

does anyone in TeXlive-world have opinions on this?

3. is what is currently happening in Debian and thus also in Ubuntu. 
But this is not the real solution,
because what if some polish mat lab wants to use polish and matlab, and
this is a problem not only for Debian/Ubuntu, but in general.

yes, if the Poles are willing to give up their special name.
Does "mex" mean something in Polish, by the way?

We had licensed Matlab installed in /usr/local/bin. I noticed the conflict
while setting up one of the earlier releases of TeX Live. What I did at the
time was to direct people who'd need TL mex to $TEXMF/bin/<platform>/mex.
It worked here, but might not work at other sites.

Not that I know of.

Perhaps someone from GUST has a suggestion?

MeX is a symlink to pdfTeX only because there is no pure tex binary 
anymore (MeX does not use the fact of being pdfMeX by now).

Sebastian:

Agh, we've got used to it so much -) On the other hand, most of MeX 
users are actually LaMeX users.

Nope, there is nothing natively Polish in this word. Afaik `M' comes 
from METAFONT; .mf sources of polish fonts were an integral part of 
early MeX. Marek? Jacko?

I don't know what "mex" in Matlab or in TeX means, but I generally
vote for more meaningful names.

It is always quite hard to give up something which people are
accustomed to for many years, but I think that everybody (not only
people in Poland) benefit from more meaningful names.

Please let me take this opportunity to remind everyone that the 8.3
restriction is obsolete for many years.  Unfortunately not everyone
recognized it yet.  Excuse me for saying it again and again.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for testing.

I have committed this new version of makempx.c (0.993) to TeXLive.

This version does a directory traversal during the cleanup
phase (instead of only deleting temporary files with known
extension) so that there will be no leftover files with silly
names like "mpW3sE4D.toc".

See below :

The history of MeX
==================

The MeX package has been developed in MacroSoft Ltd, Warsaw, Poland.

The previous version of the adaptation of TeX to the Polish language was
called LeX. It contained a macro file and P1 family of fonts, and was
developed by BJ & MR between November 1987 and December 1989.
MeX is a modification of LeX adjusting it to the TeX 3.x conventions.

The LeX format made use of a set of hyphenation rules originally created
by HK in 1987, adapted to the LeX format and extensively modified by BJ & MR.

The following modifications to the LeX package and hyphenation rules
were done while BJ, HK & MR were employed in MacroSoft Ltd:

  -- the hyphenation rules were further improved and adapted to the TeX 3.x
     requirements by HK in July--August 1991,

  -- transformation from LeX, version 1.75, to MeX, version 1.01, macro files
     and from P1 to PL, version 1.01 fonts were done by BJ & MR
     during the period October 1991--February 1992.

The authors are grateful to MacroSoft Ltd for providing the opportunity
to carry out this work.

It's not my decision, but personally I see no reason why "the Poles"
should have to give up a program name that has been in use for 20 years,
especially because of a conflict with a proprietary program.  With
standard TL, it's not an issue because TL binaries are installed in a
separate tree and users can set their path as they wish, as Kaja wrote.
Distributors mark it as conflicting, and, presumably users will do what
they want.

For TL, I will do whatever "the Poles" want, of course.  I see no
overriding need to change anything.

Hi Karl,

We guys from Chinese TeX Society would like to prepare a Simplified Chinese
translation of TeX LIve 2006, here are a few things we need to make sure:

1. What's the deadline to submit our translation?
2. Is live.tex the only document we need to translate? if not, what else.
3. We need to use the CJK package to prepare PDF/DVI, which requires some
Chinese fonts installed on the TeX system, are you going to produce such
binary documents or we can just submit ours?

Thanks,
Jiang.

Matlab is quite old too.  It does not make much sense to find out who
the culprit is.  And I don't think it matters whether a program is
proprietary or not.

That means that people have to decide whether they prefer TeX or
Matlab.

Actually many Matlab users depend on TeX and vice versa.  It is
absolutely necessary that Matlab and TeX are available at the same
time.

  Reinhard

    That means that people have to decide whether they prefer TeX or
    Matlab.

I assume Debian (or whomever) has a way to allow users to install two
packages even if they conflict, and the users can decide for themselves
what to name the mex programs.

    Actually many Matlab users depend on TeX and vice versa.  

No doubt, but even more Matlab/TeX users have no interest whatsoever in
TeX/Matlab, respectively.

    It is absolutely necessary that Matlab and TeX are available at the

No, it isn't.  I am a counterexample myself: I've been using TeX for
many years and have yet to need Matlab or have a problem due to this
conflict.  Also, given that this is the first time I've seen such a
report and the conflict has presumably existed for a long time, I am
quite skeptical that it is really a problem in practice.


Anyway, like I said, whatever the Poles want to do is fine by me.  For
myself, I see reason to force Polish TeX users into an incompatibility
purely because Matlab decided to name one of their programs "mex".

FYI, this morning I checked in new i386-linux binaries for TeX Live.
They were generated on a 2.6.9-42.0.3.ELsmp kernel.  If anyone can test
for potential compatibility problems, that would be great.  Although we
can create everything but XeTeX on Staszek's older system if we need to,
obviously it would be simpler not to.

I have regenerated all the tpm files and created new test images
with all the binaries submitted to date.
http://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/

I plan to continue updating packages and making other relatively minor
fixes until the new pdfTeX is integrated and working.  Martin continues
to hope that the pdftex release will be made by December 21.  I hope so
too :).

I've succeded to compile all on my RH9 (hacking fontconfig.h :).
What I wanted is that all pool files are OK with those from Akira
(except, of course, pdftex, but I'm optimistic we will end up with 1.40).
Reihard, sorry, I haven't yet try to build (without xemtex) on my older 
machine...
Anyway, there is no need to add platform specific dir, as I expect pdftex
1.40 ready for all platforms for TL.

I like that we have tex.exe too for win32 (not linked to pdfetex), but 
please, if we want TeX Live to be really "live" for so many users, we 
have to change the default
parse_first_line = f 
to
parse_first_line = t
in texfm.cnf

Please, have in mind that TL is for "users", not only for DEK.

Returning to our disscusion concerning separate texmf.cnf for w32, I'm
convinced that we should do it anyway. Akira introduced some more
variables in texmf.cnf (for xetex) which are related only for w32. Thanks
to the investigations made by Jonathan and Akira, such additions doesn't 
hurt the rest of world, but for a sake... I'm going to upload changed
texmf.cnf-4WIN.

I'm quite ready (finally!) to upload checked binaries for w32 (perhaps 
this night:-), but still have some questions:
1. the contents of texmf/dvipdfm/
   TL-svn texmf/dvipdfm/dvipdfmx.cfg
                       /config/config (and config.win32)
   Akira  texmf/dvipdfm/config/dvipdfmx.cfg 
                              /dvipdfm.cfg

2. what is the status of getnonfreefonts? I found that generated one (and 
   on svn repo) is different with that found on Reinhard's site (and on 
   tug.org). What about windows binary: any .bat or wraper made by irun?

3. I decided to keep perl5.8.0 as enough good, small and robust for those 
   win32 users not having perl, but it will be installed only on explicite 
   user demand. I also moved libraries from xemtex to tlroot/perltl.

4. as for Ghostscript, I'm going to add support/gs854w32-gpl.exe which will
   be also installed on demand by tlpmgui. The problem is that it is 
   installed by default in C:\Program Files\gs (I hate that!) and the 
   installer have to make env variables for such crazy directory.
   
Any comments?

Even before Dec. 21, there may be no collision, because
1.40.0 does not have pdfetex.pool but has pdftex.pool, while
TL2005 does not have pdftex.pool but has pdfetex.pool.

octave which is free and "mostly Matlab (R) compatible" also has mex.

No, not without renaming the binary.  There's simply no way to have two
binaries in the path with the same name while still being able to access
both without giving the full path.  Therefore the rule within the
distribution is that packages must agree on a renaming; just declaring a
conflict is only a workaround and not tolerated for stable releases.

The usual rule in Debian is "If no one wants to give up the name, both
binaries need to be renamed".  Naturally, we can't force this rule upon
upstream maintainers, and in this case I guess it's up to upstream to
decide, since the problem is all but Debian/Ubuntu-specific.

If they choose to keep "mex", at least we Debian folks need to decide on
our own (and we need to decide fast).  I assume the decision will look
similar to the "usual rule": Both binaries are renamed, and local
administrators can create a symlink "mex" according to their
preferences.

That is exactly our point of view. (Sorry for voting as all Poles, but 
it seems there are no other Polish voices in this discussion). I doesn't 
matter what is older or more important. Let the user decide, but don't 
simply replace one mex by another.

Poles see no reason either.

Regarding the history of MeX; is was wrong saying that `M' comes from 
METAFONT. There are .mf sources distributed with MeX indeed, but as the 
authors told me, the letter comes from Mazovia, that was the most common 
encoding standard these days.

ACK.  By the way, I just found that there simply isn't a problem in
Debian: octave uses /usr/bin/mex2.1.  Ubuntu is a different thing, they
just use a snapshot of Debian at some point in time, with all its
(undetected) serious bugs...

Dear all!

I think we can finish this thread with the Polish mex staying in place.
Furthermore, ubuntu should update to the latest texlive packages AND
octave-forge packages as there is no mex in the octave-forge anymore.

Hi all,

as it turned out, the mex case is not a problem at all, at least nothing
that upstream (=this list) should bother with.  However, I'd like to
point out one general issue:

karl at freefriends.org (Karl Berry) wrote:

Since teTeX is no longer developed, TeXlive will progressively become
the default TeX distribution for UNIX-like systems.  This means that
vendors, in particular Linux distributions and BSDs, will start
installing it as part of the system, just as Debian and Ubuntu already
do.  But then you can no longer argue with "binaries are in a separate
tree", since it won't be correct for these cases.

I think TeXlive development should keep this in mind and try to be "a
good citizen", in particular try to cooperatively find solutions with
other software developers/groups in case of binary name conflicts.

Regards, Frank

I've found some differences between TeXLive and W32TeX.

I don't know pool files depend on the above differences or not.
tex.ch in W32TeX is the same as that of LuaTeX by Taco et al.,
except for sup_save_size and sup_font_mem_size which are the
same as those of TeXLive. I don't remember from where I got
mf.web. Changes in alephdir and omegadir follow from tex.ch
by Taco et al.

FYI: I do not recall making any of these changes, so if I presumably
got them for 'my' upstream (pdftex-1.40-beta).

Hi Karl!

Do you or someone with svn knowledge why my svn on my university
computer hangs again and again. I cannot even kill it normally, have to
use kill -9, and then call svn cleanup.

Just now I had the same:
$ svn up
U    Build/source/libs/teckit/source/ulong_chartraits.h
U    Build/source/texk/web2c/xetexdir/XeTeX_ext.c
U    Build/source/texk/web2c/lib/texmfmp.c

And then for 20min nothing, no reaction. 

If it helps, the connection should come from generic.unisi.it.

Any ideas?

Best wishes

Norbert

luatex is no good reference since it has no pool file any more (same for mpost .. the pool file is gone)

 Over Christmas days I will test the image on Linux x86 and Win32, if  
there are problems I will report back.

Hmm, I wrote that *new* pool files generated for all programs (except 
pdftex) are identical with those I received from you. svn repository
Master/texmf/web2c/ contains still old files for tl2005.

Thanks a lot. I mean tex.ch only. Since I have only one source

I've not yet seen an answer to Staszek's point, so I hope there
is still time for me to offer an opinion.  Let me start by saying
that I am not /certain/ that I understand the effect of Staszek's
proposal, but what I /fear/ is that it would cause *TeX (I avoid
calling it TeX, becaused TeX clearly couldn't/wouldn't do this)
to parse the first line of the first file passed as parameter
or otherwise read by *TeX, and -- if it matches a certain
pattern -- cause *TeX to behave in a manner other than that in
which TeX would behave.

If this is the case (and I sincerely hope I am mistaken), then
I regret but I have to speak out against.  If *TeX is to behave
in a manner dismimilar to TeX, then this behaviour should be
specified by the user, not by the system.  For example, I could
see absolutely nothing wrong in instructing the /user/, if he/she
wants this behaviour, to edit a local copy of texmf.cnf
(presumably in /texmf/local, or wherever local variants of
system files are stored), but -- IMHO -- it would be very
much against the spirit of TeX, and of DEK's wishes -- for
this to be the TeX-Live default.

If I am wrong in my interpretation of the intended behaviour,
then I will very happily stand corrected; but if I am correct,
then I would ask Staszek to defend his assertion and to shew
why the alternative, proposed above, would not be not only
acceptable but actually preferable.

    I've sent this to you 2 days ago, but no reply, so I guess
    I could just forward it here...

For the record, here is the reply I sent to you yesterday.  Sorry for
the delayed reply.

    We guys from Chinese TeX Society would like to prepare a Simplified Chinese
    translation of TeX LIve 2006

Wow, that's great.

    1. What's the deadline to submit our translation?

This week would be good.  If anything like that's not possible, it can
always be made available online, so it's not that big a deal.

    3. We need to use the CJK package to prepare PDF/DVI, 

We are only including PDF now.

    which requires some Chinese fonts installed on the TeX system, are
    you going to produce such binary documents or we can just submit
    ours?

Are the fonts part of TeX Live?  Ideally it would be possible for anyone
to be able to process the sources using what is in TL.

    2. Is live.tex the only document we need to translate? if not, what else.

There is the small top-level README file, in both html and plain text (I
use lynx to automatically generate the plain text).  Here is the English:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/README.EN
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/readme.en.html

Also, another line should be added to the top-level index.html for
Chinese.  For that, I just need the word "Chinese" in UTF-8.  See
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/index.html

Please send me any files as .zip (or .tar.gz or some such) attachments,
to avoid corruption of 8-bit characters in email.


Also, you should subscribe to the tldoc mailing list, where we discuss
the occasion TL translation issues.

    And then for 20min nothing, no reaction. 

Maybe it was retrieving a ton of new binaries and 20min is not enough?

Maybe try a fresh checkout in a new directory?

If problems persist, I could run tcpdump or something when we are both

FWIW, I just ran "time svn update", and it took 36 minutes (including  
fetching hppa-hpux binaries, not many other changes). Re-running the  
command when there aren't a fresh batch of binaries to retrieve, it  
takes about 6 minutes. This is on a basic home ADSL line (max 2 Mb/ 
s); I assume I'd see better times on a faster connection.

Yes, as you know, I am aware of this, and I am glad for the increased
interest in TL.

    But then you can no longer argue with "binaries are in a separate
    tree", since it won't be correct for these cases.

I know.  I didn't say that.  I said for "standard TL".  And that is true
and will remain true.  

    I think TeXlive development should keep this in mind and try to be "a
    good citizen", 

Again, of course.  Who said anything about not being a "good citizen"?
We'll all try to do what's best on a case-by-case basis.  Which is not
to say that agreement will always be possible.


In fact, one thing in this regard that I am concerned about is the
plethora of executables that are part of tex4ht, many of which have
short (and opaque) names.  I have refrained from installing them for
precisely the fear of path conflicts, but it would be nice to be able to
install everything that Eitan intends.  Can you check the listing at
rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc/Build/source/texk/tex4htk/ and see if any of
the executables have conflicts?  (Even if they don't have conflicts I'm
not sure we should install them, but it would be nice to know.)

    parse_first_line = f 
    to
    parse_first_line = t

Well, I don't mind.  I doubt DEK would, either.  I see I made the change
back in June, I think just because of some offhand comments on the list
that it would be nice to have a pure Knuthian TeX again, as far as I can
tell.  I am a bit surprised that you think many users of "tex" would
notice?

If the issue is MetaPost and makempx, that can be solved in another way,
by setting TEX to etex in texmf.cnf, which I plan to do anyway, since it
can avoid occasional user hassles.


Phil, this is about whether "tex" reads the first line of a file to get
the name of the format to load, as in:
%&latex
That is non-Knuthian and therefore the binary announces itself as "This
is TeXk" when the feature is turned on.

No, you are right. I forgot to check what we have in the current texmf.cnf
and it is OK by me. I'm verry sorry for a rush.
parse_first_line = t 
parse_first_line.tex= f

Hi Akira,

    diff -u web2c/mf.web web2c-w32/mf.web

Ok, I see the version at ftp.stanford.edu had been changed back in June
2003 without TL noticing.  Cool.  Updated TL now.

    diff -u web2c/tex.ch web2c-w32/tex.ch

Ok, I gather we are just removing unused variables.  It doesn't exactly
seem crucial to me to clutter up the change file with such things, but
since you did it, fine.  I installed it.

    diff -u alephdir/com16bit-rc2.ch alephdir-w32/com16bit-rc2.ch
    diff -u alephdir/comsrcspec.ch alephdir-w32/comsrcspec.ch
    diff -u omegadir/com16bit.ch omegadir-w32/com16bit.ch
    diff -u omegadir/comsrcspec.ch omegadir-w32/comsrcspec.ch

In theory such changes should really be made upstream (at least I think
Giuseppe/Yannis/et al. were responsible for these change files), but
since aleph and omega1 are unlikely to ever change again at this point,
and again I assume we're just excising unused variables to avoid
warnings, I went ahead and installed those too.

Thanks,
Karl

Though windvi can still work with bitmap (pk) fonts, there's always

Can somebody try to adapt for TL (preconfigure) CTAN//dviware/dviout

This is certainly wrong.  All format files except that for Knuth's tex
are created with pdfetex and will not work with Knuth's tex.  And I
suppose that enctex is not available either.  It shouldn't be, at least.

  > Please, have in mind that TL is for "users", not only for DEK.

But tex is supposed to behave exactly like Knuth's tex.  This was
Thomas' idea when he replaced the babel stuff by Knuth's hyphen.tex a
few years ago.  It is also a license issue.  It doesn't make much
sense to guess whether Knuth agrees with some changes or not because
we have etex now.

Since tex loads Knuth's hyphen.tex it is completely useless for
people who need other hyphenation patterns.  People who want
additional features should use another engine, etex for instance.
There is nothing in tex which is not in etex.

Well, adding variables is not a problem.  What I do not recommend is
to remove the -sys stuff.  If you cannot distinguish between
getnonfreefonts and getnonfreefonts-sys I fear that users and system
administrators install files in the same directory which will lead to
severe problems with file permissions (as happened in TL2005).  Thomas
designed all this with care and if you want to change anything you
have to be very, very careful too.  Unfortunately there is not much
time for testing.

Regarding different texmf.cnf files for UNIX/Windows:  It doesn't hurt
if they are different, but I'm not completely convinced that this is a
good idea unless there is a good reason.  If you provide a different
version vntex users will be grateful if you set the variable OSFONTDIR
there so that the system fonts are found.  On the other hand I do not
see any problem setting it in the generic texmf.cnf too.  The best
solution however is if the installer sets the environment variable

   OSFONTDIR=%SystemRoot%\Fonts//

I wrote the html file a few hours before I went to Marrakech because I
assumed that you can't reach me there.  Later I uploaded
getnonfreefonts, wget, pdftodsc to the TL repository.  I also uploaded
the wget sources to Master/source as required by the current version
of the GPL.

  > What about windows binary: any .bat or wraper made by irun?

I created .bat wrappers.  But you deleted everything anyway.  Please
don't worry, I will check whether getnonfreefonts is installed
properly in all Master/bin directories tomorrow anyway.

Hmm, please keep in mind that it is not sufficient to run the
installer.  The batch files are still in the lib directory and not
copied to a directory which is in PATH by the ghostscript installer.
At least this happened to me when I installed it at work.

It is much better to have a zip file which is supposed to be extracted
in tlroot.  I'll create such a zip file tomorrow.  You can look into
it and decide whether you want to use it or not.

I think that it is easier for the TeXLive installer just to extract a
zip file in tlroot and you can avoid ugly env vars.

Maybe it was not a good idea to delete all old files in bin/win32.
I have no overview about what is missing now, but besides
getnonfreefonts at least thumbpdf.exe had been removed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have very old windvi (0.67.2) and it works fine on W32TeX with
pk fonts and type1 fonts. For type1 fonts, ps2pk or gsftopk
with Ghostscript work fine to create pk fonts.
You said that mktexpk became to work, so I believe that
windvi is still usable as a dvi text previewer.
For graphics, users will use dvips - gsview etc.

Well, I know all that, and I'd prefer having windvi for TL too, but the
problem is that windvi (0.67.3 we have) cannot cooperate well with newer
GS and people demand to install somehow more modern GS (or have it
already installed). Even on T2005 windvi (with gs7.07 also made by 
Fabrice) opened with an error for preparing bitmap fonts from Type1,
than only reopening it again was succesfull. I can recall good time
when I received windvi corrected even 3 times in the same day directly
from Fabrice for testing, but unfortunatelly it is the past...
So what can we do? I remember that *most* complaints we have received
from win32 users concerned windvi. Of course, I'd be happy to reinsert 
windvi for TL, if we have it working well with any GS. I still claim
that windvi is good and robust previewer...

Best,

hi,

i am on Cygwin and i am using dvipdfm to generate pdf documents with
eps images.  in the config of dvipdfm, i used the following line,

D "epstopdf --outfile=%o --nocompress %i"

but the running of dvipdfm always results in an error, e.g,

contract.dvi -> contract.pdf
[1(./gridpath.1<PS>The system cannot find the path specified.

Conversion via ->epstopdf --outfile=\s3o0. --nocompress ./gridpath.1<- failed
)
pdf: image inclusion failed for (gridpath.1).

and, in my Cygwin system, the command 'which epstopdf' gives,
/c/TeXLive2005/bin/win32/epstopdf,
and, 'which gswin32c' gives,
/c/TeXLive2005/bin/win32/gswin32c


can anyone please help me to get over this problem.

No one - but what I understood from your mail was:  In "standard TL",
the binaries are in a separate tree => there is no need to care about
filename clashes.

This is only true for "standard TL", and "nonstandard TL" is getting
more and more common.  Therefore I think this argument is quite weak,
and I wouldn't use it.

As was the case here, but it seems it's also not needed much.  If the
Debian octave folks can simply rename their binary to mex2.1 (there'll
probably be a mex2.2 or whatever in the future), this seems to indicate
that it is mainly called indirectly by scripts which can be changed.
Therefore this solution should be equally applicable to other
distributions.

The separate Debian tex4ht package only installs

/usr/bin/ht
/usr/bin/htlatex
/usr/bin/httex
/usr/bin/httexi
/usr/bin/mk4ht
/usr/bin/t4ht
/usr/bin/tex4ht

I'll try to do that later, and/or ask Kapil, the Debian maintainer of
tex4ht.

Question here: how does this actually work in all detail?

If I write

pdflatex '&xmltex' file_name

then file_name is interpreted according to catcodes and active
character definitions established by the XMLTeX format.

How does this actually work in all of those cases?

a) &xmltex on command line (ok, I know that: file name interpreted
   according to TeX rules established by format).
b) -fmtname xmltex on command line
c) symbolic link xmltex to pdflatex (or pdfetex)
d,e,f) any of the above, but with a %&xmltex first line?

Note that a) is the Knuthian decreed default behavior, and all of the
rest are kpathsea/web2c inventions.

I do not see any related issues concerning file permission. Simply: we
do not have -sys variant executables (like fmtutil, updmap) for win32,
so having env variables in texmf.cnf caused only a mess for win users
(e.g. while running any program which updates ls-R).

As I wrote you before, I consider all those .bat files from the 
Ghostscript distribution very rarely needed for TeX applications...
We have enough scripts using GS, so I would leave the whole mess 
to the (advanced) users. All in all, the installer have to add 
gswin32c.exe location to PATH, and add GS_LIB env variable.

OK, it would be better to unzip it e.g. in just c:\gs

You mean rather pdfthumb.exe? I'll reinsert it for sake...

usr/bin/mztext						    interpreters/drscheme
usr/bin/dblatex						    text/dblatex

dblatex is an xml-latex converter, the successor (more or less) of
db2latex-xsl, so it's very likely to be installed at the same
time. dblatex is also the name of the project, so we should probably ask
Eitan to rename this executable.

drscheme is an educational Scheme programming environment, but I have no
idea what mztext does.  Well, or rather, no idea what it's good for,
it's just a shell script:

#!/bin/sh
# This script was created by make-mzscheme-launcher

# {{{ bindir
bindir="/usr/bin"
# }}} bindir

exec "${bindir}/mzscheme" -N "$0" '-qmvL-' 'mztext-run.ss' 'preprocessor'  ${1+"$@"}

> (Even if they don't have conflicts I'm

I think they can all be accessed with mk4ht (or however the central
frontend script is called, I always forget).  And users who often need
one of them can copy the scripts from somewhere to their personal
~/bin/. 

Although I must admit that when I first used tex4ht, I wondered why
there's no "oolatex", and I need to remember "mk4ht oolatex" or
something like that (you notice, I don't remember for sure...).

... but it doesn't matter, since this was a false positive:  The tex4ht
executable is called mztex, without the `t' at the end.  The script I
used to grep through the file lists doesn't add a $ at the end of the
pattern. 

Sorry for the noise,

You should only need fontconfig (with headers) installed; freetype2  
will be built within the TL tree by default (and I'd recommend  
leaving it that way, as many distributions have older versions). If  
fontconfig is installed under some place such as /usr/X11/ 
{lib,include}, the configure script now supports the use of --with- 
fontconfig=/usr/X11 to locate it.

For Freetype2 (and the ICU libraries, also used by xetex) you do need  
to be running a fairly up-to-date GNU make.

Hmm.  How does the HP ld want static linking to be specified?

Urgh, I hope Jonathan has some insight into that.

    I tried --without-xetex and then it failed on dvipng, 

Do you have the latest
rsync://tug.org/tldevsrc/Build/source/configure?  Jonathan tried to put
in a dependency so that freetype2 would be built for dvipng, even
without xetex.  

Alternatively, try setting
needs_freetype2=yes
in the environment before running configure.

Alternatively, try specifying
--with-freetype2-libdir=/ldir --with-freetype2-include=/idir
but I have to admit I'm not entirely sure what /ldir and /idir should
be.  ../../libs/freetype2, maybe.

    so I really haven't accomplished anything over last week.

Try to keep your hopes up anyway :).


Cheers,
Karl

A friend tested getnonfreefonts as a normal user though he had installed
TeXLive as root.  He got an error message "Permission denied" of course.

I don't know how this problem can be solved without the -sys files.

If you insist on a separate texmf file for Windows it doesn't matter.

It's a pity that ghostscript is under GPL so that it is not required
to provide the complete package.  Please excuse me for being so
impolite, but I find it quite annoying if people decide which software
other people have to use.  Are you sure that everything works if you
arbitrarily remove scripts?  Some scripts/programs depend on other
scripts/programs.  Do you have a complete overview?

I don't understand why you try to break everything deliberately.

I created such a zip file:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/gs8.54-win32-tl.zip

The directory structure is:

   bin/win32
   gs/Resource/CMap
   gs/Resource/ColorSpace
   gs/Resource/Decoding
   gs/doc
   gs/examples
   gs/lib
   gs/lib/fonts
   gs/man/de/man1
   gs/man/man1

The bin/win32 directory contains all the binaries, the dll, and all
batch files.

The fonts are inside the lib directory.  It is sufficient to point the
GS_LIB variable to the lib directory and you don't have to care about
a font directory.

What I have done is:

   * Put the fonts into gs/lib/fonts.
   * Create a file gs/lib/Fontmap.TeXLive.
   * Change gs/lib/Fontmap so that Fontmap.TeXLive is used instead of
     Fontmap.GS. 

gs/lib/fonts contains the fonts:

   * The famous 35 URW fonts (from CTAN, maintained by Walter Schmidt),
   * Bitstream Charter,
   * Adobe Utopia.

These are the fonts mentioned in the original GS Fontmap but some of
them are not provided by GS.

If you want to test it, make sure that the directory bin/win32 is in
PATH and set the environment variable GS_LIB appropriately.
Then strart gswin32c.exe and type

     /Helvetica findfont quit

Either it crashes (hopefully not) or it tells you where it finds
Helvetica. 

It works for me on Linux and I suppose that it works on Windows too,
both executables are compiled from the same sources.  It would be nice
if someone tests it.

  > OK, it would be better to unzip it e.g. in just c:\gs

Why?  Is there any good reason to remove ghostscript from TeXLive?  
What do you want to achieve?
 
Regards,
  Reinhard

"ccache is a compiler cache. It acts as a caching pre-processor to
C/C++ compilers, using the -E compiler switch and a hash to detect

This should help everybody compiling TL, especially on slow machines.

Subject: [tex-live] oddities with the bbold fonts
Message-ID: <458987B6.8000104@web.de>

Hi everybody,

while comparing tetex and texlive packages in Debian we have found the
following oddities.

Both tetex and texlive contain:

support files and fonts for bbold:
* bbold.sty and Ubbold.fd in TEXMF/tex/latex/bbold
* sources and tfms in TEXMF/fonts/source/public/bbold and
  TEXMF/fonts/tfm/public/bbold

support files for sauter extension of bbold fonts:
* mathbbol.sty and ubbold.fd TEXMF/tex/latex/jknappen


Only tetex contains the needed font sources for the sauter extension of
bbold fonts in TEXMF/fonts/sources/jknappen/sauter.

Therefore simple files making use of these fonts fail on texlive:

\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}
\usepackage{mathbbol}
\begin{document}
$\mathbb{R C}$
$\Eins$
\end{document}

I think the missing fonts can be found on CTAN:fonts/cm/sauter/addons/.
However, I am not sure if one should add these fonts or remove the LaTeX
support files from texlive.

In addition, I am wondering why this is working on tetex at all, given
that we have both ubbold.fd and Ubbold.fd. I allways thought that the
case for the encoding part in fd-files is optional.

Time is running short, so I can't really investigate, but my guess is
that you are using metapost graphics (suggested by the .1 extension)
and gswin32c doesn't know about the fonts.  Pdflatex can use metapost
files directly.

no comment.  i would suggest the fonts are sensible candidates for
optional extras, but i'm not au fait with how these decisions are made.

actually, not really.  the standard is for lower-case; however
upper-case files are accepted as well.  so, if nfss fails to find
ubbold.fd, then and only then will it look for Ubbold.fd for
compatibility reasons, but it won't look for them simultaneously or
anything.  (this is why the encoding file name always comes out with
uppercased encoding in error messages.)

Hi Ralf,

    Only tetex contains the needed font sources for the sauter extension of
    bbold fonts in TEXMF/fonts/sources/jknappen/sauter.

I seem to remember some issue about the Sauter files conflicting with
some blackboard bold files?  Or something?  Or maybe I just said yes, I
should put the Sauter files into TL and haven't gotten back to that
message yet?  Can you check the tex-live archives?

    case for the encoding part in fd-files is optional.

LaTeX probably checks for whatever case is actually given first, then
\lowercase's?  Or something like that?  I don't really have a clue.  I
imagine one or the other must fail on case-insensitive filesystems.
Can we easily fix one or the other?

Thanks,
Karl

Thanks for the correction. Indeed, if I use bbold.sty latex still uses
TEXMF/tex/latex/jknappen/ubbold.fd, not TEXMF/tex/latex/bbold/Ubbold.fd.
Does not seem to cause any problems on tetex, though.

There is a thread 'Problem with 11pt Blackboard Bold in TeXLive 2004'
here (split in two parts):

http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/tex-live/2005-March/thread.html#7774

Here the prolbem occurs when bbold.sty + 11pt is used.

Similar thread:

Right now it looks to me as if Ubbold.fd that comes with bbold.sty is
never used. A simple solution might be to just remove ubbold.fd. That
way Ubbold.fd is always used, regradless of whether mathbbol.sty or
bbold.sty are used. Of course, people would loose the additional design
sizes of the sauter variants.

Well, we wrote several times that the installer for tl2005 had a bug
(texmf-var tree was left RO). It was corrected some months ago.

Simply, we do not have *-sys programs for win32, and all _working_ config
files and all generated stuff (formats, map files, pk fonts, etc.) is
stored just in $TEXMFVAR. That's more simple, understandable _for win32
users_ and more easy to maintain, debug, help people, etc. etc. (at least
at the current stage of matters!). Please note, that we also set TEXMFCNF
for win32 ($TEXMFVAR/web2c), so the original texmf/texmf.cnf is still
untouched to use for, e.g., networking etc. But as most win32 users have
TL installed on their personal machines, we try to make live somehow more
easy (again: maintaining, debuging, helping people), that means: less
directories, less variables, etc. Nevertheless, everything is still open
for advanced users and admins and nothing was removed from the TL's
flexibility, even for win32 users. That's (not only) my point of view.

Reihard, I'm very sorry:
1. You do not need excuse me, as I really appreciate your help, your work, 
   and I know you and like,
2. I'm not going to decide what is installed by regular GS distribution,
   I just install it and use (on win32 Gs is installed without setting 
   PATH and any other variable, please note that),
3. I do not remove any script (or any other part) from Gs. Again, 
   I proposed to install it *as is* distributed (easy to uninstall by 
   standard win32 way), so sorry, I'm not going to break anything.

Hmm... Let me continue my enumeration:
4. Gs is an external program for TL, but needed for some batch tasks; 
   for TL we need to provide PATH to the core Gs binaries and GS_LIB 
   variable, as many our programs use Gs in batch mode, nothing more
5. users can have Gs already installed
6. it should be installed only on demand (see 5.)
7. Gs can be easily uninstalled; the standard installer does allow it 
   (see 3.)
8. batch files and other scripts distributed with Gs are out of our
   interest (I consider them rather as mostly sketches for advanced users,
   even the most valuable for TeX users, like ps2pdf.bat, needs some
   insight and I use it completely changed and simplified); please still
   have in mind that Gs installed natively doesn't add the PATH etc.
9. so there's no need to mix TL+GS binaries and put other stuff into TL
   tree for the above reasons

well, we can organise what we want, only having in mind TL's 
perspective...

Fine by me, but I'm against replacing all Gs standard fonts by our
(still having in mind that Gs is all-purpose, independent program, which 
can be unistalled and replaced by more newer version). I'm not sure if
fonts you proposed (removing btw. all standard ones, as you did, see 3.) 
are enough fine or better :-). "standard" fonts distributed with Gs8.54
contains e.g. cyrillic glyphs by Valek Flipov.

Sorry, my task is to make TL working, not changing Gs.

No, I don't want to remove Gs from TL, but I found a better solution how 
to put in on TL's CD/DVD (thanks to your investigations :-)

The different versions containing cyrillic glyphs by Valek (who, BTW,
has always labeled his fonts as pre-releases) also introduced quite a
few bugs. See GS's bugzilla. All the additional glyphs in these fonts
are useless for GS's use of using them as substitute for the original
LW35 fonts from Adobe. The version on CTAN has the advantage that it is
the original version from URW (ie exactly what GS used to ship, a known
good state) with one bug fixed ('?' in Nimbus Sans).

This should work for testing a build, but I wonder if it might not be  
a good way to build binaries for distribution. Would the actual path  
to the fontconfig shared lib get recorded in the binary? If so, the  
build machine really needs to have it installed in the same place  
that it would typically be found on an end user's desktop. I don't  
know how all this works, though -- if the lib is available in a  
standard location for shared libs on the user's machine, will it be  
found OK regardless of where it was on the build machine?

But that's all academic if you still can't build it at all....

Yes, please send me the full list of errors (off-list is fine, to  
reduce clutter for everyone). I'm not sure why this is happening, but  
am wondering if it's related to something like functions that are  
defined as "inline" in header files that get included in multiple  
source files. Seeing the full list might help confirm whether there's  
a pattern like that involved.

The --without-xetex option was broken until recently (or arguably the  
dvipng build was broken if xetex was excluded), because then  
Freetype2 wouldn't be built. I corrected this in the configure script  
a few days back, so it may have a better chance now (unless you're  
running into a different issue with dvipng).

    if the lib is available in a standard location for shared libs on
    the user's machine, will it be found OK regardless of where it was
    on the build machine?

I believe so.  I am under the impression that all systems search (e.g.)
/lib and /usr/lib, regardless of additional -R (or whatever) options.
Well, I guess it could depend on stuff like ld.so.conf, but any user
taking those dirs out of the path presumably knows what they're doing.

    related to something like functions that are  
    defined as "inline" in header files

Tim, maybe try turning off optimization (env CFLAGS=-g Build), and/or a
different compiler (or compiler version), if you have one available.

It would be nice if you test getnonfreefonts on Win32 as well.
I suppose that it is the only Windows program which had been written by
someone who has not installed Windows himself.

My opinion is that Windows users are not more stupid than UNIX users
and they can actually do the same things.  If you install a Windows
program you are asked several questions.  You can say 'yes' or 'no'
but you do not always understand the question.  A colleague told me
that he refuses to use PDF because it is not idiot proof.  He had been
asked whether to "embed all fonts" but he did not know what it actually
means in practice.  He said 'no' and ran into trouble.  Problems like
this can be solved easily.  I'm pretty sure that almost every Windows
user is able to build a customized Linux kernel.  The Linux kernel
configuration is a very good example:  If you press the 'help' button
you get a detailed description ending with a sentence "If you don't
understand what we are talking about, say 'yes'" (or 'no').

Windows users are not more stupid than UNIX users, all the problems
they have depend on the software (and the installers) they use.  Let
us take Windows users serious and improve the software if necessary.

The problem is that the gs installer for win32 is broken.  It does not
install all files properly.  Maybe the installer for gs-7.07 had been
broken too, but Fabrice fixed all the problems.  He replaced many
batch files by .exe files.

The question is whether Fabrice's programs are still working with
gs-8.54.  Meanwhile the meaning of -dNOSAFER had been changed and
a new option -dDELAYSAFER had been introduced.  I suppose that if the
batch files provided by Ghostscript are available many problems can
be avoided.

A few months ago a colleague used ps2eps and got wrong BoundingBoxes.
I had no time to find out what went wrong but it would be nice to have
ps2epsi.bat in PATH too.  Hence I think that it makes a lot of sense
to install all the batch files.

The gs installer obviously doesn't install eveything properly.  You
break everything if you use it.

Ok, I don't expect anything else.

No, they are definitely not "out of our interest".  You probably did
not needded them yourself.

Of course.  I always have TeXLive in mind and I know that ghostscript
(not only the installer, see below) is broken.

I think that there is a good reason for my decision to provide the
original URW fonts instead of the broken fonts provided by
Ghostscript.

It's nice that Valek Flipov added cyrillic glyphs but that's useless
because he didn't change /FontName and /UniqueID in the font files.

The Type1 specification clearly sais that there should not be two
fonts with the same /FontName and /UniqueID.

The fonts provided by Ghostscript are completely broken.

Please note that pdftex replaces fonts in included graphics files.
What do you think will happen with the broken fonts provided by gs?

OK, I will follow your suggestions and I'm going to prepare the correct 
Gs for TL which can be also uninstalled (e.g. I'll correct all your
.bat files as they doesn't work having LF (u*x) line endings :-)

It is rather the task for TL installer and we're going to provide that.

Please have a look at rev. 2842: support/gs854w32-tl.zip
it contains:
- all .bat files moved to bin/ (but have changed LF->CRLF :-)
- fonts included as suggested
- Fontmap.TeXLive changed accordingly to the same layout as in standard Gs

After unpacking it into temporary directory it can be installed, eg.
setupgs.exe c:\gs
so Gs is also registered in win's registry, and then can be unistalled
by the standard procedure.
The TL installer will do that, and also set PATH and GS_LIB.

That's all what I can do. Now I have to return to more important work
for TL (introducing TeX Gyre fonts, tpm files for new win32 binaries and 
the installer, Linux binaries, etc. :-)

Best,

Hi all,

I have just tried to install texlivetest2006-inst-20061217.iso

I agree with Staszek that you have to be careful not to interfere
with a possible existing Ghostscript installation.

Have a look at the way MikTeX incorporates its own private copy of
Ghostscript: it is renamed mgs.exe, ignores environment variables
and registry settings and needs to get all its configuration
information from the command-line. And it uses fonts from the texmf
tree.

MikTeX's mgs has been a major source of confusion.  Part of the
problem was that the URW fonts were available in a single "legacy"
package as well as in separate packages.  Depending on which packaging
you choose, the Fontmap.miktex file needs to be adjusted, but if you
happen to have ghostscript installed in c:\gs, then mgs would use the
fontmap
and fonts from there because mgs didn't remove the old default gs
library path.  While 90% of the problems can be solved by using the
Fontmap.miktex that matches the installed URW fonts, there are many
people with eps figures that render with gs (sometimes on a different
platform) but not mgs due to font errors.

You can't only think about Windows in isolation.   It is very common
to have multi-author documents where some authors are using Win32 and
others are using linux.  On linux they probably have Valek Flipov's
fonts with cyrillic glyphs as system fonts and being used for figures
and pdf images created outside tex.   We can't expect documents with
figures that can be formatted on one platform to work on another.
What we need is:

1.  better tools to diagnose font problems resulting from
substitutions (Adobe MM fonts used for Times/Helvetica on one system,
URW fonts used on another, different versions of URW fonts used in
different apps or on different platforms, ...)

2.  fixes and workarounds for common situations (e.g, Win32 user
collaborating with linux user)

Yes, I think it is ok for the moment if the TeXLive installer installs
gs on demand only.

  > Have a look at the way MikTeX incorporates its own private copy of

Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment because there are
some binaries made by Fabrice which are using ghostscript already.
They have to be changed if gs binaries are renamed (for instance
ps2eps.exe).  But nobody has the time to do this.

Maybe we can have a more elegant solution next year.  Then I would
replace all batch files and ps2eps to perl.  This way I can test the
Windows stuff here on Linux.  At the moment I can't help Staszek very
much.

  > And it uses fonts from the texmf tree.

I considered this already and wrote a script which produces such a
Fontmap. However, we decided not to use it because TeXLive is modular
and we can't be sure that people have the fonts installed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Daniel,

    No format gets built at the end:

As I recall, it's intentional.  No formats are built by default; instead,
they are created the first time a program is invoked.

    ! I can't find file `xu-bahyph.tex'.

Oops, my mistake.  I'll arrange the dependencies so that they are always
installed.  Right now I think they are just in collection-xetex.

Thanks for reporting this.

As far as I can see it looks good.  If you want to be sure that the
correct fonts are found just start gswin32c and type:

  /Helvetica findfont quit

You'll see on the terminal which font it actually uses.

  > it contains: 
  > - all .bat files moved to bin/ (but have changed
  > LF->CRLF :-)

Apropos, can you check which linebreaks getnonfreefonts.bat has on
your system?

I'm using the file ~/.subversion/config which had been prepared by
Karl.  There is:

[auto-props]
# Some Windows extensions that should stay that way.
*.bat = svn:eol-style=CRLF
       
I expect that subversion changes the line endings to CRLF itself when
you download .bat files but it seems that it worked when I uploaded
the file first but it didn't work yesterday.

On UNIX I usually use "cat -e" to check, it is ok if lines end with
^M$.  If getnonfreefonts.bat has UNIX line endings on your system I
will correct it in the repository.  But it would be nice to know
whether the svn config file works for you.

  > - fonts included as suggested - Fontmap.TeXLive
  > changed accordingly to the same layout as in standard Gs

That's ok.  The reason I moved them into the lib directory was that it
is not necessary then to mention the font directory in GS_LIB.  But do
it as you like.

Does the uninstaller notice that the fonts are already there?  Usually
they are an extra package.

Regarding ps2eps:  I downloaded it from CTAN now.  The version there
is from spring 2004 so I suppose that this is what we actually have in
TeXLive.  ps2eps is a Perl script which uses ghostscript and a file
bbox.exe.  I suppose that Fabrice converted the Perl script to C.

However, in order to find out whether it works with gs-8.54, could you
test it with the following small (39 bytes :) file?

     http://ms25.ath.cx/texlive/testbbox.ps

The BoundingBox should be 100 100 300 300.  If you get another result
or an error message "/invalidfileaccess" or so I fear we have to
update.  I can help you if necessary but I'm away from internet from
Dec 23 (evening) until Dec 26 (evening).

BTW, you can also test it with ps2epsi.

Nice to hear that we will have the TeX Gyre fonts in TeXLive!  I
suppose that next year, when all the lw35 fonts are available in TeX
Gyre, I assume that they will be shipped with ghostscript too, solving
a lot of problems.  I'm sure that everybody wants them.

  Reinhard

Yes, but they have a bug database.  We can place a bug report there
but I don't expect a fix in a reasonable amount of time.  First, it is
unclear which priority they assign to the bug report,  and secondly
they will certainly not change anything which had been released already.

And when the problem is fixed we can probably download stuff from the
repository and compile it ourselves, but I assume that this is more
difficult on Windows than on UNIX and you want to avoid it.  I also
don't know whether everything is under GPL now.  Maybe we have to wait
for a new GPL release.

On the other hand you called the batch files "sketches".  The UNIX
shell scripts are not much better.  Maybe I should convert the scripts
to Perl for next year's TeXLive.

It seems that there is a lot we have to discuss at the next
conference.  I like Siep's idea to rename programs to avoid conflicts
very much.  It is a great advantage to have everything we need for
TeXlive under our control.

  Reinhard

    *.bat = svn:eol-style=CRLF

I checked the win32/a5bookle.bat that I have in my checkout on tug.org
(a Unix machine, of course), and it does have CRLF as it should.

If there are any particular .bat files which don't have CRLF, let me know.

    I assume that they will be shipped with ghostscript too, 

Sounds like a big assumption to me.  We can hope, though.

I liked the rest of your message, Reinhard (esp. "Windows
users aren't idiots"), but I have to comment on this one part.

I agree completely that "we can't guarantee anything"
if TeXLive/bin/<platform> isn't the first element in the
path, but every software package is forced to adopt the
same heuristic, which means that 99.9% of them can never
guarantee anything :-(

Isn't it time that we (by which I mean "we software developers",
although it is a long while since I could call myself that with
any degree of justification) came up with a system that /could/
allow us to guarantee that our particular software package
would run as expected without requiring that our system,
and our system alone, had the right to pre-empt the first
slot in the path specification ?

I said Staszek that all binaries in tlw32bin are purely executable ones.
However I've found that "ps2eps.exe" is an exception. It is a
script caller and it needs perl.exe in PATH and a perl script ps2eps.pl
under $TEXMF/scripts// (or in bin/win32/) .

I'm personaly using GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.56

What version of GNU make?  You have to install the current gmake from
source.  (http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/make-3.81.tar.gz, configure &&
make && make install.  I can do it if you like, given access to the machine.)

I hope that's all it is.

It is the only .bat in bin/win32 having u*x LF EOFs :( I've 
already corrected that on svn repo.

setupgs installs in fact 2 packages: fonts and gs to be uninstalled 
separatedly.
 
The only problem is that both gs and tl have pdf2dsc.bat. I'd rather
remove it from TL bin/win32/, OK?

Sorry. Please adopt the original header in CTAN:

eval '(exit $?0)' && eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}' && eval 'exec perl -S $0 $argv:q' # -*-perl-*-
        if 0;

I've checked it is ok for ps2eps.exe on Windows.

In the case of

#!/usr/bin/env perl

ps2eps.exe tries
env perl ScriptName
and it will say "there is no env in path" on
usual Windows.

Fine for me, I was just unsure it was intended because I saw this when 
checking the log:
Doing post-install jobs from the packages...
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=amstex: BuildFormat on amstex
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=context: BuildFormat on context
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=cyramstex: BuildFormat on cyramstex

    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=latex: BuildFormat on latex
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=metafont: BuildFormat on metafont
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=metapost: BuildFormat on metapost
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=mltex: BuildFormat on mltex
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=pdftex: BuildFormat on pdftex
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=tex: BuildFormat on tex
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=xmltex: BuildFormat on xmltex
the other EXECUTE commands _are_ executed:
    EXECUTE !BuildLanguageDat=ba: BuildLanguageDat on ba
    ...
    EXECUTE !addMap=aifonts.map: addMap on aifonts.map
    ...

I would suggest to delete the
    EXECUTE !BuildFormat=...
lines and to add a message at the end of installation saying that 
formats can be created by `fmtutil-sys --all' if needed. Creation on the 
fly is best for single-user systems, but on multi-users systems each 
user ends up with his own formats in his home directory, I guess most 
sysadmins prefer creating them globally.

OK, I'll give another try to the next image.

Thanks, Akira, it seems that in this case ps2epsi is more accurate.

There is obviously another problem:

In Cygwin there is /usr/bin/gs and there is also /dev/null.

This seems to be more reliable (suggested by Karl a few weeks ago when
we talked about getnonfreefonts):

if (-d /usr/bin) {
   $ghostscriptname = "gs";
   $NULLDEV = "/dev/null";
} else {
   $ghostscriptname = "gswin32c";
   $NULLDEV = "nul";
}

Good, many thanks.  I just uploaded the gs sources to Master/source as
required by the GPL.  Hope this was correct.  What I could do after
Xmas is to convert all zip and tar.gz files in Master/sources to
tar.bz2 in order to save some space.

I just removed it.  This file had been missing in TL2005.  I uploaded
it when it was unclear whether gs will be updated.

I agree, but we need much more time and/or more volunteers.

The main reason why it should be first in PATH is that we can never be
sure that old tex stuff is completely removed.  This always caused
problems in the past.  Suppose that someone has an old tex binary
somewhere but removed the old texmf tree.  Things like this had been
reported several times on the teTeX list.  I don't expect any trouble
if people did not made changes manually and use the TeXLive installer.

As far as ghostscript is concerned, yes, I hope we find a better
solution next year.  We have to change all programs which depend on gs
before we rename the binaries.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <C98CA7DA-C669-4F85-936E-6DFCD26B2441@sil.org>

Hi Karl -

I've just added one more resource that goes with xetex to the TL  
repository: the "font mapping" file tex-text. I've put this under  
texmf-dist/fonts/misc/fontmapping, as it's font-related, but doesn't  
really fit any of the existing places. Please ensure that the xetex  
collection in TL includes this package.

(This "font mapping" is unrelated to "map files" in the normal TeX  
sense. It's the character mapping mechanism used to support DEK-style  
ligatures like '---' -> em dash, `` -> open double quote, etc., when  
using standard Unicode fonts that don't have these encoded in lig/ 
kern tables.)

There are two files there, tex-text.map and tex-text.tec. Strictly  
speaking, only the .tec (compiled mapping table) is needed at  
runtime, and the .map (mapping source) could go elsewhere as a source  
file, but these are so small that it doesn't seem worth separating  
them in that way for now.

I downloaded the latest test image (2006-12-17), but unfortunately 
installation failed on my machine (iMac G5 running Mac OS X 10.4.8). 
First off, I had the following (apparently non fatal) mistake:

Initializing collections... install-tl.sh: line 1: 
P_@=collection_texinfo: command not found

Then installation proceeded, but it stalled at the following point:

Done unpacking.

(I killed it after more than an hour without getting back the prompt.)

Any suggestions anybody?

Thank you all, and Merry Christmas,

Artemio Gonzalez-Lopez

P.S. Before this, I had succesfully installed the 2006-11-21 test image, 
which I'm actually using without a glitch.

live or inst?

    Initializing collections... install-tl.sh: line 1:

This makes no sense to me.  Could the download be corrupted?
Certainly that line is not line one of any script :).
Something like that is probably executed dynamically, but nothing comes
to mind offhand.

    Any suggestions anybody?

Aside from trying to download again, see if the installed tree looks
anything like normal.  If everything seems ok, then run
install-tl.sh --debug and send me the output (there will be a lot).

Thanks for trying it out.

I'm not fond of "misc".  What search path do you use to find these
files?  Could they be in, say, texmf/fonts/lig/xetex?  (I didn't know
that fonts/lig existed until now, but it seems strangely appropriate. :)

Also, a copyright statement should be added, simplest is just this line:
Copyright 2006 SIL International.  [Or whomever]
You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this file.

Might as well mention that the files are used with xetex, too.

Currently, kpse_misc_fonts, as nothing else seemed right...

I'd be prepared to consider changing the search path, but am not sure  
fonts/lig is necessarily more appropriate; although emulating  
Knuthian ligatures is one thing that we do with font-mapping files,  
they can be (and are) used in other ways, too (and future releases  
will likely include a bunch of such mappings related to math  
alphabets and families, for example).

Changing the path would be a one-word change in a single file, so  
it's easy to do, but we'd need to decide before pdftex is delivered  
and the final binaries for TL2006 get built.

Sure, will do. One possibility is to include a "xetex" directory  
level, e.g,

   texmf-dist/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/

(that's actually what we've been using up till now, with the "add-on"  
xetex installation for teTeX-based setups).

Further comments? Would you still prefer me to change the search path  
used?

Hi Karl -

I've uploaded Will Robertson's latest versions of his xelatex-related  
packages, especially fontspec.sty. There is also a new package, euenc  
(Master/texmf-dist/{tex,doc,source}/xelatex/euenc/), which is  
required by fontspec. So please ensure that this is included in  
collection-xetex, or recorded as a dependency of fontspec, or  
whatever the proper mechanism is.

I don't think so, since the md5 digest matched. Anyway, to be on the

The tree looks normal enough to me (its size is 1.2 GB, just like

    formats can be created by `fmtutil-sys --all' if needed. 

I've implemented both suggestions.  Thanks much.

Hello Artemio,

    Initializing collections... install-tl.sh: line 1: 
    P_@=collection_texinfo: command not found

Now I see it.  Turns out it comes from line 100, for some reason.  Sorry
to suspect the download.

Although I got rid of this error, just for everyone's info, the real
problem is, depressingly enough, that there are more collections than
characters in shell identifiers [a-zA-Z0-9_].  So right now the last
couple collections cannot be individually selected.

Short of rewriting the entire install mechanism, which is obviously not
going to happen now, the only other workaround I can think of is to set
up another "subseries" of collections, similar to the "lang" collections
now.  The documentation collections are the obvious choice.  I don't
know if I will get to it.

Thanks,
karl

Hi Thanh,

    is it possible to compress the iso image (eg by bzip2)? 

I have done so.  The live image actually ends up being smaller than
inst, when bzipped.

However, I hope to make a new image in the next couple days, if not
later today, so you might want to save your bandwidth for that.

Best,
Karl

Karl,

sudo /usr/local/texlive/2006/bin/powerpc-darwin/mktexlsr

hangs (runs producing no output, nor creating ls-R files, till it's  
killed). So I guess it's not just a problem with the installation  
script, but with the binary itself.

Thanks for your help, and Merry Christmas,

Actually, after sending this message I realized that there was a running 
kpsewhich process (kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSCONFIG) which was taking 
up a lot of resources (I don't know if left over from the aborted 
installation, or from the mktexlsr I executed by hand). After killing 
this process, another kpsewhich process appeared (kpsewhich 
-var-value=TEXMFMAIN), which I also killed. More kpsewhich processes 
appeeared in succession (--format=map dvips35.map, --format=dvips config 
dvips35.map) and were killed one after the other. After this, I tried

sudo -H /usr/local/texlive/2006/bin/powerpc-darwin/mktexlsr

and it worked! On the other hand,

sudo /usr/local/texlive/2006/bin/powerpc-darwin/mktexlsr

still doesn't work.

I don't know if this is helpful or just confusing, but I wanted you to 
know just in case.

	texlivetest2006-live-20061217.iso.
Message-ID: <20061225143244.GA3400@localdomain>

Hi list,

I find a bug in texlivetest2006-live-20061217.iso, about which, I
describe it as follows:

After I've installed this version of texlive, according to the default
settings, the value of $TEXMFHOME should be *$HOME/texmf*.  So I use the
following command to see the value of  $TEXMFHOME:

$ kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFHOME'

But I get the result as this:

$ /home/zhaohs//home/zhaohs/texmf

Please note, here, /home/zhaohs is the value of my $HOME.  In order to
confirm the reason of the above thing, I use the following command:

$ sed -n '/^TEXMFHOME.*$/p' /usr/local/texlive/2006/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf,
and I get the following result:

TEXMFHOME=$HOME/$HOME/texmf

Obviously, this is a bug of this version of texlive, the value of $TEXMFHOME
shoule be $HOME/texmf other than $HOME/$HOME/texmf.

Fix it, please.

Karl,

I tried your 20061225 (inst) image, and now the problem with the 
collections is gone. Installation finishes one install-tl.sh is run as 
follows:

sudo -H sh install-tl

(I am not sure if, as before, installation doesn't end when sudo is 
called without the -H option). However, a number of important utilities, 
like texconfig, texconfig-sys, fmtutil, and fmtutil-sys don't work, 
i.e., when invoked they do nothing and produce no output, till they are 
killed. Is anybody else having the same problems? (I am running Mac OS X 
10.4.8 on an old iMac G5.) Any ideas how to fix this?

Thanks,

Artemio

You can get the sources via rsync or anonymous svn, see
http://tug.org/tex-live/svn.  Then, there is a (simple) shell script in
Build/source/Build which will attempt to build everything.  For a start ...

If you do succeed, we'd like to include your binaries on the web site
and/or dvd ...

Hi Staszek,
I just noticed that there is no unzip.exe in bin/win32 any more which
is needed by getnonfreefonts.

unzip is needed by the installer too.  It might be possible that the
installer copies it to bin/win32 but in my opinion this makes things
more complicated than necessary.

If there are no objections I'll put it back to the win32 directory.

What do you think?

Hi Jonathan,
there are some non-ASCII characters in fontspec.sty.  This shouldn't
hurt in a UTF-8 environment.  But I'm not sure whether they had been

used unintentionally.

I've forwarded this to Will, and suggested he eliminate them.

And I've reminded him to do this. (I expect he'd do so anyway soon,  
but may have been waiting for comments from a few testers of the new  
version.)

Thanks for the notes,

OK, I'll put it into bin/win32 and add also to texmf/tpm/bin-winutils.tpm
(and reinsert also sam2p.exe for the same package :-)

Message-ID: <68c491a60612261540p19a3ec59j4a5cc8234dccc954@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I've updated the sources to include pdftex 1.40-rc4 (change #2559).

This adds a new library (libs/obsdcompat) and removes pdfetex. It also
changes the signature of print_version_and_exit, so there are many
small changes in non-pdftex programs.

Compiling works mostly, but fails with

I'm stymied by this and don't grok it; would some expert please fix
this? And can we PLEASE have verbose error messages from convert?

In principle there is now no more pdfetex binary, only pdftex. In
practice you can still ask to compile pdfetex, but then you simply get
a copy of the pdftex binary (this kludge should be removed).

The removal of pdfetex prompts some other changes: What to do with the
pdfe*tex names in the bin dir? Either remove them completely (but then
users who have just learned to use pdfelatex will complain) or
symlink/alias them to their pdf*tex synonym. And someone must update
fmtutil.cnf, of course.

PS: My changes to configure* and the make mechanism need to checked by
an expert for these. In particular I'm not sure if autofoo will still
work as expected.

I'll see, I don't remember anything any more.  Anyway, it's usually a

I think we should definitely keep symlinks.

:-)

I know of at least three autofoo experts in the TeX world: Thomas
Esser, Olaf Weber and Peter Breitenlohner. Of these Olaf should still
be active, allthough I haven't heard from him this year...

Hi Thanh,
we already considered this, but the inst image already contains a lot
of zip files.  If you compress compressed files the gain is relatively
small.

The best what Karl can do for you is to use 7-zip compression but the
gain will be only approximately 5%.

Here is the result of my investigations:

  http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2006-February/009770.html

The only way to make the images smaller is to use a better compression
scheme for the packages.

Though a better compression scheme for packages might be desirable,
I think that some investigations are necessary before we discuss it
here.

The only thing I can tell you now is that vntex.tar.bz2 is 11.691%
smaller than vntex.zip.  Maybe this gives you a hint what can be
achieved.  12% is not very much.  I suppose that vntex is not
representative because it contains a lot of Type1 fonts.  zip is quite
inefficient if there are many small files.  Maybe better compression
ratios can be achieved.

Anyway, it's too late to change anything in this year's TeXLive.
Furthermore, it doesn't even make sense to discuss it here before
it is clear how much space we can actually save.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

It seems that something is missing.  If I compile it now I also get
237 files but a previous build provided 273 files.

They depend on pdfetexdir in texk/tetex/Makefile. Will fix this.

Great!  I updated fmtutil.in and related.

Reinhard, the a2ping et al. were a special case in tetex/Makefile.in
looking for "pdfetex".

Haven't actually tried making any formats yet ...

Hi,
I'm trying to run the vntex testfiles with the current pdftex release
recently uploaded to the TeXLive repository by Martin.

Can anybody tell me what the warnings mean?

pdfTeX warning (\pdffontattr): font \^^@ has conflicting attributes

I get a lot of these messages.  The (pdf) output seems to be ok.

  Reinhard

No, it's my mistake, I had loaded doc.sty in ltxguide.cfg that
redefined the verbatim stuff that cancels the effect of the
active << and >>.
Thanks Werner for detecting this.

I have fixed this in latex-tds that is on its way to CTAN.

Hi,

have there been any plans yet of allowing zip files in a TeX tree,
basically treating them as subdirectories?

The central zip directory would more or less provide ls-R
functionality.  As long as one did not have too many zip files around
(basically one for every tree which one would otherwise create a ls-R
file for), the search times should be tolerable.

I've built new TL binaries (including pdftex 1.40.0rc4) on powerpc- 
darwin and i386-darwin, and updated these in the repository, so these  
are available for anyone who would like to test them. I also added  
the pdftex.pool file to Master/texmf/web2c (but have not checked in  
updated ls-R files, so mktexlsr will be needed before it is found).

All formats seem to build correctly with these binaries; I haven't  
done much else with them yet.

Gerben, if you want to try these, they're in Subversion rev. 2983.

Yes, it's strange indeed but it is obviously fixed already.  I don't
remember whether I explained already what I'm doing.  Well, I just
added a line to the TeXLive Build script which copies all files from
the inst directory to a directory which is in PATH if, and only if,
the build succeeds.  The target directory will never be wiped out by
any script, hence it contains stuff from previous builds unless I
remove it manually.

What I sent to the list was the output of "ls -l|sed -e '/Dec 27/d'".

BTW., the files you cited are symlinks.  Last night, after I sent the
mail, I executed "texconfig init".  It looks better now.  texconfig
calls the program texlinks in order to re-create all symlinks and it
seems that this also removes rotten symlinks.

There is no reason to worry.  What counts is what is built currently.

I extended the Build script for another reason, but it turned out that
it's sometimes quite useful to see which files had been removed from a
previous build.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The altpdf* scripts (something to do with Gerben's distribution, as I
recall) should be getting generated by the build at all -- they aren't
for me.  I removed them from texk/texlive/Makefile.in in r2662, after
vvv reminded me that their time is past.  Reinhard, maybe your machine
is finding a different fmtutil.cnf?  Can't imagine how else they are
showing up.

The fact that some of them linked to the wrong binary goes to show how
critical they were :).

$ kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
/opt/tex/texlive/alpha/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

$ ls -l /opt/tex/texlive/alpha/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
-rw-r--r-- 1 reinhard users 5566 Dec 27 05:45 /opt/tex/texlive/alpha/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

It seems that it is not old stuff, at least.

I don't think that my test environment is optimal, there are still
many problems.  For instance, I have Master/texmf* in $TEXMF but new
pool files are installed in Build.

But let's talk about improvements after TL is released.

There is a general rule:  Problems always appear where you don't
expect them.  Seems to be a law of nature.  See also:

in the intended cases it means, that it was tried to add two different
font attributes to the same font dictionary. But here is a case where
this happens even without:

\pdfcompresslevel=0
\nopagenumbers
\font\aa cmr10 at 10pt
\pdffontattr\aa {foo}
\aa abc
\font\bb cmr10 at 11pt
%\pdffontattr\bb {bar}
\bb abc
\bye

Both TeX fonts refer to the same font dictionary. So there is only one
font, and this gets the attribute "foo".

> I get a lot of these messages.  The (pdf) output seems to be ok.

The above source creates the right PDF. Maybe we need to get rid of the
warning here.

In the above case, I also encounter the warning.

Here is the try of a patch, which also shows what happens with the above
file. Reinhard, does it remove the warnings in your case?

An alternative (more complicated) might be that one keeps font

what the typical use of these attributes is.

note the phrase "The missing files are:" - so Reinhard is comparing
current build with his old build. the altpdf* scripts do not (as far
as i understand) appear in his current build.

therefore Hans' reply was unneeded, cust confusing the matters.

and Reinhard's fmtutil.cnf should be current too. these altpdf*
scripts never have ever been handled by fmtutil.

Since I am not part of the development community I don't have the knowledge of 
how one gets to a recent version of the next TeXLive now under development.  
Would someoone be kind enough to respond with the address and parameters to 
get a cvs or svn version of TeXLive? My Oct 2005 version is getting a bit 
long in the tooth and I know that Context, pdfetex etc. have had some 
significant improvements. But I don't want to update bits and pieces 
separately if I can avoid that process.

Thanks for any help.

There is no pdfetex any more, only pdftex; therefore no pdfetex.pool  
either.

I don't know how the -pl pool files are maintained or installed;  
they're not created as a result of a normal build. tex.pool probably  
hasn't changed in the past year, but for pdftex, at least, a new  
version would be needed.

Also don't really know about the .cnf/.cfg files, but I suspect  
they're hand-maintained in Master/texmf rather than being built and  
installed by "make install" from the Build/source tree. The "texmf"  
that gets created by the makefile (in Build/source/inst by default)  
isn't really used as such, AFAIK.

OK. But a "make install" installs a fmtutil.cnf in texmf that  
contains lines like:

xmltex		pdfetex	language.dat	&latex xmltex.ini
pdfxmltex	pdfetex	language.dat	&pdflatex pdfxmltex.ini
jadetex		pdfetex	language.dat	&latex jadetex.ini
pdfjadetex	pdfetex	language.dat	&pdflatex pdfjadetex.ini

So, there, pdfetex is still mentioned. No harm done, I guess, because  
pfdetex is a symlink to pdftex.

Any reason except taste that pdftex instead of pdfetex became the  
basis and pdfetex the symlink instead of the other way around as it  
used to be?

Was libs/freetype2 from the TL source tree used in the build? By  
default, xetex will be linked (statically) with this, so that we have  
a known (and recent) version for its font access operations.

If you inspect the binary, I expect you'll still find that it also  
depends on your (old) freetype2 shared lib; I believe this is only  
because libfontconfig depends on it. AFAIK, it shouldn't matter if  
your libfontconfig was linked with an older freetype; xetex itself  
won't actually be using this.

To see if the binary is basically working, you can first run

   fmtutil --all

and you should get xetex.fmt and xelatex.fmt created (among others,  
of course).

Next, let's try accessing an OpenType font. Rather than guess what  
might be on your IRIX system, let's use a known one. Download the  
Charis SIL fonts from

   http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php? 
site_id=nrsi&id=CharisSILfont

Install the (four) .ttf files where fontconfig expects them on the  
IRIX -- maybe somewhere under /usr/share, or you may be able to put  
them in ~/.fonts/ if it's anything like a typical Linux-based  
desktop. Whatever the procedure would be for making them available to  
desktop/GUI applications. You can check that fontconfig can see them  
by running fc-list; it may be necessary to run fc-cache first (though  
many systems now seem to handle this automatically).

Anyhow, with the Charis SIL fonts installed, you should be able to  
use the attached (modified) version of sample2e.tex, and run

   xelatex xetex-sample2e

to create a PDF that uses Charis (regular, bold & italic) in place of  
CM for the text.

If that much works, then we're probably in pretty good shape.

texconfig has "sort +1", which is not supported by current versions of
GNU sort.  Red Hat has been patching this to "sort -k 2" in their
tetex distro.

info sort says:

"   On older systems, `sort' supports an obsolete origin-zero syntax
`+POS1 [-POS2]' for specifying sort keys.  This obsolete behavior can
be enabled or disabled with the `_POSIX2_VERSION' environment variable
(*note Standards conformance::), but portable scripts should avoid
commands whose behavior depends on this variable.  For example, use
`sort ./+2' or `sort -k 3' rather than the ambiguous `sort +2'."

Friends,

I would like to ask about TeXLive strategy to distribute various useful
software. Occasionally I use `cmarrows' METAPOST macros:

ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/graphics/metapost/contrib/macros/cmarrows.zip
ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/graphics/metapost/contrib/macros/cmarrows/

Recently, its author relicenced it from the default "all rights
reserved" to LaTeX Project Public License. I think there are no legal
obstacles to include it into TeXLive. I am not sure about your policy
(what to include and what to reject). Do you think that cmarrows could
be included in TeXLive?

PS: It could also be packaged separately
http://altair.dcs.elf.stuba.sk/~kosik/debian/dists/feisty/main/binary-all/tex/cmarrows_20061218-1_all.deb
But TeXLive is not (and might not want to be) composed from such finely
grained packages.

Hello Matej,

    I am not sure about your policy (what to include and what to reject). 

I try to include everything from CTAN that is free (as in freedom) and
that is not incredibly hard to install.  (I am sure there are tons of
packages that have been missed over the years, but that's the general idea.)

    Do you think that cmarrows could be included in TeXLive?

Yes.  And in fact, I installed it in the repository a few days ago when
I saw the CTAN announcement and the author kindly sent me the
documentation sources.  I believe it's in the current test image, if
not, it will be in the next one.

    But TeXLive is not (and might not want to be) composed from such
    finely grained packages.

TL follows CTAN, rather than other repackagings.

Thanks for writing.

Cheers,
Karl

    Also don't really know about the .cnf/.cfg files, but I suspect  
    they're hand-maintained in Master/texmf 

context.cnf comes from context.
updmap.cfg I regenerate from time to time.
mktex.cnf (and texmf.cnf*) is maintained by hand in Master.

    The "texmf" that gets created by the makefile (in Build/source/inst
    by default) isn't really used as such, 

Correct.  I manually diffed/synced-where-possible between the "make
install" tree and the Master tree a couple weeks ago.

You can also try wget.  It happened to me more than once that I
downloaded files successfully using wget while my web browser claimed
that the server is down.

If you are on Linux you certainly have wget installed already.
There is a wget binary for Windows:

      http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/

Put wget.exe to a directory which is in PATH, probably c:\Program Files\.

Run on the command line:

   wget ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/texlivetest-live.iso.bz2

Let me say it again:  I downloaded *many* files using wget while web
browsers claimed that the files do not exist or the server is down.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Some compilation issues on IRIX.
Message-ID: <87r6ujf16d.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

Several build issues came up with the IRIX compilation, where I was
using the native compilers.

-- worked around --

* The hardest problems to address are that the headers for libfontconfig
  are installed in /usr/freeware/include, but the library comes out of
  /usr/freeware/lib32, not /usr/freeware/lib, and moreover I need to add
  an -rpath /usr/freeware/lib32 option to ensure the library will be
  found.  The configure scripts as they are today require some editing
  to make this possible.  At present I have no packaged solution for
  this, but I can cope and would advise against major surgery to the
  configure scripts at this point.

  Ultimately, what is needed is two options like these, but for
  fontconfig.

  --with-freetype-libdir=DIR
                          Specify directory where the libfreetype resides.
  --with-freetype-include=DIR
                          Specify the freetype header files location.



* To get templates correctly instantiated with the lkcd-typetools I need
  to use 'CC -ar' instead of 'ar' in two places.


* My build system has libiconv.so installed, and the xdvi configure
  script picks up on that, but since the libconv.so is not present by
  default it must be removed from the link line by hand.


-- resolved --

* To run XeTeX, install fw_fontconfig and its dependencies.


* As before I'm using the motif widgets in xdvi.  These are a default
  part of the IRIX desktop.


* In dvi2tty.c the compiler pointed out a place where likely '=' is
  used but '==' is meant.

Message-ID: <9E8A65D0-4216-47D6-A930-53C61C211FB5@math.uni-heidelberg.de>

Installing a test image (using a non-interactive install command) and  
running tex went smoothly on a PowerPC G5 with pdflatex, latex,  
context, bibtex, metapost, makeindex, xelatex. However, I noticed  
that xelatex couldn't be called from pdftex with parse first line

%&xelatex

instead I had to use a specific shell script calling xelatex. It  
would be nice, if xelatex and xetex could be called by parse first line.

The parse-first-line functionality enables you to specify a different  
**format file** than the default that the engine would otherwise use.  
It does not support switching to a different program and starting  
over. XeTeX is an entirely separate program from pdftex. Expecting  
pdftex to handle %&xelatex would be like asking it to load a Metafont  
"base" file instead of one of its own formats.

(I suppose it could be modified to do an exec() instead of merely  
loading a new format, but that's not what the feature is currently  
designed for.)

I believe this will cause problems, because puts the declaration

not in more traditional C, and some current compilers will reject it.  
(gcc accepts it, though I suppose if one used the -ansi and perhaps - 
pedantic options, it might complain.)

Possible solutions include adding braces around the declaration and  
following for-loop, or moving the declaration to the beginning of the  
first #else in the function, so that it stays before any statements.  
(Though looks a little odd there, IMO.)

I haven't checked in a change to this; maybe you could choose how  
you'd like to adjust it?

Hi Olaf,

    * I ran into some issues regarding the use of 'index()/rindex()' versus
      'strchr()/strrchr()'.  

Yeah, I changed c-memstr.h because including both <string.h> and
<strings.h> failed on AIX.  Fix one problem, create another.  But going
to str[r]chr is best anyway.

    Index: utils/pdfopen/pdfopen.c

Please send the pdfopen change to Taco.

I don't know if dvi2tty is still maintained outside of TL.  I kind of
doubt it.  I even more doubt that detex is.  So feel free to go ahead
and check in those changes, plus common.mk and dvipng (I need to
communicate with the dvipng author about other stuff anyway, so I'll
mention this when I do).

Thanks,
Karl

I compile the sources with gcc and -std=c99 -Wall. Neither -ansi nor
-pedantic catch this case.

I'll add braces.

With gcc 4.0.3 on Ubuntu, using -pedantic (and *not* -std=c99) gives:

   warning: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code

but does not actually halt with an error (unfortunately... it should,  
IMO). -std=c99 (with or without -pedantic) will suppress this because  
C99 allows this usage, but Vladimir's compiler on AIX and Akira's on  
W32 (at least) do not support C99, AFAIK.

Hi Martin,

I've noticed that texk/web2c/configure still attempts to create  
pdfetexdir/Makefile, although there is no longer any pdfetexdir. The  
appropriate section should be removed from configure.in:

Index: configure.in
===================================================================
--- configure.in        (revision 3037)
+++ configure.in        (working copy)
@@ -384,11 +384,6 @@

-if test "$with_pdfetex" = yes; then
-  AC_CONFIG_FILES([pdfetexdir/Makefile])
-fi
-
  dnl Create tests subdirectory.
  test -d tests || mkdir tests

and the configure script re-created. However, it also seems that  
configure.in in the TL repository does not correspond to the actual  
configure script; it is lacking a reference to the obsdcompat  
library, and so the resulting script will be incomplete.

I then tried adding an sinclude(...) line, to recreate configure  
properly, but it seems that libs/obsdcompat/libobsd-compat.ac in TL  
is a little confused whether it should be defining LIBOBSDCFLAGS or  
LIBOBSDCPPFLAGS.

Rather than me poking around further and perhaps making a mess, could  
you review these configure pieces and check that TL has a complete  
and consistent set.

Thanks,

JK

Karl,

I just wanted to report a minor problem installing the latest inst image 
(on an iMac G5 running Mac OS X 10.4.8). I install with the following 
command:

sudo -H sh install-tl.sh

(the -H is to prevent mktexlsr from recreating the ls-R files in my 
.texlive2006 directory, so that they end up being owned by root).

If I change the TEXMFHOME variable to $HOME/Library/texmf while setting 
up the installation options (by entering d and then 4; note that I 
literally type "$HOME", not the path to my home directory), then the 
texmf.cnf file contains the following wrong assignment:

TEXMFHOME=$HOME/$HOME/Library/texmf

This doesn't happen if I don't change the default value of TEXMFHOME 
(the corresponding line is then the usual default

TEXMFHOME=$HOME/texmf

).

I hope this is of any help, and thank you and all the guys again for 
your terrific work.

Happy New Year,

Artemio Gonzalez-Lopez

My ms vc++ does not support C99. I'm moving declaration when
I encounter relevant error message.
static char *strip_spaces_and_delims(char *s, int l) in writettf.c
is an another example.

The changes for pdftex 1.40 are
- a new library lib/obsdcompat, which is used by the sources in
pdftexdir, and has it's own configure
- pdfetex is gone, so the switches for that are not needed anymore

Oh, and I poked at this with the help of Thomas Esser, and got it
working for the pdftex-rcs, but it probably broke a bit when I
integrated it manually into TL.

For the record, lib/obsdcompat is from openssh 4.3, from which pdftex
inherits a problem with configure's test for strsep when using C99
(strsep is not in C99, but somehow shows up when using  "gcc -std=c99"
anyway).

The configure in libs/obsdcompat doesn't find strsep, but the compile
fails, at least for i386, apparently because "gcc -std=c99" provides
an inlined version.   Google "folklore" is to edit config.h to change
"#undef HAVE_STRSEP" to "#define HAVE_STRSEP 1".

<http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-c99.html>
says: "Peter Seebach has been a member of the ISO C standards
committee since late 1996. He is only a little bitter that strsep()
didn't make it into C99, and tends to use it anyway out of spite."

I reported the problem to the openssh people, but I don't think anyone
followed up.

Not if you have to take on extra maintenance.  Didn't 4allTeX try
that? On *n*x you can assume that emacs, perl, ghostscript, ruby, etc.
are available thru the system package management, or in extreme cases
(e.g., legacy RISC machines) can be built outside TL.

One of the lessons from MikTeX is that you have to watch out for
defaults: mgs still has default library path "c:\gs.." which caused
different behaviour depending on whether the user had some (possibly
old, since recent versions install into "Program Files") install in
C:\gs.
This means mucking with the gs build system, not simplying renaming files.

On *n*x there are well-known and widely used configure and built tools
and procedures.  For Win32 you end up with a mix of home-grown build
systems and attempts to adapt *n*x tools that only make things harder.

Many people who have never heard of TeX need a functioning
ghostscript.  From my experiences with pdf2ps, many Win32 users have
difficulties with the command-line tools.  WinEDT provides replacement
for some gs scripts (as both batch files and macros).

It isn't realistic for TL to provide a robust command-line environment
for Win32.  The GNUWin32 project (on sourceforge) does try to provide
comand-line tools to Win32, with qualified success.  For many users,
editor macros can reduce the need for command-line tools.

I added the lines

skakf10         public          skak
skakf10b        public          skak

to the file:
 /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/special.map

and then removed the folder:
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/skak

Well, it worked. But i do not know why. I would like to ask, which of the two things, 
helped?

Thanks

Claus Behl

Hi Claus,

     /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/special.map

I added the skak fonts (there are a few others) to the master version of
that file.

    and then removed the folder:
    /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/skak

    But i do not know why. I would like to ask, which
    of the two things, helped?

There should have been no need to remove the tfm files.  Presumably they
just got recreated.  The special.map change should not really have been
necessary either, because the fonts should still have been generated,
just not put in quite the right directory.  Without seeing the actual
error messages, it's hard to say more.  Doubt it's worth going further.

By the way, as I understand it, the package skaknew has Type1 versions
of the fonts and modified (improved?) macros, etc.

Best,
Karl
