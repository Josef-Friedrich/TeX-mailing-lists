There are three files in /usr/include/fontconfig, fcfreetype.h,
fcprivate.h, and fontconfig.h 

A few weeks ago I updated my system and have fontconfig-2.3.2 now.
With this version xetex compiles without problems.

When I try --without-xdvipdfmx I still get
xetex compiled.  Hence I assume that the header files are ok.

I suppose that it is possible to rely on a shared library because this
is what Acroread actually does.  There is only one AR binary for
all linux distributions.  And the problems I encountered so far had
been at build time.

  Reinhard

Acroread is not linked against fontconfig, as far as I can see.

$ ldd /usr/local/share/Acrobat7.08/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread|grep fontconfig
  libfontconfig.so.1 => /emul/linux/x86/usr/lib/libfontconfig.so.1 (0xf77db000)

If you don't have fontconfig installed you can use strace to find out
whether it looks for fontconfig.  If fontconfig is absent it scans the
X11 font directories.  Older versions than AR7 will certainly not use
fontconfig.

  Reinhard

Right.  I had acrobat 5.

Anyway, I think it would be better/safer to link in fontconfig
statically, just as we do with almost everything else.  I am not
convinced that just because acrobat uses the .so that it won't cause
problems for us.

Of course, it might not be feasible, but all we can do is what we can do ...

Hi Karl!

I have worked through some packages and updated it. But before making
the svn commit I wanted to check with you whether you consider what I
did ok. I attach svn status output.

Not I also fixed the ctan2tl script as MAKEpgf needed a different fix
now, as there is an additional directory generic in the doc hierachy of
the orgiginal sources.

Please tell me what you think and I upload the stuff, maybe I did
something wrong. After this I will continue with updates ...

Some of the packages I didn't update as there were problems those which
are still open.

Best wishes

Norbert

Subject: [tex-live] [OT] chroot'ed texlive installation
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610021024350.8506@gloin.imf.au.dk>


has anyone any experiences setting up a chroot'ed texlive installation?

I basically need one for a wiki-like application. I need to use a 
chroot'ed installation because the server should be able to compile user 
uploaded files (that's the only way we can be sure that the user has 
uploaded everything needed for this particular article).

I just don't know how to figure out which system components that needs to 
be available in the chroot or how one figures this out.

any ideas?

Some limited version of TeX is available at http://tex.mendelu.cz/ (in
Czech only). I do not know how it works internally, you can try to ask
its author Jan Prichystal, jprich AT pef.mendelu.cz

That does not mean that acroread is linked against fontconfig directly
since ldd goes recursively through the libraries. Something like objdump
or readelf is more reliable. In particular, 

$ readelf -d /usr/lib/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread | grep NEEDED

does not list fontconfig. It does list libgdk-x11-2.0.so, though, which
in turn gives

$ readelf -d /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so | grep fontconfig
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libfontconfig.so.1]

I guess if one would build gdk without fontconfig support, then 'ldd
acroread' would not list fontconfig.

What's really annoying was acroread's habit to scan ~/fonts, which took
over a minute on my system. Fortunately that cn be changed in the
startup shell script.

If you do that, please make it a configure option. The reason is, with
statically linked libraries, security support in big distros such as
Debian is a nightmare, because when there is a security problem in such
a library, we, Debian maintainers, have to:

  1) find every single program that is statically linked with it;
  2) check whether the statically linked version suffers from the
     security problem;
  3) if yes, patch it (which may be tricky because the available patches
     don't necessarily apply to the particular version of the library
     that was statically linked with); then, test and upload.

With dynamically linked libraries, you fix the security problem once in
the library pacakge, and you're done. The only thing needed is for the
admin to restart any program linked to the updated library (which also
has to be done with statically linked libraries, anyway).

    I just don't know how to figure out which system components that needs to

    any ideas?

My idea would be to run  awk '{print $1}'  on all the scripts and get a
start at the commands needed that way.  There will also be bunches of
system libraries, maybe some semi-auto process can run ldd on the list
of cmds and copy in the libs ...

When/If you succeed, this is something which would be really worthwhile
to take a little extra time and do a clear write-up on, as an article
for TUGboat (and/or wherever), or at least a web page.  Others have

    I have worked through some packages and updated it. 

Fantastic!

    I attach svn status output.

It seems ok.  But in the future, please update/commit one package at a
time, ok?  That makes it easier to track down any problems.
(And also makes problems less likely.)

Oh, I just noticed the very last line:
M      Master/texmf-dist/bibtex/bib/babelbib/babelbibtest.bib

I haven't looked, but this should probably be kept in the
source/latex/babelbib or doc/latex/babelbib dirs, it's probably not
useful for actual users.  (See the specialbib hash in ctan2tds.pl.)

    Not I also fixed the ctan2tl script as MAKEpgf needed a different fix

You mean ctan2tds.pl, I assume.  I'm not surprised.  This kind of thing
is the bane of our existence.

    Some of the packages I didn't update as there were problems those which
    are still open.

Let me know ...

Hi,

I want to call some executable, preloading a format and running a
file that might contain spaces in the file name.

latex &format "file name with spaces"

does not work whereas

latex "file name with spaces"

would actually work, but not preload a format.

In a similar vein,

latex "&format name with spaces"

does not work.

And for dumping a format based on LaTeX, neither

latex -ini "&latex" "file name with spaces"

nor

latex -ini -fmtname latex "file name with spaces"

will work.  The first fails because of the spaces, the second does not
bother to preload latex.fmt.

This is not all too convincing and/or consistent.

I think that ampersand is the source of problem because it has special
meanings in various shells and must be escaped. Some shell would
require latex \&format ...
The standard shell in OS/2 requires latex ^&format ...
Look into the manual of your shell.

No, no.  I am not that stupid, I just forgot the quotes in the
posting.

latex "&format" "file name with spaces"

is what will not work in the described manner.

OK, I'll test, but your scenario reads oddly to me :
why would you use the verb "LaTeX", which explicitly
loads the LaTeX format, when you want to load another
format ?  Would it not be more sensible to invoke it
as "TeX" which (provided that the implementation hasn't
meddled) will invoke Virtex by default, and Initex if
a suitable switch (e.g., "/I", "-ini", etc) is provided ...

Because I want to use something like "mylatex.ltx" in order to shorten
the load time, while still getting the search paths and, necessarily,
executable used by LaTeX itself.

This gives a different search path and a different executable than the
"latex" command.  Useless.

This

pdfetex --fmt=latex "file with spaces.tex"

works for me. I have not tested this with other formats, though, and it
doesn't work with -ini. This variant seems to work with or without -ini:

pdfetex -ini '&latex \input{"file with spaces"}'

Not extensivley tested.

This, however, is not backwards compatible, and I have some doubts
that

latex """foo bar"""

(namely used without a format specifier) would work.

There does not seem much consistency here.

I don't see why you have redirected this to the TeXhax mailing list,
since it was a question about TeXlive.  I am putting this back to the
TeXlive mailing list instead.

Please don't revert this thread to TeXhax without even mentioning
this.  I posted it as a question on the TeXlive list, and it is there
that it belongs.

Posted back to TeXlive.

I should be surprised if "TeX" launches PdfeTeXK: that does not sound
compatible with Knuth's wishes at what may be called "TeX".

It doesn't here.  Are you sure you are using TeXLive 2005?

Different executable names will still lead to different search paths
and possible different configurations.

Probably because I thought that was where I had first seen the

I did not claim they were.  Without "&format", this will work.

It is nothing that earlier LaTeX versions will like (and of course, it
uses the wrong search paths for TeX input files): I am trying to
figure out a way to call LaTeX from AUCTeX, a TeX shell with minimum
likelihood of failure.

Of course, if failure is unavoidable, it will be ok to cause it.

Cannot the search path be adjusted by using an additional -progname
switch?

Yes, they are. The problem was with the xdvipdfmx configure script,  
and was masked on my system by the presence of libkpathsea as an  
installed library. I was able to reproduce the failure on a "clean"  
machine.

I have checked in a fixed configure script, so I believe xdvipdfmx  
should now build for you (let me know if it still doesn't).

Both xetex and xdvipdfmx will require the fontconfig library (with  
headers) installed in order to build. I tried building xetex with a  
private static copy of fontconfig some time back, and the results  
were not encouraging (didn't seem to find the fonts that the system's  
installed fontconfig could find), but I'll look into this again;  
maybe I did something wrong at that time.

In other news: in order to build TL on a fresh Ubuntu system, I had  
to install the libncurses5-dev package, which surprised me, as we  
have /libs/ncurses in the TL tree. But without the -dev package  
installed, I get errors building texinfo. I don't plan to investigate  
this at the moment, though.

It is still a guess what binary might correspond to format usually.
If you guess wrong, you'll get a fatal format file error.  I don't see
that `etex \&latex' is better than `latex \&latex' in any case.

I am not sure why Reinhard used 'etex' on the commandline. I used
pdfetex in my examples just to make sure that the &latex trickery works
and the format is loaded because of it and not because of the binary's
name. However, something like

latex '&latex "file with spaces"'

works here as well. And I expect it to work also with other formats. At
least 

latex '&pdflatex "file with spaces"'

produces a PDF file, though it does not find the map file since progname
is not set correctly.

I'll probably use some variant of that.  I think it will only fail on
those latex versions where anything else would fail as well.

Subject: [tex-live] linking with fontconfig (xetex and xdvipdfmx)
Message-ID: <335B3F87-C446-4A66-AF57-3FE764793DD9@sil.org>

I have been looking into the issue of linking with fontconfig, which  
xetex and its output driver xdvipdfmx both use to locate "installed"  
fonts on the host system. (This ability to directly "see" and use the  
same fonts as mainstream GUI applications, with no special conversion/ 
configuration/installation for TeX use, is one of the xetex features  
that many users find very attractive.)

Currently, xetex and xdvipdfmx are dynamically linked with  
libfontconfig, which means that the fontconfig headers and library  
must be present at build time, and /usr/lib/libfontconfig.so must be  
present at runtime. This is in contrast to other libraries, where (by  
default) we build and (statically) link entirely within TL, so there  
is no runtime dependency.

I've been wondering if it would be good to treat fontconfig in this  
same way, but have been concerned that it could lead to problems.  
Fontconfig is in effect the "bridge" between xetex and the user's  
desktop "world" of fonts, and if xetex is not using the same  
fontconfig library as the desktop applications, the resulting  
mismatch in behavior will be confusing and frustrating. For example,  
if a distributor has customized the location of fontconfig's primary  
configuration files in their build, only their library will know  
about this, and a private version built as part of TL will not access  
the same configuration.

I don't know whether distributors do ever change the location of  
fonts.conf in their build, but it is surely possible -- just as  
likely, perhaps, as changing the installed location of  
libfontconfig.so, which of course could prevent TL's xetex and  
xdvipdfmx binaries from running.

A more serious issue, though (in that it will *definitely* be a  
problem if we static-link libfontconfig) is that fontconfig relies on  
cache files that it builds in each font directory. Looking at the  
fontconfig documentation and release notes, I have realized that  
these cache files are *not* necessarily compatible across fontconfig  
versions. The newly-released version 2.4 has changed the version  
number (and default name) from that used by version 2.3.x.

It is inevitable, then, that if we static-link with libfontconfig,  
there will be users for whom the TL programs don't work because they  
don't use the right cache files. To make things at all usable, we'd  
have to provide TL-specific versions of the fontconfig utilities such  
as fc-list, fc-match, fc-cache, to work with "our" caches which might  
be different from those used by everything else on the system -- and  
the benefit of integration with the desktop world of fonts would be  
gone.

(Some time ago, I did try building a version of xetex with a static  
"private" copy of libfontconfig, and the resulting binary did not  
work correctly -- it was unable to find the "installed" fonts as  
expected. At the time, I did not investigate this further, but I  
suspect that a cache file version mismatch may have been the reason.)

I therefore suggest that xetex and xdvipdfmx should *not* use a  
static fontconfig library; they should continue to link with /usr/lib/ 
libfontconfig.so (or equivalent on other OS's).

Comments welcome!

    were not encouraging (didn't seem to find the fonts that the system's  
    installed fontconfig could find), but I'll look into this again;  

Sigh.  Nothing's ever easy.

    have /libs/ncurses in the TL tree. But without the -dev package  
    installed, I get errors building texinfo. I don't plan to investigate  

Texinfo does not attempt to use curses from the TL tree, as I've never
cared enough to configure that in.  It should work with virtually any
system curses or termcap or whatever.

(Personally, it's not clear to me that including Texinfo in TL serves
much if any purpose, but when I suggested removing it others didn't like
the idea, so fine, whatever ...)

Thanks,

Hi Jonathan,

    I therefore suggest that xetex and xdvipdfmx should *not* use a  
    static fontconfig library

Ok, given your experiments, that seems inevitable.  Thanks for all the
careful testing, of course.

So here is my next question: what version of fontconfig should we build
the TL binaries with, to maximize the chance of it working on users'
systems?

For example, tug.org has only libfontconfig.so.1[.0.4].  It is a
supported red hat enterprise release, fully patched, so it's not just a
matter of being out of date.  But I surmise that linking the binary
against FC1 might make things fail when the user only has FC2, given the
major version change.  Or did they actually manage to keep things
backward compatible?

And I would surmise that linking against FC2 will fail on machines with
only FC1 installed.

Wdyt?

Thanks,
karl

I don't think it is just a matter of putting the new primitives to
sleep for Knuth: he probably does not want to get flagged for bugs he
did not create himself.

Ok, no problem. I just remembered the updated from p4 times when there
was "updated foo bar baz ..." ;-) Next time one by one.

But then, I did all this while sitting on a train from Florence to
Vienna, so Ihad loads of time ... and I like svn for this, with p4 this
wasn't possible at all. 

I will try to do the stuff one by one, but if I do a bunch on a train,
it will be like the above one.

I have moved the file to doc/latex/babelbib and removed the
bibtex/bib/babelbib directory.

For the specialbib hash: No idea what it is doing? Can I give special
locations for special files ?!?!? Can you fix this?

Well .. When I run tpm-ctan-check --check I get output/problems with:
# texmf-dist/tpm/active-conf.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/amscls.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/amsmath.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/beebe.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/ethiop.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/labelcas.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/oberdiek.tpm
# texmf-dist/tpm/screenplay.tpm

Furthermore, note that I have commented powerdot-doc-vn in tpm-can-check
as it always broke on my system.

And added a "exit 1" to the MAKEbeebe.

If you can take a look at these packages that would be great.

What about new packages? I think it is better when you care for them. I
can do the update stuff.

i don't think that was the question.  rather, is there a format
specification, like (for example) the  heavily-commented dtd for the
tex catalogue?

fwiw, i find tpm files moderately easy to understand, but i would not
be surprised to learn there are subtle features i'm missing.

Doesn't matter; anything in the 2.2.x - 2.4.x range seems to be OK.  
See below.

The numbering here is a bit confusing (to me, at least).

AFAICT, all fontconfig releases (so far) are considered some form of  
"fontconfig 1", and this is reflected in package names such as  
"libfontconfig1" seen in some Linux distros. (I don't know what RHEL  
calls the package.) The version on tug.org appears to be 2.2.3; you  
can find these definitions in /usr/lib/fontconfig/fontconfig.h:

   #define FC_MAJOR        2
   #define FC_MINOR        2
   #define FC_REVISION     3

A call to FcGetVersion() confirms that this is the installed library  
version. (Yes, I just checked.)

However, there have been numerous releases in several "series", with  
the 2.2 series being oldish but still widespread at this point on  
older distributions; 2.3 was the current stable series until very  
recently; and 2.4 has just appeared.

I'm not sure if there have been new APIs added through the course of  
these releases, but at least for the basic APIs (that xetex is  
using), they remain binary-compatible. So for example, a binary built  
on my Ubuntu 6.06 system with FC 2.3.2 runs fine on tug.org using FC  
2.2.3. (The reverse should also be true, though I haven't tested it.)

Conclusion: it's fine to build the binaries with fontconfig 2.2.0 or  
newer, which seems to be the first stable release under that package  
name. (There was "fcpackage" before that, and some fontconfig-2.1.x  
dot releases leading up to the first "stable" 2.2 release; I haven't  
looked into compatibility that far back.) Users may see runtime  
performance improvements if they have more recent versions of the  
library, but the binaries should work with any release.

[All this is in the context of GNU/Linux. I assume the same will hold  
on other Unix-ish/X11 systems, provided libfontconfig is dynamically  
linked. On Mac OS X, we don't use fontconfig at all; fonts are  
managed through Apple Type Services instead. On Windows, Akira builds  
binaries that use fontconfig (static-linked, I believe, but the  
situation is different because it's not a normal part of the system's  
font management). A truly "native" Windows version, if/when it  
appears, may use a different approach.]

Debian also only has libfontconfig.so.1.  Sarge has 1.0.4, etch will
have 1.1.0.  But since the soname didn't change, a binary that's
dynamically linked against 1.0.4 should work with 1.1.0 as well.  I
think being conservative gives the greatest chance of being compatible. 

How ist that all going to work on Windows?

This is the so-called SONAME (because it's the file
$libdir/libfontconfig.so.1 that is searched for by the dynamic
linker/loader at runtime).  The fact that it is always 1 indicates that
the ABI is backwards-compatible, i.e. any program linked against
fontconfig headers of that SONAME version can be used with
libfontconfig.so.1, as long as the library version is at least the same
as used during linking.

The library version (the 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4) is just a release version
number for the tarball like linux' 2.6.18 or TeXlive's 2005.  Of course,
besides improvements in performance or standard-conformance, new
functions may have been added to the API, therefore you can't use an
older version than the one that provides the symbols you want to use,
and this is where you need to check for at build-time *and* at run time.
It depends on the symbols you use, not on which were available in the
version you build against.

[Rest snipped with approval.]

Before rushing off to adopt and use libfontconfig, please remember
that it is not universally available on Unix systems.

I just surveyed a couple of dozen different Unix platforms, and found
that it is available in /usr/lib on these

	Cygwin on Windows XP	IA-32
	GNU/Linux		AMD64, IA-32, IA-64, MIPS, SPARC (Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat, SuSE)
	GNU/Linux		PowerPC (Gentoo Base System version 1.12.4)
	Solaris 9 and 10	SPARC and IA-32

and absent from these

	FreeBSD 5.0 and 6.1	IA-32
	GNU/Linux		PowerPC (Yellow Dog Linux release 2.3 (Dayton))
	HP-UX			IA-64 and PA-RISC
	IRIX 6.5		MIPS
	Mac OS X		PowerPC and EM64T
	NetBSD 1.6		IA-32
	NetBSD 3.0		VAX
	OpenBSD	3.5		VAX
	OpenBSD	3.9		IA-32
	OSF/1 4.0		Alpha
	Solaris 7 and 8		SPARC

Given that there are scores of GNU/Linux distributions, there may well
be others that fail to provide libfontconfig.

I have installed it myself in /usr/local/lib on several of our
platforms, but not all.  As list members have commented on, this
raises a potential mess of version dependence.  If a config file is in
/usr/, I have about about a hundred systems that need to be updated.
If it is /usr/local, a single copy can be shared across all operating
systems, or at least across architectures.

It's in xbase, which installs it in /usr/X11R6/lib/

It comes as an so.3.0, but is 2.2.2. Current (4.0) has 2.3.2

Martin Schr?der reports about libfontconfig on OpenBSD:

Thanks for that news.

I checked on my *BSD systems here, and find it there in FreeBSD 5.0
and 6.1 on IA-32, NetBSD 3.0 on VAX, OpenBSD 3.9 on IA-32.  It is
completely absent from NetBSD 1.6 on IA-32 (which otherwise has 117
libraries in /usr/X11R6/lib) and OpenBSD 3.5 on VAX (I checked the
entire filesystems with the locate command).

My experiments suggest that you can expect to find libfontconfig on
many recent systems, but certainly not on older ones.  The HP-UX
systems I tested are current O/S levels; I no longer have access to an
IBM AIX system to check there.

True. But I would hazard a guess that it is commonly installed on  
systems used as graphical desktop workstations, running current text-  
and font-rich application software. It may be less likely to be  
present on headless server machines, for instance.

It may not be present in a base install, but is available in standard  
packages for many of the above. If the machines are being used as  
typical desktop workstations running Gnome or KDE, with applications  
like Firefox, Adobe Reader, Scribus, AbiWord, Gimp, Inkscape, etc,  
then we can expect libfontconfig to be present. (Aside: in the case  
of Mac OS X, we don't use libfontconfig at all; Apple Type Services  
is used instead, which is always present.)

If I knew how to configure the build so that libfontconfig was "weak- 
linked", so that xetex could run without the library present (and  
test before calling its APIs), then I guess we could have a binary  
that runs without fontconfig; you'd lose the ability to automatically  
find fonts by name in that situation (but then, what would "installed  
fonts" mean in this context?); you could still load them explicitly  
by filename, though, and do Unicode/OpenType typesetting that way.

But at this point I don't know how to do that in the Linux world (or  
these various others), and I don't think it's a high priority.

Now that's bad:  Linux and BSD have different sonames for the same
library version?  The inofficial Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port uses the same
source package as Debian Linux, therefore it also has so.1.1.0

On FreeBSD 6.1 on i386, it comes from a port - x11-fonts/fontconfig to

And what's the soname version?  The number in libfontconfig.so.#?

I thinkt the solution is dlopen(3) on Linux.  Just in case you didn't
know the keyword; I don't know much more than that: It allows loading
and accessing libraries at runtime, with the possibility to check for
success without getting weird user errors.

It's unfortunate, though not necessarily a problem in itself. TL has  
separate binaries for FreeBSD and Linux, at least for i386, so  
there's nothing to prevent them using different sonames. As long as  
the soname on the system that builds the TL binary for FreeBSD  
matches the soname on the target machine, it should be fine.

If this means (as I understand it) that some FreeBSD users have  
libfontconfig.so.1 and others have libfontconfig.so.3, depending  
which package they installed, then we do have a problem here. If  
someone knows how to build without a hard dependency, and find the  
installed library at runtime, that's fine with me. Otherwise I guess  
it'll be up to whoever builds FreeBSD binaries for TL to decide what  
fontconfig package to support.

Ah, but is that going to be available/compatible on all those other  
systems as well, or does it introduce a new area of complexity and  
system dependence, requiring careful configure usage and conditional  
code?

Thanks; I've heard of it but never looked into it. If I have a  
chance, I'll take a look -- but as I've indicated in other responses,  
I don't feel that systems without fontconfig are likely to be the  
primary users of xetex, so if our xetex and xdvipdfmx binaries won't  
run on such a system, I can live with that.

Yes, those who use Debian GNU/kFreeBSD (which is still quite
experimental) should be able to work around this: either install the
texlive Debian package, or get a standard-BSDish libfontconfig.

For those who read Perl well, shouldn't Tpm.pm be kind of a
specification?  It seems the initialize and fresh subroutines are
particularly interesting.

No idea.  Google gives lots of manpage hits for "dlopen +BSD", and at
least enough for +HPUX and even +IRIX (usually a particular bad
candidate, isn't it?)  to believe it might be there...

GNU autotools (autoconf/automake/libtool) provide portable
(cross-platform) API for dlopen, called libltdl. See e.g. here for
it's documentation:

In an ideal world xetex would work everywhere but TeXLive-2005
supported the following systems:

     alpha-linux
     i386-darwin
     i386-freebsd
     i386-linux
     mips-irix
     powerpc-aix
     powerpc-darwin
     sparc-linux
     sparc-solaris
     win32
     x86_64-linux

Unless anybody intends to provide binaries for HP-UX or VAXes we don't
have to care whether fontconfig is installed there or not.

  Reinhard

Me too.  All the alternatives seem worse.

    rk> supported the following systems:

The question will simply be what any given system has installed.  This
is fundamentally how XeTeX is implemented.

    Unless anybody intends to provide binaries for HP-UX 

A volunteer (Tim Arnold) has indeed provided HP binaries for TL05 (after
the release).  They are linked from the home page.  There are also some
Nokia 770 binaries (also linked), although not a full distribution, I
think.  Anyway, I don't think any of this matters ...

    I have moved the file to doc/latex/babelbib and removed the
    bibtex/bib/babelbib directory.

For the future, don't move files around by hand.  That just causes the
confusion the next time there is an update.  My overall goal is for
every package reported on by tpm-ctan-check to be updatable without much
thinking.  Unfortunately some new problems are always coming along.

    Well .. When I run tpm-ctan-check --check I get output/problems with:

Some of them are weird, but most just look like they need the standard
update treatment.  Do what you can ...

    For the specialbib hash: No idea what it is doing? Can I give special
    locations for special files ?!?!? 

Yes.

    Can you fix this? 

Yes.  I added an entry
'babelbib',    'NULL',

That way, the .bib won't be matched, won't be installed in the
bibtex/bib runtime, and will stay in the doc dir.

    If you can take a look at these packages that would be great.

I leave actually using all these things to others (and the users :).

    What about new packages? I think it is better when you care for them. 

Many new packages require little or no ctan2tds.pl magic; others are
enormous hassles.  Anyway, we can discuss this further when
tpm-ctan-check runs clean :).

    Furthermore, note that I have commented powerdot-doc-vn in tpm-can-check
    as it always broke on my system.

Yes, there was a huge discussion about that last year when it was
created, and then it all seemed to be changed.  I don't know where the
powerdot vietnamese doc actually is on CTAN now, if it's there at all.
Can you check?  Maybe write Hendri (powerdot author) if perplexing.  I
just haven't gotten to it.

Thanks sooo much.

If someone wants to create binaries for systems which do not have
fontconfig installed, it shouldn't be too difficult to compile
fontconfig for this system.  The file /etc/fonts/fonts.conf has to be
adapted if necessary.

Anyway, it would be nice if Tim will look into it before TL-2006 will
be released.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <17702.46610.74630.908205@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
this is an excerpt of Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf-4WIN:
________________________________________________________________________
% OSFONTDIR is to provide a convenient hook for allowing TeX to find
% fonts installed on the system (outside of TeX).  An empty default
% value would add "//" to the search paths, so we give it a dummy value.
OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment

% PostScript Type 1 outline fonts.
T1FONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/type1//;$OSFONTDIR//

% PostScript AFM metric files.
AFMFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/afm//;$OSFONTDIR//

% TrueType outline fonts.
TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;$OSFONTDIR//

% Opentype outline fonts.
OPENTYPEFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/opentype//;$OSFONTDIR//
________________________________________________________________________


Are there any Windows releases where the system fonts had not been in
c:/windows/fonts?

Even if they are not, does it hurt if c:/windows/fonts is in the
search path?  For example:

TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;c:/windows/fonts//;$OSFONTDIR//

$OSFONTDIR then has to be set only if the system fonts are somewhere else.

I ask because VnTeX provides support files for Microsoft core fonts
(which support Vietnamese) and it would be nice if users do not have
to set environment variables manually.

The purpose of the TL live system is to allow beginners to try TeX.
If things do not work immediately it is very hard to convince them to
continue.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm using in W32TeX:
% TrueType outline fonts.
SYSTTF = c:/{winnt,windows,winnt35}/fonts//
TTFONTS = .;$SYSTTF;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//

Similar one in TeXlive:
OSFONTDIR = c:/{windows,winnt,winnt35}/fonts//
TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;$OSFONTDIR
may be useful, I think.

OSFONTDIR in other variables like AFMFONTS may not
be necessary at present.

Akira

I think that my latest downloading of LH fonts created some
misunderstanding.
When last version downloaded, I created two archives: lhfnt35f-source.zip
with source mf and latex files and lhfnt35f-gen-mf.zip with all _generated_
mf and latex files. During downloading I said to CTAN-folk that second
archive includes generated files and is a bit optional. In this case they
were allowed to keep this zip unpacked to safe space [But this is only 400Kb
"bonus" to 2Mb complete package]. The contents of archives explained in
manifest.txt. Maybe my explanation is somewhat vague or mislayed?
I never had a clue what file CTAN-guest looks for at first.

I think it makes sense for TTFONTS and OPENTYPEFONTS only;
AFMFONTS (and probably T1FONTS?) can be left out.

> Are there any Windows releases where the system fonts had not been in
> c:/windows/fonts?

the letter can be different. 'windows' sometime can be
'winnt' or other names, depending on what the user chose
during installation. However it doesn't hurt (IMO) if some
paths don't exist.

    TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;c:/windows/fonts//;$OSFONTDIR//

If you do this, I strongly suggest making a variable (WINFONTS or
something), instead of hardwiring the path in the (several) assignments.

Anyway, the idea sounds fine to me.  I agree with your reasoning, FWIW.

Subject: [tex-live] getnonfreefonts
Message-ID: <17704.11295.548982.153932@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
in TeXLive-2005 there had been a shell script called getnonfreefonts
which was supposed to download and install fonts which licenses do not
allow to put them on the CD (no-sell or no-modify restrictions).

I have now written this script in Perl in order to make it available
to Windows users too.

It would be nice if somebody can test it on Windows because I cannot
do it myself.

It should work with TeXLive-2005, the current svn version, or any
older version which provides an updmap which supports the '--enable'
option.  Additionally you need wget and unzip for Windows.

A statically linked version of wget for Windows with OpenSSL support
can be downloaded from:

    http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/wget.exe

The easiest way to install it is to put it into the TeXLive2005
bin/win32 directory.

You'll find setup-win32/unzip.exe on the TL-2005 install CD.  Please
copy it to the bin/win32 directory too.


getnonfreefonts can be downloaded from:

    ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/getnonfreefonts/getnonfreefonts
    ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/getnonfreefonts/getnonfreefonts-sys

Actually both files are identical.  You can download one of them and
make a copy.  The behaviour depends on the filename.

    getnonfreefonts installs files in TEXMFHOME
    getnonfreefonts-sys installs files in TEXMFLOCAL

Put the files into the current directory and run

    perl getnonfreefonts[-sys] --help

to get more information.

*** Note that there is no uninstall option. ***

getnonfreefonts[-sys] first looks for environment variables TMP, TEMP,
and TMPDIR, creates a subdirectory "getfont-<PID>" and removes it when
it is finished.  It would be nice to know whether this works properly
on Windows.

Usually it is sufficient to run getnonfreefonts[-sys] to install the
fonts.  It downloads and executes the program getfont2006.

I tried to support filenames with spaces.  It seems to work on UNIX
but I don't know whether it works on Windows.

If you want to test it, you can download

   ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/getnonfreefonts/getfont2006

to your current working directory.

getfont2006 expects the same commmand-line options as getnonfreefonts
However, --installroot is set by getnonfreefonts and has to be set
manually if getfont2006 is invoked directly.  And getfont2006 does not
have a --help option because it is supposed to be launched by
getnonfreefonts.

If getfont2006 is invoked by getnonfreefonts it installs the map
files, otherwise it only shows the command instead of executing it.

For instance, you can say:

    perl getfont2006 --installroot="some dir/mytexmf" --all --force

Then the packages are downloaded to the current working directory if
they do not already exist and are installed in the specified
directory.

--installroot can contain an absolute or relative path but please note
that you always have to use forward slashes as directory separators.
For instance:

    --installroot="some dir/mytexmf"
    --installroot="c:/some dir/mytexmf"
    --installroot="//foo/some dir/mytexmf"

This is what getfont2006 currently installs:

   ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/getnonfreefonts/texmf-2006.html

The fonts which are currently supported might change later.  I will
add vntex-nonfree when it is officially released.  I also will add
Adobe Utopia if the fonts cannot be part of the TL distribution.

If there are other fonts I can add, please let me know.  It is
required that these fonts can be freely distributed and used.  It is
not required that you are allowed to modify them.

Any feedback is welcome.  Please tell me which OS you are using.

A final decision how to invoke getnonfreefonts on Windows has not been
made yet.  There are a few ways how to do it:

    * Use perlcc to convert it to C and create getnonfreefonts.exe.
    * Put the Perl code into a .bat file. 
    * Provide a program which determines argv[0] and executes perl
      accordingly. 

At the moment you have to say "perl getnonfreefonts ...".

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is all what is left here. Hope you can comment on this, so that we
can go on with some new packages ;-)

No, I am not interested in this and I consider it well to much effort

Akira's suggestion sounds very good:

  > OSFONTDIR = c:/{windows,winnt,winnt35}/fonts//
  > TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;$OSFONTDIR

At the moment we have in texmf.cnf and texmf.cnf-4WIN:

  OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment

The question is what the environment variable OSFONTDIR is supposed to
do:  

  OSFONTDIR = c:/{windows,winnt,winnt35}/fonts//
  TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;$OSFONTDIR

Here, if the environment variable OSFONTDIR is set, $OSFONTDIR in
texmf.cnf is re-defined.  Or should it be like this:

  OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment
  WINFONTDIR = c:/{windows,winnt,winnt35}/fonts//
  TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;$OSFONTDIR;$WINFONTDIR
 
In this case you can use OSFONTDIR to add additional directories.

What happens if I buy and install a Type1 font (Futura for instance)
in order to use it with other programs like Quark, PageMaker or
InDesign.  Will this font be installed in
c:/{windows,winnt,winnt35}/fonts?

If this is the case it should be sufficient to install Walter
Schmidt's Futura support files.  Of course, it will probably not work
because TeX expects other filenames but I have seen font packages
which provide map files which support original filenames.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Norbert,

Thanks so much.

    # texmf-dist/tpm/fancynum.tpm
    # texmf-dist/tpm/hyperref.tpm
    # texmf-dist/tpm/labelcas.tpm

For all of these, can you write the author?

    # texmf-dist/tpm/active-conf.tpm
        the subdirs on CTAN 2006-version and example contain the same files!
        the check compares different files
        ctan2tds calls MAKEflatten which is bad

I guess I didn't notice the files were the same.  Can you straighten out
ctan2tds.pl so it does something reasonable?  I guess active-conf has to
have its own routine :(.  Or ask the author to make the filenames
unique.

	The whole AMS stuff doesn't work, I didn't get it at least to work

The actual AMS files are ok (I believe), it's just the checking that
doesn't work, due to using the TDS zips, etc.  Ignore for now.

	MAKEbeebe needs work, this is true!

Right.  If you care to tackle it, that would be cool.

        the Catalogue entry refers to the first

Does the Catalogue have an entry for the second?  If so, we should
change our package name.  If not, can you write the ctan folks and ask
them to make a Catalogue entry for it?  Except we'll still need a
special case because the package name won't match the directory name.
Ugggh.  But we have to deal with it somehow.  Maybe forget the whole
thing and change tlpkginfo to just explicitly return the latex dir.
Don't worry about the description.

        not a tpm, note that pst-tree.{tex,sty} seems to be distributed 
        together WITH pstricks, ie as part of it. So it should be
        deleted from the tpm-ctan-check as a own package!

How utterly confusing.  Ok, can you remove it from tpm-ctan-check please?

    Where we are more or less.

Yes.  Well, it depends on what you want to do as much as anything.

There is running tlrebuild -n and dealing with all the reports of files
  not in the tpm's, etc.  That's probably most in line with what you've
  been doing so far.
There are hyphenation files to sort out if you care to work on that
  incredibly frustrating task.
There are some patches to apply to the sources.
There are the program sources to update in general (e.g., dvipng).

And, of course, there are endlessly more packages to check on.  The
ultimate goal would be for every package in TL to be tpm-ctan-checked
against CTAN ...

Or, maybe you want to rest on your laurels for a while :).

Thanks again,
Karl

Hi Reinhard,

I executed exactly your command
    >getfont2006.pl --installroot="some dir/mytexmf" --all --force

and it worked perfectly well. Everything was downloaded, unzipped, and installed.
And it worked with the directory name with spaces ("some dir").
If you are interested I can send you the complete output.

If I run "getnonfreefonts.pl -l" I get the error message
    ! ERROR: Can't rmdir 'E:/.../Temp/getfont-2940'. at D:\TeX2005a\getnonfreefonts.pl line 127.
because the directory "/Temp/getfont-2940" contains the non-empty directory structure
    ".\1\fonts\map\dvips\luxi"

Cheers,
     Volker

I would like to suggest:


% OSFONTDIR is to provide a convenient hook for allowing TeX to find
% fonts installed on the system (outside of TeX).  An empty default
% value would add "//" to the search paths, so we give it a dummy value.
OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment

% Windows fonts
WINFONTS = c:/{windows,winnt,winnt35}/fonts//

% PostScript Type 1 outline fonts.
T1FONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/type1//;$OSFONTDIR//

% PostScript AFM metric files.
AFMFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/afm//;$OSFONTDIR//

% TrueType outline fonts.
TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//;$WINFONTS;$OSFONTDIR//

% Opentype outline fonts.
OPENTYPEFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/opentype//;$WINFONTS;$OSFONTDIR//

% PostScript headers and prologues (.pro); unfortunately, some programs
% also use this for acessing font files (enc, type1, truetype)
TEXPSHEADERS = .;$TEXMF/{dvips,fonts/{enc,type1,type42,type3}}//;$OSFONTDIR//
TEXPSHEADERS.gsftopk = .;$TEXMF/{dvips,fonts/{enc,type1,type3,truetype}}//;$OSFONTDIR//

i can imagine that kpse-on-windows sets this OSFONTDIR automatically to 

OSFONTDIR = $SystemRoot/fonts//

unless set by the environent already

hardwiring can take place at the os level; it's an environment variable and i dislike the idea of having WINFONTS LINUXFONTS ANYPLATFORMFONTS and thereby platform dependent cnf files; the whole idea behind OSFONTDIR was that it was a kind of independent name

i just use OSFONTDIR and set it at the environment level 

on windows one can extend that with 

set OSFONTDIR=c:/windows/fonts

.... 

set OSFONTDIR=%OSFONTDIR%;anotherdir 

so there is no need for an extra WINFONTDIR variable

very old package (both of them) predate our more modern care about

i've asked herbert to sort that out, but he's not got around to it yet.

the pstricks tree is a shambles.  by this time next year herbert and might
have come to an agreement about a rearrangement.

    i just use OSFONTDIR and set it at the environment level 

Yeah, but the point of this idea is to not force users to set the extra
environment variable to get access to their system fonts. 

I guess there is no harm in setting OSFONTDIR in the cnf file.  If it's
in the environment, the environment value will override.  If not, it
can't hurt to have it defined via the cnf file.

    dislike the idea of having WINFONTS LINUXFONTS ANYPLATFORMFONTS and
    thereby platform dependent cnf files

I do too, but it is a fact that TL has a separate texmf.cnf for Windows.

Many thanks for testing.  Yes, it would be nice to see whether
everything is installed properly.  Can you send me a directory
listing?

It seems that I must not quote the dollar sign on Windows.  I hope
that the new version I uploaded calls kpsewhich properly. I also
changed the LuxiMono part so that it doesn't create a map diectory if
the --lsfonts argument is present.

Does it work now?

Yes, there are many reasons for having a separate texmf.cnf for Windows, 
eg., we don't need all that -sys stuff, etc.

you may not, and my users may not (each has admin access to their own
machine).

however, users of the (very large) set of workstations that this
university provides to all and sundry *don't* have admin access to the
tex system that's built in to their set of applications.  users of
such systems may reasonably want a personal version of the various
commands, which implies a -sys version under windows too.

Subject: [tex-live] xdvi problems with empty glyph
Message-ID: <20061009.071629.165861488.wl@gnu.org>

[xdvi 22.84.10, T1lib 5.0.1]

The attached Chinese document (which can be directly displayed with
the current TeXLive repository) exhibits a buglet in xdvi (or t1lib).
It says

  xdvi-xaw.bin: Warning: Character 0 is mapped to .notdef
                in font gbsnu30 (page 1), replacing by whitespace.

Glyph 0 in virtual font gbsnlp01 maps to glyph 0 in real font gbsnu30.
This is indeed an empty glyph which is identical to `.notdef';
however, it is called `uni3000' (using the built-in encoding vector).
Somehow the mapping is screwed up.

A minor nit: The grammatical construction in the warning message seems
odd to me.  I suggest

  Warning: Character 0 is mapped to .notdef in font gbsnu30 (page 1).
           Replaced with whitespace.

or something like this.  Perhaps it's even possible to refer to the
original virtual font too, making it easier to identify the
problematic spot in the document.

I couldn't reproduce this problem (I dont' have TeXLive available and
tried to install the CJK package manually but failed) - I didn't quite
understand this part of your report:

> however, it is called `uni3000' (using the built-in encoding vector).
> Somehow the mapping is screwed up.

Would you like the error message to read

Warning: Character uni3000 is mapped to .notdef

instead? Or is this a whitespace character that is erroneously
reported as .notdef?

OK, I thought "replaced by" and "replaced with" are more or less
equivalent, but perhaps this reads better.

> Perhaps it's even possible to refer to the original virtual font

I'm afraid that's not easily possible since the virtual font stuff
works in a recursive way so that the name of the original virtual
font isn't known at the point where the error occurs.

Stefan

Do you have a system in this. Take one tpm by the next and add it to
tpm-ctan-check?

There is no rest. In fact while hacking here I also have to prepare the
packages for TL2005 for Debian/testing which will become stable soon
(freeze in a few days, maybe), and I want to push an update to testing
before the freeze. After etch is release I will probably start to make
preliminary Debian packages for the current svn.


Could we add a TODO file somewhere in the svn, probably the ROOT on what
should/could be done, and with comments like the above, so that it not
gets lost? I will start with it, and you are welcome to extend it.

Best wishes

While making ebuilds for texlive in order to integrate texlive into

geometry.tpm didn't record this dependency. In geometry.sty, there was

\RequirePackage{keyval}%

\RequirePackage and find the package that contains the corresponding

The dependencies are made by hand, added by hand. Of course it would be
nice to add these checks to the generation, but I don't see that this is
easily to be done in an automatic way, as it is hard to say which file
actually to check.

One could check all RunFiles wiht .sty/.cls name for RequirePackage as a
start.

If you want to write a script that does this, you are more than welcome.
You can take a lookat the tpm-factory, or some other perl programs to
see how towork with the tpmsin perl.

Ah yes, if you want to add this dependency, just edit the file.

    nice to add these checks to the generation, 

Well, I'm not sure if it's desirable, actually.  There would be probably
be quite a few common dependencies for virtually all LaTeX packages.
I'm not excited about cluttering up the tpm's with them.

So far, the dependencies have mostly been done at the collection level.
Coarse-grained but basically effective, for current purposes.

I highly doubt there is any automatic way to add them.  It certainly
does not suffice to grep for \RequirePackage.  There is also
\usepackage, package options which can imply other packages, conditional
loading, macro redefinitions, you name it.  Not feasible.

I am guessing from your msg that gentoo is choosing to create a gentoo
package from each TL package (hundreds and hundreds of them).  Is that
right?  I advise against it, precisely because of this dependency
problem, among others.  Debian's method of creating a Debian package
from each collection seemed to work out ok?

THis is not a good idea, as the dependencies - as you have seen - are
not right. Definitely.

Quite ok. There are some inconsistencies I am fixing in Debian, and
trying to merge back into TeX live svn repository. But in general there
are only a few problems (till now).

If you want to take a look at the automatic generation of Debian source
and bin package, take a look at the svn repository at debian-tex-maint
at alioth.debian.org.

HI Karl!

I am starting with tlrebuild -n findings ...

First of all: There is a directory Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amslatex
which seems to contain stuff from amsXXX. I svn blame a file and saw
that is what you ;-) Could it be that you called ctan2tl --place with an
MAKEamslatex = MAKEflatten? Also the docs are there, all doubled, as far
as I see.

...
Files in texmf tree not in tpm files :
texmf-dist/bibtex/bib/amslatex/*
texmf-dist/doc/latex/amslatex/*
texmf-dist/source/latex/amslatex/*
texmf-dist/tex/latex/amslatex/*

After this I will go on ...

Actually it's my effort trying to package texlive for gentoo. I'll

Ok, attached is a small tar bundle `xdvi-problem' (I've stripped the
font gbsnu30 to the bare minimum of holding just two glyphs, `.notdef'
and `uni3000').  Just do

  TEXMF=path/to/xdvi-problem/texmf xdvi xdvi-problem.dvi

and you should get the incorrect warning message.

Well, xdvi is talking about the .notdef glyph, but this glyph isn't
referenced at all -- glyph uni3000 exists in the font!

Yep.

My nit is about `replaced' vs. `replacing', especially within a single
sentence.  Sorry for being imprecise.

I'm aware of that.  I've hoped that xdvi is already tracking the
recursive chain internally (for debugging purposes, for example).
It's really not an important thing.

Subject: [tex-live] compiling problems
Message-ID: <20061010.090511.250573211.wl@gnu.org>


I just tried the following:

. create a directory `texk.compiled'

. within this directory, say

    path/to/TeXLive/Build/source/texk/configure

The last item fails with

  checking for kpse_find_file in -lkpathsea... no
  configure: error: kpathsea library not found
  This version of dvipdfmx requires the kpathsea library and its headers. If
  you know where it is you might try setting the LDFLAGS environment variable
  with -L pointing to the directory containing libkpathsea.a.

  configure: error:
    /usr/local/backup/TeXLive/Build/source/texk/dvipdfmx/configure
    failed for dvipdfmx

Looking up the sources I see the `--enable-tetex-build' variable.
This is completely undocumented...

Since TeXLive doesn't contain libkpathsea I think some users like me
have the desire to build it, to be able to link with external
programs, so I strongly suggest to add documentation for this flag to
kpathsea's (or whatever's) README.

The original read "replacing" (present continuous) and
the proposal was for "replaced" (past).  I don't think
whether "by" or "with" really matters in this context.

This is a known problem of whitespace characters in FreeType which
I've already fixed in the FreeType CVS.  We are going to release 2.2.2
soon (well, `soon', you know, this is a rubber-like term :-).

Is xdvik using FreeType 2 at all?

I don't know about xdvi's use of t1lib (that is specific to xdvik, not
plain xdvi), but I've been playing with adding freetype2 support to xdvi,
and I also get an error with freetype2.  What happens is it returns error
code 6 (invalid argument) when I call FT_Load_Glyph() for the character.

So, I think it's either the font or t1lib/freetype2.

Werner, thanks very much for the sample files! This warning message:

>> >   xdvi-xaw.bin: Warning: Character 0 is mapped to .notdef
>> >                 in font gbsnu30 (page 1), replacing by whitespace.

is indeed factually wrong. What's happening here is that T1lib's
T1_SetChar() does return without an error (it returns a non-NULL
GLYPH pointer), but the 'bits' field of the glyph are NULL. This only
happens for .notdef or whitespace characters, but we couldn't figure
out a way to distiguish these cases. Since whitespace characters are
really rare in `ordinary' fonts (they practically don't exist), and
trying to set a .notdef char usually indicates that something has gone
seriously wrong with the character mapping, we decided to add this
warning.

(There are indeed cases where this warning is useful; see e.g.:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1295829&group_id=23164&atid=377580
)

Obviously this doesn't work for Chinese fonts. That probably means
that we'd need to look at the encoding vector to decide whether it's
really .notdef, but I don't know yet how to do this e.g. for a font
with built-in encoding (using T1lib?).

Best regards,
Stefan

A quick update on T1lib: I tried using T1_GetAllCharNames to check
for .notdef, but unfortunately that doesn't return the names in the
correct order:

   char **glyph_names = T1_GetAllCharNames(t1libid);
   for (int i = 0; glyph_names[i] != NULL; i++) {
       fprintf(stderr, "CHAR %d: %s\n", i, glyph_names[i]);
   }

This prints:

CHAR 0: .notdef
CHAR 1: uni3000

instead of:

CHAR 0: uni3000
CHAR 1: .notdef

Stefan

What do you mean with `correct order'?  Normally, the .notdef glyph is
the very first glyph in the font.  Maybe this is a naive question
since I've never usd T1lib.

What about checking the glyph name?  A glyph called `uni3000' *must*
be retained since it is an ideographic whitespace which has (normally)
exactly the same width as all other CJK characters.

> Since whitespace characters are really rare in `ordinary' fonts

They do exist.  *All* CJK fonts contain at least one such whitespace
glyph.  For a quarter of the world's population, CJK fonts are the
`ordinary' ones :-)

Yep.

    Does the file `kpathsea.cps' intentionally exist in TeXLive's
    source/texk/kpathsea?  It is a generated file...

Well, it is/was intentional.  My idea when I did it, 15 years ago, was
that people might want to reprocess the .texi and why bother making them
regenerate the indexes?  (This is long before texi2dvi/etc. was widespread.)

I don't imagine it serves any purpose now (especially in the context of
tex-live rather than tex-k).  I'll delete it and its ilk.

Thanks,
Karl

    Looking up the sources I see the `--enable-tetex-build' variable.

It is supposed to be enabled by default, when configuring in TL.  I
can't remember all the details.  My wild guess is that by starting the
configure in the texk/ subdir, its enabling got omitted.

    This is completely undocumented...

The TL build process as a whole is pretty much undocumented, except for
the Build script and the tiny README files I've sprinkled around.  One
day, I hope ...

    Since TeXLive doesn't contain libkpathsea 

I don't understand ... it certainly gets built (and used).  How about
doing a normal build and copying it to wherever you want it?

    I strongly suggest to add documentation for this flag to
    kpathsea's (or whatever's) README.

But what if you don't want it for your standalone library?  
And anyway, if what you want is libkpathsea, why configure in texk?
Personally, I'd try configuring in kpathsea itself.  (I have no idea if
it will work or not.)

The whole concept of building single parts of TL is even more
problematic than building the whole thing.  The best thing would be if
kpathsea/web2c/dvips/etc. still had separate releases, but this does not
seem like it's going to happen.  There's only so many hours in the day.

Sorry,

I just want libkpathsea and its header files.

Hehe, it doesn't work (at least if you enable dynamic libraries).  You
always have to run the top-level `configure --enable-tetex-build',
then saying `make' in the kpathsea directory works fine.  This bit of
information I would like to have in the README...

Err, well, probably yes, to some extent.  Ralf Stubner and I have tried
to understand the kind of messy situation of the PSNFSS tpm files.  A
first report is in

http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/tex-live/2006-May/010058.html

After that, we digged through old and current CTAN files, documentation,
and finally think we have an idea.  The result would probably be some
reorganization, and a considerable removal of completely useless,
obsolete and sometimes non-free material.  However, we wanted to
double-check this by asking Walter Schmidt, the psnfss maintainer, and
unfortunately he hasn't answered so far.

But indeed I should probably bring that up now, and not one week before
TeXlive is going to be released...  I send Walter a copy of this mail.
Walter, can you please tell us whether you will have time to look into
this?  

For the time being, you can have a look at the script we used for the
analysis at 

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/searchbase35?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

and at the results:  The files with names starting with psnfss- in 

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/debian-tex/texlive/trunk/LocalTPM/?rev=0&sc=0


So while I do not object to add files that are missing, I think those
tpm files need a proper reorganization sooner or (rather not) later.

Okay, let's just do it.  Walter can always comment if something's wrong
with the details of our analysis.  So here's the mail that I have
prepared.  As it turns out, I've also written something about Werner's
request, the addition of afm files, at the very end.  Probably
pro-adding them, all in all.


Hi all,

as already pointed out previously[1], there is some confusion about
files in TeXlive that are required (or not) to use the base Postscript
fonts with psnfss.  There are files in TeXlive that are not on CTAN at
all, and some are in directories not related to PSNFSS.

In the last weeks, we (Ralf Stubner and I) have tried to get an overview
of the situation, which I am going to present here.

We also propose a solution in terms of some tpm reorganization (or
rather, a couple of alternatives).  However, we did not understand all
arguments made in the previous thread, so please take this as a
suggestion made under the assumption that no other constraints exist
(like existing infrastructure, information we have missed etc.).  It may
turn out that what is finally implemented must differ considerably from
this proposal.  But we are sure that some things will have to be
changed, and this might be an opportunity to start the discussion.


The files that we deal with are currently in the tpms for

   "avantgar", "bookman", "charter", "courier", "helvetic", "ncntrsbk",
   "palatino", "symbol", "times", "zapfchan", "zapfding"

There are 1656 files all in all.  These can be gathered into the
following seven groups.  For reference, the script used to filter this
is available at [2], and the files indicated for each category can be
obtained at [3]

1. Files required for psnfss, as described in psnfss' 00readme.txt:

   599 files, psnfss-required.txt, plus one file from lw35nfss.zip that
              is missing in texlive (pzcmi8r.tfm)

2. Files that used to be required (or at least useful) for psnfss, but
   have been removed from CTAN and not yet from TeXLive:

   149 files, psnfss-lw35obs.txt and psnfss-urwrenamed.txt

3. Files for direct access to the URW fonts without PSNFSS ("urw35vf"),
   no longer on CTAN because Walter Schmidt recommends to not do this

   544 files, psnfss-urwdirect.txt

4. Fonts that need other macro packages than PSNFSS to be accessed

   284 files, psnfss-csps.txt, psnfss-pclnfss.txt, psnfss-pslatex.txt, psnfss-ly1.txt

5. Metrics for fonts that are not available on CTAN, or with only
   non-free Type1 files

   45 files, psnfss-phvl.txt and psnfss-ibm.txt

6. Source files for psnfss metrics, not useful for document processing

   29 files, psnfss-psnfss-source.txt

7. Metrics about which we could not find out anything

   5 files, psnfss-nocategory.txt


So what should we do, which changes are desirable?  Here are some
guidelines: 

- In order to facilitate updating from CTAN, files from one directory or
  subtree should end up in the same tpm.  Probably it would also be good
  if one tpm does not contain files from too many directories, but we
  don't know whether this has really any effect

- As PSNFSS maintainer, Walter Schmidt once said he does not want to get
  into a situation were support for obsolete fonts or ways to access
  fonts is expected from him (if I understood correctly).  Therefore,
  such files should not be in the tpms required for PSNFSS, but in tpms
  marked as obsolete, if at all.

Assuming no constraints from existing infrastructure, this would result
in the following changes:

a) The files from categories 2 and 3 above are removed from TeXlive, or
   at least moved to a separate tpm (URW-direct-obsolete.tpm).

   We do not expect that this breaks any existing documents - other
   distributions like teTeX and MikTeX do not have these files
   currently, and no incompatibilities are known.  In a mail
   following[1], Karl Berry has used urw35vf as an example against too
   intrusive changes, but I did not really understand the point.  In
   case you (Karl) or anybody else knows a place where these virtual
   fonts are actually used, we would have to reconsider this.  But in
   any case we strongly favor separating them from the default PSNFSS
   install. 

b) The source files from category 6 above are either removed, or else
   installed below texmf/source/fonts.

c) The metric files (whose licenses are non-free or unclear) which don't
   have corresponding (free) fonts on CTAN should be removed.  Among
   these 50 files, only 6 are non-free fonts available on CTAN (the
   recently discussed mis-named "Adobe" Courier fonts which are in fact
   from IBM), the others have no corresponding fonts at all on CTAN.  We
   are also not aware of any macro package for accessing the Courier
   font, and therefore do not expect any breakage.

d) The fonts that need other macro packages for access (category 4)
   should probably be moved to the respective packages.  This means that
   they will be installed with the files that are in the same
   directories on CTAN.  For example,

   115 tfm/vf files from CTAN://macros/latex/contrib/pclnfss would be
       moved to pclnfss.tpm; they are only useful for people who own a
       PCL printer and/or use an appropriate PCL viewer, and who use the
       pclnfss LaTeX style files.  Moreover, pclnfss provides more fonts
       than just the Base PostScript fonts, and we thing all should be
       treated the same way.  Together with the existing pclnfss they
       stay in collection-fontsextra.

   147 tfm/vf files from cspsfonts.tar.gz which are accessed through
       CSTeX, csLaTeX or czech/slovak.sty, and not useful for documents
       that do not use any of these macro packages.  They should be
       either moved to the existing cs.tpm (Metafont fonts) or a new one
       with appropriate dependencies.

    20 tfm files from psnfssx could be moved to psnfssx.tpm where the
       corresponding fd/sty files reside.

     2 afm files from macros/latex/contrib/pslatex, which can be moved
     to pslatex.tpm

e) This leaves us with only the files from category 1 in the PSNFSS
   realm.  On CTAN, these are at three different locations.  They
   include: 

   - All files from fonts/urw/base35/
   - All pfb files from fonts/charter (afm files are not installed)
   - All files from freenfss.zip and lw35nfss.zip in
     macros/latex/required/psnfss/ 

   There are a couple of possibilities to group them into tpm files.

   1. Keep things as they are: <fontname>.tpm contains all files from
      fonts/urw/base35/<fontname>/ plus the corresponding metric files
      from freenfss.zip or lw35nfss.zip

   2. Per-font tpms as above, but metric files from freenfss.zip or
      lw35nfss.zip are put into psnfss.tpm to reflect their origin

   3. One tpm for the complete fonts/urw/base35 directory, metric files
      in psnfss.tpm as in 2.


   We assume that from the point of view of easy updating, putting the
   metric files into the tpm that corresponds to their upstream origin
   is desirable.  This would be an argument in favor of 2 or 3.  With
   option 2, however, the tpm files would become very small (26 files
   for Helvetica, 12 for Avantgarde, Bookman, Courier, NewCent, Palatino
   and Times, 3 or 4 for the rest).

   One related issue that should be decided is whether afm files should
   be installed.  If I'm not mistaken, each TeXlive tpm also installs
   its source files.  Since afm files are usually source files, this
   means they should be installed in TeXlive, even if the location is
   not TEXMF/source, but TEXMF/fonts/afm.  But then we should be
   consistent and install all of them, e.g. add the missing ones for
   Charter. 

Thank you for considering, Frank

I've added those files right now.

Note that a few months ago I've uploaded new AFM files for the 35 base
fonts, with direct permission from Adobe (for built-in fonts with 229
and 314 glyphs, respectively), which have a clarified free license.
For consistency, I haven't used them right now but the versions from
teTeX.  If you are going to update all those PSNFSS stuff it might be
worth to use the new AFM files which come with greatly enhanced sets
of kerning pairs.

Emacs is much too large to go on the CD.  But what certainly is
possible is to put Windows binaries into the support directory on the
DVD.  That means that it cannot be part of TeXLive, i.e. people have
to install it manually.  Installation means to unpack the zip file
and set the HOME environment variable if it is not set already.

I don't know what NTEmacs is but what we are thinking about is the
current version at:

   ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/auctex

This is a recent CVS version of GNU Emacs + auctex,reftex, and
preview-latex.  I'm using the version from June on Linux at home
and on Windows at work and am very happy with it.

If 37 MB is not too much for you to download, just try it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for adding the afm files.

    which have a clarified free license.

Where is this license, please?  I wasn't aware that Adobe had clarified
the free state of the afm's.  That's great.

    worth to use the new AFM files which come with greatly enhanced sets
    of kerning pairs.

That would be nice, but we must not change the existing tfm files, that
would break typesetting compatibility.  I imagine we could come up with
new names, one way or another (maybe u... instead of p...), if someone
wants to undertake the project.

It's in the bundles (in CTAN/fonts/adobe/afm):

  This file and the 35 PostScript(R) AFM files it accompanies may be
  used, copied, and distributed for any purpose and without charge,
  with or without modification, provided that all copyright notices
  are retained; that the AFM files are not distributed without this

       at least moved to a separate tpm (URW-direct-obsolete.tpm).

Just to reiterate, as things stand, we can't arbitrarily make up tpm
names.  TPM names = directory names.  A new tpm implies new directories.
(Not saying it's an obstacle, just saying.  A directory named
"URW-direct-obsolete" does not sound too appealing.)

    Thank you for considering, Frank

At first glance, your proposals seem reasonable, but unfortunately,
there's no conceivable way I can even begin to think about all this
within the next couple of days, or, more than likely for the final TL
release this year.  Maybe next year.  Sorry.

    not one week before
    TeXlive is going to be released

Debian, that is.  (And Norbert's mail a day or two ago was the first I
ever heard of it...)  Not the general TL.  You do realize you're taking
what amounts to a development snapshot ... hope it works out.

    tpm files need a proper reorganization sooner or (rather not) later.

The tpm files, per se, aren't the problem -- they accurately (I assume)
reflect what is in the repository.  The problem is the mess of *actual*
font files :).  And sure, I agree, "sooner" would always be nicer than
"later".

    Hehe, it doesn't work (at least if you enable dynamic libraries).  

Hmm.

    You always have to run the top-level `configure
    --enable-tetex-build', then saying `make' in the kpathsea directory
    works fine.  This bit of information I would like to have in the
    README...

Well, ok, I suppose information is good.  Installing standalone
libkpathsea (especially dynamic libraries) is not something I especially
want to encourage.  My experience is that it just causes trouble.

I'll put in something about this, somewhere.

Thanks,

Subject: [tex-live] Help needed: updating stuff in TeX live
Message-ID: <20061012024433.GC26870@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi friends!

I am currently working with Karl to make updates to the packages in TeX
live. Furhermore, we try to automate this as far as possible.

For many packages this has already been done, please see
http://www.tug.org/texlive/pkgupdate.html
I am trying to update in regular intervals the packages which are 
already checked by this procedure.

But we need help in getting MORE packages checked by the magic
	tpm-ctan-check
program. 

So here is a small HOWTO for those who once in a while find
time to play around a bit and help update packages in TeX live.


0) Add /pat/to/texlive/svn/repository/Build/tools to your path

1) Choose a package, ie a tpm, best for now one in texmf-dist/tpm/ which
   is NOT already in tpm-ctan-check. You can get a list of the
   not treated packages by calling
	tpm-ctan-check --list-not-treated-tpm
   

2) check licensing, sources [doc especially], etc.
   if you have the CTAN archive available you can call
	CTAN=/pat/to/CTAN tlpkginfo --ctan-dir <package>
   to get the location of the package.
	(optional, but would be great)
        If you want/can PLEASE update the TeX Catalogue entry or send
        us tex-live at tug.org, debian-tex at lists.debian.org
        the relevant information: 
                - version of package checked
                - date checked
                - type of license
                - where the license statement can be found (filename, eg
                  README)

3) run ctan2tl and inspect the output, please see details on the above
   website for a short explanation how to interpret the output

3a) if good, then good:
 	- add the package name to ctan-tpm-check (yeah, one more)
	- call ctan2tl --place <package>
	- submit

3b) if bad, then bad:
	Hack ctan2tds as necessary, which can be everything:
	maybe just MAKEflatten, maybe something else.
	Or just inform us here and we will take a look.

4) continue with another package.


If you want to add a NEW package without a tpm, do more or less the same
as above, only in stel 3a) add it also to one of the collections, or ask
us where to add it.

So, we hope that there is someone to help us, because there are hundreds
of packages in the queue. Our dream is that at some future point we can
automate *most* of the updates with tpm-ctan-check/ctan2tl.

If you have questions, please ...

Best wishes

Norbert

No, TeXlive.  I hope TeXlive 2006 will be released before 2007?

No, Debian etch will have TeXlive 2005, no matter how fast TeXlive 2006
is released.

Yes, the files are the actual mess.  Me talking about the tpm files is
because for Debian we use the tpm files to put things in place.  And
also because they are a better entry point to sorting things out than
the actual directories, which are dispersed among different subtrees
(afm, tfm, pfb, ...)

Just to reiterate, as things stand, I don't see the relation between
current tpm names and directory names ;-).  Really, we are not
understanding each other here, and should somewhen take the time and
sort it out.

In my view, each tpm in the current psnfss set has the name of an
existent directory, but contains files from lots of other directories,
but often not the complete set of files from these external directories,
only some.  And the obsolete stuff doesn't exist on CTAN currently,
anyway.  So we could remove it or put it where we like.  Maybe
s/obsolete/historical/.=20

Actually, I'm glad about that.  I wanted to reduce my involvement in TeX
stuff until the end of the year.  I just thought now was the right time
to speak up, but I didn't like the idea to discuss it now.

we (ctan team) are engaged in updates of several of our user (web)

the licence itself may be seen at http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/

I cannot suggest a definitive interpretation.  But I can inform you that

- some people on debian-legal believe that it is non-free, see
  http://people.debian.org/~terpstra/message/20040312.160816.9f618d1f.html 

- one of the Debian ftp-masters, who are the group who actually have to
  judge about licenses, thinks that it is free if a document doesn't
  make use of any of the license's options (like defining and
  restricting "substantial modification" or prohibiting paper copies):
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=384019;msg=70

  It's typical for James Troup that you don't get an answer if you ask
  again, as has happened in that bug report...
  

I think that it is clear that this license *with*options* is not free.
This is bad, because you would need to add two items for that license:
without options, with one or both of options A and B.  Moreover, there's
a different license, the Open Content License, which is often referenced
by the same acronym, OPL, and also issued by opencontent.org.

I do sincerely hope that the new versions of the GFDL and CC
attribution-sharealike licenses will be free without any doubt, so that
we can actually suggest documentation authors a good license...

There is a misunderstanding here. The Debian TeX Live packages prepared
by Norbert are based on TL 2005, not on current SVN snapshots.

The GNU interpretation is essentially the same as the Debian
"ftp-masters", as far as I can tell.  You can find the GNU statement
about it as the last item in this section:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#FreeDocumentationLicenses

BTW, I was the one who suggested to Jim that the OPL be called nonfree,
or at least non-dfsg (because of the problems stated).

http://ctanweb.ctan.org/cgi-bin/searchByLicense.py reports that there is
nothing on CTAN using it.  If that's so, maybe the simplest solution is
to remove it from your lists altogether?

    Just to reiterate

Oh, I did not know this was unclear.

    each tpm in the current psnfss set has the name of an
    existent directory, but contains files from lots of other directories,

It has nothing to do with psnfss in particular.

Once again: what Fabrice wrote was a system which *automatically*
updates the file lists in texmf-dist/tpm and texmf-doc/tpm.  Manual
changes to those file lists are useless and get overwritten.

The scripts update foo.tpm by, essentially, looking for subdirectories
named "foo" in the usual places.  This is why I say tpm names =
directory names.  For example, helvetic.tpm contains files in
directories named "helvetic".

(There are depressingly many special cases, but that's a different
story, as is texmf/tpm.)

Ah, now I understand.  I tend to consider this as a design flaw, but we
might have to cope with it.

Anyway, it doesn't make it harder to remove files that are no longer on
CTAN (like the obsolete urw35vf stuff), or things that slipped in by an
other mechanism, like the dvi-augsburg versions of Palatino (no
directory name like this).

(I really thought I have explained this once on debian-(te)tex, whatever)

Since you two know best the problems which currently exists, could you
make a new proposal which:
- takes into respect the tpm names stuff
  Furthermore, if directory names on CTAN and in TeX live are the same,
  this also helps, but this is not necessary

- takes into account the new licensing Walter told us

- lists 
  . what directories should be removed/changed
  . which directories finally exist with which content

I would prepare the stuff for TeX live svn repository.

I guess Karl will agree if we do this (or?).

Thanks a lot and all the best

Hi John,

    I use TeXLive 2005 which is by now pretty old. Is there an iso image for 
    Texlive current?  

No.  Nothing has changed since the last time this was asked.  I am still
waiting for the pdftex and metapost releases before pushing towards this
year's TeX Live.  I won't be making ISO images until then.

The development sources are available through Subversion.

Is there documentation missing?  Otherwise I suggest to remove those

Yes, there is documentation for pst-3d:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-3dplot/doc/

and also for pst-labo in 

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-labo/

pst-labo comes with documentation in different languages.

Thanks for checking - did you find this by chance?  Maybe the update
scripts should also check for this.

Message-ID: <ca5a2f2e0610182356g614986e0of8854574351750e4@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings -

I recently switched to Win XP for work, and I'm struggling to find a TeX
distribution.  I'm primarily interested in LaTeX.  I followed the
instructions to install TeX Live and it worked for a while.  Then it stopped
working completely, claiming not to find the latex.fmt file.  I checked in
texmf-var/web2c and indeed it had disappeared (I presume the file had been
there at some point).  I couldn't find it on my machine, so I removed the
entire installation after a totally unproductive morning playing with
fmtutil and mktexfmt.  After removing the files using the GUI, I manually
deleted the C:\TeXLive2005 directory and the tex related environment
variables.  I then reinstalled everything.

Still not working, still unable to find latex.fmt.  I'll try to include all
the relevant information, but I may miss something:

the texmf.cnf file includes the following lines, among many others:

TEXMFMAIN = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf
TEXMFDIST = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-dist
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local
TEXMFSYSVAR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var
TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf
TEXMFVAR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var
TEXMFCONFIG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var

%%TEXMFSYSCONFIG isn't defined

TEXMF =
{!!$TEXMFCONFIG,!!$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

WEB2C =    $TEXMF/web2c

TEXINPUTS.latex        = .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.latex209    = .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex209,generic,latex,}//
TEXINPUTS        = .;$TEXMF/tex/{$progname,generic,}//


and so on.  running
fmtutil --missing
produces a list of failures all of the form
c:\TeXLive2005\texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf: ini file latex.ini not found

running kpsewhich confirms that SELFAUTOPARENT, TEXMF, and TEXMFCNF are
fine.

kpsewhich -expand-var $TEXINPUTS
.;C:\TeXLive2005\texmf/tex/{kpsewhich,generic,}//


Finally, as environmental variables, we see

set TEXMF
TEXMF=C:\TeXLive2005\texmf
TEXMFCNF=C:\TeXLive2005\texmf-var\web2c
TEXMFTEMP=C:\TeXLive2005\temp


any and all suggestions will be tried and appreciated.  thanks in advance,

tim

Hi,

Is it still necessary to include this entry in /etc/apt/sources.list:


# Texlive
deb http://ftp.it.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
deb-src http://ftp.it.debian.org/debian/ unstable main


since the packages are now available from the standard Debian unstable and
testing sources?  I got confused by the message in
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html.

Also, is it still necessary to purge before upgrading of the texlive
packages, as it was recommended in the past?  Thanks in advance.

Hi Tim,

Sorry to hear about the unsuccessful struggles.

    c:\TeXLive2005\texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf: ini file latex.ini not found

It should be in texmf-dist/tex/latex/config/latex.ini.  Is it there?

Is the ls-R file up to date?  Try running mktexlsr.

What's the output from kpsewhich latex.ini?  Anything?

    %%TEXMFSYSCONFIG isn't defined

Shouldn't matter.

    Finally, as environmental variables, we see

I'm surprised any environment variables need to be set.  I'd try
unsetting them all.

In particular, is C:\TeXLive2005\texmf-var\web2c\texmf.cnf the texmf.cnf
file you were looking at?  What does kpsewhich texmf.cnf say?

People really are using TL under Windows, so hopefully it will be
possible to get it working!

Best,
Karl

Well, this can only be true for `simple' packages.  Right now I'm in
the process of updating my CJK package to version 4.7.0, and the files
are scattered over six different TPMs in both texmf and texmf-dist:

  bin-cjkutils
  c90enc
  CJK
  garuda
  hyphen-pinyin
  norasi

Additionally, a bunch of files goes into the source tree.

I can't see any solution to get an automatic update.  However, my
package contains a file `TeXLive.txt' which lists the corresponding
TPM for each file -- basically as a guide for myself.

How can those special cases be identified?

AFAIK ftp.it.debian.org is just the italian mirror of the main Debian
server - Norbert works in Italy and therefore used that as an example.  

You can use any mirror, and testing or unstable as you prefer.

No, this was only for upgrades while it was in experimental.  Now it
should work just as usual: apt-get update or apt-get dist-upgrade.

    Well, this can only be true for `simple' packages.  

It is a fact.  It is how the texmf-dist tpm's have been updated ever
since Fabrice brought texmf-dist into existence.

    are scattered over six different TPMs in both texmf and texmf-dist:

Right.  Six tpm's = six TL packages.  I see nothing inconsistent with
what I said.  Maybe humans think of it as one CJK "package", but the
only files in CJK.tpm are the ones in subdirs named CJK.  There is no
benefit to be gained by trying to do anything different, as far as I can
see.

texmf is a different story, not rigorously based on subdir names.

    I can't see any solution to get an automatic update.  

What do you mean?  It is already done, and has been for a couple of years.

    How can those special cases be identified?

Looking at the code in Tpm.pm et al.

I mean the transformation from the two CJK bundles on CTAN to the six
TPM packages (plus the code in the source directory).

Thanks, it's great to see texlive fully integrated into Debian.  Thanks to

Where it is written:

So this should be clear.

No, as Frank already answered. And this remark is also not anymore
present on the page above.

Upgrades should now as Debian-smooth as usual ;-) (At least I hope ;-)

I see now that my confusion stemmed from not realising that this meant
official Debian repository (implied by the parenthetical note above).
Perhaps an explicit note would make it clearer.

Subject: [tex-live] Setting of TTFONTS variable?
Message-ID: <86ejt3fbvp.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

currently texmf.in specifies

TTFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/truetype//

Some Debian packages want to use system truetype fonts installed below
/usr/share/fonts/truetype.  For example, the latex-hangul-ucs package
(see http://faq.ktug.or.kr/faq/Hangul-ucs) adds
/usr/share/fonts/truetype/unfonts// to that path - and we were wondering
why we should not simply add /usr/share/fonts/truetype// itself?

Any ideas about that?  Of course, dvipdfmx or ttf2* would still need
proper mapfiles to access the fonts.  For some, hangul-ucs already
provides map files for dvipdfm, pdftex and ttf2pk.

Ah, you are right.  I skipped the recent discussion about OSFONTDIR
because it seemed so Windows-centric.  I've re-read the thread now, and
I think I understand.

Probably you have, but I didn't understand.  Our personal,
Debian-specific problem is that this means that it will not be possible
to generate our copyright file based on the tpm files: There's no
correspondence between CTAN uploads (directory hierarchies) and tpm
files, as I assumed.

I guess this means that only (some of) the removals should be done, not
the moves (and the one addition).

> - takes into account the new licensing Walter told us

I'm still not sure to which files in TeXlive these files correspond, I
will have to look that up again.  It's so long since I compiled the
list... 

> - lists 
>   . what directories should be removed/changed

Should I make the work based on tpm files, or file lists? 

> I would prepare the stuff for TeX live svn repository.
>
> I guess Karl will agree if we do this (or?).

Without looking at individual files again, here's what will be left from
the original proposal:

1. Files required for psnfss, as described in psnfss' 00readme.txt:

   599 files, psnfss-required.txt, plus one file from lw35nfss.zip that
              is missing in texlive (pzcmi8r.tfm)

 ===> KEEP, add missing tfm file

2. Files that used to be required (or at least useful) for psnfss, but
   have been removed from CTAN and not yet from TeXLive:

   149 files, psnfss-lw35obs.txt and psnfss-urwrenamed.txt

 ===> REMOVE

3. Files for direct access to the URW fonts without PSNFSS ("urw35vf"),
   no longer on CTAN because Walter Schmidt recommends to not do this

   544 files, psnfss-urwdirect.txt

 ===> REMOVE

7. Metrics about which we could not find out anything

   5 files, psnfss-nocategory.txt

 ===> REMOVE

I'm unclear about:

5. Metrics for fonts that are not available on CTAN, or with only
   non-free Type1 files

   45 files, psnfss-phvl.txt and psnfss-ibm.txt

This includes probably the files from Adobe for which we now have a
license, but I haven't checked.  Furthermore, even if there are no Type1
files on CTAN, it might make sense to install the support files if 

- there might be users who have them

- a method exists to actually access them, i.e. some LaTeX style files
  or similar.

I'll have to check that.

Files under the original points 4 and 6 will probably stay were they
are.

    no correspondence between CTAN uploads (directory hierarchies) and tpm

It is not 100%, but usually the correspondence is very close indeed.
As far as copyright goes, it's not like TL just adds random files to
what is uploaded.  So I don't see the problem ... in general.

In the specific case of the afm/tfm/etc. font files, it is a horrible
mess and we have to straighten it out, which will take ages and won't
happen before this release.  But the ultimate goal would be that we will
have the files from ctan clearly separated from other files not on CTAN,
and the "not on CTAN" files would be minimized or eliminated, one way or
another.  And furthermore that files that are in different packages on
CTAN would be in different packages in TL.  That's the goal.  Motherhood
and apple pie.

There's no problem for TeXlive, neither legal nor technical.  There's
just a problem for the Debian packages which wanted to create a
comprehensive list that allows to associate copyright information to
individual files:  We wanted to use the existing information in the tpm
files for this purpose.  However, since the psnfss font tpm files
(helvetic.tpm etc.) contain files of different origin, this doesn't
work, or at least needs some special-casing.

Yup, we know. But there are more special cases than this. I think the
work we are doing on ctan2tl script with all the MAKE..... functions
does exactely this. But: Currently *only* AMS is an example for many
source.zips to different .tpms. PSNFSS is another, but there are very
few, at leats we hope. CJK comes to my mind as another (but it is one
CTAN to many tpm, so this is no problem).

So I would say that even with my DD hat on I don't see a problem,
because we really have that the mapping CTAN->tpm is in most cases 1-1,
plus a few special cases. Yes, those we have to treat separately.

Best wishes

Hello,
I would like to ask about the deadline for TL 2006. I would like to
put the new version of Velthuis Devanagari which works with babel.
There are no hyphenation patterns, thus zerohyph.tex is used. There
are only changes in macros, the preprocessor remains unchanged,
recompilation of the existing preprocesor is not needed. I will
definitely do not manage to finish it before Marrakesh but then I can
do it within a few days (the documentation for babel is not written at
all).

BTW: we also have new babel modules for Czech and Slovak. I do not
know whether its developer has already contacted anybody but it would
be nice if it were included in TL 2006.

A few days after Marrakesh is fine.  For the sake of concreteness, let's
say November 20.  (Same date I need the final papers for the tug06
proceedings, BTW, if you end up wanting to make any changes after the
conference.)

    BTW: we also have new babel modules for Czech and Slovak. I do not
    know whether its developer has already contacted anybody but it

If they're put on CTAN as separate packages with separate names that
don't conflict with babel, we can include them.  As Szabo did with the
new Hungarian magyar.ldf.  We can't (don't want to) change the core
babel.

(I hope the Babel maintainer finds time to integrate all these new
packages.  Besides yours and Peter's, there's also Jabri's Arabic.  Work
perpetually continues ...)

    The existing modules should be deleted and replaced with the new ones.

Are you talking about them as separate packages, or as part of babel?

For separate packages, there is no problem.  Upload/Update them on CTAN,
and I will merge them into TL.

As far as core babel itself goes, TL needs to distribute whatever the
LaTeX team is distributing as "latex".  Otherwise there will be no end
of trouble.

Cheers,
