    Medium. :-)

Are you volunteering to do the work of re-integrating it with
web2c/teTeX/TeX Live?  Not to mention MiKTeX.

Meanwhile, all the other tex.web-based programs (e.g., tex, omega,
aleph) will now have to be updated/built independently, and changes made
redundantly in multiple places if things are to stay in sync.  That's
actually the work I was most concerned about.  But I guess there is no
alternative at this point.

(I do understand how development is made much more efficient with a
single pdftex.web.)

    Yes. No. 

So if you're dropping kpathsea, will pdftex still read texmf.cnf files?
Pay attention to the same environment variables, with the same syntax?
Do subdir searching?  I.e., is the user-level search interface to be the
same as kpathsea, or was compatibility not a concern?

With these laconic answers, I feel like I'm begging for scraps.
You've apparently made a decision which will impact every distribution
and potentially every TeX user, and we only heard about it by accident.
Can you please be a little more forthcoming?

    Check out the latest pdfTeX 1.40-beta. :-)

Nothing on pdftex.org.  Nothing on pdftex.sarovar.org.  Ah, there it is,
at
http://sarovar.org/download.php/913/pdftex-1.40.0-beta-20060213.tar.bz2.
I should have known, I guess.

Ok, I got it, but I see nothing in the NEWS file about eliminating
kpathsea, and indeed, kpathsea is still in the source tarball.  Where am
I supposed to look?  What is the story?  Please answer in more than one
syllable :).

Don't panic! :-)

We have only integrated the web and change files for TeX + eTeX +
pdfTeX into one file pdftex.web (and one change file pdftex.ch)
and done away with the seperate pdfetex binary - there will be
only pdftex anymore, which has all the features (eTeX (+lua
(+alpeh (+ ...)))). kpse is still there, web2c is still there.

Happy?

Best

The "Yes" was the answer to " still using web2c and kpathsea", the "no"
to "or have you abandoned that as well"

Thanks for the interpretation/explanation of Martins email.
The enigmatic response above wasn't exactly clarifying anything.

I wouldn't known either, would rather look for NEWS or Changelog file, 
or similar, simple and informative. How about making such a file, Martin?

It makes sense for people to start using pdftex-1.40.0-beta now, so
any bugs can be worked out in advance of the next round of updates to
the texmf trees.

I can report that building pdftex-1.40.0-beta on linux is simple, but
building pdftex-1.30 on Win32 exhausted what small patience I have
with Win32, so I've been using Akira Kakuto's w32tex:

If you'd looked into the tarball you would have found a file
named NEWS. And on sarovar you can find release notes for the
files. How about doing some research, Kaja?

Again, all that's needed is a simple announcement of a new version, 
giving short summary of changes and web location. No big deal. After 
all, pdftex is the main engine these days and yet we learned here about 
new version almost accidentally. But if that's impossible, let it be.

I looked for better information on releases of pdfTeX. Yes, I'm aware this 
is a beta version. And no, I cannot be a beta tester (I wish I could).

Hi,

is there some documentation on how the TeXlive infrastructure works?  Or
if not, can anybody explain me where the information for creating and
updating tpm files comes from?

In particular, I'm confused about the fonts required by psnfss: The TeX
Catalogue has one entry for them, urw-base35, but TeXlive has them in
several tpm files, one for each font family.  Now, looking at
avantgar.tpm, I find that it contains files that are currently not on
CTAN.  For example, in the first directory,

texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/avantgar/uagb8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/avantgar/uagbi8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/avantgar/uagr8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/avantgar/uagri8a.afm

and lots of files for virtual fonts that map Adobe names on URW names.
teTeX 3.0 doesn't have all of them, but it has other files not found on
CTAN (pagd8z.vf, pagk8z.vf and friends).

Thanks for helping me out,
Frank

Hi Frank,

    is there some documentation on how the TeXlive infrastructure works?

I've written a few notes in Build/tools/README and Build/cdbuild/README,
but it is nothing very detailed as of yet.  Just started learning my way
around myself last year ...

    Or if not, can anybody explain me where the information for creating
    and updating tpm files comes from?

Well, the packages I updated last year mostly did indeed come from CTAN,
in a semi-automated way.

However, there are plenty of packages, especially the big core ones,
which have not been updated per se in many years, and have just sort of
accumulated.  And psnfss is one of those.  So I am not surprised by the
missing vf's/afm's/etc. you found.  The hierarchies on CTAN are less
than crystal clear, too.

If you have the inclination to figure out exactly which files should be
copied (or removed from) where, that would be great.

    In particular, I'm confused about the fonts required by psnfss: The TeX
    Catalogue has one entry for them, urw-base35, 

I'm not too sure what the distinction is between urw-base35 and psnfss
(both of which have Catalogue entries), for that matter.

    several tpm files, one for each font family.  

One thing I can answer is why each font family ends up in its own tpm.
When Fabrice implemented the mostly-automated tpm updates for texmf-dist
(and texmf-doc), the font family level was pretty much the only way to
do it.  We couldn't make tpm's based on foundries (everything would end
up in "public", etc.), and there is nothing else.  So each font, pretty
much, ends up in its own tpm.

The texmf/tpm/collection-* tpm's which aggregate the various packages
are maintained by hand.

Does that help?

Karl

I've talked Walter Schmidt, psnfss maintainer, and he suggested to put
all the base fonts required by psnfss (the files in
fonts/urw/urw-base35) into one tpm file.  That would imply also removing
lots of stuff.  The to-be-removed parts are those of currently unknown
origin, so I can't say to which existing or new tpm they should be moved.

psnfss are the LaTeX support files (sty, fd, map, documentation) for the
basic 35 postscript fonts and some other free type1 fonts.  urw-base35
are the actual font files for the base35 fonts (including tfm), there
must also be a catalogue entry (or some) for the font files of the other
fonts.

I understand the aim; but for example fonts/urw contains nothing but
subdirectories, urw-base35 is one of them.  Is it really needed that
these 3 times 35 font files are dispersed over 3 times 9 directories -
why not just have three?  I can imagine that the historical reason are
exactly all those virtual font files that are in the tpms for these
fonts, but not in urw-base35:  They would have made the urw-base35.tpm
very large, and they make some substructure necessary.

I'll try to find out what these other fonts are.  Is there a Web
interface to the old perforce repository, so that I can browse log
files?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0605032244160.8333@localhost.localdomain>


Hi,

Finally I found time to install TL2005 and I have a few questions 
that I would appreciate your comments about.

1.
I am trying to understand the purpose of the TEX*CONFIG trees. 
If this is a distribution related thing -- why not a VAR tree; if 
it's supposed to be persistant across years -- why not in a 
texmf-local.  Is there  something special in the output of 
texconfig-sys, updmap-sys and fmtutil-sys?  (I honestly don't 
know :-(

2.
What's the purpose of the SYSTEXMF variable (especially compared 
to TEXMF)?

3.
texmf.cnf includes the following lines; that's the only spot in 
which TEXFORMATS is mentioned.
<quote>
TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c
MFBASES = .;$TEXMF/web2c
MPMEMS = .;$TEXMF/web2c
TEXPOOL = .;$TEXMF/web2c
MFPOOL = .;$TEXMF/web2c
MPPOOL = .;$TEXMF/web2c
</quote>
Should have been perhaps like that?
TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c
MFBASES = $TEXFORMATS
MPMEMS = $TEXFORMATS
TEXPOOL = $TEXFORMATS
MFPOOL = $TEXFORMATS
MPPOOL = $TEXFORMATS

4.
It is mentioned in http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html that euclide 
is now obsolete.  I guess that the following sub-trees should be 
removed too?
texmf-dist/{source,doc}/latex/euclide}/
They probably don't harm anyone...


 	Thanks in advance

I suppose that Staszek has the same problems when he prepares binaries
which run with an ancient libc.

But do you need version control on these machines?  Suppose you have
the svn repository on your fastest machine and then copy the program
source tree and the texmf tree to the slow machine.  texmf-dist and
texmf-doc are not needed for compiling programs.  You can use 'svn
export' to extract a subtree, this tree will be clean, i.e. it will
not contain any .svn dirs.  If you are using NFS this is quite
convenient.

Before you change any files on the slow machine, create an empty file
somewhere (touch /tmp/tlsrc-timestamp). 

If you want to commit any changes, you can copy changed files back to
the repository on the fast machine:

  find /path/to/srcdir -newer /tmp/tlsrc-timestamp -exec cp ...

Then you can commit changed files from the fast machine.

If you want to test your binaries with real tex/latex files and macro
packages, you need texmf-dist as well.  But since you are testing
binaries, there is no need to update system-independent stuff at all.

I would not export the current texmf-dist from the repository to an
ancient machine.  It is sufficient to steal the much smaller
texmf-dist tree from teTeX or even install TL-2005 from the CD with
all the packages you don't need deselected in the install menu.

You can try:

    http://ms25.ath.cx/svnupdate

There is no manpage, please look into the source code.

There are two problems with this program:

  1. svnupdate creates a shell script ~/svncleanup which can be used
     to run 'svn cleanup' on the files or dirs updated by svnupdate.
     However, 'svn cleanup' requires a directory as an argument but
     not a file.  I'll fix this soon.

  2. When I press Control-C when the script is running, I'm not able
     to quit the script.  It seems that I quit a child process of it
     (subversion) instead.  I have no idea why this happens.  Maybe
     someone can enlighten me.

If you want to test svnupdate, you can replace 'BASE' (line 45) 

  open LOG, "svn log -vq -rBASE:HEAD $ENV{'TEXLIVE_SVN_ROOT'} |";

by an ancient revision number.  Subversion then thinks that the local
repository is at the revision number you inserted.  Karl started with
revision 1001.

The $dirlevel variable can be used to optimize performance.  It
determines how many slashes are needed within a path until svnupdate
updates complete directories instead of single files.

I fear that I cannot tell you an optimum value for this variable.  It
seems that, though I can update the whole tree faster than Staszek or
Werner, I need much more time to update a single file than they do.

When I run svnupdate in strace I have the impression that it takes a
considerable amount of time to connect to the server.  Don't know
why.  I don't have a nameserver on my machine, maybe this matters.

Also, the changes Karl made are not representative.  Many files had
been changed which are close to the root (READMEs, log files,...), but
when TL development starts more files near the leafs of the tree will
change.  Hence everybody has to tweak $dirlevel himself after TL
development started.

Staszek and Werner, how much time do you need to upgrade from revision
1001 to the current one using svnupdate?

Staszek, I still don't know why svn update sometimes gets the kill
signal and sometimes not.  To be able to exclude any problems with
your hardware, can you run memtest over night?

     http://www.memtest.org/

  Reinhard

Hi Frank,

Sorry, I'm pretty much at sea here as to exactly what problem you're
reporting, and hence what solution you're proposing.

- Ok, I missed the crucial word "metrics" at
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/psnfss.html.
  (I still fail to see any real reason why the type1's are separated
   into a different package from everything else -- doesn't Walter
   maintain it all?  But whatever.)

- It doesn't seem to me that we should remove arbitrarily many font
  files from TL just because they do not precisely correspond to
  directories on CTAN (if that's what you're saying).  That seems to me
  like it will cause nothing but trouble.  It is just as likely that the
  directories on CTAN should be more fully populated.

- I'm afraid I don't know what empty fonts/urw directory you're
  referring to.  In the TL repository, Master/fonts/tfm/urw has two
  subdirectories: antiqua and grotesk.  (As you probably know, those are
  original free fonts from URW, before they donated the 35.)  There is a
  sibling Master/fonts/tfm/urw35vf which has the base 35.

- I already explained why it's simplest/best if the tpm's are created by
  typeface, rather than by foundry.  (Because "public.tpm" doesn't sound
  like a good thing.)  I suppose a special case for generating
  urw35vf.tpm could be painfully programmed, but why?
  
- No real web interface was ever set up for the p4 repo, and I think the
  p4 server is offline right now anyway.  However, all the log messages
  (and changed file lists) are available in the current repo in
  Build/cdbuild/logs/log.*, which is web-browsable at
  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/cdbuild/logs/

I think I'm missing your basic goal -- what does it matter how big or
little any given tpm is (within reason)?  And why single out this
particular one for the base fonts?  What are you really trying to
accomplish?

Thanks,
Karl

Of, course there are many solutions and there are always workarounds.

My number of machines is not endless or even large and I wouldnot  
even have room for more. As it stands now, all my machines share /usr/ 
local and this includes /usr/local/perforce where I keep a p4 synced  
TL setup (three in fact, one for TL2003, one for TL2004 and one for  
TL2005 as I do also provide older TeX versions for those who need it  
(e.g. older projects that require TL2003 to compile)). This tree is  
shared and so are the Makefiles and script that do the builds. All  
machines can do p4 syncing so I can keep all the scripts and  
makefiles the same. The only thing that differs on the machines is  
for which platform is being built. If I do a "make tl2005-sync tl2005- 
build" on a OS X 10.3 system ppc, I get Darwin7 ppc binaries. If I do  
it on the 10.4 system intel, I get Darwin8 intel binaries.

After I have done something on one machine, I use rsync to sync /usr/ 
local to all others.

If I had to do p4 syncing on only one machine, it would be less  
comfortable than it is now. Instead of a simple "make sync build;  
rsync" I would have to do a "rsync, make sync, rsync, make build;  
rsync" on various machines.

On the surface, the problem is just that the tpm files for the base 35
fonts (avantgar.tpm, ...) contain files that are not (no longer?) on
CTAN, and I have not found the license information and (fontinst)
sources for them.  Whether this will just resolve into "Ah, here they
are", and if it will require any moves (or even removals), this I don't
know yet, and therefore I'm not proposing any solution.  

One other thing is that CTAN and TeXlive are inconsistent with respect
to file placement, but wether this is a problem I cannot tell.

I think the reason is pretty much the same why any two related packages
on CTAN are in different directories:  They are of different origin,
have different authors, and license.  And I don't know whether anybody
really maintains the urw35 base fonts, since I doubt they are
developed.  The Palatino replacement that Ralf and Walter are preparing
will get a new name, while the existing fonts will be unchanged, AFAIK.

No, I must have been unclear.  First of all, removal would only be an
option if we can't get any license info for them, *and* if the fontinst
script to recreate them is not trivial.  But I guess it would be.  

>   That seems to me

That's true, Walter is currently investigating some of the additional
files, and I'm sure he will comment on that soon.  But he has also
already said that he thinks it is unfortunate if the base35 packages in
texlive install additional TeX and LaTeX files that are neither in the
original urw-base35 distribution nor in psnfss.  I don't know his
reasons, but I guess one might be that he does not want people to expect
things from psnfss that it does not provide, and that he is not willing
to support.

So it might turn out that we keep these files were they are (and instead
update CTAN), or that we should consider to move them away from those
central packages to follow the wishes of the psnfss maintainer.  Let's
just wait for his answer; but in the meantime I'm searching for the
origin of those files.

> - I'm afraid I don't know what empty fonts/urw directory you're

I was referring to the directory on CTAN.  It seems I misunderstood you
when you said

,----

`----

This I parsed as "we couldn't make a urw-base35.tpm, because..."  but I
see that this meaning doesn't make sense.  Personally, I don't propose
anything yet, but from Walter's mail I conclude that he would probably
prefer a mapping

 ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/base35/ -> urw-base35.tpm

no matter whether the font files all end up in TEXMF/fonts/*/urw/ or in
subdirectories thereof, as it is currently.

>   In the TL repository, Master/fonts/tfm/urw has two

Yes, but Master/texmf-dist/fonts/{type1,afm}/urw also contains
subdirectories for the base25 fonts.  The corresponding tfm files seem
to be in adobe - no idea why.

>   original free fonts from URW, before they donated the 35.)  There is a

The last sentence is not the whole truth.  As I learned from Walter, the
files in urw35vf are *not* required to use the base35 fonts via psnfss -
the corresponding files are in fonts/tfm/adobe/.  The files in urw35vf
are the ones with "unknown origin".

I think here's a misunderstanding on your side.  On CTAN, we have in the
directory ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/urw/, without the zip
archives: 

drwxr-xr-x   2 85       34           4096 Nov 17  2005 antiqua
drwxr-xr-x   2 85       34           4096 Mar 21 14:06 arial
drwxr-xr-x   5 85       34           4096 Nov 17  2005 base35
lrwxrwxrwx   1 85       34             32 Feb  3  2005 garamond -> ../../nonfree/fonts/urw/garamond
drwxr-xr-x   2 85       34           4096 Nov 17  2005 grotesq
lrwxrwxrwx   1 85       34             36 Feb 11  2005 lettergothic -> ../../nonfree/fonts/urw/lettergothic

and TeXLive has antiqua.tpm and grotesq tpm which install files in
fonts/*/urw/antiqua and fonts/*/urw/grotesq, respectively.  The obvious
parallel would be to have base35.tpm (or urw-base35.tpm, as in the
Catalogue) which installs into fonts/*/urw/base35.  I guess this would
be in fact straightforward to program, *however* we'd loose the urw35vf
fonts which are not on CTAN - and we should investigate first whether
they should be added to the base35 directory on CTAN, or somewhere
else.

Ah, thanks, I'll look into this.

The size isn't the point, correspondance with CTAN is it.

As I pointed out above, it seems to me as if the base fonts are
currently singled out, in that the tpm structure doesn't correspond to
any CTAN structure at all.

> What are you really trying to accomplish?

Most importantly, just learn where these files come from and what their
license is.  If this also makes TeXlive structure clearer, and Walter
Schmidt happy, I'm glad about it.

BTW, I've recently submitted two new sets (with a different number of
glyphs) for the base 35 Adobe AFMs.  They have been contributed by
Adobe, with a very liberal license.  [The announcement on the ctan-ann
list is still missing for various reasons.]

Cool.

Any idea how these afm's compare to the actual URW Type 1's?  Would it
make sense to consider distributing these instead of whatever we have now?

I don't know if the afm's we distribute now correspond to the actual
Type 1's, for that matter.

Thanks,

if not, then we should live with that fact, since different afm's would mean different derived metrics and different rendering

I fully agree that it is a bad idea to use the Adobe metrics files for
the URW fonts.

Fact is that in TeXLive the font files in type1/adobe/courier don't
match the corresponding metrics files in afm/adobe/courier.  Just to
name an example: The glyph `zcaron' is available in the PFBs but is
represented with a `CC' command (building up a composite glyph).  This
is clearly wrong.

Message-ID: <200605042345.k44Nj5507855@f7.net>

Hello Itay,

    I am trying to understand the purpose of the TEX*CONFIG trees. 

texmf.cnf has these comments:
% TEXMFVAR, where texconfig stores variable runtime data.
% TEXMFCONFIG, where texconfig stores configuration data.

% TEXMFSYSVAR, where texconfig-sys stores variable runtime data.
% TEXMFSYSCONFIG, where texconfig-sys stores configuration data.

As I recall, TEXMF*VAR is stuff which might get written more or less at
any time, like .map and .fmt files (so I guess the comment above is not
the whole story, actually).  TEXMF*CONFIG is for stuff which is altered
only by running texconfig, like paper sizes and such.

This is (not very extensively) described in the TL documentation, FWIW ...

    Is there something special in the output of texconfig-sys,
    updmap-sys and fmtutil-sys?

Special in the output?  The difference between foo-sys and foo is
precisely and only whether foo{VAR,CONFIG} or fooSYS{VAR,CONFIG} is
altered.

    What's the purpose of the SYSTEXMF variable (especially compared 
    to TEXMF)?

As far as I can see, SYSTEXMF is not used any more.  I think it used to
be an abbreviation used elsewhere in texmf.cnf.  I hope no program uses
it directly.  Thomas?

    Should have been perhaps like that?
    TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c
    MFBASES = $TEXFORMATS
    ...

I suppose it could be done that way, but does it really matter?

    I guess that the following sub-trees should be 
    removed too?
    texmf-dist/{source,doc}/latex/euclide}/

Yes.

    They probably don't harm anyone...
    
Right.

Thanks,
Karl

there was a time that the adobe fonts were part of the programs they 
distributed but at some moment they disappeared; maybe on old  floppy 
collections ... (i recently trashed all our old stuff)

It can be fixed if dvips always downloads all fonts. There are still PS
printers with old versions of fonts which do not contain all accented
characters and composite glyphs must be used.

This is a different topic.  Distributing PFB's with wrong or
incomplete AFMs is simply bad.  At least there should be a note that
the available AFMs doesn't cover the complete glyph set available in
those notes.

Agreed.  I will insert such a note.

However, I cannot endeavor to track down precisely which pfb's we have
and find the afm's that correspond to them, etc., etc.  That's why I
wrote my previous message :).  If someone else is able to work on this,
great.  Seems related to Frank trying to track down exactly where all

As I understand it, paper sizes and such are configuration data 
that a user/administrator would probably like to persist between 
upgrades (the equivalent of *nix /etc ?) and not redo when a new 
texlive distribution comes out.  If true, then 
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local sounds to me like a more natural 
place for those, than /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-config/. But 
probably I miss here something about the functionality of 
texconfig-sys and friends.

Thanks for the rest of your comments.

I don't think you're missing anything.  I just don't think it would be
wise to assume by default that configuration files written in year X can
be used in years X+1, X+2, ..., indefinitely.  If you want to try it,
set TEXMFSYSCONFIG to the texmf-local directory, or wherever you want.
It's just the default ...

Personally, I install the full distribution from scratch each year.  It
takes about five minutes to run the installer and configuration scripts,
and 20 minutes to copy the files.  Not a big deal ...

Cheers,
Karl

I've already contacted Ken Lunde from Adobe, hoping for some
background information (and probably for the right AFMs).

You always have to download all fonts.  Kyocera printers have
Bitstream fonts built in as a replacement for the original Adobe fonts
with different metrics and completely different shapes.

The Bitstream Courier in Kyocera printers has the same problem as the
IBM Courier provided by X11:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/courier.pdf

You cannot distinguish between /quoteleft and /quoteright at normal
sizes (10pt...12pt).

  Reinhard

    The obvious parallel would be to have base35.tpm (or urw-base35.tpm,
    as in the Catalogue) which installs into fonts/*/urw/base35.  I
    guess this would be in fact straightforward to program,

It's not, because the cases are not parallel.  antiqua and grotesq are
fonts.  base35 is a collection of fonts.

There are many, many cases where TL structure is not the same as CTAN
structure.  This is one of them.  It doesn't make sense to me to move
away from fonts/FILETYPE/SUPPLIER/TYPEFACE in the texmf trees at this
late date (although it is not my favorite).

I certainly agree with the goals of making provenance clear,
corresponding with CTAN and/or the Catalogue wherever possible, and
keeping Walter as happy as possible :).  But I still can't see a
texmf-dist/tpm/urw-base35.tpm.

What I can imagine is:

- determining which of the base font files in TL really are on CTAN;
  hopefully the answer is "most".

- having a collection-urw-base35 which corresponds exactly to the CTAN
  files, if you want it.

- having the other assorted random files we have accumulated over the
  years separated out and/or copied back to CTAN and/or whatever is
  appropriate.

Meanwhile, I have a thousand other packages to update, so I'm going to
have this to you and anyone else who is interested to sort out.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Daniel,

    Is there any reason for which the section about compilation of binaries
    is missing in TL2005 (it was section 8 in TL2004)?

As I recall, it seemed to be getting stale, and no one ever wrote about
it, so I just commented it out instead of updating it.

    A user of an HPUX 11 Itanium systesm is willing to compile the binaries
    for his machine, and asks for help on how to proceed.

1) Unpack the source.tar.bz2 file that's in the distribution.
2) Run the Build script in the top-level dir.  I strongly advise GNU
   make and gcc.
3) if all goes well, the result will an inst/ subdir, with the binaries
   in inst/bin/somearchname.
4) copy those binaries to the installed TL tree in bin/archname, put
   that dir in your PATH, and see if they work, e.g., run latex sample2e
   and pdflatex sample2e.
5) if all is well, then tar up the directory and I will put it on the
   web site.  If s/he's willing to do it in general, we can easily
   enable support in the installation scripts, can discuss the specific
   archname, etc.

The most problematic question will be whether the Build actually works
or if portability problems will appear.

Thanks,
Karl

teh tex related programs that deal with reading lines should not be sensitive to line endings (unix, dos, mac), so best fix the programs (afaik pdftex can handle all variants); it also vaoids the discussion on what line-ending is best and what to use

hm, t5 is pretty base or at leas not less base than ec, texnansi or qx  so i opt for removing the second one (or actually the whole vntex path then)

    hm, t5 is pretty base or at leas not less base than ec, texnansi or
    qx so i opt for removing the second one (or actually the whole vntex
    path then)

The question of in which directory a given.enc should appear is not a
matter of how important it is.  It is a matter of what packages (if any)
it's maintained in.

"base" really just means "catchall".  The .enc files in base/ are there
mostly because I copy them there from fontname (and copy them to
fontname when I find them).  Otherwise many of them would not be in the
distribution at all.

I believe the master copy of t5.enc is part of vntex, at least, that is
what the file itself says.  So fine, makes sense to me to remove the
copy in base.

Thanks,
k

    Some lines in texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map have a trailing
    `^M'.  This is probably a bad idea...

I've noticed that too.  The global files are created by inserting files
straight from the original packages.  Sure, it would be possible to
strip ^M's, but since they cause no apparent harm, I didn't bother to
suggest/implement it.

The reason it is in the vntex directory is that it is part of vntex.

We'll keep the file in the vntex distribution because some people
might want to install vntex on a system where t5.enc doesn't exist yet.

Quoted from the kpathsea info page:

      If none of the options below are enabled, `mktexpk', `mktextfm', and
    `mktexmf' follow the following procedure to decide where fonts should
    be installed.  Find the tree where the font's sources are, and test the
    permissions of the `fonts' directory of that tree to determine whether
    it is writable.  If it is, put the files in the tree in appropriate
    locations.  If it isn't writable, see whether the tree is a system tree
    (named in `SYSTEXMF').  If so, the `VARTEXFONTS' tree is used.  In all
    other cases the working directory is used.

Yes, of course.  I don't expect anything to happen unless I propose at
least a detailed solution, if not a tested patch.

Searching in the internet I've actually found the missing AFMs

IBM Courier!  They should be renamed to `ncr*.pfb' and moved to
fonts/type1/ibm/courier (Walter Schmidt has already suggested the
renaming more than two years ago on the TEX-D-L list).

Good news!  Where did you find that, and is there a license statement?
I guess they are among the fonts donated to the X consortium?

I searched in google for `IBM Courier 001.003'.

BTW, at least one of them (Courier) is already on CTAN:

That doesn't sound good:

Hello,
I'm using TL2005 on Windows, and I've have a problem with windvi
when my .tex file includes a command such as \usepackage(times} or
\usepackage{palatino).
windvi can't make the screen fonts, and the headings (bold) don't
show up. The normal (roman) text does appear, but it appears that
windvi is substituting cm in this case. (The .ps file and the .pdf
file look fine.) 
In TL2003, the last version I was using, windvi didn't have this
problem.

Below is a short test file, and I'm attaching the windvi log file.
Among other things, the log file indicates that it can't find gs. So
I manually added gs to my path, but that didn't help.
Any ideas?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{palatino}
\begin{document}
\section{this is a section head}
Some text here.
\subsection{A subsection heading}
More text here.
\end{document}

-Harriet

PS I also don't have ImageMagick. I didn't see a place during the
installation where I could select that. Does anyone know how to
select that while installing?

I even doubt that someone really wants to use these fonts.  Typewriter
fonts are good for nothing else but typesetting computer programs.

But in IBM Courier you cannot distinguish between /quoteleft and
/quoteright at normal sizes (10pt...12pt).  This makes it useless. 

See: http://ms25.ath.cx/courier.pdf

  Reinhard

    Can't locate Ghostscript ! Exiting ... 

FWIW, this seems to come down to the Windows-specific gs_locate function
called from gsftopk.c:

#else /* WIN32 */

	if (gs_locate() == NULL) {
	  fprintf(stderr, "\nCan't locate Ghostscript ! Exiting ...\n");
	  return EXIT_FAILURE;
	}
...

However, I could not quickly find the source for gs_locate, which would
(hopefully) help guess what the problem might be.  Apparently having a
gs.exe in PATH is not sufficient ...

    They should be renamed to `ncr*.pfb' and moved to
    fonts/type1/ibm/courier

Except if they don't allow modification, we should delete them.
(Even aside from the quoteleft/quoteright issue.)

So does that leave us with URW Courier?  Or didn't Bitstream (or someone
else) donate a Courier at some point?  What's best?

    (Walter Schmidt has already suggested the renaming more than two
    years ago on the TEX-D-L list).

What is TEX-D-L?

Are you sure you need .dvi support?  It seems to be fragile.  In many
cases .pdf will easier to get working and we get nifty tools from
people outside the overworked TeX maintainer community.

I'm pretty sure I selected ghostscript when I first installed TL2005
on Win32 using the GUI, but if you can find the .zip files on the CD
you can just unpack them (and maybe set GS_LIB).  After examining
where the ghostscript bits were stored, I overwrote them with the
current AFPL version.  I also replaced windvi with a batch file that
runs dviout, which seems to be maintained and is very flexible (e.g.,
RTFM is vital).  I have ImageMagick installed separately, so I'm not
sure if it was in TL2005.  At some point I also ran into problems with
the version of perl in TL2005, so I also installed ActiveState perl. 
I think the lesson is that the TL community can't keep up with the 3rd
party tools.  On WinXP the installers are pretty robust.  Perl,
ghostscript, and imagemagick are often used by tools (inkscape) other
than TeXLive.  Since the TeX community uses these apps on a variety of
platforms, TeX isn't as fussy as some other apps that expect a current
version of the tools.

The only serious project I've done on Win32 was a book originally
formatted with Y&Y plain tex.  Many of the figures weren't EPS files,
although they has .eps names.  It was easier to render then to PDF
than to make them into proper EPS.  As a result I've only viewed a few
.dvi files (but one was the comprehensive fonts document, which is my
fonts "stess" test).

It's certainly the best solution.

At the Bachotex conference Hans, Jerzy, and Volker introduced the "New
Font Project".  The idea is that Jacko creates new fonts using
MetaType1:

 1. The standard URW fonts (except Symbol and ZapfDingbats).

 2. Bitstream Charter and Vera.

 3. Adobe Utopia.

 4. URW Garamond and Letter Gothic.

Hence we will get a Courier (which will certainly/hopefully not be
called Courier) which will be much better than everything you can buy
today.  At least Jacko's fonts will support much more languages.  And
these fonts will have a copyright which is acceptable even for Debian
people.

Ralf Stubner creates new fonts based on URW Palatino using fontforge.
I fear that the projects overlap, but if Jacko doesn't plan to create
expert fonts (don't know) then it would be nice if Ralf could provide
them.

Hence I'm quite optimistic that people can live without IBM Courier.

Regards,
  Reinhard

ImageMagick depends on a lot of external libraries.  I think that
integrating it into TL consumes too much time.

I hope that TeXLive-2006 will include sam2p.

  http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p

sam2p can convert plenty of bitmap formats to EPS or PDF.  It is
incredibly fast and produces extremely small files without loss of
quality.

It would be nice if you could provide some details.  Maybe it can be
fixed in TL-2006.

  Reinhard

Not necessarily.  They are quite fine to name files and email

Anyway, I fully agree that those fonts should be removed from TeX-Live
(or at least renamed).

Yes, and Walter and Ralf are creating a new Palatino, FPL-Neu, as you

we should not remove things too easy; next year there will be 
replacements for those fonts (outcome of the open type font project) and 
then many of the old fonts can go; let's not create gaps in the 
collection of fonts that users expect to be present

Yes, I do - and I can add an other reason:  psnfss uses the URW fonts as
the standard Base35 set.

Is any macro package (or map file?) actually using these fonts, or can
they only be accessed with low-level font commands?

you seen them being used in documents (often in combination with other fonts in funny relative scaling) 

nowadays hardly any tex user uses low level font commands; context ships with the neccessary code to use those uwr fonts, so i expect usage

I don't understand the last conclusion - if context uses URW "courier"
by default, why do you expect that IBM Courier (currently
misnamed/mis-sorted as Adobe Courier) is used?

Dear authors of the CS PS fonts!

You are listed in license.eng from the cstex package as authors of the
CSfonts. While analyzing the license/source situation of teTeX and TeX
live for Debian, we found that the following files:
	ntimes.sty
 	nhelvet.sty
	cspsfont.{il2,tex,xl2}
contain the follwoing statement:
-----------------
%% The original source files were:
%% 
%% cspsfont.doc  (with options: `fonts,IL2')
%% 
%% IMPORTANT NOTICE:
%% 
%% For the copyright see the source file.
%% 
%% You are *not* allowed to modify this file.
%% 
%% You are *not* allowed to distribute this file.
%% For distribution of the original source see
%% the terms for copying and modification in the file  cspsfont.doc.
---------------

Unfortunately file cspsfont.doc is nowhere to be found, and the license
statement given in these files don't allow distribution/modification, so
they wouldhave to be removed from TeX live and teTeX (at least for
Debian).

Could you please clarify this situation for us, and preferably/if
possible also provide the original cspsfont.doc file?

Thanks a lot from the (Debian) teTeX and (Debian) TeX live people

The problems were building R-2.3.0rc, which uses a number of perl
scripts in the build process.   I didn't really investigate beyond
disabling TL perl in favor of the current Active State perl.  I
suspect most TeX Live users will install the TL version that is
current when they get a new computer and keep it until they upgrade
the computer or finish the book, whichever comes first.  When perl was
harder to install without conflicts (e.g., win9x), it made sense to
include it in TeX Live.   These days perl is easy to install, so the
potential for conflicts outweighs the small benefits of a bundled
perl.  The same is true of ghostscript and ImageMagick.

I suppose it would help to have a short chapter in the installation
manual that discusses the generic tools used by TL.  Except on Win32,
these are generally assumed to be available from the OS packager.  For
Win32, effort spent on improving the installer has greater benefit
than providing tools that are readily available elsewhere.  The
installer could even make suggestions: "Hmmm, I can't seem to find
perl on your system.  It is recommended that you install perl ver XX
from one of the following sites..."

These files were created by me. I took a few words from LaTeX license and
did not care much about it. File cspsfont.doc contains documentation and
my intention was to force everyone to install the package himself/herself
by running docstrip. It now seems not practical but I am sort of
disapointed that the file disappeared from the doc directory. I hope I
find it in my private archive.

Moreover, I have just looked at the CSTeX license and it says that it is
GPL. It might be useful to change the license of these files. I created
the files so that they can be freely used and included in TeX
distributions.

I have found my private copy of cspsfont.doc and now I understand why it
disappeared. It is written in Czech in 1995 and modified in 1998. I do not
remember details but now it seems to me that I gave the generated files
for testing and planned to provide the documentation later and forgot to
do it. I know that some bugs were fixed in the generated files later so
distribution of my ancient cspsfont.doc will not be a good idea. I will do
my utmost to resolve the license problem.

Debian?  If this license statement were correct, they would have to be
removed not only from Debian, and not only from teTeX and TeX Live, but
also from CTAN - if distribution is not allowed, it's not allowed.

However, I'm confident this is not intended, and the upstream authors
will be able to clarify this.

It is a long time since I made these files and the whole package is now
maintained by others. However, I managed to find other files. As a matter
of fact, cspsfont.doc does not contain any license at all. I have GPL
version 2, June 1991 in the same directory. Probably I chose it because
authors of other parts of CSTeX used it. The installation script,
cspsfont.ins, does not contain any license either. Thus the message is the
default from docstrip because I did not redefine it.

As far as translation is concern, I do not think that it would be
appreciated. I liked the tool 11 years ago when I created because
development was easier for me than studying fontinst. I am afraid that
translation of this obsolete tool is just waisting time and the only
meaningful solution is to change the copyright of generated files.

There are several solutions: get the other authors to agree to release
the generated files under a different license.  Reimport the changed
edited files into the source file and distribute that (depends on the
agreement of the editor of the changed files, but considering that he
has been in violation of the license, this should probably be easy to
assure), Czech or not.  Add a notice that translations would be very
much appreciated.

Stuff like that.

Sounds good, but experience has shown that it takes some years to work
out all the glitches in new fonts.  Hopefully much of this experience
has been incorporated in the software, but
all those people who have been texing away on their books will not
want to change until the fonts have been around for a while.

Maybe, but many people think they have been using "Adobe Courier" all
these years when they have really been seeing URW NimbusMonL.  If you
tell them you are gettng rid of IBM Courier they will say "IB Who? --
Just don't mess with my Adobe fonts!".   OTOH, there are lots of
people asking for fonts that look better than Courier for URL's, code
listings, etc.

Even when people are writing in English they want fonts that support
their native language, and it can be very confusing when they all
think they are using Adobe Courier, Adobe Helvetica, Adobe Times, etc.
yet are seeing very different looking output.  So what is needed from
new fonts?

1.  free in the Debian sense so everyone can have them
2.  more languages so almost eveyone can use them
3.  better appearance so everyone will be glad to dump Courier
4.  new names not aliased to Adobe names so people understand what
they are really using
5.  TeX support so everyone can use them  -- including a "plain"
format with the new fonts
preloaded.

Thanks for giving this your attention and for your replies. I
appreciate your help. I have to confess that I tried again to add
"c:\gs\gs8.15\bin" to my path and it mostly works now.  I must have
screwed up somehow the first time. But windvi doesn't behave the way
it used to-- it used to display everything after a slight delay
while it built the fonts. Now it builds them, but then can't find
them at first and won't display them until after closing windvi and
reopening.

Karl, your idea about looking into the Windows-specific gs_locate
function sounds very promising. But I searched my computer for any
file containing "gs_locate" and came up empty. So I didn't continue
:-(

Well, I really like the quick preview. But my preferences aside,
there are many LaTeX users at this university who have always used a
previewer, and it would be a massive education project for me to
persuade them all to use pdflatex and preview with Acrobat (or
GSView, which doesn't need to be closed between runs). So I'd prefer
to be able to offer a dvi previewer, although I know windvi is no
longer maintained and its days may be numbered.

I did not select gs during install because the version (7.07) is
old. Then after the TL install, I installed current versions of gs
and gsview. Maybe that's why it doesn't work for me. (Does the above
example preview properly for you? Maybe I need to look into dviout.
Haven't heard of it before.)
Perhaps if I'd installed gs *before* installing TL2005, windvi would
have been able to find it? Seems odd that windvi would have a
hard-wired location for gs. But if it's easy for you, could you tell
me where you installed the current gs? (I'm reluctant to uninstall
TL and reinstall because I did that on another computer and now I
can't reinstall. The installer thinks it's still there and comes up
with the "remove installation" window. But the remove procedure
fails because it can't find some files.)

I can certainly understand and accept that. I was just asking
because it was included in previous Windows TL distributions.

samp2p sounds really good!

Thanks, Karl, when I get a little time, I'll look at it. I'm curious
as to how it's defined.

My system does the same thing.

Dviout appears to be actively maintained.  I think the authors are in
Japan, but there are english docs.  I got it from CTAN.  It didn't
handle your example, even though the fonts had been created by windvi,
because it wants "pplb7t" instead of "pplb8r" (different encodings).

The installer makes minimal changes other than the files it installs.  Check for
environment variables.  I have TLROOT and TEXMFCNF set ATM, but I have
may have added TEXMFCNF later to work around some glitch.  [I
currently have Cygwin tetex and w32tex on the same PC (looking for
something that would format the book that was working with Y&Y TeX). 
Each distro barfed on a different list of issues.  ]

I already had GS installed to "C:\Program Files\gs\gs8.53", but I
copied the files into the appropriate places in the TL tree:

C:\Program Files\gs\gs8.53\bin\* --> C:\TeXLive2005\bin\win32
C:\Program Files\gs\gs8.53\lib\* --> C:\TeXLive2005\xemtex\gslib
C:\Program Files\gs\fonts\* --> C:\TeXLive2005\xemtex\gsfonts

Then set:

GS_LIB=C:\TeXLive2005\xemtex\gsfonts;C:\TeXLive2005\xemtex\gslib

This is way too much hassle, but I was pretty sure it would work.  The
proper approach would be to check what is in the TL's ghostscript
archives and try adjusting the PATH to use the existing gs.

I recommend samp2p, but the version on CTAN is old.  I compiled from
the sources on the author's site, along with his tif22 stuff.

This sort of interface needs to be documented.  Many tools rely on
ghostscript, and I'll wager that they don't all look for it the same
way.  On Win9x you couldn't expect every 3rd party tool to have a
separate entry in the PATH because there were hard limits (at least in
some apps).   Some perl scripts search the PATH for
likely names:

>From pdfcrop.pl we get:
### string constants for Ghostscript run
# get Ghostscript command name
my $GS = "gs";
$GS = "gs386"    if $^O =~ /dos/i;
$GS = "gsos2"    if $^O =~ /os2/i;
$GS = "gswin32c" if $^O =~ /mswin32/i;
$GS = "gswin32c" if $^O =~ /cygwin/i;

This list is missing "gsc", the linux shared library eqivalent to
gswin3c.  I'm pretty sure there are Win32 apps that find ghostscript
via the registry, as only TeX seems to need  the gs binaries to be
found via the PATH.

What I would like to see (once the Win9x diehards switch to linux):

1.  a list of 3rd party tools that may be needed in order to use TL. 
Which tools are required will depend on the actual tasks to be
performed:

    Utilities:
       GNUWin32: sed, awk, tar, pax, bzip2, zip, ...

    Image processing:
       ImageMagick
       Ghostscript
       samp2p and tif22

    Interpreted languages:
       Perl
       tk/tcl
       ruby
       lua

     Editor that supports TeX:
        Emacs or Xemacs, ...

     File viewers:
       Adobe Reader
       GSview or evince or ...
       Web browser

2.  the standard way these tools are used is via the PATH, using
OS-dependent names, but otherwise the same code on unix/linux/Win32. 
[could win9x still be supported with batch files or .exe covers in the
bin/win32 directory?]

3.  tools that use utilities from the above list should indicate when
a failure results from not finding the required tool with a suitable
configuration, e.g.:

  XXX: unable to locate a working <YYY>.  This is a 3rd party tool
that should be available for installation using your package manager
(linux) or as a self-installing archive (OS X or Win32) from CTAN.  In
some cases failures may result if the installed version of <YYY> is an
old version or was not configured to enable <feature> required by
<XXX>.

or
  XXX: unable to locate a working <YYY>.  Except on Win32 this is a
standard tool that should have been installed with your OS.   It is
highly likely that your OS installation is damaged.  On Win32 a
self-installing archive can be downloaded from CTAN or the GNUWin32
site.

Have there been any news on the licensing front? Utopia as well as the
URW fonts from GhostPCL are *not* DFSG free. Utopia does not even allow
derived versions.

I *may* have (good) news from Adobe on the licensing of Utopia next
week.  We'll see.  Don't get your hopes up yet :).

As for the GhostPCL fonts, based on past discussions with Peter Deutsch,
I rather doubt they will ever be released under a free license.  I have
no contacts at URW to even ask.  (If anyone else does, please do write
them if you are so inclined.)

Why does the license matter?  Jacko creates some shapes from scratch
which have noting to do with Adobe Utopia, only the metrics will be
compatible.

Really? I had the impression they wanted to use pf2mt1 to translate the
Type 1 fonts to metatype1 format and then work from that. But I might
have got that wrong.

Recreating all the glyphs in metatype1 without using the existing glyphs
sounds like an awfull lot of work. Whether or not that is legally and
morally ok is a different question.

Interesting. I don't think windvi has changed in a couple of years,
I wonder why the behavior changed. But this is a lot better than not
building the fonts at all!

Thank you for this! I removed TLROOT from the environment variables,
and then TL2005 came up with the install window (instead of the
uninstall window). 
So I installed again, and answered a few of my questions:

Having gs 8.15 already installed does not help. Windvi does not find
it; it can't  build PS fonts or display included eps files. (Karl: I
haven't had a chance to examine gs_locate yet-- still intend to do
so.)

I found the first copy is all that's needed-- the bin files. After
doing this, Windvi could display eps files and build PS screen fonts
(but not display them at first). (Adding the gs bin directory to the
path also works.)

It does seem harsh that updating GS should break Windvi.

Another thing I found on my reinstall:
I used the tlpmgui-1.13.exe (the newest), which is documented to
have fixed the problem with the texmf-var tree being read-only.
However, I found that not to be the case. The files are still RO for
me.

Message-ID: <200605112128.k4BLShY20670@tug.org>

While installing TeX Live 2005 on Solaris 8 I found that the "tar cf - filename" commands failed. It seems this may be a syntax that GNU tar understands but that Solaris tar does not. The installation failed when run with a default root login shell. I was able to work around the problem by using a root login with the PATH modified to prefer GNU tar. An enhancement to the installer would be to warn the user if GNU tar is necessary and not found, or to use a syntax of tar that is compatible across both versions. I would be happy to assist with such a change if someone could let me know which source to review. Additionally it may be helpful to others to post this work-around on http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html.

Hi Donald,

    While installing TeX Live 2005 on Solaris 8 I found that the "tar cf
    - filename" commands failed. It seems this may be a syntax that GNU
    tar understands

That syntax is universal among every tar ever written, as far as I know.
Unless POSIX and Solaris have stupidly stopped supporting it, which is
possible, I suppose.  But Solaris 8 is old enough that I don't think
that should be the issue.

Perhaps something else is going on.  With the failing configuration (ie,
the default PATH, could you run 
  OVERRIDE_DEBUG=true; export OVERRIDE_DEBUG
  /bin/sh -vx install-live.sh

(Or install-compr.sh, whichever one you used.)

The output will be extremely voluminous.  Please do it in an Emacs M-x
shell buffer or typescript or some other way where you can save it all.
Just do the minimal steps to exhibit the failing tar, and then send me
the output.  There's no rush, it'll be a few days before I can look at
it anyway.

Ok?

Thanks for the report.

Karl

It shouldn't even be that. I just logged onto an antique SunOS 4.1.3
system, and that syntax works just fine.

Have you typed that command at the console, and what exact error
message does it give? Does it work if you type
/usr/bin/tar cf - filename

Options are usually preceded by a hyphen, i.e. regular syntax would be
tar -cf filename
I remember from one textbook on Linux that GNU tar unklike other versions
does not need the hyphen so that tar cf filename works. Isn't it possible
that you have tar that requires hyphens? I had such tar in OS/2, now I
have GNU tar.

I do read carrefully but have nothing to say, about windvi stuff which I 
never use. Sorry for silence. I'll try to find out what is going on with 
  RO problem (I'm afraid Tomek ?uczak -- the author of gui installer --

I have run the TeX Live 2005 installer with the OVERRIDE_DEBUG environment variable set to true on Solaris 8 using a default root login shell as per Karl Berry's instructions.  This produced an impressive amount of debugging information.  I trimmed the output to the lines I believe may be relevant and pasted them below.

My interpretation of the output is that I was incorrect in my assumption that the tar syntax was invalid.  My guess now is that the $TARPROG variable is not being set.  Additionally I see a line that sets tarverbose=v.  Based on this, the error should be "sh: xvf: not found," however the "v" is missing.  This indicates that the tarverbose variable assignment may not be working either.  I started the installer with "# /bin/sh -vx install-tl.sh" so I am confident it ran under the Solaris 8 default shell. I also find in the output that "TARPROG=tar" and "TAROPT=".

What is your interpretation?

When I updated the repository today I saw that a package had been
updated. I don't know whether this had been done for testing only.

Before anything is updated, I think that we should make a decision
first whether we stay with p4 or move to svn.

I fear that svn had not been tested extensively yet.  What I and
Staszek had done so far is to try to update from rev1001 to the
current revision using my script.  But only a few files had been
changed between these revisions.  A more natural test would be
updating the lm fonts, for instance.

Karl, can you save the current state of the repository (svnadmin dump)
so that we can use the repository as a sandbox for a couple of days?

It would be bad if we make a decision now and run into problems later.

For me it doesn't matter very much which tool we use.  I don't have
any experience with p4.  It seems that some people are not completely
convinced that it is the best solution, but I don't know the reason.
I have the impression that people who are using svn for other projects
like it very much.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I don't really have a say in this because i'm not a heavy user of the 
repository, but at bachotek i got the impression that under the current 
conditions (hardware, connections, etc) svn is not a solution that works 
well in all places, esp Staszek had problems with synchronizing svn that 
he didn't have before with p4. So, the question is: who are the most 
important users and what are their experiences so far. I also understood 
that dante is willing to continue any sponsoring of P4 that is needed, 
so ...

Subject: [tex-live] bringing xetex to texlive
Message-ID: <AB99F4A3-7CD9-4C25-89A3-26FF3368372F@sil.org>

I'd like to work towards getting the XeTeX project (derivative of e- 
TeX with Unicode and OpenType support) integrated into TeX Live, so  
that it can be built and installed as a standard part of TL. An  
experimental version of XeTeX is now working on various Linux and  
other Unix-like systems, in addition to the original OS X platform,  
so I think it's time to make it part of the mainstream TeX distribution.

To do this, I'll need to update the XeTeX code (it's currently based  
on a year-old snapshot of sources from TL), and then it needs to be  
integrated into the main Web2C configuration and build process. Most  
of the code lives in its own xetexdir directory under texk/web2c, but  
there are of course a few changes to shared files in web2c/lib, etc.,  
so special care will be needed here to ensure that nothing else is  
affected. (E.g., there will be new #ifdef XETEX sections in files  
such as texmfmem.h and texmfmp.c.)

In addition to the xetex program itself, there will be a couple of  
output drivers to convert its "extended DVI" format to PDF: xdv2pdf  
(for OS X only, dependent on Mac OS X APIs), and xdvipdfmx, an  
extended version of dvipdfmx (for other platforms). The latter may  
eventually be merged back into the main dvipdfmx project, but for the  
time being it is an experimental extension.

Looking forward to hearing from you -- thanks!

Hi Jonathan,

    I'd like to work towards getting the XeTeX project (derivative of e- 
    TeX with Unicode and OpenType support) integrated into TeX Live

Very exciting!  Thanks.

Now that xetex is multiplatform, I wonder if, in the fullness of time,
the xetex extensions can be integrated with the pdftex extensions
(present and future).  I doubt it's the easiest thing technically, but
it seems there may be some overlap in functionality.

    on a year-old snapshot of sources from TL), 

I don't think you'll find much has changed.

    there are of course a few changes to shared files in web2c/lib, etc.,  

FYI, the original source for web2c remains on Olaf's private machines.
It's fine to check in changes to TL, Olaf checks back and forth, but it
would be good to communicate changes in the shared files on
tex-k at tug.org, maybe even before checking them in.

    The latter may eventually be merged back into the main dvipdfmx
    project

I hope so.  There are too many dvi-to-pdf variants already.  The
dvipdfmx maintainers have been pretty responsive.

    Looking forward to hearing from you -- thanks!

Thank you, Jonathan.  I haven't written much about the TL build
structure, although there are terse hints scattered about in various
README files.  Let me/us know when questions ...

Happy hacking,
Karl

That's certainly a worthwhile goal; if some day pdftex has sufficient  
Unicode and OpenType support that xetex becomes obsolete, that'll be  
fine with me! :) And if sharing ideas and code can help that to  
happen, great. XeTeX was created as an independent extension using  
the techniques that I felt would enable me to achieve useful  
functionality most easily and quickly, and allow me to experiment  
freely within a system that I understood, but as things mature,  
convergence with pdftex would be wonderful.

Of course, it'll be a while before I have anything to check in  
anyhow, as I'll need to bring everything up-to-date locally first.

OK, that's good to know. I've just sent a subscription request to tex-k.

I hope so too, and Chof and I were thinking in that direction from  
the start. But at this point, we need to have an experimental test- 
bed for the xetex extensions, without destabilizing the main dvipdfmx  
driver. It's early days yet....

    who are the most important users 

Last year, my impression was that Staszek and I probably made over 90%
of the commits between the two of us.

    and what are their experiences so far.

As I've told Staszek several times :), there is no question that he
*needs* to be happy and be able to work efficiently.  Otherwise it is
hard to imagine TL ever being released.  His latest response to me was
that he was ok with going forward with svn.

I don't think there is anything endemic to svn which makes it unusable.
I hope the problems which Staszek has reported have mostly been
overcome.  Given access to his machine, I think Reinhard, I, or others
would have shot at debugging if things get bad again.  

(After all, one of the advantages of svn is that far more people in our
world have experience with it than p4; another advantage is that the
source is available, so what is actually happening can be determined and
not just guessed at.)

Anyway, to reiterate for the umpteenth time: if Staszek wants to move
back to p4, then I am perfectly happy to discuss that.  Otherwise, my
preference is to move forward with svn, for all the reasons I've written
about before.

    When I updated the repository today I saw that a package had been
    updated. I don't know whether this had been done for testing only.

It was somewhat of a test, but it was a real update, too.

    A more natural test would be updating the lm fonts, for instance.

In terms of getting experience with svn, I wouldn't recommend updating
lm as a first update.  I doubt anything good could come of that.  Doing
something smaller would be better; once success and familiarity have
been achieved there (maybe they already have, I'm not sure how much you
and Staszek have done), *then* try something as big as lm.

Since svn's operating model is so different from p4's, I am sure there
will be many points of confusion along the way.  Procedures will have to
be adjusted.  Just have to take a deep breath, \relax, and understand
what's happening.

    Karl, can you save the current state of the repository (svnadmin dump)
    so that we can use the repository as a sandbox for a couple of days?

I can do that if and when Staszek or you or anyone is ready to do some
major sandboxing, but I don't just want to shut things down indefinitely
without something more firm.  I hope to make some more updates this
weekend, for example.  And anyway, it should be quite feasible to
recover from anything that happens in error, svnadmin dumps or not.

Uff, I've just updated lm fonts (#1581). The whole commit took ~40min,
not counting my preparation (I have no time nor experience to write
scripts for what was added, deleted or only updated).

I'm not so happy with svn, but ok, let's use it and start regular work.

Best,

as karl reported a while ago: they don't respond and don't seem too 
interested, not even for a project as larg eas tex live

(btw, this is one reason why there is a market for p4: if one's workflow

is there a way to measure the bottleneck?

e.g. is subversion using compression like rsync does when sending files?

Ugh.  Then the only motivation for using Subversion as opposed to p4
appears to be that developers need not worry about proprietary
clients, making TeXlive potentially open to more active contributors.

If the bug reports end in the bin, using Subversion does nothing to
aid its development also for other developers.  So it is not a choice
benefiting Subversion, regardless of how desirable this would be.

I have no idea what the problem in communication is, whether the
report has been too vague or anything like that.  If Subversion can be
told to produce debug output, sending in a detailed report of what
Subversion has been spending its resources on during such an operation
might help.

Could be required on either side of the connection.

In any case, if the numbers are drastically different from some other
system doing the same work, this should be reported as a problem to
Subversion developers.  After all, they have an interest to get their
software ready for large real-life applications.

But in the mean time, more bandwidth/computing power could shift the
balance from the current behavior into more tolerable ranges for core
developers.  It should be a temporary measure in order to keep TeXlive
going while Subversion catches up.

I assume the lm fonts update has .pfb files.  SVN's check for binary
that looks in first 1024 bytes might be confused by .pfb files.  Do
you need keyword substitutions in the pfb files?
This is mentioned in the FAQ, but I'm not entirely sure what is done
at commit time and
what is done at checkout time.

Can you do some basic checks for network problems:

1) traceroute, etc.
2) try using numeric IP addresses and putting the IP and hostname in /etc/hosts
    to rule out DNS problems

When I view this thread with gmail, there are lots of "sponsored
links" offering
support for subversion.  This might indicate that configuring
subversion needs incantations known only to a few "experts", or just a
symptom of popularity among relatively clueless sites.  If any of the
people selling subversion support/incantations and spells are looking
to distinguish themselves from the pack, they could donate services to
make Staszek happy
in return for some mention in the documentation.

Hi, and forgive my poor english ^^

I'm trying since yesterday to install texlive 2005 from DVD on a
sparc/solaris environment.
Unfortunately, the first time I tried to install, i got the message :

sh : xf : file not found


The fact is that the variable $TARPROG is not set while
executing the line number 309 of the file install-tl.sh
causing the message below.

I succeded to install by replacing $TARPROG by string "tar" ;)

I hope this will be usefull for other users

    SVN's check for binary that looks in first 1024 bytes might be
    confused by .pfb files.

No.  Svn treats them (and everything, by default) as binary.

   Do you need keyword substitutions in the pfb files?

No.  There is no keyword substitution unless you ask for it.
(And no, of course we don't need it.)

    1) traceroute, etc.

Yes.  A traceroute would be useful.

    This might indicate that configuring subversion needs incantations
    known only to a few "experts",

I can't imagine what this might refer to.  Svn installation is
transparent.  This is not Microsoft.  Please don't spread this fear,
uncertainty, and doubt.

Anything's possible.  I'm just taking the output from  svn log  as it
comes.  It would be easy enough to split it at a blank line and
transpose, well, except the first line should stay first.  Maybe you'd
like to hack this?  Build/tools/svnchangelog ...

I think I said they do "respond", I should have anyway.  I do get an
answer.  What I don't get is instant code changes, which is
understandable, since usually I'm reporting infelicities about making
the Windows/Unix eol settings, importing vast masses of files, etc.
Fairly substantial new features, not simple bugs.  I don't think I've
encountered an actual bug yet.

    dk> Then the only motivation for using Subversion 

That was the main motivation but not the only one.  It is also something
of a pain to renew the license every year (and to lose all access
without the damn license).  And to not have the sources, for full
debugging on occasion.  And I find svn documentation rather more
understandable than p4.

    e.g. is subversion using compression like rsync does when sending files?

Good question.  Sadly, using svnserve (which seemed like by far the best
choice to me), it seems the answer is no.  The word "compress" does not
appear in the sources, and the msgs I found online all say no.

I will see if I can get Staszek set up to try using svn+ssh, which can
support compression (since ssh does).  Then we can see if that will help
substantially.

It seems that the bottleneck is the hard disk.  svn checks which files
have to be updated or which files conflict.

Thomas told me that you have to tell p4 in advance which files you
want to edit while svn finds changed files itself.  It scans the whole
tree therefore.  This makes it slower.

A good test is to run

  time svn status <repos>

which takes 1m32.483s (no network access required) here.  I expect
that Staszek needs at least 20 minutes.

I have a new 250GB S-ATA disk which is quite fast.  When I run svn
update twice, the second time I hear that svn is accessing the disk
again.  The second run is much faster, though.  So I suppose that
either 2GB of RAM are not sufficient to cache all the dirs or svn
writes some meta data even if nothing has to be updated.

Staszek's DSL connection is certainly not slower than mine, maybe even
a bit faster.  At least it seems that I need more time to connect to
the server.

Hans, I think that if we will use svn in the future, it's best if
Staszek could get a reasonably fast machine.  There are a few other
things to be considered: The .svn files in the ls-R databases might
slow down things as well and the Build script will benefit from a
faster machine too.  And what Staszek did in the past will justify
some support anyway.

As I said before, I can live with p4 as well.  I didn't use it before
but I installed a client already.  And I even can't tell now how much
I can contribute to TeXLive this year.  Don't care about me.  So if we
find a solution which makes Staszek happy, that would be a big step.

Though Staszek and Karl did most of the work, I think that some other
people contributed and it would be nice to get some feedback from
them.  Gerben mentioned the problem to create binaries on old
machines, which is a very important point.  It also affects Staszek
when he builds binaries using old versions of libc.

Would it be helpful to have two independent repositories, one for
system independend stuff (texmf-dist and texmf-doc) and one for system
dependent stuff (texmf and source)?  In a previous mail I mentioned a
workaround, but a workaround is not always a solution, at least not a
good one.

It seems that svn is significantly slower than p4 though many people
prefer svn.  It obviously requires more disk space.  It would be a
pity if we decide to use svn now and it turns out later that we cannot
have binaries for old systems because of hardware limitations.

We need more feedback from all the people involved in TeXLive
production somehow.  The question is: Can you live with svn or not.

I'm a bit concerned that a decision is made now and people run into
problems later.

Regards,
  Reinhard

For sure, TARPROG is not getting set.  The question is why not.  There
is a function find_tar, defined in utils.sh, called from the init()
function in common.sh, which should be doing it.

    I also find in the output that "TARPROG=tar" and "TAROPT=".

Apparently those assignments (which is what's in find_tar) are
ineffective.  Which is strange.

Can you please send me the *entire* output from

attach it, instead of just pasting it as regular text, since mailers

I want to first see what has been changed, and then the list of
affected files.  Currently, it's exactly the opposite.  For example,
the last change for the lm fonts presents 864 lines for affected
files, and then it shows `lm 1.00 update'...

I can definitetly. My hd is a old laptop and time svn status in the svn
root takes 9m20s. 

An important point for all with svn problems: You can call all svn
commands in an *arbitrary* subdirectory.

If you have only changed ..../texk/ then cd there and call svn commit
there. So only the part under this location is checked by svn.

Sorry for butting in out of nowehre in this oldish discussion: if
TeXlive is considering switching away from p4 to something else, I'd
like to suggest, among the alternatives to be taken into
consideration, mercurial (hg)
http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi

There is some info on how to transition from BitKeeper to Hg here
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/readmes/hg-cheatsheet.txt
Some of it might apply to p4 -> hg too.

I have never contributed to TeXlive and I probably never will.
Let's say I am just a lurker. But I am strongly in favour of svn.
I have checked out a working copy and I am happy to be able to
follow the ongoing developement of TeXlive. Something I never did
with p4. (Well, I tried it concerning pdftex some time ago.)

Well, this is just a very personal and highly emotional estimation.
But maybe it is not unimportant to you to know that there are
people out there observing your work who are very happy with
the svn repository.

This fits to my experiences with the subversion repositroy for the teTeX

Everybody can do something like this themself, since you don't have to
call 'svn status/update/commit/...' from the root of the tree. One can
do that from any subdirectory or give the directories to be checked/
updated/commited as additional arguments. That way svn won't scan the
whole tree.

i think that this would make a big difference indeed; in that case i can 
also imagine that each last svn branch is copied once per day in a clean 
tree (no .svn stuff) that then can be rsynced; i'm not sure ho wmany 
times a day staszek synchronizes his repository so maybe a fresh clean 
tree each day is enough;

(btw, laptop disks - as stazek uses- are slow anyway but i'm not sure if 
a desk top better, it may help to have a fast usb2 or firewire  disk 
and  some more mem);

well, we use svn here as well, and i have no speed problems (but that's

Last year I asked Karl how I can look into the p4 repository and he
pointed me to the rsync module.

For people who do not want to upload anything, rsync is by far the
best choice.  It's fast and reliable.  It still works with the current
svn repository.

You can try 

    rsync tug.org::tldevsrc <some target directory>

However, it makes sense to add "--exclude=Images" to prevent
downloading disk images and, what I've found out today,
"--cvs-exclude" prevents rsync from downloading all the .svn files and
directories.

Thanks for the feedback.

Regards,
   Reinhard

    svn writes some meta data even if nothing has to be updated.

svn status does not write anything.

I definitely agree that the first svn status (or update) takes longer
than subsequent ones, and the obvious reason would be disk caching.  I
don't know how to prove it.  Whatever.

Anyway, the general whole-repository update doesn't need to be done very
often.  Once or twice a day from cron should be enough.  It's doing
updates that I'm more concerned about.  40 minutes to update LM is a big
problem.

    The .svn files in the ls-R databases might
    slow down things as well 

They won't be there, of course.  I think I already checked in changes to
exclude them.

    It would be a pity if we decide to use svn now and it turns out
    later that we cannot have binaries for old systems because of
    hardware limitations.

I don't understand.  What does svn (or p4 or whatever) have to do with
what binaries can be supported?

That would cause far more problems than it would solve, in my opinion.
I also don't see why it would help Staszek's speed issue at all.

    (btw, laptop disks - as stazek uses- are slow anyway but i'm not sure if 
    a desk top better

I feel sure a desktop disk would be a lot faster than a laptop disk.
But also a new laptop disk would probably be a lot faster than his
current laptop disk, which we bought a couple years ago, as I recall.

Staszek, is there room in the machine for another disk if we bought one?
An external disk would also be possible, though less convenient for you,
I imagine.

As you could expect, I did it from texmf-dist/ level because we have

    As you could expect, I did it from texmf-dist/ level because we have
    doc, fonts, source and tex to update. 

One thing I've done is changed Seb's `place' script to construct the
list of changed directories, and only run svn commit in those
subdirectories, instead of from the top level of texmf-dist.
Doing that would probably have a bigger effect than anything else we've
discussed.

Perhaps we should focus more on making the scripts usable for the
updates you like to take care of, so you can take advantage of such
things and not have to do it by hand.

    Thought I didn't regenerate tpm file, sorry.

Don't worry/bother.  It gets autoupdated anyway, next time I regenerate
the tpm's.

Message-ID: <180F1C25-A37A-4DE4-A9B2-A9858D771075@sil.org>

I'm trying to understand how to refresh the texlive configure/make  
stuff, in order to be able to integrate support for building xetex.  
It looks as if I should run reautoconf.texk from the Build/source  
directory (rather than plain reautoconf, also found there). However,  
I get an error when it runs autoconf-2.59 in texk/dvipng:

>     Running autoconf-2.59 in `texk/dvipng'

>       If this token and others are legitimate, please use

>       See the Autoconf documentation.

and a subsequent attempt to ./Build the tree fails.

By removing dvipng from line 96 of reautoconf.texk, so that it runs  
autoconf-2.13 instead, the process completes with no error messages  
(only some warnings), and ./Build completes successfully.

So far, I've tried this on Ubuntu 5.10, SuSE 10, and Mac OS X 10.4.6,  
and in all cases this change seems necessary for reautoconf.texk to  
work successfully.

We are using svn+ssh at vntex.org.  ssh is the most convenient way to
access an svn repository especially if you have installed your private
key.  However, we had some problems with group permissions, i.e. some
files on the server had not been group writable after a commit.

Hmm, but this shouldn't happen. On alioth.debian.org there are around 50
projects with svn repos and they are cleanly separated (at least I hope
they are ;-)

So it is not a necessary problem.

Binaries for old environments/systems are compiled on old machines.
svn requires more disk space than p4, which is probably not always
available.

There is a paragraph about that in the svn-buildpackage HowTo
(http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/svn-buildpackage).

Not a problem.  You don't need svn to do a compile.  Just an rsync'd
tree is enough -- many of the binary sets we have now are
compiled by people who never touched p4.

Or (for those who aren't up to speed with rsync) there's "svn  
export", which will give a clean tree (or sub-tree -- whatever you  
ask for) without the .svn directories, though it may well not be as  
efficient as rsync.

Or you could consider enabling the option in ViewVC that can deliver  
a tarball of any requested directory. Either way people could easily  
get the sources needed for a compile.

Gerben said that he used p4 to create binaries on old machines.  I
suppose that he often has to change configure scripts and makefiles.
But only he can tell us whether rsync makes him happy.

    It looks as if I should run reautoconf.texk from the Build/source  

Yes, I believe that was an artifact of my removing the TeX/ directory
level.  reautoconf.texk should probably just replace reautoconf.

    By removing dvipng from line 96 of reautoconf.texk, so that it runs  
    autoconf-2.13 instead

I have some notes indicating that I had to do the same last year, and
never had time to figure out why.  AM_MAINTAINER_MODE is a standard part
of Automake and always has been; I didn't delve into what was really
happening that made it fail.  Maybe this year ...

Thanks for the hint.  I used the brute-force method in the past but
providing an svnserve wrapper seems to be better.  A more liberate
umask would be an option, too.

Well, we actually *had* this problem once, I think just after switching
from pkg-tetex- to debian-tex.  But it never occurred again, so it may
be a problem of bad initial setup.

I have often been asked "We need a new unix/linux system, which of
these can run TeX?", to which I could confidently reply: "teTeX can
easily be installed on any of the systems you are considering".  Your
contribution has been far greater than can reasonably be expected from
any one individual.  So while I feel a sense of loss in that teTeX may
fall into the care of less capabable hands, there is also a sense of
relief.

Whether or not there are more releases of teTeX, your work provides
the foundation for a significant fraction of active TeX installations,
including those used by many of the people who are actively working to
improve TeX.  It was an impressive effort and a significant
contribution to the scientific community, among others.  Recognition
and rewards often pass over people who just quietly get on with making
things better, but you can take enormous satisfaction from the fact
that your efforts not only will have lasting benefits for TeX users
around the world but also provide an example for others.

Actually, I'd prefer it if teTeX was succeeded by TeXlive in mind
share.  There is not much to be gained by maintaining separate full
distributions, and I'd guess that this is part of the motivation of
Thomas to not continue.

How and to what degree MikTeX's package system will have an influence
remains to be seen.  I certainly would want to see other TeX engines
on Windows gaining relevance.  Customers of mine use MikTeX
executables, and they just don't cut it, even after regenerating
formats.  Program abortions, random behavior (stuff like
\ifnum\lastnodetype<13 evaluating to true under certain circumstances
when \lastnotetype is 13, I am not kidding you), partly depending on
whether the files are DOS or Unix-ended...  And these problems are
reproducible (given identical input) on several computers and there is
basically no developer feedback.  I want to have executables with the
same quality as teTeX on all platforms, and it looks like TeXlive
would be the most feasible way for that.

well, fptex binaries are as good as the other web2c binaries 
(tetex/gwtex), and if there are discepancies, it's just a side effect of

This sort of problem is inevitable when you have multiple copies of a
script.  There are already scripts (e.g., texexec, but perhaps a poor
example since current texexec is a ruby script) that find the
progname.pl script using kpathsea and run perl on that, so the scripts
need only appear in the texmf tree.   I'm currently testing the
following:

#!/bin/sh
# use ruby and texmfstart.rb or perl
# to use: make symbolic links to the names of ConTeXt and tetex scripts

what=`echo $0 | sed 's at .*/@@'`

case $what in
texmfstart|texexec|pstopdf|textools|texutil)
  p=`kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts $what.rb`
  { test -n "$p" && test -f "$p"; } \
   || { echo "\`$what.rb' not found."; exit 1; }
  export RUBYLIB="${RUBYLIB:-${p%/*}}"
  exec ruby "$p" ${1+"$@"}
  ;;
*) # epstopdf, ...
  q=`kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts $what.pl`
  { test -n "$q" && test -f "$q"; } \
   || { echo "\`$what.pl' not found."; exit 1; }
  exec perl "$q" ${1+"$@"}
  ;;
esac

For win32 there are batch files and stub programs (irun) to perform a
similar function for perl scripts. I haven't investigated for ruby
scripts since Kakuto's w32tex "just works" so far.

Interesting.  "long ago" does not seem to imply the last MikTeX
release, though.  The code in question was something like

\ifnum\lastnodetype<13 \message{error with node type \the\lastnodetype}

Could you give some pointer or clue to the respective error report and
symptoms?  The problem is that I am using \lastnodetype quite a lot
and it would be quite helpful to me to know how I can avoid failure
with this bug short of sending the customer a dozen different versions
until one works with the current version of MikTeX.

No, I mean buggy behavior (like MikTeX aborting without error message)
that is triggered when line endings differ, while not being logically
connected with the line endings.  Stuff that makes one suspect
off-by-one errors in line ending treatment corrupting memory.  MikTeX
does get along with various line endings _mostly_ but sometimes there
are crashes that can be fixed by changing the line endings.

Problem is that customer will not be able to assemble his own
distribution, so a useful TeXlive out of the box with fp binaries
would be more or less what I'd need to break the MikTeX dependency...

Message-ID: <20060522083821.GA8728@dbs.uni-hannover.de>

Hi,

I am sorry to announce some bad news about teTeX: there won't be a next
release. To be more precise: there won't be a next release done by me.

In the past, preparing a release ment to spend all my spare time for
about 2-3 month on getting the release out (in addition to doing regular
updates on yources and the texmf tree). The time spend on it increased
with the size of the distribution.

My current development tree (just as it is today) is available from
  rsync://tug.org/tetexdevsrc/
so if anybody wants to pick it up, just do it.

Basically, teTeX consists of a source tree and a texmf tree with fonts,
macros, configuration, etc.

The source tree of teTeX-3.0 is included 100% in TeX Live
(http://www.tug.org/texlive/) which is released once per year. So,
there is no doubt for me that all the stuff that is now included in the
source tarball will be maintained actively. There are some parts which
have been originally written by me (scripts such as updmap, texconfig,
fmtutil) and I think that it won't be a problem for me to continue to
maintain these things (and submit updates into the TeX Live repository).

The texmf tree of teTeX is a monolitic distribution of individual CTAN
packages. I am unsure if someone else wants to maintain such a monolitic
monster package. I am sure that it would be much better to set up a
package based infrastructure, such as MikTeX's. This infrastructure was
recently ported to Linux, so using this might be a good start. Another
possible source of information about creating TeX packages is again TeX
Live. The work done there can be used to create debian packages in a
mostly automated way.

All the best,

Thomas

Subject: [tex-live] inclusion of libraries
Message-ID: <C0739481-8D9C-4E22-B8FE-F4E93C91E03C@sil.org>

A question regarding libraries and linkage preferences, as I'm  
working towards including XeTeX source in TeX Live:

xetex depends on several libraries that are not currently included in  
the TL source tree. Currently, it links statically with several ICU  
libraries and with SIL's TECkit, and dynamically with the system's  
installed versions of fontconfig, freetype, imagemagick, and zlib.

(For the ICU libraries, libicu*.a, xetex has a private version  
because it is using a slightly modified version of the ICU layout  
engine with some added features, so the question of using an  
installed copy does not arise. In the case of libTECkit, this is a  
small library that is unlikely to be widely installed, so it seems  
simplest to just use a private copy.)

TL practice seems to be to include source of all required libraries  
in texk/lib, and to link statically so as to produce self-contained  
binaries, though there are configure options such as --with-system- 
zlib, etc., to use installed libraries rather than TL private copies.

So for TL purposes, should I plan to include all these libraries in  
texk/lib, and default to building and using these versions unless -- 
with-system-.... is specified? Or is it acceptable to rely on  
installed copies of some or all of these, and leave it to packagers  
to ensure that the prerequisites are available, as part of the  
package management and installation function?

Guidance would be welcome.... thanks!

Jonathan

I am afraid that you're going to have to add the libraries to texk/lib,
if you want the thing to be as portable as the rest of the code.
I agree with your tacit view that this is getting silly, but
it undoubtedly current practice in TL.

Whether this is now
the moment to use native packaging systems to express
dependencies is a moot question. Sadly, TL seems to
be still run on systems where proper packaging is as yet
a rare art....

if i remember well it had to do with an unitialized variable resulting in a negative node number or so; it dates from before the token list (reg number >255) bugs (which was fixed)

i must admit that i don't document such bugs here and that i never used lastnodetype after that, if only because i don't want to depend on users updating the binaries (a two year delay -worse when sysadm's are not willing to update- is a reasonable assumption)

Please remind me, our goal here is to build xetex on every platform we
compile TL for (except, I guess, Windows)?

If so, then I agree with Sebastian, there's no real alternative to
putting them all into the source tree.  (freetype[2] and zlib are
already there, at least, though freetype may need updating ...)  Most of
the non-GNU/Linux builders (and most non-GNU/Linux users' systems) won't
have them (I believe).

BTW, what does fontconfig do?  Never heard of it.

It's a library for accessing the fonts installed on a system
(http://www.fontconfig.org/). At least on current GNU/Linux systems it
is used by many programs to find and access fonts. Actually, this
library is a quite interesting case for XeTeX, since it is, of course,
one of the important features of XeTeX to be able to access all fonts
installed on the system. I am not sure if this is possible if XeTeX (and
xdvipdfmx) is linked statically against it's own version, since this
version won't know where to look for system fonts. But I am also not
sure if one could go for dynamic linking here, since I am not sure how
stable the fontconfig library is. AFAIK TL uses dynamic libraries only
for libc and X11 libraries, and that causes already some problems.

Yes, that'd be the goal -- though I don't know what kinds of problems  
may lurk on some of the more "obscure" platforms! Eventually, I hope  
it'll be on Windows too, but that's not ready yet.

OK, I'll see if I can get my head around the necessary configuration  
stuff to build that way.

Where "installed" fonts, on a GNU/Linux system, typically running a  
Gnome or KDE environment, means "fonts known to fontconfig". While  
this is not the only mechanism applications use to handle fonts, it  
seems to be the de facto standard for most apps in an X-Windows-based  
graphical desktop environment.

Actually, I *think* this may be OK, as the library itself shouldn't  
contain that knowledge... it relies on an XML configuration file (/ 
etc/fonts/fonts.conf or something, and additional files and  
directories that it points to). So provided system integrators aren't  
making drastic changes such as moving the primary conf file, it  
should work; whether one uses the system's installed library or a  
statically-linked version, it'll still read and follow the same  
configuration.

On the other hand, if a user doesn't have a fontconfig library  
installed, then they're probably not running a "normal" X-based  
desktop system at all, and the whole idea of transparently accessing  
their library of "installed fonts", shared with all their GUI  
applications, becomes somewhat moot.

Does not sound like it.  I reported a bug once where at the start of a
TeX run, lastnodetype was set to 0 instead of -1.  However, in this
particular case, a test for \lastnodetype>13 evaluated to true, and an
immediately following error message expanded \the\lastnodetype to 13
(the latter being the correct value in the situation).  So the problem
was not that \lastnodetype had the wrong value, but that it behaved
like having several different values at once.

I am afraid that there are some alternatives where \lastnodetype can't
very well be avoided.  When deconstructing (and reassembling) a list
in \splitdiscards, for example.  \lastpenalty, \lastkern and \lastskip
can't reliably be used for detecting the presence of the respective
stuff on the list.

It may be also for interest to see how the program "Scribus" looks for

My understanding is that it uses fontconfig, though it also allows  
the user to specify additional locations.

<quote src="http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/ 
Installing_additional_fonts">
Scribus 1.3 still supports, and will continue to support, the ability  
to add extra font paths in the Scribus preferences. However, many  
people will want to install fonts for their entire system, not just  
Scribus.

An easy way to do this is with fontconfig. In most cases, just copy  
the fonts into a folder called .fonts in your home directory.  
If .fonts doesn't exist, create it. Once you've copied the fonts into  
the .fonts folder, just run fc-cache. You do not need to run it as root.

When you next launch Scribus, it should find the new fonts. Most  
other applications on an even remotely modern Linux desktop will also  
use fontconfig to find fonts, though some major apps still may not  
(especially vanilla, rather than distro-customised, builds)...
</quote>

(Note: on many current distros, even the step of running fc-cache is  
unnecessary.)

There is a question of resource management.  You have things working
with system libraries, while adding new libraries to the TL source tree
means more stuff for TL people to maintain, bugs in libraries coming back to
TL instead of to the appropriate package author, etc.

I'd suggest that TL continue to use static linking for "core"
components (mostly because
there are lots of systems out there with broken configurations, so it
is nice to think
that at least tex will run even if nothing else does), but that
dynamic linking is fine for newer, somewhat "experimental" components
that will only ever be installed on a fraction
of the systems where TL is used.  The sources are there, so anyone who
really needs
something different can build it themselves (or talk someone into
doing it for them).

I've started an rpm specific package repository, which is at http://www.tetexrpm.org/ for the noarch texmf stuff. Just recently, sourceforge approved the project for housing the rpm spec files there - project name is tetexrpm. I have not uploaded any files yet, but the point of using sourceforge is to make it easy for other people to contribute by adding/updating the spec files for the individual macro packages from CTAN.

If there is any interest whatsoever from people on this list helping out with that, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm certainly open to changing how things are done in tetexrpm if there is a need to do so.

perhaps the binary parts of tetex can be packaged in rpm from TeX Live, and the texmf as rpms from the CTAN .zip files. Something similar to tetex could then be achieved via yum/apt groups so that a groupinstall can pull in the necessary macro packages.

Thoughts comments?

    Where "installed" fonts, on a GNU/Linux system, typically running a

If it was only Linux, we might get away with linking fontconfig
dynamically.

And I see the Solaris systems I have access do have
/usr/lib/libfontconfig.so.  That's amazing.

But what about IRIX and AIX?  Vladimir?

I can confirm the problem with bibtex8 from TeXLive.

The entry is simply too long.  Since you use Big5 encoding, which
needs two bytes per character, and you have to use the small Perl
script posted earlier to the cjk list to replace problematic
characters with `\CJKchar{...}{...}', it is a good idea to recompile
bibtex8, setting the value of ENT_STR_SIZE (in bibtex.h) to a larger
value -- perhaps you can ask the MikTeX people for a new binary...

BTW, normal bibtex works just fine -- in TeXLive, the limit of
`ent_str_size' has already been increased to 250.


    Werner


PS: Karl, please increase ENT_STR_SIZE in TeXLive too!

Does this mean that a typical IRIX system (with whatever graphical  
interface and desktop manager is used there) uses a different way of  
managing/locating fonts? If so, the most appropriate thing to do is  
probably to create an alternative implementation of the XeTeXFontMgr  
module that is used to locate fonts on the host platform.

Or does it mean that the IRIX box in question was not configured as a  
desktop workstation with GUI software, OpenType and TrueType fonts,  
etc. but as some other kind of setup? It's perfectly possible to run  
a Linux box without fontconfig, too -- but XeTeX is probably less  
relevant on such setups, so maybe we should not try to target them  
for now.

(Please excuse my complete ignorance of IRIX!)

Hm, I fear this was a typical system.  We don't have sophisticated IRIX
admins who would tune it "down".  On the contrary, we only have the
machine because years ago, this was the only hardware providing hardware
stereo (for viewing macromolecular structures), or rather the hardware
of choice of the most commonly used software for doing that.  And the
currently responsible person wants to replace them by Linux boxes with
modern hardware stereo, I think they're already ordered.

I have no idea how fonts are handled; it might well be that IRIX doesn't
have any special support for font management; 6.5 has been released in
1998, and the maintainence releases since then seem to be mainly
bugfixes.

As Martin pointed out, fontconfig is available for IRIX in their
"freeware" package repository, so anybody who wants it can have it.  But
it's not installed by default, it seems.

    Does this mean that a typical IRIX system (with whatever graphical  
    interface and desktop manager is used there) uses a different way of  
    managing/locating fonts?

Olaf, do you know about this level of programming on IRIX?

I will ask another IRIX friend, but he's a sysadmin, not sure if he will
know.  His machine is also running IRIX 6.5, and he confirmed fontconfig
was not installed by default, but is available through freeware.sgi.com
(and he actually had installed it from there).  He also said he has an
a reasonable O2 machine which he'd be willing to donate to us if we want
it :).

For our present purposes, the question is whether we can dynamically
link with fontconfig or whether it should be in the source tree.  I'm
inclined to say, put it in the source tree and avoid the inevitable
version problems.

BTW, even without native fonts, aren't the Unicode extensions of XeTeX
plausibly useful?  E.g., with Latin Modern OpenType?  Just wondering ...

Thanks,
Karl

Yes, potentially so. Though right now, it won't use them unless  
fontconfig knows about them (so that the document can specify \font 
\x="Latin Modern Roman" or whatever); if you say \font\x=lmr10, it'll  
load the TFM file and handle it exactly like standard TeX, so you'll  
be dealing with a 256-character subset.

Additional ways to locate "uninstalled" fonts (those unknown to the  
GUI environment) are under consideration, however, as there are a  
variety of situations where this could be useful.

Particularly for TeX Live it would be useful if one could say something
like \font\x="lmroman10-regular.otf" and XeTeX would then use kpathsea
to search for the font by its file name. I don't know if the other
situations you are refering to could be catered for with this approach,
too.

Yes, this is one of the possible extensions, and easy to implement.

It may not be the best or only approach, though; for example, it  
doesn't provide a way to access entire families of fonts, only one  
specific face.

One handy feature of XeTeX is that it can choose the appropriate face  
from a family such as Brioso Pro based on the point size, so  \font 
\x="Brioso Pro" at 7pt  actually gives you Brioso Pro Caption, while   
\font\x="Brioso Pro" at 14pt  gives you Brioso Pro Subhead, etc. (by  
default, unless the user chooses to override optical sizing). But to  
do this, it needs knowledge of all the fonts in the family, not just  
the name of one file. It would be very nice if Latin Modern gained an  
OpenType 'opsz' feature some day, given that there are plenty of  
optical sizes already designed, and we'd want XeTeX to be able to  
make use of it.

The fontspec package (integration of LaTeX/NFSS with XeTeX) also  
relies on XeTeX's ability to find style variants (bold and italic) of  
a given face, so that  \setromanfont{Adobe Garamond Pro}  results in  
the proper styles for \itshape and \bfshape, for example. Again, this  
implies knowledge of the whole family, not just a single named font  
file.

Anyhow, all this is an area where there's still room for further  
development.... :)

I am not sure if support for some legacy font managing/locating system
is worth the effort.

The ability to use Unicode input without problems might be interesting
on such a machine, too. Of course, there is the problem how fonts are to
be found. Besides as additional interface to access fonts that you
mentioned in a later message, there might be an other/additional
possibility:

* XeTeX is statically linked against fontconfig which looks for
  /etc/fonts/fonts.conf. If this file does not exist, TeX Live installs
  the default version (which should not be changed anyway)

* directories below texmf-dist/fonts/{truetype,opentype} (and maybe
  type1, too) get fonts.cache-1 files so that fontconfig can use these
  fonts in principle

* a file '10-TeXLive' or some such is placed in /etc/fonts/conf.d which
  references these directories and is included form
  /etc/fonts/fonts.conf in the default configuration 

On systems that already use fontconfig, (some) fonts provided with TeX
Live would be integrated into the system and XeTeX can use them. On
systems without priour fontconfig, XeTeX could at least use TT/OT fonts
provided with TeX Live. But all that might be details for later ...

Subject: [tex-live] Strange license of ukhyphen
Message-ID: <20060525112345.GE9287@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all!

TeX live contains since long time the ukhyphen.tex. Unfortunately it has
quite strange license restrictions. Unlimited copying and redistribution
is permitted, but no modification whatsoever. I cite:

   Modifications may be made for private purposes [...]
   but if such modifications are re-distributed, the modified
   file must not be capable of being confused with the
   original.

Till now I would say this is not too strange, but here:

   In particular, this means the filename (the portion before the
   extension, if any) must not match any of :
%        UKHYPH                  UK-HYPH
%        UKHYPHEN                UK-HYPHEN
%        UKHYPHENS               UK-HYPHENS
%        UKHYPHENATION           UK-HYPHENATION
%        UKHYPHENISATION         UK-HYPHENISATION
%        UKHYPHENIZATION         UK-HYPHENIZATION
   regardless of case, and


   the file must contain conditions identical to these,
   except that the modifier/distributor may, if he or she
   wishes, augment the list of proscribed filenames.

This is definitely not DFSG free, and also not FSF free, so normally I
would expect that we cannot include it in TeX live.

Some time ago Frank K?ster wrote in an email to Debian bug #139900:

So if one of you have good contacts with the UKTUG heads I would suggest
discussing this topic again.

Subject: [tex-live] web2c changes to support xetex
Message-ID: <1793DF5C-DA20-49E5-B1D3-EAB90D1E5CE5@sil.org>

In order to support building xetex, in addition to the other tex/mf  
programs, a few minor changes in the web2c programs are needed.  
Specifically:

* convert
   needs "xetex" added to the list of supported programs, in two places

* splitup.c
   needs "xetex" added to the list of recognized output names

* coerce.h
   needs new #ifdef section to include <xetexdir/xetex.h>
   also needs a XeTeX-specific typedef for packedASCIIcode

The actual diffs (based on the current files in texlive/Build/source/ 
texk/web2c/web2c, rev. 1590) are attached. Unless there are any  
objections, I'd like to commit these changes to the texlive repository.

Please let me know of any concerns. Thanks.

Jonathan

Don't worry about it.  For TL purposes, those warnings are pretty
useless, since the binaries have to be moved by hand into the right
place anyway.

    /usr/include/sys/stdio.h:31: error: previous declaration of 'getline' was here
    ../../../../TeX/utils/t1utils/t1asm.c:284: error: conflicting types for 'getline'

Well, t1asm.c defines its own getline.  I don't think getline is a
standard function?  So I'm puzzled that it is being declared in stdio.h
by default in Cygwin.  It doesn't seem to be the case on any other
systems, since I don't recall this error being reported before.

Anyway, to work around it, I imagine you could either change stdio.h or
rename `getline' in t1asm.c, e.g., add
#define getline t1getline
to the top of the file.

BTW, if you succeed in producing good binaries for Cygwin, I'd
appreciate a link to a tarball so I could link to them from the TL web
pages.  Ok?


Eddie, maybe you could change the function name in a future release,
just to avoid this problem?

man getline gives here (Ubuntu Dapper to be) under examples:

EXAMPLES
	#define _GNU_SOURCE
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>

So it would appear to be in stdio.h on GNU/Linux...

I think it's a bug in Cygwin stdio.h, but since it's so easy to rename

    Please let me know of any concerns. Thanks.

The technical changes look fine/minimal/non-intrusive to me (Olaf, I'm
sure you'll say if you see any problems).

Administratively, I don't see a need to put the minimal comment into
splitup.c -- that's really just recording the original author.  Instead,
please write a ChangeLog entry and commit that along with the changes.
Ok?

Thanks Jonathan.

    So if one of you have good contacts with the UKTUG heads I would suggest
    discussing this topic again.

I spent a long time writing Phil Taylor, Dominik W., and Graham Toal
about this, and the current license is the result.  The previous license
forbade modifications at all, as I recall.  Phil will definitely not
accept any proposal to use a standard license, so writing him about that
would be a waste of time.

    This is definitely not DFSG free, and also not FSF free, so normally I
    would expect that we cannot include it in TeX live.

I'm not sure why you conclude it is not FSF free.  I think it is FSF
free (rms reluctantly accepted original latex with the "must rename"
clause).  I don't plan to remove it from TL.

I fail to see any significant difference between saying "you can't
redistribute a modified version under the name hyphen.tex", and "you
can't redistribute a modified version under the names hyphen.tex,
hyphenfoo.tex, and hyphenbar.tex".  Which would be analogous to what's
going on here.  Or is hyphen.tex (and plain.tex and ...) also not
DFSG-free?  Presumably you've already concluded they are ok, or Debian
would have removed TeX entirely.

If Phil was trying to lay claim to generic filenames, I would see that
as a serious problem, but he's not.

I am not FSF, but I guess that the restrictions on renaming together
with an arbitrary list will not be considered free (see below).

Ok?

This is a good question. Frank, did you bring this to debian-legal when
you removed ukhyphen from tetex? 

But Karl to be honest, this is the only file I have seen that has this
special renaming clause, ie specifying that renaming it differently is
not enough, several names are forbidden, too.

Let's put it to extremes: What if an author creates a file and lists in
the beginning all combinations of [a-z,0-9,....] (ok, they are a lot).
So this would effectively forbid the redistribution (let's say on msdos
systems with 8.3 filenames). 

To continue the above: How would the FSF describe what is considered
free in this case: 
"renaming is necessary" 			ok
"renaming plus a list of 10 other names"	maybe ok
"renaming plus a list of very similar names"	what is "very similar"
"renaming plus an arbitrary list of names"	hmm, I believe no

I agree that the obligation to rename is ok, but IMHO the additional
clause is strange.

> If Phil was trying to lay claim to generic filenames, I would see that

True, but the FSF and Debian have a similar problem: They have to define
what is "free" for them (although they do not agree completely). I am
not debian-legal, and I don't know what would be the answer, but as a
list of similar names cannot be defined, I assume *any* list of
additional names would be rejected, not only by debian-legal, but also
by the FSF.

For TeX live this is different. It could say we choose DFSG-free, or
FSF-free, or we create our TeX live-free. Everything is ok, but then the
LICENSE.TL text should be changed, where it states that TeX live
contains stuff that is DFSG and FSF free (plus the addition for FDL, but
lets forget this for now).

Sorry for this, ukhyphen has been stripped of tetex in Debian for quite
some time. Arguments for this see my other email.

I would like to have a nice settlement, too.... don't get me wrong.
But the list of similar file names looks a bit silly for me.

    But Karl to be honest, this is the only file I have seen that has this
    special renaming clause, ie specifying that renaming it differently is
    not enough, several names are forbidden, too.

Only one I've ever seen too.  I was very surprised when Phil put all
those names into his final version that he sent to me, but he was not
inclined to take them out.  So ...

    Let's put it to extremes:

Sure, the extreme case is nonfree.  But the case here isn't extreme.
And Phil isn't using ambiguous phrases like "very similar", he's
explicitly listing the "forbidden" names.  Who cares?  Honestly, I don't
feel that my freedom is being seriously impinged here.  I can take
ukhyphen.tex, I can modify it, I can redistribute my modified version.
That seems like the *fundamental* thing to me.  Not that I need to be
able to choose any name in the world that I want for my modified
version.

(Although I think licenses without naming restrictions are vastly
preferred.)

Based on rms' reasoning for the old latex license, I continue to believe
that the ukhyphen license would be ok for FSF.  And I don't want to
take up his time asking about it, either.

as far as phil is concerned, the licence is the same as the licence
for tex.  we _know_ that the licence for tex is odd; while phil taylor
doesn't have the monumental status that knuth has, i don't see why we
should accept tex and not ukhyphen, as karl remarks:

he does have that about him, but not in this instance.

What annoys me is that Phil Taylor has not much moral
right over this stuff anyway. The material came from Oxford
University Press back in the stone age, and Phil somehow
became its "owner" after Dominik lost interest. It was actually
outrageous of Phil to impose these utterly nonsenical
conditions

Yes, I'd agree with this statement.

On the other hand, it also looks a bit silly (to me) when  
distributions refuse to include the file because of this list, even  
though the peculiar license doesn't really interfere with using it in  
any reasonable way. I don't see that this benefits anyone.

When "free software guidelines" get in the way of sharing useful  
software, I wonder if "freedom" is being defined and interpreted too  
legalistically for our own good.

The freedoms as defined by FSF are not only the freedom of usage, but
also the freedom of modification and redistribution.

I agree that we are here in a very very very gray (or grey, what the
hack) borderline area. The renaming clause is generally accepted, but
the renaming clause with list of additional names I haven't seen to be
discussed before.

Easy to say for one single file, but if you want to manage and big
distribution, let it be TeX live or Debian or whatever, than it comes to
a bit more difficult situation. One would like to have the possibility
to say "take this distribution and do whatever you want, everything
therein is free, not only for your consumption, but also for your
perusal".

I don't know how we will continue. TeX live will for sure keep it, and
this is ok with me. But I have to oblige to the Debian rules if I want
to put packages into Debian. And then it depends on ftp-masters whether
packages pass.

But generally in the TeX world we have a bit of a problem, and we just
opened this "Pandora's box" as the pressure from the Debian side was
increasing on the teTeX maintainers. TeX (as a whole) is full of files
which are 10 years old, from a time when nobody cared for license
statements, full with PD licenses which isn't necessarily legally valid,
full of exotic instances (ukhyphen not being the only instance), ...

I hope that this box will not kill the efforts we are doing for Debian!

You already have to drop the Texinfo manual and (I expect) a number of

No it is not *clear* to me. I said that I suspect that it is not
consistent with FSF nor DFSG. The reason is the following: How would one
give a general description of what is to be considered free:
* rename clause 			ok
* rename clause with list of 10 additional names	maybe???
* rename clause with "similar names"		what means similar?
* rename clause with arbitrary additional names		probably not

THis is MY WILD GUESS! I am *not* debian-legal, and much less FSF-legal,
nor are you ;-)

As far as I understood from Karls answer 
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2006-May/010233.html
the option of relicensing is not present.

True.

But it is the *ONLY* instance that adds a list of additional names:

Let's put it simple and clear:

If this would be the standard, we wouldn't have:
	etex
	pdfetex
	NOT EVEN latex
as all of them have tex as a part of it!!!

See above, the ukhyphen states that the file name *must not* match eg
ukhyph. Matching is not defined, so it could be interpreted as "being a
part of". With this interpretation and a similar addionion by DEK we
wouldn't have etex, nor latex.

Do we want this? Is this the intention?

And the other question: What should be prevented by this additonal name:
All TeX distribution include in their language.dat file ukhyphen.tex, so
a renaming to ukhyph.tex will not include it into a format. So the fear
for problematic format incompatibilities is not valid.

And I don't see any other reason.

Last but not least I have to agree with Sebastian Rathz 
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2006-May/010238.html
that the source of these files are originale OUP, as also stated in
the file, so applying a license from the UK-TUG seems to be a strong move.

Till now texinfo manual from the texinfo packages. Yes, but there is

ukhyphen was in tetex 2 but not in tetex 3; i don't know if debian
excluded it for longer than just tetex 3, but they would have been
justified in so doing -- there was *no* licence statement prior to
that which karl wrung out of phil taylor.  (i had tried previously and
got nowhere.)

i agree with karl, though: there seems little likelihood that we can

actually i had dominik's agreement to applying lppl to the file, but
he then went and asked phil.  when dominik told me what he had done, i
knew we were in for the long haul ... and ultimately i failed -- only
karl's superior supplies of energy (and authority, i suppose) wrung

Well, I'm not sure if Phil is on that mailing-list, but as I know Phil,
I'd dare to say it would be enough to say him some arguments
to solve once and forever that subject. Should I do that?

Target Platform: Cygwin 5.19

Karl, thanks for the work around, (#define getline t1getline).

After doing that I ran ./Build again, got further along, and ran into, basically the same problem.

----

# (2) Inserted the following at line #2173 of tangleboot.c
#    #define getline tb_getline
----

Then re-ran ./Build.  Same problem... ummm.  Looked at the tangleboot.{c|h} and both where back to their unedited state???  

So these must be automatically generated files.....

Any ideas about problem can be broached?

This was not a Debian-specific step; ukhyphen has been excluded from
teTeX.  I guess this was before the new license that is now on CTAN.

I don't know what Debian people did about that, this predates my
involvent.  All I did was tag the bug "fixed upstream" when I noticed
that the file was missing in the teTeX 3.0 betas, and remove it from
teTeX 2.0.2's tarball when we had to repackage it, anyway.  It is now
again in Thomas' tetexdevsrc repository.

There is a related issue which has been brought up quite frequently on
debian-legal, there might be more instances, but for sure it's happened
with PHP: the license forbid to give any derived product a name that
"contains the letters php, in that order".  It was argued that such a
requirement was overly broad and inacceptable, since it also forbids to
use PHP code in an otherwise unrelated project called "graphplot" (or
similar).

I was never involved in these threads, and didn't read them carefully.
But to me it seems as if, by this reasoning, it is *not* overly broad to
"forbid" ukhyphenization, uk-hyphenization and abbreviations thereof.
The only thing I'm unsure about:  Does the word "match" in the license
mean that the strings are equal, or is it meant in the sense of a grep
match?  I'm unsure about the common english usage here;  I would read
the license as "ukhyphen1.tex or ukhyphnw.tex are okay".

Yes, anything within the Work sub-tree is generated during the build.

> Any ideas about problem can be broached?

I don't have a Cygwin system to try this, but it might work to edit  
texk/web2c/cpascal.h. Right after the line

   #include "config.h"

try adding a #define to rename any getline() function that  
subsequently gets declared/used:

   #include "config.h"

   #if defined(CYGWIN) || defined(__CYGWIN__) || defined(CYGWIN32) ||  
defined(__CYGWIN32__)
   #define getline pascal_getline /* avoid clash with getline()  
declared in stdio.h */
   #endif

I think this will work, because config.h (indirectly) includes  
<stdio.h>, and so that's when the unwanted declaration gets into the  
source.

You'd probably run into the same issue with tangle, otangle, weave  
and mft, as all of these programs have a getline procedure defined in  
their Web source; but a patch in cpascal.h should solve all of them  
at once (if it works as I intend).

Actually, the #if / #endif bracketing is probably unnecessary, as the  
#define should be harmless on other platforms. The one risk is that  
this could interfere with some other piece of code that actually  
wants to get to the version of getline in glibc, but I don't think  
this actually arises. The only code likely to do this would be  
separately-written C code that doesn't #include "cpascal.h".

Thomas Esser had five possibilities how to react to the reported licence
problem.

1. do nothing: that would mean that the licence violation would not be
corrected.

2. to remove the whole tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz from CTAN: that would mean
that the license violation would be corrected but teTeX 3.0 would not be
usable never more.

3. to remove the relevant files (csplain.ini etc.) from the
tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz archive: that would mean that the license violation
would be corrected but csplain/cslatex stuff would no longer be usable in
teTeX 3.0.

4. to replace the relevant files by old version (Feb. 2000): that would
mean that the license violation would be corrected but
pdfcsplain/pdfcslatex would not work properly.

5. to replace relevant files by newer version (Feb 2005): that would mean
that the license violation would be corrected and all cstex stuff would
work properly in teTeX 3.0 environment.

We have had to send five emails to Thomas until he decided to do
something else than 1. He decided on 4. Of course, we would be more
happy if he decided to do 5 (it would be no extra work for him!), but
given our current relationship, that would be too much to expect.

This "dead teTeX" lives happily in many Linux distributions as the current
and latest TeX software. Unfortunately, throught this "dead teTeX", a
patch that violates csplain author's copyright got into hundreds of Linux
(and other Unix) distributions. This was the main reason why I asked for
the problem to be corrected.

This is not _my bug_ in teTeX, this bug is a consequence of our bad
communication (i.e. communnication between T.E. and P.O.). I will try to
show here what I mean by a better communication:

* T.E. (March 2004): Petr, we plan to use only one TeX engine (pdfetex)
  for all formats. What should we do in CSTeX?
* P.O. (March 2004): discussion about the best macrocode to fix this on
  cstex@ list.
* P.O. (April 2004): Thomas, I am sending you a new version of CSTeX files
  which solves the problem of shared TeX engine for different formats.

Of course, the main teTeX developer is not obliged to inform his
co-workers about his plans. Here is what really happened:

* Bug report from a user to P.O. (Feb. 2005): pdfcsplain does not work
  in new teTeX distribution.
* P.O. (Feb. 2005): Oh my, there is shared TeX engine (pdfetex) for
  different formats. I didn't know about it. Discussion about the
  best macrocode to fix this on cstex@ list.
* P.O. to T.E.: (March 3 2005): Thomas, I am sending a new version of
  CSTeX files which solves the problem of shared TeX engine for different
  formats.

What went on at this point? I believe that the ideal communication betwen
co-workers would follow like this:

* T.E. to P.O. (Mar. 2005): thanks for new wersion, but I released
  teTeX tree tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz one month ago. There is old
  version of CSTeX here. I don't plan to do any changes in file
  tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz and this file will be for many months the
  official source of TeX software for hudreds of Linux distributions.
* P.O. to T.E. (Mar. 2005): please, upgrade CSTeX files not only in the
  development tree but also in tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz. The old version
  of CSTeX does not work in the environment with shared TeX engine
  (problems with pdfcsplain/pdfcslatex).
* T.E. to P.O. (Mar. 2005): done, tetex-texmf-3.0a.tar.gz is released.
* P.O. to T.E. (Mar. 2005): Thank you.

Unfortunately, this communication has never happened. What happened was
this: P.O. was never informed that the source for Linux distributions was
not upgraded with CSTeX files from March 3 2005. The end users of CSTeX
from Linux distributions are out of luck, because due to communication
problems between P.O. and T.E. the software they need does not work.

This is a key point.  It is a act of life that software must be
examined not only for correct functionality, but for conformance with
licenses.  Just as we can't be sure there are no bugs left, we can
never be sure every license was handled properly.

T.E. has to deal with licenses for all the files included in teTeX.
Under (standard) GPL modification is allowed and for such small
changes failure to send them to the author very understandable.  T.E.
made a simple mistake, and one that any of us could have made.  The
real failure is that the mistake wasn't recognized when tetex-3.0 was
being tested.

In the real world communications between well-intentioned parties are
never perfect.  A license such as yours has advantages (preventing a
morass of slightly different versions with conflicting filenames so
user don't know which is which) but imposes a burden on packagers and
authors.

Authors can't monitor the actions of every packager.  In the case of a
widely used package such as teTeX, however, it makes sense that
authors as well as users be involved in testing to find and correct
mistakes.  Maybe it is a tribute to the high quality of teTeX that we
have all have been lax in pre-release scrutiny.

i just updated the catalogue to change the licence for cstex (there
are others still to do).  i last updated the catalogue a few months
ago, and missed the significance of

   license: GPL with appendix

as applied to csplain in license.eng.

i feel that that description is deeply confusing.  the licence is
*not* gpl, it's something based on gpl -- but very seriously different
from gpl.  apparently i got it right when i catalogued csplain.

i have changed the licence entry in the catalogue to say "other"
rather than gpl.  this reflects the fact that we have no licence
categories for randomly-hacked versions of standard licences.

are there any others of your many contributions on ctan that i've
mis-catalogued -- for example, enctex?  it's obviously very important.

i've got

  +++ licences for olsak's stuff: a2ac code128 csfonts cspsfonts ean ofs
      (cstex, csplain, enctex already checked)

in my todo file just now.  have i missed something on enctex?

For one thing, it is GPL-incompatible.  Software under this license
can't be distributed as one compound of something containing GPLed
software.

OK, I accept that using the letters GPL in my copyright notice is
confusing.

May be, we can more closely compare csplain license to
license of plain.tex file.

If plain.tex file can't be distributed as one compound of something
containing GPLed software then csplain can't be distributed too.

It also has more disadvantages.  Thinking it over, I can't figure out
under which license I may and/or must distribute a derivative work which
I created and renamed.  If csplain were under GPL, it's clear:  It must
be GPL.  But it isn't under the GPL, and the license it is under doesn't
state clearly which license derivatives are supposed to use.  

I obviously can't use the same license text (because "same name
'csplain'" would be self-contradictory).  Am I obligded to replace
'csplain" by my new name?  Or am I allowed to drop it?

    ifdef __USE_GNU:

Ok, so the question is why and how is __USE_GNU being defined.
It's not explicitly in the TeX sources anywhere.

djh, if you could add -dD to the gcc line for one of the files, you will
get output which is the results of preprocessing with all the
#define's intermixed, and can look for __USE_GNU there.  Also, it would
probably be worth running
  gcc -E -dM - </dev/null
and see if it is predefined.  (If so, I think -U__USE_GNU would solve
the problem.)

Apparently __USE_GNU does not get defined on (GNU:)/Linux, because this
error isn't reported there.  (And I see the declaration in
/usr/include/stdio.h, likewise #ifdef'd.)

Thanks,
Karl

The gnu-cpp docs hint at using __GNUC__ instead.

    The gnu-cpp docs hint at using __GNUC__ instead.

__GNUC__ has a different purpose (saying what compiler is in use).

Linux stdio.h explicitly does an #ifdef on __USE_GNU for declaring
getline.  Therefore that specific symbol has to be getting defined
somewhere on Cygwin, and the commands I sent should say where ...

Message-ID: <200605262315.k4QNF4c29764@f7.net>

    This was not a Debian-specific step; ukhyphen has been excluded from
    teTeX.  I guess this was before the new license that is now on CTAN.

Right.

    But to me it seems as if, by this reasoning, it is *not* overly broad to
    "forbid" ukhyphenization, uk-hyphenization and abbreviations thereof.

To me too.

    The only thing I'm unsure about: Does the word "match" in the
    license mean that the strings are equal, or is it meant in the sense
    of a grep match?

I presume it is equal.  Otherwise, I think it would be unnecessary to
separately include both (for example) ukhyph and ukhyphen.  Indeed,
ukhyph and uk-hyph would be the only non-redundant entries.

All guesses aside, we could ask Phil his intent.  But I'd rather not.

    I would read the license as "ukhyphen1.tex or ukhyphnw.tex are
    okay".

Me too.

Best,
Karl

LaTeX contains a file ".tex".  It may not be relevant, coming from a
different source, but "abbreviations thereof" is awfully fuzzy.

Hi Staszek,

    Well, I'm not sure if Phil is on that mailing-list, but as I know Phil,

He isn't (that I can see), although of course he may be checking the
archives or whatever.

    I'd dare to say it would be enough to say him some arguments
    to solve once and forever that subject. Should I do that? 

Sure, if you think you have a shot at convincing Phil to drop the
"filename must not match any of" clause, please go for it.

FYI, he only agreed to change his license after I pointed out to him
that Knuth had revised the "license" on hyphen.tex et al.  So he knows
that Knuth said only "hyphen.tex", and the list of additional names was
entirely his own idea ...

Thanks,
Karl

The #define one is supposed to use to get stuff that depends on
__USE_GNU is _GNU_SOURCE.

So the question is ?What is #defining _GNU_SOURCE??

FWIW, I had some email exchanges with Phil Taylor yesterday,
and he is not interested in any change to that licence.

I suggest that the only proper way forward is for someone
to contact OUP afresh, get the list of hyphenated words, build the
hyphenation patterns again, and licence them under an
acceptable regime.

in essence, that's what the catalogue now says: "other" => nonfree
(unless you have other information, and i don't believe we have in
this case).

[note that we're no longer maintaining the ctan nonfree tree -- it's
just too much hassle (not least because of hassle from the people who
don't believe in the concept of free/nonfree).  things like
ghostscript, and like cstex would be, part free and part nonfree, are
also a problem.]

perhaps csplain should just be dropped from texlive ... like ukhyphen
was.  (i was cross about that, but i understood the reasoning.)

(all those tetex lists snipped, since it's no longer a tetex question;
texlive kept in because texlive is still an active distribution.)

An author can put any nonsense they want into a license -- it is up to
the "users" to decide whether they can live with the license.  In
practice, most will rely on compilations (teTeX, TeX Live, linux
distros) to make such decisions.  At the risk of repeating myself,
there is a duty on the part of packagers and testers to check for
license problems before making a "release".  It is unfortunate that
license issues take time away from more productive pursuits.

More like "non-sense", and in fact more in the category of inviting
misinterpretation by
referring to GPL which, as you note, forbids additional restrictions.

I assume the intent of restricting the use of certain names is
intended to reduce "forking", which does make life harder for package
maintainers who get bug reports against 3rd party "enhancements".  A
rule that said "no program of macro  can be invoked under the name
'epsf' or 'ps2pdf'." so we would have 'dvips-epsf.tex' and
'dvipsone-epsf.tex', 'gs-ps2pdf'[.bat], 'WinEDT-ps2pdf'[.bat] etc.
would significantly reduce the traffic in c.t.tex and c.t.pdf.  In
practice, licenses are very blunt tools and just as likely to injure
the tool's user as to perform the task at hand.

This is what we are doing, but considering the number of files in TeX
live I would say we either have a release with a certain unsecurity, or
we have no release at all. Never...

indeed the author can.  however, if he submits it to ctan, he's likely
to be encouraged to do something more sensible.  we try to get the
licence categorisation in the catalogue right ... but as people will
have seen from this thread, i had the licence of cstex wrong (since
cstex contains the curiously-licenced csplain).

the fact is that, with sufficiently capricious authors, and fallible
categorisers and packagers, there will always be licence problems.

it may not be sensible, but it caught both thomas and me, which was

actually gpl.

the problem is that users quite regularly mistype package names when
reporting problems.

licences _are_ blunt tools, but they're the only tools we have against
the above problem, and against the problem of protecting distributors
against litigious package authors.

sigh.

Ctan/tetex are the places where most people will get packages like
cstex.   Package authors really should check both places early and
often ensure the files are intact and assigned to appropriate
categories (and especially if they don't use a standard license).
Package users should speak up when something seems to be
mis-categorized.

i doubt it -- i would assume most people get packages via miktex or
one of its derivatives.  pretty much all comes from ctan in the first
place, but miktex packaging is another place where mistakes could be
made.

well, that's what's now happened.  but in general, it's not easy: with
a copy of ctan (a mere 8gbytes or so), you can read pretty much all
packages that go to make up tetex, but you can't read any of the
distribution stuff without unpacking things.  so, to do the check
properly, you've got to unpack things in zip, tar-gz, cab, dmg and
various other macintosh formats: this is a bore of the most extreme
kind.

repeated checking is practical, but i would claim it's only just
practical.

imo, the only sensible way forward is not to create stupid licences
which introduce the potential for confusion -- because if you create a
stupid licence, you will either prevent your package being taken up at
all, or (as we've seen in this instance) sooner or later you'll create
confusion of one sort or another.

Dear Petr,

first, let me explain a little more about my "license violation". Not
everyone here knows the background. You license is somewhat which can
be summarized as "GPL with an appendix". The appendix in itself imposes
severe restriction on the rights given by the GPL.

Richard Stallman has told me that your license is self contradicting
and that using the GPL in such a way is not valid. I think that he will
contact you directly to resolve this with you.

You blame me for bad communication. Good, let me explain my point of view:

15 months after I made that teTeX-3.0 release, Zdenek Wagner has contacted
me with

    we got complains that csplain does not work in teTeX. After
    examination the CSTeX maintainer, Petr Olsak, found that csplain.ini
    was modified. It is not only violation of copyright, because it
    is not alowed to distribute modified files with unchanged names,
    but it moreover causes that csplain does not work correctly

I have replied that I am no longer maintaining teTeX and Zdenek Wagner
replied that

    I think that it is important to have correct version of csplain.ini
    in your last development tree so that if someone decides to continue
    your work, gets the correct file.

And I have replied that this has happened over a year ago (the day that
you had send an update to me; this was after the teTeX-3.0 release).

Then, you, Petr have send mails, which I consider very impolite:
  - you blame me for ignoring your mail from mar 2005 (in fact, I had
    updated my tree the same day)
  - you claim to focus on the license violation. After I fixed just this
    (and not the bug which is independed of the license violation),
    you blame me for all kind of "bad communication". To remember,
    this is what you have said:

      It is irrelevant what cause the trouble. There is only one important
      object: the archive tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz includes the violation
      of copyright of csplain and this archive is still distributed and
      it is a source of TeX software for hundreds Linux distributions
      (for example).
      ...
      Please, tell me, who is responsible for distribution of the archive
      tetex-texmf-3.0.tar.gz in Internet now? I'll ask him to correct
      the copyright violation problem in this file.

You did not even accept my excuse about the copyright violation at all,
even though it had happened accidently and without any bad intent:

      To say: "I am sorry about it" is not full sufficient. It would be
      more ideal to solve the problem.

Given all this, I still feel that my reaction was adequate. Now, live
with the fact that the bug remains in the last version of teTeX. Maybe,
I would habe done something else if you had asked in a more polite way.

After all, it is free software. You, or anybody else, might pick it up
and publish a new release.  I don't even impose restrictions on the name
"teTeX".

All the best,

Thomas

    perhaps csplain should just be dropped from texlive ... 

At present, I see no overriding reason why cstex can't be included in
tl.  Fundamentally, I don't think Petr's name restriction makes cstex
nonfree any more than Knuth's name restriction makes hyphen.tex nonfree.

Petr, I do think it would be good for you to clarify the intended
status/license of derived versions, since of course that is a
fundamental point of free software.

(I wish neither name restriction existed; I don't think they fulfill the
intended purpose.  But that's just me.)

I will try to work with Petr and crew to make sure that TL includes a
cstex that is (a) compliant and (b) usable.  I feel sure that (a) and
(b) can be satisfied simultaneously, if we remain of stout heart and
good cheer :).

No. I thought (and I am already sorry to have kicked of this discussion)
that it was removed from tetex because of the current license and not
the old one. 

So for now I leave it in, also in the Debian packages. We brought it to
debian-legal, without response till now. If there is a change, you will
hear from me.

Best wishes

    The #define one is supposed to use to get stuff that depends on
    __USE_GNU is _GNU_SOURCE.

Sure.  But you reported that Cygwin stdio.h (and GNU/Linux stdio.h too,
at least on my red hat systems) is protected by __USE_GNU.  Therefore
__USE_GNU, specifically, must be getting defined somewhere -- apparently
in the Cygwin include files, and under different conditions than in the
Linux include files.

As I wrote before, adding -dD to the compilation line of one of the
failing files and inspecting the output should answer this question once
and for all without further remote guessing.

Also, gcc -E -dM - </dev/null will show the list of predefined symbols.
Perhaps Cygwin defines _GNU_SOURCE or __USE_GNU that way, although it
would be quite strange.

    So the question is ????What is #defining _GNU_SOURCE?????

Nothing in the TeX sources.  Therein lies the whole problem and the
reason it seems to me to be a bug in Cygwin.

    Martin> "__USE_GNU *never* must be defined by the user."

Right, and, it isn't.

    Is this this cygwin bug?
    http://ftp.tug.org/mail/archives/pdftex/2006-February/006370.html

Yes, but that message implies that the Cygwin stdio.h does not protect
getline.  It does, according to what James reported.  Therefore the bug
is not that the declaration is present, but that __USE_GNU is being
incorrectly defined in the system include files (as far as I can tell).

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] Installation on Solaris 8
Message-ID: <200605281349.k4SDnb609486@tug.org>

Hi Don,

About the "xf" problem.  Thanks for sending me the log.  Now I see what
is happening.  I think there are several ways to deal with it.

1) install GNU tar and put it first in your path.

2) install from the `inst' TL image, instead of the live image.

3) In your install-tl.sh (aka install-live.sh), there are these two lines
   around line 300:
     (cd $CDDIR; $XARGS sh -c 'tar cf - $* \
        | (cd '"$TEXDIR"'; umask 0; $TARPROG x${tarverbose}f -)' sh < $f.uniq )
   Try changing them to:
     (cd $CDDIR && $XARGS sh -c 'tar cf - $* \
        | (cd '"$TEXDIR; umask 0; $TARPROG x${tarverbose}f -)" sh < $f.uniq )

I haven't tested this ...


Explanation:

1) the TL install wants to use a "list of files" feature in tar.  This
   is the -T option in GNU tar and the -I option in Sun tar.
   Unfortunately it does not work as needed in Sun tar.  (See test below.)

2) therefore, it falls back on using xargs.  Part of using
   xargs is to invoke a subshell.  The invocation put most of the
   command in single quotes:
   '... $TARPROG ...'
   therefore $TARPROG was being expanded by the subshell, not the main
   shell.  And TARPROG was not exported, therefore not set in the
   subshell.  Q.E.D.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. For the record, the test of a sufficient tar in utils.sh is this:
    mkdir a b
    tar cf test.tar a b
    rmdir a b
    echo a > list
    /path/to/tar -x -f test.tar -I list >/dev/null 2>&1
    if test -d a && test ! -d b; then
      echo ok...
    else
      echo bad...
    fi

When I tried running this on a Solaris 5.8 machine, it did not extract
a.  Actually, on the first machine I tried, it hung with no output.
Very weird.

Again, appologies for confusing the issue.  I had presumed that cygwin
would have used glibc, but I see from their cvs that they in fact use
newlib.

They added getdelim(3) getline(3) to stdio.h in:

http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/newlib/libc/include/stdio.h.diff?r1=1.12&r2=1.13&cvsroot=src&f=h

and as you can see from that diff w/o protecting them in an #ifdef.

The full annodation of their stdio.h in:

http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/newlib/libc/include/stdio.h?annotate=1.35&cvsroot=src

shows that they remain unprotected.

So, even though glibc protects the declaration unless the proper
#define is used, other libcs may not.  And cygwin?s version of
newlib is one such example.

(I hope this proves more useful than my first reply....)

Ah, now it is all clear.  Thanks.

Are you or anyone here in a position to report this bug to cygwin?  TeX
has been using getline for 20+ years, it's rather annoying to have a
name clash now.

They may not be excited about changing it, though, since I see the
change was made in 2002.  I guess no one has tried to compile TeX
between then and now, or didn't bother to report the problem if they
did.  Sigh.

The current license is inconsistent, so "nonfree" in the sense that it
is not unambiguously free.

It may be better to use an existing license with a track record while
also clearly stating an intention to actively maintain cstex and
asking as a matter of courtesy, rather than a license condition, that
significant changes to your files not be widely distributed without
consultation The problem with such a clause is that people will differ
of what constitutes a significant change.  Changes to storage forms
(line terminators or other text format) by some installer may not be
considered a change at all by a packager.   Actively maintaining a
package means monitoring the distribution chain to ensure that the
package works as intended for end users and is correctly described and
categorized in the distribution system.

We can't be sure of the intended purpose until the author tells us.

A little good will on both sides should accomplish not only (a) and
(b), but (c)larity in the license, and (d)iminished chances for
problems with other packages where authors may be considering ad-hoc
licenses.

TeTeX has (probably too) many opportunities to give users different
runtime versions of files from a "reference" archive (load
configuration files or patches at runtime, patch at install time, put
the updated version in a directory that occurs earlier in the search
path, aliases arranged so "new-file.tex" is used when the user
requests "file.tex").   This gives an intermediate ground between the
desire of authors that all users of <package> get the same files and
the desire of packagers to for flexibility while making it easier for
all concerned to see exactly which changes have been make by the
packager.

So it is.

However, there might be a trivial workaround (for all the WEB  
programs that define a getline procedure): amid the other  
investigations, did anyone using Cygwin try my suggestion from a  
couple days ago of adding a #define to texk/web2c/cpascal.h? Seems  
like that should fix it.

It looks from their web site that they want bug reports about newlib
to be sent to redhat?s newlib list <newlib at sources.redhat.com>.  (Or
perhaps that should read <newlib at sourceware.org>.  At any rate, they
have links at http://sourceware.org/newlib/mailing.html to subscribe
and to the archives.)

Hmm.  Looking at their current version of stdio.h (w/o the annotation)
I don?t see getline(), but just __getline():

,----(http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/newlib/libc/include/stdio.h?rev=1.35&content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=src)
| ssize_t _EXFUN(__getdelim, (char **, size_t *, int, FILE *));
| ssize_t _EXFUN(__getline, (char **, size_t *, FILE *));
`----

So, I just grabbed :pserver:anoncvs at cygwin.com:/cvs/src/newlib and
in their grep(1) tells me that newlib/libc/sys/linux/sys/stdio.h has:

,----(:pserver:anoncvs at cygwin.com:/cvs/src/newlib/libc/sys/linux/sys/stdio.h)
| #define getline __getline
`----

and that must be the source of the problem.

But why does cygwin use include/sys/linux/sys/stdio.h?

I?m going to take a break now and see whether Danica manages to
make some Indy History.  I?ll grep(1) through some more later....

Yes, I mean that if csplain is marked as "nonfree" then plain.tex is
"nonfree" too (independently, what "nonfree" means). If somebody want to
make *TeX package without "nonfree" parts, then he have to remove TeX
itself (it was done for example in teTeX+TL) and plain.tex, hyphen.tex
and CM fonts. In such case he have to remove csplain too, because csplain
depends on plain.tex, hyphen.tex and CM fonts. Another question is why
such package is named "*TeX package".

On the other hand, if somebody remove csplain but does not remove
plain.tex then I'll ask: why? Where is difference between plain.tex
and csplain license?

> Petr, I do think it would be good for you to clarify the intended

First, I agree with other discussants that my copyright notice in
csplain.tex is confusing because I (sadly) used the pointer to GPL.
I was more inspired by Knuth's license than GPL. It means I feel my
own responsibility to users and I want to have hight control over
functionality of software with the same name as my original software
in my computer.

This responsibility is realised in practice: if csplain does not work
(for example) in some Debian version of Linux distribution then user
does not report the problem to Debian packagers nor teTeX packagers
but to me. I have written many documentation/books about csplain (for
example). Packagers usually do not know all this documentation and
there is a risk that if they do a little change then
documentation is not compatible with such changed software.

Status/license of derived software: you can rename my project name
and you can do with this result anything. You can use arbitrary
license for this derived software and you can totally forget about
author of original. I don't feel any responsibility for
such derived software. I need to be sure that users can recognize
derived software from my original simply by _name_.

At (b): I hope that cstex is usable in TL now and (unlike teTeX) it
is functional in TL. I did not understand exactly what do you mean at (a).

Your license has more terms, and contradictory terms, to boot
(according to the initial assessment of the main author of the
license).  That means that modification, and possibly no distribution
are allowed.

To be brutally honest: csplain is not important enough to most users
to make compromises for a patched-together license which likely does
not allow modification at all without violating some license term.

The pseudo-GPL hickhack in it.

Reality check: people wanting to maintain a Czech TeX variant are not
exactly battering down the doors.  As long as you keep actively
maintaining it, no hostile takeover is to be expected.

Most certainly the pseudo-GPL would not allow anything like that.  The
GPL is _designed_ to prohibit derivations under different licenses.

Anyway, if one could "totally forget about author of original", one
could also rename fudgesquareplain.tex to csplain.tex (because one
might find the name more suitable)...

See the problem?

the difference is that csplain's licence is written in a deliberately
obfuscating way: it says it's "gpl" (a licence whose specification
says that it may not be used amended) "with annex" (i.e., an amendment
to gpl).

this is such an outrageous thing to do that it's caught out two
experienced texies (thomas esser and me).  both of us erroneously
thought it was saying gpl.

the general advice is, if the licence is unclear or invalid, the
package should be regarded as nonfree.  i have changed the catalogue
entries for csplain, and for cstex (which contains csplain) to say
"licence=other" -- i.e., there's a licence statement, but it's not
classifiable.  under normal rules, such a package should be regarded
as nonfree.

you compare plain.tex's licence with your own.  plain.tex has a
straightforward licence, which says you may not edit it unless you
change its name.

now, csplain's licence says it's one thing and then says it's another.
you want people to obey your licence, but you choose not to obey the
conditions of use of the gpl: imo, that makes your licence unclear,
even if it's not invalid.  hence my remark.

if you think csplain's licence is the same as plain's, why not say
just that?  if you think it's something else, why not take a look at
the other "regular" licences that people know about.  for example,
there's the lppl -- far more complicated than knuth's, but with the
same general intent, except that when the author ceases to work on it,
there is provision for authorising an alternative maintainer.

I think you are out of commission.  How is Petr's donating a Czech
version of TeX "selfish"?  It is just that his chosen way of doing it
makes it hard to follow through with his wish of providing it to
others.  Products like TeXlive consist of the work of hundreds of
volunteers, and it is simply not reasonable to expect a license
analysis for every contribution, in particular when the license
appears self-contradictory.

Petr is not doing his own project a favor, but that can hardly be
called "selfish".  It would appear that the LPPL captures his intent
rather well, so he really should take a look at it, since adopting it
would make life a lot easier for all people involved.

As to "selfish actions": there can hardly be more selfish actions than
shouts of "contribute the way I like it" from the sidelines.

Which brings us to a different point, an idea that I had during the
weekend, anyway:  Where is the process of creating a pattern list for
TeX documented?  Is it automatable?  Are changes usually made directly
to the pattern list, or is the original word list changed and the
patterns regenerated?

I'm asking because we usually require the "sources", loosely defined as
"the preferred form for modification".  No, I don't intend to kick out
all those hyphenation patterns, even if your answer is "yes, one uses
the wordlist"; but nevertheless we should try to get as much wordlists
to some public repository in this case, and documented
pattern-generation rules.

(1) some more resonses from the cygwin group:
--------------------------------

2006-02-05  Corinna Vinschen  <corinna at vinschen.de>

       * include/features.h: Add comment to explain what's going to
happen
       here at one point.
       * include/sys/stdio.h: Guard getline and getdelim prototypes
with
       _GNU_SOURCE to avoid collision with old-style declarations.

3. If your code blindly uses "getline" without checking for an existing
version then it's probably broken -- as mentioned in these previous
threads, the Austin group will likely be adding the GNU version of
getline to the next revision of the POSIX standard, meaning your source
will soon be officially noncompliant.

This change doesn't seem(?) to be in /usr/include/sys/stdio.h from Cygwin
DLL 1.5.19-4.  So I think one may have to use CVS or a snapshot, rather than
"just" using the usual setup.exe procedure.
--------------------------------


(2) The good news for now is that with modifying the following files for the getline collision problem I was able to get a successfull build.

	*rename `getline' in t1asm.c
	#define getline t1getline to the top of the file.


	* modified cpascal.h to avoid getline conflict.


	* Rename "getline" in the following files:
		- mtpo.c 
		- afm2pl.c
		- dvistuff.c
		- afm2tfm.c
		- newobj.h  (affects newobj.c also)

I think.  The second time I tried to build I got the following error message.
Which just means that "Build" does not pre-erease or the "ln" can not ignore existing files?

/bin/install -c ../../../../TeX/texk/dviljk/dvihp /cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/dvihp
rm -f /cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/dvilj6; ln dvilj4 /cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/dvilj6

make[3]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/Work/TeX/texk/dviljk'

Tomorrow I will go through again and see if any of the binaries work.  Though I am not experience on actual usage yet....

I don't think we should accuse the author of intentionally misleading
us.  I can see no reasons for that; instead he's stated that he just
doesn't care a lot about those legal things, and wanted to be sure to
not get bugreports baout unforked versions.  

Since the "You must provide sources" argument of the GPL is kind of moot
for TeX input files[1], I think he should be well served with the LPPL. 


Regards, Frank


[1] Of a GPL'ed work, you have the right to get the dtx sources if they
exist.  But this is probably unenforcable in practice, because anybody
unwilling to produce them might just as well tell you he has lost them
and continued to edit the *.sty/cls/tex files directly.

The wordlists are not actually the preferred form for modification, I
think.  You start a semimanual process fresh from a new wordlist.  So
modifications are usually rather applied to the patterns.
Nevertheless, keeping word lists in store might be a good idea.
Though not the "preferred form for modification", they provide a good
starting point for people wanting to try their hands on the pattern
generation.

One problem might be that good word lists might not in all cases be
publishable, because one could obtain them only for the purpose of
generating TeX patterns.  Publishing houses will probably not want to
get them out into the wild in "raw" form useful for other typesetting
engines.

What about the following: Get a reliable list of UK English words
(probably sorted by frequency), apply the current UK patterns,
carefully check the results and regenerate the patterns.

I've done something similar to a German word list (creating a large
set of hyphenation exceptions).

good idea. curiously, my institution curates
a 100 million word corpus of British English
(http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/), marked up
to the word level; deriving a
list of words from that would be a rather
small bit of XML retrieval.

If I get the list of words, does anyone
else have the time and energy to make the
experiment?

Very much so. its a famous bit of research by Frank Liang,
encapsulated in the program "patgen" by Knuth. The details
are in the source of patgen

I suspect the former, in the rare cases that these things
are enhanced. One may adjust patterns by hand anyway.
I would regard the pattern list as a work in its own right,
and its own source.

"carefully check the results" is a bit of a toughy because 80% of
people get a significant number of British hyphenation patterns wrong
on first attempt.

"abbreviations thereof" is my wording, used to describe the long and

but to counter that, we know that 75% of statistics

are you saying the ukhyphen.tex is not good, or that

Because the leading position in the downward spiral of declining
standards is a target moving too fast for TeX's development cycles.
We can't seriously hope to compete in that market.

worse: users may not even be aware of hyphenation; i once ran into a 
user who praised tex's way of building paragraphs by mentioning that in 
300 pages not one hyphenation was needed, which of course was due to the 
fact that the us patterns were not loaded (which itself was due to the 
n^{th} change in the name of us pattern files and/or some funny aliasing 
and/or ...)

the _rules_ are so perverse that simply knowing them isn't enough.  i
know the rules, but because of gaps in my classical education (i
didn't do classical greek at school) i can never be entirely sure of a
guess at hyphenation.

which is why i keep an oxford dictionary of word division in my desk
at work.  (note, i don't keep one at home...)

ukhyphen.tex isn't bad; could be made to perform better if we were
allowed to publish exception lists, but phil (iirc) won't have that.

So Werner's plan would work well, then. We would
have new patterns, which could be augmented
occasionally.

As I said to Phil last week, I personally think that
the TeX system's much vaunted repeatability (every line break
from a decade ago will be the same now) is not
really very interesting. If you want that stability, don't
upgrade your patterns...

Not to mention the Czech users who work in other parts of the world
and rely on TL to provide cstex in a way that will not cause undue
extra work for admins.

It is important to encourage contributions from people like Petr, who
has raised some legitimate concerns.  Petr should see TL as making his
life easier, not harder.

It is apparent that writing and understanding licenses is not simple,
so there is good reason to stick with one of the widely used public
licenses.

There are many ways to deal with the problem of supporting free
packages.  One way is to be very specific about which versions are
currently supported and asking that anyone having problems install a
supported version.  Having your work in a widely used compilation such
as TL ensures that the installation procedures have been tested and
most conflicts resolved (and, given a reasonable OS, that a version
can be installed in a way that does not interfere with other installed
packages).

I am willing to do the patterns generation part.
But
-- BNC wordlist (which I have too) is full of non-English words,
   proper names, ..., who will do the cleanup?
-- The most time-consuming step is checking the hyphenated 
   BNC wordlist by somebody knowing the ethymology 
   of English words -- this is the rule OUP
   use in deciding on (UK) hyphenation points.
US people/publishers use quite different rules
(basically syllable-based).

Send me the cleaned UK wordlist and I'll do the bootstrap phase
(prepare the hyphenated list and list of
candidates for checking [potential exceptions]).

All the best

I believe the markup should let us do the filter. Words
_should_ be marked as names, foreign, etc.  The process
of cleaning up the BNC to XML is just about to finish.

great! lets see if we can do this. 
my colleague Lou Burnard is away this,
but I'll ask him to look at it next week (he
has the cleanest copy of the BNC).

It's not clear to me what you want to achieve with that tetexrpm
project.  If teTeX were still actively developed, I understand it might
make sense to keep packages for rpm-based distributions as compatible as
possible, and maintain them at a central place.  But now that it's been
abandoned, I don't see the benefit of this.

Either someone steps up and takes the task of maintaining teTeX; but
then the rpm creation is the smaller part.  The real work would be to
keep the texmf tree up-to-date, and to take care for the source tree.
This shouldn't be done with rpm packages as the main target (nor deb's,
for that matter), but with a standard "./configure; make; make install"
as it is currently.

Furthermore, I think the best thing we got from Thomas is the
infrastructure, which has been merged into TeXlive and is still
maintained by him there.  Work on selecting and updating CTAN packages,
and in creating useful collections, is probably better done within
TeXlive, or by making the MikTeX installer work with a preinstalled TeX
system.

I agree. Having rpm's is good just for a group of Redhat based systems. It
seems to me that having such a distribution as an alternative to TeXLive
is just a waste of human resources. I think that it would be better to
communicate with maintainers of Linux distributions and add TL to Linux
installation DVD instead of teTeX.

Yes and no.  The most important thing would probably have a _file
list_, or package list.  Whether one generates RPMs or DEBs or
whatever else from such a list would then be a secondary
consideration.

As someone who has to support actual (500+) *users* on a mix of
platforms in which RH-based systems (eg FC) play an increasingly large
role, can I make my 2? pitch for a TeXLive RPM?

Thomas did a brilliant job in producing and maintaining teTeX, but for
many years the tetex{...}.rpm collection was sadly out of date. I've
never actually found out why, or who was supplying it to the Red Hat and
FC repos, but supporting it meant explaining to users how to download
updated copies of the assorted bits and pieces necessary to make $x$
work (where $x$ was the particular package, style, font, feature, or
function the user needed for their book/thesis/essay/etc) -- because
they had installed the default RPMs along with their OS.  These are not
CS geeks, able to remove the RPMs and replace them with tetex from
source, or even from binaries, but engineers, mathematicians,
historians, linguists, physicists, and others who simply want packaged
installations to be updatable (eg via yum).

My recent tack has been to pull the tetex RPMs and replace with TeX Live
from whatever the then current CD/DVD was. This has fixed most of the
out-of-datedness problems, but introduced its own, because the default
installation directory changes every year. *I* can deal with this, but
the average user neither knows nor cares whether it goes in /usr/TeX,
/usr/local/texlive/yyyy or wherever: they simply want it to work, and
to be upgradable year by year. 99% of these are single-user systems,
so the need to consider multiple users is not relevant (the few multi-
user systems are capably handled by departmental admins who *do* know
where to put and find stuff).

If we can settle on a stable, reliable, and predictable location where 
TL-yyyy can be installed from an RPM, with a user-writable texmf-local
ready-configured into texmf.cnf and all binaries ready-linked to
/usr/bin, and a message to the installer to run texconfig immediately,
then we might be in a position to argue the replacement of the existing
tetex RPMs with TL RPMs.

I realise there are political arguments in the Debian field, and a
strong feeling in some quarters that we should only provide support to
sysadmins rather than end-users, but I worry that unless we admit that
the move is towards single-user workstations rather than shared lab
or departmental systems, we will end up making it so hard for users
to switch to TeX that we will be back in the pre-tetex days.

None of which should be read as detracting from the fundamentally great
job the tetex and TL communities have done in harmonising the whole
caboodle. Let's not let this opportunity slip.

Subject: [tex-live] adding xetex code to TL tree
Message-ID: <B82AA57A-F921-4D9F-B8BB-62B3A533EAEF@sil.org>

TeX Live developers -

I'd like to propose that I create a branch (which is a cheap  
operation in Subversion) in the TL repository, and add the xetex  
source code there. (I haven't been around the TL world long enough to  
know what policies/practices are normal here, hence this message.)

By way of background: for the most part, the xetex code lives in its  
own subdirectory at source/texk/web2c/xetexdir. Adding this directory  
should have no adverse effect on the rest of the TL programs.  
Similarly for the xdvipdfmx driver, in source/texk/xdvipdfmx.

However, there are also some modifications to a few of the common  
files in source/texk/web2c: texmfmem.h, texmfmp.h, texmfmp-help.h,  
and lib/texmfmp.c. I believe all the xetex changes are contained  
within #ifdef XeTeX conditionals, so that they should not affect  
building anything else. So these changes should also be "safe",  
though they will be visible to the maintainers of the rest of the TeX  
family.

There will also be new libraries in /source/libs, and an update to  
the freetype2 sources already there. The latter might have an impact  
on building fpTeX on Windows, as this seems to depend on freetype2  
(it is not used in a normal Unix build, as far as I can tell).

Finally (and most far-reaching), there will need to be additions to  
the makefiles and configure scripts at various levels, to integrate  
xetex into the overall TL build process. In principle, this shouldn't  
break anything else; there will just be a few new options and  
targets. But of course if xetex itself fails to compile on certain  
systems (which I fully expect at this stage -- after all, TL gets  
built on platforms I've never even seen!) this will halt the main build.

So it seems to me that the appropriate course is to create a branch  
and work there; once the code is in place, people can try building on  
various systems; and once any build-halting problems have been  
addressed, we can merge the new material into the trunk.

Feedback/suggestions invited......... thanks.

JK

Just to make that clear:  I answered to Michael's original mail about a
rpm repository for *teTeX*, which I see no big value in now that teTeX
won't get a further release.  rpm's for TeXLive are a completely
different thing; as much as I am happy that we now have Debian packages
for TeXLive, I also support to create rpms.

I always thought that the Debian teTeX packages were the outdated ones
(and the reason was in most cases: an unfortunate coincidence of the
long teTeX release cycles with the long Debian release cycles).  I don't
know how teTeX-rpms were handled for RH and FC.

However, even TeXLive has a yearly release cycle; so if a distribution
has a release twice a year, one of them might well contain a TeXlive
which is nearly a year old.

I must say that I did not use TeXLive at all until recently, so I don't
know about this.  But I'm surprised here, since the infrastructure and
the underlying kpathsea is the same as in teTeX.  And there, it was
never a problem:  If the file placement in the main rpms changes, some
variable in texmf.cnf is changed, but the locations for the
machine-specific or per-user directories didn't change at all.

I don't understand which "political arguments in the Debian field" you
are talking about, can you elaborate?

Vendors are starting to realize that TeX is important, in part due to
very popular "mission critical" systems such as the R stats package
that use LaTeX, but also need to be conservative about making changes.
 It is worth trying to work "with" vendors by filing bugs with them
and thinking about how TL can coexist with vendor packaging.  On
debian sid you can choose either tetex or texlive and most things will
work with either choice, but I think it is fragile and confusing for
users.

In my experience, users are very reluctant to give up the vendor
supplied packages.
They will use TL when it is installed (in a separate tree) by an
admin, but would balk at
installing it themselves or anything that meant deleting the vendor files.

By the time we get all that done, the majority of systems will have
decent support
for virtual machines, so maybe all you need is one linux distro that has TL.

No, for the majority of single user workstations users will live with
what vendors provide.

For now the priority should be to do a really good job with TL2006 so
people looking for an alternative to teTeX aren't disappointed.  It is
important to remember that TL2006
tries to support Win32, and that MikTeX and W32tex both have something to offer.

    the tetex{...}.rpm collection was sadly out of date. I've never
    actually found out why, or who was supplying it to the Red Hat

Years ago, I heard from a (non-TeX) friend at RH that they added a ton
of patches to support Japanese to their rpm's.  Those changes were never
backported to the mainstream distributions, and indeed I had never heard
about them.  So then RH said they can't update because it's too much
work to re-port their Japanese changes to a new release.  Nice, huh?

I didn't bother to try confirming or unconfirming this, and have no idea
what's currently in the RH or FC distributions.  I have other things to
do :).  My approach has always been to ignore the RH TeX installations
entirely and just install my own in /usr/local.  As anyone who installs
current TL could guess :).

    can I make my 2?? pitch for a TeXLive RPM?

If someone cares to volunteer to create TL RPM's, that would be great by
me, of course.  (I can't work on it myself.)  I kind of surmise that
some of the debian work could be reused.

Or, for that matter, maybe the .deb packages can be easily converted
directly to .rpm packages, if that's deemed suitable.

Best,

That is good, although it seems odd that Cygwin uses _GNU_SOURCE and
glibc uses __USE_GNU.

    meaning your source will soon be officially noncompliant.

The blithe unconcern of standards committees for backward compatibility
never ceases to amaze me.  I guess all the useless makework changing
names keeps programmers and managers employed, anyway.

    (2) The good news for now is that with modifying the following files
    for the getline collision problem I was able to get a successfull
    build.

Please send a diff, so I can install the changes.

Also, please contact the authors of the latter programs (with mtpo.c,
afm2pl.c, dvistuff.c, newobj.h), so they can update their original sources.

    Which just means that "Build" does not pre-erease or the "ln" can
    not ignore existing files?

Build does do a make clean (if there's a Makefile), and removes the Work
and inst directories.  It's a very short and simple shell script, take a
look.  Anyway, if you look at the command, you'll see that it explicitly
removes the link name before (re)making the link:

    rm -f /cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/dvilj6; ln
    dvilj4 /cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/dvilj6

    `/cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/dvilj6.exe' to
    `dvilj4.exe': File exists

I surmise the problem may be a hard link from the dvilj4.exe in the
*build* directory to dvilj6.exe in the install directory.  Probably that
rule has never been exercised with LN=ln before, only ln -s.  Does this
change for texk/dviljk/Makefile.in fix it?

I don't think that would be so bad a problem. There were occasions when
the tetex RPMs were distributed on the RH CDs with stuff that was three
years out of date (I think I'm remembering it right, it should be in ctt
somewhere: I queried it and SPQR confirmed it; I think it was the pdftex
binary on that occasion).

I'm sorry, I didn't make this clearer. Small changes within the TDS are
to be expected as it matures. I'm talking about the root. One year it
was /usr/local/TeX-Live or something, one year it was /usr/TeX, now it's
/usr/local/texlive/2005. Stand still, you bugger, I can't aim if you
keep moving :-)

Apparently there is some dispute among Debianites as to whether TeX is
truly free or not, and therefore whether it should even be included in
their core distro.

    I can't speak to the Debian ones as I never used them. Perhaps they were
    the same as the RH ones, repackaged.

My strong impression is that they were created and maintained
independently, even though both were usually wildly out of date :).
    
    One year it was /usr/local/TeX-Live or something, one year it was
    /usr/TeX, now it's /usr/local/texlive/2005.

Peter, I admit I don't understand what difference it makes to you what
the default path is.  It's just the default.  Don't you just override it
with whatever path you want for your systems?  If not, why not?

Anyway, this year it will be /usr/local/texlive/2006, unless someone
convinces me otherwise.  The reason I proposed and implemented the
year-based default is that it simply does not work to install TL X+1
onto the same directory where TL X was installed.  Nothing good can come
of that, and the default path shouldn't encourage thinking that it
works.  That was my reasoning, anyway.

I would expect .deb/.rpm/whatever repackagings to alter the root to
whatever makes sense.  In fact, as I understand it, the .deb's go to a
lot of trouble to move everything into a /usr/{bin,lib,share,...} kind
of setup, as is the usual practice.  I expect other general Linux
distributions would want to do the same, if anyone else ever bothers to
care about TeX ...

Hi Jonathan,

    know what policies/practices are normal here, hence this message.)

Not to worry, we have very little in the way of policy :).

    So it seems to me that the appropriate course is to create a branch  
    and work there; once the code is in place, people can try building on  
    various systems; and once any build-halting problems have been  
    addressed, we can merge the new material into the trunk.

Well, no doubt using a branch would be "safer", in a way.  But given the
realities of TL, I think it would actually be better to just check in
your changes to the trunk.

Unlike other projects, our problem is not that we have dozens of
developers doing builds constantly, so that build breakage causes
widespread problems.  Our problem is the opposite: it's hard to ever
find time to do builds, so any barrier (like checking out a branch) that
makes it more time-consuming to do a build simply increases the
likelihood that it won't be done.

BTW, if you want it, I'm sure that we can get you access to at least
some of the systems for xetex building and/or debugging purposes.  Let
me know.

Thanks,
Karl

Well, that suits me fine.... being accustomed to "sole developer"  
status, where I just do whatever seems good to me at the time, and  
have only myself to blame for the outcome. :) Don't want to inflict  
my gaffes on too many other folks, though!

OK, if that's your preference, I don't mind. Obviously, I'll try to  
be careful and non-disruptive, but I predict that something somewhere  
will break!

If anyone is unhappy with this, let me know.... otherwise, I expect  
I'll start checking in new code this week.

Sorry, I missed reposting what I originally wrote:

*I* can override it, so can my sysadmins. But it drives the end user
mad, doing what she considers an update to (say) 2006, only to find
that instead of updating last year's binaries and basics, it's
created *another new treeful* of them! complete with its own new
texmf-local. The user doesn't want to be bothered rememberinmg where
she installed the goddessdamned software 12 months ago, she just wants
it updated to the latest and greatest. Really.

I'm sorry, it probably looks like a trivial point to developers, but
it's not. You see it in the worst commercial software too (dare I
say Microsoft Internet Explorer? :-) and I really don't think we should
be emulating this.

Please let us fix the location and stick with it, and not be haring off
after every new damp squib that people invent. The next thing we know,
we'll be installing TL07 in /opt or some other tomfool place.

Consistent, excellent.

OK, if it must. Then we should at least do what any other developer
does, and provide a window saying so, or (better) offering to remove
TL2005 having moved texmf-local carefully out of the way, and then
softlink it back. Otherwise over the years the user will accumulate half
a dozen TL directory trees and wonder where all their disk space went.
You think they have time to *look* in /usr ever? :-)

I have a question about the following:

Can I change this to some like    /usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf  ??


I would like PATH to contain only one instance of .../bin/i686-pc-cygwin.
Any reason for there to be four of the same paths here?

    /cygdrive/c/tex/texlive/src/inst/bin/i686-pc-cygwin/updmap-sys; \


* Also the very last path does not seem to have a ':' in front of it?


I suppose this output was just to show me where everything was and to set PATH myself in profile files?

Ah, I see the "Build" script installs inside the pwd at the time its invoked.

I want to use the defaults ./configure --help shows, i.e.  /usr/local/texlive

So I assume that I can just edit Build and take out the --prefix and --datadir
overrides.  I'll try that next.

Some more questions.  Sorry.

The supplied "configure --help" gives the default --prefix dir as
/usr/local/teTex

and sometimes in the documentation it gives a 
/usr/local/texlive/2005  as the prefix dir (I think).  though it says for MacOs is /usr/local/teTex.

Is there any preferrances for the top level directory?


Thanks,

I started the project before I knew teTeX would be abandoned.
The intention was provide a way for addon packages and updates to be
installed. As an RPM should never own any file in /usr/local (where RH
puts TEXMFLOCAL) and I really like to have _everything_ on my system
under the management of RPM, creating a new TEXMF tree for updates was
the only option that would guarantee no file conflicts with present or
future packages.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but (I guess like teTeX) it looks like TeX Live
does not use "pristine" upstream sources, but rather creates zip
archives from what is on CTAN. While I'm sure that RPM files could be
created from the individual TeX Live zip archives, I think it is better
to use "pristine" upstream when possible. That may actually help avoid
situations where a license is mis-interpreted and a file is modified
that the upstream author did not want modified.

In fact with tetexrpm, even before the recent cstex issue, I had written
policy in the guidelines that patches would not be done at all because I
don't want tetexrpm to be a fork.

-=-
With respect to teTeX being "dead" now - sitting on my hard drive right
now is a set of "teTeX like" RPMs built from TeX Live 2005. I could not
use pristine source because of bootstrap issues (you need TeX installed
to unpack the dtx files).

I'm not quite ready to make them public, but I think it is the right
solution for people (like me) who like the teTeX packaging.

The "real work" of maintaining the texmf tree and the source tree IMHO
is not needed. Let TeX Live do that, and use the TeX Live yearly
snapshot as the base for the packaging of something that is equivalent
to current RPM packaging of teTeX. That way effort is not wasted.
Development for free UNIX LaTeX can continue in TeX Live, and when TeX
Live makes a release, the "teTeX like" packaging can then be created
rather easily from it. No need to maintain a separate source and TEXMF
tree.

I agree - let TeX Live be where development of working free TeX
continues.

I think it is better to use the pristine zip files as supplied by the
ctan contributors as much as possible, rather than building an RPM from
someone elses unpacking of those zip files.

With respect to MikTeX - I do not like to use multiple package managers.
I like to use one package manager. The fact that I can use one package
manager is a great benefit that Linux has over Windows and Mac OS X.

I use TeXLive on Linux and teTeX in OS/2. My problem in OS/2 is that
important packages are missing and I have to take them from somewhere else
(usually I get the corresponding zip file from the TL DVD, fortunatelly
the directory structure is very similar). On the other hand, I may be a
special kind of user.

I believe so. I just remind e-mails in this list from the last half year.
TL as well as other sources contain fonts that are believed to be free but
it was not sure. Developers of TL work hard to find the official message
stating that the fonts are free etc. You can find about the policy just by
reviewing the archive of the texlive list.

Well, as I said I never installed TeXLive from scratch (only using
Norbert's Debian packages), so I can't talk about that.  But any decent
rpm would circumvent this problem, and for end users nothing would
change (except they now have an up-to-date system).

I should be aware of that, being one of the maintainers of teTeX in
Debian...  No, the question is *what*exactly* the license conditions of
TeX, the program, are (and of MetaFont, the CM fonts etc.).  In fact
this seems to be all but clear, it also has been disputed, without a
result, on this list recently.

I'm going to dig through the archives to find statements by DEK one of
these days; but it's not going to result in TeX being declared as
non-free by Debian.  At least I would be *very* surprised.

I'm not sure whether the texlive list is the right place for this

According to Debian Policy, packages may not own any file in /usr/local,
but they may (and should) create empty subdirectories in /usr/local in
their installation scripts (and I don't think this violates the FHS).
Thus, it is easy to prepare support for a seamlessly working
TEXMFLOCAL.  

Actually, from our point of view it's easier to make installations in
TEXMFLOCAL work, than additional rpm's.  Instead of having
fmtutil.cnf, updmap.cfg and texmf.cnf, and now even language.dat as
configuration files, the packages now contain configuration directories,
and the actual configuration files are generated from the content of
these directories.  Attempts to handle for example updmap.cfg with calls
of "updmap --enable" or "--disable" in the installation/removal scripts
didn't work, because this would overwrite local changes.

But I think we've now found a way that makes it easy to create
additional deb's for fonts and similar things.

I am not aware that TeXLive makes any changes to files on CTAN.  They do
synchronize their development tree to CTAN on a regular basis.  How this
development tree is finally released is a different question; on an
ordinary TeXLive CD, the files are somehow compressed (I think it's zip
on a per-tpm basis).  But for the Debian packages of texlive, only a
couple of huge orig.tar.gz files is created which are then compiled, if
necessary, and split into appropriate installation packages (debs).

That's a reasonable approach.  For the Debian packages, we have applied
patches on rare occasions, but that is a decision we made as
distributors, with our release timeline as a reason.

It would be interesting to look at this.

I didn't get that mail, and it doesn't show up in the archives of
texlive (is there any for the tetex list? I'm only subscribed to
tetex-beta). 

I'd be more interested in reading Werner's mail than Zdenek's.

Maybe looking at the way the Debian texlive packages are split is
interesting for you.  The splitting is not yet satisfactory, but it's a
start.

There is a clear policy:

,---- http://www.tug.org/texlive/LICENSE.TL
| COPYING CONDITIONS FOR TeX Live:
| 
| To the best of our knowledge, all software in this distribution is
| freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis), within
| the Free Software Foundation's definition and Debian Free Software
| Guidelines.  If you find any non-free files included, please contact us
| (references given below).
`----

The TeXLive people have been equally responsive and helpful with license
problems as Thomas always has been.  As for the checking, I fear there
has been no complete and documented (reproducible) license auditing,
neither of teTeX nor of TeXlive.  We (some Debian people) are currently
doing that.  Or trying to, it's a huge amount of work.

We have developped a couple of scripts to merge information from the
TeXlive tpm files (for the Debian teTeX packages, these have been
adapted or will be), from the TeX Catalogue and from manual checking
into a copyright file that allows to trace the copyright of individual
files to their respective CTAN packages and licenses.  Writing and
testing the scripts was fun compared to doing the actual audit...

If SuSE, or anybody on the TeXlive list, is willing to join efforts, we
would be glad (and it should be easy to do it in the general TeXLive
context instead of the Debian source packages).

yes. a LOT of work has been done on this, and
though the tree is not as guarenteed clean as one
would like, anything which breaks DFSG is taken
out as soon as reported.

There are no fonts in TL which are not free or have an unclear
license.  If you find one though, please let me know.

There had been a discussion about the license of Adobe Utopia fonts
because it would be nice to have them in TL, especially because Thanh
wants to provide an extended version which supports Vietnamese.

But the fonts are not in TL.

There is some truth in that. However, as the user of a bunch of
rpm-based Linux systems, any software which does not come in an rpm is a
major pain and typically goes straight to the scrap heap. rpm was
invented to fix the stellar insanity that is make install PREFIX=/usr.

Thanks to Thomas (and others), getting a fully functional TeXMF system
took as much as insert SUSE DVD, click button. In comparison, what's TeX
Live? A CD which contains a TeXMF system which runs off that CD? Very
useful for evaluating the software. Thing is, I did that 15 years ago.
And is installing TL to hard disk more of the make-install insanity?
Thanks but no thanks. Other platforms? None here, so not exactly a
draw-card. There wasn't anything going for TL in the past (well for me).

Anything which doesn't give an rpm-installable TeXMF system including a
useful macro package set (think teTeX) is less than acceptable. No doubt
the Debs think the same.

If distributors can package up TL then it's fine, but currently tetex is
280MB and I expect distributors might be re-evaluating inclusion of it
if it jumps up by a lot. Would it be advisable/possible to split TL
somehoe sensible?

Hmmm ... I'm the maintainer of teTeX here at SuSE (we're not Redhat based).
Two major problems I see with TeXLive, first it is a HUGE one, therefore
I've to drop some stuff to get it fit to the size of teTeX .... next is:
is there a clear policy and check(!) about license stuff within the
TeXLive tree.

    If distributors can package up TL then it's fine, 

I repeat: if someone cares to *volunteer* to package TL as rpm's (or
whatever), or convert the deb's (or whatever), I am (and everyone else
is) all for it.  I will do what I can to help.  But I cannot take on the
actual work.  I hope someone does.

    but currently tetex is 280MB and I expect distributors might be
    re-evaluating inclusion of it if it jumps up by a lot. Would it be
    advisable/possible to split TL somehoe sensible?

TL has always supported installation of coherent subsets, called
"schemes" (at the highest level).  It would be technically easy to
define a "teTeX" scheme which contains the equivalent of what was in
teTeX.

The time-consuming part is going through and determining which TL
packages/collections correspond to the monolithic teTeX.  I hope someone
can volunteer to do this finite task -- I think several projects would
benefit.

TL already has a "medium" scheme (used to be named "recommended", except
what I recommend is the whole thing, given today's disk sizes) that
could perhaps be a starting point.

Best,
karl

    I'm going to dig through the archives to find statements by DEK 

I recently ran across yet another place where DEK pretty clearly stated
his wishes:
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf 

In particular, DEK writes:

       As stated on the copyright pages of Volumes B,
       D, and E, anybody can make use of my programs in
       whatever way they wish, as long as they do not use
       the names TeX, METAFONT, or Computer Modern.
       
Although this does not match the statement at the beginning of tex.web,
I am happy to take it (rather than tex.web) as definitive.  I think it
really is what Knuth wants.  I.e., it's fine to hack tex.web.

BTW, DEK also said that "derived" names (such as fooTeX) are ok, as
reported by Nelson Beebe:
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb13-1/tb34beebe.pdf (in the context of
of the "VTeX" variant).

For what it's worth ...

    it looks like TeX Live does not use "pristine" upstream sources, 

Where do you get that idea?  I don't make changes to what was released
to CTAN (or wherever the original source is, unfortunately not
everything is on CTAN, despite our continuing efforts).

It is true that we do run the ins's and otherwise rearrange packages
from CTAN as needed so that they are actually usable, i.e., in the
standard directory locations.  However, we don't modify the contents.

Of course it would be nice if what was on CTAN was all perfectly
arranged and configurable and could be downloaded and used without
any changes whatsoever.  That is not the reality.  It's been talked
about for a lot of years.

    The supplied "configure --help" gives the default --prefix dir as

Sure.

    and sometimes in the documentation it gives a
    /usr/local/texlive/2005 as the prefix dir (I think).  

That's the default in the TL installation script.  It is unrelated to
configure.

    though it says for MacOs is /usr/local/teTex.

It's a long story.

    Is there any preferrances for the top level directory?

You can choose anything you want.  I advise something with the release

    Ah, I see the "Build" script installs inside the pwd at the time its
    invoked.

Yes, the idea is that the Build script is used to create the binaries.
Just the binaries.  Then the binaries are manually copied to the Master
tree in bin/whatever.

If you do the usual configure && make && make install thing out of the
TL sources, you will not end up with exactly the same thing as if you do
a TL installation.  I do not know offhand what the differences will be,
and you can certainly try it and see if you get something usable, but I
don't advise it.

If it doesn't work, my suggestion would be to do a normal TL
installation (omitting all the binaries).  Then run the normal Build
script (with the result in inst subdir).  Then copy the
inst/bin/whatever directory to your installed location (/tl/root/bin).

Actually, now that I write that, I am not sure if it will work, or if
some of the binaries need to be run as part of the installation.  If so,
it'll be more complicated.

Guess you'll see.

Meanwhile, please do send a patch for the getline changes.

Thanks,
Karl

    The below fix you provided worked and the ./Build process ran succesfully.

    I suppose this output was just to show me where everything was and

Hi Peter,

    created *another new treeful* of them

Well, that's fundamentally how the TL installer works; there is no
"upgrade", there is only "install new".  For sure, it would be better to
have a way to incrementally update, but I cannot get my brain around how
to do it, and I have my hands overflowing already just with updating
packages.

Anyway, I guess Debian users will be able to update in the normal way
now, so at least that is some progress along your lines.

    I'm sorry, it probably looks like a trivial point to developers, but

I don't think it's trivial at all, I agree it's very important and
desirable.  I just can't provide it.

    Please let us fix the location and stick with it, and not be haring off
    after every new damp squib that people invent. The next thing we know,
    we'll be installing TL07 in /opt or some other tomfool place.

1) I changed it to /usr/local/texlive/2005 last year.
2) I think the location was /usr/TeX for the previous decade or so.
3) No plans to change it again, aside from bumping the year.
4) So I think your reports of constant changes are a bit exaggerated :).

    Then we should at least do what any other developer does, 
    and provide a window saying so, 

I'm not sure what happens if you give an existing directory to the
installer.  I think it should complain at that point ("TL can't be
upgraded, it can only be installed, sorry").  Can you try it?

    or (better) offering to remove TL2005 having moved texmf-local
    carefully out of the way, and then softlink it back.

Sorry, I don't see that that's possible.

    Otherwise over the years the user will accumulate half
    a dozen TL directory trees and wonder where all their disk space went.

Disks have grown faster than TL ever will ...

    You think they have time to *look* in /usr ever? :-)

Of course I don't expect users to look around in /usr on a routine
basis.  But they might take a gander if they do run out of space.


I know very well that users just want to install their packages and
forget about it.  I've made a number of changes to the TL install over
the past couple years so that the defaults have a better chance of
providing what "mostusers" would actually want.  Beyond that, I'm rather
at a loss.

It would also be possible, I assume, to define an "osdoc" scheme which
would just satisfy the requirements of OS distros which rely on TeX
for the handling of documentation, and which would be small enough to
include in such distros without taking up too much space.

I'm a user.

My empirical experience is that teTeX coming with the system is 
generally outdated.
My solution is to install TeXLive in ~/TLyyyy (not even every year; 
every other year is generally enough for my needs), and set my PATH 
accordingly. (Yes. That's a bit selfish. But I don't  have write access 
to /usr/local or /opt).
And I even dare recommending this solution to colleagues.
Hopefully, a direct rpm production by TeXLive (or even CTAN) would solve 
the problem of outdated version coming through rpms, but I don't see it 
   an easy task.

Bruno.

ah :-}

perhaps I meant "open source", not "DFSG".....

personally, I'd throw out the GFDL stuff, I suppose;
but I am no longer engaged enough in TL
to try and influence it.

I doubt whether this is worth the effort.  IIRC, SuSE has split teTeX
into several rpms, I'd be surprised if RH hadn't done the same.
Debian/Ubunut/... packages are also split, as are the Debian TeXLive
packages.  

Therefore I think we should rather try to come up with a reasonable set
of collections for creating rpms.  Probably also some rearrangements
between the collections are necessary; for example Norbert and Ralf are
currently collecting inconsistencies of font installation in the various
collections.

  TeXLive is not Debian's TeXLive, right?

  Document is not software, the meaning of free document
  not the same as free software.

Why not?  Is any layout document somewhere which specifies such
restriction?  'rpm' itself defintely does not have such limitation.
This does makes some sense in situations when a system is
reinstalled from scratch but /home and /usr/local (and quite likely
/opt) are kept intact from the old system.  Then indeed files in
/usr/local will be "orphaned" in an rpm sense; but if you are
re-installing anyway then you can reinstall "owner" packages as
well.  Possibly using --justdb flag to rpm.

> and I really like to have _everything_ on my system

There is also an option to put these things into an /opt tree.  You
are a "vendor" here in some sense.  Not adding these to TEXMF tree
directly allows you to update some of original files, with a proper
search order, as TeX will use the first one found.

I've had a couple (two) requests to see that now, so:

http://www.tetexrpm.org/texjive.html

There's still work that needs to be done (most notably, it does not seem
to link against system freetype even when I ask it to).

Also - I'm not sure why it is doing this, but it builds/installs
lcdf-typetools when I specifically ask it not to - deleting the
lcdf-typetools directory solves that though.

But is a start.

If someone wants to do for RPM what Debian has done - more power to
them, but this is works for me, and is preferable for me, maybe for some
others too.

    it would be nice if authors could even manage to produce packages that
    had some standard installation interface.

Well, it would be nice if there was a standard installation interface to
which authors could conform :).  (Although TL uses a `texlive:' target
in a Makefile if it exists, that's too much to ask of most authors and
shouldn't be necessary for most packages anyway.)

I've been thinking about that a little as I've struggled through adding
more and more special cases as I've been updating packages lately.  What
would be useful for me, and perhaps more palatable for authors, is a
file which says to which TDS directory each file (or directory) in their
package should be copied.  Something like:

foo.sty > tex/latex/foo/foo.sty
foo.dtx > source/latex/foo/foo.dtx

Plenty of variations and syntax and bells and whistles would need to be
worked out, of course, probably something to say which dtx file to run,
etc., etc.  All the stuff that is hardcoded in the TL scripts now,
in principle.

This is already what many authors are writing out in English in their
READMEs, so it wouldn't be much work for them to make a machine-readable
file out of it.  Most of our special cases are because (say) foo.tex
should be installed in package X, but is a doc file in package Y.  It
would be nice not to have determine this by guesswork on my part, which
is what it comes down to now.

At least something like this would be a step forward toward being able
to install direct from CTAN.

Reactions?

No, since apparently Sebastian is not exercising his superpowers :), my

I will write something about this in LICENSE.TL.  Actually, I thought I

    (1). I am using the source tarball available at
            http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/source/source.tar.bz2
        (This is Oct 27, 2005 made tarball.)
        N.B. It might be nice to have a date or version number in the filename.

I guess it couldn't hurt.  Thanks.

    (4) Here are the patches.  All of them.

Thanks.

	Which ones did you want me to send?

Send to the program authors, you mean, I assume:
t1utils dvi2tty afm2pl ttf2pk

    (5) Question.  If I just use "Build" I get all these files in
        ...inst...  but no install script mentioned in the manual?  

It's at the top level of the Master/ directory -- install-live.sh in
this case.
        
        I would like to write directions for people like me who want to
        just build there own from the source.

Well, it would be great to have better instructions on the ins and outs
of TL creation and installation.  Something I've wanted to write ever
since I got involved enough to know just how chaotic it is :).

As I explained before, our practice has been to build the binaries
separately and then copy the binaries into the Master tree.  I mean
something like:
cd /tl/root/source
./Build
cd inst/bin
cp -pr newarchname /tl/root/Master/bin

The Master tree is what eventually becomes the distribution.  There is
no "configure && make install" process which generates it.

In order to get the Cygwin architecture to be recognized by the install
scripts, it has to be added to a few lists.  If you search for "aix" or
something in Master/*.sh, you will see.  Or I can do it easily enough.
What is the architecture name for cygwin?

Thanks,
k

I did not mean to imply that they were forks. I apologize for my poor
choice of words.

What I meant is that the TeX Live archives are a packaging themselves
and are not the pristine source, just like rpm packages are packages
themselves, or slack .tgz are packages, or debian .dpkg are packages.

Fedora packaging of teTeX 3.0 has the Japanese stuff inside it.
At least it does for FC4 and FC5. I can't speak for RHEL, as I do not
use it for anything.

The Japanese patching looks to me like it is mostly the addition of
files, rather than the patching of what Esser had in the source.

I would think it would be better to do it as a separate package
completely, but I don't know who made the decision and why, or what the
history of it is. From the obsoletes/provides I'm guessing it use to be
a separate packaging.
