Sure, You are absolutely right.

This is intentional, as on Windows it is not so clear what's $HOME :-)
So texmf-var is dedicated for all config files and should be writeable.

Yes, we are listening carefully all messages. 
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/tlpmgui-1.10.exe
was corrected in that regard. Thanks for pointing that.
Anyway, we still need more input/help how to do better installer

I was just woundering if any of you had any experiences with having a 
multi arcitecture TeXLive setup including MAC OS X where the MACs mounts 
the TeXLIve directory through NFS?

I'm considering setting it up for our secretaries, because afterwards it 
means less work for me. But I know nothing about MACs, so I'd like to hear 
if anyone had any experiences with it.

I'm only interested in mounting the TeXLIve stuff and just readonly.

Lars Madsen <daleif@imf.au.dk> asks on Wed, 1 Mar 2006 03:05:20 -0700
(MST) about NFS-mounting the TeXLive tree to Mac OS X systems.

We do that here at Utah, and it works fine.  Our TeXLive tree resides
on a Solaris 10 SPARC server, and is exported to clients running Mac
OS X, GNU/Linux, OSF/1, IRIX, and Solaris.

The issue to watch out for with Mac OS X is that it supports two
styles of file systems, one HFS+ (case-INsensitive with resource and
data forks) and one UFS (case-sensitive and forkless).  Some systems
have both, while others have only one.  In principle, Apple intends
users to migrate to UFS, but we have found that some commercial
applications, and Apple's own Classic Mac environment, will only
install on an HFS+ system.  

At least one release of Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.x would not install on
a UFS system until we found a lettercasing error in its installation
script that had gone unnoticed on HFS+ system where the typo didn't
matter.

Still?

Given that HFS+ now does ACLs (and that HFSX is case-sensitve), I
seriously doubt hat UFS has a long-term future in OSX.

Hi everybody,

some formats depend on existing formats, mostly on latex.fmt, and
load the file when they are generated.  Currently, when all formats are
created with "fmtutil(-sys) --all", this means that latex.fmt (or
whatever) will be generated twice.  The reason is that first latex.fmt
is generated, but it's lying in the temporary directory and not found by
kpathsea.  When it comes to jadetex.fmt, latex.fmt is not found,
mktexfmt is called, latex.fmt is put into TEXMF(SYS)VAR, and jadetex.fmt
is created.  When all is finished, the first latex.fmt is moved to
TEXMFSYSVAR. 

The problem with that is not only that latex.fmt is generated twice,
which just takes some time.  More annoying is the fact that in such a
case, 

fmtutil-sys --all >/dev/null

spits out the TeX output of the second generation of latex.fmt on the
terminal (because mktexfmt is supposed to only echo the generated
filename on stdout).

fmtutil sets and exports TEXINPUTS="$tmpdir:$TEXINPUTS", but that is not
sufficient.  One has to set TEXFORMATS, too.  I therefore suggest the
following patch, based on teTeX-3.0's version:

A follow-up: The AFM file `pcrr8a.afm' in TeXLive doesn't fit with the
file `pcrr8a.pfb' (Courier version 001.003).  The latter doesn't have
`Idot' but `Idotaccent'.

After some further inspection I've found out that it's even worse: For
example, the glyph `zdotaccent' is present in the font but not in the
AFM, or the glyph `zcaron' is mentioned as a composite only in the AFM
(having a `CC' line) but is a real glyph in the PFB, etc., etc.

Message-ID: <200603140047.k2E0lLx17080@f7.net>

Hi everyone,

I hope I've managed to create a workable svn repository (fsfs) for TeX
Live with the current sources.  I reworked the scripts enough so I could
do a build and make an image, anyway.  (No doubt it'll be totally broken
for everyone else.)  You can browse the thing on the web at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive.

I wrote a couple subversion intro web pages at
http://tug.org/texlive/svn.  (There is plenty more to write about TL
specifics, but since we never had anything before, I figured it wasn't
on the critical path.)  In particular, there's a simple form to get an
svn account for write access at http://tug.org/texlive/svn/svnuser.cgi.
Request away ...

A couple notable changes:
1) I moved Master/Tools to Build/tools.  This was the only directory in
   Master which did not go on the CD, and it relates to building, so ...

2) As we discussed previously, the sources are now directly in
   Build/source, without the extraneous TeX/ subdir.  And there is no
   source.development sibling directory; when and if it comes time, we
   can make a branch in the normal way.

I hope to get back to working on the many pending package updates and
other issues now ...

BTW, if anyone has svn experience and has time & interest to help
administer our setup, let me know.

Thanks,
Karl

A fine thing of P4 was the ability to exclude some directories from
checking out.  Can subversion do something similar?  In particular, I
only need binaries for x86, not for the other platforms...

I don't know a direct way, but you can check out the whole bunch, then 
rm -rf the directories you don't need, and edit the file .svn/entries
in the parent dir to remove the <entry .../> you just deleted.

Eg after full check out
	cd ....../bin
	rm -rf alpha-linux
	vi .svn/entries
		# remove the entry
		# <entry
		#	name="alpha-linux"
		#	kind="dir"/>

Probably there is a simpler way ...

CORFE (n.)
An object which is almost totally indistinguishable from a newspaper,
the one crucial difference being tat it belongs to somebody else and
is unaccountably much more interesting that your own - which may
otherwise appear to be in all respects identical. Though it is a rule
of life that a train or other public place may contain any number of
corfes but only one newspaper, it is quite possible to transform your
own perfectly ordinary newspaper into a corfe by the simple expedient
of letting somebody else read it.

Yes, there is - IIRC Florent Rougon explained the details on
debian-tetex-maint@lists.debian.org last summer when we moved to
Subversion.  It went along

svn checkout -N trunk
cd trunk
svn checkout <interesting directory>
svn checkout <other interesting directory>

Then IIRC you have to add the new directories and will get the "success
message" `already under version control' or similar.

Apparently the direct answer is no :(.  The question was asked on one of
the mailing lists:
  http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2003-08/0530.shtml
  (among others)

I see no signs that the developers care about it or are working on it.
Sigh.  Couldn't hurt if you added your voice to the chorus of people who
want it, if you feel like writing them.

The workarounds which Norbert and Frank posted are it, I guess.

The problem is the GFDL; GNU manuals generally include invariant

arguments have some merit, but I see no particular reason to perpetuate
their decision into TL.  (Which would mean removing the Texinfo manual

actually, when a manual contains a verbose copy of some licence that

Yes, but that is a consequence of the license's nature, and therefore
inevitable.  Debian encourages license authors to allow creation of
derivative licenses, but it doesn't require that - it's questionable
whether and to what extend legal texts are copyrightable, anyway.

TL-2005 had been frozen 2005-11-01.  Hence, what you observed sounds
quite reasonable.

Seems like it should be asking for the password somewhere.  Are you sure
you got a writable hierarchy?  Try making a trivial change to some file
and committing it.

I'll have to re-investigate.  I thought the username:password thing had

I (or someone, if anyone else wants to take a crack at it, that would be

it has to read the svn logs, however that is done.

I checked out my copy with

But submitting a change DID do the following (soory for the german)

No problem. When you first submit something, it will ask you the
password, after this the password is saved in
	~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/somestupidfilehash

At least here it worked like this.

And yes, the invocation
	svn://preining:password@....
is wrong. It doesn't work. (Grm, I have to either move my repository or
recheck out the whole stuff).

Hi Karl, hi all!

First of all I want to say that I like svn. I use it a lot.

But then:
$ time svn up
U    Master/readme.de.html
Aktualisiert zu Revision 1545.

real    16m5.871s
user    0m18.909s
sys     0m6.876s

Uffff.....

(this is laptop with 2.2GHz, but I guess the hard drive is the limit, as
the svn process was permanently in D state)

that I should proceed anyway :).

Is it better if you do another svn update right away?  (Because, one
would hope, a lot of it will be in the disk cache.)  That is what I
found.  (Of course, that doesn't help with real-world activities where
it's accessed every so often, but at least it would help with
understanding.)

About all I can say is that if you're working within a particular area,
you can just svn update there, and not routinely do the whole tree; save
that for cron.  That's my approach anyway.  I don't think there is any
other (free) source control system that operates like p4.

Sorry,
Karl

For what it's worth - I'm not actually a texlive developer, but I am a
Debian developer -, I don't think texlive needs to follow Debian here.
While I think the GFDL is a really bad license, whether it's actually
non-free, and what freeness means for documentation is not even
uncontroversial within Debian.

Just make sure that you never have any non-world-readable files in the
repository, or at least non under GFDL, because that would be a license
violation.  The same is true for local copies, but who cares?

Obviously.  When I update the first time I get:

Updated to revision 1545.

real    2m46.333s
user    0m5.108s
sys     0m2.280s

and when I try again I get:

At revision 1545.

real    0m40.359s
user    0m4.432s
sys     0m0.732s

I suppose that you get a similar result if you try again.

$ strace -eopen svn update svn/ 2>&1 | wc -l
26220

This takes some time, of course.

  Reinhard

I just would like to make two points: First, using the GFDL does not
necesarily mean that there are invariant parts in a document. You may
use the GFDL and make the document as a whole variable, as I did with
l2tabuen because I think there are good points for using the
GFDL. 

Secondly, putting software (or whatever content) under an
English-language license is not legally binding towards private users
under German law -- and probably elsewhere neither. This only matters
to entrepreneurs. For binding non-entrepreneurs you would have to add
a German translation that is authoritative with the software. 

J?rgen.

Has this idea been tested in court? not to my knowledge.
Legal experts may predict this interpretation of the law,
but when it comes before a judge they may see it differently.

Yes, but the badly phrased DRM clause doesn't have to do anything with
invariant sections.

On the contrary, there is no rule in german law that a contract has to
be in german.  This might be different for "Allgemeine
Gesch?ftsbedingungen", but which of the two a software or documentation
license is is not clear.

There has been one court ruling in favor of the GPL in germany, but this
was just an "einstweilige Verf?gung", and it wasn't against a private
user.  The texlive project or anyone pressing DVDs of it probably
wouldn't count as private, either.

Right. We could make contracts even in Latin, if we liked.

...and a license such as the GNU licenses is indeed an "Allgemeine
Gesch?ftsbedingung" and, yes, it is a different case for these.
That's one of the reasons why KOMA-Script contains a German version of
its license.

The said decision by Landgericht M?nchen was explicitly in favour of
the GPL just *because* the case was about a contract between
entrepreneurs. It said, professional IT people usually understand what
an English license means. But it's a different case for consumers.

BTW, consumer-protection law is the same all over the European
Union. So it won't make much of a difference where you are in
Europe. The discussions in the debian-legal mostly don't consider
this. 

This is no point for GNU licenses only. It holds true for any license
that is available to the user in English only. You cannot agree to
something you don't understand for sure.

Hi,
I tried to compile the texlive system which is now in svn.

The first problem is that in Build/source/Work/texk/devnag/src
automake-1.6.2 is required but I had only version 1.6.3.  The problem
disappeard when I installed 1.6.2.  However, I fear that just
downgrading the files provided by Gentoo will cause problems when I
update the system.  So I installed it in my $HOME.  Are newer versions
of automake more tolerant?

Make still aborts with the following messages:

I have no experience with automake at all and devnag.c is assumed to be
just compiled manually without problems. Some complications may arise with
the latest version which is now only on CVS. It needs case insensitive
string compare. Thi is the comment:

 Notes for compilation:
 Some C libraries do not contain strcasecmp but contain either stricmp
 or strcmpi (or both) with the same syntax. If it is the case of your
 compiler, use -DHAS_STRCMPI or -DHAS_STRICMP. GCC/EMX for OS/2
 requires -DHAS_STRICMP, gcc 3.3.3 in Linux as well as gcc 2.95.2
 from mingw (Windows) know strcasecmp.

This is the relevant code:
#ifdef HAS_STRCMPI
#define strcasecmp(s1,s2) strcmpi(s1,s2)
#elif HAS_STRICMP
#define strcasecmp(s1,s2) stricmp(s1,s2)
#endif

Maybe you can advice us how to reorganize the code so that those, who do
not have automake, can easily compile it manually, and those with automake
can compile it automagically. We could modify the code before version 2.14
is released to CTAN.

Thanks for the info.  The TeXLive version I checked out is that which
is on the TL-2005 CD/DVD.  Hence I think that there is a problem with
the tools I use.  Maybe someone can tell me what I have to do to avoid
this error without changing something in the TL tree.  Such a change
would be lost after the next update anyway.

  Reinhard

After I installed ~/.subversion/config I succeeded to compile TL.

Yesterday, I ran some experiments with the subversion retrieval of TeX

starting with an empty target directory, and then doing updates three

I guess it would take some effort to understand why.  The
devnav/src/Makefile.am just says:

bin_PROGRAMS = devnag
devnag_SOURCES = devnag.c

So it is not that which is requiring 1.6.3.  I'm sure it makes no actual
difference which is used.

Also, automake should not have to be run at all in the course of a
normal build.  Probably a timestamp problem.

Anyway, I'm very glad it worked after you got the config file.

    devnag.c is assumed to be just compiled manually without problems.

For teTeX/TeX Live (and other distributions I imagine), we cannot
compile things "manually"; there are dozens of programs and a bunch of
architectures, and therefore everything has to get built with standard
Makefiles.  This is one reason why many of the programs on CTAN are not
included.

     Some C libraries do not contain strcasecmp 

Since TL does not attempt to support OS/2, this is not a problem for us.
All our architectures have strcasecmp; any even somewhat modern system
should have it.  So I don't think you need to do anything more than you
have already done.

Best,
Karl

That's clear. I just do not have any experience with building such a huge
multiplatform project as TL is.

Why not? Is there any other reason than lack of volunteers who could help?
Jun Sawataishi compiled web2c for OS/2 and Jaromir Kuben tuned it to work
smoothly. I now can copy the texmf trees from Linus to OS/2, add the
binaries, OS/2 ports of ksh and gnu*utils, set some environment variables
and it works. I have some problems with updmap. I have to add the map
files to updmap.cfg manually, updmap --enable MixedMap something.map ends
with some error message. Maybe something else needs to be set but I had no
time to examine it yet.

I do not know whether subversion for OS/2 exists, maybe someone from
NetLabs has already ported it.

Hi Zdenek,

That is the only reason.  If there is anyone or any group who can build
TL for OS/2, that would be all to the good.

    I do not know whether subversion for OS/2 exists, 

Google for  subversion os/2  turns up some likely-looking links.

A timestamp problem is very likely.  The config file says:

  use-commit-times = yes

I now removed automake-1.6.2 and tried again.  Everything works now.
It seems that the svn config file is absolutely necessary.

BTW., a very useful program is sam2p.  It converts bitmap graphics to
eps/pdf more efficiently than most other programs.  See:

  http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p/

It would be nice to have it in TL-2006.  If the build process is not
usable for TeXLive, I think that it is not a big task to convince
Peter to provide support.

  Reinhard

I would be very happy to have sam2p in TL.  Can you ask Peter, please?

In general, it would be great to have more programs in TL, but the
overhead of figuring out the automake support is usually too much :(.

I posted earlier about a problem with the config files in the

read-only situation for me.

Now I've noticed something related. Perhaps this behavior is to be
expected, but I was surprised. Changing config.ps is sufficient to
ensure that .ps files are created with letter size paper, but
changing pdftexconfig.tex is not sufficient to ensure letter paper
in pdf files made by pdflatex. I found you must also recreate the
formats. If this is correct behavior, it should be added to the
appropriate section in the TeXLive documentation for Windows.

Just choose linux! TeTeX's "texconfig[-sys] paper letter" knows which
files to edit.   Some North American should port texconfig to perl so
the favorite North American OS can be used with the favorite North
American paper sizes.

Don't forget texmf-var/dvipdfm/config/config.

Another other paper size surprises for people using plain pdftex with
\magnification
was mentioned on the tetex list.  Even though you specify truein for
the page size in pdftexconfig.tex, the values are affected by
\magnification so need to be adjusted accordingly.  The fix is to get
people to stop using \magnification. A new pdftex.ini (+rebuild
affected formats) works for some people, but one colleague has a book
that is still getting magnified paper size using a format generated
with the new pdftex.ini.  Other tools (dvisvgm) are also confused by
\magnification.

Hi Harriet,

    changing pdftexconfig.tex is not sufficient to ensure letter paper
    in pdf files made by pdflatex. I found you must also recreate the
    formats. 

Ideally, the Windows installer would offer an option to set the paper
size before any formats are created, to avoid the problem.  If it's not
already there ... Staszek, Pawel?  Thomas F. did something similar in
the protext setup.

As George mentioned, "texconfig paper letter" is supposed to do the
trick on Unix, and is again supposed to be run at the end of the
installation, before any formats are made.  (In TL'05 it actually
remakes *all* the formats, which was a bug, but anyway.)

    PS All this seems like cruel and unusual punishment for using letter
    paper.

Well, the default pretty much has to be one thing or the other.
Sebastian R. (in England) started TeX Live lo these many years ago,
and Thomas E. (in Germany) started teTeX even longer ago, so ...

Perhaps there's a general registry setting or something that could be
inspected on Windows?  I don't know.  I don't know of anything
systemwide on Unix, except possibly the time zone.  But that seems
fraught with peril.

    (Admittedly this is a BAD THING, but most of us have no
    choice ;-)

I wish we benighted Americans could switch to A4 paper, the metric
system, and a halfway rational president, but it seems unlikely to
happen any time soon :(.

On Debian, there is libpaper. It reads /etc/papersize and environment

since normally the layout depends on the papersize, it's a document property so it makes sense to configure it at the document source level, and not in registries or so; when print (e.g. using acrobat) the printer driver can rescale the output to some local (letter, A4, whatever) print paper format

Thanks for the info, but since it doesn't exist even on Red Hat
(/etc/papersize doesn't either), it seems of rather limited
applicability, unfortunately.  Unix just never had a centralized place
to store that info, useful as it would be.

Well, I'd like to use Linux, but I have to tell people on this

Good point. There isn't a config file for dvipdfm under the
texmf-var tree, so people will have to copy it from the texmf tree
and then modify.

Yes, I don't object to the default being A4-- Just wish switching to
letter weren't so involved. I don't even mind editing the config
files (esp. if they are not read-only to start with).
What surprised me was that it didn't used to be necessary to
recreate the formats; just changing the config files was enough.
(And this still is enough for config.ps.) So something has changed
within the last year or two (I didn't use TL2004 because of lack of
Windows installer) that made pdflatex need new formats after the
config file is changed.

Well, it is not a task for tlpm, that was made to trace dependencies 
between packages and files in texmf trees, rather then prepare and 
configure ready-to-use TeX environment for specific system and user 
preferences. Depending on the macro package / formats / engines one use, 
such a default paper size setup is to be specified in a different place. 
For dvips it is source-independent config, in ConTeXt it is to be 
specified in the source document or cmdline option, in LaTeX i have no 
idea but probably not more then one command somewhere. And nowadays when 
we have pdfTeX that allows to specify media size explicite (and compile 
it into the format) i see no point and no place for such a default setup.

Use LaTeX or ConTeXt and you can set the papersize in the document.

Three cheers. From an aesthetic point of view, the ISO sizes suck.
The 1:\sqrt2 proportions may please the mathematician and logician
but they really are too tall and too narrow for easy reading.

Unfortunately the convenience of being able to fold and fold and fold
and reduce and reduce and reduce has seduced most people into believing
that the ISO sizes are some kind of ideal nirvana.

Things are different now that people are using pdf workflows.

I often deal with multi-author documents that get passed around the
globe.  Author A in North America gets a draft from author B, who
lives in Germany.  The first thing A does is  run the file thru TeX
and send it to the printer.  With .dvi files, the document could use
A4 paper, but dvips gets the final say, so in practice both authors
get the same layout, just different margins.

Today, using pdflatex, if the document uses the local default, all is
well until author A reports a typo on page N, which is on page M in
author B's copy, resulting in a lengthy exchange of emails before
minds can meet.  If the document explicitly sets the page size (to
A4), the printer then ignores all jobs while waiting for someone to
insert A4 paper.  Many people try to fool the printer by adjusting the
tray to "A4", which just produces jams when given letter paper.

Many long-time TeX users have their own styles, especially for
book-length projects.
I looked at one today that "borrowed" from an older version of eplain
that had explicit sizes coded as 8.5in by 11in (current eplain uses
truein).

I'd prefer defaults designed to ensure that the most common cases (A4
and letter) get the same paragraph layout and page breaks.  Rescaling
PDF's for printing as Hans mentioned sometimes produces artifacts
(such as invisible "minus" signs), so it would be better to print A4
on letter or vv at 1 to 1 scaling with some intelligent cropping to
avoid bad margins.

I actually tried to buy A4 paper in Nova Scotia once, mainly for
reports being submitted to European agencies.  Yes it is available,
but paper is perishable so the sellers don't want to get stuck with
inventory.  As a result, the minimum order was a full shipping pallet.

Subject: [tex-live] KPSE_DOT in fmtutil: Why set to `pwd`?
Message-ID: <86hd5ourtj.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

fmtutil has the following code:

  thisdir=`pwd`

  : ${KPSE_DOT=$thisdir}
  export KPSE_DOT

Can somebody explain to me the reason for this?  It turns out that it
grieves some users, because they get root without changing the
directory, and assume that as long as root's HOME directory is clean,
nothing bad should happen - but in fact configuration files, like
texmf.cnf, in the current directory are read.  Or tried to read, the
user who reported this as http://bugs.debian.org/358330 has an
nfs-mounted homedir in which root has no right to read files, and always
gets error messages:

/users/huron/danjean/texmf.cnf: Permission denied

This is just annoying, but might become a problem if random
configuration files are lying around (e.g. backups).  

And if it doesn't serve anything, why not drop it?  On todays system,
with TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFLOCAL, I don't see why it
is necessary to have fmtutil read files in the current dir, let alone
fmtutil-sys.

Not going to ignore you, but can't see any relation between the lack of 
letter/a4 defaults and painful upgrades. Upgrades are painful indeed, 
because two subsequent TLs never match the previous, that is because 
there are still people thinking how to make things better and better -) 
Anyway, the configuration part might be a horror, as configuring any 
other nonGUI system and I agree that some kind of tex 'contol panel' is 
necessary to popularize TeX. Will think about.

So which way the world operate?? Certainly, the world doesn't use TeX. 
It is not just Hans theory, that document size and layout are dependent 
-- sounds quite obvious to me. Pure TeX doesn't allow to specify the 
final page brutto size and *that* is the way the world doesn't operate 
nowadays. Anyway, as you, I don't feel like continuing paper-debate. For 
the moment I have no doubts, that some tex-config-helper would be fine. 
And no ideas how that should work -) Meybe Tomek or Staszek has -- will 
discuss.

All the best,

TeX itself is non-gui, so I don't see a problem with pdftexconfig.tex.
What is a problem is that dvips, dviout, dvipdfm, etc. all have
different configuration files and that various formats have hard-coded
papersizes
depending on the author's location.  I've been trying to get rid of
.dvi files for years, but they are like the cat that came back.

So the default layout should work for both A4 and letter (and the
output device should guess at the appropriate papersize).  If someone
wants to adjust the layout they should be able to do that in the
document rather than yet another configuration file.

A tex-config-helper is the best that can be done without the
participation of dviX authors, but it masks the underlying problem.  A
robust, portable, command-line tool can be hidden under a GUI if
someone cares enough to write one (or even
attached to a button in some editor).

    Can somebody explain to me the reason for [KPSE_DOT]

I've forgotten, if I ever knew.  Thomas?

I have a few observations, not especially related to the original report.

1) kpathsea/expand.c says (and implements):
/* If $KPSE_DOT is defined in the environment, prepend it to any relative
   path components. */

2) the fmtutil script only actually uses KPSE_DOT in
   recreate_by_hyphenfile:
    ./*)
      hyphenfile="$KPSE_DOT/"`echo "$hyphenfile" | sed 's@..@@'`
      ;;
    *)
      hyphenfile="$KPSE_DOT/$hyphenfile"

3) mktexpk and mktextfm use KPSE_DOT (in an unimportant way, just to
   move a log file) without defining it, as far as I can see.

One well-known TeXer in Canada told me that she asked her regular

"Sure," he said, "what size?"

No, the file is only read because of KPSE_DOT.  Or rather, it seemed to
be, in the log that Vincent posted to the Debian bug:

,----
| Here is now what I tested :
| root@atsina danjean# TEXMFVAR=/var/lib/texmf
| root@atsina danjean# TEXMFCONFIG=/etc/texmf
| root@atsina danjean# RUNNING_AS_SYS=true

| /users/huron/danjean/texmf.cnf: Permission denied
| /var/cache/fonts
| 
| So the messages are due to the lines 560-565 of fmtutil:
|   thisdir=`pwd`
| 
|   : ${KPSE_DOT=$thisdir}
|   export KPSE_DOT
`----

He executed all variable setting stuff that happens when calling
fmtutil-sys (the RUNNING_AS_SYS is a Debian-specific hack for backwards
compatibility that we hope to be able to drop soon).

But I'm confused, since here the behavior is different:

,----
| frank@riesling:~$ kpsewhich --format=cnf texmf.cnf
| /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
| frank@riesling:~$ export KPSE_DOT=/home/frank/
| frank@riesling:~$ kpsewhich --format=cnf texmf.cnf

| /home/frank/uni/zuerich/Praktikum/auto/texmf.cnf: Permission denied
| /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
| frank@riesling:~$
`----

(this .../auto/ directory somehow lost it's x permission, therefore
couldn't be read and searched for a texmf.cnf file, but there's none).

So this means that on my system KPSE_DOT is not searched for cnf files,
but it seems to be searched for TEXMF trees?  kpsewhere doesn't show the
local copy, either.

Vincent, what's the output of:
  kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFCNF'
and do you have the environment variable TEXMFCNF set?

So seems that there's a . somewhere in Vincent's TEXMFCNF.

That's a bit weird.  And what's it doing traversing the /home/frank
tree, anyway?

What's your output of kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFCNF' ?

I have no TEX.. variable set :
danjean@atsina:~$ sudo su
root@atsina danjean# export | grep TEX

And still the different behavior weather KPSE_DOT is set or not :
root@atsina danjean# kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFCNF'
{/usr/bin,/usr,/}{,{/share,}/texmf{-local,}/web2c}::/usr/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/share/texmf/web2c
root@atsina danjean# export KPSE_DOT="/users/huron/danjean"

{/usr/bin,/usr,/}{,{/share,}/texmf{-local,}/web2c}::/usr/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/share/texmf/web2c

For my personnal information, what is the real problem ?
1) KPSE_DOT should not be set to PWD in fmtutil ?
2) kpsewhich should not look at $KPSE_DOT directory ?
3) other ?

  Best regards,

$ kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFCNF'
{/usr/bin,/usr,/}{,{/share,}/texmf{-local,}/web2c}::/usr/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/share/texmf/web2c

That's independent of the setting of KPSE_DOT, whereas the error message
isn't.

What's the output of
  kpsewhich --show-path=cnf | tr : \\n

You know, searching for texmf.cnf is special. It has a search path which
is not defined in texmf.cnf.

The reason for me to implement KPSE_DOT in all kind of scripts (mktexpk,
fmtutil etc.) was to try to immitate a regular call of mf / tex as close
as possible. I.e. people might have a local hyphenation pattern file
which they could use via
  tex -ini ...
I wanted that the tools work in the same way. Since the tools chdir away,
I somehow had to adjust the search paths.

Instead of setting individual search paths, I thought that KPSE_DOT
would be a better "interface" for that functionality.

Does this mean, that debian has "." in the search path for texmf.cnf
files? If yes, where (beginning, end, middle)?

The same would happen for a regular tex / latex / mf run?

[For readers of tex-k: there's a bizarre bug reported at
http://bugs.debian.org/358330 in which fmtutil-sys tries to read the
local user's directory, which it shouldn't.  The bug log contains the
hunt for the source of this problem, and this is a proposed solution.]

I think I may have found the source of the bug: note that there is an
empty element in the expansion of $TEXMFCNF because TETEXDIR is
undefined.

What happens is this.  Normally, an empty component in one of the
kpathsea variables will be filled in with the default value from the
next texmf.cnf encountered.  But in the case of TEXMFCNF, this does
not happen (as the compile time version alone is used).

In kpathsea/expand.c, function kpse_expand_kpse_dot, we have the
following code:

  for (elt = kpse_path_element (path); elt; elt = kpse_path_element (NULL)) {
    string save_ret = ret;
    /* We assume that the !! magic is only used on absolute components.
       Single "." gets special treatment, as does "./" or its equivalent. */
    if (kpse_absolute_p (elt, false) || (elt[0] == '!' && elt[1] == '!')) {
      ret = concat3(ret, elt, ENV_SEP_STRING);
    } else if (elt[0] == '.' && elt[1] == 0) {
      ret = concat3 (ret, kpse_dot, ENV_SEP_STRING);
#ifndef VMS
    } else if (elt[0] == '.' && IS_DIR_SEP(elt[1])) {
      ret = concatn (ret, kpse_dot, elt + 1, ENV_SEP_STRING, NULL);
    } else {
      ret = concatn (ret, kpse_dot, DIR_SEP_STRING, elt, ENV_SEP_STRING, NULL);
#endif
    }
    free (save_ret);
  }


Now with an empty component, kpse_absolute_p (elt, false) is false, so
we enter the else if part; the first two conditions are false, so we
reach the default:
      ret = concatn (ret, kpse_dot, DIR_SEP_STRING, elt, ENV_SEP_STRING, NULL);
which introduces an unwanted kpse_dot.

I think that the correct solution is to replace the final default else
with the conditional test:

    } else if (elt[0] != 0) {
      /* empty components can appear in TEXMFCNF; we skip over these */

Ok for me.

Ha! All this reminds me to
  TEXMF_CNF       = $SELFAUTODIR:$SELFAUTOPARENT:/.$TETEXDIR
which I have had in teTeX-0.2.1:

  te@gauss:/build/tetex-0.2/kpse-2.4/kpathsea> ls -l texmf.cnf.in
  -rw-r--r--  1 te users 3007 1994-10-31 14:11 texmf.cnf.in

Someone did not like this /. and has removed it. Karl? Olaf? :-)

I don't remember doing so, although I may have in a fit of madness.
I can put it back.

I guess TETEXDIR is always specified as an absolute path?  Or am I
missing something else?

Thanks,

Yes, that would be good, thanks.

Or even more C-ish:

Oops.  When actually testing, compiling and then running the code, I
get lots of error messages like:

*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0804d690 ***

This next patch does the job correctly.  An alternative, simpler,
patch follows below, which does not remove the empty path element.

This one is simpler and does not remove the empty path element.

Delete euclide.  Keep pst-eucl, it is the current one.  (I'm told.)
