    No problem. Martin is looking at this for me right now, 

I had a wild speculation which I can't really look into right now:
perhaps the original package has a map file in non-dvips syntax.  I have
the vague impression that updmap assumes the original map file is
dvips.  At least, I don't see anything in updmap for transforming input
to dvips syntax.  (Or pdftex either, which puzzles me.)

AFAIK it is indeed the case that updmap expects dvips syntax. A
conversion to pdftex syntax is not necessary then, since pdftex 
understands dvips syntax.

I can't comment on the patch, but on this piece of Perl code: all 
occurences of

	if ($somevar eq undef)

should definitively be replaced by

	if ( ! defined($somevar) )

The current comparison does NOT test if the variable is undef. It 
tests if it is undef _or_ the empty string, since both operands of 
eq are coerced to strings first. (If one really wants to test on 
undef or the empty string, one should better use $somevar eq "".)

While you're at it, you might want to discard the "&" in front of 
the direct function call. That got unnecessary with Perl 5 more 
than a decade ago.

Best,
	Joachim

I have a simple tex file (test.tex attached).

I have tryed to compile it using TexLive (on win32 platform). But it says:
Error: ! Font T2A/cmr/m/n/10=larm1000 at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric 
(TFM) file not found
(see log file attached).

I've tryed to install on hard disk (full package, and medium). Same result.
I've tryed to work from DVD directly. Same result.
I've tryed to install and remove packages (t2, lh, cyrillic), refresh 
filename database & format files. Same result.
I've checked fontmap, and tryed to "google" this problem. But I found 
notheng usefull.

This file works fine on MikTeX, and teTeX.
What am I doing wrong? Or is it a problem of TexLive?

Thanks.

It's probably some Windows specific problem. I tried your file in
Linux. Pdftext does not find the tfm file but calls metafont to
generate it. Everything happens automatically.

See http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html.

Most likely, you need to enable the MKTEX* variables in texmf.cnf.
These were wrongly disabled by default in TL 2007 (Windows only).

Hope this helps,

I don't understand this change.  What problem is being fixed?

    +  $mode = "URWkb" if ($mode eq undef);

The original is certainly wrong, but the replacement looks strange too,
as Joachim said.  Glancing at the code, I surmise we do want to check
against the empty string, so I changed things accordingly.

I have no way to test it.  If anyone using Windows can do so, that would
be nice.  (Of course it would be nice to unify Windows and Unix, as we
all know very well, but that's not going to happen today.)

If we do want to check against either an empty string or undefined,
it's even simpler to write

$mode = "URWkb" unless $mode;

Notice that parenthese are not necessary.

Message-ID: <200709031730.l83HU9507995@f7.net>

Hello Daniel,

Back on your TeX Live mail from June.

    On SLES 10, the man-directory is not /usr/man but /usr/share/man, 

I changed the defaults, since /usr/share/man and /usr/share/info are
much more common these days as far as I know.

    and when the user accepts the default value without checking, no
    link is created at all during the installation and no error message
    or warning about this is displayed after.

Hmm.  Whenever the symlink target dirs are unwritable, I get an error
message and a prompt; it doesn't let me go on with the install.
I don't think anything about this has changed since the 07 release,
though.  Not sure where to go from here ...

Thanks,
Karl

Hi all!

Running a normal document through latex (plain simple latex) I found:

(/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/xelatex/xetexconfig/geometry.cfg))
...

(that are Debian pathes). I assume that this file is found due to a
missing geometry.cfg in all of TeX Live but the one copy under xelatex,
and the fact the the search path at the end searches for texmf/tex//.

Is there a problem to be expected from this?

Best wishes

No, it's fine. The cfg file is designed to have no effect unless  
running under xetex.

This also checks against the value 0, since 0 is false as well.
(But not against "0E0", even though that evaluates to 0 in numeric 
contexts.) The DWIM feature of Perl is not always what one wants.

Therefore I recommend to use the boolean meaning of Perl variables 
only if they are really boolean, and make the comparison intention 
explicitly clear in all other cases.

Apart from orther comments I advise to use

	if ( not defined($somevar) )

Not has a lower precedence and it is cleaner to use not/or/and in  
your argument logic (use ! && and || for your logicla arithmetic on  
numerical values).

Well, it could be a problem for a user who edits the latex version
(the one in the TL2007 doc tree is all comments).  Hopefully they
will check to make sure the one they want is being loaded, but
depending on where they saved it, xetex may get the wrong version.
It would be best if the same .cfg file could be used for both latex and
xetex configurations.

It really helps. Thank you for support.

And one more question.

I have a document which uses a lot of different russian fonts.
If  TexLive does not found metric file it calls MF to create it (and it
is desired behavour).
BUT: after creating metic file, compliling of TEX file fails with
diffents errors.

At the next start LaTeX found created on prior start metric file, and
continue compliation.
But then it need one more font the situations repeats.

So I have to restart compilation many times, one start for each font.

MikTeX for example, do not stop compiling of source file after building
font files.
So Miktex can build any number of needed fonts at one start, without any
errors.

There are 2 examples in attach.
"Slides.tex" is made using "beamer" style, which use a lot of fonts, and
this is a good example (showing my words).
"test.tex" is very simple file, but also showing this problem - errors
(with font) at first run.

Best regards,
  Mikhail.

What different errors? The expected behaviour (and the one happening
here on my computer) is that all the fonts are created and after this
the tex run continues.

first run created all the fonts and the correct dvi file.

uttering a high-pitched laugh and pointing out of the window (NB. this
doesn't work more that twice); (b) sneezing as loudly as possible and
wiping the glossop off the table in the same movement as whipping out
your handkerchief; (c) saying 'Christ! I seen to have dropped some
shit on your table' (very unwise); (d) saying 'Christ, who did that?'
(better) (e) pressing your elbow on the glossop itself and working
your arms slowly to the edge of the table; (f) leaving the glossop
where it is but moving a plate over it and putting up with sitting at
an uncomfortable angle the rest of the meal; or, if the glossop is in
too exposed a position, (g) leaving it there unremarked except for the
occasional humorous glance.

There were two different files on CTAN, now
  CTAN:macros/latex/required/babel/lahyph.tex           
is a symbolic link to
  CTAN:macros/language/lahyph.tex

latin.ldf however is a mess:

CTAN:macros/latex/required/babel/latin.dtx 2005-11-17
  Version: 2005/11/17 v2.0g
  License: LPPL 1.3

  Version: 2007/03/20 v.2.0f

  No maintainer
  Copyright 1989-2001

Only the copyright holder are the same:
  Johannes L. Braams
  Claudio Beccari
  Krzysztof Konrad \.Zelechowski
  Thomas Martin Widman

Why has the CTAN:language version a date more recent than
CTAN:babel, but an older version number?
Or does the mysterious first dot mean that
  v.2.0f > v2.0g
is true?

Also it looks like a serious LPPL violation. It is one of
the reasons of LPPL to avoid such a mess.

there is one file
  language/hyphenation/lahyph.tex
and macros/latex/required/babel/lahyph.tex  links to it.

there is no macros/language -- what you wrote was obviously a mistake.

the reason that there's a file name lahyph.tex in babel, at all, is
historic.  claudio sent the first version of the file to johannes, ages
ago, and johannes put it into babel rather than suggesting it should go
in the canonical ctan place (at the time, language/hyphenation had
lahyph7 and lahyph8).  he subsequently asked us to tidy it up: the link
is therefore attempting to hide the confusion caused by that change.  we
could probably kill the link, now (it's obviously not mirrored from
johannes' site now).

On W32TeX, TeX compilation does not stop and
all are the same as Norbert, so I cannot understand
the situation Mikhail encountered.
However, some of "mktex*" programs are different between
W32TeX and TeXLive2007 for Windows.
I'm not actually running TeXLive2007, therefore
I want to pass the problem to the other suitable
person (Staszek ?).

Akira

Message-ID: <20070905101549.GC14919@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all, hi Karl,

I have added (rev. 4883) mkjobtexmf from CTAN to the source/utils/
directory. Furthermore I have created a Makefile.in and configure.in
(copies from utils/ps2eps with adaptions), and generated a configure.

With this the Build scripts succeeds and the perl script is installed.

If we DON'T WANT this in texlive (I would like to have it) please revert
the change.

QUESTIONS FOR HELP:
I have not the faintest idea of auto*, so the configure.in and
Makefile.in are probably rubbish. Can someone with more knowledge check
this, they are very short!

One particular problem (is it really a problem?) is that the man page is
installed into inst/share/man/man1 (like the ones from bbox.1 and
ps2eps.1), how should this be changed?

Best wishes

Norbert

In my case it doesn't. 

To be precise, here are steps to reproduce:

1) I have WinXP SP2 russian version (and updates) & Tex-Live DVD image (texlive2007-live-20070212.iso).
2) Using "TexLive Installation and maintenance unility, 2007", i set up environment to run from DVD. It also installs Ghostscript & DVI viewer.
3) After that i edit file "c:\TeXLive2007\texmf-var\web2c\texmf.cnf" according to this recommendations http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html 
   MKTEXPK = 1
   MKTEXMF = 1
   MKTEXTFM = 1
   MKTEXFMT = 1
4) I run command "latex slides.tex" (slides.tex is in slides.tgz - attached), and compilations stops (see <number>_run.log in slides.tgz), i just press "enter".
   In files <number>_run.con - console output (it also shows calls of metafont) 
5) step 4 repeats dozen(!!) times - all log files attached. At every run latex adds one string to the file "missfont.log" 
   And only after that I get my pdf file.

All logs attached. Don't pay attantion at hyperref's warnings in logs - hyperref doesn't like russian letters when producing PDF, it's normal. 

Situation can be reproduced without reinstalling - several files should be deleted (if exists):
 c:\TeXLive2007\texmf-var\fonts\tfm\lh\lh-t2a\la??????.tfm 
 ?:\TeXLive2007\texmf-var\fonts\source\lh\lh-t2a\la??????.mf

Dear all,

I want to inform you that within the next few days the 
	csplain
package as contained in texlive-lang-czechslovak will be removed from
Debian/unstable (and later on from Debian/testing).

The reason is that we waited now more than one (1) year that Petr fixes
only the license text and uploads to CTAN, as announced several times:

This is a sad step, but I don't see any other option.

Of course, if later uploads will make csplain again distributable we
will reinclude it into the Debian TeX Live packages.

Michail is right, of course.  I believe that the omission happened
because TFMs of those two fonts aren't part of the Metapost bundle
(which is correct -- they are identical to the standard TFMs in
TeXLive).

However, these four lines in TeXLive's trfonts.map look suspicious:

  HNB     Helvetica-Narrow-Bold           phvb8an
  HNBI    Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique    phvbo8an
  HNI     Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique        phvro8an
  HNR     Helvetica-Narrow                phvr8an

They should be

  HNB     Helvetica-Narrow-Bold           phvb8gn
  HNBI    Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique    phvbo8gn
  HNI     Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique        phvro8gn
  HNR     Helvetica-Narrow                phvr8gn

instead.

    This macro package (csplain.ini, il2code.tex, csfonts.tex, hyphen.lan,
    plaina4.tex) is free software; you can use it without any restriction.
    You can redistribute it under the following condition: 

    You can do any changes in this software for your own usage. However,
    you cannot distribute the changed software under the same name
    "csplain".  Only the current administrator of CSTeX can do official
    changes to csplain.

This sort of restriction was what required the last LPPL changes, so
it would be my guess that whatever changes were done recently would
not actually be sufficient.  However, it is not clear what "under the
same name" actually means here: is it the file name, or the system
name?  With TeX, we have the system name as the inviolate component,
not the actual executable name.

I suppose that wording is important in US law.  In Germany, if a law is
unclear, referees have to interpret it in a way that it makes sense.
Especially, what counts is the intention of the law, not the wording.
At least if the wording is unclear, doesn't make sense, or is not
applicable. 

I think that it's clear what Petr wants to achieve.  Maybe not
everybody knows, I had been told that Petr wrote a book and, of
course, he wants that things work as described in this book.

Petr, here is your last CangeLog entry:

 > ** 7 ** <Sep. 2007>

 >   mentioned in it. The meaning of Copyright is unchanged.

I assume that you mean that it doesn't make much fun to deal with all
this annoying legal stuff when you say that you don't consider the
license as important.

The license is very important, especially if you don't want people to
distribute modified files under the same name.

I understand you very well if you want to avoid to delve too deeply
into the legal stuff.  A good solution is to use a standard license.
For what you want, LPPL is the best choice.  Definitely.  At least,
all the discussions could then be avoided.

You said:

 > I was forced to do this change by Debian people.

No, this is *definitely* not a Debian problem.  And I'm pretty sure
you are aware of this.  You will have problems with other
distributions, too.

Petr, it seems that that you are very upset at the moment.  You
obviously wrote the ChangeLog entry immediately after you received
Norbert's mail.  Please calm down.

If a further discussion makes sense at all, it should be more
issue-related than emotional.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] endfloat and natbib help if it is possible
Message-ID: <856421.319.qm@web51512.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Dear list members,

My name is Carlo and I am experiencing a few porblems
with endfloat and natbib on the debian texlive
distribution. If this is not the right place to ask
to, I would appreciate if you could point me to a more
suitable direction.

Here the problem: browsing around people keep on
pointing  to endfloat for having the floats at the end
of the article class documents. So I gave it a go. I
need its functionalities. I have a LaTeX article that
I am trying to write and that uses natbib. Without
\usepackage{endfloat} I can 'compile' it smoothly, but
when I insert the package endfloat I get :

Package natbib Warning: Citation `Mapvue_Manual_2002'
on page 2 undefined on in
put line 50.

(qq.ttt) [2])
Runaway argument?
! File ended while scanning use of \next.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
<*> \nonstopmode\input{qq.tex}
                              
! Emergency stop.
<*> \nonstopmode\input{qq.tex}

I have tried several times all the day long without
success.

It look like that the .bib file cannot be read anymore
and the references are lost. The don't appear in the
.bbl.

Could someone suggest me some way for having all the
floating at the end of the article each of them on a
separate page or could somebody help me in fixing the
problem.

I have not subscribed the mailing list. So, please
address your answer to this email address. Also, be
patient with me, I am not a
LaTeX-fully-fledged-person, i.e. I don't know much.
TeX? I don't have a clue.

Best regards,

Carlo

Message-ID: <f31cece10709090306y5f6d2512pd2ca6ca0025451c5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

In "The TEX Live Guide" of my TeX Live 2007 DVD
(/mnt/dvd/texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/live.{html,pdf})
I've found some paragraphs that should be corrected (IMHO):

(I am not sure if exists a CVS/SVN/beta/inestable repository
in which all nexts changes have already commited, so excuse me
if it is the case.)


TYPO1: In section "3.1 Running TeX Live directly from media (Unix)"
we can read:
        It is possible to use the TeX system directly from
        the live DVD, without installing the distribution
        to disk. [...] It is _not_ possible to run TeX directly
        from the other CDs [...] To start, you mount the CD or
        DVD, with Rock Ridge extensions enabled.

But we know TeX Live can only be run in "live mode" with DVD media,
so the third sentence of above paragraph contradicts the other two.

This seems a typo originated by "copy&paste" from another
sections of the document, where is explained the
installation to disk, that can be done from either CD or DVD.

So the correct sentence (in section 3.1) must be:
        [...] To start, you mount the live DVD, with Rock Ridge
        extensions enabled.



TYPO2: In both sections "3.1 Running TeX Live directly from media (Unix)"
and  "3.2 Installing TeX Live to disk"
we can read:
        Change the current directory to the mount point:
        > cd /mnt/cdrom
        Under Mac OSX, the directory is typically under /Volumes,
        and the media will be mounted automatically. Run the
        installation script install-tl.sh:
        > sh install-tl.sh

With this text layout, it looks as if installation script
is only for MacOSX!!. I would advise something like:

        Under Mac OSX, the directory is typically under /Volumes,
        and the media will be mounted automatically.

        Run the installation script install-tl.sh:
        > sh install-tl.sh

that is, Mac OSX in a separate paragraph.
In fact, section "3.3 Installing individual packages to disk"
follows this layout aka 'Mac-OSX-exception-in-a-separated-paragraph'.


TYPO3: In section "5. Mac OSX installation", we can read:
        The recommended way to install TeX on Max OSX is from
        the MacTeX distribution, new in 2005. This is provided on the
        live DVD in the top-level mactex/ directory.

But, where is mactex/ directory in TeXLive2007 live DVD??





TYPO4: In section "6.1 Installing TeX Live to disk"
we can read:
        After inserting the TeX Live CD into the CD drive,
        autostart should activate tlpmgui.

But it doesn't mention live DVD. A better sentence could be:
        After inserting TeX Live media (DVD or CD) into the drive,
        autostart should activate tlpmgui.


TYPO5: a few lines below, it mentions "the TeX Collection DVD". What/where is th
e "TeX Collection DVD"?

xlxtra has been improved and titlesec 2.7 has been deprecated, since it

Message-ID: <200709091838.l89IcKj10634@f7.net>

Regarding filenames containing spaces and the TEXEDIT et al. values:

1) is there any reason not to change the compile-time default in
   web2c/c-auto.in?  If you want to add the definitions in the Debian
   texmf.cnf, that's fine, of course, but I don't see why the default

2) wouldn't '' be better than ""?  What if the filename contains (say) a $?

Thanks,

Hi

The file "variations.tex" is missplaced :
It is in /texlive/texmf-dist/doc/latex/variations/variations.tex

It should not be in the doc tree, but for example in :
/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/variations/variations.sty
or
/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/variations/variations.sty

Thank you for the TeXlive !

Thanks for the report.  It's fixed for the next release.

Hi,

Is the lnaguage.dat on the cdrom also suitible for "installed" (as in
on hard disk) systems. There was some doubt in a discussion I had last
week. After inspection it looks ok to me, but I thought I should
check.

Thanks

Hi there,

I have recieved a patch from an OpenBSD developer which does the following:

---8<---

---8<---

Is this directory required for tl to run? I am not sure.

It should not be done except at explicit user request.

No, it is not required for TL to run.  But it is, well, the sources.
They must be included in the distribution, for legal reasons among others.

    where is the "TeX Collection DVD"?

See http://tug.org/texcollection.  

    But, where is mactex/ directory in TeXLive2007 live DVD??

mactex is part of the TeX Collection, as opposed to TeX Live.
Hence it is not in the "live" image of TL.

Hi

We install TexLive on a Samba mounted drive on a Linux machine and then use it under Windows.
We always have a very hard time to get it working. Maybe because of bugs
and definitely because of poor documentation. I got it working with some hand tweaking
though.

I would be happy to work with you on improving the documentation and also test using texlive
on in our setup i.e. on Samba mounted drive if it has any interest for you.

I know we use an advanced setup but I think others much use the same setup.
Also it seems that things should just be done once.

Erling

PS. Below is the part from the manual I think is weak.


7.6 Network installation

Kpathsea knows about UNC names, so you can use them to get your TEXMF tree from the network. But there is better than this. All the support files and configuration files, everything except the files in the bin/win32 are shareable with a teTEX or Unix TEX Live installation. That means you can use Samba either to mount from an NT server to a Unix workstation or the converse. Several strategies are possible: 
    * Put everything on the server. Just add each set of files for the OS and architecture you want to use in the bin directory. That means for example bin/win32 and bin/i386-linux. Next configure your main variables. You can use UNC names to point to the right directories under Win32. 
    * Install a local copy for the binaries and format files. In this case, assign $TEXMFMAIN to the main texmf tree that will be accessed remotely. Set $TEXMFVAR to be a local directory which will hold local configuration files and on-the-fly generated files.

Sorry, Karl, I'm afraid I haven't been clear in my request: CTAN has
newer versions than the ones contained TL SVN.

So TL SVN should be updated.

Unless the OS ending with `$' - err, `s' likes "" better, I prefer ''.

I guess I wasn't clear in my reply :).  As far as I can tell, the files
in TL SVN are *exactly the same* as what's on CTAN.

Can you please tell me what files, specifically, you are seeing as
different?  That is, the exact path on CTAN and the exact path in TL?

    I would be happy to work with you on improving the documentation and

Improving the documentation would be most welcome.  What would work best
is if you could make a first draft with the improvements, and we can
work together from that.

    also test using texlive on in our setup i.e. on Samba mounted drive
    if it has any interest for you.

Testing is also very very welcome, but there won't be another release
this year.  If you're not on this mailing list, I can just let you know
when we start pushing towards the next release ...

The situation is similar to the map files.  The live language.dat
includes all the language support we have.  Unless you unconditionally
install all languages in all cases, you should regenerate the
language.dat at install time according to the packages actually chosen.
The information to do this is in the tlp's (now) / tpm's (then).

You have to find the name of the tfm file and the fd file, it will
give you the relevant information. Macros \DeclareFontFamily and
\DeclareFontShape define the mappings between parameters of LaTeX
macros and the tfm files, mapping between tfm files and the real fonts
are in the map files. Anyway, AFAIK tahoma is not a free font, it is
not a part of TeXLive, so you probably have to make the tfm, fd and
map files yourself. If you wish to use directly the font installed in
your OS, you must use Xe(La)TeX. After \usepackage{fontspec} you can
specify directly \fontspec{tahoma} and you have LaTeX font commands
available as well as a lot of OpenType features. See "texdoc fontspec"
for details.

thank you, but i don't plan to switched to another tex distribution
now.  i heard, there is a method ( or program ) which let users create
type1 fonts from windows truetypes including Tahoma.  i just forgot
the program's name and the details of the method.

ttf2tfm and pdf(la)tex can use truetype fonts. I do not know the
instructions how to prepare the map files but it can be found

The program is Fontforge, but you are certainly not allowed to convert
the fonts.

Unless you have a full installation, add support for Vietnamese and
try this:
_________________________________
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[T5]{fontenc}
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{jth}

\begin{document}
\textsf{test}

Sorry for a late response. I can confirm that this problem occurs only
when .mf file is missing, that is TeX compilation stops after generating
e.g. larm1000.mf, etc. (such files are generated on-the-fly). larm1000.tfm
is also generated, but for some unknown reason cannot be found by (la)tex.
Any subsequent tex compilation is then successfull.
Well, please note, that while preparing TL2007 distribution, we didn't have 
mktex* programs from W32TeX, so we borrowed them from earlier TL.

I tried to use mktexmf, mktextfm and mktexpk from the current W32TeX 
(mftools.tar.gz as on 26 Jul 2007) in TL2007 and they worked somehow. 
The generated .mf and .tfm files are stored in texmf-dist/fonts/ 
(instead of texmf-var/fonts/ ) but ls-R databases aren't updated. 
Any subsequent tex run tries to regenerate it, but as .tfm
files have been found anyway, we can only see some warning messages:

Running mktextfm larm1000
kpathsea: Running mktexmf larm1000.mf
name = larm1000, rootname = larm, pointsize = 1000
mktexmf: c:/TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/fonts/source/lh/lh-t2a/larm1000.mf 
already exists.
c:/TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/lh/lh-t2a/larm1000.tfm exists
...

I can only hope that the next release of TL will contain complete and
consistent set of win32 binaries. Akira, what do you think?

Thanks and all the best,

That version was not compatible with TeXLive.
I hope the version after 10 Sept. may be usable.

Earlier, Akira suggested to change MPEDIT and MFEDIT, too.  What about that?

Actually, it would make more sense to change all those to the
equivalent of

${VISUAL:-${EDITOR:-emacs-or-via-according-to-religion}}  +%d \"%s\"

namely: if there is a VISUAL or EDITOR variable set already, it does
not make sense not to make use of it.

Default values of TEXEDIT, MPEDIT and MFEDIT are all EDITOR in
c-auto.h.
If you redefine TEXEDIT in texmf.cnf, you had better define also
MFEDIT and MPEDIT.

Even if there is a good reason to over-ride VISUAL and EDITOR at all,
it doesn't make much sense to have three variables, TEXEDIT, MPEDIT,
and MFEDIT.  It's quite unlikely that someone uses Emacs to edit
metafont files, vi to edit metapost files, and Microsoft's flagship
Wordpad to edit tex files.

Doesn't it make more sense if tex, metapost, and metafont look out for
TEXEDIT only?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Good point, thanks David.

    Doesn't it make more sense if tex, metapost, and metafont look out for
    TEXEDIT only?

They could fall back to TEXEDIT, but as always I am leery of simply
removing long-existing functionality.  Although admittedly this is
pretty obscure.  Patches welcome :).

I don't want mpost to fallback to a variable called TEXEDIT. If mpost
is run in combination with troff labels, that would be really weird.
(simply EDITOR would be fine by me)

It may be worth pointing out that Debian has packages for TeXLive,  
and has conducted an audit of the licenses:
http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/t/texlive-base/ 
texlive-base_2005.dfsg.3-1/texlive-base.copyright
This may form a basis to start from. I didn't post this reply to the  
fc bugzilla, I think a single coordinated response is best, probably  
Karl, as his name is on the file I linked to above.

As a matter of personal opinion, I'd rather have no TeX with FC than  
teTeX.

Given that some issues were already found, I guess that we cannot 
do anything else that check everything -- be it more or less
automatically for the texmf part.

I reported all the issues I found in the binary/script part of texlive 
to Karl. They are listed in, 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=242416#c20
below
  Projects from texlive/CTAN, but with license problem
  ----------------------------------------------------


The bibtex8 and makeindexk issues turned out to be moot. Others
should have been solved by now (mostly by removing the problematic
files). For missing license I contacted the authors.

Yes, it may - but it is far from complete.

However, if you point to our efforts, you should also mention that we
tried to push as much information to upstream as possible:  Our
copyright file, in the part that lists licenses of individual CTAN
packages, is automatically generated from the information in the TeX
Catalogue, and Norbert and I got write access to the catalogue to keep
the information there up-to-date.

I'd really appreciate if other teams who do license auditing like this
would also try to share their results in a similar way.  In the
changelogs of the Debian packages, before I got involved, there are two
earlier "large big damn big comprehensive license audits", but we had to
start from scratch since there was no information available except "all
non-free parts which used to be in there and where found are now purged".

Patrice, on this page you mention that you want to include dvipdfm 
into RH and let off dvipdfmx, because it was not in teTeX.

Please note that this is probably not a very good decision. dvipdfm 
has not been maintained in ages, the small patch by ESR was 
irrelevant, and dvipdfmx is needed to use CID fonts. For (almost) 
all purposes, dvipdfm is superseeded by dvipdfm. Almost, because 
one should add the dvipdfm documentation to a dvipdfmx package, if 
one discards dvipdfm.

Please don't take this as a criticism, more as a hint.

Cheers,
	Joachim

As the pdftex maintainer, I also think it natural to push any patches
to pdftex upstream (e.g.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=242416#c24).

I was indeed sort-of assuming that a Perl installer would take care
of this functionality.

I think I mentioned that I have a Mingw-compiled Perl including
perl/tk and a registry access module. If anybody is interested, I
can make a tar or zip available for download, together with some
sample code for accessing the registry.

The point here is not to include or not to include dvipdfm/dvipdfmx,
but to include them in texlive or outside of texlive. Since there
is a separate upstream both shouldn't be part of texlive. It is not
about the software quality or anything, it is about packaging quality.

As an exception I accepted to have packages that were in tetex in
texlive, even if they have a separate upstream, but I personnally 
don't like it that much. In the end I proposed to have dvipdfmx in 
texlive too, since xetex depends on it. But once again both should be
outside of texlive, as separate packages.

Discarding dvipdfm may be relevant, but I'll let that decision to the
maintainer.

see this message which describes probably the same bug:

to fix it, check your TEXMFHOME variable (perhaps in texmf.cnf).

Sounds quite promising, please proceed.  Maybe it's best to put it

Hi there,

Now that I have some spare time, I have been looking into font in more
depth. A topic which has always confused me in TeX.

A while back I blindly copied this into my assignment template:

\DeclareFixedFont{\myfont}{OT1}{ppl}{b}{it}{0.6cm}

Whilst I understand what all of these options mean, I would not know
how to select this font had I not found it on the net someplace.

How do you know which fonts exist in which encodings?
How do you know which fonts have which shapes availible?

I tried looking at .mf and .tfm files, realising that these files
don't seem to encode this informtaion.

If I can work this out I was planning on writing a program that is
capable of scanning your texmf creating a font preview document,
allowing you to easily select a font you like to look of. Unless
ofcourse this program already exists.

Thanks

    How do you know which fonts exist in which encodings?

You don't.

You don't.

    I tried looking at .mf and .tfm files, realising that these files
    don't seem to encode this informtaion.

They don't, at least not in any reliable way.
(Few fonts are .mf, anyway.)

There are various heuristics to guess with, but that's about it.
For instance, <something>8y.tfm would be the texnansi encoding.
Ditto texnansi-<something>.tfm.

However, if you restrict your attention to outline fonts (not
unreasonable these days IMHO), it would be a lot easier and faster to
just parse psfonts.map; in many cases, that will have an explicit
reencoding, so you know the encoding.  And you can guess the shape from
the FontName, e.g., the fact that Cherokee-Bold is bold is pretty parsable.

Still, no general scheme will always work; there are too many font names
that follow no useful pattern.  What I can imagine is a script that
simply special cases names, so that you can pass it, say, cmr10, and it
can return stuff like

family=ComputerModern
encoding=TeX text
weight=regular
...

That's my best suggestion.  Maybe others have better ones.  

    If I can work this out I was planning on writing a program that is
    capable of scanning your texmf creating a font preview document,
    allowing you to easily select a font you like to look of. Unless
    ofcourse this program already exists.

I know of no such program, although people ask for it not infrequently.
If you can manage to get something working, that would be great.

Conceivably some of the files at http://tug.org/fontname would be of use
in deconstructing names, though I can't say for sure.

Best,
Karl

    [Described below are several files/directories in the doc tree

Because there is no font cmastro10.300pk.mk. You have to call
	mktexpk cmastro10
or 
	mktexpk --dpi 300 --bdpi 300 cmastro10

Dear all!

What about the following problem: We have a incompatible magyar.ldf in
babel, babel maintainers are not responding and not including this
updated version, but we ship it under doc/...

Is there any chance that we can:
- include this updated/fixed magyar.ldf into texlive
- get it into proper babel

Thanks a lot

TeXlive creation actually has almost nothing to do with TeX
programming (apart from some format creation files or similar): it
consists of collecting and arranging CTAN material (and possibly some
other sources) and helping with compiling binaries.

So if you create stuff that is useful enough to put on CTAN, chances
are that you'll contribute to TeXlive just doing that.

Testing TeXlive mostly is a matter of checking it out via Subversion
and building and testing it once in a while.  It certainly can use
more people who do that from time to time.

Hi Susan,

    next will track down how to get the CD.

http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.
(You can download it, or get it from a user group, or ...)

    I don't know how much I could contribute to creating the next edition of

Aside from testing (see below), uploading any generally useful classes
you've written to CTAN would be great.  

Also, reviewing (and trying) the TL documentation
(http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html) would be very useful.  Documentation
always needs improvement.

    I'll gladly help to test it

Testing is most certainly always welcome.  I've put you on my list of
victims, er, testers for the next version.  Meanwhile, if you wish, you
could get the current sources via svn or rsync (see
http://tug.org/texlive/svn) and try working with that.  The present
binaries are 99% unchanged from TL07, but I've done hundreds of package
updates.

(All of this and more is recapped on the
http://tug.org/texlive/contribute.html page Norbert mentioned, just
wanted to expand on it a bit.)

Thanks for writing,
Karl

If you use debian (or ubuntu) linux you can get TL in packaged form.

I maintain a LaTeX style (implementing a proprietary design, so it
can't go on CTAN) used for a report series.  Since report authors are
scattered around the world it is important to me to check the style
with the TeX systems that authors actually use, including TL.

You raise an issue ("TSU has nothing that will process TeX files")
that is becoming a problem.   In my field, oceanography, many recent
PhD's have never encountered TeX, and know only the Windows OS family.
 Getting TeX into
Windows as a native application is an uphill battle, particularly in places that
rely on a checklist approach, e.g.:

    [  ] Vendor provides regular security updates.
    [  ] Uses departmental standard document formats (e.g., .doc, .xls)

There is also an attitude in N. America that public resources (e.g.,
the time and
energy of goverment and university scientists as well as government or
university computing sytems) should not be used to support open source
"in unfair competition with commercial products".

It is one thing for an individual to arrange to have TeX available on a personal
system, far different to (re-?) establish TeX as one of the tools that scientist
expect to be available as a matter of course.

Past experience has been that pre-release testing of TL on platforms
other than intel linux has been haphazard.   Windows installation in
particular is a problem because site policies vary widely (where I
work, users "HOME" directories are
on network drives, with the expectation that users can log onto any PC
and see the same environment).  In the past I used TL to provide a
consistent
environment across unix/linux/Windows, and I did (minimal) testing on
Windows and more testing on unix/linux.   I used the linux installer
to create a tree with binaries for all platforms on an NFS share, and
copied the relevant portions to
Windows, so never tested the Windows installer.  Now, due to the missing
tick in the above checkbox, TL has been replaced by MikTeX on Win32,
with a texmf tree maintained by MPM for unix/linux to ensure
consistency.

In short, testing is needed and will be appreciated, but you should
consider investing some time ensring that TeX is more widely available
at your institution.
Are there other students and faculity who want to use TeX (e.g.,
journal or conference proceeding that requires (La)TeX?

Now that many publishers have offloaded the tasks of preparing
illustrations and typesetting onto authors, there is a need for
universities to include these topics.
In my experience, preparing publications has become a major stressor both for
young scientists preparing their first publication and for older
scientists with long lists of publications who now find they must
provide text and figures in electronic form.

This is a very, very hard problem to solve in normal tex with macros,
so re-defining \begin{document} and using an external preprocessor like
you proposed may be the only option. And because of the hackishness
of that, I have never attempted to do something along these lines in
the past.

In Omega (Aleph) it should in principle be possible to do this using
input translations but I have no idea how to go about that in practice.
In luatex this could be done by adjusting the line buffer via a lua
callback relatively easily, but luatex is far from production-ready
at the moment.

Right now, the perl road may the most feasible way to do what you want.

I assume perltex could use a pipe to read from the perl command, using
something like \immediate\openin\perlread="|perl \jobname.pl". That
would make the feedback process quite a bit simpler (and faster). But
that would require quite a few changes to perltex, and the best person
to talk about that is the perltex author.

Best wishes,
Taco

    [...] in texconfig (around line 1151 in my local
    copy) the command "init" runs fmtutil and updmap unconditionally.

    I suggest that [texconfig-sys] should also set and export a variable, say
    "syswide_mode=1", and texconfig can then check for this.

I just checked in this change to texconfig and texconfig-sy.  Thanks.
