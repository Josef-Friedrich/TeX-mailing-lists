Karl,

Here are some more inconstencies I noticed in the current dev tree:

- texmf-dist/source/latex/fnbreak/latex/fnbreak/

- texmf-dist/source/latex/kerntest/latex/kerntest/

- There are duplicate pdf files under 
texmf/doc/{bg5conv,cef5conv,cefconv,cefsconv,extconv,hbf2gf,sjisconv}/man/

Also, some "execute addMap" or "execute addMixedMap" declarations are 
missing in some package descriptions under trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/ :
- ams: mathpple.map
- fourier: fourier-utopia-expert.map
- groff: troff.map
- ly1: pcr8y, phc8y and ptm8y.map
- tengwar: tengwarscript.map
- antiqua: uaq.map
   
Yours,
Fran?ois

Those are different files: One set is the output of c2cweb, the others
are PDF version of the man page.

    - tengwar: tengwarscript.map

According to http://at.mansbjorkman.net/downloads.htm, it seems the
actual tengwar fonts are nonfree (may not be modified or sold).  Unless
someone knows something to the contrary, I'll just remove this package.
(Reinhard, if you're bored, you could add tengwar to getnonfreefonts.)

    - ly1: pcr8y, phc8y and ptm8y.map
Included from tetex/dvips35.map (and related).

    - ams: mathpple.map
Included in ams.tlpsrc now, although I see the eurbo10 and eurmo10
entries which it defines didn't make it to psfonts.map.  Maybe just
needs regeneration.

Werner already answered about the *conv pdf's.

I made the other fixes.  Thanks much.

Best,
Karl

Hi all,

I recieved an email from a student who is using the OpenBSD port for
his dissertation, but is having problems with a specific font. I am
not sure if this is a bug or something else. I was hoping someone here
could suggest something.

Please reply-all, so that he recieves the email too.

Thanks

Sorry, I should have provided more context.  Metafont files for the sans
serif blackboard bold font (a.k.a. bbold) are included in both tetex and
texlive in a limited range of sizes: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 17.

My PhD dissertation happens to use sizes 11 and 14.  With tetex it used
to work fine, but when I switched to texlive I started getting pages of
incomprehensible errors whenever using the bbfont in any size other than
those listed above.
The problem I experienced can easily be reproduced by running this
command:

        mktextfm bbold15

I have noticed that running, e.g., "mktexmf bbold15" produces a file
/var/tmp/texfonts/source/public/bbold/bbold15.mf which looks entirely
different from the ones that are part of texlive and distributed in
/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/bbold/.

I am not sure what the right fix is (what I suggested in my first
message probably isn't it) or what to suggest.  It seems that the
"sauter" package used to take care of bbold fonts (and others) at
different sizes, and this package might be partially broken in texlive
(I have checked that it is indeed included in texlive/texmf-full).

> Sorry, Im relatively new to the texlive build.

I sympathize, TeX is a strange beast and it gets ugly when it breaks --
which is frequent.  I'll keep looking into this and see if texlive on
other platforms is also affected, and I'll let you know.

This is not a bug, fonts are seldom available at 11pt and 14.4pt.
these sizes are produced by scaling from 10pt (mag 1095 and 1440,
respectively), or if 12pt font is available, 14.4pt size is produced
by scaling wi mag 1200. The LaTeX .fd files are set to do this
automatically when selecting the sizes by standard commands as \large,
\Large etc.

Sebatien,

So the font not scale automatically then?
Can we see the output of the latex build please?

Check the tex-live archives for previous (long) discussions about bbold.
This is one thing I would be very glad if someone else could research
and figure out the right thing to do.

    TeX is a strange beast and it gets ugly when it breaks -- which is
    frequent.

How discouraging.

It seems that I found the source of the problem. The bbold* fonts are
declared in three files, namely Ubbold.fd, ubbold.fd, and subbold.fd.
The first of them defines the sizes based on existing *.mf files while
the next two rely upon Sauter interpolation. Moreover, the comments in
subbold.fd say that it probably does not work. In LaTeX terminology,
the fonts have \fontencoding{U}. Originally in NFSS2 the file name was
composed from the encoding and family, ie. Ubbold in this case. Due to
problems on some case insensitive file systems now the encoding name
is lowercased, ie. ubbold.fd is expected. I would prefer removing both
ubbold.fd and subbold.fd and renaming Ubbold.fd to ubbold.fd.

Fortunatelly kpsewhich combined with find is like Babbage's analytical
engine. It has no pretentions to originate anything but it can do
whatever you know how to order it. (modified citation of Ada Adelaida,

Thanks for looking into bbold.

    problems on some case insensitive file systems now the encoding name

Ah, that explains a lot.  Clearly the conflict between Ubbold and ubbold
has to be resolved.

    prefer ... renaming Ubbold.fd to ubbold.fd.

Hmm.  Since the Sauter support is there, why not use it?
Judging from the couple of bug reports we get every year about this,
people use/expect it.

Unfortunatelly Sauter support for bbold fonts is broken. After
removing ubbold.fd and running mktexlsr LaTeX finds Ubbold.fd and
bbold fonts work.

Is that all that is done? If so I will apply a patch to the OpenBSD port.

Sebastien, can you try this method manually for your dis, and if all

Not that I can see.  It does different things depending on the options

Message-ID: <20070811161410.GA21253@trusty.localdomain>

Hello,

I thoroughly removed all bits of previous installations and reinstalled
unmodified tex-live ports.  I have confirmed that the following commmands
fix generation of bbold fonts at various point sizes on my system:

rm /usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/jknapltx/ubbold.fd
rm /usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/sauterfonts/subbold.fd
mv /usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/bbold/Ubbold.fd \
   /usr/local/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/bbold/ubbold.fd

I had to regenerate the file catalogues (texconfig-sys, Rehash) before
things worked, but if you modify the ports themselves (which seems to
be the right thing to do) it will of course happen automatically.

The files ubbold.fd and Ubbold.fd are in texlive/texmf-minimal:

texlive_texmf-minimal-2007/texmf-dist/tex/latex/jknapltx/ubbold.fd
texlive_texmf-minimal-2007/texmf-dist/tex/latex/bbold/Ubbold.fd

The file subbold.fd is in texlive_texmf-full:

texlive_texmf-full-2007/texmf-dist/tex/latex/sauterfonts/subbold.fd

Here is a sample LaTeX test case:

---8<---
\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{bbold}
\begin{document}
\fontencoding{U}\fontfamily{bbold}
\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont 10pt
\fontsize{11}{14}\selectfont 11pt
\fontsize{12}{15}\selectfont 12pt
\fontsize{14.4}{17}\selectfont 14.4pt
\fontsize{17.28}{20}\selectfont 17.28pt
\end{document}
---8<---

I am entirely happy with the results, so please do ammend the port.

Thanks!

Hi!

I realized that the documentation for bigfoot is missing.

The same is true for perpage and suffix.

You can generate them from the dtx in texmf/source/latex/bigfoot.

Hi all,

A user of tl2007 (via the port) on obsd has reported that metapost is
broken for him.

He informs me that this is the fix:

Is this a known bug, an undiscovered bug or something which I have
introduced via the port?

Thanks

These days, TL usually just copies what is on CTAN rather than
generating anything, since it is good to have the docs on CTAN anyway.

CTAN folks, do you want to make these?

Message-ID: <BAY143-W37AF3ABD725474E6556B48F6DC0@phx.gbl>


I use bibliographic database and \thebibliography environment to create the reference section of my papers. In each bibliographic entry in the database, I usually add a url field. When I use bibtex, the content of the url field is not shown in the paper. This is fine. However, when I use natbib, the content of the url field is shown in the paper. This is not desirable but I have to use natbib for its author-year style. So my question is: how to configure natbib so that the the content of the url field is not shown in the paper?

I propose to change the head of the TeXLive repository as
follows:

(1) Erase  texmf-dist/tex/platex
(2) Rename texmf-dist/tex/latex/platex to
           texmf-dist/tex/latex/polski

Make a copy of abbrvnat.bst under a different name, eg.
abbrvnat-without-url.bst, and put it to the place where bibtex expects
bst files, preferably in the same directory hierarchy in texmf-local,
and rebuild the filename database. Then edit your copy of the bst
file, locate FUNCTION {format.url}. Below you will see a conditional
command with two expansions, the first line outputs the empty string,
the following outputs URL. Remove the second line and replace it with
the copy of the preceding line, ie. the function then should look as:

FUNCTION {format.url}
{ url empty$
    { "" }
    { "" }
   if$
}

I hope this works.

This is not a user support list, but the development list of TeX Live.
You will have better chances to get a response by posting in to

- in trunk we have 'integer' in XeTeX_ext.c and .h
- in branch2007 we have 'integer' in XeTeX_ext.c and 'long' in XeTeX_ext.h

Am I right that it should be 'integer' everywhere???

Yes, you're right. Sorry, I thought I'd corrected those, but  
evidently missed the ones in branch2007.

Just committed the fix to branch2007 (r4728).

I've run the documentation (turns out it requires ncctools), updated the
catalogue, and reindexed the page.  The package information dB will get
updated on the nightly rebuild.

Message-ID: <68c491a60708140209k62e2a412ub41b6a79a0b0f3a6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
the pdftex project just got a bug report that our build script can't
handle pathnames with spaces
(http://sarovar.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=493&aid=856&group_id=106)

Since our build script is just a wrapper around "configure;make", this
most likely applies to texlive also and should better be fixed there.
Also here we can find more shell-foo. :-)

My understanding is that configure crashes because variables like
$ac_config_sub can contain spaces but are not properly quoted when
used.

Best
   Martin

Hi Andreas

To be precise that is not all you have to do.
With the installation on your ubuntu box you get the win32 binaries in
place, say on some share which is finally mapped to a drive letter h:.

An installation on a windows box does some more configuration which you
now have to do manually:

- Add h:\tex\2007\bin\win32 to your path;

-Set the following environment variables:

TLroot=h:\tex\2007
TEXMFCNF=h:\tex\2007\texmf-var\web2c
TEXMFTEMP=some writeable dir

You may replace ..\tex\2007 with some more suiteable for you.
You may check now:

kpsewhich sample2e.tex
kpsewhich latex.fmt
latex sample2e
...

to see whether your configuration is ok.
There is no need to write any value to the registry.

You may have to install ghostscript/gsview by hand on the windows box as
well.

Do not ask me for special problems with vista. The things I mentioned
here we do with XP boxes here and live with TeX is ok.

Wolfgang

I planned to do it the other way round: Installing it on my Vista-PC,
using a mapped share (i.e. U:\ = /usr/share/) as Install-Path. I thoght,
this way it must run on Vista after installation and I had to do some
after-installion on the Ubuntu-PC.

no lack on these *g*

How do you consider to use debian package-manager instead of installing
TeXLive2007 on Ubuntu?

Thanks!

Subject: [tex-live] Pscryrliic Fonts for TeXLive
Message-ID: <a6e8c1d0708140729v7ed2c9e5icd685b4175c72245@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am testing the pscyr package for OpenBSD against TeXLive and have
encountered a problem.

The port installs the files in this list:
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/russian/pscyr/pkg/PLIST?rev=1.4&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup

However I have patched the Makefile to install into "texmf" instead of
"texmf-local". I assume this should not introduce problems.

The port will then execute:
mktexlsr
updmap-sys --quiet --nomkmap --enable Map=pscyr.map
updmap-sys --quiet --enable Map=pscyr2.map

I verify that the new files are indexed:
root at skutter:texmf> kpsewhich pscyr.sty
/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/pscyr/pscyr.sty

And in theory I should be able to test the font using this laTeX file:
\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{pscyr}
\begin{document}
this is a test
\end{document}

This should work, as pscyr.sty does this:
\def\rmdefault{faq}
\def\sfdefault{ftx}
\def\ttdefault{fer}

Here is the output of the command `pdflatex test`:

It appears to know that the font needs to be built, but is incorrectly

I am stuck at this point. Does anyone have an insight as to why this
may not be working?

I did a license audit on the texlive-texmf package this morning (derived
from texlive.texmf-2007.tar.bz2, texlive.texmf-var-2007.zip), in the
attempt to properly tag the package licenses (Distributable is _NOT_ a
valid license in Fedora).

I've CC'd several folks, including an upstream contact (hopefully, a
valid email).

Here's what I found:

The majority of the files are under one of the following licenses:
LaTex Project Public License (LPPL)
GNU Public License v2 (GPLv2)
GNU Public License v2 or later (GPLv2+)
Public Domain

(a lot of files are under the "GUST Font License", which is just the
LPPL.)

There are some files under different licenses:

Acceptable for Fedora
=====================
texmf-dist/doc/metapost/base/source/mpman.tex (MIT)
texmf-dist/tex/latex/vntex/varioref-vi.sty (LGPLv2+)
texmf-dist/doc/generic/vntex/source/vn-fonts.tex (Utopia)
texmf-dist/doc/generic/enctex/unimap.diff (UCD)
texmf-dist/doc/latex/fancyvrb/* (Artistic 2.0)

Not Acceptable for Fedora
=========================
I found several items which were licensed with non-free licenses. This
seems to conflict with the TexLive policies
(http://www.tug.org/texlive/copying.html), so I can only assume they're
included accidentally.

Literat License:

There are several files under a "literat" license, this license does not
permit any modification of the fonts, so it is non-free and accordingly,
not acceptable for Fedora. The files under this license are:

texmf-dist/doc/fonts/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/paragrap/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/vf/paragrap/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/paragrap/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/paragrap/literat/
texmf-dist/tex/latex/literat/
texmf-doc/doc/german/latex-tipps-und-tricks/literat.sty (not under the
license, but probably irrelevant without the literat bits)

Aladdin Free Public License:

The Aladdin Free Public License is non-free, thus, not acceptable for
Fedora. The following files are under the AFPL:

texmf-dist/fonts/afm/public/qfonts/qhvcb.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/public/qfonts/qhvcri.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/public/qfonts/qhvcbi.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/public/qfonts/qhvcr.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/bookman/ubkri8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/bookman/ubkr8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/bookman/ubkb8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/bookman/ubkbi8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/helvetic/uhvri8an.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/helvetic/uhvri8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/helvetic/uhvbi8a.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/helvetic/uhvr8an.afm
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/helvetic/uhvb8an.afm

LPPL with commercial use restriction:

There is one file which has an additional restriction to the LPPL,
forbidding commercial use without explicit permission from the author.
This almost certainly renders the file non-free, and it is not ok for
Fedora.

texmf-dist/tex/latex/tools/multicol.sty

Artistic (original):

The original Artistic license is non-free, and thus, not ok for Fedora.
These files are under the Artistic license:

texmf-dist/tex/latex/fancybox/fancybox.sty
texmf-dist/tex/latex/amscls/pcatcode.sty

If they could be relicensed (either dual licensed with something
acceptable, or to something like Artistic 2.0), they'd be fine.

=== Fedora specific notes ===

If all of those files under bad licenses are removed, then the
appropriate Fedora licensing tag would be:

License: Artistic 2.0 and GPLv2 and GPLv2+ and LGPLv2+ and LPPL and MIT
and Public Domain and UCD and Utopia

As is, this package is not ok for Fedora. I've put an FE-Legal block on
the review ticket, please let me know when you have a cleaned SRPM (you
don't need a sanitized tarball, just don't package the "bad" items in
the buildroot, and nuke them during %setup if possible)

My brain hurts now. I'm going to curl up into a ball and rock gently for
a while.

These are easy to solve since the URW fonts have also been released

IMO the 'commercial restriction' is not part of the license but is a
moral obligation people are *asked* to follow.

This list is not only the right place to ask such questions, we are
also very interested in such issues.  We had a discussion about some
changes in TL for Windows at EuroTeX 2007.  What we have in mind is to
make cross platform installation easier.  It is even helpful to know
people who already have some experience with such things.

I recommend to use TeXLive's default directory structure for UNIX,
i.e.

  /usr/local/texlive/2007
  /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

or, if you want,

  /usr/local/share/texlive/2007
  /usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-local

The idea is that texmf-local is not inside 2007 so that you can
switch to TeXLive-2008 without worrying about texmf-local.

If this structure is not appropriate for you and another structure
doesn't work, let me know.  At the moment it's best to use TL's
defaults and if you have special requirements we can discuss them
later. 

The most important thing you have to know is that TeX-related programs
find their config file (texmf.cnf) relative to their location.  For
instance, 

   <some directory>/bin/<platform>/tex

expects texmf.cnf at

   <some directory>/bin/<platform>/../../texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

The value of <some directory> doesn't matter, given that 
<some directory>/bin/<platform> is in PATH.

However, the main difference between TL for UNIX and TL for Windows is
that the main config files (texmf.cnf) are different.

Fortunately, as far as I can see, it's no problem in your case because
the Windows version of this file is only found if the environment
variable TEXMFCNF is set (which the Windows installer already did for
you).  Without this variable, the UNIX version will be found (in
texmf/web2c).

On UNIX you don't have to set any environment variable.  The only
exception is that you have to add the bin/<platform> directory to PATH.

You might want to set MANPATH and INFOPATH, though.

If there are any problems on UNIX, run

   texconfig conf

and examine the output carefully.  Please let us know if something
doesn't work. 

 > How do you consider to use debian package-manager instead of installing
 > TeXLive2007 on Ubuntu?

I personally prefer not to mix up software I installed myself with
software provided by my Linux distributor.  This is the reason I
suggested to install it in /usr/local[/share] instead of in /usr/share. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Martin,

    (http://sarovar.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=493&aid=856&group_id=106)

The only feasible way to fix this is to update everything to use a
current version of Autoconf, which does not have these problems, as far
as I can see.  (ac_config_sub isn't even used any more.  I think these
problems were fixed years ago in Autoconf.)

peb put in a lot of effort toward this end a couple years ago, but
unfortunately we were unable to push things to the point of committing
the changes.

Barring someone else stepping in and making it happen, I can't promise
any particular timetable.  It's obviously a big job.  2008 looks dubious :(.

Sorry,
karl

Yeah, upon re-reading, you're right. It toes the line, but it doesn't

Ok, I'll update the License tag in the 0.9 version of texlive-texmf
packages, not removing anything until it is clear what is mandatory
to remove from Fedora TeXLive.

Thanks for the audit spot,

Indeed.  We didn't manage to do it entirely so far for Debian.  Do you
have a list of files with their licenses?  I'd like to add that somehow
to our copyright file, so that we can later verify more easily what has
been added.

TIA, Frank

I started to keep a complete list, but the sheer number of files started
to make that task absurd, so I focused on identifying things that were
not LPPL, GPL*, or Public Domain.

Hi list-ers, this is my first post to the list :-D

In the "welcome mail" sent by mailman
after subscribing to tex-live mailing list,
the first paragraph says:
        Welcome to the tex-live at tug.org mailing list! his list is devoted to
        the development of the TeX Live distribution. The work is done by
        volunteers. Let us know how &lt;b>you&lt;/b> can help!

In first line, we can read
        "his list is devoted..."
instead of
        "This list is devoted..."

In the last line, there is an embedded "pseudo"-HTML code
inside a plain text file:
        "&lt;b>you&lt;/b>"
This code is a nonsense in a text-mode mail reader, so
I think it must be removed.


I think they are two bugs, aren't they?

Javier

Thanks Javier.  I fixed up the welcome message.

    Hi list-ers, this is my first post to the list :-D

Mailing list stuff is actually better directed at tex-live-owner at tug.org
than the list itself, although I guess I never explicitly say so.
However, thank you for taking the time to report it in any case :).

As for I'm no Unix expert, I oriented me on my previous
tetex-installation (debian package-manager) which put the texmf-local
into /home/%user%/texmf/

I will now take your recomandation

Is this maybe a permissions problem? If you install as a regular
user, then you should pick a directory for TLroot to which you have
writing rights, e.g. under c:/Users/<your username>. The default,
c:/TeXLive2007, almost certainly won't work without administrator
privileges.

Subject: [tex-live] zip'ed archives in the installed TeXLive tree
Message-ID: <87hcn0bnhp.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

by chance I found that there are a number of zip files in texmf-dist/doc
of an installed TeXLive tree (I looked at TL 2007).  Most of them
contain documentation (or font) sources, I think it would be better to
install them in the source tree, maybe even unzipped.  Some are
different, though, and rather a real bug:

- TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/greektex/ywcl.zip

,---- README
| ywcl.zip          This contains all the metafont files necessary
|                   to produce the Greek fonts.
`----

- TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/mathdesign/commercialfonts/mdfga.zip

contains a lot of Type1 fonts (GPL'ed math fonts for use with Fontsite
Garamond) 

- TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/webeq/acrotex.zip

This seems to be an archive with dtx, ins and more documentation files
which should be installed

- TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/webeq/eq2db.zip
  TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/webeq/eq_pdfs.zip

,---- README
| 6)  eq_pdfs.zip -- this zip file contains a file eq_pdfs.tex that
|     demonstrates that exerquiz works with pdfscreen.
| 7)  eq2db.zip/eq2db Package --- The eq2db Package is a LaTeX package converts exerquiz
|     quizzes to quizzes that are submitted to server-side script. There are also
|     general server-side script for storing quiz results to to a database, emailing
|     results to the instructor, and storing quiz results to a tab-delimited text file.
|     The scripts are ASP (Active Server Pages) and require Ms IIS 4.0 or later.
`----

Not sure whether it's worth unzipping these, but generally the TeX"Live"
approach requires unzipped files, doesn't it?

- TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/stellenbosch/templates/masters-sample.zip
  TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/stellenbosch/templates/report-sample.zip

Well, sample files showing how to use this publisher's styles.

ok

here's the first report:

scenario:

- Windows Vista Buissenes
- Ubuntu 6.06 LTS as fileserver
- mapping U:\ to /usr/local/
- installing into U:\texlive

file-rights are set properly on the server-share (testet)

First of all my plan to install both binaries failed, because win32 is
checked and the boxes are greyed-out
(you my look at the screenshot:
http://members.gaponline.de/afj/latex/texlive_win32.png)

The installation is very slow. And I mean very very ...

I startet at 14:14 and it is not yet finished :-(

At least, it remained nearly 2h at installing catalogue ...

I coukd not figure out, there the reasons could be,

I checked:

- CPU load (unde 10%)
- network traffic (nearly idle)

I transferred a 20 MB file from the Vista-PC to /usr/local/texlive/ in a
few seconds ...

any ideas?

is xcopy invoked by texlive-setup? its idle too ...

hope installation will finsih until tomorrow ...

I suppose that Tomek can tell us more.

Maybe it's best to simply copy the Linux binary files directly from
the DVD to the destination directory.  Don't know whether the
installer is helpful here.

I assume that you have the DVD since the CD is not provided by DANTE.
It is well known that installing from the DVD is quite slow.  The
reason is that the DVD provides the live system (more than 50000
files!).  Installing TL from the CD is significantly faster because
there are only 1500 zip files.

It is also a well known problem that copying files on Windows is less
efficient than on UNIX.

Anyway, more than 6 hours is definitely too much, and it seems that
you have a DVD drive which cannot deal with many small files
efficiently.  If you have another DVD drive in your Linux box it would
be nice to know how much time it takes to install TeXLive there.  
You can install it in /tmp and remove it later.

Do you really mean "in a few seconds"?  That would mean that the data
rate is less than 20MB/s.  If this is actually the case, something is
wrong with your DVD drive (or with the driver file, or probably with
Windows itself).

If it's significantly faster to install TL on your Linux box it would
be interesting to know what happens if you exchange the DVD drives.

It turns out those particular afm's were bogus -- old and incorrect
copies with wrong filenames.  I've removed them from the TeX Live source
repo.

    CTAN:/fonts/urw/base35/afm/ is consistent here.

Ralf, I'm glad you mentioned that directory on CTAN.  The
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/urw/{bookman,helvetic} directories in TL are now
identical with the files on CTAN -- it turns out all the other files
were already the same, so nothing else had to be changed besides the
removals above.  (I didn't check the other URW typefaces yet.)

Thanks,
k

I doubt, if it hasn't been finished after, say, 30 minutes. DVD 
installation is slow (know issue) but not that slow -- I guess it hangs 
for some reason. I suspect Vista executive data protection or so... 
Sorry, I have completely no expirience with that os, have never run TL

There seems to be something wrong with TL 2007. I use DVD-RW drives
from LG, new models. Installation of TL 2005 took about 30 minutes
while installation of TL 2007 on a similar HW took more than 4 hours.

It seems that communication between Vista and Linux needs Samba-Version
3.0.24 or higher. Unfortunately I'm using 22 (this is the debian stable)

I'll give a local installtion a try!

Yesterday I did a local test install on a Vista Business virtual
machine as a regular user. I used the downloadable image, so any
problems with the physical dvd wouldn't have shown up. The
installation was fairly slow but uneventful, except:

- I set a non-default value for TLroot
- TeXLive wasn't added to the search path and had to be added
  manually, IIRC. Other environment variables were ok.
- The Ghostscript install was `for everybody' and required
  administrative credentials.

I could try a minimal network install with the real dvd. My Linux,
Ubuntu Feisty, has Samba 3.0.24.

Hi,

we are crashing with "too many open files" on PDFTeX from TeXlive.
The object id where this happens is 513 or so, and it would be my
guess that PDFTeX keeps image files open as long as it has not yet
shipped them out.

It would appear that the system limitations of win32 are much larger,
so I suspect the runtime with which TeXlive2007 has been compiled.

Does anybody have a good pointer to where I might look for further
information?  This is quite a bad roadblock for us.

Ok, I got this info on the Lua list:

<URL:http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6e3b887c(VS.80).aspx>

Given the other array sizes of TeX, bumping this to the maximum of
2048 seems like a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, I don't have a
compilation/crosscompilation environment available here.  What is the
fastest way to get a working binary?  Is there a reasonably easy to
set up compilation or crosscompilation environment?

Thanks,

I believe the W32 binaries in TL were built by Akira using MS Visual  
Studio tools, but I don't know whether/how this limit can be  
controlled there.

As a workaround, have you tried alternatives such as generating DVI  
output and then running dvipdfmx? It's possible that might handle  
things differently.

See other mail on this: it would appear to be easy to fix this
(namely: bump the number to 2048) in the sources.

Far too many PDFTeX specific features in use, I am afraid.  That road
is not open to us at the moment.

Interesting.  "Closed" with "Worksforme" because an application
accumulated file descriptors erroneously.

The problem is that we actually _have_ this amount of outstanding
images not yet shipped out.  No programming error.

Putting the single line

_setmaxstdio(2048);

into web2c startup does not seem like it would be an overly onerous
complication, would it?

I remember years ago when I started with my conference wrapper scripts
that windows crashed around that number, and because I needed to access
 >1500 papers, Fabrice Popineau (in cooperation with Hans) provided a
version with did it.
Since then I never had any reason to complain, so may be you should
ask Fabrice.

I've confirmed that by

#if defined(pdfTeX) || defined(luaTeX)
  _setmaxstdio(2048);
#endif

2041 files in
Vladimir's example are included. Probably 7 are stdin, ... etc.

well, it has been a problem there (till the number was jumped there; i 
clearly remember such problems a few years ago); also, fabrice 
investigated the problem years ago and provided solutions but as usual 
his patches were never included in the code base so no wonder that the 
problem creeps up again ...

I'm pretty fed up with these windows rants and 'no problem on unix' kind

and suggesting that it's near to impssible to compile something on 
windows ... a fact that is proven wrong by fabrice and akira

(anyhow, it's no problem to macro program around the problem, either by 
using immediate flushing (if remember right one solution was to close 
1-page docs afterwards because it's the multipage docs that complicate 
things but i dunno what's left of that patch) and/or do a multipass job)

No, Fabrice's patch from some years ago has been included and solves
this problem on Unix.

"near to impossible", "easy", "trivial": those are synonyms only for
mathematicians.  And counterexamples just prove "not impossible".

I have in this thread described that supporting Windows installations
has proven to be _the_ major developer tiedown for the company I am
working in for most of the last 6 months, and that it has proven to be
a major developer resource hog for AUCTeX (which I am maintainer of)
as well.

Nobody lists the names of people who managed to compile TeXlive on
Unix.  It is not actually an achievement worth noting, in particular
on the rather Posix-compliant free Unix variants/clones.

The README in TeXlive contains no build instructions for Windows.

Again, "no problem" and "conceivably possible" are the same mostly for
mathematicians.

In the mean time, there remains the problem that the number of open
files permitted by the C library is much more limited on our Windows
compilations than technically mandated, and I propose that this be
fixed, regardless of whether or not other platforms don't exhibit this
behavior.

Stop.

Let's get back to the facts: I can easily include 10000 different pdfs
on one page (and claim that the number of files is only limited by
memory) -- when \pdfximage is \immediate (which is normally is not).
This works on Linux. Does this not work on Windows?

Can't check during the weekend.  What does it mean for an image to be
immediate?  Probably something different than for a write...  One
would need to patch up \includegraphics when using this with LaTeX,
right?

I am afraid that I am none the wiser what it would mean and imply to
turn every \pdfximage into \immediate\pdfximage.

Yes. This works:

\let\mypdfximage\pdfximage
\def\pdfximage{\immediate\mypdfximage}

\documentclass[pdftex,a5paper]{book}
\usepackage[papersize={8.5in,11in}]{geometry}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
%
\let\mypdfximage\pdfximage
\def\pdfximage{\immediate\mypdfximage}
%
\begin{document}
\newcount\i
\i=2
\loop
  \ifnum\i<3000
    \includepdf[pages={-}]{\number\i.pdf}%
  \advance\i by1
\repeat

\end{document}

works also on Windows.  The "immediate" version does not
depend on the limitation on the number of open files.

Thanks,
Akira

Don't rise to the bait, Hans : for every Windows-specific problem
mentioned on this list, there are probably ten *X-specific problems,
almost invariably caused by the fact that there are ten million
computers in the world running *X, and each and every one of
them has different libraries, different compilers, different
versions, different this, different that, different everything.
Windows is the one thing that keeps most of us sane : just laugh
when the *X guys feel so insecure that they have to launch yet
another attack :-)))

Phil, I respect you because I know that you are an TeX expert.  You
usually know what you are talking about and you are certainly more
familiar with TeX than anybody else.  But what you said about UNIX is
pure crap and I must admit that I'm quite disappointed.

Windows is pure crap.  At work I'm forced to to use Windows, sigh....

Since Windows doesn't provide a reasonable user interface, I installed
GNU-Emacs.

Can anyone explain me why I can access remote file systems on Windows
with Emacs (in dired mode) ***immediately*** and it takes about 20
seconds when I try the same with "Windows Explorer"?
 
Our administrators are clueless.

I'm clueless too.  But I'm happy that I have Emacs. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <bd12d4cb0708172058y493e5577x1a7f16886be712d2@mail.gmail.com>

I think I have run across a Y2K-style bug in alpha.bst.  The bug.tex
and bug.bib files (see below) are a minimal example I've been able to
recreate.  The references list should have "Mar77a" and "Mar77b", but
instead the label "Mar77" is duplicated.  I've included a patch
(further below) that seems to correct this problem.

In the calc.label function, a two-digit year is appended to a
three-character key created earlier in that function.  This becomes
the label output later in a \bibitem command.  However, before
checking for duplicate labels, the style file appends a four-digit
year to the three-character key.  This longer label is then checked
for duplication.  In my example, calc.label produces the same label
for each ("Mar77"), but forward.pass compares "Mar7718" and "Mar7719"
(from my limited understanding of the code) and doesn't see the
duplication.

windows does what it's designed for, rather well.  for some inscrutable
reason, m$ didn't design it to be a comfortable home for your average
hacker.  (like you or me.)

windows provides a user interface that is (in principle) good for those
who need it.

i hate it, but it wasn't designed for people like me ... but i am often
irritated that i need to help our admin people when they get stuck in
one of its nooks and/or crannies.  imo, it tries to do too much, and
slips when things get really complicated.

contrast this with the un*x style of "you need to know this arcanely-
named command before you can do that sort of thing".  for all that i
dislike windows' ui, i'm glad we no longer require our admin people to
do that (we migrated the last of them when nt4 became stable).

i've the same irritation about file systems under linux (firefox in
particular is *really* silly there ... *all* significant file systems
are remote, at work).

> Our administrators are clueless.

i'm not terribly clueful, but my colleague is really good.  this isn't a
bad combination -- he does the complicated stuff, i trot out to help
with the ui queries (as mentioned above).

> I'm clueless too.  But I'm happy that I have Emacs. 

emacs isn't for everyone (any more than vi is).  for all that i like it,
i don't feel the need to force it on anyone else.  i (vehemently) hate
word, but that feeling doesn't extend to wanting to teach (la)tex or
context to a temporary receptionist (for example).

in summary, imo -- it's horses for courses.  we (says he, sweepingly
including himself in the tex-live team) need to support both types of
system (and, of course, macs too).  if there weren't the odd problem on
one type of system, that doesn't appear on the others, it would be truly
amazing -- there are enough differences of system style that problems on
one are inevitable different on the other.

so there's no need for a flame war -- phil's right to that extent.  and
if you're really keen on such a thing, there are lots of usenet advocacy
groups, where flame wars are the order of the day.  let's concentrate on
what we're here for.

Well, it was intentionally provocative, but that doesn't
mean it's not grounded in truth : if you read back over
the TeX live correspondence (which is the list to which
I was referring, rather than PdfTeX or NTGTeX or whatever)
you will see over and over again questions caused by different

This is your personal perspective, and I respect your right
to hold it; for me, *X is crap, and I wouldn't touch it with
a barge-pole.  Let us agree to differ and continue to discuss
(amicably) things that really matter, such as whether Kerala
coffee is the best in the world :-)

Yes, there is a ?registry? tweak that will stop explorer from trying
to enumerate remote (networked) files; it is a pain, and I
completely agree.  When I find the reference, I'll forward
it to you (and your administrators !).

Because they can.  So they are more noticeable than the two people who
had actually managed to get it compiled under Windows.

The autoconf documentation contains a section about portable shell
programming: what kind of stuff you can rely on to work everywhere,
and what not.

It is a real horror show and a bit of a nuisance to keep everything in
mind.  The resulting scripts sometimes are a bit awkward.

But this does not hold a candle to programming cmd.exe.  Something
like

for i in /opt /usr/local /opt/* /usr/local/*
do
  if test -d "$i"/software
  then
    cd "$i"
    subdir="$i"
    break
  fi
done

becomes (in a batch file, on the command line it looks different)

for /D %%I in (C:\ D:\ C:\* D:\*) do (
  if exist %%I\software\NUL (
    %%~dI
    cd %%~pnI
    set subdir=%%I
    goto found
  )
)
:found

Except that it probably won't work when you are in a subdirectory of
C: or D: currently.  And passing the found string into Java with
"%subdir%" can cause the trailing quote to be added (because it may be
backslash-preceded) into the command line argument.

And if you use "echo on" in your batch file (the default), what gets
echoed back at you is garbage, because Windows does not manage to
treat the %%x stuff correctly when echoing.

It is _much_ _much_ harder to find the necessary information for batch
programming under Windows on the net, and while portability is not
much of a concern, the portable subset of shell programming is still
much more straightforward and usable than what cmd.exe provides.

Have you actually programmed any serious batch scripts under Windows?
Or are your opinions not based on working with the system?

No, that was TEXMFHOME.  texmf-local is /usr/local/texmf in the Debian
packages.  But of course things need to be different when one installs
distribution-provided packages.

Another proof that it is possible to build highly functional cross-platform
applications is the R statistical package.

In general, I don't have much patience for these religious discussions
(which have an unfortunate tendency to pop up in google searches so an
offhand comment becomes part of the folklore).

The TeX community is at a critical juncture:

1.  TeX Live has, by fiat, become the successor to teTeX on *x systems

2.  TeX Live aims to support a wider range of platforms than did
teTeX.   We have a long history of failed TeX distributions on
Windows: 4allTeX, Y&Y, fptex, which is a clear sign that making a
viable TeX distro for Windows is not easy.

There are individuals and organizations that are able to use TeX productively
under Windows and under *x, so I don't except that either of these is
fundamentally broken.  What is, however, clear, is that many people
have had or are having bad experiences.  In fact, I see this at work,
where some users insist that tex on unix is totally useless while
others assert the same about TeX on Windows.  What is the difference?

1.  In the real world, many systems are not working as they should.
When I press guy who says tex on unix is useless it turns out that his
problems are: a) he wants to use
a printer on a Windows server that is not configured on the unix machine, b) the
system default is for a4 paper and he can't be bothered to figure out
how to adjust this, and c) there is nothing similar to WinEDT on the
system.  The guy who says TeX on Windows is useless has installed
4allTeX, Y&Y, fptex, and miktex along with copies of his $HOME/texmf
from unix but hasn't got a working perl, ruby, or ghostscript and is
trying to use notepad as his editor.  His plain tex documents compile,
but he can't get pdflatex to work because he has some outdated
packages that assume pdftex is used only to produce .pdf output.  He
can't troubleshoot because the command line tools (find, whence, etc.)
he knows from *x aren't available.

2.  Different environments require different work habits.   Many
Windows TeX users
never see a command line, equate TeX with WinEDT, and are only vaguely
aware of the individual programs, much less perl, ghostscript, etc.

3.  Hardware differences: machines currently in wide use range from
PIII 500 mhz
with 256M RAM and 20GB disk to multi-core CPU, multi-GB RAM, and
multi-TB disk.

To me, the fundamental difference is that *x systems have always been
based on a toolkit approach where a set of core utilities are always
available.  People will tell you that you can have bash, awk, sed,
perl, ghostscript, make, compilers, etc. on Windows, but the practical
reality is that such tools aren't part of the standard base
configuration and suffer from performance issues.   The pdftex build
script works on most *x systems using only standard packages from the
OS distribution.

I have written some applications that are used on both *x and windows.
  While it is possible to have a build environment on Windows (using
Msys),  it has been much easier to use a cross-compiler under linux,
e.g., <http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/>.  It would be
interesting to try using these tools to create a build-win32.sh for
pdftex.

Note that once somebody has gotten TeX to compile and work, using it
becomes reasonably straightforward.  The really rough penalties are
not on the users, they are on the developers because Windows does not
provide any work environment that would be available anywhere else.

So if you are staying Windows-only, you might be able to find a
compromise working for you.  If you want to develop cross-platform,
Windows is going to be the single most painful thing.

Why do we have so many Windows-only distributions?  Why is it that
among the widely portable distributions, the Windows ports are, if at
all, done by specialists?

Supporting Windows for cross-platform applications is always going to
be extremely expensive with regard to developer resources because on
Windows most things don't give a damn about standards or usability,
and the workaround applications and libraries (where you don't get to
see this) are Windows-only and thus not generally useful for portable
application development.

A working cross compilation environment would help a _lot_.

Also very useful is Log Parser 2.2 (which does far far more than
parsing log files !) and, of course, Perl.

It must be mentioned that one actually needs single-iteration

intuitive.

Perl is not exactly creditable to Windows now, is it?

since the very beginning of pdftex I used to cross-compile
pdftex binaries using the following cross-compilers:

djgpp
mingw32
gnuwin32

(and recently also gcc for linux ppc)

Then I didn't need to do that anymore, so I stopped
being interested in this issue. But until now I can still
cross-compile at least djgpp from the latest pdftex sources.
However I heard from Hans that djgpp binaries are not that
fast as those compiled by mingw32.

IIRC Taco is using mingw32 to build luatex binaries for
windows, so he may have more useful input.

Anyway, if anyone needs djgpp binaries of pdftex, I can make
that immediately.

Yes, but there is a bootstrapping problem when doing software
installers.  You can't use software until you have unpacked it...

I used to use msys and gnuwin32 tools, but now I find I prefer to run
real linux in a VMware appliance so I have have current versions and
avoid the little compatibility glitches.   The free VMware player is
easy to install and you can copy applicances around.  Appliances can
mount windows shares. Since the systems I'm using tend to be older
hardware I find it better to use the existing Exceed or Xming session
for the display rather than having two X servers running.   Building
pdftex in a VMware appliance running linux is quite practical.

> Yes, but there is a bootstrapping problem when doing software
> installers.  You can't use software until you have unpacked it...

I should mention that there are debian packages for the mingw cross-compiler.

I don't have debian at home, so I use the archive from
<http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/i586-cross-tools.tar.bz2>.  The
compiler is quite old:
$ i586-mingw32-gcc --version
i586-mingw32-gcc (GCC) 3.4.5 (mingw special)

I think pdftex builds with such old gcc on *x.  Today I tried building
pdftex-1.40.5 with this cross-compiler.  There were some configure issues

checking size of long... configure: error: can not run test program while cross
compiling
configure: error: ../../../src/texk/web2c/configure failed for web2c
configure: error: ../../src/texk/configure failed for texk

I got as far as tangleboot.o, but then encounter:

i586-mingw32-gcc -o tangleboot tangleboot.o  lib/lib.a ../kpathsea/.libs/libkpat
hsea.a -lm
../kpathsea/.libs/libkpathsea.a(progname.o):progname.c:(.text+0x69):
undefined reference to `_set_home_warning'

This seems to refer to stuff from texk/contrib that isn't included
with pdftex-1.40.5.

One strategy that has worked in the past is to steal as much as possible (e.g.,
generated web2c sources) from a linux build.   So you need the usual
libraries and
one additional library for Win32 compatibility/features.  My
experience from other projects has been that much of what you get from
configure on linux stays the same using mingw, so rather than fighting
the "can not run test program while cross compiling" issues it may be
easier to manipulate the files generated on linux.   I don't see the
need to use
similar hardware for the linux build as a significant limitation,
although I suppose
there will be interest in using OS X for Intel to build Win32 binaries.

I suspect one reason the Win32 build systems have lagged is that until
recently the performance benefits of commercial compilers were useful,
so it didn't make much
sense to invest effort in building with free tools.   GCC code has
been getting better,
and the hardware is faster, so I suspect the advantage of a commercial
compiler is
no longer much of an issue.

    by chance I found that there are a number of zip files in texmf-dist/doc

Well, I don't disagree that many of these would be better unpack, but
(generally) TL copies what's on CTAN, and (generally) CTAN takes what
the authors give them.  So the authors are the ones who should be
contacted.  

    - TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/greektex/ywcl.zip

That way on CTAN.

    - TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/webeq/acrotex.zip

Acrotex and related are so weird (and so Acrobat-dependent) I have never
had time or energy to try to get them working.  I think I'll just remove
that webeq package from TL for now.  If it ever becomes more feasible to
install, we can revisit it.

    - TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/stellenbosch/templates/masters-sample.zip
      TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/stellenbosch/templates/report-sample.zip

They're just docs.  That way on CTAN.

Text of the license is here:

texmf-dist/doc/fonts/literat/license

The files aren't licensed internally, but thats not shocking, since
tex-live is a collection of a lot of sources. I searched the tree for
anything calling itself literat, and made the assumption that they were
under that license:

texmf-dist/fonts/type1/paragrap/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/vf/paragrap/literat/
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/paragrap/literat/

there are some commercial tex's because there is profit involved ..

concerning the other ones .. .

miktex: complete system, way ahead on other systems with regards to 
integration and packaging

fptex/xemtex: governemnement funded integrated environment for education

ptex: distribution that takes cjk processing into account

so, each has its purpose

(btw, he mac also has some 4+ distributions)

concerning specialists ... in my opinion the number of people involved 
in maintianing the unix code base is also rather specialized and not 
that large either

i don't know them personally. the creators are the "ParaGraph International",
which is now ParaType Inc., a well known font foundry in russia.

around 1996 (as the copyright date states), they got a grant from RFBR
(www.rfbr.ru), and essentially made available (released) the
"Literaturnaya" family of their fonts under non-commercial license,
for use with TeX-related applications.

ParaType still sells Literaturnaya fonts, btw.

I don't know how big are the chances of getting them to make a change
to the license text. Probably not high, but if you'd like to take a
chance, it would be great. You have bigger weight than me for such
inquiry. :)

I guess that if this discovery (thank you Tom, this was indeed a
thorough work!) makes the literat fonts unacceptable for distribution
as part of TeX Live, i'll just upload them to CTAN (they are still not
there, as far as i remember), and we will ask to make them installable
via the install-nonfree-fonts script...

Best,
v.

I'm using Gentoo Linux, a source code distribution, and I'm glad to
see how good it works.  I'm not a C programmer and I'll certainly have
a problem if not everything compiles without manual interaction.  But
everything works perfectly.  Yes, there are many different libraries
with different version numbers.  But it doesn't matter because
programs usually know which (versions of) libraries they need.   

There are different versions of .DLL files on Windows too,
unfortunately the file name doesn't contain the version number.  If
people always use standard tools to install software, the installer
certainly looks into the .DLL file and prevents a recent version from
being replaced by an older one.  But there are people you called
monkeys in a previous mail.  And there are many monkeys in the Windows
world. 

I often get CDs containing data sheets.  They usually contain PDF
files.  Some of them come with a toc file in HTML, but some require
that you have to install them, whatever this means.  Some even require
that you have admin rights.  These CDs go into the trash can
immediately.  Either they want to break my system deliberately, what I
don't believe because they want me to buy their products, or they are
what you call monkeys.  I doubt that anybody who doesn't know what an
admin account is good for is able to install software on my system
properly. 

There are probably monkeys in the UNIX world too, but I think that the
fact that shared libraries provide the version number in the file name
is much more robust than the Windows approach (which is definitely not
monkey proof).

What you said about UNIX was an assumption.  If you have some time,
why not install a Linux system, maybe on a virtual machine, and play
with it?  You'll see that all your assumptions are wrong.

There are many Linux distributions available but I think that Gentoo
is the best one for you because, as far as I know you, it's imortant
for you to know how things work.  You have to do things manually while
other distributions provide menus.  But you immediately see how things
work.  I really hope that you find some time to play with it.

That would be nice.  The problem exists on XP but not on 9x.  My first
assumption was that it is a DNS problem but specifying the IP number
instead of the hostname didn't help.  I now also believe that there is
something wrong either in the network setup or the registry.  A
colleague already looked into the network setup and found a few
improvements but the main problem still exists.  Fabrice said that the
registry is a distributed database, so I assume that I can't make a
backup before I edit it.  Hence, I'm interested in some hints from
people who know what has to be changed.  Making own experiments is too
dangerous.  I'm on vacation at the moment, but I'll come back to the
issue later.

You *can* [ab]use 'cat' to print a file to screen but the UNIX tool
designed for this task is 'more' and not 'cat'.  There is also 'less',
which allows you to scroll backwards but it's probably not installed
on every UNIX system.

Please stop this discussion now. It has totally left its subject and I
don't think anybody here is really interested in a Holy war.

Windows exists and has users who want to use TeX. We have to support
them. The same is true for Unix. EOD.

Martin, it was your "rant" [1] (Hans's terminilogy) that triggered
this debate; you are the last person to be in a position to
ask the rest of us to cease.  Some interesting things have
already emerged, and others may yet so do.  I would also point
out that unlike many earlier "religious wars", this one
is actually being conducted with a degreee of civility and
mutual respect.

Subject: [tex-live] sharing packages between texlive and miktex?
Message-ID: <74f506dc0708190252h1a4dc78amdd45e3f02c7b6833@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

since many of miktex and texlive packages are
platform-independent (ie most of them contain only macros +
fonts + doc), I wonder would it be useful to build a package
repository that miktex and texlive can share?

First let me describe briefly the main components of miktex
and their counterpart in texlive:

,--------
| initexmf - MiKTeX configuration utility
|     maintains issues related to formats, filename database,
|     configuration for various programs, map files etc.
|
|     texlive counterpart: updmap, texhash and alike scripts.
|
| mthelp - MiKTeX help utility
|     display doc for individual packages.
|
|     texlive counterpart: texdoc (?)
|
| mpm - MiKTeX package manager
|     search/install/remove/update platform-indenpendent packages.
|
|     texlive counterpart: none
|
| miktex GUI to the above components
|     texlive counterpart: none (?)
`--------

I have no intention to say that texlive should follow miktex
or learn something from that. However, it seems a pity to me
that the enormous effort to maintain those
platform-indenpendent packages is duplicated.

I did a small experiment on linux powerpc as follows:

- build pdftex + kpsewhich + kpseaccess for linux powerpc
  (using cross-compiler)
- build miktex tools for unix (the relevant tool is mpm)
- setup a proper texmf.cnf

then I can use tex with the packages managed by mpm. And mpm
can install packages from any CTAN site, since miktex package
repository is part of CTAN. In short, mpm is something very
much like an apt/jum (a linux package manager) for tex,
which allows us to install a very small tex installation and
add needed packages on-demand.

So, in summary, I think it would be a great improvement if:

- the effort to maintain platform-indenpendent packages can
  be put together to build a package repository that can be
  used by both miktex and texlive. It would be something
  like the miktex repository at the moment, but with more
  packages (and more up-to-date) like in texlive.

- texlive can come up with something similar as mpm to have
  finer control on package management. mpm can be used for
  linux, but I assume it's not trivial to get it work for
  all unix systems that texlive support.


Just some thoughts,
Thanh

That way, you'll get a considerable number of files with wrong license
information.  Even in one directory on CTAN, there are sometimes files
with different licenses.  It may be safe to assume that all the font
files down here:

> texmf-dist/fonts/type1/paragrap/literat/
> texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/literat/
> texmf-dist/fonts/vf/paragrap/literat/
> texmf-dist/fonts/afm/paragrap/literat/
> texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/paragrap/literat/
> texmf-dist/tex/latex/literat/

belong to one CTAN package, but you cannot assume that for the LaTeX
support.  And just becaues the license has the same name as the fonts
directory, you don't know that they are actually related.  Hm, where are
those fonts on CTAN?  I couldn't find them...

no they don't.  they might belong to a ctan package if there was one,
but there isn't.

however, vladimir seems to have proposed that he upload it, so perhaps
there will be one in time for next time ... and if the licence is put to
rights, it can be in texlive, even.

That wasn't a rant (and it was with tongue in cheek), that was a try
to state a fact that David didn't make clear: That his problems (and
his fix) where on Windows. This could all have been over sooner if
David had given more information up front.

If you want to continue this discussion, fine; but please leave
ntg-pdftex out of this.

There can also be platform neutral packages (oberdiek package
provides pdfatfi.pl) containing scripts.  Some may require a simple
platform dependent addition to the bin directory.   If you install
the oberdiek package with mpm on linux, any existing pdfatfi
(normally, a copy of pdfatfi.pl put in the bin directory) is not
updated.  It is possible to get around this on *X by using a
symbolic link to the following script:

#! /bin/sh
what=`echo $0 | sed 's at .*/@@'`
p=`kpsewhich -format=texmfscripts $what.pl`
{ test -n "$p" && test -f "$p"; } \
  || { echo "\`$what.pl' not found."; exit 1; }
exec perl "$p" ${1+"$@"}

This, however, may not be acceptable for security reasons.
I'm not near a WIn32 machine, so I'm not sure how MiKTeX handles
this, but it points to a key problem -- for a package manager to
be effective, the distribution needs to have some mechanism to
ensure that the "right" versions of scripts are being used.
Perhaps the best approach is to add some post-install message
reminding the user to install the scripts (e.g,, by updating a
wrapper or copying to a bin directory).

One of the major criticisms of TL has been the lack of package
manager support for updates.   Some people who use *X for
most of their work continue to use MiKTeX on Win32 because
they find it too difficult to (convince the sys admin) to install updates
on the *X machine.

I'm not sure that sharing needs to be a priority.  The first step
should be to add mpm to texlive as an experiment (or just
convince enough people to start using it with TL2007) and to
gain experience that will help going forward with package
management.  I'd suggest adding a texmf-mpm tree that is
managed by mpm.   This would provide a way for users to
install current versions of platform-neutral packages.

For those not familiar with miktex, it has the ability to install missing
packages while formatting a document.  I assume this means installing
a copy of some master file list that is consulted when a file can't be found
on the local system.   This is a bit problematic where texmf trees are
shared, as you may want some updated packages available to all users
and others only to a few.

There are two types of resources: human inputs needed to
put whatever an author decides to provided into a package,
and machine resources (disk space, processing to create
and serve out packages).

I think the human inputs are the limiting factor, and I worry that
they require experience and expertise that will be difficult to
maintain over the long run.

I like to think in terms of "core" platforms where everything in
TL is expect to work: linux 2.6 kernels, WinXP, OS X (both
flavours), solaris (recent versions).   For non-core platforms
only tetex functionality (basic tex and pdftex) would be expected
to work, but some utilities and latex packages that rely on other
binaries may not be available simply because the 3rd party
tools (appropriate versions of perl, gs, libraries, etc. aren't readily
available).

It doesn't make sense to insist that every TL tool work on every
platform.  In the case of package managers, most sites that rely
on some legacy platform can get a TL core machine to maintain
texmf trees, either shared via NFS or copied (rsync, etc.) to the
non-core machines.

I wrote this before I noticed that it isn't on CTAN, but it was also a
general remark (together with the "you can't assume that..." in the
beginning).

What would be useful is discussion of particular problems that need
to be addressed, with the objective of 1) educating those of us with
experience slanted to one platform and 2) coming up with solutions.

There is no shortage of problems:

1) every "#Ifdef PLATFORM" in the sources.  In some cases "PLATFORM"
seems to have been abused to mean "MS_Visual_C" and may not be
appropriate when using a cross-compiler.   In others it may have been
used where an autoconf #defined value would be better.

2) every teTeX shell script

Agreed.  I would also add that, as a non-member of the NTG-PdfTeX list,
all of my postings /must/ have been approved by the moderator.  I can
therefore only think that the moderator regards them as being sufficiently
on-topic to allow them onto the list, even if Martin disagrees.

Thanks, don't know how I missed it.

    anything calling itself literat, and made the assumption that they were
    under that license:

Yes.  I removed the literat package.  (I didn't remove the
literat-related file in tipps-und-tricks; not worth the special case.)

Reinhard, literat would be another good candidate for the
getnonfreefonts script.


On the other fronts: I removed the fancybox package, since a newer
fancybox.sty already exists in the current version of seminar package.

I asked Barbara Beeton at the AMS about taking care of the pcatcode
madness, in hopes we can get a free version shortly.  I'm sure they did
not intend the current situation.

Thanks,
Karl

Nobody does that in Unix and it would not change anything.  The Cygwin
"cat", in contrast, contains some hackery to interpret ANSI color
sequences on Windows, since Windows, surprise, surprise, does not
offer a standard-compliant console.

In short: you are complaining about a workaround for a deficiency
limited to Windows.

So can we have the one-liner extending the number of open files to
2048?  And as a bonus point, can somebody tell me how I get a working
Windows executable once this has been done in the source?

I have encountered mailing lists with a heavy-handed moderator like
that.  On most mailing lists, however, the moderator does not weed out
discussions between dissenting adults but rather makes sure that no
off-topic or deficient material (spam, sometimes completely
inappropriate postings by newcomers, oversized attachments, and so on)
gets on.

It is a heavy-handed move to actually censor postings, not usually
done lightly or without warning, and a warning takes work.

Please don't confuse a lack of censorship with personal approval: that
is heaping more responsibility/blame on list moderators than they
deserve.

the current situation was absolutely not

No; most of this discussion also went directly to me. If you check the
archives of ntg-pdftex, you'll find only one of your mails there.
Let's stop this cross-posting, please.

In MiKTeX, some of these scripts are available as exe binaries in the
MiKTeX bin directory, while mostly Perl scripts are available as such,
requiring an external Perl system (not part of MiKTeX) and setting
PATH to the additional directories they are stored at by hand. Only
the MiKTeX bin directory is added to PATH in the installation
process.

Can you tell me email address(es) to write to?  I agree it doesn't seem

(1)
Plese get

ftp://akagi.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/TeX/win32/pdftex-w32.tar.gz

and expand the tarball in a suitable temporary directory.

(2)
Copy "pdftex.dll" and "kpathsea356.dll" into bin/win32 of texlive.

(3)
Copy pdftex.pool into the directory for pool files of texlive.

(4)
Throw away all files in the tarball except for the above three.

Note that pdftex.pool must be replaced, because pdfTeX version
is different from TeXLive 2007.

Best regards,
Akira

Thanks!  That is a real life saver for me!  As compared with
TeXlive2007, I suppose I will have to regenerate the formats, correct?

yes the effort to maintain those packages is mandatory and
is not cheap. That's why it seem a pity to me that this
precious effort is spent twice on the (more or less) same
thing.

Hi Edd,

Sorry for the delayed reply.  Don't know if this is still relevant, but:

    mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for faqr6a.

Sounds like faqr6a is missing from pdftex.map.

Ordinarily, running updmap will put the enabled map entries into
psfonts.map (for dvips), pdftex.map (for pdftex), and dvipdfm.map (for
dvipdfm).

Whether the problem is simply that faqr6a isn't in pscyr.map or
pscyr2.map, or something else, I can't say.  pscyr isn't part of TeX
Live, and all I see on CTAN are Bakoma-related.

Hope this helps somehow.

It appears to be in the map ok:

-------8<-------
faqr6a   AntiquaPSCyr-Regular "T2AAdobeEncoding ReEncodeFont" <t2a.enc
<antiq6.pfb
-------8<-------

The port runs the following commands after installation:
mktexlsr > /dev/null 2>&1
updmap-sys --quiet --nomkmap --enable Map=pscyr.map
updmap-sys --quiet --enable Map=pscyr2.map

Is there another part of texlive which fullfills the function of these
fonts? If the package is going to be a problem I would rather suggest
obsoletion IF functionality can be obtained by alternate means.

For both TeXlive and PDFTeX, this compiler fails because of missing
header files.

The missing header files where the PDFTeX compilation bombs out from
the current PDFTeX sources _are_ present in the LuaTeX sources.

So it would appear that Taco's ability to crosscompile LuaTeX is not
just a case of figuring out the correct options to build.sh: more
would appear to be required here.

Even if it might prove too complex to provide this sort of setup for
TeXlive2007, having it for PDFTeX might already help some people.

I don't need it for TL directly; but for other TeX-related tools
(DVI drivers and xindy).

That is correct, I had to make some changes to the build system and
some small patches to the source code. I have been working off Siep
Kroonenberg's patches for tetex:

   http://tex.aanhet.net/mingtex/

These have been brought to the attention of the list a few times
already; nobody seems to care enough to integrate them for use with
texlive proper (myself included).

I have adjusted Siep's stuff so that it works for the core executables
I needed (tex/mp/mf) from tetex3/texlive, and also so that it does not
need re-autoconf to switch between cross and native (just re-configure
is good enough). The amount of code involved is fairly small, really.

> Even if it might prove too complex to provide this sort of setup for

Starting from luatex, it should be simple enough to compile pdftex
in the same way. Just exchange luatexdir with pdftexdir, update the 
build.sh script, and you are nearly there, I think.

Best wishes,
Taco

I did some more testing. Apparently, I did not remember correctly
about the searchpath, since this time it DID get modified.

Two more problems:

- at one test to a network drive, the installer got stuck for no
  apparent reason.  Another, similar network test installation did
  not get stuck. This may be general Samba- or Windows networking
  weirdness; see below.
- With the minimal scheme, the installer went crazy trying to
  generate formats which couldn't be generated, spawning more and
  more copies of pdftex, fmtutil and mktexfmt. This may have nothing
  to do with Vista or even Windows.

Privately, I try to avoid copying large amounts of data from a
Windows virtual machine to my virtual Samba network, since it very
often fails for obscure reasons.

So the only Vista-specific problem that I am sure of is that Vista
is pickier with permissions.

If you are refering to  win32lib.h, oldnames.h there are version in the TL svn
repository and in metapost-1.000.  For my experiment with pdftex I created
a src/win32 directory for the headers from metapost.  There were some
conflicts.  I ended up with:

export CC=i586-mingw32-gcc \
       CFLAGS='-DHAVE_BOOLEAN -D_UWIN -Dtrue=1 -Dfalse=0 -DTRUE=1
-DFALSE=0 -I../../../../src/win32 -I../../../src/win32' \
       CXX=i586-mingw32-c++ \
       RANLIB=i586-mingw32-ranlib

in build-win32.sh.  The -DHAVE_BOOLEAN is for kpathsea, the -D_UWIN is for the
mingw headers.

This is enough to build many .o files, but there are problems
with the Makefiles that generate a target (e.g. win32) tangleboot on a
linux host.
and also missing  library routines.

I think there are some underlying problems with excessive use of
#ifdef win32 rather than #ifndef HAVE_SOME_POSIX_CAPABILITY
that tend to enforce dependencies on a particular build environment.

I was hoping that pdftex would be stable by now -- but between bugs
in pdftex and in the libraries it needs rebuilding rather too often.

Sounds like a plan.

Right, well it won't be in the map because the port did not adjust it.
I don't see how this port *ever* worked.

I'll give it a shot. Many thanks for your help guys.

Of course: as Karl said, your pdftex.map file does not include the
entries for these fonts. That is the reason for this problem.

Now, as to why pdftex.map doesn't include these entries, you can find
out by checking your updmap.cfg (whether it contains an lines
"Map pscyr.map" and "Map pscyr2.map") and re-running updmap(-sys).

also, check that you have only one updmap.cfg.

you said that:

  The port runs the following commands after installation:
  mktexlsr > /dev/null 2>&1
  updmap-sys --quiet --nomkmap --enable Map=pscyr.map
  updmap-sys --quiet --enable Map=pscyr2.map

so this should have adjusted the updmap.cfg...

Hi,

I apologise if I'm being really dumb here.

There are 2 pdftex.map's on my system. There should be just one?
--------8<----------
eddlocal at dec170:eddlocal> kpsewhere pdftex.map
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
/usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
--------8<----------

However the first and third are duplicated for some reason.

The cyrillic font is infact installed in
/usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map:
--------8<----------
eddlocal at dec170:eddlocal> grep faqr6a
/usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
faqr6a AntiquaPSCyr-Regular "T2AAdobeEncoding ReEncodeFont" <t2a.enc <antiq6.pfb
faqr6a t2a antiq6
--------8<----------

So I guess that the map is in the wrong config file.

I am a little confused right now. Why is there 2 updmap.cfg's? Perhaps
I need to tell updmap-sys to use the main texmf tree somehow?

Many Thanks for your help.

yes.

you pdftex is using
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
(as can be seen from the log you've posted)

but the updmap tool updates another file:
/usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map

the problem could be fixed by either removing one of them, or
adjusting the search paths in texmf.cnf so that the texmf-var tree
will be searched first.

 EB> I am a little confused right now. Why is there 2 updmap.cfg's?

do you also have 2 updmap.cfg files?

Right, this is my own fault. The port looks like it needs amendment.
Ideally I would like to scrap this texmf-var tree altogether and
incorporate it in the main texmf tree if it isnt needed. It appears to
turn up after updmap-sys / mktexlsr (which is executed by the pkg
install). Is it required?

Nope :P Just getting confused again. Jeez, it's been a long day.

Thanks so much for assisting. Appreciated!

 EB> Nope :P Just getting confused again. Jeez, it's been a long day.

so you've meant to say "Why is there 2 pdftex.map's?"...

i guess the 1st one (from texmf) was included in the port, and the 2nd
one (from texmf-var) was generated by the updmap-sys.

the problem is that your texmf.cnf is configured in such a way that
texmf tree is searched before the texmf-var tree (and therefore pdftex
finds the one from the texmf tree), but updmap-sys creates the file in
the texmf-var tree.

so a change to texmf.cnf (the tree search order) would fix this problem.

Best,
v.

By setting TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFMAIN (as some comments suggest can be
done), it works well. Can we see any problems with this configuration?

in this case the generated files such as pdftex.map and even
updmap.cfg will go to the texmf tree?

it should work (in this case both updmap will generate pdftex.map in
the texmf tree, and pdftex will search for pdftex.map there), and it's
your decision whether to do it this way.

some distributions prefer to keep generated files in a separate tree.

The main purpose of TEXMF[SYS]VAR is that in some cases the main texmf
tree is read-only.  Consider the live system where everything is on
the DVD.  In this case you need another directory tree for generated
files.

Setting TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFMAIN should work.  However, I'm wondering
why the search order is wrong on your system.  Did you change
texmf.cnf yourself?

BTW, kpsewhich tells you which file is actually used, while kpsewhere
shows all files with a particular name.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It's nice that the literat package is TDS compliant, which makes it
easy to integrate it into getnonfreefonts.

However, all files supported by getnonfreefonts are .zip files.
But tex-archive/fonts/cyrillic/literat/literat-0.2.tar.gz is a .tar.gz
file.

getnonfreefonts depends on the program "unzip" which is supposed to be
available on every platform.

I translated the shell script we had in TL2005 to Perl in order to
make it available to Windows users, too.

Since we can't assume that the programs "tar" and "bzip" are available
on Windows,  I will not add literat to getnonfreefonts unless the
.tar.gz file is replaced by a .zip file on CTAN.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The usual thing would be for CTAN to hold it unpacked, and then they
make the fonts/cyrillic/literat.zip for the literat dir
semi-automatically.

Vladimir, maybe just ask them to unpack the tar.gz?

(them?)

personally, i think that holding an unpacked set of pfb, tfm and vf
files would be a crock (admittedly there are fd files too, but...)

anyway, i'm happy to convert the .tar.gz to .zip unless the rest of the
ctan team (copied) have some principled objection.

After thinking about it I think that there should be separate trees. I
have not ammended the search path. Today I was going to research what
the double exclaims meant in the TEXMF = {} parts.

After deciding to split out the trees properly, I reset TEXMFSYSCONFIG
to how texlive distributes it (Up until now I have set it to
$TEXMFMAIN).

Now I am faced with an error which I saw months ago during early
stages of porting:
-----------8<---------------
> cat test.tex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is a test 123
\end{document}

> pdflatex test
pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file /usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updm
ap/pdftex.map): ambiguous entry for `laui2986': font file present but not inclu
ded, will be treated as font file not present
*** Signal 11
(and similar errors repeated many times)
-----------8<---------------

This error was the sole reason for merging TEXMFSYSCONFIG into TEXMFMAIN.

% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$
TEXMFDIST}

The search paths look OK to me, but then I am no expert. I cannot
check if splitting out texmf-var works (for pscyr) with this error in
the way.

To put it shortly, I am very confused at this point.

Discovery,

---8<---
> kpsewhere pdftex.map
/usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
---8<---

removing /usr/local/share/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
resolves that particular issue, but pscyr fonts are not found because
I deleted th map they are in!

Also I notice that setting TEXMF to:
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$T
EXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

(Added a !!$TEXMFHOME), also fixes my simple example, but will not
find pscyr fonts .

If I remove the texmf one and use the texmf-var one, then all works
fine, so I believe that
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map is the map
for running texlive off the cd, incorrectly copied onto my system by
the package.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.0.999.0708222240330.14535@hahepc1.hahe>

Hi,

seems the lowering of the E in \TeX is somehow inconsistent, e. g. in
LaTeX it's 0.5em whereas in ltugboat.cls and cwebmac.tex it's 0.424em.
This shows up when using \XeTeX in ltugboat class, please see example
below, i tried a kludge which adapts to whatever the lowering is:

\documentclass{ltugboat}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\makeatletter
\def\modXeTeX{\leavevmode
  \tubhideheight{\hbox{X%
    \setbox0=\hbox{\TeX}\setbox1=\hbox{E}%
    \lower\dp0\hbox{\raise\dp1\hbox{\kern-.125em\tubreflect{E}}}%
    \kern-.1667em \TeX}}}
\makeatother

\begin{document}
\XeTeX \modXeTeX
\end{document}

What's right?

Funny.

	svn update Master

did not give me Master/tlpkg, but

	svn update Master/tlpkg

did. Maybe a svn version mismatch between my client and TUG's server?

Hi Hartmut,

    seems the lowering of the E in \TeX is somehow inconsistent, e. g. in

Strange.

    LaTeX it's 0.5em whereas in ltugboat.cls and cwebmac.tex it's 0.424em.

(You mean ex, not em.)  In plain.tex, it's also .5ex.  Which makes me
think it should be .5.  I do not know how the .424 came about.  Robin
(or Barbara), any idea?

In any case, your change to \XeTeX seems like a good idea no matter what.
Thanks.

Seems that there is something wrong with pdftex on your platform.
Whatever you have in your map file, pdftex shouldn't crash with signal~11. 

I don't know whether signal numbers are unique on different UNIX
systems, but if this is the case, signal 11 means "segmentation fault".

This should be fixed.  A program producing segmentation faults is very
unsafe because it's then also very easy to produce stack overflows.
This is a ***big*** security hole.

Can you provide a minimal set of files which allows to re-produce the
problem?

IMO, this is a ***very big*** problem.  If you use pdftex on your web
server in order to create pdf files on-the-fly and the content of an
arbitrary \input file can produce a segmentaion fault or even a stack
overflow, then there is definitely something wrong.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Remember it's the OpenBSD packages system which installed this under

from my changelog:

Thu Apr 25 00:55:55 1996  robin  (robin at dosmachine)

        * tugboat.dtx (subsection{Messing about with the \LaTeX{} logo}): New
         section, with potential for discrimination on the placement of that
         troublesome `A' according to the font in use; also defines a
         \DeclareLaTeXLogo command for the curious user (users are, by
         definition, curious, after all) to try out parameters of hir own
        (subsection{Abbreviations and logos}): rearrange the comment about
         redefining \LaTeX under LaTeX, to conform with the new reality...

so i guess the parameters were chosen using my code that produces test
sheets; the aim being to produce something that "looks good".

which was back when i though these bumpy-road logos could *ever* look
good...  (istm that the original was by way of being a demonstration
... "i do this because tex _can_, and all these improbable sheep --
leslie, for goodness' sake -- have followed on, making ever more silly
variants and developments of the logo, up to today's situation where
reading anything about tex is really rather stressful because the
baselines are so wobbly.)

fwiw, if you want me to remove that code (including your definition of
latex for bitstream charter), i'll do it like a shot.  the worse the
logos look, the sooner people will stop using them, imo ... now.
 
> In any case, your change to \XeTeX seems like a good idea no matter what.

hmm.  the logo is the only truly bad thing about xetex, imo...

Isn't a seg fault the system detecting a buffer overflow and therefore
shutting the process down?

Yes, if you have a spare box for an OpenBSD install?

Hang on,

Lets tackle this one stage at a time.

What is this error trying to tell me?

pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file /usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/p
dftex.map): ambiguous entry for `ftxro6a': font file present but not included,
will be treated as font file not present
}] (./test.aux) )

There is 1 font entry in 1 map, and 1 font under that name in the
texmf tree. Why is it reported ambiguous?.

from the little one can deduce from that, one might be forgiven for
assuming that it's a repeat of my note in baskerville (and possibly also
tugboat, i don't remember) where i showed a mechanism for getting the
latex logo to look right in different font families.

i would never present such a thing at a meeting ... i'm a hopeless
public speaker.

I have an OBSD box, so this shouldn't be a problem.
Please start a bug report for pdftex at sarovar; the list of files
used by pdftex can be found with -recorder.

You have a map line with a font file (which is only useful if the font
file is to be included), but you don't want to include the font file,
so pdftex ignores the file name. Probably missing a "<"...

This doesn't look like a valid map line for pdftex.

It has run a recent developer snapshot, so vmware / qemu is probably
better in this instance?

Oddly, if I tell the pscyr map NOT to enable the maps, then everything
works and all the errors go away. Maybe the ambiguity is the entries
in pscyr.map + the entries in pdftex.map? I don't know enough about
how fonts work to comment.

Martin, do you know where to get the pscyr fonts from? I can send you
a tarball. Is it the seg fault you are interested in repro-ing?

pscyr is not on CTAN or TL, so no. And yes, I'm interested in the
segfault. tarball is ok.

Hi.
 See below:

List of questions (I'm new to any maintenance of Latex)

1) I've downloaded and installed Live-TEX. Where do I put the
   bidi package ? Should I put the 'bidi.dtx' and 'bidi.sty' files
   at the same path they appear at CTAN and run 'texconfig-sys' ?
    ( what is the difference between texconfig and texconfig-sys ?)

2) As far as I can see Ezra SIL comes without instructions how to
   install it on linux/unix (I have SUSE 10.2 at home). Can someone
   point me to good reference explaining how fonts on *unix work and
   how Latex and Ghostscript tools interact with them ?
   - How do I install fonts
   - suppose XeTeX will use system fonts. But will ghostscript tools
     (like ps2pdf) see them? I had negative experience with 'culmus'
    fonts, so I need information how to cause things work.

3) How do I know which fonts do I have on system and how do I supply them
   to XeTeX ? This is what I see on my system:

$ fc-list | grep -i heb
$ xlsfonts | grep -i heb
heb6x13
heb8x13
$ 


Thank you.

Subject: [tex-live] Matching TL package setups to my own
Message-ID: <24532.159.46.248.233.1187879506.squirrel@mail.rna.nl>

TL distribution is currently organized like a tree with objects. There are
the following categories:
- Documentation
- TLCore
- Package
- Collection
- Scheme
However, these categegories are just names, the structure of all these is
essentially the same (TLPOBJ). The basic idea (as I can gather) however is
- Schemes are made up of collections and may depend on other schemes
- Collections are made up of packages and may depend on other collections
- Packages (Documentation, TLCore and Package) may depend on other
packages and contain lists of files to include.

But this is not enforced. Scheme-gust and scheme-tetex for instance depend
on both Collections and Packages directly. It is also no problem to add
files to a scheme or collection directly and in fact
collection-langcyrillic has files. Hence, while Package CJK and Collection
collection-langcyrillic both have files and dependencies, one is a Package
and the other a Collection.

I have been thoroughly confused by all of this. This has made it time and
again for me impossible to quickly implement TL structure support for my
OS X installer. This installer has a very simple setup: there are chunks
(these contain files) and there are sets of chunks. I need to improve on
that, but TL's structure is not a logical basis for that and creating
something usable would mean ad hoc implementations based on knowledge not
on structure and any future change would render the solution probably
invalid, resulting in high maintenance levels for the installation.

I would like to propose a change for TL structuring such that relation and
use are enforced and thus installers need no special knowledge but can
rely on structural information in the TLPDB.

First, my suggestion would be to drop theb difference between schemes and
collections. Just have collections. collection-tetex is just another
subset of TL (but see below for schemes).

I would also drop the difference between TLCore, Package and
Documentation. After all, while it is true that TLCore should go to texmf,
Package to texmf-dist and Documentation to texmf-doc this information is
also already there in the file lists. Hence, I could currently easily put
a texmf-dist/foo/bar file in a TLCore package and it would just work.
Having these three categories *and* the subdir info in the setup is
redundant. Having them also not enforced by structure is a possible source
of confusion.

In other words, I would like to simplify matters.

I think we have in fact just one thing (as reflected in TLPOBJ), a TL
'object'. This needs a useful name and 'collection' would do. Subset would
do as well. Maybe something better could be found.

Collection-langcyrillic would then be a TL subset the same way CJK is a
subset.

We could still tag the subsets with properties. Scheme could be such a
property. A scheme would mean that it is a high level subset that is
proposed to be user-selectable in some sort of installer at the 'overall'
level. Instead of Schemes and Collections we would have collections only,
but some of which would count as user-selectable high level installs.

I was also wondering if all subsets should have complete dependencies.
Take current Package CJK. It does not depend on collection-latex. But
without latex it is unsuable. It seems currently, many packages have a
status of "Addition" with an underlying (and thus external
responsibility). I think it would be better if CJK would depend on
collection-latex.

Furthermore, I think it would be good to have some sort of version
checking for dependencies. The new beamer may depend on a newer version of
pgf. Suppose the newer version of pgf is not available, an installer
should have to refuse to install beamer unless pgf was the last version.
Given the state of TeX contributions, these versioning should be set up in
the TLP setup (and hopefully migrate back to maintained contributions).

This is all 'thought in progress', but this is the third time I have been
looking into building my redistribution on the basis of TL structure
instead of the rather rough and unintelligent way my stuff is now put into
subsets.

indeed; that's a line coming from pscyr2.map, and is supposed to be
used only with dvipdfm.

Edd told us:

  The port runs the following commands after installation:
  mktexlsr > /dev/null 2>&1
  updmap-sys --quiet --nomkmap --enable Map=pscyr.map
  updmap-sys --quiet --enable Map=pscyr2.map

It is wrong to enable pscyr2.map in this way. The port is broken.

But besides fixing the pscyr port, please fix the segfault which is
another problem...

It doesn't segfault on Linux or OBSD4.0/i386, and I have send Ed a
possible patch. But the mapfile parsing of pdftex is not bullet-proof
and probably won't be unless it's completely rewritten (which is
unlikely to happen, since luatex won't need map files for OpenType
fonts).

Adding "!!" here is not a good idea, there is a very good reason why
the default settings are as they are.

The "!!" in front of TEXMFHOME and TEXMFVAR had been removed
deliberately because it was a source of confusion.

Do you have an ls-R file in TEXMFHOME?  Probably not (unless you added
TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS).  If my assumption is true then there is
probably a file in TEXMFHOME which cannot be found any more.  And if
things work better now, this file is probably broken.

I do not recommend to change too many variables in texmf.cnf.  The
standard setup should work.  

The kpathsea manual (texmf/doc/info/kpathsea.info) describes some
debugging variables you can set (section 2.6.3).

  Reinhard

The system cannot detect buffer overflows.  A segmentation fault is
raised when an additional memory page is needed.  The system doesn't
know what your program does with the memory pages it already assigned
to your process.

And the buffer-overflow exploits usually succeed before a new memory
page is needed.  See also:

Subject: [tex-live] Copying symbolic links to Windows
Message-ID: <20070823214817.GA16908@mail.potis.org>

I am having some difficulty with symbolic links. I have included 
TeX Live 2007 on a DVD (statlive.org) which is designed to be a 
cross-platform integrated development environment which has been 
well received at conferences this summer. In principle, it would 
be nice if the directory containing the necessary files could be 
copied onto a PC hard drive (effectively installing the GNU operating 
system user experience without the kernel) and back onto removable
media from such a hard drive. 

The problem is, to maintain the cross-platform feature and to 
avoid the need for an installer, I need to copy Linux and OSX
symbolic links (for example, those in the TeXLive2007/bin/*-darwin 
directories).

On some PCs, I can do this (I am at a Windows XP pc where I just did), and 
on others, I cannot (e.g. a brand new, off the shelf, Windows Vista laptop
and a Windows Server 2003). Unzipping a zip archive containing such links
also fails, even on the PC where I can copy the links. It seems to be 
an issue with permissions or security settings of some sort. If someone 
who has already payed the price of learning the intricacies of Windows could 
suggest where I could look to learn how such symbolic links 
(not the new Vista symbolic links, unless the procedure is the same) can 
be handled, I would be very grateful.

Hi Gerben,

    The basic idea (as I can gather) however is

Right, basically.

    Scheme-gust and scheme-tetex for instance depend
    on both Collections and Packages directly. 

That's normal and unavoidable.

    collection-langcyrillic has files. 

That I'm surprised about.  I'll change it.

    there are chunks (these contain files) 

Sounds like TL packages.

    and there are sets of chunks.

Sounds like TL collections and schemes.  If you want to call them
"subsets", go right ahead.

If it'll help you if we rigorously enforce that collections (or
"subsets") don't have files themselves, that's ok by me.

    this information is also already there in the file lists.

But the way that information *gets* into the (autogenerated) file lists
is by having the category in the (hand-maintained) .tlpsrc file.  

I can agree it is not theoretically necessary.  The tlpdb generator
could, in principle, search all texmf* trees for the package info.  I
would like to have our packages be able to cross the texmf boundaries,
it would be very helpful for things like perltex, but I am highly unsure
as to what will be affected.  It's never been done that way before, and
would need to be tested before we make such a sweeping change.

    I think we have in fact just one thing (as reflected in TLPOBJ), 

Since we have TLPOBJ now, I don't exactly see what you're proposing
that's different.  A different way of thinking about it, I guess.

    We could still tag the subsets with properties. 

So, if you like, think of the "category" field as a property of the
TLPOBJ.  Since, as you point out, there are presently no rigorous checks
for the different "levels", they are in fact already all equal, it seems
to me.

    I was also wondering if all subsets should have complete dependencies.
    ...
    version checking for dependencies. 

I don't disagree in principle with either of these ideas, but I know of
no way to implement them.  Dependency information is simply not
available.  Often the authors themselves don't even know which versions
are compatible with which other versions, and certainly no one else
does.

    I think it would be better if CJK would depend on collection-latex.

I don't mind adding that particular dependency.  I can see that that one
could make a difference in practice.

As things stand, I have simply continued Sebastian's practice of adding
dependencies when told about important ones.

Best,
K

Karl, sorry, but I totally agree with Gerben and I doubt that it's
unavoidable.  It is very difficult to write an installer if a scheme
or collection can contain arbitrary stuff.

It would be nice if a scheme is just a set of collections.  Everything
would be significantly easier if there would be collections like
collection-tetex, collection-gust, or collection-xml which contain all
the required packages.

The fact that schemes contain packages is very nasty indeed.

What Gerben asks for is to provide a reasonable structure.  I totally
agree with him.  What we have at the moment is horrible.

Karl, if things will remain as messy as they are, I doubt that anybody
is able to provide a reasonable installer before TL-2008 will be released.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I think horrible is too hard a word. There are a *lot* of very nice  
things that has been produced. But now that I am actually trying to  
use it I run into stuff.

Here is another one: depends in a TLPOBJ are of the form "Package/ 
foo" or "TLCore/bar". To use that name to get the actual TLPOBJ I  
need to strip the first part.

                 $tlpkgname =~ s/^(Package|TLCore|Documentation| 
Scheme|Collection)\///;
		my $tlpkg = $tlpdb->get_package( $tlpkgname);

I am throwing stuff away but without any ill effect. I do not need it.

What this implies is that we do not have a clear idea about the name  
space it is a mix of assumptions. E.g. is tlpkg name is unique, we do  
not need categories. But if it isn't, then the interface to get a  
package from a db should include category.

I don't care either way, we could have
- object name unique TL-wide, directory information in the list of  
files, no directory-implication in the categories, depends on the  
basis of name
- object name in combination with category unique (category stands  
for a directory like texmf, texmf-doc, etc.), file list without  
subdirectory information, depends on the basis of category and name

As it is now, there is a bit of both assumptions in the setup.

As there is above all redundancy, I guess it will work as is. But  
maintaining it will be more work than with a clean structure.

No, my current stupid setup is not as rich. No dependencies for  
instance. It is just a set of file, nothing more.

Again, no dependencies. Anyway, my current limited setup is not what  
this is about. I wanted to follow TL more.

But they are there *and* the category is there.

OK. I am working from the TLPDB object as my starting point.

My feeling is that at the package level, it is not a big deal. In  
fact it is already the case. What about a collection or package in  
category Package that depends on something in TLCore? Expand it and  
you'll install stuff in texmf and texmf-dist.

Crossing boundaries is already the case. What you need to decide is  
name space uniqueness for TLPOBJ names.

No. See my other reply. But also here: Given that a Scheme, a  
Collection, a Package, a TLCore and a Documentation thingy all are in  
fact a TLPOBJ they are already functionally the same. Hence the  
direct files in the langcyrillic collection. It is only a collection  
in the eye of the beholder, IT-design wise all  these things are now  
equivalent.

Yes, that was my point. Categories are now used for two things I think:
- where should stuff go (texmf, texmf-doc, etc)
- how is it to be presented to the user (packages or schemes or  
collections)
and it offers a start for non-unique pkg names in different  
directories (though this is not complete as the categories are not  
used in the perl interface to access items)
Anyway, I think having something that stands for "where things should  
go" is nice, because it offers people to use TL as input but organize  
it slightly different (e.g. I could say that Packages go to  
texmf.texlive-dist and have my own texmf.gwtex-dist additions next to  
it).

That is the right way. I think TL could be the repositpry of the  
dependencies and they are not very volatile so easy to maintain.

Remark: For TL itself these things are not very important. After all  
install sh can have specific knowledge which complements what is in  
the TLPKG info.

But as a source for other distributions (think MikTeX, gwTeX) it is  
not possible to rely on the information hidden in shell scripts of  
TL. So, something being a scheme should mean that it is something the  
use can select to install and get some sort of complete setup for a  
particular purpose (e.g. a scheme-context if you are not interested  
in LaTeX).

Anyway, I think the basic ideas in what has been produced are not all  
that evil. But they are not orthogonal.

I'll see if I can come up with some ideas.

Hi,

I think the errors I am receiving re: ambigouous fonts / segfault is
caused by a corrupted pdftex map file generated by updmap-sys.

I have 2 pdftex maps in place:

Are you sure? A quick Google search suggested that before Vista
symlinks or junctions were available only for directories, and hard
links for files.

sysinternals.com has tools for manipulating junctions; see under
File & Disk Utilities.

By the way. It makes me mad that Microsoft bitches about their
intellectual property whereas they keep adopting more Unix features,
implicitly admitting that all along Unix was right and they were
wrong. So their intellectual property mainly cover botched solutions
to problems that were already solved right in Unix. Sorry for the

iirc, symlinks were covered by an at&t patent, which m$
couldn't/wouldn't negotiate around.

if i'm right, the existence of symlinks in vista would indicate a patent
expiry rather than any admission of guilt.

m$ are guilty as hell, in the patent arena, themselves -- they patent
the most preposterous things, all common (published) knowledge, and rely
on the feebleness of the patent review system for software to get their
patents accepted.

however, this case is probably one of the biter bit...

Surely criticism would be justified/justifiable only if Microsoft
/refused/ to accept that anyone could have better ideas than them ?

I once worked for a company within which it was strictly forbidden
to consider any idea that "the competition" had come up with, and
that is one of the main reasons that I left that company.

Thank you Siep,
I should be more precise: the objects which function as links in Linux
and OSX need to be copied to a volume under Windows in a way such
that they can be re-copied to removable media and function as
ordinary links once that removable media is mounted in OSX, for example.

They need not function as links in Windows, and in the case I describe
as success above, they do not. They just appear as small files. I will
test again to be sure. The key is that they should not block copying a
directory to the hard drive, which they do in the failure cases, and
that they should be present as links, not duplicate copies, once on a
Unix-like operating system again.

    Another circular dependency: bin-wordcount and wordcount

Strange though it is, I'm not sure circular dependencies are an error.
I don't see any other way to express it.

The better fix would be to have one package "wordcount" that includes
the bin-wordcount stuff, but like I said, that is something that
requires experimentation and work.

    More stuff:

Thanks, I'll fix those.  Unless something is holding you up, you don't
actually need to report these -- I just haven't run the consistency
checks in a while, and I can't feasibly guarantee that all the tlp stuff
in development is always consistent.

    My feeling is that at the package level, it is not a big deal. 

My concern is whether the installer, the package updater, etc., do the
right thing.  There's no way to know that except to try, and I just
can't put that experiment at the top of my list.

    What you need to decide is name space uniqueness for TLPOBJ names.

All names are supposed to be unique now!  Independent of category.

    Categories are now used for two things I think:
    - where should stuff go (texmf, texmf-doc, etc)
    - how is it to be presented to the user (packages or schemes or  
    collections)

That is true, and I agree they are not orthogonal ideas.  I don't think
the current situation does any great harm once the above is understood,
though.

Best,
k

Hi all,

Unfortunately I am back to net-reality only for a short time, but a few
comments:

First of all, the new infrastructure is new, so changes can make sense,
but should be well proposed.

But with all the proposals and discussions we should keep in mind that
many of the things in the new infra were created like they are because
we want to be able to keep the current installers in case we don't get a
new one. We cannot be sure that we have a new installer, and now we can
just create the list files and be sure (hope!!!) that the installer will
work.

Since schemes and collections are maintained by hand, all this stuff can
easily done in the tlpsrc files. Enforcing can be implemented easily in
the perl modules, if we want it.

My heart does not hang on schemes at all, I never took a look at them.

BUT KEEP THE FOLLOWING IN MIND:
- Every package/file is in EXACTELY ONE (!!!) collection
- but can be contained in many schemes.

So collections are disjoint subsets of all texlive files, whose union
should be ALL files in texlive, 

while schemes make up not necessarily disjoint subsets.


So there IS a difference

In fact I proposed that we drop the texmf/texmf-dist/texmf-doc etc part
to make it relocatable, but this is also a bad idea due to other
reasons.

But this doesn't make it simpler. Or do you have a format and an
implementation at hand?

Impossible, as Karl answered. We try to cope with most important deps,
but this has never been completely right, and probably will never be.

Karl answered this, impossible.

Thanks Karl.

And with me too, in fact I didn't know that there are files directly
listed in collections ...

They CAN, trivially. Just add respective patterns or files into the
tlpsrc... nothing is enforcing us now to keep the boundaries.

I would prefer to have the bin-stuff remaining ...

As said, I really much agree if we can boil down that collections do NOT
contain direct files, but only depend on other collections and include
packages. What schemes are doing I don't care ;-) but I guess that they
either should depend only on collections ...

Yes.

Yes.

Well, it is not that bad. I guess we can clean up the (few?) wrong cases
quite fast.

A quick check showed that:
- under all the collections there is only collection-langcyrillic
  containing runpatterns

- on the schemes side there are only scheme-gust, scheme-tetex, and
  scheme-xml depending on non-collections.

AND: I see that it makes sense to have package dependencies in the
schemese, especially when we talk about documentation stuff, which is
separated into language collections, so picking out single packages for
some schemes would make sense.

There are not that messy, if the installer would collect simple
Package(s) it would work, taking aside the wrong occurrences of
patterns/files in collections-langcyrillic.

As said I see a use of including single packages in schemes, and that
cannot be too bad to be implemented.

Yes, true, but we still need this information for now since for the
generation of list files in case we have to use the old installer.

True that we can even generated this information because up to now
package names are unique across ALL trees, so if someone calls for
"foobar" we just check the category of this item. In fact the infra is
laid out so that packages across the whole tree HAVE to be unique!

Subject: [tex-live] obsolete Latin hyphenation files
Message-ID: <1188077963.8079.17.camel@localhost>

Hi there,

[I'm not subscribed to the list.]

I have discovered just accidentally that the Latin hyphenation and
definition files (lahyph.tex and latin.ldf) contained in the SVN
repository are older than the ones contained in CTAN.

I don't know whether other related files should be updated also, but
hyphenation patterns for Latin show be updated to avoid wrong
hyphenations and the definition file should also be updated to avoid
some errors.

BTW, I don't know how the SVN repository is updated: only for bugfixes,
for any new release on CTAN or only with programs? I wonder because I'm
using a SVN version that includes a devel version of XeTeX (but maybe
the devel code is placed in TeXLive SVN repository).

Thanks for your excellent work,


Pablo

Well, in fact I don't mind, or I don't know. There is one thing which
might be of interest namely to know where binaries (actual compiled
binaries) are located. But this is not that important.

I agree, yes, the splitting creates more pain quite often then win. But
the restructuring should be done in mind that we have cross tree
packages (what I don't consider a problem ...)

Thanks for the news.  Will the 2008 update also contain clarifications
of the amslatex license itself[1], or will that not be sorted out in

Thanks for your work,

[1] as we discussed earlier, the main license text has ambiguous wording

Which, "of course", has the effect that trivfloat is not availabe in
Debian: We create the filelists from collections.  I wonder whether it's
available in an installed texlive system, or only on the live DVD?

neither: it post-dates the creation of the current tex-live.  hence the
confusion, i imagine -- it's been put in the repository, but not until
this run been subjected to the sort of checks that go on before the
product is "made".

package foo:

Of course if foo-bin below again has dependencies you still can have  
circular dependencies.

It is therefore I think better to have items (which may not have  
dependencies but also cannot be installed/selected separately) and  
sets (which may depend on other sets and items)

set foo:
	depend item foo-bin
	depend item foo-run
set bar:
	depend set foo
	depend item bar-run
and then not allow circular dependencies in of sets. Anyway, that way  
you cannot get foo-bin without foo-run and v.v. but you also do not  
have nasty circular dependencies.

Anyway, I think one should better have leafs (stuff below which you  
do not *allow* dependencies) and which are the only ones who may  
contain files.

In simple cases this would mean you will have sets of one item. E.g.

set trivfloat
	depend item trivfloat-files

Stuff like execute should then only exist at set level (you only *do*  
things if you have everything needed.

Maybe I should explain what I am trying to do and what this (imo)  
means for this stuff in TL

My current redistribution packs up a part of TL's Master tree  
in .tar.bz2 files to be downloaded by i-Installer (chunks). These  
chunks can be rather large. E.g. a subset of TL's texmf-dist  
corresponing to the former teTeX texmf tree + what I used to add to  
that from TL. To make it possible for the user to minimize the  
download/footprint I do not pack the texmf*/source stuff and I split  
the texmf-dist tree in a chunk containing the  selections from texmf- 
dist/doc, texmf-dist/tex, texmf-dist/ftonts and the rest of my  
selection from texmf-dist. I do this so that if only a package in tex/ 
latex changes, the whole fonts business does not need to be  
downloaded again when the i-Package is updated. I also separate doc  
for the rest as you do not need doc to run TeX.

This is rather coarse and I have been wanting to make this far more  
finegrained. For that I only have one source I could possibly use:  
TLP. That means that my chunks should become based on the tlp's in  
TL, so I need to write a (perl) program to take TLP as input and  
produce the basics of an i-Package.

I still want the user to be able to select something high-level, like  
scheme-tetex.
I want the use to be able to select collections and packages
I want the user to be able to choose to not install doc or source  
until needed (which is almost never)
And most certainly I want the build process from TLP to i-Package to  
be automatic. If too much hand fiddling is required there is no way I  
can keep that up.

So, in the end the TLP structure must have enough information to  
create the behaviour of the installer. The whole setup then becomes  
data-driven, which is the important point. install.sh can do  
installation on that basis, but so can the i-Package (and others) and  
it is both based on the same information in TLP.

Circular dependencies are problematic for that kind of automation  
because they make parsing the stuff too complex. It is also not  
needed. Multiple texmf trees is OK (I am in favour of splitting the  
stuff that is generated by make world in Build (which should go into  
texmf) from the stuff that is maintained otherwise (which goes into  
texmf-dist and texmf-doc).

(I had to stop writing this message and could only come back to it  
after a day or two, so the whole thing is not very coherent).

Message-ID: <200708262228.l7QMSuv23831@f7.net>

Hi Pablo,

    I have discovered just accidentally that the Latin hyphenation and
    definition files (lahyph.tex and latin.ldf) contained in the SVN
    repository are older than the ones contained in CTAN.

Thanks.  Regarding lahyph.tex, it was updated after the TL07 release,
and I didn't notice (hyphenation files are difficult).  I'll update that.

Regarding latin.ldf, isn't it part of Babel?  I don't see any specific
latin.ldf on CTAN, and the Babel on CTAN and the Babel in TL are the
same, as far as I know.

    I don't know whether other related files should be updated also, 

If you know of other files I should check, please tell me.

    BTW, I don't know how the SVN repository is updated: only for bugfixes,
    for any new release on CTAN or only with programs? 

In principle, any package update on CTAN should be reflected in the TL
svn repo.  Put another way, discrepancies between CTAN and TL are what
we're trying to eliminate.  (Tons of historical discrepancies remain,
but new updates on CTAN should be reflected in TL.)

Programs are harder, requiring much much more time to update than
TeX/MP/whatever packages.  In general, I do not attempt to update
program sources in svn before we are on the path to a release.

    I wonder because I'm using a SVN version that includes a devel
    version of XeTeX (but maybe the devel code is placed in TeXLive SVN
    repository).

In the particular case of XeTeX, Jonathan updates the sources in TL
"from time to time".  I'm not exactly sure how he decides :).

Thanks,
k

What I can do is make a qemu(virtual machine) image (for i386) in
which you can reproduce the error. I would be very grateful if someone
could take a look.

Atleast then, no spare machines / disks are needed and I can sent an
exact replica of a machine creating the faulty maps.

Incase you're not familiar with qemu:

Thanks for your reply and the update of the Latin hyphenation file.

Sorry, I guess the files to be updated are latin.ins and latin.dtx, but
these are still to be uploaded to CTAN. Claudio Beccari sent those files
to Johannes Bramms  and are waiting for his approval.

I hope it helps. Thanks for your work,

That sounds very much like the goals we try to follow with Debian
TeXLive packages.

> scheme-tetex.
> I want the use to be able to select collections and packages

We decided that for Debian, only collections (and some special "schemes"
similar to scheme-tetex) can be selected, not individual packages.  But
that's only because of, let's say internal, Debian-specific problems.

> I want the user to be able to choose to not install doc or source
> until needed (which is almost never)

Hm, I'd rather say in the parentheses "which should be almost always",
because without installed documentation people start googling (and
finding outdated/wrong advice) instead of reading, but we also want to
provide the option not to install docs.  Note, however, that some
packages require to be distributed as a whole - so installing the docs
should at least be the default.

Definitely, just as creating Debian packages from TLP.

Sorry that I can't comment on the technical details at the moment.

Actually I was more thinking along the lines of people who have all  
the books. Kopka, Mittelbach, etc.

Packages that *require* to be distributed as a whole are somewhat  
imperialistic. Recommend, I can live with. ;-)

    So, in the end the TLP structure must have enough information to  
    create the behaviour of the installer. 

I think they do right now.  What you're describing is exactly what we
have always intended to do too in a new version of the installer (and
the current installer does them already, except package-level selection,
which I don't think would pose any real technical problem, just ui
headaches).  All of the options you describe can be supported with what
we have now, as far as I can see.

I still don't really see why circular dependencies are "too complex",
but fine, whatever.  I'll just delete one of them.  Package-level
dependencies are pretty much random and meaningless anyway, as we've
discussed.

I don't understand your "set" and "item" proposal, sorry.  I mean, I
understand (I think) what you're saying, but I don't see what this
rather large reorganization buys us, in practice, over what we have now.

I don't mean to be obstreperous or resistant to good ideas.  I just
don't understand why what we have now does not suffice for you.

If we split "Category" into two different attributes, say
  Category -> Package / Collection / Scheme
  Location -> TLCore / TLPackage / TLDoc
would your situation improve?

With the ultimate intention of getting rid of Location for sure -- maybe
I am being too cautious and it is not really any problem at all.
(Actually, if we did this, I would start by not having Location and
seeing if any problems arose.)

Regarding the license info for utopia, I added the {README,LICENSE}*.txt

One thing I'm wondering about is where the tfm/vf's on CTAN came from.
Does anyone know if there are fontinst sources floating around

It also seems a bit wrong for utopia.map to be part of psnfss, but

If you have dependencies, it is good to either have them full blown  
or not have them at all. I think one should have them full blown, it  
makes for a far better setup and for less difficulties for the user.

At some level transformation (=use of TLP) becomes too complex to  
maintain, that is my main problem. If it is not pure/clean it is also  
likely to be less predictable and that also leads to more maintenance  
in the long run.

Having a purer setup with leafs (or items, contains actual files) and  
sets (anything above) makes it far easier in the long run to do  
maintenance.

I would keep Location because as it is you do want to be able to tell  
where stuff should go (texmf, texmf-dist, texmf-doc) unless you want  
to have everything in just one tree: texmf.

Having logical names for locations (which should be found in a driver  
file so they can change) enables you to rearrange locations later  
without changing the TLP stuff. It also would enable users of TLP to  
more easily have different names, e.g. where in my dist texmf-dist is  
called texmf.texlive to make clear what the source of my dist is.

BTW I find texmf-tldoc or tl-doc better names than texmf-doc. As it  
is now, texmf/doc and texmf-doc suggest they are about the same thing.

Wrt category, I think having pure leafs and non-leafs in the tree is  
the main thing, but having labels for what you want the user select  
at what level (package, scheme, collection) is of course a good thing.

Thanks,

G

Have a look at the work Ed did for OpenBSD; this should be esay to
adapt for FreeBSD. Search the TeXlive archives. :-)

Hi,

We appear to be cross posting here guys. I don't know how it is in the
TeX community, but some people get very upset by this. Is this
allowed?

> Surprise: This has already been done. Linux does it, OpenBSD does it.
> Again: Study the OpenBSD port.

Yes, I did have to split it down, so that the minimal "tetex like"
distribution could go on the OpenBSD cdrom. There is a python script
which can help split TL down and also a large document describing how
TeXLive can be ported to OpenBSD, which I wrote because I knew the
other BSD's could benefit from my findings.

Also a company has sponsored the OpenBSD port and I have some more
recent sparc64 hardware on it's way, meaning that I should be able to
test some more recent TL snapshots on sparc64 ready for the 2008
release, hopefully minimising portlag.

Unfortunately I am stuck in a rut with tl2007. An annoying bug
regarding updmap-sys creating dvi maps instead of pdftex maps when
TEXMFSYSVAR is not merged with TEXMFMAIN. If anyone on either lists
knows how this could happen or is willing to help look into it, pease
drop me a mail (I can make qemu images of an OpenBSD dev snapshot with
these symptoms). I have a patch to try, but I don't think it is
related, so I think I am stuck.

Thanks

Edd, from your last message, I gathered it was related to your
installer, not to TL itself.

(Plus, the whole thing seemed to be about nonfree fonts that are part of

Yes I was testing pscyrillic fonts, and had trouble and have traced it
back to this.

This is the licensing information that the pscyr port has in our
packages system:
# Free redistribution is permitted without fonts files modifications
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM=   "may not sell"
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP=     Yes
PERMIT_DISTFILES_CDROM= "may not sell"
PERMIT_DISTFILES_FTP=   Yes

If a variable is not equal to Yes then it is not permitted. In this
case you may only install the package from ftp mirrors.

Program updates are usually done just before release is closing in. They
are too much pain to be done 4 times within a release cycle.
Furthermore, there is nobody building binaries anyway ...

Karl will probably answer, too.

pdftex 1.40.5 is in Build/source. The problem is building binaries for
all platforms.

I am slowly working to a Mac OS X release of current Build/source. It  
would be nice to have metapost 1.000 too.

Actually my builds in the past immediately had a rather wide audience  
which provided a decent bit of testing. That is advantageous for TL  
as well.

No problem. Martin is looking at this for me right now, so when we

    Yes I was testing pscyrillic fonts, and had trouble and have traced it
    back to this.

I'm not sure what that means.

I am as sure as I can be that updmap-sys does not, in general, create
"dvi maps instead of pdftex maps when TEXMFSYSVAR is not merged with
TEXMFMAIN".  That is the default configuration.

If you think there is a problem with the upstream TL, can you please
tell me how to reproduce it from scratch using the original sources and
installer, not something related to your port's installation?

    This is the licensing information that the pscyr port has in our
    packages system:

Yeah, in other words, nonfree.

Best,
Karl

Hi Gerben, hi Karl, hi all,

I am back for one week, and have read through the emails but I honestly
cannot make sense from all what is going round.

Let's put it this way: Gerben, if you can come up with a nice proposal
how to change it, that is
- so detailed that it can be implemented (or even better you implement
  the perl modules)
- allows to continue to generate list files as they are used with the
  current installer
- work with the ctan2tl/place scripts (or provide replacements)
we will happily dicuss/incorporate the stuff. But IMHO the current level
of discussion is too abstract as to give as any real gain, any real
prgress. We cannot discuss on this level forever, because we have to
care for releases. What is needed is a clear proposal with clear
transition explanation/procedure.

None of us can and will implement something we not even understand
completely.

But again, I am definitely open to change stuff, even in a profound way,
but I need reasoning.

To come back to what I wrote before: there are only very few collections
containing files, the distinction between collections and schemes I have
explained, and the few things which were strange we tried to fix. So
please tell me first what is now the problem.

Best wishes

Norbert
