Subject: [tex-live] hyphenation exceptions for US English
Message-ID: <20071102.155516.110521654.wl@gnu.org>


A longer time ago I've written a small perl script (hyphenex.pl) to
automatically extract a hyphenation exception file from Barbara's log
file which gets published from time to time in TUGBoat.  For
convenience, I've attached it here.  I think it should be added to
TeXLive.

There is one small detail missing: the license.  Barbara?

    I think it should be added to TeXLive.

I agree, but we should include it in a tugboat directory on CTAN first.

    There is one small detail missing: the license.  Barbara?

Barbara is away for a few more days and I'm sure will be swamped for a
while upon her return.

My personal preference for the exception list would be for a simple
all-permissive license, for instance:

Copyright 2007 TeX Users Group.
You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this file.


Thanks,

Why on earth would you want to permit modification ?
A TeX document should typeset identically on any
TeX system in the world; once you allow variant
hyphenation exceptions, you throw that basic
premiss out of the window :-(

No, you don't. There may well be different versions of a file
compiling differently. You have to make sure which version to use if
you want to produce identical output. If you don't allow for
modifications no one will be able to improve it in the future...

You are apparently misunderstanding what we are talking about.  The
hyphenation exception file won't be inluded by default into the format
file but can be added on the user's will with a call to \input.

I keep getting this. What is the correct way?

I did `diff -u oldfile newfile`.

Message-ID: <1194203909.11291.1219480491@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I have just installed my first linux system (ubuntu 7.10) on a dual boot
with WinXP.

I already have a full TeX installation under WinXP (MikTeX), including a
full set of style files.  I have installed TeX Live on the linux
partition.  When I seek, under linux, to compile a .tex file none of the
style files are recognised.

I presume that the problem is that my linux tex-root and tex-base
options do not include the WinXP directories.  If this makes sense, can
I edit the tex live config files to include them?

Thank you in advance,

Colin Rowat

Yes, it is possible. Your texmf.cnf contains definition of TEXMF which
just contains a list of several TeX roots. Add the definition:

MIKTEX = /path/to/miktex/root/dir

and then add $MIKTEX to the end of TEXMF. If you want to use some
extra fonts from MikTeX which you do not have in Linux, try

updmap --syncwithtrees

Thank you Zden&#283;k.  I have added 

MIKTEX = /media/sda1/Program Files/MikTeX 2.6

just after 

TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf

in 05TeXMF.cfg (in /etc/texmf/texmf.d) and, later in that file, to
TEXMF, for:

TEXMF =
{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST,!!$MIKTEX}

However, I still get the following error message when compiling (from
kile):

[LaTeX] 071101quasilinear.tex => 071101quasilinear.dvi (latex)
[LaTeX] finished with exit status 1
./071101quasilinear.tex:7:File `latexcad.sty' not found. ^^M
[LaTeX] 1 error, 0 warnings, 0 badboxes

When I comment out \usepackage{latexcad}, compilation works until I
reach the \input{} commands for the .lp files that latexcad interprets. 
This gives me a "file ... not found" error - which may reflect a bad
path format: I use relative references like
"\input{graphics/070705ql.lp}".

Otherwise, tex-live is working perfectly, even accessing my bibtex file
in the WinXP partition.

Thank you again for your help,

Colin

Did you run texhash?  This will update the file database and is
required if you add new files/directories.

This should work.

Hmm, this means that you updated the database.  Or is your bibtex file
in a TEXMF tree which doesn't begin with "!!"?.

If you run texhash, make sure a database is created for $MIKTEX.  If
not, you probably have to add $MIKTEX to TEXMFDBS, too.

Could you run tex on the commandline with kpathsea debugging enabled?
It is described in the kpathsea info manual (run "info kpathsea" and go
to section 2.6.3).

Regards,
  Reinhard

MikTeX has its own system for file databases. It is better to use just
$MIKTEX without exclamation marks. If you prepend !! and you update
MikTeX, you have to refresh the database in MikTeX from its options
dialogue as well as by texhash (=mktexlsr) in Linux. And the partition
with MikTeX must be mounted, must be writable and the path must be in
TEXMFDBS. Without !! search will be slower but you will have less
problems with administration.

It depends oo the size of the tree.  If it's small I agree with you.
But if it's huge, it's worth the extra effort.

Thank you Reinhard and Zden&#283;k.

As I more interested in getting my texlive running properly now than in
its efficient operation, I have removed the "!!" prepend to $MIKTEX in
the .cfg file.

I have run texhash (just double clicking it in a Nautilus window and
selecting "run from terminal") and did run latex from a command line
with the "-d -1" options - which I understood (perhaps incorrectly) to
enable the kpathsea debugging.  I could not easily find a debugging
logfile, though, so am not sure that this worked properly.

I think, then, at this point, that the easiest thing for me to do is to
not use latexcad - an obsolete drawing package that I used in Windows as
it allows any text inside it to be compiled and set with LaTeX as well. 
I should be able to work around this with xfig.

Again, thank you for your help in getting this to work.

Best,

Colin Rowat

You can always try

kpsewhich filename -program latex (or pdflatex)

to see whether kpathsea finds the file, or

kpsewhich --show-path latex

to display the list of directories where kpathsea will search for the
files. This is very efficient way for finding problems in your
installation.

Meaning what?
This is a pdf that doesn't use JavaScript (and generated by pdftex),
so what exactly should it do?

Hi all!

The new packages uploaded some time ago by myself to Debian unstable have
been backported to etch are as usual available on people.debian.org.
Don't forget that you will also need lmodern and context for
texlive-full.

Binaries of texlive-bin 2007.dfsg.1-1 are currently only for i386, I 
hope to get powerpc binaries soon. amd64 I will build myself rather
soon.

I will take a look at that, but note that the 
	context-doc-nonfree
packages has NOT been updated in a while, so it probably is in a bad
state wrt organization. Next upload will ship pdf uncompressed, and
hopefully fix these issues.

Can you propose/list a better/working layout? The docs should reside
somehow under
	/usr/share/doc/<package>
but can be linked into
	/usr/share/doc/texmf/
which in turn is linked from
	/usr/share/texmf/doc/
so that texdoc finds the stuff.

I am using ubuntu 7.10 (amd64) and installed context using the debian 
repositories without any problem. However, the directory structure of the 
documentation has been reorganized, and it does not work correctly.

What I usually do is

locate show-man.pdf | xargs gnome-open

which opens show-main.pdf.gz from /usr/share/doc/context-doc-nonfree/showcase/

Now suppose I wan to open the charts manual. The show-man.pdf links to 
general/manuals/mchart.pdf while mcharts.pdf is at 
/usr/share/doc/context-doc-nonfree/manuals/ and the file is named 
mchart.pdf.gz.

So, there are two differences here. The files are organized in a different 
directory structure, and have a different extension. Is there some way 
this can be corrected at the packaging end?

Thank you.

Aditya

fwiw, i checked it using the department's software, and the result was
negative.

i've never yet seen a true positive on tex material.  (the nearest was
an emtex-based script that renamed files: this qualifies as a dos virus,
apparently.)

Hi,
I just compiled source on a freshly installed Kubuntu 7.10.

configure didn't catch everything, so I had to restart Build some
times. Needed was
- libncurses-dev (IIRC texinfo needs it)
- libxaw-dev
- libxmu-dev
Checks for these should be added to configure.

Message-ID: <6faad9f00711081444i741ff361r8e7f9036a3390cfd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to suggest applying the "executable" flag on windows
binaries in TeX Live, even though that's usually not a problem since
windows usually doesn't follow those flags (but there might be some
crazy users out there misusing binaries form TeX Live for other
purposes).

----

Actually, I'm experiencing some *really weird* permission problems
when using rsync on windows to fetch copies of windows binaries from
TeX Live (when I rsync from a server, binaries don't work unless I
apply chmod 7xx to them after using rsync, although the right settings
don't cure my problem). If anyone has any experience with rsync on
windows or if anyone knows if it's possible to build rsync in
cygwin-independent (or any other windows-friendly) way, please let me
know.

Thanks a lot,
    Mojca

Hi Mojca, 
did you install from the CD or DVD?  I don't know whether the TL
installer for Windows changes permission flags after files are
installed.  If not, there is a difference: Files on the CD are zip
files currently, and file permissions are set on a UNIX system before
the zip files are created.  Windows has another concept of file
permissions than UNIX, maybe the Windows version of unzip is aware of
these differences.  Files on the DVD are uncompressed and copied to
the hard drive, maybe with Windows commands like copy or xcopy.
The resulting permission flags can be different.

I installed TL-2007 from the CD on my Windows machine at work and when
I run (under Cygwin) the command

     ls -l /cygdrive/c/texlive/2007/bin/win32

I get -rwx------ for all files in this directory.

BTW, it's probably not Windows which ignores file permissions, but the
explorer.  For executable files the permission flags are probably not
important because whether a file is executable is determined by the
value of the environtment variable %PATHEXT%.  When I run

  start "" foo.pdf

on the command line I get an "acces denied" message if the the
executable flag is not set but the explorer doesn't care.

Which program did you use in order to find out which permission flags
are set?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry, I don't have Windows at home, and at work I have internet access
only on the Linux server, which means that I cannot run Windows
programs which require internet access.

Maybe someone else could help and post the results to the list.

BTW, it's a known problem that the permission flags in the TeX Live
subversion repository are wrong.  Staszek already asked sometime ago
but I had no clue and we regarded it as unimportant because it can be
fixed more easily by the scripts which create the CD and DVD images.

On the other hand, I'm using the stuff which is actually in the
repository for production because this is the only way to test whether
everything is working.  There is no reason why this shouldn't work for
Windows users, too.

I fixed the permissions in my local copy of the TL repository but when
I run

  svn status

it seems that subversion did not recognize that something had been
changed.  Another possibility would be to remove all files and upload
them again.  But I fear that we lose all the svn log entries when
files are deleted.

If anybody on this list knows what has to be done, answers are very
appreciated.

Ok.  Since we are working on a new installer written in Perl, it would
be nice to know how Perl sees file permissions on Windows.

I just wrote a little Perl script which prints the results of Perl's
stat() function to screen.  Some values don't make sense on Windows,
but I think that you are most interested in [mode].

You can download the file from:

    http://ms25.ath.cx/w32-utils/stat.pl

Usage:

   perl stat.pl <some_file>

  Reinhard

You should use
svn propset svn:executable on filename ...

for all executable files. Some time ago I did it for my private
project, first I used "chmod +x" on the executable files and then used
find to locate all of them and -exec ... to set the executable flag.

Dear TeX Live Polish Masters,

could you enlighten me about one thing:

TeX Live 2007 (as released)
is the platex format/link necessary, or superseeded by polski.sty?

Thanks for clarification.

No, the platex format/link has gone. It is no needed any more.
We decided to remove that name (platex) for the next release of TL
because it has been also used by our friends from Japan for years.
Please use just \usepackage{polski} as always.
Back to the history: we introduced platex some years ago to assure
that the proper Polish hyphenation patterns were loaded and also to 
avoid the bugs in the babel package we encountered from time to time
(namely hyphen.cfg which is (unfortunatelly) the default to make the 
latex format; from the latex's restrictions it seems still illegal, 
but this is another story ;-). 

All in all, the platex package was also removed from CTAN and replaced
by just "polski" package. I'm still waiting for the final decissions from
Marcin Wolinski (the maintainer of the package) to clean out the whole 
bundle (docs, etc.).

All the best,

re the hyphenations exceptions list,

        I think it should be added to TeXLive.

    I agree, but we should include it in a tugboat directory on CTAN first.

i agree with this as well.

        There is one small detail missing: the license.  Barbara?

    Barbara is away for a few more days and I'm sure will be swamped for a
    while upon her return.

barbara is back, and indeed swamped.

    My personal preference for the exception list would be for a simple
    all-permissive license, for instance:

    Copyright 2007 TeX Users Group.
    You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this file.

i've no problem with this.  can one of you please
add this (maybe via the script?) and post it?
i think that info/digests/tugboat is a good place;
that's where tb0hyf.tex is located; a new version
of that file can be expected sometime in 2008.

    Thanks,
    Karl

thanks for me too.

Subject: [tex-live] ANN: API change of TLPOBJ
Message-ID: <20071112145227.GN23413@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all!

Please note that the API of TLPOBJ.pm has changed. make_zip now takes a
obligatory first argument $type specifying the type of container to
be made (zip or lzma). From the man page (pod2man):

       "make_zip($type,$instroot[, $destdir[, $zipname]])"
           creates a container file of the arch independent files in the
           "TLPOBJ" in $destdir (if not defined then "TLPOBJ->zipdir" is
           used).

           The $type variable specifies the type of container to be used.
           Currently only "zip" or "lzma" are allowed, and are generating zip
           files and tar.lzma files, respectively.

           The file name of the created container file is "$zipname.exten-
           sion", where extension is either ".zip" or ".tar.lzma", depending
           on the setting of $type. If no $zipname is specified the package
           name is used.

           If the package contains "binfiles", then container files for all
           archs containing only the binfiles are created, and those container
           files name is "$zipname.$arch.$extension"

           All the arch independent zip files also contain the respective
           "TLPOBJ" file in "tlpkg/tlpobj/$name.tlpobj" so "$zipname.$exten-
           sion" does contain this tlpobj file, while "$zipname.$arch.$exten-
           sion" does NOT.

           The argument $instroot specifies the root of the installation from
           which the files should be taken.

Best wishes

Forgive my naivety, but why is it called "Make_zip"
if it can make ZIP /or/ LZMA archives ?  Why not
call it "Make_compressed_archive" or similar, so
as to suggest its real function ?

But you are right, I will rename it to

Message-ID: <0B639136-0CE2-49D4-B8A9-C865E9747C7D@guntherrens.be>

Hi,
I'm trying to switch from MikTex on PC to Live Tex (TexShop) on mac.  
I'm trying to typeset files which turn out fine on MikTex. Everything  
turns out exact the same exept for my .jpg figures: they are given the  
right amount of space in the text, but for some of my figures all I  
get is very small thumbnail-like figure on the botom end of that space.
It seems that only the figures I prepared in photoshop are affected. I  
save my figures as RGB color, 8 bits/channel, high quality (8). I use  
the graphicx package to include on TexShop v2.14.
Somebody an idea?
Thanks!
Gunther

Which engine? How exactly do you include the figures (sample code)?

In general you should not trust that the figures will come out in the
proper size unless you specify the size explicitely.

The only problem I had with some jpg images (generated by my photo
camera) was some time ago with XeTeX (xetex calculated the resolution
in one way and xdvipdfmx in some other, and because of the mismatch
the final scaling was wrong). That problem still exists in TeX Live
(it has been fixed recently), but it's impossible to tell anything
more specific unless unless provide more details. (Although not
impossible, it seems unlikely to me that you switched from XeTeX in
MikTeX, so it must be something else.)

Message-ID: <8719b6240711130443g3e292d9esa790b8b5e7ddf549@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have to typeset a XeLaTeX document which requires DejaVu Serif
Condensed Italic. I have dovnloaded and installed DejaVu fonts version
2.21. XeTeX does not complain but xdvipdfmx (run with -vv) reports:

>][4<DejaVuSerifCondensed-Italic(DejaVu Serif:Condensed Italic)@8.97pt
** ERROR ** Cannot proceed without the "native" font:
DejaVuSerifCondensed-Italic (DejaVu Serif Condensed Italic)...

The fonts are in /usr/share/fonts/dejavu-ttf-2.21, permitions of all
*.ttf files are 0644 and otfinfo reports:
[zw at centos dejavu-ttf-2.21]$ otfinfo -a DejaVuCondensedSerifItalic.ttf
DejaVu Serif Condensed
[zw at centos dejavu-ttf-2.21]$ otfinfo -p DejaVuCondensedSerifItalic.ttf
DejaVuSerifCondensed-Italic

I selected DejaVu Condensed Serif in OpenOffice.org 1.1.5 and tried to
type something in italics. It works fine. My OS and xdvipdfmx are:

Linux centos 2.6.17 #3 SMP Mon Sep 24 19:59:57 CEST 2007 x86_64 x86_64
x86_64 GNU/Linux

This is xdvipdfmx-0.4 by Jonathan Kew and Jin-Hwan Cho,
an extended version of DVIPDFMx, which in turn was
an extended version of dvipdfm-0.13.2c developed by Mark A. Wicks.

Non-condensed fonts from the DejaVu family work fine. Could you guess
whether it is a problem of the font or of xdvipdfmx?

Yes, "which engine" (pdftex or (dvi)-tex, and in the latter case  
which output driver) is probably the key question. I've seen  
differences in how drivers handle .jpg images; some always respect  
the image's resolution, and scale accordingly, while others assume  
the resolution is always 72dpi or 100dpi or something. If the driver  
behaves differently from the code that calculates the bounding box  
for TeX, you'll see problems like this.

Most likely, you're using pdftex through TeXShop (I think that's the  
default setting), but were using a dvi-based workflow with MikTeX.  
I'm not really familiar with how pdftex handles image resolution,  
though, or how graphicx measures them.

What resolution (dpi) does Photoshop say the problem images have? I'm  
guessing they're high-res (300dpi or more), and being printed  
accordingly (so they come out small), but are being measured during  
typesetting as though they were 72dpi.

What version of fontconfig is installed on this system? One easy way  
to find out is to run

     xetex -version

and check the library version that is reported.

Some problems of this nature seem to be fixed by updating to a newer  
fontconfig (2.4.x recommended), if that's a possibility for you.

I have solved the problem. I realized that I use 'latex' on MixTex and  
'pdftex' on TexShop. For latex I used the bounding box option when  
including a figure. Pdftex determines the bounding box of the figures  
by itself and uses the viewport option when the bounding box option is  
used, resulting in the reported behaviour.
Thanks for the help!

If your LaTeX is based on pdfTeX (in DVI mode), then
you can try package `bmpsize'. It uses the mode independent
\pdffiledump from pdfTeX 1.30 to get binary data, analyzes them and
feeds the image size back to graphics.

I think so. My binaries are just a convenience for inbetween updates.

Btw, I will do a checkin in a day or so. It is prudent to wait
a little, just in case I made a silly mistake (again) ;-)

Message-ID: <20071116122511A.tutimura@nn.iij4u.or.jp>

  Hi all,

  I can't understand why "$TEXMFMAIN" is given higher priority
over "$TEXMFLOCAL" in the default definition of TEXMF in "texmf.in".

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in?view=markup
>> TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

I guess it's a simple typo since teTeX-3.0,
because in other places "$TEXMFLOCAL" is given higher priority,
like in a comment few lines above, and in the definition of SYSTEXMF.
>> %   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
>> SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFSYSVAR;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST

I patches SVN/Build/source:

M      texk/tetex/updmap.cfg.5
M      texk/tetex/texdoctk.man

M      texk/web2c/man/tex.man
and committed the bunch (rev 5429).

What is the source of tcdialog man page?

But I suppose that the next check in of these programs will destroy the
fix, right?

Ok: you have incorporated the stuff, the one in texk/tetex/ will not be
touched from outside. Leaves xdvi man page. I guess I have to send it to
Ulrik afair.

Subject: [tex-live] kpsewhich search order and how to change it
Message-ID: <200711161358.17859.p.k.f.holzenspies@utwente.nl>

Dear all,

I'm truly sorry if I could have easily found the answer to this problem in the 
archives or on a wiki. If so, I must have overlooked.

My problem is rather far beyond my understanding of TeXLive and especially 
Kpathsea. It seems I can't get TeX to use the texmf in my home directory. 
Although, sometimes it does. I can't illustrate my confusion better than by 
the following.

I use a package called TikZ/pgf. When running my LaTeX document, some files 
come from my texmf and some from the system's global texmf (in /usr/share/). 
Since the version in my personal texmf is newer, this creates problems. See 
this test:

holzensp:~> kpsewhere tikz.sty pgfcore.code.tex
/home/aid/holzensp/texmf/tex/pgf/latex/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz.sty
/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz.sty
/home/aid/holzensp/texmf/tex/pgf/generic/pgf/basiclayer/pgfcore.code.tex
/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pgf/basiclayer/pgfcore.code.tex

So, both files are in both my and the global texmf. Note that in both cases, 
kpsewhere shows the /home/aid/holzensp/texmf first. However, when I as 
kpsewhich:

holzensp:~> kpsewhich tikz.sty pgfcore.code.tex
/home/aid/holzensp/texmf/tex/pgf/latex/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz.sty
/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pgf/basiclayer/pgfcore.code.tex


Can anyone explain this? Is there a way to force the use of files in my own 
texmf?

Regards,
Philip

PS.
For debug info: I use the default TeX Live 2007 distribution as packaged for 
openSuSE 10.3. This means I have kpathsea version 3.5.6

Do you have ~/texmf/ls-R ? If yes, it could be outdated. If no, strange.

Remove it, it should not be necessary, TEXMFHOME is searched without
ls-R (i.e., doesn't have leading !! in texmf.cnf)

Dear Norbert, all,

The ls-R in my texmf was where kpsewhere found the files in the first place, I 
think. I deleted ~/texmf/ls-R. Results are the same, only much, much slower. 
After rehashing (i.e. making a new ls-R), the results are still the same.

Indifferent of where the information came from, though, isn't it extremely odd 
that kpsewhere gives my ~/texmf/* results first for both files and kpsewhich 
returns different texmfs?

Just in case, I've appended the output of "texconfig conf" to the end of this 
e-mail.

Regards,
Philip

Hmm, this is strange.

	kpsewhich -progname latex  -show-path .tex

gives any hint?

(Mind, I am not an expert with kpathsea searching, it is a mystery)

Did you get some errors during rehashing, i.e. that some directories
were skipped because they are not writable? This may be also a problem
of permissions of the ls-R files, not only directories.

The access rights really wouldn't have anything to do with it; like I said: I 
can simply write my ~/texmf/ls-R, so anything in there that would be 
inaccessible, would actually not be *readable* as opposed to writable. 
Anything that's not readable can't be used in the first place.

This was actually very helpful. I didn't know too much about the implications 
of these TEXINPUTS.<progname> variables. The outcome was actually quite 
informative:

holzensp:~> kpsewhich -progname pdflatex  -show-path .tex | sed -e "s/:/\n/g"
.
/home/aid/holzensp/texmf/tex/latex//
!!/etc/texmf/tex/latex//

/home/aid/holzensp/.TeX
/usr/share/doc/.TeX
/usr/doc/.TeX
/home/aid/holzensp/.TeX
/usr/share/doc/.TeX
/usr/doc/.TeX


This led me to my /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, which shows:

TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!
$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

and

TEXINPUTS.pdflatex      = .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//

Because TEXMF is a {...} list and {latex,generic,} is a list too, the first is 
iterated over first. This means that my ~/texmf gets interwoven with the 
global texmfs in the search list (i.e. in the kpsewhich output 
above, /home/aid/holzensp hits are not grouped together). Should this be 
considered a bug?

Anyway, when I move ~/texmf/tex/pgf to ~/texmf/tex/latex/pgf it all works 
fine.

The reason that I have a single directory for the entire pgf package 
(including the generic, context, tex and latex parts) is that it makes it so 
much easier to do manual package maintenance. Putting this pgf directory in 
the latex part of my texmf means plain tex and context won't be able to find 
it.

Norbert, I would suggest to either find a different format for the texmf.cnf, 
such that these directories are grouped by locality, or to make an explicit 
note about this behaviour somewhere.

I have a workable solution and my understanding of TeX (Live) has increase. As 
such, I'm as happy as can be ;)

Kind regards,
Philip

This is a matter of taste/experience.  The difference only matters if
you have the same package in both
trees (name clashes are dangerous and need to be eliminated rather
than hidden).  Some sites take the view that new things go into
TEXMFLOCAL and will eventually appear in TEXMFMAIN, probably in an
updated version.   Since it is hard to keep up with changes, it is all
too easy to end up with old versions in TEXMFLOCAL, so this approach
means you get to be slack about cleaning out old cruft that has
accumulated in TEXMFLOCAL.

I tend to use TEXMFLOCAL for truly local site-specific things.  If I
need an updated version of a package that exists in TEXMFMAIN, I use a
TEXMFUPDATES tree (which is maintained using MiKTeX's package manager
so linux and Windows users see the same versions).   ConTeXt, which
updates often, gets a separate TEXMFCONT tree.

In summary, when installing a newer version of a package (perhaps to a
user or to a local texmf tree),  the directory layout of the original
installation should be followed.  I think we are getting to the point
where package maintenance has to be automated.

Hi Philip,

    /home/aid/holzensp hits are not grouped together). Should this be 
    considered a bug?

It's an inescapable (if confusing) result of the way things are defined.
All kpathsea is doing is normal brace expansion.  I doubt that adding a
new feature of "depth-first" brace expansion would make things any
clearer.

Also, it's not clear to me that it is desirable to search all the
directories in a given tree (~/texmf or whatever) before all the
first-level items (latex/ in this case) in all the trees.  In fact, it
seems to me that that would have a much greater chance of finding the
wrong file.

    The reason that I have a single directory for the entire pgf package 

I hear you, and I too find the splitting apart of a package into
different directories very painful.  Unfortunately it is not obvious (at
least to me) how to improve things.  I've had various ideas, but they
all cause as many problems as improvements.

    or to make an explicit note about this behaviour somewhere.

The general behavior is documented in the Kpathsea manual (and briefly
at the top of texmf.cnf too).  I admit the behavior you were seeing is
not easy to pull out from the documentation, but I don't know how to
improve it.  If you have a specific suggestion, I'm glad to incorporate
it.

Glad it all worked out in the end, anyway.

    Indifferent of where the information came from, though, isn't it
    extremely odd that kpsewhere gives my ~/texmf/* results first for
    both files and kpsewhich returns different texmfs?

No, although I can see why it's surprising.  kpsewhere is just a shell
script that calls kpsewhich on each element in TEXMF:

    for path in `kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMF'`
    do
        eval TEXMF=\$path kpsewhich $options \"\$file\"
    done

It shows all files by the same name in different trees.  I don't exactly
know what good this is.  The stated purpose is to check for conflicts,
but since it doesn't report conflicts within a single texmf tree, it's
less than optimal.

      I can't understand why "$TEXMFMAIN" is given higher priority
    over "$TEXMFLOCAL" in the default definition of TEXMF in "texmf.in".

It's not a typo.  It was a decision made by Thomas which TL followed.
Here is what Thomas wrote (not to the list, but I trust he won't mind me
including it here!) the last time someone asked:


Date: Tue, 03 Apr 2007 14:38:22 +0200
From: Thomas Esser <te at dbs.uni-hannover.de>

In teTeX-3.0, TEXMFMAIN contains only the files that are copied during
"make install", e.g. very important and version dependend stuff such
as pdfetex.pool.

In my understanding, TEXMFLOCAL is ment to overrule stuff out of
TEXMFDIST, but the files contained in TEXMFMAIN are tightly related to
the distribution itself and should not be overruled.

He isn't the maintainer anymore, and in the current upstream it seems to
be fixed, that is what I have seen in the sources .orig.tar.gz available

this to it:

Subject: [tex-live] install-tl.sh hangs on empty PKGONLY.list
Message-ID: <20071116162745.GA32657@math.gcsu.edu>

On OpenBSD 4.1, install-tl.sh will hang while tar'ing the
files listed in $work_dir/PKGONLY.list if PKGONLY.list is empty.
The problem is that tar is waiting for the contents of the file
from the empty PKGONLY.list, redirected through stdin.

This problem was mentioned briefly in an earlier post on Tue May 1
15:46:31 CEST 2007. That post mentioned the problem can be fixed by
typing <ctrl>+d when the tar waits.

The following patch fixed the problem in install-tl.sh, eliminating
the need for <ctrl>+d:

Damned, I didn't read detailed enough, because otherwise I would have
suggested that. I didn't see that all the pfg stuff is in ONE dir in you
home dir.

Well it is FAR out of my abilities and responsabilities to change this
behaviour, and furthermore it will destroy tooooo many other
applications.

Definitely, that's the reason to have the dirs named after the format at
the beginning. No, no change for this.

Can you explain this behaviour, should it be like this? He means that
patgen can only read files containing ONLY \patterns{...}

No idea about all this, but I thought asking won't hurt.

    patgen can only read files containing ONLY \patterns{...}

As opposed to what?  I wouldn't expect patgen to parse .tex files.

As far as I can tell from a quick glance at patgen.web, it reads a
hyph-en-ated word list and (optionally) existing patterns (and an
auxiliary "translate" file), and spits out new patterns.

Yes, hence the port.

I ported tl to obsd-current bust recently. Use that instead.

The file /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex (in the
texlive-base package in Debian) looks like:
% The Plain TeX hyphenation tables [NOT TO BE CHANGED IN ANY WAY!]
% Unlimited copying and redistribution of this file are permitted as long
% as this file is not modified. Modifications are permitted, but only if
% the resulting file is not named hyphen.tex.
\patterns{ % just type <return> if you're not using INITEX
.ach4
.ad4der
.af1t
[...]
4z1z2
z4zy
}
\hyphenation{ % Do NOT make any alterations to this list! --- DEK

phil-an-thropic
present
presents
project
projects
reci-procity
re-cog-ni-zance
ref-or-ma-tion
ret-ri-bu-tion
ta-ble

It does not understand that lines with an % are comment.  It does
not understand the "\patterns{" line, the "}" line.

I have to change the file to:
.ach4
.ad4der
.af1t
[...]
4z1z2
z4zy

to be able to use it.

The manpage is atleast misleading.  It says:
       For a (very) long example of  patgen's  output,  see
       $TEXMFMAIN/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex,  which  contains the
       patterns TeX uses for English. 

And:
       [...] the pattern_file  containing  previously-generated
       patterns   (if  any)  for  a  particular  language

This makes me assume that patgen can read (and write) such a file.

Attached is a patch for mkind.c which expands an unnecessary
restriction on the length of style file names. It was previously
linked to the width of the console instead of the maximum file name
length.

if someone can find a person who's willing to upload the stuff to ctan,
i'm sure it would be appropriate.

we do actually hold something called pscyr ... in malyshev's private
compression format for his shareware system.  perhaps it's the same
thing, but the download claims to be lppl

As Robin said ... if the author uploads it to CTAN, I don't see any
reason to refuse it.  On the other hand, I can't get excited about
seeking it out and making special cases for it, either.

(Sorry for the delayed reply.)

    - libncurses-dev (IIRC texinfo needs it)

Texinfo can use basically any termcap/terminfo library.
I expect you already had one installed, but the configure check failed
for some reason.  If you can figure out why (see config.log), that would
be great, although I doubt this is going to be a priority in your life :).

    - libxaw-dev
    - libxmu-dev
    Checks for these should be added to configure.

There is no rational way to check for distro-specific "packages".  The
check has to be for actual libraries and headers.  And as far as I know
libXaw and libXmu already are checked for, at least in xdvi and the
other X-using programs I recall.  Do you remember which programs needed
it and didn't check?

I have just checked in a bunch of updates to bring XeTeX up to  
version 0.997. This also involved adding a new library (graphite), a  
major update to the icu-xetex library, and adjustments to the  
configure scripts, etc.

Therefore, although I've run successful builds on Darwin (PPC and  
i386) and Linux (i386), there's a good chance that we'll see some  
build problems somewhere as a result of all the changes. So anyone  
interested is invited to try building the latest source from trunk,  
and report any problems so that we can get them fixed promptly.

The same problem doesn't happen with MikTeX version 2.6.2627 on a
Windows system here; I presume a solution to this problem has been
solved in a later version of TikZ provided there.

Suggested solution? The problem doesn't happen with the thick space (\;)
or the thin space (\,), but it would be peverse to change to using one
of the first or, say, two of the last. :-)

I will try installing the newer TikZ under texmf-local, but I fear that
this might possibly break something else.

There was in fact a discussion of this problem on that (the
tex.pgf.user) mailing list in December 2006 -
http://osdir.com/ml/tex.pgf.user/2006-12/threads.html

Apparently, version 1.3 of pgf/generic/utilities/pgfutil-common.tex
fixes the problem. Perhaps not wise to install that without the rest of
the PGF/TikZ distribution, but I've done that here as a
semi-work-around, and the problem is indeed fixed.

A few days ago I replaced the complete pgf/tikz from TeXLive 2007 with
the one which is currently in svn repository of TL. The bug you

Hello,

I used dvipdf to create a pdf.
It does not create fonts, so my pdf
was not useful.

When I use dvips and afterwards
ps2pdf I see my text (and while
dvips is running, I see that fontfiles
will be created).

I don't know if this already is fixed or even known,
but I just wanted to make this known here.

Apparently, dvipdf is not part of TeX Live.  It's part of the

In most cases you should not use the automatically created bitmap
fonts when creating PDF files, since these fonts are resolution
dependent. When possible, you should use Type1 fonts instead.

Note that dvipdf, which is not part of TeX Live, calls dvips with
options -q (=quiet) and -Ppdf (=definitions suitable for PDF
production). The latter option is incompatible with most metafont
fonts, while the former option probably suppresses any warnings about
this.

No, this has nothing to do with fonts. Due to frequent bugs in
floating point arithmetics in various PS RIPs dvips converts all
dimensions to integer pixels according to resolution. Letterspacing
corrections and kernings accumulate and are inserted when they achieve
integer number of pixels. Take any document typeset with Type 1 font,
decrease the resolution (e.g. by the command line switch) to a very
low value, say 50, process it again by dvips and you will see that the
letterspacing will come out very ugly. I makes no sense to rasterize
bitmap fonts at such a high resolution. Anyway, metafont will most
likely report overflow with most fonts. Font resolution is controlled
by another parameter:

% Last resort sizes.
% If you accidentally include a bitmapped pk font, it will probably go
% at 600dpi.

R 300 600

Hello

There is a question concerning dvips for XP (TeXLive 2007):

Lets run

  latex sample2e

and then try

  dvips sample2e
  dvips -l2 sample2e
  dvips -p2 -l3 sample2e

The first two commands work as expected. The third one gives

dvips: ! DVI file contains unexpected Omega command (121)

This does not happens with dvips for linux.

(Karl answered: in psnfss)

Do we have to do anything on this front for now? I ask here on two
levels:
- TeX Live:
	should we start NOW a repackaging effort as Frank pointed out
	some time ago, or do we leave everything like it is?
	fpl/utopia now have license/readme in TL.

- Debian:
	do we have to do something besides tagging bugs with
	fixed-upstream and wait for TL2008/9 to come to Debian?
	Should we include the README-utopia and LICENSE-utopia file
	in Debian for the 2007 packages? Now?

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

So does anyone have an idea where we stand. Magyar seems to be a good
example, I don't know what will happen with others.

we got a burst of activity out of johannes, so i _think_ what's in the
babel directories is now "good", in the sense that known bugs are now
gone.  i would welcome contra-indications, if anyone knows of them.

we still have magyar.ldf in language/hungarian, which johannes says
would be impossible to bring into babel ... so istm that there's no
rational way forward.  this probably all derives from johannes' long
period of silence, so we (latex team) need to think about where babel
goes from here.  i'll talk to frank again.  (just like being back at
school: "please sir, it's bloggs, sir, he's not doing his work, sir.")

isn't life fun?

It has. Using, eg, OT1 encoded condrete fonts, for which I have no
Type 1 version installed, I get:

As I had written, it was this numeric overflow that I had expected. To
my surprise I haven't found a font where it does occur, though. I have
had a look at error reports concerning the -Ppdf option (they used to
be quite common!), and the problem always was that there was no
matching mode definition for 8000 BDPI. However, meanwhile somebody
has added such a definition to modes.mf. Does anybody know when this
happend? Not having such an entry might explain the OP's problems.

Somebody = me.  As soon as I became aware that a pdf "mode" was being used.

    Does anybody know when this happend?

I defined dpdfezzz to be 8000dpi on January 17, 2005.

The default of dvips (w32) is "-noomega" and
dvips (w32) has a switch -noomega0, namely,

dvips (Unix) == dvips -noomega0 (w32)
dvips -noomega (Unix) == dvips (w32)

Please try
dvips -noomega0 -p2 -l3 sample2e
or
odvips -p2 -l3 sample2e

PS: I don't understand why "dvips -p2 -l3 sample2e"
requires omega extension.

In latex-tds I need three patches in order to get
the DTX files compilable:

* bbcompat.dtx:
  old: %    can't use \cd{@undefined}} 
  new: %    can't use \cs{@undefined}} 
* frenchb.dtx:
  old: %     as the later is also defined by russianb.ldf!}
  new: %     as the later is also defined by russianb.ldf}
  (the `!' causes trouble in \changes).
* latin.dtx:
  old: % \CheckSum{449}
  new: % \CheckSum{450}

If I use the following changes,
dvips -p2 -l3 sample2e
naturally works. Do the changes break something?

The parsing in skippage.c seems more generally flawed.  It was just
accidental that the problem wasn't exposed on Unix, because (I guess) we
enabled Omega by default.  (By the way, this has nothing to do with the
bug, but why not enable Omega parsing on Windows, too?  Does it conflict
with Japanese usage?)

Of course sample2e.dvi does not actually contain any "Omega" opcodes, as
the dvitype output shows.  (Actually these opcodes are perfectly valid
DVI, even if TeX doesn't use them.  Anyway ...)

The problem, it seems to me (just looking at the code, I didn't do any
debugging) is that the switch in skippage.c falls through to the Omega
test more or less all the time, hence the complaint about the random 121
byte.  This just seems wrong.

So I think the best thing to do is just remove the noomega test
entirely, and let 129 and 134 be handled just as the other (144, ...,
236) two-byte cases.  We're skipping bytes here.  The time to complain
about an unhandled opcode is when the opcode is actually (attempted to
be) processed.

Does that work?  Wdyt?

Thanks,
karl

I agree with you.

There is no cont-en.fmt for pdftex, but why does kpsewhich find the
one for xetex? Of course pdftex can't read formats for xetex. :-)

TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//  so ...

If you use TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c{/$engine,}
then wrong formats may not be read.

No, instead we should include the information in the Catalogue,
regenerate our copyright file, and manually add the wording of the
license if it is nonstandard.

The Utopia license is indeed nonstandard.  (There was no way to get Adobe
to switch to something entirely new, ie, standard.)
