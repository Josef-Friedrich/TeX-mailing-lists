AFAIK tlpmgui for Linux and Windows share most of the code already.

Regarding Ghostscript, it would be nice if we can simply put an
unmodified version of Ghostscript on the CD/DVD.  At the moment there
are two problems:

    1. Batch files are not installed by the gs installer.

    2. The fonts had been modified but the UniqueID had not been
       changed. 

The first problem can be solved easily by sending a bug report.  I
can't imagine that the current behavior is intended.

The second problem can be solved this way too, but if a bug report
results in a discussion I'd rather wait until Jacko provides
replacements for all the URW fonts.  I assume that Jacko's fonts will
be shipped with ghostscript when they are ready anyway.  This will
enhance the ghostscript distribution significantly. 

Detection of a pre-installed Perl worked fine for me.  During the
installation process a Window popped up asking me whether Perl should
be installed or not.  Well, it would be nicer if this happens at the
very beginning of the installation process, but maybe I overlooked
something in the main menu.

As far as TeX is concerned, sigh, this was painful.  The installer
detected an old version of TeXLive and started in maintenace mode.
Renaming the texlive2005 directory had not been sufficient.  I had to
remove TL2005 related environment variables too.  This is extremely
painful on Windows.  I do not see any good reason why an installer
does not simply prepends the path to a new version of TeXLive to the
%PATH% variable.

The documentation says that there is an option "-install-mode" but
when you insert the CD/DVD into the drive the installer window pops up
and you have to proceed without having the opportunity to read the
documentation.

All the documentation is completely useless if the installer is
launched when the disk is inserted.

I'm also wondering, though so much effort had been taken to provide an
installer for Windows which works for some UNIX derivates too,
installing TeXLive on a UNIX system (using the shell script) is so
easy.

Regards,
  Reinhard

This won't do for portable use. The problem is that %path% consists
of the system path FOLLOWED BY the user path, for crying out loud;
Windows is full of such perverse streaks. For portable use, you
don't want to mess with the system path, so you'd better use a
preinstalled TeX, Perl and Ghostscript instead if they occur on the
system path.

Shortcomings in vbscript made it awkward to check the system path
and the user path separately, so my script just tests for their
occurrence on %path%, but with more effort or a better language one
could specifically test for the system path.

There is no problem in prepending components to %path% within a
command prompt session prior to starting up an editor. One would
have to test whether Emacs and TeXnicCenter pick up this path and
other environment settings, and pass them along to the various
TeXLive programs.

I can think of two reasons:
1. partial testing under Unix
2. to accomodate Windows refugees who still consider the
   command-line a dirty word.

Hello Siep,
I appreciate your reply and the comments  Reinhard Kotucha
has made following.  

Siep Kroonenberg <siepo at cybercomm.nl> wrote:

The lines above merely create a temporary environment for generating
formats and mapfiles. The real configuration takes place earlier, by
writing to the registry. I tested things under Windows XP and
Windows 2000, and in those tests a re-login was sufficient.

This is a problem for our location. Lab users cannot
write to the registry. Parts of the ghostscript installation
and dviout installation done by tlpmgui issued warnings
when they got to apparently non-critical stages that I think
involved writing to the registry. I have not been to the
lab to test yet though.


I am working on a web page about portable TeX Live and MikTeX, with
revised scripts and howtos. It might be useful to include a
zero-config solution where you start up a command prompt or an
editor with the right environment settings, somewhat in the spirit
of your Emacs solution. I would have to test how much functionality
could be made available this way.
I look forward to your site and am glad to help in testing if you
need, and of course to provide my emacs approach if you find it is
useful. 

I had something in mind that I can give to people for use at
arbitrary locations, so that is why I prefer to put in some tests.
Adding Ghostscript and an editor is the right idea. But for an
editor I would pick something like TeXnicCenter, which has a wider
appeal. 
 I have committed to giving at least one poster presentation on my 
project, of which this is a part, at statistical conferences this summer 
based on what I already have working in our lab. Because of emacs' 
inter-operation with major statistical packages, I anticipate the emacs 
specific approach will be of interest to my audience. However, having 
a non-emacs approach may be of interest to some, in which case 
having your work to reference will be valuable for me.

You mentioned to Reinhard Kotucha in another part of this thread using
tlpmgui. My own thought with regard to tlpmgui was to see if it could
have an option for configuring a master for a zero config DVD. That
is, to automate what I have done, starting with the contents of the DVD
image on writable media, installing into the TeX Live root hierarchy all 
necessary auxiliary software (perhaps including the emacs source already 
on the DVD? This gets complicated on Windows and last time I tried from 
source on OS X), performing necessary configuration, such
as setting paper defaults appropriately and inserting the emacs
startup file, and possibly the ini file to launch the editor on
DVD insertion as you suggest.

Given that I already have non-TeX related motivation for overcoming
barriers to working in emacs, the emacs context may provide some
advantages. Regarding conflicting installations, I think for some
things, exec-path may determine what binaries are used. If that is not
enough to circumvent problems, I think I may be able to prepend to
%PATH%.  Furthermore, it looks like I will be able to do tests on 
environment variables provided to emacs that will allow me to
make this zero-config approach work on OSX and Linux as well. 

I have worked through the emacs lisp documentation to the point that I 
believe I have all the pieces I need to make things work and will get to 
the lab starting this evening to start putting a generalized version of the 
DVD together. The emacs binaries are a constraint, making a lab specific 
DVD easier than an arbitrary location DVD. The relatively large size of a 
DVD opens these interesting possibilities, but there is a limit. In my own
project, I am right up against the maximum size. I need to look into weather
the ISO file system imposes even tighter constraints that I do not yet 
understand. I am still learning about re-distribution licenses, but perhaps 
distributing a pair of DVDs in a jewel case could make more space by putting 
source files on the second DVD.

And personally I wouldn't worry too much about dvi viewing
if Ghostscript is available for converting to pdf.
-- 
Siep Kroonenberg
I will look into your suggestion about Ghostscript as an alternative
to a dvi viewer. I thought about finding out how to change the AUCTeX
default from latex and dvi to pdflatex and a pdf viewer. But then I
had difficulty using Acrobat as the viewer, and set that aside.

Can users not even write to keys under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, in
particular HKEY_CURRENT_USER\environment and
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software ?

And can you check what group a user on your lab belongs to? Power user,
regular/restricted user or something custom? Is there a roaming
profile setup (user configuration stored on network, and therefore
identical on all computers on the network)?

You could try to create a virtual test environment, running Windows
under VMware and setting your Linux box or a second virtual machine
up as Samba server. If you can create a good match to the lab setup
then you can test much more efficiently, examine a test machine with
full administrator privileges and create fresh copies of your test
machines with no effort at all.

Some obstacles to portable use seem easy to overcome, and I hope
that the next Windows release will be portable. Besides that, people
may want to create customized versions for their own audience. It
remains to be seen whether that should be automated. But including
documentation and sample code on the dvd would already be a big
help.

I meant converting to PostScript with dvips, then converting to pdf
with Ghostscript and then start up a pdf viewer. Have a look at
SumatraPDF as an alternative to the Adobe Reader for Windows: tiny,
portable and open source.

I finally installed TL 2007 from DVD and instead of copying the fonts

additional fonts.

This used to work in 2005, but the 2007 version couldn't find wget. I 
had to install it to make this work.

In TL2005 getnonfreefonts tested for several ftp clients, including

I am not sure why texmf-local comes after texmf (it does come before
texmf-dist).  It's been that way forever.  It came from teTeX
originally, as best I can tell.

By coincidence, I just noticed this today for a completely different
reason, and asked Thomas about it.

The information for splitting lies in upstream TeXLive information, 

$ grep dvipos src/Upstream-source/TeXLive/Master/texmf/tpm/*
src/Upstream-source/TeXLive/Master/texmf/tpm/bin-dvipdfmx.tpm:bin/${ARCH}/dvipos
[...]

but the reason why it isn't included is in
texlive-bin-2007/debian/tpm2deb.cfg:

$ grep dvipdfmx src/Packages/texlive-new/texlive-bin-2007/debian/tpm2deb.cfg 
# dvipdfmx in Debian
blacklist;tpm;bin-dvipdfmx;*
recommends;texlive-base;dvipdfmx (>= 1:20050831-1)

In other words:  dvipos is a part of bin-dvipdfmx, but dvipdfmx is a
separate package in Debian.  Has this binary been introduced only in
newer versions of dvipdfmx?  We should ask the dvipdfmx maintainer to
add it.

Hm, this is documented mainly in the debhelper manpages, because there
are many ways to split a source into multiple packages, but debhelper is
the most common one.  Essentially, debian/rules somehow has to copy or
move the files into different subtrees, package1/usr/share/texmf and
package2/usr/share/texmf, and if there are multiple package lines in
debian/control, dh_builddeb will create multiple binary packages.

texlive in Debian, however, does not use debhelper, we do the copying
manually - again, the information is in debian/tpm2deb.cfg, the logic in
debian/tpm2deb-bin.pl.

it's actually around for quite a while; it was always distributed in the windows binary distributions and i have no clue why it never ended up in the lin/mac bin parts

Hm, that's one thing that's strange.  The other is why it's in
bin-dvipdfmx at all:  It is not distributed with the dvipdfmx sources
(see http://cvs.ktug.or.kr/viewcvs/dvipdfmx/) and has a separate
subdirectory in source/texk/.  That's the reason why we (Debian) missed
it, we just excluded bin-dvipdfmx.tpm because dvipdfmx already exists in
Debian. 

Why not have a separate bin-dvipos.tpm?

Package: texlive-fonts-extra
Version: 2007-1
Severity: normal

Hi TeXLive folks, there is a problem with archaic fonts, or with how
dvips handles them or is set up.

Here is how to reproduce:

- copy fonts/archaic/asamples.tex into a local dir (in Debian, it's in
  /usr/share/doc/texlive-fonts-extra/ and gzip'ped)

$ latex asamples.tex
$ latex asamples.tex

Note that this only includes Type1 fonts.

Interestingly, xdvi doesn't seem to encounter an error, BUT it generates
lots of bitmap fonts:

pmhg.600pk
aram10.600pk   cugar10.600pk  etr10.600pk  givbc10.600pk  linb10.600pk  oandsu10.600pk  proto10.600pk

(most of them in modeless, not ljfour).

Hm, I took this as a hint for an error in dvips or its map files, but
maybe it's an error in xdvi configuration instead, because it also
creates cmtt10 bitmaps where dvips uses cmtt10.pfb, and so on.

Any ideas what the cause could be?

do I see it right that the config files nag-*.cfg aren't moved in r4083?
The nag-*.cfg files must be in the same directory as the nag.sty files.

You are using a patched dvips. Please confirm that dyy etc. are
defined in tex.pro.
Please try the original dvips 5.96 in TeXLive.
Here, both of the original dvips 5.96 and 'ASCII' patched one
create PostScript file 'asamples.ps' which can be processed by gs-8.54,
gs-8.56.

Thanks,
Akira

    So the tpm changes could look like this, 

Thanks.  I made the change, and created bin-dvipos.tpm as part of
binextra.  I didn't regenerate the sizes or anything, so they are wrong.

    But I guess this is not the proper way to fix it, because the tpms
    are autogenerated?

They are a mixture of source and generated information.
(In this case, the "...Patterns" elements are source, the file lists are
generated.)

It seems to be a problem in dvipsk-ja in Debian. I guess this packages
needs an update.

I can confirm that with Debian TeX Live's dvips there are no problems.

Arghh, yes:  This damn dvipsk-ja Debian package uses this most beloved
Debian misfeature of diverting dvips.  It works correctly with the
original one.  However:

There is no "dyy" in TeXlive's original tex.pro, see e.g. at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf/dvips/base/tex.pro?revision=28&view=markup 

But it seems it isn't needed.

I know that TPM is basically RDF but I would also appreciate getting
some document explaining the meaning of TPM's elements.

Of course, there is no "dyy" in the original tex.pro.
"dyy" etc. are defined by the "ASCII" patch.
Please forget about that, and use the original dvips.

    scheme-mactex.tpm:      <TPM:Documentation name="catalogue"/>

I've now removed scheme-mactex altogether, since Dick and I concluded it
wasn't useful after all.
    
    scheme-tetex.tpm:      <TPM:Documentation name="catalogue"/>
    contain a link to catalogue.tpm, but there is no catalogue.tpm in TL

I removed catalogue.tpm from scheme-tetex.  If it ever turns out that
it's useful to include the catalogue, I'll reinstate it, of course.

Thanks,

    I am looking for a volunteer who will explain (interactively) to me  

If email counts, you can ask me.

    the structure of the TPMs or otherwise a good document.

There is no reference document that I am aware of.  Sorry.

    I have tried to look into these myself, but I am a bit stumped. E.g.  
    the scheme-tetex says it requires TPM:Package, TPM:Documentation and  
    TPM:TLCore stuff, but I cannot see the way it references to either  
    texmf or texmf-dist. 

I'm not sure what you're asking.  Yes, TPM:Package "means" texmf-dist,
TPM:Documentation means texmf-doc, and TPM:TLCore means texmf.  Fabrice
chose the names when he created the current structure.

There is nothing in any data file which makes this association, as far
as I know.  It's just written that way in the code (Tpm.pm, primarily).

    As you can see, we have /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/tex/generic//
    before /usr/local/texlive/2007/../texmf-local/tex/generic//

    What is the idea behind that?  Why would the local paths come behind
    the system paths?

Because (I'm reiterating Thomas) there's a distinction between the
various texmf directories.  In general, the stuff in texmf "goes with"
the actual distribution binaries.  Essentially, it's what is installed
by make install out of the sources.  Pool files and so on.  No good
would come of trying to override them in texmf-local.  Developers who
actually want to use texmf-local or another tree to play with different
versions can easily change the definition of TEXMF.

By this distinction, there are some files in texmf/ which really
shouldn't be there.  The one I just learned about is cid-x.map, which is
expected to be edited.  I guess I'll need to move that to texmf-dist.

My investigation of TPM has unearther a few bugs. Some, I have fixed  
myself (beamer TPM). But one I have not enough kowledge for:.

Testing scheme-full.tpm did not unearth any other problems (though I  
only tested the darwin parts when applicable)

Next Debian TeX Live packages should re-include dvipos (if I didn't get

I renamed it to lshort-ukr at some point (after the release I think?),

accordingly.

It seems to me that the package magyar.tpm and its contents could be  
removed from TL as it is part of Babel these days. It should then  
also not be referenced anymore in other tpms.

The magyar.tpm package only contains doc stuff in texmf-dist/doc/

there are indeed two magyar.ldf files.  there's one in the babel
distribution, and there's a much revised and updated one (size 217599,
it says here) which has been awaiting adoption into babel for some time.

see https://lists.dante.de/pipermail/ctan-ann/2006-October/002320.html

(the arrival of this sort of stuff, and johannes' failure to deal with
it, creates a problem for us working on ctan, as well for people
building a distribution.)

there's a large backlog of babel stuff -- several new languages as well
as upgrades -- french, spanish and hungarian, arabic, ...  :-(

what this means to tex-live i'm not sure, but i wouldn't be surprised if
what seems a "rogue" magyar package is in fact embodying the revised
.ldf rather than an outdated one.

    what seems a "rogue" magyar package is in fact embodying the revised
    .ldf rather than an outdated one.

Exactly.  I left it in doc/ knowingly, because I did not want to create
a conflict for magyar.ldf.  But I wanted to include it somehow, although
admittedly the chances of anyone finding it in doc/ are small.

    there's a large backlog of babel stuff

No kidding.  Is there any chance of another trusted latex team member to
"assist" Johannes in making these updates in the foreseeable future?  It
seems to me a lot of work has gone into them.  It's a shame that they
remain outside of core babel.

Karl

Well, personally I like to have the catalogue available on disk for
offline use.  But I don't know whether this is a reason for including it
in TeXLive - after all, I personally have got a copy of the catalogue
sources on disk, anyway, and could easily create the html locally...

Well, a note from someone sitting behind an analog modem: I download
the complete TeX Catalogue twice a year using ncftp. IIRC this takes
about 45 minutes. So you can do it even with an analogue dial-up
connection if you really need it. ;-) However, if you have a look at
the amount of documentation that ships with all TeX distributions I
wonder if *not* including the HTML version of the TeX Catalogue really
is such a big gain... (1) it can be updated automagically in the TL
repository, can't it? (2) it is an excellent starting point for users
struggling with the vast amount of LaTeX packages.

J?rgen.

Maybe you can save a lot of time if you switch to a program which only
downloads files which had been changed on the server.  'wget' has some
options which allows you to mirror a remote directory to your local
machine and 'rsync' is designed exactly for this purpose.  Even if you
update your mirror only twice a year, it makes sense not to downlaod
everything again.  But you can even update more frequently without
much pain if only files are transferred which are different from what
you have on your disk.  Especially for people with slow internet
access it makes a lot of sense.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Great to see your site Siep! 
I have posted my emacs-specific scripts at:
http://potis.org/~poti/software/livedvd

I just finished testing on Windows NT with the file
texmf-doc/doc/english/guide-to-latex/demodoc.tex
after commenting out \usepackage{palatino} and it seems
to work. SumatraPDF works great as the pdf browser, thanks 
for the tip. I do not know if the dvi solution is acceptable,
though I think what I have also works. 

I believe all works on Linux and OSX too, though I am still
testing as of this mail.

Thanks for the hint to wget, I wasn't aware that there is an option
for mirroring remote directories with wget. I'll give it a try. :-)

The LUA and PERL stuff should better not be removed. luatex-snapshot is

I really sent this to the texlive list, not the Debian list, and I
suggest a change in TeXLive proper, not Debian.  So NEW isn't really
relevant probably...

The comment says

% Perl, Python, Ruby, Java scripts (Win32 only)
% This is used by the irun.exe program which simulates a symlink
% but also makes use of kpathsea to retrieve the target

and then come JAVAINPUTS, LUAINPUTS, PERLINPUTS, PYTHONINPUTS, and
RUBYINPUTS.  To me that sounds as if those variables are unused on
other systems than Windows.

Either the comment should be changed, or the variables can be dropped;
or we opt to keep them to keep the differences between texmf.cnf and
texmf.cnf-4WIN as small as possible.

it depends ... this was first introduced on windows, and after that came 
the new tds script paths, i suggest to keep them because i occasionally 
use them independent of the platform

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I installed TeXLive using the command line script on Ubuntu Edgy and
used "C" and "L" to deselect some packages and languages. I'm quite sure
that I didn't deselect packages related to the german language.
language.dat contains lines for german and ngerman

$ grep german `kpsewhich language.dat`
german          xu-dehypht.tex
ngerman         xu-dehyphn.tex

and both files exist (slocate database updated recently):

$ locate xu-dehyph{n,t}.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehyphn.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehypht.tex

I also recreated the format files with

# fmtutil-sys --all 2>&1 > fmtutil-sys.log

but nothing changed. You can view the output here:
http://zvisionwelt.de/tmpdownloads/fmtutil-sys.log

Furthermore I added dehypht.tex and dehyphn.tex to language.dat but it
did not help either. Again, both files exist:

$ locate /dehyph{n,t}.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/dehyphn.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/dehypht.tex

Did I overlook something? Any ideas what's going wrong here?

Best wishes
Christoph

PS: Maybe you wonder why I didn't just try to reinstall without
deselecting packages. There's not much space left on my office PC and
TL2007 installation took more than 2 hours on this machine ...

It's best to keep the differences as small as possible.  Maybe we can
find a way to generate both files fom a single source.  It is quite
hard to maintain the files separately.  Most variables are set
identically on both systems and if something is changed in the UNIX
version it can happen that Staszek does not notice the change.  And if
the files are too different, diff will produce too much output and
possibly bugs are overlooked.

I wrote a little script last year which derived texmf.cnf-4WIN from
texmf.cnf, but it turned out to be useless because it only changed
values of variables but it did not allow to add new variables or
change comments.  There is still a lot of time until TL-2008 is
released and I'll certainly look for a better solution.  What I think
is most reasonable is a LaTeX-like approach (dtx files).  I like the
dtx files because nothing is duplicated and you see what goes into
which file.  It even allows to provide two config files for Windows,
one for a local installation and one for a network installation.  It's
not very difficult to implement something like that in Perl.

At the moment it's best not to remove Windows stuff from texmf.cnf.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Many thanks.  However, I followed the links on your web site and found:

     http://tex.aanhet.net/mingtex/

Well, it's a pity that the TeXLive binaries for Windows are not
derived from the same sources as the UNIX binaries.

I have the impression that MinGW (Minimum GNU for Windows) is a nice
thing, and AFAIK Pawel used it to compile Perl for TeXLive.

I always thought that compiling TeX related programs with MinGW
requires a lot of effort because Fabrice used Microsoft tools and a
lot of work is required to adapt Makefiles and autoconf stuff.

But what you achieved is ***much*** more than I expected.  I added
Jerzy to the CC because he told me recently that he knows someone whom
he probably can convince to look into it.  I think that what you have
done already is a very good starting point.

Many thanks!

See you in Bachotek,
  Reinhard

They almost are, but not quite.  Akira has a forked set of sources.
(Which are in the source/ dir.)

However, as far as I know, mingw is not used.

As Karl noted, they are. The motivation for using MinGW is to
minimize the changes wrt. the Unix version. But since the native
compiler is very slow, you are pretty much forced to cross-compile,
which creates some complications of its own.

As Martin noted, this stuff is old. But I would love to see it
picked up by somebody else.

I am using your stuff (slightly adapted, so I don't have to rerun
reautoconf all the time) for the cross-compiled binaries of luatex
and metapost.  It has been very helpful.

Message-ID: <200704111744.l3BHiuh13638@f7.net>

Hello Christoph,

    http://zvisionwelt.de/tmpdownloads/fmtutil-sys.log

In that log, pdflatex.fmt and latex.fmt are being dumped with the German
hyphenation files (and a lot more besides).  However, in your
tl2007-mexp transcript, nothing but the minimal languages are given.  So
the question is why.

Perhaps when you are invoking pdflatex (or latex, worth trying that to
see if the behavior is different), it's not reading the .fmt file you
just dumped, but some other .fmt.  As a quick check, you can see the
.fmt dump date in tl2007-mexp.log.

Failing that, running
  pdflatex -recorder tl2007-mexp.tex
will show you all the files read/written during the run, including the fmt.

Failing that, running
  pdflatex -kpathsea-debug=-1 tl2007-mexp.tex
will output voluminous information to stderr about what is being
searched for where.

If it really is reading the .fmt that was created with all the stated
hyphenations, I am at a loss.

Hope this helps,
k

Subject: [tex-live] texmf-local vs. texmf
Message-ID: <200704112153.l3BLrfJ13475@f7.net>

I wrote before about the theory of having texmf-local override
texmf-dist, but not texmf.  The result is that, in the current
distribution, cid-x.map and ttfonts.map (and probably other files) have
to be edited in their texmf/ location rather than in texmf-local.

One possibility is to move those files.
Another possibility is to have texmf-local override texmf.

As an experiment, can anyone who is up for that try changing their
definition of TEXMF in texmf.cnf to:
TEXMF = {!!$TEXMFCONFIG,!!$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

(Transposing TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFMAIN from the default; of course if
you've made other changes the actual line may look different.)

And see if any problems result?  Namely, old config files that you may
have hanging around in texmf-local that were not being read (and thus
not causing problems).  I had some myself, and so I wondered how
widespread that is.

Thanks,
Karl

    Re: [tex-live] texmf.cnf: Why "Part 4: extra format

To answer the question, Part 4 existed because those defns were not
included in the teTeX texmf.cnf or the original kpathsea texmf.in.

I don't see any reason to maintain that distinction, so I've applied
your patch to texmf.cnf and texmf.cnf-4WIN (in Master/texmf/web2c) and
texmf.in (in source/texk/kpathsea).

Thanks,

The wrong .fmt file is used ...

That shows me that the .fmt file in $HOME is used. Running fmtutil
instead of fmtutil-sys solved the problem!

Yes, it did, thanks a lot!

Why are files which are edited for configuration in TEXMFLOCAL or
TEXMFMAIN at all?  Shouldn't they be in

Debian has long ago done that exchange.  But we also provide
TEXMFSYSCONFIG, and in fact texmfmain means something different for us
(pool files and stuff is in TEXMFDIST, dpkg-managed, and add-on packages
not included in (our) texlive install into texmfmain.

traditionally texmflocal has been used for that; the permutations of 
sys|var|config are tetex ones

and local precedes main

Hello Martin,

If I understand correctly, pdfopen is included in the debian texlive
packages. I have added the texlive mailinglist for verification.

Message-ID: <a6e8c1d0704120953r52b3ee37ieb486bf18ff3fe5b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm new to these parts of the woods so hello!

I am interested in making texlive available from the ports/packages
collection of OpenBSD.

I have two problems:

a) I am unable to have texlive link against all of the system
binaries. I have managed to have freetype and freetype2 linked
dynamically, but not any of the others.

This is the configure command Im using:

CONFIGURE_ARGS+=        --datadir=/usr/local/share \
                        --bindir=/usr/local \
                        --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6   \
                        --with-system-freetype2 \
                        --with-freetype2-libdir=/usr/X11R6/lib \
                        --with-freetype2-include=/usr/X11R6/include

All of the packages apart from ICU are installed on my system (ICU is
not ported as far as i can see, so obviously it wont link that. I'll
cross this bridge later)

Do you know if the "link against system libary" options all work? If
so what is te correct way to use them (on OpenBSD).

b) Dialog appears to be misbehaving.

Systrace is a tool that can detect applications using system calls
that it shouldnt. Kind of like a windows firewall for system calls.
You can add USE_SYSCTL = Yes to /etc/mk.conf whilst developing ports
to have systrace stop the build if a port trys to do something it
shouldnt.

Dialog is trying to write out of its prefix (or atleast it appears that way):

gmake[4]: Nothing to be done for `all-am'.

Is it ignoring its --prefix option?

(texmf-var is created as far as I can tell.)

    TEXMFSYSCONFIG

TEXMFSYSCONFIG (or TEXMFCONFIG) could be used, although as I understand
it, they are for texconfig-sys (and texconfig) to store data.  I'm a bit
doubtful that recommending that users put files there is a good idea.
For one thing, they are version dependent (ie, texlive/2007/texmf-var,
not texlive/texmf-var).

At any rate, as Hans said, use of texmf-local for this is quite
traditional.

    Debian has long ago done that exchange.

Ah, that is interesting to know.

Thanks,
k

Yes, pdfopen is already in the Debian packages (TeX Live 2005 in etch
and TeX Live 2007 in sid, at least after the next mirror pulse).  The
teTeX packages didn't have it.

That is not the current version in sid, but a locally changed one, and

No problems here with AR7/Linux, xpdf 3.00, ghostscript 8.54.

In both cases Multivalent is used to store the PDF file, in the
former case as PDF-1.4, in the latter case as PDF-1.5.

Perhaps "Preview" has problems with PDF-1.5?

Is there a "known-good" test document for PDF-1.5, maybe by Adobe?

There are several Tools at http://www.pdfxreport.com/tools.html

But as far as I see the tools are already expired.

I do not know the cause of the problem. I tested some other documents, 
i.e. PDF-1.3., which can not be opened with Preview.  I think it could 
be a wrong kind of pdf-creation or it is a bug in Preview 2.1.0 (v211), 
or both (because they can be opened in Adobe).

I'll check for Preview next weekend. So it is no TeX-Live Problem. But 
for MacTeX-Users, I hope the comment was helpfully.

Subject: [tex-live] Mktexlsr not working on texmf-local
Message-ID: <20070416160514.alea0h3ig4kcogwk@mail.zih.tu-dresden.de>

Hi,

I have installed TExLive2007 "for all users on the system" in Windows  
XP Home with SP2, where I am the only user with administrator  
priviledges. Then I have created texmf-local in the TexLive tree and  
copied some files into it.


Updating ls-r did not work, in the sense that files in texmf-local  
were not recognized, and in that directory was no respective ls-r  
file. Running Mktexlst led to the statement that it could not write to  
texmf-local.

So I properly deleted TexLive, and installed it again without choosing  
the button "for all users". Now there was no comments from mktexlsr  
about any restrictions, yet the system complained about missing files,  
although they physically were in subdirectories of texmf-local.

Could someone advice me on what I can do to actually use TExLive2007  
with texmf-local?

I have installed TexLive2005, where I have so far noticed only correct  
behavior with respect to texmf-local.

Yours,


Jan

How do I create the ls-R file in an arbitrary directory under Windows? 

Using mktexlsr seems to only regenerate the files for some predetermined set
of directories.

Subject: [tex-live] jadetex: difference between preloading a format and
	loading its definitions?
Message-ID: <87y7ksuw2s.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Hi everybody,

we've got a problem with the separate JadeTeX package in Debian and
collection-lang-cyrillic being installed at the same time.  Since this
is no problem with the upstream setup, I played a bit and found that it
is due to a strange behavior of (pdf)TeX, something I do not understand.
I would be grateful if someone could enlighten me.

I thought that preloading a format (here latex) with "&latex" would
"restore the current status" (which was current when \dump was executed
after loading latex.ltx), as the TeXbook says on page 283.  However, it
seems that loading the format dump has not the same effect as loading
its definition.

Ordinarily jadetex just loads the LaTeX format dump and adds its own
definitions in jadetex.ltx on top of it.  However, for reasons which are
explained elsewhere[1], the Debian package of jadetex does it
differently: jadetex.ini loads latex.ini after redefining \dump, then
resets \dump and loads jadetex.ltx.

Up to know, this worked fine.  But now I noticed that with TeXLive 2007
it no longer works if collection-lang-cyrillic is present at the same
time (texlive-lang-cyrillic for the Debian users), providing t2aenc.def.
But the old method of loading the format dump continues to work:

$ grep jadetex `kpsewhich --format="web2c files" fmtutil.cnf`
### From file: /home/frank/.texmf-config/fmt.d/40jadetex.cnf
jadetex		etex	language.dat	&latex jadetex.ini
nojadetex	etex	language.dat	nojadetex.ini
### End of file: /home/frank/.texmf-config/fmt.d/40jadetex.cnf

$ cat `kpsewhich jadetex.ini`
\input jadetex.ltx
\dump
\endinput

$ cat `kpsewhich nojadetex.ini`
\let\savedump\dump
\let\dump\relax
\input latex.ini
\let\dump\savedump

\input jadetex.ltx
\dump
\endinput

$ fmtutil --byfmt jadetex >/dev/null 
$ fmtutil --byfmt nojadetex >/dev/null 
Error: `etex -ini  -jobname=nojadetex -progname=nojadetex nojadetex.ini' failed

###############################################################################
fmtutil: Error! Not all formats have been built successfully.

###############################################################################

This is a summary of all `failed' messages and warnings:
`etex -ini  -jobname=nojadetex -progname=nojadetex nojadetex.ini' failed
$

and the log file (http://people.debian.org/~frank/nojadetex.log) shows
this error:

,----

`----

This is after loading jadetex.ltx.  The working jadetex.log (that with
&latex-preload) just has this at that point:


(/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/cyrillic/t2aenc.def
File: t2aenc.def 2005/09/27 v1.0i Cyrillic encoding definition file
)
(/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/base/t1enc.def

and the logs don't differ at all between starting to load jadetex.ltx
and these lines.


Can you help me understand what's going on?  And maybe find a solution
that makes our hack work again?

Many thanks in advance

Change TEXMFDBS in texmf.cnf:

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
%
% By default, this is only the !! elements of TEXMF, so that mktexlsr
% does not create ls-R files in the non-!! elements -- because if an
% ls-R is present, it will be used, and the disk will not be searched.
% This is arguably a bug in kpathsea, but we will not think about it now.
TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

I don't think this is different on Windows and other platforms.

in TL 2007, the dvips options regarding shell commands and absolute

importantly, the comment in config.ps is now wrong.

The latter can be cured with this patch:

AFAIK texmf-local is generated during installation if it does not
exist already.  Is *this* directory accessible?

This comes directly from TeX Live, and is still the same in the  
current SVN repository. So to fix MacTeX, it should be fixed in TL.  
And that in turn depends on getting an update from Hans, I guess.

Hi all,
the XL2 encoding was originally developed by me because I needed it in
some projects. However, now I am thinking about declaring it
unsupported and deprecated. I asked in the Czech/Slovak TeX mailing
list and it seems that this encoding was only used by me. I thus want
to ask whether someone depends on it or whether it would be safe to
remove it from the further distributions.

Sincerely,

    seems that loading the format dump has not the same effect as loading
    its definition.

Of course there are some possible differences, like expansion of \everyjob.

My only idea for debugging is to add \loggingall to t2aenc.def and see
why the encoding scheme is (un)defined in the two different cases.  Sorry.

Does anyone actually use jadetex?  Isn't it pretty moribund at this

Hi,

I have complained about inability to initiate texmf-local. I would  
like to thank two helpers and report on developments, which do not  
seem to be fully satisfactory.

I have replied to it, that I am the administrator, so this probably is  
not the issue. But I cannot yet exclude possible mistakes in setting  
up permissions by the installer.

? have noticed it when I switched to TeXLive 2005. This led to  
question whether the TeXLive2007 installer gets confused by any  
directory that is called texmf-local and is present in the path. I had  
such a directory somewhere in the remnants of defunct old fpTeX tree  
(of course, that is where my local files, especially fonts, were).  
After I renamed it, TeXLive installed a texmf-local outside of the  
actual TeX tree (I did not installed it in the default c:TexLive  
2007). Now mktexlsr works on that texmf-local directory, but TeXLive  
reports that this directory tree _is_ actually subsumed in the TeXLive  
tree.

Preliminary conclusions? The installer seems very frail with respect  
to the existence of anything called texmf-local in the path: there  
should either be a warning about this, or an improvement.I find it  
weird that the texmf-local tree is seen as inside the TeXLive tree by  
the TeXLive system and have no idea whether I should expect further  
troubles problems with it.

In ancient times I was asked by an installation program whether I want  
to specify location of a texmf-local tree. Times are changing. I would  
appreciate any further advice.

In particular, these packages directly Build-Depend on jadetex:

Package: installation-guide
Package: newbiedoc
Package: opensp
Package: qm
Package: terraform

and these Depend on it:

$ grep-dctrl -F Depends -s Package jadetex /var/lib/apt/lists/localhost\:9999_debian_dists_unstable_main_binary-i386_Packages
Package: docbook-utils
Package: sgml2x
Package: translate-docformat

71 packages Build-Depend on docbook-utils.

However, I'm not sure that these all actually use jadetex.  I tried to
find a test case for fixing an xmltex bug, and it turned out that the
two packages who claimed to Build-Depend on it didn't actually use it
(because they generated only html docs, no PDF).

Message-ID: <20070420.064331.213223529.wl@gnu.org>


In the gftodvi manual page I can read this:

  The output file name defaults to the same root as the gf file, with
  the dvi extension added. For example, the input file cmr10.2602gf
  would become cmr10.dvi.

For me, the word `defaults' implies that there is a possibility to
change it.  However, AFAIK, this isn't possible.  Ideally, an option
to specify the output file name should be added.  Until this happens,
I suggest to write something like this:

  The output file name uses the same root as the gf file, [...]

Such a change synchronizes the man page with the info pages, BTW.

The problem infact lies in the fact that most of texlive uses old
Makefile.in methods rather than Makefile.am -> Makefile.in. This means
that DESTDIR is not respected, and therefore it cannot handle the
openbsd "fake install" environment.

I have a big wad of patches (39 to date) to fix this. I wil send these
upstream to you once I have finished porting (Im just doing texmf
now).

Alas I have no time to rewrite the build system, so I have just tacked
${DESTDIR} onto the make install stages of each subsystem.

Do you agree with this?

Also while im on the list:

pdflatex and latex binaries (and others im sure) were not built. Is
this because they depend upon the texmf tree?

No, pdflatex is a symlink to pdftex and pdftex determines from argv[0]
which format file has to be loaded.  Similarly with latex. 

All you have to do is to run "texconfig init".  This will create all
the format files and symlinks.  The configuration file is fmtutil.cnf.

    old Makefile.in methods rather than Makefile.am -> Makefile.in. 

Well, just Makefile.in per se is not "old", it just means the package
uses autoconf instead of automake+autoconf.  As I'm sure you know.

    This means that DESTDIR is not respected,

I'm not surprised, since DESTDIR was invented many years after I wrote
the original autoconfery for Web2c and friends.  Lacking global build
system updates, the workaround we use is to install everything into a
temp dir using --prefix and --datadir, as in the source/Build script.

    I have a big wad of patches (39 to date) to fix this. I wil send
    these upstream to you once I have finished porting

Great, but be aware that in many cases, texlive is not the source.  It
would be very helpful if you could send patches to the real upstream
maintainer where necessary.

    Im just doing texmf now).

I'm not sure what you have in mind.  There aren't any binaries anywhere
else.

    so I have just tacked ${DESTDIR} onto the make install stages of
    each subsystem.

Sure, that sounds fine.

    pdflatex and latex binaries (and others im sure) were not built. Is
    this because they depend upon the texmf tree?

No, it's because they aren't binaries.  They are just symlinks to one of
the few real binaries -- the two you mention, and many more, are
symlinks to "pdftex".

They might only be created with "make world" rather than "make
install".  I can't remember for sure right now.

Thanks,

Yes this method works well, but I thought I would bite the bullet.

Ah. I was unaware that these sources were outsourced. How difficult is
it going to be to find all these projects?

Im aware of this. Everything that is to be installed in a packge must
be installed into a "fake environment" for pacaking list generation.
I've never done this for something that is not built before, so its
taking me a while.

Sorry, I must have mixed up logical and physical pages somehow - No I
cannot find a problem with page numbering.

There's something else, though:  Searching for "file", for example, will
show only the words in Typewriter, because the other words have the "fi"
ligature, and the PDF does not contain the information that this is to
be interpreted as "fi".  pdfTeX can do better, although I don't know by
heart how to do it.

Check source/utils/README and source/texk/README.TL for my terse notes

kpathsea/web2c itself is maintained in TL, along with dvips (and plenty
of others).

I expect we can track down any problematic cases ...

Hello texlive at tug.org (also simon and peter in the CC),

Just to recap I am porting texlive as a native package to OpenBSD.

I have problems with the "texconfig init" stage of texlive.

So far I have:

a) Patched the binaries in order to build into DESTDIR correctly and
have a package for OpenBSD that is installable wit the standard
pkg_add command. I have uploaded the packing list of the package (what
will be installed) here:
http://students.dec.bmth.ac.uk/ebarrett/texl_tmp/PLIST-base . I
obtained the source from tug.org as source.tar.bz2 (if i
remember correctly).

b) Packaged the texmf-dist tree as a separate package. I obtained this
directory from the root of the texlive 2007 cd. Packing list here:
http://students.dec.bmth.ac.uk/ebarrett/texl_tmp/PLIST-texmf .

Now I have problems. I will try to explain as best I can.

"texconfig conf" output is as follows:

As far as I can see this section of the main Makefile.in will do the
equivilant of a "texconfig init" (setting up formats and symlinks).

@FMU at install-extra:

I have not patched the correct paths into it yet. This is intentional
because it is failing when I do and I am trying to work out why.
Instead I reconstructing the process after the packages have been
installed (Later I will fix this, so it works at build time).

mktexlsr works fine.

fmtutil-sys has issues. And this is certainly the same error that I
get at build time when the paths are patched. Here are the errors:
http://students.dec.bmth.ac.uk/ebarrett/texl_tmp/FMTUTIL-SYS .
It seems to either be a really long output or an infinite loop, so i
^C's it.

Without fmtutil working you cant really use latex.

My questions are:

i) Is that the correct texmf tree that I have packaged up? Or is there
another with more files in it which I need?

ii) If I have the correct texmf tree then why is fmtutil-sys failing?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Best Regards

Edd

It's the right one, but you should ultimately use the updated version from svn.

    tcfmgr: config file `tcfmgr.map' (usually in $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig) not found.

That should be installed in texmf/texconfig/tcfmgr.map, as the error msg says.
source/texk/tetex/ is where it comes from.

    config.ps: not found
    config: not found
    fmtutil.cnf: not found
    mktex.cnf: not found
    pdftexconfig.tex: not found
    updmap.cfg: not found

These files being missing means that nothing will work.  I can't say why
they didn't end up in your texmf/, but if you compares yours with the
original, you should be able to see what's missing.  

    http://students.dec.bmth.ac.uk/ebarrett/texl_tmp/FMTUTIL-SYS .

It's not an infinite loop (you can see that by different log files being
written), it's just the same error(s) being repeated for each format.

Aside from the config file problems, I see that it can't even find
hyphen.tex, which certainly should be part of your texmf/ tree.  Sorry,
not everything in texmf/ is installed from "make install", and
hyphen.tex is one of those.

I suggest comparing your texmf to the TL texmf.

Best,
k

Today I wanted to test the win32 using a Samba share. But then I noticed

Do I need to do something special to get 'dviout' or is this just a glitch

In the CM family the font shape is either upright or italic or slanted
or small caps. Thus small caps is always upright. I know only some
commercial fonts which do not have small caps as a font shape, but a
full small caps family with upright and italic shapes, both in medium
and boldface.

Indeed, dviout doesn't exist in bin/win32.  I was never exactly clear
about this.  I expect Staszek can inform us.

> Do I need to do something special to get 'dviout' 

My understanding is that you need to install it manually from
support/tex318w.zip (or CTAN).  (Why a program named "dviout" is in a
zip file named "tex", I also do not know.)

Best,
Karl

I think, the reason for this is

Is support for --disable-multiplatform dropped?

Not intentionally.  I never use it, so didn't notice.

    I think, the reason for this is
    http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in?r1=4145&r2=4144&pathrev=4145

I was trying to simplify things by having the texmf.{in,cnf} in the
source tree be the same as what is actually used in TL.  Also trying to
avoid having build directories in paths, which several people noted to
their confusion.

If you put back the original texmf.cnf, does --disable-multiplatform work?

Thanks,
Karl

Message-ID: <a6e8c1d0704291846m39264932i1db3b53de735e6fb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Just now I have built my first document using my port!

I have some minor things that I need to clean up and converse with the
OpenBSD port guys, but soon(ish, as I have exams for my degree in less
than 2 weeks) I will need somewhere to upload my sources somewhere
where the OpenBSD developers (and ultimately the package cluster) can
grab them.

Is tug able to offer this hosting? I appreciate that the texmf tree is
huge and also that I am probably being slightly cheeky by asking
(Sorry about this).

Should the perl version of epstopdf in TL be retired in favour of the  
c-coded version? What speaks against it is that it requires a  
Ghostscript which is not part of TL. If a gs-independent epstopdf has  
a role apart from a gs-dependent one, it is unfortunate that the c- 
coded version has the same name.

Both require Ghostscript.  Which version should be used depends largely
on whether anyone is going to maintain the code.   Gerben has been
maintaining the perl code.  I think the flexibilty of perl is an advantage
for this sort of tool -- you can quickly create a version with a workaround
for a problem in some batch of EPS files (e.g., to correct SigmaPlot's
incorrect handling of parentheses in EPS strings) and it will be available
immediately to all platforms.

Both perl and ghostscript are essential to TeX Live, so it makes little
practical difference if one utility is replaced by a version that
doesn't require
one or both of those tools.

Subject: [tex-live] Install script TeX Live CD doesn't work.
Message-ID: <200704302311.41473.nat@switch.demon.nl>

Hello,

This afternoon I downloaded the TeX Live iso image and burned it on 
CD. The md5 sum was verified, the copied data was verified too.

I mounted the CD and did:
  # ./install-tl.sh

This is the output:
  bash: ./install-tl.sh: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied

bash does exist in /bin
sh is a symlink to bash

I tried:
  # sh
  sh-3.1# ./install-tl.sh

Result:
  sh: ./install-tl.sh: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied

I changed back to bash.

Then I tried to run the GUI installation
  # cd setuptl/
  # ./tlpm-i386-linux.pl

Result:
  bash: ./tlpm-i386-linux.pl: /usr/bin/env: bad interpreter: 
Permission denied

In /usr/bin there is a file perl and a file perl5.8.7
/usr/bin/env does exist


Before I tried to install TeX Live, I removed the installed TeX and 
TeTeX packages (in Synaptic package manager).
I'm using Linux, Kubuntu 6.06, KDE desktop.

Can you please help me to make the Live installation work?

Thank you.
