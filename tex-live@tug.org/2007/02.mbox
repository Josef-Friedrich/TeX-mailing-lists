    and I COULD submit recently before building the last image, 

Directly on tug?  I don't know why it would have changed.  Nothing on
the server has changed, that I know of.  

    '/home/svn/texlive/db/transactions/3838-1.txn': Permission denied

That directory is only writable to group svn, and you aren't in that
group.  But that's the way it's always been, AFAIK.

Maybe it would work to use svn://tug.org instead of the local
/home/svn/texlive directory for your repository.  Or delete everything
and make a new start.  Or check the svn mailing lists.  Sorry, I don't
know how to really debug.

If you send me the file you want to check in before I go to bed I
could try to upload it.  Then we know whether there's a problem with
the server or with your local setup.

If it's a server problem, maybe it is sufficient if Karl or Kaja run
"svnadmin recover /path/to/repository".

So we should include col-gen.rec. in medium. 

But it makes no difference in practice, as Jonathan said, since only
XeTeX packages use it.  So I won't undo what has been done.  We can
change it later, or not.

As for ifpdf, it's part of oberdiek, so we'd need to ask Heiko to split
it out into its own package.  Since no problems have ever been reported,
I'm not inclined to take up his time with that.


Anyway, I will rebuild the images in a little while.

Thanks for mentioning it.  Indeed, the catalogue package in TL is
unchanged since 2005.

Since we're doing another build, I'll see if I can update them simply by
copying CTAN:help/Catalogue.  I'm not sure there is any good reason to
have the catalogue html files included in TL at all (the sources are xml
now, for one thing), but it seems too drastic to delete them at this point.

    - catalogue is pulled from sarovar (I am not sure about this, but I
      assume)

FYI, the catalogue source repository is on a Dante server now.  Sarovar
was/is too unreliable and too slow, unfortunately.

In my opinion TeXLive's selling point is that it behaves similar on
all platforms.  But on the other hand, if there are known bugs in some
libraries which had been fixed already, I do not see any good reason
why broken stuff should be put on a CD.  The question is:

    Does the new version only provide bugfixes or does it provide new
    features (which can introduce additional bugs)?

  Reinhard

No and yes. On unix systems (AFAIS!!) the updmap.cfg is dynamically
generated from the addMap entries in the tpm files.

But for windows and MAC I have *NO* idea.

Karl: I added the addMap Execute to psnfss.tpm, but didn't change the
updmap.cfg. Maybe this should be done before you build new images.

Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue/entries/koma-script.html is about 
versiobn 2.9t not about version 2.95b (correct that's the version at CTAN but 
not the current release) that's at Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/koma-script. 
So the versions at the catalogue files are not the same like the versions at 
texmf-dist and not the version of the release at ctan and not the current 
available release but something out dated. KOMA-Script is only an example. 
Others at the catalogue at TeX-Live are out dated too, e.g.

pdftex at texmf/... of TeX-Live: 1.40 (or maybe newer soon)
pdftex at texmf-doc/.../catalogue/... of TeX-Live: 1.20b
pdftex at texcatalogue.sarovar.org: 1.40.2

I think, no catalogue at TeX-Live would be even better than such an old copy. 
Best would be a catalogue that shows the versions, that are used for 
TeX-Live. Compromise would be to use a new copy.

BTW: I found the problem, when I've tried to use the catalogue information for 
the missing tpm-information writing a TL-->rpm generator (that should become 
a TL-->epm generator some day).

i should have made it clear that i was talking about ctan.  aiui, you
were complaining that we don't have k-s 2.96.  any such failure is
because we've not had 2.96 submitted to us.  perhaps you would rather we
didn't hold k-s?

which catalogue are we talking about, now?  if you mean the ctan
catalogue, retrieve the latest xml files from dante.de and every day
you'll find a few more have had their distribution tags updated/
corrected.  (every day i've had time to work on the catalogue, that
is.)  this is a process that is unlikely to complete soon.  there are
thousands of entries in the catalogue that are yet to be checked, and
yesterday i managed 10.

i believe, however, that every catalogue entry distribution tag is at
least superficially correct (i.e., it doesn't point into the void).

of course, there's also the fun i have when the new tex-live is actually
released and i have to check every one of the the texlive tags in the
catalogue :-}

No. That doesn't matter. But the very old catalogue files at TeX-Live does.

> which catalogue are we talking about, now?

As I told at my first posting, I've done

        rsync -avz --exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc . 

to get the current TeX-Live. After this there is a directory 
Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue with a copy of The TeX Catalgue. I 
found: it is a very old copy of The TeX Catalogue (more than one year old). 
It does not correspond with the packages (or the version of the packages) 
e.g. at Master/texmf-dist/ of TeX-Live and it is much older than The TeX 
Catalogue at sarovar or CTAN, too.

So either:

- "rsync -avz --exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc ." does not result in a current 
TeX-Live

or

- the copy of The TeX Catalogue at TeX-Live is very old and should IMHO be 
updated (either to a version that corresponds with the packages of TeX-Live 
or the the newest version) or removed

That version and license information is empty at a lot of tpm files is another 
problem, that doesn't matter for the release of TeX-Live.

I know my english is not very helpfull for clarifing the problem, so maybe I 
should never start to talk about ...

TL was _indeed_ cleanly uninstalled, but there was (a rest of) a teTeX
under Cygwin which _was_ in PATH. After removing it tlpmgui started in
installation mode.

But in my opinion it would be nice to be able to force tlpmgui to
start in installation mode. Consider the following scenario: I have a
TeX installed on my box, but want to evaluate another TL distribution.
In this case I would hesitate to touch my working TeX distribution and
its environment setting only to be able to test another TeX
distribution.

just rename "your-tex" directory to "my-old-tex' for the moment of 
testing, that's the simplest solution. The only problem you can expect
when you have set some extra environment settings, but sorry, nobody
can guess what you have (cygwin tetex, old fptex, etc.).

This is the TeX Live `live' distribution.  You can run programs directly

large to fit on a standard CD.

TEXMFSYSVAR is *not* set/used under win32, as we do not have
-sys variants of programs (updmap-sys etc.).

Have you installed CJK package? It is not included in the default medium

Anyway, your message is not related to win32 at all, so please do not

Nobody expects that tlpmgui guesses what TeX I already have on my box.
That is the reason why I would like to have a mechanism to _manually_
overwrite tlpmgui's guessing.

I'm not convinced that's true.  I use (and recommend) TeX Live
because it provides me (and others) with a nice standard TeX
setup for Windows.  I don't really care whether it supports
any operating system ending in "X", because I don't use such
systems, nor do I support anyone who does, so whether it
behaves identically on such systems is actually of little or
no interest.

Some do expect exactly that.  Since the locations of texmf trees are
tied to the location of
the executable it is natural to use that as the basis for locating any
existing trees.  Still, it is best to avoid surprises for people
installing TL -- especially for those of us who hope that TL will be
seen as a worthy successor to tetex.

Many cases of unexpected behaviour turn out to be due to some old,
forgotten, binary found in a user's path.  This is as much of a
problem on linux/unix/OS X as for Windows.  Some systems do have tools
(which, whence) that can help pin down the locations of binaries, and
I have seen perl scripts that walk the list of directories in the path
checking each directory.

It would be useful to have a texconfig option to check for multiple
version of key programs in a PATH as well as a windows port.  It would
certainly help if people can provide the output from "texconfig
confall" in bug reports.  Maybe tlpmgui can add configuration summary
section similar to "texconfig confall" that will be displayed if an
existing tex is found so the user can see what they have and decide
whether to continue or to hide or remove existing tex installs.

As far as I anderstand he did not install anything but is running the
live DVD.

  >> D:\tex\cjk-4.7.0\examples>kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMF
  >>{!!C:\TeXLive2007\texmf-var,Y:/../texmf-local,!!Y:/texmf,!!Y:/../texmf-local,!!Y:/texmf-dist}

Apparently "Y:" is his DVD drive and he set TEXMFVAR in the
environment because it points to the DVD by default.

BTW., TEXMFLOCAL has to be set similarly if needed.

What I do not understand is why latex doesn't find CJKutf8.sty though
it's definitely there and the entry in texmf-dist/ls-R is correct.
Other files are found, though.

  >> y:/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/sample2e.tex
  >> y:/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls

I do not see any other solution than to activate kpathsea's debugging
facilities (section 2.6.3 in the kpathsea info manual). 

BTW., I did not have the impression that he wants to bother Karl.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I do care whether it works similarly. I personally use OS/2 and Linux
but I am often asked for help by Windows users. I am happy that my

OK, to clarify (since both Zdenek & DAK seem to have misunderstood) :
I am not claiming that no-one cares about inter-system compatibility ;
I /am/ claiming that such concern is by no means universal, and that
some (perhaps many, perhaps most) TeX Live users are far more
concerned that it should (a) work on their preferred system(s), and
(b) be as up-to-date as possible.  I /believe/ that most would be
happy if each implementation were as up-to-date as possible for
that implementation, but that it would not matter too much if
another implementation on the same disc were slightly more
advanced or slightly more retarded.

Message-ID: <B9E88073-C062-411B-AD02-129B6BF58212@gmx.net>

Hi,

the latest TeXLive still seems to include version 3.0a of the LaTeX
package eulervm.sty, see

http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ 
eulervm/

Please, note that v3.0a is superseded by v4.0 since 2005-01-11 (sic!).
See the CTAN, e.g., http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/fonts/eulervm/
If you decide to change to v4.0, please, do not forget to update the
related virtual fonts, font metrics and fontinst sources, too.

thank you for your attention to this matter
Walter

Message-ID: <200702012154.l11LsV607801@f7.net>

Hi Markus,

    - the copy of The TeX Catalogue at TeX-Live is very old and should IMHO be 
    updated (either to a version that corresponds with the packages of TeX-Live 
    or the the newest version) or removed

There is no practical way to get the Catalogue entries corresponding to
the versions in TL, so (yesterday) I updated
texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue in TL to what is presently on CTAN.  If
you do another rsync, you should see it.

(Next time I think I will just remove the catalogue package in TL.  I
can't see that it is worth the considerable space and trouble, since it
is out of date instantly, due to CTAN'ers hard work!)

Anyway, thanks for reporting it.  I'm glad we had the chance to update it.

Best,
Karl

Phil, as you know I'm not a Windows user (except at work).  Most
Windows users use MikTeX (I had been told).  I don't know anything
about MikTeX but I assume that you tried it.  Can you explain briefly
why you prefer TeXLive over MikTeX?  Many MikTeX users I know never
tried TeXLive and I don't know anyone who is using TeXLive on Windows
but has experience with MikTeX too.  I'm quite interested to know what
people like/dislike in MikTeX/TeXLive.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Walter (and Vincent),

    Please, note that v3.0a is superseded by v4.0 since 2005-01-11 (sic!).

Clearly one of the many updates which I simply didn't have time to work
my way back to.  I just did a trial update, and it seemed pretty
straightforward, so I think there's no problem with doing it.  I'll work
on it a little later today for today's build.

Thanks for mentioning it.

Karl

Not having used MikTeX - the reason I hear it is liked so much is the
package management.

I am still fairly green with LaTeX having my first experience with the
last teTeX realease (in Fedora). When I installed the test TeXLive 2007
many of things I had been doing broke. They were primarily broken
because of updates to memoir conflicting with subfigure.sty and
glossary.sty. However, a little googling and I found that the teTeX I
had been using was very similar to TeXLive 2004. So I installed that
version and those old projects compiled again (I've fixed them all for
2007, btw - it wasn't too difficult, but I still need to tweak the look
of my glossaries some more).

That makes TeXLive very desirable to me - I can put a comment in a
project noting which version of TeXLive I wrote it in. If in six years I
need to tweak something in an old project, I don't have to port it to
tweak it - I can just use the version of TeXLive it was written in w/o
too much fuss at all. I might have to install some shared libraries if I
want to use the binaries, but most of TeXLive seems to only need glibc
which doesn't change too much in a way that breaks things. I'm guessing
though that the texmf-dist is the most important piece of it that I
would need.

That's my perspective as to why I now like TeXLive - even though
generally I prefer everything I install to be under the watch of RPM.
TeXLive though is a worthy exception to RPM management I think because
it is all self contained so it can be on a partition that doesn't get
wiped when changing to a new version of my OS.

-=-
If there was one thing I could change about TeXLive - it would be
texdoctk. I think it should respect the TEXDOCVIEW_* variables I have
set for my user for texdoc - and some of the documentation isn't
available, IE if I click on the documentation for memoir, I can get
memman.pdf but it doesn't offer me (that I saw) memmanadd.pdf which was
an important part of me figuring out how it does glossaries.

I think texdoctk might need to be re-written to use individual catalog
files instead of a big catalog file, so that it is easy for updates to
packages that add new documentation to just update their own little
catalog file. But I'm not volunteering, so I'll take what I can get.

It also would be nice if more commercial font foundries (IE Adobe, E&F,
etc.) distributed TeX support files with their commercial fonts. But
that's not up to anyone except the font foundries.

Hi Robert,

    doing so, I noticed that the ``Essential binaries'' collection was
    not selected by default.  Here is the screen:

Thanks for the report.  It's a deficiency in the install program.  The
``Essential binaries'' collection is in fact included in what gets
installed, but because it's done so as a dependency in
collection-basic.tpm instead of directly in scheme-full.tpm, the install
program doesn't notice.  There are other cases.

I could add the necessary dependencies to scheme*.tpm, but I'm worried
that it will mess up Debian et al. at this late date.  Since it causes
no real harm, and we hope to make a more substantial rewrite of the
installation scripts next time, I think I'll leave it.

    On a more minor note, if one is running the installation in a
    standard 25x80 terminal, one cannot see the first few lines of

This also will be fixed next time, one way or another.  As the earlier
reply said, it was my attempt to ameliorate a complaint that not enough
of the package descriptions was shown.

Karl

The above has been fixed in the latest win32 binaries.
(The reason: Fabrice's mktexlsr.exe should not be used
 in the new kpathsea.)

Effectively win32 and other type of build are the same.
The above code is for filenames by Japanese KANJI characters.
(W32TeX is mainly for Japanese users, but I believe the above
code does not give bad effects for usual file names.)

In the present win32 implementation, ls-R shoud be
written by lower case letters. Thus ls-R on DVD with
upper case letters will be a problem.
That is a limitation (sorry).

If you install on hard drive, and make ls-R,
it will become ok.

Thanks,
Akira

I think nearly *all* Asia Tex users need this fix .

PS: which env you use to build the whole w32tex ? I want to try this
on my own machine too.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0702020902120.30790@hahepc1.hahe>

Hi,

is there a trick to get the right path in these cases:

$ kpsewhich mktex.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf

$ kpsewhich texmf.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

$ kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

$ kpsewhich XDvi
$

$ kpsewhich pdftexconfig.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-config/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex

(there are a few more)

shouldn't they all be found under texmf-var? I thought maybe these are
the paths as seen by the tools that edit these files, but even then once
the file is existing in texmf-var, that one will be used. And obviously
the engines find the right file below texmf-var anyway.

i dunno about the current situation, but in the past it was possible to have two files ls-r and ls-R (btw i think on all platforms it should be ls-r i.e. lowercase like most of the files in the tree) and i even noticed kpse loading both files then

I'm confused, because in teTeX "the tools" (i.e. texconfig-sys,
updmap-sys --$edit_option) put the changed files in TEXMFSYSCONFIG, not
TEXMFSYSVAR, and I am not aware of differences between teTeX and TeX
Live in this respect.  Only the automatically generated files
(e.g. updmap's output and the format dumps) are in TEXMFSYSVAR.  So
pdftexconfig.tex seems to be at the right place.  

Where is actually XDvi?

the following is from a fresh 070128-live install.

/usr/local/texlive/2007$ find . -name fmtutil.cnf
./texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
./texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

/usr/local/texlive/2007$ kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

but the one in texmf-var is the relevant one for the user, tweaking the
other has no effect.

> So pdftexconfig.tex seems to be at the right place.

now i get:

/usr/local/texlive/2007$ find . -name pdftexconfig.tex
./texmf-var/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex
./texmf/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex

/usr/local/texlive/2007$ kpsewhich pdftexconfig.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex

i can't confirm right now that the 2nd is indeed used.

> Where is actually XDvi?

$ find . -name XDvi
./texmf-var/xdvi/XDvi
./texmf/xdvi/XDvi

and the 1st one should be used, ok, just not shown by kpsewhich.

I have two objections to this argument:

(1) If tlpmgui's automatic guessing the correct mode (installation vs
maintenance) is intended to help avoiding with old / incomplete TeX
installations I find the current behavior not ver y helpful: Since
tlpmgui does not provide any hint what has it caused to start
maintenance instead of installation mode I thus only know that
"something went worng" and nothing more. A more verbose message with
more details (something like "ther is alread a TEX in Path ..." or so)
would be in my opinion much more helpful.

(2) Beside point (1): In my opinion every powerful tool should be an
expert mode where the user has all available options under his
control. Of course for such a power a price has to be paid: You are in
the risk to damage soething or even everything It's just the mode "I
know what I am doing". This is one important reason why I prefer under
UNIX the archaic "install-tl.sh" for TeXLive setup. (And, by the way,
for the very same reason I would never use GNOME although I always
recommend it to UNIX / Linux newbies.)

I would be very happy if this behaviour could be phased out.

For what I think are very obvious reasons, I prefer to
keep executables and data in very different locations,
and in practice on separate partitions and even on separate
hard drives.  The present system (which is admittedly
no different to Microsoft's equally insane view of the
world) perpetuates the philosophy that it is normal
for both programs and data to share the same space;
IMHO, this is an ill-conceived idea which should be
phased out as quickly as possible.

(I currently don't have a fresh install, and not even a Debian package
of TL 2007, because Norbert just managed to build it and I didn't have
time to check it out)

> /usr/local/texlive/2007$ find . -name fmtutil.cnf
> ./texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
> ./texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

Have you actually changed fmtutil.cnf with "fmtutil --edit" or
"texconfig-sys formats", or is this included in the default install?  I
guess it's in the default install, the edit tools will create new files
in texmf-config.  But I also think only one makes sense in the default
install, and it should probably be the one generated from texmf.in at
compile time.

> /usr/local/texlive/2007$ kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
> /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf

Hm, behavior seems to differ here, in teTeX-3.0 this commands gives no
output at all, in TL 2005 it's the same as in 2007.  The correct command
would need a --format='web2c files':

frank at sid:~$ kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
frank at sid:~$ kpsewhich --format='web2c files' fmtutil.cnf
/home/frank/.texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
frank at sid:~$ 

Of course the last one, the one in $TEXMFCONFIG, should be found when I
actually call fmtutil as user.

> but the one in texmf-var is the relevant one for the user, tweaking the

Yes, because TEXMFSYSVAR comes before TEXMFMAIN - but that doesn't
necessarily mean that the file in TEXMFSYSVAR is actually the correct
one.  I think texmf-var is the wrong location, the shipped file should
be in TEXMFMAIN (/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf), after making changes it
should be in TEXMF(SYS)CONFIG.

I think there's no search path defined for xdvi (nothing points to
$TEXMF/xdvi), only font specific search paths used by xdvi.

Hi!

I'm currently testing TexLive 20070128 and discovered that the Kurier

I get all the support files, but not the actual fonts.

There is an iwona.zip on the CD image, but no kurier.zip.

You should not consider texmf trees as data but as a part of the
program. The executable must know how to find texmf.cnf. Once it is
found it can instruct to look for files whenever you wish. If you have
several versions of TL installed, You just put the correct directory
to the beginning of PATH and everything will then work. If you assume
that the texmf.cnf file is somewhere else, you have to set the
TEXMFCNF environment variable (I hope that it still exists, at least
it is recognized in the OS/2 port).

Other distributions of tex do similar things, they assume that files
are located somewhere. We get too many bug reports caused by TL
installed over another incomplete TeX distribution and conflicts
between binaries resulting from that.

But they /are/ data, and should be treated as such.  Indeed,
I would go further : the basic TEXMF structure should be
read-only data; the TEXMFVAR structure should be read/write.
And TEXMFLOCAL (I have never used TEXMFHOME) should be write-
locked but easily unlockable/relockable if one needs to add
packages.  It is not at /all/ clear to me why one might want
to "pretend" that the TEXMF structure is in any way at all
a part of the program, and it is equally unclear why the
installer believes that I want the executable installed somewhere
unde TEXMF.  All other programs are installed under

	E:\Layered products\<Family>

and that is where I would like PdfeTeX.exe and its ilk to
go, not (as happens at the moment) under

	F:\Data files\TeX

That's quite difficult to answer, because my perceptions are
blurred by the passage of time.  I am reasonably confident that
there /was/ a time when I used MikTeX, but I seem to recall that
I ran into some problems which I was unable to solve.  I therefore
consulted Sebastian (he and Chris Rowley are the two people to
whom I turn when I am /really/ stuck), and he advised that I
migrate to TeX Live.  This I did, and I have never looked back.
The support for TeX Live is second to none : Sebastian, Fabrice,
Karl -- to name but three -- have never failed to try to offer
advice when something has gone wrong, and even if some things
have turned out to be impossible (such as some of the
installation options under Fabrice's installer, which simply
couldn't cope with the way I wanted to set things up), there
has never been a situation in which I have felt that things
might have been better had I stuck with MikTeX.

But perhaps I should add one observation : were it not for
Aleksander Simonic's willingness to /support/ TeX Live
under WinEDT, things might have turned out very differently :
as far as I am concerned, my basic requirements are WinEDT,
PdfeTeX, and Adobe Acrobat.  So long as these three work,
and I can add (for example) Claudio Beccari's Greek fonts
without major difficulty, then I have everything that I need.

By doing that it is sufficient just set PATH. If you have several
versions of TL installed and you wish to process your old document by
TL2004 (e.g. because some packages heve been updated in an
incompatible way and your old document does not work with the latest
TL) you just modify PATH. If *.exe is not under TEXMF, you will also
have to set TEXMFCNF, or you must always get to sources and compile
them so that your paths are hard-coded as your personal default. It
would be more error prone for normal users.

I always prefer if related files are together. If I wish to remove TL,
I just remove one tree, not files from several trees. If I want to
instruct my OS where TL is installed, I set one environment variable,
not dozen of them pointing to several parts of one distribution. When
I want to switch between two versions, I prefer to change one
variable, not dozen (I would hardly remember what has to be changed
and how).

If you wish a real example, I can give you one. There is incompatible
change in textpath from PSTricks. My old files do not work with the
latest version and unfortunatelly I have not saved the version under
which it worked.

Currently scheme-context contains a lot of Package/* dependencies, I
guess it would be easier to do the above, ie add only those three
dependencies. The rest should be automatic. No?

Yes, that was intentional as we are short of space on  "inst" CD.
Please note that Kurier is only an example how fonts were made
many years ago, and Iwona is usable nowadays variant derived from Kurier.
Those (very few) fans of such fonts can have it from CTAN ready to unzip
in texmf tree.

well, then don't spent time on my irrelevant comments ... since i was commenting on ls-r and triggered by lower/upercase remarks and remembered a related problem 

Akira, 

can you look into this?

>kpsewhich --debug=2 texnansi.enc
kdebug:hash_lookup(TEXMFDBS.kpsewhich) => (nil)
kdebug:hash_lookup(TEXMFDBS) => $TEXMF;$VARTEXFONTS

kdebug:hash_lookup(TEXMFLOG.kpsewhich) => (nil)
kdebug:hash_lookup(TEXMFLOG) => (nil)
kdebug:c:/data/develop/tex/texmf-fonts/ls-R: 4910 entries in 253 directories (0 hidden).
kdebug:ls-R hash table:15991 buckets, 3385 nonempty (21%); 4910 entries, average chain 1.5.
kdebug:c:/data/develop/tex/texmf-fonts/ls-r: 4910 entries in 253 directories (0 hidden).
kdebug:ls-R hash table:15991 buckets, 3385 nonempty (21%); 9820 entries, average chain 2.9.

the kpse lsr related format has two entries, ls-r and ls-R and it looks like the file is loaded twice 

but then, i may be completely wrong

I don't understand what you want to say here - but for sure on Linux
the distinction between data and programs as described by Phil has a
long tradition, is mandated by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and is
usually followed quite strictly.  Not to forget that TeX Live has
inherited from teTeX a build configuration that allows it to be easily
adapted to this separation: binaries end up in /usr/bin, data in
/usr/share/texmf*, variable stuff in /var/lib/texmf.

This is a valid argument.  However I'm not sure whether normal users
actually install different versions in parallel, or whether it's not
equally "normal" to want separate partitions for programs and data.

It seems the installer needs an uninstall option...

Thanks for the information.
In fact I'm using Iwona thus I didn't actually miss Kurier, I was just 
surprised that the map files are there. Maybe they should go as well?

Windows users are accustomed to Add/Remove programs so an unistall

I think that is intended by Olaf. On mono-case file system, ls-R and
ls-r are the same, thus being read twice.
I refer a part of Olaf's code:

#ifndef DB_NAME
#define DB_NAME "ls-R"
#endif
#ifndef DB_NAME_LC
#define DB_NAME_LC "ls-r"
#endif

static const_string db_names[] = {
    DB_NAME,
    DB_NAME_LC,
    NULL
};

Best regards,
Akira

I think that Zdenek is referring to *x-based systems here;
for Windows users, I do not believe that the installer
attempts to set or to re-set ACLs at all, leaving the
entire Windows TEXMF hierarchy very vulnerable.

Microsoft do /not/ set a good example in this respect
(as I suggested in my previous message), but there
is no reason (IMHO) why we need to follow their lead
rather than attempt a clean separation of program from
data, and read-only data from read-write.

This is a bit off-topic, but since you asked:


There is one strong reason why I *love* MikTeX - automatic recognition
of missing files and automatic installation of them:

- If one runs "texexec" for example, MikTeX figures out that ConTeXt
is not installed on the system and installs it on the fly

- Insead of "metric (TFM) not found" or "file not found, please type
another name:" errors, which are common on practically any other TeX
distribution, the necassary package gets installed on the fly. (Most
newbies have no idea what to do when something like that happens
anyway.)

That way MikTeX can be held "reasonably" small after the first
installation, while still covering "every" TeX package. One doesn't
need to sacrifice 2GB to compile a simple LaTeX document. (And since
it's so widespread, it's probably well supported by many LaTeX
editors. I cannot say much about that since I don't use any of those
any more.)

Also, a lot of work has been devoted for improving Yap (dvi viewer).

*******
I'm really looking forward to the day when the abovementioned
functionality will be available on every TeX distribution ;)
*******


Some drawbacks of MikTeX that I experienced:

- Packages are really up-to-date (if authors upload them on CTAN), but
it takes quite some time before a new binary is available - I remember
that I needed to wait for a long time before MikTeX got rid of pdfTeX
1.21a which didn't support transparent PNGs, it will take another year
before XeTeX will be available, and I have no idea how long it will
take before MikTeX will support luatex ...

- Since MikTeX is not compatible with other distributions, it's not
that easy to simply take a binary from another distribution (like I
took XeTeX from Akira's W32TeX and it worked out-of-the-box with
standalone ConTeXt). Also, settings are controlled in a different way
than in "standard TeX distr.", but that's just a question of which
distribution you're used to, you cannot call that a drawback.

- Some more, but not worth mentioning.

And: MikTeX is straightforward to download and install. Downloading
2GB for TeXLive might be slightly less convenient, plus no automatic
updates etc.

I wish I would be able to tell you more about TeXLive, but when I
tried to install it last year, it didn't work (it might have been due
to the fact that my DVD reader didn't support double layer DVDs, I
don't really know). And when I tried to install it two weeks ago, it
caused me some problems as well.

I used a combination of MikTeX and standalone ConTeXt (if one failed
to work, the other one did the job or vice versa).

well, i consider that a bug then; why should the file be read twice ... 
since lsr loading time is not neglectable with big trees, i suggest to 
just read one of them

on a case-insensitive filesystems, a search for "ls-R" should always
find the file, even if it is named "ls-r", right?

why, then, include both files into the db_names? it should just
contain "ls-R" in all cases.

There are situations where the Single Tree (ST) approach is helpful
(so you can switch between TL2003, ..., TL2007) simply by updating the
path, and situations where it is helpful to follow the "Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard" (FHS).   Note that for this to be realistic, ST
needs static linking, while the people who advocate FHS also tend to
need dynamic linking.

Certainly nobody is in favor of a system that doesn't allow removing a
TL installation.  With the ST approach, you can just "rm -r" the tree.
 With FHS most people need a package manager (rpm, dpkg, etc.) or
chaos will happen.  TeX is a difficult problem for most existing
package managers (on SGI, there was a freeware teTeX package that
depended on every other 3rd party package in the known universe, so
you needed gigabytes of disk and days of installing just to be able to
run "tex story").  The ST model has the advantage that it can be
installed on lots of platforms.

This thread started with the problem of locating an existing tex
installation for an ST  package manager.  It would be nice to have FHS
packages for TL, but I think the most that TL can do is ensure FHS and
related needs (dynamic linking) can be accommodated without forking,
and that TL can be used as a teTeX replacement (e.g., doesn't badly
break existing docs that compile with tetex).

There is another goal that needs to be mentioned more often: avoiding
things that will create confusion among users and raise noise levels
on c.t.t, etc.  There is a problem
with ST TL being installed in parallel with other TeX systems.  I see
system with parts of Y&Y TeX, 4allTeX, MikTeX, etc either incompletely
removed, or copied from some old machine after some document failed to
compile with the current TeX.  The ST approach has the advantage that
it can be made to work in the presence of such remnant installs.
FHS installers can't all be trusted with uninstall, while 'rm -f' can
be usually be trusted to remove everything the user hoped to remove
and more besides.

Only if the search is case-insensitive.  This will be the case when an
actual attempt is made to open the file, but not necessarily so when
the information about the presence of the file is derived in some
other manner, like listing a directory.

Yes, I have for years parallel TeX installations both under Win32 and
under *NIX--and, with some care, without any problems. But I
complained that the current tlpmgui prevents me from installing
another TL in parallel to an existing TeX installation without doing
some nasty tricks.

I understand that many users want an automatic mechanism which ensures
that there are not conflicts between a TL they are about to install
and existing TeX installations (or installation fragments). But I do
_not_ understand why there should not be an expert mode that allows me
to force things in a way I want-- when I am willing to pay the price
to get a ruined system (something like being "root" under *NIX). Such
a possibly dangerous expert mode may start with a bold warning that I
am about to kill my pet or destroy the world ... but I _want_ to have
the choice.

It is exactly those philosophy of Windows to defend the user from
himself which is one of the main reasons not to use a Windows system
if I have a choice.

in case of the "ls-R" file, its presence is tested by attempting to
access the file, thus it should work on both case-insensitive and
case-sensitive filesystems if the access is made to "ls-R" (the latter
is created by mktexlsr).

$ strace kpsewhich plain.tex 2>&1 | grep -i ls-r
access("/home/vvv/texmf/ls-R", R_OK)    = 0
stat64("/home/vvv/texmf/ls-R", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=9849, ...}) = 0
access("/home/vvv/texmf/ls-r", R_OK)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

stat64("/var/lib/texmf/ls-R", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=776, ...}) = 0

stat64("/usr/share/texmf-texlive/ls-R", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=321347, ...}) = 0
access("/usr/share/texmf-texlive/ls-r", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/home/vvv/texmf/ls-R", O_RDONLY)  = 3
read(3, "% ls-R -- filename database for "..., 8192) = 8192
open("/var/lib/texmf/ls-R", O_RDONLY)   = 3
read(3, "% ls-R -- filename database for "..., 8192) = 776
open("/usr/share/texmf/ls-R", O_RDONLY) = 3
read(3, "% ls-R -- filename database for "..., 8192) = 8192
open("/usr/share/texmf-texlive/ls-R", O_RDONLY) = 3
read(3, "% ls-R -- filename database for "..., 8192) = 8192

i see that even on unix systems it wastes time trying to look for
"ls-r" which doesn't make sense.

what should happen is it should look only for "ls-R" on all platforms,
and "mktexlsr" should always create "ls-R" (and remove "ls-[Rr]"
before that).

    surprised that the map files are there. Maybe they should go as well? 

The only kurier-related files I see now are the support files that are
part of context, tex4ht, and vntex.  They do no harm, and since they are
installed independently of the original kurier, it doesn't really make
sense to delete them.

As I guess you figured out, the first two were included via packages,
rather than collections, so the installer did not know about them.

Ok, since you researched it, I changed scheme-context.tpm to be just
those three collections.  Hopefully it will work out for whomever is
actually using scheme-context (if anyone).

Phil -- if you want to put the binaries in directory x and the texmf
trees in directory y, feel free to do so, and adjust your texmf.cnf
accordingly.

I have always thought this sort of thing would be useful to support in
the installer (not to mention lots of other things), although
implementing it is not exactly trivial, nor anywhere near the top of my
list.  (Not that changing the Unix installer will help you anyway, I
gather.)

However, the default installation of everything in one tree is not going
to change, as long as I have anything to say about it.  I understand
that you think it's bogus, but nevertheless it is a very useful
arrangement for lots of other people, including me :).  Sorry.

Karl

Just a note - on the very good advice of someone on this list, I set it
up differently. I made a user called texlive (imaginative, eh?) and that
user is the one with write permission on the tex trees.

An added bonus to this is that I do not have to add the bin/i386-linux
to roots path in order to administer the texlive system. But the real
benefit is that administration of texlive involving either a user error
or a software bug can only result in damage to the texlive system, and
never the operating system or user data.

In Fedora, "normal" users do what the OS installer offers to do by
default, which is usually a separate /boot and then a single volume
group using all remaining space split into two logical volumes - one for
swap and one for the rest of the filesystem.

Personally I think that scheme is garbage, as it makes a clean install
require restoring user data from backup - and the Fedora installer could
do a better job. root partition should generally need no more than a 6
GB lvm and THAT'S being generous IMHO. If server packages that serve
content from outside a home directory are to be installed (like MySQL or
posgresql) then a LV for /srv should be created. A LV for /home should
definitely be created.

It's hard for an installer to accurately guess how big they should be,
but that's the beauty of LVM - it does not have to guess. Go small and
leave the rest of the volume group unused. The user can grow /home
and/or /srv as needed.

When noobies pay me to help them install, I set it up that way and
explain to them why - and I set up /home to be 1GB. Before I leave, I
have them go into the LVM manager (fedora has a nice gui tool) and
grow /home so that they know how.

But that's nothing to do with texlive.
I like that texlive can be all on one partition, even if it breaks TDS
compliance. Let the OS vendors worry about TDS compliance in their
repackaging (where they should).

pushd /texlive

popd

works for me. :)

Hi,

just an observation; maybe the following could be some cause of
differing binaries with successive Build runs: When i go into e. g.
pdftex with vi editor, there are lots of stuff like:

so it seems that some path parameters go into the binary. If they are
taken from expanded texmf.cnf during compile time, a change of texmf.cnf
in the repository might result in different binaries.

BTW, when i copy pdftex to another user's home, there is still
/home/hahe/Build/source... in the built-in search path. So this search
path from compile time will go onto the DVDs also (for no use, but it
doesn't hurt either).

True, and I did change texmf.in in some small way, as I recall.  Not
that it makes any difference in practice.

    So this search path from compile time will go onto the DVDs also
    (for no use, but it doesn't hurt either).

Right.  I discussed this with Reinhard and Norbert.  It's not entirely
clear how to clean it up, because that fallback path is actually
relevant in the Debian (etc.) builds.  We decided it was best to "do
nothing".

Well, tlpmgui v. 1.69 introduces --install-mode option to force 
installation, but it is not documented. I do not know where to put such
information (except, of course, tlpmgui's help).
Please note that for most windows users even starting such program
with an option is not so straightforward (they are just used to clicking
program name or icon). Again, guessing if the user has any existing,
or not completely unistalled, or perhaps broken previous TeX installation
it is not so easy task. So what more can be done? 
Please note also that most disputants here are in fact good system
hackers, but we have to think about ordinary, not so advanced users and 
they rarely have many TeX installations.

Best,

I would suggest, "Work within the Windows paradigm".  Since (as
you correctly say) most W32 users would not know how to create
a shortcut which added a parameter to the launch command, why
not make "--install-mode" a GUI-selectable option rather than
a command-line parameter ?

Message-ID: <200702030019.l130JtR01959@tug.org>

I received new powerpc-linux binaries from Thomas Schmitz and checked in
just pdftex, pdftosrc, and xetex.  Maybe get a full set tomorrow, maybe
not.  In any case, I think this is ok.

I'm rebuilding the images now.  In the absence of more horrible bugs, I
think this can be the final one.

Due to urgent family matters, I will be offline at least most of
tomorrow.  Possibly I will be able to check in towards the end of the
day and do one more build if it's needed, still in time for Manfred's
Sunday wish, but I'm not sure at this point.

Thanks everyone,
Karl

Two apparent problems:
1) On the Feb 1 image, with the setuptl directory replaced with the svn revision
3863, tlmpgui produces an error when I say yes to installing ghostscript and 
dviout. Environment variables were set for gs, but the corresponding directories were not created. Dviout was installed in the TeX Live directory, but no other items were added to that directory. 

On my system, the variables TMP and TEMP are set as system variables. However, our default profiles override those variables in User variables. The system setting for TEPM is C:\WINDOWS\TEMP. A hidden folder C:\WINDOWS\Temp exists, but not one called TEMP. The user override is 
%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp . %USERPROFILE% points to a directory with the user's login name in C:\Documents and Settings.
 
2) I still get an error when I try to install with the TEMP environment variable set to the same as TMP is User variables. When I set TEMP to C:\, I get an error that various files cannot be opened in that directory. After a successful install after clearing the User variables set by the installer and deleting the texmf-local directory and the TexLive2007 directory, I was no longer able to re-install. This time I got errors that various files in C:/WINDOWS/Temp/ could not be opened.


Here is the message I get when gs install fails: 
unable to open key: Access is denied.
unable to open key: Access is denied.

Subject: [tex-live] Some tests with tlpmgui on win32/linux
Message-ID: <45C44834.2090608@erlenweg.de>

Hello

I used version 20070122.01 and 20070128.03 of INST CD and did
some tests on several machines with XP SP2 - fresh installs and long
running installations.

The installation with tlpmgui is straight forward and smooth. The
resulting environment is OK and so is the PATH.

This kind of installation is really easy and painless. Thanks very much.
Deinstallation was ok too.

Basic tests on latex, pdflatex,... did not show problems.

Here some further remarks:

- Package wintools was checked for installation but did not install. I
had to add it as package in maintenance mode.

- When installing with TLroot=c:\texlive2007 (the default setting) we
end up with two directories c:\texlive2007 and c:\texmf-local. This does
not look nice to me. The linux version (.\texlive\2007 and
.\texlive\texmf-local) should be realized on windows too.

- Installation ends up with three PATH entries for win32, dviout and gs.
When I checked dviout and gs for installation I had some hope to get
versions of that  programs integrated into /bin/win32 as in TL2003 or so.

- texmf-var/web2c holds now subdirectories and files. This is ugly. But
may be there are some reasons to do so...

- Instead of manually searching for latex.fmt et. al. I used 'kpsewhich
latex.fmt' - but got no answer!

- The situation with $HOME does not please me.
In earlier years the user had to set the environment variable home to
whatever he wants and had to build some private tree like
texmf/tex/latex/myproject. That was all.
The absense of the environment variable HOME did not really hurt.
The way to fill the environment variable was described in texlive doc.

Now this is no longer possible as texmf.cnf does no longer integrate
TEXMFHOME into TEXMF and/or SYSTEXMF.
Update from 20070128.03: TEXMFHOME is back and part of TEXMF, but mapped
to TEXMFLOCAL. Now it is more easy to explain how to handle a privat
tree. But this needs editing texmf.cnf, so:

- tlpmgui should allow editing texmf.cnf

- tlpmgui in maintenance mode does not show which TL-installation it
will try to modify. I expect that the environment variable TLroot is
used to find TL on the disk. But I am not sure.
With linux I had to move the old binaries from TL2005 out of the PATH to
get the installation mode. Otherwise tlpmgui would come up in
maintenance mode and tries to handle my TL2005.
On a Opensuse box tlpmgui tries to maintain the original tetex installation.

Thank you for TeXLive

Where does that path come from?  I'm surprised that it is of any use for
Debian, since it will usually be something like

/tmp/buildd/texlive-bin-2007/Build/source/...

i have all stuff in /home/hahe/tex-live/Build/... so that's what one
sees in the binary. Build doesn't happen here in /tmp, i just cd into
~/tex-live/Build/source and type ./Build.

Yes, of course.  What I'd like to know is

- which setting in texmf.in or somewhere else gets expanded to the
  current working directory

- why this helps us Debianists.

Thank you very much.  I think that TeXLive's main drawback is that
peolpe have to download the whole thing unless they have the CD/DVD.
Maybe this can be solved in the future.

Maybe Christian Schenk helps people too if they ask him.  But
nevertheless, a big advantage of TeXLive (on Windows) is that it can
be customized without changing the registry.  This is, in my opinion,
significantly easier.  See also TUGBoat 27/1, pages 24...25.

Because then everyone will have the CD/DVD?  We are on a good path to

ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/Images/test when it's finished.

I'm not absolutely sure I got this right, but it looks good so far.

(In a weak moment I deleted the iso by accident after creating the
.jigdo file, so I can't just have it scanned and shorten this procedure)

Downloading from scratch via jigdo is quite slow (compared to
downloading the iso image). I suppose, that's because of the overhead in
wgetting tens of thousands of files.

How many files do change between Tex Live releases? I guess quite a lot
of documentation, TeX and LaTeX itself and so on stays the same and
jigdo might have some value if you possess an earlier Tex Live version
after all?

Is there an rsync-Server for Tex Live? It would be nice if I could
"upgrade" this resulting test image to the final Tex Live 2007 when it's
released.

Until August 2006 we used MiKTeX at school and at home. Unfortunately
MiKTeX 2.5 does not work in our school-network an so we switched to
TeXLive. This runs without any problems.

At home I'm still using MiKTeX. My reason is the Update- and
Package-Manager. As I read here, this will be a feature in TeXLive2007
and so a think a will switc h to TeXLive at home too.

afaik that kind of path crap has always been part of the binaries; i think that's related to this autoparent, autodir and similar magic variables; it normally does not hurt (on windows one also gets thee paths); the only downside is that they may sometimes slow down a search

I've heared from Windows users that there had been problems with
MikTeX 2.5 and MikTeX 2.4 had been removed from the server before the
problems had been solved.  I suppose that 2.5 works now but I'm not a
Windows user and can only geuss.

No, it will not be a feature in TL-2007.  I considered it but had not
enough time to do it.  I hacked the UNIX installer some time ago in
order to install packages from the net.  It worked somehow but much
more has to be done until it is really usable.

BTW., did someone notice

  TeX-Team <texsupport at werdenfels-gymnasium.de>

in the mail header?

It's a grammar school (british) or a high school (american).  It's
really great that such a school has a TeX support team which even
maintains a mailing list.  Quite amazing!

I fear that these guys will be very disappointed when they leave
school and go to a university.  TeX support at universities is often
***much*** worse, in many cases it is even quite crappy.  

Anyway, everybody is invited to join

   http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

I'm looking forward to see many young people on this list.

One reason for MikTeX's popularity may be that TeXnicCenter and
WinEdit configure themselves almost automatically for MikTeX.
TeXnicCenter appears to consult the registry for this; I didn't
check WinEdt.

MikTeX has GUI tools for at least some configuration, so
end users don't have to access the registry directly.

Don't construct this as a defense of the registry. I consider it an
insane, evil invention.

Of course, for a shared network install you want a preconfigured
user installation, and then GUI tools aren't much help.  For MikTeX
2.5 things were a bit harder than for MikTeX 2.4, and I have heard
of other people who gave up on MikTeX 2.5 for a network install.

Hi Thomas,

    I read "If you are able and willing to make TeX Live also available via
    jigdo, please email." on the web site and thought I could give it a try.

Thanks!

    Downloading from scratch via jigdo is quite slow

Hmm.  My understanding was that jigdo is something like bittorrent, ie,
if the image propagates around to many sites, the net download time is a
lot faster.  (Not to mention decreasing the load on the central server.)
Is that wrong?

    How many files do change between Tex Live releases? 

Lots, probably most.  It's not presently set up to be downloaded
partially or in combination with older releases.

    Is there an rsync-Server for Tex Live? 

Sure, rsync tug.org::
will list the rsync modules I've set up.

    "upgrade" this resulting test image to the final Tex Live 2007 when it's

The final image should be done within days or less, but the only
"upgrade" is to download the new image ...

Thanks,
Karl

Too soon, it didn't work. :-/

I had overseen that http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/ is
TL2005, of course. And http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/testlive/ which I
would have needed is empty.

As far as I understand it, it's wrong, yes. But I would like to be
contradicted.

Jigdo works like this:

I put up a template file describing which file with which checksum is
located where in the iso image.

And I put up a jigdo file, describing which servers do have those files
that are contained in the iso image.

The thing is that everyone who uses this jigdo file uses the same fixed
set of servers and, worse, any single file can be mapped to only one
server. (see this mail[1]). So there will be no real load-balancing. The
only thing possible seems to be to split the load between servers in a
fixed scheme. Something like "get files 1 thru 10000 from mirror 1,
files 10001 thru 20000 from mirror 2 and so on).

So with my jigdo file (which I have taken down in the meantime) I was
getting all the files from ftp.tug.org. So, no load advantage.

And tens of thousands of wget invocations.

If most of the files (in http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/)
will change between TL2005 and TL2007, it probably isn't worth it. I'll
do it nonetheless, but it's nothing that should really be advertised,
because people won't be able to use a good part of their TL2005 DVD and
just download the changed files, if almost all the files change between
releases.

If, on the other hand, many files stay the same, fine, let people
assemble their TL2007 using TL2005.

The really interesting thing about jigdo is not load balancing, but
reusing existing files.

If you publish the files via FTP/HTTP (or whatever), as you do at
http://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texlive/, you do not necessarily
need to waste the space to have them once more in the iso image. You
just give people a recipe to bake their cake using those ingredients.

But even if jigdo were useful in TeX Live context (which it might be; I
could get quite a lot of files from the TL2005 directory), bittorrent is
much more important, because many people know it.

And an issue with bittorrent came up today at de.comp.text.tex:

http://tug.org/texlive says "TeX Live is now available via bittorrent,
by http or utp."

I don't have the slightest clue, what "utp" might be :-), but
"bittorrent" links to www.bittorrent.com which isn't to helpful if you
want to get the image. It should link to a torrent file (or better, a
web page listing torrent files for live and inst).

"http", on the other hand, doesn't link to a web server serving the
image, but to a torrent tracker, or so it seems:

|Can't send torrent
|
| Non-registered visitors are limited to newer torrents only.
| To download torrents older than a few days, you must register.
| 
| Registration to this website is absolutely free.
| 
| Click here to go to the registration page
| or
| Click here to go back

The registration page says "To avoid running out of resources, the
public registrations are closed. We open the registrations from time to
time, usually on fridays (GMT), so please check back later."

I suggest setting up an own tracker or using a public tracker.

Hi,
one problem we programmers have with TL is that once the images are
pressed on DVDs/CDs, we have no chance of getting our bugfixes to the
users.

But it shouldn't be to difficult to offer updated binaries for
download; since we have svn we could even branch a TL2007 and use that
for tracking sources and binaries.

Comments?

Thanks.

    we have to think about ordinary, not so advanced users and 
    they rarely have many TeX installations.

It seems to me the new option is helpful *exactly* for the ordinary users
who already have some version of TeX installed.  This way, they can try
out the new version without uninstalling the old one.
--install_mode is a lot less obscure way of doing that than something
like "rename c:\myoldtex\bin\win32\tex c:\myoldtex\bin\win32\tex.skip",
which seemed like the only available workaround.

I understand that the installer will change PATH and environment
variables, so it's not seamless to get back to the existing system after
the new installation.  But at least it is possible.

Thanks again,

The gwTeX TL subset still has a small part that is copied from the

All the encodings are avaiable in TL, but not all the maps.

I have looked at the maps and noticed that the following map files

Ah, I see.  Thanks for the explanation.  In this case, it seems dubious
to me that much advantage will be gained for TeX Live for normal users.
We update the ISO image once a year or so, and lots of the files change.

    I don't have the slightest clue, what "utp" might be :-), 

I was copying from the mail the bittorent volunteer sent me; now that I
look at it again, I expect it's a typo for udp.

    "http", on the other hand, doesn't link to a web server serving the

Drat.  All I did was post what the fellow (Steve Humber) sent me; it
probably worked back then, but apparently no more.  I don't have the
means to check it out myself, I know very little about bittorrent.  I'll
write him and we'll go from there.

Since you're opening the topic: are dvipdfm/context/lm-math.map (and
other dvipdfm map files) already part of gwTeX? Because other users
have problems using XeTeX without those files. These map files are not
part of fonts packages themselves (yet?), but as far as I understood
they were added by Taco to make the Polish fonts usable for XeTeX
under TeXLive. (Using those old fonts under XeTeX doesn't make much
sense anyway - ConTeXt will hopefully replace the definitions soon,
but for math there is really no alternative yet.)

I guess that it was renamed into antt-ec.map now, the latex package
was written by the authors (so for LaTeX there should be no problem)
and ConTeXt package knows about the new map file.

Same pattern for all of them:
    antt-cs.map
    antt-exp.map
etc.

All those files are currently missing in gwTeX. (Font files are
present, but map files have wrong names - I actually tried to compile
an example and the font is indeed "broken". But I usually need to
incude another TeX tree anyway, since gwTeX is missing some fonts such
as Iwona, so I didn't notice that Antykwa was actually present but
non-functional.)

They seem to be in /fonts/map/dvips/cs (please check if all the fonts
are included there). ConTeXt doesn't use them.

/fonts/map/dvips/pl - same as above

Not sure, but /fonts/map/dvips/cm might have replaced them - please
check; ConTeXt doesn't use those

This entry in original-base.map replaced it:
    contnav ContextNavigation          <contnav.pfb
You may safely delete that file.

Taco might need to answer. Files replacing that one are part of

One of the ways it is nice is that a server does not need to mirror the
iso to be used. It only needs to mirror the contents of the dvd.

So a user can set a preferred location to a mirror close to them even if
that mirror does not have the actual DVD.

Are there mirrors that only contain the packages? That's why it is so
good for Debian.

Ah yes, you're right. I don't know why I didn't think of that; I even
specified a mirror for the Debian DVD I downloaded some weeks ago.

So yes, you get load-balancing, if the users co-operate.

No, and there is not much that could be done with them, either.
This all part of the (lack of) package infrastructure issue.

All *-antt.map had been replaced by a single antt.map.
vnr.map had been split into vnrtext.map and vnrother.map (in order to
make it easier to replace VNR by Latin Modern).
I suppose that Lucida support files are not in TL because they are
distributed with the fonts.

You really scared me for a moment ...

I thought that the whole Antykwa Torunska was broken for ConTeXt users
of TeXLive. After that I've noticed that antt.map is only a
"duplicate" of the original files.

For Gerben this means: either the rest of the antt files has to be
included [as well], not only antt.map, or ConTeXt needs to be fixed
(but it works OK on other distributions).

(PS: it would be really nice to include iwona as well. But since you
don't accept user requests any more, it's really up to you.)

Hi,

I am testing texlivetest2007-inst-20070204.iso on an Intel Mac
machine running Mac OS X 10.4.8. Here are some problems I
encountered.

1.
After starting install-tl.sh, B option shows:

Available sets of binaries:
  i386_linux: Intel x86 with GNU/Linux
  powerpc_darwin: PowerPC with MacOSX/Darwin
  win32: Windows

Why there is no i386_darwin? I wonder.

2.
S option in S option (aka. Press <S> to see collections for this scheme),
did shows the collections of the scheme, but it disappeared at once,
why? I'm using Terminal.app.

3.
in C option, some text is cutted, for example:

I [X] Miscellaneous extra generic m
M [ ] LaTeX support for the humanit
Z [ ] Packages for drawings graphic

It that possible to remove this limitation?

4. If install-tl.sh is not running with sudo, it will not complain until
it start trying to make directory and copy files, I think this behavior
can be improved.

Regards,
jjgod.

Oop, sorry, I did not see the follow text at first:

===> WARNING: No binaries for this platform on CD! <===
There was not enough space, sorry.  (``no enough''?)

BTW, IMHO we might consider replace ppc_darwin with i386_darwin
in inst images, since Apple already done the Intel Mac transition for a
year.

I am told that the dvipdfm map files will be part of the next
releases of the font sets, but that would be too late for texlive,
and that is why I added the files to context provisionally.
gwTeX probably should use the files in some way.

I do not know much more about that file than you do. I did not
create the map file, I only converted the actual fonts.

These fonts are used by the latex package mflogo, Context does
not use them. The map entries are inside dvips/mflogo/mflogo.map.

These fonts are used by the latex package stmaryrd, Context does

We did use at work  MiKTeX up to version 2.4 for a long time. Some
days ago I gave MiKTeX 2.5 a try and was dissatisfied: Much less
customize options during install. Especially I had problems to move so
MiKTeX folders to other than the default locations (for a shared
installation). I have found some rare hints at the Internet, but they
did not work. My last resort was analyzing the source code (I love
open source software!), and then to made some direct registry changes.
Now I would prefer TeXLive much to MiKTeX--even under Win32.

cs.map was for CS-fonts used by CSTeX. Boguslaw Jackowski found bugs
in the Type1 variant and prepared replacements by LM fonts. The map
file was therefore split into several smaller map files. I had no time
to look at the current ISO image but you should find several cs*.map
files containing the same, and lm-rep-cstext.map.

Thank you very much, too, Staszek, for the "--install-mode" option for tlpmgui!

I understand and accept the argument that an ordinary Windows user
want things to be preconfigured in a way he have only to start the
setup program and get the stuff smoothly installed. To ease many
things for non-expert users seems a feature of Windows (ans some Linux
distributions) attracting many non-geek users. But there are at least
2 things of the strategy puzzling me:
(1)
You are in big trouble when something does _not_ automagically work.
Either things are done very easily or can not be done at all.
(2)
The easy-use-strategy seems to tend to exclude more experienced users.
This was my main point in the discussion here. I do not see any
compelling reason why ease for more unexperienced or 'lazy' users does
necessarily  conflict which the _possibility_ to customize all
parameters _on my own risk_. The more I work with some tool the more I
tend shape my preferences concerning this tool. Thus in this way my
desire to customize aspects of the tool accordingly.
(And TeX is such a tool for me.) This seems an important point I miss
in many usability discussions.

At the moment I am about to test the new tlpmgui (vers. 1.72) under
Win32. When finished I will post a report.

Thanks again, Staszek

Well more or less. I mentioned that on Debian we have *cleaned* this
compile time path from the binaries and replaced it with the well known
path the files will have.

But this does work only for binaries with a known destination.

Still, for next year we should hack the code that the compile time
search path does not include some strange directories, but only some
well known locations (/usr/share/texmf/web2c, /u/local/s/t/web2c,
/opt/texlive/texmf/web2c or whatever) plus the usual find in same
hierachy (../share/texmf/web2c, etc)

Best wishes

I didn't research in in depth (ie I didn't make a package counting etc),
but I guess it is still better than what we had.

Subject: [tex-live] tlpmgui 1.72 under Win32
Message-ID: <c8b321820702050301h34cd2eb4l22cd0b223bbf4cfd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have tested TL 20070204 installation at a Win32 (WinXP SP2) box
using tlpmgui version 1,72 included.

I works well (especially the "--install-mode" option!) but I have
noted some glitches, too:
(1)
The Perl collection was installed although I did explicitly uncheck
its entry during customizing the installation. During installation I
were never asked concerning the Perl installation. There is a Perl
alread on the box (ActiveState Perl) with its bin dir included in
%PATH%. I have noticed this behavior in a former tlpmgui version, but
in the meantime the problem vanished. Now I have it back--time seems
indeed running in a loop :-).
(2)
As I noted earlier my "texmf-doc\doc" folder is littered with the
directory structure for all documentation collections although I did
only select base, English and German documentation. Well, only their
"texmf-doc\doc" subfolders actually contain files, but I would like to
not get empty docuemtation folders.
(3)
Finally a nice-to-have: I would like to being able to customize some
more install options by tlpmgui under Win32. Would it be, for
instance, possible to make TL's start menu folder customizable?

I hope these remarks help.

Gerben, I do not know why you cannot just update map files for e.g.
antt (and Iwona) and still play with the old ones (changed about a year 
ago)? Can you follow in MacTeX what we have currently in TL?
 
Thanks,

This stuff was documented in http://docs.miktex.org/2.5/preview.pdf.
In the MikTeX manual you can find some more information by searching
for setupwiz. You can't blame anyone for not finding this, though.

As long as users seem to be happy and as long as I don't run
into insurmountable problems, I'll think twice before making radical
changes.

right, but:

We tried hard and read a lot of information, we consulted the
miktex-users-list - problems remaind unsolved.

We file-rights granted by samba on the network-shares are not sufficient
for miktex/windows. MiKTeX 2.5 needs a FileNameDataBase for every user
an create fonts for every user - primary on the local machine (even
Christian Schenk says that its no good idea to change this.

On the other hand its no good idea to have 1000 FNDB's on the network
and create all fonts 1000 times ...

... an copy this on every login to the local maschine

Until 2.4 this was now problem and i could not imagine they this has to
be changed

as pointed out, we did more than that - spening about two weeks of my
summer holiday in our school-network - trying to become 2.5 runnung

So there are good reasons for making radical changes

I consider these per-user FNDB's, even for shared trees, indeed a very
unfortunate feature of MikTeX. I like TeX Live's ls-R at the root of
every tree much better.

As to fonts: most users go to pdf anyway so this is not a big issue.

You already have 1000 times My Documents and 1000 times Application
Data. A big mess becomes only a little bit bigger.

I am not criticizing. I am merely claiming that a network MikTeX
install is still possible and seems to work ok. I am not even
claiming that it was the best thing to do.

I do not think that making things configurable makes them more
difficult.  The simplest thing an installer can do is to present a
dialog box saying "Install TeXLive to c:\texlive2007? [yes] [no]".

The TeXLive installer actually does the same but provides a file
select box where the install dir can be changed.  It still defaults to
c:\texlive2007.  Though the installer is configurable, it can be used
as easily as in the first example.

You can make everything configurable as long as all default settings
are reasonable, or, with other words, if an ordinary Windows user has
nothing else to do but saying "yes".

This works perfectly for the install directory and I suppose it will
work for other things too.

Regarding tlpmgui, it seems that the software exists for some time but
people just noticed it when the test images had been provided.

The tlpmgui team got a lot of feedback during the last few weeks and
they worked very hard on it, most considerably Tomasz ?uczak (Tomek).

TeXLive will be frozen now and I really hope that Tomek finds some
time to relax.

Regards,
  Reinhard

What users say they want is seldom a reliable guide for software developers.

How many of the packages you use on WIn32 were cross compiled on
linux?  Was the documentation formatted with TeX?

How TL works on *x may be of no immediate interest to you, but
there are benefits to all TeX users from having a reliable, widely
available, TeX system.  Because TeX is used for documentation by many
projects, even people who don't use TeX themselves often rely on
documents created by others or through some automated build system
using TeX.

The recent history of TeX suggests that distributions rarely last more
than a few years.  teTeX was very widely adopted as the basis for TeX
provided with linux distributions, but is no longer being maintained
by the author.  Many TeX distributions, both free (emtex, 4allTeX,
fptex, xemtex) and commercial (FTL and BSR on Apple Mac, Y&Y on
WIndows) are no longer actively maintained.

Some users have suffered a great deal of pain after moving to a newer
OS (e.g., Windows NT to WIndows XP, Apple OS9 to OS X) or because they
are now required to provide PDF versions of documents.  Existing
software didn't meet their requirements and there was no smooth
upgrade path.

There is considerable tension between those who want TeX to be
portable and those working on improvements who just want to get a new
capability working on their platform and don't have resources to deal
with platforms they don't use.   It is a fact of life that there are
significant difference between platforms and real effort is needed to
make things work across a range of platforms.  This effort is
worthwhile because it helps keep a strong, unified TeX community where
new ideas and improvements are widely shared, as opposed to a
fragmented community where ideas and improvements never spread beyond
the users of a particular platform, and where using TeX becomes an
obstacle to switching platforms because your favorite macro package
make heavy use of image formats and \special's specific to your
current platform.

One FAQ is "I need TeX and <programing language du jour> -- what OS
should I use?".   Until now, the answer has been that a reasonable TeX
system is available for most OS's, so the decision should depend on
local site policies the programming tools that are available .

In my view, it is important that TeXLive be a viable successor for
tetex in linux distributions.  Already there are small differences
creeping in (as patches to fix bugs) to some linux distros while
others languish.  Over time, developers will find that documentation
formats on some systems but not others (due to different bugs but also
to differences in supported languages).

Yeah, I spent with Thomas a couple of weeks on that, and nobody complained

do follow TL.

    There was not enough space, sorry.  (``no enough''?)

That image is getting burned on a physical CD, hence the limit.

    replace ppc_darwin with i386_darwin in inst images, 

As I've explained before, my rationale for using powerpc-darwin on the
CD image is that i386-darwin users are presumably nearly certain to have
a usable DVD drive, since i386-darwin is so much newer -- the only
significant reason to use the CD image is if the DVD cannot be read.
Hence it's more likely to be useful to powerpc-darwin users than
i386-darwin users.

    S option in S option (aka. Press <S> to see collections for this scheme),
    did shows the collections of the scheme, but it disappeared at once,
    why? I'm using Terminal.app.

I removed the clear-screen command to try to avoid this.

    in C option, some text is cutted, for example:

It's a tradeoff between vertical and horizontal space.  Not sure it can
be improved in a tty.

    4. If install-tl.sh is not running with sudo, it will not complain
    until it start trying to make directory and copy files, I think this
    behavior can be improved.

There's no way to know whether the installation directories will be
changed when we start up, but we could check if the directories
specified under <d> are writable.  Definitely too hairy to try to
implement that now, but I'll file it for later.

Unchecking the Perl collection will still be ignored. (Why? Is Perl
quietly scheduled for installation for some dependency reasons? I have
checked all collections but Perl and any documentation other than
base, English and German.)
At first glance things then turns to the better: My Perl installation
is correctly detected and I am being asked whether I really want to
install Perl. But sadly a "No" answer to this question is ignored,
too: After install process is finished Perl is installed again despite
my "No" :-(.

You are right, I improved this ugly bug in 1.74

Run tlpmgui with --debug parameter or press F4, then you will be able to 
reprogram tlpmgui via console -- full control in your hands. Console works 
only in Windows.

Once you leave behind the cosy, isolated, highly-protected world of
TeX /qua/ TeX, and move into the real world where the prefixes
"Pdf" and "e-" proliferate, you start to experience the real
world phenomenon of divergent evolution.  But as Darwin made
clear over 100 years ago, this is no bad thing : "survival of
the fittest" is just as important in computer software as it
is in the evolution of species.  And it is for this very reason
that I made my original point, which is that I do not see it
as being /essential/ that a TeX Live DVD contains /identical/
releases for every possible platform.  If the developer for
platform  $x$ are able to make a last-minute vital bug fix,
or to (for example) address the issue of forcing a first-time
install at the user's request even where there are traces of
an older installation, then I see no compelling reason why
those improvements should not make it onto the DVD, even if
they are platform-specific at that point in time.  The probability
is very high that other platform developers will soon be able to
follow suit, and provided that there is a simple, clean,
mechanism for performing incremental upgrades from the network
rather than having to wait a year (or more) for the next TeX
Live release, then I see no reason at all to compel the DVD
compilers to work to the lowest common denominator.

This analogy with the Darwin theory is a classic, but that doesn't make
it less flawed. While having many competing individuals from various
species doesn't "cost" anything in Life (each individual struggles for
his own survival), having many diverging variations of the same program
*is* generally a bad thing in the Free Software world. Because each of
these has to be supported by (at least) a real person who does real work
and has limited time; and the time spend by Martin Shr?der on pdfTeX is
not spent on other TeX engines, for instance. The manpower is limited
(especially for TeX stuff, where doing development requires particularly
rare skills). Multiplying the forks generally reduces the manpower
available for each fork.

Besides that, it is not always "the fittest" who survives. Quite often,
it's rather "one who was both reasonably fit _and_ lucky".

Not even that.  Peacocks are definitely handicapped by their
particular evolved physical attractivity to their female counterparts.

It is not like survival of the flashiest would be an unheard of
phenomenon in software, either.

I guess I have to say that this is not possible. At least what I found
says:

(which is a doc for tortoise svn, but ..)

Versioned files and folders can never be ignored - that's a feature of

Message-ID: <200702062240.l16MeMe15705@tug.org>

All the binary architectures have now been updated to pdftex 1.40.3,
which fixed an important bug relating to using truetype and type1 fonts
in the same document.  Thanks to the pdftex developers for finding and
fixing the bug so quickly, and the binary builders for rebuilding yet
again at the last moment.

There aren't any critical issues left that I know of, so I am starting
another build now.  It should be at ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test in
an hour or so.  Barring some other horrible breakage coming to light,
this will be the final image for the TeX Live 2007 release.

Message-ID: <loom.20070207T082609-248@post.gmane.org>

hi

I am trying texlive 2007 test and have some trouble with the tlpmgui.

I am using Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP2 Simplified Chinese version,
login with a username that contains Chinese characters, for instance, "??",
double click the DVD-ROM icon in "My Computer" and a msgbox appear saying:

could not read "C:\DOCUMENT~1\[some very strange characters]\ LOCALS~\Temp": no
such file or directory while executing

but if I right click the tlpmgui icon, use "run as" to execute it using another
username that all characters are English letters, for example "yulewang", then
everything works fine.

It is clear that the tlpmgui program cannot read a directory whose path contains
some non-english [Chinese, Japanese, etc.] words. And some MS Windows users will
run into trouble while installing TeXLive 2007.

One possible way to solve this problem is that we can use another temp directory
to store the data, for example, c:\temp\ or C:\WINDOWS\Temp\. thx

Yue Wang

Wouldn't it be a good idea to have this functionality at a central
place, i.e. one file that's loaded by many packages?  This would also
give users a central place for switching the default for DVI output from
dvips to dvipdfm(x) or hypertex.  Currently there are a couple of
packages which hardcode dvips (Today I came across one that loads
[dvips]{hyperref} if \pdfoutput=0).

Then we would have to convince package authors to use this interface to
the detection of engine/output format, and both distributors, local
admins or individual users could make sensible choices.

Unhappily it is not trivial:
* For example, you setup a central place with "hypertex" as
  driver for DVI output. Package hyperref will be happy, package
  color or graphics won't.
* Granularity:
  * Most packages don't distinguish between dvipdfm and dvipdfmx.
    Unhappily there is a small difference that is hit by package
    bmpsize. Thus the package must differentiate.
  * Or consider package dropping. The right driver option for
    pdfTeX in PDF mode is dvips(!).

This is a matter of philosophy.  If you want to shutdown Windows you
have to go to the "Start" menu first.  I would not expect this but
everyone tells me that this is obvious.  Things like this make Windows
so user-friendly.  We should make TeX user-friendly too, and what you
complain about is probably a first step.

  Reinhard

I am aware of that.  The interface we define would have to allow such
granular checking, and it should not hardcode the driver option, but
allow the package to ask.  I'm thinking of macros like \prefix at engine,
\prefix at output@format, \prefix at preferred@DVIprocessor.

Each package would still have to decide which of them it wants to query
and what it wants to do.  But 

- the checking would be done once, without danger of side effects
  affecting later checks

- engine maintainers could support exactly one method of detecting the
  engine, avoiding surprises on both sides. (For example, I'm not sure
  whether those package authors who test for existence of \pdfpagewidth
  instead of \pdfoutput won't be surprised to find their pdfTeX-related
  code to be fed into XeTeX...)

- Users can configure their individual viewing/postprocessing
  preferences globally, without adding (sometimes differing) driver
  options in the document.  On the other hand, per-document
  configuration is of course still possible (e.g. if a document itself
  needs a dvipdfmx workflow).

What are the expectations of installing on Vista?

I had tried TeXLive2005 and the install would just hang at some point.

I'm now trying the 02.04 build of TeXLive2007.  During the install I
received a message:

unable to open key: Access is denied.
unable to open key: Access is denied.
    while executing
"source $filewininstall"
    invoked from within
".f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 invoke "

!pressed; .f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 invoke } "
    (command bound to event)


After continuing, the install program is now just sitting there (well, it's
doing something according to Task Manager) with a message about Postinstall
actions...

Thanks.

Vista was too late. Sorry, if they want to be part of the TeX world they
should have shipped in december ;-)

Haah, probably the new security features! Maybe typing "allow" at some
point would help? Or turning speech recognition on and shouting "ALLOW!"
at your computer? ;-)

as far as read about, installation on vista has more strict rules now (even more strict on the 64 bit version where all drivers need to be signed) so maybe the installer is not playing according to the rules (whatever these rules are)  

since Lamport works at microsoft ... maybe he's willing to figure it out -)

actually, windows does have a coherent security model.  bit of a
surprise to a one-time-os-researcher-cynic like me...

hohoho.

i went on a short course about vista last week.  i was amazed at the
number of times it asked me to confirm i really wanted to do some rather
harmless things.

another thing the speaker did remark was that there's a serious shortage
of vista drivers for 64-bit machines.

i'm not even slightly surprised that texlive has problems on it.

just typical, i say.  good reason to delay spending money with
microsoft.

Yes, Apple has rules and it is not perfect.

Basically, Apple has good-old-fashioned unix security (owner-group-world)
with root as the - well - root (of all eveil, I suppose) and group admin
as a group that is allowed some extra stuff by default, e.g. get root
privileges after entering your password.

The default user set up on a Mac system is member of the admin group, and
while this still means it does not run as administrator without actually
typing in its password once more, it does open some security leaks because
e.g. there are some setuid-root programs in admin-writable locations
(ugh).

A Mac should therefore be set up with a separate admin account and normal
user accounts should not have admin privileges. That still makes it
possible to install stuff as a normal user, because you are allowed then
to enter admin user name and admin password when the privileges panel
appears, but is does block stuff happening without entering a password
because you are a member of group admin.

Anyway, what the Mac has is reasonably decent security *without* it
getting much in your way. As John Welch of Information Week wrote:

Mac OS X...[is] the classic English butler. This OS is designed to make
the times you have to interact with it as quick and efficient as possible.
It expects that things will work correctly, and therefore sees no reason
to bother you with correct operation confirmations....

Windows is...well, Windows is very eager to tell you what's going on.
Constantly. Plug something in, and you get a message. Unplug something and
you get a message. If you're on a network that's having problems staying
up, you'll get tons of messages telling you this. It's rather like dealing
with an overexcited Boy Scout...who has a lifetime supply of
chocolate-covered espresso beans. This gets particularly bad when you
factor in things like the user-level implementation of Microsoft's new
security features.

Why ?  I thought it was common knowledege that "WNT" = SUCC ("VMS"),
and that Microsoft stole Dave Cutler from Digital; it seems more
than logical (to me) that Vista, which is clearly derived in part
from NT, will have inherited many of VMS's strengths, including its
excellent security model ...

Well, I suggest to wait a little while until TL could be tested on
Vista. No Windows computer you buy after the release of TL2007 will be
shipped with XP anymore. Our local retailer even now only has machines
with Vista preinstalled in stock. I had a first look at Vista
yesterday, and I expect it to become available to most Windows users
in short time. It would be sad if shortly only MikTeX were available
tested for Vista... So could you please consider this? I think it's
worth it.

Regards,
J?rgen.

Too late. The images are going gold in 2 days. Not enough time to think
about this now, not to speak about fixing programs etc.

We can make new versions available on the web for win32.

> yesterday, and I expect it to become available to most Windows users

Well who is that stupid to upgrade in the first half year after the
release and want's to play extended beta tester for Windows will
probably have a problem. Those decent person which will wait until the
public beta phase of Vista (ie the first year of public perusal) is
finished before even thinking about switching ...

I remember that I switched to XP 2 years after release ...

Staszek requested one more rebuild to get more bug fixes in tlpmgui, and
Manfred said it won't impact unduly, so I've started that.  (I also
updated hyperref to 6.75r since we were doing it.)  Maybe this will be
the last one, who knows.

As for waiting to test on Vista: it doesn't make sense to me for several
reasons, but the final decision belongs to Klaus and Manfred, since they
are coordinating the physical production.  My guess is that they will
want to have the discs at the Dante meeting.

I'd guess that the actual TeX(-related) programs and the texmf tree 
(s) are likely to be fine on Vista; if there are problems, they're  
likely to be with the installation procedures/programs.

If this turns out to be right (I don't have a Vista system to  
experiment with), then it should be possible to build a small  
installer (e.g, an updated tlpmgui) and offer as a standalone  
download, so that people can set up TL from the standard TL2007 disks  
(or images) without having to re-download a whole mass of stuff.

Hello TeX-hackers!

Last edition of tlpmgui (1.75) works on Vista - report from George
Pearson. In worst case environment variables aren't added.
George will send to tex-live list description about installation
procedure on Vista.
Image of TL should rebuild, because texlivetest2007-inst-20070206
contains previous version of tlpmgui (1.74).

Many thanks for test a tlpmgui on yours systems.

So I am excluding the tlpmgui x86_64 binary from inst (not useful),
which gets it down to 699mb, and remaking the images again.

hello, can you pls move the temp directory other than c:/document and
settings/usrname/temp? because if the usrname contains some Asian characters,
then the installtion wont be started. 

on my computer, if i choose a chinese username to install texlive on win xp,
then the program will report error "file not found"

see my mail before on tlpmgui for more information. 


thx.

I just download the new svn version [1.75] of tlpmgui.exe and tlpmgui.kit, and
replace my old two files with the new one. and double click the tlpmgui.exe
icon, a error occured saying :

"%Temp%" not found.

Is your %TEMP% variable set? 
 I was having problems with TMP and TEMP 
 set in User Settings in Control panel->System->advanced->environment variables
 But after 1.73 everything worked for me in an English language system. 
 Now I have TMP and TEMP set to
 %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp

replace my old two files with the new one. and double click the tlpmgui.exe
icon, a error occured saying :

"%Temp%" not found.
"Temp" directory is needed for installing Tex Live and adding/removing packages

here is my TEMP environment:
%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp

C:\Documents and Settings\??>set TEMP
TEMP=C:\DOCUME~1\??\LOCALS~1\Temp


well, we can have a test like this:

maybe in the english version of windows xp, you need to set the language -->
advance and choose chinese(simplified chinese ) there and have a reboot, i am
not sure, however, maybe it is not necessary.

control panel-> users and group -> add a new user -> copy and paste the name "?
?" there -> set a password whatever you like or just leave it empty.

then logout your own username and login that username in chinese, double click
tlpmgui and the error message will occur.

i hope this helps

Subject: [tex-live] Win32 run from DVD, customization and paper size
Message-ID: <159721.1469.qm@web55604.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

I hope to modify TeX Live to run even more independently from a DVD where I will use it in conjunction with emacs, R (for which a very nice emacs interface, ess, has been written) and some other software. My goal is for a user in our Windows XP labs to be able to insert the DVD and get to work without having to go through a setup step beyond launching emacs, where I do/will try to do relevant parts of what tlpmgui does.  

 I have this working to some extent, but I want to be sure I am not 
 missing something that might prove to be a problem.
 
In particular: 
 *I move gs and dviout to the bin/win32 directory and add them to my emacs exec-path.
 *I set environment variables for perl and GS_LIB and adjust the path. 

 *I am not sure which of the run from DVD steps need to be done 
 for my special case. 
 **What can I move to the DVD and where, given that I should expect
 settings written to a hard drive to last only for one session, after which work
 will resume on a computer with an identical initial configuration?  
I would like to leave the DVD such that people can choose to run tlpmpgui and get the expected behavior if they choose to use it in another environment. However, the top priority is to get it to work in the lab (this semester).
 
* Changing defaults from A4 to Letter is mentioned for Dvips and PdfTeX. Is this 
 sufficient to prevent my users, just starting to learn these tools, from problems printing the simple documents they will generate?  A comment was made on this list in March that for PdfTeX adjusting the configuration is not enough, and format files need to be regenerated. If this is still true?
 For Ghostscript, should I set 
 /DEFAULTPAPERSIZE  (letter) def 
 in lib/gs_init.ps? 
 What about dviout? The 2005 guide described going to a menu to set paper size for windvi. There is no mention of its replacement, dviout, in the version of the 2007 html guide revision 3938 in this regard. (also, arrows have become "!" in those sections ). If an adjustment is needed, how can this be done in configuration files? 
 
 I will work through these issues as I get time and access to Windows machines,
 but any advice that would speed my progress or make my usage more consistent with TeX Live would be appreciated.

you renamed only name in Windows, but your home directory contains still 
chinese characters. Windows joke :-)
tlpmgui 1.75 report before starts about problem with TEMP. In my opinion 
it's better way than during installation.

You have to set TEMP environment variables to e.g C:\TEMP.
IMHO ideas private Temp in path "C:\Documents & settings\user name\local 
settings\sra ta ta\Temp" is stupid.

NTs birth name was "Portable OS/2 3.0". When IBM and Microsoft split  
up (on Microsoft's wish for OS/2 to be portable while IBM wanted it  
tied to its own hardware), both took the code base and worked from  
there. IBM wnet on with OS/2, while Microsoft renamed it Windows NT.  
They did attract Dave Cutler and he did bring VMS knowledge ito it.  
Apparently they did not take over (or kept in place) the security  
model of VMS which indeed is pretty secure I have been told.

Microsoft did weaken security at least once. because of lacking  
graphics performance they moved stuff from user level to kernel  
level. But I suspect they did much more like this, as their focus has  
been functionality far more than security and this only slowly  
changes. I know they hired top-securty people over the last years.

well, so that if the TEMP path contains some Asian characters, the TexLive
installer wont start. that's what I mean.

So I think that we should take more things into account. AFAIK, c:/windows/temp
 [the system's temp, not the computer user's temp] is good enough to put the
temp data there. 

And I also think that if the installer cannot find the TEMP directory, it can
ask the user to choose one directory to put the temp files. that's not hard.

in fact, many people do have a username like sra ta ta, and I do think it is
stupid(I just make one like this to test my program in some bad situation). 

but as far as our generous Mr. Gates allow us to set a non-english username, the
developers should care about this situation. 

again, it is never a good idea to teach the user to choose system information ->
advanced -> system environment -> set the TEMP like C:\TEMP, because it is the
developers' probelm, not the computer users.

In my opinion problem is encoding asian characters. Tcl use default UTF-8, 
probably asian are encoded in utf-16, I don't know.

And type or select: C:\Document and settings\sra ta ta chinese chars\Local

tlpmgui use %TEMP% and next evaluate whether is able to use this path.
MS has no respect to own clients and provide not good tested or stupid 
solution. eg.:
USERHOME=C:\Documents and Settings\non english username
TEMP=%USERHOME%\Local settings\temp
C:\Program Files\...
To run program, tlpmgui has to distinguish between:
"name with spaces.exe" and name_without_spaces.exe
etc.

I'm sorry but I'm user WinXP Polish and English edition only and I have not 
possibility test tlpmgui on Chinese, Japanese, Slovakian, Russian, Spanish, 
German, French, Dutch, Portugese, Greek, Italian or other European, Asian, 
African etc. edition of Windows. It's impossible. 
I and tlpmgui team expect tests by TeX community, but not two days before 
sending image to production.

Tomek

Just for the record:

I solved the issue with the following sh script. This script svn  
updates the two Master/bin subdirectories I want, then non- 
recursively updates Master (so I get new items at that level) and  
then walks Master and updates everything except bin.

echo "****** Updating Build..."
(cd Build && svn update)
echo "****** Updating binaries..."
(cd Master/bin && svn update powerpc-darwin i386-darwin)
cd Master
echo "****** Updating Master non-recursive..."
svn update --non-recursive
for i in *
do
         if [ "$i" != bin ]
         then
                 echo "****** Updating $i..."
                 svn update $i
         fi
done

Hi Tomasz,

Please don't panic. ;) We are not asking that much, just a small fix. Let's see
the source code:

     96     if [info exists env(Temp)] then {
     97         if [file exists $env(Temp)] then {
     98             set envTemp [file attribute $env(Temp) -shortname]
     99             set temperror 0
    100         } else {
    101             set envTemp [pwd]
    102             if [file writable $envTemp] then {
    103                 set temperror 0
    104             } else {
    105                 set temperror 1
    106             }
    107         }
    108     } else {
    109         set envTemp [pwd]
    110         if [file writable $envTemp] then {
    111             set temperror 0
    112         } else {
    113             set temperror 1
    114         }
    115     }

First of all, I think this code can be simplified to:

     95     # path to temp dir
     96     set envTemp [pwd]
     97     if [info exists env(Temp)] then {
     98         if [file exists $env(Temp)] then {
     99             set envTemp [file attribute $env(Temp) -shortname]
    100         }
    101     }
    102
    103     if [file writable $envTemp] then {
    104         set temperror 0
    105     } else {
    106         set temperror 1
    107     }

Secondly, I think using [pwd] as fallback directory is not that useful,
since most of us are running tlpmgui from CD/DVD (Image), which
is, of cource, not writable. I suggest using something like C:\Temp
(or even a new directory named by timestamp, to avoid conflicts).

Any comments?

I plan add dialog for select or create temp directory for installation of 
TL or use TLroot/temp, but I hadn't enough free time for adopt those ideas.

Are you interested in help in develop of tlpmgui?

well, maybe you can use the english version to test it if you have the windows
xp english version install cd.

just set your username in chinese or other asian languages will do. for example
"??" (I write one here for you to copy and paste it to the control panel-> add
new user). After that just login that name , and test the exe file.

if you cannot do that, maybe you need to set your system language into chinese
using the *english* version xp install cd (go to the control panel, double click
the language. go to the language tab, select install files for the Asian
language, go to the advance tab, choose simplified chinese, insert the english
version installtion cd and press ok and begin installtion for the chinese
support or something like that. After 3 minutes it will ask you to reboot the
system. reboot it and everything is ok)

Well, we dont think it is good to teach the users how to set their temp
environment to c:\temp. what's more, it is not teaching them to *set* the
environment, but asking them to *overwrite* it. It's not proper to do so.

Let me start by saying that I have a lot of sympathy
for Wang's position; by default, Win/XP will set
the user environment variables TEMP and TMP to

	C:\DOCUME~1\<Username>\LOCALS~1\Temp

and if <Username> contains "funny" characters which
cause problems for the TeX Live GUI Installer, then
this is (in my opinion) a serious problem.

Suggesting that a user clobber his/her environment variables
to work around this is, IMHO, not a satisfactory solution.

The obvious solution (it seems to me) is to programatically
ascertain whether the installer can write to %TEMP% and/or
%TMP%, and -- if not -- to internally create a scratch
directory into which the installer /can/ write : given
the probability of two people attempting a concurrent
install under Vista to be numerically indistinguishable from
zero, it would not seem that the algorithm for deriving
the name for the scratch directory to be excessively complex.

I really wish to help, but since I have zero knowledge about Tcl/Tk, probably
I am not the best guy to improve it...

As I agreed with Philip's idea, maybe we should not bother the user to select
a temp directory manually, just create one automatically will be OK.

Well, "dwa zloty" was somewhat overkill as well :
nearer to two dollars than two cents, I suspect !

Incidentally, is it "liang fen" or "liang ge fen" ?
I can never remember ...

  :-)

  And as far as Polish is concerned, I guess it would be ?dwa groszy? or
?groszych?, or whatever the correct agreement is in this weird language
(sorry, no sample out there) ;-)

  Actually there is something remarkable about this coin, apart from its
very low face value.

Subject: [tex-live] Missing skak symbols
Message-ID: <45CCC589.2000008@pakin.org>

The skak package doesn't seem to work when running from an installation of
texlivetest2007-inst-20070206.iso.  As a quick test, try running latex on
texmf-dist/doc/latex/skak/informator.tex and viewing the result.  When I do,
most of the symbols are missing.

I believe the problem is that there are two versions of uskak.fd in TeX Live:
texmf-dist/tex/latex/skak/uskak.fd and texmf-dist/tex/latex/skaknew/uskak.fd.
The former, which is what shows up when I do a "kpsewhich uskak.fd" defines
the "normal" font with "\DeclareFontShape{U}{skak}{m}{n}{<-> skakf10 }{}".
The latter defines the "normal" font with
"\DeclareFontShape{U}{skak}{m}{n}{<-> SkakNew-Figurine}{}".  If I delete
skak/uskak.fd but retain skaknew/uskak.fd the generated informator.dvi file
looks fine.

 Attached is a patch containing  a few minor grammar/typing changes you might consider for  some dialogs, included here in case others can improve on my suggestions. The Changelog in the source code dated 02/09/07 15:52:00 indicated 1.76.

I'm remaking the iso's again now to pick up the latest tlpmgui.  I also
updated natbib since a mac user already wanted the new version on CTAN.
No need for new binaries.

Manfred said that he will pick up the final (really) images Monday
morning, German time (Sunday afternoon, my time).  I have no plans to
remake the iso's again after this build, but I guess we can do it again
this weekend if we have to.

Message-ID: <02d301c74ca6$aaae4be0$d326a8c0@Kehua>

I downloaded texlivetest2007-inst-20070209.iso and created a CD.  

I had created a user with my name under Vista and added myself to the
Administrators group.  When I ran the TeXLive installation I had turned on
the "Install for all users" check box.  This is the case with the older
build where the install would just hang.  With this build the install would
complete in this case, but would not update environment variables.  If I
install with my user name and leave the check box turned off, the install
completes and appropriate environment variables are added to the user
environment area.

If I sign on using the Administrator account, I can turn on the check box
and the install completes properly and system level environment variables
are updated.

So, I'd say that for Vista, the system Administrator account must be used if
the intent is to install for all users.

Hello Poti,

Regarding paper sizes: it is true that the default paper size is 
included in the .fmt files.  Assuming you don't have to simultaneously
both a4 and letter, you should build the .fmt's with the one you need
and include them on your DVD as files like:
texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdftex.fmt
texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt

If you do have to support both a4 and letter simultaneously, I'm not
sure what to suggest.  Have to have both fmts around and a front end
that switches where the var tree is found, or something.  Very messy.

You will also want to include the other config files (for dvips,
dvipdfm[x], etc.) on your DVD.  I don't know the answer for dviout,
sorry.

(The !'s instead of arrows looks like a bug in tex4ht or TL's tex4ht
configuration.  I can't deal now.  Maybe next time.)

Hope this helps,
Karl

I think that paper size should always be specified in each document.
if you give the document to someone else, you never know what will be
her default paper size. If I prepare a document just for myself, I
include a private package with my favourit macro definitions and with
paper size that suits to my printer.

    I think that paper size should always be specified in each document.

I don't agree with "always", but never mind the theory.  The point here
is that it is certainly the case in practice that many documents do not
specify a paper size, and Potis' run-off-dvd installation needs to work
with them without further ado.  An installation in the USA that defaults
to a4 is not, in practice, usable.

You really have to look at what is loaded in the available printers.
Half the time I go to pick up a printout I'm greated with the message:
"Please put A4 paper in tray X" and a backlog of jobs waiting to print.

There are a couple things that could be done:

1.  make the default "PA4" format (210x280 mm):

"Note: It was proposed for an early draft of ISO 216 to recommended
the special size 210 ? 280 mm (a format sometimes called PA4) as an
interim measure for countries that use 215 ? 280 mm paper and have not
yet adopted the ISO A series. Some magazines and other print products
that have to be printed economically on both A4 and U.S. Letter
presses use the PA4 format today. Incidentally, this PA4 format has a
width/height ratio of 3:4, the same as traditional TV screens and most
computer monitors and video modes."
  -- <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html>,

2. use the locale information:

_US and _CA --> letter, otherwise A4

For POSIX there is a sample C program and extensive discussion
<http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/2002-04/msg00148.html>
The main objection is that many people working N. America use
other locales so they can work in their native language, while
N. Americans may want to print from their laptop while travelling.

Windows has a locale API -- don't know if anyone has done a POSIX
interface, but

<http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getwr/steps/wrg_paper.mspx>

is a table to decode values of LOCALE_IPAPERSIZE.

Hmm, I read Bruno's post onf Mac OS X TeX. Marvosym has changed and  
umvs.tfm is now the name of the font.

Still, I then wonder why this old marvosym stuff is still there.

The last two are from the eruofont package and not the marvosym
package. I guess we can simply delete them, but ok they do not disturb.

The first one is due to my lazyness. I did an update op the marvosym
package from CTAN, and didn't care for deleting strange stuff. OTOH,
this is the way as it is shipped from CTAN, so why not leave it like
this, or fix the upload on CTAN. If this is done, at the next update the
file will be gone.

I'm not suggesting to adopt our approach, but it might still be
interesting:  Debian has a "libpaper" which is intended for system-wide
settings of paper preferences.  Recently, it has gotten hooks that we
can use to query their settings in our texlive installation scripts, and
use the papersize information for format generation.  On the other hand,
if the local admin reconfigures libpaper, the formats will be
regenerated, too.

The only thing that needs to be done on the texlive side is to patch
texconfig so that it accepts all (or most) Debian paper sizes for the
global "texconfig paper FOO".  Of course, I'll submit the patch to this
list.

I worked as a developer for a now dead internet startup in silicon
valley. We finished our product, it passed all our QA, etc.

The boss had his secretary take the CD to be pressed. She took the iso
image, and I don't know what she did to burn it - but rather than
getting the iso image to the company that did the pressing, she burned a
CD to take to be pressed, and she burned it in windows - resulting in a
8.3 all upper case file names. I think she must have mounted the image
and used some cd burner software to make a CD from the mounted image or
something.

Fortunately we caught it before shipping, but that was quite a costly
blunder (and not her blunder, she was told to do something she shouldn't
have been told to do - as she was a secretary, not a technical person.)

Seems that the latest version of tlpmgui will be burnt on the CD/DVD,
so you are in luck.  The tlpmgui team always keeps their stuff in the
TeXLive repository up-to-date and the (hopefully) final images had
been made a few hours ago.

P.S. Since there have been no showstoppers reported, and Manfred is

likely to be the final release.  I won't publicize it until tomorrow,

Many years ago a colleague and I wrote an Othello program, BILL.  We
decided that it needed the ability to think on its opponent time (do
lookahead while the opponent is thinking), and we were right.  And we
decided as much the evening before the tournament, which was not so
right.

All night we coded like mad.  When the tournament began in the
morning, we had a version with thinkahead that we prayed would play
all its games without crashing.  It survived the tournament by a
miracle, but we made the code so hard to read and added bugs that
survive to this day.  [You can download the source at

Well no and yes. THere is Tpm.pm which provides some functionality, but
it is not documented at all and hard to understand, at least for me.

I hacked around TPm.pm quite a lot for getting it to work for the Debian
install scripts.

Then there is tpm-factory.pl which shows the usage of many of the Tpm.pm
stuff.

That's all. My dream still to see a nice module for tpm files, but I am
not the one to write it, not enough experience with perl ... (although,
after writing the tpm->debian perl script I feeling a bit more
confident)

I don't agree with "always", but never mind the theory.  The point here
is that it is certainly the case in practice that many documents do not

with them without further ado.  An installation in the USA that defaults
to a4 is not, in practice, usable.
Thank you Karl,
  
  With your advice and by reading through the tlpmgui postinstall source code,
 I think I know what I need to do when I get to the office and re-boot the computer to Windows. This is indeed a prerequisite for a functioning DVD in my setting.
   
 And thank you Zdenek for suggesting a  private package to keep settings. 
 Short of  that more advanced approach to document consistency, I thought about setting up emacs to suggest good practice to the new learner. I can set the document environment default to letterpaper but I have not yet found how to make 'insert document environment' also add  the line  \usepackage{geometry}, 
 though I am sure I will soon. However, I am not clear on what I would do for specifying a driver if the objective was to ensure consistency on a foreign computer.

Message-ID: <d954a6590702130331l35d061fdi89be268784e245fd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was bitten by a bug in ConTeXt while packaging the TeXLive 2007 texmf
tree. RPM's find-requires script added a bogus dependency to /usr/env
which prevented me to actually install the packages. I tracked it down
to the ConTeXt package ruby scripts, where incorrect shebang is present
in the wwwserver.rb. The cause might be that the ctxtools.rb script,
which contains the add_shebang function, which is used to write a
shebang to newly created scripts, contains a typo, when it refers
to /usr/env, but should refer to /usr/bin/env as usual.

Attaching patch that fixes it.

Jindrich

Subject: [tex-live] wrong shebang in ConTeXt scripts breaks RPM packaging
Message-ID: <1171360780.2415.15.camel@redhat.usu>

Hi all,

I was bitten by a bug in ConTeXt while packaging the TeXLive 2007 texmf
tree. RPM's find-requires script added a bogus dependency to /usr/env
which prevented me to actually install the packages. I tracked it down
to the ConTeXt package ruby scripts, where incorrect shebang is present
in the wwwserver.rb. The cause might be that the ctxtools.rb script,
which contains the add_shebang function, which is used to write a
shebang to newly created scripts, contains a typo, when it refers
to /usr/env, but should refer to /usr/bin/env as usual.

Attaching patch that fixes it.

Hi,
as far as I can see #3909 fixed the problem.  However, I noticed the
bug accidentally.  It would be nice if we can avoid problems like this
in the future.

The problem was that new features had been introduced, texmf.cnf had
been changed accordingly, but Staszek did not notice this change.

There had been similar problems in the past.  I wrote a little script
which derives texmf.cnf-4WIN from texmf.cnf and changes only variables
which should be set different on Windows.  However, such a script does
not solve all problems.  The main problem is that you have to know
when the main texmf.cnf file had been changed.

However, there is a better solution.  Kpathsea looks for texmf.cnf
files at various places.  All texmf.cnf files it finds are evaluated
but if a variable is set in one file it will never be overwritten if
it appears in a file which is evaluated later.

If you run

   kpsewhich --expand-path=\$TEXMFCNF

you'll see that it first looks for

   /path/to/texlive/bin/<platform>/texmf.cnf

Obviously it's best to create a file "Master/bin/win32/texmf.cnf"
which only contains things which are supposed to be different on
Windows.

This has many advantages:

   1. Changes made in the main texmf.cnf file will be taken into
      account immediately.  Only variables you changed will not be
      affected.

   2. The installer does not have to rename
      texmf.cnf-4WIN => texmf.cnf.

   3. You can add any comments to the variables you change (which my
      program doesn't support).

   4. People who want a full network installation can simply
      remove/rename bin/win32/texmf.cnf.

The only drawback is that people who do not know how things work might
be confused if something does not work as expected.  But this can be
solved easily by adding a comment to the main texmf.cnf file.  This is
needed anyway.  Many people unnecessarily make use of the TEXMFCNF
environment variable which is always a source of trouble.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It appears that what is there now is in fact final.  No more critical
bugs have come to light and Klaus and Manfred are well into the
production process.  I will probably wait another day or two before
renaming it and making it the official release, though, just in case.

And that might again lead to problems, in particular if we forgot that a
variable that we want to change is set differently on Windows.

Why not try to generate the texmf.cnf for windows at build time?  It is
generated anyway, from texmf.in (I guess this is the same when building
for windows?), and we could apply an additional sed script to make the
win-specific changes.  If we code carefully, any change to texmf.in in
lines with windows-specific settings will cause the Win-ify sed script
to fail, and we won't forget to think about it and adapt it.

There are only a few variables which differ from the main texmf.cnf.
Since Staszek wants to get rid of the *-sys programs he commented out
a few variables.  He also had to add new stuff for XeTeX because there
usually are no config files for fontconfig on Windows.

What we have in TeXLive for Windows is that:  All *-sys programs had
been removed and all variables "*SYS*" had been commented out in
texmf.cnf.  If no *-sys programs are available there is no need to
remove "*SYS*" variables because there is no program which uses them.

But maybe there is a better solution.  I suppose that what Staszek
really wants is to avoid that foo{,-sys} write files to different
directories.  Since getnonfreefonts depends on -sys we currently have
TEXMFHOME=$TEXMFLOCAL in texmf.cnf-4WIN.

Doesn't it make sense to treat all the other variables similar?  The
*-sys programs can be retained then but it doesn't make any difference
whether you say updmap or updmap-sys, files are written to the same
directory.

But if you remove/rename bin/win32/texmf.cnf your system will find the
genuine texmf.cnf.

Actually texmf.in is not used at all.  What we have in TeXLive is
Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.  Though Karl tries to keep texmf.in
up-to-date, these files are maintained separately.  It would be nice
to derive texmf.cnf from texmf.in because some people might want to
configure --without-multiplatform.

  Reinhard

IMHO it would be better to have the *-sys programs, even if they do the same 
like the programs without -sys. It's not only because the documentation may 
be the same for all architectures, also admins don't need to remember that 
their is a difference at windows and addon-authors (e.g. authors of plattform 
independent TeX shells) wouldn't have to watch and test one more special 
case.

Hi,

just had problems with installing some non-texlive debian package:

After removal of the texlive version of install-info, the package

Is install-info a required binary within the texlive distro?

Required?  As far as I'm concerned, I think all of Texinfo could be
removed from TL without any real problem, but others apparently disagree :).

Given that Texinfo is included, install-info is a standard part of
Texinfo and has been since 1996 (predating Debian's, I believe), so I
don't think it would make sense to remove it.

The differences between Texinfo install-info and Debian install-info are
not irresolvable, but sadly, no one (including me) has yet resolved
them.  I seem to recall Norbert being the last person to volunteer to
work on that, a couple years ago :).

if you'll install the texlive debian packages (2006 or a test version
of 2007 which is already available), you'll not have this problem,
because the debian texlive packages don't include it's own texinfo.

alternatively, remove the texlive path from your root's PATH variable

Hi,

I forgot to write about a small difference between
Windows and other systems concerning the order of
file search.

[1] Windows
    (a) \input foo
        try foo.tex first, if not found then try foo
    (b) \input foo.tex
        try foo.tex
    (c) \input foo.bar
        try foo.bar first, if not found then try foo.bar.tex

[2] Other systems
    (a) \input foo
        try foo.tex first, if not found then try foo
    (b) \input foo.tex
        try foo.tex
    (c) \input foo.bar
        try foo.bar.tex first, if not found then try foo.bar

The behavior in the case (c) is different. Please remind this
if something seemed strange.

BTW, allow_multiple_suffixes, which is written in both
texmf.cnf and texmf.cnf-4WIN, does not give any effect
in all systems.

Thanks,
Akira

The behaviour as described for Windows seems logical (indeed,
required) to me : imagine one has

	\input letter-spacing.sty

then surely one would want letter-spacing.sty to be
loaded, and not letter-spacing.sty.tex, even if the
latter existed.

Hartmut's post shows it is not only WIn32 where there are clashes
between TL and other executables, so it is worth implementing a
general strategy to reduce such conflicts.

Certain names should be reserved for system-specific use.  Unlike
common programs like "ls"and "rm", these would abe allowed to have
system-specific behaviour.  Certainly "install" would be in the list,
and "install-info" would be a likely candidate.   In the absence of
such rules, Debian should use absolute paths in package installers,
but there is no reason TL can't play nicely by putting install-info in
a "private" bin directory, say "tl-bin", for use by TL scripts.   This
could also be useful for TL-supplied utilities (unzip, tar, sed, awk,
perl, gs, ruby, lua, etc.) on systems that don't commonly have them
(e.g., Win32).

I'm not sure that the problems on Windows and Linux/UNIX distributions
are really of the same type, but I haven't followed the windows-related
discussions.

What do you mean with "system" here?  A particular machine, an operating
system?

It is an established Debian policy (and a "must" clause IIRC) to *not*
use absolute paths in install scripts.  And this is indeed very useful;
for example it's easy to replace a script for debugging, without messing
up your package database.

That's an interesting idea.  On the other hand, it means that if I
install TeXLive on a Windows system, I have perl and gs installed, but
can't use them; if I need them for other reasons, I have to install them
a second time.

But (a) prevents that "foo" can be loaded if
both "foo" and "foo.tex" exist. :-(

Therefore I prefer a new \input primitive that uses
curly braces (such as \pdfximage) without default
extension. Then it would be possible to reliable
address each file name (including spaces, quotes, ...)

It is not a good idea because \input{foo} is a LaTeX macro and assumes
to load foo.tex if it exists. It can make things confusing.

There is one thing to consider: Windows have no package manager or
dependency handling of any kind, and it's not weird or strange to have
one dll installed multiple times (that actually happens very often).
So, it's what George suggested is actually quite normal on Windows,
even it would be completely unacceptable on Linux/BSD systems.

Having to install them for second time isn't much an issue either --
besides the fact that most Windows installations are already full of
cruft (including duplicate programs and libs), hard drives are big
enough and cheap enough today, so I guess it would be all OK.

I vote for George's suggestion.

No, it isn't, I said a *new* primitive, of course with a new name, e.g.
\inputfile, \pdfinput, ... or whatever name.
Also the existence of this new primitive can be tested in a reliable way.
Thus the compatibiliy isn't violated and new macro code can use
the new primitives. It reduces confusion because nobody must
guess which file names can be detected and which files are loaded.
(Also new primitives for \openin/\openout are needed.)

OK. I think that there are already  extensions in some distributions
mainly for handling file names with spaces. New set of primitives with
new names will provide portable solution.

It just increases the confusion:
* There is no reliable way for asking whether this feature is available
  or not.
* It just shifts the problem from spaces to quotes.

Now you cannot use spaces *and* quotes.

Windows problems are very much worse, but the key difficulty is that a
user ends up with multiple programs sharing a name, with potentially
nasty results.   This can happen on *x and Windows, but has been more
widely discussed for windows because many users expect a TeX system to
provide tools such as zip, tar, sed, awk, ghostscript, perl, ruby,
lua, etc. while *x users expect to get the necessary programs from
their distribution.

Here, system means the particular distribution, e.g., Debian linux,
Red Hat linux, Apple OS X, Microsoft Windows, etc.   System-specific
behaviour includes the package manager and the way changes to
persistent configuration information are made.   Each system needs to
have a way to protect such tools from clashes (e.g., not using generic
names like "install") because you can be sure some user or developer
is going to use the same name.   How many beginning linux programmers
have been surprised by the results they got after
compiling test.c?

But leaves debian vulnerable to name clash problems if you allow
users to install things (for root) without using debian packaging.
Surely there could be a setting that switches between using key
tools from "standard" places (for safety in the real world) and using
the ones you find on the path (for testing).

Some tools (install-info) are not required outside TL and should not
be a directory on the PATH where name clashes can cause problems.  Gs,
perl, etc are not so simple.

The TL installer could only install the tools if it doesn't find
suitable existing versions.  But does it do a "standard" install of
standalone gs or
install a gs using the TL installer?  Should a TL install of gs go to
in the bin/WIn32 directory or to tl-bin/Win32?  TL has to work with
widely used versions of standalone gs (to support linux, etc), so it
shouldn't need a private version, and the version TL installs should
have all the capabilities of a "standard" install.  This makes it more
a question of convenience and whether a user prefers TL's installer
over the standard
installer.

Many Windows systems will have the gs installed by the user, the
version MikTeX-2.5 installed, and the version matlab installs.  Matlab
and several remote sensing apps each install a java runtime.

TL's bin directory gets bigger each year, as do the number of 3rd
party apps on the average user's path, so the potential for clashes is
growing.

The key point is that TL can minimize side effects on all platforms by
using a private directory for binaries that users won't normally run
via the command line (nothing would stop some users from add tl-bin to
their PATH).  There could be two install modes: stealth mode where
only a basic set of programs are exposed to the PATH and the way we do
it now.

They obviously are, but I don't know whether we (people involved in TL
development) do everything properly.  Recently I asked about a good
place for $HOME and the result was that people told me that the
environments had been quite different on different versions of
Windows.

What we actually do to adapt TeXLive for Windows is to
reverse-engineer things.  Is it really true that Windows is
completely undocumented?

Does anybody know about documentation in the internet?

  > Many Windows systems will have the gs installed by the user, [...]

There are two problems we have with gs for Windows currently:

  1. The batch files are not installed properly.

  2. The fonts supplied with gs are problematic because they had been
     modified but the UniqueID had not been changed.

The first problem can be solved by reporting the bug to th GS team.
The second problem is more problematic.  The GPL allows such
modifications and I don't have the time to start a discussion about
such things with them.

I think that in two years GS will be shipped with Jacko's fonts anyway
because nobody wants to use anything else.

Then GS can be a separate package which has not to be touched by TL
developers at all.

It would be nice to have a Perl on the CD/DVD which can be installed
separately from TeXLive.  However, the only reasonable perl
distribution for Windows is ActivePerl.  It's very good software and
documentation is amazingly good but its license is horribly stupid. 

AFAIK, what we have now in TeXLive is a Perl generated in a Mingw
(Minimum GNU for Windows) environment.  This works pretty well though
I think it would be nicer to use ActivePerl because TeXLive
developers can save a lot of time then.  

Regarding ActivePerl, I don't understand why people spend an
enormous amount of time to provide really good software and finally
put it under such a stupid license.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Not just versions -- large organizations have quite different setups.
Some want HOME to be a network drive, and hope that any user can
walk up to any PC, log in, and run with their files, but in practice many
applications store things on the C: drive so you end up with messy
login scripts to load the user's settings into the registry.

Not undocumented, just undisciplined because it has a legacy of
monolithic apps that take over the machine.

Users expect to move EPS files around but discover that some files
that can be viewed on system A have font problems in system B.

It will take several more years before the older gs installs are updated.

Certainly the ideal is to encourage 3rd parties to fix problems (in
functionality or licenses) so they play well with TeX Live, but I
suspect the problem will always be with us, so a mechanism to support
private TL binaries could make it easier to ensure TL has the
necessary 3rd party support with reduced risk of conflicts.
Installers can check to see if gs, perl, etc are available, but the
live version isn't so flexible.

Which is reason enough to have a stripped down perl that is adequate
for the scripts used by TL.

You can be sure there are people working hard to come up with even
more horrible licenses such as usage based charging.  The problems we
have now will only get worse.

ConTeXt now has a "texmfstart" wrapper that tries to hide the
differences between platforms and TeX systems.   Certainly most
Windows users expect to use TeX in some environment such as
WinEDT (and lament the passing of 4allTeX), and seldom, if ever, use
the command line.   I suppose the extreme would be to leave the
bin/Win32 directory out of the PATH and insist that users who aren't
comfortable with the command line work in an environment that runs
the programs from buttons and menus.

Of course you can add this directory to your path if you DO want to

What about dropping support for anything before w2k? If it were just
for w2k and wxp, I would go for %USERPROFILE%. Does anybody know how
things are in Vista?

Right.  Plus, the local path is always prepended to the user path.
And it is hardly possible NOT to give someone administrator
privileges, if you want them to do any work at all. So everybody is
empowered to screw things up for others in a typical (or at least in
our) roaming profiles setup.

Maybe you can get better documentation from a copy of Visual Studio
or from an MSDN membership; I wouldn't know.

Yes, this point has been raised before.  The real problem
is (a) that users actually use files with no extension, and
that (b) under *X, "foo." is not the same as "foo".  Under
Windows, there is no problem : if one /really/ wants to
access a file with a missing extension, one specifies
"<filename>."; sadly this doesn't work under *X, so
as Heiko points out, *X implementations of TeX are
unable to load "foo" if "foo.tex" exists and is in the
search path.  I would confess to being /extremely/
surprised if this were to cause any problems in real
life.

As an aside, why anyone would want to have a file called
"foo" (as opposed to than "foo.<something>") is beyond
my comprehension : it is as insane (IMHO) as the Windows
default behaviour of /hiding/ file extensions.  How anyone
is expected to know what sort of file "foo" is (whether
he/she has actually chosen to call it "foo", or whether
Windows has patronizingly hidden the extension) is
equally beyond me.  This caused real problems when creating
a PERL script on someone else's machine last week : Windows
said the file was called "Test-1.pl", whilst Perl said that
"Test-1.pl" does not exist.  It turned out that the file was
actually called "Test-1.pl.txt" : classic Microsoft insanity :-(

Quite easy. I do have a directory with both
README and README.tex. But consider a TeX driver file that
formats plain text files nicely for printing
(e.g. listings package, ...), README cannot be processed.

There are many such files in the real world, examples:
  Makefile, README, COPYING, LICENSE, NEWS, ChangeLog, ...

Agreed, this is one of the first things I change if I have to
work on a windows system.

slightly off-topic, but even the LaTeX community is actively promoting
the not-mentioning of file name extensions, e. g. in \includegraphics{},
just look into the Niedermair book. This policy looks ridiculous imho.
Just showing off that these things work out automagically? I'd say it's
much better to always state the extension to specify _exactly_ what
graphics type is wanted (e. g. you know after years, what file was to be
included). Why shouldn't one write foo.png if one wants foo.png?

There are now people who used Windows at university who have never learned
to use extensions or to be careful about uppercase/lowercase when
entering filenames.
There some wonderful tricks, such as renaming file1, file2, ... to
File1, File2, ... to signal that some update was made to the files and
sending the project off to a colleague who
just started using linux and doesn't understand why the updates aren't
appearing.

At some point we have to admit that people will always invent schemes
that defeat overly clever interfaces, and go back to a simple and
direct mechanism (i.e., use filenames as entered without attempting to
supply extensions).  For the most common mistakes, the error message
could ask "did you mean to input file.tex?".

Not really. It's usefull if you work with pdflatex _and_ dvips: The
configuration files (e.g. graphics.cfg) select the right driver and
the driver loads the graphics it likes (png or eps).

    As an aside, why anyone would want to have a file called "foo"

On Unix, executables are named, for example, "dvips", without any
extension.  When someone runs "tex dvips", they expect to find
dvips.tex, not the dvips binary.  After umpteen bug reports about this,
I proposed and implemented the rules as they are now (some 15 years ago).
It seems various changes have been made since then, but I think the
basic strategy still holds.

It seems fine to me that the behavior on Windows is different in this
regard, because Windows executables (and files in general) aren't
extensionless.

I fully support Heiko's suggestion of a new primitive with grouping
characters so that arbitrary filenames can be read.  I imagine the
pdftex or ntg-pdftex list is the best place to discuss that.

Fair point.  But true only for *X systems, which
regard the "." in "Readme." as a part of the name,
rather than as the separator which acts as a
visible delimiter between file name and extension.

Yes, all of these apart from "Makefile" would benefit
enormously from having a ".txt" or ".log" extension.

And if only "Make" would expect files of type ".mak",
then we could do away with extensionless files for ever :-)

If I say "Readme" I mean "Readme" and if I say "Readme." I mean
"Readme.".  It's simply wrong if I get "Readme" when I say "Readme.".

No, nothing/nobody will benefit.  Extensions are not unique and I
guess that Perl is unable to process a file like "uplr8t.pl".

Sigh...  Why do you suggest ".mak" and not ".make"?  It's good that
you like Windows so much but you can't expect that UNIX users like all
these restrictions.  You cannot force UNIX users to live in the
stone-age.

But why? In Unix, OS doesn't differ the part of file name before the
last dot and after the last dot. It's a FILE NAME. There are no
extensions in Unix that OS actually cares about. However, varios GUIs
(KDE, GNOME, Xfce..) and their file managers actually look for file
extension when determining file type, to make it easier for the user.
However, some of them (at least Nautilus does that) compare the file
extension to actual file content (determined from file header, you can
do it in shell with "file") and complains if it finds it different.

Yes, that's the problem : but clearly *X aficionados are happy
with this sad state of affairs, so there's little than can be
done until they finally see the error of their ways ...

The user community is not at all the same as it was for the first 2/3
of the past 15 years.  Although windows uses .exe, .bat, etc., many
users don't see these anymore because recent versions hide extensions.
 It is also unfortunate that Windows tends to capitalize file names
while ignoring case, so users will have "file1.tex" "File2.tex", etc.
but "\input file1 \input file2 ..." Furthermore, many mainstream tools
(R, Matlab) are widely used on both Windows and *x systems, so it has
become common to have multi-author projects where some authors are on
linux and others on Windows.  When everyone was using lowercase ASCII
8.3 names without spaces (or UTF-8 encoding), most documents could be
formatted on either DOS or unix with little effort.

There needs to be some attention to document portability and
debugging.  Just as some programming languages have "strict" flags to
help point out when language extensions are being used, TeX could have
optional checks for portable filenames and missing extensions.

If you believe that the period is a part of the filename, true;
if you believe that it is a delimiter, false.

The benefit is that it is immediately apparent what sort of file
it is; as it stands, one has to guess from the filename, which
is a very poor choice of heuristic, IMHO.

  Extensions are not unique and I

That would depend on its contents.  If it contained a TeX font
property list, no. If it contained a Prologue source file, no.
But if it contained a PERL program, then yes.  Of course, it is
a sad fact of life that whilst we use very short extensions (two
or three characters), the probability of semantic overload is
very high : what would be nice is if file systems evolved such
that the /type/ of a file was stored in the file descriptor, so
that when one performed a directory listing one was told not only
the name and extension but also its type (Prologue source file, TeX
Property list, PERL source file and so on).

Just to stick with the current received wisdom that, in general,
three characters are necessary and sufficient.  In fact, all of
my PERL programs have extension ".perl" on my own machine; the
example I referred to previously was on someone else's machine.

That's the very age I'm trying to move them out of :-)

Neanderthal man was moderately successful, but was eclipsed
by Cro-Magnon man : Unix was moderately successful (for its
time), but its time is long since past and it's time for
Unix users to move on !

The majority of Windows users don't know that this is possible, and
there are sites where such settings are not preserved (users share a
pool of systems that are all made to look the same and
load a virgin system image on a regular basis).

There are two issues here:

1.  kpathsea checks first for <filename>.tex:

kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (./a.pdf.tex) => 0
kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (./a.pdf) => 0

<a.pdf, id=59, 72.27pt x 72.27pt> <use a.pdf>

2.  macros that support searching a list of extensions under user
control (e.g., the graphichs package)

You have foo.png today, but the colors aren't correct in the PDF file,
so you will want foo.pdf created with a CMS aware app tomorrow.  The
package documentation spells out the rules and you have control over
the list of possible extensions.  The real problem is that users
encounter unexpected behaviour without good mechanisms to debug.
Kpathsea debugging is only useful for emacs users who can search the
output in a shell window.

A tex option to list all the files actually used by a document
(including .tfm, .map, and font files) together with their md5sums,
would be very helpful.

To CP/M?  Because that is where your favorite restrictions originated.

MS/DOS started out as a CP/M clone, and only later moved from
FCB-directed I/O calls (where user space was responsible for
allocating the internal per-file data structures used by the OS) to
the file-id based calls, and to a directory structure.

Sadly, Microsoft pretty much botched the hierarchical file system and
I/O semantics, even though they modelled them superficially after
Unix.

So the choice presenting itself nowadays is using either original or
botched Unix semantics, as long as one restricts the choice to between
Unix or Windows.

I doubt that you are not aware of that.

You don't seem to understand. While this might seem sad state of
affairs to you, it's a heavenly perfect state of affairs to a *X user
who actually thinks all the bad things about Windows state of affairs
(including hiding extensions by default, which is probably the most
brain-dead thing that anyone has ever done).

For pdftex-1.40.3, -recorder doesn't report the .tfm files.  I assume it
only looks at \input.   On some *x systems you can get a complete list
using a process trace tool -- is there a similar capability for

it does. (except for the .tfm files which are preloaded into the

recorder)

I really don't see why it is an error to think of the full stop as an
ordinary character.  I frequently use filenames like 15.3grad.eps (or
with any other extension), and it's really annoying that this triggers
some special handling, and pdfTeX/graphicx.sty won't include the file.

Because a CP/M file control block reserves just 11 bytes for file name
and extension, not storing the period.

TeX on windows has a sorry history of failed or abandoned efforts,
both commercial and free (4allTeX, emtex, Y&Y, fptex, ...).  There are
simialrl problems with the 3rd party tools (perl, ghostscript, etc. )
My impression is that there are many more TeX users for whom Windows
is their primary OS than all the *X users combined, and there has been
no shortage of people willing to do ports, but the effort required is
just too great to sustain.   All the same complaints that *X users are
reluctant to add ugly #ifdef Windows patches apply equally to the 3rd
party tools, but this is just part of the battle.

I suspect a big part of the problem is the difficulty of supporting a
much larger user community, including many novice users.   This has
certainly been my experience -- *X users just get on with using TeX
while Windows users often find TeX unreliable.  Many of the problems
have been with 3rd party tools (ghostscript, perl, editors, etc.), but
to the users it is TeX jobs that fail, and the only remedy they know
is to install a different package, so you find systems with bits of 2
different miktex versions, 4alltex, Y&Y, pctex, and fptex/TeXLive.

Package managers are a big help in making *X easier to support, but
there are also benefits from a smaller and more cohesive user
community and one TeX distribution (teTeX) that worked for almost
everyone.

There is even a portable tool:  KPATHSEA_DEBUG=4

But if emacs can capture stderr it should be possible for other
programs too.  The question is how this can be achieved.  This is an
interesting question because "gs -sDEVICE=bbox" writes output to
stderr.  It's a well known bug and Ghostscript developers have this on
their TODO list for many years.  I suppose that we will have LaTeX3
and Omega2 before it will be fixed.  On the other hand it's annoying
that Microsoft steals concepts from other operating systems and does
not implement them properly. 

Emacs can also be run in batch-mode, so you can use Emacs-Lisp like
any other programming language to process files.  It's probably not
easy to read arbitrary stuff (like "pdftex myfile.tex") from the
command-line because the command line had been interpreted by emacs
before the elisp script is executed.  TeX has the same problem. 

In most cases the -recorder option is sufficient.  The first file
which appears in the output is the format file.  KPATHSEA_DEBUG starts
a bit earlier: it also displays ARGV[0], texmf.cnf, and ls-R files.

KPATHSEA_DEBUG is not a replacement for a tool like strace.  However,
I rarely used strace for anything else but tracing fopen() calls.  And
the big advantage of KPATHSEA_DEBUG is that it works with all programs
which are using kpathsea, also on Windows.

BTW, KPATHSEA_DEBUG is described in the kpathsea texinfo manual.

There _is_ something like strace for Windows.  Thomas Esser mentioned
it some time ago but unfortunately I forgot its name.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Does pdftex peek at the .tfm files to compare checksums?

TL20070212,

$ pdflatex -recorder grafguide

I looked at screen output (in an emacs buffer) and the .log file.  On
linux, struss reports opening the .tfm files, e.g.,

open("/mnt/hdb/opt/tex/texlive/20070212/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/cm/cmss10.tfm",
O_RDONLY) = 6

but searching the emacs shell buffer or grepping the log, cmss10 only
shows in the list of fonts as cmss10.pfb.

You can get a Windows user to replace "pdflatex ..." with "strace
pdflatex ..." but there usually isn't env.exe to set environment
variables as in "env KPATHSEA_DEBUG=4 pdflatex ...".  On *X you can
rename pdftex to pdftex.bin and replace pdftex with a wrapper script
that sets environment variables.

Many of the problems I've encountered have been with the user's files,
so I was able to debug things by copying to a *X machine, but there
are
also cases where the problems with old versions of files on the user's
machine (e.g., copied over from a friend's emtex).

Cmd.exe captures stderr, but throws most of it away and doens't have

http://www.bindview.com/Resources/RAZOR/Files/strace-0.3.zip

But,
<http://www.bindview.com/Services/RAZOR/Utilities/Windows/strace_readme.cfm>
says:

"Strace works on NT4 SP4, SP5, and SP6; Windows 2000 GA, SP1, SP2, and
SP3, and has preliminary support for Windows XP. On Windows XP, it is
necessary to set the registry key

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
Management\EnforceWriteProtection

to REG_DWORD 0. and reboot before using strace.

This disables the kernel from checking for errant memory overwrites,
and is not a good thing, in general. It is currently necessary for
strace because the system call table is write protected, and strace
needs to modify it. Hopefully, a better solution will be found."

when you specify the option -recorder, the output is written to the *.fls file.

therefore, you should look not at the screen output, but at the

I suppose that "env KPATHSEA_DEBUG=4 pdflatex ..." will not work on
Windows anyway, but you can probably write a small program/batch file
named "kdebug" which takes "pdflatex ..." as an argument and runs
pdflatex in a subshell "cmd32 -c <command>".  

It behaves like "/bin/bash -c <command>".  Set KPATHSEA_DEBUG in this
subshell.  What a user has to do is to call "kdebug pdflatex ...".

Of course, kdebug should have an option which allows to pass arbitrary
values to KPATHSEA_DEBUG.

But what we need is to write stderr to a file or pass it to a pipe
instead of printing it on screen.

The TL 2007 iso.zip file is on

and will presumably make it around the rest of CTAN in due course.

So I've updated the web pages at http://tug.org/texlive.  I also took
this opportunity to reorganize them into several smaller pages instead
of (basically) one big one.

Apparently the images went to DVD/CD production a couple of days ago.

cmd.exe supports the redirection: 2>err.log, while command.com does
not support it. In this case, one can define an environment variable:
set KPATHSEA_DEBUG_OUTPUT=err.log  (defined for Windows only).

Apparently ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/Images/ has both the "inst" and
"live" images, while the link provided by Karl has only the "live"
image.

right.  at karl's suggestion, i don't mirror the inst image (cambridge
is the portal for texlive->ctan).

whether it's reasonable for ctan to hold it depends on whether a
significant number of people actually want it: i'm inclined to agree
with karl.  (after all, the image we _do_ hold contains everything the
inst image has, and includes lots of other stuff -- notably much more
"install" stuff than is on the inst image.)

However, the readme file says that there are two images, live and inst.

IMO, it's probably worth providing the inst image, for the sake of  
people who want to be able to burn a CD. It might be good to add a  
note to the readme, though, mentioning the limited range of systems  
supported by inst.

good work

There seem to be a small problem on the web page.

The link "Highlights of changes" does not jump any where on
http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/live.html

There are no corresponding name tag for it.

Subject: [tex-live] Conflicting binary/format names: platex is polish and
	japanese
Message-ID: <87abz981y4.fsf@riesling.zuerich.kuesterei.ch>

Dear fellow TeX developers,

there are two TeX formats that use the name "platex", the Japanese ptex
project as well as PLaTeX, a LaTeX with preloaded polish settings and
fonts.  Debian GNU/Linux now has packages for both, but they cannot be
installed and used at the same time: Both use a symlink platex (once to
ptex, once to pdftex), and both want to load platex.fmt.

Even on single-user-systems people might want to have installed both
(polish scientists working about Japan, or the other way round), but on
large multi-user installations (e.g. at universities) it might be even
more needed.

What do you think about that?  Should both rename their formats?  

TIA, Frank

While PLaTeX certainly makes sense for a polish latex, I can't see how
is it a must-be-named-that-way for a Japanese language TeX-related
project.
>From what I see, the name of the project is Publishing TeX. Abreviated
as publtex (or something else, I just made that up because apparently
ptex, putex and pubtex are already used), it would still be OK.
Perhaps we should ask just them to rename their format?

I think platex by ASCII corp. is too famous and too prevailing in
Japan to rename into the other name.
I understand the situation may be the same for Polish platex.
I have no idea.

Thanks,

Thank you, I was not even able to figure out the meaning of ptex.

I think foremost Karl deserves a big THANK YOU for all the work he has
done for the release. Of course not only him, also all the upstream
authors, the binary builders, the Win team.

I don't think it is desirable for CTAN to hold the inst image, because
then people will download it, try to install it, and complain that their
system is not on there.  It already happened several times just during
test.  I believe that the number of people who want to burn physical
CD's is pretty minuscule.

As for having it on tug, well, the image is there.  I don't feel the
need to widely advertise it.  I tried to improve the description in the
HEADER.html in the Images directory, which also ends up in CTAN.

Too late to modify the readme now, unfortunately.  I did attempt to make
it clear on the web pages, among other places.

Hmm, I reported that problem some years ago, but failed to receive any 
answer...
1. ptex (and Japanese platex) is not available on CTAN
2. that has never been a part of teTeX
3. Polish platex package (and format) has been available on teTeX for ~10 
   years (or perhaps more). It is also available on CTAN. 
4. I know that *some* Linux distributions added ptex to *changed* teTeX, 
   but unfortunatelly without rethinking things. Sorry, both Thomas and me
   cannot care what silly things people can do.

Of course I would be happy if we can find any consent for future 
distributions.

i wonder why a special format is needed for (Polish) platex at all?
why can't you just use the standard latex format, like all other languages?
looking at platex.ini, it just loads latex.ltx.

are there technical reasons why platex is needed, and the standard
latex is not sufficient?

Best,
v.

Hello Dr. Frank and other members,

This is Hideaki Togashi of ASCII Co. in Japan.

Thank you for your contacting to us.

I've been worrying about this matter.  But we couldn't do nothing.

pTeX was developed as jTeX on 1987, and pTeX (publishing TeX) was
opend to public on 1989.  Since then, we Japanese have used the names
'ptex' and 'platex', and we are accustomed to the names.  It took a
very long time for us to recognize the existence of Polish TeX.  It
was on teTeX we found Polish TeX as far as I can remember.

For now, first of all, I let some pTeX members (including people
outside of ASCII Co.) know your e-mail, and asked them any idea.  I
hope there may be some good solution to this problem.

Cheers,

--

If this relates to ptex naming please mind your language. The Japanese
ptex exists since 1987, which is quite long.

We want to work together to find a decent solution...

We (Polish users) are very sorry using "platex" name for so many years. 
The problem is that ptex  (and platex) never existed on CTAN, considered
as an *absolute* reference for the TeX related stuff. (btw., why?)

As I recall, the only problem while introducing separate platex format was
that (Polish) platex also uses _private_ hyphen.cfg. As we encountered the
babel package broken several times in the past, we decided just to avoid
all the problems related to babel and make separate format file :-) 

[btw. it is something strange that canonical latex format file is still
dependent on hyphen.cfg provided by the *external* (for the *base* latex
distribution!) package. In our opinion, it simply breaks the whole latex's
prerequisites; but sorry, it is another story, nothing against latex
and/or babel.]

As we hopefully received some opinions from our Japanese friends, I still
believe that we can find some good solution. But I'm afraid, it will take
some time to propagate and change all existing distibutions (teTeX,
MiKTeX, fpTeX, TeX Live, as well as users' accustoms, etc.). As I see, the
consequence for the distributions would be also changing Polish "platex"
(also in directory names!) to something different, say, pollatex (it is,
e.g., important to the TeXLive's packaging concept!, not to mention CTAN
and Catalogue)

All in all, I think that Polish "platex" would follow all the above just
to meet and welcome Japanese needs.

Kind regards,

fpTEX and teTeX a are dead. I don't know about MikTeX, but I'm sure
there won't be problems with TeX Live adopting it. After all, it's TeX
Live developer who pointed out this issue.

    there won't be problems with TeX Live adopting it. 

Well, TeX Live will follow whatever Staszek wants to do :).

Staszek, are you really proposing to rename Polish platex?

Does the name conflict really cause problems in practice?

Why not? My idea is to make happy people also in Japanese, Chinese,

ctan's considered a reference source, on the grounds that the previous
situation was such a complete shambles -- you might hear that a package
existed, but you then had to investigate where copies might exist, and
to evaluate which of those copies was current.

look at CTAN:obsolete/help/tex-styles-and-macros.txt as a snapshot of
what life was like back then.  (it was even worse for us in the uk: when
i first started using networks, we didn't have ip networking, and had to
submit quota-restricted batch jobs on an overloaded gateway machine, to
retrieve things from outside of the country.)

[nothing of which is to do with the discussion at hand, but does explain
why we in europe and the usa got to our state of regarding the ctan as
the standard source of tex material.  in the earliest days, users in the
far east were so isolated from the "simple" world of latin scripts, they
presumably never perceived our confusion and weren't impressed by its
solution.  which is my guess ... not something anyone's ever told me.]

I too have guilty of too little reading of manuals.   I have been used
to solving tex problems using system tools but now find that I need to
tell others how to solve problems for themselves (often on Windows
machines).   The problems associated with user leaving old files
around where latex finds them have been growing (many people never
delete files, which they can do since disks are cheap, so the number
of old files is monotonically increasing).

Info and man pages aren't much help for most Win32. On *X, "man" is
getting to be a headache -- some systems generate pages of errors from
"awf",

:awf: /usr/people/gwhite/texlive/2005/texmf/doc/man/man1/pdftex.1,99:
command `.rb' unsupported or unknown

some use MANPATH, others use /etc/man.conf).  Info only helps the kind
of people who like emacs.

If you can find a Windows XP system that is actually working properly,
the "Help and Support" tool can be used to search for "redirection".
If you search for "HOME" one hit will be "Command shell overview",
which lists many environment variables.  Google then finds:

http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx?mfr=true

WinEDT seems to have 2 ways to run pdflatex, either directly via
macros or via a batch file in a cmd window, but many users are
intimidated by the WinEDT configuration tools, much less willing to
muck around in the macro files.

Sure, and in my youth I had to help my mother with her computer
problems by letting her spell out punch cards over the phone "no wait,
I think that hole in row 9 is actually in the fourteenth column" --
groan -- and trying to replicate the problem on my CDC 6400 in my
bathroom (computer nerds were supposed not to be picky about personal
hygiene, so that internal redecoration was quite appropriate) before
the coin-operated electricity meter ran out.

Yes, you can't have "$wherever/bin/platex" both being a symlink to ptex and
pdftex, and TEXMFVAR/web2c/platex.fmt being both a polish and a japanese
dump... 

In other words, you can't have both installed on the same system, which
is bad in particular for multi-user systems.

Dear All Involved Parties ;)

As the maintainer of platex (the Polish one) I vote for dropping the
Polish platex format file.  I'm also open to renaming the directory in
the TeX inputs subtree.

The separate format file is no longer needed.  Typesetting in Polish is
perfectly possible with the default Babel-based format (provided Polish
hyphenation patterns are enabled).  [The 'Polish' hyphen.cfg was my
reaction to rather strange status of Babel which is not part of the
LaTeX kernel yet it adds some new user-visible commands to the format
file (e.g., \selectlanguage).  I used to claim that Babel breaks LaTeX
rules (see cfgguide, p. 5).  I still find it at best terribly misleading
that cfgguide points to Babel as a model for customizing hyphenation,
but if one follows that hint one ends up with a hyphen.cfg incompatible
with LaTeX's license.]

As for the directory in the inputs area, the main item there is
polski.sty --- a package for typesetting in Polish.  Other files are
mainly of historical importance (support for strange ways of encoding
Polish letters in source files) or will become such soon (support for
the 'PL' family of fonts being phased out by Latin Modern).

So I think it is acceptable to rename the directory after the main
package: polski/.


With best,
Marcin

  Looks like you have to point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location of your
libstdc++ (and to install it first if necessary, of course!).

  This is a buggy interaction between Solaris and the TECkit
configuration process, I think, but tweaking with your runtime library
path works. How do the other people here compiling on Solaris do, by the

There is no LD_LIBRARY_PATH set here, the admin is fed up with problems
created by this environment variable.

env LD_OPTIONS=-R/usr/local/lib Build solves the problem. 

I should have known better, sorry for the noise

Thanks a lot

You definitely don't have to apologize.

Hi,

seems if there is a ~/texmf/ directory tree, then .pk files generated by
gsftopk go there (and there also not into a texmf-var directory) instead
of into the existing ~/.texlive2007/...

This is a place where i won't expect the .pk file.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with dviout or kpse?
Message-ID: <45E1C46B.70001@erlenweg.de>

Hello

I'm just testing TeXLive 2007 on XP:
My LaTeX project includes *.eps/*.pdf files from
texmf-local/tex/latex/myletter.
Everything works fine with latex/dvips/gsview and pdflatex/acroread.

kpsewhich myfile.eps
shows
c:/texmf-local/tex/latex/myletter/myfile.eps.

When using dviout to display the dvi output of the project the included
graphics myfile.eps will not be found and not shown.

I also tried windvi from TeXLive 2005. Same result.

Both programs show myfile.eps if the file is placed into the project
directory.

Hi Hartmut,

    seems if there is a ~/texmf/ directory tree, then .pk files generated by

Hmm, I don't see anything that would cause TEXMFHOME to necessarily be
used.  I don't think it happens for me, though I'm not sure I'm
reproducing the exact situation.  Can you send your yy.tex?

And, can you run sh -vx mktexpkf from the command line?  And I believe
the critical thing is the mktexnam call around line 198, so once that
exact invocation is known, running sh -vx of that from the command line
will probably turn up the answer.

Thanks,
karl

here it is:

\pdfmapline{} \font\ptmr ptmr8r at 10pt \ptmr abc \bye

> And, can you run sh -vx mktexpkf from the command line?

$sh -vx mktexpk ptmr8r 1200

gives the attached mktexpk.log.

dviout is an independent application and it does
not use Kpathsea.

Solution (1):
  put myfile.eps in the current working directory
Solution (2):
  write the directory name for pictures:
  c:\texmf-local\tex\latex\myletter
  in 
  Option ---> Setup Parameters ---> Graphic ---> gdat:
  ( Menu of dviout )

Thanks,

Message-ID: <8570be060702252207l1c6696ex5ff3a0d2e1b2da8e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

After migrating from teTeX to TeXLive, I'm experiencing something
strange with the Lucida font set. What happens is that LaTeX works
perfectly well after calling \usepackage{lucidbry}. But ConTeXt seems
to have much trouble finding the TFM file for the math fonts (if I
remove all the math-related script, it works...) After some
preliminary research, I think it might have been caused by the font
abbreviations in the `special.map' file; for example, "lbmo" relates
to "yandy  lumath".

Anyway, the error message is here:

kpathsea: Running mktextfm lbmo
mkdir: ././Users/Colin/.texlive2007/texmf-var/fonts/tfm: Permission denied
mktextfm: mktexdir
/Users/Colin/.texlive2007/texmf-var/fonts/tfm/yandy/lumath failed.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log. !
Font \*lucida7ptmmmirm*:=lbmo at 7.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file
not fo und.

I don't quite understand how special.map works, and why mktextfm is
trying to build the /yandy/lumath directory, since ConTeXt is
instructed to use the map file ``texnansi-bh-lucida''....

Any input will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Colin

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/mktexnam ptmr8r 600 modeless

So we'd need the output of 

sh -vx /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/mktexnam ptmr8r 600 modeless

Due to bandwidth concerns, we can no longer afford to have the inst
image on ftp://tug.org for public consumption.  Despite semi-hiding it
from view and my disrecommending it for use, it's found by too many people.

So: can anyone offer to host it on a separate ftp site?  It's not that
it in itself is so terribly much traffic, it's just a problem for tug in
conjunction with everything else.  It is 700mb.  (FTP is better than
http for big files because (we've found) too many useless spiders follow
http links.)

It doesn't make sense to have it on CTAN for the same reasons, plus
those I previously wrote.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Colin,

    abbreviations in the `special.map' file; for example, "lbmo" relates
    to "yandy  lumath".

I don't think special.map is the problem.  Without special.map, lbmo
would be using the directory linotype/bulmer (lbm in fontname-land).
Anyway, those are just intermediate directories under fonts/, it doesn't
really matter.

    since ConTeXt is instructed to use the map file
    ``texnansi-bh-lucida''....

I am unfamiliar with that map file (as well as with ConTeXt and Lucida
in general).  However, I can say this: lbmo.tfm isn't a tfm file in the
current Lucida distributions (and hasn't been in years, since the demise
of Y&Y).

I don't know if anyone on the lucida at tug.org list (or here) has made
updated ConTeXt support; you might ask.  Unfortunately I don't know the
names of the math tfm's offhand, although I seem to recall that Walter
Schmidt and I put them into one of the Lucida doc files.  All the docs
and tfm's (everything but the pfb's) are on CTAN.

Best,
Karl

Well, that does really point to the need to distribute
it using BitTorrent, IMHO.  The problem is, the vast
majority of BT trackers are given over 99.99% to porn
and/or illegal music, and even those that treat these
as fringe activities are still heavily overloaded because
of the large amount of other dubious material that can
so easily be distributed thereby.  What we /need/ is a
BT-for-CTAN tracker, access to which would be restricted
to members of a recognised TeX user group.  How, I wonder,
might one go about setting one up ?  Does any Board/CTAN/TeX-Live
member have experience of such things ?

Would fragmentation using jigdo help ? I mean, replacing one single
download task by a multitude of independent wget downloads ?
The global download time is higher due to overhead, but the
download procedure is more flexible.

Thanks a lot for this prompt decision. We really appreciate that with
your help a solution is found!

i have sufficiently little experience that i didn't even know what to

FWIW, I was less than impressed when I tried it. Apart from the fact that 
the linux software came with bad docs and an unusable user interface, I 
got more upload than download bandwidth - not good for my home connection 
where my maximum upload bandwidth is about a 12th of my maximum download 
bandwidth.

Well, using KTorrent (of the KDE suite), you can configure this quite
easily.  I'm sure that other, similar front-ends can do the same.

At that time, I foolishly wanted to use a command line program.

Is it bandwith or transfer volume? If it's the latter, maybe tug
should move the server somewhere else. Many hosting providers now
offer servers with unlimited volume. DANTE uses this.

I'll ask around.
I know duke university hosts some open source bt trackers (IE fedora).
I'm not affiliated with them but know some people.

I may put it on ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/TL2007/
(I am just downloading ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/* there).
Site is on the academic backbone, I hope no problems should appear.
Where is the image to download?

beware: i've explicitly said "no" to this, on the grounds of traffic
impact.  so that's two sites (cam.ctan.org, tug.org), both also on
academic backbones, who have declined to hold this image.

on present progress, the existence of the new texlive will have
increased my monthly traffic totals by at least a factor of 2, probably
more.

As far as traffic is concerned, I do not think that ftp.cstug.cz
(mirroring full CTAN) aka ftp.muni.cz (as an main ftp for university 
with 40000+ students) aka ftp.linux.cz (mirroring redhat, fedora and other
stuff) would have troubles with one 700 MB image.
(several 10GB and DWDM connections to the world via CESNET2 network).

This could be a bad .iso file (was the md5sum OK?), insufficient space
on the local
disk, or disk failures.   There may be more useful information in
dmesg or /var/log/messages.

TL2007 nearly fills a CD.  My CD reader, which had never given a
problem before, failed on TL2007.  I took the cover off and cleaned up
the accumulation of dusty grease at the end of the slide (a relatively
easy thing to do) It now works fine, so I assume lack of use with
nearly full disks meant the slide travel was being limited by dried up
lubricants mixed with dust.

hello - this is a short version of some messages sent to comp.text.tex 
today.

I manage a cluster of computers with texlive 2005 installed; in 
texmf-local there are several commercial fonts, in particular the 
complete mathtime and lucida packages that are used by several users.  I 
installed texlive 2007 on the side, and changed TEXDIR and so on to use 
it; immediately complaints came.

in short: you have erased mathtime.sty from TL07 but left there mt-yy.map 
and mt-plus.map; you have erased the lucida map, tfm and vf files but left 
the lucidabr.sty and other support files.

if you want to suppress mathtime/lucida support, please:
1) TELL.  the "highlights of changes in the current release" page in the
    texlive site says nothing.
2) ERASE ALL, and not half of the files.

solution:
1) files in texlive 2007 that should NOT be there.  they are useful only
    for mathtime/lucida.  move them from the texlive tree to texmf-local.

texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/mt-yy.map
texmf/fonts/map/dvips/tetex/mt-plus.map
texmf-dist/source/latex/psnfssx/lucidabr*
texmf-dist/tex/latex/psnfssx/luc*
texmf-dist/vtex/config/lu*.ali

2) files to be copied from the texlive 2005 tree into texmf-local in order
    to deal with mathtime/lucida fonts

texmf-dist/tex/latex/mathtime/*
texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/lucida/*
texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/bh/*
texmf-dist/fonts/vf/bh/*
texmf-dist/tex/latex/lucida/*

teshash
updmap-sys --disable belleek.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=mt-yy.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=mt-plus.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=lucidabr.map
updmap-sys --enable Map=lumath.map

 			PERSONAL NOTE (IMPORTANT)
 			=========================

the basic reason to have a texmf-local tree, is that you can upgrade the 
basic system keeping the local additions.  now, I cannot keep in two 
parallel trees /usr/local/texlive/2005/ and /2007/ together with the same 
texmf-local and switch between them changing the TEXDIR and siblings 
environment variables; 2005 and 2007 require a different texmf-local.  in 
short, the same reason to have a texmf-local has been compromised by your 
choice that I see as a VERY VERY BAD MOVE.

    Would fragmentation using jigdo help ? 

The last time someone explained jigdo to me, it seems it doesn't really
help for TL.  The explanation I got was that jigdo helps when there is a
released ISO, and then sometime later there is an updated ISO, where
most of the files inside are the same.  This doesn't really apply to
TL's more-or-less yearly release cycle.

BitTorrent seems more promising, but I have no real knowledge of it and
no way to set it up.  When I tried at one point, I ran into many of the
same issues Rainer did.

I've asked for bittorrent volunteers on TL web pages for a couple of
years now.  Some time ago, one person set it up
(http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html), but then I got another report
recently that it wasn't working.  There's nothing I can do but hope
someone else can make it happen ...

Best,
Karl

Refraining from any reference to O/S wars, I have no
problem using BT under Windows :-)))  I'll try to
locate information on installing a BT Tracker shortly.

That was using an external tracker; I am convinced we need
one of our own.

Does Tug.Org and/or the CTAN hosts support PHP and MySQL ?
These seem to be the common requirement for all the BT
trackers I have been able to locate.  A fairly comprehensive
list can be found here :

Sure, but it allows also to download the files subdir by subdir 
and to build locally the iso image: in other terms, you download files
from the original file tree; you only need to build the iso image on server side
to create what is called the template file, i.e. the structure of the iso
image to be reconstructed.

In fact, the iso image appears there as a middleware result between
native file publishing and iso image publishing, obtained
in a controlled way (md5 sums of each and every subdownload, 
download recovery guaranteed in case of data link failure, etc): it's
uses a direct download of files, which is the result 
if you use the iso image locally by mounting it.

To summarize, jigdo needs a server side repository of the original files,
and a temporary iso image used to build the .jigdo and .template files
(once used, it can be removed). The level of fragmentation of the jigsaw
is set by the jigdo-file command.
It could work as is for the inst CD; however if you plan to use it
for the live DVD, you will need to publish the 1.8 Go uncompressed version,
I guess, or publish compressed versions of subrirectories, to create an iso
image pf compressed data.

OK, thanks Rainer : it looks as if "The Pirate Bay"
might be a good starting point (registrations open),
so maybe we start there and only run a dedicated
tracker if TUG members experience problems registering
with The Pirate Bay.  What do you think ?

Karl, he's right. When you pulled the inst image from tug.org, the mirrors 
followed. I cannot find it either.

Can you give me access to it somewhere, so that I can install it on 
dante.ctan.org?

Subject: [tex-live] Execution time on Solaris Sparc
Message-ID: <200702281118.l1SBIvT08239@cressida.cert.fr>

Hello,

After installation of TL2007 from live, I was surprised to have
a big difference in execution time on the same documents,
as compared to TL2005; here are the data on two different examples,
one big report (288 pages) and on simple pdflatex task
(binding using pdfpages).

I compiled also from source, and the data shown are real/user.
No swap, no other intensive computing tasks.

           TL 2005       TL 2007 live     TL2007 source
latex      4.9/4.2       15.0/10.1         16.3/10.1
pdflatex   1.4/0.8       22.9/7.4          16.6/7.3   

You may see that the user time is consistent between source and live,
the real time diff for the pdflatex compilation is due to a bunch of
messages about font being in 
...pdftex.map): invalid entry for `grmo1000': both ps_name 
and font file missing
This may be due to a missing collection at installation time
(I did two separate installations for live and source).

Between 2005 and 2007 the difference both in user and in real are quite
big, particularly for pdflatex.
The task stalls from time to time during package loading (waiting times
before the format loading and the class loading, etc).

Any clue ?

Message-ID: <20070228131002.GD21206@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

Disclaimer: I have no idea about Hebrew typesetting!

A user of the Debian TeX Live packages brought to our attention a
problem when using hebrew/babel: The file hebrew.ldf in Babel declares
teh encoding LHE, so loading it searches for lhrcmr.fd, which is also
shipped by babel. But lhecmr.fd declares:
\DeclareFontShape{LHE}{cmr}{m}{n}
      {<-> jerus10 }{}
and the font jerus10 is *NOWHERE* available. I have searched the
internet a bit, the ftp sites mentioned in the CTAN fonts/hebrew/ unix
install document etc etc. The only place I could find it is in Debian's
	ivritex
package (which ships very old hebrew.ldf...). I attach the file I found
there (jerus10.mf).

I have no idea nor suggestion how to proceed with this, but I think
either the hebrew font setup should be changed to available fonts or at
least some documentation included where to get the fonts, or or or???

Thanks a lot for any suggestions

Norbert

The download page of http://ivritex.sourceforge.net/ has a tar.gz which
contains this file.  Ah, and it is also in

how is security handled with an external repository service? E. g. how
easy is it for some agressor to replace some binary? It looks safer as
long as it's hosted at or around TUG (or pressed into DVDs).

The configure problem, I meant...

Some feedback about the compilation from source:
 - the compilation first failed because I have the E variable set in my 
environment. 
 - then 
unsetenv E
 env LD_OPTIONS=-R/usr/local/lib Build 
fails on 
./Work/utils/pdfopen/config/install-sh being not executable.

Once the x bit set on this file, Build on Sparc-Solaris8 is successful.

There must be somewhere in a Makefile a reference to $EXXXX
instead of $(EXXXX)...

Then, the config procedure
texhash
updmap-sys
fmtutil-sys --all
is successful, unlike using the binaries coming with live, where fmtutil
failed on three formats:
 This is a summary of all `failed' messages and warnings:
 `xetex -ini  -jobname=xetex -progname=xetex -etex xetex.ini' failed
 `xetex -ini  -jobname=xelatex -progname=xelatex -etex xelatex.ini' failed
 `xetex -ini  -jobname=cont-en -progname=context -8bit *cont-en.ini' failed
However the TDS may explain this, I made two distinct installations, one
from inst with the live binaries (sorry, I thought the solaris binaries
came with it as usual), one from live with the compiled source.

We can host md5s at tug/ctan.

AFAIK, it is inmpossible for someone to replace a torrent.
Once I have located an inst .iso, I will create and
upload the torrent and you will be welcome to verify
my assertion !

Hi Jean-Pierre,

    ...pdftex.map): invalid entry for `grmo1000': both ps_name 

It seems to me you have answered your own question.  You say it's
looking for fonts that don't exist.  That is always time-consuming.  So
the question would seem to be why grmo1000.tfm et al. aren't listed
correctly in the .map's, and/or not present in your trees and/or ls-R's.

Since you are apparently doing your own custom installation procedures,
obviously I don't know how this came about.  They are installed by
default, and I believe I even ran a document with them at one point.

For myself, I see no meaningful speed difference between any TeX version
ever released.  I'm sure it is something about the support files, not
TeX itself.

1. Regarding inst, Petr Sojka has graciously offered to host the inst
   image (and analogous "extra" images, for protext and mactex).  Thanks
   Petr!  They're available at 
ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/TC2007/
http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/TC2007/

I expect them to be available from other sites soon, and will update
the web pages.

2. Regarding jigdo, thank you, Jean-Pierre, for all the information.
   However, as I've said, I have no expertise in these things, or time
   available to look into it.  All the TL releases are fully available.
   If you or anyone can set it up to work with jigdo in whatever way
   makes sense, great, I will be very happy to update the web pages, and
   I bet users will be happy too -- but tug.org cannot host anything new.

3. Regarding bittorrent, Philip, I hope you can set it up as well.  It
   would be great.

Thanks,
Karl
