Karl,

I tried the (inst) images, and they work well on Mac OS X (PPC) 10.4.8, 
except for one thing. Indeed, fmtutil.cnf has two entries for pdftex, 
the first one without a hyphenation file and the second one with 
language.def. I think the second one is actually the line corresponding 
to pdfetex (which now depends on pdftex), and therefore should read

pdfetex         pdftex          language.def 
-translate-file=cp227.tcx	*pdfetex.ini

Am I right?


Thanks,

Artemio

I just uploaded new binaries for x86_64-linux.  

The reason is that current binaries did not provide the latest version
of pdftex.

Hi,
I've tried compiling TL on OpenBSD 4.0/i386.

Issues:
- the freetype2 configure needs either a gnu-make as make, or in the
variable $GNUMAKE. $MAKE is ignored. :-(
- the configure scripts expect fontconfig includes and lib to be under
ohne root; this is not the case on OpenBSD. I have
/usr/X11R6/include/fontconfig/ and
/usr/X11R6/lib/libfontconfig.so.3.0. I think we need
--with-fontconfig-libdir and --with-fontconfig-include.

I don't know how the variables work, but GNU make is definitely a  
requirement (also for the ICU libs, I believe). Personally, I'd  
probably just make a symlink.

I think it should work to use --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6 in this  
case, as the scripts will then expect to find include/ and lib/  
directories under this (and the fontconfig headers are always placed  
in a further fontconfig/ dir, so that source files typically say  
"#include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>".

you may either export GNUMAKE yourself, or export TL_MAKE
and use the Build script which will then export the GNUMAKE for you.

it looks like the one root - i.e. --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6 should
work.

That seems to work; at least configure is happy. Now compiling fails with

It looks like you need a threads library, but I don't know the exact  
details. Try adding -lpthread to the link command and see if that  
works. If so, we'll need to figure out how to add this to the  
configure script.

Hmmm.... that's a bit worrying; I haven't seen that before. Do the

Please excuse me that I didn't respond earlier but I had been very
confused that I have two different versions of pdfTeX on my system.

I found out that the x86_64-linux binaries on the test image did not
provide the latest pdftex release.  Hence I uploaded new binaries for
this platform last night.

No idea, I'm not a PDF expert, but it seems to have something to do
with cmap.sty.

Yes, after I applied your patch, the warnings don't appear any more.


Regarding the manual:
First of all, many thanks to Martin for uploading the latest version to
the TeXLive repository and many thanks to Pawel for maintaining it.

However, there are a few issues which bother me.  They are not so
important that it makes sense to fix them immediately.  It would be
nice if things can be improved in next year's release.

1. In the screen version of the manual (pdftex-s.pdf) the text is
   surrounded by a dark blue box.  The horizontal distance between the
   text and the box is *much* too small.  The manual makes use of
   character protrusion and in this case it is not desirable to have
   verical structures close to the text.  The distance between the
   text and the box should be at least 2em.

2. The title pages of the versions which are intended for printing are
   lacking a binding margin.  A simple fix would be to increase all
   margins and use a smaller font.

3. The manual still uses the URW fonts with the broken "T" and "D".
   It would be nice if future versions will use Jacko's fonts instead,
   TeX-Gyre Pagella in this case.

4. The title "The pdfTeX user manual" is typeset in a very huge font.
   This consumes a lot of ink.  Maybe something like this is more

BTW., the above code uses new pdftex features (\pdfsave \pdfrestore).
I must admit that I didn't read the manual before I used them (maybe I
should).  I got the information from Martin's announcement.  I doubt
that Martin's announcements can be a replacement for a real user
manual.  But they are extremely good and I've never seen such useful
announcements anywhere else.

In this respect, the released version seems to be the same as rc4:
I see the warning with cmap.sty.

i think that this is happening because both cmap.sty and the new
pdftex try to assign the /ToUnicode font attribute: cmap.sty directly
via \pdffontattr and the new pdftex internally via it's new feature:

- Fonts:
  - support for subfonts: This creates all needed map entries for subfonts
    automatically and handles Unicode mappings
  - ToUnicode entries for Type1 fonts (patch 580)

probably pdftex should not auto-assign the /ToUnicode mapping if a
macro-package does this explicitly.

Subject: [tex-live] update to pdftex.def to tale advantage of the

Message-ID: <87d55ymfeo.fsf@vvv.vsu.ru>

Hi!

since the new pdftex has improvements related to transformations:

  - Transformation matrices can now be manipulated more cleanly:
    Currently matrix changes are done and hidden inside \pdfliteral nodes;
    pdfTeX doesn't parse its contents and does not know the new settings of
    the transform matrix. Thus the new primitives to save pdfTeX from
    parsing \pdfliteral contents and to notify pdfTeX about matrix changes
    to use them in calculating link and anchor positions.
    - \pdfsetmatrix{<a> <b> <c> <d>}
      is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{<a> <b> <c> <d> 0 0 cm}
    - \pdfsave is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{q}
    - \pdfrestore is the equivalent to \pdfliteral{Q}

it would be nice to make pdftex.def aware of these new features.

advantage: the links in rotated text will finally properly work, which
is a long-awaited feature.

Please, don't use this version any more.
An official version is now available: 2007/01/01 v0.04a.

Regarding TeX Live:
It seems that nobody has tested the patch (except me and I am not
finished). The patch solves two long-standing problems, but a
serious risk for bugs remains yet.

please include the latest version to the TL repository.

BTW, while the pdftex.def homepage

http://pdftex-def.berlios.de/

contains a ZIP and TGZ files with the latest version, the
CVS repository pointed to from that homepage:

http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pdftex-def/pdftex.def/

is outdated.

maybe it should be removed, if it's not used, to avoid confusion?

No, I don't think so. It's untidy, but both TECkit and zlib end up  
typedef'ing Byte as unsigned char.

Martin, what does "freetype-config --version" report on your system?  
(Just curious.... what version of freetype2 that is installed in /usr/ 
X11R6?)


Here's what I *think* is going on; maybe someone can confirm whether  
my understanding sounds right.

- XeTeX is built (by default) using the copy of Freetype2 in the TL  
source tree. This is currently v2.2.1. We build this as a static  
library and link with it, so that xetex's use of Freetype2 is  
entirely independent of what's installed (or not) in the host platform.

- On the other hand, we link dynamically with the host's  
libfontconfig, as this seems to be the best way of finding the user's  
"installed" fonts. It is likely that libfontconfig, in turn, depends  
on libfreetype (installed .so library). Therefore, xetex inherits a  
dependency on the installed libfreetype, in addition to having its  
own statically-linked freetype2 routines.

- These two versions of Freetype2 have some incompatible structures  
(either the actual definitions have changed, or they were built with  
different compilers or options such that the structure sizes turned  
out different).

- In principle, there would be a problem if the same Freetype2  
structures were accessed both directly (using the statically-linked  
version) and through fontconfig APIs (which would lead to the  
dynamically-linked lib). But xetex doesn't do this; any use of the  
host system's libfreetype.so is internal to fontconfig and does not  
interact with xetex's own use of freetype2.

- Therefore, I don't think it matters if these two freetype2 versions  
are incompatible, as this warning indicates. Martin, if you can try  
the test I described for Olaf recently (see "Testing XeTeX IRIX  
build", Dec 28), that would help to confirm this.

- However, we obviously don't want a program that prints warnings  
like this each time it's used!


So what do we do?

- One option would be to build xetex without the static libfreetype  
from TL (--using-system-freetype2 might work for this, though I  
haven't tested this lately). However, this would presumably mean that  
if the installed FT2 is updated, the xetex binary may break.

- Another possibility might be to statically link fontconfig as well  
as freetype2, like the rest of the libraries used. However, my  
experience when I tried this some time back was that a static  
fontconfig build may not interoperate properly with the host  
platform's normal installation.

- If I'm right that the version mismatch does not actually matter,  
then all we really need is a way to suppress the warning messages  
from the loader. But I don't know how to do that.


Comments, corrections, and suggestions most welcome!

Oops, i really meant --ftversion .... which presumably reports 2.1.9,

    Therefore, xetex inherits a dependency on the installed libfreetype,
    in addition to having its own statically-linked freetype2 routines.

Yes.  On GNU/Linux, for example, ldd reports (among other things):
...
	libfontconfig.so.1 => /usr/lib/libfontconfig.so.1 (0x00b3f000)
	libfreetype.so.6 => /usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6 (0x00a74000)

    any use of the host system's libfreetype.so is internal to
    fontconfig and does not interact with xetex's own use of freetype2.

Let's hope.

    - However, we obviously don't want a program that prints warnings  
    like this each time it's used!

The warnings only happen on OpenBSD (and maybe FreeBSD? -- Manfred, does
running xetex --version produce any warnings for you?).  So we don't
need to change things on other platforms.

Martin, can you see if the OpenBSD ld has any kind of option to produce
a binary which avoids such warnings?  Does it use GNU ld?  I don't see
anything relevant in GNU ld, unfortunately.  Search around for the error
and see if it's come up before?  (Not necessary with freetype2.)

Failing that, my suggestion would be to link the OpenBSD xetex with the
system freetype2, instead of TL's freetype2.  Granted it creates a 
potential for problems, I see no better choice.  Better potential
problems than a dozen warnings on every invocation.

The opposite approach of doing all the work of incorporating fontconfig
into TL just for OpenBSD, and even then probably ending up with an
inferior binary, seems the wrong direction to me.

Btw: The xetex binary is currently broken on OpenBSD; Jonathan has

Dear All,

As many users still demanded a dvi previewer for win32, I'd like to 
announce that we have again it for TeX Live. Thanks to help and kind
suggestions from Akira Kakuto and Toshio Oshima, Tomasz Luczak succeded to 
include dviout and preconfigure it for TL during installation made by his 
tlpmgui installer. Anyway, as it was not so easy task, we ask for testing
and sending us any suggestions. Thanks in advance.

Ps. please have a look at iso image made today (20070103) or later.

Best greetings for all in the new 2007 year,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0701030151470.8906-100000@fam82.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

I'd like to announce still experimental (but very nice) GUI installer
for TL on Linux. This is an alternative for install-tl.sh and it uses 
quite the same logic. Please try running setuptl/tlpmgui.
After installation and setting the PATH, tlpmgui
can be run again to add (or remove) collections or individual packages
and to make some maintenance tasks. Both messages and help files can
be easily localized (we already have Chech/Slovak, English, German
and Polish; btw. we would like to ask our friends to check again and make 
small updates to "help" and "msgs" strings). 

tlpmgui can be quickly prepared for any other u*x platform having Tcl-Tk.
Please check
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/
for sources (there is also svn service for anybody interested).

We would like to ask for some suggestions:
1. we keep tlpmgui and auxiliary stuff in the separate to TL's bin 
   directory, so if we have such program for (some) other u*x platform,
   how should we (re)name it for each platform?
2. where to copy tlpmgui et all during installation for later use (adding/
   removing packages and maintenance)?

It seems that it would be quite easy to add to tlpmgui the possibility
to update packages from the network. All we need is to have available
ziped packages in the TL's repository (the packages are already updated 
all the year, anyway).

Thanks in advance for any comments,

 Will do with the new test image, haven't read your mail before parting
(without mail access).
 I have some comments, but maybe I should test with the newer image
before causing confusion.

No it doesn't, I could not even test as the texmfstart and ruby scripts
in general seem to be somehow non-functional:
	$ texmfstart texexec --mode=solution assignment-01
	the file 'texexec' is not found
	$ texexec assignment-01
	the file 'texexec.rb' is not found

But note that I have a full TeX installation (Debian texlive 2005), and
I have set the path
	export PATH=/usr/local/texlive2006/bin/i386-linux/:$PATH
so the 'right' texexec/texmfstart are found.

Ok, with export TLroot=... I could install it. Please mention it
somewhere.

I have already a TeX installation, and want to try TL2006 out. So maybe
the following error is due to some interference.

in the postinstall action:
error copying "/usr/local/texlive2006/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.us" to "/usr/local/texlive2006/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat": no such file or directory

There is no /usr/local/texlive2006/texmf-var, it was not created.

After clicking "Ok" in the error window tlpmgui seems to hang. No
action. The turning pointer. The status tells me
	Please wait ... Postinstall action ...
but nothing happens. ps ax does not show anything.


Furthermore, I always get a message:
	Write file tlpmgui.ini failed! Check permissions for write.
Of course I cannot write to the cd/loop image. Is this intended?

Best wishes

Norbert

Can you try these with a --verbose option on the commandline? That
should print some extra debug information.

Hmm, when you have already installed TL, tlpgui starts in maintenance
mode (to add/remove packages and collections, etc.).

Please send version of tlpmgui, see in top bar of window of tlpmgui.
Try run tlpmgui from console:
cd /directory/with/tlpmgui
./tlpmgui

You can try latest GUI installer from 
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/20070103-setuptl.tar.gz 
tlpm.pl have to be executable.

Hi,

I'm wondering why all texlive binaries are staticly linked to
libkpse, why don't we use dynamic linking?

Even if we don't use dynamic library, I do think a
libkpse.a/libkpse.lib will be needed, for now, if I wish to
modified a small program (afm2tfm, for example), I still
have to extract the whole sources archive, configure
and build kpathsea, that's too complicated. If we have
a SDK including header files and lib files, it will be much
easier for us to provide small patches.

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with dviout (Win32)
Message-ID: <426710900.20070103202106@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi all,

I tested TL (texlivetest2006-inst-20070103.iso) on a new Windows XP
(full install with perl & ghostscript). There are two problems with
dviout. 

1) As soon as the _hyperref_ package is included, dviout complains
   about an unknown special and gives a message box:

>Failed to make tmpps1.pbm by the command
>  C:\gs\gs8.54\bin\gswin32c.exe @tmp$.@@@
>
>The file tmp$.@@@ is a paramater file

   On using _Retry_ one gets the full message

>C:\ULPIR>C:\gs\gs8.54\bin\gswin32c.exe @tmp$.@@@
>Error: /undefined in SDict
>Operand stack:

>GPL Ghostscript 8.54: Unrecoverable error, exit code 1

2) As soon as non-standard fonts are used (tried pxfonts-,
   txfonts-packages), the font creation process fails with the
   following error message

>C:\ULPIR>C:\TeXLive2006\bin\win32\mktexpk.exe --dpi 1493 --bdpi 600 --mag 2+293/
>600 --destdir C:\TeXLive2006\texmf-var\fonts\pk\t1xbss t1xbss
>mktexmf: empty or non-existent rootfile!
>mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for t1xbss.

   Chosing _Ignore_ dviout shows empty pages and goes on giving
   messages like: 

>Searched C:\TeXLive2006\texmf-var\fonts\tfm\\t1xbss.tfm
>Searched C:\TeXLive2006\texmf-var\fonts\pk\\t1xbss.720pk
>Searched C:\TeXLive2006\texmf-var\fonts\pk\\t1xbss.721pk

   in the status window. PS-file creation via _dvips_ works - with the
   right fonts being used.


Furthermore it would be nice to have dviout added to the PATH during
installation, as even Windows users might sometimes prefer the use of
command line and (X)Emacs...

And finally a big THANKS to all the developers &  maintainers - you
are doing a terrific job.

Gregor

There is one thing which had been changed recently in install-tl.sh:

In TeXLive-2005 the default installation directory had been
/usr/local/texlive/2005 but you can change it the menu if you want.

However, install-tl.sh now looks for the environment variable
TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX.  If this variable is set, for example

  TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/texlive

and you start install-tl.sh it installs it at /opt/texlive/2006 but
you are still able to select any other directory in the
menu.  TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX only sets the default value.

If the variable is not set, /usr/local/texlive/2006 will be the
default.

There are two reasons for introducing this variable:

1. We now have a subdirectory for each year's version.  This is the
   only reasonable way to go and I'm sure that there is no need to
   change it in the future.  People can set TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX
   if they want and do not have to change anything when they install
   TeXLive-2008 or TeXLive-2294.  But the existence of this
   environment variable is not required, it's just for convenience.

2. Commandline completion doesn't work in shell scripts.  But without
   the readline library it doesn't make much fun to enter a new path.
   Hence it is more convenient to set TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

It would be nice if tlpm and tlpmgui could look for this variable too.
I don't think that many people make use of it but I feel happier if
similar programs behave similar.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

Ok. tlpmgui will looks for TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

Subject: [tex-live] How about deliver libkpse binaries?
In-Reply-To: <ddd65cda0701030954o2ddc99a4se54a5c87c12d122f@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <200701032316.l03NGlB24732@f7.net>

    I'm wondering why all texlive binaries are staticly linked to
    libkpse, why don't we use dynamic linking?

Because generating kpse as a dynamic library for TL would make it
impossible to install.  It's hard enough now.

    Even if we don't use dynamic library, I do think a
    libkpse.a/libkpse.lib will be needed, 

GNU/Linux distributions generally do that (and libkpathsea.so too).  I
don't imagine it is much fun for them.

    for now, if I wish to modified a small program (afm2tfm, for
    example), I still have to extract the whole sources archive,
    configure and build kpathsea, that's too complicated. 

Sorry.  That's how it is.  Most programs in TL have an independent
existence and releases, but afm2tfm (and dvips), do not (any more).

    If we have a SDK including header files and lib files, it will be
    much easier for us to provide small patches.

I don't necessarily disagree, but it is far from easy to create such an
SDK.  If someone wants to invest the significant time and effort to do
so, that's ok by me.  Don't underestimate the work.  To do a good job,
it would mean essentially becoming a co-maintainer of kpathsea.  It's
not something that can be done once and then left alone.


Meanwhile, how is the Chinese translation coming?  Can you send me
files yet?

Thanks,
Karl

Ok, I see the problems.  Let's go this way:

I'll report all problems we have to the ghostscript guys.  For TeXLive
it is not sufficient that they fix the bugs.  It is also required that
they provide a new version under GPL.  If they provide a usable GPL
version we'll use it, of course, otherwise we have to manage things
ourselves. 

If we can include a vanilla ghostscript which does what we need and
comes with its own installer it's certainly the best solution.  But it
has to be under GPL.

But we cannot rely on it, it is probably required that we have two
solutions in mind.  I'll discuss this with Staszek and Pawel at the
next conference anyway.  I'm sure we'll find a reasonable solution.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry, my suggestion for the setting of dviout was incomplete.
You have to tell dviout places of virtual fonts etc. as well as
those of pk fonts.

Please write all font-related directories in TEXROOT of dviout like

TEXROOT: c:\TL2006\texmf-var;c:\TL2006\texmf-dist;c:\TL2006\texmf

and set TEXPK of dviout as

TEXPK:  ^r\pk\\^s.^dpk;^r\vf\\^s.vf;^r\ovf\\^s.ovf;^r\tfm\\^s.tfm


Hi Gregor,
You can do manually the above setting yourself:
(1) Option ---> Setup Parameters... ---> Font  (Menu of dviout)
(2) Click "SAVE"
(3) Click "OK"

Thanks,
Akira

I have just committed some configure changes to TL; it should now  
work to use the option combination

   --with-fontconfig=/usr/X11R6
   --with-system-freetype2
   --with-freetype2-libdir=/usr/X11R6/lib
   --with-freetype2-include=/usr/X11R6/include

to link (dynamically) against an installed Freetype2 library as found  
on OpenBSD, along with the usual fontconfig lib. This avoids the  
(harmless but scary!) version mismatch messages when starting a xetex  
(or xdvipdfmx) binary that was statically linked with Freetype2 from  
the TL tree.

For platforms where such warnings aren't produced (I've only seen  
this on OpenBSD so far), I'd suggest staying with the static build of  
freetype2 from the TL source tree (which is the default, no configure  
option needed for this), so as to ensure a known (recent) version is  
used.

In order to rebuild the configure scripts, I had to touch some of the  
pdftex stuff as well (the autoconf setup for libobsdcompat didn't  
seem to be quite right). I believe the current scripts work (tested  
on Mac OS X, Linux, and OpenBSD), but it would be good if Olaf or  
someone could check and tidy up.

A bug fix (potential crasher, depending on malloc() behavior) in  
xetex was also committed yesterday, so it would be good if this is

Almost there with HPux10.20, using a locally installed fontconfig:

however, still having problems with dvipng:

A shot in the dark: maybe try moving -lm to the end of the line,  
after the static libs?

(try it by hand in Work/texk/dvipng for a start; if it helps, we'll  
have to figure out how to fix it in the configure mess)

geez you guys are good. I moved -lm to the end of the line in the makefile to read:
LIBS = ../kpathsea/.libs/libkpathsea.a $(lib_libs) -lm

then from Work/ did 'make' and everything compiled fine from there.

thanks!

Missing -lm option when linking.  Probably worth reporting to the
dvipng maintainer?

Hmm.  xdvipdfmx uses FreeType 2, while ttf2pk uses FreeType 1.  These
are two completely different libraries (the former called libfreetype
and the latter libttf).

I think Jonathan provided fixes recently for the problem in the first
mail.

Within TeXLive, ttf2pk's `configure.ac' should be removed.

Hi Akira,

Works well (with change TL2006 -> TeXLive2006). What about including
texmf-local\fonts in TEXROOT of dviout? I thought that everything
user-/machine-specific should go there - including fonts (Futura in my 
case). 

By the way: With the standard options for installation, everything was
installed to C:\TeXLive2006 except texmf-local which was placed
directly on C:\. Is this intentional?

It does, thanks.

Message-ID: <0B29AB1D-7135-4AB9-B581-4C9B43336E83@rna.nl>

How do I make sure that .fmt files are put in a subdir of web2c by  
fmtutil? E.g.

	fmtutil --byfmt cont-en

produces

	web2c/cont-en.fmt

but what I want is

	web2c/pdftex/cont-en.fmt
	 web2c/xetex/cont-en.fmt

so cont-en.fmt is available for both pdfTeX and XeTeX and not one  
balks at finding a format produced by the other.

Ah, good point, thanks. I hope Tomasz will include it shortly.

Well, it follows the way of the TL project to keep texmf-local outside
TLRoot, for eg. quick uninstall/reinstall (quite the same is in MiKTeX).
You can install TL in any directory (or disk), btw.
 
Thanks for testing, and please keep on doing that, as we are rather in a 
hurry and need some help. You can always check
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/
get the latest *-setup.zip, unpack it in the local directory and play with
it only pointing to your current CD (or even mounted image file, just to
spare time for burning; see: http://www.daemon-tools.cc).
Please, remove your TL installation before, for a sake.

Thanks,

Hi,

sorry for the late response. The patch by Hartmut should
solve the problem.

to Hartmut:
> > > pdfTeX warning (\pdffontattr): font \^^@ has conflicting attributes
> is this a nullfont? how does one get it?

this font has been loaded from a virtual font, hence it
doesn't get any control sequence.

I made another patch, which is more or less the same as what
Hartmut did, plus some changes to make the warning more
meaningful. Don't be afraid by the length of the patch, it
just turns the module @<Print the font identifier for |font(p)|@>
to a function named print_font_identifier() so it can be called
with different parameters.

AFAIK, this would require a change to fmtutil or to the organization  
of things at a higher level.

You could use the --fmtdir option to control where the format files  
are placed, but you'd still get all the formats from a given run of  
the tool in a single place. (In fact, because it builds them all in a  
working directory, and then installs them, I believe the later cont- 
en.fmt would simply overwrite the earlier, and you'd only end up with  
one of them.)

If the format specifications were split into separate files, you  
could run fmtutil with the --cnffile and --fmtdir options to build  
the formats for each engine separately. But this would mean  
maintaining (at least) two separate "parts" of fmtutil.cnf, and  
therefore changes to the way this is managed by tools like texconfig.

IMO, a preferable solution would be to give fmtutil a new option -- 
use-engine-subdirs or something like that, and have it place the  
formats into ${engine} subdirectories of the destination. It would  
also have to be changed to install them as they're built, rather than  
building them all in the working dir and then installing en masse.

Others probably understand all this much better than I do, though....

This would be a good thing. For packaging context for Debian I have
created a script called ctxfmtutil which is not very intelligent, far
from what fmtutil is, but it puts the stuff into the right place, in
fact it calls texexec with the respective parameters to do this work.

It would be great to get fmtutil to this point where something like this
is possible, considering that context canbe run with engines like xetex,
aleph, pdftex, whatever, and all under the name cont-{en,fr,...}

You likely need to set TEXMFCNF to the web2c directory in the texlive
tree.  I got it to work well here by doing the following:

1. Downloaded the live texlive iso.bz2
2. bunzip2'ed it, and mounted it with -o loop in ~/admin/tex/texlive/image/
3. Prepended .../texlive/bin/i386-linux to PATH (just as you did)
4. export TEXMFCNF=/home/sanjoy/admin/tex/texlive/image/texlive/texmf/web2c

Then I ran the following trip test, which it passed with 100% marks.

I texexec'ed my 54-page textbooklet with those env variables set,
sending the output to 'build-tl.log'.  I also ran texexec using my
current context/pdftex install, sending the output to 'build.log'.
All the program versions turn out to be the same as in TL 2006
(context 2006.12.27, pdftex 1.40.0, metapost 0.993).  The textbooklet
uses metafun, bibtex, indexes, colors, so it's a reasonably thorough
test.

I cleaned up spurious path differences in the log files by running
them through the python script below, then ran diff -U 0 on the
processed log files.

================  fix.py ========================================
#!/usr/bin/python

from sys import stdin,stdout
import re

maxlen = 80
file   = ''

# unwrap long lines
for l in stdin:
    if l == '\n': continue  # remove blank lines
    if len(l) == maxlen:
        file += l[:-1]
    else:
        file += l

# normalize paths
stdout.write(re.sub(r'/usr/(local/|)share/texmf(-texlive|)|/home/sanjoy/admin/tex/texlive/image/texlive/texmf(-dist|)','#ROOT#',file))
=============================================================

The resulting 'diff -U 0' shows only differences in program versions
(e.g. pdftex vs pdftexk), random seeds, format dates but not versions,
web2c versions, or runtimes.  So the live texlive2006 passes this
torture test.  Even the overfull hboxes were identical.

Thomas does, I'm sure.  I don't.

Anyway, we are not going to radically revamp fmtutil a couple weeks
before the release, that's absurd.  I can't even think about it now.  If
someone can send me a patch of a few lines that improves the situation,
I will consider that.  If it's complicated, it'll have to wait.  Sorry.

Hmm, I don't know whether subdirectories in web2c are a good
solution.  Having different files with the same name on a system can
be confusing too.  A few years ago this had been deprecated.  Did
public opinion change?

It's not only an fmtutil issue, I think that kpsewchich should also
provide correct results.  And maybe other tools too.

I also do not see a great advantage because users usually do not get
in touch with format files directly.  It is probably better to call
the files cont-{en,fr,...}-{xetex,aleph,pdftex}.fmt and hide the low
level stuff in texexec.

If many people think that subdirectories in web2c are useful though, I
think that it makes sense to discuss first whether the TDS should be
changed accordingly in order to make sure that all TeX distributions
follow this standard.

What I'm most concerned about is that if different distributions are
using different versions of the tools it becomes more difficult to
maintain them.  Don't underestimate this problem.  Almost everything
can be done if there were much more volunteers, but currently the
situation is very, very bad.

But there is a good reason not to change the TDS: At the moment Taco
is merging the functionality of aleph into pdftex and he plans to add
the functionality of xetex to pdftex too.  As far as format files
are concerned we just need a workaround, not a final solution.  The
issue we are discussing here will not exist any more in about two
years.

Unless there is a significant technical reason for this change, it is
probably better not to introduce subdirs in web2c but use longer names
for format files instead.  Unique names are advantageous too.

As I said before, I don't think that different distributions should
provide customized versions of the tools.  Recently Werner Fink
provided a file "scheme-tetex.tpm" which allows people to derive a
teTeX-like system from TeXLive.  **That** was a step into the right
direction!

  Reinhard

    Within TeXLive, ttf2pk's `configure.ac' should be removed.

I removed it, but how discouraging.  "Sometime" I hope we can get the
necessary configure/make changes into the original distribution.

It's puzzling, because in Makefile.in, it seems to me that -lm should be

Anyway, I hardwired a -lm at the end of LIBS (I hope).  Everything has
it, after all.

This may have been an unintended consequence of the other stuff I had to
do to update dvipng in TL this year (namely load all those local .a's).
I'll have to figure it out before sending the author with a proper fix.

Why is this necessary?  I don't understand.  I hope we don't have to
require users to set a new environment variable to use context.

Isn't this why environment variables exist ?  I seem to recall
that when we debated e-TeX methodology, I argued strongly for
eTeX_Inputs, eTeX_formats and so on, just so that one /could/
have duplicate filenames within a single system without there
being a risk of conflict.  Provided that each executable has
a matching set of logical names / environment variables, one
can have as many files of the same name as one has executables,
with each executable "knowing" where to look for its matching
files ...

I don't claim that it can't be done be done this way.  But I doubt that
it's reasonable.  I don't think that it makes sense to change things
in gwTeX only.  And as far as TeXLive is concerned I think that it's
quite inappropriate to ask for new features *now*.

But I also do not want that TeX distributions diverge.

I also do not see a great benefit.  It will be obsolete in two years
anyway. 

Well, if there would be volunteers....

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <E1H2j3R-0008Qb-F8@approximate.corpus.cam.ac.uk>

Karl,

[I'm trying the texlivetest2006-live-20070103.iso]

pdftex 1.40 handles JBIG2, so I updated its manpage to reflect that
feature.  It also incorporates etex/pdfetex, so I upated the
pdftex/pdfetex/etex manpages to reflect that change.  Also a patch for
the missing .TP in kpsewhich, and a few additions of program versions to
other manpages (e.g. bibtex).

The cont-XX.1 manpages might confuse the user.  They are mostly copies
of the pdftex manpage, but cont-XX is not a program, so it shouldn't go
in section 1.  Maybe they belong in section 5 [file formats], as short
descriptions of how to make and/or use the formats?

I've included a diff of the changes, as well as attached a .tgz with the
changed files.  Not sure whether it's worth pushing those changes
upstream; that is, if anyone is upstream of TL.

Looking through the other manpages, I noticed that the TL tree didn't
have the ConTeXt texmfstart.1 manpage that I'd written, and also the
texexec.1 manpage is the old one (it documents the perl version).  Did
the new ConTeXt manpages not make it in?

Here's the diff (doesn't include the context changes mentioned above).
By the way, is there a mptopdf manpage anywhere?  If not I might make
one.

Thomas will not want to change fmtutil to support engine.
(See the past discussion.)
Format files for ConTeXt shouldn't be made with fmtutil,
they should be made with texexec --make ...

Why?

Well, since ttf2pk is originally part of the FreeType 1 bundle, it
doesn't need at all a check for FreeType 1!  I absolutely don't see
any necessity to `improve' configure.ac -- it correctly checks for
kpathsea.

For TeXLive you need exactly the opposite, this is, testing for
FreeType 1 and automatic inclusion of kpathsea.

I think it's fair to have a separate configure.in for TeXLive.

That's because I had just patched it (see rev.3142)!

Hold on, What about this: It is short and trivial, maybe Thomas can
remark on it. The idea:
- put ALL formats in the engine subdirs
- in the recreate loop do
	at the beginning: mkdir $engine; cd $engine
	at the end: cd ..
- in the install log/fmt/etc stuff
	for i in */*.fmt
  etc
I tested it, all my formats were recreated and found.

we used to have fmt efmt ofmt nfmt etc and it was decided to stick to 
just fmt and use engine subpaths which is quite easy to support with

TEXFORMATS    = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}

so, this variable thing is already there.

Ok, this is not sooooo good, as mf does not search for web2c/mf/
unfortunately. Same with mpost. So those have to go either directly into
web2c or some magic texmf.cnf var must be changed.

this depends on the settings in texmf.cnf:

TEXFORMATS    = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}
MFBASES       = .;$TEXFORMATS
MPMEMS        = .;$TEXFORMATS

They don't set $engine, it does not work, tested it. 

But I fixed the fmtutil ...

New patch putting *.base *.mem into web2c without the engine subpath,
only the logfiles are still installed into the respective engine
subdirs, which is a small disturbance...

Tested and worked with the following engines:
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/mf.base installed.
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/mpost.mem installed.
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/aleph/aleph.fmt installed.

fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/xetex/xelatex.fmt installed.
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/xetex/xetex.fmt installed.


Currently NOT working are those formats:
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/etex/jadetex.fmt installed.
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/etex/pdfjadetex.fmt installed.
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/etex/pdfxmltex.fmt installed.
fmtutil: /var/lib/texmf/web2c/etex/xmltex.fmt installed.

I.e. those formally based on etex, but the engine should be pdfetex I
suppose...

Working on this ...

CRAIL (n. mineral)
Crail is a common kind of rock or gravel found widely across the
British Isles. Each individual stone (due to an as yet undiscovered
gravitational property) is charged with 'negative buoyancy'. This
means that no matter how much crail you remove from the garden, more
of it will rise to the surface. Crail is much employed by the Royal
Navy for making the paperweights and ashtrays used inside submarines.

Fine, but I would like to have this cleared up completely. TL2006  
includes XeTeX, which means that this is the time to get things right.

I am looking at LaTeX and ConTeXt

Situation now:
	fmtutil for latex and pdftex produces pdflatex.fmt
	fmtutil for latex and xetex produces xelatex.fmt
	fmtutil for cont-en and pdftex produces cont-en.fmt
	texexec for cont-en for pdftex produces pdftex/cont-en.fmt
	texexec for cont-en for xetex produces xetex/cont-en.fmt

Basically, we have two conflicting standards. We have a few options:
- Remove ConTeXt from fmtutil and handle it with texexec only, still  
two standards of doing things (name change and subdir change) but  
they are disjunct
- Go for extension. Use different extensions for formats that are  
incompatible. No problem that latex.fmt and pdflatex.fmt have the  
same extension (.fmt is for everything pdftex supports), but then  
xetex could use .xfmt until XeTeX and pdfTeX merge in one engine.
- Go for subdir
- God for name

I think specific names are more robust (get your search paths wrong  
and suddenly you get the wrong foo.fmt, whereas barfoo.fmt is unique.  
The same is true for different extensions.

They do set $engine. It does work. I'm using engine also for
mf and mpost since Olaf introduced it.

See texmfmp.c:
   xputenv("engine", TEXMFENGINENAME);

and texmfmp.h:
#ifdef MF
#define TEXMFPOOLNAME "mf.pool"
#define TEXMFENGINENAME "metafont"
#define DUMP_FILE basefile
#define DUMP_FORMAT kpse_base_format
#define writegf write_out
#define OUT_FILE gffile
#define OUT_BUF gfbuf
#endif /* MF */
#ifdef MP
#define TEXMFPOOLNAME "mp.pool"
#define TEXMFENGINENAME "metapost"
#define DUMP_FILE memfile
#define DUMP_FORMAT kpse_mem_format
#endif /* MP */


Note that "engine" name is not executable name in
the case of mf and mpost.


I think TEXFORMATS etc. should be
TEXFORMATS    = .;$TEXMF/web2c{/$engine,}
if one uses engine.

Best regards,
Akira

Hi all!

New incarnation, thanks to Kakuto-sans remarks mf.base and mpost.mem are
now installed into
	$enginedir
which is set respectively.

What I am not sure is whether the call to mktexupd works, as I had to
call mktexlsr /var/lib/texmf ny hand before I got it working.

Anyway, now all formats are put into engine subdirs, and all the engines
I have are working.

Best wishes

Norbert

I don't think this approach is adequate, as it fails to address the  
behavior of things like

   fmtutil --byfmt fmtname

which will only (re)create the first entry for the given name. It  
also doesn't deal with --enablefmt and --disablefmt.

Attached is a patch which attempts to deal with these. --byfmt will  
rebuild all formats for the given name, and --{en|dis}ablefmt will  
modify all entries that match the format name.

This patch also supports an option --no-engine-subdir, to revert to  
the old behavior (but using $engine subdirs is the default, so that  
"naive" use of fmtutil will do the right thing for users).

In addition, I'd suggest patching texmf.cnf along these lines:

find their formats (which have unique names anyway) even if the

Here is a fix for two things:
- TeXs idea of engine is not the binary, use texengine settings
- --missing needs a kpsewhich call with -engine=$texengine

This patch applies on top of yours!

Thanks for this. Presumably recreate_existing() also needs "-engine= 
$texengine" added to the kpsewhich command; I've done that in my copy  
here. The revised patch against TL, incorporating your fixes, is  
attached for reference.

However, the question that remains is whether this is a change that  
we want to make at this time.

Personally, I'd say yes (once people have tested it!); I think it's  
harmless to "normal" users, while allowing more advanced/complex  
setups to work more easily. I don't agree with Reinhard's statement:

IMO, it's too early to know what the future of the pdftex project is  
going to be, and how soon we might converge on a single engine. And  
in any case, it's entirely possible that around the same time as  
xepdflualephtex <grin> is completed, some new idea will spring up and  
give us another variant engine, which we'll need to support for a few  
years.

The architecture is pretty much there to allow engine-specific  
subdirs, and it seems like a sensible thing to do. If in a few years  
time it proves to be redundant, it still won't be doing any harm.

Hi,

I have just committed a two-line change to texmfmp.c that fixes a
bug in the new 'pipe input' code that would cause pdftex to segfault
whenever pipes were used (#3153).

It was not noticed before because the pdftex beta releases used a
different implementation from the one in TeXLive.

I hope this is still in time. When is (was?) the final freeze planned?

Best,
Taco

Using the 20070104-setuptl.zip archive I get two errors.

1) When choosing "scheme-tetex"  or pushing the respective "info"
   button I get:

can't read "schemefile0": no such variable
can't read "schemefile0": no such variable
    while executing
"source $filetpmcollection"

    (command bound to event)

   Choosing another scheme the installation can be started.
    

2) During _postinstall action_ I get:

could not read "C:\TeXLive2006\dviout\dviout.exe": no such file or directory
could not read "C:\TeXLive2006\dviout\dviout.exe": no such file or directory

    (command bound to event)

   and the installation seems to be caught in an endless loop
   afterwards (status bar still moving). In the respective folder,
   there is only the file _install.par_

Regards,
   Gregor

I think what we need to do now is to decide upon a design for this.  
Because if we don't do it now, we'll have to do it later and we'll  
have a migration with outdated documentation on the web etc. etc..

> But I also do not want that TeX distributions diverge.

TL should set a reasonable standard.

Let me repeat the options to prevent conflicts:
	1. Same names, different subdirs per engine
	2. Different basenames per engine (xelatex.fmt vs pdflatex.fmt, xe- 
cont-en.fmt vs pdf-cont-en.fmt
	3. Different extensions per incompatible engine (cont-en.fmt vs cont- 
enf.xfmt)

Another option is to remove ConTeXT from fmtutil entirely and keep  
two disjunct standards, one for ConTeXT (1) and one for the rest (2).  
I am going to put that in gwTeX for now to prevent the conflict to  
exist at all.

That much is true.

That should read 'some of the functionality of xetex'. I have definately
no plans to incorporate the whole of xetex into pdftex at time point.

For instance, there is supposed to be Omega v2 soon. I completely
agree with Jonathan.

I also hope there will be another build of all binaries before the  
release :) as I have just committed #3154, which fixes an issue where  
xetex was not handling optical sizing correctly with some new Adobe  
fonts. (Recently reported on the xetex mailing list with reference to  
Arno Pro.)

I've seen that it will be subdir. OK. Can someone tell me when SVN  
has been updated?

fmtutil in W32TeX saves formats in engine subdir.
(Therefore, I and Staszek decided not to use it because of
 the consistency with TL.)

My fmtutil.cnf is like
...
# Context formats:
cont-en pdftex cont-usr.tex --etex --8bit cont-en.ini
cont-en aleph cont-usr.tex --etex cont-en.ini
cont-en xetex cont-usr.tex --etex cont-en.ini
...

fmtutil --byfmt cont-en
makes all three cont-en.fmt's:

$TEXMFMAIN/web2c/pdftex/cont-en.fmt
$TEXMFMAIN/web2c/xetex/cont-en.fmt
$TEXMFMAIN/web2c/aleph/cont-en.fmt

while
fmtutil --engine xetex --byfmt cont-en
makes only

$TEXMFMAIN/web2c/xetex/cont-en.fmt

There are only small number of options compared to the script for Unix:

Commands:
 --all                      recreate all format, base, mem files
 --missing                  create all missing format, base, mem files
 --byfmt formatname         (re)create format for `formatname'
                            `base' and `mem' files can also be created
 --byhyphen hyphenfile      (re)create formats that depend on `hyphenfile'
 --showhyphen formatname    print name of hyphenfile for format `formatname'
 --version                  show revision number
 --help                     show this message

Options:
 --cnffile file             set configfile for fmtutil
                            default is `fmtutil.cnf'
 --fmtdir directory         set destination directory for format files
                            `directory' must be an absolute path
                            default is $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/$engine
 --engine texengine         specify the TeX engine (with --byfmt fmtname).
 --log                      save log file(s) in the TEMP directory

Best regards,
Akira

Well I would say let's wait for Karl to speak up. I wouldn't want to
submit anything important that close to a release without his approval.
Nor does Jonathan I suppose.

We've discussed a possible fmtutil patch (and texmf.cnf update), but  
it's not clear to me that a decision has been made at this point.

I'd like to hear what Karl thinks, in particular, as well as any  
others who have opinions. Thomas, are you following this issue, and  
have a view on it?

Another late change: I've committed (#3155) the just-released libpng
1.2.15; this effects pdftex and xetex.

No serious changes, but I prefer to have the last version.

I found this behavior, I hadn't time to deep check what is wrong.
In my opinion there is problem during reading tetex.tpm.
I will have to fix it.

Probably you stated tlpmgui from directory out of texlive structures.
Certainly it's bug :-( Thanks for test!

I will fix these bugs today evening.
Please check ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/ for new *-setup.zip

Me too!

At the same time, one could drop all references to pdfetex (symlink in
bin-dir, pool-files and engine-subdir), or are these still needed?

It looks as if this is based on an older fmtutil (no enable etc) and 
for me it will be impossible to incorporate because my package scripts 
rely on the newer options. As I understand the situation now, 
unix-fmtutil will have subdir support as well.

Of course you must use the new script.
I hope, if you change fmtutil, please rewrite it by perl,
because it is difficult for me and Staszek to translate
sh script in order to use on Windows.

It is friendly to keep the symlink around for external user stuff like 
scripts and makefile's and such. Not a big deal for experts, but there 
are quite a bit of users out there who just use something they do not 
understand and who will be unable to fix if it goes wrong.

And it avoids questions like "Where is pdfelatex?". Users have just
lately been trained to use (pdf)etex, so they can expect it to work.

#3157 provides another small bug-fix in xetex (for \radical when  
using OpenType math fonts). I hope this can make it into the release  
binaries, if possible. (If other programs aren't updated, no  
reconfiguration is needed, and "make world" in the Work directory is  
pretty quick.)

Because we'll hopefully have less engines then.  I expect that next

merged.

aleph is indeed becoming obsolete (bith due to xetex and luatex)

about a merge ... xetex follows a library approach while luatex extends the tex machinery and stays independent of libraries; once we have an extendable tex (luatex), we can look into ways to implement xetex features  by means of callbacks (overloads and such, without adding the burden of libraries by default; just like we can replace kpse with alternative implementations), but two years is probably a bit optimistics. I can even imagine that luatex and xetex each fill their niche but share code that is not a burden for either of them. 

and even then, expect multiple engines to be around; take pdftex: version 1+ will be around and debugged forever, and a stable luatex will become pdftex 2+, alongside luatex as development branch which makes 3 engines already. One reason is that we cannot be sure that pdftex 2 is fully backward compatible so we need a knuthian tex around.

A few other programs had been modified recently too.  Hence I suggest
running the Build script.

#3167 provides new binaries for x86_64-linux.

I have not been active in following any discussions for a few months now.
In todays discussion, I see that several people have remembered that I
am all against having duplicates in texmf trees. We can't really go without
them (e.g. language.dat), but the use of duplicates should only be done
for a very good reason.

kpathsea has a few tricks that allows us to do this to some extend. But,
it all only works if the setup is 100% right and it fails as soon as
something is slightly wrong. A user setting
	TEXFORMATS=/my/special/dir:$TEXMF/web2c//
will mess it up as well as a user who manually puts mpost's file into
texmf/web2c/mpost instead of texmf/web2c/metapost. And, don't forget that
users tend to have "old" trees which they for sure want to reuse with
the next TeX Live.

Having different filenames if much easier to understand for users.

How about changing all tools to generate
	$format-$engine.fmt
(or even $format-progname.fmt)
and patch kpathsea to make it search for
	$format-$progname.fmt $format-$engine.fmt $format.fmt?
(in that order)?

That would fix the "we want to have one format with different engines"
problems.

Please, consider all this as just my personal opinion. I don't want to
give preasure to one solution or another.

Thomas

    At the same time, one could drop all references to pdfetex (symlink in
    bin-dir, pool-files and engine-subdir), or are these still needed?

pdfetex needs to be retained as a binary name, and that works fine.  The
pool file is not needed, now that the binary is "pdftex".

However, Reinhard, something went wrong with your x86_64-linux build or
checking.  There, pdftex is still a symlink and pdfetex is still the
binary.  That should not be the case.

The only other platform not updated to have the pdftex binary is
sparc-solaris, and I know Vladimir is working on that.

And yes, we should have another round of builds before the release, but
last I knew Martin was pondering making another release, and I do not
know the final disposition of that.

I had not been aware that design goals are so different.  I'm not a
programmer and don't know anything about the internals of pdftex.  I
always thought that using the xpdf libraries made things easier.
However, maybe you can tell me more at the next TeX conference.

Yes, but it doesn't hurt because they have different names.  Different
names for the binaries/symlinks are needed, why not have different
names for format files too?

  Reinhard

Having the binaries is fine, but is the documentation already done?
Are all the translations in?

All but Polish (Jerzy is working) and Czech (I have to bug Sojka).  With
the addition of Chinese (checked in today), and (if Frans gets done
soon) Dutch.  Doc changes were tiny this year.  Barring this fmtutil
stuff (see next msg).

Regardless of the merits, I don't like the timing.  There is obviously a
workable scheme in existence (context creates its own fmt's, right?),
because we've released without this purported feature since day one.  So
can someone please explain why it is become so desirable all of a sudden
that we need to push through this nontrivial change to system setup at
the last second?

Another aspect of the timing is documentation.  I very much enjoyed
writing things like "there were no directory or other infrastructure
changes" in the doc.  This would blow that out of the water.  I'd have
to document it (not fun), and then it would have go back to the
translators.  At this point, I don't like it.

However, I should say that the timing is not up to me.  Hans, Klaus, and
Volker are controlling the schedule at this point.  If they think this
change is worth the risk of a late or problematic release, it is their
choice.  Last I heard, the hard deadline was to have everything ready
for the upcoming Dante meeting.

I don't buy "because we're adding xetex we need to do something now".
We've had multiple engines since forever (tex, etex, pdf[e]tex, omega,
aleph, ...).  As far as I know, they are all supported on an equal basis
already.  I see particularly nothing different about xetex in terms of
infrastructure need.

Finally, as for the merits, it is not clear to me what we (let alone the
users) are gaining.  Like te and rk, I fail to understand the problem
with using unique file names instead of subdirs.  That is the natural
way to do things with stupid kpathsea.  Again, to me this seems the
wrong time to even have the debate ...

Curmudgeonly,
karl

Let's put it this way: There is the problem of generation the same
'formats' with different engines. Up to now all the format files are
placed in the same directories, which does not work with different
engines.

If we want to allow the multiple formats for multiple engines approach
than we have two options:
- put formats in web2c/$engine
- rename the formats to $format-$binname as te suggested

Both require non-trivial changes, although the later one with hacking
the kpathsea library seems to me more complicated, while the former can
be done by the patch Jonathan provided.

Of course all the problems you mentioned remain:
- not enough testing
- documentation

It's ok to leave it as it is now for this release, but I would suggest
to work on this area for the next release. It would be better to have
*ONE* tool for format generation, not two (texexec for ConTeXt, fmtutil
for the rest, and for those whishing to do something special nothing).

In fact till now I don't see the problem of duplication of files in the
texmf tree, but this is something different.

Allora, let keep the patch of Jonathan present for the next release!

Best wishes

Norbert

Hi Staszek,
in 

  Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf-4WIN

there is 

  OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment

Maybe it should be:

  OSFONTDIR = /$systemroot/fonts//

Hopefully this is correct, I can't test it myself.

I ask for this because we have vntex in TeXLive and Thanh provided
Vietnamese support for Windows system fonts.  It would be nice if
Windows users don't have to configure it manually.

Regards,
  Reinhard

OK, thanks, will do. I'm in despair with all things to do, missing
documentation and all that mess with somehow unfortunate discussion
concerning fmt. So thanks for your input and Karl's decission...

Well, esr's auto-man stuff is not to be taken too seriously.  Conversion
to Docbook is his pet project.  It's nothing that has ever been
important to us to support.

In any case, I have been updating the other man pages, and will look at
these too.

    Maybe they belong in section 5 [file formats], as short
    descriptions of how to make and/or use the formats?

I don't know where they belong.  They aren't exactly file formats, but
they certainly aren't programs at this point.  Hmm.

    if anyone is upstream of TL.

Not for these programs.

    have the ConTeXt texmfstart.1 manpage that I'd written, and also the
    texexec.1 manpage is the old one (it documents the perl version).  Did
    the new ConTeXt manpages not make it in?

Drat.  I am sure I checked them in.  I will review.  Glad you noticed.

    By the way, is there a mptopdf manpage anywhere?  

Not in the tree, that I can see by searching for mptopdf.man or
mptopdf.1.  Don't know if there is one on the net.
Would be nice to have it.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. I will be offline all day tomorrow.  Have fun.

I must admit that when I answered I did not even had the Windows
problems in mind.  Though it is easy to put a few lines to UNIX shell
scripts, it is more difficult to port these changes to Windows.
Though I personally dislike Windows very much I think TeXLive should
behave similar on ALL systems.  As I said a few days ago, almost
everything can be done if many people contribute, but it seems that
this is not the case.  And it is simply an unfortunate time to ask
for new features.

On the other hand I completely agree with Gerben:

If you want to have things changed, announce it as soon as possible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Staszek,
now we have

OSFONTDIR = %SystemRoot%/fonts//

Does this work?  Sorry again for not being able to test it.  But all
the other variables are UNIX-like, (VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts) and
I suppose that kpathsea translates UNIX stuff to Windows if necessary.

Is it correct to use %var% instead of $var in texmf.cnf?

  Reinhard

Well, I just wanted to try that, but you are so fast :-)
Will revert into $SystemRoot (without / at the beginning)

It is incorrect to use %var% in texmf.cnf.
OSFONTDIR = /$systemroot/fonts// is NG.

The correct one is

OSFONTDIR = $SystemRoot/fonts//

Many thanks.

Akira, it is quite unusual that someone who maintains his own
distribution invests so much time into TeXLive.  Thank you very much
for your help, I don't know where we would be without you.

In te "me too" category, I want to support Thomas here. I have some 
experience in supporting users and I can tell you that stuff like this 
is a major source of trouble for users. This major source is only made 
even more troublesome because for years there will be outdated and 
wrong instructions flowing around on the web.

My personal preference is a change in ConTeXt. For ConTeXt, with its 
separate texexec/texmfstart calling mechanism the engine is a variable 
(but this is not reflected in the name of the formats). For XeTeX and 
PDFTeX, the engine is a start and the macro set (Plain, LaTeX, etc.) is 
a variable leading to variable format names.

The format names used to be different, thanks to the different
extension used by the various engines. This feature was removed
for web2c in favour of $engine, but support for that was never
implemented in the tetex/texlive tools, resulting in suddenly
identical filenames.  Don't go blaming context for that!

I am not blaming ConTeXT and I think I did not participate in the 
earlier discussions though I think I would have sided with Thomas.

Basically, I think the different-names (either basename, or extension) 
is more robust than identical names in different directories. Given 
that we are not getting the different extensions back, how difficult 
would it be to let ConTeXT use a different names strategy comparable to 
the current rest? E.g.

	xtx-cont-en.fmt
	pdf-cont-en.fmt

I'd agree that this is the preferable solution.

While we *could* modify fmtutil, along the lines of the patch I  
showed, I absolutely agree that the cost and risk of doing this so  
close to TL2006 release is a major concern. And it's difficult to  
predict how many complications and support issues may arise "in the  
wild".

Given that:

(a) ConTeXt is the only package where this is an issue
(b) it runs tex engines via scripts that have the opportunity to  
configure the setup appropriately
(c) users are therefore not directly exposed to the exact name of  
the .fmt (or engine) used

I think it would be best for this to be solved by ConTeXt using  
engine-specific .fmt names.

PS: About to send, but just seen Taco's message "Don't go blaming  
context...". True. It's not a question of figuring out who to blame,  
but of looking at the big picture and finding the best way forward  
from where we are. I think, on balance, that a change within ConTeXt  
would provide the best solution at the least overall cost. Then  
fmtutil can maintain the ConTeXt formats alongside others without  
other infrastructure changes.

Another option is to do nothing, and let ConTeXt formats be managed  
entirely separately from the others. However, I think this will tend  
to leave ConTeXt somewhat marginalized in the TeX Live world, which  
would be regrettable. I'd like TeX Live to be much more than just  
LaTeX Live. :)

I am sure Hans still has the emails somewhere. The short rundown:

   1. Extensions modifiers were dropped
   2. Engine support was promised as replacement

1. happened, 2. didnt.

This is not a new situation or discussion, it was exactly the same
last year, except last year it was decided that since there were
near-zero aleph users, and xetex was not yet included, the problem
could be worked around by making context-on-texlive support pdfetex
only.

Context has a very important life cycle (distribution) besides being
included on TeXLive, so I feel confident (but keep in mind that I
am not actually Hans Hagen) in saying that the answer is: This will
not happen in the upstream package.

Many Context users do not reinstall from scratch, but instead update
their system regularly, so there is a pressing need to be backward
compatible with already existing installations. Definately more so
than TeXLive, which is essentially throw-away-and-reinstall-each-year
software.

All of this doesn't matter much, because:

Even if Context was changed, and that would be done right this
instant, it would still be considered too late for TeXLive 2006,
yes? So whatever happens now, would end up being postponed to
TeXLive 2007 anyway.

But by next year, there will be format-specific Lua files inside
ConTeXt, and those will need to be byte-compiled at format generation
time. I consider it very unlikely fmtutil will support that sort
of 'at-the-side processing'.

Therefore, letting the ConTeXt formats be handled by texexec instead
of fmtutil sounds to me like the best option. An extra advantage of
that is that it does not need special attention from the TeXLive
team, because texexec already has a workaround to deal with the lack
of engine support in tetex.

Making ConTeXt behave more and more like LaTeX just so that it is
easier to include in TeXLive, does not truly make TeXLive any less
LaTeX-centric, I think.

indeed

we've spent too much time keeping up with tex live's incompatibility issues (time we'd rather spend on development and manuals and such)

also, the debian package has proved that it can be done for unixes so i consider the problem solved 

a quite acceptable in-between solution is to not generate context formats on tex live, if only because users can do that themselves using texexec and/or ctxtools --update; from posts at the context list i deduce that updating via debian packages also works well, as does updating via gerbens installer; akira also has everything on his website, so it's only tex live that has a problem. 

and, as taco mentioned, it may be an issue for 2007, but then the situation may as well be completely different again  

so let's end the discussion here because it's not gonna get solved

Message-ID: <enoqn8$qc2$1@sea.gmane.org>

I just installed the latest TeXLive test (inst) image on my PowerBook G4 
(running Mac OS X 10.4.8), and ran into a (minor) problem. Namely, 
during the installation I set $HOME/Library/texmf as my home texmf tree 
   (d 4 $HOME/Library/texmf), but after the installation process 
finished I checked texmf.cnf (found by kpsewhich in 
/usr/local/texlive/2007-01-06/texmf/web2c/) and noticed that TEXMFHOME 
was still set as $HOME/texmf.

Hope this helps,

Artemio

P.S. fmtutil.cnf was recently changed to correct the entry for pdfetex. 
However, now the entry for pdftex lists language.def as the pattern 
file, even if as far as I know (at least up till recently) plain pdftex 
doesn't use any pattern file. So shouldn't the entry for pdftex read

pdftex          pdftex  -    -translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdftex.ini

?

Message-ID: <20070106200509.08afa1d0@luna.home>

Hi all,

I tested the first test image during holidays, and now checked if my
observations are still valid for the current test image.  In General,
installation went well with install-tl.sh on Linux (x86), with the old
Windows installer and now with tlpmgui on Linux.  It works, all my test
documents, some quite complex one included, compiled fine, where I only
use LaTeX, though.

Some minor issues still left (others have been fixed meanwhile, the
$HOME duplication e.g.):

1) "experiment LaTeX3 packages" should be named "experimental"
2) When selecting the packages for the collections the last entries
have no associated key (for example GNU TeXinfo cannot be disabled as a
single package)
3) Same place: The associated keys with numbers are missing the "9" it
goes till 8 and then 0.
4) Same place: On my terminals eterm and xterm the selections aren't
displayed as a whole, so only the beginnings of lines are displayed.
So sometimes one must guess what the difference between the two
"Supplementary LaT" is.
5) When installing the package listing has collection-fontsextra after
collection-fontsrecommended but when installing the order is switched.

There is one program that you cannot change to
achieve this, and that is TeX itself.  TeX is
defined to produce foo.fmt when iniTeX is asked
to process and dump foo.tex

I really cannot see why any TeX derivative
performing the same sequence should not also
produce foo.fmt, and the search paths for
that derivative be defined such that the
correct foo.fmt is loaded by TeX or any
derivative thereof.  The logical name /
environment variable mechanism, together
with program-specific sub-directories,
seems to me to accomplish everything necessary,

Of course, like all other contributors to
this thread, I would not want TeX Live 2006
to be delayed just to permit this change.

I would just like to clarify my previous post. If I set TEXMFHOME to 
$HOME/Library/texmf by using install-tl.sh's menus (d 4) then texmf.cnf 
is changed accordingly. However, if prior to running install-tl (sudo -H 
sh install-tl.sh) I set TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME='$HOME/Library/texmf' by

export TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME='$HOME/Library/texmf'

then install-tl.sh's d menu correctly reports $HOME/Library/texmf as the 
value of TEXMFHOME, but texmf.cnf is NOT changed during the installation 
phase, so it ends up with its default value $HOME/texmf.

Hope this helps,

Artemio

  I can't decide whether it was on purpose or not, but you somehow
managed to answer a mail by the wrong Werner in the wrong thread of the
wrong list :-) [should have been the thread ?tetex collection or scheme?
on texlive at tug.org, and not ?Russian font T1? on pdftex at tug.org]. One

Hi,
this patch works for me too.  Many thanks.

Martin, it is probably easier to keep things in sync if you apply the
patch yourself and upload the patched sources to the TeXLive repository.

The patch contains very long lines, 3 of them had been broken by one
of the mail programs involved.  That's not a problem but I'll attach
it again as a gzipped file though.  So you don't have to dig around in
old mails.

Hi,
I tried to invoke tlpmgui from an xterm but it sais:

 +--------------------------------------------+
     Error!   tlpmgui require Xwindow
 +--------------------------------------------+

Don't know how you test whether you are using X11.  The easiest way is
to check whether the DISPLAY variable is set.  This is not 100%
reliable but it should be sufficient.  BTW., I think that the "X Window
system" is better known as "X11" in a UNIX environment and it is
probably better to say "tlpmgui requires X11".  But this is a matter
of taste.  If you ask 1000 people you'll get 1000 different suggestions.

$ file tlpmgui
tlpmgui: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, stripped

Of course, self-contained executables have a few advantages.  But
isn't a Perl script more portable today on UNIX systems? 

Cheers,
  Reinhard

Maybe just delete cont-*.1?  The .fmt files are basically visible just
as an argument to pdfetex, and then only if you stare at texexec's
output with --verbose.  So who needs a man entry for them.

Here are updated manpages.  I added a few more options to the
ctxtools.man and wrote mptopdf.man.

This message appear when tlpmgui cannot draw window, e.g. start in
console mode or in if you are logged as user in X and in xterm you
changed user via su - root (or other user) usually cannot run graphic
application without xhost and set environment variable DISPLAY.

tlpmgui tests creation of window, if failed then appear this message.

I was talking about tools, and scripts/tools could either

Yes. The problem is that we have too many collections and they are not
properly listed and displayed when running install-tl.sh. At that point
collection-tetex is completelly useless. If one want to make some similar
scheme to scheme-tetex, he/she can just copy, rename and modify that.

Hi Thomas,

here is a tiny patch that should allow not only the current single
format

$ texconfig-sys init pdftex

but also multiple formats

$ texconfig-sys init pdftex cont-en

(you have a similar for-loop already at another place in texconfig; this
patch is handy e. g. for debugging pdftex)

Is this acceptable?

Making cont-en (etc) via fmtutil is in the current situation not  
preferred. After all, both the XeTex as the PDFTeX version are called  
cont-en but will not work in the other engine. Hence, if you want to  
work with ConTeXT with  both PDFTeX and XeTeX you need the $engine  
subdir setup.

Basically, I think we should make a disjunct set now, that is have  
the ConTeXt formats be handled by texexec and the rest by fmtutil.  
ConTeXt is part of TL but not the other way around (there are ConTeXt  
distributions without fmtutil etc).

So, I would propose that we remove all cont-xx, mptopdf (already not  
there in most cases) and metafun from fmtutil.cnf and decide that  
these are to be created by texexec and not by fmtutil.

In the future, we might add to fmtutil the ability to handle texexec- 
created formats, properly having ConTeXt as a part of TL and  
supporting ConTeXt format handling. But for TL2006 that is too late.  
However, we can decrease confusion and complexity (e.g. fmtutil  
producing a metafun dump and texexec producing another one in a  
different directory) by removing from fmtutil.cnf anything that is  
handled by texexec and calling texexec for creating those formats  
instead.

built from TL sources. it seems bad that TL does some such hacks.

if you want to include it into TL, they should be present in the
source tree of TL. and why are they distributed only for darwin?

that's a valid point, if Adobe Reader for darwin isn't an X11 app.

I don't understand how this can work, Thomas : let's say
there's some tool that (a) calls INiTeX with parameter
string "plain \dump"; then (b) renames the resulting
format file "tex-plain.fmt".  When the user next invokes
TeX, TeX will expect to find "plain.fmt" in an
element of TeX_formats : but it won't be there,
because it has been renamed using the $engine-$format
convention.

Yes, I would expect that. pdfopen/pdfclose need X11 to function
(or even compile), and they can only control the Adobe PDF Reader,
so they are sort of pointless on darwin.

TeX does not directly open the file, but issues a kpathsea
call for doing this. The kpathsea library knows $progname
and $engine and could implement the described searches.

Tim was having build problems with this, but I think it may be solved  
now (IIRC).

I recently noticed that we have a slightly broken situation here.  
xeplain would be the "eplain" format loaded by the xetex engine, and  
the build process creates the appropriate symlink. However, the  
xeplain.ini file that would be used to create the format isn't  
actually present in TL.

Question: do people think the eplain macros are sufficently widely  
used that it's worthwhile to ship this additional support for using  
them with xetex, or should we simply remove the xeplain symlink and  
leave this as something a user could do if desired? IOW, should I (a)  
add xeplain.ini or (b) remove the xeplain links and fmtutil.cnf entry?

I don't know about these; they don't get created when I do a build,  
but Gerben has them among his binaries. Gerben, can you explain them,  
and should they be included (for all platforms?).

These are add-ons from my distribution. Feel free to remove them, but  
they come with my standard build. I think these are user requests  
from a while back. They are GPL-ed

If you can make it compile and work on OS X (I wasn't at the time I

    I found that collection and scheme concept was unfortunately not
    well used for teTeX. All things defined in collection-tetex.tpm
    should go rather into scheme-tetex.tpm. Should I repair that,

What's the problem with it?  I moved everything from scheme-tetex to (a
new) collection-tetex because I needed it in scheme-mactex too, and one
scheme cannot depend on another (it seemed).  And no, I do not want to
duplicate that giant list of packages, that would be wrong.

    Werner?

I am not sure if Werner Fink is on the list.  In any case, he did the
work of initially creating the set of packages, but we are maintaining
it now.  There's no need for him to be troubled about it in perpetuity.

More later.

Yes, that looks good. One thing, however: never use $@.
The proper way is "$@". Not that it matters here (we don't
have any whitespace in the format names), but just to write
it in the proper way.

Or, just use

    These are add-ons from my distribution. Feel free to remove them, but  

Since you provided them, I saw no reason to remove them.  They are also
available on Windows.  I'm not going to try to add them to the regular
build for all the other platforms at this point.  I don't see that
having them available on some platforms and not others is a problem.

Thanks,

    should I (a) add xeplain.ini or (b) remove the xeplain links and
    fmtutil.cnf entry?

I think (b) -- remove the xeplain links and fmtutil.cnf entry.  Building
formats for Eplain (or Texinfo) seems like a lot of trouble for no
significant gain these days.

    So, I would propose that we remove all cont-xx, 

I didn't think they were there, but I see cont-en was (re?)enabled at
some point.  I have now removed it (r3208).

    mptopdf (already not there in most cases) and metafun from
    fmtutil.cnf 

They were both there.  I have now deleted them too (r3209).

    and decide that these are to be created by texexec and not by fmtutil.

Agreed.

OK, you are the boss. But I see problems when browsing scheme contents
(install-tl.sh or even tlpmgui). For full install we still have all tetex
related collections listed, which is missleading (something strange for 
user: full scheme, but some collections deselected :-), and as all 
collections don't fit within range A-Za-z0-9 to make possible 
(de)selecting.

Hello Christian,

Thanks for testing.

    1) "experiment LaTeX3 packages" should be named "experimental"

Reworded, thanks.

    2) When selecting the packages for the collections the last entries
    have no associated key (for example GNU TeXinfo cannot be disabled as a
    single package)

I know.  This is too painful to fix right now.  Sorry.

    3) Same place: The associated keys with numbers are missing the "9" it
    goes till 8 and then 0.

Fixed now, thanks.

    4) Same place: On my terminals eterm and xterm the selections aren't
    displayed as a whole, so only the beginnings of lines are displayed.

Yeah.  I changed it to output in 2 columns to try to help.

    So sometimes one must guess what the difference between the two
    "Supplementary LaT" is.

Reworded, thanks.

    5) When installing the package listing has collection-fontsextra after
    collection-fontsrecommended but when installing the order is switched.

I couldn't reproduce this one.  Could you try again with the new images
(when they are there) and then tell me exactly which commands you're
giving to the install?

Thanks,
Karl

    However, now the entry for pdftex lists language.def as the pattern
    file, even if as far as I know (at least up till recently) plain
    pdftex doesn't use any pattern file.

(You mean language file, not pattern file, I assume.)

My feeling was that pdftex might as well support Babel, like pdfetex.
Why not?  Especially since now "pdftex" enables the e-tex extensions.
It seemed unlikely to be a compatibility problem in practice, but maybe
I am forgetting something?

Yes, it is strange.  In effect, the tetex scheme+collections is an
"orthogonal" view into TL.  Yes, we could list every single tetex
collection in scheme-tetex and not have the "extra" tetex collection.
Maybe in fact that is better.  Yeah, I'm convincing myself it's
worthwhile to do it that way.  I'll do it.

    collections don't fit within range A-Za-z0-9 to make possible 

I know (didn't I mention this when it happened? Oh well).  The two
solutions I see are:
1) write a new installer (not going to happen now)
2) separate out the doc collections like the language collections.
I'm not too excited about doing that either, but maybe it is necessary.

No, because of our current theory that "tex" should be Knuthian.

But "etex" does (and pretty much always did, I believe).

Then pdftex + plain also does (if etex mode is enabled).

(2) is just putting off the evil day.  I thought 8+3
was bad enough, but a key piece of software that relies
on being able to enumerate all possibilities using only

Message-ID: <008c01c732b4$97661420$0302a8c0@JESS>

    I have submitted a document "titlepages.pdf" (no `source' just 
printable) to CTAN but there is a question about the licence. If an article 
in a magazine is classed as software then titlepages is also software, 
otherwise it is a general document (which happens to have been created using 
LaTeX) showing examples of title pages from books and theses (there is LaTeX 
code showing how I made the illustrations but that can be removed without 
detriment to the intent of the document, just a disservice to potential 
readers).

    I would like to licence it so that it could be put on TeXlive ---  
whether the TeXlive assemblers thinks it should be included is another 
matter, but I don't want it to be excluded because of a licence problem.

    From the "free" licences I have looked at the Open Publication License 
with options A and B  fits my wishes (OPL is at 
http://opencontent.org/openpub). Having also read the CTAN list of free 
licences and TeXlive licence document it looks as though the OPL would be 
acceptable to TeXlive.

    I'm sure that I'm not the only one who is concerned about licences for 
documents as opposed to software licences.

    I would be grateful for any comments and resolution.

Hi Artemio,

    value of TEXMFHOME, but texmf.cnf is NOT changed during the installation

I don't know what is wrong, but you can help me:

tclkit-linux-x86-static.gz and tclkit-linux-x86.gz
unzip and run. After run type in: package require Tk
If will start ok, then will appear empty window. try for both binaries

GUI of installer - tlpmgui is written in Tcl/Tk plus several additional
packages. Scripts are wrapped into executable runtime, more about
it here: http://www.equi4.com/tclkit.html
Install engine - tlpm is written in pure Perl, but tlpm haven't GUI.
I forgot: of course you can use tlpm without tlpmgui.

This works as you described.

All programs except tclkit-linux-x86-static first load the .so files.
All programs look for encoding/iso8859-1.enc in various directories in
the $HOME tree without success.  Apparently this is harmless.

After I typed "package require Tk", tclkit-linux-x86 loads some X11
shared libraries and after that a few other X11 related files, mostly
locale stuff.  Obviously in tclkit-linux-x86-static the X11 libs are
statically linked.

It seems that in tlpmgui the error message appears before the
X11 libraries are loaded.

    http://ms25.ath.cx/strace-tlpmgui-eopen

is the output of

   strace -eopen ./tlpmgui &>strace-tlpmgui-eopen

while

    http://ms25.ath.cx/strace-tlpmgui

is the outfut of

    strace ./tlpmgui &>strace-tlpmgui
 
However, it seems that you don't have to worry about the lines
access("/.../tlpmgui/lib", F_OK) = -1 ENOTDIR (Not a directory)
I get the same messages in tclkit-linux-* too, but it doesn't cause
any harm there.

Stupid enough to expect that tlpmgui/lib is a directory when tlpmgui
is a regular file.  I don't know where this comes from but I think it
can be ignored.  I guess that it's hidden deeply in the system and you
can't prevent it anyway.  There had been a similar problem with bash a
few years ago which seems to be fixed now.

Cool.  It's the first time I see a program which doesn't load all
shared libs at the beginning.  Maybe some huge programs like netscape
or firefox load plugins this way, but I avoided to apply strace on
such huge programs. It seems that it's possible to write a
program which provides a GUI if X11 is available and a dialog like
menu if not.  This is difficult to accomplish in Perl.

Yes, I noticed it already.  That's good because I often use an ssh
client when I'm not at home.

That's a good idea ;-).  AFAIK, TeXlive does not treat documents as
software, but e.g. Debian who provide TeXlive packages in their
distribution do.

Personally, I wouldn't regard the OPL with option A as free - e.g. I
cannot use parts of the text in a "titlepages_and_figures.pdf" that I
might like to write.  Debian would also not accept option B:  For
example it makes it impossible to publish a "The complete Documentation
in Debian etch" book.  I would also prefer to have the LaTeX source
available, even if it's only for analysing how you did it.

Therefore I would prefer any document to be licensed without these
options.  TeXlive, however, probably accepts the documents with these
options, anyway.

Yes, it's a difficult area.  There are also the CC licenses.  However,
they have some minor problems (which are going to be resolved in the next
version which is promised to come soon), at least that is what the
debian-legal people told me.  There's also a multitude of them, they
being translated in lots of languages, with slightly different content
due to problems with translations and differing legal terms in different
languages.

tlpmgui use only one binary package: tile (more about tile: 
http://tktable.sourceforge.net/tile/ ). Try download file tile078.kit 
from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11464
and run: tclkit tile078.kit.
May be tile has problems under your (64bit?) distro?

easy with Tcl/Tk + tclkit ;-) With perl probably too with perlTk library.
I wrap application into executables (for linux and windows), but second 
way is wrap into portable kit (if application is portable). Then you can 
run on several platform same kit via platform specific runtime tclkit.

Furthermore, could you patch Build/source/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in :
-TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c
+TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}

I don't think that this will hurt the rest of TL (LaTeX and so on).

P.S.: Why is it so important not to delay the release ("TL2006" seems to be
      already "TL2007")?

Offhand, I don't know quite where this would be coming from (can you  
point to it in the Makefile?). I'm guessing that it is a side effect  
of using libtool for the link, and libtool is finding the library  
location but then assuming it should be a dylib rather than static lib.

While it's true that the make seems to be broken under these  
circumstances, I'm wondering why you'd want to build in this way. If  
you only have a static libpng installed, why link with that rather  
than use the default configuration which uses a static libpng from  
TL's own sources?

I thought the purpose of the --with-system-* options was to link  
against installed *dynamic* libs, so that the footprint of the  
binaries would be smaller and so they could benefit from updates to  
installed libs without needing to relink. If you link with a static  
lib, you don't get these benefits.

Further, for the purpose of TL binaries, at least, I don't think we  
should be linking against anything in /usr/local/lib anyway.

So, ideas on how to fix this properly would be welcome, but I think  
the simplest approach is for you to stop using --with-system-pnglib,  
at least if you're building binaries intended for TL.

To follow up on this.... I'd say this is definitely libtool-related.  
In Work/texk/xdvipdfmx/src/Makefile, we find

xdvipdfmx$(EXEEXT): $(xdvipdfmx_OBJECTS) $(xdvipdfmx_DEPENDENCIES)
	@rm -f xdvipdfmx$(EXEEXT)
	$(LINK) $(xdvipdfmx_LDFLAGS) $(xdvipdfmx_OBJECTS) $(xdvipdfmx_LDADD)  
$(LIBS)

where the build log shows that the $(LINK)... command expands to

This just mentions -lpng, it doesn't make any assumptions about its  
library type or location (which is as I'd expect for --with-system- 
libpng).

It's libtool, then, which is converting -lpng to /usr/local/lib/ 
libpng12.dylib, which you don't have installed. So either it's a bug  
in libtool, or it's a feature that this scenario is not supported.

Either way, I don't expect to fix it at this point. Just don't use -- 
with-system-pnglib on this setup.

I have patched fmtutil.cnf so it uses mf-nowin instead of mf for the  
metafont format.

BTW, given that we will not see another TL this year (I suspect), why  
not call this one TL2007 and plan TL2008 for January 2008? TL2009 in  
January 2009, etc. That way, you will never move accross a year  
boundary, not even when you lose a few monts because of (un)expected  
delays.

Because I update libpng more frequently than TL does (I've done this  
for security fixes) and a recompile of TeX would immediately pick up  
the new version even if TL does not have it. I would not like to  
burden myself with maintaining the TL tree and the libpng that is in  
there (if only that I fear going into the autoconf jungle).

But I am a redistributor who compiles regularly and redistributes.  
With a static link I keep the stuff up-to-date without bothering  
users with some dependency in /usr/local

Not dynamically, certainly.

I build binaries for the i-Package and these are also used for TL.  
Somewherein 2008 we will see a new TL release. Long before then I  
will have probably built a new bugfixed version of the TeX binaries.

I propose the following change to apacite.tpm - no idea whether this
requires any additional changes and which:

Of course if it's easier in terms of coding, we can keep them in a lang/

Answering  myself: let's stay for this one with TL2006 but skip  
TL2007 and plan TL2008 for January 2008.

just calling it 2006/2007 would be ok; thereis no real reason for a once per year schedule indeed

For me, either 2006 (preferred) or 2007. The names currently enable  
use as in $tlyear > $tlyear in perl scripts etc, and my build  
procedures have files like fmtutil.cnf.$tlyear. So if we keep to the  
strict year naming it would really benefit me.

Good point for naming just 2006/2007, as it reflects the major work done
in 2006 (xetex, pdftex1.40, and more...)
Btw. has anybody noticed that this release is TL nr 10 (just a jubilee!)?
Good occasion to remember all those crazy starters, our friends 
(Sebastian, Thomas, Fabrice, Erik, and some more...).

against this is gerben's point.  personally (after the way we bit
ourselves with latex version numbers) i would recommend not using
release year numbers in software.

and that sebastian's original work was supported by uktug (at a time
when buying a cd writer, for example, was a big deal).  did gutenberg
support fabrice?

(fwiw, uktug had a second scheme to do the same thing for macs, given
that uktug members got/get oztex for free.  the scheme never got off the
ground...)

that number is not the same as on the cover of the dvd set, so you can use 2006 for that and we can talk about it as being tex collection 2006/2007

there has been some sponsoring from user groups over time (eg attending

fabrice got a generous amount of time from his university and xemtex was

Speaking historically, Tex Live 1 (and possibly 2)
preceded UK TUG's purchase of a CD writer for me.
I burnt the master of TL 1 on a machine belonging
to Elsevier Science. Ah, the old days.....

my time (on ctan and so on) is solemnly listed and approved when i write
my reports for staff assessment.  so i guess i'm not stealing anything,

Hmmm, we have in mind the whole distribution on cd/dvd for simple users.
As they see "2006", they can think: "ahh, somehow not a fresh software".
Do you remember Boulhakow's "sturgeon that's second-grade fresh"?

  I don't think so: TeXLive?7 was released in June?2002, so the 10th
TeXLive distribution would have been TeXLive?2005, and this one (whatever
we decide to call it) is the 11th. I guess it's still an anniversary
though, since that would make (approximately) 10 years since TL1, for 11
points define 10 intervals and not 11 (sorry about that, that was the
math teacher in me speaking).

  Anyway, TeXLive X would have been nice. Maybe we can retroactively call
TL'05 "TeXLive X (10.0)" and start calling this release "TeXLive X Lion
(10.1)"? Then we can go on an refer to the next releases by big feline's
name ;-)

  Actually the jubilee would have been last May, I'm reading on
texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/live.html

  Should you decide to include them in the next release (I mean
2007/2008), I think this would be most welcome. I've seen dozens of
people come up with hack in order to do exactly what these two programs
do; it can be very useful for people who still use PostScript output and
neeed EPS graphics.

Felines are taken if I'm informed correctly.

Why not invertebrates? Or lizards? Maybe dinosaurs? Tyrannosaurus Rex

  I thought of reptiles, then I decided we still had to use "lion"
somewhere in the name?;-) But T-Live would do fine, too.

Message-ID: <c8b321820701081030m3d96cb0ag89ea2da829260a7f@mail.gmail.com>

I have tried to install TL2006 (test image 20070108) under Win32 (an
English Win XP SP2).

I did not burn the CD image to a CD but unpacked the image's content
to hard disk ("D:\data\software\texlive\20060108"). Starting
tlpmgui.exe from there starts the installer in install mode. Then I
tried many different configurations (installing to the default
"TLroot" or another one at C:, D:, ..., different collections ...) but
every configuration gives the same behavior: No Perl will be copied
(even when I confirm to install it), no Ghostscript too (ditto), only
dviout has been unpacked correctly. Then installation always ends with
the error "Problem with copying files by tlpm". I am working as a user
which is member of the "Administrators" group.

Maybe the problem is caused by other TeX distros or related programs
already installed under Win32: There is a MiKTeX 2.4 installation, a
Ghostscript and a dviout installation. Cygwin is installed too (with
Perl but without (te)TeX). Furthermore there is a dual installation of
a Linux distribution (Debian Sid) whose partition(s) are readable for
Win32, and which contains two TeXLive installations: a Debian-specific
one (TeXLive 2005 by the standard distro packages) and an additional
generic TeXLive 2006 one (installed in "/opt/texlive").

This message appears if tlpm cannot successfully install files of TeX
Live. Are you copied ALL files from cd image into
D:\data\software\texlive\20060108?

For tests get fresh edition of installer from:
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/20070108-setuptl.zip

After start press F9, take a screenshot and send to me or to list:
tlpmgui at gust.org.pl
In your temp directory you can find several files tlpm*.* - copy
it to other folder. Before accept install GS get files again.

Please enclose your environment variables.

Path to other TeX is there in %Path% environment variable?

IMHO, assigning language.def as language file for pdftex is misleading 
for the user, because this is NOT honored by pdftex at present. In other 
words, the user might (say) customize pdftex's hyphenation with 
texconfig, adding languages, etc., and then be puzzled because the 
rebuilt pdftex format does not take these changes into account. Indeed, 
if you check pdftex.log you will find out that pdftex does NOT load 
language.def at all:

cat pdftex.log

...
hyphenation
(/usr/local/texlive/2007-01-08/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex)) )
Beginning to dump on file pdftex.fmt
...

Again, in my opinion this is confusing, and it would be better (till 
things do change) not to assign the (plain) pdftex format a language 
file at all (of course, this does not preclude the assignment of 
language.def as language file for pdfetex and etex, as is done by the 
present fmtutil.cnf).

Just my 2 cents worth!

Cheers,

Artemio

Message-ID: <200701082301.l08N1MK32364@f7.net>

Hi Peter,

Sorry for overlap with Frank's reply, I wrote it before I saw it ...

    whether the TeXlive assemblers thinks it should be included is another 
    matter, 

I am pretty "inclusive" about such decisions :).  I'm sure I would
include it.

    but I don't want it to be excluded because of a licence problem.

The main thing is that the source is needed.  Is that a problem for you?
It doesn't matter how "pretty" it is.  I often recommend to people to
put their source files in a .zip bundle, which I then include that way
in TL.

    From the "free" licences I have looked at the Open Publication
    License with options A and B fits my wishes (OPL is at

OPL is free if you don't exercise the options in section VI (says
http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#RealOPL), so it would be ok in
that case.  But I don't recommend it, simply because there is nothing
else on CTAN or TL which uses that license.  (Aside: I've suggested it
be removed from the license list dropdown on CTAN, since that highlights
it unnecessarily.)

Given source availability, which for a document should not pose any
particular problem, there is no problem with using the GPL, LPPL, or any
other mostly-used-for-software license.  

The most widely used pure documentation license I know of is the GFDL(*)
(used by wikipedia et al., http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html), but I
don't see a reason to go that route here.  (You'd have to include the
license itself in the document.)

Happy to discuss further if you want.

Best,
Karl

(*) To anyone who might be tempted to reply with a tirade about the
GFDL: yes, I know very well that the GFDL with invariant sections is
considered nonfree by Debian, etc.  Let's not go there, pleeeeease.

Hmm, I don't understand what exactly you want to achive.  There is
only an mf.ini but no mf-nowin.ini in The TeXLive tree.

Do you talk about engines?  Currently I get:

"mf-nowin" is for the scripts doing their work in the background and

I hope that you do not want to change this.

I prefer this too.  Staszek's idea to switch back to version numbers
is fine for me as well.

There are some other constraints: The DVD will be sold by Lehmann's
bookstore.  They hardly can sell a TeXLive-2006 DVD in 2007.  They
also do not want to promote TeXLive during the weeks before Xmas.  On
the first glance this is not our problem.  But Lehmann's bookstore
supports DANTE.  I think that we should honor this.  To have more
money in the project funds is not bad, all TeX users benefit from it.

Exactly this is the point.  But:

	sed -e 's/can think/do think/g'

Development of TeXLive-2005 had been frozen at the beginning of
November 2005 but as far as I remember I received the disks in 2006.
I suppose that this will happen each year.

Staszek, calling it "2006/2007" in order to honor people who worked on
it in 2006 seems to be useless because a "normal" TeX user is not
aware of this relationship.

In my opinion it's best to switch to TL-2007 now.  It's a pity then
that there is no TL-2006.  But I guess that when people receive their
TL-2007 CD/DVD, nobody will miss TL-2006. 

Anyway, Staszek's idea to switch back to version numbers is not bad.
We should at least consider this idea.

  Reinhard

No. I am just fixing an error in fmtutil.cnf. The standard fmtutil.cnf 
called mf (not the script version) for creating the mf format. I have 
changed that to

mf              mf-nowin        -               
-translate-file=cp227.tcx mf.ini

if you don't do that, mf will fail on systems without X11 installed 
(e.g. default Mac OS X). Maybe Jonathan can make an Aqua mf?

    not call this one TL2007 

I propose "2006-07" (Hans and Jerzy concurred already in individual
mail).  The problem with just "2007" is that it will trouble all the
user group members who don't get their "2006" software.  And, as Staszek
pointed out, 98% of the work was done in 2006.

Also, "2006-07", unlike anything with a /, can be used as a directory
name.  (I would change the default install dir and user dir to use it, I
guess.)

Gerben, I agree it's a pain not to just have YYYY, but the above seems
like the clearest identification to me, given the state we're in.

    and plan TL2008 for January 2008? 

The future is a mystery.


As for other methods of naming:

- I don't like version numbers, because in practice, people would very
  often give the wrong number, when it increments by one every year.
  This caused unnecessary confusion.  No other package I can think of
  increments a major version number yearly.

- I don't like code names.  They are meaningless, and one cannot be
  compared to another.  Well, I guess we could come up with code names
  starting with a, b, c, ... (sorry if that was proposed, there were too
  many msgs on this topic).  That might be ok, I guess.  I still rather
  think years are the clearest thing to do, though.

It seems so.  When I run

a window with the title "Fatal error" pops up saying:

I already tried.  Perl pre-compiles programs.  In certain situations

Usergroups promise that members get a CD/DVD each year.  It should be
up-to-date.  Hence a new release is needed each year.  However, how it
is named is a completely differnt thing.

I personally vote for "TeXLive-2007".  It's a step which has to be
done only once and everybody gets a CD/DVD at the beginning of the
year which looks much fresher than what people got in the past.

As I said in another mail, Staszek's idea to revert to version numbers
is not bad and it makes a lot of sense to think about it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    mf              mf-nowin        -               

Ok.  BTW, shouldn't there be an entry in fmtutil.* for mf-nowin, too, in

yes, it will still work, since the base files generates by mf-nowin
are compatible with the ones generated by mf. sorry for the noise.

I assume that nobody cares about TeXLive-2006 when TeXLive-2007 is
available.

Why it is a pain?  A name is just a name.  A name is always
arbitrary.  Let's chose a name which sounds beautiful.

"TeXLive-2006" looks like old crap, "TeXLive-2006-07" looks like a
winter release and people might expect a new release in summer.
I still don't know why switching to TL-2007 is bad.

Sorry, I don't understand.  What is the difference between "2006" and
"10" in this context?

Of course, because no package has <year> in it's version string.  For
a good reason, I guess.

I dislike them too.  If someone needs them I don't see any problems.
TeXLive is DFSG free and anybody can derive his own distribution from
TeXLive.

    Why is the source needed? For the sake or argument, suppose I scanned 
pages from out-of-copyright documents and assembled them into a new document 
together with some scanned hand-written pages. What is the source? Suppose I 
just wrote an email message using plain ASCII, what is the source?

    I realise that most of the stuff on CTAN is `compilable' latex code and 
it can be possible to distinguish between the pre- and post-compliled works, 
hence the LPPL is the best you can get for a license for that, but there are
other things that most would not think of as compilable. Is a list of the 
contents of TeXlive compilable? Is the LPPL itself under the LPPL (and under 
my reading it isn't)? If it isn't, should it be there at all?

    I feel that there should be consideration of how to deal with `plain 
documents' other than the GFDL (like you, I don't want to get into that 
hornet's nest).

    Again, why the requirement for the source? In my particular case I'm 
supplying a PDF file. There is software that lets you pick such a file 
apart. Does it matter how the file was created? What if I had used a WYSIWYG 
commercial product whose native form was PDF to generate it? What is the 
source? Why is the result unacceptable?

Most people know by heart in which year they live (counted from Chrismas
1.0 ;-)), but they tend to forget how many years of TeXlive releases
have passed.

Otherwise, I agree with you and would prefer plain 2007.

Message-ID: <74f506dc0701090158td93d854jeae617ee1311820c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have tl installed using the following configuration:

- mount the texlive live iso image under /mnt/texlive2006

- run /mnt/texlive2006/texlive/install-tl.sh
    - select destination of installation:
        'd<Enter>1<Enter>/opt/texlive2006<Enter>r<Enter>'
    - set up texlive to run from CD/DVD:
        'r<Enter>'

- setup the following directories ('->' stands for a symlink):
  /opt/texlive2006
       |-- bin -> /mnt/texlive/texlive/bin/i386-linux
       |-- texmf-main -> /mnt/texlive/texlive/texmf
       |-- texmf-dist -> /mnt/texlive/texlive/texmf-dist

- set TEXMFCNF=/opt/texlive2006/texmf-config/web2c:/opt/texlive2006/texmf-main/web2c
  with /opt/texlive2006/texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf looks as follows:

,--------
| TEXDIR = /opt/texlive2006
| TEXMFMAIN = $TEXDIR/texmf-main
| TEXMFDIST = $TEXDIR/texmf-dist
| TEXMFLOCAL = $TEXDIR/texmf-local
| TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXDIR/texmf-var
| TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $TEXDIR/texmf-config
`--------

then I run

,--------
| getnonfreefonts-sys -v garamond
`--------

everything seems to be ok, except that the new map file
is not installed (I checked /opt/texlive2006/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg)

Does anyone have a clue what I am missing?

To me "2006-07" is July 2006 (see ISO 8601), so it's even older.
If we go for a hyphen, please let's use 2006-2007.

It should be endash, not hyphen. There is a difference between 2006-07

Subject: [tex-live] filename clash [case] in tex4ht
Message-ID: <54CACB23-63D4-4D94-AC28-05EFDACAA83D@sil.org>

The new version of tex4ht in TeX Live (checked in as rev. 3262)  
contains both

   texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex4ht/Arabicore.4ht
   texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex4ht/arabicore.4ht

The same case difference occurs in the \Hinput{...} line within the  
files; otherwise, they are identical.

Is there a need for these two files to exist, or is it an accident?  
The distinction will be lost on case-insensitive file systems, so it  
would be unwise for anything to depend on it.

In the case of the TeX Live repository, this situation creates  
Subversion checkout difficulties when using a working copy on a case- 
insensitive volume. Therefore, I'd like to delete one of the pair,  
unless this will break something else.

Jonathan, 

I believe the file

    texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex4ht/Arabicore.4ht

can be removed, as it should by now affect only users of old
versions of arabi.

Youssef,

Any comments?

Hi,

I just tested yesterdays image. Everything worked fine so far under
openSuSe 10.2. However, I found some outdated packages

powerdot:  v1.3 is in TeXLive, current is
\ProvidesClass{powerdot}
  [2005/12/10 v1.4 powerdot presentation class (HA,CE)]

It can be found under
http://stuwww.uvt.nl/~hendri/Downloads/Files/powerdot.zip

Unfortunately, on CTAN is only the old version 1.3

The next lines are quoted from my mail last year. Just change TL 2005
beta to TL 2006-07 beta and it is still valid:

Yes, I know this. I wrote to the authors last year to update their
packages on CTAN. But no reaction. So, what should we do? Ignore the bug
reports, see e.g. Debian bug Bug#360612
http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-tetex-maint at lists.debian.org/msg25468.html

or add these files to the TeXLive release.

In addition to seminar.bg2 there exists a seminar.bg3 posted in a
newsgroup
http://groups.google.com/group/fr.comp.text.tex/msg/e1e905508b0de896?output=gplain

seminar.bg2 and seminar.bg3 are widely used. Shouldn't we include these
files to TeXLive even when there are not on CTAN? For simplicity I will
attach both files.

Thanks,
  Torsten

one may reasonably assume that hendri hasn't completed testing v1.4;
he's normally pretty keen on keeping the ctan copy up-to-date.  i've got
to mail him today anyway, so i'll ask.

[snipped]

given that .bg3 was posted in a more-or-less private place, one wonders
how it comes to be "widely used".

anyway, it would be good to know who you wrote to as "authors".
unfortunately, the package is under lppl, and one can't just change it
without the authors' say so.  if you had acted on the fact that the
authors weren't responding, six months ago, we might by now be in a
position to reassign maintainership.

but you didn't, so we're stuck.

i now have mail from hendri.

the powerdot v1.4 on his web site is a development snapshot.  he is keen
that it should not be distributed further until the development is
frozen.

    if you check pdftex.log you will find out that pdftex does NOT load 
    language.def at all:

You're right, thanks.

In the interest of stability, I removed language.def from the pdftex
line in fmtutil.cnf/.in.  As I wrote before, I think "pdftex" could
enable the e-tex extensions, but I also see no overriding need to make
the change now.

Hi Thanh,
what getnonfreefonts does in order to install ugm.map (actually
it's done by getfont2006) is executing:

     updmap-sys --quiet --nomkmap --nohash --enable Map=ugm.map

You can try to do this manually, maybe better without --quiet.
Does this work?  You can remove it with:

     updmap-sys --nomkmap --nohash --disable ugm.map

Cheers,
  Reinhard

I like to think of the average tex user as being a bit more  
sophisticated than the average consumer, maybe he enjoys to relish  
occasionally a bottle of good wine, a Barbaresco di Gaja or a Chateau  
P?trus, and thus knows that the year of the harvest is more important  
than the year when it has been bottled.

The coming TL is certainly vintage 2006 and should be named as such.  
The proposed label 2006-07 or 2006-2007 looks ridiculous and will  
stick out like a sore thumb in the hopefully long list of TL vintages.

running updmap-sys manually works, but getnonfreefonts-sys

  > Just try again.

Hi Thanh,
you are so quiet, maybe I have to explain a bit more.  The bug was not
in getnonfreefonts but in getfont2006.  Hence you cannot fix it
yourself.  All you have to do is to run getnonfreefonts again.  There
is some black magic in getnonfreefonts.  If you run it now it will
behave different and hopefully installs ugm.map.

Actually getnonfreefonts is only a wrapper script.  It downloads and
executes ftp://tug.org/tex/getnonfreefonts/getfont2006 .

It first checks whether the temporary directory TMP|TEMP|TMPDIR and
the installation directory (determined by kpsewhich) exist and are
writable.  You will see this if you run getnonfreefonts --help.

Then it creates a subdirectory in the temp dir and downloads
getfont2006 to it.  getnonfreefonts then executes getfont2006 in this
dir and passes its cmdline args to it.  getfont2006 is now doing the
real work.  It downloads and installs the font packages.  It also
updates updmap.cnf.  However, you can install several fonts at once.
It would take a lot of time to create all the pdftex/dvips/dvipdfm
mapfies for each font, hence it just runs
 
	updmap --nomkmap --nohash --enable Map=...

This is quite fast, but we still have to generate all the
pdftex/dvips/dvipdfm maps.  Only fonts which had not been installed
already or for which updates are available will be installed.  If at
least one font is installed getfont2006's exit status will be 2.

If this is the case, getnonfreefont will execute updmap without any
arguments in order to create the missing map files.  Finally it
removes all temporary files, including getfont2006.

There are a few other things which are probably worthwhile to mention.
It can happen that someone updates his font package on CTAN.  You'll
get an error message then asking you to inform me.  The reason is that
I probably have to update the installation procedure too.  For this
reason getfont2006 contains a list of md5 sums for all the zip files
it supports.

Coming back to the original problem: I recently changed a few things
in getfont2006.  I must admit that I didn't spent much time on it.  At
the moment two things are most important, a) that getfont2006 does not
cause any harm and b) that getnonfreefonts works properly because this
is supposed to be burnt on a CD.

Regarding getfont2006 I mainly checked that things go into the correct
directories.  Recently I renamed argument lists of system calls, but I
somehow missed something so that system() had been called with an
empty argument list.  That's the reason why updmap had never been
executed.  I did not notice it because the fonts had been in
updmap.cnf already here.

There are a few things I plan to do in the space of time between TL
will be frozen and it will be released: Rolf Niepraschk and Karl asked
for inclusion of URW Classico, an Optima clone which is under AFPL.
getnonfreefonts has a new option, --debug.  getfont2006 is aware of it
but doesn't make use of it yet.  The --verbose option should run updmap
without --quiet...  And I also want to provide a Perl version
getnonfreefonts.bat which TL-2005 Windows users can install if they
want do add Utopia and Mathdesign and cannot or do not want to update
TeXLive.  This is not much work and most of it had been done already.

In TL-2005 getnonfreefonts had been a shell script.  The new version
is written in Perl in order to make it available to Windows users.
However, since I cannot test it on Windows I have to be very careful.
This certainly leads to some inconveniences.  If the directories
$TEXMFLOCAL or $TEXMFHOME do not exist already the user has to create
them manually.  If someone is willing to test it on Windows, maybe
getnonfreefonts in next year's TeXLive release will create them
automatically.  UNIX users suffer from it too, there is only one
program for UNIX and Windows, the only difference is that a few lines
had been added to the Windows version so that it pretends to be a
batch file, just because #!/usr/bin env perl doesn't work on Windows.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

Seminar has a separate license statement in sem-read.me which the Debian
folks understood as overwriting the statements in the files:

Message-ID: <74f506dc0701100105i3b047089p423ec190f1937964@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Reinhard,

sorry, I have to give this up, this getnonfreefonts program
is too sophisticated for me to use. I find it easier and
faster to fix the problem manually. It's hard for me to
understand why a relatively simple job requires such a
complex program, but it's purely my problem.

Thanh

actually, no; i was right in my mail.

from sem-read.me:

  IMPORTANT NOTE

  With the agreement of Timothy Van Zandt  (now Timothy.VAN-ZANDT at insead.edu),
  the distributions conditions on seminar are now relaxed to:

   This package may be distributed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
   License, as described in lppl.txt in the base LaTeX distribution.
   Either version 1.0 or, at your option, any later version.

(that was written by sebastian.)
    
  This overrides any conditions listed below.

if you _are_ removing seminar from tl, you ought also to remove the
packages that depend on it, such as prosper.

of course, an ideal situation would be for someone such as denis or
sebastian either to submit the updates or to declare that the package is
up for grabs by someone else.

all very depressing.

Sure, done.
Anyway, I prefer not to distribute these files myself as I think they 
are a part of TeX4ht.
And Eitan did already what is necessary.

I am working on a specific XeTeX support in Arabi. It should be ready 
sooner I hope.

I would like to raise an ethical question here (as opposed to
an ethical objection).  Is the general consensus that it is
right to include a "free" clone of a copyrighted font,
and if so, on what basis ?

Many eminent font designers, including the Grand Wizard of Fonts
(himself the designer/creator  of Optima), have argued that font
cloning is not only unethical but will ultimately result in the
end of skilled typeface design, since if a type designer is unable
to protect his/her work from theft then there remains little or no
incentive to work in the field.

To cite John Hudson, "Herr Zapf left ATypI in disgust over the fact
that  the association was unwilling or unable to do anything to
enforce  respect for the rights of designers among its members.
Monotype  had pirated the design of Palatino to make Book Antiqua,
and the  only response from ATypI seems to have been embarassment
that  Zapf was rude enough to protest in public."

Hi,

is it mandatory that the pdftex format is created without loading

(that's normally the first thing i change after installation; in earlier

I have the impression that "TeX Live 2007" is the preferred name.  Ok.
Barring some reversal of fortune, I will change the doc this last time
and update the default directory name, etc.

We can still label the overall thing "TeX Collection 2006--2007"
(when typeset :) so that people might have a clue that this is related
to 2006.  I hope there is no vehement objection to that.

Didn't we just have this thread?

No, it's not mandatory, as far as I know.  In fact, I just proposed
changing it, and actually did change fmtutil.cnf, but then Artemio
pointed out that changing fmtutil.cnf was insufficient, and pdftex.ini
also has to be changed to load etex.src (I assume).  That seemed one
step too many to me, but heck, at this point, I don't care, it's fine
with me.  Maybe you could do it?

If there are more changes involved than the above, please tell me.

good point. the main question here is, how official is this classico. hermann was at some point associated to urw, but also at some point urw went weird and who knows the real story of what happened after that. 

also, reimplementations of optima as well as palatino is kin dof tricky; urw palladio has been around for ages and hermann know this; for instance the tex gyre project is combining all related palladios into pagella but leaves the shapes as they are 

recently hermann upgraded (redesigned) the optima and palatino (both have a suffix nova) and we shpould not fall into the trap of supporting clones of that 

an option is to ask hermann's opinion (volker has fast access to him and/or otherwise i can write him about it); best play safe and not include classico in tex live then

AFAIK URW Classico is actually the result of a cooperation between HZ
and URW. Same for URW Palladio. So at least here I do not see any
ethical problems.

tree needs to find texk in some other place, you'll have to override by
hand.  No chance to do better now.

    dvicore.c: In function `new_bbox':
    dvicore.c:202: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
    dvicore.c:203: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast

I don't know if these warnings are because kpathsea.h was missing, or a
32/64-bit issue, or if they are a real problem at all, or what.  I'd
say, if you can get a binary, call it good.

Thanks for trying it so quickly.

Yes, but I get the same error message.

Can someone test tlpmgui on an AMD64 machine with another Linux
distribution?  If this works I should probably update my system.  But
it's not a good time to do it now.

You cut out the next phrase:

That is, to make it convenient for users to install it.
Not for inclusion in TL.

yes, i tried it, wanted multiple languages in plain pdftex. But i
learned that it's not enough only to put language.dat into fmtutil.cnf.
Now i have added/committed yet missing pdfbplain.ini, so that the
following is possible:

pdftex pdftex language.dat -translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdfbplain.ini

(without etex) but i won't add this line into fmtutil.cnf, as there
might be objections.

Btw, what does the language.dat entry in fmtutil.cnf do? Seems nothing?
It's only to trigger rebuilding?

I use Slackware 32bit on my AMD64, during weekend I will test SUSE 10 64bit 
with tlpmgui.

In my opinion you should use tclkit for 64bit and compile tile for works in 
mode 64bit.
Or try Tcl/Tk 8.5 alpha 6

I haven't free time today and tomorrow but soon I prepare for you short 
description about building and testing tlpmgui.

Herbert should be able to sort it.

I'm with The Emperor of Tunbridge Wells. It's not
just unethical to clone proper designs, it's silly.
We've got good free fonts already,  why add
to the confusion?

Phil, it seems that the word "clone" caused the confusion.  What I
meant is that the actual fonts had been derived from his design which
he called Optima.  HZ cooperates with many font foundries.  There are
many fonts derived from what he called Palatino.  They are not
identical because HZ "only" supervises the work of the creators.  When
I used the word "clone" I had in mind that the fonts are not identical
but based on the design which he called Optima.  I did not intend to
say "it's stolen and slightly modified" but "it's derived from it but
it is not exactly the same".

After HZ complained that there are so many illegal Palatino derivates
I asked him whether the "Palatino" provided by Bitstream (it's called
ZapfHumanist... there) is the "real" thing.  He told me that he had
been very annoyed that he had not been allowed to call the fonts he
made in cooperation with Bitstream and URW "Palatino" because
"Palatino" was a registered trademark by Linotype and they refused to
allow anybody else to use this name.

I guess that Jacko has some experience :(

Though I only asked him about Bitstream he explicitly mentioned URW.  
Hence I'm very sure that we don't have to worry about URW Palladio.

It will not be shipped with TeXLive because the AFPL does not allow to
charge money for re-distribution.  That's the reason I wrote
getnonfreefonts.  We cannot put particular fonts into TeXLive even if
they are free enough for CTAN.

However, in December I told HZ that Thanh added Vietnamese glyphs to
URW Palladio and he told me he is interested to see the results.  I
asked Thanh to send him samples of the Vietnamese version of Zapf
Chancery too (I suppose that HZ will be very surprised) and Thanh told
me that he will send him samples of all of HZ's fonts he extended to
support Vietnamese.  This includes Classico Vn already.  If HZ
complains, we have to remove Classico Vn from the vntex-nonfree
distribution.  If not, I think that it's ok to allow getnonfreefonts
to install URW Classico.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    the build dies in dvipos

Why aren't I surprised.

    ../../../texk/kpathsea/config.h:66:29: kpathsea/c-auto.h: No such  

I just committed an additional -I.. to get to the builddir
texk/kpathsea.  That seems to be what's missing.

    Looks like one of those -I paths is wrong

The ../../../texk is getting to the srcdir, I believe.

I think only used for --byhyphen hyp or --showhyphen fmt ... .
To use language.dat in plain format, rewrite plain ---> bplain

These come from tangle (or ctangle, in a couple of cases), and are a  
bit annoying. Not a critical issue right now, but it would be nice if  
we could find a way to avoid this. Maybe something to keep in mind  
and review once the current release is out.

Many thanks for the clarification, Reinhard : the
following page, although focussing on Palladio rather
thsn Classico, may nonetheless be of some interest.

Message-ID: <1168504137.11261.4.camel@g5.home>

Hi all,

my apologies for writing this mail at such a late stage, but I was just
wondering: I downloaded yesterday's development tree and compiled the
binaries on powerpc-linux. The build script ran without errors and
compiled all binaries (even xetex which wouldn't compile with the
sources a few weeks back). Would it be possible/interesting to include
these binaries in the release? 

My system is a powermac g5, gentoo linux64 with 32-bit userland, so
these binaries should run on most any linux-ppc system.

I'm not on the texlive list, so please cc to my address. Thank you.

Thomas

The egg is on my face not Karl's.  dvipos's only user is ConTeXt, I
believe, and I urged Karl to include dvipos so that ConTeXt in dvi
mode works with positional graphics.

I gave him the CTAN version with my few fixes (so that it wrote out
dimensions with units), but I didn't think about a configure script or
realize that the include files wouldn't be found.  My Ubuntu (i386)
build found the kpathsea.h on the main system:

  $ dpkg -S kpathsea.h
  libkpathsea-dev: /usr/include/kpathsea/kpathsea.h

Therefore, if dvipos builds without problems, could you try the
following ConTeXt test file on a handy architecture to ensure that I
wasn't smoking dope about needing dvipos (with the patches).  The
tests to try are after the file.

================ file.tex ==========================================
\defineoverlay [foregraphics] [\positionoverlay{foregraphics}]
\setupbackgrounds
  [page]
  [background={foreground,foregraphics}]

\starttext

\hpos{r23}{7} \quad \hpos{r24}{8} 

\startMPpositiongraphic{mypos:line}
  mpprocset := 0;  % context doesn't yet handle the new mpprocsets
  path pa, pb, pab ; numeric na, nb ;
  initialize_box(\MPpos{\MPvar{from}}) ;
  na := nxy ; pa := llxy..lrxy..urxy..ulxy..cycle ;
  initialize_box(\MPpos{\MPvar{to}}) ;
  nb := nxy ; pb := llxy..lrxy..urxy..ulxy..cycle ;
  if na=nb :
    pab := center pa -- center pb ;
    pab := pab cutbefore (pab intersectionpoint pa) ;
    pab := pab cutafter (pab intersectionpoint pb) ;
    pickup pencircle;
    draw pab;
    anchor_box(\MPanchor{\MPvar{from}}) ;
  fi ;
\stopMPpositiongraphic

\startpositionoverlay{foregraphics}
  \setMPpositiongraphic{r23}{mypos:line}{to=r24}
\stoppositionoverlay

The pattern.

\stoptext
============================================================

Try these two tests without dvipos (e.g. "mv `which dvipos`{,.tmp}" if
your shell handles curly braces, and ditto for any other copies that
may get unshadowed):

  $ texexec file.tex 
  // file.pdf (correctly) shows a line between the '7' and the '8'.

and (but remove the many auxilliary files first):

  $ texexec --dvi file.tex
  // file.ps (from file.dvi) doesn't have the line between the '7' and the '8'

Then retry the above (again after removing the auxilliary files) after
restoring dvipos:

  $ texexec --dvi file.tex
  // file.ps should have the line between the '7' and '8'

Many thanks,

more precise ... context always supported positional info in both pdf 
and dvi mode; at some point pdftex provided positional info only in pdf 
mode, now also in dvi mode (which reminds me to look into it), but xetex 
and aleph still need the special + dvipos based alternative (actually, 
dvipos used to be a perl script by taco and was later made into a 
program by Chof; it was always part of the windows web2c binary package).

Umpf, and this perl script doesn't work any more? It would have been
*MUCH* easier to include it ...

BTW, I am definitely interested in this perl script in case it works, as
I need something for the Debian context packages until TeX Live 2006 is
in Debian, and including a binary is *much*more*work*.

Since about June, xetex supports the pdftex-like \pdfsavepos,  
\pdflastxpos and \pdflastypos primitives, so it doesn't require the  
use of specials and an extra dvipos program.

i've made proper configure and makefile for dvipos, and sent it to
karl yesterday, but he didn't apply it yet.

i've attached it to this message. please unpack it in the texk/dvipos
directory and delete the Makefile (since now it will be generated from
Makefile.in).

i've tested that the build works on several platforms already.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701111717570.28671@gaston.deltadore.bzh>

Hello Jonathan,

why did you reintroduce the ConTeXt formats in
Build/source/texk/web2c/fmtutil.in ?
I've understood from the discussion the last days, that the ConTeXt formats
should be generated by "texexec --make" and not by fmtutil.

At the moment I'm preparing a texlive spec file for rpm, and I prefer not
to patch fmtutil.in if it's possible, that means, I would like to avoid
this:

Thanks for adding $engine to texmf.in !

In my admittedly incomplete understanding, support from the engine
(e.g. xetex) is necessary but not sufficient.  pdftex since version
1.40.0 also provides positional information in dvi mode.  Howver,
until the ConTeXt macros in dvi mode (texexec --dvi) uses that
information, ConTeXt needs dvipos.

Hans or Taco can/should correct me if any of the preceding points are
inaccurate.

The problem with this is that if a user, with a fresh TL installation  
and no pre-built formats, tries to run a trivial context job:

    texexec hello.tex

it will fail completely. Unfortunately, texexec isn't smart enough to  
check for format availability and build it if required.

In discussion with Karl over the past couple of days, we decided that  
to avoid this breakage, it was necessary to support context formats  
via fmtutil; moreover, fmtutil is patched so that it installs the  
formats in engine-specific subdirectories.

With the latest patch, the above command will still fail (fixing this  
would require additional work with a greater risk of disruption, and  
probably shouldn't be attempted now), but it will correctly build the  
format files. This means that if the user re-tries the texexec  
command, it will run successfully. Not ideal, but better than nothing.

Context users can still use "texexec --make" to pre-build the formats  
if they wish, of course. Or they can use "fmtutil --byfmt cont-en" or  
"fmtutil --all".

To add one thing: This means one can put different cont-en formats into
fmtutil.cnf for different formats. This works now in TeX Live.

I'll fix that tomorrow. I need to be in the office to do texlive
updates, and I've had the flu this week. The latest texexec removes
all trace of pdfetex, and it even has valid return codes, so the
simplest move is to upgrade the context in texlive from 20061227
to 20070109 (or abouts)

i've now removed the fallbacks and will upload a new zip later; i did scan for instance the path to see what tex was present and there is still pdfetex probably as symlink or so which confuses the machinery; by now everyone should know that pdfetex is gone

AFPL does allow derived works, if they are clearly marked as such.
However, it is a copy-left license just like GPL, ie, any derived work
MUST use the same license as the original work. But then the TeX Gyre
Project ignores this requirement for the GPLed LW35 fonts already.

 From texlinks it seems it does have specific mf knowledge:

   case $src in
     */mf)
       if test $dest = "mf-nowin" && test -f $selfautoloc/mfw; then
         dest="mfw"
         verbose_echo "both mfw and mf-nowin exists, $src linked to  
$dest"
       fi
       ;;
   esac

Reading texlinks more it seems to be intended behaviour and the -- 
silent flag can make it shut up about binaries already there.

this is not the relevant place. this place has knowledge from the
times when we had X11-enabled metafont named "mfw", and then "mf" was
a symlink to either "mfw" or "mf-nowin".

an error happens in a generic place below that:

      if test -f "$src"; then
        case $silent in
          true)
            ;;

            ;;
        esac
      else
        verbose_do ln -s "$dest" "$src"
      fi

i.e. it issues this error because according to fmtutil.cnf it tries to
make "mf" as a symlink to "mf-nowin", but it appears that it's a
regular file.

it's possible to stut up a script, of course. it would hide other
errors then.

Hi Martin,

I added that when I first checked in dvipos, although I never tried it.

    Background: pdftex uses a stripped-down source tree of TL. This now
    only works if it includes texk/dvipos. :-{

Ick!

    And while I'm asking for --without switches:
    --without-mp 

I fear that would require actual work.

    and --without-window would also be nice, as without them

Maybe --without-x11 will have the same effect?  Not sure.

So at this stage I will have to recheck all my scripts to see if they  
are ware that now fmt's are created in a different location and I  
have also to be aware that if this is a upgrade, people may have  
older .fmts in the previous web2c-without-subdir location.

So in fact you fix texexec via fmtutil? I wished you had not.

So, previous fmtutil installs have it in web2c. current texexec has  
ConTeXt it in web2c/pdfetex and the new fmtutil has everything in  
web2c/pdftex.

I guess nobody thought about upgrades, existig stuff etc and  
existing .fmt's. etc.

I currently wish I never, never brought this up.

Hello Hans,

one last wish: just to avoid formats at two places, it would be nice, if
texexec and fmtutil put them in the same texmf-tree (today: texmf-var for
fmtutil and texmf-config for texexec).

Cheers, Peter

It seems, that the logic of texexec is right, it puts the formats into
$TEXFORMATS
But fmtutil-sys puts them into $TEXMFSYSVAR

After running "texexec --make", I have ConTeXt formats in $TEXMFSYSCONFIG
and in $TEXMFSYSVAR and luckily, $TEXMFSYSCONFIG will be searched first, so
there is no real problem

Cheers, Peter

Hi,

I have updated ConTeXt to 20070112 a few moments ago. I am not sure
about the binary updates, so just in case: I have fixed up the
following (#3376):

   Build/source/texk/tetex/context/texmfstart
   Master/bin/win32/texmfstart.exe

I have not touched any of the other scripts in the Master/bin/ tree,
I assumed these are copied from Build by the build script, I hope
that is OK.

Also new: many new map files for tex-gyre (#3377), in

   Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/pdftex/context

I updated some of the ruby script files (#3378) in

   Master/texmf-dist/scripts/context/ruby/{base,graphics,}

And of course there are new macros etc (#3379) in

   Master/texmf-dist/tex/context/{base,interface,patterns}

that should do it.

Best,
Taco

Message-ID: <74f506dc0701121036s23ea7e63naca24a1549ad03ae@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

does anyone have a clue how to find out what went wrong here
(I got this problem after upgrading the TL live iso image):

,--------
| fmtutil --byfmt pdftex
| fmtutil: running `pdftex -ini   -jobname=pdftex -progname=pdftex
-translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdftex.ini' ...
| Error: `pdftex -ini  -jobname=pdftex -progname=pdftex
-translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdftex.ini' failed
`--------

fmtutil-sys does the same. Running the command

`pdftex -ini   -jobname=pdftex -progname=pdftex
-translate-file=cp227.tcx *pdftex.ini'

manually succeed.

TIA,
Thanh

This patch could help:

After that, you can inspect the temporary directory.  It's name is
defined in 

  tmpdir=${TMP-/tmp}/$progname.$$

so it is probably /tmp/fmtutil.<somenumber>

It should have the logs.

Delete it.  (r3392 in repo.)  It's a long story.

As for the general question of "how to find out", bash -vx and adding
echo statements is the best way I know.  I'm sure this is not news to
you, though.

I expect it's because I built these i386-linux binaries on a 2.4-kernel

libstdc++ should be linked statically. Try --with-cxx-runtime-hack (it
works for pdftex, maybe also for otfinfo).

    I have not touched any of the other scripts in the Master/bin/ tree,
    I assumed these are copied from Build by the build script, I hope

Yes.  Thanks.  I will manually update texmfstart (and other scripts) as
needed at the end, for any builds which are already complete.

    Also new: many new map files for tex-gyre (#3377), in

Thanks.

 MS> Fixed (#3394).

please don't do that. it's incorrect. without #3339, xetex was using
system headers for zlib instead of the ones included into TL, which
resulted in errors on systems where there's no zlib development
package and/or mismatch between zlib version used for a build and the
one used to link.

please undo this patch - i'll investigate how to properly fix it.

yes it seems to be ok now. I did a quick test 'ldd *|fgrep found'
in the bin directory.

 VV> please undo this patch - i'll investigate how to properly fix it.

i've figured it out.

first, an explanation of gcc behavior.

if you create two files: "test.h" containing two lines:

=========================
typedef unsigned char Byte;
typedef unsigned char Byte;
=========================

and "test.c" containing one line:

=========================
#include <test.h>
=========================

then "gcc -c test.c" will give an error.  but, if you will move test.h
to a system include directory (/usr/include/test.h), then "gcc -c test.c"
will work.

i.e. gcc allows to use double typedefs in system headers but not in
user headers or user programs.

now, there is a typedef for Byte in libs/zlib/zconf.h, and a typedef
for Byte in libs/teckit/source/Public-headers/TECkit_Common.h

and when compiling XeTeX_ext.c, which happens to include both
"zlib.h" and "TECkit_Common.h" (the latter indirectly via "TECkit_Engine.h"),
GCC issues an error in case we use zlib from the TL tree (which we should
do by default, unless --with-system-zlib configure option is given).

so, an error occurs in GCC because of the above (mis)feature.

and the real fix is to resolve this clash with double-typedefing Byte
in "zlib.h" and "TECkit_Common.h" (e.g. it would be best if teckit
could switch to use some other name for this type).

as a workaround, one could use this patch:

=================================================

Or you do an

#define Byte foo

Just to check context related binaries for win32. We have:

bin/win32/textools.bat
bin/win32/texutil.bat
bin/win32/tmftools.bat
bin/win32/xmltools.bat

I assume that missing cont-en.exe and context.exe are obsolete and I can 
remove them from BinPatterns in bin-context.tpm
We do not have makempy.bat and rlxtools.bat for win32 (Hans, Akira?)

FYI, I got the inst image down to what mkisofs claims is 692mb (through

actually burning it on a CD to be sure it's ok?  (The actual file size
is different, but Seb assured me that didn't matter ...)

In-Reply-To: Your message of "Thu, 11 Jan 2007 14:51:25 GMT."

Message-ID: <E1H5bUX-00012r-00@skye.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk>

I tried my dvipos test file (the 'file.tex') with the new texlive test
(live-20070113) by running 'texexec --dvi file.tex'.  mktexfmt
generated cont-en.fmt formats for xetex and pdftex and put them in
~/.texlive2007/texmf-var/web2c/$engine/.  The texexec failed because
it didn't find the newly generated formats (a known problem), but when
I reran texexec, the formats were found.

Once the formats were there, ConTeXt (2007.01.12 01:02) could run.
But it failed with 

! Undefined control sequence.
\initializenextposition ...dosetpositionpapersize
                                                   {\printpaperwidth }

That is also a problem known to upstream, and 2007.01.12 15:56 fixes
the error.  I have the newer ConTeXt version running outside of TL.
Inside TL, I applied this patch to make a spec-mis.tex in the current
dir, remade the formats, and the texexec ran to completion.  The
patch:

--- a/texmf-dist/tex/context/base/spec-mis.tex	2007-01-12 06:55:42 -0500
+++ b/texmf-dist/tex/context/base/spec-mis.tex	2007-01-12 09:50:45 -0500

After it finished, I had a file.ps correctly showing the
position-graphic line connecting the '7' and the '8'.  So the new
dvipos (20070107) seems to be working and correctly integrated into TL
(at least for i386-linux).  Great!

You are a bit behind, I added 2007.01.12 15:56 to TeXLive already.

i don't even have a clue what cont-en.exe and context.exe are .. at least i never had them here; 

texmfstart.exe is just ruby2exe applied to texmfstart.rb; this is more robust that putting all needed libs into the tree as well since the location of the biinaries is unrelated to the tex tree in most installations; btw, the texmfstart.exe file is in the cont-win zip  

(on windows, when one has ruby installed, due to filename association one  can add scripts/context/ruby to the path and then no stubs are needed but this is no alternative for tex live)

OK, here's an alternative patch to restrict mktexfmt to echoing a  
single filename. This seems like it should avoid other breakage, by  
suppressing the echo altogether for any subsequent files, rather than  
trying to add a pipe operation. Seems to work for me in all cases  
tested so far:

my experience is that a 700 mbye CD comes in at
about 720mb file size. so I'd say you have lots of space

Karl,

Don't worry, I just burnt a 700 MB CD with the latest (2007-01-13) inst 
image without any problems.

Talking about the latest inst image, I just wanted to ask you if the 
"wholesale deletion of extra stuff" that you mention in your post means 
that the TeXLive installation using the inst image is less complete 
(i.e, is missing some packages, etc.) than the one from the live image.

Cheers,


Artemio

This is an extremely minor thing, but I've noticed that 'texconfig conf' 
reports (in the "binaries found by searching $PATH" section) the path to 
pdfetex. Since now pdeftex is based on pdftex, not the other way around, 
perhaps it would be more coherent to alter texconfig to reflect this change.

I was testing the live iso (live-20070113.iso), which didn't have the
benefit of your update to the source repo.  Once I noticed your
commit, I didn't know how to generate an updated live iso.  I'm
guessing that the procedure is not fully automatic as it requires
cross-compiling or people contributing binaries for other
architectures.

Karl,

Several manpages didn't graduate from .man to .1.  In the svn repo, for
example, the mpost.1 manpage is old (and the same version went into the
20070113 live iso):

$ head -1 Master/texmf/doc/man/man1/mpost.1 
.TH MPOST 1 "10 November 2001" "Web2C 7.5.5"

The .man source is more recent:

$ head -1 Build/source/texk/web2c/man/mpost.man
.TH MPOST 1 "7 January 2007" "MetaPost 0.993" "Web2C 7.5.6"

(I'll replace the hardcoded web2c version with "Web2C @VERSION@" when I
next update related manpages.)

The changes to the .man sources were checked in here:

Subject: [tex-live] font map files?
Message-ID: <F9E5DCB9-5645-4C4E-9B1B-49C9F31927EB@sil.org>

I notice that TL includes lots of *.map files under Master/texmf-dist/ 
fonts/map/dvips, but very few (just a context set, basically) under  
Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvipdfm or Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/ 
pdftex. Is this correct? I don't know much about how font maps and  
the various drivers work, but it seems inconsistent, and leads to  
warnings (at least) when running ConTeXt, which wants to activate  
maps for particular fonts on the fly; if one uses the dvipdfm driver,  
for example, it still finds maps from the dvips subtree, and these  
may result in warning messages.

For a simple example, create "hello.tex" containing

   \starttext
   Hello, world!
   \stoptext

and then run

   texexec --backend=dvipdfm hello.tex

Result: the PDF file is created successfully, but the driver reports:

hello.dvi -> hello.pdf
[1
** WARNING ** This .map file looks like a dvips format fotmap file.
** WARNING ** -- Current input buffer is: ec-lmb10 LMRoman10-Demi  
"enclmec ReEncodeFont" <lm-ec.enc <lmb10.pfb
** WARNING ** -- Reading fontmap file stopped at: file="lm-ec.map",  
line=7.
]
3335 bytes written

which may be alarming to users.

(There's also a typo in the warning message: see "fotmap"!)

It is correct for the "one big map file for each driver" approach
supported by updmap. The various subdirectories of TEXMF/fonts/map
contain map files with different syntax. Then updmap uses the files with
dvips syntax for both dvips and pdftex. For dvipdfm a suitable
translation is employed. I don't know enough about ConTeXt to judge
where these problems are comming from.

The map files in Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips can be and are used
by pdftex too, but files in Master/texmf-dist/fonts/map/pdftex cannot
be used by dvips because they usually are for TrueType fonts.

There are much more files in fonts/map/dvips than in fonts/map/pdftex
because not so many TTFs are supported.

Maybe you have to run updmap[-sys] to re-create the map files for the
engines.  It prints a lot of valuable information to the screen.

AFAIK Context uses \pdfmapfile (I really wish that LaTeX will do the
same in the future) and if it doesn't work I suppose that the ls-R
database is not up-to-date.

This is curious.  It should read dvipdfm.map created by updmap
instead of searching the tree.

  Reinhard

pdflatex and pdftex can use \pdfmapfile too.

It can also be instructed to read other map files, by means of
\special information. Context uses that to get at the same end
result as for \pdfmapfile, but the problem is that many font
packages obviously do not ship dvipdfmx-ready map files.

Latin-modern in ConTeXt worked fine with dvipdfmx until it
switched to the map files shipped with the latin modern
because that package (it turns out) is dvips-only.

How updmap is still capable of constructing a valid dvipdfm.map
without there being source files below fonts/map/dvipdfm.map
is not clear to me, but I assume there is another source somewhere.

Best,
Taco

Of course, but unfortunately dvips doesn't support it yet.  This is
required if LaTeX switches to \pdfmapfile.  But I hope that it happens
in the near future because all the updmap and updmap-sys stuff is
quite confusing.

Suppose that you run updmap.  You'll get your personal updmap.cnf.  If
your system administrator installs a new font you can't use it because
the change is not reflected in your personal updmap.cnf.   

What a mess!  It would be nice if every program understands \pdfmapfile
or \special{map: ...} or whatever and we can get rid if
{psfonts,pdftex,dvipdfm}.map.

Regards,
  Reinhard

maybe even use \pdfmapline entries in the individual font-related style
files, as then we get rid of quite some map files.

    Don't worry, I just burnt a 700 MB CD with the latest (2007-01-13) inst 
    image without any problems.

Great, thanks.

    that the TeXLive installation using the inst image is less complete 
    (i.e, is missing some packages, etc.) than the one from the live image.

As Zdenek reported, the packages are identical.  The changes are all
outside of the main texmf hierarchies.  For the record:
- no source dir (it'll have to "offer to be distributed" for three years).
- minimal support dir (just some of the critical Windows packages).
- only architectures are i386-linux, powerpc-darwin, and win32.

This is all implemented in MakeImages.sh.

Best,
karl

    I didn't know how to generate an updated live iso.  

Build/tools/MakeImages.sh remakes the ISO's.

Well, when I build the ISO's, I actually run Build/tools/tlrebuild,
which also updates tpm's, list files, etc.  But this is not always
necessary and/or a good idea.

    I'm guessing that the procedure is not fully automatic

It is fully automatic (and quite simple).  It uses whatever tree it is
invoked out of.

    as it requires cross-compiling or people contributing binaries for
    other architectures.

The above scripts do not compile anything.  It just uses what's there.
Indeed, the Master/bin/* updates happen independently -- either I or
whomever checks them in when they are available.

    Several manpages didn't graduate from .man to .1.  

It does not happen automatically (never bothered to write that script),
so I tend to wait until close to the end to minimize the number of times
it has to be done.  The Texinfo output files also need to be updated.

I'll push these docs out to Master today or tomorrow.

Looks a bit unfortunate indeed. 

Build/source/utils/texi2html/texi2html.pl starts with: 
#! @PERL@

I assume that "#! @PERL@" is replaced later.  But it should be
replaced by

#!/usr/bin/env perl

I suppose that this is quite portable.

Thanks for the report,
  Reinhard

I'm using the following in W32TeX.
Execution time progname of dvipdfmx is dvipdfm.
Note that there is no final comma in {}.

TEXFONTMAPS.dvipdfm = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{agl,dvipdfm,ttf2pk}//
TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{agl,dvips,pdftex,ps2pk,ttf2pk}//

    my experience is that a 700 mbye CD comes in at
    about 720mb file size. 

Mkisofs is reporting extents of 692mb.  Isn't that the relevant thing?
I see the file size is only 694mb, though, and my experience, like
yours, is that there's usually a bigger differential.

    so I'd say you have lots of space free (relatively)

Relatively.

Unless overnight someone comes up with a compelling reason for
me not to, I intend to seed fonts/map/dvipdfm/context/ with a
few dozen extra map files in the morning (all mechanically
derived from their dvips counterparts).

This will fix context's dvipdfmx support quickly, as well as
keep the new files confined within the context package so that
changes can be made easily if the need arises (next year).

Thanks for the reminder.

The situation with lcdf is the same as it was last year, so I don't
think we should change it now.

I seem to recall trying cxx-runtime-hack last year and having
difficulties.  (Plus, it should be moved to texk like every other

Do we still need texmf/fmtutil/ stuff? It seems outdated (eg. use 
pdfetex etc.) and not used at all.

As for win32, we do not have hacked fmtutil, so even we have in texmf.cnf
TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{#engine,}
all formats are still stored in just web2c/

As I stated before, fmtutil.exe in W32TeX saves format
files in engine subdirs. However, there are no commands:

--refresh
--enablefmt formatname
--disablefmt formatname
--listcfg
--catcfg
--edit

and there is no option:
--no-engine-subdir

I think they are not essential on windows.

Added option:
--engine texengine              (specify texengine)

If you allow the above defects, you can use fmtutil.exe in W32TeX.
In W32TeX, the texmf-tree for formats is $TEXMFMAIN.
I think I can change it if you tell me where it should be.

PS: I like
TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c{/$engine,}

Thanks,
Akira

Sure, but my older fmtutil.exe from W32TEX doesn't work with more
new kpathsea dll

Preferably $TEXMFVAR for the current setup for TL. Please note, that
on u*x all formats except cont-en (depending on engine used, and declared
in fmtutil.cnf twice with different engines) are still stored in just 
web2c/ (what a mess!)
One more thing: we have also mktexfmt.exe which makes a format on-the-fly.
I just hope that it can cooperate with your fmtutil.exe.
 
> PS: I like

Sorry, I do not like such suddenly made changes, but OK. Both 
structure and setup become more and more complicated...

Ps. please send me your current fmtutil.exe. Many thanks for your help
and patience.

Commits #3444-#3445 contained a grand total of 122 new map files
for fonts/map/dvipdfm/context/

Because there were so many, I have limited myself to map files that
can actually be used by the current version of context, which means
the files are for (parts of) these packages:
	
	antt
         cbgreek
	cm-super
         fourier
	iwona
	kurier
	lm
	tex-gyre

I've tested the syntax of the files by making dvipdfmx read them in,
so I assume the conversion went ok.

Best, Taco

Well, "confined within the context package" - I'm not sure what this
means.  I haven't investigated, but usually if kpathsea searchs a
directory (fonts/map/dvipdfm/), it will also search subdirectories, no
matter how they are called.

But since the contents of the files are generated from the current
information, I don't see any danger here.

Some scripts use a "perl magic string" instead.  But this has its
drawbacks: It only works when invoked from a shell.  If a program or
non-shell-script invokes the "magic script" directly, it will fail.
Therefore, if /usr/bin/env is portable enough, it is probably better.

I meant to say: they will become part of the "context" package,
instead of being part of each of the separate font packages

Since context is the only package that uses dvipdfmx' runtime
fontmap support it does not actually matter where the files go as
long as they are somewhere below font/map/dvipdfm, but putting the
files in e.g. font/map/dvipdfm/lm would confuse the build system
(though I *do* believe that that is where the files *should* be).

So how to cover all these different locations/systems in a robust way?
Is there a trick e. g. to put env into the 1st line, or make a shell

I am not at all happy with this, but as I am no longer in
the business of making releases, the TL team has to live with
the possible problems.

Example: even tough $TEXMFHOME precedes $TEXMFSYSVAR in $TEXMF, users will
not be able to overrule $TEXMFSYSVAR/web2c/pdftex/pdftex.fmt by their
own file in $TEXMFHOME/web2c/pdftex.fmt (which is tecnically ok, but
that might cause trouble with users which follow old instructions etc.)

I'd have prefered to see the engine subdir for context only. And
I wouldn't even have changed texmf.cnf to make it search for
anything else than $TEXMF/web2c (i.e. no subdirectory). IMHO, all this
subdir stuff could be implemented in texecec (e.g. manipulate the search
paths as necessary).

You probably found the same solution, but for the sake of the
archives, one method is this magic first line:

#!/usr/bin/env awk -f

If a system puts the env binary elsewhere, bad news!  But most maybe
all systems do the right thing.

thanks a lot for the hint, i tried it also, but alas, it doesn't work:

hahe at hahepc1:~/x-tp$ which env
/usr/bin/env

hahe at hahepc1:~/x-tp$ head /usr/local/bin/tpic2pdftex_
#!/usr/bin/env awk -f

(the rest of the file is the AWK program, unquoted)

hahe at hahepc1:~/x-tp$ make
pic -z -t example.pic > example.tpic
tpic2pdftex_ example.tpic > example.tex
/usr/bin/env: awk -f: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden

No idea what i have to learn from this last message. Do you have any?

Instead i did it now like this (from Nelson's book):


#!/bin/sh -
AWK=${AWK:-gawk}
export LANG="C"

AWKPROG='
(here goes the awk code)
'

$AWK "$AWKPROG" "$@"

It means that env took the "-f" option which you want to pass to awk.

Right.  I straced x.sh which is a simple script to total the numbers
on stdin (I use it to unbalance my checkbook):

#!/usr/bin/env awk -f
BEGIN {total=0};
{total += $1}
END {print total}

and it had these lines as it tried to find awk on the path:

...
execve("/usr/bin/awk -f", ["awk -f", "./x.sh"], [/* 36 vars */]) = -1
ENOENT (No such file or directory)

So env stupidly combines the -f with the program name, making argv[0]
= "awk -f", and searches for a binary named "/usr/bin/awk -f" (!)
which will never be found.

Without the -f, i.e. "#! /usr/bin/env awk", it won't work at all
because awk thinks the rest of the file are lines to be processed,
rather than pattern text.  So I think your solution is the only
portable one.

Thanks, that's what I needed to know.  

I ran it to remake the iso's, loop-mounted the live iso and set my
TEXMFCNF and binary paths to use the live tree, and tried the
context+dvipos test file.  It worked fine.

I avoided it since it does an 'svn commit'.

the context solution for dvips is to pass the needed map file to dvips (dvips command line option -k) 

adding a special to dvips which is equivalent to -k seems trivial to me

no, Nelson's :-)

> is the only portable one.

ah, thanks a lot for investigation, so let's be happy that at least perl
does not need a -f :-)

Regards, Hartmut

BTW, i tried a few more, but i didn't get a single application of awk
running together with env, neither in -f nor in '...' mode, if it's in
an executable file. No problem on the command line however. If anybody
has an example... :-)

every package that uses pdftex can, but the question is 'does the 
package use it'; this feature has been around in pdftex for quite a 
while is \pdfmapline for individual map entries (add, remove, overload); 
using this primitive can help you to avoid inclusion mess of old 
documents due to changed or updated fonts as well asl keep your font 
files more organized (esp when you have a truckload of fonts not 
included in tex live)

Of course, but you _need_ to specify an _optional_ argument.
#!/usr/bin/env foo=bar awk -f
works.
#!/usr/bin/env - interpreter
foo=bar - optional argument
awk - program
-f - argument

But does this really need an _optional_ argument?

It was a convincing argument.  I tried

#!/usr/bin/env foo=bar awk -f
BEGIN {total=0}
{total += $1}
END {print total}

It infinite loops (linux i386 + bash 3.1.17).  strace shows how it
fills the time:

$ strace -eprocess /tmp/x.sh
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 36 vars */]) = 0
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 37 vars */]) = 0
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 37 vars */]) = 0
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 37 vars */]) = 0
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 37 vars */]) = 0
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 37 vars */]) = 0
execve("/tmp/x.sh", ["/tmp/x.sh"], [/* 37 vars */]) = 0
...

It keeps re-execing itself instead of trying to run awk.  Or maybe I'm
just being dense.  But I don't see a simple way to do this simple
task.  And even if I find one that works on my system, I'd be highly
skeptical that it would work on any other system.

In Master/texmf-dist/doc/latex/parallel, there is a file "readme".  
There is also a link "README" which points to it. On case-insensitive  
systems, this represents a name clash.

Could we either remove the README link, or (if the uppercase name is  
preferred) rename "readme" as "README" and drop the lowercase version?

Thanks,

    No intel-darwin?

Not in "inst", but of course i386-darwin is in "live".

My rationale was that it's more likely for someone on powerpc-darwin to
have problems using the DVD, and thus want to try the CD, since
powerpc-darwin is older.  There isn't room for both on the CD.

Maybe some operating systems expect that people have a teletype

Like you, I believe it is unused now, but I don't really see an urgent

TPM:Execute.*BuildFormat lines in the tpm's, for one thing.  It seems
harmless to keep it at this late date.

the first unix machines probably had teletypes for output (certainly i
was working on a teletype at that time ... though our machine was
admittedly a mainframe).

so unix got over it ...

i suspect dual case things like that derive from our unwillingness to
*impose* "what's good for them" on authors on the archive.  i'm getting
over that feeling (and am regularly changing things now), and jim nags
anyone who submits something that's not quite right.

Both things I would like to keep AND would like to get updated to the
current status ... I know I may annoy you, but it helps me a lot in
building the Debian packages, as we separate the fmt building calls into
different packages, and only create those which are new.

Hmm, I think I have to check the texmf/fmtutil stuff.

Both are the same (not using // ).
web2c{/$engine,} seems a bit beautiful when expanded:

web2c/{$engine,} ---> web2c/tex, web2c/
web2c{/$engine,} ---> web2c/tex, web2c

True.  Thank you for putting them where you did.

    (though I *do* believe that that is where the files *should* be).

I believe that "it depends".  It doesn't seem useful to again debate the

Subject: [tex-live] texconfig init
Message-ID: <17834.55209.108812.549782@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
when I run "texconfig init" from the command line it creates all
format files but for some reason it also runs updmap.

I never have seen this behavior in teTeX.  

texconfig init executes "fmtutil --all" in order to re-generate all
the fmt, base, and mem files.  Thomas invested a significant amount of
time to provide some information about which files had been created
prroperly and which failed.

In particular, since a lot of output is created, fmtutil remembers
which formats had been created successfully or not and prints a
list at the end.

All this effort is nothing worse if regardless whether fmtutil
successfully created all files, updmap is launched.

There is not even a blank line between the output of fmtutil and
updmap, and updmap is also quite verbose itself.

This is what we currently have in texconfig:

    init)
      case $2 in
        "")
          fmtutil --all || rc=1
          texlinks --multiplatform || rc=1
          updmap || rc=1
          ;;
        *)
          shift 1
          for i in "$@"; do
            fmtutil --byfmt "$i" || rc=1
          done
          ;;
      esac
      ;;

I suggest to remove updmap because you do not see when an error
occurred while running fmtutil and because creating formats and
creating map files are two completely different things.

Either people can run updmap separately or it can be made an
additional option, so that people can say "texconfig updmap".

What bothers me most is that, when an error occurs in fmtutil,
"texconfig init" continues as if nothing had happened.  This is
definitely wrong.  Or are there many people around who always type
"echo $?"  after running a program?

Is there any good reason to run updmap from "texconfig init" at all?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I guess that your typewriter was an ASCII machine which is (per
definition) case sensitive.  I also guess that UNIX required ASCII
machines from the beginning.

ASCII teletype machines had been used only in the computer world.

Everywhere else teletype machines used a 5 bit code.  This code had
been case insensitive.  There had been two commands to switch from
"letters" to "numbers and punctuation marks" and vice versa.  See also:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code

In the late seventies and early eighties these machines had been
available for a low price on the surplus market and many computer
freaks used them because no better output devices had been available
for a reasonable price.

They had a hex keyboard and a hex LED display and the only way to
display text was to send output to a teletype machine.

Anyway, I suppose the reason filenames on Windows are case insensitive
is that it had been derived from VMS, which is quite old.  And
compatibility to MS-DOS seems to be a problem too.

Unless Microsoft is willing to provide a modern OS, I fear that we
have to live with all the mess.

Regards,
  Reinhard

But it actually comes from teTeX (3.0):

    init)
      case $2 in
        "")
          fmtutil --all || rc=1
          texlinks --multiplatform || rc=1
          updmap || rc=1
          ;;

This could be changed. I think that nothing really depends on it.

Are you sure?  OS X has a case-sensitive filesystem by default, I'm not
sure whether you can switch it off or what Mac OS 9 does.

The program env is happy with 'foo=bar awk -f', the value for

No, HFS+ is case-insensitive (but case-preserving). There's a variant  
(HFSX) that has a case-sensitive option available, but I'd guess the  
proportion of users running it is tiny. Likewise, UFS is available  
but rarely used.

but case sensitive systems are an even more pain ... esp since they 
assume that the users are case sensitive (which, if i see what 
many-parties files we have do deal with here many users aren't) ... 
actually space-sensitive is even worse

well, windows can do both: you can have two files with different case present (ls-r and LS-r for instance) but by default it serves its users well by letting them assign case sensitive to files but treat them as caseless; so it's not that bad after all; and in the end, file systems will become like databases and things will become less 'related to personal views on what os did whatever best) ...

Hm, just before posting I created a directory "Kochen" in my wife's
MacBook's home folder, where there is already "kochen", and it didn't
have a problem with that.  But maybe I'm just confused...

Hmm, maybe. Perhaps the drive is formatted with case-sensitive HFSX.  
But more likely, the existing "kochen" is a file that has a  
recognized extension of some kind (.txt, .rtf, .pdf, .doc, whatever)  
which the Finder is hiding. There's an option in the Finder's  
Preferences to "Show all file extensions", and IIRC it's off by default.

You can also use Get Info to look more closely at the file name; see  
what it says in the "Name & Extension" section, and see whether the  
"Hide extension" option is checked for this file.

Or look at the directory listing with ls -l in a Terminal window.

imo, actually, neither of them is a pain *in isolation*.

the pain comes when one attempts to interwork; as in systems such as our
world here, where windows and un*x share the same filer.

at my last job, we had similar fun where we interworked between vms and
unix; the difference was vms was much more inventive about case mapping.

I use TeXLive in OS/2. I can get OS/2 binaries without the texmf tree
and I add the texmf tree from TL. The OS/2 machine has dual boot with
Linux but no DVD drive. Thus I boot Linux, mount the HPFS drive,
symlink it to my Linux home which is exported over NFS and from
another Linux machine copy the texmf tree by cp --recursive. HPFS is
not case sensitive and does not support symlinks, so I do not even
know what happens is I try to copy a symlink. Maybe it will not be
copied or it may create an empty regular file. Thus if it first copies
"readme" and later while copying symlink "README" and empty file is to
be created, the system remembers that the name originally was readme
and README will overwrite it keeping the old name. Maybe -L willl help
if I copy the files like that but if the package comes from .zip or
.tar.gz, the behaviour will be different. I like symlinks and case
sensitive file systems but TeX should stay patform independent.

There is no such thing as "p[l]atform independent", but "lowest common
denominator" at most, where one still has to decide which systems to
include.  Being somewhat encompassing, this would mean 8.3 filenames
for everything.

Emacs at least tries to be 8.3-unique IIRC, and TeX probably still
fits MSDOS better than Emacs does.

If you unzip or untar the package under MSDOS, the file names will be
shorten. If you then have \usepackage{someverylongname}, emTeX will
guess the corect name unless you have two very similar names which
will have the same short variant. But I think there are not so many
MSDOS users nowadays but there are stik OS/2 (eCS) users.

Same here. The problem seems to be that the manage_i18n.pl script  
doesn't know to look in $srcdir for the i18n directory, when building  
in a separate tree rather than in-place.

A workaround for now is to add

   # copy i18n directory to builddir if necessary
   if test x"${builddir}" != x"${srcdir}"; then
     cp -r "${srcdir}/i18n" "${builddir}"
   fi

to the end of utils/texi2html/configure.ac and re-run autoconf in the  
texi2html directory (or simply add this to the end of the configure  
script itself, as a temporary fix).

I haven't committed this to TL as I doubt it's the "right" approach,  
but it works for me. Or at least it builds; beyond that, I know  
nothing.... are there installation/runtime issues? There are a number  
of messages during the build, relating to other things that live in  
the source (rather than build) tree:

   making all in utils/texi2html
   Making all in .
   /usr/bin/perl ../../../utils/texi2html/manage_i18n.pl all
   texi2html.pl not readable
   texi2html.init not readable

   examples/roff.init not readable
   examples/noheaders.init not readable
   cd . && /bin/sh ./config.status texi2html

but these may not be critical(?)

Hi, everyone

Now, I download the texlivetest2007-live-20070113.iso from
http://ftp.tug.org/texlive/Images/test/, but after I install it, I
find that when I run the command texhash, it can't generates the ls-R

Because I use the absolutely same way as I do with the previous versions of
texlives, so I think this is a bug of texlivetest2007-live-20070113.

Can anyone tell me the reason about this thing?

Did you already have a $HOME/texmf/ls-R?

I just installed texlivetest2007-inst-20070115 on Fedora Core 5
linux.  My $HOME/texmf/ls-R was created months ago, and was owned by
root, probably from running "sudo texconfig-sys" with TL2005.

Hi Thomas,
I suppose that you had the menu in mind which provides an option "view
logfile".  In this case it makes sense. 

However, when run from the command line it is more desirable if a
program aborts when it encounters an error.

I suggest to just remove the updmap line.  texlinks is not so verbose
that it hurts.

Karl, what do you think?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Indeed, this solved the problem.

    find that when I run the command texhash, it can't generates the ls-R
    file in the $HOME/texmf directory, I don't know the reason.

Unless your $HOME/texmf is huge (thousands of files), you should simply
remove the ls-R file there.  If you really want to keep it, you can
run  texhash $HOME/texmf  manually.  If you really want a texhash
without arguments to update it, add !!$TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS in
texmf.cnf.

Thanks for the report,
Karl

    as we separate the fmt building calls into different packages, 

I can see that, but it doesn't mean we need the fmtutil/ directory or
the BuildFormat TPM:Execute's.  We should just have an attribute
declaring "this-is-a-format" in the package description for your stuff

Message-ID: <200701160034.l0G0Y7u02648@f7.net>

    Is there any good reason to run updmap from "texconfig init" at all?

As I understand it (from what Thomas just told me), the (or a) purpose
of texconfig init is to regenerate what is in texmf-var, which includes
the updmap-generated files.  So 

    Either people can run updmap separately or it can be made an
    additional option, so that people can say "texconfig updmap".

By the same token, if all you want to do is run fmtutil, then you can
run fmtutil --all or --refresh, instead of texconfig init.

    What bothers me most is that, when an error occurs in fmtutil,
    "texconfig init" continues as if nothing had happened.  

I agree that if fmtutil fails, it would be desirable not to go on and
run texlinks and updmap.  Since I gather from Thomas's reply that he
doesn't feel strongly about this, I went ahead and changed the script.

I guess the verbosity of updmap still obscures the verbosity of fmtutil,
but now only if everything succeeds.  We could also run updmap --quiet,
but then there is a potentially long pause while apparently nothing is
happening, which doesn't seem desirable either.  So maybe this is the
best compromise for now.

In principle yes, but there are several points:
1 one tpm can create several formats like latex (produces latex,
  pdflatex), xetex, context, ...
2 the format lines cannot be deduced from this

So what I do when packaging is that if I find a tpm file declaring a
BuildFormat entry "foobar", I take the format.foobar.cnf file, add it to
the to be activated formats. Then I extract the active (ie uncommented)
formats and call fmtutil-sys --byfmt $foo.

Now, if all the infrastructure above is gone I have the following
problems:
ad 1. how do I know which formats should be build, the tpm names have no
relation to the formats to be build
ad 2. extracting the correct fmtutil.cnf lines

ad 2. could be made by some grep magic in the shipped fmtutil.cnf file,
but this way it would be simpler.

> Not that we should make this change now, of course.

I am open, if we kill it I will find a way around it for Debian, no
problem. But please after 2006/7.

I assume there will be one more round of package updates from CTAN

microtype, which just had a new release that uses the new pdftex 1.40

rev. 3433 and 3508 provide a workaround in web2c/xetexdir/XeTeX_ext.c  
(thanks to Vladimir for the suggestion), so AFAIK the current sources  
should build without this problem.

(XP) box. (Note I normally don't run Win, so consider me a complete
beginner!)

The installation was running smooth, I didn't experience any problems.
What I found is:
- in the default settings pressing the "Standard Collections" is showing
  the window of collections, but base-bin is de-selected. I see that
  it is installed anyway, but it puzzled me (probably nobody else)

- running pdflatex I get thousands of warnings a la:
  pdfTeX warning: pdflatex.exe (file c:/TeXLive2007/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map): ambiguous entry for `ecso1000': font file present but not included, will be treated as font file not present
  See below ...

- another strange warning I got with one of my files is:
  pdfTeX warning: pdflatex.exe: font `cm-super-t1' is not a standard font; I suppose it is available to your PDF viewer then
  and the respective font is missing in Acroread.
  But note that cm-super IS installed!
  Calling updmap by hand fixed this AND the above, but I thought that
  this is done automatically?

- What remains after calling updmap are warnings:
  pdfTeX warning: pdflatex.exe (file c:/TeXLive2007/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map): invalid entry for `gsxu1000': both ps_name and font file missing
  Several of these ... 

- ghostscript is installed, but I cannot find it (am I blind?) Opening a
  ps file here openes the Distiller, and searching by hand does not give
  me anything like gs/ghostview or whatever

- perl is installed, but no traces in the menu

- texexec does not do anything. However I call it, it returns without
  any trace of output etc.

- pdfcrop does not work
  Can't locate File/Spec/Functions.pm in @INC (@INC contains: c:\TeXLive2007\perltl\lib ........


If I find more, I will let you know.

Best wishes

Norbert

Hi,

The only error I understand:

Texexec needs (pre-installed, not on texlive) ruby 1.8

We know that. It is because base-bin is already included in 
collection-basic (not related to win32 setup, as we use the same tpm/lists 
files).

gs is installed only on demand (users can have it already). It is used
for many batch tasks. If you want to view ps files, you need gsview
(not enough free for including to TL, please see the TL documentation).

Which menu?? As before, perl (minimal, but robust) is also installed on 
demand. Open cmd window and try: 'perl --version' from the command line

Hans has already answered. You need Ruby installed, but as installation
kit is ~25mb, it is left for (somehow more advenced) users to install it.

As before, you need Ruby installed. 

Ps. we heartily invite windows users to try TL2007 at this (still test) 
stage.

Are you sure that's the answer to this one? It looks on the surface  
like a Perl module installation issue. But I'm speaking from  
ignorance, just wondering....

perl indeed

also, this message is (afak) related to some mix up in perl installations; often happens when an app installes perl and add the bin path to PATH preceding the 'real' perl installation (which may have set environment vars)

Right. env(1) has nothing to do with the problems mentioned here. The
problem is the *kernel* not splitting the line into several arguments as
you'd like it to. Relying on several arguments to the interpreter in a
shebang line has always been a portability issue, as you can see on:

  http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/

(in particular, have a look at the section labelled "Test results from
various systems")

This is probably why the env trick is popular within the Python
community, but much less popular among Perl people (because a Python
script called foo.py is usually called with 'python foo.py', not with
'python -w foo.py' or similar, whereas options such as -w are commonly
used when invoking Perl scripts).

If this is the case, it is helpful to know how the variables PATH and
PERL5LIB are set.

Two versions are not a problem at all, given that the entries of the
new version are either prepended or appended to PATH *and* PERL5LIB.

There had been a bug in TL2005.  The binary search path had been at
the beginning of PATH and the library search path had been at the end
of PERL5LIB (or vice versa, I don't remember the details).

This cannot work.  Pawel wanted to fix it.  Maybe something went
wrong, though.

The easiest way to find it out is to run "set" on the command line.
It does the same as the UNIX variant and you can redirect it's output
to a file:

   set > environment.txt 

It would be very helpful to know how the variables PATH and PERL5LIB
are set.

Regards,
  Reinhard

In Perl you can replace

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

with

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    $^W=1;

or

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use English;
    $WARNING=1;

It is described in Larry Wall's book.  Maybe many Perl programmers are
not aware of this because it is not always easy to guess a good
keyword to search for in the index.  I must admit that I spent some
time to find it out too.

Regards,
   Reinhard

pdfcrop contains:

First I would search c:\TeXLive2007\perltl for Functions.pm
(File\Spec\Functions.pm) to check the case that TeX Live's perl
isn't too small.

But the world is moving towards UTF-8.  How should this work on a

Apparently, we do not have Functions.pm in perl's lib.
The question "too small" or "too big" is for another debate (not at 
this hot moment, please). Heiko, would you please send me directly
that file (provided that it is OK for perl 5.8 we have).

Ps. sorry for my previous mistake with ruby missing (I'm still in a hurry)

Thanks,

afaik windows is unicode below the surface so the problem is not in the operating system; it's user dicipline which counts; also, in about 10 years file systems have become databases anyway 

btw, os and filesystem is one things .. in this internet time i run onto those %20 escaped named more and more and these are even worse (and for tex systems not that handy either -)

The problem is evidently missing pm. Hopefully there is no more such 
gaps, but there is always such risk while stripping CPAN making custom, 
tiny perl distro .)

Hi.

Is it possible for you to support the linux-ppc architecture in the 
future. After tetex is dead, we who use this platform risk to be without 
a latex distribution.

Thanks. Philip.

FYI - I just touched "translations.pl" in svn (rev. 3535), which  
should solve this issue.

TL2007 will have binaries for powerpc-linux. Does that suffice?

It seems that Norbert installed 'medium scheme' which doesn't have 
cm-super. So running updmap should cure this problem. Norbert, if your
tests do not use cyrillic fonts, please use LM (\usepackage{lmodern})

I continue to update packages more or less daily from CTAN updates (that

User discipline can't change that the lowercase letter for `I' is `i'
in Germany, `?' in Turkey, and the uppercase for `i' is `I' in
Germany, `?' in Turkey.  That is not the only problematic code point,
I guess.

Hi all!

Ok, I did:
- svn sync of texlive, ie getting Functions.pm
- build a new iso with MakeImage
- removed the complete installation of TL2007
- reinstalled TeX Live from the new iso image
- installed latexextra, fontsextra, and some other things

This problem is gone, I didn't have to call updmap.

But, opening a file which uses nothing special but t1/fontenc (so it
should get cm-super fonts) the dvi viewer creates pk files.

No idea whether this is intended.

Still here

Ok, as mentioned, I installed ruby: I downloaded ruby 1.8 (whatever),
started the installer which put everything into c:\ruby.

After a reboot texexec is working. I didn't have any files for checking
at hand.

Strange enough, I can NOT confirm this. I get the same error. I checked 
	ISOIMAGE/archive/bin-perl.zip
and the file is still not included. So something is still missing ...

--------------------------------------

One more thing which I found interesting:
dvi viewer shows the followng warning on one test file:
Unknown special:! /pgfH{/pgfheight exch def 0.75 setlinewidth [] 0
setdash /pgfshade {pgfA} def /pgfdir { dup 0 moveto dup 5 index lineto }
bind def} bind def

--------------------------------------

Ok, that's it for today ...

It is because texmf/lists/ files weren't yet regenerated from tpm files
(they are used as list of files to be packed in .zip)

That is a normal behavior. Dviout can directly display installed
truetype or opentype fonts by using win32 api, but cannot directly
display type1 fonts. Thus dviout relies on mktexpk in the above
case.

I have a XeTeX update ready (moving to release 3.6 of the ICU  
libraries, which fixes an OpenType feature-handling bug reported with  
recent Adobe fonts). But I'm not sure exactly how close we are to  
freezing the DVD contents, and whether there is time for everyone to

opinions on whether I should do this, or hold it until after the

I would say yes.

AFAIS the bin builders are quite quick in their response.

The only thing which would make me nervous is that the new stuff breaks
again compilation on various archs ...

Yes, unfortunately so -- xetex needs some minor extensions to the  
OpenType functionality in ICU. I'm hoping to eventually have the  
necessary enhancements integrated in the main library, of course.

Karl, are you OK with initiating another binary build? You know the  
schedule best, so I'm reluctant to commit significant code right now  
unless you confirm it's OK.....

Hi,

just tried installation from iso via loop device on my debian sarge
linux. It runs ok, everything is there --- _except_ the complete bin
directory, see:

hahe at hahepc1:/usr/local/texlive/2007$ ls
texmf  texmf-dist  texmf-doc  texmf-var

The installation even tells at the end:

Done unpacking.
Fixing permissions in /usr/local/texlive/2007... done.
Setting up directories for automatic font creation... done.
Testing for /usr/local/texlive/2007/bin/x86_64-linux/texconfig....
System updated successfully.
Since /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf already existed,
we have not modified anything in that directory.
Please review your setup.
hahepc1:/cdrom#

So it even looks into the missing bin directory but doesn't give any
warning. What's going wrong?

Also if i mark <B> in the install-tl.sh menu, the bin directory won't be
installed. BTW, it has just worked ok. in the office on a i686 debian
sarge system

If it isn't on the CD, it either should not be installable or fetched
from the network. At least those architectures not on the CD should be
marked somehow.

Thanks, it now builds without error.  I tested a build on r3550 and
all was fine except for many warnings that can or maybe should be
ignored.  Some give me a bit of pause, but they are not worth trying
to fix at this late stage.  Here's an example:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -I. -I../../../texk/xdvik -I.. -I../../../texk/xdvik/.. -W -Wall -Wunused -I../../libs/t1lib -I../../../texk/xdvik/../../libs/t1lib -I../../libs/t1lib/../type1 -I../../../texk/xdvik/../../libs/t1lib/../type1 -DPS_GS  -I../../../texk/xdvik/gui -I../../libs/t1lib/lib/t1lib -I../kpathsea   -g -O2  -c ../../../texk/xdvik/encodings.c -o encodings.o
../../../texk/xdvik/encodings.c: In function ???guess_encoding???:
../../../texk/xdvik/encodings.c:3471: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type

[I haven't looked at the code itself to see whether there is a real
 problem.]

Ok, it was a clash between TL2005 and ActivePerl.  Maybe the latter is
the culprit.

I withdraw the sentence "There had been a bug in TL2005." because I
don't remember the details and the more I think about it, the more I
think that it's more likely that ActivePerl caused the trouble.

  > (? I don't remember such thing at all; 

We talked about it in Bachotek.  AFAIR, we came to the conclusion that
it is sufficient not to select Perl by default in the installer and
that not much more can be done anyway.

  > my cmdline utility do not touch env vars.)

I used the GUI interface which appears when you put the CD into the
drive.  For some reason Perl found it's libraries which is quite
unlikely to happen unless PERL5LIB is set properly.  

I suppose that setting env vars cannot completely be avoided.

Hartmut,
Tomek (Tomasz ?uczak) had written a GUI installer for UNIX which looks
quite similar than the TL2005 installer for Windows.

The latest version only lists platforms for which binaries are
available.

However, it doesn't work on x86_64-linux yet, at least I have problems.

It would be very helpful to know whether it runs on other x86_64-linux
systems.  Can you try it?

The latest release is at:

  ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/TL2007/tlpmgui-x86_64-linux


BTW., there is also Master/setuptl/tlpmgui-i386-linux in the
repository (./setuptl/tlpmgui-i386-linux on the test images).  It
can't hurt if people running a 32 bit Linux system test it as well.

Regards,
  Reinhard

it does list here e. g. bin-pdftex.x86_64-linux, but upon "Info" click
it tells "! Can't find package 'bin-t1utils.x86_64-linux'"

I'm not either.  I haven't heard back from Manfred or Klaus, whom I know
are quite busy this week.  I was kind of thinking as next Monday (Jan 22)
as the day for the final images.  I don't know of any large outstanding
issues.  I doubt all the builders can come through in a couple of days,
even assuming there are no problems.

So, I guess my question is, how important is it for users?  Unless it
will make an important difference, my strong inclination is too wait.

The i386-linux binary doesn't link against that library, so I guess it's
an x86_64'ism.  Reinhard, maybe you could try simply manually running
the link without -lXau and see if it works?

I haven't tried to do it lately, but statically linking all the X
libraries used to be quite problematic, due to various
cross-dependencies, gcclib, etc.  Also seems like a potential (though
minor) security issue.  Not to mention a much larger binary :).

Well, I suppose it's important for users who want access to  
particular OpenType features in certain fonts (depending how the  
fonts are constructed)... for example, in some of Adobe's new "Pro"  
fonts, v0.996 can't access the Oldstyle Numerals feature  
independently of Small Caps, while the update handles this correctly.

In the whole scheme of things, though, it's not that big a deal; the  
limitation in the current implementation has been there from the  
earliest XeTeX releases with OpenType support (2+ years) and only  
just come to anyone's attention in the past month or two, so clearly  
this isn't affecting most users.

So let's leave it for now. I believe what's currently in TL is pretty  
solid, and in any case there will need to be updates from time to  
time for those who want to stay on the bleeding edge between now and  
the next full TL release.

Thanks,

JK

Hmm, I think that most people want to select OSF and SC separately.

I don't know how fast new binaries for all platforms can be provided.
At least, I can provide binaries for x86_64-linux quite fast because
everything I have to do is in bash's history.

It's up to Karl to make a decision.

Someone on this list feared that a new update can lead to further
delays.  But as far as I remember all compilation problems in the past
had been caused by external libraries but not by XeTeX itself.

In my opinion it is worthwhile to include the new release.  It is even
worthwhile if the fix will not be available on some platforms.   

Regards,
  Reinhard

W32 build of XeTeX is not easy for me and I'm busy now.
So I'm glad if you leave it for TL.
(I'll try when I have time the new one in the XeTeX svn.)

Message-ID: <86ejpsptjb.fsf@lola.quinscape.zz>


Hi all,

before the trees get finalized, would it be possible to make sure that
_no_ .cfg files get installed into the tex/latex source tree from
arbitrary packages?

For example, with TeXlive 2005 I get in a normal documentation compilation:

This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5) (format=pdflatex 2006.12.5)  18 JAN 2007 10:14

In short, I get a completely random ltxdoc.cfg.  This ltxdoc.cfg might
at best have a place in texmf/source/* outside of $TEXINPUTS normal
reign (and even there it is a stupid idea since the current system's
idea of papersize and doc format will cease getting picked up), but it
most emphatically does _not_ belong in texmf-dist/tex/latex/* where
everybody will pick it up.

So I'd really want to ask that no *.cfg files get installed into the
searchable tree that don't actually belong to the package in question.
Those should _only_ be kept in the source tree where they'll be
visible for the package in question.

Very good idea.

We have
- ltxdoc.cfg:
./texmf-dist/source/latex/latex-tds/tex/ltxdoc.cfg
./texmf-dist/source/latex/captcont/ltxdoc.cfg
./texmf-dist/doc/latex/subfig/ltxdoc.cfg

None of these should cause any problems, I think.

Subject: [tex-live] texmf.cnf paths for format files
Message-ID: <1B1F77D4-4210-4FD9-84AD-9BA6E0A4DF82@sil.org>

In Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, we currently have entries such as

TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}

which means that .fmt files will be found either in the engine- 
specific subdirectory (where fmtutil now places them by default), or  
in the main web2c directory.

However, one issue that remains is that with this setting, naive use  
of kpsewhich will not find the formats:

$ kpsewhich pdftex.fmt
$

It is necessary to use the --engine option, as in:

$ kpsewhich --engine=pdftex pdftex.fmt
/Users/jonathan/.texlive2007/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdftex.fmt
$

This will confuse and frustrate users. Therefore, I propose that we  
add // to the TEXFORMATS, MFBASES, and MPMEMS variables in texmf.cnf,  
e.g.:

TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//

Then kpsewhich, with no --engine option, will search subdirectories  
and find the expected format files.

The only case where there's potential confusion with this setting is  
when there are multiple files with the same name in different  
subdirectories of web2c; the ConTeXt formats are the only current  
example where this happens. In this case, kpsewhich finds the pdftex- 
based formats by default (at least for me; is this based on ASCII  
ordering?); if invoked with --engine=xetex, it finds the xetex-based  
version. This seems reasonable behavior.

Comments?

In my regular setup (texlive 2005 Debian packages + Norbert's Context
packages), I have it here:

  $ kpsewhich pdftex.fmt
  /var/lib/texmf/web2c/pdftex.fmt

> $ kpsewhich --engine=pdftex pdftex.fmt
> /Users/jonathan/.texlive2007/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdftex.fmt

pdftex doesn't need to go into an engine-specific directory, since the
'pdftex' specifies the engine and there's no danger of duplication.
Only with formats like pdftex/cont-en.fmt vs xetex/cont-en.fmt is
engine subpath needed, as far as I can see.  So you're right that

  kpsewhich cont-en.fmt

won't find the context formats.  On the other hand, few naive users
will be trying the above command.  

> TEXFORMATS = .;$TEXMF/web2c/{$engine,}//

This alternative seems a bit dangerous because it introduces
indeterminism into the searching.  Sure, ASCII ordering will make a
choice, at least if there's an ls-R file (because 'ls' does ascii
ordering).  But without an ls-R file, I'm not sure what order the
filesystem will be searched.  Maybe the kpathsea gurus can say, but
even then it seems unwise for format searching to depend on a
low-level implementation detail like that.

An alternative fix so that 'kpsewhich pdftex.fmt' works is for fmtutil
to place pdftex.fmt in web2c/ directly.  But I'm not sure how easy
that change is to do now in the release process.

Yes, but we are talking about TeX Live 2006/7.

After some discussion fmtutil was patches so that ALL (!!! *all*)
formats go into engine specific directories in TL2007.

First web2c/$engine//, then web2c//

For Jonathan: I would say that this makes sense, I don't fear that
someone will put loads of other stuff into foobar/web2c...

Too late now. We decided to go for all or nothing in engine-dirs.

could be be arranged yet not confuse the naive user.

Ah, I saw the discussion about fmtutil but had assumed, without
checking into it, that the engine formats themselves wouldn't go into
$engine/.  Thanks for the clarification.

Agreed.

this puzzles me since pdftex and xetex should set $engine themselves i.e. they *are* the engines

he was talking about running "kpsewhich", not pdftex or xetex.

"kpsewhich" doesn't assume any engine, unless you explicitly set it in

All occurences are ok, because they are not below TDS:tex/

It contains the addition for XeTeX. Thus I think, it is better
to update TDS:tex/latex/config/graphics.cfg.

BTW xelatex/graphics/graphics.cfg is based on an older
version of graphics.cfg with a minor bug in pdfTeX's mode
detection. And it contains a risky and obsolete part:

| % 2005/10/12 moved this here to avoid shipping modified graphics.sty
| \DeclareOption{xetex}{\def\Gin at driver{xetex.def}}

It adds restrictions on the use of graphics.cfg:
* \DeclareOption must be defined (ok for LaTeX or users of miniltx.tex).
* The package that wants to load graphics.cfg must do this at its
  option declaration part before \ProcessOptions.

It is obsolete, because graphics.sty ist already uptodate,
version 2006/02/20 v1.0o contains:
  \DeclareOption{xetex}{\def\Gin at driver{xetex.def}}

I attach an updated gracphis.cfg.

- texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/graphics/color.cfg:

Same reasoning as for graphics.cfg. I attach an updated color.cfg.

> - geometry.cfg:
> ./texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetexconfig/geometry.cfg

NO, NO, NO:

        %% make geometry.sty believe this is valid
        \@ifundefined{pdfoutput}{
          \newcount\pdfoutput \pdfoutput=1
        }{}

This will fool most packages that try to detect pdfTeX.

- texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetexconfig/crop.cfg

NO again much too dangerous, see geometry.cfg.

ok, not below TDS:tex/

> - hyperref.cfg:

quite necessary, because this sets the default driver dvips
(unless a driver can be detected by hyperref).

BTW hyperref does not know XeTeX:

> ./texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetexconfig/hyperref.cfg

Ok, I have now added XeTeX detection to hyperref to make this file
obsolete and will release hyperref 6.75o (probably this night).

Some are.

* Attached: graphics.cfg, color.cfg
* hyperref: Update this night
* geometry and crop need updating.
* There are lots of more .cfg files.

an error popup for missing tl90gs.dll, but proceeds to use the

In particular, after getting a "cont-en.fmt not found" error, users
are going to be running:

C:\...ttings\WhiteG\Desktop\test\tl2007>kpsewhich cont-en.fmt

because nobody told them they should add the engine:

C:\...ttings\WhiteG\Desktop\test\tl2007>kpsewhich -engine=pdftex cont-en.fmt
f:/TeXLive2007/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/cont-en.fmt

On Win32, engine=unset if you didn't give an explicit value on the command line:

>kpsewhich -debug=1 cont-en.fmt
[...]
kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (./cont-en.fmt) => 0
kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (f:/TeXLive2007/texmf-var/web2c/unset) => 2
kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (f:/TeXLive2007/texmf/web2c/unset) => 2
kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (f:/TeXLive2007/../share/texmf-local/web2c/unset) =>
2
kdebug:kpse_normalize_path (f:/TeXLive2007/texmf-dist/web2c/unset) => 2
[...]

It would be more helpful to have all the cont-en.fmt's listed, but how
should kpathsea
know what engines to try?  I suppose there should be some
configuration sharing between fmtutil and kpathsea so both agree on a
list of engines.

this is what texexec reports after a --make

(btwm a complication for locating files may be that the tree where an 
fmt resides has no lsr file and therefore variable expansion is the only 
way to find a format)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0701181925550.32283@hahepc1.hahe>

Hi,

there is a silly problem here: with the texlive inst 070117 setup i
don't get german hyphenation with pdflatex (and also not with
pdfbplain). The pdflatex format is built so that it tells:

...
(/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehypht.tex
(/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/dehypht.tex
German Traditional Hyphenation Patterns `dehypht' Version 3.2a
<1999/03/03>
(Formerly known under the name `ghyph31' and `ghyphen'.)))
(/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/xu-hyphen/xu-dehyphn.tex
(/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/dehyphn.tex
New German Hyphenation Patterns `dehyphn' Rev.31 <2001-05-07> (WaS)))
...

Also this is used:

hahe at hahepc2:~$ kpsewhich babel.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/babel.sty

Here is a test file with babel:

\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}
\usepackage[german]{babel}
%\usepackage{german}
\textwidth=80mm
\usepackage{blindtext}
\begin{document}
\blindtext
\end{document}

On the server with TL-2005 it runs ok: paragraph alignment, four
hyphenated words. The same file on my machines here and at home with
TL-2007 does not hyphenate at all, three overfull boxes. I wonder what's
going wrong. How to debug this? Hints greatly welcomed.

Regards, Hartmut

somehow there was a

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.dat

with two entries for german:

german           xu-dehypht.tex
german           zerohyph.tex

and i have no idea how the 2nd line got there. After a new TL-2007
install everything was fine. Also language.dat was not recreated in this
directory.

No idea how it came to this line.

The ordering is ASCII by default,  but you get a different order if
you say:

    env LC_ALL=de_DE.ISO-8859-1 ls

However, some programs/scripts might call ls(1) but other programs might
call the readdir(2) system function which AFAIK does not sort files.

But you said it yourself, "This alternative seems a bit dangerous..."

Looks wrong to me. It produces a double "german" entry in language.dat,
blocking german hyphenation. Is this fa Austrian? Maybe one should
remove this language.fa.dat file.

it is Farsi. It is just a typo, it should read

I think we should provide an alias "persian" as well. According to  
many (especially Persian scholars), this is the preferred English  
name of the language, and the use of "farsi" is discouraged.

See, for example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
Academy_of_Persian_Language_and_Literature

So I propose

    me; is this based on ASCII ordering?);

AFAIK it's random (hash table order).  I get xetex first.  (Of course if
$engine is set, that dir will be searched first.)

What troubles me is that kpsewhich --all cont-en.fmt still only returns
one .fmt.  Got broken somewhere along the line.  Plus --all isn't in the
--help string.  Oh well.  Next time.

./texmf-dist/tex/latex/geometry/geometry.cfg is an effectively-empty

We need Jonathan's input on the xetex files.

Ah well, that's still better than getting nothing for the other  
formats. When people really need to dig deeper, they'll have to learn  
about --engine.

Right, and so this isn't a problem when running the actual *tex engines.

Compatibility.
Perhaps I'll reconsider this change in the future, but
currently I don't have the time for this.

I meant that they should by updated by their authors to support XeTeX.
My impression is that people will start playing with XeTeX if there
is an complete installation such as TeX Live provides. Then
the XeTeX .cfg files will cause much trouble by
  \newcount\pdfoutput \pdfoutput=1
This isn't limited to the intended package, but will also fool
other packages as well. I doesn't know XeTeX, but I don't think,
that XeTeX will be too happy, if feeded with pdfTeX primitives.

AFAIK XeTeX implements the pdfTeX "api" for setting page dimensions,
so geometry should be happy.

Message-ID: <c8b321820701190355s318b3f0h856321c0e046c66d@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed a current TH2007 image (20070119) at Win XP SP2 using
tlpm.  Their some bug (or, maybe, features) I find annoying:

1) Perl will be unconditionally installed. At my system Activestate
Perl isinstalled, its bin dir is in %PATH% and %PERL%LIB% is correctly
set. Thus I don _not_ need another Perl installation. I must confess
that I've found the old tlpm behavior--asking whether Perl should
installed--more comfortable.

2) When I later uninstall "collection-perl" by tlpm the "perltl" dir
structure is not removed although no dirs below "perltl" contain any
file (only dirs).

3) After uninstalling TL using tlpm my %PATH% is mutated: All paths
are written in capital letters only (no functional problem but I
consider this as ugly) and all "\"s are turned into "/"s.  In my
opinion the latter is a grave bug.

However the hack isn't limited to geometry, each package loaded after

AR7/Linux doesn't show the problem, but gs 8.50 prints:

The entry for object 7 contains:

This is true in the general case...

Right; \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight are supported, so packages  
that want to set page dimensions (such as geometry.sty and crop.sty)  
can use the same code for xetex as for pdftex.

Packages like this that test the engine and configure their back-end  
accordingly need to be updated to support xetex; in many cases, this  
will just mean checking for the xetex engine (e.g. using ifxetex.sty)  
and activating the same code as for pdftex. I haven't had time to  
pursue this with all the package maintainers, though (and until xetex  
became part of mainstream distributions, the incentive to support it  
in standard packages wasn't so strong, either).

The .cfg files in the xelatex tree were created as a workaround to  
get xetex-unaware packages to use the right (pdftex-like) back-end;  
they're not the proper permanent solution, but they've been in use  
for a while now I'm not aware of any reported problems (yet!).

If we can add a test for xetex, and the appropriate driver setup,  
into standard "global" cfg files for these packages, that would be  
preferable. Then the ones in the xelatex subtree could be removed.

I think this is too complicated.  Packages should just check whether
\pdfpagewidth is defined and set it if it is.

Whether the actual engine is PDFTeX, XeTeX, Aleph or whatever else is
rather irrelevant.

If \pdfoutput=0, \pdfpagewidth is available but has no effect. I think
that packages should rely on ifpdf.sty and test \ifpdf. It should be
set no matter which engine is actually used. Thus if the logic has to
be changed in the future, it will be changed in one place and all
other packages may benefit from it.

Setting it would nevertheless not do any harm.

But TeX Live is a mainstream distribution, isn't it?

Then at least try finding another workaround.
Otherwise there will be lots of bug reports, eg.:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{geometry}
\usepackage{hyperref}% assumes now that pdfTeX is running in PDF mode
\usepackage{ifpdf}% same assumption
\ifpdf
  ...% this would be executed
\else
  ...
\fi

But the best solution is, if the packages can be updated.
Otherwise we can start writing answer robots for the time
after TL2007 is out.

I expect that the number of users of XeTeX will increase,
if TL2007 is released.

I have done so for color.cfg and graphics.cfg and updated
hyperref.

Yes, color.cfg, graphics.cfg, and hyperref.cfg can be removed there.

It does harm:
* Who knows, how future versions of pdfTeX behave? It is reasonable
  to issue a warning or error if \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight
  are used in DVI mode.
* The package thinks the setting of the page dimensions is successful
  without a chance for doing it right or issuing a warning/error at least.

No.  I don't see appropriate prior art for "barf on assignment".  That
is no sensible behavior.  There are a few readonly variables in TeX,
but they have sensible valued when read out.  Reading those variables
out in DVI mode could not deliver useful values.

So there are only two remotely useful behaviors: make the control
sequences undefined, or make them just hold a value that is ignored.

The package does not have a chance for doing it right or issuing a
warning/error itself if TeX decides to barf-on-assignment all by
itself.

I don't know of one, so I'm running this line on the
live-20070114.iso, mounted as /tmp/tl2007/:

  find /tmp/tl2007/ -name '*.pdf' | xargs -L 1 ./checkone.sh

where checkone.sh is

#!/bin/bash
t=`mktemp`
if pdf2ps $1 /dev/null 2>&1 | grep '.' >& $t ; then
  echo "=== error: $1 ===="
  cat $t
else
  echo "=== $1 ==="
fi

Here, pdf2ps uses gs v8.50.  I found that xpdf's pdftops is not half
as pick as pdf2ps.  So far it's done 500 files (of 1600 or so), and
these are the problematic ones:

Most of the errors are:

Hm, shouldn't it usually write papersize \specials in the dvi file,
then, suitable for dvips or dvipdfm, respectively?

That should depend on the outcome of \ifpdf, I'd say.  But whether to
set \pdfpagewidth or not can be decided on its availability alone,
independent of what \ifpdf says.

I don't see a problem if additionally a warning is issued.
In contrary, it shows that something went wrong.

It has the chance, if it is not being fooled. Then it knows
that pdfTeX is not running in PDF mode and is free to use
other methods for setting the page size.

Usually these specials set the papersize for the whole dvi file
with *all* pages. \pdfpagewidth, \pdfpageheight can also set
the papersize for individual pages. I don't know, how XeTeX
behaves.

One can use PostScript specials to change the page dimensions in the
middle of a document (preview.sty does this with its "tightpage"
option).

It might be worth an idea to implement some interface for passing such
changes through.  On the other hand, this sounds like it could require
mucking with \everyshi or similar, and that might not be the nicest
idea.

Another possibility would be if pdfTeX would emit the respective
PostScript specials on its own in DVI mode when doing a \shipout and
\pdfpagewidth/\pdfpageheight have changed.

Are you sure that dvips understands the same \special as dvipdfm and

I just moved perl.exe and perl58.dll to a directory not on the path
("...\win32\bad")
and so far things (context scripts -- if any still use perl -- and
epstopdf, pdfcrop) have been working with AS perl.

LaTeX doesn't provide an interface here, I am hoping for LaTeX 3.

Unhappily we don't have a standard special for this. Not even
the \specials for emitting PostScript follow the same syntax:
$ grep literalps at out hyperref.dtx
[...]
\def\literalps at out#1{\special{ps:SDict begin #1 end}}%
\def\literalps at out#1{\special{pS:#1}}%
[...]
\def\literalps at out#1{\special{ps:#1}}%
\def\literalps at out#1{\special{pdf: #1}}%

And there are DVI drivers that don't understand PostScript.

Yours sincerely

LaTeX provides \paperheight and \paperwidth but they are not used for
actual setting of paper dimensions unless some package does it. As I
heard from a lecture at TUG 2006 meeting in Marakesh, LaTeX3 has
interface for such things but I have not read the documentation yet.

You mean rather tlpmgui (not tlpm command line tool which works
as "engine"), right?

Perl *is* installed only on demand. You will be asked to install it or
not, just click "no" if you have Perl already installed.

Thanks for testing. George, would you please try also tlpmgui on linux?

Indeed, and so I hope that support will now become much better  
organized and integrated.

In practice, this may not be as likely as you'd think:

...except that there's a hyperref.cfg in the xelatex subtree, which  
overrides this and chooses the right back-end for xetex. :)

Yes, this would be "fooled" by the hack... but whether that's a good  
thing or a bad thing depends what use people (users or package  
authors) are making of the conditional. Wherever it seems to make  
sense, given the different processing models, xetex tries to be  
compatible with pdftex (hence the \pdfpage{height|width} parameters,  
for example). So in some cases the best results come from  
"pretending" to packages that it *is* pdftex -- until the packages  
are specifically aware of xetex itself.

Of course.

That's actually what xetex does if the \pdfpage* dimensions are  
specified, as it has to pass this info to the pdf-generating driver  
somehow.

This depends on the driver. Some (dvipdfmx, at least) can change the  
size for each page.

Similarly to pdftex, in that \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight can be  
changed during the job.

To verify this I have started 2 more tries to install TL from scratch
at my Win box.
Well--you are right when I check "Perl" as a collection to install. In
this case I will be asked at the beginning of install process and then
I can deny the Perl installation. But when I *uncheck* the Perl
collection before starting the installation Perl will be *installed*
without any asking. (To be precise: I have checked *all* collections
but "Perl" and non-English documentation.)

As last step I used Multivalent to compress the files (PDF-1.5):
  java -cp Multivalent20060102.jar too.pdf.Compress foobar.pdf
The version before this step is ok, thus Multivalent seems to
be the culprit. However, if Multivalent is used with option -old,
then the files are written in PDF-1.4 and are ok.

As quick fix the files can be replaced by the CTAN versions:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/attachfile2.pdf
  ...

But I will upload fixed versions next days (when I will have a
better bandwidth than the current modem connection).

If no option is given, hyperref first checks for detectable TeX
engines. Since version v6.75o this includes XeTeX.
However \pdfoutput is available and enabled, thus hyperref thinks
pdfTeX is running in PDF mode. I doesn't can imagine that pdfTeX
and XeTeX are running together ;-)
  Then if hyperref knows the driver, \Hy at defauldriver isn't asked
any more.

If the update for geometry and crop fails, then at least
the fooling could be reverted, e.g.:

% geometry.cfg:
\newcommand{\SavedGeometryPdfoutput}{}
\let\SavedGeometryPdfoutput\pdfoutput
\AtEndOfPackage{%
  \let\pdfoutput\SavedGeometryPdfoutput
}
\newcount\pdfoutput
\pdfoutput=1\relax

Don't worry about bug reports.  We'll get many of them anyway because
the version of texmf.cnf for Windows we currently have in the
repository is completely broken.  Deliberately, BTW.

As a check, I just made sure that gs can handle PDF-1.5 compression.
For a test file I downloaded the PDF 1.6 Reference from
<http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/pdf/index_reference.html>
and viewed it with gs.  It was no problem.  So Multivalent seems to be
the culprit, as you say.

I also committed r3598 renaming the .tar.gz.pdf ones to .tar.gz.

    Here are the files that ps2pdf had problems with.  

In general, problems like these need to be reported to the upstream
authors, although of course several of them are on the tl list.  I can't
undertake to do anything about them myself.  My job is to copy things
from CTAN :).

It's not a pdf file :).  It's for dvips -Ppdf.

I pored over the gs changelogs (the HistoryN.htm files) and the
authors seem very careful about compliance with PDF standards.  It has
many entries of the form "add workaround for buggy pdf file that
Acroread silently accepts."  So I lean toward trusting gs (but your
point is still valid).

'find -name \*.pdf' is far from an AI :-) So I found it out the long
way (by looking at the file).

    I meant that they should by updated by their authors to support XeTeX.

No question, but this is unlikely to happen for all packages prior to
when we have to cut TL on the discs.

Of course we should clean up as much as we can, but since Jonathan's
.cfg's are no-ops except when running under xetex, they're unlikely to
be a problem if some have to remain.  Better than, say, geometry being
completely broken with XeTeX.  I think that'd be much more likely to
lead to a flood of bug reports.

I've removed the xelatex versions of color.cfg and graphics.cfg from  
TL svn, as the updated "standard" ones should serve fine.

The version in TL is currently 6.75n, and doesn't seem to know about  
xetex, so I haven't touched the .cfg for this yet. Presumably there's  
an update on its way....


Thanks for working on these,

I've updated the xelatex-specific crop.cfg so that it no longer fakes  
a \pdfoutput (it simply forces the driver choice, instead of  
requesting it and then letting the package decide whether it's  
appropriate). This should have little risk of side-effects.

In geometry, this fails because the package tries to look at  
\pdfoutput when the actual document begins, after all packages are  
loaded.

More investigation needed....

OK, I've committed an alternative that is simpler and (I hope) safer,  
for use until geometry.sty becomes xetex-aware.

No. Multivalent is innocent. The culprit is Ghostscript:
The pdf file uses for the  xref object:
  /Type /XRef
  /W [1 3 1]
  /Filter /FlateDecode
  /DecodeParms <<
    /Predictor 12
    /Columns 5
  >>
Only 2 (up) is used as predictor function.
The problem arises in the generation number, example for bmpsize:
ghostscript reports invalid xref entry for 1408:

  2 2834 145 % object 1407
  1 69896 0 % object 1408

However ghostscript resolves the stream, but gets for entry 1408:
  1 69896 255 % object 1408

> But I will upload fixed versions next days

No need, the pdf files are correct, it is a bug of ghostscript.

Also, gs 8.01 accepted the file without a problem, 8.5? complained.

Looking over the warnings emitted during the IRIX compilation, I
spotted multiple definitions of spc_handler in the dvipdfmx source.

As it stands, the code defines an instance of 'struct spc_handler'
called 'spc_handler' in the specials.h header file.  As far as I can
tell, the instance is not used, so the following should fix the
problem:

Hi Karl, hi all!

I checked in 2 small fixes to tpms, more are coming. This is a
consequence of preliminary work on Debian package buildings:

pdftex-def is already incldued in collection-latex, so we don't need it
in collection-latexextra.

collection-latex in the last year depended on collection-pdfetex, but
this is gone. But the dependency was not adjusted to depend on
collection-base, which it should.

Furthermore ams.tpm is included in collection-latex and collection-base,
so remove it from collection-latex.

More changes:
more tpm games:
- fix some descriptions
- move mltex.tpm and bin-mltex.tpm from collection-binextra to
  collection-formatsextra
- move bin-eplain to collection-formatsextra, it was nowhere included!

Unfortunately, many of the TL target audience will have difficulty
avoiding buggy versions of gs.  Many *n*x users are strongly
encouraged to stick with the gs version their vendor provides (linux
users often get ESP ghostscript with CUPS).  Even if a user installs a
new gs, the print system may rely on the older version, which
sometimes has device support not included in default compiles or in
GPL versions.

I plan to check for this bug on the systems at work and file bugs with
the vendors.

It is better if TL provides pdf doc's that work with widely used
ghostscript versions, although the main doc should recommend  a
version that does not have the bug.

I think, the main *viewers* are AR and xpdf. The documents
are intended for reading, searching, but not for wasting paper.
But I have already provided another set of PDF files.

Thanks for reporting that. Please try
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/Projekty/tlpmgui/20070120-setup.zip
(already commited to the TL repo). You can unpack it in any directory
and play with the current iso image you have. Just set the proper path
to the CD (or mounted iso image).

Kind regards,

Hi,

attached is the try of a patch for install-tl.sh and common.sh so that
one gets this screen message:

    Proposed platform: Intel x86_64 with GNU/Linux
    ===> Warning: No binaries for this platform on CDROM! <===

and similar after pressing <P> and selecting a platform without binaries
one gets:

Current platform: Intel x86_64 with GNU/Linux
===> Warning: No binaries for this platform on CDROM! <===

Warnings go away (blank line) if binaries for this platform are on the
CDROM.

Also it's now:

    <B> binary systems:        1 out of  3

Testing welcome.

After talking with Manfred and Klaus, it seems we need to shoot for
Manfred having the final images by January 27 or 28 at the latest to put
into production.

As it happens, I am going to be offline starting January 26, and won't
be back until January 31.

To have some time for testing, I'll plan on stopping package updates and
the auto-updating tomorrow (Sunday), and after that we should only
update in response to critical bugs or documentation-only.  I'll create
the final source tarballs then.

Hope it works out.

Hi Sanjoy,
good that you have the latest release, this makes things easier here.

I guess that there is a problem with Bitstream Charter fonts indeed.
All fonts in vn-min.pdf define RD and ND but the Charter fonts put
this definition to userdict.

 userdict /RD {string currentfile exch readstring pop} executeonly put
 userdict /ND {noaccess def} executeonly put

In PostScript a dictionary is an associative list, or, with other
words, a named list which contains key/value pairs.

A font itself is a dictionary and it should contain all the resources
it needs instead of defining some procedures in other
dictionaries.  In my opinion, even if it is allowed, it's wrong and
dangerous. 

Also, not every Type1 rendering engine is based on a PostScript
interpreter and I expect more problems with other programs.

I suppose that ghostscript people provided a workaround in newer
versions.  If something is not found in the dictionary which is on top
of the dictionary stack it steps down the dictionary stack until it
finds the procedure.

I replaced the lines mentioned above by 

 /RD {string currentfile exch readstring pop} executeonly def
 /ND {noaccess def} executeonly def

and compiled vn-min.pdf again.  The error/warning messages do not
appear any more even with gs-8.50.

All the other fonts define RD and ND like this.

You can download vn-min.pdf which includes the modified fonts from

    http://ms25.ath.cx/vn-min.pdf

You can try the modified fonts yourself:

    http://ms25.ath.cx/charter.zip

is supposed to be extracted in texmf-dist/fonts/type1/bitstrea.  There
are three files for each font.

   *.pfb are the modified fonts.
   *.pfb.gz are the original fonts.
   *.src are the disassembled modified fonts.


Karl, how shall I proceed?  I'm sure that it's better to provide the
modified fonts and it's no problem for me to upload them to the
repository but there might be some conflicts with .tpm files if I just
replace the files.  It would be nice if some people try 

    http://ms25.ath.cx/vn-min.pdf

on screen and with printers.

It's a pity that Tom Kacvinsky is so silent now.  Barbara Beeton told
me that he he's still alive but probably quite busy, but there is
someone else now is responsible for PostScript and fonts at AMS.  I
don't remember his name and do not know his email address but a
comment from him is highly desired. 


Sanjoy,
I do not regard ghostscript as a tool which is able to validate PDF
files.  Their aim is to make everything work, whether it's broken or
not.  Similar with HTML.  You can't use a web browser to determine
whether your HTML file is valid because all developers of web browsers
think that it is a good idea to make their products error tolerant.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It seems a good change, but I'm puzzled that there have been no problems
reported in the last 15 years about it.  At least I don't remember any.
I've used Charter myself on many occasions.

    Karl, how shall I proceed?

If we're going to install this change, I guess the thing to do is upload
the new pfb's to CTAN and check them in to svn.  The originals could be
left in doc/fonts/character-orig.zip or some such (and included in the
CTAN dir too), or just omitted.

    someone else now is responsible for PostScript and fonts at AMS.

I am not aware that the AMS has anything to do with Charter.

It's a pity that everything will be frozen now because texmf.cnf for
Windows is completely broken at the moment.  I don't know what can be
done because, though I made several suggestions, I did not get any
response from Staszek.

getnonfreefonts will definitely not work anymore because TEXMFHOME had
been removed from TEXMF.  This had been done deliberately in order to
break getnonfreefonts but I don't know whether other programs are
affected too.

Currently TeXLive-2007 is a mixture between a per-user and a
system-wide installation.  All *-sys programs had been removed but
there is still a TEXMFLOCAL directory (which is supposed to contain
files provided by an administrator) but not a TEXMFHOME (which is
supposed to contain files provided by a user).

The problem was TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf and that $HOME is usually not
set on Windows.

I provided a lot of suggestions how to set TEXMFHOME to something
reasonable but none of them had been acceptable for Staszek.

He preferred to remove TEXMFHOME from TEXMF for no good reason.  He
even did not reply to my mails.

It's a pity to see that things evolved like this.  I spent an enormous
amount of time to make sure TeXLive works on Windows reasonably.  But
I'm quite disappointed now and in the future I'll only care about
things I use myself.

Sorry, but I don't understand why things are broken deliberately.

Proceed as you want, I'll forward all bug reports concerning
getnbonfreefonts to Staszek.  He is the guy who broke it
***deliberately***. 

In the future, if people report problems, I'll point them to MikTeX or
Akira's W32-TeX because the Windows port of TeXLive is not a
TeXLive-like system and had been broken deliberately.  People can
avoid a lot of headaches if they install something better instead.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry, nobody had removed "all *-sys programs", as they never existed
on Windows.

As I wrote several times, HOME is not set in Windows and/or can be
differently interpreted on different Windows versions.
So TEXMFHOME can/should be set to the absolute path manualy only by the 
user.
I'm still trying to find any good solution, but I feel left somehow
alone, as nobody from Windows users wants to give me a help. Reinhard, 
sorry, you are not Windows user, but I really appreciate your effort
to make things working also on Windows.
As I wrote you, I removed (temporarily) TEXMFHOME from the TEXMF 
declaration only because it makes confussion for the _users_ eg. while 
running mktexlsr, but _not only_ (soory, I have no time to explain
all consequences).

Ahhh, why so sad? I suggested you to use TEXMFLOCAL for
getnonfreefonts.bat, as TEXMFLOCAL is easily set on Windows and even
current installer prepares such directory. Please observe, that _only_
getnonfreefonts demands/forces existing TEXMFHOME set (on win32) at the 
moment. Of course, I can make you happy and set TEXMFHOME=$TEXMFLOCAL
as you suggested, but I still need some more time for rethinking, 
testing, but not spending the time on writing all the above (yes, it takes 
most of my time to answer all urgent mails).

Reinhard,

Interesting investigation.  

By running pdf2ps with -dDEBUG I had also found that the Bitstream
fonts were causing problems.  The complaints about ND and RD happened
while gs was parsing one of the Bitstream Charter fonts, but I
couldn't figure out how to uncompress the font stream to see how ND
and RD were defined.

Probably this bugfix for gs 8.54 solved those messages (log entry from
History8.htm in the gs-8.54 tar.bz2).  It looks like Bitstream falls
into the category of 'correct but old-fashioned', so maybe the bug
really is in gs and it's okay to leave the .pfb's as is.  If so, sorry
for the noise!  [And I am now 100% convinced that gs is not useful as
a PDF validator.  As Heiko said, if anyone knows of a free-software
PDF validator, do tell.]

      2006-01-11T13:20:01.631161Z Alex Cherepanov

      Move back-up CharString construction procedures (RD, ND, ...) to a
      special dictionary and put it below userdict to avoid warnings
      when the font defines them in userdict.

      Bug 688464

      DETAILS:

      Some broken fonts forget to define CharString construction
      procedures because non-PostScript font rasterizers don't detect
      this error. Ghostscript has a back-up definitions of the
      procedures that do their job and issue a warning.

      Other correct but old-fashioned fonts define CharString

      definitions below userdict.

FYI t1disasm on one of Bitstream Charter font files gives:

   ..
   userdict /RD {string currentfile exch readstring pop} executeonly put
   userdict /ND {noaccess def} executeonly put
   ..

This is perfectly acceptable: the use of userdict for this purpose
is even documented as an option in the Type1 Specification.

Ok, found them. I needed to know the exact versions to use.

I have simply added yet another 68 map files to map/pdftex/context
and map/dvipdfm/context combined.

A number of the map files are now present in both the
dvips/{lm,tex-gyre} and pdftex/context directory. Some other map
files now appear under both the old and the new naming convention
in dvipdfm/context (eg. qtm-ec.map vs ec-qtm.map).

Sorry about the wasted bytes, but I have no time for testing this
thoroughly, making this the only way I can be reasonably sure
ConTeXt will still run properly (remember latin-modern is the
default font family in ConTeXt, not cmr).

Best,
Taco

Hi Heiko,

for some reason, hyperref/hpdftex.def sets \pdfcompresslevel=9,
overriding user default which is nowadays stored in pdftexconfig.tex
(and previously in pdftex.ini) and preloaded into format.

what is the reason for this, and could you remove setting of
\pdfcompresslevel if there's no need for it there?

Perhaps in early days, \pdfcompresslevel was zero.
For a better answer you must do some historical research.

Perhaps pdfTeX did not understand
compressed PDF back in the early days

if it didn't understand compressed PDF, why setting \pdfcompresslevel
to 9, then? :)

please do that when you'll have time :)

the current default in pdftexconfig.tex is already 9, so there's no
need to set it in hyperref; and doing this makes it harder to overide
the compress level.

Message-ID: <ep0d2c$1go$1@sea.gmane.org>

After installing texlivetest2007-inst-20070121.iso, I've had a major 
problem with latex documents using latin modern fonts through

\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

These documents don't displaying correctly (both the dvi and pdf); more 
precisely, the math fonts are replaced by the roman font, and the 
document takes forever to display and looks like gibberish. I diffed the 
psfonts.map files in 20070120 and 20070121, and there were new entries 
in the latter for all sorts of lm fonts, but I'm not sure what's the 
impact of this on my problem. In any case, what I do know is that none 
of this happened with previous test (inst) versions up to 20070120.

Cheers,

Artemio

P.S. This is much less important, but I've also noted a couple of 
glitches regarding texconfig. First of all, arrow keys have stopped 
working (I must use the +/- keys, which is less convenient; I'm using 
ncurses 5.6 on Mac OS X 10.4.8). Also, it is impossible to open 
config.ps via texconfig (when you select it in the dvips menu you just 
go back to the main menu).

maybe it's the time for bitmap generation, and then the pixelish bitmaps
on screen. Here lmmi wasn't in pdftex.map, as lm-math.map wasn't in the
updmap.cfg. After "updmap-sys --enable Map=lm-math.map" proper Type1
fonts were used. (But whether lm-math.map is the right map file i have
no idea, there are sooo many map files.)

Hi all!

Hartmut Henkel build new x86_64 binaries on Debian/sarge, which seems to
be the oldest existing system. The problem with the current binaries
lies in the fact that they are linked against the newer Xorg libraries
which includes a linking with libXau.so, which is not available on
XFree86/older systems.

Testing of these binaries have been done by Hartmut and Reinhard
(Kotucha), but if x86_64 people want to do other testing please let us
know.

Otherwise I propose to check in the current binaries ....

Any comments?

Best wishes

    glitches regarding texconfig

Strange, since as far as I know, texconfig terminal handling has not
changed one iota for some years now.  My wild guess would be some
system-specific aspect of the terminfo setup.  The arrow keys work for
me.  So I am disinclined to try to deal with it now, sorry.

As for the config.ps problem, I'm not sure what has changed there.  For
me, when I try to select the dvips menu, the interactive texconfig
completely exits.  Oh well.  Can't deal with that now either.

Thanks for testing nonetheless :).

texmf-dist/tex/latex/economic/harvard.sty
texmf-dist/tex/latex/harvard/harvard.sty

MiKTeX-2.5 also suffers from this problem.  The version in
economic causes problems for people expecting the
other one -- don't know if the reverse is also true.

I suppose this is unavoidable.   I'd suggest people who encounter this
complain to package authors and then copy the file they want to use to
a place like texmf-local earlier in the search path.

there was a change btw. In former lmodern.sty only text related
\rm|sf|ttdefault were defined. Seems old lmodern.sty gave just cm math
fonts. The new lmodern.sty from 14 jan 07 handles also math by lm,
therefore the lm-math.map might be needed.

Imagine that you install TL and run texconfig as a normal user. The
map files will then be in texmf-var. Afterwards you install newer
version with different map files but you configure it as root. When
you work as a normal user, TL will use the old map files from
texmf-var and you can expect problems. Running updmap --syncwithtrees
often fixes such problems.

Indeed, can you write to the economic author and ask him to rename his
harvard.sty?  We've had the harvard harvard.sty in TL forever, while I
just added economic this year.  I'll remove economic pending some
resolution, I guess, since the economic harvard.sty is used by other
files in economic and I'm not going to make that many changes.

    I suppose this is unavoidable.

I think there are very few, if any, clashes of style files like this
(that aren't program-specific and resolved by search paths).

Glad you noticed.

Yes. We have it already at the place.

Harmut,

Thanks for the suggestion! I ran "updmap-sys --enable Map=lm-math.map", 
which indeed fixed the problem, but only after a few pk fonts were 
generated. In your message, however, you mention that proper T1 fonts 
should be used after lm-math.map is enabled, so I'm not sure if things 
are working as expected (although I should say that both the dvi and pdf 
files display correctly, even after considerable magnification). Am I 
missing something here (for instance, do I need screen fonts for Mac OS 
X not provided by TL, etc.)?

Thanks again for your help,

Artemio

Hi Karl!

Do you know why this happens: seminar.tpm mentions
	texmf-dist/doc/latex/seminar/sem-user.ind
which is not present in the repository. So is the file missing or the
tpm out of date? The later would surprise me, aren't the tpm files
rebuild at any image creation?

You can use 'pdffonts foo.pdf' to find out which fonts are embedded in
foo.pdf, whether they are Type 1 or Type 3 fonts, etc. This will tell
you whether any LM font was embedded in bitmap format.

Note: pdffonts is presumably shipped with xpdf, since it comes in the
      Debian xpdf-utils package.

it's not unavoidable.  the harvard/ copy is the current, maintained,
one; i doubt that the ones on the bibtex tree (there are two there) are
even appropriate for current usage.

i guess we've slipped up here.  for tex-live, i would recommend simply
removing the copy in economic/ -- which looks as if it has been edited
since 2.09, but the editor has carefully hidden his tracks.

i'll
(1) establish whether anything is lost by junking economic/harvard.sty
(2) contact arne, to see if we can't get this sorted as far as ctan is
concerned.

given the timescale, i doubt anything other than the above can solve the
problem for tex-live.

I checked, both of them do still apply to the svn repository.

While building new binaries should not happen, I agree, there is no  
reason not to check it in as soon as it is available (which is now)  
as some people do not install the ISO, but compile from source (and  
thus would/could get the benefit.

Karl,

Thanks a lot for your help. I tried inst-2007-01-22 and found out  
that texconfig is experiencing much worse problems than in the  
previous version. More precisely, when I go up and down in the menu  
list, the text for the menu item just selected and the previous one  
is repeated in reverse video, totally destroying the interface's  
appearance. Fortunately, the menus are still funcional, except for  
dvips configuration/global (which reverts to the previous screen).  
Since I didn't update anything in my system between 2007-01-21 and  
2007-01-22, I guess this probably reflects some last minute changes  
in texconfig, so I just wanted to let you know in case it helps.

Thanks again for everything,

Artemio

I have just repeated my tests described in my first mail in this
thread.  I now _cannot_ reproduce any of errors described there--i.e.

1) (Non)Installation seems now to beconsistent. Especially ff I
uncheck the "Perl" collection no Perl is installed.

2) When removing TL by tlpmgui my original %PATH% is correctly restored (Uff).

And even better:

3) tlpmgui correctly detects that I have Ghostscript already installed
at my system, and issues an appropriate warning.

Now I could even recommend to an average Win user to use tlpmgui to install TL.

At the moment I have only 2 minor questions / suggestions:

a)  I did only choose base, English and German documentation to be
installed. Even so I the directories of all other documentation
packages are created too (for instance there is a
"%TLroot%\texmf-doc\doc\bulgarian" dir etc) although they correctly do
not contain any file. Would it be possible to omit creation of dirs
only used by packages not installed?

b) When I check the "Perl" collection for installation I will be
correctly asked whether I really want to install Perl. (I can deny it,
and no Perl we be installed.) But other than in the Ghostview case no
hint is given that Perl is already installed on my system. A similar
detection mechanism like for Ghostscript would be nice.

Otherwise--thank you for nice work
Dirk

Subject: [tex-live] marvosym not updated
Message-ID: <86mz4bta85.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

while digging through old teTeX bugs that are marked fixed-upstream in
the Debian BTS, I found that marvosym in TL 2007 is still 

\ProvidesPackage{marvosym}
  [2000/05/01 v2.0 Martin Vogel's Symbols font definitions]

while CTAN has 

\ProvidesPackage{marvosym}
  [2006/05/11 v2.1 Martin Vogel's Symbols font definitions]

which fixes one bug and generally uses "cleaner", more LaTeXish
coding. The tpm file says it has been updated in January 06, before the
upload. 

TIA, Frank

Hi,  

there's one more file that exists in two versions:

$ locate ifmtarg.sty | grep Upstream| grep -v .svn
/home/frank/src/Upstream-source/TeXLive/Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/ltxmisc/ifmtarg.sty
/home/frank/src/Upstream-source/TeXLive/Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/peterw/ifmtarg.sty

The files do not differ, though, and it doesn't exist on CTAN.

Regards, Frank

i don't understand that last: ifmtarg.sty _does_ exist on ctan; are you
in fact saying that the clash doesn't exist on ctan?

Subject: [tex-live] Problem using psgreek-package
Message-ID: <f4c832270701220651p7bc1bb22pe490bd673f200ff6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am using Texlive2005 (inst.-ver.) on Kubuntu 6.06. I have installed the
unzipped psgreek-package, copied everything to the corresponding places in
/texmf-local/ and modified the config.ps-file in /dvips/config/.  Afterwards
I ran texhash and updmap. Trying to run a minimum file like:
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[polutonikogreek,english]{babel}
\usepackage{psgreek}
\begin{document}
\selectlanguage{greek} Swkr'aths >~w pa~i Klein'iou, o>~ima'i se jaum'azein
\\
\selectlanguage{english} Socrates Son of Cleinias, I think it must
surprise\\
\end{document}
...
no error-messages occur but the greek text isn't displayed at all or not in
greek characters. If I modify \usepackage{psgreek} to
\usepackage[rmfont=cmr]{psgreek} or \usepackage[rmfont=kerkis]{psgreek}
everything works fine. When I run \usepackage{psgreek} with standard font
set to \sffamily, the Hancock-Milan-font of the psgreek-package will display
the greek text correctly. But running the document with
\usepackage[sffont=milan]{psgreek} will result in no greek text at all only
the english sentence being shown.

Psgreek seems to work and at least the milan font can be displayed correctly
(dvi als well as pdf). What about oldface, regular, garamond, oxonia? Can
anybody help me?

Thanks in advance

Bert

Sorry, yes, this is what I meant:  There's only one ifmtarg on CTAN, and
hence no name clash.

True. I can check this in easily. But I want to try tonight the
automated mode and write an adaption to ctan2tl, so that next updates
are automatically ...

Do not fear that.  I was only checking in which collection (=Debian
package) it is and found that it was at two locations.

Thanks for your script!

These should not cause problems. csplain searches tex/csplain first,
while tex searches tex/plain and tex/generic and tex/csplain is not
named explicitly.  cslatex starts searching in tex/cslatex and
tex/csplain while latex similarly goes to these directories if the
file is not found elsewhere. Moreover, whenever new czech.ldf and
slovak.ldf get into babel, cslatex will disappear (in the next TL).

Bruno Voisin just pointed out that basic XeTeX documentation (such as  
it is) was not present in TL, so I have added a couple of documents  
(in source and pdf form) in texmf-dist/doc/xetex.

Hope that's OK; is this the appropriate place for them? If not,  
please move them or tell me where you'd prefer them to go. And do you  
need to do anything to add these to a package, or does it happen  
automagically?

Thanks,

Yes, that was a good decission to quarantine a little LM (and Tex Gyre)
before uploading on CTAN (as well as having some sleep :-)
We decided here to include lm-math.map into lm.map as a safer solution,
esp. for CTAN and other distributions. I reverted an action in lm.tpm and 
updated a little both families.

No, it's a mystery.  To my knowledge there have been no changes in the
interactive texconfig code at all in a long time (like, years).  There

I guess we'll have to try resolve this later.  Interactive texconfig

i mailed him this afternoon, but had no reply yet.

i've also set off on a trail of trying to find peter williams, who's

    The first one is for mktexmf from Werner Lemberg, I found it here on the
    list I guess

Excuse my ignorance, but I don't understand the goal.  We're using $name
to test for csso12..., and $rootname to test for everything else?  Why?

    The second one is a bit a bitter one: 

Bitter is right.  We hacked asn_date in dvipdfmx mercilessly this year.
I suspect it would be better to use what we have there, but I'm not
about to test it.

Anyway, no more recompilations now.

The real goal is to get rid of dvipdfm and just have dvipdfmx.  I hope
ChoF can find the time to do the few remaining tweaks he said were needed.

I've been doing the builds out of my copy of the repository for

I'll check for other instances, and do the next build out of a "clean"

Windows has always been broken in this regard, and (vendors' claims to
the contrary notwithstanding) many well-known commercial apps suffer
from settings leaks across users.

Never underestimate the difficulty of doing things sensible on WIn32.
What would unix/linux be like if 98% of all users habitually worked as
root?  If you feel Win32 developers have let you down, just remember
that they have taken on a very difficult problem that may not have a
really satisfactory solution by the standards of people accustomed to
the alternatives.

What about adding a template in texmf.cnf for a non-free fonts tree
that the user can create wherever suits?

    * Conflicts in TDS

Yeah, Hans sent me a similar list (among others) a long time ago,
unfortunately it never got to the top of my queue, and here we are.

I fixed some of them by removing packages, namely piff and CV and
toptesi, and the duplicate truncate.sty in pdfwin (which is apparently
not on CTAN, sigh).  Plenty of conflicts remain and should be addressed,
but (a) they were all in TL2005 and earlier, and (b) I think most of the
differences are cosmetic.

About the two different plain verbatim.tex's, neither has a stated
copyright notice and neither has a stated author.  Sigh.  The genmisc
one is probably by someone from the UK (wild guess, Phil Taylor?), since
the word "shew" is in there.  The gustlib one is presumably by Jacko or
another Polish hacker.

I'm going to rebuild now.  I didn't update marvosym, hopefully either
Norbert or I will get to that tomorrow.  It's a mess.

Thanks,
karl

Hi Werner, hi all,

can you give me information on the copyright/license status of
glyphlist.txt and texglyphlist.txt (in glyphlist.tpm)?

The former seems to be downloaded from Adobe, but I couldn't find it any
more on their site.  Whether the latter is derived from the former, or
an independent work I do not know.

Neither of them contains a copyright or license statement, but it
appears to me to be copyrightable material.  There's a different version
of glyphlist.txt, with more comments and a change history, on CTAN in
ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/t2/enc-maps/glyphlist.txt 

It would be great if we could clear this up.

BTW, texglyphlist.txt ist part of the lcdf tools, so there is no

Ken,


what's the copyright status of the file `glyphlist.txt'?  There is no
statement within the file itself -- this should be added.

For clarification, we are using

  http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt

Hopefully, it has a copyright similar to the AFM files you've sent to
me some time ago so that we can include it into Debian and TeXLive.

PS: The same question arises for the files `zapfdingbats.txt' and
    `aglfn.txt'.

Highly likely to be mine, since (a) I wrote one;

For XP/PRO, the following pair seem to be what is needed :

	HOMEDRIVE=C:
	HOMEPATH=\Documents and Settings\Administrator

Do we have a small corpus of Windows devotees who could
investigate if there are matching environment
variables for some or all other versions of Windows ?

so should we delete that version from ctan?  (and presumably also from
tex-live, but that's not my game.)

itym, for *your* xp/pro, when you're logged-in as "administrator".

i have

      homedrive=h:
      homepath=\

(and, fwiw, homeshare pointing to the path associated with h:)

i doubt those variables _are_ available in all win32 systems, but i've
none other here (though i could sneak a login on one of the experimental
vista machines ... my machine isn't man enough for vista).

thanks.

we (ctan) now have an upload of a new version that doesn't contain a
harvard.sty.  unfortunately he's uploaded it to the tug box, so it won't
get installed for quite a while, but it's on its way.

In my Win 2000:
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOMEPATH=\Documents and Settings\wagner

I can examine Win98 and WinXP Home at home at around midnight
(although I am not Win devotee).

No no no : I was referring to environment /variables/, not
a particular instantiation thereof.  We both have (under
XP/PRO)

        HOMEDRIVE
        HOMEPATH

regardless of their particular instantation.

Here they are again in Server 2000 :

	HOMEDRIVE=C:
	HOMEPATH=\Documents and Settings\Chaa006

and in Server 2003

	HOMEDRIVE=C:
	HOMEPATH=\Documents and Settings\chaa006

If I can find some older or newer systems, I will repert again.

no it doesn't; homeshare exists on my xp pro system and on our
2003 terminal server machine.

i imagine it's only present if your home directory is on a server rather
than the machine's own disc.  this is the case for all user accounts on
all managed machines here.

Hi,
the english and french live.pdf are broken, maybe because of a bug in
pdftex. pdffonts shows the problems. If I create the files myself with
my non-TL installation, I have no problems.

Could somebody please try to recreate these file with a current TL
installation and see if these problems persist?

i think i should eventually update it, or just remove from the "t2"
package. for now i've removed it from ftp.vsu.ru and you could also
remove it from CTAN (or, if it still mirrors it from ftp.vsu.ru, it
will happen automatically).

done with pdftex from current TeX Live. Everything ok.

it was temporary flaw from missing lm-math.map.

it seems that after a try of pk font generation failed so that no pk
font is included, this is tolerated by pdftex instead of raising a
pdftex_fail(). So seems that this call is missing at the required place.
Actually i've seen it happen before, should be reproducible. We have to
check into this...

Dear Phil and others,

I do not think that's good time to investigate all that mess with
HOME on Windows *at this moment*. Sorry, but such discussion cannot have
any impact for *this* release of TL. 

I'm going again to describe in short the current state (sorry for bad 
wording, but I'm really in a hurry and overloaded):
1. HOME (as is) is *not* set on Windows
2. we can divagate again and again how it can be guessed and resolved
   on *so many* different Windows versions, but it does't lead to any
   final conclusion (any volunteer to reprogram all Windows binaries 
   for TL?...)
3. we need HOME set if we want to use any relative path patterns defined
   in texmf.cnf
4. most Windows users don't need HOME set at all
5. we can then persuade the BLU: please set HOME in your environment
   (or change TEXMFHOME in texmf.cnf to the *absolute* path), but as TL
   installation and configuration is still enough complicated, please 
   give me any advice where to put such information (on the CD cover?...) 
   and who is going to document it in the best way?

ad 2. As I recall, Fabrice tried to guess HOME (or set TEXMFHOME 
internally in the programs) but it not worked in the same manner on all
different Windows versions, and not all programs used that.

ad 3. at the moment $TEXMFHOME set in texmf.cnf is used only by
new getnonfreefonts.bat from Reinhard. No other win32 program from TL
needs TEXMFHOME set, as we still *do not have* (so don't use at all on 
win32) fmtutil-sys, updmap-sys, etc., introduced in teTeX 3.0.

Having all the above in mind (and after waiting so many months for any
advice or suggestion from this mailing list) I decided to include somehow
modified texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf-4WIN file which is copied into
$TEXMFVAR/web2c/texmf.cnf by the tlpmgui during installation. I made it 
even Reihard (the only fellow who wanted to discuss it!) was on opposite 
side, but I made it anyway after testing on different windows versions
just to make things working.

All in all, what's different in texmf.cnf for windows:

1. TEXMFSYSVAR, TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFCONFIG not declared, as not used 
   at all (so also removed from TEXMF)
2. 
%TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texlive2006/texmf-var
TEXMFVAR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var

3. upon request from Reinhard
% This used to be HOMETEXMF. On Windows $HOME is not set, so the user have
% to set TEXMFHOME to the absolute path. For the moment we use TEXMFLOCAL
%TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf
TEXMFHOME = $TEXMFLOCAL

still discutable solution, but it works. Anyway, I do not want to be 
accused any more personally by Reinhard that I broke everything!:)
I also made a provision, that TEXMFDBS does not include TEXMFHOME, so
every texhash does not try redundant run.

4. added for XeTeX
%OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment
OSFONTDIR = $SystemRoot/fonts//

Hey, native Windows users (not counting Reihard:), do you have any 
comments?

-----
Please note also, that we got a great help from Akira, so again thanks to 
him we can still have win32 on TeX Live.

I am happy to agree to that, but the lack of
the HOME variant (as opposed to the VAR
variant) was always a shortcoming of Fabrice's
installer and led to several exchanges between
myself and Fabrice, myself and Sebastian and so
on, none of which actually resolved the problem.

So, all I am trying to do in adducing the existence
of HOME variants in Windows' environment variables
is to /try/ to ensure that, for some future TeX Live,
we can do even better to achieve consistency between
the various platforms.

I have even given some thought to how an
installer might reasonably (a) interrogate
the user as to his/her preferences, and (b)
interactive with the Windows environment so
as to (where necessary) create new environment
variables /and/ enumerate them in a configuration
file so as to reduce (and ideally eliminate)
any adverse effect on any other program(s) that
rely on environment variables that clash with
the preferred names.  But that is for the future :
as you (Staszek) say, this is too late for TL2006/7.

But PLEASE : let us not forget it for TL2007/8.

** Phil.

In my own scripts for Windows, I use USERPROFILE, usually something
like <drive>:\Documents and Settings\<user name>

This is some sort of read-only registry variable, and is set
automatically as an environment variable in a command prompt window.

It is available both under Windows 2000 and Windows XP, but
apparently not under earlier versions.

Message-ID: <20070123185549.GC27476@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi Karl!

There are some pool files in texmf/web2c which are:
- never created in the compile process
- are installed
- are not related to any binary AFAIS

These are:
	pdfetex-pl.pool
	tex-pl.pool
	pdfetex.pool
(wiht pdfetex.pool I am not sure whether we need it for the link...)

But the two -pl files are really strange to my eyes.

I suggest:
- removing the stuff
- removing pdfetex-pl.pool from the texmf/tpm/bin-pdftex.tpm (2 times,
  one time in the pattern, one time in the runfiles)
- removing tex-pl.pool from the texmf/tpm/bin-tex.tpm (2 times,
  one time in the pattern, one time in the runfiles)

I can do this ... but I need the ok from one of the -pl gurus and/or
Karl.

Best wishes

Norbert

We don't need that as it is very old .pool file, not compatible with
the current pdftex.

Yeah, that was experimental work done by Thomas and Wlodek, not maintained
any more, so those files are also obsolete (that means: not regenerated
in the compile process).

Please do all that. One thing more to consider: we can also
remove in texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf all those lines concerning
"experimental" -pl formats. They do not hurt so much, but for a sake...

Ok, I assume you are talking about the -pl.pool files, not about the
pdfetex.pool file.

Yes, also about pdfetex.pool. Please observe, that it is obsolete:
- pdfetex is now a link to pdftex

Sorry my permanence, but I don't want to mess up everythin in the last
minute.

I asked "Ok, I assume ..., NOT about..." and you answered "Yes, ..."
which for me says "Right, I am only talking about the -pl stuff".

So IF I remove the pdfetex.pool file, will NOTHING break? Can someone
check this?

The -pl stuff is already gone ...

Sorry for my bad wording. I meant: you can also remove pdfetex.pool 
as completely obsolete (and dated Jan 3 2006 :-)

Yes, I checked that, eg. after removing pdfetex.pool:
pdfetex --ini *pdfetex.ini
or running fmtutil

Hi,

is there any trick how to do a global svn update, but leave parts of the
repository out (particularly Master/bin directories of systems not
relevant for my PC). Thanks for help.

svn propset svn:ignore foobar PATH ...

$ svn help propset
propset (pset, ps): Set the value of a property on files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. propset PROPNAME PROPVAL PATH...
       2. propset PROPNAME --revprop -r REV PROPVAL [TARGET]

  1. Creates a versioned, local propchange in working copy.
  2. Creates an unversioned, remote propchange on repos revision.
     TARGET only determines which repository to access.

  The value may be provided with the --file option instead of PROPVAL.

  Note: svn recognizes the following special versioned properties
  but will store any arbitrary properties set:
    svn:ignore     - A newline separated list of file patterns to ignore.
...

I do not know so many svn tricks, but I always use Reinhard's script
(made in Bachotek :-) which makes svn update much faster. I hope that 
Rainhard is not against if I send you it (he already gave it to the 
community some months ago).

It's only good for slow machines.  It downloads the logfile first and
runs "svn update" only on the directories mentioned in the logfile.

It makes sense to run "svn update" occasionally to be sure that my
simple script does not forget anything.

I had not been aware that someone is using the script, I had been told
that Staszek has a new machine, but if anybody has problems with the
script, please let me know.

  Reinhard

Yes, you are right.  But when I wrote the script I didn't expect that
anybody else except Staszek will used it.  Hence I had been quite
careless regarding the copyright stuff.

Hi Staszek,
I assume that nobody expects from you that you make significant
changes now,  TeXLive-2007 had been frozen anyway.

On the other hand, I'm quite interested that the Windows version does
not differ so much from the UNIX version.  I'd like to help but I do
not have much experience with Windows.  Therefore I think that the
discussion about the different versions of Windows is quite useful.

I'm aware that you don't have enough time to think about such things
now.  Don't worry.  The discussion is useful though.  As I said
before, I have no experience with Windows, especially not with the
many Windows releases floating around and it's great if people provide
some information here.

Staszek, as I said in a previous mail, it is more convenient to talk
about the details at the next TeX conference instead of spending a lot
of time writing emails.  But I regard the current discussion as being
very helpful.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

No, compression on inst is insignificant (because most all the contents
are already compressed).  That's why I don't do it.

Also, we should not encourage usage of inst "by default", since it has
binaries for only three architectures.

Probably not.  The "live" version has lots of unpacked files, while
the inst version is mostly
zip archives, so applying bzip2 to "inst" wouldn't be expected to give
nearly the same benefit.

What would make the greatest sense to me (and forgive me
if this is already in place) is that the server should
use content negotation to serve the highest preference
in the "accept" header for which a corresponding compressor
exists on the server.  Thus if, for example, the client
indicates

	Accept: application/bzip2;q=0.9, application/zip;q=0.8,
				application/octet-stream;q=0.5

then the server should serve BZIP2 if it can, else ZIP, else
the uncompressed ISO image ...

    In my legal system, putting something in the public
    domain means relinquishing copyright.....

Indeed, copyright and public domain are mutually exclusive.

Plus Debian, especially, has brought to light that putting something in
the "public domain" before its time is not even a concept in lots of
legal jurisdictions.  Therefore they now recommend

Copyright YYYY Whoever
You may freely use, modify and/or distribute this file.

as the minimal free/all-permissive license.  Annoyingly, it means that
copyright years then have to be updated forever after, but it seems
there is no alternative in our benighted world.

Alternatively, you could wait 10 minutes longer
for the download and go have a nice cup of tea?
Downloading a TeX Live image is not
exactly time criticial!

Of course, if you pay for downloads by byte,
I suppose it matters.

As long as you don't commit the property changes (which seems like it
would be very easy to do by accident).  Then the dirs would start
getting ignored for everyone else, too.  As far as I know.

I don't see any kind of exclude options in the --help messages, although

You are right, this is really dangerous. Sorry for suggesting this!!

I believe (I never tried it) that it would work to add stuff to the
.subversion configuration file under
	global-ignores
see svn-book, Chapter 7. Advanced Topics:

       global-ignores
When running the svn status command, Subversion lists unversioned files
and directories along with the ver-
sioned ones, annotating them with a ? character (see the section called
"svn status"). Sometimes, it can be an-
noying to see uninteresting, unversioned items--for example, object
files that result from a program's compila-
tion--in this display. The global-ignores option is a list of
whitespace-delimited globs which describe the
names of files and directories that Subversion should not display unless
they are versioned. The default value is
*.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store.


Maybe this could help?

Best wishes

Subject: [tex-live] suggestion for texlive install
Message-ID: <45B7A606.2010809@brown.edu>


I am perhaps a good test case, because I am not a tex wizard.  So, my
ignorance may be a plus.


May I suggest that install-tl.sh (or its equivalent) check whether there
is an existing tex application somewhere first?  perhaps an easy way is
to look for directories in all the places where the texlive distribution
will write its own files; PLUS  a search for tex in $PATH and $TEXPATH.

if any installation is found, the install could ask the user whether
texlive install should [a] remove all traces of the old installation
(presumably in $PATH and $TEXPATH), [b] whether texlive should simply
install over it, or [c] whether the user wants to abort the installation
for now.

An enhanced install next step could look into  /usr/local/* and see if
there exist tex packages that are being superseded by newer versions
from texlive.  If so, the older versions could/should be removed (or
moved), perhaps with user authorization.  this program requires some
intelligence---looking at the version of the files in /usr/local/ and
comparing them to the files in /usr/texlive (ok, an insider filename
joke).  an alternative would be not to look at the versions, but to
print at the end of the install a note that packages xyz have been
installed, but are non-functional because the user's /usr/local/ version
takes precedence.


I am just trying to anticipate some work for you TeXfolks that will come
from people mixing up distributions, which you might be able to avoid. 
Yes, I understand that people with sense should do this themselves, but
the fact is that a fraction of even smart people will make such errors
that will be painful for them and for the nice folks in comp.text.tex
that need to answer the confused questions.

I actually think it's more helpful to point people to the general web
page than the specific pdf reference manual.  I know I'd be looking for
something a little more general to get started with, at least.

We could do both, but I don't think it's really worth it at this point.
(Or any other final tweaks to the manuals.  They can always be improved,
but we have to stop sometime lest the translators go insane.)

However, Hartmut added a paragraph (to English live.tex) about manpath
configuration.  So if any translators still retain their insanity, here
is the new text:

Norbert updated marvosym, and I reinstated economic since the

last (?) update of oberdiek.

I don't know of any remaining critical issues, so I'm rebuilding the

There had been a lot of error messages but for me it had been
sufficient to run svn up. Seems that

Are /etc/manpath.config and $MANPATH_MAP portable?  My old UNIX manual

Dear TeXperts---I am reading the documentation
texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/live.html.  Alas, the site does not
want to serve up http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts right
now, and I was hoping to get my old and trusty Y&Y lucida fonts to work
under texlive 2007.

I also looked at http://www.tug.org/store/lucida/order.html , and there
is presumably an installation file that comes in the email together with
the TUG packaged fonts---but because I am not ordering the fonts
[already have 'em], I don't see this install file.  Another problem here
is of course that many of the installation instructions on the web and
perhaps whatever comes with the tug lucida fonts may refer to older
distributions, such as the tetex distribution [I wrote one installation
guide a long time ago, which then became obsolete, too].

Pointers to some basic docs that are the correct ones for 2007 would be
appreciated.

Regards,

/ivo

We have a new file needed for pdftex by Thanh; I've add it as
texmf-dist/tex/generic/pdftex/glyphtounicode.tex

It's still without a license, but I'm discussing this with Thanh. And
it's not in a tpm yet.

i have no idea. For people who can use it on their system (they can
check out; debian has it) it should work nicely, reason enough for
addition.

Sorry also for this late edit, should have done this much earlier.

Where does $TEXPATH come from?  Setting $PATH is sufficient.

TeXLive does not remove any files.  You can have different versions
installed on your system.  The version which is first in PATH is used.

If you have TL-2005 installed and did not change the default
istallation directory you have:

/usr/local/texlive/2005
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

If you install TL-2007 you'll get a new directory:

/usr/local/texlive/2007

The texmf-local directory will not be touched.

Since you have to set PATH yourself manually, you can always decide which
version you want to use.  You can remove old versions at any time but
you don't have to.

If people have set any TEX* variable in the environment, they might have
a problem.  But I always recommended not to do that.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Ok.

    texmf-dist/tex/generic/pdftex/glyphtounicode.tex

If it's a basic part of pdftex that will be maintained as part of the
pdftex distribution, texmf would be better than texmf-dist.  Simpler for
the tpm's too.

    It's still without a license, but I'm discussing this with Thanh. 

Since it's directly derived from other data, I think it needs to be
whatever the license is of the original data, which we don't know.
However, I'm not worried about it.

Thanks,

To systems using manpath, as the paragraph says.

    My (from 1988) doesn't mention it.  Is it a GNU extension?

No, it's specifically not a GNU package.

    want to serve up http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts right

There are a lot of CTAN mirrors, not to mention the three backbones.  I
bet one of them will work, e.g., try http://www.tex.ac.uk/.  Not to
mention that the Type1fonts document is in TL, which I gather you
already downloaded.  As far as I know it is still relevant, though I
don't know how much help you'll find it for the particular case of
Lucida.
    
    I also looked at http://www.tug.org/store/lucida/order.html , an

All the Lucida files distributed by TUG except the actual pfb's are on
CTAN (http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts/bh/lucida/), so you
can read them there.  The installation documentation is not extensive.
It basically says, "unpack the archive in texmf-local".  And I haven't
yet managed to add an item talking about the potential need to run
updmap.

So in your case, what you want to do is get the lucida.zip file from
CTAN, unpack it in texmf-local, and then copy your pfb's to the right
place.

There's a lucida at tug.org mailing list.  In fact you may even have posted
there already, I can't recall :).

The TL documentation talks about installing TL, not about installing
individual packages.

    prescribes for derivations. 

Yes, sure, that's what I meant.

    LPPL being one notable exception since it disallows distributing
    derivatives with the same file names

No, that's no longer the case.

Also, in general, I don't think we should change the documentation any

Some time ago I added two lines about MANPATH and INFOPATH to
common.sh, which is used by install-compr.sh (formerly install-tl.sh):

  [...]
  $skip_systemstuff && echo "System updated successfully."  >&2
  if $have_system; then
    runsetup
    echo
    echo "Add $TEXDIR/texmf/doc/man to MANPATH." >&2
    echo "Add $TEXDIR/texmf/doc/info to INFOPATH." >&2
    echo "Most importantly, add $bindir" >&2
    echo "  to your PATH for current and future sessions." >&2
  [...]


Note that the installer knows where the files are and prints the
actual path.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I wrote additional.tex. I don't know what license should be
there -- please put there some that you consider
appropriate.

While I don't know the details of how this is used, I took a quick  
look at the content, and am concerned that it may not be correct.  
There are a number of entries such as

   \pdfglyphtounicode{twelveudash}{D80C}
   \pdfglyphtounicode{ringfitted}{D80D}
   \pdfglyphtounicode{interrobangdown}{D80B}

that seem to be mapping glyphs to values in the Unicode High  
Surrogate range. (About 15 or so altogether.)

These are not valid characters in themselves, and should never be  
used in isolation. The glyphs in question look as though they might  
not have standard Unicode values, so perhaps these should have been  
Private Use Area codes?

Can't you simply copy the directories containing your old and trusty
Lucida fonts to TeXLive's texmf-local?  You also have to copy the
entries in updmap.cfg.  This seems to be the easiest way.

Indeed, the x86_64-linux binaries had been created using AMD CPUs, not
Intel.  BTW., there is another table saying who created the binaries.

There is still

  Builders of the binaries:
  Tigran Aivazian (\pkgname{x86\_64-linux}), 

though they are actually created by Hartmut Henkel.

Hopefully Tigran does not get any complaints...

  Reinhard

Uh no.  It needs to be whatever the license of the original data
prescribes for derivations.  In the Open Source world, more often than
not the options for licensing derivatives are a superset as for
distributing the original (LPPL being one notable exception since it
disallows distributing derivatives with the same file names).  For the
GPL, the licensing options are basically the same (plus a few
restrictions, like startup messages on interactive programs).

It would be good to know the license of the original data, in any
case.

    the x86_64-linux binaries had been created using AMD CPUs.

It would be crazy to try to make that distinction.

    though they are actually created by Hartmut Henkel.

I thought you created them.

    Hopefully Tigran does not get any complaints...

That's why no email addresses are listed.

I'll add you and/or Hartmut at some point, but I don't think it's worth

dear Karl and Reinhard:---  first, thanks to both of you.

duh!  like the average village idiot, I just clicked on the link in the
html doc, which I believe is texmf-doc/doc/english/texlive-en/live.html
.  my guess is that this will be pretty common behavior.  I did not even
bother to check whether the files are on the live dvd itself, or to look
at a mirror.  my guess is that there will be more village idiots.  I
believe the links there all point to one particular web version, not to
local files or to mirrors.

(dumb question---I wonder whether the www.ctan.org should really just be
a redirect to a mirror.  of course, if ctan.org itself is down, that
won't work either.  gentoo has an interesting system, where an app first
locates the closest mirror, and its apps can then use it.  of course,
this is not going to work so easy with dumb html files, rather than with
smarter apps.)

Yes, Lucida is a special case.  People like me will have purchased this
exclusively for use with whatever tex will be.  The fonts don't even
work/test easily in other contexts.   I would drop a short note (one
liner) into live.html if it is not too late (i.e., where fonts are
discussed), perhaps with a link to an html file with the very short
description below.

so, here is what I would have found useful:

    * One does need to go to CTAN, because the lucida stuff is not fully
existing on the live dvd
       even after a full install.     (is it inconsistent that some
lucida files are already present,
       while others need to be downloaded?  can one be useful without
the other?)
    # cd /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/ ; unzip lucida.zip   # from ctan
         # this leaves me with a /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/lucida/
hierarchy
    # cp l*.pfb
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/type1/local/bh/lucida/  # from purchase
          # note the above is a hybrid path, reading the lucida install
file and noting that
          # lucida.zip creates
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/type1/local/
    # texhash
    # updmap

now create a file test.tex:

\documentclass{article}
% we have to change the font encoding for Lucida.
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{textcomp} % to get the right copyright, etc.
% use Lucida fonts for both text and math.
\usepackage[altbullet]{lucidabr}     % get larger bullet
\DeclareEncodingSubset{TS1}{hlh}{1}  % including \oldstylenums
\begin{document}
hello world
\end{document}

and do a $ pdflatex test.tex


Worked like a charm in my case.   Actually, if google picks up the
archives here, others may find the above.



Reinhard---$TEXPATH may be a leftover from old tetex distros
(potentially useful to check for old distributions, though it is
thankfully no longer user).  I also had a TEXMFLOCAL variable from my
previous distros.  Alas, I like the idea of just dropping texlive into
the path.  Thanks, guys!  This should make the future simpler for me.

I vaguely recall that tetex suggested one make a directory that mirrors
the /usr/share/texmf/ tree in /usr/local/share/texmf, which I thought
was a good solution, because it separated personal/local content from
what would be updated.  I bet that some users will move (not copy) their
personal files like fonts to /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local---and it
will be gone on the next texlive update.

As to TEX* variables, my philosophy would be that anything big that can
be checked and warned at install time is a good idea.  So, if a TeX*
variable should not be set, let's tell the user to delete it.  I am just
too concerned about the "mixed distribution" problem.  But I guess you
guys decided on this one for good reason.


Thanks again everyone.

Regards,

/ivo

Well, I wrote the email while the update was running, so I saw the

It certainly does not come from teTeX.

Do you talk about environment variables?  Why should anyone want to
define TEXMFLOCAL in the environment?

Please send us the output of

Ahh, not good night... texlivetest2007-inst-20070125.iso is broken!
Please do not download that!!! MakeImages.sh failed while excluding

Subject: [tex-live] [2007.0122] adding a texmf tree broken?
Message-ID: <1169705269.18006.25.camel@atlantis.mpeters.local>

Hi. I'm not positive I am doing things the correct way but this kind of
thing worked in teTeX (fc4/fc5) so I'm not sure why it isn't working
now.

The problem - I tried modifying texmf.cnf to add a new texmf tree.
Purpose of tree is a place to put updates to TeXLive that I don't want
in the version independent texmf-local (which I pretty much only use for
commercial fonts).

I installed the TeX Live 2007-0122 snapshot on Fedora Core 6.
It is the only TeX installed on the system. No teTeX or anything else.

I went through the bin directory with ldd to make sure all necessary
libraries are in fact on the system (had to add libXp and compat-libstdc
++-33)

After fixing issues of glossary.sty and subfigure.sty no longer working
with memoir, the project I am working on compiles fine. So the install
seems good.

Here's the layout:

/texlive (lv just for texlive)
/texlive/texmf-local (local texmf tree)
/texlive/2007.0122 (all the 2007 snapshot trees inside there)

The tree I tried to add is
/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-patch

I've attached my modified texmf.cnf file.
Here's the weird thing - kpsewhich definitely knows about the new tree:

[root at atlantis web2c]# kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFPATCH'
/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-patch

[root at atlantis web2c]# kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMF'
{/root/.texlive2007/texmf-config,/root/.texlive2007/texmf-var,/root/texmf,!!/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-config,!!/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-var,!!/texlive/2007.0122/texmf,!!/texlive/texmf-local,!!/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-patch,!!/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-dist}

[root at atlantis web2c]# kpsewhich -expand-var '$SYSTEXMF'
/texlive/texmf-local:/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-patch:/texlive/2007.0122/texmf:/texlive/2007.0122/texmf-dist

but the ls-R is not created when running texhash:

[root at atlantis web2c]# texhash
texhash: Updating /texlive/2007.0122/texmf/ls-R... 
texhash: Updating /texlive/2007.0122/texmf-config/ls-R... 
texhash: Updating /texlive/2007.0122/texmf-dist/ls-R... 
texhash: Updating /texlive/2007.0122/texmf-var/ls-R... 
texhash: Updating /texlive/texmf-local/ls-R... 
texhash: Done.

If I specify texhash /texlive/2007.0122/texmf-patch

it creates the ls-R file - and does so correctly, but any files in it
are not found by kpsewhich

Is there something else I need to do?
The thought behind the tree is a place to put errata and updates that I
don't want in texmf-local because I will be using the same texmf-local
with future TeXLive installs that may have updates to manually installed
updates ... so I want a tree in the version specific TeXLive directory
specifically for manually installed updates.

% (once) by kpathsea/Makefile (itself generated from kpathsea/Makefile.in
% by configure).
%
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% No % or @ in texmf.in, for the sake of autogeneration.
% (However, %'s and @'s can be edited into texmf.cnf or put in envvar values.)
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
%
% Earlier entries (in the same or another file) override later ones, and
% an environment variable foo overrides any texmf.cnf definition of foo.
%
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined.
%
% If a variable assignment is qualified with `.PROGRAM', it is ignored
% unless the current executable (last filename component of argv[0]) is
% named PROGRAM.  This foo.PROGRAM construct is not recognized on the
% right-hand side. For environment variables, use FOO_PROGRAM.
%
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the kpathsea documentation.
%
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% A leading/trailing/doubled ; in the paths will be expanded into the
%   compile-time default. Probably not what you want.
%
% You can use brace notation, for example: /usr/local/{mytex:othertex}
% expands to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  Instead of the path
% separator you can use a comma: /usr/local/{mytex,othertex} also expands
% to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  However, the use of the comma
% instead of the path separator is deprecated.
%
% The text above assumes thet path separator is a colon (:).  Non-UNIX
% systems use different path separators, like the semicolon (;).

%  Part 1: Search paths and directories.

% You can set an environment variable to override TEXMF if you're testing
% a new TeX tree, without changing anything else.
%
% You may wish to use one of the $SELFAUTO... variables here so TeX will
% find where to look dynamically.  See the manual and the definition
% below of TEXMFCNF.

% The tree containing the runtime files closely related to the specific
% program version used:
TEXMFMAIN = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf

% The main distribution tree:
TEXMFDIST = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-dist

% Patches to the main distribution tree:
TEXMFPATCH = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-patch

% A place for local additions to a "standard" texmf tree.
% This tree is not used for local configuration maintained by
% texconfig, it uses TEXMFCONFIG below.
TEXMFLOCAL=/texlive/texmf-local

% TEXMFSYSVAR, where texconfig-sys stores variable runtime data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFSYSVAR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var
TEXMFSYSVAR=$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var

% TEXMFSYSCONFIG, where texconfig-sys stores configuration data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-config
TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-config

% User texmf trees are allowed as follows.
% This used to be HOMETEXMF.
TEXMFHOME=$HOME/texmf

% TEXMFVAR, where texconfig stores variable runtime data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFVAR = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texmf-var  # teTeX 3.0 default
TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texlive2007/texmf-var

% TEXMFCONFIG, where texconfig stores configuration data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $HOME/.texmf-config  # teTeX 3.0 default
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-config
TEXMFCONFIG = $HOME/.texlive2007/texmf-config

% Now, list all the texmf trees. If you have multiple trees you can
% use shell brace notation, like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
% The braces are necessary.
%
% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFPATCH,!!$TEXMFDIST}

% The system trees.  These are the trees that are shared by all the users.
% If a tree appears in this list, the mktex* scripts will use
% VARTEXFONTS for generated files, if the original tree isn't writable;
% otherwise the current working directory is used.
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFPATCH;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST

% Where generated fonts may be written.  This tree is used when the sources
% were found in a system tree and either that tree wasn't writable, or the
% varfonts feature was enabled in MT_FEATURES in mktex.cnf.
VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
%
% By default, this is only the !! elements of TEXMF, so that mktexlsr
% does not create ls-R files in the non-!! elements -- because if an
% ls-R is present, it will be used, and the disk will not be searched.
% This is arguably a bug in kpathsea, but we will not think about it now.
% 
TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!TEXMFPATCH,!!$TEXMFDIST}

% It may be convenient to define TEXMF like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,$HOME}
% which allows users to set up entire texmf trees, and tells TeX to
% look in places like ~/tex and ~/bibtex.  If you do this, define TEXMFDBS
% like this:
%   TEXMFDBS = $TEXMFHOME;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$VARTEXFONTS
% or mktexlsr will generate an ls-R file for $HOME when called, which is
% rarely desirable.  If you do this you'll want to define SYSTEXMF like
% this:
%   SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST
% so that fonts from a user's tree won't escape into the global trees.
%
% On some systems, there will be a system tree which contains all the font
% files that may be created as well as the formats.  For example
%   TEXMFVAR = /var/lib/texmf
% is used on many Linux systems.  In this case, set VARTEXFONTS like this
% VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts
% and do not mention it in TEXMFDBS (but _do_ mention TEXMFVAR).
%
% Remove $VARTEXFONTS from TEXMFDBS if the VARTEXFONTS directory is below
% one of the TEXMF directories (avoids overlapping ls-R files).

Oh, people do that all the time.  Every couple of months, we've got a
bug in the Debian BTS saying "after updating teTeX from $ancient_version
to $still_ancient_version_but_newest_in_a_certain_Debian_release latex
stopped working completely, you idiots", and it turns out that people
have funny settings of environment variables called TEXMF, TEXINPUTS,
TEXMFwhoknowswhat, either excluding important trees or adding trees with
outdated pool files, even more ancient local installations of LaTeX,
etc. 

It always never had made any sense even when the variable was set on
that system.

Message-ID: <6faad9f00701250525x3520a120o8587e789c0bce934@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I tried to use TeXLive DVD and run it "Live" from DVD on Windows, but
it failed during "setup":

can't read "gsanswer": no such variable
can't read "gsanswer": no such variable
    while executing
"source $filewinpostinstall"

state !pressed; .f.nb.frm0.f.f2.b invoke } "
    (command bound to event)


So I tried to install it then, but when I tried to choose the "ConTeX
scheme", it appeared to be empty. I don't know about the rest, but at
least context, metapost and xetex should be added to that scheme by
default.

XeTeX and ConTeXt seem to work seamlessly once the two packages are
installed, which makes me happy ;)


The first problem described above is critical, the second one should
be nicec to resolve, but here are some additional comments that would
be nice to have, but are not urgent - if they would be added next
year, it would still be OK:
- here is no information about which packages are installed already
- search for packages is not working (whatever I type in "search"
field, I always get all the packages listed)

So much for now ... (sorry for not testing it before)

Last night I downloaded and burnt the TexLive 2007 DVD. Everything looks
very nice, but upon trying to choose the [Run From DVD] tab and clicking
on the [Set] button in the [Set Environment] option, I received the
following error message:

I am running on an IBM thinkpad T42, Windows XP sp2.

I hope this helps.

Message-ID: <490016.49810.qm@web55602.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

Hello, 
I am not sure if this is a known problem, but I thought I might mention it.
I am trying to use TeXLive as part of a DVD for a WindowsXP lab in which 
we do not have admin access. Using the texlivetest2007-live-20070122.iso
I get the following error when trying to set up to run from DVD:

can't read "gsanswer": no such variable

    while executing
"source $filewinpostinstall"
    invoked from within

    (command bound to event)

I got other errors when I replaced the setuptl directory with yesterday's svn version on my customized DVD but did not post until I was able to reproduce a problem on a disk burned from the unaltered image today. Ghostscript is not installed. I was able to use an image from earlier this month well enough with environment variables set in emacs startup files. I am not sure if this is related,
but when I try 
$ latex test.tex
from DOS, I get 
mkdir error
mkdir failed.
I can't find the format file 'latex.fmt'!
I have set TEXMFTEMP to a writable directory on a network volume where I also
issued to command on the test file. 

Thank you all for your valuable work. I am not a Windows user and am not eager to become one, but I hope my report is of help, if it is correct.

Yes, that's what I meant.  Just "x86 64-bit GNU/Linux".

Hartmut tested the test-image last week and found out that some of the
binaries I compiled did not work for him.  The reason is that I'm
using Xorg which needs libXau.so and Hartmut runs XFree which does not
have this library.

There had been a little discussion between Hartmut, Norbert, and me.  I
tested binaries compiled by Hartmut here and they seem to work without
any problems.  We also thought that it's better to compile them on
Debian/stable because all libraries there are much older than on my
Gentoo system.  Norbert uploaded Hartmut's binaries last Monday.

  New binaries for x86_64, build on Debian/sarge, from Hartmut Henkel

I'm very glad that Hartmut tested it.

It can't hurt if other x86_64-linux users try more recent images.
People who do not want to download the live image can just install the
CD and extract http://ms25.ath.cx/x86_64-linux.tar.bz2 (11.5 MB) in the bin
directory (or better use rsync to download the files from the TUG
server, which will be significantly faster).

Ivo,

    May I suggest that install-tl.sh (or its equivalent) check whether there
    is an existing tex application somewhere first?  

I think that would be a good idea, and it would give us a chance to
explain some of the facts about "native" TL installation.  I'll put it
on the list for next time.

    the install could ask the user whether texlive install

The only thing the TL installer can do is abort.  There's no feasible
way it can delete installations, which could require running OS
packaging commands, etc.  Besides being way too dangerous just on
principle.

    there exist tex packages that are being superseded by newer versions

An "updatable" TL has been discussed at monumental length.  Perhaps we
will make progress on it some day.  Meanwhile, those using Debian and
other OS-level packaging systems already have it.

This year's shell script installation is essentially unchanged from the
way it's always been.  There are plenty of deficiencies with it, and
I hope someday there will be enough time and energy to improve it.

Thanks,
karl

You have just essentially recapitulated the Lucida instructions.  This
has nothing to do with TL ...

    is it inconsistent that some lucida files are already present, while
    others need to be downloaded?  can one be useful without the other?)

No, it's not useful.  The only reason that any Lucida files remain in TL
is that they are part of psnfssx, and I did not care to "partially"
include a package.  My ideal would be for them to be removed from
psnfssx as well, but I have not had a chance to discuss it with the
relevant people.

Sorry for the late response.  I wrote a little script some time ago
which extracts fonts from PDF files and disassembles them.  It is
required that you have pdftops (part if xpdf) and the t1utils
installed.

It simply converts PDF files to PostScript and runs t1disasm on each
font.

If you run "xtractfonts foo.pdf" you'll get a directory called
"FONTS_foo.pdf" which contains the fonts as .pfa and .src files.
You might be only interested in the .src files.

However, I wrote this script for myself and you probably are not able
to extract some fonts because the regular expression which is supposed
to match /FontName does not support everey character which is allowed
in /FontName yet.

xtractfonts can be downloaded from:

     http://ms25.ath.cx/xtractfonts

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Problem installing TeXLive2005 on Windows XP Pro
Message-ID: <loom.20070125T230835-171@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

I'm using a computer running windows XP Professional and recently I had a
problem with windows which obliged me to do a repair with the installation DVd
of Windows.

After that a few programs did'nt run  well and among those was TeXLive2005.
So I decided to uninstall it and reinstall it.
I inserted the dvd and ran tlpmgui.
After selecting the configuration I wanted and the directory where I wanted it
to be installed (D:\TeXLive2005 I started the process but noticed after a while
that it seemed to be copying nothing and I got the following error message:

error copying "D:/TeXLive2005/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf": no such file or directory
error copying "D:/TeXLive2005/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf": no such file or directory
    while executing
"source $filewininstall"
    invoked from within
"if [file exist [file join [file dirname $sourcedir] tlpm.exe]] then {
	source $filewininstall
    } else {
	tk_messageBox -title [mc "Error"] -icon er..."
    invoked from within
".f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 invoke "
    invoked from within
".f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 instate {pressed !disabled} { .f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 state
!pressed; .f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 invoke } "
    (command bound to event)


I know this is a windows problem and it is obviously related to something
missing or wrong in my windows.

I would like to know if anyone has any idea of what is going on and what I can
do to fix it (I'd like to avoid having to do aclean reinstall but i will do it
if it's the only way!!).


Thank you very much in advance.

I consider this a showstopper, as DANTE is the largest "customer". And
Lehmanns really sells the thing.

    It is really pity, but we will end up without TeX Live documentation 
    updated for German. What to do? To zap the old version or wait for Volker
    or somebody else? Ahhh...

- As far as I know, the German documentation *was* updated, by Hartmut
  et al., with the updates I made, before you started making your
  inevitable series of last minute tweaks.

- Forgive me, but I do not consider any of your last-minute changes
  absolute necessities.

- I told Hartmut, Norbert, and Klaus about your updates more than once
  over the last days, and they did not have time to update the German
  translation. 

- Volker is away for some time yet, and had no time to do anything with
  the translation even before he left, so I don't advise waiting for him.

- I just changed the year in texlive-ge/live.tex to 2007, and fixed
  other trivial TeX errors, and remade the German pdf/html.

- Now I am remaking the images.  I will be around for a few more hours,
  but no more (until next Wednesday).  So someone else will have to make
  the final images if it's after that.

- It's not up to me.  Wait as long you all want to wait.

Good luck,
Karl

P.S. Norbert, sorry, I do not have the diff at hand.  But if you go to
the texlive-en/live.tex in the online svn, you can select the current
version and the last version I checked in in December for a diff.  I
believe that is what is needed.  There was a hiatus before Staszek started
making his changes, and you guys updated the translation at that point.

Karl, I'm very sorry if I got you iritated but what I saw 1 hour ago
in texmf-doc/doc/german/texlive-ge/ was dated Dec 29 2005 (!)

OK, again sorry for my last-minute changes.

Many thanks for doing that. It seems that it was not generated before my

Hmm, this was NOT very helpful! I know how to use svn diff --help, but I
DON'T know what has already been checked in into the german
translation!!! The last changes I made were for sure superseeded by
someone else, but what was the last thing, ie the first revision from
which changes to the english version are not carried over?

Yes, I saw that too, and I'm glad you noticed.  I believe what happened
is that Norbert (Hartmut? sorry, can't remember) made changes to the
source, but no one ever generated new german html/pdf.  That's what I
did just now (and updated the date in the title to 2007).

    It seems that it was not generated before my unfortunate mail :)

You are right, and I did it because of your mail, so it wasn't
unfortunate.  I'm sorry for coming across as being irritated.

Anyway, for everyone's info, the new build is almost done ...

I tried to translate the latest changes, and fixed some spelling, and
recreated pdf/html/css stuff.

BUT: I recreated it with my TL2005 installation, so it might be that the
html code is not optimal. If someone want (KARL?) please recreate it
with current stuff. Thanks.

There are several sources of this problem. Quick advice:
* Download fresh tlpmgui from 
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui/TL2005 (whole directory)
or
* Download latest iso teX Live 2007 from: 
ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/Images/test

hi reinhard---apparently, the installation was less successful than I
thought.  It plainly did not work (my doc apparently received CM fonts),
even though I think I erased everything that existed before (all linux
env variables), deleted all tex files, local and otherwise, redid the
texlive installation, and tried to follow the lucida installation
instructions religiously.  I believed them to be:

 # cd /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/ ; unzip lucida.zip   # from ctan
    # this leaves me with a /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/lucida/ hierarchy
 # cp l*.pfb /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/type1/local/bh/lucida/  # from purchase
    # note the above is a hybrid path, reading the lucida install file and noting that
    # lucida.zip creates /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/type1/local/
 # texhash
 # updmap

(I also dropped a note in the lucida tug email group with the
details.)   In looking over your old responses to me, you note "You also
have to copy the entries in updmap.cfg".   Could you tell me how/where,
please?  Maybe this is the problem, because this is *not* what I did.

Any help or pointers how to fix this would be highly appreciated.  Sorry
to take everyone's time, but I presume I won't be the only one, and if
this goes into the google history, it will help others.

This is *not* your or even TeX's fault, but font installation is not an
easy subject.  I wish all I had to say was "sh install-lucida" and it
would all be done (like sh install-tl".

Regards,

/ivo

I suppose that if you buy the fonts from TUG they are easier to
install.  I still don't understand why Y&Y asked Thomas Esser to
create all the auxiliary files needed by TeX but did not put them into
their own distribution.

After you installed Walter Schmidt's lucida.zip package properly you
have to run

     updmap-sys --enable Map=lucida.map

If this doesn't solve your problem it's necessary that you send us
the error messages you get.

This is a known problem (bug #408541). I think Frank is working on it.

Note that this problem has not much to do with TeX Live (read: nothing,
except that the texlive packages depend on tex-common).

First, let me say that I very much appreciate your help.  I feel like I
am searching in the dark.


Is the following a bug or feature: updmap does not seem to search in the
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/ hierarchy.  That is, I learned I could do
    # updmap --edit
and added
    Map lucida.map
but when I run updmap, I get an error that this map file is not found. 
In fact, updmap never looks into the local hierarchy.  When I link the
lucida.map file from the lucida distribution into the
/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/lucida.map, updmap
completes correctly, and I can see that it grokked the lucida.map file. 
Good.  Following Reinhard, I enabled the Map, though I think it had
already gotten the idea that I had a lucida.map file.


I also followed Karl's suggestion and moved the fonts up. 


Now,
# kpsewhich lbmo.pfb
/usr/local/texlive/2007/../texmf-local/fonts/type1/bh/lucida/lbmo.pfb

I reran texhash, and for good measure, a few more updmap's and
texhash's.  :-).


Thanks, Karl, also for the next suggestion, which was to check that my
fonts are in psfonts.map.  They are:

I did an strace on pdflatex, and saw that it never looks for .pfb and

I am just about ready to hardcode font file locations into the

To add my own viewpoint to Karl's comments, there are things that need
to be done to improve the chances that we will have good linux
packages maintained by vendors, and things aimed at minimizing the
divergence between WinNN and linux/unix/OS X.  Linux and some unix
users who have never heard of TeX, or those who have had bad
experiences with it in the past and swear they won't touch it ever
again end up getting it thru package dependencies, and even running it
without realizing when rebuilding or installing packages.

Except for the people who just did a default linux install and
probably didn't know what TeX is, or had to install it for some
package dependency, most users who use it will know if TeX is already
present.  The big issue is that many users are very nervous about
changing TeX.  They had a big battle getting the last install to work,
aren't comfortable with admin tasks, and have a multi-year project
like a book and have been writing papers using the template they got
from their advisor in grad school.  Many of these people started in an
environment where TeX was installed by the local guru, so never had to
worry about texmf trees until linux became popular.  They have
deadlines to meet and can't afford to spend time figuring out why
their document gives errors with a new version of TL.

Users have often updated macros that will be older than those in
TL2007.  You can't predict where these will have been installed --
some user overwrite portions of the main texmf tree, some use
$HOME/texmf and some use a texmf-local tree.  To sort out problems it
is useful to be able to run the old and new systems side-by-side until
the new one has been beaten into accepting the user's documents.

This is quite feasible with the single tree model of real tetex and
texlive, but problematic with package managers.  I know people who
buy a new machine when they need to upgrade TeX.  It is now quite
practical to us a virtual machines to do this, but the people who need
it don't have the admin skills to clone their old environment into a
VM where it can be preserved, so it may still be more practical to buy
new hardware every couple years.

The MikTeX package manager is useful in a mixed Win32+MikTeX and
*n*x+TL environment.  MPM can be used to manage a texmf-miktex tree
for MikTeX versions of packages that need to be updated for
consistency with MikTeX (which tends to be conservative about versions
of the programs but tracks CTAN package updates).

My impression is that TL has very limited acceptance on Win32.
It is used by people who need WIn32 but are more often found using
*n*x and want to have the same texmf tree on both platforms.

Would if be feasible to translate between tl and mpm packing so
tlpmgui could be used to apply miktex updates?

Time and energy has gone into tlpmgui.  It needs lots of testing to
work out the glitches, but without updated packages it will suffer
from only being run once each 1.X years to install a new TL.   Maybe
people use it when they discover they need a package they didn't
install first time around, but it is pretty simple to just unzip and
run mktexlsr (and a user without root privileges can add things to a
texmf tree they control -- can tlpmgui do that?).

Time and energy has to go to making sure that TL works well (in
particular, TL shouldn't break existing packages that use TeX) so
users and ultimately vendors will see it as the successor to tetex and
adopt it as the basis for their distribution packages.  Since vendors
are going to package TL by their own rules, they will ignore any TL
provided installer.  The debian packaging helps a lot because many
developers in large projects (e.g., R, the S+ clone) that use TeX for
documentation are using debian and because it shows how the
single-tree model can be adapted to packaging.  If texlive displaces
tetex on debian, commercial vendors will (eventually) follow.  So time
and energy needs to go to making the debian packaging work well, even
to the point of including debian-specifics (texmf.cnf management) into
TL.

The shell script installation is adequate for admins who need to
create a multi-platform texlive tree that can be shared across a
heterogenous network of workstations via a file server or rsynced onto
local disks.
Many sites will want to build shared-library versions (so they don't
have to rebuild every time a library has a security issue).  The
configure scripts, source tree, and cross-platform scripts are a key
part of making texlive a viable option for use in centrally
administered sites and linux distributions.

Security perceptions (in particular, using the "right" libraries and
interfaces so automated tools don't raise alarms) and better support
for the full range of languages (including translations of the
documentation and searchable pdf's) are important for wide adoption.

Thank you, Petr.

This does mean that (pdf)TeX did not found hlcrima.tfm (_metrics_!)
and tries to generate it (but fails, as there is no mf source to
generate from).

Yes, it failed already on .tfm.  What does 
kpsewhich hlcrima.tfm says?

#

Aha---this seems to be where the problem lies.  kpsewhich does not go down the texmf-local path by default.


# export TEXMFLOCAL='{/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/}'
# kpsewhich hlcrima.tfm
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/lucida/fonts/tfm/bh/lucida/hlcrima.tfm


and now everything seems to work.  Can I highly recommend that /usr/local/texmf-local/ *by default* become part of the path that kpsewhich pursues (first-best), or that the docs highly recommend that the user set it (second-best!)?


Everyone---thanks a lot for helping me make this work.  Hopefully this also helps the TL dist become better by adding this as default.

Hi all!

Before Karl left he mentioned three updates which would be nice (in
decreasing importance), or better which should be included:
- tlpmgui
- hyperref
- ntheorem

I have done the following:
- checked in the three changes
- rebuild the whole tl stuff (rebuild_tl, ie tpm files, lists, ls-R)
- made new images

So, new images are now available at the usual place, i.e. these file:
	texlivetest2007-inst-20070128.iso
	texlivetest2007-inst-20070128.iso.md5
	texlivetest2007-live-20070128.iso
	texlivetest2007-live-20070128.iso.bz2
	texlivetest2007-live-20070128.iso.bz2.md5
	texlivetest2007-live-20070128.iso.md5

BIG NOTE BIG NOTE BIG NOTE:
I HAVE NOT(!!!!) updated the links
	texlivetest-inst.iso@
	texlivetest-inst.iso.md5@
	texlivetest-live.iso@
	texlivetest-live.iso.bz2@
	texlivetest-live.iso.bz2.md5@
	texlivetest-live.iso.md5@
asI consider myself NOT enough authorized to do the whole stuff, this is
up to Karl.

Anyway, PLEASE TEST ... there have been no big changes, but the update
of the tlpmgui stuff hoefully fix the problems we have seen recently on
the list.

I will be offline starting from a few hours, and more or less till
Wednesday noon CET. It might be that I have an Internet connection, but
this is not guaranteed!

Best wishes

Norbert

AFAIR this will be done end of january, so a few more days left.
BUT: Karl is away, and I too will leave for  three days.
BUT: YES: updates to translations etc do make sense. In case it is too
late, well we have it for next year. In case we can build new images it
is in.

But please: no new files, no rearrangements etc.

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

Yes, except that it's not a "problem" in the sense that anything related
to TeX might change.  It's just a minor inconvenience when using new
features of Debian's tools for debugging installation problems, should
any occur.

Message-ID: <68c491a60701280707h18a727c9y8b3bf7f416c56104@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I've just downloaded the last snapshot and got my first impression of tlpmgui.

It's quite a nice thing, probably quite useful for the non-expert.

But: For the expert, it's much too silent:
- There is no option to set TLroot; it just silently overwrote my old
TeX installation (I had a fresh backup, so no worries) and it never
told me this
- The (german) help you get by pressing "help" is outdated: I see no
options for system, directories and options.

Sorry for the late testing.

Best

$ man 5 updmap.cfg

       MixedMap
       Similar  to  Map.  It  should  be used when there is Type1 and a bitmap
       implementation of the font (the latter mostly  coming  from  MetaFont).
       These  entries  will  not  be used in the default map of dvips if dvip-
       sPreferOutline is set to false.
       Usage: MixedMap filename.map

  Reinhard

Hi,
when I use ConTeXt on TL2007, I get these warnings:

I like my /tmp to be world writable! :-)

Is this a ruby thing?

It's documented in updmap.cfg(5):

,----
|  MixedMap
|        Similar to Map. It should be used when there is Type1 and a
|        bitmap implementation of the font (the latter mostly coming

`----

If you use MixedMap, you can switch from using Type1 fonts to PK fonts,
either with "updmap --setoption dvipsPreverOutline=false", or by calling
dvips with "-u psfonts_pk" (I think).  This might make sense if PK fonts
give better output on a particular printer.

many thanks! Should have looked there first.

(So it could be done in principle similarly with pdftex, but who would
want bitmap fonts in PDF if there are outlines.)

Then please take the images I created tonight, the one versioned 070128.
Note that the links without dates in the names are still pointing to the
old one.

In the next days I (and hopefully others) will do some final tests, but
the changes Imade wrt the last images are quite small.

Yes, I think that ruby is complaining about that (ConTeXt ruby scripts
don't include that warning). The same thing happens if you mount
windows the partition for example: simply ignore.

this warning was introduced some time ago in ruby and unfortunately the message cannot not be disabled (or maybe it can by now)

I'm just downloading the images and if there will be new images

One question: Should the binary builders create new binaries then?

Sorry. Since you didn't close the bug, I thought there was something to
do on the tex-common side. But maybe you let it open to avoid having
users repeatedly report the same bug...

I think that we can consider them frozen, so only any urgent change in 
docs or setup can cause rebuilding the iso images.

We plan to be ready for production by around 10th of February, i. e. for
sending the stuff to the factory.

I told Karl I would like to have the final images by today because this
year we will have a really full double layer TeXCollection DVD and it
seems I have to omit some stuff to make it fit.Then we will have to
test the TeXCollection before going to production.

However, if there are some more fixes to incorporate I am usually
flexible to take late minute changes. I'm used to this. :-)

Run from DVD appears to work on Windows XP after I set
the variable TMP to %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp.

I had that user settable variable pointing to a directory that did not
exist on some of the computers to which I logged in. The error message,
reasonably enough, was 
"no such file or directory"

However, simply creating that directory was not enough to avoid the error.
Deleting the TMP variable caused the DVD to silently fail to open. In all cases,
tlmpgui became unresponsive and the installation apparently did not complete.

Editing the variable suggested the default (perhaps the expected Windows
place for tmp?), which worked. 

If this is in the documentation, I am sorry that I could not find it. If it 
had not occurred to people that someone on Windows might break this,
I hope this report helps.

On a more minor note, if one is running the installation in a
standard 25x80 terminal, one cannot see the first few lines of

Thank you all for your work on this distribution.  I am looking
forward eagerly to its release.

I thought /I/ was a dinosaur, but even I can't remember the
last time I saw (or used) a 25 x 80 terminal !

I thought about this too when I used the installer last weekend.  But
finally I came the same conclusion as Phil Taylor.  I havn't seen a
terminal which was restricted to 25 lines for more than a decade.

In TL-2005 there had been three columns and it seems that people had
25x80 terminals in mind.  But with three columns everything had been
truncated too much, and you had to guess what the packages contain.

In my opinion the two-column menu is much better.  Since about half of
the packages in this menu provide documentation, it might be useful to
move documentation to an extra menu.  I planned to look into it for
this release but never had enough time.  Maybe next year.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I spoke to one of the administrators today, and he showed me that 
my TMP variable was set correctly. I would thus have to consider
this a bug in tlpmlgui.

The problem was fixed by deleting TEMP, which pointed to the same directory as TMP. I am not sure if the installation would eventually complete despite the error. If this information does not help someone who knows the inner working of tlpmgui find the cause of the problem, I will try to add more information at the end of the week.

Is a VT100 emulation something difficult to implement?  I've seen this
thing in Marrakech.  This little thing provides everything you need:
pdftex, a pdf-viewer, ssh, bash, X11, ...  Quite impressive.

And the xterm it provides is most likely the same xterm I'm using at
home.

Phil, all the things we laughed about when we watched "Starship
Enterprise" in TV in the 70es are reality now.  Many mobile phones are
much smaller today than those they had at this time and many of them
support voice processing (i.e. instead of dialing a number you can
simply say "Captain Kirk" and you'll be connected with him).

All this science-fiction stuff is reality already.  

BTW., many years ago IBM built a wrist watch which contained a
complete Linux system plus X11.  It certainly had been the most
expensive computer in the world.  But it had been proven that you can
put a (more or less) complete Linux system into a wrist watch.  And
this happened many years ago.

Today, I guess, much more is possible and VT100 emulation should
not be a problem at all.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Very strange, because we have Uulsy.fd and it is well registered in tpm 
and lists files. Have you checked "inst" or "live" disk if Uulsy.fd exists

Oops; my mistake. I do see it in the 2007/01/28 "live" prerelease (although I
didn't see it in my 2005/11/02 installation).

I exaggerated a bit.  Of course, we cannot be faster than speed of
light.  There are some theories but none of them had been proven yet.

On the other hand, someone held a talk about a proposed mobile phone
system at the university in the mid 80es.  What he proposed had been a
device which is as large as a one-liter-Coca-Cola bottle.  A great
advantage though, all mobile phones at this time had been as large as
a small suitcase (a bit smaller than a printed version of the Emacs
programming manual) and had been installed in the rear trunk of a car.
Only a relatively small operating unit had been installed in the cockpit.

What he proposed had been very reasonable.  But what I didn't
understand at this time is how to shrink a battery to be able to
power such a device *and* to fit into a one-liter-Coca-Cola bottle.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <c8b321820701310120s6feb311an156827e664289a53@mail.gmail.com>

I have tried to install TL2007 (070128 build) on a Win32 Box (WinXP SP2).
When starting tlpmgui from the CD the program always starts in
maintenance mode claiming there is a TL installation with root dir
"D:\programs". Same error when using the current tlpm from
ftp://ftp.gust.org.pl/pub/Projekty/tlpmgui.

There was a former TL2005 installation on this box, but it was cleanly
uninstalled before starting the TL2007 installation. (No TL-specific
files or environment variables left.)

Setting "TLroot" to the TL2007 root dir wanted does not help.

What else can I do to _force_ tplmgui starting in install mode?

I did download TeXLive2007 iso and tried to install it.

I get this message

Erreur: could not read "D:/TeXLive2007/bin/win32/mktexpk.exe":

directory

{ .f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 state
!pressed; .f.nb.frm1.f24.b2 invoke } "
    (command bound to event)

which is essentially the same problem I had with TeXLive2005.

I should emphasize that I know this is not a problem with TeXLive 
but it's
related to a problem with my installation of Windows XP.

What I'm trying to avoid is having to reinstall Windows on my 
computer so it
would be  very nice if the problem could be identified and a 
way around suggested.

Of course if  that's impossible I will end up reinstalling Windows.

Thanks in advance

Again, sorry for being off topic but it seems to me this is 
the place where
people are aware of the ressources from  Windows XP that 
are used during
installation.

1. TLRoot not set
2. no tex found in PATH
Please check if you have really cleanly unistalled: open cmd and run

Of course it is not in the 2005/11/02, it was missing. After I got the

Subject: [tex-live] ifxetex package missing from collection-xetex
Message-ID: <2BD2640D-9972-4CC4-AB90-256DC27B3202@sil.org>

I guess it's way too late to rebuild anything at this point?

Having at last had a chance to download an .iso test image and  
install a "typical" scheme (usually, I just run from a subversion  
checkout), I found that the ifxetex package was not included,  
although xetex and various associated packages were present. This  
leads to a failure with packages such as fontspec, which use  
ifxetex.sty to check the engine.

I suppose the "correct" thing to do would be to define ifxetex as a  
dependency of fontspec, xltxtra, and any other packages that require  
it; but a simpler workaround would be to add ifxetex explicitly to  
collection-xetex. If there will be another rebuild of the packages  
for any reason, I'd like to see this fixed.

Yeah, it was corrected by me just after your built...

I'd propose adding also ifxetex as Jonathan asked And I forgot to include
xetex into gust-scheme:-). Will do both above anyway, so Karl can decide
to build another iso. As Manfred told, the image will go to mastering 
10 February.

ifxetex is currently in
	collection-genericrecommended.tpm
do you think it is better to put it into collection-xetex?

I can do this for now ... no problem.

untouched yes. frozen, not necessarily. If there is an update for an

cases.

Do you have any intentions?

right. It's only, i found a silly typo/bug (own one) that prevents
robust use of \pdfmapfile{= ...} as it generates segfaults in certain
cases, would need a microscopic change. We can live without but i
could---if allowed---as well check it into the sources, and generate and
upload a fresh pdftex x86_64 bin. Maybe then instead of compiling all
systems to have just a fresh i386 would be a doable compromise?

Uh, does this even make sense?  The ifxetex package will be used when
it is _not_ clear whether or not something is compiled using xetex.
So it should not be in xetex-specific search paths, and it does not
really make sense to only install it when indeed xetex is installed.

Damned. 

Well segfault is not funny, but building everything is not funny, too.

This is more than I can and want to decide. Karl should speak up. 

I would say that it is quite late, but we could get binaries for
i386, x86_64, alpha_linux. The rest I don't know.

I'm not positive - but it looks like while the Utopia pfb files are now
included with the clarified license, utopia.map is not enabled. Is that
intentional? I didn't try to do anything that used utopia but the map
wasn't in the list of maps as either enabled or disabled until I
specifically added it. If the fonts are pointed to in another map file
or if intentionally not enabled, then sorry about the noise - but if it
is intended to be enabled, it doesn't seem to be.

This was with 0128 inst image.

I see the point, but what would be the correct place? We have ifpdf.sty
in collection-latexrecommended which is also bad in the sense that it
can be used in generic tex documents as well.

I thought that it might make sense in:
- collection-xetex
	because it is only used there
- collection-base
	because it can be used in all the packages to check it

Maybe in fact both ifpdf.sty and ifxetex.sty should be moved to
collection-base ...

Jonathan, what is your opinion? As main xetex guru I guess you shoud
speak up for now?!

Hmm. Fair point. But col-genericrecommended was apparently not being  
included in most schemes, including the default "medium". OTOH, col- 
xetex is included; and it in turn includes packages such as fontspec  
that call for ifxetex. I'll hazard a guess that there are not yet  
many (or any) files outside of the xetex-related packages that  
require ifxetex, though this may change over time.

Maybe ifxetex should be somewhere "more basic", to be really safe; I  
don't know. But for right now, I think the main requirement is that  
it is included alongside the xetex-related packages (in col-xetex)  
that use it.

Yes, given that they can be used in both latex and "generic" jobs (I  
believe), col-base would make the most sense, IMO.

Can you please specify what you mean? (Sorry, Karl would know better,
but he is away).

Do we have to update the .pfb files? Or the .afm files, or both, or all?

What about the .vf/.tfm etc files all form utopia.tpm.

The non enabled stuff I can fix  ....

Message-ID: <200701311718.26578@KOMA020467>

I've downloaded current state of TeX-Live using 

	sync -avz --exclude=.svn tug.org::tldevsrc . 

and found that the html files at the catalogue at TeX Live are not in sync 
with the packages of TeX Live, e.g. 
Master/texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue/entries/koma-script.html says 
"Version: 2.9t" but KOMA-Script at Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/koma-script is 
version 2.95a (BTW: current release of KOMA-Script ist 2.96).

Most tpm files have an empty TPM:Version, so the catalogue seams to be the 
only part, that shows a version information. Shouldn't this be the version 
that TeX Live uses or at least an up to date version of 
texcatalogue.sarovar.org?

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

There are many things here:
- texlive packages are pulled from CTAN, that's it
- catalogue is pulled from sarovar (I am not sure about this, but I
  assume)
- catalogue is not always up to date, neither at sarovar nor at tl
- tpm files in principle could have a version number in it, but in needs
  a bit of magic playing to get the version number from the catalogue
  into the tpm files. I had it working, and have it working in different
  circumstances (automatic generation of the license file for Debian)
  but the changes to TL Tpm.pm didn' make it.

ANyway, for this year it is too late. And for next year we are planning
a bit a restructuring of the tpm stuff to make it easier to deal with
them.

istm that the current release (in terms of ctan, which is where tex-live
gets its stuff from) is 2.95b

i may be misunderstanding something, but i see nothing on the tree
seeming later than that.

I'll provide OpenBSD.

Btw: A new version of freetype2 with some bugfixes has just been
released. Jonathan?

My idea is to make a new version of pdftex (1.40.2) today and commit
it to TL. Since the images don't seem to be finished anyway, we can
then get new binaries for at least some plattforms.

So I see. If I have some time tomorrow, maybe I can try it and see if  
the build goes smoothly. But I don't think it's critical to update at  
this point.

I'm not sure it's a good idea to mix versions; if binaries won't be  
rebuilt for all 15 platforms, maybe it is better to keep them as-is.  
Consistency is worth something.

I agree with this. Better to put *AFTER* the release updated binaries of
pdftex 1.40.2 for all platforms on the web.

Hi all!

Strange enough I cannot submit stuff from the tug.org server ...

If someone knows around svn and is usig a tug.org account can tell me:
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Can't create directory
'/home/svn/texlive/db/transactions/3838-1.txn': Permission denied

what this means?

My .svn/entries lists
...
   url="file:///home/svn/texlive/trunk/Master"
...
and I COULD submit recently before building the last image, but now it
is broken ...

Hi Norbert,
I suppose that nothing had been changed for a long time and Karl
changed the copyright message in the .pfb files only.

The only thing which seem to be missing is the entry "Map utopia.map"
in Master/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg.

This is a bit unfortunate because some other packages provide math
support for Utopia (mathdesign and fourier).

  Reinhard

yes, thanks, sure. Just checked that the pool file is the same (and
change was only in C code). You can try it out now.
