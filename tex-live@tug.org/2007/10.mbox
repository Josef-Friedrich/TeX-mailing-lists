    hi taco/karl---did this patch make it into the official texlive
    distribution by now?

Apparently I committed the change in June 2006, so it would have been
included in the TL 2007 release.  I can't say I explicitly tried it.

    Second question---perltex currently is incredibly slow because it is
    constantly polling for the appearance of files.  

The perltex author (Scott Pakin) just made another release of perltex,
so it seems he is still maintaining the package.  I suggest
communicating with him directly about avoiding the polling ...

Best,
Karl

Dear all!

On the Ubuntu side one user mentioned that the vlna is not present. And
this is true, it is only present for arch=win32.

Is there a reason for this? I cannot understand the documentation at
all, but the user told me that it should be necessary on all platforms
(see below).

Any comments?

Thanks a lot and all the best

This is an auxilliary program for inserting nonbreakable spaces after
nonsyllabic prepositions which is a requirement of Czech and Slovak
orthography (so this is not only typographical issue but also an
orthographical rule which every kid is taught at school). Thus "v
lese" should be written in TeX as "v~lese". Since such prepositions
are frequent in Czech and Slovak. An auxilliary program vlna was
developed to add nonbreakable spaces. Of course this replacement
should not happen in math and verbatim and vlna tries to cope with
that. It is thus needed for all formats (plain TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt)
and on oll platforms.

There is another possible solution. Petr Olsak implemented (almost)
the same functionality in encTeX in file vlna.tex. The advantage is
that it recognizes verbatim by \catcode and math by \ifmmode so that
it can safely recognize user defined environments. Petr Olsak's
vlna.tex has problems in LaTeX in moving arguments, \chapter{V lese}
would cause a fatal error during the second and subsequent runs. There
is also a conflict with the microtype package. These problems are
solved in my vlna.sty which I have recently published on my site
http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/tex/

So this is a reliable solution for those who are not afraid of enabling encTeX.

Of course, the functionality could also be implemented in LUA.

Later. I found that Petr Olsak's vlna.tex is not on CTAN so it would
be good to put it there too. And it is necessary to document it a
little, mainly to note how to enable encTeX in fmtutil.cnf.

Subject: [tex-live] ctan2tds.pl stuff
Message-ID: <20071002090857.GB27734@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi Karl!

I have made some fixes to ctan2tds.pl: The $Foundry wasn't set in
&runfonts; which made the fonts ae fonts installed into a missing
"public". I hope this didn't break anything.

Then I adjusted it to bbm/bbm-macros splitting. Up to now we had one bbm
package including the fonts and the macros, but I think following the
Catalogue is a better idea, so now bbm gives the fonts, and bbm-macros
the macro stuff. I added the bbm-macros to all the collections/schemes
where bbm occurred.

Finally a question: Does it make sense to move those few scripts
(tlpkginfo, ctan2tds.pl, maybe some more) which are necessary for this
updating business to Master/tlpkg/bin? Currently we have ctan2tl there,
but this script relies on ctan2tds and tlpkginfo, which seems a bit a
strange thing.

Best wishes

Norbert

Sure.  The scripts will require a tiny bit of adjusting when they get
moved, since they self-locate things, and I just haven't had the
fortitude to take care of them all yet.  Ultimately I think Build/tools
and Build/cdbuild should disappear entirely, either into the attic or
tlpkg/bin, as appropriate.  Doing all that cleanup is again something I
just haven't felt like dealing with.  If you want to, feel free :).

It happened only in MAKEae (maybe others, too), because no makenormal is
called. 

AFAIS the problem is that $Foundry is set in other functions, but since
it is never declared a global variable it seems to be treated locally to
the function. Or something else. Anyway.

Ok, I will take a look. It is making me crazy to locate all the scripts
in all the subdirs, so I am bound to move them anyway ;-) Expect
breakage, but not too bad ;-)

Hi,

summary: 

- marvosym.pfb seems to be somehow broken in TL 2007 
- if mktexpk fails, dviout.exe loops and must be killed with task manager 


details: 

a friend asked me for help:  after updating his TeX system (upon my advice:-(
to TL 2007 on both WinXP and Win2000 he got in trouble using the "marvosym"
package:

the windows previewer (dviout.exe) doesn't display anything and only can be
killed via task manager iff he uses marvosym package.


since I'm using only linux (and never used marvosym before) I tried to get
some ideas using TL 2007 on SUSE 10.2 amd64.

with Linux I get the following error trying to convert marvosym font to pk (my
friend confirmed that WinXY shows the same error for mktexpk):

the font file

    /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/marvosym/marvosym.pfb

I used fontforge to read this font and generate a new newion of marvosym.pfb.
using this newly generated pfb file, mktexpk/gftopk on linux is happy now:

BUT: I mailed that new PFB to my windows friend (that's all phone debugging/consulting)
and he told me that after replacing the PFB file, he god some long and nasty beeeeeeeps 
on his system, but mktexpk still doesn't generate a PK file and dviout.exe
still does not show an output -- still he has to kill dviout.exe with task manager.


this is the original (buggy?) font:

questions: 

- are these known problems of marvosym.pfb and/or dviout.exe ?

- can you reproduce/confirm them ?

- any fix/update available ?

- which additional information do you need ?


thanks for any hint,

Seems that hinting is incorrect.  Can you compare both versions with
t1lint?  It's very verbose when I run it on marvosym.pfb.  Maybe
fontforge fixes some bugs.  And forget about md5sum, I guess that
fontforge at least writes a comment to the top of the file.  It's
better to disassemble the fonts (t1disasm) and use diff(1) to compare
them.

I'm sure that dviout.exe is not involved.  The error message comes
from ghostscript, though I never heard ghostscript beeping.  But a
terminal with full ASCII support should beep if you send ^G (BELL) to
it, which can happen if you send a binary file to it.  If your friend
installed ghostscript from the TeXLive-2007 CD/DVD, he certainly has
version 8.54 while you have version 8.15.  I suppose that he will get
the same result as you when he downgrades to version 8.15.

I'm not sure which version of gs should go into TL-2008.  Staszek used
the latest GNU version available at this time.  Karl told me that
older versions often work better for him but I had no time for testing
anything myself.  And as far as I recall, Windows and UNIX versions of
gs behave a little bit different in some situations.  

You would help us a lot if you

    a) check with t1lint whether the font created by fontforge is ok.
       You can also try Peter Szabo's type1fix (part of textrace),

    b) ask your friend to try ghostscript 8.15.

If the font is ok and gs-8.15 works better than gs-8.54, I'll create a
ghostscript package for TeXLive-2008 depending on version 8.15.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Harald,

    the font file
        /usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/marvosym/marvosym.pfb
    looks ok, it has identical md5sum to the version on CTAN.

Given this, about all I can suggest is writing the author of marvosym.
Of course, all the various debugging techniques Reinhard mentioned could
only help.

Unfortunately, given that marvosym.pfb is some seven years old, I would
speculate the problem is that current gs is stricter (or something) than
old ...

Best,
Karl

Maybe newer versions are stricter, but if this is desired, why don't
they provide halfways reasonable error messages?

I doubt that this behavior is desired.

ERROR: /undefined means that something was supposed to be defined but
was not. I am afraid that this is caused by something else than just
by "stricter version".

indeed, the fontforge output only has 2 warnings left:

	+ t1lint marvosym.pfb
	marvosym.pfb: While interpreting `cedilla':
	marvosym.pfb:   warning: small delta-y in `hstem' (0)

md5sum was just to compare TL2007 and CTAN pfb files...

dviout.exe is an independant followup problem -- it just should not hang/loop/crash/...
if there are any problems with mktexpk.

I'll ask him.  and tomorrow I can test some other ghostscript versions on

Message-ID: <ABE84D344FE3C64D9A0158F538EA6CBF014759EA@TSUVEMAIL.tristate.edu>

I'm a new member of the list, and a new user of TeX-Live (MacTeX),
although I've been using TeX for more than 15 years. I'm running MacTeX
on a Mac iBook G4 with OS X 10.4.6. I installed MacTeX last weekend
without any problem, and it has run without a hitch (once I realized I
had created the texmf folder for my personal style files in the wrong
library).

 

I have always used plain TeX or AMS-TeX. Since MacTex didn't install the
AMS-TeX format (is there a reason for that?), I'm wondering if I create
it by running

\input amstex.tex

\dump

and ``typesetting'' it using Initex? I'm also not certain where I should
put the format file once I've created it. (The instructions I found on
the AMS site are for Windows.)

 

Thank you for your help.

Even simpler: you should be able to run

     fmtutil --byfmt amstex

in the Terminal, and the format file will be created and installed  
for you.

This will install the format in your personal home directory (in the  
hidden .texlive2007 tree); alternatively,

     sudo -H fmtutil-sys --byfmt amstex

will install it in the system-wide texmf-var tree. Either should work  
fine, as I guess you're not sharing this system with other TeX users.

Hi, I have created a .pdf file with pdflatex under debian linux AND with
miktex under windows.

The problem is that when i scroll the document whith arrow keys (in
selection mode) with the acrobat reader the cursor moves crazy at a certain
point.

All works correctly, so far, but in a paragraph the cursor arrow keys works
crazy and incorrectly. Ant this only in a certain paragraph !

Do you know this bug ?

Is there a solution or what can i do ?

Thx.

I tried the following versions of ghostscript, all on SUSE 10.1: 

   3.53   5.10   6.52   7.05   8.15   8.50   8.54   8.57

all those gs versions caused an error with the original marvosym.pfb
and none of them failed with the new marvosym.pfb...

so it doesn't look like a problem with new ghostscript versions,
at least not on Linux.


the command actually being tested will all local files was

	( echo 10.0 ; echo `seq 0 255` ) | gs-$version -dNODISPLAY -dNOGC -sSUBSTFONT=MarVoSym -q -- render.ps MarVoSym "(marvosym.pfb) brun" "" 600.00

(inspired by the exec() call in gsftopk with strace;) with "render.ps" from
TL2007 gsftopk/render.ps.

Subject: [tex-live] problems with scrolling pdf files created with pdflatex.
Message-ID: <faa45f250710050924t19093a6cke5932e63437fb840@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I have created a .pdf file with pdflatex under debian linux AND with
miktex under windows.

The problem is that when i scroll the document whith arrow keys (in
selection mode) with the acrobat reader the cursor moves crazy at a certain
point.

All warks correctly, but in a paragraph the cursor arrow keys works crazy
and incorrectly. Ant this only in a certain paragraph !

Do you know this bug ?

Is there a solution or what can i do ?

Thx.

Have you tried it in another reader? Try xpdf.

My Fedora Rel. 7 linux box has two versions of marvosym.pfb, the tetex version,
which works, and the TeX Live (svn) version, which does not work.

Details:

Red Hat's tetex provides:

$ strings  /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/public/marvosym/marvosym.pfb |head
%!PS-AdobeFont-1.0: MarVoSym Version 2000.0226

TeXLive svn provides:

%!PS-AdobeFont-1.0: MarVoSym Freeware - http://www.marvosym.de

/FontInfo 9 dict dup begin

I have gs-8.60, which is also provided by MiKTeX.

There appears to be a newer marvosym.ttf on the author's site.  The
corresponding fontforge MarVoSym.pfb file also works with gs-8.60.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive on Gentoo
Message-ID: <20071009002159.2c69a5f1@toz.strangled.net>

Hi, 

I've been working for a few months on integrating Texlive into Gentoo.
I've reached a state where I'm now happy with it and will probably add
the packages to the official tree very soon. I must thank you all for
the work you've been dedicating in structuring the tex archive and
maintaining a latex distribution, it made my job much easier.

The layout we'll be using is a modular one, like Texlive provides or how
it's packaged into Debian. I've been automatically generating ebuilds
from lists files, that's not optimal and parsing tpm files would have
been better but I've enough information with lists and sed + grep are
enough to parse 'em ;) I'll probably have to switch to tlpkg for next
releases, but for now imho that's fine.


I've had to apply some patches that still applies to trunk, I'm not
sure if that's the right list to send them, if that's not please tell me
where it's more appropriate.

So here is the list : 
- a buffer overflow bug in makeindex 
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=225491
- texlive-core-2007-icu-xetex-execstacks.patch
	a patch imported from icu 3.6 to not generate asm with
stacks marked as executable
- texlive-core-2007-libteckit-asneeded.patch
	libTECkit lib needs to be linked with zlib, usually this does
not cause problems but I've had build failures while linking with
--as-needed without the patch

Other patches are already merged or are specific to our way of using tex
(basically adding /usr/share/texmf-site as a texmf tree to allow single
packages updates compatible with various tex distributions)

Regards, 

Alexis.

As a Gentoo user I'm very glad to hear this.  Thank you very much for
your work!

The main idea of tlpkg is to provide something which is easier to
parse than XML.  Switching to tlpkg makes a lot of sense.  And I don't
know whether you can rely on the list files in the future.  There are
a few things in the repository which are kept for compatibility with
the existing installers.  They might disappear sometime.  But you can
always rely on tlpkg.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <a6e8c1d0710100305g76ca97e2w46bd7c94d09ae552@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I have added an option to the texlinks script which allows the user to
unlink, effectively reversing the texlinks process. I needed this to
clean up the filesystem before the texlive package is removed.

a) Is the code correct? It appears to do what I think it should, but a
second pair of eyes might reveal more.

b) Can this go upstream? I would find it useful, as I wouldn't have to
re-patch my port each year.

The following command removes all symlinks to nonexistent files:

find / -name "*" -type l ! -xtype f ! -xtype d -ok rm {} \;

I am aware that this need not be desirable in all cases.

I'd rather remove explicitly, links that texlive owns (unreferenced or
not), incase I break other parts of the operating system. Thanks for
the suggestion.

Subject: [tex-live] dvipng woes
Message-ID: <42f28fe0710101226s6660b91dlef0651da29913372@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am doing some .png rendering of LaTeX documents for web display
with MacTeX on OS X 10.4.10 using the following toolchain:

.tex to .dvi (latex)
.dvi to .png (dvipng)
.png to .png (ImageMagick convert, just doing general polish)

I should also note that I am doing this from within Apache, and using
a custom-created type1 Trebuchet MS font from a .ttf file, a bunch of
custom classes, and non-standard packages.  They were originally
stored in my ~/Library/texmf directory, but I moved them to
/usr/local//texlive/texmf-local, which I later found out is a result
of Apache not providing a $HOME variable in the environment, which
messes up kpathsea's path expansion.

Anyways, that solved problems I had with LaTeX, but I noticed I was
still having problems with dvipng.  The issue is that my fonts are not
being detected by dvipng.  When I open up my .dvi files with xdvik
(using X11), I find that this stage of rendering is working correctly.
 Also, when I run dvipng  from the command line, dvipng is able to
find my font in my home directory, and uses that.

After some searching and looking at debug output of dvipng, I found
the following snippet in the documentation of dvipng:

%%%%%
2.4 Installation outside the texmf tree

In some cases, a dvipng binary installed outside the texmf tree will
not be able to find virtual fonts, or the PostScript font maps
(normally used by dvips). This may be because only $SELFAUTOLOC,
$SELFAUTODIR, and $SELFAUTOPARENT are used in the texmf tree
configuration file `texmf.cnf'. If so, give the switch
`--enable-selfauto-set' to `./configure'. This will make dvipng adjust
these three internally so that kpathsea thinks that dvipng is
installed in the texmf tree.
%%%%%

This pretty accurately describes my problem to the letter, but I don't
know anything about the compile-time options sent when the MacTeX
package was created.  I emailed Richard koch, and said that the MacTex
binaries are created from texlive, then packaged up for easy
distribution.  So my question is, does anyone know if this flag is
used at compile-time by default, and if not, what would be the best
way to go about replacing my current binary with a correctly
configured one?  What options would I need to pass it for it to work
correctly in OS X?  will I have to risk rebuilding any toolchains?

Thanks,
Paul Mantz

It is not exactly an answer to your question but remember that Apache
does not pass any environment variable to the CGI scripts. If you need
them, you have to put PassEnv into your httpd.conf, or set the
variables by SetEnv.

Hi Paul,

It's not clear to me that --enable-selfauto-set is really the answer
(though it's certainly possible).  (la)tex uses the same mechanism to
find files, so if latex is finding tfm's, I don't see offhand why dvipng
wouldn't find maps.  Isn't dvipng installed in the same directory as
latex?

In any case, to answer your question, I don't know if
--enable-selfauto-set was specified or not.  I doubt it; I don't think
"pretending" anything would be appropriate for the distribution version.
I tried to find a unique string that would be in the binary, but nothing
was immedately apparent.

You could download dvipng from CTAN (or wherever) and configure/compile
a version yourself; it's just a single standalone binary, so it's easy
enough to try putting a different version in place.

Alternatively, if you can get the envvar KPATHSEA_DEBUG set to -1, stderr
should accumulate a whole lot of messages about where it's trying to
find files.  Groveling through that should pin down precisely why it's
failing to find the files.  (Perhaps -D -1 will have the same effect, I
don't know.)

Hope this helps.

    The following command removes all symlinks to nonexistent files:
    find / -name "*" -type l ! -xtype f ! -xtype d -ok rm {} \;

Unless it's linked to a special file, or socket, or some other file type.

The find manual says this:
    ``-P -xtype l''
          True if the symbolic link is broken

I didn't try it, but I presume that means 
  find / -P -xtype l -ok rm '{}' \;
would be a more robust way to accomplish the task.

I guess here is a small misunderstanding, the ucs.sty is contained in
the TeX Live collection "collection-latexrecommend", which transfers
into a Debian package "texlive-latex-recommended".

I don't know how ucs.sty ended up there, the decision on what is
"recommended" and what "extra" is quite difficult to carry out. If you
think that it is completely wrong please let us know on
	tex-live at tug.org
(Cc-ed).

Thanks a lot and all the best

texexec --once --texutil

It is the default in AUCTeX and I have no idea why.

Sorry if this is not the right place for this.

I recently upgraded to texlive. I use powerdot, so I followed the
instructions and updated the config.ps file as specified here:
http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html

When I try to compile a powerdot presentation using texshop, I get an error
of the type:

And then it prints out the bulk of the config.ps file. At the end it
displays:

Neither do I, but it apparently does not work for mp graphics. Have
you tried adding \runMPgraphicstrue at the top of your file? That might
help. If it doesn't, then I am as lost as you are, and it is likely
an AUCTeX issue.

The context on TL 2007 is from 2007.01.12. The date of the tools like
texexec is only updated if there were significant changes. Perhaps that
has gotten you confused?

Hi Norbert

It is indeed a TeXlive recommendation and it is not clear where they
get their advice from.

Our problem is that so closely connecting latex and recommended
suggests this may be our classification.

This does not imply that we think that ucs.sty is wrongly classified;
merely that the Project Team does not necessarily have any input into
this -latex-recommended list.

My AUCTeX offers "ConTeXt" (run once) and also "ConTeXt full" on the
command menu.

    I appreciate all your hard work on TexLive. But I noticed that the 
    context you are shipping is pretty dated (2005). 

The ConTeXt shipped with TL 2007 was current at the time of release (Feb
2007 or so).  Taco took care of updating it in TL himself (thanks Taco :).

As Norbert said, perhaps the scripts' dates were misleading you ...

    Any plans to upgrade to a more recent version? I would like to see
    it incorporated.

In general, we only update the programs when we are approaching a
release, and right now we're not.  In the next release, we'll again take
the stable version of context that is current at the time.

If you want the latest context in the meantime, you're best off getting
it from pragma, as far as I know.

Best,
Karl

Haven't seen this before.  What platform are you on?  If Mac or Windows,
perhaps you have to save the file with proper line endings for it.
Although your /usr/local/texlive/... path makes me think you are on
something Unixish.  Maybe it got corrupted in the download somehow?
I'll attach the same file, just in case.

I'm using the current config.ps file myself on GNU/Linux, FWIW.
(And it's working. :)

    it is not clear where they get their advice from.

Sebastian decided as best he could, many years ago.  Very little has
changed in the set of "recommended" TL packages for a long time now.


Anyway, the main point here is not the classification of ucs, but rather
the possible bug in it.  I see on
http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/ that Dominique Unruh is no
longer able to maintain the unicode package (which contains ucs.sty),
and a new maintainer is welcome.

Perhaps someone here would like to take it on ...

At that time ucs.sty was probably the only way to use UTF-8 encoded
text for LaTeX. Nowadays inputenc.sty includes UTF-8 capabilities that
handles many cases, so that ucs.sty is more for special cases, ie more
"extra" than "recommended".

I am not sure, but the time to do this might be better spend extending
the Unicode-coverage of the UTF-8 implementation in inputenc.sty.
AFAIK that's the area where ucs.sty is still better than inputenc.sty.

You don't mention a platform.  On debian linux, context is packaged
separately.  On Windows, MiKTeX provides updates and may be a
better choice than TL.

Others have explained that TL uses the current stable version of ConTeXt
at the time of release, but it is probably worth mentioning that the design
of TL makes it quite easy to add and remove entire texmf trees, so as long
as the binaries are "new enough", you can create a local texmf-context
and unpack the cont-tmf.zip there, add the new tree to your texmf.cnf,
update the ls-R file, generate new formats, and you are off.  You don't
have to remove the old ConTeXt files from the texmf-dist tree if you
put the new directory earlier in the TEXMF list.

note that the inputenc utf8.def has definitions for all of the ucs for
which there is "standard" latex font encoding coverage.  unfortunately,
this misses out greek, since no-one seems able to agree on a modern
greek encoding that works with the tex hyphenation algorithm (i don't
know how it goes with classical greek, a language that no-one bothered
to teach me at school :-( )

so a contributed package that provides ucs.sty .def files that work with
inputenc would be most welcome; i don't know how easy it would be -- it
might need to hack into inputenc itself.

note that there are circumstances (one appeared on c.t.t recently) where
inputenc utf-8 works, but ucs.sty doesn't.

Basically mechanical hyphenation rules IIRC: hyphenate before
consonants groups that could be at the front of a word.  So you get
O-ly-mpos or A-ga-me-mnon and He-ktor.

That would be true as utf8 in inputenc was deliberately limited to
characters that were clearly intended for use with the standard LaTeX
8-bit font encodings.

Personally, I gave up on all this ucs.sty/inputenc stuff last year and 
switched to xelatex
instead. Now it's native Unicode joy every time, instead of endless
problems once you stray beyond the latin world....

Well, I checked with my classical Greek dictionary, and indeed there
are no words in there starting with "mp".  I was a bit surprised,
since "mp" nowadays signifies the "b" sound, and in modern Greek you
have "mpar?ki" for pub, for example.  So the rule appears that there
must not be a _classical_ Greek word starting with those consonants in
order to hyphenate within the group.

Live and learn.

Btw: Instead of URW Arial, install the Heros family from the TeX Gyre
fonts (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/).

I looked in that section, and the only thing that refers to maps is 
updmap.cfg  I put a MAP line in there, but obviously that's not the only thing 
I need to do, as it still doesn't work.  It says:

mktextfm: Could not map typeface abbreviation ri for Arial
mktextfm: Need to update... fontname/special.map?
.
.
.
Running mktexmf Arial
mktexmf: empty or non-existent rootfile!
! I can't find file 'Arial".

What else do I need to do?  Thanks. - Mark

    I put a MAP line in there, but obviously that's not the only thing 
    I need to do

After adding the map line, run updmap.  If you just run it with no
arguments, hopefully it will update all the right places.

Alternative: try running
  getnonfreefonts urw-arial

The intent is that that will do the installation, including the map file
stuff, for you.

Unfortunately, that command only exists for linux, not windows.

Which updmap.cfg do I add it to, the one under texmf or texmf-var?  I assume 
texmf.

What is the command I should use for updmap?  Just updmap, or do I add 
anything else?

Oops, I made the aassumption that I could say /font=Arial.  I am a mac bluesky 
tex user, and am used to doing such things.  I'm trying to install it for 
TexLive for someoe else.  In any event, the URW fonts are named:

  A030-Reg                    ua1r8a.pfb
  A030-Bol                    ua1b8a.pfb    
  A030-Ita                    ua1ri8a.pfb
  A030-BolIta                 ua1bi8a.pfb

Ok, the TeX command now works if I do /font=ua1r8a.  Can I change something so 
that I say /font=arial instead?  How would I do that?

In any event, while the dvi file gets created without a problem, converting to 
ps or pdf doesn't work.  What might be the problem now?  Thanks. - Mark

What is the exact command I need to install the font?  At this point though, 
TeX sees the font, so can I assume that I did enter the correct updmap 
command?  (P.s. what is the exact updmap command that I should be using?)

The PS converter does not though, so what do you think I've done wrong now?

Ok, I FINALLY have gotten the fonts installed, after multiple tries.

However, as I said previously, I would like to be able to specific the fonts 
with my own name, i.e.

\font\arial10=arial at 10pt

rather than having to use 

\font\arial10=ua1r8r at 10pt

Can I change the font name?  Thanks! - Mark

Unfortunately, they want Arial, as only certain fonts are recommended to be 
used in a document they are submitting to a specific government agency.  
Probably something close is good enough though, but it's not up to me. :) -

I'm affraid, no. Please try \font\arial=<tfmfontname> at 10pt instead. 
Please observe that "1" is control sequence separator (in your example).

updmap --enable Map=ua1.map

This will add ua1.map to updmap.cfg and finally creates the map files
needed by dvips, pdftex, dvipdfm, re-creates the ls-R files...

\font=Arial means that tex should load Arial.tfm.

  1. copy ua1.map my-ua1.map

  2. rename the tfm files as you need (better make copies of them)

  3. edit my-ua1.map accordingly.  The first column contains the
     basename of the tfm file.  Make sure that the .pfb files
     mentioned in the map file have the same names as the fonts.

  3. updmap --disable ua1.map  
     updmap --enable Map=ua1.map

I'm sure that Staszek means getnonfreefonts.  If getnonfreefonts is a
UNIX shell script, you have TeX Live 2005 installed.  In TeX Live 2007
it's a Perl script.  The Windows variant claims to be a batch file but
actually it's the same Perl script as for UNIX (not only Linux, BTW).

Martin proposed XeTeX.  If it's not a big problem for you to upgrade
to TeX Live 2007 you get both, XeTeX and a version of getnonfreefonts
which works on Windows.

  Reinhard

If you only need support for English (you only need ASCII), and if they
insist on Arial, the most obvious solution is to switch to Vietnamese.
Make sure that you have support for Vietnamese installed (TeX Live
package vntex) and that the variable OSFONTDIR in
texmf-var/web2c/texmf.cnf points to c:/windows/fonts.  You need pdftex
then because dvips can't use TTF.

Dear Karl, dear all!

Bastien Roucaries has found that dvips -z segfaults on amd64 with very
long href entries, example:

\documentclass{article}
usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
\href{/XXXX/XXXXXXX/XXX/XXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}{solot}
\end{document}

This does NOT happen on i386, but I can confirm the segfault on amd64.

Bastien found a place that could be the problem:

It turns out that URW Arial ain't quite real Arial.  So I'm curious, is it 
really possible to use the Vietnamese font for English Arial?  Will it really 
work? :)

Btw, I'm in the process on installing the new texlive 2007 now. - Mark

Yes, Monotype Arial provides glyphs for many languages.  The problem
is that the font alone is not sufficient.  You also need the tfm and
encoding files.  Han The Thanh created all files required for
typesetting Vietnamese.  You have to use T5 (Vietnamese) encoding
because nothing else is supported, but even in T5 the ASCII characters
are at their standard positions.

But keep in mind that you have to use pdftex because dvips doesn't
support TrueType fonts.

Maybe there is a little problem: XP provides OpenType fonts.  But if
you can't copy the TrueType fonts from a win9x machine, you can
download them from

     http://corefonts.sourceforge.net

 > Btw, I'm in the process on installing the new texlive 2007 now.

If you have TL-2007 you could also try XeTeX.  It uses system fonts by
default.  And XeTeX supports OpenType.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <ABE84D344FE3C64D9A0158F538EA6CBF01590DEC@TSUVEMAIL.tristate.edu>

This morning's attempt to install TeX Live, scheme-medium on my computer here at the university seemed to be going well?.?.?.?until I got a "tlmp.ini permissions failed" message. When I decided to install the full scheme, I got a similar message, but this one said: 
Read of tlmpgui.ini failed. Check the permissions and whether it exists. 
Almost immediately, I got a similar (but seemingly related) message: 
Writing of the D:/setuptl/tmlpgui.ini file failed. Check the file permissions. 

A search on my hard drive for the tlmp file and a tlmpgui file turned up nothing. They are on the CD from which I'm doing the installation, but the latter apparently cannot be changed.

Since I've never used TeX on a computer running Windows, and since the system administrator (who is a Windows person but knows nothing about TeX), is as clueless as I am, can someone tell me (1) if the read/write error messages are common, not unexpected, or indicated a problem, and (2) what, if anything, we need to do to make the program run. 

Also, for any of you who use Texmaker, where does it expect to find the PDF or DVI files?

Message-ID: <loom.20071023T184417-686@post.gmane.org>

I'm presently using URW Arial for Arial, but it's not quite real Arial.
Is there a way to use the present URW Arial, but change a map file somewhere 
so that the postscript font which is used, is ArialMT instead? 

I do something sort of like this for Bluesky Tex on the mac.  Bluesky only 
contains helvetica, but helvetica is extremely close to arial.  And in Bluesky 
Tex, it's possible to change the name of the postscript font assigned to a 
font.  I.e. for Helvetica, I changed it's postscript font to be ArialMT.

Then I run Adobe distiller, and the PDF looks great.  All I mainly care about 
is getting PDF output, fwiw, so maybe a texpdf map file can be changed instead?

(I'm trying to avoid the previous suggestion of installing the Vietnamese font 
in order to get Arial, if possible!)

Thanks. - Mark

    running the documentation file of arydshln.sty requires
    the dtx file, which is read by the arydshln-man.tex.
    But this file cannot be found by tex, it is in the
    source directory.

I know the problem, but that is simply the way TL has always been
arranged (since long before I was involved) -- the dtx/ins have always
been put in the source/ subtree.

However, I'm not sure if it really gains anything to have the dtx/ins
under source; perhaps it would be better for them to be in the
doc/package directory, which would keep everything together.  I've
thought about that, but it's quite a big change, so I procrastinate ...

I'd rather not treat arydshln differently than every other package in
this regard.  I expect there are plenty of other packages with a similar
setup.

Why were you rerunning the doc, anyway?  (Just wondering.)

I now did.  Thanks to the pointer.  How comes that this feature is
neither mentioned in the NEWS file nor in the documentation?  I
consider this as *very bad*.  Lack of documentation is inexcusable.

Hmm.  This isn't a replacement for documentation.  IMHO, it *must* be
mentioned in the NEWS file (perhaps in the `experimental' section'.

Hello,

I think a better place for this issue is the (ntg-)pdftex mailing list,
therefore I have CCed the ntg-pdftex mailing list.

It was presented by Han at EuroBachoTeX 2007:
  `Font-specific issues in pdfTeX'
(I don't know whether slides exist on-line, via google I only
found a non-existing pdf file, but at least google's html view
was available.)

Section "5. Support for ToUnicode map".

> I consider this as *very bad*.  Lack of documentation is inexcusable.

I think there are unsolved issues. Now there are two methods
for adding CMaps:
(a) \pdffontattr, package cmap
(b) \pdfgentounicode, glyphtounicode.tex

Both methods have its limitations, e.g. (b) only works for Type 1 fonts.
Thus you could need both methods to cover all fonts, but the methods
doesn't know each other, thus fonts can end up with two CMap tables.

Yours sincerely

dtx/ins files are sources for both the package and documentation, so I

Source is source and isn't ready-to-read documentation
such as arydshln-man.pdf. The source file arydshln-man.tex
doesn't belong to TDS:doc, it should be put into TDS:source.

A "normal user" of TeXlive can count the occurences of his name within
TeXlive using the fingers of two hands without resorting to a
positional number system.

You don't qualify.  Neither do I.  Probably less than a third of the
people writing on this list.  Scary thought.

Subject: [tex-live] TL version info
Message-ID: <200710241638.l9OGciu02414@f7.net>

FYI, I've changed texconfig so that it looks for
<TLROOT>/release-texlive.txt (in addition to the tetex release-* files),
and prints its first line.  The output looks like this:

texconfig version 1193182750
TeX Live version: development (see http://tug.org/texlive)

I added the file in the svn source, and will arrange for the images to
include it (at the top level).  The installers will have to copy it to
the runtime.  


I also updated texconfig help, and added a new option
texconfig version (or --version), to just print the version info.

Incidentally, I also updated the updmap help message a few days ago.

Comments/suggestions welcome.

Apart from not having time, there are many reasons for
missing documentation. Perhaps the feature isn't finished
and too `experimental'. Or there are plans to redesign the
interfaces. Documentation raises compatibility issues.
On the other hand the author will have less feedback
without documentation.
  But either way, this decision is up to the author who implements
the feature, not the user who wants to use it. But the user may
help, if the author welcomes it, e.g. writing documentation, testing,
or providing ideas, e.g. how to achieve:

Well, this is a lame excuse: It would have been a matter of 10
seconds, namely to copy Thanh's announcement of the patch verbatim to
the NEWS file.

Indeed.  How shall people try it without knowing this feature at all.

If I interpret the patch correctly, it wasn't Thanh who has applied it
-- Thanh has done his job correctly providing the necessary details of
how to use his new extension, but the applier missed to update the
NEWS file.

As to possible permission problems:

Which version of Windows are you running? Later versions of Windows
close off more areas of the filesystem to non-administrators, and
with Vista, you have to explicitly request administrator privileges
even if you already are an administrator.

Was `Install for all users' unchecked? Did you verify that you have
write permissions to the chosen TLroot directory?

hello

I am using the document class 'memoir'. Now I would like to use supertabular to construct a twocolumn table which spans more than one page. The problem is now that supertabular does not fit in the memoir class. And longtable is not able to produce a twocolumn table.

Is there a possibility to produce a twocolumn table in the memoir class which spans more than one page?

Thanks for your answers.

You will have better chances asking these questions to a USER oriented
audience, like comp.text.tex. This here is a development and testing
forum for TeX Live.

Thanks for the report.  Of course making such a symlink shouldn't be
necessary.  What system are you on?

Are you building directly in the source directory?  Perhaps it's related
to that, unfortunately.

Hi there,

I notice we are nearing the release of TL 2008 (right?).

How do you go about this? Is there a release candidate for developers
to test etc. If there is a release candidate, will it be distributed
as the single tarball that was previously discussed discussed?

I ask because I want to start processing the new TPM replacements and
porting the new release soon.

Great work guys.

Wrong, we are far from any release. 

I wouldn't expect a new release before March/April 2008.

Nothing has been fixed till now, but (almost) everything is possible.

That you can do already now, the texlive.tlpdb in trunk/Master is
updated daily and contains all information. Hopefully from now on
(tomorrow or day after tomorrow (overmorrow as I would say)) also the
TeX Catalogue informations are merged into the texlive.tlpdb.

I am building from the source directory, but I used ./configure instead of ./Build.  When I used ./Build, there was no problem.

The file czhyphen.tex, containing (newer) hyphenation patterns for
Czech, is deeply buried in the archive

  macros/cstex/base/csplain.tar.gz

on CTAN.  I think it would be a good idea to add them to the canonical

but not the slovak hyphenation files?  why not?

anyway, the licence of csplain is (iirc) indeterminate, so i'm unwilling
to break things out of it even though someone once said it was "free".

get petr olsak to tell me to split them out (and which files -- there
are two for each language, at least) and i will.

I have only checked czhyphen.tex, nothing else; this is the only
reason.

Uh, oh, the pattern files are already included in TeXLive, and they are
GPLed...

i don't believe we would be safe from criticism (from petr) if we
simply took stuff from one of his indeterminately-licensed bundles and
put it elsewhere (even given that the files themselves are gpl).

find somewhere the original authors have put them, and i'll be happy to
"mirror" them into ctan, but i won't take them from petr's bundle
without his say so.

There are historical reasons, the hyphenation files are part of
csplain and used by cslatex and latex (and xelatex). Petr Tesarik
(under the CSTUG grant) developed a new Czech and Slovak module for
babel, we are now waiting for its inclusion into standard distribution
(currently it can be installed automatically using my script at
http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/tex/csh_babel.php). This solves
incompatibilities between different czech.sty and slovak.sty and all
extra functionality of cslatex is implemented in this new module so
that cslatex could (and should) be removed when the new module is part
of the official babel. It might be better to do such reorganization
after this happens.

That was the reason we removed it from Debian. But immediately after
this move Petr fortunately decided to change the licensing and and reads
now:

| This macro package (csplain.ini, il2code.tex, csfonts.tex, hyphen.lan,
| plaina4.tex) is free software; you can use it without any restriction.
| You can redistribute it under the following condition: 
| 
| You can do any changes in this software for your own usage. However,
| you cannot distribute the changed software under the same name
| "csplain".  Only the current administrator of CSTeX can do official
| changes to csplain.

which is ok.

Hi all!

Ubuntu users reported a bug which is easy to recreate:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[latin]{babel}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

stops with 
! Undefined control sequence.
 l.184 \addtoextraslatin
                       {\LatinMarksOff}

I confirmed that on TeX Live 2005 it DID work, while on TeX Live 2007 it
breaks.

Any comments?

Umpf, yes, it is true, with the version from CTAN it does compile
without errors.

But please, can we do decent version numbering / date stamps?

diff OLD/latin.ldf CTAN/latin.ldf:
(so the - lines are in the OLD one, the + ones in the CTAN version!)
...
-%% Copyright 1989-2005 Johannes L. Braams and any individual authors
+%% Copyright 1989-2000 Johannes L. Braams and any individual authors
...
-        [2005/11/17 v2.0g Latin support from the babel system]
+        [2007/03/20 v.2.0f Latin support from the babel system]
...

Ok the Date is better, but the version is less ...

Anyway, thanks a lot

Norbert

latin.dtx and latin.ins in  
<http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/babel/> look okay  
to me. Where did you get your version from?

Cheers,

	CTAN/language/latin/latin.ldf

But the one from required/babel is MUCH better, a trivial one line diff,
just removing the offending line:
 \addto\extraslatin{\def\LatinMarksOff{\shorthandoff{^}\shorthandoff{=}}}
-\addtoextraslatin{\LatinMarksOff}
 \initiate at active@char{"}%

Good to hear. Thanks again!


Best wishes

Norbert

mea culpa (note the latin...)

i noticed this, and then got distracted by the existence of
language/latin/latin.dtx which is different again.  so i've not
discussed it with johannes.  will do.

Hi,

I have added the unlink option into the texlinks manpage, and also
sorted the options alphabetically.
