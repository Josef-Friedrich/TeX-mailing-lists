FYI, I've been using the following

\pdfglyphtounicode{ff}{0066 0066}
\pdfglyphtounicode{ffi}{0066 0066 0069}
\pdfglyphtounicode{ffl}{0066 0066 006C}
\pdfglyphtounicode{fi}{0066 0069}
\pdfglyphtounicode{fl}{0066 006C}
\pdfgentounicode=1

for one year and haven't noticed any issue. It seems that only
some mappings yield issues with Ghostscript.

Overwriting the preloaded entries will not solve the issue. The issue
comes from the fact that there are some entries that conflict with
other ones, and I cannot know which ones for future .tex files. It
seems that the workaround is to use an empty glyphtounicode.tex file
and only the \pdfglyphtounicode commands I need.

I see that the `xmpincl` package got updated, however, the file
`xmpincl.pdf` wasn't.  Is this intentional?

Message-ID: <20211103.105010.103017626363821323.wl@gnu.org>


In August 2019 I wrote the following:

  Some of the new binaries fail to run on my MacOS 10.7.5 box:

    > pdftex --version
    dyld: Symbol not found: __ZSt9terminatev

    Trace/BPT trap: 5

  All affected binaries (at least `pdftex', `xetex', and `etex') show
  the same error.

I get the same again; the `pdftex` binary is dated June 30th, 2021;
the other ones are older.  Binaries from 2020 seem to work, BTW.

 Indeed it is dated May 10 2008 on CTAN.

> Is this intentional?

 I have no idea; we CTAN people replace the whole package just
 as we get it.   But since this was a "silent" update (probably
 just a bug fix?) we can _assume_ that no changes in the user
 documentation were necessary.

 In any case, I have forwarded your message to the "person with
 upload permission" who sent us that update.  So maybe we will
 get a more qualified reply.

         Best,
   Petra  (from CTAN)

My fault. I have installed the package in September and had overlooked
that both README and xmpincl.pdf are still ancient.

As a workaround you can create it yourself by running

pdflatex xmpincl.ins
pdflatex xmpincl.dtx


Sorry, about that.

Thanks.  I don't really need that; I just wanted to point out an
inconsistency that I noticed in TeXLive :-)

Hello Werner,

I was the one who updated the xmpincl package. However, I am not the 
maintainer of this package (there is not currently an active 
maintainer). I just fixed a small error so that xmpincl would still work 
with the pdfx package and with the latest version of LaTeX. I did not 
have time nor interest to update the package documentation xmpincl.pdf.

See the discussion on page 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/605854/error-using-pdfx-on-tex-live-2021/616538 
for the details.

Best wishes,
Jarmo Niemel?

Hi

NOTE: This week's TeX Hour is FRIDAY. The UK clocks moved back to GMT last
weekend.

FRI 5 Nov: 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Title: Office of Disability Services and LaTeX developers
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

I'm delighted to have Steve Jacobs returning as our special guest. To
accommodate him we've moved the TeX Hour to FRIDAY (and still 6:30 to
7:30pm UK time). He'll talk about Office of Disabilities Service [ODS]
professionals who work in STEM.

This TeX Hour is an opportunity for TeX users and developers to learn
something about the ODS STEM professionals from a person who supplies and
supports software they use, and who has much personal contact with them.
And some ODS professionals attend the TeX Hour.

Many colleges and universities in the USA have an ODS. The professionals in
the ODS have varied duties, most of which are not math. They are student
focussed, mainly on individual students. ODS professionals help students
with disability progress and successfully acquire STEM knowledge.

The ad hoc reformatting of mathematical content is a very important part of
ODS support. Teacher authored materials, including exams and tests, are
particularly important. Having more and better well understood accessible
authoring tools would help greatly.

Steve will describe the STEM workflow in ODS, and some of the
inefficiencies in the present process. Here's a video showing one of the
tools (InftyReader from Steve's IDEAL Group) in use.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvvHi023U7Y

In the longer term an online forum for sharing experience and information
between ODS users and TeX developers would be most helpful.  It helps for
users and developers to share information about the software that connects
them.

Videos for last week's TeX Hour "A brief introduction to Portable TeX
Documents"
will appear tomorrow at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7hjY18EEa4f3nS6d25CUPU4

Happy TeXing

I only have physical access to the machine running the builds during weekends.
(I have a VM that's capable of doing the same, but I would prefer to
check the source of the problem.)

If you don't get any answer by Sunday morning, please ping me.

It's a tiny bit annoying because in order to make this work properly,
one needs a special version of libc++: it has to be extracted from the
development tools for Lion (10.7), copied over another file (with the
same name / same location) on Snow Leopard (10.6), and most likely
that gets overwritten whenever libc++ itself gets updated (together
with new versions of clang) with the package manager.

If I figure out a way to somehow test/print the version of libc++
(help welcome), I could add an extra check when building the binaries
on our CI infrastructure (if that would fail, I would at least
immediately know that I need to fix something).

An alternative would be to have a diligent tester on Lion during the
TL pretest period ;)
I could probably also set up a job to run the tests, but I would need
something (either VM or a real machine running Lion) that remains
online most of the time and periodically runs some set of tests.

The package had an error and Karl removed it for the time being. The

Message-ID: <fa57a1d6-7de1-1187-6fab-df619b93e676@uea.ac.uk>

Hi,

Some of the testidx files are in the wrong place in the TeX Live 
distribution.

The testidx-glossaries-*.tex and testidx-glossaries-*.bib files are 
currently in the doc/latex/testidx directory but they are required by 
testidx-glossaries.sty and need to be on TeX's path.

These should be:

tex/latex/testidx/testidx-glossaries-nodiglyphs.tex
tex/latex/testidx/testidx-glossaries-diglyphs.tex
tex/latex/testidx/testidx-glossaries-samples.tex
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-mathsym.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-samples-utf8.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-nodiglyphs-utf8.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-samples-ascii.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-diglyphs-utf8.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-markers.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-nodiglyphs.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-samples.bib
bibtex/bib/testidx/testidx-glossaries-numbers.bib

I'm assuming the .bib files need to be on the bibtex/bib/ path. They are 
actually bib2gls files rather than bibtex files.

If they are looked up via BIBINPUTS, then bibtex/bib.
If via TEXINPUTS, then tex/latex.

I confess I don't recall, even after editing your papers about it, which
bib2gls uses, and the --help apparently doesn't say ... anyway, I put
them in bibtex/bib for now. Let me know. --thanks again, karl.

Hi everyone,

I just recently found
	https://github.com/texlive
with only one repo, texlive-source, very old, last updated 2016.

There are no public members.

Anyone has an idea who is managing this organization?

Best

Norbert

If a file can't be found relative to the current directory, kpsewhich is 
used to find it, so bib2gls can find them in any location that kpsewhich 
searches.

I've just uploaded a new version to CTAN, but I'll add a note in the 
help for the next version.

Thanks.

Hi,
David (who is in the CC) reported a problem with getnonfreefonts:

 | Resolving www.tug.org... 94.23.251.76
 | Connecting to www.tug.org|94.23.251.76|:443... connected.
 | ERROR: The certificate of 'www.tug.org' is not trusted.

I can't reproduce the problem and when I examine the certificates
within Firefox I see that they're all up-to-date.

Can anybody explain how this can happen and how the problem can be
solved?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Reinhard,

I see the same problem with getnonfreefonts on my MacBook Pro

athena:Desktop tjk$ sudo getnonfreefonts --sys

! Error: Can't execute wget.



I did some research and found this


https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/09/13/LetsEncryptRootCertExpire/


So I _suspect_ the version of wget in use uses an older version of OpenSSL.

Perhaps wget might be using GnuTLS, but I am not sure of the Let's Encrypt

certificates will have a problem with GnuTLS.


In the meantime, I am going to build the most current wget with the most

current OpenSSL 1.1.1 and see how I fare.

To the best of my knowledge, the certificates on the user's machine have

I tried building the latest wget with the latest OpenSSL 1.1.1,
with the appropriate flags already set in the wget openssl support
code.  That is, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags is called with the param
X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST. but this did not take.  I now get this
instead:

SSL_INIT

Resolving www.tug.org (www.tug.org)... 94.23.251.76

Connecting to www.tug.org (www.tug.org)|94.23.251.76|:443... connected.

ERROR: The certificate of 'www.tug.org' is not trusted.

ERROR: The certificate of 'www.tug.org' has expired.


So the OpenSSL docs on how to work around this seems to be emitting

bogons.  Will look at it some more because it seems for this use case,

the weak link is the client code (in this case, wget),

I made an oopsie in my configure of wget - I was still using GnuTLS instead
of OpenSSL.
Now I have it configured with OpenSSL and get something a _little_ better

I am not sure how I can change the certificate chain that is used by
OpenSSL as I don't think
it uses the macOS system certificate chain.

OK, so I got something to work with wget, but it is very hack (at least on
macOS).  What I found most
interesting is that the system curl on macOS doesn't have this problem.
This seems to be a debacle.

Most likely I found that through GitHub code search. I have no idea who
owns the repo/org though.

It is possible to contact GitHub, asking for contacting the owner in
turn in case the project is 'shadowing' something important.  Norbert,
I suggest you go this route.

Message-ID: <YYhPGdXdQ2stJPr0@lenin.histomat.net>

I just installed TeXLive in a new box. It opearting system is devuan
(a fork of debian). I installed as user.

Everything seem to go well until I tried to use latex (a .tex file not
+recognized as TeX).


  $ latex text.tex
  This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.23 (TeX Live 2021) (preloaded

  I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

Another oddity. I start tlmgr gui and click on Backup. This is the error I get:L

Indeed the directory is missing. I hesitage simply to create it in the
fear that doing so hides a deeper problem.

I go to the tlmgr gui and do actions_>Rebuild all formates and get this error:

Irrelevant problem, you can create the dir.

That is a consequence of the above fmtutil.cnf

That calls the fmtutil from Debian/Ubuntu/Devuan, not the one from
/usr/local/texlive/2021.

Suggested steps depend on whether you *as user* have write access to
/usr/local/texlive/2021 or not.

If YES:
* remove /home/haines/.texlive2021/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
* run 
	fmtutils-sys --all

If NO:
* remove /home/haines/.texlive2021/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
* change to root user
* add /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/ to the PATH of the
  running shell (export PATH=/usr/local........:$PATH)
* run
	fmtutil-sys --all

Thank you for the response. I installed install-tl-unx* from 
/mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet and unpacked and archived it to 
get a install-tl-20211028 installer.
  
I thought I had installed it to user's accouint, but now see that it 
was installed in /usr/local:
 
  $ ls /usr/local/texlive
  2021  texmf-local 

  $ which latex
  /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/latex

No I did not create it and it is not there:

  $ ls /home/haines/.texlive2021
  ls: cannot access '/home/haines/.texlive2021': No such file or directory

Interesting. I did not install the debian package. But perhaps in 
bringing files over from an older installation of the operating system 
I dragged something in I shouldn't have.

but as noted I have no /home/haines/texlive2021 direxctory
 
Since I wanted to install LaTeX into user space I suspect I might just 
as well delete the exiisg LaTeX and reinstall it. Unless you have an 
interest in knowing the source of my problen, that is what I will do.

That is good.

That is also fine.

It often comes in as a dependency.

Can you send the full output of 
	fmtutil-sys --by-fmt latex
? At the top there should be something like this:


$ fmtutil-sys -byfmt latex
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf files (in precedence order):
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil: fmtutil is using the following fmtutil.cnf file for writing changes:
fmtutil:   /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-config/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
fmtutil [INFO]: writing formats under /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-var/web2c
fmtutil [INFO]: --- remaking latex with pdftex
fmtutil: running `pdftex -ini   -jobname=latex -progname=latex -translate-file=cp227.tcx *latex.ini' ...
....

That is the output I would expect.

And also please check the file
	/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
which should be there and contain several format definitions.

Best

... huuuu ... it doesn't find any fmtutil.cnf files????

Can you do
	mktexlsr /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/
and then run the above fmtutil-sys call again?
And if it works, 
	fmtutil-sys -all
too

Did all this and it seemt to have fixed the problem. At least I can 
run pdflatex on sample2e.tex and to get a PDF.

I thank you for your help. Muc apprecoated/

Hi

I've spent some time today thinking about how I can best contribute to
accessible mathematics in 2022, besides continuing to run the TeX Hour. My
conclusion is this: Contribute to an online accessible LaTeX math checker.

This is a personal conclusion based on my skills, interests, goals and
social status (I'm retired). At tomorrow's TeX Hour I'll explain what I
have in mind, and the thinking that got me there.

Thu 11 Nov: 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Title: Idea - an online accessible LaTeX math checker
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Here's a teaser. The earlier and better the feedback the author gets
regarding accessibility, the more motivation and encouragement they have to
improve the situation. To test my conclusion I did a web search:
https://www.google.com/search?q=latex+accessibility+math+checker

Here's some of the results I got:

https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahmto/elearning/latex/2019/05/06/accessibility-regulations.html
https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/digitalaccessibility/stemsubjects/
https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/c.php?g=995742&p=8207771

Here's some other links I found:

http://checkers.eiii.eu/en/pdfcheck/
https://umij.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/the-sad-state-of-pdf-accessibility-of-latex-documents/

I've a backlog of past TeX Hours to put up on YouTube. It will be cleared
soon.

Happy TeXing

Dear Tex-Live,

Hi! Thank you so much for offering this cool software!
I had an issue while I was installing the texlive 2021 in my win11 PC.
I am wondering if it could be installed in that environment.

Thanks!

Best,

Hi,

the developers certainkly want to make TeX Live work on Win11 but you
should be more specific about the issue. The problem may be in TeX
Live, it may be in your computer. So, please, give more information
and somebody will certainly reply. This list is the right place for
such reports.

Dear Jonathan,

I listened to your talk yesterday at Packaging-con and I found it riveting.
Is there any proof of concept of PTD yet?

In my own experience, the reproducible aspect of PTD is nicely solved by
Docker. I can accompany my document with the instruction that it should be
compiled using the following command:

    $ docker run --rm -v "$PWD"/workdir:/workdir -w /workdir
texlive/texlive:b0841883623e latexmk -pdf document.tex

This will reproducibly compile the file workdir/document.tex by ensuring
that any files outside workdir/ will be filled in from the immutable Docker
image of TeX Live with digest b0841883623e
<https://hub.docker.com/layers/texlive/texlive/latest/images/sha256-b0841883623ed059c46f94baf6b49eb9fdffc764e15fc8bd5cb5346ea02724c6?context=explore>.
Admittedly, this requires a 2G download. However, it is something that
works today, which I think has its value.

What you may also find useful is the Perl LaTeXMk tool that Overleaf uses
for the automatic compilation of documents. To know if any source files
have changed since the last compilation, LaTeXMk keeps a text database of
all dependencies by the inspection of LOG files. For example, if I run the
command latexmk -pdf source2e.tex, the attached file sample2e.fdb_latexmk
will be created and will contain a complete list of dependencies together
with last modified timestamps, file sizes, and hashes. Given a backing
store that can fetch these files, this text database seems almost
sufficient as a recipe for reproducibly recompiling the TeX document.

Best,
V?tek Novotn?

So I started on this today and I have forgotten the format of PL files.  I
see the CHARACTER  tokens, which have only a character code, not
a glyph name, so I need to sort that out between the PFB and TFM.  OK,
no problem there.  What is confusing is where does one get the horizontal
side bearing (hsbw in Type parlance) from the PL file?  I don't see that, I
only see CHARHT and CHARWD.

Please forgive my bad memory!

Hi Tom,
there are no hsbw values in tfm files.  They are derived from CHARWD
and converted from pt to bp.  At least this is what I assumed.

But there is a problem: The hsbw values in the Type 1 fonts seem to be
CHARWD values rounded to integers without being scaled from pt to bp.

This looks wrong to me but what confuses me is that all TeX engines
provide correct output though.

I hesitate to change anything before I groked completely what's
actually happening.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As Reinhard says, side bearing information (hsbw) is not present in
pl/tfm files, because side bearings are about where the glyph sits in
the box.  As we all know, pl/tfm are solely about the metrics
(height/width/depth/italic_correction box dimensions, kerns, ligatures),
and nothing at all about glyph shapes or positions.

In order to find the canonical "hsbw" for Metafont fonts it would be
necessary to look at a high-resolution gf/pk file. -k

I read over Thanh's paper on the making of the VNR fonts, and from what I
gather, only
the accents were made in METAFONT, and from there it was a cobbling
together of the
outlines from CMR fonts, the accents generated from METAFOG, etc.  As far
as I know,
there are no canonical .mf files for generating the Type 1 fonts that were
the end product.
This, of course, is subject to me being dense from having worked all week
on trying to get
a custom build of GCC for MinGW-w64.

I think I explained in a private mail why the unit transformation from
pt to bp is not necessary by showing an example of vnr12:

mftrace gives
/zero {
     41 489 hsbw

In this case, the size consistent with vnr12.tfm will be obtained
in vnr12.pfb scaled by 12*72/72.27.
(CHARWD R 0.489464) in vnr12.tfm is a ratio to the design size 12pt.
489 * 0.001 in vnr12.pfb is a ratio to 1bp.

PS: Here I have pfb's for all vnr fonts made by mftrace.
     I can send them as 11 small splitted files if one wants.

Best,
Akira

Thank you very much. I assumed canonical METAFONT sources. So my results are useless.
I discard them.

Message-ID: <CAG_eJLcG7BGfoALxm6S_3f0=q6+SU=x8Yq9X1Ryg6kUuufM7OQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am pleased to announce the start of a project to convert the AMS/CM fonts
in Type 1
format to OpenType/CFF using Adobe's AFDKO.

The public repository is here

https://github.com/tkacvins/CM_OTF

Feel free to add to it.  I can add contributors as necessary.

What is needed is testing, in particular if the fonts are OK with the
existing TFM files.
I am not quite sure how to get the TeX Live tools to use OpenType fonts.
In addition,
there are some options/input files missing from my initial creation of the
fonts that will
be addressed later as I figure them out.

Enjoy!  And please feel free to open issues (as necessary) on github and
give feedback
as to whether I did anything bone headed.

Testing

Ooops, the license needs to be taken care of.  The AMS license says all
derivative works
need to have the AMS license/copyright removed.  I am hoping that the AMS
approves
the distribution of the OTF flavors of their fonts with their copyright.
Thoughts?

It seems a recent color.sty added \@backslashchar, which is not defined in miniltx.tex. This breaks the use of the color package in eplain.

Adding its latex definition to miniltx.tex corrects the problem.

Another thing that needs to be taken care of is Unicode mappings in the
OTF.
makeotf is botching it when making the cmap table in the OTF fonts because
of the custom encodings of the amsfonts.  Things are not mapping properly.
There is a way around this using an optional file for makeotf that handles
the
glyph to code mapping, but I have had some problems even with that.  Still
trying to work it out with the AFDKO folks.

Tom ? Seeking to test the results of your project to convert the AMS/CM 
fonts in Type 1 format to OpenType/CFF using Adobe's AFDKO, I downloaded 
the contents of your Github repository 
(https://github.com/tkacvins/CM_OTF/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), 
expanded the contents thereof and installed (under Windows) just 
"cmr10.otf".? I then asked XeTeX to process the following :

> % !TeX Program=XeTeX
>
>
> \font \cmr = "cmr10"
>
> \cmr
>
> The quick brown fox jumps right over the laxy dog's back.
>
> \end
>
The TeXworks PDF previewer indicated that the resulting text scaled 
perfectly, so clearly the OTF file was being used (or so I thought).? I 
then amended the code to read :

> % !TeX Program=XeTeX
>
>
> \font \cmr = "cmr9"
>
> \cmr
>
> The quick brown fox jumps right over the laxy dog's back.
>
> \end
>
and found, to my complete surprise, that the text in cmr9 also scaled 
perfectly.? So my question is, "where is XeTeX finding a scaleable 
version of cmr9, when the only OTF file that I have installed from your 
suite is cmr10 ?".? "Start / Control Panel / Fonts" reveals that only 
"CMR 10 Regular" (of your font set) is installed, and a search under 
"C:\TeX\Live\2021" finds only :

> cmr9.afm
> cmr9.mf
> cmr9.pfb
> cmr9.pfm
> cmr9.t3
> cmr9.tfm

Is it possible that XeTeX is using the PFB version and ignoring the 
string quotes around "cmr9" that should force it to use a system font, 
and if so, must I write (/e.g.,/) \font \cmr = "[cmr10.otf]" to force 
XeTeX to use /only/ your OTF versions and to report "Font not found" if 
the relevant font(s) is/are not installed ?? TeX Live and XeTeX lists

Hello, I twice tried to install on Debian linux 11.1, using perl
install-tl retrieving from the internet.
Each time, after the download completed, it would give an error message:

running mktexlsr /mnt/data/texlive/2021/texmf-dist ...

The permissions on
/mnt/data/texlive/2021/texmf-dist are drwxr-xr-x
/mnt/data/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/scripts/mktexlsr are -rwxr-xr-x. .

Googling finds some mktexlsr related installation failures, but I do
not see any with "permission denied".

Any suggestions?

Hi,

the situation is a bit complex. Debian offers its own Debian packages
installable by aptitude which is generally run by root. However, you
can also download TeX Live from TUG and install it and i this case it
is recommended to do it as a normal user. You have to choose an
install path which is writable by the user. Now suppose that you
already have some traces of TeX Live installation and it was done by
root or mktexlsr was once done by root. It means that the directories,
e.g. $TEXMFLOCAL, already contain ls-R files. Now you run mktexlsr as
a normal user which wants to create and/or update ls-R files but they
are already owned by root which causes "permission denied". The remedy
is to inspect your system. If you find ls-R files owned by root,
change their ownership, mktexlsr will then run. In the future make
sure not to run mktexlsr on these directories as root because it will
create the same problem again.

Don't ask how many times it happend to me...

As Zdenek said, it is most probably file remainders that are hurting
you.

Can you reproduce the problem with first doing
	rm -rf /mnt/data/texlive/2021
and THEN installing TeX Live?

Other options that come to my mind are some kind of higher level access
protection (AppArmor etc).

Thank you Norbert, Zdenek, Karl:

1. The target filesystem was inadvertently mounted noexec. I have
remounted and will try again.

2. Is there any way to restart an install without redoing the
successful downloads?

3. Does 'ls-R file' mean a file named 'ls-R' ?

Thanks,
Philip

That was 99% probability the case.

But since you have everything installed already, you should be fine with
doing
	export PATH=/data/.....bin/YOURARCH/:$PATH
	mktexlsr
	updmap-sys
	fmtutil-sys --all

I guess ..

Yes.

The string quotes don't have any special meaning in XeTeX. The font name
is read using TeX's normal file scanning routine which (at least for TeX
Live) uses string quotes to allow embedding spaces in the name and then
discards them. Therefore they never reach the parts of XeTeX where the
decision between system fonts and classical fonts is made.

If you want to load the font by fontname, you can try to add a colon
instead to add an empy feature string. Then the TFM file isn't found. So
you would have e.g. `\font \cmr = "cmr10:"` (I haven't checked if the
font is actually found by that name, but if you have an OpenType font
with fontname cmr10 installed than this would work)

Looking at the code again I realized that the quotes actually *do* make
a difference: If the name is quoted XeTeX will first look for a system
font and use a TFM font only if no system font is found, if the name is
not quoted it will forst look for a TFM font.

If you want a IMO clearer syntax, you can use LuaTeX with luaotfload.
There we still emulate the XeTeX like syntax, but additionally allow you
explicitly state how the font should be looked up, e.g.

\font \cmr {name:cmr10} \cmr % Untested, LuaTeX with luaotfload only.
                             % Quotes would work too.
                             % So would omitting both in this case.

If you use name based lookup, you have to specify the actual font name.
According to otfinfo this is for cmr10.otf:

% otfinfo -i cmr10.otf
Family:              CMR10
Subfamily:           Regular
Full name:           CMR10
PostScript name:     CMR10
Version:             Version 1.000;hotconv 1.1.0;makeotfexe 2.6.0
Unique ID:           1.000;UKWN;CMR10
Vendor ID:           UKWN

As you can see, neither of the names is "CMR10 Regular" and also not
"cmr10". In luaotfload the lookup is case insensitive, but XeTeX uses
system libraries which will often be case sensitive.

Well, if the same happens in luaotfload please write a bug report. If
you want someone to tell you that XeTeX's font lookup rules are nice,
consistent or intuitive you are talking with the wrong person...

Looking at the code again I realized that the quotes actually *do* make
a difference: If the name is quoted XeTeX will first look for a system
font and use a TFM font only if no system font is found, if the name is
not quoted it will forst look for a TFM font.

If you want a IMO clearer syntax, you can use LuaTeX with luaotfload.
There we still emulate the XeTeX like syntax, but additionally allow you
explicitly state how the font should be looked up, e.g.

\font \cmr {name:cmr10} \cmr % Untested, LuaTeX with luaotfload only.
                             % Quotes would work too.
                             % So would omitting both in this case.

Sadly failed at first hurdle :  \input luaotfload -> "I can't find file 'luaotfload'".

Ignoring that, zillions of other errors which do not occur when using XeTeX (see attachments).  To the best of your belief, is there a standard LuaTeX file which can be input that will then cause LuaTeX to faithfully emulate the behaviour of XeTeX ?  I ask because all of my work is predicated on the use of XeTeX and the assumption that it can exploit any and all of XeTeX's documented features.

Well, if the same happens in luaotfload please write a bug report. If

Fair enough !

Try: \input luaotfload.sty

The file can be loaded with LuaLaTeX (via \usepackage/\RequirePackage) as well
as LuaTeX (using \input).

Some of your other problems can be solved loading luatex85.sty. But not all of
them.

Hi

I'm gathering projects for 2022. Last week I spoke about creating an
accessibility checker for  the source files for LaTeX documents. Also last
week I gave my talk on Portable TeX Documents (PTD) at the very first
PackagingCon. That's also going to be a 2022 project for me.

Thu 18 Nov: 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Title: Portable TeX Documents - next steps
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is focussed on exploring next steps for Portable TeX
Documents. I think the social and community aspects will be as important as
the technical side. The abstract and links to the slides and the video
recording (21 minutes) are available on the conference webpage for my PTD
talk.
https://pretalx.com/packagingcon-2021/talk/XTAJ7Z/

There won't be a TeX Hour next week (Thu 25 Nov), as in the US it's
Thanksgiving, which is one of their major public holidays (celebrated with
a hearty lunch including pumpkin pie). So the TeX Hour will resume on Thu 2
December, with a focus on Beginners.

By the way, the TeX Hour monthly cycle is:

1st Thu: Beginners
2nd Thu: Accessibility
3rd Thu: Conversions
4th Thu: Durable documents
5th Thu: EXplore and EXperiments

Happy TeXing

Subject: tinytex "signature verification error"
Message-ID: <CAMkqB1pTFMZfjcL+LVAAYWc5DwTARsT=f3SppjRvT=ggiv4kdQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Tex Live,
I had a sudden problem with knitting my Rmd document to pdf with tinytex.
It's been working fine until today (last successful knit of the same Rmd
was yesterday).

All my R packages and Rstudio are up to date.
I also updated tinytex.
Still the problem persists.

I have used half a day now googling this problem, but can't seem to find a
solution that works.

latex engine is xelatex if that helps

Here is the error:

Hi

> <https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet> (verified)[1/1,

So that worked, one package was installed correctly ...

So my guesses are:
* you are using the main server instead of the mirror network.
  *This* *is* *bad* and tinytex should not do this.
* As a consequence, and since tinytex tries to install one package
  after the other, I guess you got blocked from the main server
  due to excessive connects (connection numbers etc are limited on the
  server), thus you get the error message since the asc file doesn't
  contain the actual signature data, but an error message.

My suggestion: use mirror.ctan.org instead, that is much better and
should also install faster.

Best

Norbert

    * you are using the main server instead of the mirror network.

And, when downloading a file (as opposed to looking at a directory) from
ctan.org/tex-archive/whatever, CTAN itself will redirect to a mirror.
And it will choose different mirrors for different files, since there
can be no concept of "session" there.

    My suggestion: use mirror.ctan.org instead, 

I think so too. Then tlmgr will be able to reuse the same mirror for all
the downloads. -k

Thank you for your responses.

I'm a n00b, so I didn't really know how to choose another mirror when
installing tinytex in RStudio, but I found this command in Yihui's
troubleshooting comments at https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging, so for
anyone else having a similar mirror problem, I chose another mirror by
running Yihui's code:

tinytex::install_tinytex(repos = '
http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/systems/texlive/tlnet')
(I guess you could insert whatever working mirror instead).

It installed whatever was needed and knits nicely again now. Thank you and
good day to you, Sirs :)

All the best,
Mikkel

Hi,

as Norbert wrote, mirror.ctan.org is the best place. It is not a
particular server but it automatically finds a server closest to you.

Within Europe, it is more a question of connection time and physical
connectivity, not of actual distance. So that might be the reason you
have been redirected to comedy.

But why do you worry? If you don't trust the algorithm, just select your
preferred mirror and be done.

I don't care which server in East Asia I am getting connected to.

I "worry", Norbert, because I like to understand, rather than just use tools blindly.  The same reason, really, that I use Plain [Xe]TeX rather than LaTeX, so that I can have a complete understanding of what I am doing and how it is accomplished.

As Norbert wrote, the metrics is not measured in miles or kilometres.
If I use CTAN from my office, it always directs me to the mirror at
the Czech Technical University which is physically about 4 km of an
optical cable. This means that I have guaranteed 1 Gbps and the
slowest point is writing to my HD. When I do the same from my home i
Prague, it depends whether the ISP has better connectivity to PASNET
or to CESNET. In the latter case it is better to use the mirror at
Masaryk University in Brno. And the connectivity can change, it is not
the same every day.

Dear Phil,
tracert (or traceroute on Unix) is simply the wrong tool.

mirror.ctan.org and comedy.dante.de is actually one and the same
machine (IP 5.35.249.60), the machine which redirects your requests.
What traceroute returns is *not* the machine you are directed to.

When I enter

  https://mirror.ctan.org/

in the URL field of my web browser several times successively I'm
directed to

  https://mirror.informatik.hs-fulda.de/tex-archive/
  https://packages.oth-regensburg.de/ctan/
  https://ctan.mirror.norbert-ruehl.de/
  https://mirror.dogado.de/tex-archive/

Please try yourself.  I'm confident that you're redirected to a mirror
nearby too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

OK, understood. So (strictly speaking)

mirror.ctan.org [...] automatically finds a server closest to you.

is not true, but :

https://mirror.ctan.org [...] automatically finds a server closest to you.

would be.  I.e., the "finding of the closest server" is not a function of the DNS but of the server response to an http(s) request initially sent to mirror.ctan.org.  Would you agree with that ?

This project is going to be on hold for a while.  I need to sort some stuff
out with
the American Mathematical Society about what I've done and where this is
going
to go.

I have some ideas on what I want to do and where I'd like this to go, but
that is
yet to be sorted out with the AMS.

Subject: TinyYAML available in CTAN since October 2
Message-ID: <20211120163829.qcapmqslmzo3s2h5@inspiron>

Dear all,

this is to let you know that CTAN includes the TinyYAML Lua library [1]
from the Apache APISIX project [2] since the release of Markdown 2.11.0
on October 2 [3].

 [1]: https://github.com/api7/lua-tinyyaml
 [2]: https://apisix.apache.org/
 [3]: https://ctan.org/ctan-ann/id/mailman.4254.1633189642.2581.ctan-ann at ctan.org

You can use the library in your work to parse YAML documents, see the
below example. A more complete demonstration of the library should
appear in TUGboat 43:1.

    $ cat > document.yaml
    title: 'This is a title: with a colon'
    authors:
    - Jane Doe
    - John Doe
    year: 2021
    abstract: |
      This is the abstract
      
      It contains two paragraphs.

    $ cat > script.lua
    local kpse = require('kpse')
    kpse.set_program_name('luatex')

    local ty = require('markdown-tinyyaml')
    local file = io.open('document.yaml', 'r')
    local text = file:read('*a')
    local data = ty.parse(text)

    print('The document is titled *'
       .. data.title .. '*.')
    print('It has ' .. #data.authors
       .. ' authors: '
       .. table.concat(data.authors, ' and ')
       .. '.')
    print('It was written one year after '
       .. (data.year - 1) .. '.')
    print('Its abstract starts with *'
       .. data.abstract:sub(0, 20) .. ' ?*')

    $ texlua script.lua
    The document is titled *This is a title: with a colon*. It has
    2 authors: Jane Doe and John Doe. It was written one year after
    2020. Its abstract starts with *This is the abstract ...*

Yes, it's a script running on the DANTE web server.  But I don't think
that the exact wording is important here because all this redirection
stuff is about HTTP requests.  You will not be redirected when you
contact the DANTE staff by email though the DNS name is the same.

Subject: Using tlmgr.bat under bash on MS-Windows
Message-ID: <86bl2c2xif.fsf@gnu.org>

Hi all,

I use bash packaged with Msys2 on MS-Windows.  All .exe file provided by
TeXlive run without problems in a bash shell.  One thing that doesn't
run for obvious reasons is tlmgr.bat, alas, I have to open a cmd box to
update TeXlive.  Here is a one-line wrapper for bash to run tlmgr.bat:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
#!/bin/sh

# This is a small wrapper around tlmgr.bat in order to use it under
# bash from Msys2.  Note the double // for escaping /
cmd.exe //c tlmgr.bat "$@"; exit $?
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

I'm not sure if it makes sense to add this to TeXlive for Windows.  But
maybe it helps others.

Best, Arash

With WSL you can use TeX Live in linux.   I work with multi-author projects
so have reason to format "problematic" documents on both Windows and
specific linux distros, so I have noticed that linux-64 TL is much faster
than
win32 TL (despite the generally poor I/O performance in WSL).   The one
annoyance is that in native linux you can have a PDF document open in a
linux viewer and generate a new version. For  Windows Adobe viewers you
have to close the PDF view first.

It is unclear to me what the underlying reason for this discrepancy is.? 
Using (e.g.,) MS Word, I can save an MS Word document as Adobe PDF.? If 
the previously-saved version is open in Adobe Acrobat (or in Adobe 
Acrobat Reader), MS Word forces the PDF to close and then re-opens the 
newly-saved version.? It seems to me that the TeX sub-system ought to be 
able to accomplish the same thing.

Thanks for your response.  Yes, trying out WSL is on my list :-)

On Windows, I suggest you give SumatraPDF[1] a try.  It is fast, doesn't
lock the .pdf file (as Adobe Acrobat does) and has support for SyncTeX.

The whole philosophy of file system access is different. In Windows
the open file is locked and other applications are not allowed to
modify it, hence the TeX drivers are not allowed to write a PDF if a
previous version is open. In Linux overwriteing of a file is allowed
even if it is currently open. There are three scenarios:

1. The application monitors the file, notices that it was modified and
loads a new version automatically
2. The application monitors the file and if a modification was
detected, it asks the user whether to reload the file
3. The application stil works with the original file (technically it
has its own inode in memory)

Scenario 3 has its advantages. Once I downloaded a few videos and
tried to view them and decide whether I want to keep them on my
computer or delete them. I decided to delete all but the one currently
open in the viewer but by mistake I deleted the whole directory. I
paused the viewer not to loose the one video. Linux tools allow me to
obtain that internal inode and using it copy the deleted file from the
deleted directory to another location.

To summarize: in Linux the PDF creating application thus overwrites
the file assuming that the viewer can monitor it and reload. In
Windows the PDF creator must know in which application the PDF is open
and must know how to communicate with it. Of course, it is possible to
develop a viewer which will emulate the Linux way even in windows but
it is a matter of the viewer.

I do appreciate, Zden?k, that how these things work in Linux and in 
Windows are different, but that was not my point.? If MS Word can 
generate and display a new PDF when the previous PDF is already open in 
Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Acrobat Reader, then surely it must be possible 
for a Windows-based TeX tool chain (e.g., TeXworks + XeTeX) to do the 
same.? Would you not agree ?

That depends.  MS could be using some undocumented procedure to
command Acrobat to close the file.

Way Back When there was (apparently) a package called pdfopen or
pdfclose which would help people work around MS's intransigence.
However, I don't see any evidence of it on CTAN (with my one search
attempt) and also there is this
        https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/85867/pdfopen-pdfclose-dont-work-with-acrobat-adobe-reader-xi
which may or may not be interesting.

Both had the intended and desired effect, although errors were reported 
to/via CMD.

If MS Word can generate and display a new PDF when the previous PDF is already open in Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Acrobat Reader, then surely it must be possible for a Windows-based TeX tool chain (e.g., TeXworks + XeTeX) to do the same.  Would you not agree ?

In principle it is possible. It will be necessary to implement the IPC
with Acrobat in all drivers (pdftex, xdvipdfmx, ps2pdf from
ghostscript). and if the file is open in a different PDF viewer, it
will probably not work. I think that some external tools can do it.

Which application exactly should do it? Do you really expect
pdflatex to sent dde commands?

It makes imho more sense to delegate this task to the editor. My
editor, winedt, executes the needed commands and so close the pdf if
needed. (I normally use sumatra for viewing which doesn't lock the
pdf, but if I need the Adobe reader to check some feature sumatra
can't handle I can use it.)

Of course not.? PdfLaTeX's task is to /generate /PDFs, not to display them.

I spoke of "the TeX sub-system", by which I included (of course) 
utilities such as WinEDT, TeXworks, etc.

Don't forget arara, ltxmake, etc. In my experience, the problem is the
Adobe
version specific string that needs to get set when a user installs a new
Adobe PDF viewer.

I think many TeX... users view generated PDF's in a web browser.  Since
many documents will be viewed in browsers by the target audience, that
makes a lot of sense.   For me, on Windows 10 Firefox, I can view a new
version by reloading it.

Subject: [tl2021/texdoc] texdoc reporting spurious error on Windows
Message-ID: <20211125174443.z2tqpvhmwnyqr75a@math.berkeley.edu>

Doing (on Windows with stock TexLive2021) 
    texdoc -D texdoc
gives a lot of messages irrelevant to this discussion (but which include
    
   texdoc debug-config: Setting "viewer_pdf=sumatraPDF" from environment variable "PDFVIEWER_texdoc".
   texdoc debug-config: Ignoring "viewer_pdf=sumatraPDF" from environment variable "PDFVIEWER".

), then does

  texdoc debug-view: Using "viewer_pdf" to open the file.
  texdoc info: View command: sumatraPDF "d:\programs\texlive\2021.local\texmf-dist\doc\support\texdoc\texdoc.pdf"
  texdoc info: Setting environment LC_CTYPE to: English_United States.1252
  texdoc error: Failed to execute: sumatraPDF "d:\programs\texlive\2021.local\texmf-dist\doc\support\texdoc\texdoc.pdf"

The documentation is open successfully (by sumatraPDF!), but the last
error line is produced even without ?-D? flag.

  (I have
      PDFVIEWER=sumatraPDF
      PDFVIEWER_texdoc=sumatraPDF
   in environment.)

Hope this helps,
Ilya
