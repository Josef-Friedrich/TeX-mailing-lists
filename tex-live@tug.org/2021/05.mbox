Subject: type1 fonts in sample fontconfig
In-Reply-To: <CAEW6iOi=T3WxM4bYAkCYdCsJ-hkV=6eUqhPxcEpyYxNOnRjz-A@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <202104302238.13UMcHpq015925@freefriends.org>

Hi David - belatedly ...

    [ https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2021-April/046700.html ]

    dvipdfmx is loading the type1 font from
    /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/google/noto/NotoSerif-Regular.pfb
    rather than the truetype version.
    [...]
    as the fontconfig is (I think?) just for xelatex, is it useful to include
    the type1 directory at all?

In principle yes, as there are fonts only available as Type1.

In practice maybe not, since it's improbable that anyone would want to
access those Type1-only fonts as system fonts. I seem to recall
that some systems have dropped support for Type 1 as system fonts.

    Possibly separately would it be possible for xdvipdfmx to only use the
    type1 font if no matching truetype or opentype is found?

Sure, that would be better.  Question is whether the fontconfig api
allow specifying the format that get returned.  I have a vague
impression that the search is based only on names and if two fonts have
the same name, it's not controllable which gets returned. Thus, xetex
might get the ttf and dvipdfmx get the t1 (or you might get the ttf one
year and the t1 the next), but it can't be solved by us. In which case
removing the /type1 line from our sample fontconfig would be indicated.

In principle, XeTeX and dvipdfmx should always load the same font with
the same fontconfig. This failing to happen has been the source of
myriad problems over the years.

    I had a test file

Can you send your test file with failing fontconfig.conf to
dvipdfmx at tug.org please? So Shunsaku et al. can investigate whether
something has changed and/or can be fixed.

    xdvipdfmx:fatal: Invalid font: -1 (0)

A more informative error message would be useful too. At least including
something about the name of the font being looked up.

    np> I strongly advise not including any toplevel directory
    of the texmf-dist/fonts/XXX into fontconfig - 

Our sample file fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf doesn't have any
reasonable alternative to including the top-level directories, it seems
to me.

    I have seen several bad
    breakages with strange fonts making fontconfig stumble.

Me too. Of course it would be nice if those bugs could be fixed. -k

Hi Robert,

    However, when accessing the mirror.ctan.org link, tlmgr explicitly calls
    wget, not curl:

Ah yes, I forgot that the initial resolution of mirror.ctan.org to some
actual mirror requires special arguments and parsing of the output, so
we can't support arbitrary downloaders there.

However, Norbert just cooked up a function to support curl for this
purpose, and we changed the resolution to prefer using curl to wget.

The change (in TLUtils.pm) will be in tlcritical after tonight's
build. It would be nice if you and/or anyone else could test this,
especially on Macs, since that is where it's most likely to make a
difference (and where it's easiest to specifying using tlcritical).
https://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html#tlcritical

If there's some kind of confirmation, or after a while, I'll push it out
to the live repository. --thanks, karl.

I am now back on the default https repository, and everything seems to 
work fine. Thanks for the fix!

Even a third attempt to install TL on a Win10 machine failed because I
keep getting errors of that kind:

Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:

or
  install-tl-advanced.bat --profile installation.profile [YOUR-EXTRA-ARGS]

Since I don't see what I'm doing wrong I wanted to let you know. At the
moment I'm kind of desperate and I don't see a solution.

I can confirm this behaviour. Several of my students had the same effect
on their windows machine. Using

tlmgr --force --reinstall install ....

solved the problem

This may be `version skew': a checksum listed in the downloaded
database may be outdated by the time a particular package is
actually downloaded.

Just try again. You could this time also first go to Advanced mode
and then select a smaller scheme; you can always install additional
packages later.

Ok. But will this trigger all the necessary post-install actions? Create
formats etc.? The installer does a lot of things after the download of
packages.

If you have that problem in an install of TL you have todo? several actions
by yourselve. We had the problem with texlive-scripts and today with 
easybook
and some other packages.

Yes, I got it during a fresh install and the process dies away before
any of the post-actions started. So there's actually nothing but the
downloaded packages. If it happend during update I would not worry too
much and simply retry.

Maybe I wait until tomorrow and hope that the problem vanishes. It seems
to be pretty reproducible because I got it with easybook and
texlive-scripts, too.

If it is a problem with a mirror then you can manually select a
mirror by adding a -select-repository option to the installer.

Just to report back: The problem remains unchanged, and it still happens
with the 'easybook' package. Therefore, I don't think it's a mirror
problem.

But I wonder if it is specific to Win10 because I don't observe it in my
daily updates on Win7 machines.

Anyway. I will try now with a smaller scheme.

After a number of attempts that I made during the last three days my
conclusion is that install goes smooth with ftp mirrors while https
mirrors show the reported issue. I can reproduce it like that.

Having that said, I got the same error on an ftp mirror with
'latex-bin-dev'.

Sigh!

I have no problems to *update* on win10. easybook got updated today,
and it worked fine. 

Do you have some virus protection active or similar which could
interfere?

I did *updates* on Win7 machines with no problems. Also easybook got
updated several times during the last days, with no problems.

I'm facing all that trouble with an *install from scratch* on a Win10
machine.

There is Sophos anti-virus installed, but during TeXLive install I
disable on-access scans and "Verhaltens?berwachung".

Hi

The topic for tomorrow's TeX Hour is bibliographies for beginners. We're
pleased to welcome Patrick Daly, author of the widely used natbib package.
He'll give us the history of natbib, and answer questions. The focus will
be on the Beginner experience.

The meeting is Thursday 29 April, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time. The time now in
the UK is at https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+time. The zoom link for the
meeting is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

The TeX Hour has a monthly cycle for its topics.

First Thursday: Beginners
Second Thursday: Accessibility
Third Thursday: Conversion (eg LaTeX to PDF, LaTeX to HTML, markdown to
LaTeX)
Fourth Thursday: Durable Documents (same outputs give same input across
space and time)
Fifth Thursday: Experiments and Exploration.

We hope later in the month to have a more technical reference management
TeX Hour, either as Conversion or Durable Documents.

Last week's TeX Hour was Experiments and Exploration. As an experiment I
didn't record anything, and then afterwards myself, Arthur Ogawa and
Phillip Helbig stayed on for an extra 4 hours! So it was an after-hours
party of sorts. During that time Arthur and I had some conversations, which
we recorded. Mostly, they give a long view of the history of TeX.

Here's the links.

Yes, I understood that, that's why I emphasized update. But it means
that the package itself is probably not a problem. 

I normally use warwick as mirror and that works fine, 
https://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet


but I now tried to switch to ctan org to install easybook from there
and got a signature error.:

C:\texlive\2021\texmf-dist\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl: signature
verification error of
C:\Users\NILILA~1\AppData\Local\Temp\okQMoEFlpt\Gvg9hkk8ko from

against

failed. Output was:
gpg: Signature made 05/04/21 01:54:45 using RSA key ID 19438C70
gpg: BAD signature from "TeX Live Distribution <tex-live at tug.org>"

And when using it "on-the-fly" with --repository I got a checksum
error:

C:\texlive\2021\texmf-dist\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl: checksum error
when downloading
C:\Users\NILILA~1\AppData\Local\Temp\_vdXq9Rjqo\hksJGOowYd from
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb:

So it could be a problem with this mirror.

here. But let me report what I observed today. Maybe it helps someone to
track it down.

I've tried several mirrors (all from Germany, selected from the
installer's drop-down menu) and I saw this checksum error with all of
them (GWDG, Chemnitz, Erlangen).

Then I chose the one and only ftp mirror in this list (Berlin). With
this mirror I got the checksum error on different packages (easybook
worked, but latex-bin-dev bombed, ...).

Somewhat tired of trying over and over again I did what Siep suggested.
Install medium scheme and complete everything afterwards. I chose the
GWDG mirror again and it worked fine. No errors.

That's odd. It looks like there's a difference between the installer
(failed) and a post-install call of tlmgr in order to install missing
packages (worked).

The dict command was introduced in tcl 8.5.  Do you have a different
PATH as sudoer than as a regular user, and a stray obsolete Tcl/Tk
8.4 on your regular searchpath? That is the only explanation that
occurs to me.

Message-ID: <CAM6y5tfSA+h-UB7bwBzFVXM0Roq_Y0C0nRWLWSU7zsaw47HtUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I may have hit a bug in tlmgr. As it is, when I try reading a remote
repository in a file:// url, or just a local folder really, for instance

  tlmgr --repository file://${repo} dump-tlpdb --remote

I get `Cannot load TeX Live database`.

>From what I can tell, download_file in TLUtils.pm is ignoring the file name
in the $dest argument, and that breaks file:// urls, at least in the way I
am using them. Indeed, it all works as I'd expect if I replace

  copy ($filetoopen, $par)

with

  copy ("-f", $filetoopen, $dest)

at
https://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm?revision=59044&view=markup#l2753

Does that make sense?

    That's odd. It looks like there's a difference between the installer
    (failed) and a post-install call of tlmgr in order to install missing
    packages (worked).

Differing behavior of install-tl and tlmgr seems quite possible to me.

I speculate that it is somehow related to the recent https-only
resolution of https://mirror.ctan.org now, and/or https downloads. E.g.,
texlive.tlpdb is being retrieved from one mirror but then the actual
package downloads happen from another, which is not in sync. This would
cause the problems you're seeing. (E.g., easybook changes nearly every day.)

For debugging, what would be most helpful is if you can find a
reproducible path that causes the problem. In this case, reproducible
would include specifying a particular mirror with -repository, since the
results of mirror.ctan.org are by definition unreproducible.

We've made a few changes in this regard in tlcritical, not yet pushed
out to tlnet. If you can try using tlcritical for testing, that would be
helpful. Otherwise I guess I'll push the changes to tlnet anyway (after
tonight).

One of the changes was to add more debugging of the mirror resolution.
So using install-tl -vv or tlmgr -vv would be helpful. There will be a
lot of output.

Thanks,
Karl

The problem still occurs, but finding a "reproducible path" is
difficult. Also, I don't know how to use tlcritical during an install
from scratch.

Howsoever, it sounds like you identified cause and effect correctly. I'd
trust the changes you made even without testing :-)

Hello all,

my luajittex binary (Windows 64 from http://w32tex.org) is in a

can't get luajittex to start:

Is there a way around this?

As your question is addressed to the TeX Live list, I assume that you 
are using TeX Live, in which case I would expect all TeX binaries to be 
in a directory ending ...\bin\win32 (or possibly ...\bin\win64).? Is 
there any particular reason why you chose to place your luajittex binary 
in such an unusual and non-standard location ?

Like Phil Taylor, I am a bit puzzled about your chosen location. In
order to find all its files, TeX depends on a particular directory
structure, with the actual exe files in <installation root>bin\win32
or in <installation root>bin\win64 for the 64bit binaries.

If you HAVE to install in your home-directory-with-accents, rather
than in the root of the C:-drive, then you can assign a drive letter
to it with the subst command:

subst X: C:\Users\gr??er

and remove the drive letter again with

subst X: /d

You can make the drive letter permanent with a registry entry:

reg add HKCU\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v "X Drive" /d "subst: C:\Users\gr??er"

Hello Siep,

thanks. But I assume this to be an error in the binary. So I wonder if
there is a way of fixing the binary (probably the SearchPath() macro)
instead of manipulating the windows registry.

Another follow-up, because there is confusion about the location
outside of a texlive tree.

The problem is that executing the binary does not work when inside a
path with accents and using the full path name (on Windows 64bit). The
same setup works fine on Linux and Mac.

For a full TeX run more than just running the binary is needed, that is clear.

My setup is that I use the LuaTeX binary with a very custom format and
setup which can then be located anywhere in the file system. Which
works fine on all systems except for the given situation.

Thanks for sorting this out so quickly!

And on further inspection, I think it should be

  copy ("-f", "-L", $filetoopen, $dest);

in case texlive.tlpdb.xz is a symbolic link, which might happen in the
experiments I am doing. Maybe not in real life, though.

At any rate, the symlink issue is easy to work around ? just copy the file
in place ? so it's pretty minor. Sorry for noticing right after you
committed "-f"!

Well, the installer should carry the latest changes from tlcritical,
this is what makes me concerned ... the texlive.infra is in tlcritical,
but our installer is always based on the files in svn.

After todays "update --self", I can confirm that all is well again on 
Catalina. "--verify-repo=none" is no longer necessary and "update --all" 
works fine.

      ??? Fontconfig error: No writable cache directories

Seems like this error would be coming from the system? It's not like
tlmgr tries to call fontconfig while updating packages (or ever, as far
as I recall). Is it repeatable? I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

In any event, I can't think of any changes we've made that would change
this. Maybe you, or some process, cleaned up some "cache directories"
(whatever they are)? --best, karl.

Hi Uwe,

> The problem still occurs

just a question ... are you getting a **new** installer package every
time you try this? We are updating the installer daily with the files
from tlcritical, so you need to use always the latest one!

Yes, I did so. I always fetched install-tl.zip from one of the mirrors
in Germany, unpacked, and run install-tl-windows.bat as Administrator.

If it helps I can try it out again. There's TL21 installed on all of my
machines. But if I choose a different directory and if I un-select menu
entries and path modification it should not interfere with an existing
installation, right?

I think that I fixed the above feature.
In TeX Live, new binaries will be given in TeX Live 2022.
You said that you were using W32TeX. In this case, you are able to
obtain new binaries from a suitable W32TeX mirror in a few days.
A time stamp of archives should be 2021/05/09 (JST) or later.

Thanks,
Akira

The same problem has been discussed in the thread "Install fails due to
errors in temp directory" from Tuesday.

Too bad it's still there. But what helped me was the advice given by
Siep. Install "scheme small" first (in the hope that the packages that
are out of sync are not included) and after successful install restart
TeX Shell and install "scheme full" (or whatever scheme you would like
to have). This worked for me.

Also uncheck file associations, or try a portable setup.

Subject: TEX-capacity, font inclusion
Message-ID: <1ABC6FBF-493F-4563-B5BC-9F135C058A30@bluewin.ch>

Hi,

	May I ask whether there is a deeper reason why TEX-capacity can
	apparently not be increased beyond the following (anachronically
	small values) in the file /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf.cnf ?

		main_memory	= 12000000
		extra_mem_bot	= 12000000
		font_mem_size	= 12000000
		pool_size	= 12000000
		buf_size	= 12000000

	These values allow the creation of the attached fractal using
	tabular-environments but not down to greater recursion depths.

	Then, may I further ask how to ensure the inclusion of
	all font information in TEX-created PDF-files?

Thank you and best regards,

	-- Simon

Thanks for the fix and my apologies that I didn't check the other files
:-(  I'm not an arabtex user but it seems that hebtex.tex is also needed
at runtime.  Packages install.txt says[1]:

Subdirectory "texinput": (ASCII files)
----------------------
arabtex.sty     LaTeX 2e package, LaTeX 2.09 style option: driver 
arabtex.tex     loader and patches for use with Plain TeX
hebtex.tex      Hebrew mode: loader for use with Plain TeX

So I suggest to move hebtex.tex back into texmf-dist/tex/latex/arabtex/.

Best, Arash

Hi Siep, hi Uwe, hi Berkan, hi all,

That is the problem, and this SHOULD NOT HAPPEN!!!

When doing this on Linux, I see
$ ./install-tl -no-cls
Loading https://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
Installing TeX Live 2021 from: https://ftp.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)

So I install from an actual mirror, while on Windows it seems to always
hit the main mirror.

And that one might have restrictions on access and block, thus the
failures.

We need to investigate why the redirection code doesn't work on
Windows!!!

Questions that can be answer by passing -v or -v -v to the installer:
* is it using wget or curl for computing the redirection?
* which curl is used?
* does curl work as expected? What does
	curl -Ls -o nul -w '%{url_effective}' https://mirror.ctan.org/
  give?
  (IDEA: the quotes might be a problem on Windows??? If the above fails,
  what does
	curl -Ls -o nul -w %{url_effective} https://mirror.ctan.org/
  give?)

If someone could test these items it would be helpful!

Thanks

Norbert

Ahhh ... interesting ... so we get these extra quotes here which is not
good!!

Can you try
	curl -Ls -o nul -w %{url_effective} https://mirror.ctan.org/
does that work or are quotes necessary around the %... stuff?

Hi Uwe, all those with problems.

Could you please IN THE INSTALLER
	install-tl-20210508/tlpkg/TeXLive
replace the TLUtils.pm with the attached one, and retry?

It should show an actual mirror not the main "mirror.ctan.org" for the
installation location.

Thanks

Norbert

It does try a number of mirrors:

D:querying mirror, got 'https://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/software/tex/'
D:querying mirror, got 'https://mirror.koddos.net/CTAN/'
D:querying mirror, got 'https://mirror.koddos.net/CTAN/'
D:querying mirror, got 'https://mirror.lyrahosting.com/CTAN/'
D:querying mirror, got 'https://mirror.koddos.net/CTAN/'
D:no mirror found ... randomly selecting backbone
Loading https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

but is not happy with any of them.

With both syntaxes, I get an actual mirror:

C:\Users\siepo>curl -Ls -o nul -w '%{url_effective}' https://mirror.ctan.org/
'https://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/software/tex/'
C:\Users\siepo>curl -Ls -o nul -w %{url_effective} https://mirror.ctan.org/
https://mirror.lyrahosting.com/CTAN/

For completeness, I attach the logfile.

Can you please try the TLUtils.pm I sent? On windows the text was
returned *with* quotes and that doesn't work as mirror of course.

        Then, may I further ask how to ensure the inclusion of
	all font information in TEX-created PDF-files?

It depends on what you mean.

By default, all fonts are downloaded/embedded in PDF/PS output (as
opposed to merely referenced), as specified by the *DownloadBase options
in updmap.cfg. The embedded font is subsetted to only the used
characters (more or less).

If you mean avoid this subsetting (why?), there's no way to do that at
the TeX level, or via TL configuration. You'd have to edit pdftex.map
and other files to use "<<" instead of "<". See the pdftex
documentation. (I have not tried it myself.)

If you mean ensuring that fonts in included pdf graphics are copied into
the output pdf, set \pdfinclusioncopyfonts=1 with pdftex (different
methods in other engines, but I think/hope the functionality is
available in everything that generates pdf).

Hope this helps,
Karl

Hi Simon,

            May I ask whether there is a deeper reason why TEX-capacity can

Knuth's original archiTeXture has hardwired limits, yes. I tried to
document some of them in texmf.cnf (decades ago), although I admit the
comments may not be 100% correct any more.

Some of the values you wrote don't seem like the absolute maximums to
me.  You can check the sup_* values in the tex.ch source file, e.g.,
sup_pool_size is 40000000.  Some of those sup_ values are themselves not
maximized. If you don't have a source tree around, it's online at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/web2c/tex.ch?view=log&pathrev=55857

I seem to recall that luatex relaxes some of these limits. You might
want to try that. And/or program your fractal in Lua in the first place
and avoid all these crazy limits.

I'll reply to your font question separately. -k

This is correct.  I found out in the hard way that many knitr
tikzdevice plots can be compiled only in luatex.

Yes, that is what happens. After running install-tl-windows.bat it loads
a repo, and that is *not* mirror.ctan.org.

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to run a full install right now.
But will do ASAP. If someone else can do earlier than me, please go

Hello Akira,

thank you very much!. I have used luajithbtex from

 /pub/CTAN/systems/win32/w32tex/win64

which starts fine.

The next step is to debug why my lua scripts are not found... I hope
this place is the correct place to file another but report in case
this can't be fixed otherwise.

Thanks again
  Patrick

	(Is pdftex to be deprecated and replaced by luatex?

Thanks again and best regards,

It looks as if Lua files cannot be loaded with require('myfile') when
located in a directory with accents. Since I don't have a TeXLive
system installed, I cannot make a test file now. Once I can produce a
test file, I will report back.

To avoid misunderstanding: I doubt one can easily exceed pdftex limits
with *manually written* tikz code.  Tikzdevice is a package that
converts R plots into tikz - something useful if you want the textual
parts of the plot to match your body text.  Of course such tikz code
can contain thousands tikz commands for rendering lines and dots, so
pdftex can be stymied.

By the way, to set this in R, one can use the line

options(tikzDefaultEngine='luatex')

No, pdftex is not and will not be "deprecated". Both will continue to

There is no problem there.

For typesetting normal documents, i.e., almost everything, the

But TeX Live users are free to use whatever fonts they choose.  I, for example, routinely use proprietary fonts, and the current behaviour of sub-setting fonts when embedding is an important safeguard to ensure that users such as myself do not inadvertently violate embedding constraints.  Therefore the current behaviour is optimal in that respect, and although there is currently no suggestion that the default behaviour be changed, Dr Kramer's reminder of the "legal reasons for proper subsetting" offer a sensible note of caution.

Hello Phil,
the "current behaviour" originates from dvips, where sub-setting was
supported and enabled by default from the beginning.  TeX Live's
default setting will not be changed in the future, simply because a
change doesn't make sense.  You can rely on it.

As far as proprietary fonts are concerned, there is no need to warn
users on this mailing list.  Whenever you intend to buy a proprietary
font you have to examine its license *carefully* first, preferably
before buying it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: SVN: trunk kpse still in 2020
Message-ID: <20210513003315.0eb395f4@capsicvm>

Hi,

suppose I have the SVN trunk /somewhere and I have added
  PATH="/somewhere/trunk/Master/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"
to my ~/.bashrc . So I can access the current trunk state of TeXLive
without installing it.

I know that this is severe abuse of the SVN structure, and a slight
insult to the people who are putting a lot of hard work into getting
tlmgr work so pretty as it does (-:

Accordingly, during format creation, fmtutil rightfully crazes out and
reminds me that I'll have to use fmtutil-user instead of fmtutil-sys.
Blah blah, yes I know.


Now my question: I was wondering why TeXLive *2021* still stores its
formats, logs, etc. to ~/.texlive2020/ ? All the `kpsepath` entries
refer to 2020 (no TL2020 hysteresis possible, I noticed this on a
freshly installed machine).
TL2021, when regularly installed via tlmgr, refers to ~/.texlive2021/
as expected.

Nothing is broken, it's just that this lazy trick just worked on
the version bumps of the previous years (as if I had reinstalled TL
via tlmgr), but this year there was no version increase (yet?).


Best,
Johannes

Hi Johannes,

      PATH="/somewhere/trunk/Master/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"

Hey, me too :).

    I know that this is severe abuse of the SVN structure, 

Not abuse as far as I'm concerned.

    Accordingly, during format creation, fmtutil rightfully crazes out
    and reminds me that I'll have to use fmtutil-user instead of
    fmtutil-sys.

FWIW, personally I just let mktexfmt do the work
for this "run TeX out of svn" situation.

    Now my question: I was wondering why TeXLive *2021* still stores its
    formats, logs, etc. to ~/.texlive2020/ ? 

I don't know why it is happening for you. Maybe you have old
texmf.cnf values that are getting in the way? Or environment variables?
svn not updated?
kpsewhich -a texmf.cnf?
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR? 
etc.

    TL2021, when regularly installed via tlmgr, refers to ~/.texlive2021/
    as expected.

Indeed, the Master/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf that's in svn does have
.texlive2021. You can look in your svn checkout and see :).
Or: http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/web2c/

That was (or, rather, uncovered) the culprit. For some reason, about a
year ago, stupid me had copied Build/source/inst into a place where its
texmf.cnf had precedence over Master/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

Thanks!

 (required by kpsewhich)
Message-ID: <20210515080322.GA25937@hl.fritz.box>

Hi,

a german TeX user with Scientific Linux 6.10 got this error msg

  kpsewhich: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by kpsewhich)

after 3+ hours of downloads when trying to build format files etc.

I notice that Scientific Linux is "end of life":

      https://scientificlinux.org/downloads/sl-versions/sl6/
      As of November 2020 SL 6 is End Of Life, you should not perform new installations of this operating system.

and I already suggested to consider an update. 
but I have two questions:

- which linux system do you use to build TL 2021 binaries ?

- why does TL installation start and work up to format generation at all?
are all binaries needed for installation (perl, curl, ... ?) used from the distro ?

I've checked the TL binaries and notice that some (few) of them do not have GLIBC_2.14 requirements,
are those build on a different version, or is it just that they don't use any GLIBC calls which got changed in 2.14 ?

Debian Jessie (unless it changed, Norbert knowns more)

Yes, utilities from the distros are preferred.

You only get the GLIBC_2.14 error when you are trying to use a symbol
that has changed or was introduced in that version.

What you can try to do is compile a newer version of glibc manually, but
don't install it system-wide, as that will mess up everything. Instead
place it, e.g. in the TeX Live tree and use LD_PRELOAD or use the
patchelf utility to adjust the rpath of the binaries.

In the long run it's probably better to switch to a newer system.

Cheers, Henri

thanks to Moica & Henri for details!

in the mean time I got some more info: SL6 uses glibc 2.12
and was released march 2011 (RHEL6 is from november 2010).

and up to TL 2017 glibc 2.7 was required (in TL2017 only asy and dvisvgm binaries need glibc 2.14 -- interesting;)
and should work with SL6.  IMHO not bad fuer a 6+ years old linux distro...

I've given some hints/links how compiling glibc 2.14 might be done,
but getting red of SL6/RHEL6 might be the better way if possible
(yea, all that compatibility fuzz;)


thanks,

Harald

Yes, after that I had to switch to a newer Debian for building to get a
working gcc for the new C++ standard.

Subject: bug: xelatex: table would be rendered into second screen with beamer
Message-ID: <9ccd95d0-60ef-f258-65dc-712181842858@soulik.info>

Hello All

I try to place a table in beamer while I want to display my note in the 
screen screen, I tried the xelatex from texlive 2017 to 2020, all of 
them would only render the table in the page for the second screen 
leaving a blank page with only control bar in the main page. Neither the 
tabular nor tabularx would work.

The lualatex could work fine. And if I didn't place any frame before the 
frame contains that table, it seems work as well in xelatex.

\documentclass[aspectratio=169]{beamer}
\usepackage{pgfpages}

\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right}

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
foo & bar \\
\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\end{document}

Thanks in advance

Message-ID: <095b9b26-f0fd-0abf-a239-1484a39fdfb7@abgol.de>

Having updated to TL 2021 I noticed that the PDF files generated by TeX 
are not always in the A4 format even though `tlmgr paper' reports that 
A4 is set.

A minimal example is:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
Hello world!
\end{document}

The PDF viewer reports "US-Letter (216 ? 279 mm)" as paper size of the 
output (equally for pdflatex, xelatex, and lualatex). The log file for 
xelatex is attached.
However, if I uncomment the \usepackage command, I get A4 output.

That is not a change in texlive 2021, that has been the latex behaviour
since the start.
The default latex paper size is US letter, use the [a4paper]  documentclass
option to specify A4.

For various unfortunate historical reasons, latex can not specify the media
size to use until it
knows which backend is in use, which typically means loading graphicx, or
geometry or hyperref.
Without using a backend package the default page size and the a4paper
option affect the size
of the typeset block but not the size of the media.

Hi,

I noticed a bug in `texlive.tlpdb`, in the section of
`execute AddHyphen` in `hyphen-arabic` and `hyphen-farsi` package info.

	execute AddHyphen 	name=arabic 	lefthyphenmin= 	righthyphenmin= 
file=zerohyph.tex 	file_patterns=

where, the `lefthyphenmin` and `righthyphenmin` parameter in it 
shouldn't be empty. Instead, it should be 2 and 3. I found the values 
from the per-existed `language.lua.dat`.

Context: 
https://github.com/msys2/msys2-texlive/discussions/12#discussioncomment-753692

Also, is this the correct place to report them?

Thanks,
Naveen

It does look strange/wrong.

Well, 2 and 3 are the values for US English (and not much else).  It
makes no difference what the numbers are for zerohyph, since its whole
point is to eliminate hyphenation (empty \patterns).

    Also, is this the correct place to report them?

tex-hyphen at tug.org in this case, as those language tlpsrc files are
generated (https://github.com/hyphenation/tex-hyphen). I forwarded.

Hello,

I too have dealt with this oddity before. As already noted by Karl the
values for these particular languages are irrelevant because hyphenation
is suppressed anyways. But some values have to be set for
"language.lua.dat" where empty value is not an option.

I am not sure about how you encountered the problem in your
redistribution of TeX Live, but I seem to remember that you roll your
own scripts for some things. I am far from expert on TeX Live /
languages, but here is what I know:

 - TeX Live uses subroutine "parse_AddHyphen_line" (TLUtils.pm) to parse
   these lines. This is where the default values of "2" and "3" come
   from:

      my $default_lefthyphenmin = 2;
      my $default_righthyphenmin = 3;

 - The input lines ("execute AddHyphen") originally come from tex-hyphen
   project ( e.g.
   https://github.com/hyphenation/tex-hyphen/blob/master/TL/tlpkg/tlpsrc/hyphen-arabic.tlpsrc)
   and they rely on these default values.

 - Subroutines "language_dat_lines", "language_def_lines" and
   "language_lua_lines" called from "_parse_hyphen_execute" (all in
   TLPOBJ.pm) are used to generate the files "language.dat",
   "language.def" and "language.dat.lua" respectively. The handling of
   "synonyms" is probably the trickiest part and different in all three.

I have previously needed to parse these "execute AddHyphen" lines to
construct "language.dat.lua" and "language.def" myself (I didn't need
language.dat). I don't know if it helps your case at all, but here is
the script I used:

https://github.com/vlasakm/mmtex/blob/876fe6c7fd09a833399a31dbe9be06a9ba978a1b/mmtex/files/extract-language-data.awk

It was enough for my purposes (LuaTeX only), and may not be completely
compatible with the way TeX Live does this.


For general TeX Live / TeX hyphen discussion:

While at the topic. I seem to have noted in the previous version of the
script, that the handling of synonyms was weird at the very least (the
comment "synonyms in language.def ???" in TLPOBJ.pm seems to agree). As
far as I remember the current handling of synonyms in "language.def"
means, that for all eTeX engines (except LuaTeX) the same set of
hyphenation patterns is preloaded multiple times.

Another weird thing about synonyms is that while they are handled
correctly when coming from packages (generated by the mentioned
procedures), the US English synonyms (e.g. "american") are defined only
in "language.us.lua" and not in "language.us" nor "language.us.def".
This means that "\uselanguage{american}" can't currently work in pdfTeX
and XeTeX.

In LuaTeX, these US English synonyms also don't work. While
"luatex-hyphen.lua" (loaded by "etex.src") supports synonyms, it doesn't
even have the chance to do so, because "etex.src" (special LuaTeX
version) requires the synonym to be defined in "language.def".

The situation with "language.dat.lua" is also a bit weird --
"luatex-hyphen.lua" (from hyph-utf8) was designed to parse it, but IIRC
polyglossia parses it by itself, while babel and OpTeX don't use the
file at all. Even though the file and format is nice, it is still
sadly limited by the basic eTeX interface.

(Not that any of this really matters, because nobody seemed to have
noticed.)

Regard,
Michal Vlas?k

Yeah that true, https://github.com/msys2/msys2-texlive, mostly I created 
them with the help of Norbert.

Thanks. I think I can also, do so, to avoid error's.

The scripts I used for getting them is 
https://github.com/msys2/msys2-texlive/blob/main/texlive/file_creator.py 
and mostly it seems to work, only today I noticed this issue.

Thanks,

Yes, as far as I remember that is the only option possible to support
synonyms.

That sounds very much like an oversight from us, mostly due to the fact
that the US English language is treated differently (via the header).

I guess I have to take a look at all this again to fix it.

But still, thanks a lot for pointing it out!!

Hi List,

I have a somewhat obscure task I'd like the help of a programmer to
accomplish:

I have a TeX document in which each character has been converted to one of
52 two-digit numbers (so, 01 through 52). I have a corresponding keytext
document, also a TeX file, with 50,000 two-digit numbers in the same range
derived from a random source. This latter is my one-time pad.

I would like to run xor(mod 52) on the first document through the second,
to obtain a third document that is thus properly encrypted. However, since
these are TeX documents there are tags, markups, footnotes, citation links,
etc. still in the document.

So what I need is something like a python script that can go through a.tex,
perform an xor operation on each subsequent two-digit number in the file
through the number in the corresponding position in b.tex, to obtain c.tex
with all the TeX stuff still in its proper place. I would also want this
process to be reversible (ie, run xor(mod 52) on c.tex through b.tex to
obtain a file identical to a.tex).

I assume this requires some regex work, but writing a script like this is
entirely out of my competence.

Is there anybody on the list with some familiarity with this kind of
programming who'd be able to help me with this project?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Cheers,

A

When you say "each character", what exactly do you mean ?? I assume that 
"a" is a character, and "Z" is a character (whence the 52) but is "0" a 
character ?? Or "9" ?? Or any of "\", "{", "&", "}", etc. ?? And are the 
characters converted no matter whether or not they form part of a 
control sequence ?? More information needed, I feel.

Hi Philip,

I have already done the character-to-number conversion, so what exactly was
converted isn't a necessary part. The chain is something like this:

cleartext.tex ? [character-to-number conversion] ? ciphertext.tex ? [xor
through keytext.tex] ? codetext.tex

So, I have ciphertext.tex and keytext.tex, and want a script that can take
those two and produce codetext.tex (and then, if needed, take codetext.tex
and keytext.tex to produce a file identical to ciphertext.tex). For what
it's worth, the character-to-number conversion also converted numbers, some
punctuation, and certain TeX tags (like \textemdash gets its own number, as
do "startquote" and "endquote"). But \footnote is left in place, which
means they and other tags have to be ignored.

In short, the script should *only* operate on two-digit numbers in the file
sequentially, running an xor operation on each one in turn with the
two-digit number in the corresponding position in keytext.tex.

Does that help clarify what I'm trying to do?

Thanks for the help,

How could this be ?  You say "each character has been converted to one of 52 two-digit numbers (so, 01 through 52)" but [a-zA-Z] of itself will require 52 such numbers, so what numbers are assigned to [0-9 . , ; : ! ? \textemdash ...] ?

Well, for one, I'm ignoring capitalization. But again, that part of the
conversion has already been done, and requires no further work. All I need
is to convert the resulting two-digit numbers into *other* two-digit
numbers, using the keytext.

Cheers,

I think it would be better for you to take the question somewhere else,
perhaps a Python forum if Python is your preferred language. You might also
try Stack Overflow.

This is the tex-live list, whose topic is TeX Live development and testing.
There's advice on the TeX Live lists at http://tug.org/texlive/lists.html.

Finally, thank you for being a tex-live subscriber and good luck with
solving your problem.

I will try once more, Andrew, but to be honest I am rapidly losing 
interest, as trying to get /accurate /information from you regarding the 
earlier stages of your processing is proving extraordinarily difficult.

So let me ask one simple question ? if there were a processing engine E 
that took as input your ciphertext.tex and keytext.tex files and sought 
to produce your codetext.tex file, would that engine E need /any 
knowledge at all/ as to which fragments of ciphertext.tex represent 
TeX-specific constructs such as \footnote ?? If so, why ?? Why can it 
not operate on ciphertext.txt with no prior knowledge at all as to what 
its contents might represent ?

Hi Andrew,

if I understand your original mail, what you need is a slight
modification of Vernam cipher. Modules for Vernam cipher should be
available in many programming languages.

It led me to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Vernam, and how an
operator mistake allowed
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Lorenz_cipher.

So thank you not only for answering the original poster's question, but
also bringing this thread to a close (I hope) with an interesting piece of
information.

OK. As another interesting point, Vernam cipher is the only one which
was mathematically proved as unbreakable if the keytext is used only
once. During the cold war large puch tapes with random keytexts were
delivered as a diplomatic mail and the encoding/decoding machines
physically destroyed the bytes which were just used.

TeXLive and reproducibility of documents.

Hi

We're pleased to have Yihui Xie as our special guest at the TeX Hour
tomorrow (Thursday 20 May, 7:00 to 8:00pm). Yihui is a major contributor to
R Markdown and the associated TinyTeX.

R is a popular statistics and data analysis programming language. It uses R
Markdown as a single source for many outputs, from HTML and Beamer slides
through to interactive notebooks and LaTeX typeset mathematics. We can
learn a lot from R Markdown.

Note that we start at 7:00pm. The room will be open at 6:30pm as usual, but
Yihui won't be arriving until after 7:00pm. Arrive at 7:00 yourself if you
wish. The UK time now is https://time.is/UK.

The zoom details are:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396 Passcode: knuth

Interested? If you have time, you might like to look at:
Authoring Books with R Markdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/
TinyTeX - a 100MB subset of TeXLive: https://yihui.org/tinytex/
https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/

Advance notice: Next week we'll look at how git can help us improve CTAN,
TeXLive and reproducibility of documents.

Looking back, the video from last week (PreTeXt, LaTeX and Accessibility)
is available at:

Might just be the default settings for things like dvips or similar.

tlmgr does suppoer a paper option

paper
    paper [a4|letter]
    <[xdvi|pdftex|dvips|dvipdfmx|context|psutils] paper
    [papersize|--list]>
    paper --json

    With no arguments ("tlmgr paper"), shows the default paper size setting
    for all known programs.

    With one argument (e.g., "tlmgr paper a4"), sets the default for all known
    programs to that paper size.

    With a program given as the first argument and no paper size specified
    (e.g., "tlmgr dvips paper"), shows the default paper size for that
    program.

    With a program given as the first argument and a paper size as the last
    argument (e.g., "tlmgr dvips paper a4"), set the default for that program
    to that paper size.

    With a program given as the first argument and "--list" given as the last
    argument (e.g., "tlmgr dvips paper --list"), shows all valid paper sizes
    for that program. The first size shown is the default.

    If "--json" is specified without other options, the paper setup is dumped
    in JSON format. For the format of JSON output see
    "tlpkg/doc/JSON-formats.txt", format definition "TLPAPER".

    Incidentally, this syntax of having a specific program name before the
    "paper" keyword is unusual. It is inherited from the longstanding
    "texconfig" script, which supports other configuration settings for some
    programs, notably "dvips". "tlmgr" does not support those extra settings.

Thanks Lars. It seems "paper" isn't a tlmgr "option" but
rather a separate "action".  

tlmgr paper tells me that a config file for pdftex is
affected:

/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-config/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex

Would this include the etex format?

Actually the setting _does_ cause pdf(la)tex to make A4 PDF. as you can see
with pdfinfo for example:

Page size:      595.276 x 841.89 pts (A4)

However it does not affect latex macros  which still makes a typeset area
targeted for USLetter unless you add [a4paper]

Conversely if your site setting is for US Letter and you add [a4paper] as a
latex option latex formats the typeset area
targeted for A4 but does not actually change the media size unless a
backend package such as graphics, geometry or hyperref is loaded.

Current LaTeX releases have l3backend loaded so we may (finally) be able to
do something about this mis-match.

Hi all,

thanks David for the clarification.

Just to add to the excellent explanation of David:

tlmgr paper tries to set the *physical* paper size for a variety of
programs, as you can see with

$ tlmgr paper
Current context paper size (from /home/norbert/tl/2021/texmf-dist/tex/context/user/mkii/cont-sys.rme): a4
Current dvipdfmx paper size (from /home/norbert/tl/2021/texmf-config/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg): a4
Current dvips paper size (from /home/norbert/tl/2021/texmf-dist/dvips/config/config.ps): a4
Current pdftex paper size (from /home/norbert/tl/2021/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex-ini-files/pdftexconfig.tex): a4
Current psutils paper size (from /home/norbert/tl/2021/texmf-dist/psutils/paper.cfg): a4
Current xdvi paper size (from /home/norbert/tl/2021/texmf-dist/xdvi/XDvi): a4

That means, if you create a ps or pdf file using one of the programs and
do not specify anything else, the set paper size will be used.

For latex that means if you don't specify anything, you will get (as
David explained) a letter sized page layed out by latex, printed onto
physical a4 paper.

Usage of packages that detect the backend and set physical page size
from the specified latex page size are recommended.

Best

Norbert

Thank you David but my question is whether *etex* (which
is a pdftex format) is also affected by paper settings and
whrther this may have changed recently. A musixtex user on
tex-music at tug.org is complaining that his scores which used
to be centered on letter paper are now being output with A4
offsets.

etex itself can't specify the media size, but  if you process the dvi with
dvips or dvipdfm etc then that is
affected by the default page size configuration for those drivers.

I wish there was a simple yes/no answer in this thread but there is a lot
of history here unfortunately.
That said I don't think any of this has changed recently.

David Carlisle responded to questions about paper size options in TeX,
and noted that there is no simple answer.  I concur, and wrote about
the problem here:

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/doc/latex-overview/index.html#Page%20layout%20and%20document%20printing

With TeX Live, and some Debian-family distributions, changing default
paper types is easy, and described in that document section.

With most other TeXware distributions, there is, frankly, a hideous
mess, with several files that need manual patching, and such changes
might be lost on the next system update.

If you have to make such changes on your system by manual patches, you
also have to regenerate the affected *.fmt files.  Unfortunately, many
O/S distributions have commented out configuration file lines that
would normally cuases particular format files to be remade.  You then
have to find those configuration files and their hidden lines,
uncomment them, and rerun the format-file regeneration.

At my site, all TeX engine formats are enabled, and there are more
than 50 of them in our 2019, 2020, and 2021 TeX Live trees.  However,
a single user on a personal machine might need fewer than half dozen
*.fmt files.

Hi,

as David wrote, many packages set the paper size and do not read the
default settings. Some of them have good reason for doing that. Not
all packages send the settings from the macros to the output driver.
This means that you should never rely on the default settings,
anything can happen. If you do not take care yourself, believe to the
default and send the output to a phototypesetter, it can cost you a
lot of money. It happened to me but they warned me that the settings
is incorrect and asked me to fix it. Thus I lost some time, not money.

    This also happens with a standard installation of Fedora 34.

It seems strange that they go to the trouble of explicitly removing a
module from the default installation that (afaik) has been standard for
many years. Maybe report it to Fedora as a bug? Though they must have
their reasons and aren't likely to change their decision.

Anyway, I imagine we can work around it in fmtutil.pl, in time.
Thanks for the report). --karl

Hello,

With lualatex (or xelatex), I can't compile this file anymore:

However, luaotfload-tool --find "NewComputerModern" returns:

Does anybody have an idea on what is going on?

 From my point of view the font has not the internal correct names:

Thank you, agreed.  This makes automatic selection of font shapes
unavailable.  Besides, despite of:

Unique ID:           1.003;NewComputerModernSans10-Book

\setsansfont{NewComputerModernSanss10-Book}

does not work.

This time from the PostScript name!  Nevertheless, with:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{NewComputerModern10-Regular}
\setsansfont{NewCMSans10-Book}
\begin{document}
Hello. \textsf{Hello, \emph{hello}.}
\end{document}

One gets no italic or oblique sans serif.  The only way is to specify
everything as in fspdefault.sty...

use the file names:

\setmainfont{NewCM10}[

Not to mention that

\babelfont{sf}[
  Extension      = .otf,
  UprightFont    = *-Regular,
  BoldFont       = *-Bold,
  ItalicFont     = *-Italic,
  BoldItalicFont = *-BoldItalic ]{NewCM10}
\babelfont{tt}[
  Extension      = .otf,
  UprightFont    = *-Regular,
  BoldFont       = *-Bold,
  ItalicFont     = *-Oblique,
  BoldItalicFont = *-BoldOblique ]{NewCMSans10}

works too, which I did not know.

Thanks again,

Right, and so will I.  However, before the latest release of NewCM, I
used to load the sans and mono shapes only like so:

\setsansfont{NewComputerModern Sans}
\setmonofont{NewComputerModern Mono}

which worked.  I wonder if there is not something amiss in the naming
scheme of the latest version.

Message-ID: <MN2PR02MB6749CAD47EB34ACF9EE9B044AE289@MN2PR02MB6749.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

I am getting an error from makeinfo and would be very grateful for any suggestions on how to make it go away.

$ makeinfo
MiscXS.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched (got handshake key 0xdb00080, needed 0xde00080)

My setup is that I'm running Ubuntu 18 and have the TeX Live Debian packages.  I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask; I've used makeinfo in the past on this machine and so I don't think it is a packaging error or a configuration error.  Instead it seems to me to be some kind of perl-got-updated error (I haven't used the `makeinfo' command for a year or more, so the update could have been some time ago).  

I tried recompiling texi2html from source but there was no change in the error.   Online forums suggested deleting various subdirectories that I don't have, and changing environment variables that I don't have set.  Any ideas would be most welcome.

Thanks,
Jim

How about using
    $ strace makeinfo 2> makeinfo.log
to identify the mismatched binaries.

Also, how about providing links to the online forum pages already consulted.

Hi Jim,

    $ makeinfo MiscXS.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched
    (got handshake key 0xdb00080, needed 0xde00080)

Indeed, when Perl gets updated (at least in a big enough way), Texinfo
also has to be updated. This is a consequence of Gavin using compiled C
code to make makeinfo faster. It's a hassle. I don't know why it does
not happen for other Perl packages that use compiled code (there are
many, after all, while makeinfo is the only one I ever have this problem
with).  Could be worth a report to bug-texinfo.

In any case, assuming you are using programs from distro packaging, this
seems like something that needs to be reported to Ubuntu.

Meanwhile, given the updated Perl, I think the "simplest" way forward
for now would be to download the original Texinfo distribution from
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-6.7.tar.xz 
and run configure --prefix=/your/preferred/location && make && make install
That should pick up your new version of system Perl and be functional.
(At least, rebuilding Texinfo is all I do when I put in a new Perl.)

I don't think anything about your TeX Live installation matters here,
because we don't distribute either makeinfo or (apart from Windows) perl.
Let me know (off-list :) if problems persist. --best, karl.

Thank you, Karl.  It simply didn't occur to me that it isn't from the TL distro.  No one on this list will be astonished to hear that I get dumber each year.  In any event, I got it to go, thanks.

(For any random googler who finds this message, FWIW I had to run
  configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make
  make install
as three separate commands on my Ubuntu 18 install.)

Thank you again,
Jim

Hi Jim,
the argument --prefix=/usr/local is usually not necessary because it's
almost? always set by default.

But I strongly recommend to run

  ./configure --help

in advance.

  Reinhard

Hi, I have a question about the location of the `ltximg` script man
pages, they are currently located at:

/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/support/ltximg/

but I think they are better placed in:

Am I right?

Subject: Rewrite from the ground up of the Ghostscript PDF interpreter
Message-ID: <A7C22774-B569-46EF-900B-A6B801C7BB43@icloud.com>

For the TeX developers here who interact with PS, PDF and Ghostscript: a couple of weeks ago the Ghostscript developers have announced they are rewriting Ghostscript's PDF interpreter, written mostly in PostScript, entirely in C. The transition will occur over several releases and years, and is discussed in detail in an entry of the new Ghostscript blog at

https://ghostscript.com/pdfi.html

One consequence seems to be the addition, inside the GhostPDL suite, alongside gs, gpcl6 and gxps, of a new gpdf tool.

My impression is that TeX won't be affected, as TeX and friends produce PDF as output but don't use it as input. But I'm not a specialist, so I may very well be wrong. 

So if you think this is relevant and want to experiment with the future release of Ghostscript, make sure the rewrite has no side effects for TeX, an alpha gs 9.55 release is available from

https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/tag/gpdf_alpha1

Artifex already distribute mupdf, a very fast PDF viewer
written in C. How will this be different?

I can't really say.

My impression was that MuPDF was more aimed at mobile devices (phones and tablets) and at viewing not manipulating the PDF files, but last I used it was several years ago so I'm not sure.

Also, last I tried to compile it, muPDF had several dependencies while Ghostscript has practically none: for MacTeX we basically compile Ghostscript with just ./configure --disable-compile-inits && make on a Mac with only macOS, XQuartz and nothing else, and that's it.

For muPDF, <https://mupdf.com/docs/building.html> seems to say there are more dependencies for the X11 and OpenGL viewers. But again, it's been a very long time since I last tried compilation, so things may have changed.

I don't know whether the folks at Artifex have some convergence in mind, like replacing the PDF interpreter in Ghostscript by one based on the PDF interpreter from MuPDF. The page <https://ghostscript.com/pdfi.html> says nothing on the matter, it rather insist (see the "What's New?" section) that the new C-based interpreter will maintain compatibility with the existing PostScript-based interpreter.

Also, the aim may be to have a family of stand-alone interpreters Ghostscript, GhostPCL, GhostXPS and GhostPDF, all based on the same underlying library within GhostPDL. I occasionally use GhostXPS myself when receiving (very rarely) the odd XPS file.

Not just a random googler, but a very lucky one. According to google, so
far in 2021 only 4 messages have been posted to the tex-live list. Surely
that's not true.

Hi!

I am Zhihao Ma, a user of Texlive/Mactex from China and have updated my TexLive/Mactex to 2021 version.

I found there are two files in the /usr/local/texlive, named "2020" and "2021" respectively. I'm?wondering whether I could delete the "2020" file.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best wishes,

If you have the space, it is often better to keep it. Then if, for some reason there is a document that just does not work with TeXLive 2021 (MacTeX is TeXLive with a wrapper), then you always have the option to compile it with the 2020 version.

Otherwise, if your 2021 version works as it should you can remove the 2020 version. The 2021 version should not be depending on anything from the 2020 version.

Zhihao Ma asks about deleting the 2020 directory after installing TeX
Live 2021.

Yes, you can certainly do that if disk space is tight; the trees for
annual releases are completely independent.

I keep them online here on our systems for every year back to 2003,
because we sometimes have documents that rely on particular package
features for a certain year that were changed in later years.

Most single users with personal computers are unlikely to have
documents with such dependencies.

I you have enough disk space, I would, however, suggest that you keep
the old version around for a few weeks or months, until you are
confident that your own documents typeset as expected with the new
version.

If your filesystem supports compression (Windows 10 does), then you
can turn on that feature: it typically reduces disk space by a factor
of at least two to three for text files, and sometimes much more.
Binary files, like the executables in the bin/* directories, likely
won't compress as much.

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is about understanding and refactoring TeX Live to make
it more flexible and agile.  The TeX Hour is Thursday 27 May, 6:30 to
7:30pm UK time.

The UK time now is at https://time.is/UK. The zoom details are
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

Last week Yihui Xie explained why and how he developed TinyTeX to support
users of R-Markdown. This greatly reduces the barrier to entry to using
TeX. TinyTeX is a 100MB subset of TeXLive. My first PC, bought in 1989 to
run TeX, had a 40MB hard disk (and 2MB of memory and a 10Mhz CPU).

Don Knuth wrote TeX to be archival. To give identical results from
identical inputs. My TeX source file is just one of many inputs. Recording
and exactly reproducing the other inputs is vital, to fully benefit from
the hard work of Don Knuth that made TeX archival.

One goal is to make it much easier to archive all the resources used when a
document is typeset. And at a different time and place, and on a different
machine, gather those resources to typeset the document again. Maybe via
GitHub actions, as part of Continuous Integration.

Another goal is to make it much easier to package a subset of TeX just for
a special purpose. Beginner? You want to make a math presentation? Download
and install a Beamer app. A few minutes later, you're ready to start
authoring.

Interested? Please email me, or come along to the TeX Hour. I welcome your
experience and ideas. My starting point will be statistics from the last
ten years of the TeX Live DVDs.

The video from last week (R Markdown + Tiny TeX: with Yihui Xie) is at:

Here's some stats on disk usage on the TeX Collection DVD, from 2010 to
2020. But first some observations. I'll be digging deeper into this in the
TeX Hour tonight (6:30 to 7:30 UK time).

Change in space used over the period 2010 to 2020.
1. CTAN decreased by 53%.
2. TEXLIVE increased by 95%.
3. PROTEXT increased by 6%.
5. MACTEX decreased by 30%.
6. The TEXCOL was 7.8 to 8.0GB, except in 2014, 2015 and 2020.

Between 2019 and 2020
1. CTAN increased from 90 to 212 (unit is 10,000 blocks).
2. TEXLIVE increased from 347 to 390.
3. PROTEXT decreased from 348 to 105.
4. MACTEX was stable at 45 to 45.
5. The size of TEXCOL decreased from 8.0 to 7.3GB.

Dear Jonathan,

thank you for the interesting stats. Let's see, what 2021 brings. I got 
my DVD just yesterday.

When comparing the data please keep in mind, that the space limits of a 
double layer DVD always had an impact on the TeX Collection. Some years 
ago Karl Berry and Manfred Lotz started to "optimize" the collection by 
getting rid of redundant stuff, not so prominent TeX engines etc. 
Starting with TeX Collection 2020 Klaus H?ppner built a special 
(smaller) MiKTeX tree which is used for ProTeXt instead of the full 
installation. That brought quite a bit of extra space, which is 
necessary to cover the increasing CTAN/TEX Live part for some more years.

Best regards,
Martin

Jonathan,

For many years the full MacTeX install package was on the DVD. This package contained its own version of the full TeX Live.  A few years ago we switched to using the Unix install script to install the TeX Live piece, so the install package only installs four GUI apps and Ghostscript.

The internet version of MacTeX installs everything and is MUCH larger than the material on the DVD.

Unfortunately that is getting rather difficult wrt to latex or xetex etc
- sty files can easily be found by using -recorder and copy all recorded
  files to the cwd
- fonts are much more tricky, as one needs to archive all the metafont
  sources at that time, or the ttf/otf fonts used in case of xetex.
  Which, when used with lookup by filename versus lookup by font name
  can be tricky.
- engines: some engines undergo changes that also might have an effect on
  the layout, so you need to archive also the engines' source code
  and be able to rebuild the sources

All in all, a goal that is hard to achieve completely. But with archival
of the runtime files (sty, tex, ...) one goes already a long way, and it
is rather trivial thanks to -recorder.

Fonts archiving gives you a little plus-alpha, but it is already a bit
more involved.

Engines archiving is only for the freaks.

Hope that helps you provide a **great** tool based on these suggestions.

Best

Norbert

Or type1 fonts.   Some documents used commercial system or printer fonts
that aren't freely available.

My experience has been that many active TeX users spend their careers
using a small number of templates acquired in grad school or from
publishers and then expanded with a non-decreasing list of \includepackage
statements.  This works because they can just install TeX Live to get
all those packages along with a few they have been copying from old
system to new system.

Archiving is more likely to be useful if care is taken to choose stable
and well supported runtime files and fonts.  It would help to have
curated collections chosen to meet the needs of major publishers,
documentation systems like Rd, etc.  The collections should provide
"core" document classes to cover a majority of use cases.

There are some well-supported high quality free font collections that
mostly stay backwards compatible, but few users are in a position to
evaluate font quality.

I think considerable effort goes into avoiding breaking old documents
with new engine versions.   Building old engines on current toolchains
may be more difficult than updating old documents to work with current
toolchains.

It would be useful to have a few collections of old documents for
systematic testing.

Hello Jonathan,
thanks for the survey.

As you can see, MacTeX is significantly smaller than TeX Live.  The
reason is that MacTeX actually installs TeX Live and adds additional
programs which are usably not present on a Mac.

ProTeXt is a wrapper to MiKTeX supposed to make installation easier.

I don't know why the sizes of MiKTeX and TeX Live are so different.
They [almost] provide the same things.

But what I absolutely don't understand is why Christian Schenk, the
author of MiKTeX, doesn't simply "steal" platform independent packages
from TeX Live.  That would save space on the DVD.  But most important,
it would save *him* a lot of time.

Regards,
  Reinhard

For the record, all that is removed from TL for the DVD are binaries for

Yes, that's what I meant. Thanks for the clarification.

I'm not sure what the actual goal is here, but these two commands
show the total doc size in megabytes, namely 763.215:
  sed -n 's/^docfiles size=//p' texlive.tlpdb |
  awk '{sum += $1} END{print sum/1024}'

Replacing "doc" with ".*" shows the total size of all, namely 1769.29:
  sed -n 's/^.*files size=//p' texlive.tlpdb |
  awk '{sum += $1} END{print sum/1024}'

763.215 / 1769.29 = 43%

Let me also mentioned the tlpkg/bin/tlpsizes script I wrote long ago to
compute the sizes per-collection, or per-scheme, or for given packages,
showing the largest packages in the given collection/scheme.
The output starts like this:

$ tlpsizes
2008 collection-fontsextra        330 202736/noto 133208/newcomputermodern ...
 982 collection-latexextra       1413 45208/lm 40576/latex-base-dev ...

Apologies. I meant to say

Well, some good news. The URL below now gives 10 results (it used to be
only 4 results). Has anything changed on the TUG website to bring this
about?

https://www.google.com/search?q=site:https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:2021

But we're a long way from having full coverage. And the random
google looking for Jim's message will still be disappointed.

Well, I am puzzled. Are you sure? My URL is
https://www.google.com/search?q=site:https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:2021

For me today it gives 9 results (perhaps I miscounted yesterday to get 10).
Note that my search results page says "1 Jan 2021 - Today" just before the
first result. And no sign of further pages in the footer.

If I modify the search to remove that, but keep the same site restriction,
I get "Page 22 of about 6,810 results (0.46 seconds)".

Please Philip, would you check (1) that you're using the same URL, and (2)
that the results page says "1 Jan 2021 - Today", and (3) all the results
are from this year (as mentioned in the subject line).

Hi Philip

What you've told me is consistent with my statement, that according to
Google search only 4 (now 9 or 10) have been posted to this list so far.
(Your results page has no 2021 posts to this list. It would have helped me,
if you yourself had noticed that.)

Rather than track down what led you to your page, I'd like to tell you how
to get my page.

1. In Google search for site:https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live
2. Click on Tools the results page header.
3. Click on the Any Time that now appears in the header.
4. Select Custom Range.
5. In From type 2021 and press Go.

By the way, what browser are you using? I've tried my URL with both Chrome
and Firefox.

Mine is rather more complex, and would probably benefit from URL-decoding :

Decoding by Meyerweb yields :

I would suggest that the key difference lies in this part : 
"cd_min:01-Jan-2021,cd_max:31-May-2021" (v. "cd_min:2021").

I have claimed that Google search says only 4 (now 9 or 10) messages have
been posted to this list so far in 2021. That is the main point of this
thread. You've not provided any evidence that contradicts that statement.

Although off-topic, I made an effort to allow you to reproduce my
investigation. Thank you for your apology, for not following my
instructions. You are still not following my instructions. You've not put
the 'site:' prefix in the URL.

You use seamonkey. It's not a browser I use, and I don't provide technical
support for it. This thread is about whether Google has adequately indexed
the messages on this list.

Until you are able to do a google search for a specific site and specific
time range, you will find it hard or impossible to reproduce my search. I
suspect you have a problem due to a combination of using seamonkey and URL
scrambling in your mail system.

I'm not responsible for supporting you to fix those problems. If you or
anyone else has evidence that Google search knows about more than 10
messages posted to this list so far in 2021, I'd like to see it.

Ah, so where you wrote ? 1. In Google search 
for?site:https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live ? , you meant ? 1. In Google 
search for "site:https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live" 
<https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live> ?.? As I am not a mind-reader, I 
failed to understand your instructions.

Jonathan, let me be blunt.? If I were seeking support, for Seamonkey or 
for anything else, you are the very /last/ person to whom I would turn.

See above.

Any possible interest that I once had in helping you in this task has 
long since vanished.? Goodbye, hopefully for ever.
