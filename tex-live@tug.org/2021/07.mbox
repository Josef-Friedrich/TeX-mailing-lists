Watched it. A few comments:
- first of all, move your meetings to reasonable time for me and I will
  participate - but don't complain that TeX Live people are not
  interested. I told you this already a few times.

- Having only the tex macros gives you say 90%, but of what one normally
  needs, but if you want actual reproducability you need to have the
  fonts **and** the binaries also available from older versions,
  otherwise there is no guarantee that the outputs are the same.
  That defeats all the experiments how small it is for only tex files,
  yes, they are not big, that we know.

- As Nelson said, just hacking kpse to return a handle to a file from a
  pack is not enough, because there are hundreds of other programs in a
  variety of languages that do NOT use kpse and still open these files.
  So one needs to - as Nelson said - rewrite the complete IO layer of
  the OS running, **and** in addition doing that for all platforms we
  support .... good luck.

Enjoy your experiments.

Norbert

Hi Martin,

today's update should have brought in all the necessary binaries, and in
my tests format were usable across archs.

Could you please retry your tests and let us know the outcome.

Thanks

Hi Norbert,
I've just finished the updates and tests and everything worked fine.
No errors on my platforms.

Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <c8286f9a-8d17-4554-aab2-d1d2f025c381@www.fastmail.com>

Hello to everyone,

Ulrike Fischer recommended I write an email to the TeXLive group rather than posting my problem on the TeX stackexchange. In essence, this is my question found at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/602194/installing-texlive-2021-i-cant-find-file-dehypht-x-2021-02-26-tex but with a few minor updates.

So, I'm trying to build various Docker images for the different TeXLive schemes `infraonly`, `minimal`, `basic`, `small`, `medium`, and `full`. But, as of recently, I cannot build docker images for some TeXLive schema (as of this writing it fails for tl-20210701, but also didn't work with tl-20210622); my weekly builds fail already at installing the minimal scheme. The important section of the log reads:

> `Skipping module "grouptypes"; Loading module "interactionmodes";
> Skipping module "nodetypes"; Skipping module "iftypes";)
> (/usr/local/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/config/language.def

The lengthy console log, including all the commands I entered after starting the docker image and all the console output I received, are attached in E3s4QAXh.log

My steps to reproduce:
 1. docker run -it ubuntu:focal /bin/bash
 2. apt update && apt install packages like curl, wget, etc.
 3. mkdir /tmp/texlive && cd /tmp/texlive
 4. wget --user=anonymous --password=ftp --no-parent --no-verbose --recursive --no-directories http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
 5. ./install-tl -profile=/tmp/texlive/texlive.profile -repository=http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/
 6. export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/bin/x86_64-linux/:$PATH" and hash -r
 7. tlmgr install scheme-minimal
The last step is where it fails. It also fails if I want to `tlmgr install scheme-basic` or `tlmgr install scheme-small`, only works when I `tlmgr install scheme-medium`.

This leads me to believe that there is something wrong in how the schemes are set up i.e., some file is missing in scheme-basic that is only available when installing scheme-medium. Surprisingly though, I installed scheme-infraonly locally on my Ubuntu 20.04 a few weeks ago and that worked like it should, though on my build machine, it didn't work at that time either. I did install the different schemes sequentially from `scheme-infraonly` to `scheme-full`

The texlive.profile I use for installing texlive (see step 5. in above list) is attached.

What am I missing here? I first thought I might have a gotten a bad mirror, but tried it on several days, at different hours of the day, and from different machines. Even tried it again (in docker, and a VM Ubuntu 20.04 guest on a Ubuntu 20.04 host, mirror/repository were https://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet and https://ctan.crest.fr/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet) just before sending this email. No difference, still fails at installing `scheme-minimal` with the same message of "I can't find file `dehypht-x-2021-02-26.tex'."

The dockerfiles I use are hosted at https://gitlab.com/philipptempel/docker-ubuntu-tug-texlive/-/tree/latest and you are more than invited to clone, fork, try, etc.

Thanks in advance and have a lovely day, everyone.

Philipp Tempel

Hi,

the situation is even more complex, you even must have the same OS.
Many years ago happened to us, when I was asked to develop a macro
package for a journal and we had the same version of TeX Live, the
same version of DejaVu fonts, yet the article compiled from the same
sources by XeLaTeX in Linux was one page shorter than the same done on
Mac. For some reason font handling was different. Versioning of DejaVu
fonts is important and downgrading DejaVu might require downgrade of
fontspec whcih may lead to domino effect requiring downgrade of
everything.

I wonder why seminar.bg3 is below texmf-dist/doc/latex/seminar/seminar.bg3
in TL 2021 ... it looks like it belongs to the same location as seminar.bg2
as texmf-dist/tex/latex/seminar/seminar.bg2.  Simply to be able to include
them like seminar.bug as well.

Beside this texmf-dist/doc/latex/seminar/semsamp3.tex is missing exaseminar.cls

thanks for the report. That is the wrong directory for seminar.bg3, it 
should be
the same as for *.bg2

But, as of recently, I cannot build docker images for some TeXLive schema (as of this writing it fails for tl-20210701, but also didn't work with tl-20210622); my weekly builds fail already at installing the minimal scheme.

Can you please try again tomorrow and report back?

Here's my attempt to fix the problem:
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=59788

The problem is that German patterns for luatex and xetex also require
patterns from the dehyph-exptl package, and that dependency was
missing.
This change will make the minimal scheme somewhat less minimal, but at
least hopefully working.

Docker seems to be a way to solve this problem.  A Docker image is a
complete archival copy of the state of your system.

Of course there is no guarantee Docker images created today are going
to be executable on the machines 150 years from now - even if we do
not ruin the civilization before this.

Hi Norbert

Thank you for watching last week's TeX Hour video. Here's a couple of
videos, just now uploaded, that specifically deal with can TeX Live rely on
git, and what the next steps are.

24 June 2021: Q: Can we rely on git? A: Yes, Linux does it the best there
is!

24 June 2021: Q: Where are we? A: There's a plausible case, worth trying it
out.

Hi,

I'm actually no longer sure that the patch was correct. Something else
must have gone wrong, I'll probably need a bit more testing.

This Lua file should be located in the tex/ tree rather than the doc/ tree.
The situation is similar to the babel-french package containing a

Thanks, but I am not interested in teaching via youtube. If you want to
express an opinion and further your case, please write here what you
think, otherwise there will be not fruitful discussion.

Does not work von /win32 created on the linux-system with the new 
delivered pdftex.x86_64-linux (58535 -> 59775):

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2021/W32TeX) 
(preloaded format=pdflatex)
  restricted \write18 enabled.
---! u:/texlive/texmf-var/web2c/pdftex/pdflatex.fmt made by different 
executable version
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

Creating new user-fmt with win32 'solves' the problem

Running pdflatex file.tex on linux is untouched (works as usual)

I slightly modified your texlive.profile (in order to change the
directories as I wanted to install the files elsewhere, not under
/usr/local/texlive, and I didn't use Docker, I just installed directly
to an existing linux distro) and I wasn't able to reproduce the
problem.

It seems that in your case tlmgr finds
    /usr/local/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/config/language.def
instead of either of those two:
    /usr/local/texlive/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def
    ~/.texlive/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def

The file
    /usr/local/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/config/language.def
contains a pre-generated list with all hyphenation patterns, while
tlmgr is supposed to use a list that's generated on the fly based on
what packages you have installed.

As to why this happens ... I leave that question to the others.
(I'll revert my change from yesterday, it was wrong.)

Btw, why is the following path using a double slash?

I think not. What I need is not a historical image of my system but a
current version of someone else's system and I am afraid that other
users are not allowed to send me a Docker image of MacOSX or Windows
for legal reasons.

Subject: tex in interactive mode gets seemingly frozen when input exceeds 1024
 characters as the terminal warning is issued one character too late
Message-ID: <CBE23D24-6562-44E3-9D48-AB19CEA53DE9@free.fr>

Hi,

I encountered what I feel is a bug in the tex interactive interface. Same in etex.

Context: input can not exceed 1024 characters.

If one tries to go beyond the terminal ? beeps ? (at my locale it is a kind of blinking). But one must understand that to escape one **must** delete and enter <return> itself as the 1024th character, not the 1025th one.

I suggest the ? beep ? should happen not at the 1025th character but at the 1024th which should be ignored and not echoed (as anyhow there is no way to get it through) except if it is the EOL character, i.e. <return> normally.

It took me a while to understand.

Also my panicked CTRL-C seemed without effect but it had to be CTRL-C <return>

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

The ^C^C^C^C near the end were my attempt to kill the job.

As explained above I should have simply hit the ? delete ? key to reduce to 1023 characters, then hit <return>.

Or CTRL-C <return>

Hi Jean-Fran?ois,

I am not sure, but I believe the input length is capped by the tty 
internal size limit, not exactly by tex in particular. IIRC 1024 is max 
in OSX, and perhaps (1024 x 4) in Unix. Just my 2 cents. :)

Cheerio,

Paulo

Hi Philipp, hi Mojca,

thanks Mojca for the testing, much appreciated, and you found the
critical point:

> > (/usr/local/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/config/language.def

That should *NOT* be used and in a correct installation of TeX Live it
should not happen.

Philipp, I followed your installation routine (without the docker) and
installed in my system into ~/tltest/2021 and after that I checked that
there is TEXMFSYSVAR/tex/generic/config/language.def:

$ kpsewhich -all language.def
/home/norbert/tltest/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def
/home/norbert/tltest/2021/texmf-dist/tex/generic/config/language.def
$

And the first one contained only references to USenglish.

So something is fishy on your side, and the descriptions hopefully help
you.

All the best

Norbert

I see... indeed that looks quite possible. I could not find in osx Terminal app some preference but it makes sense if it is a hard-coded feature.

This seems indeed to confirm Paulo?s comment.

I am using the mac osx Terminal app from high sierra (yes I upgraded finally to the flat smartphone interface and invading SIRI, took me hours to try to silence it).

Thanks both, I feel you found the actual cause of this,

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Hi Norbert, hi Mojca,

Thank you for your help and investigation. I believe my problem is solved now.

Indeed, my side was a little fishy and it seems to have been the double slashes in my texlive.profile (for config `TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR) `that caused the error. After replacing them with a single slash, it works on Docker and in a Ubuntu VM (though I did get some checksum errors from several mirrors; after finding a good one, everything worked as it should).

Thank you @Mojca for pointing out the double slashes. I noticed them while reviewing my code before approaching you with the error. Didn't fix it because I didn't believe it to be an error or cause such problems.

On that note though, what now really confuses me: how can a double slash in `TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR cause this behavior? Particularly cause an error that emerges only when installing the three smallest schemes (infraonly, minimal, basic) but with scheme-small and higher there is no more issues?`

`Cheers,`

Philipp

I tend to believe that double slashes have some special meaning to
kpathsea, but I don't know (and didn't bother investigating) the
details.

> Particularly cause an error that emerges only when installing the three smallest schemes (infraonly, minimal, basic) but with scheme-small and higher there is no more issues?

The issue is present in all cases, it's just that you don't notice it
when you install a scheme that's big enough to contain the
"problematic package".
The file that shouldn't be found by kpathsea contains references to a
package that's apparently only installed with the bigger schemes, so
you don't notice anything weird there, but it breaks when the
referenced files are missing (which happens in the smaller schemes).

Hi Philipp,

> On that note though, what now really confuses me: how can a double slash in `TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR cause this behavior? Particularly cause an error that emerges only when installing the three smallest schemes (infraonly, minimal, basic) but with scheme-small and higher there is no more issues?`

double slashes have a special meaning in kpse, that they search
recursively all directories below the given one.

That has been like this since the dawn of humans ;-)

Still, there are a few things I am contemplating:
- first I need to check why the double slash disturbed the whole system
- second, I think it would be nice if we automatically clean input
  like this and remove double slashes, nobody in their right mind will
  want that, and if, they should fix it afterwards.

@Karl, what do you think?

Hi,

I didn't know kpse treats double slashes differently than unix shells do. iirc, unix shells don't care if there is more than one consecutive slash, they are disregarded.

Read a bit about kpathsea, never needed it before, and found out that indeed "two or more consecutive slashes in a path element following a directory d [are] replaced by all subdirectories of d".
Good to know.

But confusing nonetheless, as I didn't know about this "feature" ;) of kpathsea and so it startled me.

Maybe your suggestion of sanitizing the input beforehand is a good choice--assuming that the double slashes actually the root cause of my problem.

Have a nice weekend,

Philipp

    @Karl, what do you think?

Remove double slashes from anywhere but the very end of the path?
Strikes me as an awfully invasive change to be making after 30 years,
although I guess in practice that is all we have ever used.  At least
that's all I see in texmf.cnf.

I guess I could somewhat imagine install-tl warning about this when seen
(either from profile or interactively). Not so much tlmgr. I don't think
double slashes should simply be silently removed, in any case.

And/or, tlmgr check texmfdbs could look for this and warn. Admittedly
few people know about that, but at least it could be something to point
to in response to queries. --best, karl.

To add a bit of information to the thread and the essentially correct responses, you can check out the manual pages for ?stty? and ?sysctl? (with the ?man? command, as in ?man stty?).  See the blurbs under ?stty -imaxbel? and ?man sysctl user.max_line?.

Keep in mind that the man pages in unix/linux systems are not always completely accurate, but they will give you an idea of what is/should be happening behind the curtains.

In short, the issue is a system one, dictated by how it handles buffers and buffering in the kernel.

I find it hard to believe that multiple slashes in a pathname cause a problem.  The Unix and Unix-derived systems I know of silently ignore them (as part of kernel processing, if nowhere else).

It is possible that individual programs would derive some secret direction from their appearance, but that seems like a big no-no.  It?s been part of Unix folklore since the ?70?s :-}

Cheers,

Justin

Ewww!

I stand (or, in this case, sit) corrected.

Subject: LuaMetaTeX
Message-ID: <B404FEF2-35F2-43E8-A48E-5D4A7A7F7070@icloud.com>

Just a question out of sheer curiosity, after Hans Hagen's new article about LuaMetaTeX in the latest TUGboat 42(1), following his earlier article about LMTX in TUGboat 40(1).

If I understood things correctly, LuaMetaTeX is a general-purpose TeX engine (version 2 of LuaTeX), and LMTX is the new version of ConTeXt based on it. So I was wondering, is the integration of LuaMetaTeX planned in TeX Live at some point?

I just had a quick look. There are downloads at <https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Installation>, containing install scripts which download all required components and compile formats so that you end up with a working ConTeXt setup.

But nothing is said about whether LuaMetaTeX could run plain TeX or even LaTeX, and if so how. LuaMetaTeX binaries can be downloaded from

https://lmtx.pragma-ade.com/install-lmtx/tex/

One can then attempt to create formats, not using fmtutil

fmtutil: running `luametatex -ini   -jobname=luametatex -progname=luametatex luatex.ini' ...
startup error : no format file given, quitting

apparently because fmtutil uses -ini while luametatex seems to only recognize --ini

% luametatex -ini luatex.ini 
startup error : no format file given, quitting

% luametatex --ini luatex.ini
startup error : missing find_log_file callback

But then some initializations seem to be missing (find_log_file is new in LuaMetaTeX, wasn't in LuaTeX 1), of the type done possibly in temf-dist/tex/luatex/lualibs, and this is no small endeavour.

So I was just wondering, again out of sheer curiosity, is such work planned in TeX Live at some point?

Like Karl said.

Hopefully it will be included one day, but nobody knows when this will happen.
The fact that the build system is different (CMake, while TL is using
autotools) doesn't help either, but I also never lose hope that CMake
will be available as an option for building TeX Live one day ...

I'm not aware of any attempts to make luametatex work with plain TeX
or LaTeX, but more importantly I would guess that it might be too
early for anyone not willing to adapt quickly to start working on
that, since it's still a pretty much moving target and code keeps
changing all the time.

I used to work on that (see https://github.com/zauguin/luametalatex, if
you're interested. It had both LaTeX and plain TeX) but around April I
started getting weird format corruption issues (loading the format gave
different macro values then dumped...) which couldn't be reproduced in
small examples, making the entire thing unusable. Since neither the
source nor even debugging symbols were available for LuaMetaTeX, debugging
engine issues wasn't fun and reminded me why I normally stick to open
source software.
So it's currently not functional and there are no plans to revive it at
the moment.

Best regards,
Marcel

Hello Karl,

Thank you very much for this very informative response!

Sorry for the delay in answering. I?m still getting acquainted with 
TeX Live?s build system and repository organization, so most of what you 
wrote went over my head. Fortunately there?s a lot of reading material 
about this topic, which I?m reading. I?m still absorbing all the 
information, but I feel I can provide a minimally reasonable reply now.

This is great to know, and surprising to me. Unfortunately it?s hard to 
update TeX Live very often in Guix, because each time that happens it 
causes thousands of packages to be rebuilt. Guix has been updating TeX Live 
more or less once a year. The pace could be increased to about twice a 
year, but more than that would require changes in Guix packaging practices. 
Perhaps improvements can be made there.

Guix uses the texlive-<date>-source tarball for the Build/ part, if I 
understand things correctly. Maybe it would be an improvement to get it 
from a more recent Subversion tag instead. I?ll experiment with it.

Indeed. Thanks for your patience in providing this guidance repeatedly.
I already found a discussion there about packaging for Nix, which is very 
relevant to Guix as well.

Thank you! Also I intend to look more closely at Debian?s TeX Live 
packaging as a reference.

Why is it surprising? Consider it something like a rolling release with
daily updates. I know it is somehow a pain for packagers, but one can
work around that.

Well, that is indeed a pain, I agree. OTOH, it is a *great* CI testing
for *us* ;-) Honestly, I see that this is a problem, but none that we
can fix on our side, right?

I am not sure whether guix allows for something like patches to the
sources. We hardly do updates to the binary sources of the released
branch over the year, only for really critical fixes (like the recent
one for pdftex). So you could also fetch only the diffs and apply them
to the source tarball you have.

All the best

That?s true. This is a generic feature for all Guix packages, not specific 
to LaTeX ones. And of course, if users customize a package then they get to 
keep both pieces if it breaks. :-)

Nice. I wasn?t expecting TeX Live to be a ?rolling release? project. :-)

They didn?t. Learning the background and motivation for these files also 
helped me understand what was going on. Thank you very much for providing 
that information.

I modified l3packages to ship xparse-generic.tex (with a note about removing 
it in the future) and also the two xparse-<date>.sty from /tex/latex/
l3packages/xparse/ in the Subversion repo.

It?s just that I?m not used to rolling releases. :-)
It?s not too much of a pain I think, especially with a big Subversion 
monorepo: just check out a revision and run with it. The only trouble is 
selecting which revision to freeze for 6 months?

But this is a discussion for the tldistro mailing list. :-)

Yes, sometimes patches are applied on top of the upstream sources. We could 
do that indeed. Thanks for the suggestion.

With the mailing list we can get orphan messages. Here's an example, from
Herb Schulz.
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2021-July/047271.html

By an orphan message I mean a message related to an issue, which is not in
the same email thread as the issue.

That said, I'm not sure that Herb's message is an orphan. I can't find the
message he's quoting on the tex-live or the mac-tex lists.

Perhaps Herb is quoting in some off-list email correspondence. Either way,
I believe that with github issues we get better linkage between issues and
messages (or comments as they are called in an issue).

That was my fault. I keep forgetting to Reply All and then submit a separate email to the tex-live list. The original was on that list.

As of today, I get the following error message from xindy:

Is there something I should do to make xindy work again?

But there is no xindy-x86_64.mem in bin/x86_64-linux.

I just updated texlive once again and xindy seems to work.  It may be
that I got and ran the wrong one this morning.

Sorry for the noise.

The mentioned source repository at

standalone.tex is zero bytes in standalone.tds.zip on CTAN. QED.
(It also gets generated as an empty file if I ignore the .tds.zip.)

    https://sourceforge.net/p/standalone/code/ci/default/tree/ does have the 
    standalone.tex with content.

Please contact the standalone maintainer. -k

Hello,

Package cjk-ko requires cjk as a 'hard' dependency.

Hi

Aside: TeX Live is 25 years old this year. I'd be very interested to hear
your views about the future. I fully expect TeX Live to provide TeX running
in the web browser in 25 years from now.

The topic of tomorrow's TeX Hour is 21st century digital typography. The
years 2078 to 2082 will be the 100th anniversary of Don Knuth's creation of
TeX, Metafont and the Computer Modern fonts. Being already more than
middle-aged, I won't be there to celebrate. However, I'll talk about this
at next month's online TeX Conference. My abstract is available at:

https://jfine2358.github.io/post/2021/07/14/towards-21st-century-digital-typography/

The details for the TeX Hour are:

Date and time: Thursday 15 July, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

The videos from last week's TeX Hour (about user experience) will be
available by tomorrow at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7jdDMWgFKJ86BmCJw2e5OV7

The free and online 2021 TeX Conference is 5-8 August. Details at:
https://tug.org/tug2021/.

Happy TeXing in the 21st century

Jonathan

Hi,

TeX Live running in the web browser used to be available at
tex.mendelu.cz. However, the server has not been updated for a long
time, it implements old security protocols which are now considered
unsecure and thus unsupported on my computer, therefore I cannot
access the site. If you have an older system, you can probably
succeed.

Ideally, I guess package authors would list them properly at least, but 
a lot of people don't really track them rigorously.

I know that installing a 'reduced' system is a minor pursuit, but I 
think it's useful to add the data.

Hello!

I hope that it is alright to report this problem to this list. I could 
not find
who might be interested.

The problem is as follows:

1. I did installs and updates with the symbolic links option set. This 
always
 ??? worked just fine.

2. But, I just recently updated to 2021 but forgot to set the symbolic link
 ??? option. The update seemed to work without any error report and TeX 
seemed
 ??? to work as usual.

3. But then, I tried to run tlmgr --all update. This failed with a 
mysterious error
 ??? message. Obviously, an install with links not set after an install 
with links
 ??? set ends up appearing to run the new version, but using the 
programs found
 ? ? through the links set by the old install.

It would be very good if this procedure were flagged as an error.

Could I add that I have been a TeX user since the very first distributed 
version.

    Can't locate File/Copy.pm

It is frustrating when distros remove standard modules.

Anyway, I just changed fmtutil.pl (r59982) to use our own
TeXLive::TLUtils::copy instead of File::Copy. Hope it works better.

    [line breaks]

Maybe it's cron that's forcibly chopping output lines.

    [original symlink problem]

I'm not sure how tlmgr could plausibly detect you intended to use the
symlinks in one case and not the other. Maybe it's intentional. -k

Hi

Within 25 years, TeX Live will provide TeX running in the web browser. And
it will be a mainstream way of using TeX. That is my prediction.

Tomorrow's TeX Hour will present work being done now that will bring this
into being. Important preparatory work has already been done by Mozilla.
I'm doing modest work on simplifying and minimizing TeX Live.

TeX Hour date and time: Thursday 22 July, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.

Subject: config.ps and landscape page size
Message-ID: <e1cxf4xi852t.dlg@nililand.de>

If one create a *nearly* letter landscape page with 

   %nearly letter landscape
   \usepackage[paperwidth=11in,paperheight=8in]{geometry}

and then compile with dvips + pstopdf one get a landscape mediaBox
and Rotation 0 in the pdf:

  /Type/Page/MediaBox [0 0 792 576] /Rotate 0

If one use *exactly* letter size

   \usepackage[paperwidth=11in,paperheight=8.5in]{geometry}

Then the mediabox is portrait and there is a rotation:

   /Type/Page/MediaBox [0 0 612 792]
/Rotate 270


This is a bit of a problem as it affects appearances of form field
widget annotations which then need special code to detect this and
to rotate everything back, and it also makes it difficult to rotate
an individual page in the document: in the first case you must add a
rotation of 90 and in the second of 180 or 0. 

 
I wonder if one could extend config.ps and add real landscape
settings at least for the main page sizes. E.g. if I add this:

@ letterlandscape 11in 8.5in
@+ ! %%DocumentPaperSizes: LetterLandscape
@+ %%BeginPaperSize: LetterLandscape
@+ /setpagedevice where
@+  { pop << /PageSize [792 612] >> setpagedevice }
@+ if
@+ %%EndPaperSize

then I get the right mediabox (which you get also with pdflatex)
also for the letter case

/Type/Page/MediaBox [0 0 792 612]
/Rotate 0

Yes, this is not a bug but long known feature. I am not sure how
geometry exactly works, I try to address this problem in my
zwpagelayout package. Can you try whether it works for you? This was
extremely important for me when sending the PS to a phototypesetter
because the film is quite expensive and I wanted to get it right.

I must say it would be easier to get the options right if
the documentation wouldn't use small caps ;-)

In any case this here

\RequirePackage{expl3}
\ExplSyntaxOn
\pdf_uncompress:
\ExplSyntaxOff

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[a4,Landscape]{zwpagelayout}

\begin{document}
blub
\end{document}

creates also a portrait mediabox:

/Type/Page/MediaBox [0 0 595 842]
/Rotate 270

So it has the same problem. 

And while I use geometry for the example you get the same if you use
the \special directly. 

> This was extremely important for me when sending the PS to a phototypesetter

Well it probably doesn't affect printing, perhaps they even prefer a
portrait page format.  The problem is more that if you add
annotations and similar, then it is pain if effectivly everything is
rotated and the text goes from top to bottom and not from left to
right.

Btw: you did get my message that zwpagelayout is not compatible with 
pdfmanagement-testphase?

Hi Ulrike,

    If one create a *nearly* letter landscape page with 
    ...
    If one use *exactly* letter size

Hmm. Well, I guess it's too late to change any of that behavior now.

    I wonder if one could extend config.ps and add real landscape
    settings at least for the main page sizes. E.g. if I add this:

Sure, that's fine. Glad it works. Can you send me a patch with all the
landscape sizes you want to include?

Thanks,
Karl

I will look at my notes. I think it needs an additional option for
dvips and it was that way in 1993 when I bought my first PS printer.

Hi all,

I found the hint in my notes, it is necessary to specify -t unknown,
it is explained in config.ps. Without this option dvips finds the
nearest paper size. There used to be also film0 and film1 which did
the same but differed in orientation. It was necessary to rotate the
pages to use the width of the film roll but nowadays the
phototypesetters come with better software which allows to override
settings which can minimize the waste.

Yes and if no other solution comes up, this is probably what I will
document: "If you are using a page format which is a landscape
version of known page format, call dvips with -t unknown to get the
right mediabox and avoid problems with rotation of individual pages
and appearances."

I don't want to have to add tests for isls and similar everywhere to
detect this.

But personally I think it would be much better if  dvips
wouldn't do this landscape-look-up by default but only if one opt
for it, but as Karl said it is probably not possible to change this
now.

Subject: Integrating vanilla TeX Live 2021 with Debian
Message-ID: <trinity-edcfd4e9-614c-4966-a3ee-1063b358ed8c-1627249921925@3c-app-webde-bs36>

I am planning to integrate a full installation of Vanilla TeX Live 2021 with my
Debian platform.
?
On the website of the TeX Users Group I read the instructions for integrating
vanilla TeX Live with Debian - <https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html#vanilla>.

Item 2 of these instructions says:

| Ensure that the only Debian TeX Live packages installed are
| tex-common, texinfo, and perhaps lmodern

This instruction indicates that -- when installing vanilla TeX Live via
install-tl -- a subset of Debian-packages needs to be removed from the Debian
installation if present, namely those Debian-packages that make up the set of
Debian TeX Live packages but do not belong to the package-set {tex-common,
texinfo, lmodern}.

The crucial question with this instruction is:

Question 1: How can I find out with a Debian-distribution which
? ? ? ? ? ? Debian-packages make up the set of Debian TeX Live packages?

Item 4 of these instructions is about creating a dummy-package for "telling"
Debian's package-management about the packages provided due to installing
vanilla TeX Live.
There is a link to a file ?debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt --?
<https://www.tug.org/texlive/files/debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt>.

The purpose of this file is to provide the content of the control-file by
means of which the equivs-tool creates the package file/the
"dummy"-.deb-file which in turn can be installed via dpkg.

Despite the actual purpose of the file debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt, in that file
you find the list of packages provided by the vanilla TeX Live 2021
installation.

Question 2: Is it sufficient to check one's Debian installation for the packages
? ? ? ? ? ? mentioned in that list being installed and - if so - having them
? ? ? ? ? ? removed? (This seems not sufficient in case with Debian's own
? ? ? ? ? ? TeX-Live packaging packages being named differently. But I don't know
? ? ? ? ? ? if this is the case.)

Question 3: What am I supposed to do regarding dummy-packages in case I wish to
? ? ? ? ? ? have several releases of vanilla TeX Live installed in parallel,?
? ? ? ? ? ? e.g., 2020 and 2021? With each of them the corresponding?
? ? ? ? ? ? dummy-package linked at <https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html#vanilla>
? ? ? ? ? ? provides the same set of packages, only the Version differs.

The mentioned file ?debian-equivs-2021-ex.txt ?looks like this:

? ? ? ? ? ? Where can I find releases of the Debian Policy Manual prior to
? ? ? ? ? ? 4.5.1.0, especially release 4.1.4 ?

Question 6: Section "5.6.12. Version" of Debian Policy Manual version 4.5.1.0,?
? ? ? ? ? ? <https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version>
? ? ? ? ? ? indicates that in the version-field ?"Version: 2021.99999999-1 "?
? ? ? ? ? ? the string "2021.99999999" denotes the upstream-version (and the?
? ? ? ? ? ? string "-1" denotes the debian-revision).

? ? ? ? ? ? The debian package-search, ?<https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=texlive>
? ? ? ? ? ? reveals that with regular Debian-texlive-packages the
? ? ? ? ? ? upstream-version, which comes from the developers of texlive, seems
? ? ? ? ? ? to be of a specific of a specific pattern.
? ? ? ? ? ? E.g, with Debian-buster (stable) the upstream-version of the?
? ? ? ? ? ? package texlive is "2018.20190227" (and the debian-revision is "2").

? ? ? ? ? ? What is the pattern of these upstream-version-numbers?

? ? ? ? ? ? Does "20190227" the date when the repository was synchronized/
? ? ? ? ? ? rsynced with the TeX-Live-repository on the CTAN-master server for

Question 7: Why do you find the packages "texinfo" and "lmodern" in the

? ?
In item 2 of the above-mentioned instructions you are advised to "ensure that
the only Debian TeX Live packages installed are tex-common, texinfo, and perhaps
lmodern".

Question 8: What is the phrase "perhaps" before "lmodern" intended to indicate?
? ? ? ? ? ? That one should keep Debian's lmodern-package only in case one
? ? ? ? ? ? does not integrate the lmodern-fonts coming with the TeX Live
? ? ? ? ? ? distribution system-wide?

Question 9: Ad ensuring "that the only Debian TeX Live packages installed are
            tex-common, texinfo, and perhaps lmodern":

            Shouldn't the dummy-package be installed **before** uninstalling
? ? ? ? ? ? any Debian-packages?

? ? ? ? ? ? Otherwise Debian packages might be uninstalled as well which do
? ? ? ? ? ? not belong to Debian TeX Live but do depend on it.?

? ? ? ? ? ? (Probably one could adapt the dummy-package's control file to
             remove any already?existing Debian TeX Live installation via
             "Conflicts:"- and?"Replaces:"-directives as described at
? ? ? ? ? ? ?<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#overwriting-files-and-replacing-packages-replaces>
? ? ? ? ? ? ?and then install the dummy-package before running install-tl...,
? ? ? ? ? ? ?this way combining the step of ensuring "that the only
? ? ? ? ? ? ?Debian TeX Live packages installed are tex-common, texinfo, and
? ? ? ? ? ? ?perhaps lmodern" with the step of installing the dummy-package.)

Thank you for taking the time to read my questions.

ACtually, there is no need to remove anything. I have upstream TL 2019,
2020, 2021 and Debian's TeX Live installed.

If you are NOT running short of disk space, no need to uninstall.

Those starting with

Those packages *can* be removed if you want, yes.

You only need to install one equivs package. The only reason it serves
is making dpkg/apt happy.

Irrelevant, the section is there just because it needs to be there.
Since no actual files are installed (besides into the doc directory)
there is nothing of interest in the policy.

But if you want to know what has changed in the policy, you can find all
changes in

This is not really of relevance for you, right? 
	YYYY.XXXXMMDD
YYYY is the release year of TeX Live: TL 2021 currently
XXXXMMDD is the day of the most recent checkout of tlnet for package

Maybe yes.

Again, that can be ignored if you have disk space and be able to set the

I made a short test with latex2nemeth

In the windows command line it fails with

After I tracked down the nemeth.json in the doc folder and copied it

Hello Norbert,

thank you for your quick reply.

[removal of Debian packages in the course of vanilla TeX Live installation]

Actually I might run short of disk space: :-)

I intend to integrate vanilla TeX Live with Knoppix 9.1,
<https://www.knopper.net/knoppix/knoppix910-en.html>,  which is
a live system based on Debian bullseye with some packages of
Debian sid and which can be run from DVD, USB-Stick, 
(micro) SSD-card, external USB-hard-disk etc. The disk space depends
on the medium in use.

(In the context of teaching about TeX/LaTeX, I would like to produce
USB sticks from which course participants can boot a device of the
computer pool in order to have an up-to-date TeX distribution available
immediately.)

[Older releases of the Debian Policy]

> Since no actual files are installed (besides into the doc directory)

[Pattern of upstream-version-numbers]

> This is not really of relevance for you, right?
> YYYY.XXXXMMDD

> XXXXMMDD is the day of the most recent checkout of tlnet for package

Both the policy and the pattern of upstream-version-numbers are
of interest to me:

I think about creating a package which at installation-time
via some script downloads and executes install-tl and changes
environment-variables and at removal time undoes changes of
environment-variables and carries out sudo tlmgr remove --all
or the like. (Probably the script for calling install-tl at
installation-time should provide the opportunity to pass options
to install-tl.)
Such a package would remove previous releases of TeX Live while
installing the current one.

If I ever accomplish this, files will be installed/removed by
the package. 

Sincerely

Ulrich

Hi Ulrike,

    Subject: latex2nemeth failures on windows

Does arara work? texosquery? They're all Java programs.

On Windows, the .exe's are copies of the w32_wrapper which invokes
runscript.tlu, as you found:
$ pwd
../bin/win32
$ ls -l arara.exe latex2nemeth.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 1 karl root 1536 Apr  5  2013 arara.exe*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 karl root 1536 Apr  5  2013 latex2nemeth.exe*
$ cmp arara.exe latex2nemeth.exe
$

So, why the wrapper would end up requiring sh for latex2nemeth but not
arara is a mystery to me. I hope one of the Windows-knowledgeable people
here can look into it.

The shell is not supposed to be needed. The shell script for both arara
and latex2nemeth (and other java programs) is simply (well, the arara has
some more stuff for Cygwin, but I don't think that matters here):

$ pwd
../bin/x86_64-linux
$ cat latex2nemeth
#!/bin/sh
jarpath=`kpsewhich --progname=latex2nemeth --format=texmfscripts latex2nemeth-v1.0.2.jar`
exec java -jar "$jarpath" "$@"
$

    After I tracked down the nemeth.json in the doc folder and copied it
    into the current folder 

I'll write the latex2nemeth maintainers, I guess. I would not ordinarily
guess that a file distributed as "examples/nemeth.json" needs to be in
the runtime. (And polytonic.json needs a prefix.)

       latex2nemeth -e nemeth.json nemeth-test.tex nemeth-test.aux
    succeeded

I'm happy and moderately surprised it works at all on Windows. --best, karl.

Message-ID: <7876de0c-6647-b87c-21c0-c61862bc74bd@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Seeking to install the necessary and sufficient subset of TeX Live to allow me to use XeTeX + "opmac" on a virgin office machine, I downloaded and ran "install-tl-windows.exe", installed scheme "small scheme (basic + xetex, metapost, a few languages)" but found after installation that "opmac" was not installed.

I then launched the TeX Live Manager and asked it to search for "opmac" in All / All / By name and description.  It offered me only "optex", which offer I accepted.  But even after "optex" was installed, I have no "opmac".  How do I ask the TeX Live Manager to locate and install "opmac" ?

opTeX is the current generation of opmac from the same author as opmac. It installs as a format with LuaTeX and should be runnable as optex filename where filename is the name of the file to be processed (and will not need to do \input opmac at the beginning of the file).

The original opmac files which haven?t been updated since 2017 are still available at http://petr.olsak.net/opmac-e.html <http://petr.olsak.net/opmac-e.html> Note that you will also need to install csplain from the TeX Live Manager to get the ams-math dependency.

Thank you Don.  Sadly that is unlikely to be of immediate use, since all my code is predicated on the use of XeTeX rather than LuaTeX (e.g., in the present case, \centerline {\kern -0,5 \margin \vbox to \vsize {\vss \XeTeXpdffile #1.pdf page \pagecount \vss}}\eject).  Maybe one day I will investigate LuaTeX ...

Yet somehow they were included in my home installation of TeX Live 2021 and the TeX Collection 2021 (C:\TeX\Live\2021\texmf-dist\tex\csplain\opmac, C:\TeX\Collection\Live\2021\texmf-dist\tex\csplain\opmac), so they are clearly a part of TeX Live.  Why can the TeX Live Manager not locate them ?

Ah, I was looking at ctan and the csplain directory there is compressed. Try installing csplain with TeX live and you should have opmac.

Hi all,

"tlmgr search opmac" suggests csplain and optex. "tlmgr info csplain"
says in the long description among others: "An important part of the
package is OPmac". The information is hidden but it is there.

I guess because there is no latex2nemeth.jar, only a
latex2nemeth-v1.0.2.jar.
