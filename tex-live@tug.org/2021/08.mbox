FYI, as some of you probably noticed, there was no TL package update
last night, and there will probably be no update tonight either. Some
kind of gpg issue (*not* security related, just expiration administrivia
craziness) going on on the server that I won't be able to solve in time
for today.  Here's hoping for tomorrow. Meanwhile, just \relax :). -k

I've switched to a Linux Mint installation and, after installing TL,
everything works. Good. But now I want to switch to using tcsh as my SHELL
and then nothing works.  The PATH variable is OK and the main difference in
the output of tlmgr conf in tcsh is the following:

=========================== active config files ==========================
Missing argument in sprintf at /usr/local/bin/tlmgr line 6461.
config.ps:        Missing argument in sprintf at /usr/local/bin/tlmgr line
6461.
fmtutil.cnf:      Missing argument in sprintf at /usr/local/bin/tlmgr line
6461.
mktex.cnf:        Missing argument in sprintf at /usr/local/bin/tlmgr line
6461.
pdftexconfig.tex: texmf.cnf:        /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf.cnf
texmf.cnf:        /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf

 "Missing argument in sprintf" !   What is going on?

Hello, Karl,

Since Akira's w32tex site had been closed, the archive in CTAN
(under http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/win32/w32tex/ )
has been lost.

Could you fix the URI in http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/tl64.README
as follows, say:

 If this batchfile do not suit your particular case, you can download
 tl-win64.zip yourself from
-http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/win32/w32tex/TLW64/ and integrate it
+https://texlive.texjp.org/2021/w32tex/current/TLW64/ and integrate it
 manually. Please also consult 00README.TLW64 from the same CTAN
 directory.

I guess that comes from this code:
	  for my $m (sort(qw/fmtutil.cnf config.ps mktex.cnf pdftexconfig.tex/)) {
	    info(sprintf("%-17s %s", "$m:", `kpsewhich $m`));
	  }
and the missing argument means that the backticks didn't work.

What is your
	/bin/sh
pointing at? I hope not csh or so - because that would be badly broken.
/bin/sh should be something bourne/ksh/whatever, but **never** (t)csh.

Backticks should use /bin/sh - AFAIR ...

If these binaries produce incompatible format files, then it might
not be a good idea to offer them. I did not get around yet to test
this myself.

After logging out and re-logging in, everything now works in tcsh

As pointed out, another shell.  Reportedly faster for running shell
scripts than the bloated bash, but not as many interactive niceties.
Choose your poison.

Both csh and tcsh use backtics in the same way as sh/bash/..., which
is why I like to see them in code snippets posted to the web.  Bash
snobs now hold up their noses at backtics and bleat that $(...) should
be used instead (because it is easier to nest using $(...) than
`...`).  IMHO that is a weak argument, but there you go.

Cheers.

Are there packages available for these distributions that will satisfy
tex-related dependencies if one has full texlive installed?  I know there
are such packages for RedHat-based distributions (because I created them)
but I've been unable to find comparable packages for deb-based
distributions.

It seems to me quite usual. If a login shell is changed, it is
necessary to restart the terminal, so logging out an id is even more.

Message-ID: <CAA3P+PqezGZSAN4P9k7m8113L14vs_1nksRS4QPTFbgtxsw6Zg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TeX Live maintainers,

I would be appreciated if you guide me.

I wanted to be built TeX Live ( the version of Tex Live:
'install-tl-20210729' and the version of os: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS) by
downloading the script [1], and building a "basic scheme (plain and latex)".

But at first, I have a problem with 'dvips'. For instance, I have run
'latex test.tex' ( 'test.tex' is a very simple LaTex document in
attachment), but when I wanted to run 'dvips' I got the below error.

$ dvips test.dvi
This is dvips(k) 5.999 Copyright 2019 Radical Eye Software (
www.radicaleye.com)
dvips: ! Couldn't find header file: tex.pro

Then we have used the environment variable and tackle this problem. After
solving this problem, we encountered another problem in 'l3backend-dvips.pro'.
For tackling this problem we added  'DVIPSHEADERS' in the
environment variable again.

DVIPSHEADERS="/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/dvips/base:/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/dvips/l3backend"

Unfortunately, we have encountered another error for 'fonts' again. Now I
add 'DVIPSFONTS' in the environment variable and solved this problem.

DVIPSFONTS="/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/cm"

After fixing 'dvips' problem with the environment variable, then again we
have a problem with 'ps2pdf'.

It seems that the problem is in your installation or something in your
environment may be causing the problem. For checking this problem you can
find my print environment in 'printenv.txt' in the attachment.

Dear Sepideh,
I'm unable to reproduce your problem.

  $ dvips test.dvi
  This is dvips(k) 2021.1 Copyright 2021 Radical Eye Software (www.radicaleye.com)
  ' TeX output 2021.08.02:2006' -> test.ps

I've installed TL under /xopt instead of /usr/local but it doesn't
matter here.  I don't have any TL related environment variable set.

The strange thing is that it works for you after setting the env vars.
The only difference is that you installed "basic scheme" and I
installed "full scheme".  But if it works for you with the env vars
than all necessary files are present and the problem is not
scheme-related.

I suppose that this is pure speculation because ps2pdf is part of
Ghostscript which is *not* part of TeX Live (except for Windows).
You can confirm this with

  which ps2pdf

Unless you changed TeX Live's default setup PostScript files created
by TeX Live are always self-contained (all resources included).  These
files can always be converted to PDF by Ghostscript.

I don't see anything suspicious in your environment except the DVIPS*
variables.  They are not needed.  Please remove them before you
proceed.  TeX Live is portable and all you need is to set up PATH.
But your DVIPS* environment variables contain absolute paths
(beginning with /) to existing files.  With these variables it's
impossible to track down the real problem.

But there is one one thing in your environment which can be the source
of all your trouble:

The installer told you to "add" /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux
to PATH.  You appended it but in most cases it's safer to prepend it.

Suppose that you have remnants of on older TL installation on your
system, for instance a partly removed TL provided by Ubuntu.  There
might still exist an executable /usr/bin/dvips but the directory
/usr/share/texmf-dist is removed.  This can't work.  But with your
environment variables /usr/bin/dvips can "steal" files from your
installation at /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux.

/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/dvips should find all related
files without the need to set any environment variable.

I recommend to *pre*pend /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux to
PATH.  If this doesn't help I'm clueless.

But if it solves your problem, try to cleanup your system.  Remove
all TeX Live packages installed by Ubuntu and tell the package manager
that you want to use the TeX Live distribution you installed yourself
instead of that provided by Ubuntu.

How to do this is described here:

  https://tug.org/texlive/debian.html

The relevant section is "Integrating vanilla TeX Live with Debian".

Once you've installed the equivs package, "apt install" is aware of
your local installation and will not pull in any TL packages even if
they are required by the program you are going to install.

If your system is set up properly and there are no remnants of other
TeX Live installations anymore it shouldn't matter whether TeX Live's
bin directory is prepended or appended to PATH.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Can you please show how you did run the installation?

You seem to have an incomplete installation or broken setup.

My guess is that:
> PATH=/home/sepideh/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux

You are adding the TL installation to the END of the PATH variable, and
so my guess is that you have a different kpsewhich somewhere else.

What does
	which kpsewhich
say?

And, if you do
	PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
	export PATH
	dvips ...
does it work then?

Dear Reinhard and Norber,

Thank you very much for your useful help.

Fortunately, I have changed PATH in my environment variable, and put
"$PATH" at the end, such as the below:

export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"

And my problem was solved.

By using this method I even did not use 'DVIPSHEADERS' and 'DVIPSFONTS'  in
the environment variable and everything has worked correctly.

Thank you again.

Best regards,
Sepideh

Subject: ANN: First Packaging Conference: 9 & 10 November 2021: Submissions
 close 31 August
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf9jHXNg3=Yc3dgE_vHAAiV-+mLOs2NCapvX8=Us_+xeiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

>From the web page http://packaging-con.org/
===
Software complexity is on the rise, but thanks to package managers, reusing
software is easier than it?s ever been. In 2021, nearly every operating
system, language ecosystem, and framework has a package manager or several.
Package managers take over where your compiler left off; integrating
different versions of packages and ensuring they can be installed safely,
reliably, and in a compatible configuration on your system. Where compilers
integrate large applications, package managers integrate software
ecosystems.
===

Some topics of interest for the conference are:
* Package management vs dependency management
* Reproducibility in package managers
* Reliability/robustness of software ecosystems
* Dependency solving: modeling, methods, and scalability

I hope some TeX Live maintainers will attend, and perhaps even speak. The
conference is 9 & 10 November, and submissions close 31 August. They're
looking for 20 minutes + 10 minute Q+A talks. All talks will be held live
via video chat. There are also 2 minute lightning talks (perhaps for the
TikTok generation).

The conference is organised in conjunction with https://numfocus.org/, who
sponsor many projects including MathJax (see
https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects).

I learnt about the conference at
https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/packaging-con-call-for-presentations-about-package-management/7623

Hi Team,

We are trying to install Latex package on RHEL-7.9 operating system. I have installed Texlive and Texstudio packages on Linux operating system, but we could able to install complete packages. Because when we check on windows side there we could able to see more than 2000 MikTex packages are available after installed. But while checking from Linux side, only 285 packages are available. So we need to install the complete package on Linuc operating system. Please let me know how to install the complete Texlive packages on Linux operating system.

Hi,

TeX Live is not MikTeX, it is two distributions. 

Just make a TeX Live installation using rhe installer from tug.org (not the RHEL repositories) and you should be fine

Thanks Jonathan

After returning from my camping trip I'll try to remember to submit a talk. There are too many things I can talk about, probably submitting two talks ..

> Software complexity is on the rise, but thanks to package managers, reusing software is easier than it?s ever been. In 2021, nearly every operating system, language ecosystem, and framework has a package manager or several. Package managers take over where your compiler left off; integrating different versions of packages and ensuring they can be installed safely, reliably, and in a compatible configuration on your system. Where compilers integrate large applications, package managers integrate software ecosystems.
> ===
> 
> Some topics of interest for the conference are:
> * Package management vs dependency management
> * Reproducibility in package managers
> * Reliability/robustness of software ecosystems
> * Dependency solving: modeling, methods, and scalability
> 
> I hope some TeX Live maintainers will attend, and perhaps even speak. The conference is 9 & 10 November, and submissions close 31 August. They're looking for 20 minutes?+ 10 minute Q+A talks.?All talks will be held live via video chat. There are also 2 minute lightning talks (perhaps for the TikTok generation).

After running busily more than an hour, an RHEL 7, it failed with this output:

Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:

Hi

Aside: The TeX Hour on 26 August is of special interest to TeX Live.
Knuth's page description language DVI is a portable format, provided the
recipient has fonts that match the fontnames in the DVI file (and there are
no specials). Adobe's PDF portability follows from embedded fonts. The TeX
Hour on 26 August will focus on achieving similar portability for the
typesetting of TeX source files.

Links to 8 accessibility talks at recent TeX conference. Topics for TeX
Hour, to the end of August.

At the TeX Conference last weekend there were 8 talks that focussed on
accessibility. I think that's a record. The subject of the TeX Hour this
Thursday is "Obstacles to Accessible TeX". This includes technical, social
and human problems. Sharing experience and a fair partnership between blind
and sighted are crucial for avoiding and removing obstacles.

One of the talks is a 30 minute conversation between Jonathan Godfrey and
Jana Schroeder,  both of whom are blind. I had the honor of facilitating
this conversation.  Even if you don't go to the TeX Hour, I think it's well
worth listening to. It's available at
https://youtu.be/KNLJwjKg7EM

Here are the TeX Hour details:

Date and time: Thursday 12 August, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.

The URLs of all 8 talks are below, in the Appendix. I particularly
recommend the talk on tactile mathematics by Kolesnikov, Maneki, Cantino,
Beezer, and Volker Sorge

TeX Hours are always Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time. Future TeX Hours are
Thursday 19 Aug: XML to TeX to PDF - when PDF is one of many rendering of
XML
Thursday 26 Aug: Portable TeX Documents - reducing and resolving
dependencies of TeX source

with best regards

Subject: install-tl-windows.exe on terminal
Message-ID: <CAG5iGsCPCdqYehXkCQkUb9tQ_TmRK_qnzOBGazM89DpPeENmPQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to install my subset  "smalltex" on Windows 10 via a  ssh
connection.
Almost a success, but I need  a "windows gui" environment to unpack the
install-tl-windows.exe
 -- so it would be nice to have  an option "unpackonly=<folder>" or just
make available an install-tl-windows.zip

I am using the following smalltex.bat:

The smalltex.profile uses the scheme-infraonly, and the idea it to keep all
under a  folder
(at the moment tex-2021-08-16-1629134177-441963500 )

install-tl-windows -portable -no-gui -profile=smalltex.profile
fails (see install-tl.log) so I have to call it.
After that, tlmgr runs fine until the end.

Hi All,

I am attempting to do a new installation of tex live 2021 on a new 
installation of fedora 34.  When running the installer, I received the msg:

Enter command: I
Installing to: /usr/local/texlive/2021
install-tl: mkdir(/usr/local/texlive/) failed for tree 
/usr/local/texlive/2021: Permission denied at tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm 
line 999, <STDIN> line 4.



What is the best solution?  Should I just mkdir /usr/local/texlive and 
give write permission to all?

I found something from archlinux at:

https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=183146

that recommends creating a new user:

==============

I also recommend *not* installing as root. This is also in line with 
upstream's recommendation. What I did was create a new user and group 
(texlive:texlive). As root, I also created the directory 
/usr/local/texlive and made sure it was owned by the texlive user. Then 
I logged in as that user to install. This works well. Neither the 
installer nor later use of the utilities can touch your home directory 
or system files. There is no downside to this - it is no less convenient 
than having the installation owned by root. So you gain a security 
benefit for no cost. (Or minimal cost: you have to create a single user 
and group, make one new directory and chmod that directory appropriately.)

# adjust options as desired
useradd -d /usr/local/texlive -m -g texlive -r -s /bin/sh texlive

Set a password for the new account, and check ownership and permissions 
on the new directory:

drwxr-xr-x   7 texlive texlive 4.0K Meh  26 02:14 .

Then log in as texlive and install.

=================

What is the recommended way to solve this permission problem?

Hello,
the reommendation from archlinux sounds very reasonable.
If you are the only TeX user on the system, you could also install it 
somewhere in your home-directory, or wherever you have the right 
permissions.
To install it in /usr/local, you need root permissions, sudo would be 
your friend.
Good luck
Alois

How do you used to install TeX Live earlier? What did you run to install TeX
Live this time?

It depends on your experience, how you plan to use and maintain TeX Live
installation.

Which has following topic name: "'Best' way to install programs?" dates 2014
and has very good answers:

  Even if you compile from-source, you should still install using pacman.
  PKGBUILDs are your friends.

  I'd highly recommend staying away from compiling from source. If you don't
  know how to make a PKGBUILD for whatever it is you're compiling by hand,
  you'll probably regret doing it.

  Wether you build packages from source or use binary packages from the repos
  you should install using pacman. If you want a package that is not in the
  repos nor in the AUR find the source and write PKGBUILD for it. After that
  feel free to submit it to AUR.

And even this one
  
  TeX is an exception. There are two good ways to install TeX Live. One is to
  use pacman. The other is to use the upstream installer....

I use both: I install TeX Live packages provided by distribution (thank
goodness I'm using Archlinux not RPM/DEB based distributions).

> that recommends creating a new user:

If you don't understand why you need a new user why would you bother go that
way?

Quote from 'cfr' user (which advice you want to follow):

  I also recommend *not* installing as root. This is also in line with
  upstream's recommendation.

That's not entirely true. Quoting from http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

  You do not need to be root (administrator on Windows) to install, use, or
  manage TeX Live. Indeed, we recommend installing it as a normal user, except
  perhaps on MacOSX, where it's conventional to install as administrator.
  (Some information about shared installations.) As always, you need to have
  permission to write into the destination directory, but TeX Live itself does
  not care if you are root or not.

You have option: either to install as root or as ordinary user but in that
case you have to have write permissions to installation directory.

Just run as an user (if there is no such directory)

$ mkdir /usr/local/opt/texlive

If you don't have root rights then you don't have write permissions to
/usr/local/opt directory and that command would fail.

Follow three top answers: use your distribution package manager and your
distribution packages.

> --Bob

P.S. If you really want to install TeX Live (TUG, not distribution packages)
you have some options. There are many ways depending on context: what kind of
system you have, how many free space you have, what is your daily tasks, how
much you experienced are, do you want to understand how your system work and
etc. Due to these many factors the TeX Live manual doesn't describe any
particular way because that would be treated (by someone) as "recommendation".
And of course it's impossible to cover all possible variants.

Nevertheless, I'll try to describe two possible ways.

1. Install as root. When this applicable: you have root rights (you could run
  commands through sudo), have enough free disk space and you don't mind to do
  administration task, for example, to update TeX Live packages.

  I won't tell you how to check if you able to run commands through sudo, you
  could check that yourself.

  I suppose that you want to install TeX Live into /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021
  because /usr/local (or /, or /usr, or /usr/local/opt) has plenty of space,
  at least 9Gb.

  You downloaded install-unx.tar.gz, unpacked it, changed current directory to
  install-2021XXXX and now run 'install-tl' as root:

    $ sudo ./install-tl

  You will be asked to where install TeX Live. You could either change path in
  menu and installer will create necessary directory itself or create it
  separately, for example, before you run 'install-tl'

    $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021
    $ sudo ./install-tl

  Also you could choose either to make symbolic links in /usr/local/bin
  (actually I don't remember to where the links are created) or not but then
  you have to know how to add /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux to
  PATH variable.

  In general, it is very simple. But there are pitfalls.

  a) The installation will be owned by root user so to make any changes, for
  example, to update packages, you have to run commands as root. For instance,
  to update installed packages:

    $ sudo tlmgr update --self
    $ sudo tlmgr update --all

  b) If you chosen to make symbolic links in /usr/local/bin you couldn't use
  several TeX Live installations in parallel in simple way (see below) and you
  have to remove previous TeX Live installation if you want to upgrade (2021
  -> 2022) (I don't use symlinks so I actually don't check correctness of
  this).

  c) If you don't use symlinks in /usr/local/bin, for example, you have
  several TeX Live installation in parallel, say /usr/local/opt/texlive/2020,
  /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021, /usr/local/opt/texlive/2022 (in future) you
  should know how to append 'bin/x86_64-linux' path to PATH variable (or
  change it). Details depend (a bit) on what shell do you use: bash, zsh,
  tcsh, fish...

2. Install as ordinary user. There are two variants here: you either have root
  rights but still want to install TeX Live as ordinary user or you don't have
  root rights but have enough free space, say in your home directory.

  a) If you have root rights just run

      $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021
      $ sudo chown $(id -un).$(id -gn) /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021
      $ ./install-tl

    Note that you should run last command as ordinary user. Then you have to
    add /usr/local/opt/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux to your user PATH
    variable (see 1.c) above).

  b) If you don't have root rights but have free space in $HOME directory. Run
  installer but choose $HOME/texlive/2021 as installation directory. Don't
  forget to add $HOME/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux to PATH variable!

As you see there are many ways to install TeX Live and they vary by details
depending on context.

Hi,

TeX Live should preferably be installed by a regular user but
/usr/local is writable by root only. When making the very first
installation you must create directory /usr/local/texlive as root and
change its ownership to the user who will the run installation.

Hi All,

I want to thank Zdanek, Vladimir, and a third person who replied 
privately.  Vladimir, I have to confess that the warm welcome you 
extended may not be completely deserved; I'm installing Tex Live on 
fedora 34 not Archlinux.  I only ended up looking at some Archlinux 
documentation since I was confused by the tug.org installation instructions.

Let me summarize my what I think I have learned from the instructions 
and the discussion.  Please let me know if any of the the following is 
incorrect, especially the paragraph with the asterisks since that's my 
situation.

For linux, tug.org recommends installing Tex Live as a normal user---not 
as root.  Similarly, tug.org recommends using their installer---not the 
linux distribution's package manager.

**If Tex Live is being installed on a workstation used by one person 
with sudo rights, then the person could use sudo mkdir 
/usr/local/texlive to create the directory and then use chown to 
transfer ownership of /usr/local/texlive from root to the regular user 
account.  After that the regular user account would be used to install 
and maintain Tex Live.**

If the person using the workstation does not have sudo rights, then the 
person can install Tex Live into their home directory by resetting TEXDIR.

If more than one person would be using the workstation, then a separate 
user account could be created for the purpose of installing and 
maintaining Tex Live.  (Even if only one person is using the workstation 
that person might prefer to have a separate user account for installing 
and maintaining Tex Live.)

All of the above assumes that there is sufficient space in the 
installation directory.

Thank you, again!

--Bob

Hi

There were several talks at the recent TeX Conference that relied on XML to
TeX to PDF and related technologies. Tomorrow's TeX Hour provides a place
to discuss this shared theme. Briefly, it's a good idea if you want
multiple high-quality outputs from a single source file, and authors
willing to make the extra effort to achieve this.

This meeting is dedicated to the memory of Sebastian Rahtz, who was a great
advocate of XML and TeX. He was a major contributor not just to TeX (think
TeX Live) but also the Text Encoding Initiative and in particular their XSL
stylesheets.

Here are the details for tomorrow's TeX Hour on XML to TeX to PDF.
Date and time: Thursday 19 August, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:

Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

Last week's TeX Hour was on Obstacles to accessible TeX. We had a good
discussion. The videos are available at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7jJoon5dJSu7svTgsG1dNGc

Next week's TeX Hour will be on Portable TeX Documents - reducing and
resolving dependencies of TeX source. The TeX Conference videos are now
available. The appendix gives links to the 8 accessibility talks at the
conference. I particularly recommend "Code and Math in the Dark" (which I
was privileged to host) and "Tactile Mathematics" (with a cast of 5).

with best regards

Jonathan

Hi Bob,

    Similarly, tug.org recommends using their installer---not the 
    linux distribution's package manager.

I don't exactly "recommend" using the native TL installer. Do I?
Have I forgotten what I wrote? If you can tell me where you saw this,
I'd like to review it.

What I intend to say in this regard is that 1) if you use the distro
version, please don't expect our instructions and descriptions to apply,
and 2) often distros are not up to date (but sometimes they are).

In general, plenty of people use TL as packaged by their distros, and
that's perfectly fine. I'm happy when anyone uses TeX in any way they
wish :). 

    install Tex Live into their home directory by resetting TEXDIR.

Where "TEXDIR" is a setting that only exists inside install-tl.
It's not an environment variable that you can set and will magically
change everything. At least not in upstream TL. (And I'd be quite
surprised if any distro supports such a TEXDIR envvar, but what do I know.)

Thanks for the nice summary, in any case. --best, karl.

Hi all,

I know people who use 5 years old TeX Live even now and are happy with
it. I can undestand that distro's TeX is the right version for many
users although it can be incomplete and not always up-to-date. This is
not a problem for the majority of documents owing to long-time
stability of TeX. On the contrary, there are developers, testers and
people with special needs who cannot be satisfied with distro's TeX.
One of my recent projects was typesetting a book in 56 languages
including those which do not use latin alphabet. You can thus
understand that I am such person with special needs. Even if you do
not know whether distro's TeX is sufficient for you and decide to use
TeX Life, it is OK. At least you learn how to install and maintain it.

Hi,

I will not be able to join the TeX Hour because I will be busy with my
work till late night. I have therefore decided to mention my web with
slides to my two lectures:

http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/lectures/

The slides are in Czech but maybe you could understand at least
something. My ideas are:

1. Use XML where it is strong, i.e. validating editor which offers
attributes and elements according to contexts, it even dynamically
switches the spellcheck dictionary in the multilingual documents
taking into account the lang and xml:lang attributes. And XSLT is good
for nonlinear transformation from XML to TeX (it needs information
from distant parts of the source documents).

2. Use TeX where it is strong, i.e. typesetting.

3. Don't do XSLT to TeX primitives but to macros which are then
defined in a package. This makes everything concise and more easily
debuggable.

You can mention my web in the TeX Hour as well as anywhere else.

Sincerely,
Zden?k Wagner

Hi Karl,

I went back through the installation instructions, and I could not find 
any place where you recommended using the native TL installer instead of 
the linux distribution's package manager.  This may have been a 
prejudice based on something I had read in the past.  Also, some years 
ago I installed TL using the package manager in Linux mint.  I remember 
that there were problems with that installation, and I switched to using 
the native TL installer.  I apologize for putting words in your mouth 
about preferring one to the other.

I think the installation instructions are excellent.  The only part that 
I found confusing was having permission to write to /usr/local/texlive 
(which I previously solved by being too generous with write 
permissions).  The suggestion by several, especially by Zdenek, of 
changing the ownership of /usr/local/texlive was quite helpful.

All the best to you, too!

--Bob

Subject: acroread 9.5.5 (linux) shows binary garbadge after page numbers
Message-ID: <YR95yhLURD+RpRi2@hl.fritz.box>

Hi TL team,

I just notice that with TL-2021 pdflatex, I see binary garbage after page numners (see upper left in attached screenshot).

looking into the PDFs generated by TL-20 and TL-21 I see:

---8<---    TL-20  ---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---
  /PageLabels <<
    /Nums [
      0
      <<
        /P (1)
      >>
      1
      <<
        /P (2)
      >>
---8<---    TL-21  ---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---
/PageLabels <<
    /Nums [
      0
      <<
        /P <feff0031>
      >>
      1
      <<
        /P <feff0032>
      >>
---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---


so the new byte order mark are part of that problem (and of course crappy old and broken acroread for linux:-(

I also find byte order marks in some but not all of the PDF metadata (and only there and page numbers):

72 0 obj
<<
  /Author <feff00200048006100720061006c00640020004b00f6006e006900670020>

  /Producer (pdfTeX-1.40.23)
  /Subject ()
  /Title <feff005300480045004...
  /Trapped /False
>>
endobj


"fun" fact aside: acroread correctly displays the Author and Title in document properties:-(


so my more generic questions:

- why are byte order marks inserted for some trival 7-bit-ASCII strings like page numbers (1) (2) (3) etc ?
  here they're not needed for sure -- author names and titles are a different story of course...
  
- why do some PDF metadata not have byte order marks ?

- is this a problem for other PDF tools/viewers too ?



thanks for any comments (other than "don't use acroread" ;-)

at least for now I can continue using TL-20,
and I think about writing a small PDF editing/hacking script using

    sed 's/ <feff/ </g'

;-)

pagelabels are created by hyperref, so make a minimal example and
report it in its issue tracker.

(but imho unicode is allowed there, this enables page labels in
other scripts, so probably the problem is really acroread.)

Adobe Reader for Linux is 32-bit only and has tons of unfixed
vulnerabilities including remote code execution.

https://www.cvedetails.com/product/497/Adobe-Acrobat-Reader.html?vendor_id=53

We can now also add broken Unicode support to the list of problems.

Seriously, you'll have to find another viewer.

The byte order mark is required for Unicode encoded strings (16-bit) in 
the PDF format and is used to distinguish it from the PDFDocEncoding 
(8-bit).

If this is not displayed by your PDF viewer correctly, then the PDF 
viewer is to blame.

However, hyperref also provides option 'pdfencoding=auto' since many 
year. In this modus, hyperref first encodes the strings to Unicode.
Then, the strings are tried to recode to PDFDocEncoding and uses them,
if this succeeds. Otherwise (with characters outside PDFDocEncoding),
the Unicode string is used.

That should fix your problem for simple page numbers or bookmarks, ...
The strings with Unicode characters will still look odd in your outdated
PDF viewer, but should look fine in other viewers.

Yours sincerely
   Heiko

Newer versions of Acrobug are even worse.

Hi

Summary: I think Portable TeX Documents are a great idea. (Disclaimer: I'm
the inventor.) Come to tomorrow's TeX Hour to discuss.

Date and time: Thursday 26 August, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.

OVERVIEW
Adobe released PostScript (PS) in 1982, and Portable Document Format (PDF)
in 1993. Many production and user problems in PS were fixed in PDF, which
remained a proprietary standard until 2008. PS and PDF were both based on
very sound technical and business decisions. PDF so to speak created a safe
and self-contained world for the distribution of typeset documents. PS and
PDF are both page description languages.

In 1982 Don Knuth created a safe and self-contained world for typesetting
that was rapidly adopted by mathematicians and physicists. It includes the
DVI page description language.  PDF arrived 11 years after TeX,  and Sergey
Lesenko's DVIPDF followed three years later.

TeX produces identical outputs, given identical inputs. PDF does something
similar. It also has a structured storage system for storing fonts,
graphics, multimedia objects and other resources. This allows PDF to
guarantee identical inputs to its page description language.

I firmly believe that Portable TeX Documents (PTD) will greatly benefit TeX
users and developers, just as PDF benefitted its users, developers and
Adobe. As a loyal and responsible member of the TeX community, I feel
obliged to share this opinion with the community, both promoting it and
fairly considering objections and alternatives.

INVITE
You're invited to tomorrow's TeX Hour: Portable TeX Documents (PTD).

TECHNICAL TEASER
Here's a technical teaser. Each PTD has document and typesetting inputs,
and optionally typesetting outputs. Every tree of files checked into git
has a secure hash, which is unfeasible to forge. These secure hashes are
keys that characterize the PTD, including its inputs and outputs.

Besides version control, git is very efficient at turning a secure hash
into its tree of files, provided it has access to a repository that
contains all files in the tree. All font metric and style files that have
ever been uploaded to CTAN will occupy only a few gigabytes when stored in
git, and most TeX documents will require perhaps only 50MB of such files.

So downloading on the fly resources required from the typesetting of a TeX
source document is entirely practical. The source could be CTAN, or
somewhere else. This is because git is a peer-to-peer distributed file
system. Further, like a well set up website, git doesn't fetch resources
it's already got.

One hard part of implementing PTD, besides getting resources and overcoming
inertia, is specifying the exact form of the resource tree of a PTD. I hope
that once that part is in practice solved others will use it. This will
allow other parts of the standard to evolve. It took Abode 11 years to go
from PostScript to PDF.
