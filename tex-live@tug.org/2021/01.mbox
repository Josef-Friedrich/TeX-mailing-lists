Subject: Can I romove "doc" file folder ?
Message-ID: <272957935.629477.1609561664274.JavaMail.zimbra@sjtu.edu.cn>


Hi!

I am a user of Mactex from China. 

My computer is a MacBook air M1. Its storage is very very limited. Now, I wanna clean my mac. 

I find the file "doc" which contain all document is very large (about 2.7G). The location is /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/doc/.

So, can I remove the "doc" file folder? If I do, any issues may occur?

Thanks!

Hi,

I looked into the manual and cannot find the way how to safely remove
the documentation. If you just remove the doc folder, nothing bad
happens but it will probably be restored when you update Mactex. As I
remember, it is possible to uncheck documentation during the initial
installation.

You can disable the installation of doc file with
tlmgr option docfiles 0

Throwing documentation away is never a good idea.  A better solution
is to move the doc directory to a cheap USB stick and replace it by a
symlink which points to the doc directory on the stick.

It's necessary to insert the stick before running "tlmgr update".
Be careful!

The advantage of this approach is that nothing gets lost and
everything works as usual, except that you get an error message when
you run texdoc while the USB stick isn't mounted.

It's also possible to move the whole /usr/local/texlive tree to the
stick and to replace /usr/local/texlive by a symlink.  In this case
you don't have to worry whether the stick is mounted or not when
running "tlmgr update" because tlmgr itself is on the stick.

Regards,
  Reinhard

-----------------

When switching to the 2019 installation (using macOS TeX Live Utility)
lualatex and pdflatex compile the same file without any error message.
Neither dinbrief.cls nor xcolor.sty have changed between 2019 and 2020,
thus it must be something else, but I can't find the reason.

Older stackexchange-entries point to problems with \AtBeginDocument,
but neither dinbrief.cls nor xcolor.sty use that.
This is not limited to macOS, we observed the same error on Linux.

Any help is appreciated

The class redefines \document and \enddocument,
which has always been a very bad thing to do since
the first release of LaTeX2e.

Apparently, they do it just for injecting a compatibility
layer for LaTeX2.09.

https://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2021-January/024797.html

Hi Norbert

Summary: Thank you for your interest in a reworked TeX for modern times.
Here are some good ideas (from Yihui Xie and Sam O'Connor) that I'd like
the TeX Live team to develop further.

You wrote that you're eager to hear my proposal for a reworked TeX for
modern times.

Here's an example, but it's not my work. It's TinyTeX. It's author Yihui
Xie writes that it is a lightweight, cross-platform, portable, and
easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live. In particular, it
works well for R users.

Here's the URLs for the project webpage, the CRAN entry, and The R Journal
(which is typeset using TeX). And also from the author's 2019 TUGBoat
article on TinyTeX.

https://yihui.org/tinytex/
https://yihui.org/tinytex/#motivation
https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tinytex/index.html
https://journal.r-project.org/

The author of TinyTeX thanked the TeX Live team for their work,
particularly offering options to remove source code and documentation from
the installation. Also, the author wrote an article on TinyTex for the 2019
TUGBoat.
https://yihui.org/tinytex/#acknowledgements
https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb40-1/tb124xie-tinytex.pdf

My view is that TinyTeX has been a great enabler for the authors and
editors of The R Journal. I suggest that other journals and communities
would benefit from TinyTeX or something similar where "you install [only
the] LaTeX packages you actually need".

Related to this is Sam O'Connor's tex-live announcement: TeX Live on AWS
Lambda.
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2018-March/041304.html

I've posted this to the tex-live list, as being more relevant than
texhax and tug-members. Finally, you're welcome to come to my TeX Office
hour tomorrow (Thursday) on zoom, and appreciate that my preferred hour is
awkward in your time zone.

But I'd like to give Sam and Yihui a chance to read and respond to this
message first. I'll contact them off-list about this. And perhaps we could
establish a more convenient time zone.

with best regards

Jonathan

Do you really think you are telling me anything new? I have been in
contact with him for years now about TinyTeX and helped adjust things so
that it works for TinyTeX.

Jonathan, open your eyes, you are carrying owls to Athens.

Hi all,

what is needed is not just TinyTeX but removal of TeX from dependences
in R. What I need is to process automatically R code on a tiny
computer with a very small disk space and never use TeX on it.
Unfortunatelly R installation fails because it tries to install a huge
TeX distro. Thus unless the R maintainers do not change their minds,
TinyTeX will not help here.

TinyTeX is just a TeX Live installer which doesn't default to scheme-full but
instead only installs this subset of packages:

https://tinytex.yihui.org/pkgs-custom.txt

Whether that is more ?modern? is debatable.

There is tectonic which is quite interesting and worked ok for me when
testing it with some of my (admittedly not very complicated) documents.
It installs needed packages from texlive automatically during compile
and it doesn't need a texlive locally. On my system, Fedora 33,
tectonic places downloaded stuff in ~/.cache/Tectonic .


Tectonic is a modernized, complete, self-contained TeX/LaTeX engine,
powered by XeTeX and TeXLive.

Dear Roland,
(Cc: the TeX Live mailing list)

> Info: Running Texdoc not installed in the current TEXMFMAIN.


This first line of the message you got indicates that your TeX Live
(and so as Texdoc) is not installed in the standard way as expected.

How exactly you set your PATH? How did you call texdoc?

This seems not the issue of Texdoc itself but about TeX Live installation.
Maybe TeX Live experts can provide a better guide than me, so I'm
transferring this thread also to the tex-live mailing list.

Best,
Takuto

Hi,

it seems that `forest` is has undeclared dependencies. Judging from
https://github.com/sasozivanovic/forest/blob/master/forest.dtx, they
seem to be:

pgfopts, etoolbox, environ, xparse, and inlinedef.

Cheers, Cassian

PS: Just checking, this _is_ the right way to go about this, no? I would
also happily submit a pull request or similar when I encounter issues
like this in the future. (I am a bit obsessed with project specific,
minimal tex installations (using `nix`), so I encounter these kind of
issues quite frequently).

Ok, added for the next update.

    PS: Just checking, this _is_ the right way to go about this, no? 

Yes.

    also happily submit a pull request or similar when I encounter issues
    like this in the future. 

The only additional bit that would ease the job for me is if you had
time to check for the TL package name corresponding to the LaTeX
packages being required. Usually they are the same, but not always. In
the list above, the only difference is that xparse = l3packages in
TL-land.

It's not a big deal, I do this check anyway, but since you mentioned ...

    (I am a bit obsessed with project specific, minimal tex
    installations (using `nix`), 

I understand. It makes for a lot of extra work, but so be it.

    so I encounter these kind of issues quite frequently).

Well, the ideal fix would be to implement loading packages on demand for
TL, as MiKTeX has, so that these static dependency lists are not so
important. Unfortunately there are many complications to doing so, and I
don't think Norbert or I is likely to ever make it a priority. Should
you have any interest in looking into it, it's been discussed on the
list several times (over the years...), so should be findable in the
archives. I don't have any specific urls at hand, though.

Best,
Karl

Missed one, `tikz` (so pgf).

And `environ`, one of its dependencies, has an undeclared dependency on
`trimspaces`.

Maybe it would be an idea to go through the ctan database some time and
just find all uses of `RequirePackage` to semi-automatically improve
this situation?

This would not be so difficult, I always install scheme-full hence
making such a script is a matter of minutes. However, it would create
too many dependencies. For instance, my zwpagelayout needs color only
conditionally. If you do not prepare crop marks in color, the package
is not loaded. A few packages are loaded only if they are already
installed and zwpagelayout then offers additional functionality, if
they are not found, some functionality is disabled. It also matters
whether the package is used with xelatex, pdflatex, or latex with
dvips. It makes no sense to require pdflatex-support packages if a
user wants xelatex only. There may be more such packages.

This leads me to a question. There are hard dependencies (needed
always) and soft dependencies (needed if a special functionality is
requested). Is there a conditional dependency? For instance, hard
dependency for use in xelatex but not needed at all with other
engines.

Hi,

I tried this already at some point, and was bitten by exactly this.

Some packages use `usepackage`, some `RequirePackage`, I even saw some,
which created there own macro, internally doing something like 
`\RequirePackage{#1}`,
which made this such a hard problem it was virtually impossible.

I found some missing requirements, but many false positives or optional 
dependencies or
not found dependencies, that it wasn't really worth it.

Without a proper mechanic to declare dependencies that also supports 
optional dependencies,
this is an unsolvable problem and the only thing that will be able to 
solve this in part is to download
a known file if it is not found in the system.

This however will still create problems as there is no way to specify 
versions, so the download might
fetch a newer, incompatible version.

Regards
Max

Indeed, as has been said many times before, and no doubt will be many
times more, TeX Live is not an operating system and we are (at least I
am) not going to introduce every conceivable kind of
dependency. Especially since sometimes the dependency cannot be
determined until runtime, so no full solution without dynamic loading is
possible. Let alone compatibility issues, which are really impossible to
determine.

What's relevant for TL, as I've said, are hard/100%-always-required
dependencies. I don't want to list engine-dependent or
anything-else-dependent dependencies except as "soft", which are just
for documentation, as I wrote in the description on pkgcontrib.html.

Other than that, people who choose to do a "minimal" installation will
just have to put up with installing the optional dependencies that they
wish to use themselves. That's life. --best, karl,

I see "depend trimspaces" already present in the package definition for
environ. --thanks, karl.

You need xzdec installed, it is in the Debian packages
	xzdec

Nothing in this report is relevant for TeX Live itself, it is purely a
Debian problem.

Message-ID: <119954162-81df0ad28c0cd56b0825b6bd1f80e739@pmq2v.m5r2.onet>

Hello,
This is my first post in this group.
I have installed TexLive in Dec last year; that is the ver. "tlmgr revision 57119 (2020-12-13 00:40:00 +0100)". I also run Ubuntu 20.04.
According to "3.4.4 System font con?guration for XeTeX and LuaTeX" on "The TeX Live Guide?2020", we are supposed to add a font file "texlive/2020/texmf-var/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf" to "/etc/fonts/conf.d/" and rename it as "09-texlive.conf". I simply the file to its source.
It turns out after doing so, I have started having issues with `snap` and `fontconfig`. I have currently snap 2.48.2 and snapd 2.48.2 installed. The errors are following:
?
error: cannot perform the following tasks:
- Run configure hook of "zoom-client" snap if present (run hook "configure":
-----
Fontconfig warning: "/etc/fonts/fonts.conf", line 5: unknown element "its:rules"

Fontconfig error: "/etc/fonts/fonts.conf", line 7: invalid attribute 'version'

?
This is only one application but errors are caused by any application which need to be installed or refreshed by snap. If I remove "09-texlive.conf" and re-cache all fonts:
rm -f ~/.cache/fontconfig/*
sudo rm -f /var/cache/fontconfig/*
sudo fc-cache -rv
?
snap gets working again.
?
Is it possible that the font I have mentioned is not compatible with the new version of fontconfig? Ubuntu 20.04 has updated the library to the following:
?
?
$ dpkg -l | grep fontconfig
ii? fontconfig??????????????????????????????????? 2.13.1-2ubuntu3?????????????????????? amd64??????? generic font configuration library - support binaries

I don't think you've mentioned the font by name ?

I'll also note that I don't usually install the binary, and I do not
usually make the fonts available to the system for two reasons:

(i.) I do a full install.  Selecting a font in e.g. libreoffice or
gucharmap when hundreds are present from TL, often with odd names,
is impractical.

(ii.) When I last checked, some of the TL versions were older than
what I have installed on my system - in that case, it is unclear
which version would be used.

However, for specific fonts I do occasionally write a conf file so I
can use them outside xetex, but limiting what I want (and I don't
normally see any reason to use Type1 fonts, but I guess YMMV).  for
example: (in 09-texlive.conf in the past, but updated for 2020
usage):

<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'>
<fontconfig>
  <dir>/opt/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/arkandis/berenisadf</dir>
  <dir>/opt/texlive/2020/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/paratype</dir>
</fontconfig>

But for the specific fontconfig errors, google found e.g.
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=235643 from 2018
(see post #6 et. seq and particularly #15 for an addition to
fonts.dtd which might fix this.)

I guess the problem is in snap.  Googling for snap Fontconfig
warning: unknown element "its:rules" produces a lot of results.
Maybe whoever created one or other of the snap packages you are
using was using an old version of fontconfig.

One of the reports was
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/52700/fontconfig-error-in-snap-version-of-emacs

which was also on ubuntu 20.04 and apparently caused by snap using
old versions - see
https://github.com/alexmurray/emacs-snap/issues/10

That says (near the end) that the emacs snap was changed to use
core20 (ubuntu) as its base, and that fixed it.  so I guess you need
to identify which snaps are involved (starting with zoom client) and
update them in case already fixed, or else raise an issue on the
specific snap.

Dear TeX friends,



I recently changed from miktex to texlive, because the new miktex
distribution (TeX Collection 2019) is much too slow -- even four times
slower than the recent version.



As I prefer working with batch files texlive works fine with me. Great
distribution!



But I have one may be extraordinary proposal: Please change the German
language file: the imperative form of 'Abbrechen' - 'Abort' should NOT read:
'Breche ab'.

It MUST read 'Brich ab'. 'Sprechen' is an irregular verb.



Thank you very much .



Best regards

Uli Grabowsky

Hi Ulrich,

> 'Breche ab'.

Ugggg, well I guess it was meant like
	Ich breche ab
which is anyway also not a good translation.

I updated it to
	Abbrechen
which is the usual expression used for "Abort".

Thanks for the report

Hi Franek,

just to add to other comments already sent.

This has nothing to do with the TeX Live fonts configuration. From what
is shown there, it looks like a proper fonts.conf file, mine contains
the same data.

So my guess is that the zoom-client snap is just messed up - anyway, the
zoom client snap will have its private fontconfig AFAIR.

> This is only one application but errors are caused by any application which need to be installed or refreshed by snap. If I remove "09-texlive.conf" and re-cache all fonts:

> sudo fc-cache -rv

This is strange, because the above errors don't point to anything
related to TeX Live.

I don't have any experience with snap, but I guess it detects that the
outside world (snap is somehow a sandbox) has a changed fontconfig
configuration, and tries to mimic that - but the snap fontconfig library
is too old to read the config files of the host system.

But this is all only crystal ball reading.

So, to sum it up:
* nothing in the error messages you send has a relation to TeX Live
* I guess that any other change in /etc/fonts/conf.d/ would trigger
  something similar
* the bug is at best in Snap, and not in TeX Live.

Best

Something like perl-modules or so? Those are rather default and
**should** be installed.

Hello,

I cannot remember by heart if any additional Perl module is required, but 
for now just run

$ sudo dnf install perl-File-Copy

and try running the installer again.

Hi all,

The following latex file

gives eight warning messages of the form

LaTeX Warning: Font shape declaration has incorrect series value `mc'.
               It should not contain an `m'! Please correct it.
               Found on input line 226.

This is from tex live pulled from the main repository less than 24 hours ago.

That latter originates from a commit to GNU config last July:
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/config.git/commit/?id=3c20dd431e06337a8b49d8bf791a6a19523a34a4
to harmonise GNU triplets with GCC development. This went into TL via
the Build/source/build-aux/config.guess auto-update as of -r55840.

We have to dissent with either OS vendors or compiler developers about
how to name TL platforms.... on all OSes.... to either confuse some
people, or all people (including ourselves).

Microsoft also promotes "x64" for 64-bit x86, and TL opted to not
follow that questionable PR decision either.





AFAICS, what currently makes the naming discussion less urgent for
Mac OS is that rosetta and universal binaries will (or already do) cover
most use cases.
This means that x86_64-darwin will be deprecated in favour of pulling
MacTeX universal binaries?
(Reminder to aggressively advertise this to Mac OS end users, and to
keep records it in the ?Platforms? section of the upcoming TL2021
release notes).

Johannes,

Interesting message. You wrote "what currently makes the naming discussion less urgent for
Mac OS is that rosetta and universal binaries will (or already do) cover most use cases. This means that x86_64-darwin will be deprecated in favour of pulling MacTeX universal binaries?"

Yes. I ran into this making a very preliminary version of MacTeX-2021. In my build system for that package, the phrase "aarch64-apple-darwin20.2.0" appears in only one line of one script and promptly vanishes as arm and intel binaries are combined to form universal-darwin. 

The only people likely to run into the phrase are users who insist on compiling their own binaries from source. I conjecture that in the end they will create a symbolic link to those binaries. Maybe you and I and Mojca are the only folks who will ever notice.

This is strange, and not reproducible on my system.

It seems you have stray texdoc files in you ~/texmf or some other input

texdoc in TeX Live works nicely, nothing broken here.

Hi Norbert, hi all,

Roland, the original reporter in this thread, replied me (perhaps he
forgot to CC the lists) that he found a typo in his zsh configuration,
and by fixing it everything works fine.

So, now the issue is now resolved. Thanks for your helps.

Subject: lualatex minted and hyphenation
Message-ID: <20210116131136.GA15580@robertalessi.net>

Hello,

I just noticed that the following fails to compile with lualatex only:

--------------------snip--------------------
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{minted}

\begin{document}
\begin{minted}{latex}
   a-'
\end{minted}
\end{document}
--------------------snip--------------------

lualatex-dev has the same problem.

This issue must be caused by a recent update, otherwise I think I
would have noticed it earlier.

Thanks,

Robert

Well you noticed it earlier ;-)  You reported this begin of november
on the luatex list and Marcel passed it on to the luatex-dev list. 

It seems to have been resolved, with the experimental version (I
tried with development id 7397) your example compiles fine.

Thank you Ulrike!  Yes, I found my email of Nov. 7, that was
thoughtless of me.  I now remember that I included the fix in my own
texmf tree. Later, I removed it, probably thinking that it had found
its way into texlive...

Sorry about the noise, everything works again now.

Subject: TeX Live package updates targeting next stable Debian (bullseye)
Message-ID: <YATfm8YWWxFV299u@burischnitzel.preining.info>

Dear all,

the next stable release of Debian, called Bullseye, will go into freeze
beginning of February.

If you have some important updates that you want us (= Debian TeX Team)
to get into TeX Live/Debian, please make sure that you upload them to
CTAN as soon as possible.

Debian's last checkout happened on 2021-01-13, and we **might** make
another one around 2021-01-31 if there are requests and pending
important changes.

The files that go into this checkout will be in Debian/stable for about
2 years, without much chance of an update. So please think carefully
what you upload.

Thanks for your consideration, and please don't hesitate to contact us

Norbert
for the Debian TeX team

Subject: Downdating TeX Live
Message-ID: <8a12ca8c-2592-810d-e053-5a9d81f3c9eb@Hellenic-Institute.Uk>

Tim Eyre, Shunsaku Hirata, Akira Kakuto and I are together trying to 
find out why Tim's copy of "xdvipdfmx" (xdvipdfmx Version 20201111), run 
under Windows 10, occasionally (but very unreliably) crashes? as follows :

> Error -1073741819 (driver return code) generating output
> In Windows, -1073741819 = 0xC0000005 = Access Violation

On my Windows 7 64-bit (Enterprise) system, I could not reproduce the 
problem after 50 000 iterations using "xdvipdfmx" version 20200526.

In order to try Tim's later version, I did one of my occasional "tlmgr 
update --self --all --verify-repo=none"s, but that is still taking place 
and, at the moment at least, "xdvipdfmx" is locked.? I /can/ access 
"dvipdfmx", and that reports "This is dvipdfmx Version 20210109 by the 
DVIPDFMx project team".? So, two questions :

 1. If "dvipdfmx" reports "This is dvipdfmx Version 20210109 by the
    DVIPDFMx project team", will "xdvipdfmx" similarly report "This is
    xdvipdfmx Version 20210109 by the DVIPDFMx project team" ?
 2. If so, how can I downdate my TeX Live installation to give me
    "xdvipdfmx Version 20201111" ?

You do have backups, right, the ones made by tlmgr? So
	tlmgr restore
should help.

If not, try the tlnet archive which I host on my server, texlive.info.

Yes, I have backups, Norbert, but does TLMGR not keep only the most 
recent ?? Because before today's update I was running a version of 
"xdvipdfmx" /older/ than Tim's, so if I do a "tlmgr restore" will that 
not simply restore the /status ante bellum/ ?? It does not seem possible 
to me that it could restore a version of the program that I never installed.

Looking at "texlive.info", it would seem that the file that I require is :

  * https://texlive.info/tlnet-archive/2020/11/11/tlnet/archive/dvipdfmx.win32.r56903.tar.xz

and downloading and extracting it, then trying ".\dvipdfmx --v" does 
indeed report

  * This is dvipdfmx Version 20201111 by the DVIPDFMx project team

so how do I go about asking TLMGR to install ?from? that .tar.xz file ?

Hi Philip,

> Yes, I have backups, Norbert, but does TLMGR not keep only the most recent?

Depends on your setting
	$ tlmgr option autobackup
	Number of backups to keep (autobackup): 1
You can increase this to whatever number you want, including 0 for no
backups and -1 for keeping everything ...

> Looking at "texlive.info", it would seem that the file that I require is :
> 
>  * https://texlive.info/tlnet-archive/2020/11/11/tlnet/archive/dvipdfmx.win32.r56903.tar.xz

Then do
	tlmgr --repo https://texlive.info/tlnet-archive/2020/11/11/tlnet/ install --reinstall dvipdfmx
That should help I guess. On Unix the versions seem to be different, at
least this is what I see.

> so how do I go about asking TLMGR to install ?from? that .tar.xz file ?

It's all in the documentation ...

I /assume/ that http://tug.org/texlive/windows.html is correct ("Run as

Ah.? I had thought that it would launch a GUI which would allow me to 
select from a set of pre-defined actions ...? The real problem is that 
the diagnostic? does not appear if one launches TLMGR from a Windows 
Explorer file listing, as I did.? It was only when I edited the first 
line to read "Echo on" that I was able to read and report the diagnostic.

The following small modifications to the prelude and postlude of "tlmgr.bat" would allow it to issue an appropriate diagnostic which would remain visible until dismissed by the user even if the file were launched from Windows Explorer ?
