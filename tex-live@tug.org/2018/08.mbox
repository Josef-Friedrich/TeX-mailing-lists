Subject: [tex-live] wget problem
Message-ID: <1vk5x110swgab$.dlg@nililand.de>

Since two days when running tlmgr install --list or --all I get
errors:

wget system error "libintl3.dll" not found
wget system error "libssl32.dll" not found 

and then in the cmd windows I see

Can't spawn "cmd.exe": No such file or directory at
C:/texlive/2018/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 2463.

When I continued updates are installed without problem. 
I have the problem only on one of my installations (in win10) the
other works fine. 

Has some one a suggestion what I should do to repair wget or tlmgr?

Hi Ulrike,

> wget system error "libintl3.dll" not found
> wget system error "libssl32.dll" not found 

Did you install tlcritical updates?

It will prefer system wide available wget and test it.
Means, if you have wget in your path and it is broken, these error
messages will appear (but actually shouldn't ... need to check).

Can you run
	tlmgr update -v --list
and see at the top of the output. Here on Linux I get:
	D:tlmgr:main: ::tldownload_server defined: TeXLive::TLDownload=HASH(0x556bb3d025f8)
	D:setup_programs: preferring system versions
	D:program curl found in the path
	D:program wget found in the path
	D:program lz4 found in the path
	D:program gzip found in the path
	D:program xz found in the path
	DD:dumping $::progs = {
	  'compressor' => 'lz4',
	  'curl' => 'curl',
	  'gzip' => 'gzip',
	  'lz4' => 'lz4',
	  'tar' => 'tar',
	  'wget' => 'wget',
	  'working_compressors' => [
	    'lz4',
	    'gzip',
	    'xz'
	  ],
	  'working_downloaders' => [
	    'curl',
	    'wget'
	  ],
	  'xz' => 'xz'
	};
which indicates that *all* programs are taken from the path.

Thanks

Norbert

Yes, thanks I had a broken wget in the path (no idea why it broke
just now). 

After I copied the wget from the other PC it works again.

But while looking at the tlmgr update -v --list output:
Why doesn't it use curl on my system? I have curl in the path (from
windows), but tlmgr says:

D:(w32) trying to set up curl, default
D:/texlive/2018/tlpkg/installer/curl/curl.exe, arg --version
D:Default program D:/texlive/2018/tlpkg/installer/curl/curl.exe not
readable?

and then it doesn't seems to look further.

?A directory k:/texlive/2018/tlpkg/instller/curl does not exist. What
did I miss?

Siep explained it to me once, it has something to do with 32 and 64
versions, and starting perl switch windows into some 32bit shell that
hides the stuff in the 64bit dir.

Here explanation was that:

Not that I understand anything of that ...

Nothing. If there is no curl then it is not used. That is all.
Nothing to worry. We don't ship curl at all, just use it if it is there.
This is primarily for Mac users.

It complains about kpsewhich, but when I run it from the terminal (i.e., without that ?PATH sanitization?), it seems to give a reasonable enough answer:

$ kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT
/usr/local/texlive/2018

The log file contained clear indications - it seems that 
	kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT
did not return anything useful. In this case the updated cannot work.

But since it works on the command line:

> $ kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT
> /usr/local/texlive/2018

I guess that - because TLU is cleaning the PATH before starting, your TL
is not found ...

Please ask on the Mactex mailing list or TLU issue tracker.

Thanks

In Terminal, what is the output of 

which kpsewhich

and

$(defaults read com.googlecode.mactlmgr.tlu TLMTexBinPathPreferenceKey)/kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT

TLU runs kpsewhich during the launch process, and it would log an error if that failed. I'm not sure why it's failing in update-tlmgr-latest.sh, unless you have another kpsewhich.

In Terminal, what is the output of

which kpsewhich

It looks like I had two of those. One that I need and use, and the other one that was forced...

$ which kpsewhich
/Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich
$ type -all kpsewhich
kpsewhich is /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich
$ ll /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich /opt/local/bin/kpsewhich
-rwxr-xr-x  1 uri   wheel  89036 May  9 18:06 /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich*
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin     45 Jun 19 07:10 /opt/local/bin/kpsewhich@ -> /opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/kpsewhich
$ ll /opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/kpsewhich
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  20692 Jul 23 17:59 /opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/kpsewhich*
$ /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich --var-value SELFAUTOPARENT
/usr/local/texlive/2018
$ /opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/kpsewhich --var-value SELFAUTOPARENT
/opt/local/libexec
$

and

$(defaults read com.googlecode.mactlmgr.tlu TLMTexBinPathPreferenceKey)/kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT

It appears to give the correct answer:

$ $(defaults read com.googlecode.mactlmgr.tlu TLMTexBinPathPreferenceKey)/kpsewhich --var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT
/usr/local/texlive/2018
$


TLU runs kpsewhich during the launch process, and it would log an error if that failed. I'm not sure why it's failing in update-tlmgr-latest.sh, unless you have another kpsewhich.

Yes. Some application packages required Macports-installed "texlive-bin?.

$ port provides /opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/kpsewhich
/opt/local/libexec/texlive/binaries/kpsewhich is provided by: texlive-bin
$

Since some packages (like OpenSC) come with documentation in XML, they may require ?dblatex? to convert it to something useful - and ?dblatex? requires ?texlive-bin?? But for now I?ve deleted the whole bunch, as my TeX needs are served by MacTeX.pkg anyway.

Thanks!

Hi,

I've been running MacTeX in parallel to MacPorts for years without any
issues, just making sure that MacTeX's path came in front of MacPorts.
What probably broke it for you is that you must have selected TeX from
MacPorts to be your main distribution (probably in TLU as the old
preference pane is probably dead by now?) and then tried to update it
(TeX provided by MacPorts) via TLU. This has no chance to work. (This
can be seen from the fact that /Library/TeX/texbin pointed to
MacPorts.) You also have /opt/local/bin in front of the bin folder for
MacTeX. Putting MacTeX's path in front would certainly help.

This was the problem; it had nothing to do with the prefpane.
The next release of TeX Live Utility will prepend the TL path
to whatever is in /etc/paths instead of appending it. Hopefully
nothing else breaks from that change.

I'm sorry. I must have misinterpreted the following (I didn't notice
two arguments in the command):

$ ll /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich /opt/local/bin/kpsewhich
-rwxr-xr-x  1 uri   wheel  89036 May  9 18:06 /Library/TeX/texbin/kpsewhich*

My PATH was set so that MacTeX (/Library/TeX/bin) was ahead of /opt/local/bin, precisely for that reason (and that's why running tlmgr from the Terminal worked).

Completely removing /opt/local/bin seems impractical, as that's where the current Perl, Python, and GnuPG live (and for GnuPG the only alternative location is /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin).

Path sanitization killed the MacTeX location, leaving available only Macports kpsewhich.

I suspect there can be issues with curl as well, because the version included with MacOS is less than perfect.

I think that allowing the user to specify which executables to use (instead of basing these decisions on directory path alone) would be better. Example: working kpsewhich is in /Library/TeX/bin, working wget, curl and gpg - in /opt/local/bin...

No, your /etc/paths customization killed TeX Live, and your complaining is pushing me close to ignoring /etc/paths in future.

I also thought that when I first released TeX Live Utility a decade ago. Unfortunately, it was impractical. Broken Python installs alone have taken days of tedious email exchanges like this to debug, so now it's mostly childproofed against clever or absentminded users.

I understand the problem you're describing. But the one I described is also real.

Hi Helmut,

You reported (19 July) that running
eplain ngerman.sty
yields:
    ! Undefined control sequence.
    \declare at robustcommand ...\csname \bbl at stripslash

I believe it's an oversight in babel's bplain, and reported it at
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/59.

As DavidC said (20 July, but you may not have seen it), a workaround is
to make \DeclareTextSymbol undefined when reading ngerman.sty. Then
ngerman takes a completely different branch that doesn't involve the
latex cmds:

\let\zzz\DeclareTextSymbol
\let\DeclareTextSymbol\undefined
\input ngerman.sty
\let\DeclareTextSymbol\zzz

Regards,
Karl

surprised to only get the readme, instead of the documentation. I then
took a look at the texmf and was again surprised to see the following note:

> The following files have been removed in the TeX Live installation of
> the current package, typically due to duplication, lack of space, or
> missing source code.  You can find these files on CTAN at
> 	http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/ducksay
> If questions or concerns, email tex-live at tug.org.
>
> 	ducksay.pdf

Now I wonder why it was removed. It should be ca. 224kb in size, should
not be a duplicate, and the sources of the file are there, as those
where installed in
`/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/ducksay` as `ducksay.tex`
(which is not needed for the package's functionality).

As the author of the package, I personally don't need the documentation
that badly, but for other people it might be of interest, if they
intended to use `ducksay`.

Kind Regards
Jonathan Spratte

Hi Jonathan - thanks for the note. I can only surmise ducksay.tex was
missing from an initial upload, and I didn't notice when it showed
up. My apologies. I'll put it all back.

By the way, the first line of README.md says the package name is
"cowsay" :). --best, karl.

You are talking about the 2018 release?

How did you invoke TeX Live package Manager?

Another consideration: if you installed with elevated permissions
then you also need to run tlmgr with elevated permissions.

When I compile alegreya-samples.tex in various ways,
pdflatex output is far bigger than the others:

pdflatex:  1050181
latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf: 167851

Apparently this is a relatively new phenomenon. Does anyone

I installed TeXlive 2018 on Windows 8.1 a few months ago (when it just came
out). I updated the installation a few times since that initial install,
without any problems.

Today I wanted to get the latest files and I did the usual:

tlmgr update --self,

followed by

tlmgr update --all

This is what I get (seems similar to a problem reported on StackExchange
two weeks ago for Windows 10).

[in fact it is the third run of update --all, before it failed for the abnt
and acmart packages, hence the skipping forcibly removed package abnt skipping
forcibly removed package acmart messages]

Thanks

*UPDATE:*

After getting the suggestion top try another mirror I trieds to re-install
the package acmart (which was forcibly removed by tlmgr update in my second
try) using a Swiss repository. I still get a similar error message.

Is something corrupted on my local installation, and, if yes, how can

For example, fira-samples.tex

pdflatex:  1279931
latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf: 162332
latex -> dvipdfmx: 113158
xelatex: 125512

I can't see any reason why the recent alegreya update could
affect the size of the pdflatex output unless pdflatex isn't
subsetting the embedded type 1 fonts and these have become
much larger.

Unfortunately, I don't have much in the way of "old"
alegreya packages. A package I have from 2013 doesn't
support the Sans family yet the pdflatex output is twice the
size of that of any other processor.

To be fair, pdflatex has always produced outputs that are much bigger
than what xelatex and lualatex do. This issue here was raised because
I noticed that pdflatex in texlive 2018 with an updated Alegreya
package produces a pdf output about twice the size of what pdlatex in
texlive 2017 did with the Alegreya package that existed then. My
suspicion is that this difference is caused by the updated Alegreya
package, but Bob (the maintainer of Alegreya) thinks differently.

pdftex simply creates subsets of Type 1 fonts while all other
programs convert them to either Type 1C (aka Compact Font Format)
or to CID Type 0C.

The problem is that Type 1 fonts are encrypted and it's impossible to
compress random numbers efficiently.

You can also try

  pdflatex alegreya-samples.tex
  ps2pdf alegreya-samples.pdf alegreya-samples-gs.pdf

  Reinhard

It converts Type 1 to CFF.  CFF is more compact and not encrypted.
The specs can be downloaded from Adobe.

I just downloaded Peter Szab?'s pdfsizeopt (Python) script.

  https://github.com/pts/pdfsizeopt

With

  pdflatex alegreya-samples.tex
  pdfsizeopt --do-require-image-optimizers=no \
  	     alegreya-samples.pdf alegreya-samples-pts.pdf

I get

  -rw-r--r-- 1 reinhard users 149950 Aug 21 00:14 alegreya-samples-gs.pdf

Thanks Reinhard. pdfsizeopt reduces the size of Sverre's
file to 47702. He had been concerned that pdflatex alone
produced 291773 bytes, whereas an older version of the
alegreya package produced 162932, presumably because the
pfbs were smaller.

Is there some reason why the effect of ps2pdf (converting
embedded fonts to CFF) hasn't been incorporated into
pdf[la]tex?

Yes.  A few years ago Th?nh decided not to add new features any more
and only fix bugs.  His aim is to make pdftex stable.  luatex is its
successor and new features can be added there.

Dear all,

the "schule" package has been removed from TL due to a new structure 
resulting in many redundant(?) files. As I got some requests from users, 
I wonder, whether the authors have been contacted to fix their package 
in order to get it back into TL as soon as possible. If not, what could 
I tell them?

Thank you.

Johannes Pieper asked me, and I suggested  to reorganize things.
Something like this:

README
schule.dtx
schule.ins
schule.pdf
doc/
source/


This was on Monday. So, they know what could be done.

They'll need to give their files unique names: loads of "code.tex" will 
be an issue.

Indeed.  Thank you, Joseph.  

Perhaps, when checking uploaded packages I should add  two more
checks:

- depth of directory tree (although I had seen this)
- duplicate file names over different directories. Not sure if only
  checking for *.tex, *.ins, *.dtx or just for everything.

Then I could authors give a warning that things are possibly bad or at
least not optimal.

I saw that on the CTAN list. However, I am not sure, whether they wait 
for some "official" TL team reaction.

Thank you.

Subject: [tex-live] Recovery of the package schule
Message-ID: <20180822100330.18c9421c@joh>

Hello, everybody,

I would like to know what I have to do as a developer to get the package schule back on texlive as soon as possible. In Germany, the summer holidays end at school and some teachers now miss the working basis. In my opinion, the missing answer to the question about the tikz files given in the commit had already been answered before the commit via the CTAN mailing list.

Kind regards

Johannes

Message-ID: <6c611e19-c9a9-43bf-85c1-7b3bd43a725b@bath.ac.uk>

Back in April I submitted two new packages to CTAN, bath-bst and 
biblatex-bath, being the variant of the Harvard referencing style 
recommended by the University of Bath Library, implemented for BibTeX 
and Biblatex respectively.

I'm happy to see that bath-bst has been packaged into TeX Live, but 
biblatex-bath is still missing:
https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-bath

Is there something else you need me to do before packaging it? Apologies 
if I missed a message somewhere.

Best wishes,
Alex.

That sounds very strange.

Anyone with Windows experience can help here?

I cannot reproduce this with this server. I get correct verification.

Can you repeat with 
	tlmgr update --list -v
and send the output.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CANQ7O3H3QCH5G4a-BPNTecQDwC6tSuZZ6YnJa2k0h=oN5tJYYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

We recently upgraded from texlive-2012 to 2018. We saw a major decrease in
performance running many tex jobs (2 seconds up to 29 seconds in some cases)

It turned out (see this stack overflow)
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/446372/compiling-pdftex-2-2-seconds-with-2012-vs-29-seconds-with-2018-version
to be the case insensitive searching default that kpathsea has. One we
disabled that, the times went back to what we were used to.

I'm not sure if this counts as a "bug report" per se, as you do talk about
disabling that in the documentation, but, it did take a while to work it
out. If it wasn't for the helpful people on StackOverflow I may never have
thought to disable that option. I didn't think that the case insensitive
searching could be _that_ much slower.

Anyway, thought I'd let you know,
Best,
Patrick

I tried with the very same mirror without any problem.

What happened is that the downloaded texlive.tlpdb.xz

Similar things than happen with packages.

Could you please check whether this is still the case? 

I tried some packages from there and all worked out without any problem
today.

Norbert, hello.

I think something must be wrong on my system, since I always get the same
message about the compressed data being corrupted.
This time I chose to update one package (ptex-base) rather than all to have
a shorter log.

In the log I find the line:

[1/1, ??:??/??:??] update: ptex-base [1969k] (45140 -> 48432) ... xz:
(stdin): Compressed data is corrupt

which is also present in all my previous tries, although, just before the
log shows:

D:TLUtils::check_file: checksums for
C:\Users\goossens\AppData\Local\Temp\xB_hXx69oW\0HNCIOJmVb/ptex-base.tar.xz
agree

Below follows the complete log.

Thanks for your help. Regards, Michel

does the dos prompt (or whatever it is called this week) in your Windows actually work?

I've seen this error a few times where a student had overwritten (aka deleted the default instead of adding to it) the PATH setting in Windows. Then nothing on the windows command line worked.

This is much less likely on Win10 as they've changed the interface.

That sounds very strange.

Anyone with Windows experience can help here?

Yes, that is fine. lwp is the first download method and the best one.

Before I ask anything else, I wonder ... so the actual filenames of some
of the images (like, hundreds or thousands?) are "something.fmt"?

Can you easily run a test using "something.else" instead?

.fmt in our world means the precompiled TeX format files (latex.fmt,
etc.). I'm wondering if the definitions relating to searching for our
.fmt files is interacting with searching for random input files named
foo.fmt.  --thanks, karl.

Ok, can you type on the cmd line
	xz --version
and send me the output?

> D:program xz found in the path

You have xz in your Windows environment somewhere, but it seems that it
is outdated or some different program.

Please send above output.

Hi Karl,

It?s not just the .fmt . For example, one of the tests I did was just with
a document containing (100) broken image links.. e.g

\centertext{\figure{FILENAME.broken.PNG}}}

With

texmf_casefold_search = 0

it takes 0.2 seconds, without it takes 8s

There is no filename in my tex source containing fmt, however, I do pass in
a .fmt file when I call pdftex, not sure if that makes a difference.
?

Please try by temporarily renaming as
ren xz.exe xz.exe.old

In this case, TeX Live will use its own xz.exe.

Akira, hello.

Indeed, I had a xz.exe in the directory
c:\Users\goossens\bin\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin (version 5.0.3)

When renaming it , texlive uses the one in
C:\texlive\2018\tlpkg\installer\xz\xz.exe (version 5.2.3)
and eveything seems all right.

It is interesting to note that eveything worked until a few weeks ago. Has
the version in texlive changed in the meantime
introducing an incompatible change in the generated binaries?

Many thanks to all for your help.

Regards, Michel

Subject: [tex-live] Errors produced by TeX Live 2018 on Win7 Pro 64 towards
 end of installation
Message-ID: <CACvoXgENdHCwAnGiKmhP6zfwfH6ZsM+6MTdSayd0OJNt9XpFpw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I recently attempted to install TeX Live 2018 on my Windows 7 Professional
(64-bit) machine and I ran the install-tl-advanced.bat as an administrator
from the Windows GUI with all default options. The installation went fine
except towards the end I when received some errors:

Apart from this error, TeX Live 2018 seems to have installed fine. I am not
sure exactly what package failed and why and wonder if there is anything
for me to worry about. I haven't started using TeX Live yet.

Please advise.

Hi Patrick,

    \centertext{\figure{FILENAME.broken.PNG}}}

If the reference is broken, yes, it will take time to search the disk
for casefolded matches (and fail). There is no way around that. That is
the point of the feature.

But in your real document, presumably there are no broken references.
Does casefolding or not still make a difference? I would expect not.
When references resolve (with no casefolding necessary), it should not
matter whether it is on or not.

    There is no filename in my tex source containing fmt, however, I do
    pass in a .fmt file when I call pdftex, not sure if that makes a
    difference.

You mean a regular .fmt file, as in pdftex \&myfmt foo.tex?
Sure, that is totally fine and has no effect on the issue. --best, karl.

Right fair enough :) It?s just that it was 0.2 secs vs 7.8 seconds (which
is a decent difference). I get that casefolded matches are going to take
more time, and it?s totally fine that it?s the default now, it just took me
us by surprise and took a while to work out what the fix was.

It absolutely makes a difference, sorry for not being clear. Creating a
sample doc takes 16.8 seconds case insensitive vs 1.5s case sensitive. In
that doc there are no .fmt extensions (we do use .FIG and .AUX, I?m not
sure if those are our custom includes or not).

What might be interesting (and it makes sense), we have 3 directories that
we pass to tex to search through i.e. texinputs=dir1;dir2;dir3. In our case
most of the files were actually in dir3 in the 16.8 second doc above. So, I
moved the include order around so that dir3 was first, and the time (with
case insensitive searching) fell to 3 seconds. Now, in our use case, we
have many thousands of files in these directories, so, perhaps we?re an
unusual case.

I?m not sure if there?s anything ?broken? per se, but, it?s definitely a
large drop in performance.

Best,
Patrick

Not the binaries, but the selection which xz is used has changed.
We decided to usually prefer the system provided version because it is
generally safer due to library incompatibilities.

I didn't know that the xz format has changed, I will add checks for the
version numbers of xz to make sure we use a recent enough xz.

Seems to be fine and nothing to worry. I will look into it and why it
didn't work in your case.

    we do use .FIG and .AUX, I????m not
    sure if those are our custom includes or not

Those should be fine (.aux/.AUX is already a TEXINPUTS extension). It's
only using some predefined extension for another file type that could
cause trouble. Seems that is not at issue.

    What might be interesting (and it makes sense), we have 3 directories that
    we pass to tex to search through i.e. texinputs=dir1;dir2;dir3. In our case

Ah. I think that explains it. In 2017, kpse just looked for dir1/FOO.FIG
(and failed), dir2/FOO.FIG (and failed), and then succeeded with
dir3/FOO.FIG. Now, it fails for dir1/FOO.FIG and then readdir()s through
dir1 looking for "foo.fig" (strcasecmp-wise).

I considered keeping the old behavior, but a couple things mitigated
against it:
1) the current behavior is how it's always worked on Windows (because
   Windows operates case-insensitively);
2) it seems at least as sensible to prefer an imperfect match in an
   earlier directory as the converse.
(https://www.tug.org/texinfohtml/kpathsea.html#Casefolding-examples)

I admit there was also:
3) it was easier to fit the new feature into the existing code that way.

    have many thousands of files in these directories, 

It will take time to read such huge directories, yes. So although the
outcome here is unfortunate, I'm not sure there is anything to do to
improve it :(.

I'm not sure if it's feasible, but it occurs to me that you might be
able to speed things up (to a constant) by creating/maintaining an ls-R
file for the "tree" containing these huge directories.

It's also true that when I wrote the new bit of code, I assumed that
disk caching would pretty much take care of repeated searches (as it did
on all the systems I could check). With such huge directories, it's
certainly possible that the disk caching gets overloaded. The filesystem
type, available ram, etc., etc., are all going to be factors.

Best,
Karl

P.S.? What is the reason for the installer change whereby the root directory has to be specified as three separate parts (Drive letter, root, year) ?? This whole interface is very clunky in Windows (and has been for as long as I can remember, ignoring (e.g.,) select-all followed by overtype ? nothing gets erased), requiring <return> rather than {OK] and so on), and is now three times worse since I have to interact with three clunky dialogue boxes rather than one.

you are soo late to install 2018, I am surprised! But maybe that was the
period of peace we had ;-)

Not to expected, and nothing I have seen or has been reported till now.
Maybe your disk is full?

That was a decision taken by Siep in accordance with UI studies she
took. I cannot comment on that.

I like things to become stable before I risk upgrading :-)? (but they

Well, 3.27Tb free space isn't massive by today's standards, but it 
should suffice, and the scratch drive that the installer used has 268Gb 
free ...

OK, perhaps if Siep is reading this thread she will be willing to 
comment.? Now, the bad news :? the installation failed ?

So, having restarted the installation (successfully, by eschewing the

installing from http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk rather than from the

How exactly are you installing from the local copy?


Here is what I do


Inside the rsynced copy of the tlnet structure


I run the copy of the installer found there.


The installation material is automatically detected as being in a relative folder (relative to the location of install-tl-advanced.bat) and it automatically uses the local one.


Have you instead unzipped the rsynced copy of


install-tl.zip


and is running the installer from the generated folder? Because that will never pick up the local installation folder.


Go back to the root of the rsynced copy of tlnet, and run the copy of the installer that is right there. It should be the same as in the zip file anyway.

This design allows a directory browser.

This matters especially for people with localized versions of
windows. For example, in explorer, the `Users' directory may be
represented as 'Gebruikers', and users may not be aware that that is
not the actual name. The browser alway returns the actual name.

No, I haven't unzipped that file at all.? I am now re-installing using 
"Install-TL-Advanced.bat", and all seems to be proceeding smoothly; I 
suspect that on the previous occasion I may, in an attempt to avoid the 
need to specify the root directory as three separate components, I ran 
the installer executable directly rather than via the CMD file (I didn't 
success in my attempt, but that is nonetheless probably what happened).

That is what the Change... button under the C:\ component does.

Ah, I see.? I am so used to ignoring the GUI aspects of those dialogue 
boxes that I failed even to register that I was being presented with 
one.? But in that case, could you not allow the "New folder" option, and 
one could then create-and-browse-to C:\texlive\2018 (or in my case, 
D:\TeX\Live\2018) from a single dialogue box ?

I am stuck with the dialogs that perl/tk offers. I am a bit
disappointed myself that this option was not available. But I think
the current design accomodates most people, and it is always
possible to create D:\TeX outside the TL installer.

Fair enough, Siep, fully understood.? In my case D:\TeX (\Live) already 
exists, since it hosts D:\TeX\Live\2008..2017 (and now 2018 as well).

On Unix I invoke the installer with the -repository option.

>From the install-tl help message:

  -repository url|path
      Specify the package repository to be used as the source of the
      installation. In short, this can be a directory name or a url using
      http(s), ftp, or scp. The documentation for "tlmgr" has the details
      (<http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#OPTIONS>).

      For installation, the default is to pick a mirror automatically, using
      <http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet>; the chosen mirror is
      used for the entire download. You can use the special argument "ctan"
      as an abbreviation for this. (See <http://ctan.org> for more about
      CTAN and its mirrors.)

      After installation is complete, you can use that installation as the
      repository for another installation. If you chose to install less than
      the full scheme containing all packages, the list of available schemes
      will be adjusted accordingly.

I can't try the Windows GUI installers here and thus don't know
whether you can avoid the command line.

If you have installed TL already, you can do

  tlmgr option repository ...

in order to switch to your local repository.

You have to set the repository option every year because the URL or
path is stored in

  texlive/<year>/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb 
          ^^^^^^

I'm sure that you did something like this in previous years too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Bob,

    I'm trying to compile lcdf-typetools on a TeXLive system.
    The configure script can't find the kpathsea library and/or
    header files. Neither can I. 

Sorry, I don't really understand. If you have the TL sources checked out
(tug.org/texlive/svn), lcdf-typetools and kpathsea are both under
source/texk.

If you downloaded lcdf-typetools from, e.g., Eddie's site and are trying
to compile it separately from the rest of TL, then whether kpathsea is
found will depend on whether your system provides it (as in,
/usr/lib/libkpathsea*).

No libkpathsea* files are installed as part of native TL; only distros
do that.

FWIW, as far as I know the lcdf-typetools in the TL source tree is the
latest release (2.107).

Hope this helps somehow, though I have a feeling you already knew all
that and are asking something else ... -k

I was hoping there was a way to get the necessary
"development" files for kpathsea without checking out all
of TL. I've since installed texlive-kpathsea-lib rpms on my
Centos system and lcdf-typetools seems satisfied with them
although they apparently date back to 2015.

I'm compiling lcdf-typetools because I ran into a bug in
otftotfm. Eddie was kind enough to post a patch to his
github site and I felt I should test it. I don't know when
he plans a new release.

It's theoretically possible but practically painful to finagle this.
There is no simple recipe.

discusses it, the paragraph towards the bottom starting
"Finally, the above retrieves ...".

    I've since installed texlive-kpathsea-lib rpms on my

Good. Not much has changed since 2015 (or a lot earlier than that :).

Message-ID: <20180830195438.h4cazt2zumiz2iqb@math.berkeley.edu>

First, a lot of thanks for TeXLive!  Now the compaints:

A) In the (fully) installed TeXLive tree, I could not locate any
   information about reporting bugs (upstream, or with TeXLive).

B) Googling lead to https://www.tug.org/texlive/bugs.html
   However, this page says:
       report it to the package maintainer
   but there is no mention of how to locate the package maintainer.

C) Looking through the installed tree, I can find
     ? latexbug.pdf
     ? A small handfuls of files named *.BUG
   I suspect that they may contain the required info (at least
   latexbug and texmf-dist/doc/fonts\dejavu/BUGS do).

D) I see that CTAN contains a field ?Maintainer?.  To test whether it
   is managed by TeXLive, I grepped through ./tlpkg/**???but I could
   not find any mention of Farar (who is ?Maintainer? for dejavu).

   For best results, this info should be easily available locally in
   the TeXLive directory (possibly, also via tlmgr?).

E) Being the largest (or one of the largest) aggregators, I believe
   that TeXLive has enough weight to force an better infrastructure
   for streamlined bug reporting for TeX components!

   (And this has a chance to decrease the load of misdirected you
   definitely receive?) 

Hope this helps,
Ilya

each package that texlive integrates will have its own bug reporting mechanism.

In the case of dejavu that you mention

texdoc dejavu

gives the package documentation, the last line of which says:

Please send me bug reports and suggestions about this package.

with the text being  a link to the author's email.

*This* is the problem I tried to address:  the absence of a unified
access to this info!

It looks like CTAN has it (via ?Maintainer? links), but this info is
not incorporated into TeXLive infrastructure.

Sorry if I was not clear enough!

I do not care (at least now ;-) about this package.  I just used it a
litmus test: ?Farar? is rare enough so that I could grep the whole
directory tree ./tlcfg without getting false positives.

This was just a test to see that the ?Maintainer? field is INDEED lost
when packing for TeXLive.

Thanks,
Ilya

the maintainer field isn't that useful for bug reporting, eg
https://ctan.org/pkg/colortbl?lang=en
will tell you the maintainer is me, but ctan doesn't tell you how to contact me.

The ctan catalogue format has (relatively recently) fields for bug
reporting and source code repositories and newer entries have these
listed eg

https://ctan.org/pkg/typewriter

has entries for "support" and "bug tracker" as well as listing me as maintainer.

yes I could in theory ask ctan to update the catalogue for colortbl to
give the bug reporting address on github but I haven't done that (and
neither have author of most existing packages) so  ctan do not have
that kind of information for most packages.

but if the bug reporting address might be a github issues link, or an
email address or a postal address or no address at all as the code is
just published as is with no support, it's hard to know how texlive
could give a unified interface  to it?

Well, CTAN just distributes what authors upload. It's not an easy task to
unify all information. TeX Live distributes what is available from CTAN.
And there is a unified interface for documentation:

texdoc <packagename>

If there is an information on bug reporting, you find it by this unified
command.

yes, exactly, that's what I tried to say in my first reply, but Ilya
pushed back on that, but I'm not sure what unified interface could be
offered for a collection of packages with such varied maintenance
models.

With (at least) tl2016 and tl2018 the compiled psnup is ignoring the
arguments (at least -H, -W???and probably -h -w as well).

The version is tl2009 is OK.  [Checked on Windows 7.]

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????

The first time I saw this bug was in the end of '90s IIRC (it was an
update in Solaris which broke it???I needed to fall back to the
previous binary version.)  I think that at the time is was widely
known that one should avoid the newer version! 

Do not know how it happened that the broken version squeezed in
between tl2009 and tl2016?

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????

The version of tl2009 reports:

Not surprisingly the answer is, please report to upstream, which is hard

First of all, the info provided above should be clearly stated in the
web page on bug reporting.  (I use TeX from end of ?80s and TeXLive
for a decade, and had only a very vague idea about texdoc.)

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Second: of course, the general infrastructure cannot be done in 1
layer.  But it can be done in 3 layers.

A)  On CTAN: indicate clearly how to mark the communication channels
    on new uploads.

A') Auto-Nag uploaders if this info is not present.

B) (Design the mechanism if needed, and) clearly communicate to the
    authors how to update the info.  (E.g., have a button in a corner
    of Web UI ?If you are the author, you can do this and that??.)

C)  Import these fields from CTAN into the TeXLive packages. 

Thanks,
Ilya

P.S.  There is no problem like this in CPAN, why it is present on CTAN?

I (eventually) would.  But this is a question of unrolling.  Is not
there such a mechanism on TeXLive?

At the top of main() in psnup.c, the global width and height
are set:

   if (!paper_size(NULL, &width, &height))
     die("could not get default paper size");

so width != -1 and height != -1 at the begininng of the program.

Thus width and height are never changed at

   /* set default values of input height & width */
   if ( iwidth > 0 && width == -1 )
     width = iwidth ;
   if ( iheight > 0 && height == -1 )
     height = iheight ;

where iheight and iwidth are set by -H and -W.

So I will change the above as

   /* set default values of input height & width */
   if ( iwidth > 0 )
     width = iwidth ;
   if ( iheight > 0 )
     height = iheight ;

in order that users can change default sizes by -H and -W,
if Reuben admits.
It seems that -H and -W options win -p option.

Best,
Akira

That can be done easily in the future.

Historic reasons. CTAN predates CPAN and has historically very lax
rules. CRAN is even more restrictive, but changing this after so many
years is not an option we want to proceed.

No. Because it would require a automatic system that maps packages to
authors and bug report urls, which as we discussed already is not
available.

Feel free to contribute code and work time to implement it!

Actually, we are happy if authors give us that information so that we
could add it to those fields. Currently we have: home, bugs, support,
repository, announce and development.

I should note that authors could simply drop us a mail to update those
fields.

The TeX Catalogue (an XML package database) maintained by the CTAN
team already contains the e-mail addresses of all uploaders.  But
since someone complained that e-mail addresses can be retrieved by
spammers, this information was removed from the public HTML version of
the Catalogue.

Nowadays it's not possible in many countries to expose personal data
to the public for legal reasons if the author doesn't explicitly
agree.

Thus, if a package author is willing to expose his e-mail address to
the public, he can always do it in the package documentation.

Please also note that many packages are unsupported.  TeX is very old
and many contributers are not available anymore.

You obviously overestimate this issue.  If you don't know whom to
contact, just ask on this mailing list.  But there were only very few
such requests in the past.  In most cases it's even much better to ask
here before bothering the author.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi

> Hmm???  I AM contributing work time!

I meant contributing time to implement these features ...
I don't see code contributed by you to the improvement of CTAN or TeX
Live import.

> > > C)  Import these fields from CTAN into the TeXLive packages. 

I have added code that imports the 
	contact/*
fields from the TeX Catalogue into the TLPDB. Starting with tomorrow the
tlpdb on the server will contain this kind of information where provided
by CTAN/TeX Catalogue.

The addition to tlmgr is also committed, the various catalogue/contact
fields will be shown in 
	tlmgr info <pkg>
in json, text, csv mode.

This addition will be in tlcritical and available with the next push
out.

Enjoy

Norbert
