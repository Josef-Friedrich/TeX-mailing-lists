As far as I can see, the answer to "I'm looking for information about
package abc" is to visit https://ctan.org/pkg/abc (or look at the
source). All TL does is reflect the information gathered at CTAN, and it
does not make sense to try to do anything separate from that.

Norbert already wrote the bit of code to import the CTAN contact info
into the TLPDB, although it might become stale from time to time. If
you're online, it's better just to look at CTAN in the first place.

texdoc is about viewing documentation, not providing package information.
To see such information, tlmgr info 12many.

As Manfred said, hardly any packages provide such information now, so
this all a bunch of infrastructure with hardly any content at the
moment, but maybe that will improve in years to come.

Maybe a volunteer could go through package sources and tell CTAN about
the relevant public information found ... -k

Not that it really matters now, but as Akira's message implied, it's
actually Reuben Thomas who last worked on psutils. -k

Thanks for looking into this.

Since 2014 I've been working on a complete rewrite of psutils in Perl, with
a test suite to ensure that the rewrite does not introduce bugs or, as far
as possible, different behavior, though I've already had to make some
changes where the current code is buggy or the current behavior does not
make sense. I've not done anything for precisely a year, but I'm hoping to
get back to it later this year (this is a realistic hope, as I will go from
having two half-time jobs to only one shortly!).

I think given the circumstances, the change you suggest is therefore a
sensible one. As far as I know, texlive is the only software distribution
shipping up-to-date psutils, so no need for me to make an interim release.

Many thanks. I have applied the patch in r48528.
The binary based on the patch will be distributed in
TeX Live 2019, in the case that the new perl version
is not present.

If you're aware of others, do let me know. I applied all the patches for
the C version that I could find several years ago. The bug Akira just fixed
is already fixed in the current Perl version, I believe.

... this is not a reason to not apply Akira's fix to the C psutils
github repository.  So please do that.

BTW, where is the Perl version of psutils?  In the psutils github
repository I see a single Perl file (PSUtils.pm) ? this can't be it,
right?  If the Perl code is somewhere else, it would be nice to add a
link to the README...

There is no "C psutils github repository". There is just one github repo.
Since the last release, v1.23, I've started migrating the code to Perl.

See the .in files (they are processed by configure into suffixless
scripts). The only C program left there is pstops. So there's nothing to
link to, it's all there!

By the way, I don't have time for this myself, but if someone would like to
make a C branch of the repository for use until the Perl version is
released, I'd be very happy to have it. It looks like the last commit
before I started introducing Perl versions of the code was 5858fb18bb436,
though arguably one might want to go beyond that, as there are more C and
documentation fixes after that.

Alternatively, it might be simpler just to have patches on the v1.23
release.

Message-ID: <96e2e245-39bc-2d87-face-0a8f9fb2876e@abgol.de>

What is the policy concerning global hyphenation exception files?

The \addlanguage command has an argument for exception files but this 
argument
is empty for all languages defined in "language.def".

As far as I can see, TeX Live provides three exception files:
- dehyphtex.tex (for the old patterns for the old German spelling; this file
 ? concerns only pdftex, as xetex and luatex use the newer patterns)
- ushyphex.tex (for American English)
- frhyphex.tex (for French)

None of these files seems to be loaded by default, nor with plain TeX, 
nor with
Babel, nor with Polyglossia.

Does it really make sense to provide global exception files and not to load
them?

yes as once loaded they can't be unloaded, but (unlike \patterns)
\hyphenation exception entries can be added at any point into a normal tex
run so if an end user wants to use \input{ushyphex} they have that option.
If they were preloaded you would need to load them as a new language if you
wanted to offer a choice of using or not using them.

  When there is a default set of hyphenation exceptions, they?re loaded
in the format together with the patterns.  That?s currently the case for
21 languages and variants; see the hyph-*.tex files provided by
hyph-utf8, which when applicable contains both patterns and exceptions.

  You?re looking in the wrong place.  The standard files are under
texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/tex/.  The three files you
found are alternatives that came about for different reasons, which is
why they?re not loaded in the format.  As David explains, they can
always be loaded at runtime if desired.

Hello Reuben,
porting the C files to Perl is obviously a great idea.  Programs
written in C can only be updated once per year in TeX Live but scripts
can be updated at any time.  IMO the higher level of abstraction also
simplifies maintenance.

I personally prefer texlua for scripts supposed to be used within a
TeX environment.  I'm using Perl for more than two decades and Lua for
a couple of years.  The advantage of Perl is that there are modules
for any problem on CPAN.  TeX Live only provides a standard Perl
distribution for Windows but not arbitrary modules available on CPAN.

In my experience texlua is the best choice in the TeX world because
the engine is ubiquitous, Lua is incredibly fast, and the Lua code is
much more comprehensible than anything written in Perl.  This also
means that it takes much less time to learn Lua than to learn Perl.

Anyway, you are the author and thus the one who has to decide.

It's not a good idea to strip the suffix.  The programs written in C
we currently have in TeX Live are installed in bin/<platform> and have
no extension except on Windows (.exe).

Platform independent scripts are installed in TEXMFSCRIPTS.  If you
upload your Perl scripts to CTAN, TeX Live would install them in

  texmf-dist/scripts/psutils

On Unix, TeX Live creates symlinks in bin/<platform>/ to files in
TEXMFSCRIPTS, and thus bin/<platform>/psnup will be a symlink to
texmf-dist/scripts/psutils/psnup.pl .

There are no symlinks on Windows.  In this case scripts are launched
by a wrapper which needs the extension (.pl) in order to determine how
to process a particular script.  The details are explained in the
wrapper script itself:

  http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/win32/runscript.tlu?revision=48059&view=markup

MiKTeX relies on a separately installed Perl engine which definitely
depends on filename suffixes, as usual under Windows.

So the best thing you can do is to provide the .pl suffix.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm not writing for the TeX world, psutils is packaged in Debian, and was
originally written to be highly portable.

Lua is great (you'll see if you search a bit that I'm a long-standing
contributor to the Lua ecosystem, was active on lua-l long ago, and wrote
the now-defunct Lua Technical Note 0), but it's not installed by default on
many systems, and its library support via LuaRocks is still relatively
immature, arguably because of Lua's philosophy of minimalism.

Perl on the other hand is installed pretty much everywhere, and has a great
deal of "batteries included". I tend therefore to rewrite C code into Perl,
as it does not, in practice, reduce by much the ability to install on
"out-of-the-box" systems (because on most systems Perl comes pre-installed,
or there's a standard installer).

My rewrite of psutils uses no non-core libraries at all.

Not having a suffix for programs is standard. (I am coming from a POSIX
background here.) I use GNU autotools, and POSIX/UNIX conventions. In this
case, if you want to add suffixes, since all the programs are in Perl (or
will be in version 2, anyway), configure with --program-suffix=.pl.
Overall, please bear in mind that I'm writing for a wider audience than the
TeX world, and the best compromise I've found that does not involve custom
per-system code is to use POSIX conventions and autotools
(behind-the-scenes support is very good for even Windows nowadays).

At least in this case it seems there's an easy fix to all the problems
you've mentioned, though I'd be interested to know what TeXLive does with
packages that install a mixture of compiled programs and scripts (where the
suggestion I made above would not work). Autotools is sufficiently widely
used that this problem must have been solved before.

I agree with everything Reuben said, the core point being that people
should NOT develop for TeX Live ...:
- lua is not available everywhere, and when portability is required,
  Perl is much better
- stripping the extensions is absolutely correct in the usual procedure.
  It is only TL that reuses links.

It depends ;-) Most probably if it is a "program/package" that needs
compilation, updates will be defered till the next release.

Subject: [tex-live] CTAN packages and generated files
Message-ID: <20180902164626.56d77699@hogwart>

Hi folks,
For packages uploaded to CTAN we have a policy that in a package we
don't like to have files which are generated by .ins or .dtx because we
want to avoid redundancy.

So we check for either   \generate{  \file{...}  ... } or
generateFile{..} to find those files we then would complain about.
Hope this is technically correct.

A notable exception is the case where the mandatory README file (which
actaually may be one of README, README.txt or README.md) is generated
by a .dtx or .ins. 


Now, my question:

It also could happen that an x.dtx contains a generate statement which
mentions x.ins. Perhaps, also the other way around. Dunno.


So, my thinking was if in x.dtx I find something like

\generate
  {
    ...
    \file{x.ins}
    ...
  }

I just ignore that because x.dtx and x.ins are always required to exist
as a pair. Otherwise LaTeX would complain when processing x.ins/x.dtx. 
Actually, this is the way checking takes place currently.


Is this correct?

No. It's possible to make a 'self-contained' .dtx file which has the 
.ins instruction in the .dtx and generates everything in a single "tex 
foo.dtx" run.

Does it mean that in all cases where I find a .ins generate instruction
in a .dtx file I may conclude that the .dtx is a 'self-contained' .dtx
file?

Very good. 

I further assume that the other way round shouldn't happen, i.e. I
have an .ins file where there exists a .dtx file generate instruction.

Fine.

Now the last question (which is perhaps more a theoretical issue).

Assume a package a consists of:

README
a.dtx
a.ins
b.dtx
a.pdf
a.tex

Now assume in a.dtx I find a b.dtx generate instruction. Then b.dtx
were a redundant file in the package. Or perhaps I find b.dtx in a.ins.

Question:

1. I think this could happen. Correct?

2. If 1. is correct then how likely is such a case happening in real
life? Just your personal opinion.

It is possible to generate .dtx files, but that would normally be using 
some scripting not uploaded to CTAN. (Heiko used to do that, for 
example.) In practice, I don't think anyone would upload anything of 
that type.

Ok. So perhaps it is best I'll check things the best way possible.

Subject: [tex-live] repeated xelatex call destroys pdf output
Message-ID: <20180904142608.GA22151@bulldog.preining.info>

Hi all,

here down at Debian we got a bug report which I can easily reproduce
with upstream TeX Live.
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=907784

What happens is that when xelatex *first* compiles the document,
everything is fine.

It also generates a .aux file which somehow disturbes xelatex, because
on the second run when the .aux file is read the output is a completely
broken pdf.

$ pdfinfo newfile1.damaged.pdf 
Syntax Error: Couldn't read xref table
Syntax Warning: PDF file is damaged - attempting to reconstruct xref table...
Syntax Error: Couldn't find trailer dictionary
Syntax Error: Couldn't read xref table
$

I tried uncompressing it with pdftk but that converted the damaged file
into a good and working one.

I am having a hard time understand what might be wrong. It is also not
trivial to reduce this example to a minimal one, thus I refrain from
posting the files here, but only include the links:
TeX files:
	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?att=2;bug=907784;filename=test.tar.bz2;msg=5
Images:
	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?att=2;bug=907784;filename=pic.tar.bz2;msg=10

I can send the .tex, the .aux file, or whatever might be useful to
debug.

It would be great if someone can help tracking down this strange bug.

Thanks

Norbert

Hi all,

the sample file is intended for XeLaTeX but requests the fontenc package to
encode unicode to the T1 encoding, which is wrong, it cannot work. As a
result it probably writes an illegal code into the .aux file and XeLaTeX
then crashes without completing the output to PDF (and the most important
xref tables are close to the end of the PDF file). Just removing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} solves the problem and it works fine on my
computer.

Interestingly it didn't on my fully uptodate TeX Live ... even after
removing the .aux file and starting from scratch ... very puzzling.

the \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} line is certainly wrong for xetex but on
my updated (cygwin) texlive 2018 pdfinfo doesn't give any errors on
the generated file with or without this line.

what happens if you use --no-pdf to xelatex and then run xdvipdfmx by
hand on the resulting xdv, that usually gives better diagnostics for
pdf generation stage.

Hi,

I tried again and it really works even with the fontenc package so it might
be something Debian specific. I use Fedora with TL from TUG, not the rpm's.

The bug was reported for the TL2018 .deb packages for Buster (testing).

Here on Debian Stretch (stable), repeated builds run as intended with
both TL2016 via package manager, and a current TL2018 from tlmgr.
Maybe, the problem is not within XeTeX itself, but somewhere else
in the Buster userland (freetype?).

Norbert, on which Debian branch were you able to reproduce the bug?

Hi,

There is some important changes to xdvipdfmx made on 20180821 and
20180904 related to PDF inclusion. I could not reporoduce the problem
on Windows 10 but it might be related. Xdvipdfmx version 20180821 had
some problems in including PDF file which was fixed on 20180904.

Thanks, this seems to be the problem. I was surprised that in my
standard TL it also didn't work, but I probably have installed some
temporary xdvipdfmx binaries there which were broken. Reinstalling the
original TL xdvipdfmx, or using the one built from current sources fixes
this problem.

Thanks everyone and sorry for the noise

You mean this:
tlmgr: saving backups to /home/norbert/tl/2018/tlpkg/backups
[ 1/13] auto-remove: libertinus ... done
[ 2/13, ??:??/??:??] update: bxjscls [1705k] (48466 -> 48576 at main) ... done

Interesting ... I hope I can reproduce this again to test it ...

the current package libertinus was renamed to libertines-fonts and
a _new and different_ libertinus must be installed.

Actually, Karl has adjusted already.

Message-ID: <CALBOmsZi+P7mTnFW+KY+c0W1_1M==ZAcBzpvPOrZxDvsGg3+Vg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to ask whether it would be acceptable to include some ICC
color profiles from ghoscript (GS is GPL-licenced, so I assume those
files fall under the same licence) into TeX Live which are needed for
PDF/A compliance of PDF documents.

The files from GhostScript which are needed are:
- default_cmyk.icc
- default_gray.icc
- default_rgb.icc
plus one more file from http://www.eci.org/en/downloads

A while ago there was a discussion on this mailing list as well:
    https://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2013-December/034625.html

What would have to be done to make these profiles a viable inclusion
for TeX Live?

Thank you very much,
    Mojca

Hi Mojca,
the pdfx LaTeX package already provides an ICC profile

  sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc

from http://color.org .  AFAICS this is sufficient to create valid
PDF/A.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks a lot for pointing this out.

It doesn't help though that this file is well hidden behind the "latex" prefix.

If there was a directory set up somewhere under tex/generic  that had
this and possibly other icc profile files I would  be surprised if the
pdfx package maintainers would object to stopping including a copy
with the package to avoid having duplicate files in the input tree.

There was also an idea to create a separate directory
<texmf>/colors/<packagename>, in line with "fonts" as a special type
of files.

I don't want to make a new top-level directory unless there is some
reason why it is absolutely necessary (clearly not, since we've gotten
along with it until now, context notwithstanding).

Is it so hard to type "locate .icc" or "find . -type f -name \*icc" or
"fgrep .icc /whatever/texlive.tlpdb" if one needs to do a brute force
search? I fail to see the problem we are trying to solve.

    GS is GPL-licenced, so I assume those files fall under the same licence

I hope so, but it's not a safe assumption. It would be nice to have more
.icc files.

    - default_cmyk.icc
    - default_gray.icc
    - default_rgb.icc
    plus one more file from http://www.eci.org/en/downloads

Is there any information anywhere on the licensing of those specific
files, rather than just being in the same tarball?

    What would have to be done to make these profiles a viable inclusion
    for TeX Live?

Lacking specific license information, ask the GS/ECI people to make a
statement about it.

Also, as you know, upload a package to CTAN with them. But that's the
easy part.  -k

The current maintainer of pdfx is Ross Moore.  He already asked before
he added the profile to his package.  Since there was no place for ICC
profiles in the TDS specification and Ross was the only one who needed
them, maintaining the profiles wihtin his package was the most obvious
and easiest solution.

The file isn't hidden behind the "latex" prefix at all.  See the
TEXINPUTS entries in texmf.cnf.  For plain TeX we have, for example:

  TEXINPUTS.tex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//

You see that the third element between the braces is empty.  This
means that when nothing is found in $TEXMF/tex/plain and
$TEXMF/tex/generic, kpathsea scans $TEXMF/tex, which undoubtedly
contains $TEXMF/tex/latex.

This only makes sense if TeX Live can provide many PDF/X color
profiles as well.

A PDF/X color profile specifies how a particular document is printed,
which type of paper has to be used, etc.  It's sole purpose is to
allow the printer to blame the customer if something goes wrong.

There are not many PDF/X profiles available with appropriate licenses
for TeX Live.

Adobe offers a bunch of PDF/X color profiles which can be used freely
but I doubt that their licenses are appropriate for TeX Live.  I also
doubt that printers don't accept anything else but the files provided
by Adobe because they are familiar with them.  Please note that ICC
profiles are binary files and you can't easily find out what they
actually do.

TeX users who need PDF/X color profiles should download the
appropriate files from Adobe and maintain them in their current
working directory, TEXMFHOME, or TEXMFLOCAL.  

At the moment I don't see a good reason to create a new directory
which only contains two files.  Don't know what happens in the future.
Adobe recently released a lot of formerly proprietary files and even a
new font family with acceptable license conditions.

If Adobe decides to put their PDF/X color profiles under a reasonable
license, we can evaluate whether a distinct directory for such files
is sensible.  But I don't see any reason to change anything now.

Regards,
  Reinhard

HI Karl, hi Mojca, hi all,

a few comments from the Debian side:

sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc is non-free and should be removed
from TeX Live.

See the long thread of discussion about that here
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=786946
and the final clarification of the license in 2017.

I know I should have written about it earlier, but it completely dropped
out of my memory.

We should inform Ross that he removes/replaces the files in his package,
and the file should be removed from TeX Live.

I agree with Karl here. Too much black voodoo and huge assumptions,
including wrong statements on websites.

Unless there is a clear statement of ECI I would not include any of
them.

Best

Norbert

I'll try to dig further, but given that Debian already packages those
files, I assume there is a reasonable chance that they would be free
enough

Unfortunately a lot of those files might be non-free.

I'll try to dig further.
Ironically a GS update just broke asymptote for me due to apparent
inability to find default_gray.icc.

Looks fine again. Today I saw an auto-install of the previously

I asked to recover the previous ghostscript 9.23 in the TeX Live w32.
So after some days,
asy test.asy
is expected to work as before.

This page says that the ICC profiles *are* free.

But that was back in 2015; then you were arguing that they are free.

OK. There is a single-line statement saying:   "not free"
without any explanation of why Debian has determined this.

which says the file may not be changed.

It is not changed, so far as I?m aware;
 pdfTeX  just includes the binary file verbatim.
Not sure about XeTeX and LuaTeX, but I cannot imagine why
they would change anything about it.



We should inform Ross that he removes/replaces the files in [pdfx]

.. and update the code and doc, which now use the sRGB profile.
Cc-ing Ross.

If this is going to stop Debian from distributing TeXLive, then I suppose
we should change the profile.

Can we switch to:    sRGB2014.icc   from
   http://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.xalter  ?
Or will that be subject to the same objection?

What about the updated v4 profiles, on that same page?

         sRGB_v4_ICC_preference.icc
         sRGB_v4_ICC_preference_displayclass.icc

Their licensing seems to be a bit more liberal than before;
viz.    from   http://www.color.org/profiles2.xalter#license

Licensing

The copyright owner and terms of use of an ICC profile are normally identified in the Creator field in the profile header and in the Copyright tag. Where ICC is the copyright owner, the following license terms apply:

"This profile is made available by the International Color Consortium, and may be copied, distributed, embedded, made, used, and sold without restriction. Altered versions of this profile shall have the original identification and copyright information removed and shall not be misrepresented as the original profile."

ICC recommends that other profile creators and copyright owners adopt a similar wording for profiles that are intended to be freely distributed. See the Profile Registration page for more details.


On the other hand,  sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc
is still available at    http://www.color.org/black_scaled_2009_srgb.xalter
where it says:

Legacy v2 sRGB profile

This sRGB profile has been superseded by the sRGB2014.icc profile, following a 2014 corrigendum to IEC 61966. This previous version of the profile is made available for those who need it for compatibility with existing workflows.
Note that this version of the profile has different licensing terms from the standard ICC profile license

License

To anyone who acknowledges that the file "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_no_black_scaling.icc" is provided "AS IS" WITH NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, permission to use, copy and distribute these file for any purpose is hereby granted without fee, provided that the file is not changed including the ICC copyright notice tag, and that the name of ICC shall not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific, written prior permission. ICC makes no representations about the suitability of this software for any purpose.


So it would seem:
     sRGB2014.icc    is free
     sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc   is not free.

Agreed?


And what about the CMYK profile?      coated_FOGRA39L_argl.icc
Has an objection to this ever been raised?

That file is no longer available at:    http://www.color.org/registry/index.xalter
which is where we got it from, I think.
The licensing on the files available there now says things like:

Profile Name: PSOuncoated_v3_FOGRA52.icc

Profile Provider: European Color Initiative (ECI)

Contact: Florian Suessl

Copyright:  Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG

License: This profile is made available by ECI European Color Initiative, with permission of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, and may be used, embedded and exchanged without restriction. It may not be distributed, sold or altered without written permission of ECI European Color Initiative. Color Toolbox 17.0.0 - (c) Copyright 2015 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. All Rights Reserved.

So these would be classed as ?not free? right?
Is it reasonable for TeXLive to request permission to distribute
from some of these places:  ECI, IDEAlliance, VIGC, ? ?
But if granted, would Debian be able to re-distribute?



I hope the gs profiles are free. -k

Please clarify, and give a clear reason why you think there is a violation
by including these files.


Alternatively, there is this site:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/openicc/files/OpenICC-Profiles/

Worth investigating?



Cheers,

Ross

Hi Ross, Peter, Karl,

first of all, I have to agree it is all very convoluted, and I am not an
expert, but here is what I understood and what I think was the timeline:

* at some point in the past all the icc profiles somehow shared the same
  license statement (or it wasn't made clear on profiles2.xalter
  This is probably when Peter included the _black_sealed one.

* Debian hat a lintian error about this being non-free, and I was stymed
  because the license statement was sufficiently free for me (including
  a renaming clause but that is fine).
  The reason for this is that in the license statement, as of now, there
  is no *explicite* clause stating that changes are allowed (a
  requirement for OSS).
  But it is stated that *altered* versions are to be renamed etc.

* I asked clarification from Debian ftp-masters and they agreed that the
  intention is that changes are allowed with the renaming restrictions,
  and thus the lintian error should be changed.

* Then it turned out that on different parts of the color.org page were
  different license statements, and after clarifications it turned out
  that the _black_sealed is non-free.

That brings me to Ross' analysis, with which I agree:
> So it would seem:
>      sRGB2014.icc    is free
>      sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc   is not free.

This is what I would say, too.

Checking with Debian, the sRGB2015.icc is in the package icc-profiles,
which is in non-free, and the license statement attributed to the file
is recorded as
	License: ICC
	 This profile is made available by the International Color Consortium,
	 and may be copied, distributed, embedded, made, used, and sold without
	 restriction. Altered versions of this profile shall have the original
	 identification and copyright information removed and shall not be
	 misrepresented as the original profile.
	Comment:
	 Apparently applies generally to color profiles with ICC listed as
	 copyright holder in the embedded Creator field, according to
	 <http://www.color.org/profiles2.xalter#license>.
So with the ftp-master decision I think it should actually moved into 
the icc-profile-free package. I will report there and see if I can move
somthing forward, but this is in fact unrelated to TeX Live!!!

Now a few more comments:

On Fri, 07 Sep 2018, Ross Moore wrote:

Because as you found, the _black_sealed has different license terms.

> It is not changed, so far as I?m aware;

Irrelevant. What is necessary is the permission to change ;-)

No no no. I have for now removed the file in the Debian package and
suggested the icc-profiles package to get it back, so no worry on the
Debian side.

Anyway, in all these discussion I normally *completely* ignore my Debian
hat and decide for TeX Live, the rest must be managed from Debian in
some way (I guess I'm a bit schizophrenic ;-)

Not that I know.

Right, no way to have it in TeX Live.

> Is it reasonable for TeXLive to request permission to distribute

No, because we need software/files that follow the FSF guidelines, and
that means that any user of the files can use the obtained files freely
(not going into details here now), which wouldn't be achieved.

> from some of these places:  ECI, IDEAlliance, VIGC, ? ?
> But if granted, would Debian be able to re-distribute?

No, out of the same reasons. And TeX Live also cannot use them.
The TeX Live DVDs are sold by Lehmann which would be in breach
of the copyright agreement.

The question is always whether there is a clear license statement
allowing for free and unrestricted redistribution within the FSF
guilelines.

All the best

Hi Ross,

when I added the files sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc and
coated_FOGRA39L_argl.icc to the pdfx package in 2015, they came with
the following respective licenses, which are included in the package
(in the file ICC_LICENSE.txt):

----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the file sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc:

 Copyright International Color Consortium, 2009

 It is hereby acknowledged that the file "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black
 scaled.icc" is provided "AS IS" WITH NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY.

 Licensing

 This profile is made available by the International Color Consortium,
 and may be copied, distributed, embedded, made, used, and sold without
 restriction. Altered versions of this profile shall have the original
 identification and copyright information removed and shall not be
 misrepresented as the original profile.

 Terms of use

 To anyone who acknowledges that the file "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black
 scaled.icc" is provided "AS IS" WITH NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY,
 permission to use, copy and distribute these file for any purpose is
 hereby granted without fee, provided that the file is not changed
 including the ICC copyright notice tag, and that the name of ICC shall
 not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of
 the software without specific, written prior permission. ICC makes no
 representations about the suitability of this software for any
 purpose. 

For the file coated_FOGRA39L_argl.icc:

 The zlib/libpng License

 Copyright (c) 2008 Kai-Uwe Behrmann

 This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
 warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
 arising from the use of this software.

    3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source
    distribution.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know on what basis someone now claims to have determined that
sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc is "not free". The license above is
the one that came with the file when I downloaded it from the
International Color Consortium's website, and it is explicitly
included in the package so the Debian developer should have seen
it. Such licenses are not revocable, so the file is free.

No, this is not true. Unfortunately I don't have screen shots from
2015 to prove it, but I am always very careful about licenses. When I
downloaded the file sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc from ICC in
2015, I copied and pasted the exact license that came with it into the
file ICC_LICENSE.txt, and I did not alter the text of the license. The
beginning of the license explicitly states:

 It is hereby acknowledged that the file "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black
 scaled.icc" is provided "AS IS" WITH NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY.

These words were not written by me. They were copied and pasted from
the license from color.org. And it explicitly refers to the
"sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black scaled.icc" profile, so it was not some
blanket license somehow shared by all the icc profiles or
misattributed by me.

It is possible that ICC has decided some time after 2015 to distribute
that file under a different license. However, since I downloaded it in
2015, the terms from 2015 still apply, because a license, once granted,
cannot be retroactively changed.

Hi Peter,

thanks for your answer.

Interesting. They seem to have a big mess up there ;-)

Well, these words are anyway irrelevant, what counts is the next
paragraph you included
	 Licensing

	 This profile is made available by the International Color Consortium,
	 and may be copied, distributed, embedded, made, used, and sold without
	 restriction. Altered versions of this profile shall have the original
	 identification and copyright information removed and shall not be
	 misrepresented as the original profile.

The current license statement as also written by Ross and found in the
Debian package is quite different:
	 To anyone who acknowledges that the files
	 "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_no_black_scaling.icc" and
	 "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black scaled.icc" are provided "AS IS" WITH NO
	 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, permission to use, copy and distribute
	 these file for any purpose is hereby granted without fee, provided
	 that the files are not changed including the ICC copyright notice
	 tag, and that the name of ICC shall not be used in advertising or
	 publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without
	 specific, written prior permission. ICC makes no representations
	 about the suitability of this software for any purpose.

In particular does not allow for changes.

Indeed, you are right in this respect, but we are probably having a hard
time arguing that.

I am not a laywer, and although I think it would be worth it, I as
private person will not stand up in this fight. If the FSF or whoever
wants to fight for a clarification, that would be great, but well...

Best

Norbert

Hi Ross and Norbert,

yes. Although my recollection is as I stated, I do not have any
evidence to corroborate it. So I agree with you that the best thing to
do is to replace it with another, free profile (and hopefully to save
some screen shots proving what the license actually is).

Hi, 

I am wondering if there is a problem with these recent changes.

Or more precisely whether some invocation of some luatex font
database generation must be forced manually. I was testing
some question from tex.sx, hence my use of lualatex, with
which I am not familiar.

My last update did

[Thu Sep  6 10:02:47 2018] update: libertinus (47488 -> 48588)
[Thu Sep  6 10:03:04 2018] update: libertinus-otf (48464 -> 48579)
[Thu Sep  6 10:04:31 2018] auto-install new: libertinus-fonts (48577)
[Thu Sep  6 10:05:24 2018] auto-install new: libertinus-type1 (48580)


and when I try this MWE

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertinus}

\begin{document}

This was an essay written to appease an English teacher.

\end{document}

with lualatex

it fails with 

ERROR: fontspec error: "font-not-found"

--- TeX said ---
! 
! The font "libertinusserif-regular" cannot be found.


(this formatting of error message is copied pasted from AUCTeX Emacs buffer)

However, it compiles fine with xelatex. Here with \XeTeXtracingfonts=1

Requested font "[libertinusserif-regular.otf]/OT" at 10.0pt
 -> /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/libertinus-fonts/l
ibertinusserif-regular.otf


Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

what happens with

a) running

luaotfload-tool --force --update -vvv --cache=purge

if it doesn't help, try

b)

\usepackage[usefilenames=false]{libertinus}

Actually the same MWE appears to not compile with PDFLaTeX either

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 LibertinusSerif-tlf-ot1
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for LibertinusSerif-tlf-ot1.
mktexpk: perhaps LibertinusSerif-tlf-ot1 is missing from the map file.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.
)
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file LibertinusSerif-tlf-ot1): Font LibertinusSerif-tlf-ot1 at 600 not found
==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!


so I wrote also off-list to Bod and Herbert to report that problem.

(the above MWE compiles only with XeLaTeX but neither with PDFLaTeX nor LuaLaTeX)


Perhaps, I should wait for TeXLive update simply ?

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

That fixes the problem, thanks. (believe it or not I could not for the sake of it remember how was called the database creation tool, which is my lazy excuse for posting my question).


Regarding PDFLaTeX, your other advice off-list worked too, I did

$ mktexlsr

$ updmap-sys --enable Map=libertinus

(I don't use sudo on my install, although on Mac OS X)

This allowed compilation of my MWE with PDFLaTeX, too.

Thanks for helping out,


Is there something unexpected in tlmgr update process?

Shouldn't it have done these steps automatically?

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

updmap-sys should run automatically after installing
libertinus-type1 but luaotfload-tool not, as far as I know.

I speculate that this might have been fixed by
    http://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=48622
already, it was just an unfortunate timing.

That said, it seems that these two patches help recover the broken 9.24:

Yes, but maybe I can provide more information.

First of all, the pdfx package was formerly maintained by Th?nh and
Radhakrishnan at Sarovar.  There was a web page with HTML
documentation and a file "sRGBIEC1966-2.1.icm".  See attachment.

At this time I was working on a PDF/A implementation in LuaTeX for a
commercial product.  I couldn't use this profile because there was no
explicit license, only a string within the file

  "Copyright (c) 1998 Hewlett-Packard Company" 

Thus I looked for a better one and found
"sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc" at color.org.  The license was
not only good for my project, it was good for FSF, Debian, and TeX
Live as well.  So I asked Ross, the new maintainer of pdfx, to replace 
"sRGBIEC1966-2.1.icm" by "sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc".

What I didn't know until yesterday:  Debian guys found out that
there were two conflicting licenses.  One allows and one forbids
modification.  They asked the ICC for clarification and the answer
was not delightful.  As a result, the ICC changed the license
statement on their web site.

Below is the PostScript code shipped with Ghostscript
("Resource/ColorSpace/sRGB").  It contains the line

   % sRGB color space derived from the public domain HP sample.

which makes me believe that it's derived from the same file
"sRGBIEC1966-2.1.icm" Th?nh formerly maintained at Sarovar.

Presumably HP shipped this file on CDs accompanied by their printers
without further licensing information.

The data in the file below is freely available, see

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB

So if we don't find an ICC sRGB profile with an appropriate license we
can create one ourselves with a license which makes everybody happy.
All we need is a specification of the .icc binary format.

For the time being, Norbert, could you add the file

  sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc

to tlcontrib if you haven't done this already?

  Reinhard

Little CMS (LCMS) is a free OpenSource tool, information on the .icc format
can probably be found there and the specification is hopefully freely
available.

I found the specification at color.org.  But it's quite complex and
requires a lot of knowlege about colorimetry.

I also found some very useful programs at color.org.  Two of them are
very interesting: iccToXml and iccFromXml.  Since ICC profiles are
binary files, the most reasonable way to create them is write a
program in C, as assumed by the specification.  Everything is easier
with an XML file as a starting point.

The C sources of these tools are based on autoconf and compiling the
programs was quite easy on Linux.

It's very nice to be able to convert binary files to XML and vice versa. 

On my Raspberry I just installed the Debian icc-profiles-free package
and now there is a file

  /usr/share/color/icc/ghostscript/srgb.icc

If Debian considers ghostscript/srgb.icc as free, isn't it free enough
for TeX Live as well?  The file contains

  "Copyright Artifex Software 2011"

Is this license appropriate for TeX Live?  I think so because
otherwise neither Debian nor TeX Live can provide Ghostscript.

Debian also provides a file

   /usr/share/color/icc/sRGB.icc

which obviously comes from LCMS and contains

  "no copyright, use freely"

Nicely said.  Sounds like "public domain" at a first glance.  But who
is the author and where does the stuff come from?

After all, I think that if all GNU/Linux distributions already provide
Ghostscript, there is no obvious reason not to ship a file which is
part of it with the pdfx package.

  Reinhard

After all, I think that if all GNU/Linux distributions already provide
Ghostscript, there is no obvious reason not to ship a file which is
part of it with the pdfx package.

Probably best is to ship a copy of this (i.e., one of these ? which one?)
in the  ?/tex/latex/pdfx/  directory.

Another possibility is to specify the full path to it, where needed in
the source of  pdfx.sty .
The problem with this is that it needs to work on all platforms, so the
syntax of the path (or the path itself) could be different.
Maybe Ghostscript isn?t even installed in some cases, since GS normally
isn?t needed when pdfTeX is the engine ?


But there is one aspect of this that I don?t have the expertise in color usage to decide.
How different are the various profiles?
What is the difference between them? Does it matter?
If we make a choice, then there should be a reason for it, concerning the actual
colour output, either on-screen or when printed with different devices.

It would be good to have some explanation included within the  pdfx  documentation,
addressing this issue. That is, saying when it is best to stick with the default,
and when it is advisable to apply a different Colour profile, perhaps with some
examples of when alternatives are either useful or needed.

Who can help with this?

 Reinhard

And where should it be installed? Into the pdfx directory or 
	texmf-dist/tex/generic/icc
maybe?

I think this is an important question and one that *I* cannot answer,
but I guess it makes lot of difference. I used icc profiles paired with
calibrated targets to color-correct slides I have scanned. Without it
the scan wasn't really nice at times.

I think the file (whichever one) should be included with pdfx,
typically in the same directory as the other pdfx files. Each
candidate RGB profile is less than 10 kilobytes (the Ghostscript one
is 2576 bytes in size, and the /usr/share/color one has 6922 bytes),
so there is very little to be gained by not duplicating the file.

As to which profile to include: I don't think it matters much.  Any
user who cares about precise print color specifications can provide
and include their own color profile, using e.g. the
\setRGBcolorprofile or \setCMYKcolorprofile commands provided by the
pdfx package.

The point of providing a default profile is to make life easy to the
rest of the users (presumably the majority) who don't care that much
about professional quality color. Most TeX documents are
black-and-white, with perhaps a few HTML colors like \color{red}
thrown in. They will look okay no matter which profile is used. 

Moreover, as I understand it, RGB profiles are not really meant for
professional use (most professional printers will prefer CMYK
colors). Rather, the point of RGB profiles is to allow users to print
something that "looks reasonably similar to what they see on the
screen". The differences between various commonly-used RGB profiles
are probably quite negligible and I would not worry about it too much.

Subject: [tex-live]  kpsewhich case insensitive?
Message-ID: <CANeU4n-Hgcwb58KJVXE2N9GM8ycRmzNC39yp=fT6GGBap-pYRA@mail.gmail.com>

I know that this is a very old thread, but, I keep thinking about it since
I read it. The latest versions of windows 10 (1803) with WSL installed,
allow to use "case sensitive" for folders using the "fsutils", that is,
"fsutils" is not recursive and must be made folder by folder.

Some days ago I am working on a collaborative (La) TeX project using
github, linux and windows and I have created a small script (csdirtree) to
leave dir trees  with "case sensitive" activated (ideal when using
"auxtree" loved...).

In the future maybe it could be an option to install TexLive using pseudo
"case sensitive" using "fsutils" in win10.

Pablo

Then a simple sRGB profile would suffice for sure. Like the one Reinhard
sent with a straight forward color space transformation.

It was like this for long time (I often did print posters for
conferences, books etc) and CMYK separation was necessary for most
printers. But in recent years I have seen a move - at least in the
normal print business, not the high class super value stuff though I
guess - to be completely fine with RGB.

All the best

Message-ID: <CAJmm9ccaL-3gzaCkfkdHmKyKLG+W+RAbBwmnOthFy_rgtDHWfg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello tex-live,

I am trying to install Tex-Live on a Windows 10 computer, but am running
into a very specific error that has been described online on
tex.stackexchange <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/445086>.

For our homework, it would be helpful if I could compile LaTeX documents
locally on my computer, and I was hoping to use Tex-Live to do that.

Do you have any tips as to how to get Tex-Live up and running? I mainly
wanted to make sure that you knew that the post on stack exchange existed
and that it is still a problem for some users.

Any assistance (either via that link or in response to this email) would be
appreciated.

Thank you,
lowmanstone at college.harvard.edu

Kann you try and see if there a) is a file

 C:\Users\fewr\AppData\Local\Temp\NzH1K9lEZQ\IZqygHcgBk/12many.tar

and untar it manually?

Do you have your own tar in the path, maybe you install cygwin or the
Windows Linux stack? If so remove thepath to this tar manually from
the PATH and run the installation again.

Please put it somewhere under "generic" rather than "latex", if
possible. (I would still vote for creating a separate "color" top
folder at some point, but that's not all that important.)

I'm still waiting for the answer from ECI (http://www.eci.org/en/downloads).

Just to better understand the current situation:
- sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc is not free enough for TL, but OK
for TLContrib?
- For ECI we need some clarification before it becomes clear whether
they are OK even for TLContrib?
- Ghostscript profiles should probably be OK for TL as well (might
need some additional checking first)?

I would also like to include some of these profiles to the ConTeXt
distribution, but it's not clear to me what is allowed (since ConTeXt
distribution is not being sold on the DVD like TL, we are probably on
a somewhat safer side, but I would still not like to run into
troubles).

Yes, it matters a lot as long as one wants faithful colour
reproduction. For "generic red titles" it doesn't matter all that much
and it's more important to be able to create valid PDF/X.

Thank you,

Hi,

did the installer manage to create c:\texlive\2018\texmf-dist? If not, it
is a permission problem. In such a case you should create c:\texlive as
administrator and allow write access to an ordinary user. Another problem
can be caused by an antivirus, some antivirus programs block TL
installation. If this is the case, you would have to disable antivirus
temporarily, but personally I would frst try existence of
c:\texlive\2018\texmf-dist and untarring a file manually as suggested by
Uwe.

Yes, CMYK is prefered because colours on print are mixed subtractively and
thus CMY is required. Black is added for technical reasons (I do not want
to go into details). RGB implies additive mixing used on monitors.
Luminants on the monitors as well as pigments for printing do not work
according simple equations, their spectra are complex. In addition, the
resulting colour of the printed output depend not only on the colours of
the pigment but also on the colour of the paper which is never exactly
white. Thus the selection of the CMYK profile depends on the type of the
process colours as well as on the paper. The RGB profiles differ mostly on
the gamut, i.e. the range of colours that can be represented. AdobeRGB and
Wide Gamut RGB are wider than sRGB. Each RGB is wider than CMYK profiles,
so the conversion process must know what to do with colours that are out of
the gamut of the target CMYK and how to optionally modify other colours in
order not to lose details in the out-of-gamut colours. This means that in
addition to a proper ICC selection it is necessary to set also "intent". If
you have plots with a few colours or a text with a few HTML colours, then
these colours are usually highly saturated RGB. they are always out of the
CMYK gamut and since there is no risk of losing details, the intent should
be set to saturation and any profiles can be used. Even the simplest
equations can be applied because nothing better can be done. This is not
the case of colour photographs where the correct intent is perception. I
have Q60 target (less precise than IT8) and my scanners are calibrated. I
use the software that came with the scanner to calibrate my colour inkjet
printer and using a colour table available as a file and printed on the
calibrated printer I visually set the monitor. Thus I use the RGB profiles
for my scanners. I choose the CMYK profile by making tests on the printer
which wil be used and using the same paper, if the exact colours are
important. It is of course expensive but if high quality is needed you have
to pay. Generic ICC profiles are not good enough for high quality printing.

Good printers have their equipment and papers for high quality colour
printing calibrated and they distribute their ICC profiles for free but
they are good for their equipment and their papers.

Hi Zdenek,

well said, I didn't want to go into that much details. But don't you
have the experience that for normal printing (that is not art books etc)
printers nowadays accept RGB?

For the last book project (collection of scientific papers) I prepared
everything with CMYK etc only to be told they need it in RGB :-(

Anyway, back on topic - you seem to be technically well versed here, can
you suggest a profile that should be used by default unless a user
defines one in pdfx package?

Norbert

The last time we had a book with colors in it the printing house had some trouble in using RGB and converting it correctly to the CMYK setup they use.

They had to dig up some older programmes to do the conversion, and then of course our colors were off (luckily we had parameterized all colors in our Tikz images, so we managed), but having better handling for CMYK would be nice.

I think at least earlier there were certain parts of tikz that forced RGB.

Although it is tar that fails, the top two quoted log output lines are:

Loading http://mirrors.concertpass.com/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
xz: (stdin): Compressed data is corrupt

which points to a problem with the mirrror.

As to tar etc:

The installer prefers the included tar.

As to curl, wget, lz4, gzip and xz, the installer first checks the
searchpath, and uses the included version as a fallback. Here, wget
serves as a fallback for curl if curl is not found.

As to permissions: I never had trouble creating a new subdirectory in
C:\. But if you install as a regular user, you should make sure that
is no C:\texlive already there to which you cannot write. Otherwise,
create a new directory with another name.

It is strange. When I prepare posters for conferences, I do it in RGB
because these small shops accept  files from normal users who know nothing
about colours abd send RGB. When I prepare a real book, they always require
CMYK converted by me to the correct ICC profile and refuse RGB. Once they
told me that thay intentionally switched the automatic colour conversion
off. Once I was just the man in the middle, the author refused to convert
the image from RGB and did not require exect colours. Then the personnel
enabled colour conversion upon my special written request. They can even
automatically convert RGB to grayscale but again, there are several
strategies for such conversin and the automatic conversion need not be the
right one.

If a tool is aware of ICC profiles, then majority  of them uses sRGB as
default so it seems logical to have it as a default profile in the pdfx
package.

    And where should it be installed? Into the pdfx directory or

It should go in texmf-dist/tex/generic/<pkgname>, where <pkgname> is

just because you can :).

As for what <pkgname> should be, how about "colorprofile"? Because, are

As for a new top-level directory instead, Mojca, do you have an argument

ICC stands for International Color Consortium. The extension of the files
with the profile is either .icc or .icm (as I have seen).

I fully support this.
The colour profiles should be independent of the  pdfx  package.
Yes, the package needs to reference them, and include them in documents,
but the package in no sense ?owns? them, nor has it created them.

There are many other resources that  pdfx  makes use of, as does any other
package, which are loaded from elsewhere within the  texmf-*  hierarchies.
I don?t see this as being any different.

Besides, I don?t see  pdfx  as (ultimately) being the only package that produces
standards-conforming PDFs requiring a Color Profile, nor that such documents
necessarily be tied to LaTeX production.

So having them under  ?generic?  seems most appropriate, and we shouldn?t
need to have to distribute them with  pdfx .


Besides, I always have trouble preparing a complicated package for CTAN,
where the structure or the archive submitted tends to be different from the
TDS structure that I use myself under TeXLive for MacOS.
I?m thinking of the  doc/ , font/, source/  subtrees as well as  tex/latex/<pkgname> ;
but all are flattened ? for use with MikTeX ???

How easy will it be for all TeX systems to implement a new branch like
            /tex/generic/colorprofile/
or         /tex/generic/color/public/
or         /color/profiles/public/
or whatever we decide is the best naming ?

    Please put it somewhere under "generic" rather than "latex",

I think we all agree on that.

    - sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc is not free enough for TL, but OK
    for TLContrib?
Yes.

    - For ECI we need some clarification before it becomes clear whether
    they are OK even for TLContrib?
Yes.

    - Ghostscript profiles should probably be OK for TL as well (might
    need some additional checking first)?

I would say "Debian" profiles rather than "Ghostscript", though it may
come to the same thing in this case. It's much more likely that Debian
has checked licenses with approximately the same criteria as TL.

    since ConTeXt distribution is not being sold on the DVD like TL,

It's irrelevant whether TL is, in fact, being sold on DVD (that is,
nothing would change if Lehmann stopped selling the DVD). What matters
is that people (anyone) have the legal ability to do so. That's part of
being free-as-in-freedom software, in the definition that we use in our
little world.

If the ConTeXt distribution decides to admit nonfree files, that's a
major policy change (as far as I know; maybe it's already happened?).
For one thing, we have to be sure that any such files are excluded when
ConTeXt is imported into TL. --thanks, karl.

I've converted the profiles provided by Artifex to XML:

  http://ms25.ddns.net/pdfx/profiles/gs

I'm not sure whether all are useful.  Some do not provide a gamma LUT
but there is a function

  { dup 0.03928 le { 12.92321 div } { 0.055 add 1.055 div 2.4 exp } ifelse }

in Resource/ColorSpace/sRGB, for instance.  Maybe a profile without a
LUT is used as a template by gs in order to create profiles on-the-fly.

My only concern would be if people install the pdfx package
individually from CTAN, they have to go through the extra (and not
obvious) step of installing the new icc package as well. I don't see
any significant downside to simply making this 2k file part of the
pdfx package, or any significant upside to creating a new global
location for this one file.

There are other things that the pdfx package contains, such as
glyph-to-unicode mappings, which can in principle also be re-used by
other packages. But ultimately one cannot make a separate package for
each file, so I think it is better to keep related files together.

This is just my 2c, but you guys are the experts on this so ultimately
I agree with whatever you decide. -- Peter

Who would want to do that? I'm not claiming there are no such
individuals around, but installing it is tedious.

Like already mentioned, the TDS structure is flattened on CTAN, so the
user would need to place every single file individually into the
proper location in the TEXMF tree.

Also, if the user wants to install everything from scratch from CTAN,
what about all the fonts and all the other packages that are needed to
compile a simple document? Doing that without a TeX distribution is
literally a nightmare.

And inside TL the dependency can easily be implemented by adding a
line to tlpsrc if such a package exists.

Other than the licence which apparently prohibits inclusion into TeX
Live in the first place?

I was talking about the ConTeXt distribution ("equivalent" of TeX Live
distribution) rather than about ConTeXt package itself.

You did remove cow fonts from ConTeXt in the past due to "please do
not change these glyphs / work of art" policy violating the freedom to
modify the files.

We are not talking about ConTeXt package at the moment, so nothing to
worry about.

CTAN allows to upload the TDS version in addition to the flattened version
but only some packages are uploaded in both forms.

There are too many packages which simply do not work if another package is
missing. Taking just a single package from CTAN is useful if it consists of
one file plu documentation, otherwise it is a nightmare...

and all this has to be explained in the pdfx package documentation in
great detail. It blows up the manual unnecessarily.

I'm aware that these files are tiny.  But I fear that when we allow
one and the same file to be installed in two different directories, we
potentially open Pandora's box.

Prior to TL 2008, spripts were maintained in bin/<platform>/ and we
noticed that scripts for different platforms had different version
numbers.  It's almost impossible to maintain one and the same file in
two different directories and make sure that they are identical.

BTW, if your mail client is configured to use a monospaced font and to

a 'river'.

Of course not. What about
	colorprofiles
and
	colorprofiles-nonfree
Both could be uploaded to CTAN, while the former one would be included
in TL, the later one in tlcontrib.

I can set up a github repo that collects all the profiles with license
information and creates both packages for upload to CTAN.

Target dir would be as discussed
	TEXMF/tex/generic/$pkg

It is still unclear to me which one should be put into the free package,
so please everyone with interest here, please send me those that you
consider free with the respective license statement and where you got
it, so that I can include them in the package.

Norbert

This sounds reasonable to me.

Same here :)

That's approximately like saying that it should be fully sufficient to
ship just a single font with TeX Live, or to use just a single font in
every single document.
Sure, we need a default font, and if all you want to do is to transfer
some text to another person, you don't really care if it's all done in
a free version of Comic Sans.

I'm not an expert here, but if one single profile was all that was
needed, it wouldn't be required to specify it at all.

We are talking about having at least one free profile which could be
used by default, but some additional ones, even if distributed only
via tlcontrib, would certainly help.

I'm puzzled by the "done" part and you didn't specify that much

to be patient for, say, an hour, and see if it's still frozen after
that time?

I'm not 100% sure how to check that under Windows (under task manager
you can probably check whether "luatex" process is running), but if
you have plenty of Chinese fonts installed on the system, LuaTeX might
try to read and process every single one of them, and that can take a
very very very long time. We had some issues with fonts which took
several minutes per font to finish. This was optimised to some extent,
but still ... if you have hundreds of fonts, it adds up. It's
sometimes even noticeably annoying on a system where only default
provided-by-os-vendor CJK fonts are available.

Since perl is 32-bits, C:\Windows\SysWOW64 is probably substituted
for C:\Windows\System32. Can you verify that
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cmd.exe exists and can be started?

The specification requires an ICC profile to be included but no further
requirement is implied. For users who have just simple colour plots
any profile is acceptable and the default sRGB will do the job For
other applications a special (non-free) profile can be needed. Thus
having one or a few free profiles and other profiles in tlcontrib is
IMHO the best solutions.

No, it's not analogous. Color profiles are associated to (high-end)
devices like printers, scanners, digital cameras, and monitors. They
are generated by calibrating these devices, and are usually provided
by the device's manufacturer, or in some cases, can be generated by
users using (expensive) calibration hardware and software. If a user
needs to supply their own color profile for inclusion in a PDF file,
they will usually use a (non-free) profile that comes with their
hardware or that they otherwise associate with their image data.  For
example, if I take a picture with a high-end digital camera, the
picture file includes the camera's (non-free) color profile as part of
its meta-data, and if I later use the image in a PDF file, the color
profile makes its way into the PDF. This ensures that the printer
interprets the colors in the way intended by the original device (the
camera).

There is no reason, in my opinion, for TeXLive to become a repository
for a large number of color profiles from different sources,
especially non-free ones.

The only reason a TeX distribution needs to include any profile at all
is that certain PDF standards require the inclusion of a profile,
*even if the document does not contain any color* or *even if the
document only includes vanilla RGB color*. Therefore, the reasonable
thing to do, in my opinion, is to include a single, free, sRGB
profile. It may also be reasonable to additionally include a single,
free CMYK profile (such as FOGRA39, which seems to be an ISO standard
for "typical print made by commercial offset litho") in case there are
any users who use a CMYK image from an unsophisticated source that
does not already have a color profile associated with it.

That will never happen.

Ok, please, can *someone* please send either the sRGB or both, and I
will prepare a package. That would close the discussion ...

Good point. Attached are 4 files:

sRGB.iccprofile.xml
sRGB.icc
FOGRA39L_coated.iccprofile.xml
FOGRA39L_coated.icc

The XML files are taken from the Debian colord-1.4.3 source package.
Each XML files contains the text: "This profile is free of known
copyright restrictions".

The ICC files were generated from the XML files by me, today, using
the open-source program /usr/bin/cd-create-profile, which is also part
of the Debian colord-1.4.3 package.

Since the ICC files just contain the information from the XML files in
a different data format, the ICC files are not in themselves original
works and therefore not copyrightable in their own right. However, for
greater clarity, to the extent that I have any rights to these files
as their creator, I hereby waive all of my rights to the work
worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring
rights, to the extent allowed by law.

Each ICC files also contains a UTF-16 encoding of the statement "This
profile is free of known copyright restrictions".

It will also be necessary to update the respective filenames in
pdfx.sty.

Thanks, -- Peter

    minimal scheme (nice and fast)

If you don't actually need to run any TeX, scheme-infraonly is faster
yet :).

    all pointing to the missing

Thanks, I added the xdvipdfmx binary to the dvipdfmx package, where it
should have been quite a while ago, when the *fmx link setup was
constructed.

    not sure they are suppose to be there since mianimal ought to be
    just plain

scheme-minimal has always included both dvips and dvipdfm(x), among
other driver-related things ... --thanks, karl.

This is exactly what I saw with many of my customers:  they need
*some* profile.

Dear Peter, dear all,

Thanks a lot.

BUT ...

I was pointed in private by a pdfx user to
	https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/srgb-profile-comparison.html
which gives a *very* detailed and interesting comparison, though
slightly dated (2012/2015) of different sRGB color profiles, and argues
strongly in favor of the Argyllcms sRGB profile as being the one closest
to the specification with the best properties.
https://www.argyllcms.com/

The original mail to me also contained the following statement
> Regarding other sRGB profiles, there are some that are also close to the
> specification, but there are others that have got a different white
> point, a different tone response curve or a different black point.
> Please try to avoid the latter.

The file contained in the argyll-ref package in Debian is
	/usr/share/color/argyll/ref/sRGB.icm

The discussion at the above mentioned web site - although I couldn't
check all the details - makes me somehow tempted to use the sRGB from
ArgyllCMS.

Peter, what is your opinion on this?

Thanks

Norbert

Yes, why not. The /usr/share/color/argyll/ref/sRGB.icm profile is also
free, it states "Created by Graeme W. Gill. Released into the public
domain. No Warranty, Use at your own risk."

I don't have personally prefer one sRGB profile over another. Since
that website makes a careful investigation and reasoned argument, it
is better than no data at all, so why not go with that one then.

Hello

I?ve been trying to install TeX Live for Windows the last two days, and have not been successful. The installer gets going as it should, but when getting the package tlperl.win32, the download stalls, and after a few miutes, the installer fails.
I?ve been trying many a thing, but it seems, that the file on the CTAN-mirror (http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/ (I?m in Denmark, if that does any difference)) is severely under load (being able to download it takes almost a minute, when the same is possible within a second with the other packages). Could someone look into this, or just help me out, if I?m missing something here.

Best regards
Benjamin

first of are you using an aggressive antivirus?


Have you tried a different mirror, https://ctan.org/mirrors, remember to add systems/texlive/tlnet  to the mirror url (the URL is browsable in a Broswer, if you can find install-tl.zip in the folder, the URL is correct)


Exactly which type of Windows are you using

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with the Tex Live installer - tlperl.win32

Hello

I've been trying to install TeX Live for Windows the last two days, and have not been successful. The installer gets going as it should, but when getting the package tlperl.win32, the download stalls, and after a few miutes, the installer fails.
I've been trying many a thing, but it seems, that the file on the CTAN-mirror (http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/ (I'm in Denmark, if that does any difference)) is severely under load (being able to download it takes almost a minute, when the same is possible within a second with the other packages). Could someone look into this, or just help me out, if I'm missing something here.

Best regards
Benjamin

Here I obtain successfully test.pdf in the TeX Live 2018, by

asy test.asy

settings.tex = "pdflatex";
unitsize(1cm);
draw((0,0)--(2,0));
label("$x$", (0,0), align=W);

See an attached asytest.zip.

Important:

It is possible to use 32bit gsview-5.0 as a default pdf viewer
in asymptote with the bundled 32bit ghostscript DLL.

If you are using 32bit gsview-5.0 as a default pdf viewer,
Uncheck "Options ---> Safer" and write -dSAFER
in "Options ---> Advanced Configure... ---> Ghostscript Options"
instead.

It seems that "Options ---> Safer" in gsview-5.0 does not support
external iccprofiles directory in 9.25, since gsview-5.0 is very old.

Best,
Akira

So, it seems that there is a problem with my system (TeX Live 2018 in 
windows 10).

Doing asy test.asy in

settings.tex = "pdflatex";
unitsize(1cm);
draw((0,0)--(2,0));
label("$x$", (0,0), align=W);

I get the same messages mentioned in 
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2018-September/042279.html.

Is there anything I could do to provide more information to help solving 
this problem? I would be very appreciated.

I may add that at the first time this ocurred, I restored the package 
tlgs.win32 from backup and did it again the second time.

Hi Karl,

whenever I want to have a look at the url package documentation by

texdoc url

the .sty file gets displayed. Entering

texdoc -s url

shows url.pdf as second entry in the list.

Is this behaviour intended?

Kind regards

Message-ID: <87o9cyao01.fsf@siart.de>

After the recent update of Ghostscript to v9.25 ps2pdf fails to produce
correct PDFs with transparency. If I process this MWE

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\begin{document}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-3)(3,3)
  \pscircle*[linecolor=blue]           (-1,0){3}
  \pscircle*[linecolor=red,opacity=0.2]( 1,0){3}
\end{pspicture}
\end{document}

with 'latex+dvips+ps2pdf' I don't see the transparency of the red circle
in the PDF.

Probably it's better to revert back to gs 9.23 again.

It might help to mention the platform and TL version (e.g., year and
whether you installed the
CTAN version or used some linux distribution version).

Problems like this may be due to an old misplaced file or a
non-standard search path.
Please check the output of "texdoc -l url".   On my x86_64-linux
system I see only the full path
"[...]/texmf-dist/doc/latex/url/url.pdf" for a couple TL versions.

The platform is Fedora 28, TL 2018 was installed from CTAN, the output

Hi Jobst and All,

this seems to be an issue of Texdoc, so you can report it to texdoc at tug.org
or even better to open an issue on our GitHub repository:

	https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/

Talking about the issue, it didn't reproduce in my environment (macOS, TL 2018,
everything up-to-dated):

	$ texdoc -s url
	 1 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/url/url.pdf
	   = Package documentation
	 2 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/urcls/URletter-DEMO.pdf
	   = Example of usage (letter)
	 3 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/breakurl/breakurl.pdf
	   = Package documentation
	 4 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/bibtex/urlbst/urlbst.pdf
	   = Package documentation (PDF format)
	 5 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xurl/xurl.pdf
	   = Package documentation
	 6 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/bibtex/urlbst/urlbst.html
	   = Package documentation (HTML format)
	 7 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/bibtex/urlbst/README
	   = Package Readme
	 8 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/breakurl/README
	   = Package README
	 9 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/aurl/README.md
	   = Readme
	10 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xurl/README.md
	   = Readme
	11 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/biburl2doi.man1.pdf
	12 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xurl/Changes
	13 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/bibtex/urlbst/VERSION
	14 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/latex/unamth-template/Latex/Classes/urlbst
	15 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/generic/tex-virtual-academy-pl/latex2e/macro/url.html

To investigate more about your case, we need the output with --debug option:

	$ texdoc --debug -s url

As a side note, if you give "*.sty" or "*.dtx" as a keyword, Texdoc will
search the source file instead of documentation. Thus,

	$ texdoc -s url.sty
	 1 /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/latex/url/url.sty

is completely following our specification.

Best,
Takuto

+0200 by Uwe Siart <usenet at siart.de>, I posted a short note to the
gs-devel list, and got an explanation, and a fix.  Here is what

Subject: [tex-live] Still issues with Ghostscript 9.25
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1537026645.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

A quick Web search turned up some recent links that discuss the
newly-discovered security holes that ghostscript 9.25 has fixed:

	No Patch Available Yet for New Major Vulnerability in Ghostscript Interpreter
	https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/no-patch-available-yet-for-new-major-vulnerability-in-ghostscript-interpreter/

	Ghostscript Flaws Allow Remote Takeover of Systems
	https://threatpost.com/unpatched-ghostscript-flaws-allow-remote-takeover-of-systems/136800/

	Critical Flaws in Ghostscript Could Leave Many Systems at Risk of Hacking
	https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/ghostscript-postscript-vulnerability.html

In the Unix world, it has sadly been several years since Adobe offered
a version of Acrobat Reader for PDF display: our Solaris SPARC version
is dated 8-Oct-2009, and our GNU/Linux x86-64 version is from
8-May-2013.

Thus, ghostscript has become the defacto tool suite for PostScript and
PDF viewing, and few TeX sites outside the Microsoft Windows world
could live without it.

Rather than disabling viewing of PostScript and PDF files, as some of
the above links suggest, we just need to inform our community of the
desirability of upgrading their ghostscript installations.

This will take time: even a Ubuntu Rolling Release (bleeding edge)
system has only ghostscript 9.23 installed; other vendors are much
further behind: CentOS 7 (the latest release from Red Hat) has version
gs 9.07. Mint Linux 19 and Debian 10 has gs 9.22.  OpenSUSE 42.3 has
gs 9.15, and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (bleeding edge) has gs 9.23.

It is unclear whether other PDF and PostScript viewers that are not
based on either ghostscript or Adobe code have similar
vulnerabilities.  They include apvlv, evince, mupdf, qpdfview,
viewpdf, zathura, and likely several others, plus built-in PDF viewers
in recent firefox and chrome Web browsers.

Many thanks for figuring this out. Now I understand that it's not a bug
but an intended change in the behaviour of ghostscript. I can confirm
that "ps2pdf -dNOSAFER" brings transparency back and I will change my
workflow accordingly.

I expect that several members of this list have been long time users
of the ghostscript tool suite, without ever having built it from
source code themselves.  Here is a portion of a posting that I
just made to a local campus mailing list that describes why, and
how, to do that:

This is not correct.  Yesterday I received an automatic update to
9.25.

I guess that the next snapshot (tomorrow or in two days) will provide
9.25 also.

Same here.  I doubt that the platform matters.  The program is written
in texlua with platform-independency in mind.

But texdoc looks for local configuration files.  An alias in such a
file could be the culprit.

indeed. So, I said we need the output of the --debug option.
Someone who get url.sty with "texdoc url" (not "texdoc url.sty"),
please kindly report the debug output.

Thanks,

Using the --debug option - I didn't know it - I found the culprit: an
old (obsolete) texdoc configuration file (dated from August 2009) on the
TEXMFLOCAL path. Removing that file solved the problem.

Sorry for the noise, thank you for your help

Do you have a copy of the file and can you send it to me? It is always
interesting to see to sources of problems. At least it helps me to
give advices to others if something does not work on their computers.

Subject: [tex-live] xindy and folders with non ascii chars
Message-ID: <81qnhxoabwwv.dlg@nililand.de>

Due to a question on tex.sx I would like to try to reawake an old
question (see
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2013-May/033427.html)

If I copy the test file below on win10 in a folder G:\Z-Test\j?rgen

and then run

pdflatex test
texindy test.idx   

it fails with the error message 

G:\Z-Test\j?rgen>texindy test.idx
*** - PARSE-NAMESTRING: syntax error in filename
      "G:\\\\Z-Test\\\\j?rgen\\\\S1Jt2cb7Dx" at position 13

S1Jt2cb7Dx is the temporary file which (on windows) is created in
the current directory and PARSE-NAMESTRING is imho a clisp function. 

Using texindy -d keep_tmpfiles to keep the temporary files and then
looking into them I can see lines like 

    :idxstyle "G:\\Z-Test\\j?rgen\\B0eXOULCND"
    :rawindex "G:\\Z-Test\\j?rgen\\OeXhx_H6VI"

The temporary file is 8-bit encoded.

So my guess is that the problem is with xindy-lisp.exe:
it either can't handle non-ascii file names at all, or gets confused
by the encoding of the path names in the temporary file. 

Is there any chance to solve this problem?
Relocating the tmpfile location to TEMP is imho not a stable
solution: quite often the problem pops up because of user account
names with non-ascii chars. 


%% example document:
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex

\begin{document}
Test\index{Test}
\printindex
\end{document}

Sorry for the inconvenience.
I can find the message in pathname.c in clisp.
"Position 13" is just a non-ascii character.
So I guess that xindy_lisp.exe can't handle
non-ascii file names.

Best,
Akira

I think that lisp has problems with unicode and probably other
characters outside
the ASCII range. Remember that the sort and merge rules are encoded
due to the limitation
of the available character set.

The documentation could be improved by showing the most common
architecture strings and using a placeholder in the code (but one
of the strings could be good as well, provided it?s explained clearly
what?s to be actually substituted for a particular system).

But, for sanity?s sake, PLEASE DON'T send messages formatted
with the font I don?t want to mention the name of! :-D

Ciao

It does not include the font itself.

AFAIR TeXLive does not distribute font support files for fonts not included in TeXLive.

Just a guess. Texlive requires a package to include its documentation
source. AFAICS, there is verdana.pdf but no verdana.tex
(verdana.dtx/ins do no generate verdana.tex).

TeX Live does not include support packages for non free fonts. Please use tlcontrib for that, where verdana is included.

See tlcontrib.trxlive.info

Would it be related to the necessity to own the font for producing this
documentation?

Well, I asked the question precisely because I thought I had already see
packages providing support for non free fonts. But I was probably wrong:

It's likely we'll remove all 32-bit machines from the DVD image (not
from TL) next year in order to gain enough space.

I'll change the example platform in the doc when that happens, but
probably not before. I don't want to unnecessarily churn the
documentation, implying all translators need to update, etc.
There is nothing wrong with "i386-linux" as the example, though
certainly I agree that nowadays "x86_64-linux" is more common.

I think metavariables would be more confusing than helpful to newbies in
this case. Non-newbies presumably don't have a problem with this simple
text in any case. Brevity is also important. -k

Sorry, my error.
I have actually had a hard time installing Texlive 2018 and removing tl2016
(another hard time to install).
Your info about i386 architecture is OK but it seems to me that's not the
most common nowadays, and so can mislead one to make errors. Not in my
case, as I took a good reading in the page and some notes about the painful
tl2016 installation. Everything went smoothly after some 3 workarounds and
some hours; "everything" includes running xelatex form command-line and
from Kile.

Problems I had: as it is my case, not a Linux expert, I had some possibly
trivial problems with manpath.config.
1) As suggested
MANPATH_MAP /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux \
            /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/man
for which I had
for luiz:
luiz at black10:~$ man apt
man: can't parse directory list `/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/man
'
man: can't make sense of the manpath configuration file /etc/manpath.config
I use Ubuntu and the continuation character \ is not recognized, the
problems disappeared after removing it and leaving all info in one line, as
in
MANPATH_MAP /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux
/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/man

2) /etc/environment. Just placed /usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux
at PATH
PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games"

3) No need for symlinks.

I know that brevity is important but texlive is a winner among newbies and
experts, at tex.stackexchange and around the web.
Nevertheless, congrats for your inestimable good work and time, and for TUG
team (my companion of some decades).

Cheers

I saw that you sorted out the problem on tex.sx and found a

IMHO, if we have reached a point where space is that tight, then we've
reached the point where the media capacity needs to be expanded. How
much space will deleting 32 bit support gain and how much time before
that is not enough? And have other features already been removed in
the past to gain needed space?

I for one would be willing to pay a little bit more to get *everything*.
Who knows when an old 32 bit machine has to be brought into service as
a backup system when its modern replacement develops a problem? And
those old machines are exactly the ones where compiling from source is
such a lengthy ordeal, where binaries are of the most help. How about
folks in the less developed countries who are still using older machines
(a major feature of TeX is that it does not require much processing
power). 

Tex Live is currently using double layer DVDs with a capacity of about
8.3 GB. And data compression techniques are already being employed. 

Sandisk 16GB USB flash drives can now be had for $5.49:
https://www.adorama.com/idscbu16gb.html
A better deal can be obtained at higher quantities and/or off brands.
For example:
https://www.amazon.com/TOPSELL-10PCS-Flash-Pack-Memory-Storage/dp/B016RO18JO
$3.23 each in qty 10.

32GB units are in the $6-$10 range:
https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Attache-Flash-Drive-P-FD32GX5ATT03-MP/dp/B01MQ0RR5O/
https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Flash-Drive-Performance/dp/B01EG72D1Q

but one has to be careful to only use reputable sellers (not Ebay, not
Amazon third party sellers) to avoid all the fakes out there. Be sure
and check the reviews for reliability. I myself would stick to well known
brands such as Kingston, Sandisk and PNY even if they cost a little
more.

As far as USB drives with logos and/or preloading services go, see:
http://blog.notdot.net/2009/12/DIY-USB-preloading-with-nix
and also do a search for

USB flash drive bulk preloading

But watch out that many of the preloading services don't support
preloads more than 1-2 GB, well, at least not at the $0.50/drive
level.

Also, search EBay for 

USB flash drive duplicator

They run about $2000 per 30 drive-at-once capability:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/SySTOR-1-31-USB-Memory-Stick-Duplicator-Jump-Drive-Wiper-Copy-Flash-Media-Data/142942568899
and there are units that can do more than 170 at once:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/SySTOR-1-174-Standalone-Multiple-USB-Port-Duplicator-Flash-Drive-Cloner-Sanitize/192661338502

Once the move is made to an "actively evolving media" such as SD cards
or USB flash drives, then we can ride the wave of Moore's law instead
of being stuck with the now-forever-fixed capacity of DVD.

I assume that bluray is not a viable option here because of the
significant percentage of machines that do not have bluray read
capability.

Another approach would be to go to a 2 DVD package, but we'd be
riding a linear, not exponential, media capacity wave there.

 
  Just my $0.02,

This may seem to be a valid idea, I have such an old machine with
linux distro which is 7 years after end of life. A newer distre
requires more RAM but there are no slots for more RAM in this machine.
Will TL contain i386 binaries for after-end-of-life distros with
obsolete versions of glibc? If not, I can either use the historical TL
2011 or compile from sources anyway and hope that I will be able to
compile it with obsolete gcc and obsolete glibc.

On one conference I received proceedings on a cheap USB stick. I was
never able to read anything from it. I tried to use it just as a USB
stich and found that it does not work at all. I would never recommend
cheap media. (Fortunately the proceedings could be downloaded from the
web of the conference.)

My experience has been that it is increasigly hard to find a working
DVD reader.   Many new systems don't have a DVD drive, and when
you do find a DVD drive in an old system it often fails to read your DVD.
I don't know if USB drives fare better in the mails than a DVD (I once
received a DVD in an oversize cardboard envelope that had been
folded to fit in my rural mailbox -- the DVD was neatly split into halves).
DVD's use more power than USB keys so are being left out of systems
being used in remote field sites with limited power.

USB memory keys are replacing DVD's in many use cases.  The extra space
available with USB keys would make it easier to distribute files for
less popular
platforms and eliminate some of the discussions over what to include on a DVD.

Dear all,

I really appreciate all your suggestions regarding alternative media for the TeX Collection. However, please note, that AFAIK a USB stick or other flash medium can _not_ be produced to be used for all three major platforms Windows, Unix and Mac.

Secondly, for the last years we were able to sell the TeX Collection DVDs to the user groups for 0,45 EUR, which is _much_ less than any flash medium would cost (especially when quality is important).

Best regards
Martin

Hi Luis - thanks for your further explanations. My immediate reaction is
that it would be better to delete the "Environment variables: Global
configuration" section from the manual than write further explanations
there, because, as already mentioned in that section:

    .... there is just too much variation between systems in how and
    where these things are configured.

Thus, it would be better not to give the "hints" at all than hints
which proved to be problematic for you and probably others.

In my view, anyone who needs to install the native TL globally (rare
indeed, IMHO), as opposed to for themselves, should have enough
experience with software installation not to need a cookie-cutter recipe
(which we can't provide).

For the majority for whom self-installation suffices,
http://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html is my attempt at a minimal
installation. (I just changed i386-linux to x86_64-linux there, BTW. :)
The same information with more explanations is in the manual.

Thanks again,
Karl

Still much too expensive in order to offer them for free to members of
TeX user groups.  DVDs are very cheap.

But the main problem is there is no filesystem appropriate for all
operating systems.  I've heard that recent versions of Windows allow
to mount ISO9660 images if they are files on an NTFS filesystem but do
not recognize an ISO9660 filesystem on a USB stick.

We already considered UDF, which is supposed to be platform
independent.  But it's still not supported by all systems and it seems
that it will never be.  I do not see any progress.

Yes, this can only solve the problem in the next two or three years.
It's not really a solution, though removing stuff is also painful.

The current size of MiKTeX is 2.7 GB. I'll never understand why
Christian insists on doing everything himself instead of simply
adapting his system so that MiKTeX can use at least the platform
independent TeX Live packages.

I'm sure that almost everybody is using the network installer
nowadays.  For the few users with unsuffient internet access in
developing countries we definitely find individual solutions.

You have to buy a new DVD every year.    USB flash drives could be
returned for updating.   Local user groups could do this with disk to
disk copying.

There should be no need for a filesystem that supports huge files.
FAT32 is widely supported but needs large sector sizes for large
media.   This may not be a problem for a filesystem populated with
archives.   VFAT (long filenames) has been supported in linux for
years.

Even in some developed countries, internet access for many
people uses cellular data.  While there is often internet access
at schools, coffee shops, and libraries, it isn't practical to run
a download that takes an hour.

In remote areas and ships at sea, internet requires expensive
satellite links.

To be honest, I am not convinced, that 2000 members of DANTE e.V. (or at
least a significant part) will return their USB flash drives. Secondly,
I don't want our secretary or anybody else to copy the data to 2000 USB
flash drives.

And again, we are talking about prices less than 0,50 EUR per DVD and
year for producing and shipping. Just shipping the USB flash drive back
to our members would be more expansive.

You will have to inform them that they have to return it and how long
will you wait?
When I use "dd" to move and ISO image of Live Linux, it takes 6
minutes for 1.6 GB.
If TL has > 8 GB and DANTE has 2000 members, imagine how long it will take.
In addition, if VFAT is mounted on Linux, all 8.3 names appear in
uppercase while
longer names appear as they are. It might cause problems.

Binaries are, IMHO, not the cause of the problem, nor is their removal the solution.? The TeX Live installer offers a number of schemes -- why not pack all binaries and the files needed by as many of the the smaller schemes as possible onto DVD-1 and the additional files needed by the larger schemes onto DVD-2 ? ? As the size of individual schemes increases, this solution will scale to accommodate DVD-3, etc.

The economics depends on reducing the 2000 DVD's to the number that are
actually used.  Commercial popularity of DVD's for videos and technical manuals,
etc.  once made DVD copying businesses practical.   Now some techical manuals
are distributed in the form of a tablet that replaces a stack of DVD's
while others
are available online.

Many of the same companies that provide mass DVD copying and mailing are
now doing USB flash drives.   See
https://www.newcyberian.com/usb-flash-drive.html
for an example.

Moving to USB will not be a simple project, especially since the goal
is to include
less popular systems so relies on testing by others.

DVD's provide a durable collection of older versions for those who have DVD
readers.   USB keys tend to collect malware, so recycling is not something that
can be done by ordinary users, and there will be more failures than for DVD's.

The cost of this option is astronomical

I would, however, support making a limited edition of TL USBs with
beautiful logos for special purposes: gifts, prizes, promotional
materials etc.  Not as a substitute for our regular mass-produced
DVDs, but as a complement for special purposes.  And I would support
sending them to those members who opt to pay for them.  Maybe we could
even make a profit if USBs are beautiful enough to be collectible
(= capable to be sold at higher prices).

Well, it's not just the cost of blank DVDs, but the cost of burning,
the printed sleeves (which are very nice and well done, BTW. That's
what I would miss most with USB drives). If all that can be done under
the 1 $/EURO level, wow, that really is incredibly cheap.

We could still produce DVDs for free distribution, but those would, and
could, not carry everything. And as time goes on, the fraction of the
full distribution they carry is going to have to become less and less.

Not to suggest the free software world is without quirks, but the 
proprietary software world always seems to come with such irksome
baggage and malfeasance.

USB drives can be partitioned just like regular hard drives. So, they
can carry multiple filesystems. However, we would want to do this in a
way that minimizes redundancy. 

We could even go with 32GB USB units, and/or expect the unix systems
to be able to mount FAT32 and/or NTFS filesystems.

Alternatively, I would even consider a more radical approach - use the
linux ext2 filesystem to carry the vast bulk of the files and then
include a partition(s) with drivers to allow ext2 to be read under
Windows and Mac:

http://www.ext2fsd.com/
https://sourceforge.net/projects/osxfuse/
https://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-ext2/

The Windows/Mac user would first install the needed ext2 drivers, then
they could proceed normally from that point on using the distribution
files carried on the ext2 filesystem.

I know there are a lot of potential pitfalls here. We would have to
make sure such drivers actually work, could be redistributed freely,
etc. Tis just another option to consider. By no means am I recommending
such a radical approach until we had more information/testing.

FWIW, this is another area where I think our governments are lacking -
the establishment of a free/open/patentless filesystem standard that
most all consumer devices would be required to support. Cameras and
other data handling devices should not be using file formats owned
and controlled by Microsoft. Ditto for fonts (government agencies
should have developed/used only free fonts for normal business and
standardized their availability and use in consumer devices - as a
base standard to permit uniform information interchange, not mandates
beyond that).

Of course, we/users would have to be the ones to bear any added costs,
not TUG.  I do agree that return shipping costs would be too great
relative to $6 USB drives. Also, be aware that USB drives do *not*
qualify for the cheap USPS media mail rates here in the US. So, they
will cost more to ship than DVDs:

https://www.endicia.com/tools-resources/newsletter/2012-fall/understanding-the-media-mail-classification

We just have a question of a tradeoff between price and features. I would be
willing to pay more to get more. The added space of USB drives could also
allow for additional features - the collection of TUG articles, other
bonus material, etc.

Maybe we could offer a flash drive *option*, for say, $20, - beyond the
break even point so that it is even profitable for TUG to offer this
option. Maybe the USB option could come in different Unix, Windows and
Mac "flavors" (filesystems). It could serve as a test trial for the
future.

Even if the USB drive approach is not viable, I would prefer a 2 DVD set
over deleting material. Once the build system for older hardware is no
regularly longer used, it might not reappear even after the space
limitations have been overcome, which is going to have to happen in 2-3
years anyway. Let's just go to the 2 disk set sooner rather than later.
Charge us more as needed. We are going to have to do this in the near
future anyway, right?

As for the cost of a 30 USB drive duplicator, it amounts to less than
$2 per TUG member. If a mere two dozen of us donate $100, we've got
it. For a 55-at-once unit:

https://www.ebay.com/itm/SySTOR-1-55-Standalone-Multiple-USB-Port-Duplicator-Flash-Drive-Cloner-Sanitizer-/141803513416

we would need 43 members to donate $100. These units can copy the
whole media (block by block) do have a post-write verify option
which would automatically catch any bad drives.

I realize there is going to be an additional labor cost of whoever 
operates it, but we have to pay that cost even with DVDs, right?

For the record, count me in as one who is willing to donate in
the hundred dollar level to help out here.

Maybe we should take another online survey of the options and costs
and see what members want and are willing to pay for?


  Cheers,

  Mike

This turns out to depend on how Clisp was built, at least.

If your distribution of Clisp contains a clisp.h file (or if you built
Clisp from source and have your build tree around, src/config.h), then
there's a macro definition for VALID_FILENAME_CHAR that defines what
bytes may occur in a filename.

For example, on one Ubuntu host I've got access to,
/usr/lib/clisp-2.49/linkkit/clisp.h contains this line:

#define VALID_FILENAME_CHAR ((ch >= 1) && (ch != 47))

On this Ubuntu host, the Lisp expression

  (parse-namestring "G:\\Z-Test\\j?rgen\\S1Jt2cb7Dx")

returns, i.e., it does not error.

But on one OSX host where I've built Clisp from source, src/config.h
contains

#define VALID_FILENAME_CHAR ((ch >= 1) && (ch <= 127) && (ch != 47))

and, indeed, on this OSX host, the earlier Lisp expression errors.

Dear Developers,

I hope you are doing good.

I am new in TeX and LaTeX, I was working in the Windows environment using
MiKTeX and TeXstudio. I recently switched to Ubuntu OS (18.04) I installed
TeXLive and TeXstudio many times because of a problem of not being able to
compile a simple file. Until I found this incredible answer here
<https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/177073/165284>.

My request to you, dear Contributors, is: I really want you to implement
this feature in the upcoming releases of TeXLive. It really is helpful. It
took me a lot of time to find this solution.

Because I am a newbie, this recommendation might be abnormal. If so, I
really am sorry about that. Yet I appreciate your time and effort in
creating and maintaining this gigantic piece of software.

Best regads.

    zw> Will TL contain i386 binaries for after-end-of-life distros with

We're still producing binaries for centos 6 == glibc 2.12. They're
available from tug.org/texlive/bugs.html (along with the Build
invocation to do it). It lacks luatex, xetex, etc., since those can no
longer be compiled on that old of a system. The situation with luatex
might change for the better next year, though.

Older than that, no.

They are not included in TL itself; that's too much trouble for too
little gain. --best, karl.

Hi Michael and all -

If you or Boris or anyone wants to produce a distribution on USB, by all
means, go for it. We could sell it through the user groups or make it an
optional extra for members. Whatever.

I wouldn't try to integrate it with the current image creation at all.
(which is basically a script that sets a bunch of options and runs
mkisofs, or rather xorriso in mkisofs mode). Creating something for USB
would surely have to be quite different.

Most platforms are about 150MB. That adds up to a lot of packages. It
might be that we freed up enough space last year for some years to come.
We never know until it comes time to build the final DVD image.

No "features" have ever been removed to make space. The reason that
removing platform binary sets is attractive is that it can be done
without impacting anything else -- the available platform list is
already computed dynamically by the installer. Whereas removing anything
else (say, a huge font package) implies many more infrastructure
changes. I don't recall a single user complaint that the removal of the
less common platforms has caused a problem in practice ...

Archiving for posterity doesn't seem like an issue to me. All TL
distributions are available online and will be forever (as far as I'm
concerned). If someone absolutely needs some old distribution and
doesn't have the bandwidth to download, they can ask someone who does.
TUG also has old DVDs for most years (of zero interest to the general
populace), and I imagine other user groups do too.

The feedback I've gotten is that relatively few members actually use the
DVD. Thus I'm not excited about going to the trouble and expense of
making a second DVD with the removed platform binaries. There would be
no way to integrate it into the installation, for sure.

I heartily agree with your comments about public standards.

Best,
Karl

Hi Lahcene,

thanks for your message.

This is completely unrelated out of the following reasons:
* you originally posted that you installed TeX Live from TUG into
  /usr/local/texlive/2012
* you installed only the basic, which, by its description, does not
  provide a full environment. We strongly suggest installing the 
  default texlive-full.
* the answer you linked to is about installing the Debian/Ubuntu version
  of TeX Live, which is again something different.

So, without going down to details, I guess what has happened:
- you installed TeX Live from TUG into /usr/local/texlive/2012
- you did NOT adjust the PATH setting globally (in /etc/profile or
  similar) but locally in ~/.bashrc or similar
- you started TeXstudio from your Desktop Environment, but there your
  local PATH settings did not take effect
- TeXstudio couldn't find any tex because, well, as I wrote, it is
  not in the PATH
- you called "apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended" which installed
  TeX Live from Debian/Ubuntu into /usr/bin, which is in the PATH of
  the default desktop environment
- TeXstudio now uses the TeX Live from Debian/Ubuntu in /usr/bin instead
  of the one you installed in /usr/local/texlive/2012

Anyway, there are many answers on tex.sx about this, and this is nothing
*we* as TeX Live developers can fix for you, because it is your computer
and we cannot do magic tricks there.

Best

Thank you for your reply.

 I want to mention that many answers in the Tex.se site are misleading. One
reason is that You have gave me good information about setting a path
locally or globally. I didn't came across any of this before.

Well. I have installed the TeXlive from DVD (3.48 GB), which I am sure that
it installed everything.

 My problem is that I probably didn't set the path correctly. Could you
give some directions about how to set the path globally in Ubuntu 18.04 .
And about refreshing the file name database. And how can I check all of
that.

Because I am having a problem of missing packages and classes which I have
checked that they are located in use/local/texlive/2018/.....

Best regards

It depends on your architecture, look into 
	/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/
and add the directory found there, most probably you have
	/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux

Then add a file /etc/profile.d/texlive.sh containing
	PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH
	export PATH

Log out/reboot and your system should use the TeX Live from TUG. Test it
by running
	which tex
which should give you
	/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux/tex

Many thanks. I find the following in the present
version in TeX Live 2018 (w32):

CLISP version 2.49.92 (2018-02-18)

#define VALID_FILENAME_CHAR ((ch >= 32) && (ch <= 61) && \
(ch != 34) && (ch != 42) && (ch != 47) && (ch != 58) && \
(ch != 60)) || ((ch >= 64) && (ch <= 132) && (ch != 92) && \
(ch != 124) && (ch != 130)) || ((ch >= 137) && (ch <= 234) && \
(ch != 152)) || ((ch >= 240) && (ch != 252))

Thanks,
Akira

Setting PATH (or environment in general) is rather a Linux topic, it
is not TeX Live specific. Console applications take settings from
~/.bashrc while GUI programs from ~/.bash_profile. Thus if you set
PATH in ~/.bashrc, TL will work from the terminal but not from TeX
Studio. On my computer .bash_profile reads .bashrc so that I have the
same settings on both places. However, to make the changes visible in
the terminal it is sufficient to start the terminal od even by:

. ~/.bashrc

In order to make it visible in GUI apps you have to restart GUI either
by logging off and on or by Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.

It is really .bash_profile in CentOS and Fedora, maybe it is distro

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc

It is a bit more complicated. Here an excerpt from bash's man page
which gives you an idea:

When  bash  is  invoked  as an interactive login shell, or as a
non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and
executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.
After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,
and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from
the  first  one  that exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option
may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

Dear Lahcene ROUANI,

Did you install TeXLive directly from TeXLive (e.g., from the TL DVD or
over the web), or did you install the texlive-full Ubuntu package?

It would have been better to do the latter, since that is set up specifically
for Ubuntu.

Sincerely,


Paul Vojta

I thought it might be a malloc bug in the latest glibc, but the glibc
maintainers advised me to run valgrind. When I did that, it showed:

Turns out that the latest glibc code (as found in the latest revisions
of Fedora) is much better at catching malloc heap corruption. I thought
at first it was a glibc issue, but the Fedora glibc maintainers helped
me to confirm that it was not.

It looks like there is a one-byte heap overflow, maybe in the
FOR_ALL_CHARACTERS macro in char_routines.c?

I'm learning a lot as I go on this one, but I think I've gone as far as
I can. Any and all help in fixing this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

    It is really .bash_profile in CentOS and Fedora, 

Not at all. It depends entirely on the user's login shell. It has
nothing to do with the distro.

.bash_profile is read only by bash.
.profile is read by bash, but also by the original Bourne shell,
and probably others. (Logically, all Bourne-compatible shells should
read it, but since when does logic mean anything ...)

There are similar considerations for .bashrc, which is bash-specific.
(There is no equivalent "generic" file.)

As already mentioned, this is not a TeX Live topic ... --karl

I guess representation of the default code page that is used.
In a perfect world clisp would look at the LOCALE and decide based
on that what are the valid filenames ...

Hi everyone,

there have been so many comments, but as the one who made lots of
experiments with USBs on all the big platforms here a few comments:

Tere is no filesystem that is uniformly accepted *AND* which 
support symbolic links - we need symbolic links because 
all the Unix-like systems have links for the biggest part of the
"binaries".
UDF would be the best option, but has problems on both Windows
and MacOS.

NTFS would be also possible, but it is not supported on MacOS out
of the box in most cases.

(After finishing the email and re-doing research) It seems that more
recent versions of MacOS *do* support *reading* NTFS out of the box
(and read/write can easily established by remounting or other options).

That means we could consider doing USB sticks with NTFS as base file
system, which should work out of the box at least on Win, Mac, Linux.

I can try that out easily, but I don't have a recent Mac to test.
If there is enough interest I can produce a USB disk image that one can
download and flash onto a USB stick for testing.



Now for answers to some of the emails:

Both don't support links.

> Binaries are, IMHO, not the cause of the problem, nor is their removal the solution.? The TeX Live installer offers a number of schemes -- why not pack all binaries and the files needed by as many of the the smaller schemes as possible onto DVD-1 and the additional files needed by the larger schemes onto DVD-2 ? ? As the size of individual schemes increases, this solution will scale to accommodate DVD-3, etc.

This would require considerable change of the installer program - which
nobody has currently energy and interest to implement.

That of course is easily possible. One could have two or three types
(Windows - Mac - Unix) and format it with different file systems.

That is the *only* possible option: partition, copy everything two
times.

One *could* reuse some parts of the vfat (windows) part for the Unix
installation and only take the bin/* part from a dedicated Unix 
partition (for the links), but that again needs serious work on the
installer, currently a no-go.

As said, NTFS would be definitely fine, but MacOS does not support it
AFAIR. At least the version I had and tested needed third-party 
drivers installed. (See above for new infos)

No no and no ...

Message-ID: <7e357c8a-9897-2822-85c6-09e5cf4aab27@yahoo.de>

In revision 48729 the new release of `ducksay` got included into TeX Live.
Unfortunately the 3 auxiliary files `ducksay.code.v1.tex`, `ducksay.code.v2.tex`
and `ducksay.animals.tex` got installed into the doc tree. Those 3 files are
necessary for the package to function properly and should be put into
`tex/latex/ducksay/` instead.

Also is there anything I can do during packaging to prevent such misplacements
in future packages and/or releases of mine?

Best regards,
Jonathan

I guess the maintainers of miktex and texlive rely either on
documentation or on their looking glasses supported by their
experiences. The latter might fail though...

As I can imagine that the maintainers take a look into the README file
I'd recommend to mention it there?

Upload a TDS-style zip to CTAN? Then the system maintainers can just use 
that, and the layout is down to the uploader.

Yes, this is another possibility. 

We usually don't recommend it for such small packages because in the
past it had caused Karl more work if the TDS zip archive wasn't
packaged correctly. The same presumably for Christian Schenk.

Sure, but here there was obvious some confusion, so it's not a one-file 
package ...

Very helpful, but if the extra space is to be used for less popular
platforms then we do need to consider USB support on less popular
platforms.

So an all-platforms USB would have to be a "mirror" of tlnet.
The installer (install-tl.{tar.gz,zip}) would have to be extracted
to a native filesystem and run using the USB drive location
in the installer's "-repository" option.  This is a bit complex
for many users who have become accustomed to installing
from an App Store.

Correct, but there are many older, mostly 32-bit, Macs still running Snow
Leopard.

These newer systems don't need the binaries for less popular OS's,
so the audience is users who have a recent system (USB 3 but no
DVD drive), and limited internet.

The future seems to be thin and light systems with USB 3 but without
DVD drives, so such tests would be useful.   It would help to collect
data on the performance of USB installs using current USB 3 hardware.
https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-usb-3-0-thumb-drive/ has some
information on the current state of USB flash drives.  My experience with
DVD installs is very limited, but as I recall they were very slow.   Users
could buy external USB DVD drives, but if they are only going to use a
DVD drive for TL installs then USB flash drives are probably cheaper and
faster.

The TeX Live installer offers a number of schemes -- why not pack all binaries and the files needed by as many of the the smaller schemes as possible onto DVD-1 and the additional files needed by the larger schemes onto DVD-2 ?   As the size of individual schemes increases, this solution will scale to accommodate DVD-3, etc.

If the number of TL users with access to DVD readers is, as I suspect,
in decline,
investing in a multi-DVD installer won't have long-term benefits.  The
older systems
that can use DVD's probably include many of the 32-bit OS's that will
loose out if
the DVD's going forward only support current mainstream 64-bit OS's.

Yes, PARSE-NAMESTRING is a clisp function.

I don't understand why the backslashes are doubled. I would have
expected a namestring
  "G:\\Z-Test\\j?rgen\\\\S1Jt2cb7Dx"
(cf. https://clisp.sourceforge.io/impnotes/path-external-notation.html)

The conversion from '?' to '?' can be explained as follows: clisp
uses the so-called "ANSI code page" (= windows-1252) for output,
but the console you are using is set to interpret arriving bytes
in the so-called "OEM code page" (= CP850). In fact '?' = 0xFC in
windows-1252, and 0xFC in CP850 is '?'.

As documented in https://clisp.sourceforge.io/impnotes/encoding.html#enc-dflt
filenames are supposed to be encoded in *PATHNAME-ENCODING*.

When you start clisp (in the build used by texindy), what is the
value of CUSTOM::*PATHNAME-ENCODING* ?

The handling of filenames in Windows, Linux, and macOS is quite different.
The only common things are that the variable *PATHNAME-ENCODING* exists
and this macro VALID_FILENAME_CHAR is defined in some way.

It is normal that the VALID_FILENAME_CHAR expression is complicated
like this on Windows. Ulrike Fischer's problem is that the character
0xFC = 252 is considered invalid by this expression.

In a Western (English US) Windows I get this expression:
#define VALID_FILENAME_CHAR ((ch >= 32) && (ch <= 61) && \
(ch != 34) && (ch != 42) && (ch != 47) && (ch != 58) && \
(ch != 60)) || ((ch >= 64) && (ch != 92) && (ch != 124))

Apparently this expression depends on the system encoding of Windows.
This creates a problem when compiling clisp on, say, a Chinese Windows
and then running it in a Western Windows or vice versa.

Registered as bug https://gitlab.com/gnu-clisp/clisp/issues/10 .

When the user enters an invalid file name,
1. clisp signals an error before the file name hits the file system,
   namely already when the Lisp pathname gets constructed,
2. the error message indicates the cause (remember that errors on
   a file system can be caused by invalid file names, permission
   problems, or even temporary issues like disk-full problems).

And 3. On some systems, really erratic things happen when you pass
file names with invalid bytes to the operating system.

Yes, that's essentially what clisp does already, through the
*PATHNAME-ENCODING* variable (which is set based on the locale).
But it does so at a different location in the code, not already
while parsing a file name.

I've resolved https://gitlab.com/gnu-clisp/clisp/issues/10 by
limiting the check to ASCII characters, because it's the ASCII
characters (like ':', '<', '>') which are the most risky w.r.t.
weird behaviour on the file system.

Just a note, my El Capitan 10.11.6 does not support NTFS. I bought a
third party driver. I was on a conference this July, there was an
official MacBook for showing the slides and it was unable to read my
NTFS USB stick. Fortunatelly I tried well in advance so I could send
it to the organizers by an e-mail from my MacBook and they transfered
it to the official one.

    Upload a TDS-style zip to CTAN?

I much prefer to get an email from an author telling me how I messed up
so I can fix it than to have them prepare a .tds.zip. When summed over
all authors and all packages and all releases, it winds up being less
effort (both for me and for authors) that way. -k

Hi Jonathan,

    the 3 auxiliary files `ducksay.code.v1.tex`,

Sorry for my mistake. Fixed for tonight.

    Also is there anything I can do during packaging to prevent such
    misplacements

Manfred's suggestion of putting succinct information into the README
(run dtx, then *.sty and *.tex -> tex/latex/ducksay) seems like the best
to me. Although I cannot promise that I will not make mistakes even so.

Also, instructions are only important when files are added or removed
from the runtime. As long as it's only the content of files that
changes, I just blindly update them anyway ...

thanks,
karl

I think it needs to be even newer, maybe 10.15 .. but well, that is all
a pain. Let us drop the idea of NTFS again.

Thanks for info Karl.

You know, when I first looked into this, I said to myself, "surely I
can come up with an easy suggestion to get some more space on the DVD".

The ideas that quickly came to mind included:

 1. Use a double layer DVD.
 2. Use compression and/or
 3. Use an improved compression algorithm
    e.g., .xz instead of .gz or .zip.
 4. Increase the compression level setting.

Of course, given the unusually high intelligence and dedication of TUG
members/developers, I quickly realized that all the above had already
been done. Well, I didn't actually check #4 (e.g., xz -9), but by the
time I got to that one, I was willing to bet that already had been done
too (or if not, that it is known the higher RAM requirement of the -9
setting would be problematic on some systems).

Had it been any other group, chances are I would have been able to offer
some quick and useful advice, but no, not in TeX circles. As we say here
in the South, "it ain't that easy 'round them there parts".
LOL!

If we had to, I think we could overcome the link issue. Links would
be implemented as text files, maybe with a unique suffix (e.g., .lnk)
whose text contains the path, or rules for the path, to the object
to be linked to. The installer then would detect and interpret these
.lnk files as needed for the given target system during the installation.

But, I have to ask, how does the installer handle the case where the
*target* filesystem of the installation does not support links?
(e.g., FAT32)?

Hi Mike,

I think we do not use -9, due to heavy load on build and install
systems.

That could indeed be an option BUT it would defeat the whole idea of
having the ability to use the install media also as live system.

If we go for tlnet (archive/*.xz) then there *are* no symlinks and any
filesystem (maybe even vfat) would be fine.

But if we want a USB stick that can be used as installer as well as
running a live system links on Unix are necessary.

Not at all. If you are running Unix and install to a vfat/fat32 system
then you are hosed ;-)

What I mean is, a user is running MS Windows with a FAT32 filesystem,
and they want to install Tex Live on it using the DVD. They can do
that, right?

But, I do see a big problem with regard to running directly on a USB drive
(The "Live" part of TeX Live) on filesystems without symlinks. I suppose
the linked files would just have to be duplicated, and then there would
have to be a data file that contains all the link information. During
installation to filesystem that does have symlink ability, the duplicate
("link") files are simply replaced with symlinks instead of being copied
as-is. Well, something like that.

Hi Ulrike,

It may be too late but I looked into this, and I guess
the issue is difficult to be perfectly solved by xdvipdfmx.

The below is my investigation.

(1) Saving the MWE as test.tex, compile

$ xelatex -no-pdf test
$ xdvipdfmx -vvvv test

shows

%====

>From the above log, there should be some temporary files involved.

(2) I could find four temporary files (attached), and the last-created one
(the above dvipdfmx.tyivt6) looked like a PDF generated by Ghostscript.
It contained /MediaBox [ 0 0 2384 3370 ]. It seems that these values
were used to calculate annotation rectangle.
(Note: 2375.09 = 2384*72/72.27, 3357.41 = 3370*72/72.27)

(3) Back to dvipdfmx.cfg, distiller parameters (passed to rungs) contain
-sPAPERSIZE=a0
which is the reason why GS has set /MediaBox [ 0 0 2384 3370 ].
I don't know how to create a PDF with tightly-cropped /MediaBox with GS.

(4) BTW, the annotation rectangle is sometimes wrong for EPS image
inclusion too. Note that the distiller parameter -dEPSCrop is effective
for EPS (it wins -sPAPERSIZE=a0), but the annotation rectangle is
always set to the /MediaBox of PDF without scaling.

%====
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}

(Not so much for Bruno, but as context for others reading this who can
be expected to be unfamiliar with the Common Lisp language or the Clisp
implementation...)

The Common Lisp language standard requires that when a file operation
receives a string argument, the file operation is to implicitly parse
the string and conditionally augment the parse with information that
might be construed as ``missing'' (for example, by appending an
extension if one is missing, say). This behavior bears a sort of family
resemblance to TeX82's filename handling, as Common Lisp's ancestor
languages also evolved on PDP-10 systems. For example, the parsing is
loosely analogous to scan_file_name in section 526 of TeX82; and the
augmenting is somewhat like a generalization of both pack_buffered_name
in section 523 and pack_job_name in section 529.

Additionally, the Common Lisp language standard allows the
implementation to detect invalid file specification syntax at its
discretion; that's what Clisp is up to here.

Anyway, under ordinary circumstances, the consequences of the parsing
and augmenting are effectively null. However, since most modern
programming languages simply pass strings to system calls without any
parsing or augmentation (albeit, for some languages, with implicit
encoding to code points), the fact that Common Lisp is required to parse
and permitted to error during the parse might be considered surprising.

Additional file naming notes that could trip up xindy users on Clisp:

1. [Probably relevant only on Unix.] To my knowledge, Clisp's file
handling offers no means to address any file or directory using a
specification that contains either a question mark or asterisk.  There
can be some workarounds:

1a. If the offending character occurs in a directory, change to that
directory before starting Clisp, and address the file using a relative
file specification that omits the directory.

1b. Create another name for the file, either by linking or renaming the
file or offending directory. (To my knowledge, it's impossible to do
this from within Clisp itself.)

2. When Clisp's file specification parser encounters a "dotdot"
directory, it elides the dotdot and the directory level preceding it,
e.g., the string

  "/home/me/foo/../bar"

parses to an object that denotes the same as

  "/home/me/bar"

This parsing behavior is documented in Clisp's manual, and so is
presumably deliberate; however it has the consequence that in case foo
is a symbolic link to some directory other than an immediate
subdirectory of /home/me, the parse will denote a different pathname
than the original string does under Unix or Windows pathname resolution
rules.

There are some workarounds for this, too:

2a. Change to the desired directory before starting Clisp, and address
files using only relative specifications that omit the directory.

2b. If it's necessary to use a specification that includes a directory,
figure out a name for the directory that does not include dotdot. One
way to do that on Clisp is to use ext:cd repeatedly to resolve the
directory part of a string prior to passing the string to any standard
Lisp routines, but that's kind of grisly.

Regards,
Richard

Windows part of TeX Live of course doesn't have symlinks! And if you
select *additional* unix archs for installation that will probably break
on FAT32. But normal Windows installation of course works without any
problems.

Or, on the USB all the symlinks are replaced by the actual files, and on
the next update with tlmgr they are converted to links.

But also this is problematic, because some scripts *might* use readlink
etc to find the position of the real script and use the derived
directory, which would break again.

Message-ID: <CAD+mzox4d3R-LkS3GWLE_HAu4t8=Je7FAxBAU4k9O7NxpmxZFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

First off, let me state that I have extreme sympathy for people who have to
develop for windows. That said, by default, the windows installer running
on windows 7 breaks with the Perl.exe failing. I had to use the -v gui text
option and install a full install of Perl.

A few things about this process, do not tell anyone to disable firewalls or
anti-virus software. That makes your product look extremely sketchy. I
understand that you can't plan for everything but if someone told you to
just run this strange script as root while disabling the firewall and
anti-virus scanners, you should be very suspicious.

Also, honestly, you should have it working under windows 7 at this point.
Turn the firewalls on. Run the installation scripts. Fix the problems. I
shouldn't have an xz error throwing a perl.exe error. Assume that users are
installing this in a corporate environment as a local user with reasonable
security. We are long past the point of saying that users should disable
computer protections.

Also, make the default install location C:\Users\<local user> if they are
not running it as admin and C:\Program Files (x86)\ if they are. It's the
little things like that which will solve a host of problems. If I tried to
install something as a user on C:\ it would just fail.

Thanks,
~Ben

Your problems are not everybody's problems. The installer is tested
under Windows 7, without turning off protections, both as a regular
user and as adminstrator.

On an out of the box Windows installation, regular users _can_ install
software in the root of C:. In a corporate environment, there may be
indeed be more restrictions.

Installing in the root of C: is not uncommon for Windows ports of
open source software. For one thing, some third-party scripts
included in TL may not have been tested with spaces or funny
characters in path names. So it is not clear whether your suggestion
would be an improvement.

Hi all,

Yes. I am well aware that my problems are not everyone's. That said,
searching for Perl.exe throwing an error on a texlive install under windows 7
results in a lot of hits so apparently it isn't just me.

I know of no applications that install any software on root in windows or
Linux by default. I have used both extensively for more than 15 years. I
mention setting paths precisely because it is a port. The defaults since
Vista was to install user applications in their AppData directory. Python
does this. Python 2.7 used to install under root this but they stopped and
now follow the common paths. The default location since XP was to install
32-bit applications in C:\Program Files (x86)\ and 64-bit applications in
C:\Program Files\. Both require admin rights. Since you know if they are
running the install as admin and you know that it is windows, it shouldn't
be too difficult to set a default path better than root.

Regarding Philip's response, that is true and texlive already seems to
partition the executables well in a normal user install. I can't think of a
better place for computer-wide data. I have seen way worse than to place
computer wide and accessible files and folders within Program Files. At the
very least, the default single user should probably be in AppData.

Installing directly under C:\ requires admin rights and is typically
frowned upon. Telling users to disable security features is quite bad. This
isn't an opinion. If someone handed code to you and told you to run it as
root but make sure to disable your firewalls and anti-virus software, you
shouldn't install it. We are well past the era where we just get to
magically trust code. Also, unfortunately, users might not know how to
disable a firewall or even have rights to do so. I don't know what Perl is
doing to need ports open but given that it seems to be a persistent problem
and has been for at least 4 years, I wish to bring it to your attention. I
don't know how difficult that would be to fix and I don't know what the
error is.

Basically, I tried installing it, the install still gives errors, I don't
know why, the error messages are less than helpful, it seemed to require a
full perl install, and the -v gui text seemed to work but again, I don't
know why.

Oh. Another note about the installer. If perl.exe does crash, the install
looks like it completes. It would be nice to give an error message saying
that the install did not complete successfully.

Believe it or not, I don't want to sound mean. This product is awesome. It
is just too complex to give to someone who isn't a developer and tell them
to install it and following your advice opens their computer up to
vulnerabilities. Since Lyx is actually that simple and Lyx demands a
TexLive install, I would love to see it get to a point where a normal user
can simply install it or report useful errors. Way easier said than done I
am sure.

Thanks,
~Ben

Hi

> Loading http://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/repository/toolkit/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

Indeed, that is strange a mirror.

The tlpdb and sha512 are correct, only the actual signature file is
broken (the texlive.tlpdb.sha512.asc).

I have no idea why this is, and have contacted CTAN to check up on the
mirror.

You might contact the admins of the huaweicloud - but I guess they wont
fix it.

Thanks for the report

Hi Benedict,

many people have already answered to your comments, so I only add a bit
more. First of all, thanks for your comments, they are appreciated!

This is strange and unexpected, as mentioned before. It is hard to say
with Windows what might interfere, though.

You might be right, but there are hardly any installers that unpack
(xz/tar) out there. We consistently get problems with virus scanners
holding off creation of files via tar/xz to check them, which in the end
breaks the un-tar process and the whole installation.

That sounds all like a *very*nice*theory*, and if would be
*reproducible* then one could check and fix it. The problem with these
kind of errors are that they are 
* mostly confined to certain computers
* there is no recipe to reproduce the same behaviour
If you can consistenly reproduce the problem, and give a recipe that one
of our developers can consistenly reproduce the same behaviour on our
computers, then we can look into it and fix it.

The problem with Windows is that it is roulette, and not computing.

Agreed, and I would be happy to have this status.

Actually there is a way, but no volunteer (we are all vounteers) has
stepped forward to do it: Create a repackaged version of TL similar to
MacTeX, with all files already in place, no way to choose any
configuration, and create a normal .msi installer.

Technically not a problem, but I don't have interest and time for doing
it.

Would you step forward to provide something like this?

The maintainer of MacTeX does it also on a volunteer basis and does a
stupendous job. 

All the best

Norbert

Where exactly are you told to disable the firewall?  AFAIK only virus
scanners are mentioned.  The firewall shall *never* be disabled.

Anti-virus programs which scan files while they are written to a disk
shall always never be disabled.  These scanners do not interfere with
the TeX Live installer, apart of maybe occasionally reporting false
positives.

Only anti-virus programs which scan the whole disk *and* unnecessarily
prevent other programs from writing files to a particular directory
while it's scanned interfere with the installer.  Such programs can
safely be disabled temporarily, of course, because they are unable to
detect viruses immediately.  Whenever a virus exists on your disk,
it's too late anyway.  It might have been executed already before it's
detected.

I don't think that it's a TeX Live issue.  Any other big software
package is certainly affected too.

As far as the default installation directory is concerned, in TL-2008
the installer evaluated an environment variable (I don't remember but
maybe something like %PROGRAMFILES%) in order to install to a
directory where Windows expect programs.  This worked fine under XP
but many users were not able to install TL on Vista.

Since Windows treats every directory on drive C: differently, except
the root directory, we had to switch back to C:\texlive as a default.
I'm not happy with this decision but we have no other choice.  Users
expect that everything works out-of-the-box.

Windows is a moving target, not an operating system you can rely on in
the long term.  At the moment it's best to install at the root of
drive C: by default because all other directories on this drive are
"maintained" by Microsoft with unpredictable behavior.  I'm sure that
experiencecd users avoid drive c: anyway. 

 > First off, let me state that I have extreme sympathy for people who
 > have to develop for windows.

When we started to write an installer which is supposed to support all
operating systems, we assumed that Perl offers a layer of abstraction
which allows us to easily write a script which works on all platforms.

Believe me, it was a nice dream.

Without the tremendous work done by Siep Kroonenberg, Tomasz
M. Trzeciak, and Akira Kakuto it would be impossible to support
Windows at all.

Supporting Windows is definitely a challenge but the most important
thing, in my opinion, is that TeX Live behaves identical on all
supported platforms, regardless how difficult it's to achieve.

Regards,
  Reinhard

IIRC, this was the only way for a student of mine to install TL on its
Windows computer. Such a case seems to be exceptional but sometimes
arises.

I am not sure that antivirus software does not interfere. It depends on the
antivirus. As I know, it is possible that a directory is temporarily locked
and is not writable. There was a discussion on it some time ago so probably
now the installer can cope even with this problem. Another problem is that
an antivirus software can interfere with the installer. If I start a
program unknown to the antivirus, the process is killed, the antivirus
examines it and if it passes, the process is started again. The good news
is that if I push th button that I do not want to report the existence of
the unknown program the antivirus remembers is and the next time the
program is whitelisted and runs.

The problems are even larger. I have Windows 7 in a virtual machine and use
subversion and git on it without any problem. Other users take advantage of
my software available from subversion. I explained them how to fetch it and
they do it on Windows XP, 7, 8, Vista, 10. All Windows computers in our
institute are installed by the IT department with the same firewall setting
and with the campus license of the antivirus. Yet on one Windows 10
computer "svn checkout" crashed rporting that the disk is not writable. I
tried to checkout it into another directory, tried to do it as system admin
(with the highest rights as people from the IT department), with antivirus
disabled, with firewall disabled and nothing helped. Windows experts from
the IT department tried to help but we do not understand why it does not
work on this one computer. Finally I did checkout on another computer and
transfered the whole tree on a USB.

I know that I am now a bit off topic but I just wanted to demonstrate that
life with Windows can sometimes be very difficult.

I can revert the binaries to the ones before the rebuild, and ask Ken to

Well don't worry about me too much, I have other systems available
(although this is my main working setup)...
with cygwin there are so many local dependencies and potential
conflicts, it would be good to know if it's working for
anyone else or if it's just me before you revert, thanks.

Hi David,

Is your Cygwin installation up to date?  In particular, do you have cygwin-2.11.1-1?

It does work for me.  I suspect the problem is that David doesn't have the 
latest version of cygwin1.dll (see my earlier message).

I was scared someone would ask that:-)

$ uname --all
CYGWIN_NT-10.0 dc-bantham 2.9.0(0.318/5/3) 2017-09-12 10:18 x86_64 Cygwin


so I suppose 2.9.0 != 2.11.1

I could update (I suppose, I hope the rest of my working environment
doesn't break) or do you want me to test anything before I update?

I would strongly recommend updating.  If you want to confirm that that's the 
issue before doing it, you could try

   strace ./pdftex.exe

If my guess is right, you'll probably get a pop-up saying that the entry point 
of some function can't be found.  "Some function" here would be a function that 
exists in cygwin-2.11.1 but not cygwin-2.9.0.

I have to leave now and probably won't be reachable again for the next 7 or 8 hours.

I'd tried that before actually but was given too much information to take in:-)


Anyway it all seems to be good, but if this comes up again, hopefully
people will see this thread and know what to do.

Sorry, my fault. I have been on conferences etc for quite some time and
didn't have time to prepare the upload to CTAN etc ...

Will try to do it tomorrow or day after tomorrow.

OK ;-). Do you know the status for pdfx? It hard codes the old
names, so would need an update too.

So finally, someone else has run into (presumably) the same problem as
me, as I reported in the tlbuild list on 2018-04-08:
https://tug.org/pipermail/tlbuild/2018q2/004207.html

Back then, I didn't find a solution there, so I cannot give some clever
advice here )-:

(Even worse, my tests did succeed when called explicitly from the shell,
instead of by the test suite.)

I'll poke at this in my free time.  Would be interesting to see if it also happens
on openSUSE/SUSE distributions (though 32-bit development support was dropped from
SLES 12).

Tom,

Which compiler are you using?  I have seen crashes due to optimizer bugs,
but that was years ago.  Just so I am on the right page with respect to
the build environment you have.

Hi all,

with recent changes I will push to our repository finally it is possible

Norbert unveils such feature at the same time Microsoft holds a 
developer conference in Orlando, Florida (MS Ignite 2018). Coincidence? 
I THINK NOT!

Another thing to note is in the man page of xz:

   -7 ... -9
   These are like -6 but with higher compressor and decompressor memory
   requirements. These are useful only when compressing files bigger
   than 8 MiB, 16 MiB, and 32 MiB, respectively.


So the -9 gain in your example, which indeed is very significant
(36MB for -6 versus 19MB for -9), can only be obtained with such large
files. This explains Karl's seemingly contradictory result:

Karl Berry <karl at freefriends.org> wrote:

in that, in the TeX Live collection, the number of files over 32MB is
not a high enough percentage of the total to provide much of a
compression advantage for the -9 level. Of course, one could organize
the file collection into a few dozen .tar "parts" compress those and then
decompress/untar each part as needed to the target's filesystem during
install. Tis not pretty and it seems would demand too much of the install
machine in terms of CPU, RAM and drive space, but according to Johannes's
results above, we could potentially get a near halving of the media space
required for the distribution DVD with such an approach.


  Cheers,

  Mike

As a sidenote, maybe it's worth looking at lzip. It won't compress

Lots of statements, but not really convincing. Reading through the
linked Debian thread starting at
https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/06/msg00173.html
no conclusive answer is found.

The biggest critique is about data checking, which we do anyway after
download with separate sha256 hashes, so this is not an issue.

I agree that in principle a simpler format with only one container and
no nesting of containers and variety of filters would be nice, though.

But, it is c++ and although I don't know what level of it, supporting
lzip would mean building lzip utils on all our supported systems which
might be a pain.

Norbert

  Indeed not.  The point, repeated many times, that the xz format is
inadequate for long-term archiving is not really an issue for TeX Live.
I?m also amused by the statement that the format is ?unreasonably
extensible? :-)

  And, needless to say, it weakens the argument that the writer is also
the author of the competing program, even if he?s being honest and
discloses it.

    So the -9 gain in your example, which indeed is very significant

Thanks for analyzing this, Michael.

I might have actually given up on xz -9 before it finished. I don't
remember for sure any more what I tried. I know -9 was not a practical
thing to do on the entire TL distribution.

It's true there are relatively few files that are >8,16,32 mb. I also
worry that the increased memory requirements on the user's side might
end up being a problem.

    the file collection into a few dozen .tar "parts" compress those 

Yeah. Well, one year at a time ... --thanks again, karl.

It should not be a problem for modern desktop computers but will definitely
be a problem for computers as Raspberry Pi.

Subject: [tex-live] tikz graph drawing libraries are not found
Message-ID: <b417ca6f-cf92-1e50-9eb2-0fdac95b7b4a@tu-dortmund.de>


Hi all,

Today I installed a TL2018 on Linux and no tikz graph drawing libraries
are found anymore.

Here is a minimal document, compile with lualatex.
`The error is ! Package pgf Error: Graph drawing library 'trees' not found.`
No other libraries can be found. The files are there as far as I can
see, e.g.

/home/maxnoe/.local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pgf/graphdrawing/tex/pgflibrarygraphdrawing.trees.code.tex


```
\documentclass{scrartcl}


\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{graphdrawing}
\usegdlibrary{trees}



\begin{document}

Hello World

\end{document}
```

Any Ideas?

Cheers
Max

I think basically it is necessary that a font used in the documentation
must be free, or if the package is about a font then that font must be
free.

Here my understanding regarding documentation and fonts in a package.

If a package can be added as a TeX Live package it must satisfy:

1. The source of the package documentation must be included.

2. The font used in the package documentation must be free (mentioned
by Norbert).

3. The font used in the package documentation must be install-able as a
TeX Live package (mentioned by Lars).

4. If the package, like verdana, provides support for a specific font
then we have the same for the documentation and of course this specific
must be free and it must be install-able as a TeX Live package.

Karl is the one to confirm or to correct me.

Message-ID: <3B24E26D-A195-4676-BBA4-50281B376A77@gundla.ch>

Hello all,

I have problems with LuaTeX 1.0.7 from TeXlive using Windows 7, 32 bits. I try to load an image with 

img.scan{...}

! error:  (pdf backend): reading image file 'Z:\foo\c?w.pdf' failed
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

See this mail to the LuaTeX mailing list:

https://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2018-September/006953.html

and it's follow-up

https://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2018-September/006954.html

which suggests that I should ask here, since there seems no problem with MikTeX's version of LuaTeX.

The code that is used (I don't have a TeXlive 2018 installation on windows) is

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}%
\directlua{
a = img.write({ filename = "c?w.pdf"}) 
}
\end{document}

Is there anything I can do about it? 


Patrick
