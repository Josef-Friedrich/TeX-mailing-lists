Dear Dominik,

According to Debian we will probably have to delete the British
hyphenation patterns from TeX Live unless the licence changes. See:
    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=912557

In general it is becoming increasingly problematic to use custom
(free-text) licences for each individual file. (It's problematic
enough to keep up distributions of millions of different files with
well-established licences, let alone having each individual lawyer
check whether the licence in file X is compatible with the licence in
file Y for N^2 combinations of those and ever increasing N.)

A while ago we started suggesting the pattern authors to agree with
the MIT licence, but some other licences might be acceptable as well
(note that LPPL in particular is not acceptable for a number of
projects).

Best regards,
    Mojca

Message-ID: <20181102142507.GA4159@hzdr.de>

Good afternoon,

I don't seem able to run scripts that depend on Perl in TeXLive-2018
for Cygwin. (I installed vanilla TeXLive-2018 separately.)

What am I doing wrong?

Kind regards.


E. g.:

  grahn@*******1 /cygdrive/y/bin/texlivecurrent
  $ ./install-tl --print-arch
  /usr/bin/env: ?perl?: No such file or directory
  
  grahn@*******1 /cygdrive/y/bin/texlivecurrent
  $ perl -v
  
  This is perl 5, version 26, subversion 2 (v5.26.2) built for x86_64-cygwin-threads-multi

Sorry, but I can't reproduce that on my 64-bit Cygwin system:

/tmp/install-tl-20181102
$ ./install-tl --print-arch
x86_64-cygwin

/tmp/install-tl-20181102
$ perl -v

This is perl 5, version 26, subversion 2 (v5.26.2) built for 
x86_64-cygwin-threads-multi

Are you by any chance working in an MSYS environment, so that /usr/bin/env is 
not Cygwin's /usr/bin/env?

The UK hyphenations patterns must stay within TeXlive, that's a given.  So
let's change the license on the pattern files.  As co-creator of the file,
I hereby agree with the MIT license.  I don't know if Graham Toal, the
person who worked with me on producing these patterns, can be reached.
I'll try.  I am certain it was Graham's intention, like mine, that these
patterns should always be freely available to everyone.

Since Phil Taylor is the official custodian of these patterns, perhaps he
should also give his assent.

Do you want me to edit the file appropriately?  Or will Phil, or you, Mojca?

Thanks for bringing this to my attention!

Best,
Dominik

Hi,

I just want to thank Dominik Wujastyk and Graham Toal for giving us
the permission to use the MIT licence for the British patterns.

We will take care of the required modifications, release a new version
of hyph-utf8 and also ask for update in ConTeXt which triggered the
initial bug report.


To try to answer the concerns regarding the stability of old documents
... I believe that what we need in TeX distributions is something
different from "please rename the file if you make any changes". (I
don't know what this could or should be, but I'm open to suggestions.)

While the "TeX licence" made a lot of sense at the time when it was
written by D.E. Knuth, the "please rename" clause on its own provides
absolutely no guarantee that hyphenation of the English documents
won't ever change. Yes, the "TeX licence" is still sending a very
strong message to developers that Knuth wants others to rename their
new engines based on TeX to avoid confusion, but it doesn't legally
prevent anyone from using the same name for completely unrelated
software, or perhaps from creating a symlink like tex -> luatex in
some distribution. What keeps people back from doing that is more of a
"social contract" than the actual licence itself.

As a case in point: anyone could have easily REMOVED the British
patterns from the distribution without violating the existing licence
in any way, yet the documents would change ? despite the licence's
best efforts to prevent such changes. Or somebody could create some
nonsense patterns under any given filename, and only modify the
language.dat to load those nonsense patterns *instead of* the existing
British English ones, and again we would get rubbish output without
violating the old licence in any way.

So: thanks again for the permission. And if needed, let's come up with
a better idea about how to keep stability and quality of old documents
within the TeX community.

Thank you very much to everyone involved,
    Mojca

\pdffilemoddate gives a date with the local time zone, even if

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\pdffilemoddate {article.cls}

gives for me D:20180529230632+02?00?

This is a problem for automated tests, e.g. when embedded files in

Could \pdffilemoddate be changed to always us the "Z" time zone if
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set?

Hi Ulrike,

Will do. Since pdfTeX primitives are involved, I think we should
require that FORCE_SOURCE_DATE also be set.

It was introduced several years ago. The problem was that the search
algorithm in XeTeX differed from the search algorithm of xdvipdfmx. Fonts
may exist in several versions and may be incompatible, it was especially
the case of FreeFont but other fonts are affected as well. It happened that
several versions of the same font existed on the computer, XeTeX picked
one, created xdv and xdvipdfmx built the PDF using another version and the
result was garbage. The preference rules in all font systems are not only
complex but quite often not obeyed. The absolute path ensures that XeTeX
and xdvipdfmx use the same font so if you get garbage, you know why. I do
not know whether there is a better way how to solve the problem.

I do not know whether there is a better way how to solve the problem.


On the face of it that seems a good argument for xetex to put the
absolute path in the xdv file so xdvipdfmx uses the same font, but
does that necessarily imply that  xdvipdfmx lists the full path in the
resulting pdf output? If it could at least optionally not do that then
testing of pdf would be easier to set up with reproducible build

No, PDF contains the font as embedded subset, not its path. The path makes
no sense for PDF viewers.

That issue should have been fixed very recently, in r48418:

* cmap_write.c, tt_cmap.[ch], type0.c: Fixed a bug that CMapName in CMap
 resource is not properly written. Not correctly handles PostScript
name and string
 objects. Use CMapName constructed from font's BaseFont.

But that is the whole issue: the PDF does have the path:

hence I fail the pdf test that Ulrike generated on windows, with this diff:

! /CMapName /c:-texlive-2018-texmf-dist-fonts-opentype-public-lm-lmroman12-bold.otf,000-UTF16
def
! /CMapName /-usr-local-texlive-2018-texmf-dist-fonts-opentype-public-lm-lmroman12-bold.otf,000-UTF16

I just tested with the newest xetex from win32tex.org and now get

So it really looks fixed ;-)

I can confirm the behavior.  It shows up for me on macOS 10.13.6.  My most recent update was on October 29, FWIW.

And also, I have, in the last 4-5 days, used texdoc successfully, so that, e.g., ?texdoc latex? or ?makeindex? displays something reasonable, even if I run it several times.

Must have something to do with the argument.

The inclusion in current texlive of texlive-includernw (depending in

texlive-collection-mathscience, hence in texlive-scheme-medium, is causing 
havoc for those who upgrade texlive because texlive-includernw tries to

elsewhere. I can't see a list of maintainers of 
texlive-collection-mathscience, so cannot see how to get 
texlive-includernw de-listed urgently. It should be free-standing only, 
and should be re-written to check for dependency availability on R at the 
level of the user rather than root at install time. This probably cannot 
be done. The package should actually do the checking at run time only, 
providing helpful messages only.

The problem may be an over-ambitious Texlive Fedora packager - the issue 
hit me on upgrading from Fedora 28 to Fedora 29 today.

Oh! I see. That's a problem.

I don't know who put it there! I do not know how it ended up in TeXLive fedora,

but I do have email addresses of some TeXLive guys, and I could try to contact them?

Agreed.

Agreed, but I'll give it a shot anyways.

At run time is better than install time, or no?


I did not intend this package to cause any inconvenience, and

I find it extremely odd that it's actually attempting to install R-knitr?

Excellent, and congratulations on being included - it means others find 
your contribution useful! But please do try to investigate whether it is 
the inclusion in the collection (I believe this is the case) that causes 
the install-time checks, or whether it is a mis-understanding by the 
Fedora texlive packager.

That's what it does on Fedora. Maybe there are specification settings in 
the package (is the source on a repo, if so where?), but it could be the 
Fedora texlive packager.

Sorry to jump on you, but this cost me a good deal of worry before I 
understood why upgrading Fedora had installed an R rpm with R packages 
including R-knitr.

This list (tex-live at tug.org) is about upstream TeX Live. We have no
influence on what Fedora, or any distro, does wrt dependencies or
anything else. I suggest submitting a bug in whatever way Fedora
prefers. --good luck, karl.

Hi,

as Karl said, this seems to be a Fedora only issue.

Furthermore, I am suprised about this:

> havoc for those who upgrade texlive because texlive-includernw tries to
> install R and many R packages without checking whether they are installed
> elsewhere. I can't see a list of maintainers of

Do you mean *using* the .sty file and running a tex file using it
installs R packages? I looked into the sty file and only saw R code
being executed of the form
	library('knitr')
	..
On my system this does *not* automatically install anything, but gives
an error if knitr is not installed.

OTOH, if the *Fedora package* (rpm) depends on R packages, then this is
the correct way to satisfy dependencies. This is how *every* package
manager works.

Thanks

Norbert

What do you expect if you type "texdoc 1234"?

Recent versions of texdoc support fuzzy search and even return
something if there is a typo in the search string.

What I absolutely don't understand is why every invocation provides a
different result.  Yes, I can reproduce the behavior.

BTW, there is a dedicated mailing list for texdoc

   http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texdoc

but AFAIK Takuto is listening here as well.

Thanks, I understand, but also feel that the includernw latex package 
*.sty should itself test for a working R environment, and whether that 
environment includes the R knitr package, stopping if they are not found 
and issuing helpful instructions to the user. The Fedora packager 
might then have been less eager to lumber all texlive-scheme-medium 
users with a large and unnecessary dependency. Last year I was editor in 
chief of the R Journal (responsible for technical production of articles), 
and need precise control over workflow components in this capacity. The 
invasiveness of this upgrade is really shocking.

No, not every. The R package manager (so the R code in this latex package) 
advises limiting the number of dependencies (Depends, Imports) as far as 
possible, and moving everything else into Suggests, which are checked at 
run time, not install time. A user then finding an unfulfilled dependency 
at run time is at liberty to install the missing workflow components, but 
is never left without a choice by the packaging system.

So "correct" has many flavours. I will try to trace the Fedora packager, 
and follow up with the author of includernw, who certainly did not ask for 
the latex package to be rolled out at least to all texlive-scheme-medium 
users on Fedora.

Hi Roger,

I have read now both your answers, but still tap in the dark with what
you want to achieve and what is your actual problem. Your descriptions
are a complete mixture of nomenclature.

I don't know what you are talking about, honestly.

The latex package you are refering to does *NOT* contain any package
manager facilities. I calls R on some code which calls
"library('knitr')".

You are mixing completely different things here: depends, suggests etc
are entities of the fedora packaging, and have nothing to do with the
latex package.

Upstream (other of includenrw) has no influence whatsoever what fedora
packager are doing.

Again wrong. includenrw is included in TeX Live. And the Fedora
maintainer has packaged TeX Live and thus also includenrw.
There is nothing wrong, and if at all, then it is in your handling of
how you install R packages and manage them.

It is *you* who has to decide whether you want to use the fedora
packaged versions of R pakcages, or locally isntalled ones.

BTW, I know what I am talking about: I am TeX Live developer, at the
same time maintainer of TeX Live in Debian, and do quite a lot of work
with R. So trust me, it is in *your* obligation to keep a workable
environment.

If you start installing local R packages you take the control intio your
hands, but also the responsability to have all the necessary tools etc
installed.

Don't blame either the author of includenrw or the fedora maintainer for
problems.

Best

Norbert

As I have come to understand it, the problem is that Fedora

installs R together with texlive-collection-mathscience because of

includernw.sty, due to it's dependency on R and R-knitr.


However, Roger does not want to use includernw, and has R installed

(in a non-conventional location on his computer). This leaves Roger

with two R installations and a .sty he doesn't use.


Am I correct, Roger?

And? Is disk space the problem? If Roger has his installation say in
	/opt/R/bin
	/opt/R/lib
and the Fedora packages will probably install into
	/usr/bin/R
	/usr/lib/R/...
then, if the version in /opt/R/bin is in the front of the PATH, it will
be used and will not - unless explicitly told to - use the packages of
Fedora in /usr/lib/R

This is the very same case with TeX installations by the packaging
system and the original from TUG. Setting up the PATH correctly solves
these problems.

If it is the disk space, then Roger can take a similar approach as
explained for Debian and TeX Live in
	https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
under
	Integrating vanilla TeX Live with Debian
one needs to create a dummy packages the tells the package manager (rpm
in Roger's case) that there is a full R installation available.

But this is only necessary when disk space is scarce, what in the case
of R should make a huge difference.

Yes, correct. And this is simply from upgrading texlive, so nothing that I 
have opted into (apart from installing texlive-scheme-medium).

The best, in many cases, is not to depend on the version installed by the
package manager of the distribution. In my case equal use fedora 29
(updated 28 to version 29). This works for me:
1. Remove all packages related to texlive installed by dnf
2. Execute the following lines
  $ sudo dnf copr enable fatka/texlive-dummy
  $ sudo dnf -y install texlive-dummy
If it fails for some reason, manually download and install
"texlive-dummy-9999-4.noarch.rpm"
3. Download and install the official version of TexLive 2018 from
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
4. Prepare a coffee (or several) ...wait...wait...done.
This has always worked for me in relation to TexLive

Really? Why should the user of the system have to accept a gratiuitous 
install of about 100MB for just R itself, and perhaps 50MB is additional 
unneeded packages without asking for them? How may the user know in 
advance that extraneous dependencies have been added? Why then should that 
user have to work out how to block extraneous installs of duplicate 
software, and to do that before anyone has been told it will be required? 
I do not think this is responsible packaging, it looks much more like 
mission overreach.

Please tell me where to go to get includernw de-listed from 
texlive-collection-mathscience and texlive-scheme-medium. Who maintains or 
curates these lists, where may issues be raised?

Thanks for keeping with me.

As still partly responsible for the technical production of the R Journal, 
and for maintenance of multiple R packages (themselves with many reverse 
dependencies), I really do not need my workflows disrupted.

Nor had I noticed that "texdoc" had a list of its own (a thousand
apologies).
In windows the situation is a bit different, besides showing different

throws

Well, that is the discrepancy that always will happen when you rescind
work to others, in this case the packagers.

You can set up your own slackware Linux, and install every single
package by hand. Then you can select *exactly* what you have installed.

But if you leave decisions to others, by using a distribution, the
distribution rules apply, even if you don't like them.

One of the rules most distributions have is that if you install a
package it is ready to use, and necessary dependencies are installed.

And for *most* users this is the *correct* way (I stand by this!). For
those who want something else, they need to invest time and energy, like
doing equivs packages, installing things only by hand, whatever.

> that extraneous dependencies have been added? Why then should that user have

How should the packaging system GUESS what you have installed, and
whether it is in the right version etc etc.???

Sorry, you obviously have absoutely no idea about what the work of
distributors comprises, and instead of asking politely where to ask and
what to do, you are criticizing people who do an incredible hard work to
ship you a ready-made distribution.

I ask you a last question: Did you install a desktop environment, like
KDE or GNOME?

If yes, did you select *each*single*necessary* library and sub-program
that is necessary for it to run? 

I guess you didn't. And there are for sure many packages installed (like
tracker, or zeitgeist, or whatever) that you maybe not know about and
never use.

And, did you complain?

It is only because you have your special setup that passes the
distribution packaging, and expect that distributors can conjure up some
magic that automatically agrees with your policy.

Please, get down to earth, and appreciate the work distributors, and
that includes us as TeX Live team, as well as all those doing packaging
work for Linux distributors, are doing.

We told this to you already several times, it is Fedora. Use whatever
bug report mechanism is there. I don't use Fedora, I don't know, but
surely they have a bug tracking database.

> dependencies), I really do not need my workflows disrupted.

AGAIN!!! If you set up your stuff correctly, your workflow IS NOT
disrupted, because the R installation *you* have installed is found
first. If it is disrupted, then your setup is broken.

Thanks

I accept that packages are rule makers and those installing packages are 
rule takers in general.

I'm only questioning this particular case, as I'm convinced that, after an 
R.core installation triggered by a dependency in includernw on R-knitr and 
its R package dependency, trying to build the latex in R chunks in the Rnw 
file will fail, because they in turn try to load other R packages that are 
not available.

Yes, the includernw latex package can run its own example, but that is 
about its limit unless the user already has an R installation.

I've bowed to your position as rule maker and mine as rule taker and used 
PATH to avoid finding the spuriously installed R version.

Hi Roger,

> rule takers in general.

It is a necessity. Consider the average linux distribution with about
20000 packages or more, where R is just a very small part of it.
One needs rules that govern the package usability.

This is then a packaging bug. If the maintainer wants to ensure full
functionality, the dependency on R-knitr needs to pull in either
directly or indirectly everything necessary for running at least a
minimal document (I don't say it needs to pull in everything that might
be possible at all under any conceivable situation, though!).

If even the most simple case of document cannot be compiled after
installation despite installing parts of R, this is a bug of the package
and should be reported to the maintainer.

> I've bowed to your position as rule maker and mine as rule taker and used

That is not my rule. That has been the rule since the conceivment of
Unix, long before I was born.

OK. I also see that say texlive has internal dependencies between 
components, like R. R has > 13000 contributed packages on CRAN, and almost 
3000 more on Bioconductor, and we've been very concerned to prune reverse

It passes this test (loading knitr), but almost any workflow will need 
other sets of packages, depending on the R code in the Rnw document being 
processed (which cannot be known before run time).

OK, my unix admin certification is from Sperry in 1985 (2MB memory, System 
V). At the time, EMACS really did mean Eight Megabytes And Constant 
Swapping.

Thanks for your patience,

CRAN is in a very good situation due to its very strict rules concerning
upload format. CTAN is older and has historically very loose rules,
which CTAN does not want to change now. That means, we have practically
no way of testing.

Alone converting CTAN packages to standard TDS standard as used in TeX
Live (and MikTeX and any other TeX distribution I know) is a crazy task
(see our ctan2tds script), which requires hand-work for each and every
package.

(I sometimes *DREAM* of the level of consistency CRAN has when seeing what
is shipped on CTAN and we need to incorporate)

> if some functionality is inhibited. We do this to permit nightly

That is something impossible on CTAN level. I am working on doing
something similar on TeX Live level, but this, too, is a very bad task
due to the variety of engines (latex, pdflatex, platex, lualatex,
xetex, uptex, ......) that might be necessary to actually run a test
fileusing a certain package.

That is fine. Maintainers cannot and should not cater to any possible
usage at all. I (putting my Debian maintainer hat on) often tell people
that with only texlive-base installed, they can compile simple TeX
documents, but nothing more. But this is it. If they want more, the need
to install texlive-*-recommended etc etc.

Hi,

> Truthfully, I expected it to throw a "no-found-nothing" error

If you want to disable the fuzzy search feature, you can set

	fuzzy_level = 0

in your own texdoc.cnf. Please see the documentation for the details.

The reason that Texdoc gives different results for each invocation is that
the program selects the final result randomly from the candidates which have
the same Levenshtein distances to the (mistyped) input keyword; this is
because it is impossible to decide the best one in those candidates.

On the other hand, I heard this issue for the first time. It seems that this
problem is NOT related to the fuzzy search feature.

I examined a bit on my Windows PC and found that a "Too many argument in
command line" error always occur for `texdoc 2up`. Is this the problem you're
talking about?

Best,
Takuto

Ok, the truth is that I rarely touch the configuration files :)

ok I understand the behavior, but, the list that you select should be
constant and
only the chosen file should be random. Here I leave the output provided by
windows

I just referred to that problem, excuse my English, my computer is in
Spanish (my native language).
I must clarify that after the last update this problem seems to have
disappeared...

This may sound like a request, but, the behavior to enter a wrong word
(badword) could be
First: List the files that BEGIN with "badword", sorted from the shortest
length to the longest (or some other criteria).
Second: List the files that DO NOT BEGIN with "badword" (that only continue
it), ordered by some criteria.
Third: If you do not find anything that matches "badword" to show the
classic error of not found, look in ctan.
Similar to the behavior of the fedora package manager $ dnf search "badword"
Greetings and thanks for your great job

I guess that comes from texdoc selecting a package from the list at
random, and then presents the documentation files for that package.

That means although the list of packages considered is constant, the
list of documents shown then change due to the nondeterminstic selection
of one package.

My ideas are:
- offer the list of package names and let the user select, then show the
  doc files
- show doc files of all packages in the list

Not sure which is easier/better to do.

It's exactly how I visualize it in my mind. Actually, it would suffice
to show the list
and then exit texdoc, as user I rewrite the correct name and texdoc
selects the correct
file following some predefined order package(?- doc).(pdf | ps | dvi),
README(.?md | txt), etc.
I assume that if any documentation does not follow this rule ((I
really do not know if it's a rule),
the author will give notice to the maintainers and place custom-doc in
the correct list to show by texdoc.

The truth is that it is difficult to determine ... but, for me it is a

Hi herbert,

can you please run
	tlmgr update -v arydshln
It will be a bit of output, but would help.

It is very strange that there wasn't an error during decompression, but
then tar broke.

So maybe there is a broken tar somewhere?

    Could \pdffilemoddate be changed to always us the "Z" time zone if
    SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set?

I committed changes to pdftex (r808) and tl (r49145) for this. It won't
show up in native TL until the 2019 release, though some distros may
pick it up soon. Thanks for the suggestion (and to Akira for sending me
the basic patch.)

I took the opportunity to add a check for kpse_in_name_ok on the found
filename, too. (This needs to be checked in other pdf* primitives, and
also done in other engines.) --karl

is there a simple option to make XeTeX (or rather xdvipdfmx) not embed
fonts in PDFs?  I'm going to post-process the output, which will do
the embedding.

Subject: [tex-live] Query about 'tar' and some windows/linux scripts
Message-ID: <CANeU4n8dNexrrjhG=5xdKEeadwc-rt3wXczzm0TiRjhTX_0CRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, a couple of questions (only with the intention of
improving texlive, not criticize):

1. The latest update of Win 10 (October) has installed by default
"tar" and "curl", for future versions of TeXLive, is it possible to
detect the windows version or detect if "tar" is installed in the
system? , to avoid installing it twice :)

2. I know that in the directory
"/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive" there are proper scripts
and necessary for the operation of "texlive", my queries are as
follows (full texlive installed 2018 in win10pro x64 , without cgywin,
as in fedora 29 x64)

when going through the directory in both systems the outputs are:

% fedora
/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive
[pablo at fedora texlive] $ ls
allcm.sh         fontinst.sh   rubibtex.sh          texlinks.sh

[pablo at fedora texlive] $ ls

allneeded.sh     kpsetool.sh   rumakeindex.sh       tlmgrgui.pl
dvi2fax.sh       kpsewhere.sh  rungs.tlu            tlmgr.pl

fmtutil-user.sh  pslatex.sh    texconf.tlu          var

my questions are the following:

a) Are the ".sh" scripts needed in windows (without using cgywin)?
b) "uninstall-win32.pl" script is necessary in linux? (in windows
perhaps the correct location would be /texlive/2018/tlpkg/installer)
c) What is the correct format of the NEWS file? (It's a mix between
plain text and html apparently)

The best

Pablo

Hello,

for me the reason of your question isn't really clear: How much space do 
you intend to save? If you sum up all possible deletions, it might be a 
few MB. Considering that currently a GB of hard disk space is available 
at less than 5 cent, you might be off far better by considering, which 
parts of TeXLive your really need. The whole installation fits on a DVD.

The second point is, that there are several versions of e.g. tar around 
and it could lead to strange problems, if for example the installers for 
TeX-Live require some option, which the system-tar doesn't accept. 
(Gnutar is a quite sophisticated version of tar.)

Kind regards

Alois

I understand your point of view, I think using the tools of the
operating system (if they are available) is the best. In the specific
case of "tar" is based on "bsdtar" (http://libarchive.org/) and "curl"
is taken directly from (https://curl.haxx.se/) ... and a couple of
more megas or a couple of megabytes less ... even with the capacity of
current disks ... it always makes a difference

In the past i installed several development tools and each of them
installed ots own curl. I wrote an application requiring curl and it finds
one of them although I am not sure, whether the one found is compatible
with the one used when compiling the application. GNU tar is even more
difficult because its options do not require dashes which need not be the
case of a non-GNU tar. I can imagine that the result of using randomly a
tool of an unknown source will be a set of weird errors. If curl and tar
were supplied by Microsoft as a default part of Windows, it could be under
control. However, a volunteer can write a TL package which will thoroughly
test installed curl and tar and then decide whether TL must install its own
versions or whether the already installed versions are compatible. Hoewver,
such a package can be larger than curl and tar. And now imagine that such a
package finds compatible curl and tar and decides to use it. A user later
finds that a tool containing curl and tar (eg. some compiler) is no longer
needed and just takes disk space, thsu he or she uninstalls it, curl and
tar disappears from the system. TL will then become unupdatable, it will no
longer be able to download its own curl because it needs curl to download
anything but cull will not be available.

Yes, but, it's a file less than updating ... that's advantage

> @Zden?k Wagner..."If curl and tar were supplied by Microsoft as a default part of Windows, it could be under control"
To this I mean precisely ... according to
(https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2017/12/19/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/)
will now be an integral part of windows, I assume that the developers
of this operating system take them seriously.
On the other hand, if total compatibility between systems is desired,
nowadays it is possible to use WSL and install a reduced version of
"debian" for example and have access to "tar" and "curl" to check
compatibilities.
Anyway, it's just an idea ... (I know curl is a problem, for some
reason TeXLive still uses the classic wget)

I keep my Windows 7 updated. I have just tried "tar --help" and the system
found GNU tar, not bsdtar. In addition, I have 7zip which should probably
be able to cope with the *.tar files but I have not tried.

In fact it does, just like the GNU tools installed using mingw.

Yes, that is correct :). In the source hierarchy, consider it to be

Another point is that TeX Live has to support other versions of
Windows as well.  Using programs shipped with TeX Live makes
maintenance much easier.  Treating different versions of Windows
differently would add a lot of noise to the scripts.  And everything
has to be tested thoroughly.

Hi Pablo,

many have answered already, here a few more points:

The tar on Win10 is useless. Our code at some point actually preferred
the shipped tar, but that ended in tears. It is a bare bone boring
bsdtar that does not support the necessary options.

And even if, we still need to install tar since we might install on Win7
systems where there is no tar available.

Summing up the scripts size is about less then one photo from your
digital camera or mobile phone ... are you serious about stripping that
down?

No, that is too much work just for the brain damaged Windows system to
which we already have to dedicate a huge amount of special code.

As above.

You're right, after writing here review the comparative with GNU tar

I really thought about using "sh" instead of using "perl" (or Lua) for

I think I'm one of the few curious users who look "almost" at all
TeXLive directories ...

Hi Ulrike,

> https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/460247/xelatex-doesnt-work-in-texstudio

I read through the issue there, and it seems that
	it works on the terminal
but 
	breaks in texworks

I can only imagine that there is a difference in invocation. I have
tried several documents on the command line and all of them worked, so I
am not really sure what texworks is doing.

Best

Subject: [tex-live] Neo4j and TeX Live History
Message-ID: <20181116182107.GD7668@bulldog.preining.info>

Dear all

I have now completed (but not finished) an import of each TeX Live
Database (texlive.tlpdb) since 2009-05-24 till today into a Graph
Database (Neo4j).

Represented entities are
- TLPDB
- TLPOBJ (so call TL Packages, that is what you install via tlmgr)
- TLPSRC (the source of those)
- Files (all files contained in a package)
- dependencies between all TLPOBJ (depend fields in tlpdb)
- contains: which TLPOBJ are contained in which TLPDB
- includes: which Files are contained in which TLPOBJ

Please see
	https://github.com/TeX-Live/tl-neo4j
for a bit more details. There is also a read-only access to this
database at
	 http://texlive.info:7474/browser/
with user name and password both being "neo4j"

Just to give you an idea what can easily be done:

Find the packages with the highest number of updates over these 9+
years:

	match (tlpdb:TLPDB) --> (p:TLPOBJ:Package)
	with p.name as pkg,count(DISTINCT p)-1 as updates
	where updates > 0
	return pkg,updates order by -updates

This returns the following list, cut off at 100 updates:
	pkg 		updates
	bidi 		185
	dvips 		172
	tex4ht 		152
	context 	134
	siunitx 	133
	xepersian 	125
	pstricks 	110
	newtx 		104
(here I restricted the search to TL Packages of type "Package", this
excludes "Context" packages as well as "TLCore" packages. The absolute
"winner" in terms of package updates is
	texlive-docindex	1810
	texlive.infra		945
	...

All the best

Norbert

Hi all,

if this is the case, it can also be a matter of different environment
setting and/or different PATH for the termina, and GUI. This is probably
the most frequent reason of such problems in Linux.

Hi Werner,

      https://ctan.org/pkg/extractpdfmark

I considered this when it came in, but it requires compilation. I'm not
enthused. Since it already uses automake, it probably would not be hard
to adapt into TL, but everything takes time. If you or anyone else would
like to look into it and send me a patch including it, that would be
nice. Otherwise, maybe I'll get around to doing it eventually. (It also
seems plausible for distros to provide it.) --best, karl.

Or a failed/corrupted download. If that a2ping.tar is still around
somewhere, you could try to untar it (with the Windows tar.exe we
provide) by hand. Or maybe you have a GNU tar.exe in your Windows path?!

As far as I can see from TLUtils.pm, function untar(), we run
  tar xmf foo.tar 
on Windows, and just
  tar xf foo.tar
on Unix. This should be maximally portable.

Norbert, I'm not sure about your comment about other tars not
supporting these options. Any tar must support "xf", or it is not tar at
all. And since it's our own tar.exe [normally] being used on Windows, we
know "m" is supported.

Zdenek, I'm not sure about your comment about some tars not supporting
dashless options. tar originally and has always had dashless options. It
is -options (dash) which some tars might not support, and of course
--options (double dash) are completely unportable, essentially assuming
GNU tar. Which we do not do.

At least such is my understanding ... --karl

the SVN that integrates a similar package into TeXLive?  I agree that
it shouldn't be too hard since it doesn't have complicated
dependencies.

Indeed, but TeXLive already contains some useful tools for PS and PDF
manipulation, so I think it would be useful addition.

The last source/utils/ package I inserted was axodraw2. I doubt I
managed to incorporate it in a single commit, but svn log might report
something. Every package is different. --best, karl.

Hi,

No, shouldn't be:

THis is ours and should be fine.

What surprises me more is that:
>   'xz' => 'xz'

Do you have a program 
	xz
installed in your Windows somewhere.

This is also shown here:

So it seems that you have an outdated xz.exe somewhere, please check
that.

The unpacking is not the problem, the making of the backup archives
before an update.

Anyway, the problem is with xz, I am highly confident.

I'm not sure. In the comments it sounds as if it breaks also on the
terminal, but not for every file. Some unknown file seemed to work,
but with sample2e it broke: "when i type the command: xelatex
sample.tex in terminal, ... " 

But if he really mixed binaries from different version than probably
nothing can be done anyway. 

Btw: The segfault is at the place where on windows I would expect
the recreation of the font cache (if xetex detects new fonts).

Mumumu, not very helpful without an actual test case.

Yes, that is what I expect.

There is another item, that was fixed like 2 days after the first
release by uploading a new version of texlive-bin: luatex 1.09
from current svn is just borked wrt to context (or the other way round,
hard to say, anyway, luatex breaks backwards compatibility from 
1.07 to 1.09, which is IMNSHO a really stupid thing). I uploaded 
a new version of texlive-binaries that reverts to 1.07 of luatex,
so it *might* be that there something involved with luatex, but
since it is a *xetex* issue, that sounds more like a stupid theory than
reality.

Can you tell me in which way it broked compatibility? 

(miktex updated to luatex 1.09, and it will be in the next texlive,
so any problem should better be handled as soon as possible ...)

Hi,

sorry for abusing the list.

I don't have access to Ubuntu/Debian TeXLive packages,
but I need to know if file at bottom of this
will be compilable to PDF via pdflatex with

texlive-lang-cyrillic

and

cm-super-minimal

>From compiling it on my Mac OS I see it embeds subset
of 

sfrm1000.pfb

(et al.) fonts in PDF, which are listed

at 

https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/all/cm-super-minimal/filelist

but I don't know what will happen for \Large:

I expect it to need sfrm1440.pfb

I see at link above that there is a file

/usr/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/cm-super/cm-super-minimal-x2.map

whose contents I don't know as the file does not exist at my

/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cm-super

I wonder thus how \Large and \small will work out on
a system having only texlive-lang-cyrillic and cm-super-minimal

I do understand I am abusing the list here, but I am no Ubuntu nor Debian user
myself and don't know where I would raise the topic, if I had been such
a user.

I am only trying to know if document next requires cm-super
or can go through with "cm-super-minimal"

Please be merciful,

Best,

the pdf has embedded partially Type-1 fonts such as cm-super/sfss1440.pfb

Problem is, those files are not listed at 

https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/all/cm-super-minimal/filelist

It might be though that when Ubuntu user has installed only cm-super-minimal

the

/usr/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/cm-super/cm-super-minimal-x2.map

will make do with only sfss1000.pfb even for Large ?

(after all those are scalable fonts)

This is what I can't test...

Ah. context. Yes, context and luatex are like the biber/biblatex
combo: When you update one side you should update the other too.

Indeed! OK, motivated by your mail

- I discovered that Mac OS X offers "ar" command (ar -x for extracion),
  thus I downloaded cm-super-minimal_0.3.4-9_all.deb and
  executed ar -x on it in a working repertory

- then ar -x on data.tar.gz

(later on I discovered I could simply hit RET in an Emacs buffer)

This allowed me to examine the cm-super-minimal-x2.map file,
to see the contents or the README you are quoting and then 
to examine the type1ec.sty file which has very clear header

% Copyright 2002 Vladimir Volovich
%
% Put \usepackage{type1ec} before \usepackage[...]{fontenc}
% in order to use CM-Super EC/TC/LH fonts at arbitrary sizes.
% To reduce the output PS or PDF file size, use \usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}
% (that will use only 10 pt fonts scaled to any desired size).

This entirely solves my problem, thanks a lot!

That file ends only with \input{t1cmr.fd}, but it has defined
\EC at family, which is used also in x2cmr.fd

So indeed the X2 encoded font definition will also use the ???000.pfb
files only from cm-super-minimal

Yes, but those are the TFM files. 

The Type-1 font files (.pfb) actually making their
way to PDF need to be there available.

Fortunately option 10pt of type1ec achieves what one wants, also for Cyrillic which was my main concern

Sorry for noise, and more importantly thanks for help,

Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

Hi Werner,

I think there are no such an option to make xdvipdfmx not embed
all fonts.

Hello!
I do

I have already rerun the installation multiple times and each time it fails on a different file.

Is there a solution?

Well, I expected that this does not happen on updates from 
	1.07 to 1.09
, but seemingly context/luatex developers have a different attitude
towards software engineering than me.

I'll forward it to our system administrator, because I am only

Subject: [tex-live] New installer GUI
Message-ID: <20181119142131.GA1321@bitmuis.nl>

For the 2019 release of TeX Live we intend to provide a new GUI
front-end for the installer. By now, it could benefit from wider
testing.

Just add a parameter '-gui tcl' to install-tl or to
install-tl-windows[.bat] and you shall see the new GUI rather than
one of the old ones.

The Windows .exe installer has gotten a fourth option 'Experimental'
which also invokes the new GUI.

The new GUI uses the Tcl/Tk scripting language.  This is a standard
component of Mac OS. For Windows, a runtime is provided. But
Linux/Unix users may have to install something. e.g., on
Debian-based systems, 'apt install tk' should pull in everything
needed.

Localization: The Dutch localization is mostly complete. For other
languages than English or Dutch, be prepared to see a mixture of
English and native text strings.

Interesting

Loading it works fine. And I can test to the simple installer.

If I click the advanced button, the window disappears, the programme is still running, there is an icon for it, but no windows.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit

(I might need to install more Tcl stuff)

Splendid (and much welcomed) news, Siep.? But one question, if I may ?? When you say "Just add a parameter '-gui tcl' ", presumably you are speaking of adding this parameter to the TeX Live 2018 installer, since (as far as I know) the 2019 version is as yet unannounced.? And can the parameter also be added to install-tl-advanced, which is my installer of choice ?

Incidentally, in order to remind myself where I had installed TeX Live 2018, I typed "kpsewhich xetex.exe"; kpsewhich returned nothing, not even with the addition of "-must-exist".? I finally had to ask it to search for "x.tex", since I had no idea which files it might (or might not) be able to find.

You should not need anything extra, but which version do you have of
Tcl/Tk?

  kpsewich is not by default configured to look for binary programs;
searching for a TeX file you know will exist in the distribution, such
as plain.tex and hyphen.tex, is the expected way to do it.

Tcl mode is available now.

The only thing that install-tl-advanced.bat does is invoking
install-tl-windows.bat with a '-gui perltk' parameter. The tcl gui
has a button 'advanced' which opens up (almost) all the
configuration options. I am not sure what would happen if you added
two -gui paramters.

Amazing, thank you very much :) :) :),
and a bunch of roses to the Netherlands.

On my Mac it works like a charm.
OK, I first had to reinstall Tk via MacPorts to use quartz by default,
but it worked under X11 as well, and I tested it under the default Tcl
later as well.
I didn't know that Tcl apparently doesn't yet support high resolution
displays, but that's ok.
It would make sense for someone with the black background & 10.14 to test it.

Some minor feature requests and bug reports:
- My personal feature request would be the ability to specify the
precise path to `wish` (and honour that one if/when present).
- Collections cannot be resized.
- Main window can be resized, but when resized towards smaller
dimensions there's no scrollbar on the bottom or on the right, the
layout gets messed up in vertical direction and inaccessible in the
horizontal one.
- The schemes window is initially too small to fit all the translated
strings. If shrinked, items become inaccessible.
- Making "installation root" too small is also somewhat problematic.
- When I click the red cross on "Installation root" to close it
(instead of clicking cancel), I get "Error: can't read "wnd": no such
variable" and I cannot close the window.
- Clicking the red cross to close the main installation window is also
not handled in a proper way (I cannot even exit the program then,
other than forcing the close).
- Instead of "Select all" and "Remove selections" buttons in
Collections it would be more natural (similar to how other software
works) to have a checkbox in the header to achieve the same, but
that's a super small priority. One could then also only disable
languages, or only other collections.
- "Portable setup" could have a checkbox rather than a button with long text.

(I assume that so far we only have an installer, no updater yet.)

Again, thank you very much,
    Mojca

A debugging option or a log might be useful.

Note, the only thing I did was to rsync tlnet, and tage the Linux installer from it. It created a folder with todays date, so we ought to be ok

Ooops, I mixed `tl-pretest' and `texlive-svn': sorry for the noise. With
the right one, UI plugin tcl is found.

Some remarks:

1. The first window is by default too much chunky (see [1]).
2. It would be nice for the text strings that appear to be copyable (in
   order people can more easily report troubles).
3. The text strings are a mixture of English, indeed, and German
   strings: is it what you mean by native ones (I expected native ones
   to be French ones :)
4. I guess the text strings translations would be similar to the
   previous installer so we won't have to translate them again.
5. For the moment, I must admit I don't see the benefit compared to the
   previous installer.

Hello there,

Our red hat repository doesn't contain the following packages for latex:
Adjustbox
Collectbox
Ucs
Tabu

Is there any way to get these four packages.

Thanks,

I can reproduce such a messed-up window if I resize the window. I
could set it to non-resizeable. Is this by any chance a HiDPI display?

I do not think that is possible for labels and buttons.

You can explicitly specify a language with a '-lang fr' parameter. I
do not know why tcl thinks that German should be the default
language on your system.

The new GUI reads the same .po translation files as the old one, but
there are a lot of new or different strings.

I don't think so: I guess it is 1920?1080.

Too bad.

Nice! And, BTW, the first window's sizes are then okay by default.

OK, I rsynch'd the current TeX Live installation suite while eating 
dinner, and have just launched "install-tl-windows -gui tcl".? There 
were a few oddities (it appears to ignore <return> as a completer, 
requiring an explicit click on a button instead) but then I hit a major 
problem ? I cannot see where to configure the locations of the TEXMFVAR 
and TEXMFCONFIG directory hierarchies. With the previous installer I was 
able to configure these as X:\TeX\Live\<Year>\TeXMF\Config & 
X:\TeX\Live\<Year>\TeXMF\Var ? how should I accomplish that with the new 
one, please ?

Hi,

Unfortunately it seems the TeX Live on Fedora/Red Hat is dead. Nobody is
caring for it, the latest version is 2012 or so, and it is declared as
orphaned.

In this case, I recommend installing TeX Live from TUG, please see

That should, of course, have read "the locations of the TEXMFSYSVAR and 
TEXMFSYSCONFIG directory hierarchies" as I now see when running the 
older "install-TL-advanced" in order to be able to configure these.? 
Nonetheless, I would still like to know how to configure these locations 
using the new installer.

Not supported by now. For this, please use the text mode or perltk
installer.

Not sure (it is rather harder to find information on-line abot Fedora/RH
packages than Debian/Ubuntu ones)
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/texlive/overview/
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/texlive-base
suggests that Fedora ships more or less "fresh" texlive.

Here on Archlinux these packages can be found in package
'texlive-latexextra' but on Fedora these are
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/texlive-adjustbox
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/texlive-collectbox
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/texlive-tabu

INdeed, but that is hard to find. I searched for Fedora and TeX Live and
texlive and got only rubbish .. very strange.

Hi all,

I have Fedora 28 (released in May 2018, I had no time to upgrade to the
latest stable 29 released a month ago) and it seems to have TL 2017. I use
TL from TUG, TL from Fedora is installed due to dependencies and because
the disks are large nowadays and I know how to set PATH, I do not care.

Yes, that was/is the problem. a xz.exe from 2011. Now we must see
if we can simply replace that old version with a new one.

I did not anticipate that anybody would want to mess with these. Of
course, I should have anticipated that you would. So I have to
decide whether that is a good enough reason to put it in, since
there are alternatives, as Norbert explained.  I do not want to
overload users with rarely-used options.

If anybody else on this list thinks these options should be
included, please speak up.

I do have 10.14. There, HiDPI works fine with the built-in Tcl/Tk,
but dark mode is ignored.

What about letting the wrapper code inside install-tl check for an
environment variable WISH? You can also invoke the tcl installer
directly with a wish of your choice:

<your_wish> <installer_root>/tlpkg/installer/install-tl-gui.tcl

In the tcl case, the initial invokation of install-tl just serves as
a simple wrapper which hands control over to tcl, which in turn
invokes install-tl as a backend process. This may change in the 2019
release.

I'll address some of these points in the next update.

I opted for a button just to have yes/no in the middle column.

Actually, I am putting some finishing touches on tlshell, but this
got interrupted by the feedback on the installer. Stay tuned.

Dear Siep ?

> I did not anticipate that anybody would want to mess with these.

With respect, not "mess with".? "Configure".? There is a considerable 
difference.? These have always been user-accessible configuration 
options, and I have been consistently exploiting this feature for at 
least a decade.? It would be really nice if the location of 
TEXMF(SYS)DIST were exposed in the same way, so that there could be just 
one TeXMF root.

I fully accept that you may not wish to expend time implementing a 
feature that you do not anticipate others will use, and if you choose 
not to implement it I will, of course, accept your decision with good 
grace.? But I do not believe that you would be "overloading" users were 
you to offer the option to configure these locations ? you would, I 
believe, simply be meeting their expectations that a new installer will 
offer at least the same options as the old one, if not more.

We cannot replace the "old" xz.exe, because it is the same
version as the one if installing MinGW, which is used by others
here. We have many hundreds of computers which are managed from a
central system, so changing old things is always an option with
very low priority.

However, is there any possibility that one can force tlmgr
to search first in its own directories for binaries?

What/Where did you download the files? There should be

install-tl-windows.exe
and
install-tl-windows.bat

part of your download.

Did you consider http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html?

I tried to search for the solutions on Google, but all of the ways are not effective. Many people said that i should add C:\Windows\System32 to the system variable path, but i tried and found that it doesn't make any difference on my computer. I have no choice but to report this bug to you and i strongly hope that you can give me a little help to address the problems with your professional knowledge and experience. Thank you for your time!

It is a problem in the order of "PATH" in windows. Two possible solutions
1. Reorder the "PATH" line in "environments and variables" to place
texlive before mingw
2. Open a "cmd" with administrator's permissions and go to:
C:\texlive\2018\tlpkg\installer>
then execute tl-cmd.bat and then update.

Subject: [tex-live]  TeX versions
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1542753507.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

Recent postings on the tex-live list asked about versions
of TeX (or TeX Live) on certain O/S distributions.

To better answer that, I put together a file that I plan to
maintain that records TeX versions in the many systems in 
our software test lab.  Here it is:

% cat texlive-versions.txt
This file collects TeX distribution versions for VENDOR-PROVIDED
implementations (independent of the annual TeX Live YYYY releases) for
approximately 200 physical and virtual machines in the software test
lab in the math.utah.edu domain.

The names in the first column are a distribution name and version
number, with dots elided from the latter, so as to obtain a single
token that often suffices as a hostname.

For example, 

	  431 == 4.31
	10136 == 10.1.36
	   mw == Milky Way
	   rh == RawHide
	   rr == Rolling Release
	
With rare parenthesized exceptions, the CPU platform is x86-64 or x86.

In three cases (fedorarh32, void32, void64), the numbers mean instead
the address size in bits (x86 vs x86_64).  solaris1032 is 32-bit
Solaris 10 on x86.

The designation n/a (not available) indicates that a TeX package is
not provided by the O/S distribution, or it is available, but package
conflicts prevent its installation, or it needs other software that is
not installed on that particular system.

Alpine Linux, Apple MacOS, DragonFlyBSD, Microsoft Windows, MirBSD,
Minix, and Sun/Oracle Solaris appear to have never had TeX in the
vendor binary package system.

For MacOS, the commercial TeXtures (now defunct) and the free MacTeX
(part of TeX Live), have long supplied TeXware.

For Solaris, the OpenCSW (Community Software) distribution provides
TeXware for SPARC, x86, and x86-64 CPU architectures.

For Windows, there have been several commercial implementations
(MicroTeX, PC-TeX, TurboTeX, Y&Y TeX, ...), as well as free ones
(emTeX, TeTeX, TeX Live, ...).

Totally agreed. The text mode is the ultimate tool for all settings. 
GUI should cater to good UX.

SOrry, not by now. Give me 1-2 days and it will be possible to
set
	TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN=1
to force TL to prefer the version of binaries shipped by TL.

There is a possibility to have a button "Advanced settings" which will
open a popup
dialogue with rarely?used options. But this is just an idea...

I have committed changes to TLUtils.pm:
--- a/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm
+++ b/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm
@@ -2348,6 +2348,18 @@ sub setup_programs {
   my ($bindir, $platform, $tlfirst) = @_;
   my $ok = 1;

+  # tlfirst is (currently) not passed in by either the installer or
+  # tlmgr, so it will be always false.
+  # If it is not defined, we check for the env variable
+  #   TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN

+      debug("setup_programs: TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN is set!");
+      $tlfirst = 1;
+    }
+  }
+

So if you set
	TEXLIVE_PREFER_OWN=1
in the environment (for installer and tlmgr), then those programs
shipped by TeX Live are prefered over those from the system.

The installer will be upated probably today already, after installation
the texlive.infra will still be old and you need to install from 
tlcritical.

Best

There is already a button for that ;-) but the advanced settings there
do not exhibit TEXMFSYS*

More specifically, a button 'More...' between the TEXDIR and
TEXMFLOCAL rows.  But I would still want a better reason than Phil's
sense of aesthetics.

The primary argument I would adduce is "for compatibility with the previous installer".? The functionality has been exposed for so long (well over a decade, I believe) that users will expect it to be present. Adding functionality is good and to be encouraged; removing functionality, if there is no good reason for so doing, is not.

I don't think that it is necessary in a GUI too set this.

Phil,

AFAIR the default GUI on Windows is the wizard installer which does not exhibit any variable but the base location.

The good reason is reducing clutter.

VThen I really urge you to use the text-mode installer. There, you
can configure even more subdirectories:

===============================================================================
Directories customization:

 <1> TEXDIR:       /usr/local/texlive/2018
     support tree: /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist

 <2> TEXMFLOCAL:     /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
 <3> TEXMFSYSVAR:    /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-var
 <4> TEXMFSYSCONFIG: /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-config

 <5> TEXMFVAR:       ~/.texlive2018/texmf-var
 <6> TEXMFCONFIG:    ~/.texlive2018/texmf-config
 <7> TEXMFHOME:      ~/texmf

 Note: ~ will expand to $HOME (or to %USERPROFILE% on Windows)

See how much raw power you have been denying yourself by using a GUI
installer!

Ah, but it doesn't expose TEXMF(SYS)DIST, so it's not really offering any advantage over the existing GUI interface ...

There is no TEXMFSYSDIST, and we never allowed for configuration of TEXMFDIST in any installer.

So what are you trying to do??

Root TEXMFDIST, TEXMFSYSVAR and TEXMFSYSCONFIG in a single location :

??? X:\TeX\Live\<Year>\TeXMF

i.e., X:\TeX\Live\<Year>\TeXMF\Dist, X:\TeX\Live\<Year>\TeXMF\Var, X:\TeX\Live\<Year>\TeXMF\Config

I can (with the current GUI installer but not the new one) accomplish the 2nd and 3rd of these but not the first.

TEXMFLOCAL is already rooted at :

??? X:\TeX\Live\TeXMF

i.e., X:\TeX\Live\TeXMF\Local

I have no idea what TEXMFVAR and TEXMFCONFIG might be used for, but I have never found any reason to install anything in either of them, so I have never needed (or wanted) to configure their locations.

Philip, we would be *extremely* glad if you could reduce the clutter and
do *NOT* send HTML emails. They are nothing but a PITA. Thanks.

One hastens to oblige, whilst quietly observing that if you were to migrate to a more modern operating system such as Windows 7 and adopt a more modern e-mail client such as Seamonkey, you might find HTML e-mails not only less of a PITA but actually of some benefit when seeking to communicate (for example), stress, foreign words, bulleted or enumerated lists, etc.  One is also inclined to observe that cluttering up one's e-mail signature with pointless noise such as 

> GPG: 0x860CDC13   fp: F7D8 A928 26E3 16A1 9FA0 ACF0 6CAC A448 860C DC13

is not really an outstanding example of "good practice".

Dear Philip,

I recommend you to leave the TeX world and fully embrace Adobe or
Microsoft products, so that your enjoyment of flashyness, shininess,
and miles of mouse movements are not hindered by one of those
old-fashioned text mode stuff like TeX, mutt, or text emails.

And by the way - concering foreign words - I am typing this in my text
mode mutt email client, and it contains 
- deutsche W?rter mit Umlaute
- ??????
but if you want, I can send you Russian, Tibetan, Italian, Sanskrit,
whatever, nothing of this is tied to HTML.

Welcome to the new world of text processing - you might need some study
session.

Footers in emails, since the inception of email, have been separated by
double dashes, as I do. Good email programs (not the one you use) strip
of these signatures automatically. But your ignorance of GPG and the
importance of encrypted communication is not surprising.

Enjoy

Yes, but they were not italicised, as at least the first (German) should have been when embedded in what is primarily an English language text.

Completely pointless sending them, then ? I rest my case.  Incidentally, as the author of "Janet_mailshr" (written in the mid-80's), I believe I may claim some small familiarity with e-mail protocols, but not (of course) with protocols that originate in Usenet news [1]

I think that people should be taught to return to the roots, they
should understand the meaning. Font changes should be used for stress,
not just for showing the words from other languages. Typographical
beauty of books is yet another topic, it makes no sense to format
e-mails as books.

This is not just a mail protocol. I can easily claim to be Norbert
Preining, generate the key pairs and sign the mails and other files.
There is no certification authority for GPG, you must obtain the
fingerprnt by an independent channel. The public key can be signed but
it does not have the same strength as web servers certificate. Thus
you can receive a mail signed digitally by Humpty Dumpty, his public
key will be signed by Mock Turtle, Cheshire Cat, and Mad Hatter, but
how can you know who really sent the mail if the sender e-mail address
is forged and you cannot match the key fingerprint to a person you
know?

Web of trust. It is the old - very old - discussion between whom you
trust more: a central authority (hoh hoh, breaches of CA have been far
and wide) or a web of trust (this guy's key has been signed by a guy I
know!).

I prefer the later one, I prefer non-centralized single-point-of-failure
security. You say that "web server certificates are stronger", which I
strongly disagree.

Simple question: which software release is signed with a ssl certificate
instead of a pgp/gpg certificate? At least in the OSS world I don't know
of any.

Message-ID: <20181124113153.GB1815@bitmuis.nl>

I uploaded some changes to the installer tcl GUI mode, which should
now be available from most mirrors.

- @Mojca: you can now specify preference for a particular wish with
  a WISH environment variable, except on windows, which always uses
  the supplied tclkit runtime.

- The Close buttons got suitable callbacks

- @Lars Madsen: an environment variable dbgui=1 causes some extra
  lines of output to be written to the terminal, each starting with
  'dbgui:'. Does the advanced menu still fail to show up? If so,
  what dbgui output do you get? And is wish mostly idling or using a
  lot of cpu time?

I am still working on correct resizing and on the collections
dialog. In the meantime only the log window is resizable, and a bug
where translation was not taken into account has been fixed.

Hi Norbert,

everything was fine except the problem that we had to go first
into the directory of xz and then update tlcritical. Otherwise
the same problem appears ...

Only an idea: could an option in the tl gui itself be better
instead of setting an environment variable??

thanks Pablo,

Norberts change with the environment variable works fine.

Should be fixed as of today since we pushed out tlcritical to tlnet, so
every new installation should automatically react to the env var.

You mean tlmgr gui? But then installation would fail, which is not good
either. And we would have to add an additional option for the installer,
which is also not really what we want.

Or do yo suggest that the tlmgr gui has an option to globally set this
env-var? I am not really sure that I understand what you propose.

some users do not know the meaning of an environment variable and how
to set one.

Forget my thoughts, everything is fine now ...

Thanks.  I'll dive into the code to look for more details.  If
ghostscript is going to be used as a post-processor, such a feature
could be really beneficial.

BTW, who is responsible for xdvipdfmx coding today, and where should I
discuss related issues?

Hi Siep

Advanced is working fine now. I have no issues (though haven't tried installing anything)

I like the 3 part interface for specifying the target dir, that's quite nice.

One feature request: Some way of getting back from the advanced state to the simple state (mostly for exploring)

I uploaded some changes to the installer tcl GUI mode, which should
now be available from most mirrors.

- @Mojca: you can now specify preference for a particular wish with
  a WISH environment variable, except on windows, which always uses
  the supplied tclkit runtime.

- The Close buttons got suitable callbacks

- @Lars Madsen: an environment variable dbgui=1 causes some extra
  lines of output to be written to the terminal, each starting with
  'dbgui:'. Does the advanced menu still fail to show up? If so,
  what dbgui output do you get? And is wish mostly idling or using a
  lot of cpu time?

I am still working on correct resizing and on the collections
dialog. In the meantime only the log window is resizable, and a bug
where translation was not taken into account has been fixed.

Message-ID: <524299d4-a0dc-14c9-9430-34db9ababdd9@gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

it seems that the new file blxextdoiapi.lua of biblatex-ext got 
installed into ./texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex-ext/. That file provides 
a runtime Lua module that is called from a .sty file and so it should 
live in a directory where it can be found, I assume 
./texmf-dist/tex/latex/biblatex-ext/ would be a better fit.

Please move blxextdoiapi.lua from the doc directory into where it can be 
found as a runtime file.

Is there anything I as the package developer could do to avoid these 
kind of confusions over the correct place for a file in the future 
(short of uploading a TDS zip to CTAN)?

As the new TCL/TK installer doesn't expose TEXMFSYSVAR and 
TEXMFSYSCONFIG locations, I used the original installer when trying to 
install TeX Live from home and ran into the following problems (none of 
which are related to TEXMFSYSVAR/TEXMFSYSCONFIG) ?

1) I downloaded the full installation repository using Rsynch to 
C:\TeX\Live\2018\Repository
2) I tried to install using install-tl-advanced.bat and was told 
(paraphrase, not at home as I am composing this) "Inadequate 
permissions"; changing ECHO OFF to ECHO ON disclosed that this occurred 
at the point "call "%~dp0install-tl-windows.bat" -gui perltk %*"
3) I invoked "install-tl-windows -gui perltk" by hand (which succeeded) 
but then found that it was trying to install from Oxford rather than 
from my local repository.
4) I consulted the documentation and found that it inconsistently 
described the format of the "repository" qualifier, some places stating 
that it was to be preceded by a single minus sign and some by a double.? 
I tried both, as in :

  * install-tl-windows.bat" -gui perltk -repository .
  * install-tl-windows.bat" -gui perltk --repository .

and it barfed on both.? Only :

  * install-tl-windows.bat" -gui perltk -repository
    C:\TeX\Live\2018\Repository succeeded.

Could anyone shed any light on these problems, please ?

Yes, full path is better.

I'll defer to your judgement and that of the other experts on that one. 
As long as the file is found I'm OK with anything that makes sense, but 
I notice that for fontspec we have 
./texmf-dist/tex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.lua and for microtype 
./texmf-dist/tex/latex/microtype/microtype.lua

I would have to either roll back any advanced choices or decide what
to retain. I fear such a feature would only lead to confusion.

By the way: the latest revision, from november 24, does again allow
more resizing.

Finally managed to work around this by re-ownering the "Repository" 
hierarchy to Administrator, then granting full access to Administrator 
(including "execute" permission, which is I think what was lacking) to 
all files therein and thereundeer.? It appears to be installing now.

Hi Siep,

Le 26/11/18 ? 16h36, Siep Kroonenberg a ?crit :

> By the way: the latest revision, from november 24, does again allow
> more resizing.

Here on Linux Mageia 6, I can't resize any of the boxes (either
normal/advanced), in any way (neither maximize nor with the mouse).

Some remarks:

1. "Normal" box:
   1. IMHO, the box such as "Installation root", displayed as follows
      (ascii art):
     ?????
     ?         /usr/local        /        texlive        /        2018
     ?       +-------------+          +-------------+         +-------------+
     ?       |  Browse...  +          |   Change    +         | Toggle year +
     ?       +-------------+          +-------------+         +-------------+
     ?????
      could be confusing, especially for beginners: this way of choosing
      a directory is quite unusual.
   2. Some of the boxes can be closed thanks to the `Esc' key (e.g. the
      "Warning" one when "Toggle year" is clicked), other can't
      (e.g. "Directory name" when "Change" is clicked).
   3. "Installation root" ? "Toggle year" ? "Yes" makes the year part
      empty, which isn't what I expected by "toggling" the year.
2. "Advanced" box:
   1. Same remarks as 1.1 and 1.2.
   2. The 1st "Change" button opens a box that contains (as above)
      a "Browse..." button. The "Specify directories" as well, but with
      lowercase "browse...".

All the best.

I would agree with that; the user should (IMHO ) (be able to) either 
type, or browse to, the desired location in a single dialogue box.

The problem is that any GUI (including Tk) is able to navigate to
existing directory only. If a user installs his/her first TL, then
/usr/local exists but /usr/local/texlive does not. If a standard
dialogue is used, a user must first type texlive to create
/usr/local/texlive, navigate to it, then type 2018 to create
/usr/local/texlive/2018 and then select it. Alternatively the standard
dialogue can be abandoned and a single text input used. If a user
types texlive/2018, the 2018 subdirectory can be created under
existing /usr/local/texlive or the whole directory structure can
directly be created in a single step (by calling mkpath) if there is
no /usr/local/texlive. I do not want to judge which approach is better
but a combination of these two will IMHO lead to higher confusion.

Is that invariantly true, Zden?k ?? I have no experience with portable 
GUIs, but the native Windows GUI supports "New folder" (i.e., "create 
new directory") functionality in its "Browse to location" interface and 
has done so for as long as I can remember.

It seems, you didn't read Zden?k's message carefully enough: The user 
would have to create several directories.

Maybe the best resolution to the problem might be, that you contribute 
the absolutely best installer, maybe even another TeX-distribution.

    Please move blxextdoiapi.lua from the doc directory into where it can be 
    found as a runtime file.

Thanks, done for tonight.

    Is there anything I as the package developer could do to avoid these 
    kind of confusions over the correct place for a file in the future 

1) Add a note in the README. But even more likely in this case, with an
already-extant package:

2) When adding a new runtime .lua (or other "nonstandard"-extension)
file to the package, include a note about it when you upload to CTAN.
The CTAN people are good about passing on such notes to Christan and me.

Thanks for all,
Karl

P.S. By "nonstandard" I mean that .sty, .cls, .?bx, code.tex, .ldf,
etc., etc., are all included in the runtime by default, so there is no
need to worry about them. (ref: $standardtex in tlpkg/libexe/ctan2tds.)

I can't install .lua by default because .lua files are often supposed to
end up in different places, e.g., for scripts, or just for doc building, etc.

I took that as a given.? But that is just routine, is it not ?? One uses 
"New folder" to create (e.g.,) a directory "TeX" immediate under "X:\", 
then uses the GUI to move to X:\TeX and uses "New folder" to create 
"Live" (thus creating "X:\TeX\Live") and so on. This is something that I 
do a very regular basis, possibly even daily.

    ghostscript is going to be used as a post-processor, such a feature
    could be really beneficial.

FWIW, here is a post describing how to unembed fonts (I haven't tried
it myself):
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/89864

So perhaps you could let (x)dvipdfmx do its thing, then unembed and do
whatever you want after that.

    BTW, who is responsible 

Primarily Shunsaku :). Also Akira.

    for xdvipdfmx coding today, 

FYI, xdvipdfmx and dvipdfmx have been the same program for some years
now, thanks primarily to Khaled. There is only one source directory.

    and where should I discuss related issues?

There is no mailing list specifically for dvipdfmx (or most other
drivers). Maybe we can use tex-k. --happy fonthacking, karl.

The method works fine.
An attached removefonts.zip contains

noembed.txt:

In final.pdf all embedded fonts in xtst.pdf are removed.

Of course, this way you could also create a directory 
X:\T\e\X\L\i\v\e\2\0\1\8 ..., but it is quite nasty. With the current 
system you can just choose the home directory and let the installer 
choose a proper substructure, which you also can overwrite, without 
changing too much between keyboard and mouse.

Alois

Thanks to the TeXLive team for setting up such a valuable and 
comfortable system!

Alois, I do not? understand your point.? I responded to Zden?k querying whether his assertion that "any GUI (including Tk) is able to navigate only to an existing directory" was universally true.? You suggested that I had not read Zden?k's message carefully enough, and went on to say "the user would have to create several directories".? I explained that I had taken this as a given, and gave a trivial example.? You are now responding with a far more complex example that I cannot believe that you (or anyone) would us in real life.? What exactly is your point, please ?

The basic and advanced windows are not resizeble: shrinking would
corrupt the layout, which is already shrink-wrapped, and expanding
serves no purpose.

The selection lists should now mostly be resizable.

I have encountered many selection dialogs which did not make clear
whether they would install under or in the selected directory. I
wanted this to be unambiguous. Also, the TL installer is special
because there are two levels to create.

The previous solution was manually specifying the entire string in a
text box, which was not ideal either.

Added to my TODO list

What would you expect? Or can you suggest a better button text?

A more realistic example: Assume, you would like to install your TeXLive 
in SpecialDrive:/SpecialDir/TeXLive/2018. Then you could just navigate 
to? SpecialDrive:/SpecialDir and Copy the directory name into the first 
part of the installer mask (or also type it in.) No need for further 
input. If you want a different structure than TeXLive/2018, then you can 
just type it there, but I wouldn't see any advantage for that.

With your approach you would at least 3 times have to click "New 
Directory" and type in the name there; every time you need to change 
from mouse motions to keyboard input.

Maybe like you, I find much more convenient to use only the keyboard as
far as possible. But a lot of users, for instance my students, would
probably find much more convenient to click 3 times on "New Directory".

In French, it is common to have longer sentences than the corresponding
English ones: will the windows sizes be adjusted to the translated
strings?

Another point: I personally prefer the window I'm currently working on
to be maximzed in order to not be disturbed by other windows.

OK, and they are so shrinkable that at the end you don't see anything :)
But I don't see any reason to forbid this for the main basic and
advanced windows.

Mmmmmhhhh, I'm not sure it is now clearer. The directory structure
displayed as a tree view would be less puzzling, but I'm must admit
I don't know whether Tcl allows it or not.

In fact, I don't understand what "toggle" means here: between which

Dear Siep,
when I invoke the TCL installer, a window showing the TeX lion pops up
for about a second.  I'm aware that it's blasphemy, but doesn't it
make more sense to omit this window if it's displayed only for one second?

Regards,
  Reinhard

It is the loading time of the tlpdb, which might take longer depending
on the mirror and connection time. Instead of giving no reaction to the
user a so called flash screen is a good idea.

Yes, it will even adjust on the fly. Picking e.g. another scheme,
and the width of the window will probably change.

This is not necessarily true for list-like widgets, for which a
width (and height) can be specified. Instead, I have made such
widgets resizable.

I have to think about that.

The full path is displayed along the top. I could make it more
prominent with some extra vertical space above and below.

But 'toggle year' is maybe not the best phrasing. Add year/Omit year
may be better, the button text switching appropriately.

Norbert already gave a good answer, but, by way of a data point: on
my system, with a local repository on an old-fashioned hdd, it
already takes several seconds. And on a windows virtual machine,
using the same repository via a virtual network connection, I have
more than 10 seconds to admire the TeX lion.

I don't see what you mean.

Indeed.

Another remark: the different buttons can be reached (i.e. have focus)
with the TAB key but:

- the order is a bit strange,
- none of them is "clicked" when they have the focus and the RET key is
  hit,
- when the drop down lists have the focus, nothing special is displayed
  (unlike the buttons which have a dotted box),
- when the checkboxes have the focus, a zero width dotted box is
  displayed at their right side.

Subject: [tex-live] pdfstartlink/pdfendlink and boxing level problems
Message-ID: <1awxebpztmwa3.dlg@nililand.de>

After some discussion in the latex team I have two questions about
\pdfstartlink/\pdfendlink in pdftex (\pdfextension startlink/endlink
in luatex) and boxing levels.

1.
Currently the commands give a fatal error if used in different
boxing levels:

x\hbox{\pdfstartlink
    attr {/Border[0 0 1]}
    user{
        /Subtype/Link%
        /A<<%
         /Type/Action%
         /S/URI%
         /URI(blkub)%
         >>%
        } Linktext}  
\pdfendlink

\bye
! pdfTeX error (ext4): \pdfendlink ended up in different nesting
level than \pdfstartlink.
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

This doesn't happen very often in documents, but if the galley is
split and reboxed it is possible that long links end in different
levels. One example involving two column mode and top floats has
been discussed on the latex2e github:
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/94

Is the fatal error really sensible here? Couldn't the engines close
the last annotation with some more or less sensible coordinate and
continue with a warning? A pdf with a wrong link area seems better
than no pdf at all (and would release the format and packages from
the need to carefully keep track of boxing levels when splitting and
reassembling stuff).


2. The engines interrupts linking if the boxing level of
intermediate text is less than the boxing level at the start of the
link:

x\hbox{\hbox{\pdfstartlink
    attr {/Border[0 0 1]}
    user{
        /Subtype/Link%
        /A<<%
         /Type/Action%
         /S/URI%
         /URI(blkub)%
         >>%
        } Linktext}}
  not linked
  \hbox{still not linked}
\hbox{\hbox{more Linktext\pdfendlink}}

\bye

This allows to some extend to exclude e.g. header and footer from
link areas. But doesn't work e.g. with fancyhdr which adds an
additional box level to the footer. xetex/xdvidfpmx has here a quite
useful special \special{pdf:nolink} which can be used to suppress
the unwanted link area:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\cfoot{some longer text that should not be linked}
\usepackage{ifxetex}
 \ifxetex
  %\cfoot{\special{pdf:nolink}some longer text that should not be
linked\special{pdf:link}}
 \fi
\usepackage{hyperref}

\begin{document}
\vspace*{48\baselineskip}
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
\href{xxxxx}{link link link link }
\end{document}

Would it be possible to add to pdftex/luatex something similar?

Hi Ulrike - for pdftex: your suggestions seem reasonable to me on the
face of it, and I don't see any immediate compatibility stoppers. But
implementing them is not something I am likely to ever get around to :(,
and I doubt Thanh has time these days. Maybe you or someone else would
be motivated to write the patches (+ docs + test cases)?

For LuaTeX: if no replies are forthcoming, you might write the
dev-luatex list. 

Thanks,
Karl

Thank you, Mojca for this interesting and clear explanation.  I tend to
roll my eyes and eat chocolate when people start talking about licenses,
but you make it seem clear and sensible.

Thanks!

Dear Werner, Karl,

> In final.pdf all embedded fonts in xtst.pdf are removed.

I copied open type fonts into Resource/CIDFont of Ghostscript:
KozGoPr6N-Bold,
KozGoPr6N-Medium,
KozMinPr6N-Regular,
SourceHanSans-Heavy.

Note that I removed the suffix .otf from the filenames.

I could embed fonts again into the final.pdf by a command
gs -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
-sOutputFile=xtst2.pdf final.pdf xtst.ps.

(Actually gs is gswin32c since I'm on Windows.)

pfffonts xtst2.pdf
showed

name                                 type              encoding
 emb sub uni object ID
------------------------------------ -----------------
---------------- --- --- --- ---------
QJJKMJ+KozGoPr6N-Medium              CID Type 0C       Identity-H
 yes yes no      23  0
QQKGCN+KozMinPr6N-Regular            CID Type 0C       Identity-H
 yes yes no      19  0
HOTETC+KozGoPr6N-Bold                CID Type 0C       Identity-H

SEWZDA+SourceHanSans-Heavy           CID Type 0C       Identity-H
 yes yes yes     11  0

The fonts are subsetted, but
(size of xtst2.pdf) / (size of xtst.pdf) = 7.26.

It seems that the subsetting of open type fonts
in (x)dvipdfmx is much better than in Ghostscript.

Best,
Akira

For me this happens on two quite new notebooks with Win10, both have 
installed TeXLive.

Is the problem known and is there maybe a fix for it?

(In Linux I encountered problems with the new gs 9.25, with doesn't 
cooperate with my favorite viewer, the outdated gsview 4.9; so I keep an 
older gs 9.22 at these notebooks in order to be able to further use 
gsview 5.0; I cannot use the new one.)

Best wishes

Ah good. So you don't see a reason for the fatal error either?

Well I can't, that's outside my sphere ;-) But perhaps we can find
someone.

I did it, but don't know yet if it ended in the gmane nirwana (while
writing to lists where I'm already on works fine, new lists are
quite a problem, perhaps I need to get first the list in a "normal
way" before I can use gmane with it.)

Message-ID: <a04420c4d84a1ea9974d2f48cdc1a49e@uni-eszterhazy.hu>

Hi everyone,

In the latest version (2.3) of the thesis-ekf class, the following files 
are incorrectly installed in the doc/latex/thesis-ekf/ folder:

eszterhazy-logo-en.eps
eszterhazy-logo-en.pdf
eszterhazy-logo-hu.eps
eszterhazy-logo-hu.pdf

These should be moved to the tex/latex/thesis-ekf/ folder (see README 
file). These files are used by thesis-ekf.cls.
Additionally, doc/latex/thesis-ekf/ folder contains an empty 
thesis-ekf-templates/ folder that should be deleted.
For the new version, these templates no longer need it.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Tibor T?m?cs

In the case of the present Ghostscript 9.26,
I obtain a different error on Windows 7:

**** Unable to open the display device, quitting.

I found that the message is a fatal error message
in idisp.c in Ghostscript.

Thus I suspect that the psv is not compatible with
the Ghostscript 9.25 and Ghostscript 9.26.

Best,
Akira

Thank you very much for your response!
I just tried out the psv-version from TeXLive 2017 and obtained the 
message below.
In case of the problems between gs 9.25 and Gsview 5.0 I thought, that 
it is just a case of an old program like Gsview not being updated. 
(Ghostscript itself works fine, but it seems to me, that there is passed 
somehing from GSview to gs, which blocks the proper search for the 
resources.)
In this case I assumed, that psv would be actively maintained and such a 
behaviour should have be detected quite soon; so I am still not sure, 
that the culprit isn't somewhere in the setup of the computer. (In my 
case the culprit most of the time sits in front of the computer.)
Can anyone use a recent version of psv without problems?
With kind wishes
Alois
