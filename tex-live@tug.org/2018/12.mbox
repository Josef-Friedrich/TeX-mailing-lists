The Windows version of Gsview 5.0 works with gs-9.25 and
with gs-9.26 by the following setting:

(1) Uncheck Options--->Safer
(2) Add -dSAFER in
    Options--->Advanced Configure...--->Ghostscript Options:
    instead of Options--->Safer

Best,
Akira

The above refers to a gs binary compiled with COMPILE_INITS=0.
If compiled with COMPILE_INITS=1, the Windows version of
Gsview 5.0 works with the default setting.

Ah, two consecutive hyphens ? I rarely think of that.? I tried all four of "/?", "-?", "/h" and "-h", but none helped.? OK, so I can now build the format; how, please, do I persuade it to save the format file under TEXMFLOCAL and not the (very obscure, and somewhere I would never think to look) default location ?

??? probably you can set the output direction but since the default
isn't obscure at all, it just uses the current directory, I'd just
move it afterwards.

like all commandline arguments in web2c based texs you can use one or
two hyphens, --ini or -ini are the same thing.

But it wasn't the current directory at all :? it wanted to write to c:/users/philip taylor.fujitsu-pc/.texlive2018/texmf-var/web2c !?

This if fmtutil/mktexfmt which rightly writes to TEXMFVAR (or
TEXMFSYSVAR if you use the -sys (or --sys) switch).

If you run the xetex -ini (or --ini) manually, you get the format in the
current working directory.

You might want to read the man page (yes, as in "man page") of fmtutil.

There, the switch
	-fmtdir (or --fmtdir)
is mentioned, which describes where the format is saved.

I really need to get rid of TEXMFVAR; the last thing I want TeX doing is writing things under c:/users/philip taylor.fujitsu-pc/.texlive2018 ...

True, as David has kindly pointed out, and as I have confirmed in practice.

This is the directory (among others) where where kpathsea looks for
format files.  This directory is used when format files are created by
fmtutil/mktexfmt and in particular when format files are created
on-the-fly.

If you say

  xetex &texip

then kpathsea notices that there is no file "texip.fmt" on your system
and calls fmtutil/mktexfmt which installs generated format files in
either TEXMFVAR or TEXMFSYSVAR.  This is the appropriate place because
people don't want to copy the format files to every directory where
they need them.

However, if you say

  xetex -ini ...

the format file will be created in the current directory because
fmtutil and mktexfmt are not involved.

I'm wondering whether a format file is required at all.  Isn't it
possible to just load the TeX source of the format file instead of the
format file itself?  You can state more than one TeX file on the
command line iff none but the last one contains \end, \endinput, or
\bye.

Does this work, Phil?  I suppose that you don't intend to change the
contents of the book but maybe you want to change papersize to A4.
Format files only make sense if you use a huge macro package
frequently.

Regards,
  Reinhard

put a file texmf.cnf into your TL root, and add there

It's a pity.  However, all Unix manual pages shipped with TeX Live are
available as PDF as well and accessible by texdoc.

In this particular case:

  texdoc fmtutil

You should always try texdoc first.

xetex -help does not offer -sys at least on my computer. Anyway, the
binary .fmt files are not generally portable and are not portable from
one year to another (they may be portable but you cannot rely on it).
this is the reason why you should have a specific .fmt for a specific
binary.

In fact, after alias person=man you have person as an alias, you can
also define alias woman=man and alias help=man and store it in your
profile so you can have whatever you like.

Hi Philip,

Yes, which calls mktexfmt which is an instance of fmtutil.
Automatic format generation is putting files in TEXMFVAR, that has to be
like this since TEXMFSYSVAR might be not writable, even on Windows with
admin install.

>    I have now tried using the "-sys" qualifier with XeTeX and see that it

Nobody told you so. The -sys works only for fmtutil and updmap.

>    is not recognised, and therefore "fmtutil" still tries to create a

Yes, this is correct and expected behaviour, and unchanged since Thomas
Esser introduced this distinction about 20+ years ago.

>    so it does not look (to me) as if on-the-fly format creation can be

Yes, it can, by setting
	TEXMFVAR
to the value of TEXMFSYSVAR or your preferred value in the texmf.cnf I
mentioned in my last email:

$ help what
bash: help: no help topics match `what'.  Try `help help' or `man -k what' or `info what'.

I never heard that "personalual" is an English word.

Hi Herbert,

I heard that problem for the first time.

Could you give me a detailed output with -D option?

$ texdoc -D auto-pst-pdf

I think you are right.

export PDFVIEWER=/usr/bin/evince
% texdoc auto-pst-pdf             
! SyncTeX Error : No file?

When I use /usr/bin/atril as pdf viewer then there is no error message.

My system is Fedora 29 and evince is 3.30.2-2.

it for some years).

Dear Philip,

please retry. It seems you have hit right between the updates of the
files due to the daily push out via rsync.

If you can reproduce this behaviour, it would be great if you could do
on the command line
	tlmgr -v update --list
and send the output.

Thanks

Norbert

Message-ID: <87a7lhv3ua.fsf@example.com>

Hi,

a student of mine had a quite irritating problem this morning when he
tried to install TL 2018 by running `install-tl-windows.bat' from the
`texlive2018.iso' file: its Windows 10 (Professional I guess) didn't
accept to run it and displayed the following message:

  ?????
  ? https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4456067/windows-10-switch-out-of-s-mode
  ?????

This student had to get the (hopefully with no charge) "Switch out of
S mode" program (or extension, or whatever) and to accept that
"[s]witching out of S mode is one-way" and that "mak[ing] the switch,
[he] won't be able to go back to Windows 10 in S mode".

I would be very surprised that the TL team would be able to make
`install-tl-windows.bat' become an app available in the Microsoft Store.
So this S(ecurity or hit?) mode will sadly refrain people from
installing TeX on their Windows computer...

All the best.

If you explain people (especially students) you want to introduce to
(La)TeX they have to renounce to their nice, new, fresh Windows 10 and
first install and switch to Windows 7 in order to install TeX Live,
I guess this people will instantly keep their old MS Word :)

BTW, I wonder the status of the MiKTeX installer regarding this S mode.

If I understand well, it is currently impossible to switch back to
S mode.

Hi,

I think that Microsoft Store requires paid developer's certificate
issued by Microsoft. I do not know its price and do not know how
frequently it must be renewed.

When was this **** introduced? I don't remember ever having switched out
of whatever mode, and I can install a lot of programs...

Well, I think this is a problem with 99% of the software. Most software
I use is not distributed via MS Store, and I guess this is generally so.
I think this is just a stupid dead-end of Microsoft trials.

I don't use Windows myself but I used to install TL on numerous
computers with Windows as OS and it's the first time I'm facing this
problem.

MS is trying to lock users into the MS Store by this. But due to the
limited software, most users will need to "leave the S-mode", which
makes it a useless complication.

  I take it you think there is currently no solution except for telling
users installing TeX Live ?please leave the S mode by doing this and
that??

As I understand, S-mode is a severely restricted mode, with
important parts of the windows api unavailable. A bit like what iOS
is compared to Mac OS.  I do not see how TL could be made to work in
such an environment.

Most probably. Maybe the certificate is not so expensive, but what
happens if TL is installed via net? Will the executables downloaded by
install-tl.bat work or they will just require leaving the S mode one
step later? In such a case the huge install files will have to be made
available via MS Store, i.e. everybody will have to download 4GB even
if he/she wants just plain withou documentation because th SSD in a
notebook does not have so much free space. I do not know...

Yes. What else can we do? Get TL into the MS Store ... good luck.

'ello friends,

This is the first time I hear of S-mode, so I decided to dig a bit. 
Found an Arstechnica quote that gave me shivers:

Uh-oh.

Hello,

MS has quite a long tradition in trying to kick competing systems out, 
so I am not surprised about this attempt.

There might of course be some circumstances, where one wants to be 
completely sure, that no foreign program lives on the computer. (Except 
security environments this might also be an option for people who fear 
the dark dangers in the internet. Of course, I would never advocate for 
something like that.)

I could imagine, that it is relatively easy to compromize a system 
running some TeX distribution; it contains a lot of programs and also 
allows dangerous practices, like running scripts to include graphics, 
which could maybe also do something else. I am very satisfied, that this 
is possible.

If one would place all restrictions on TeX, which a security advisor 
could think of, it would quite likely become useless.

I think, there is nothing, the TeXLive maintainers can really do. We 
could of course warn all consumers, that the S mode might not make them 
happy.

Best wishes

Alois

  I don?t think anyone is seriously contemplating that, I was more
thinking of having the installer script switch out of S mode itself,
maybe after a prompt to the user.  This is already considerably better
than having to instruct users to do it themselves.

I think enterprises and universities have been asking for this due to the
high
cost of dealing with Windows malware.   There is also the high cost of
systems
that can run native Windows compared to chromebooks that have become very
popular with schools due to the low cost.

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/s-mode>:

S mode is an evolution of the S SKU introduced with Windows 10 April 2018
Update. It's a configuration that's available on all Windows Editions when
enabled at the time of manufacturing. The edition of Windows can be upgrade
at any time as shown below. However, the switch from S mode is a onetime
switch and can only be undone by a wipe and reload of the OS.


MS has a FAQ which explains the limitations.  These include conflicts with
developer tools.   I  expect S-mode will be showing up on enterprise and
university
configurations of Windows 10.   It remains to be seen how such
organizations will deal
with the conflicts.

Not all apps witll run in S-mode, see: <
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/05/18/will-linux-distros-run-on-windows-10-s/
>

If your site policy requires S-mode you should look into front end apps
such as RStudio
and Jupyter where you have a workbook in a browser and the processing is
done on
some remote system, e.g., there is nothing to install on Windows.   Many
people are
already using latex via pandoc to produce PDF's using RStudio server.

Microsoft has lots of users with a wide range of use cases.  For large
organizations, they have conceeded the command line to linux and macOS.
Cost is the real driver: security conts real money in large organizations,
and so does Windows hardware.  For this market, MS needs
chromebook level systems.   The heavyweight  Edge browser is being
replaced by one based on Google's Chromium engine.

The TeX community has work to do to provide guidance to people who
must work with S-mode on low-end hardware.   See
<http://rtalbert.org/the-case-for-chromebooks/> for a LaTeX user's
experience
moving from a laptop to a chromebook.

the S mode isn't really aimed at readers of this list but I don't

an end user choice.

Even if it is  a user choice, if someone buys something like a surface
go with a locked down s mode operating system and no commandline
possibilities and very few possibilities for installing software,
telling them to disable s mode may not be the best advice if they
don't want a commandline, especially as they can't undo that change...

In many ways something like overleaf is a far more natural fit for
such a machine, and steering people in that direction may be a better
alternative than telling them to reconfigure their operating system.

I had no idea what "Overleaf" was/is, but Google kindly informed me.? 
Unfortunately it (or I) fell at the first hurdle ? at 
https://www.overleaf.com/register, it does not progress when the 
"Register using your e-mail" button is pressed.

I think we need to be negative if it is so much constraining.

In the LaTeX case, the commandline is often hidden by TeX IDEs. So
users may both want LaTeX and not want commandline

That's the point: too much constraining.

Except that, IMHO, Overleaf's editor provides too few features compared
to real IDEs, such as Emacs or TeXstudio.

Moreover, I guess the student who encountered this problem doesn't have
enough money for an Internet subscription with an Internet Service
Provider and has only a limited Internet access with his cell phone.

Subject: [tex-live] Announcement: tlshell,
	a replacement GUI for the TeX Live Manager
Message-ID: <20181208095808.GA3149@bitmuis.nl>

Tlshell is a GUI frontend for TeX Live Manager.

It is not exactly new, being already part of the 2018 TeX Live
release, but it is now sufficiently polished and complete for wider
testing.

Both it and the previously announced new installer GUI are based on
the Tcl/Tk scripting language and have been tested on Linux, Windows
and Mac OS *).

Windows- and Mac OS users do not need to do anything about Tcl/Tk,
but Linux users may have to install a package, e.g.  for
Debian-based systems:

  sudo apt install tk

French and Dutch localizations are fairly complete, but with most
other languages you will still encounter many untranslated strings.

Since the Perl/Tk module is rather problematic (obsolete, crashy), I
would like to drop it from the Windows tlperl installation for the
2019 release. This means that by that time Windows users will no
longer have access to the old GUIs.

Another alternative GUI is tlcockpit, which is based on Java.  And
tlmgr has a `shell' command, for text-mode interactive sessions.  It
is in fact this shell mode that made implementation of a separate
GUI frontend relatively straightforward.

*) i.e. tested on High Sierra and Mojave

Yes, it is often hidden by IDE but it is still a commandline program
which requires cmd.exe but this is explicitely forbidden in the S
mode. Thus the IDE can work if installed from the MS Store but TeX
will never run in it. A user will have to decide, either S mode or TeX
but not both. MiKTeX will have the very same problem.

There may be free services for running TeX, I think that TeXonWeb is
still free and has complete TeX Live installed but internet connection
can be expensive for some people.

Message-ID: <CANeU4n96O1tjTZmE4oDrTf=rbRk7Q5XyFFVaKkEJPyvNc5bSng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, I have a query related to "auxtrees" and how it works.
I have installed
TexLive 2018 (updated) in fedora 29, and I have two queries:
1. By running the next line show

[pablo at fedora ~] $ tlmgr --help | grep auxtrees
    conf auxtrees [--conffile *file*] [show|add|delete] [*value*]
        The subcommand "auxtrees" allows adding and removing arbitrary
        additional texmf trees, completely under user control. "auxtrees
        show" shows the list of additional trees, "auxtrees add" *tree* adds
        a tree to the list, and "auxtrees remove" *tree* removes a tree from
          tlmgr conf auxtrees add /quick/test/tree
          tlmgr conf auxtrees remove /quick/test/tree

I think instead of "delete" (show tlmgr: unknown auxtrees operation:
delete) I should say "remove"

2. To use "auxtrees" need "sudo" and the directories will be available
to all system users

[pablo at fedora ~] $ tlmgr conf auxtrees add /quick/test/tree
Cannot write to /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf.cnf: Permission denied

And here's my question: is there any way that "auxtrees" write only
for my, something like "auxtrees-usr"?
With some friends we are trying to write a small magazine using git,
and although we can use "$TEXMFHOME"
to place the files, it becomes a mess when several of us use the same
machine (with different accounts), it is easier, clone and add .

I fear that it's impossible to avoid users from being bothered.  TeX
Live never touches the operating system except Windows, where it
slightly modifies the environment.  This is harmless, especially
because these changes are done with care.  None of these changes have
an impact on any other program.

Switching out of S mode is a quite drastic step and shouldn't be done
by the installer.  I doubt that it's possible without admin
permissions.  Please also note that, as far as I understand, an IT
department can decide on which machine S mode can be turned off or
not.  This means that on particular machines TeX Live cannot be
installed at all.

If the installer is able to detect in advance whether S mode is
enforced, it should abort with a more meaningful error message than
just "permission denied".  I fear that this is all that can be done
and I don't know how difficult it is to detect S mode within a Perl
script.

Regards,
  Reinhard

As I read the docs, if I understand them well, perl will not even start
because it is not allwed in the S mode, so there seems to be no help :-(

Enterprises always depend on 3rd party software.  In my experience
they often refuse to pay for support and thus don't get any updates.
Since no software vendor is interested in registering old stuff at
Microsoft's AppStore, I'm sure that none of these companies can afford
"S mode".

Is this brain-damaged "S mode" the only way to make Windows secure?
IMO it's rather a declaration of incapacity.

Maybe we can add an alias to treat remove the same way as delete.

Yes and No.

Yes, by default it edits the global texmf.cnf.
No, because you can use
	--conffile /path/to/your/private/texmf.cnf
to edit the one you want to use.

See above. Use it with your 
	$TEXMFHOME/web2c/texmf.cnf
*should* work ...

That does indeed seem the most probably scenario.? But of course it is not impossible that a Perl vendor (e.g., Active Perl) will apply for (and gain) certification, so if the installer can use an already-present Perl then all is not necessarily lost ...

OK, it may happen but look at
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/05/18/will-linux-distros-run-on-windows-10-s/
posted some time ago by George N. White III which says among others

Just because an "app" comes from the Windows Store does NOT
automatically mean that it's safe & suitable for running in Windows 10
S. There are some apps that are not allowed to run on Windows 10 S,
including all command-line apps, shells and Consoles.
...
And of specific interest to readers of this blog, Windows 10 S does
not run command-line applications, nor the Windows Console, Cmd /
PowerShell, or Linux/Bash/WSL instances since command-line apps run
outside the safe environment that protects Windows 10 S from malicious
/ misbehaving software...

So even if perl gets into MS Store, it will not work in the S mode.

Probably not, MS provides its new installer for the store and I hope
it will be free as nowaday's installers are. However, TeX, Metafont,
MetaPost and all other parts of TL are command line apps, they will
have to be redesigned. Update will not be possible by tlmgr.
Everything will have to be different, so it will be a new distro TL-S.
I am afraid there is no manpower to do it.

I think there is no need to worry, the newer processors can run the
older code if you have the subsystem instaled. The 64-bit processors
are able to run a 32-bit code. They would also be able to run a 16-bit
code if a 16-bit subsystem were installed. It was available in Windows
2000 but then it was removed. 64-bit Linux distros do not have the
32-bit libraries as default but they can be installed if a user needs
to use older software which is not OpenSource. I even have a 32-bit
Linux installed in VirtualBox so that I can compile SW for old
computers and verify that it works. Of course, in some $n$ Microsoft
can decide to remove some system calls so the old apps will have to be
redesigned and the new system calls will not be available in Windows
7. This can happen but I am not afraid in processor incompatibility.
The worst problem is caused by other hardware parts, graphics,
printers etc. It may happen that drivers will now longer be available
for Windows 7 so users will be force to upgrade. I run my Windows 7 in
VirtualBox installed in Linux so I will always have compatible
hardware emulated by VirtualBox.

Some strings are not:

  Specific mirror, 
- translated: "Loaded" for the state of the "Default repositories"

When writing this I was referring to changing the line
conf auxtrees [--conffile *file*] [show|add|delete] [*value*]
for
conf auxtrees [--conffile *file*] [show|add|remove] [*value*]
when showing the documentation $ tlmgr -h

Dear Norbert, I think here I am a bit confused about how auxtree
works, In my mind, and without using sudo, I should be able to
configure the directory trees to search for them when calling
"pdflatex" for example, placing "auxtree" at the beginning of the
search. This is my experiment, the idea is to be able to load an image
from ~/ctan/lion/ using a file in ~/testaux/. This is the command
sequence that I used
[pablo at fedora ~] $ pwd
/home/pablo
[pablo at fedora ~] $ cat .bashrc
# .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
    . /etc/bashrc
fi

# Uncomment the following line if you don't like systemctl's
auto-paging feature:
# export SYSTEMD_PAGER=

# User specific aliases and functions
export TEXMFCNF='~/texmf/web2c:'

You could give me an instruction for "dummy novices" of how I can
achieve this by using "auxtrees" (without sudo).

a auxtree is a real texmf tree. That means that you need to follow
the TDS structure. If ~/ctan/lion is the root of the tree that you
are adding with auxtrees then your picture should be e.g. in

~/ctan/lion/tex/latex/pablo/lion.pdf

	files
Message-ID: <5c0c3c6a.1c69fb81.77840.b6b7@mx.google.com>

I installed TeXLive 2017 on a Windows 10 system  and am using TeXWorks. I use plain TeX coding and the XeTeX format. I have it working except that I have to include my macros and images  in the same directory as the source file I am working on in order for XeTeX to find them---obviously not acceptable.

 I am trying to get my macro and image files  into the proper locations. I have read through what I think are the relevant instructions in the Tex-Live manual but still having problems getting started.

Reading section 3.4.6 Integrating local and personal macros, it seem that the appropriate directory for my own macros  would be in ``TEXMFLOCAL (by default, ? %SystemDrive%\texlive\texmf-local on Windows).?? However, I cannot find this location on the system drive (drive C). 

According to section 6.1, Automatic path adjustment, ``No manual configuration steps are required.??  I figured that means during installation a TEXMFLOCAL ?tree? would already be set. If it is set, then all I would need to do put my macros into the appropriate part of the TDS tree, right? But I don?t know quite how to do that.

First question: what is the minimum structure I would need for TDS compliance? Ie., what goes after ?\texmf-local\? for the plain-TeX macros (targets of \input)  and what goes after  ?\texmf-local\? for the XeTeX-readable image files (targets of \XeTeXpicfile)?

Second question: what comes BEFORE the ?\texmf-local\? on my system? How can I find out?

I found a MikTeX Settings utility that lets me identify the location of registered root directories and let me add to them. But I am not sure what to add there, or if that is the appropriate way to do it.

Thank you for helping a beginner with startup problems.

According to <
https://www.pcworld.com/article/3212258/windows/windows-10-s-review.html>,
S-mode will be preinstalled on some low-end systems that target students.

S-mode smells of a desperate move to counter inroads by chromebook
in schools, so it is not about "most users", but more the hope that the
numbers
of school users will increase.  It could also be popular for call centers,
payroll,
finance, hospitals, real estate and legal offices, etc. that suffer during
World
Cup football and Olympics when employees slurp up malware.

It is a fact of life.     Readers of this list probably won't choose
S-mode, but may encounter it when students or colleagues
show up with chromebook-class Windows systems.

 I don't recall seeing a "System Requirements" section in the
TL installation pages, perhaps because, until now,  few
current systems couldn't support some configuration of TL.   If
Microsoft is successful at making inroads into the Chromebook
market, some warning that TL can't be installed will be needed.
https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26009 mentions options,
either a web-based TeX system or by installing a linux distro.
It would be helpful to have a section on chromebook-class
systems with pointers to web-based TeX systems.

Large organizations that provide S-mode systems will not allow
users to disable S-mode, install linux, or otherwise defeat the
restrictions.

Think of the MacBook Air users who use LaTeX to prepare documents
while away from their office.   Much of this work involves basic editing
and writing and could easily be done using a web-based system such
as Overleaf.    Web-based tools like Overleaf can be used on cheap,
lightweight systems with longer battery life than MacBook Air.  If your
system is damaged or stolen you can be back to work faster and at
lower cost.   You don't have to install MacTeX and your recent edits
are saved in the cloud.   For many people that alone is worth the cost
of a web-based tool like Overleaf.

The systems that S-mode targets don't make sense without full-time
connectivity.   I understand there have been problems for low-income
students using chromebooks but only have internet access using their
school's wifi.   Some of those students do find a way to have linux on
an old laptop that is considered too limited to run current Windows
versions so costs less than a chromebook.

ProTeXt is based on MiKTeX, not TeX Live.  So you've read the wrong
documentation and MiKTeX certainly doesn't provide a directory
C:/texlive.

It's better to ask on the ProTeXt mailing list:

  http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/protext

An alternative is to install TeX Live because you're already more familiar
with TeX Live than with MiKTeX. ;)

BTW, the TeX Live installer creates a TDS compliant set of empty
directories in texlive/texmf-local.  This is quite helpful in order to
determine the appropriate directory for a particular file.

With all the drawbacks of these web-based TeX systems mentioned by
Stefan on the page above.

I'm training each year more than 100 students to LaTeX and, for
a substantial proportion of them, it is complicated at least to install
(if not to use compared to word processors). If they will be facing this
extra difficulty, I guess most of them won't want to give LaTeX a try.

If they have an Internet connection and, if so, if it is good enough.

Other ways of storing files on the cloud are possible
(e.g. Dropbox). But okay, it is an advantage of web-based TeX systems.

Installing MacTeX is the simpler and faster way of TeX Live.

I agree that, if an alternative to local TeX Live installation is
needed, it is probably the best one. But I'm agree with Stefan for all
the drawbacks of such a solution.

In our university, the wifi is a nighmare...

If you explain to students that, in order to use LaTeX (sometimes they
have no sympathy for it at a first glance), they have to resell their
current S-mode Windows computer for an old laptop on which they must
install Linux and learn how to use it, before learning how to use LaTeX,
they will merely laugh at you and will give up...

I fully agree. But is it realistic in view of the large number of

Thank you very much, that was the information I needed, now I know how
it should be (more less) the structure
of the project in git and the instructions needed for the participants.

The problem is that cmd.exe is not allowed in the S-mode and all
executables in both TL and MiKTeX require cmd.exe. There are lots of
other SW tool that rely on PowerShell and they will have the very same
problem, so I think that people will soon complain.

I understand that security is a problem for banks where there must be
strict rules what can be installed and what cannot, the IT people
should be very paranoid but why normal users should be that annoyed?
Windows have good security features even without the S-mode but they
are not used and the default, which is never changed, is the
"dangerous mode". The security could be improved without annoying
users by too restrictive S-mode if they wanted to care.

As the minimum, Windows should not just report "permission denied",
the message should say "not allowed in the S-mode" or something like
that

Hello,

it's certainly not that dramatic: They can keep their computer and use 
it for the possible purposes.

But one could tell them, that it will be impossible to run a lot of 
useful programs on it.

It's then up to them to decide. Quite likely, a considerable number of 
them will avoid LaTeX. But I would bet, that most of these would quite 
soon quit using LaTeX also for other reasons. As teacher you can tell 
your students, that the documents produced with Word are really ugly and 
a pain to write and read. But if the students are not willing to follow 
your advice, it's up to them. I wouldn't regard it as really bad for the 
community to loose those students.

Best wishes

Alois

I'm a Macintosh user with no dog in this fight. 

The s-mode restrictions on Windows are analogous to the iPad restrictions in my world. The solution in that case was not to make TeX-Live run, but instead to convert TeX to an internal library within a GUI interface, so no calls to other programs were needed. This approach ran into problems with the GPL, but eventually and with enormous work a couple of developers overcame these problems.
See Texpad iOS and TeX Writer, both in the Apple Store. 

I'm willing to bet that those developers are well aware of s-mode and their approaches will be the ultimate way TeX arrives on s-mode machines. I do not see this as a threat to TeX Live.

When the iPad was introduced, the canonical answer to "how do you do TeX" was to typeset over the network. But it wasn't long until iPad users wanted the typesetting engine to live on their machine. It is all too common to attend conferences and find the the network isn't working, or isn't available to visitors.

My experience is the following. Among the students I trained to LaTeX:

- in our technological institute, at least 20% of them still use it when
  they leave, especially the ones who join engineering schools. And,
  quite often, they are very happy to use there LaTeX instead of Word
  (and make other students feel jealous of them). However, only a few of
  them still use it later in their professional life, often because they
  can't use it.
- in institute for math teacher training, more than 80% of them still
  use it when they become teachers.
- in our doctoral school, more than 90% of them still use it.

It would be unfortunate for these students to not have been introduced
to LaTeX.

About "students [who] are not willing to follow [my] advice", the
problem is, they maybe would follow it if they would assist to 3 or
4 training sessions, which is a minimum to demonstrate the benefits of
LaTeX over Word. But they probably won't subscribe to my sessions, or
maybe just the 1st one, if they know or are facing all these new
complications due to this S-mode.

All the best.

hahaha, Imagine AWS or so

	Dear Jeff,
	I'm the president of the TeX User Group, an extremely powerful
	User Group of an Open Source Product with about a few thousand
	members. I am very disappointed how Amazon treats our services,
	and would like to ask you to update your system to properly
	support TeX.

Replace Jeff with any other ... guess what is the answer ... You have
-50 (yes, as in "minus fifty") guesses free...

Maybe we could ask Phil to be as annoying as ever with Microsoft, he
might manage to achieve something ...

Thanks for this information. So there is hope. Of course it helps
that in the Apple universe people are more willing to pay for stuff.

You can succeed if you write: "I give you 10^n USD if you allow TL in
the S-mode." And n must be sufficiently big. Microsoft is a business,
not a humanitary service.

Apple Store even offers free apps and the paid apps are usually cheap
even for user from the east. Anyway, I solved TL on iPad by using
Raspberry Pi, iPad was just its keyboard and screen. It's nice to use
an iPad as a client connected to a server in one's pocket. But I
understand that it is not much comfortable and it is not suitable for
everybody.

I have also tried Raspberry Pi connected to a MacBook, its powered
from MacBook's USB.

Correct. I wrote TeXShop, which is free, so these people are in some sense my competitors. But for the record

	TeXpad iOS = $19.95 
	TeX Writer = $14.95

Maybe if we are to ask someone with a little tact and diplomacy to write

Or perhaps, a solution to address the problem should be developed.

Anyone that installs and uses tex or derivatives knows it can be more
complicated than their operating system. If operating system vendors are
concerned about user's security, I say embrace that.

If tex were delivered, packaged, as a containerized processor of user
files, certification of the container engine may still be required, but
then packages could be installed as components of the engine, not requiring
additional certification.

Please, notice that without total redesign everything in TL depends on
cmd.exe which is Microsoft's own uncertified product, so what do you
want to achieve and how? Prohibition of cmd.exe is the key point f the
S-mode. Allowing cmd.exe is the same as cancellation of the S-mode.

I'm suggesting containerization is a means to a solution, for the S-mode
issue as well as challenges booting new user environment etc.

There are many containerization models/templates available today: docker,
kubernetes, rancher, rancheros, to name a few.

"total redesign everything" no not really, just establish a tool to define
the platform, certify the tool and port existing deployment to the
platform. There are probably already certified containers available, java
comes to mind but that is probably not the platform we want here.

users have to integrate tex to their platform every time they install a new
os anyway. I'm suggesting taking ownership of the platform to run the text
processing environment. It's not like the effort of owning OS maintenance,
but it does offer a means to own the environment of package deployment,
dependencies and text processing. After all, we cannot expect (all the) OS
vendors to support all the requirements of tex, ongoing anyway. It's a
changing world, you cannot expect platforms to remain unchanged. Define you
own platform, or re-port when the platforms change.

Subject: [tex-live] Further ghostscript problems, this time epstopdf
Message-ID: <84695436-c9f4-701a-e94b-281dc10e93cf@tuwien.ac.at>

I have some difficulties running epstopdf with TeXLive 2018 (and gs 9.26 
in cygwin64)

When I call it, I get the message:

 ?Warning: GenericResourceDir doesn't point to a valid resource directory.
 ?????????????? the -sGenericResourceDir=... option can be used to set this.

Setting the variable GenericResourceDir appropriately, epstopdf works 
fine. Seaching for the error message in Google returns quite old results.

Strangely I see many references to "/texlive/2018/tlpkg/tlgs/Resource/", 
when I run epstopdf with --debug, even if I unset all GS_FONTPATH 
entries. My TeXLive resides in E:/texlive, so somehow the "E:" seems to 
get somehow lost.

Does anyone encounter the same problem? For me it occurs at two quite 
similar Notebooks with Windows 10.

With kind regards

Alois

I'd strongly urge that we send no such letter.

In particular you should not send any letter that says

> Now it is not entirely clear what the *technical* requirements are in
order for a program to be eligible for inclusion in the Store's portfolio,

You should do that technical work _before_ any such letter is sent.

That's true. A year ago I was interested what are the rules for Apple App
Store. These rules are publicly available to everybody, it is not needed to
be a certified developer. Probably the MS Stores rules can also be found
somewhere on the MSDN web. I have not tried to look there and have no time
to do it but occasionally I read that web and it contains useful pieces of
information.

If you are using TeX Live 2018 x86_64-cygwin, that should be OK.
Are you uging TeX Live 2018 W32 with cygwin64 ghostscript?
I'm not familiar with this kind of mixed usage.
Please try not to use gs 9.26 in cygwin64.
In this case, the preinstalled gs 9.26 for W32 may be used.

And a total redesign is not helpful at all, even if someone is willing
to do the work.  If TeX Live doesn't work exactly the same way on all
supported systems there is no good reason anymore to prefer TeX Live
over MiKTeX.  Many Windows users who are not interested in this
important feature use MiKTeX anyway.

I occasionally support students writing their theses and it turned out
that this feature is unavoidable.  Different versions of macro
packages are not problematic because both, TeX Live and MiKTeX are
usually up-to-date.  But I often provide scripts which heavily rely on
the infrastructure of TeX Live.  I can't support MiKTeX users and I
can't support TeX Live users when we give up everything we achieved
regarding platform independency.

Some years ago a LaTeX teacher at Hannover University said that he's
using Linux exclusively.  Most participants of his course preferred
Windows and he was quite amazed that everything works exactly the same
way on both systems.  Nice to hear.  Denis, I suppose that your
experience is similar.

Zden?k, you said that banks might be interested in Microsofts S mode.
Definitely not!  No bank is maintaining your money on a system
provided by Microsoft. That would be disastrous.  I know that one of
the most famous banks in Germany is using Solaris.  The Windows
machines you see in the subsidiaries are just dumb terminals with a
web interface.  All one has to do in order to achieve security is to
configure the firewall so that only connections to the (IP number of
the) server can be established.

Denis, I suppose that your student encountered the S mode problem
because he had a brand new Windows installation and TeX Live was the
first 3rd party program he tried to install.  I'm only a stupid
engineer but cannot live without GNU Octave.  Do math students
nowadays rely entirely on Microsoft Excel and Microsoft's pocket
calculator and thus can live with S mode?  I can't imagine.

After all, as I already mentioned in a previous mail, Microsoft's
S mode is absolutely ridiculous.  It tries to make a system secure
which otherwise allows mortal users to execute arbitrary malware which
then modifies the bootloader and encrypts hard disks.  This is
absolutely unthinkable on any other operating system.  IMO Microsoft's
S mode is nothing more than an evidence of incapacity.

  Reinhard

You are talking all the same, the containerization technology is docker.
And I am rather certain that docker cannot be installed on Windows
S-mode.

k8s etc are using docker in the background, rancher is a frontend to
k8s, ...

Could you be more specific? This sounds very much like sales person blabla.
I am using all the above and more technologies daily for my job, and
none of them is a solution for the problem at hand.

Did you install Ghostscript on Cygwin at all?  You said

There is no directory "/texlive/2018/" on Cygwin.  So please use the
Cygwin package tool in order to install TeX Live and Ghostscript.

IMO it's a mistake that Cygwin inherits the Windows environment.

  Have you?  A subsection entitled??The app certification process?
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/uwp/publish/the-app-certification-process)
contains amongst others

	Certification

	During this phase, several tests are conducted:

	Security tests: This first test checks your app's packages for
	viruses and malware. If your app fails this test, you'll need to
	check your development system by running the latest antivirus software,
	then rebuild your app's package on a clean system.

	Technical compliance tests: Technical compliance is tested by
	the Windows App Certification Kit. (You should always make sure
	to test your app with the Windows App Certification Kit before
	you submit it to the Store.)

	Content compliance: The amount of time this takes varies
	depending on how complex your app is, how much visual content it
	has, and how many apps have been submitted recently. Be sure to
	provide any info that testers should be aware of in the Notes
	for certification page.

  The second and third section link to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/windows-app-certification-kit
and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies
respectively.  Did you read those pages?

Googling "site:docs.microsoft.com S mode cmd.exe" found

.

This has a list of programs blocked in S-mode.   There are documents that
walk you thru the process of converting
a side installer to the Windows App Store, but there is no point trying to
make an app that uses and banned programs.

  Thanks, George, that?s more useful than bothering a Microsoft
executive :-)

Another URL:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-prepare

But please do not make a fool of yourself (and us) by sending such a
letter: Windows 10 S is clearly not intended for software such as
TeX Live.

As Reinhart already pointed out, there is other software such as
Octave that does not fit into the S mold either. S mode is NOT for
every possible use.

Users who accidentally bought a 10 S system can remove S-mode. If
their organization does not permit that, then its IT staff should be
addressed, not Microsoft.

I would be very happy if someone would come up with a LaTeX app for
the windows store, but I think it would be a lot of work, and still
be a far cry from a full-blown TeX Live.

So you can wait until the students attend a course of mathematics or
statistics and have to install Octave and/or R-project. Somebody else
will then tell them to remove the S-mode...

If you look at the list of blocked software, you see that there is no
easy way. Porting to the S-mode will take a year or more. Verification
of such a huge package in MS will take another year. It will no longer
be TeX Live because the infrastructure (i.e. tlmgr and texmf.cnf) will
have to be different. Lua will not be allowed or will have to be
strongly limited so many luatex documents will not compile. \write18
will not be allowed so that files relying upon it will not compile.

I did not buy any TeX app for iPad. The reason was NOT the price, they
are not that expensive. The reason is that it is not TeX Live, there
are strong limitations posed by iOS. TeX for S-mode (whatever its name
will be) will be very similar. Services as TeXonWeb will be more
valuable if network connectivity is good.

I agree with your advice about not mixing Cygwin tools with native Windows 
tools.  Here's what I see on Cygwin, with the texlive-collection-fontutils 
package installed:

Answers usually come from people working in the field, not from
higher-ups.

Your mail suggests that someone is already spending time on this,
has downloaded, installed and explored Visual Studio and other
resources, and given thought to strategies how to circumvent the
store restrictions, and browsed e.g technet- and stackoverflow sites
for answers and workarounds; and that this someone would be willing
to co-sign this mail.

Over the next four years Professor Knuth re-wrote substantial parts of TeX and released TeX version 2, to be followed about a decade later by version 3, the version almost universally used today.  Almost since its inception, TeX has run on Microsoft platforms ? Eberhard Mattes wrote emTeX for MS/DOS, others developed versions for Microsoft Windows, and until now there have been no significant difficulties in supporting each new version of Windows as it was released.

As you know, far better than we, S-mode is intended to lock down Windows such that no program that does not come directly from the Microsoft Store can be installed and run.  Having consulted the technical guidelines describing the constraints placed on a program which is to run in S-mode, TeX's development/implementation team are very concerned that because (for example) TeX makes widespread use of CMD.exe, that in itself is sufficient reason for TeX to be disbarred.

Indeed. About 15 years ago, I used to provide ProTeXt for Windows users,
and TeX Live (or maybe teTeX) for Linux users. Because I didn't own
a Windows computer, it was a pain to provide both. At some point,
I noticed TeX Live could be used by Windows users as well so moved to
TeX Live only which worked /almost/ the same way on both systems: on
Windows, it used to be 6 times longer to install than on Linux :)

Indeed.

Really?!

They will probably first try to stay with the S-mode and look for free
apps in the Microsoft's store. Maybe, one day...

Yes, there are Windows related blogs and discussion groups, not only
stackoverflow. Although not being a Windows programmer I sometimes
have to create a compiled program for Windows and Google helps me to
find the relevant information. People in these groups will assist for
free. I doubt that Microsoft will ever offer free assistence to make
TeX Live for S-mode. They can offer paid support but it will most
likely be far beyond the TUG budget. They offer such support to
commercial partners. Such a partner does not hesitate to pay million
USD because they will then get a few billions as a profit.

I just want to point out that, according to some reports, there is 
simply no return point once the S-mode switch is turned off, i.e, you 
cannot re-enable it...

That's why I said you could be blamed if you advise somebody to do so.

Yes, it is one way and it is documented, see the links posted by
George N. White III within last few days. It is only possible to
delete everything and reinstall the whole OS from scratch. Of course,
it is a pain, thus a user must know that he/she does want to cancel
the S-mode.

Let me phrase it this way: if I understand the marketing strategy
behind S mode correctly, there is absolutely no place in it for TeX, R
or Octave.  Thus I doubt any efforts by Philip or anybody else would
change the situation.

Microsoft certainly knows a lot about how their OS is used and make
prediction of
future uses.  From my experience, there are far more MiKTeX users than  TL
users
on Windows.   There are also many widely used open source cross-platform
projects
that won't work in S-mode,  and probably some major commercial apps
(Matlab, Maple,
Mathematica, ...) that will have problems.   Most users of such
applications will
continue using Windows 10 I (Insecure).   A few may end up on Windows 10 S
because
they wanted a cheap system or work in an organization that puts priority on
security over
individual productivity.
According to
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/09/windows_10_s_mode_confirmed/
"Microsoft
says 'majority' of Windows 10 use will be 'streamlined S mode'  Which is
just-about an admission Win 10 is a mess"
This sounds like a projection based on MS projection in which cheap Windows
10 S
boxes for students will supplant Google Chromebooks combined with
enterprise adoptions
as those students enter the workforce.

I doubt the open source community will have any impact on the marketing of
cheap
Windows 10 S boxes.  The focus should be on: warning people planning to use
TL
on Windows 10 that they need to avoid 10 S, improving web-based systems
that can
be used on low end 10 S, and providing pointers to alternative OS's (e.g.,
linux, BSD,
and MacOS) for people who have used TL but find themselves forced onto
Windows10 S.

I completely agree with that analysis, which is one reason why my draft letter makes no mention of "Open Source".?

I would supplement that advising those who are in a position to do so to resist Windows 10 at all costs, and to stay with Windows 7 for as long as possible.? It is by means inconceivable, given Microsoft's track record to date, that by the time all support for Windows 7 is discontinued there will be a new version of Windows, with a version number greater than 10, which once again offers a professional user interface rather than one targetted at games players, casual users, and those who have never heard of programs or software but rejoice in their ever-increasing collection of "apps".

A large fraction of the TeX community has already rejected Windows.   The
group most at risk is students who either choose the cheapest "Windows
laptop" in the store or are encouraged by their school to purchase a
specific
configuration that provides S-mode.

A user of Microsoft R Open (MRO) was informed it is not and will not be
available
for Windows 10 S: https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-r-open/issues/65

There will be a long list of widely used cross-platform apps that will not
be
available on Windows 10 S.  Proponents of alternative OS's should be
working ensure their OS can be used on systems being sold with Win 10 S.
Then cross-platform apps can mention this option.

Hi,

these are not very representative results, the table contains just
answers of a few CSTUG members and they are summarized in an article
"Ako TeXujeme" here: http://bulletin.cstug.cz/bul20031.shtml
It is in Czech but you will certainly be able to understand the table.

Hi,

the columns are:
Operating system
TeX distro
TeX format
editor
viewer
programmable graphics
other graphics
output

And I was not precise, the language of the article is Slovak. The
numbers are insignificant, this is just an ordinal number of the user,
so we have 55 answers. The table is, of course, anonymous.

Well, I'm not particularly interested in contributing to a "community" that
rejects my comments about a framing a viable solution with pessimism and
cynicism. A constructive response identifies specific technical gaps for
consideration. I will go another step to explain my vision of viability
though.

I do not know how tlmgr works, but my first guess at enabling "lua" to pass
a security audit would be to distribute it without os.execute() and similar
functions. Sure that would be a formidable effort.

We should ground our perspective with the big picture, the intent of
s-mode. I don't do windows, and I don't know exactly, but I have enough
experience to make a very good guess. To certify for the store, signed
applications probably go through a vetting process that determines if they
are "safe" so an application capable of executing arbitrary downloaded
binaries (cmd.exe) would fail.

I really didn't mean to use 'docker' but to use a 'minimalist container
like framework' (such as..). Is there any kind of chroot  jail already
available in the store? If so that would be a place to start.  Any solution
MUST NOT enable an opportunity to corrupt or otherwise exploit any
unintended data or resources. Isolating a context, a sandbox, that allows
tex-live to operate within these constraints is a principle requirement. If
you ignore that, there is no point in  discussing further. Then again I
could be wrong, maybe the store will allow you to install software to
create network sockets, execute arbitrary binaries, and read/write
arbitrary user data...

In any event, good luck!

-George

Meaningful statistics are hard to get   Tex Live (and MacOS) is available
in many linux
distros as well as macports, and will be installed thru dependencies on
systems
that are not used for authoring documents (e.g., to format documentation
when installing
a package from source).  In some cases the user will see a TeX system being
installed
without knowing how it is used.  As a result,  the number of TeX installs
in linux systems
is not at all comparable to the numbers of TeX (e.g., MiKTeX + TL) on
Windows where most
installs are done by authors.

All I can go on is my own anecdotal experience.   I'm recently retired from
a scientific research
institute.  Although Windows was the "corporate standard", many scientists
found ways to
run TeX on MacOS or linux systems due to bad experiences using Windows.
An example
is a system that was initially configured with MiKTeX in a way that
required admin
privs to install updates or new packages, but there were also problems with
scripting
languages (bash, perl, sed, awk) being used to automate some aspect of
document creation.

According to a survey done by Dante (259 participants) published in
DTK 4/2018:

  On which operating systems are you using TeX/LaTeX (multiple
  choices are possible)?

     Linux/Unix:   168
     Windows:      135
     MacOS:         66
     none:           2
     others:         4

This was the first question of the survey and thus quite general.  The
other questions were about TeX Collection DVD usage.

Please note that the numbers above are not TeX Live related.  It's not
distinguished between TeX Live and MiKTeX.

Though I wished that there were more than 259 participants, I think
that the result is more meaningful than that of the survey done by
CsTuG 15 years ago.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Isolating a context, a sandbox, that allows tex-live to operate within these constraints is a principle requirement. If you ignore that, there is no point in  discussing further.

Please, do not feel cynicism in my e-mail. Although I am not an expert
at TL infrastructure, I know much about it because not everything was
available in OS/2 and I had to cope with it somehow myself. I have
\write18 disabled on my computers but as default it can only run
listed applications. I am not sure what can be done with os.execute in
Lua and how much it is needed e.g. in ConTeXt.

As far as tlmgr is concerned, many actions can easily be rewritten in
anything else but the key point is update. The size of installed TL
grew from 1.3 GB in 2007 to 7 GB in 2018 (scheme texlive-full with
Linux binaries). Tlmgr can install updated packages so it is possible
do download just a few KB if updates are requested regularly (there
may be several updates within a week). In MS Store the updates are
handled by the store irself. I haven't read the documentation but does
it mean, that if a single package is updated, it will be necessary to
upload the whole 7GB TL to MS Store and have it verified by MS
testers? Will MS Store be able to send incremental updates or will it
be necessary to downoad always 7 GB instead of a few KB of an updated
package?

I have no experience with container technologies, I have never tried
to develop anything for iOS or Android. However, I know that my
programs are intended to be used by users, not admins, so they are not
allowed to write to arbitrary place of the disk, they are not even
allowed to read all files, they are not allowed to change the system
settings. I have to be prepared for this and the program must not
crash but display an error message. If a user runs my programs with
elevated privileges, then it is not my fault. I got my knowledge
gradually for using and programming for CMS, CP/M, DOS, OS/2, Linux,
Mac OS X, Windows {3.0, 3.11, NT, 2000, 95, 98, XP, 7} and I always
wanted to make my software multiplatform. Now it seems that all I know
is next to useless for the S-mode and in addition to the multiplatform
version I will have to make an S-mode version.

So if I saw the suggestion of using container technology, I expected a
constructive outline what should be done and how. Of course, not the
real code but an RL with examples of code snippets demonstrating how
to convert an infrastructure of command line programs to an S-mode app
will be very useful. Just now it is much easier for me to provide a
web service for those unhappy persons who are not allowed to leave the
S-mode and hope that Javascript will not be crippled in Edge.

Hello Phil,
yes, if all people download TeX Live from CTAN, nothing is easier than
writing a script which evaluates the log files.

But HTTP requests are usually redirected to CTAN mirrors and we can't
run any script there.  If you want to know how many people are using
TeX on a particular system, you also have to get statistics from the
MiKTeX server too.  And most Linux users are using the TeX Live
distribution provided by the package tool.  Only those Linux users who
really need the latest packages install TeX Live from tug.org.

And don't worry about rsync users.  You are most likely the only one.

I fear that it's impossible to do statistics this way.  On the other
hand I'm convinced that such statistics are not very useful at all in
the context of TeX Live.  TeX Live is supposed to be a system for
*all* users, not only for *most* users.  Hence such statistics cannot
have any impact on TeX Live development.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Not at all.  TeX Live can't work without texlua's os.execute().  tlmgr
is written in Perl but how should it work if it's not able to invoke
fmtutil, updmap, wget, curl, etc?  There is absolutely no way to avoid
system(3).

chroot on Windows?  Are you joking?  Windows is one of the prehistoric
operating systems from the late 60ies or early 70ies which still lacks
a hierarchical file system, etc.  Don't know how old you are but do you
know what a "drive letter" is?

Could you investigate?  The main problem I see is that programs in
such containers do not cooperate very well with programs outside.
Suppose that you create a PDF file within such a container.  How do
you pass the PDF file to Adobe Reader installed on native Windows?

You said:

Come on, you are living in a fantasy world if you believe that
everything can be accomplished on Windows as simple as on Unix.

Our pessimism is justified because we know what we are talking about.

  Reinhard

As with others here, I have to disagree, but I cannot back it up either
with statistics. In Japan at least it seems that a lot of users *and*
developers use Windows.

Since most downloads are via the mirror system, and we don't have access
to the server logs on (name-your-university-or-mirror), we don't have
any statistics. (Would like to see that myself!)

These numbers are completely non-representative, but here's the number
of unique IPs which downloaded at least one platform-specific package
from our CTAN mirror with "texlive/lwp" since the 7th of December (1
week):
- win32: 15
- x86_64-linux: 5
- x86_64-darwin: 3
(Probably the server has a cron job to delete the logs and I don't
parse them or regular basis. I suspect that at least one darwin might
come from me while testing Siep's new GUI.)

The percentage of Windows users is quite a bit higher than in the
DANTE questionnaire, but I suspect that the population of users in any
TeX user group has way more unix users just because those users are
more likely to join than (lots of) random students with windows
computers.

  No, you don?t.  George is implying that since TeX users are part of the open
source community, they (we) won?t have any impact on the distribution of
Windows 10 S.  You seem to think that we could wield great influence on
Microsoft in some undefined way.

  You seem to have painted yourself in a corner of your own.

You simply cannot because if I remember well all information from the
relevant web sites, Adobe Reader does not work in the S-mode, there is
probably another PDF viewer and the PDF file will have to be shared
via a cloud (similarly as in iOS). You create the file, push it to the
cloud then ask the cloud app to move it to the working space of the
PDF viewer and open it. And of course, the possibility of reopening
the PDF at the same page just does not exist, because in the S-mode
applications are not allowed to communicate with each other, there is
no IPC and each app can only access its own AppData.

  You really haven?t been paying attention.  Their (self-proclaimed)
interest in open source is huge.  Just search for ?Microsoft loves open
source?.  If you want to impress on them that TeX is important, you
can?t in your draft letter ignore that it?s part of the open source
world, or you would be rendering the users that you purport to help a
signal disservice.  (And, needless to say, all of TeX Live is open
source / free software, not just some parts of it, and that?s an
important issue in TeX Live development.)

  Not my point.  You have opted for a very specific environment, not
reprentative of any general use case, and that increases my doubts that
you?re able to represent all TeX users on Windows, as you apparently
wish to.

Yes, it is possible not to update, but it is a temporary solution.
Personally I still prefer Windos XP to Windows 7 but if I want to port
my SW from Linux to Windows, I need Windows development tools and they
are no longer available for XP. I did not want to update but I was
forced to. Sometimes in the future you buy a new computer and find
that it has new hardware and the device driver is not available for
older Windows, thus you will be forced to update. I run Windows inside
VirtualBox in Linux so I can emulate anold hardware and install
Windows NT but using emulation of ol HW by a VM is not a good solution
for those who want to use Windows as their primary OS.

The fact that some parts of the TeX infrastructure are open-source is of interest primarily to those for whom the concept of "open-source" is important; many others (myself included) are interested primarily in the fact that (a) TeX is probably still the most powerful and flexible typesetting system yet invented, (b) that it is virtually bug-free, (c) that it runs under Microsoft Windows, and (d) that it was written by one of the most eminent computer scientists in the world (these points in no particular order).  Just because the concept of "open-source" is important to you, Arthur, does not mean that it is also important to others.

For me it is not important that it runs on Windows but that it runs on
all important platforms, it runs the same way and gives the same
result from the same sources. Being a Linux user I can collaborate
with users of Windows and Mac. I do this almost daily. I think that a
commecial tool with such capabiities does not exist.

But I have been asked by Boris to communicate with Microsoft on his/TUG's behalf, and that is a responsibility which I saw as my duty to accept.  Many in the TeX community loathe Microsoft Windows (see, for example, Reinhard's recent scathing message, or the number of times the spelling "Windoze" has been intentionally used), but I am not one of those ? I use Windows on a daily basis (although I confess that I was unwilling to move from MS/DOS to Microsoft Windows in the latter's early days), as do millions (perhaps billions) of others :  people who want to be able to ask a computer to perform a task for them, and who have no interest in being able to re-compile the operating system or any of its layered products from source.  As a member of that community, it is an honour and a privilege to be asked to speak to Microsoft on their behalf.

  It is not, Philip.  Why would you think that, and how are my personal
preferences relevant?  It is, however, as I pointed out, clearly
important to Microsoft in their positioning in today?s computing world;
hence omitting, apparently on purpose, that TeX is part of the open
source movement, is a tactical mistake.

  (Of course the interest Microsoft professes in open source may very
well be entirely self-serving and fake, but we don?t have to point it
out and that?s irrelevant.)

  Then I don?t think you?re the right person to write to Microsoft on
behalf of TeX Windows users, however honoured and privileged that may
make you feel.

  I don?t think so, no.  But your stating this, in the middle of a
discussion to understand and hopefully solve problems with TeX Live that
are exclusive to Windows, leads me to believe that your own personal
preferences are influencing you in some perhaps undesirable ways.

  Who talked about calling their bluff?  I wrote the exact opposite:
let?s not point it out, and instead use it to our advantage.  The amount
of noise Microsoft makes about ?loving open source? and such like is,
when you pay attention to it, deafening.  If we?re to try and attract
their attention to problems the TeX community have, it can only help to
use the same buzzwords as them.

  Of course it is, to you.  Just like you don?t seem to realise that we
should be playing Microsoft at their own game by bandying about phrases
like open source.  You would surely not mention LaTeX either, would you?

Why not give them a pointer to this very discussion? All in all, this is
an open mailing list, with archives open to the public. May the
officials and PR strategists at Microsoft get their own picture of what
fellows they shall grant a forum within their ?store??

  You?re making such a good job of it!  I did not think it possible
to mention a name *twice* in a paragraph requesting not to refer to it.
I?ll be using [name intentionally left blank] in the below.

  Thank you for your draft.  It is terrible.

  (As as side note, I think it would help if you could identify an
actual person within [name intentionally left blank], or at least a
role, because it has a strong bearing on parts of the contents.)

  Considering the tendency to overuse ?literally? nowadays, I don?t
think it fits with the necessary tone for such a missive -- even if used
in a way that would be approved by purists -- and especially not in
parenthesis.  Drop it.

  That?s a nice introductory sentence, well done.

  Nothing in that sentence is of any interest to anyone except the
(rather specialised) historian.  Software have successive versions,
that?s a given, and we don?t need to prove that we can count up to
three.

  I don?t see the point of mentioning Eberhard Mattes, whose name is the
only one you use except for Don?s.  If you?re going to be name-dropping,
I thought you could at least do it well, with for example Leslie
Lamport, who is after all a recipient of the Turing award.  Then I
remembered that didn?t like LaTeX.

  (I also think that ?no significant difficulties in supporting each new
version of Windows? is a bit of a stretch, but let?s forget about that.)

>      But recently, an impasse has been reached, with the announcement of
>      Windows 10 "S-mode".

  The ?impasse? has not been reached with the announcement, saying that
is the equivalent of shooting the messenger.  You need to say something
like ?an impasse can be foreseen with the new S mode of Windows 10?.
But however awkward this sentence is, it?s nothing compared to

  Now you?re actually insulting the recipient.  Do you realise that?
>From our point of view on this list, the S mode is indeed a gaol locking
the programmer down -- I think Norbert was the first one to use that
phrase in this thread -- but that?s of course not how [name
intentionally left blank] will choose to see it.  They will point to the
simplicity and enhanced security (S stands evidently for the latter)
that on the contrary represents freedom, to browse the Web in all peace
of mind and to use the apps you so despise.

  Then it?s all downhill from here:

>                                                                 ? Having
>      consulted the technical guidelines describing the constraints placed
>      on a program which is to run in S-mode

  ?Consulted? is too pompous for the (very) cursory reading of a rather
short Web page.  In looking for a verb to replace it with, I found that
we could entirely do away with one: ?From the technical guidelines,
etc.?.

>                                              TeX's development/implementation

  What?s the point of the two nouns here?  Choose one, they?re
equivalent in this context.  I would recommend the former which is much
more common nowadays, and I suspect you don?t like it either, which is
probably why you want to put the second one as well.

  It *is* a sufficient reason for any program to be excluded from [name
intentionally left blank]?s app store, it?s very clear from the page
that you?ve read, er, ?consulted?.  There?s no use being coy about it.
And the fundamental problem is much wider than that: the whole
implementation of S mode will make it well-nigh impossible to make a TeX
distribution for it without considerable efforts.  Which leads us to

  Here comes the crux, of course.  You ask head-on [name intentionally
left blank] to provide us with a special advisor.  For free?  That seems
impossible.  As Zden?k mentioned, we can expect to pay millions of
dollars for that kind of service.  Why would a commercial company give
up on that?  For a few million users of one particular program?

  If you want to write a convincing letter, you need to explain what
outcome you expect from it, and why it?s realistic.

What you can include in the letter is a note saying that TeX users can
becom disappointed by new limitations and decide to leave Windows and
switch to another OS. They might understand possible loss of profit.

Subject: [tex-live] pdfnup (pdfTeX) error
Message-ID: <20181213200931.GA3831@T460s-orm>

Hi,

 pdfnup stops with an error on any pdf file.

Issuing "pdfnup <pdf-filename>" results in the following log entry of
pdfTeX:

[1
! pdfTeX error (\pdfsetmatrix): Unrecognized format..
\AtBegShi at Output ...ipout \box \AtBeginShipoutBox 
                                                  \fi \fi 

This happens in the shipout (output routine) of the first page and it
happens for any pdf file.  As it worked before I assume it's not me
(it's been quite a while I used this, though).

Here some additional info:

tested on amd64 Arch Linux.

Arch Version:

extra/texlive-core 2018.49285-1

It works here like a charm.  I'm using TeX Live 2018 from tug.org on
x86_64-linux.

This is strange.  \pdfsetmatrix is a documented primitive of pdfTeX
and pdfTeX is stable for years.  I don't know what "Unrecognized
format" means.  The only way to spot it is to examine the source code.  

Could you save the pdftex binary provided by Arch Linux somehow and
replace it with the latest release of

  https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/x86_64-linux/pdftex

and try again?

I just did and can confirm that it still works as expected.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Orm,

this is the list for TeX Live upstream, your problem seems to be related
to the Alpine packaged version of TeX Live!

I cannot reproduce this here with upstream TeX Live:
$ pdfnup kumihan-en.pdf 
          ----
  pdfjam: This is pdfjam version 2.08.
  pdfjam: Reading any site-wide or user-specific defaults...
          (none found)
  pdfjam: Effective call for this run of pdfjam:
          /home/norbert/tl/2018/bin/x86_64-linux/pdfjam --suffix nup --nup '2x1' --landscape -- kumihan-en.pdf - 
  pdfjam: Calling pdflatex...
  pdfjam: Finished.  Output was to '/home/norbert/kumihan-en-nup.pdf'.
$

> TeX 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2018/Arch Linux)

Please contact the Arch people about this, since it is not reproducible
in *real* *upstream* TeX Live.

Thanks.

Norbert

  Orm,

Looks related to this:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=865323

In 2017, Norbert released a new version of graphics-def to
fix the problem. I don't know what packages pdfnup loads.
So, this may or may not be a manifestation of the 2017
problem.


  Cheers,

  Mike

Hi,

 thanks for all comments. Sorry, if this isn't the right place to ask
but your comments give me a handle. I'll dig into it and report back
if the solution might be useful to others.

Subject: [tex-live] Making texts externally replaceable in PDFs,
	e.g. with sed(1)
Message-ID: <fa3aabbb-909c-75de-1f32-826d521ce0d1@siemens.com>

Hi folks,

we are using XeTeX 3.14159265-2.6-0.99999 (TeX Live 2018) on Windows and 
FreeBSD.

After studying the PDF specification [1] and how XeLaTeX and xdvipdfmx 
work with Unicode (from PDF samples), I believe that my request is 
(virtually) impossible.
I'd be happy if someone could either confirm this or prove me wrong.

Task: We are producing PDFs on our server (from LaTeX source) for the 
client which takes the PDF and uploads it to another service which may 
replace placeholders, e.g., %DOCID% with the actual document ID in the 
target system. So the PDF has to be uncompressed (xdvipdfmx -z 0) and 
has to contain literal strings "(%DOCID%)Tj" or "[(%DOCID%)]TJ" 
according  to the PDF spec.

XeLaTeX produces the following:
> BT /F1 5.9776 Tf -40.819 -756.627 Td[<00270052004e00580050004800510057005100580050005000480055>]TJ /F1 9.9626 Tf 0 -11.955 Td[<0008002700320026002c00270008>]TJ ET

So it writes hexadecimal character codes which map to Unicode points in 
our true type font Siemens Global.

So for a sed(1)-based postprocessor it is virtually impossible to map

will not work because the /ToUnicode cmap does not have a character 
mapping from the literal "%" (etc.) to the corresponding Unicode point. 
Especially because the to be replaced chars in the real document ID 
would need to be in the bfchar listing.

Having procuded a capable, corresponding PDF with PDF XChange printer 
driver embedded the Siemens Global twice. As Identity-H encoding 
(subset) and with WinAnsiEncoding (completely). Without the char code to 
glyph mapping it seems to be possible. So the approach has to be a 8-bit 
font encoding:

This is something which is impossible because of XeLaTeX's Unicode 
nature. It will always use CID with Indentity-H and UCS ordering.

This will get even more complicated if glyph spacing is involved.

I'd be happy if someone could drop a comment or two on the issue.

Michael

PS: I haven't looked into the pdfx package yet how this could solve the 
issue with XeLaTeX. Plus, my PDF spec and LaTeX knowledge is very little.

I have briefly tried pdfx with a-1b option and disabled hyperxmp. The 
PDF is generated properly, but the font configuration remains the same. 
So PDF/A doesn't give me any benefits.

thanks for your quick reply, but neither of will work and suffers from 
conceptual misunderstanding.

Look closely at the Test.pdf, it is compressed. Cannot be processed with 
sed(1). Even if you decompress it, it contains a Type 1 font which has 
no /Encoding or /Ording. /FontFile3 references 10 0 obj which contains 
the entire font. This does not resemble my Unicode case at all.
The content is in 5 0 obj:

As for Adobe Acrobat Pro DC: It is a fully-fledged PDF suite which knows 
the format best and operates on an abstract memory representation of the 
PDF while sed(1) does operate on pure bytes.

The operations this suite performing doing can only be achieved with a 
library like iText of PDFBox [1]. this isn't a route I really want to 
go. Especially because the post-processing on the target side is out of 
my hands at all.

Michael

  This is the information I was missing in your first email.  So to
reply to your original question: yes, it is virtually impossible to
post-process a PDF file with sed, in the general case.

Fair enough ? if it has to be accomplished using "sed" or similar, then emulating Adobe Acrobat Pro DC is clearly a non-starter.

My hope is that some xdvipdfmx guys says: "Hey, we can do 
\plainmagic{%DOCID%} and this part will be pure text in the PDF".

So one has to alter xdvipdfmx, if possible at all.

I don't understand this. Where is the difference between
<0008002700320026002c00270008> and (%DOCID%)? Both is a quite unique
string. 



>

It is easy:

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
 \special{dvipdfmx:config z 0} %uncompress pdf

 \begin{document} 
 
 {\fontencoding{OT1}\ttfamily \%DOCID\%
  \makebox[0pt]{%
   \raisebox{5cm}[0pt][0pt]{1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ}}%
 } 
 
 bllb
 
 \end{document}

This gives -68.742 Td[(%DOCID%)]TJ in the pdf.

The chars in the raisebox are there so that the chars perhaps needed
for the replacement are also in the pdf. 

Be aware that you must exchange the same number of chars. %DOCINFO%
can be replaced by 7 other chars, but not less or more or the xref
table will be faulty.

Hi,

the biggest problem is that fonts are usually embedded as a subset so
you can replace the text cintaining the embedded characters. The text
must have the same length bcause the adresses of streams and other
objects must remain unchanged. For modifications of a PDF file I would
suggest QPDF: http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/
I have not tried it myself but it seems capable of such transformatins.

Hello,

I am also on Arch Linux, but I use the Original TeXLive, and there
everything works fine.

Arch Linux has the philosophy to not patch packages much, but they have
also the philosophy to use system libraries as much as possible, and the
texlive-bin package is linked against systems's poppler, which is at
version 0.71.0. I think this is the most important difference.

The patches Arch applies can be viewed here:
https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/texlive-bin

What th OP could to is to run

ldd $(which pdftex)

The original pdftex has this:

        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffac350000)

The Arch delivered one should have some more shared libs. I happen to
have an older package lying around on my system, but for the version the
OP has it should be similar.

At first sight, yes, but I don't expect the char code to glyph mapping 
to be stable as long as more and more glyphs are added to bfchar. This 
is likely an implemenation detail of xdvipdfmx. I don't want to rely on 
that. So "<0008002700320026002c00270008>" does not always has to be 
"(%DOCID%)" I guess.

That's awesome, but this defeats the standard font of Siemens Sans 
Global to OT1 (Mono) and will violate the required layout style of our 
documentation reponsible. This isn't really something I want to do.

Yep, that's issue. Due to the subset nature, this is unfortunately 
required. One could also move them outside of the viewport because for 
now there are visible which isn't really desired.

I noticed that too, one would need to update the stream length and the 
xref table. It is feasable to make the placeholder as long as the actual 
content.

Thank your for the idea, but do you know how to enforce the main font 
here while retaining WinAnsiEncoding?

Hm. Yes. But it shouldn't be so difficult to create a rather unique
pattern. E.g. with four %%%%.

You could create a tfm and a type1 font from you font.

Beside this: you could also store your text in a xform object
instead of directly in the stream. With a suitable attribut it
should be easy to find the object and replace the content.

True, but the real problem isn't actually me, it is the target service 
which only knows PDF literal strings. Even if I say replace <HEX> with 
(LITERAL) that wouldn't work at the end :-(

That would be a whole new ground for me. I need to discuss this with our 
project lead who is proficient in LaTeX and can tell whether this is 
worth the effort or not.

Can you give me a pointer to a MWE? I guess you aren't talking about 
XHTML's XForms.

Subject: [tex-live] Supplied a custom PDF trailer ID with XeLaTeX/xdvipdfmx
Message-ID: <5a2a57f4-c12f-b302-cff4-4fc033afa2e5@siemens.com>

Hi folks,

we are producing PDFs with XeLaTeX (TL 2018) which already have a UUID 
set in the XMP stream of the PDF (by the backend service via hyperxmp). 
I noticed that the PDF trailer contains an ID too which is a 16-byte 
long string, just like the UUID sans hyphens. I would like to write the 
very same UUID to it instead of the MD5-hashed one. According to the 
spec, this is fine.

Looking through the net I didn't find an option to do so with XeLaTeX 
and xdvipdfmx. Ideally, I would provide this with hypersetup: 
pdftrailerid={...}, but I could also live with a param for xdvipdfmx.

Looking at the source code of dvipdfm-x I see pdf_set_id(pdf_obj *), 
pdf_enc_id_array(), pdf_enc_compute_id_string(char *, char *, char *) as 
well as the static sec_data structure which contains "unsigned char 
ID[16]". That'd be perfect to write to.

Is that feasible, if yes which route? via LaTeX source code or via cmd 
for the driver? One could of course modify dvipdfmx.c for a new param, 
but I don't know the system well enough to tell whether this is a smart 
approach or not.

I'd like to avoid to iterate over the PDF with sed(1) or a Java 
BufferedReader just to replace "/ID[<HEX><HEX>]".

Ideas?

Regards,

Michael

Currently there are no way to directly specify IDs in PDF trailer.
However I think it is not difficult to add such feature to dvipdfmx.
I will consider implementing it.

  That honestly sounds like a considerably better technical solution in
the context that you?ve described.

This is something I fully agree. The solution is straight forward and 
clean. I see no better way to solve this. In fact, I wouldn't try to 
solve it differently.

True, I already noticed this and replied to Ulrike. Figured QPDF already 
out myself, I need to see how it can really help me. Though, it adds 
complexity to the process.

Thanks for considering. I'd be happy to test if you have something 
testwhile next year. Just drop me an email and I'll test on FreeBSD.

I'm not sure. It would work but at the end you are including a
non-unicode-font. 
I would include a representative string (1234567890abcd...)
somewhere outside the viewport, use this to identify the correct hex
numbers and then exchange the hex.

Yep, this is what I had in mind a couple of days ago. Still, the 
exchange has to be performed by the target service which I do not 
control. I don't consider them to read the PDF spec like me and replay 
this approach.

We likely will consider the non-Unicode font for only this case. WE just 
need \d, A-Z and maybe % or alike.

Thanks,

Michael

The advantage of QPDF is that it can read any PDF (even with
compressed streams), convert them to the QPDF mode which is
uncompressed and the xref table does not matter, you can exchange your
stream, include a font (if needed) and have the result converted back
to a real PDF which can even be compressed, the tables will be
automatically recalculated. I think that the stream can be replaced in
the QPDF mode just by text manipulations using sed, awk etc, it will
not be necessary to compile a new binary base on the QPDF library.

Correct, with some custom code I could add the Type 1 font object, 
search for the BT/ET and replace with Tj parts as well as the /F font 
ref. That still makes quite a lot of work for a simple task.
I haven't found a command to leave the QDF mode. All I see is
1. qpdf --qdf-mode ...
2. Change file
3. fix-qdf ... (recalculates stream lengths and xref table)
4. ...Where is --leave-qdf-mode?

  Why is that a problem?  Both the placeholder and the replacement text

It simply contradicts XeLaTeX's approach to work with Unicode fonts 
only, if available. IMHO.

  But that?s only best practice, not a technical requirement.  I would
argue that you can?t afford to follow best practice here because you?ve
already made (if implicitly) the decision to find technical solutions to
what is fundamentally a human problem.  The idea of post-processing PDF
files with sed is, quite frankly, insane, and shows a poor understanding
of the PDF format and the technical requirements for automated
typesetting.

  Since you?ve apparently given up -- and I can understand why you would
-- on convincing the team responsible for post-processing to adopt a
better approach, you need to make the best possible use of the tools at
your disposal in this abnormal situation.  Using an 8-bit font with
XeTeX is a reasonable price to pay, and won?t hurt its feelings :-)

	Best,

Granted, this is what I have documented in our internal issue tracker. I 
complete dislike this broken approach.

I haven't really given up, but went quite far to fully understand the 
issue which I did and now understand PDF much better than before.

At the end, it is a cost/benefit decision which I don't make. I do the 
technical analysis and coding. The font type 1 approach is way easier 
than using QPDF in QDF mode and modifying streams.

My conclusion in our tracker: "Meine Empfehlung, komplett sein lassen, 
Problem anders l?sen." -- "My recommendation, don't do, solve differently."

It hasn't be said explicitly and would you trust people setting up
something like this to stay in the ascii range?

But the main problem I see is that at the end you have to embed
another font, and that type1 fonts in xelatex are not always without
problems, even more if the font has perhaps the same name as an open
type font.

    Currently there are no way to directly specify IDs in PDF trailer.
    However I think it is not difficult to add such feature to dvipdfmx.
    I will consider implementing it.

pdftex has (for ages) had a command \pdftrailer{...} to change the
trailer text. More recently, we also added \pdftrailerid to seed the /ID
value in the trailer.

In general, it seems it would be nice if xetex had analogous commands to
pass through to a new capability of dvipdfmx, instead of requiring users
to intervene in the dvipdfmx call. Jonathan? (Or Joseph or ...?)

perhaps wouldn't need to be a new xetex command could just be a
\special (which could be hidden as

Yes, I'm considering a special command like

 \special{pdf:trailerid [<ID1> <ID2>]}

to be added to dvipdfmx.

That would be awesome, I could simply add that via Java to our 
settings.tex with the document UUID stripped from hyphens.

I was trying to see why when updating in windows (the same number of
packages) it takes almost four times what linux takes to run
"mktexlsr"
(I assume it's because of the file system used by windows 10).

You mean the output to stdout is different? Yes, because the one is a C
program and the other is a shell program which are developed
differently and independently.

Functionality-wise they are the same.

THat has to do with the filesystem of Windows, and not with anything
else.

Hallo Erich,

ich bin dabei, die Linux-Dinge, die mir Schwierigkeiten machen und Zeit 
kosten, zu sammeln. Wenn es bei Deinem Linux-Kurs rein passt, w?rde es 
vielleicht auch anderen helfen. Wolfgang

Akut:

Ich habe Texlive von einer DVD (CTAN) installiert.

1. H?rde: Man braucht perl, um? perl install-tl -gui aufzurufen. Es wird 
aber nicht darauf hin gewiesen, dass perl fehlt. Stattdessen landet man 
auf der Kommandozeilen-Installation.

Frage: Wie findet man heraus, welche Zutaten man zum Backen braucht

2. H?rde: Nach der Installation soll der MANPATH und INFOPATH gesetzt 
werden. Da steht nur MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/man 
bzw das entsprechende f?r INFOPATH

Es dauerte eine Weile, bis ich heraus fand, wie es sein muss:

export INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH
wolfgang at wolfgang-Mr-Whisper-Ultra-SSD-II:~/Programme+iso/fig2dev-3.2.7a$ 
export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2018/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH

Frage: Wie werden Pfade angegeben,wozu, Beispiele

Ich schicke eine Kopie an Karl Berry, der die ansonsten sehr gute 
Beschreibung der Texlive Installation verfasst hat (http://tug.org/texlive/)
<http://tug.org/texlive/>

tex-live at tug.org
<http://tug.org/texlive/>

Gru? und gute Zeit,

Hallo Wolfgang,

die tex-live mailing Liste ist ein Medium wo man normalerweise auf
English kommuniziert.

Hier ist nicht Perl das Problem, das ist normalerweise immer
installiert. Was nicht installiert ist ist Perl/Tk. Dies ist
in der man page von install-tl (oder Ausgabe von install-tl -h)
dokumentiert:
- http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html
	The perltk and wizard modules, and thus also when calling
	with bare -gui (with no module), require the Perl/Tk module
	(http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk); if Perl/Tk is
	not available, installation continues in text mode.
Wie man das installiert, findet man unter dem Link der angegeben ist.

Dies h?ngt von der verwendeten shell ab (sh/bash/csh/zsh/...) und ist
eine Standardoperation unter Unix.

Ich war ja davon ausgegangen, dass das ein Irrl?ufer ist -
normalerweise fangen Nachrichten an die Liste nicht mit "Hallo

Subject: [tex-live] Add rmpost in shell_escape_commands ??

Back on this thread from May 2017 (sorry).
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2017-May/040169.html

    hy> Would it be possible to have new commands like
    > * "rmpost" (mpost -restricted)
    > * "rpmpost" (pmpost -restricted)
    > * "rupmpost" (upmpost -restricted)

I hope this is still relevant. I just committed a change (r49471) to TL
to make these links at install time as usual. (I did nothing about Windows.)

I also mentioned (in a half-dozen words or so) these changes in the man
page. Is there any maintained web page with more information about
(u)pmpost?

Luigi: please import into your upstream repo (where is it?) as needed.

    > And also, would it be possible/safe to have "rmpost" added to
    > shell_escape_commands again?

I hope so, though I did not do any serious testing. I changed the source
kpathsea/texmf.cnf to include rmpost. Should the other two be included
too, or does it matter?

I note there is a program "pmpost" which is some kind helper for the
"Performance Co-Pilot"; it is installed in /usr/libexec/pcp/bin on
CentOS7. Oh well. I also note the names "rmpost" and "rpmpost" look
rather misleading (as in "remove post[something]", "rpm post[action]"),
but nevertheless, I see no better convention to adopt.

If no problems come up, I'll make the changes in the runtime in a couple
of days so we can propagate the new versions and see what happens.
--thanks, karl.

Hi Michael,

Support for custom PDF trailer ID is added to dvipdfmx.
It is already available in TeX Live development source repository.

IDs must be supplied as an array of two PDF string objects as

  \special{pdf:trailerid [(0123456789abcdef) (0123456789abcdef)]}

Or IDs can be specified in hexadecimal form

  \special{pdf:trailerid [
    <30313233343536373839616263646566>
    <30313233343536373839616263646566>
  ]}

It must appear on the first page, otherwise it will be ignored.


Thanks,
Shunsaku Hirata

TeX Live now depends on other libraries (poppler, ICU, ...) and uses
binaries (dvisvgm, partially asymptote, ...) which need C++11, so this
is no longer a dealbreaker.

Also in case of HarfBuzz it means only requiring a C+11 capable
compiler, HarfBuzz still does not link to libstd++ (and this is unlikely
to change in the near future).

Thanks for the warning.

    mm> TeX Live now depends on other libraries (poppler, ICU, ...) and

Yes, we were forced into C++11 last year by ICU. What this means is that
any harfbuzz-using program will not be compilable on CentOS 6 or other
glibc 2.12 systems, as discussed here, among other places:
  https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/443489
I don't know off the top of my head if there are any programs in TL that
use harfbuzz and not poppler.

Poppler has since moved to C++14 which is a killer, so I hope that
doesn't happen with harfbuzz any time soon. (Our only short-term
solution is not to update Poppler. I think we can get away with this
because we use only small pieces of it. The most likely long-term
solution is to switch to the "(lua)pplib" Luigi has developed, so we
won't depend on poppler at all any more.) --best, karl.

Subject: [tex-live] [Patch] XeTeX - Avoid modification of internal poppler
 object, fix compilation with poppler 0.72
Message-ID: <32902194.ltUzi11jlD@pebbles>

Create a copy of the the returned const PdfRectangle* and modify the copy.

Recent versions of poppler are much more explicit when exposing objects, i.e. 
these are returned as const T* instead of a (mutable) T*.

As these are not copies, modifiying the objects without copying has always 
been wrong, the changed API just enforces it. The patch should be applied 
regardless of the poppler version (since at least 2013), although as a side 
effect it also fixes compilation with poppler 0.72 (which changed the return 
type for several getFooBox() methods to be const).

Kind regards,

Stefan

Many thanks. Applied in the TeX Live SVN: r49491.
BTW, we are using poppler 0.68.0 in the TeX Live,
and we will not update the poppler because newer
ones require C++14.

The current TeX Live SVN sources for lua[jit]tex
don't use lepdflib.cc, and poppler.

For TL 2019 (no need to do it just now) it would be helpful though if
the sources could do some #ifdef-ing (based on poppler version) to
also support the latest system version of poppler.

In MacPorts we recently switched to TeX Live's own version of poppler
since the package maintainer gave up trying to patch TeX Live sources
to be compatible with the latest poppler shipped with the package
manager. This was following Norbert's advice; if I remember correctly
the same is done in Debian. We can also leave it that way, but in case
those who know the sources better know how to fix the sources in a
correct way ...

The present XeTeX sources themselves are completely compatible
with the newest poppler 0.72.0.
I don't know about configuration for system poppler.
Karl or Norbert will configure if they admit its
necessity and if they have free time.

Awesome, thank you very much, I wasn't aware of this :)

Last time some people tried to backport some of your patches
(admittedly to TeX Live 2018) and eventually gave up, but it could be
that LuaTeX was the main blocker (which will no longer be the case in
TL 2019 anyway). I didn't look into it at that time, we simply
switched to the built-in version. I'll retry with the latest sources.

Thank you again,
    Mojca

(I hope that at some point someone will be able to migrate from
poppler to pplib also for XeTeX and pdfTeX :)

May be XeTeX should switch to the new pplib as well, IIRC correctly all
XeTeX needs is some bbox information about the PDF, all actual PDF
inclusion is done by dvipdfmx (dvipdfmx can provide the info XeTeX needs
as well, but it is not built as a library).

    from poppler to pplib also for XeTeX and pdfTeX :)

That's the wish, yep. And when Luigi says pplib is ready (probably not
for 2019, aside from luatex), I think it will not be too onerous. -k

I myself totally forgot about it, but thanks for the heads up.
Yes, that's still useful ;-)

I don't think many people (even in Japan) are using (u)pmpost,
so you can omit those for texmf.cnf.

Hmm... prefix "r-" instead of "r"? It will require rebuilding the binaries,
so if we can wait for 2019 ...

  That?s correct, it?s in pdfimage.cpp, which also defines a function
pdf_count_pages that doesn?t seem to be used anywhere (except in another
function that doesn?t seem to be used anywhere).  It shouldn?t be a
problem to switch to pplib when it?s ready.

You mean countpdffilepages()? That's called from xetex.web, where it 
appears as count_pdf_file_pages. (The tangling process strips out the 
underscores, hence the less-readable name of the C implementation.)

Ifdef's are somewhat complicated as poppler only defines a version string like
#define POPPLER_VERSION 0.72.0
which is somewhat difficult to use for version compares. Might be possible to 
do some version checks in configure.

The majority of poppler changes are const correctness changes. The API exposed 
internal objects as non-const, while it should have been const from the 
beginning.

All these changes can be handled by using
const Foo foo = bar->getFoo();
instead of
Foo foo = bar->getFoo();
in the calling code, i.e. {Pdf,Lua,Xe}TeX.

The first version compiles fine with *all* versions of poppler, while the 
second fails with more and more parts of poppler, as const is added wherever 
appropriate. No #ifdef's needed here.

Unfortunately, the TeX code has added static casts removing the const in more 
and more places instead of declaring the variables as const. In most cases, 
this is no functional problem, as the (non-const) objects where never 
modified, the occasion here in XeTeX was one of the rare outliers.
 
There where two actual API changes in poppler:
0.69: dictionaries changed the signature from add(char* key, ...) to add(const 
char* key, ...), where the old version transferred ownership of the key (so 
one had to use dict->add(copystring("key"), ...), the new one uses references 
(so one can use dict->add("key", ...) now).

0.72: GooString::getCString() was renamed to GooString::c_str(). Attribute 
changed the constructor from Attribute(char*, size_t, ...) to 
Attribute(GooString, ...).

If you want patches, see:
const correctness:
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/
home:StefanBruens:branches:Publishing:TeXLive/texlive/source-fix-const-
poppler0.66.0.patch

poppler 0.69 changes:

poppler 0.72 changes:
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/
home:StefanBruens:branches:Publishing:TeXLive/texlive/source-poppler-use-
std_string.patch

Note, you have to rename *-newpoppler.cc to *.cc in pdftexdir before applying 
the patches. All three patches are for TL 2018.

Kind regards,

Stefan

As this affects all distributions shipping TL 2018 *now* (and also TL 2017, 
...), and will only be changed with TL 2019, there may be some users for this 
patch.

Kind regards,

Hi,

tonight (European time) something very weird happened.

I had turned off the wifi on my laptop to spare batteries,
but had forgotten that and decided to update my TL2018,

here is how it started (as one can see in transcript I hit Ctrl-C quickly)

$ tlmgr update --all
cannot contact mirror.ctan.org, returning a backbone server!

^CNo connection to the internet.
Unable to download the checksum of the remote TeX Live database,
but found a local copy so using that.

You may want to try specifying an explicit or different CTAN mirror;
see the information and examples for the -repository option at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html
(or in the output of install-tl --help).


BUT lo and behold it then continued....:

(I hit CTRL-C in panick as seen above, as some aetheral power had taken control of my laptop)

(then I hit CTRL-C again on each package update:)

Then, I turned on the wifi and tried again, and much to my surprise, indeed the very same packages as listed above got updated (about the timings, I moved my laptop to the more favourable location in the room during ketcindy download which was more or less stalled)

How is it possible that my mac book air could let tlmgr simultaneously
report no connection to the Internet and at the very same time still
find out which packages could get updated ?

(all of this happening while my WIFI icon in the top menu bar indicated
that WIFI was "deactivated")

(but the Terminal window process itself had been launched at a time
of WIFI "on" and had had some internet activity before WIFI got turned "off")

As far as I understand, your first approach was to start tlmgr with
WIFI turned off and your second approach was to start tlmgr with
WIFI turned on.  What exactly do you mean with "simultaneously"?

It's a matter of fact that you can't update your TeX Live installation
if the internet is not accessible.

  Reinhard

    Hmm... prefix "r-" instead of "r"? 

Hmm. That looks like a pretty good suggestion to me. r-mpost, r-pmpost,
r-upmpost, seem much less susceptible to misunderstanding.

    It will require rebuilding the
    binaries, so if we can wait for 2019 ...

Clearly no one has been urgently needing this, since it's been a year
and a half since we talked about it :). Can you take care of [u]pmpost?

And, Luigi, for the upcoming release, could you change mpost sources to
recognize $0 = r-mpost as meaning -restricted, like rmpost does now?

Thanks,
Karl

I had my WIFI off and ran tlmgr in a Terminal window.
It reported no internet connection so I immediately tried to
abort it by a CTRL-C.

After this first CTRL-C, tlmgr resumed its work and then
(hence the simultaneously) initiated update of package

tlmgr: package repository http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: unknown)
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2018/tlpkg/backups
[1/9, ??:??/??:??] update: dtxgallery [345k] (15878 -> 49504) ... ^CTLPDB::_install_package: downloading did not succeed

but a bit stupidly I immediately CTRL-C'ed again and then again and again
for each of the 9 packages so I am not certain it would have downloaded it.

It appeared that tlmgr was in fact succesfully connecting to the Internet
despite my mac book air pretending the WIFI to be OFF and the
corresponding icon in menu-bar confirming it


I am certain of it, because at that location where I was the WIFI is very
poor and I often have to move near the entrance door, turn off and
back on the WIFI in order for the laptop to connect again.


And indeed this is what I did yesterday to reestablish connection
to my WIFI network. It took me at least thirty seconds, and after that
I executed tlmgr again, with success and very same packages updated.

I read an article about physicists being convinced the left handed
people live in a 26-dimensional world and the right-handed ones in an
11-dimensional one, 

barring that explanation, I would say you are for sure right...


But somehow I observed that spooky behaviour of tlmgr
successfully downloading form the Internet (after having
reported "No internet connection") on a laptop where the
WIFI had been turned off ...

Perhaps some Mac OS X person has some idea.


For years I have turned off the WIFI each night on my laptop
to avoid Apple or the NSA sniffing all my data, (or try to
force install a system upgrade; they did manage to upload
10G without my consent for some such upgrade until
I found the hidden location where to turn that off), but
like cell phones I understand now that they are never
off the network even when pretending to be so.


Best,

Jean-Fran?ois

I expressed myself in an unclear way. I meant that establishing WIFI
connection from that location is always a bit complicated, that
the WIFI was off, and for me to turn it on does not mean simply
toggling its status via its menubar icon, it means I have to stand up
walk about 3 meters to the right, turn WIFI on, check it connects
to the right network, and the move back to my initial position.

And this is what I did after having accidentally executed tlmgr
while the WIFI was off. I iterativly CTRL-C'ed it during this WIFI off
phase, because it was acting in a spooky frightening way,
managing to download package without the WIFI officially on.

Only after that did I stand up and moved to turn the WIFI on
and then re-executed tlmgr update --all

Hi,

xii.tex is found there:

$ find /usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist -name 'xii.tex'
/usr/local/texlive/2018/texmf-dist/doc/plain/xii/xii.tex

but

$ kpsewhich xii.tex

returns nothing

and

$ pdftex xii.tex
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.19 (TeX Live 2018) (preloaded format=pdftex)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode
! I can't find file `xii.tex'.
<*> xii.tex


this is contrary to the documentation which says to issue "pdftex xii.tex"

This is a plain TeX file
pdftex xii.tex
to produce a (perhaps) surprising typeset document.

Not sure if that inscrutably frivolous matter justifies me alerting you about it :)

As it's in the documentation tree, you would presumably have to make its 
location your current directory if you wish to avoid giving an explicit 
path to the file ...

Some new experiment:


Step 1: turn off the wifi (I am attaching a screenshot)

Step 2: try tlmgr update --all and hit CTRL-C quickly. Output is sort of as expected

$ tlmgr update --all

Step 3: try again specifying some repository from which some updates were fetched earlier today on some other computer (connected to the internet...)

Strange isn't it ?

But disappointing to me as it did not succeed to connect to the Internet via the 11th dimension.

After that 

Step 4
 
~$ tlmgr update --all --repository http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet

Dear texlive team,

I wanted to install a usepackage for LaTeX using the command


> tlmgr install siunitx

The terminal returened the following:

> (running on Debian, switching to user mode!)
> /usr/bin/tlmgr: Initialization failed (in setup_unix_one):
> /usr/bin/tlmgr: could not find a usable xzdec.
> /usr/bin/tlmgr: Please install xzdec and try again.
> tlmgr: Couldn't set up the necessary programs.
> Installation of packages is not supported.

solving it by myself. If you find time answering me I will be thankfull.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The line above tells you what to do.

Anyway, do you really have TeX Live from TUG, or Debial TL packages? I
am not a Debian user but I would suppose that apt-get should be used
oin the latter case.

    this is contrary to the documentation which says to issue "pdftex xii.tex"

I chose not to install xii.tex and related in the runtime. Unless David
instructs me otherwise, this will not change.  The documentation does
not (and cannot) guarantee that you can run "pdftex xii.tex" in any
context whatsoever.

Obviously, if you run it in the doc directory, or copy the file
somewhere, it works. If one doesn't know enough to do this, the chances
of understanding xii.tex seem extremely small.

    $ kpsewhich xii.tex
    returns nothing

kpsewhich --format=doc xii.tex

Now I'm hurt that you don't think my code is beautifully transparent
and self documenting:-)

Seasons greetings,

This is a good question.  Installing TeX Live from TUG in /usr/bin
is definitely the worst thing one can do.  /usr/local is for local
additions and everything else should be maintained by the package
manager of the Linux distribution.

On the other hand I'm not sure whether tlmgr is provided by Debian at
all which allows to install arbitrary packages.  This would certainly
interfere with Debian's package tool, even though many functions in
tlmgr are very useful.

Maybe Norbert can enlighten us.  On my various Debian machines I
simply mount the multiplatform TeX Live system from TUG and thus have
no experience with Debian TeX Live packages.

Regards,
  Reinhard

 You are running Debian/TeX Live.

Forgot, the correct way is
	apt install texlive-science
or even better
	apt install texlive-full
