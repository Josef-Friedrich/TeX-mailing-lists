... are already on p4 (and also uploaded on CTAN).

Most important recent changes:
1. There is 12 fonts more, mainly tt light (tl), light condensed (tlc)
   and dark (tk)
      lmtk10,  lmtko10
      lmtl10,  lmtlo10
      lmtlc10, lmtlco10
      lmvtk10, lmvtko10
      lmvtl10, lmvtlo10
    plus two fonts apparently missing their oblique counterpart:
      lmro17
      lmtcso10

2. Experimentally, we included proportional digits, but their
   metrics almost surely will be chaned.

3. Apart from Knuthian asymmetric double quotes we introduced double quotes
   without extra space at the sidebearings. The old quotes will be used only
   in substitutions. Here also metrics may need an adjustment, namely,
   kerning pairs.

4. A few new glyph were added, a few glyphs were corrected.

5. Internal PostScript names of the fonts were uniformized (it has 
   something to do with the grouping of OTF files into families).

Kind regards,

So all monospace-not-monospace issues are finally resolved, right?
There were still errors in 0.982 IIRC.

Thank you for returning to this thread! I've also delayed my answer,
but that's because some time was required to study things
carefully.

Well, previous location for this directory was omega/encodings,
which means it was considered compiler-specific rather than
format-specific. So it should go to whichever directory you
select for storing files specific for the omega compiler.
I. e. tex/omega/ and tex/omega/generic look like right places,
while tex/omega/plain doesn't.

> What else, if anything, is omega-specific in the same way?

Browsing an old teTeX 2.0 rpm shows that there were some files in
the omega/plain directory, namely grlccodes.tex, omega.tex and
omega.ini. First 2 files now reside in tex/plain/omega, while the
last one in tex/plain/config.

Note that this directory now contains a bunch of other engine-specific
INI files, which previously resided in their own directories. For me,
this looks like one more disadvantage of the new TDS: may be, placing
various INI files into the same location has nothing wrong by itself,
but I don't think the tex/plain tree (which normally should contain 
only files, compatible with standard plain tex and thus with ALL plain
based formats) is the right place for this purpose.

But in teTeX 2.0 most engine specific directories were almost empty
and contained only configuration files, because all packages compatible
with several engines could be placed into tex/plain or tex/latex
anyway. So I don't see why the new scheme is better and which problems
it resolves.

And even if most engines are really so similar that specific 
directories are not needed, this assumption surely would be wrong
for omega, because omega not only introduces its own primitives, but
also accepts 16-bit characters in its input. That's why most
omega-specific files cannot be processed by other compilers, even if
they look as having a TeX syntax. So, if the initial task was to unify
really similar engines, omega could be unified with aleph/lamed, but
not with tex.

Our previous discussion already allowed to figure out the fact that
we really need a compiler-specific directory for omega and a 
format-specific directory for plain omega. The problem is, that, to
my mind, it would be really difficult to find a logical place for
such directories in terms of TDS 1.1. Really, let's examine, how the
possible solutions can look like:

-- it is possible to create 2 separate directories under texmf/tex,
e. g. tex/omega (compiler-specific) and tex/omegaplain
(format-specific). Note that both directories should be searchable for
omega and lambda. Looks too complex, isn't it?

-- it is also possible to create only one engine-specific
directory (e. g. tex/omega) and put all plain omega specific stuff
into a subdirectory (say, tex/omega/plain). In this case it would
be difficult to understand why there is a separate tree under
texmf/tex for another omega-specific format (i. e. lambda);

-- and, finally, it is also possible to move the whole tex/lambda 
tree into tex/omega, so that the new tex/omega directory will contain
exactly the same files as texmf/omega in previous versions, except
OCP/OTP. This solution would look acceptable for me, but it seems
to break the TDS 1.1 model anyway, and so it might be really easier 
to restore the old texmf/omega directory with all its contents.

> No.  As far as lambda is concerned, the search path looks like this:
> TEXINPUTS.lambda = $TEXMF/tex/{lambda,latex,generic,}//

I understand :) I gave this example just to show that
format-specific packages should go into a format-specific directory just
because they are format-specific rather than because they may contain
any conflicting files. There is no difference between lambda and
plain omega at this point. So, plain omega needs its own format-specific
directory, separate from plain tex.

Well, currently there are no problems with this file, because for
historical reasons it resides in lambda/antomega/ (although
something like omega/generic might be a better location). Currently
antomega contains 2 groups of compiler-specific files which are
placed outside of the lambda directory: hyphenation patterns
and lists of lccode/uccode values for various Unicode characters.

But plain omega doesn't (its search path is exactly the same, as for
plain tex).

We just recently got ourselfs a 64 bit Linux server for doing calculations 
and simulations.

Since it's fairly new noone has started using it, so I've copied an 
existing TL 2004 dist. to it, just to test the speed.

It's damn fast. I cannot remember the specs, but it's at least twice as 
fast as our former fastest server.

But the TL 2004 installation is just for 32 bit, so my question is whether 
the TL source actually has a specific target for 64 bit linux?

Basically the idea is that compiled specifically for this architecture it 
may even be faster.

BTW: are there any standard way of testing the speed of (La)TeX and 
friends in a way such that one can compare it to other peoples results.

Not that I know of, but you can set CFLAGS before running the Build

  CFLAGS=-m64whatever Build

There was a recent thread on this list about just that subject with some

the tests i did on our opteron based machines show that tex runs some 30% faster

usually gcc is good enough to do the "right thing" without -m specific 
options (as long as one passes appropriate -O2 or -O3 or so).

fine-tuning down to -m level will hardly win you even 1% extra 
performance, compared to running native x86_64 vs 32bit emulation, which 
is where the biggest performance gain was when I compiled the native 
x86_64 binaries for the first time.

(Btw, I am ready to compile TL 2005 for x86_64 as soon as you email me the 
procedure to get the whole sources)

Kind regards

who told you that? TL 2004 has properly built (i.e. native) x86_64 
binaries and it installs/runs on x86_64 just fine.

(I am assuming that by "64 bit linux" you mean Linux running on x86_64 
architecture, as not many people are using Itaniums any more...)

TL 2004 is compiled specifically for this architecture and runs much 
faster (Hans Hagen says 30% but on my machine it is at least twice as 
fast, but I have a very "extraordinary" machine :) than running 32bit 
binaries.

ahh, cool. I just didn't have a CD or ISO image near by.

Will try the x86 binaries to see if it gets even better ;-)

Too bad our normal users does not have access to this server, but good for

Ignore that, obviously.

To get the complete TL dev tree, try this:
  rsync -a --exclude Images tug.org::tldevsrc/Build/source.development/
Then run the Build script that is in source.development.

If it doesn't work, let me/us know and we'll try to fix.  If it does

Hi all, especially Sebastian,

we have discussed this last week and decided to delay further discussion
until Sebastian is back again.  I hope he's arrived now and is well.

Sebastian, maybe you want to read the mails in the first part of the
discussion (subject still in this mail);  the question is whether the
"hack" to undefine pdfTeX primitives and store them in \normalPRIMITIVE
should be kept or dropped.  It came up because a package author wondered
whether he was supposed to extend his check, although it was correct, to
check \normalWHATEVER instead.

My opinion is that it should be dropped:

I have some additional question here.  First of all, ifpdf.sty in teTeX
does not test for \normalpdfoutput, but just for \pdfoutput.  Doesn't
that mean that even ifpdf.sty hasn't been adapted to work with this
hack?

Second, citing Karl Berry answering to Morten H?gholm:

What is your view instead, Karl?

ifpdf.sty needs no adaptation.

    What is your view instead, Karl?  

That, what, five or six years of users doing \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
are not "wrong".  I think it's unfair to call it just "sheer luck" or a
"bad assumption" that it worked.  That is (was) absolutely the standard
way to detect whether pdftex was running.  Don't blame users for doing
what everyone said to do, everyone else was doing, and when no
reasonable alternative was available.

Anyway, I've already said all that more than once, and apparently no one
else agrees, so whatever.  We've certainly broken backward compatibility
in other ways in other years, so I suppose there's no overwhelming
reason to keep this sacrosanct.  

As I recall, last year Volker, Hans, Jerzy, and others came back from
BachoTeX saying that we should not start using pdfetex for latex because
of precisely this issue.  At more or less the same time, I independently
suggested this "hack" so that the microtype stuff *could* be available
to latex while keeping \pdfoutput undefined, which seemed the best
compromise possible.

Now that we've had it this way for a year, we've at least given users
some warning and a chance to understand what's coming.  I don't suppose
anybody has cared or made use of it, but it's what we could do.

I do agree that, despite everything, relatively few documents ever did
\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined (or anything else) in the first place -- most
documents I've seen are written knowing whether they are going to
processed via pdflatex or latex/dvips/etc., and don't bother with any
conditionals.

I'd also like to mention that Robert Schlicht graciously agreed to at
least consider changing microtype.sty to test whether the microtype
functionality was present, rather than whether pdftex was running.
Which would eliminate most of the complaints, as far as I can tell.

Enough, got to get back to work or there will never be anything to
release.

I'm sorry, I am just not close enough to this
any more to have  a worthwhile opinion.

Basically, I'm with Karl - it seems more important to
get a release out than tinker at obscure edges.

Uh, nonsense.  The whole point of \pdfoutput from the start was that
it could take two different values.  PDFTeX _never_ was PDF-only.

Maybe I missed it, but I seem to never have received an answer to my
question whether *all* issues with the monospace fonts not being
monospaced are now resolved?  It was still present in 0.98.

I'd like to offer my few cents as a user.

I used almost exclusive latex (for a long time) to get ps output and
pdflatex (more recently) to get pdf. I was thinking, until a few weeks
ago, that latex and pdflatex/pdftex were entirely two different animals.
One annoyance is, of course, you can only include certain graphics
format when you use latex (latex --> dvi --> ps) and other formats when
you use pdflatex directly and therefore, you have to edit the latex
source when you change the compiler. Then I discovered using \ifpdf in
some FAQ. After following this thread, it would seem that as a user,
just use \ifpdf and everything will be fine as invoking *either* latex
or pdflatex are in fact invoking the *same* programme. That is, users
don't need to use the \ifx\pdfoutput\... check *at all*.

I'd happy if this understanding is correct and I'd have learnt something
from following this (and for me, not totally comprehensible) thread.

Regards,
ST

Except in the minds of many, probably most, users.  Users in my lab have 
been quite surprised to learn that you can generate .dvi with pdftex, and 
they don't yet fully trust pdftex, so in most cases, when they want .dvi 
they expect to use tex (and are starting to ask why they see pdfetex in 
log files).  The misconception was reinforced by editors or 
front-ends (4allTeX, WinEDT) that have a button or switch for .dvi or .pdf 
output implemented by switching programs.  Pdftex itself says:

$ pdfetex --help
Usage: pdfetex [OPTION]... [TEXNAME[.tex]] [COMMANDS]
    or: pdfetex [OPTION]... \FIRST-LINE
    or: pdfetex [OPTION]... &FMT ARGS
   Run pdfeTeX on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.pdf.
[...]
output-format=FORMAT   use FORMAT for job output; FORMAT is `dvi' or `pdf'
[...]

Users who don't use command-line tex have no idea where to put
"output-format=dvi".

The principle of one surprise at a time says let users get comfortable 
with seeing pdfetex in logs of jobs that create .dvi files, then spring 
the primitives on them in the next release.  The "\normalPRIMITIVE" hack
lets the few who understand how to use them get on with things, and 
should not be surprised when the "normal" prefix is dropped.

Which would be the 2005 release.


It seems that arguments are mostly exchanged, there's nothing new to be
said.  I just wanted to let you know that Markus Kohm has encouraged me
to bring this up again this week - he's on vacation now -, and to urge
you to do the switch now.

It's up to you to decide; but you should decide.  Not making a decision
because "it's better to do the real work" is bad, since you'll get the
same questions over and over again.

doesn't TeX Live 2004 already have pdfetex engine by default (even to
create DVI), together with the hack to undefine \pdfoutput? so even
this principle suggests to drop the hack this year.

The mk4ht script was rather broken (missing "s and , and extra "). It 
would not even perl compile. And this has been so at least since May. I 
fixed it by hand but maybe checking for the latest TeX4ht might be a 
good idea.

altpdftex has been replaced by simpdftex. My own distro has had this 
for a while. simpdftex supports a different calling syntax. That means 
that having all those altpdf* copies becomes unnecessary. They are 
still there for backward compatibility but can (later) be replaced by a 
script returning

	please call "simpdftex format inputfile"

instead. Later these can be removed and the clutter again diminished. I 
am thinking about when to make this change. Is now a good moment? Then 
we can remove the altpdf* copies next year altogether.

Subject: [tex-live] Very OT: KVM switch (DVI/USB)
Message-ID: <a2dfe7715648cee5094b43226feba5b1@rna.nl>

Dear all,

sorry to bother you with this very OT subject but given my role here I 
think I may be forgiven.

The problem is that my hardware setup to maintain TeX and related is 
becoming very complex. I have to work with 2 hardware architecures 
(powerpc and intel), 2-3 OS versions (10.4, 10.3 and 10.2) in various 
variants (e.g. with and without X11) and 2-3 TeX releases (2003, 2004 
and 2005). And that is only for TeX.

So my desk has become an almost unusable clutter of computers, 
keyboards, mice, etc. I am in need of a high quality KVM-switch (attach 
one DVI screen+USB to multiple computers). As far as I know, 
experiences with these devices are often mixed, e.g. at higher 
resolutions or with USB. I need one to attach my LaCie Photon20Vision 
at 1600x1200 at least to a Mac Cube with a Radeon 7000 with DVI, and a 
Mactel machine (also with a Radeon DVI).

So I am solliciting your help. If you have direct knowledge about 
KVM-switches or you know people who have, please mail me directly with 
actual, first hand, knowledge.

Yours,

G

(KVM = Keyboard, Video, Mouse, but these days it is about DVI+USB)

Yes. The message is adapted from the name of the called deprecated 
script. If you call altpdflatex you get "simpdftex latex input" and if 
you call altpdftex you get "simpdftex tex input". The message is a bit 
larger and empty lines before and after to facilitate finding it in the 
log window of front ends.

I would be happy to use symlinks (btw I did not originally edit this, I 
just kept it as it was. I think Karl originally made the change?) but I 
guess this would not work everywhere. I have no idea. Symlinks are fine 
afaic.

ok - but as far as i see it still doesn't show anything like this (i
symlinked altpdftex to your new simpdftex from P4 repository to test
this):

also, what do you intend to do is user will call one of altpdf*

proceed with generation, or stop and ask to use the new syntax?

Another 'me too'.

I understand that releasing TeX Live 2005 should have highest priority
right now. However, I think the changes needed here are minimal. One
only has to comment '\input pdftex-dvi.tex' in latex.ini and document
the changes. A draft for the latter (partially from teTeX's
documentation):

---------------------------------------
Warning: 

Starting with TeX Live 2004, pdfetex was used as default engine to build
formats (with the exception of plain TeX and omega related formats). In
order to ease this transition, some of the new primitives provided by
pdfTeX have been 'masked'. With TeX Live 2005 this is no longer done.
The advantage of this change is that now packages like microtype.sty can
be used to produce DVI files with the microtypographical extensions from
pdfTeX. However, some TeX macros assume that pdfTeX is running in PDF
generation mode if they detect primitives that pdfTeX has introduced
(e.g. \pdfoutput). This is wrong, since pdfTeX can also be used (and is
used) to generate DVI output. A reliable way of detecting PDF output
mode is implemented in ifpdf.sty which works for plain TeX as well as
LaTeX.

If you have many legacy documents that you cannot change to using
ifpdf.sty, please uncomment '\input pdftex-dvi.tex' in
TEXMFDIST/tex/latex/config/latex.ini and recreate the formats using the
command 'fmtuitl --all'. However, then packages like microtype.sty can
no longer be used when a DVI file is produced.

Stop and ask to use the new syntax. altpdftex and friends must become 
unavailable, they will only be still there as help message. Next year 
they can go.

(Maybe something likewise can be done with the ifpdf mess. Nah, 
probably not).

Thank you, Ralf, for preparing this draft announcement.
It makes it easier to see how users will be affected.

Reading this, I thought perhaps it would be better to revise microtype.sty.

A google search (18 hits) shows that it seems to have very few users.
http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.text.tex/search?q=microtype&start=0&hl=en&

Perhaps the microtype tail is trying to wag the dog.

This is what I thought, when I took a user's point of view.

Hope this helps, in what is clearly a difficult issue.

    Another 'me too'.

Tell you what: if someone feels strongly enough about this to make the
change (yes, it is simple), then that is ok with me.  I don't care to
keep debating it.

For anyone who chooses to do this, my only advice is to explicitly
confirm with Volker, Hans, and Jerzy, since it was partly their concern
with this incompatibility which made pdftex-dvi.tex be used in the first
place.

    A draft for the latter

Thanks Ralf!  That is helpful.
If it is done, then I will incorporate this into the doc.

    The advantage of this change is that now packages like microtype.sty
    can be used

Actually, as I wrote, microtype.sty (or any package) could in principle
be used even with pdftex-dvi.tex enabled -- and perhaps it will even
happen.

One reason for this might be that it could only be used for pdf output
on most systems until recently.  Personally, I knew about pdfcprot for a
while (it only provides character protrusion, but not font expansion),
but I learned about microtype only a couple of months ago.

I suspect that usage of these features (be it with microtype, or with
other packages) will increase in the future.

> Perhaps the microtype tail is trying to wag the dog.

It's not only microtype, it is every package or document that tries to
access pdfTeX's additional primitives.  Now that we have decided to use
pdfTeX as our main engine, we can't say it's just our tail - it's quite
near to our heart.

    I would be happy to use symlinks (btw I did not originally edit this, I 
    just kept it as it was. I think Karl originally made the change?) 

I don't remember editing anything related to simpdftex, or even hearing
the name before yesterday, but it's certainly possible.

    but I guess this would not work everywhere. 
     
There are no alt* or sim* files in bin/win32 now, so I guess it's not an
issue.

    Symlinks are fine afaic.

I think so too.  Please do whatever makes sense ...

should be completely unusable with those syntax errors, but so it goes ...)

Volker, Hans and Jerzy: by switching the engine in 2004, we have done
an incompatible change. pdftex-dvi.tex has failed to "hide" this engine
switch and caused other trouble. teTeX-3.0 is using the pdfetex engine
since feb. 2005 without loading pdftex-dvi.tex and my experience was
that this switch was almost painless.

If you feel uncomfortable with this (after reading my above statement
and the arguments of this thread), please feel free to convince me.

> Thanks Ralf!  That is helpful.

The changed .ini files now have
  % \input pdftex-dvi.tex
in compliance with Ralf's text.

i don't use/need pdftex-dvi.tex so you got my blessing to remove it; i 
remember some discussion on the tex live list with regards to latex 
package writers using all kind of different tests so i cannot foresee 
implications for latex; on the other hand, one year of transition should 
be enough (too many other changes in pdftex anyway) so my guess is that 
you can drop it (maybe keep the file for plain tex users)

No, 'the microtypographical extensions _from_pdfTeX_'. Maybe on could

Both: The 'microtypographical extensions from pdfTeX' which are

On the other hand I do not (and think the same applies to Hans and Volker) 
recall having concerns in this area. There were concerns aired but about 
different things :(  but I think that now it is not the right time to bring 
those forward again---I do not want to have "wanted" letters sent after me :)

One can already use the 'DVIoutput' option of microtype.sty and then use
pdflatex to produce a DVI file, but that makes parallel output of DVI
and PDF at least difficult. Of course, microtype.sty could be changed to
check for one of the not-masked \pdf... primitives first, but I think a
check for the value of \pdfoutput would still be needed, since
microtype.sty as different defaults for PDF and DVI output. I am not
sure if these changes would be ready before the 2005 release ...

There's no contradiction.  pdfTeX is an engine that understands DEK's
TeX typesetting language, but it's not the same as his "tex" program.
And no matter what is closer to your heart,  tex-live (and tetex) don't
use DEK's tex program except for plain tex, they use pdftex.

According to the file itself
(http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf/tex/generic/config/pdftex-dvi.tex),
the following primitves are undefined:

$ grep undefined pdftex-dvi.tex   
%   \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
% we make the undefined primitives available as \normalPRIMITIVE, so
\let\pdfannnot\undefined
\let\pdfhorigin\undefined
\let\pdfinfo\undefined
\let\pdfliteral\undefined
\let\pdfmapfile\undefined
\let\pdfoutput\undefined
\let\pdfpageheight\undefined
\let\pdfpagewidth\undefined
\let\pdftexversion\undefined
\let\pdfvorigin\undefined
\let\pdftexrevision\undefined
\let\pdfxform\undefined
\let\pdfximage\undefined

So there are many more.  On the contrary, the microtypographic
extensions are still defined:

% these public primitives remain usable in dvi mode:
% \pdfadjustspacing
% \pdfavoidoverfull
% \pdffontattr
% \pdffontexpand
% \pdffontname
% \pdffontsize

The problem is that microtype tests for pdftexversion and pdftexrevision
and adjusts its code according to what it finds.  I think that this
approach is just exactly what these primitives are meant for.  It should
be possible to use them for that purpose, and not do strange hacks.

Hi Karl,

I have now built successfully the x86_64 binaries and placed them here:

   http://www.bibles.org.uk/x86_64

The number of files produced was 256 which is roughly the same as in i386 
case (254) so I think everything went OK. But I haven't tested these 
binaries (other than to make sure tex runs:

$ ./tex
This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)

At some point I will switch my environment to it but I haven't got time to 
do it now. But I won't delay it so long as to cause a critical bug to be 
found only at the last minute before release, like I did last time :)

Sorry about this delay. Normally I would respond and do things quicker, 
it's just I was very busy recently...

Here is the uname -a and gcc -v output that you wanted:

just realized that you probably want the content of lib subdirectory as

No problem at all.  Thank you for doing it.  I'm rebuilding the images
now to include it, then will mention it on texhax for testing.  (Gerben,
also got your latest binaries, thanks.)

    just realized that you probably want the content of lib subdirectory as 

Actually, lib doesn't matter, so don't worry about that in the future.
The bin directory is all that is needed.

Then your opinion is irrelevant for the details of accessing pdfeTeX
from LaTeX.

Microtypographic extensions implemented by additional primitives.

Subject: [tex-live] preliminary test image for TeX Live 2005
Message-ID: <200509082150.j88LoTE32345@tug.org>

Greetings,

There are test images available for TeX Live 2005 at:
  http://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/
   ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/ 

If you are of a mind, please try it out.  There are two images,
texlive-inst.iso and texlive-live.iso.  They contain the same material,
but the inst image can only be installed, while the live image can also
be run live, as in past years.

What has been updated:

- hundreds of packages and programs, including the base web2c, kpathsea,
  and (pdfe)tex.  No more major code changes are expected, only bug
  fixes from whatever the testers -- that's you! -- report.  So things
  should be relatively stable in that respect.

- the binaries for i386-linux, x86_64-linux, powerpc-darwin, i386-darwin.

So if you're not using one of those systems, skip it for now.  The other
Unix binaries should be along presently.  The Windows binaries have not
been updated either, so don't bother trying that for now.


Besides the missing architectures, the main thing that is not yet
updated is the documentation.  That is the main task remaining.

In lieu of the real documentation update, here is a super-brief rundown
of the most important changes.  These changes were all made in
teTeX-3.0, and TL is following suit.

- texconfig, updmap, and fmtutil now work in a "user" directory,
  specifically $HOME/.texlive2005/.  If you are installing TL for a
  multi-user system, you can alter the general system configuration by
  running texconfig-sys, updmap-sys, and fmtutil-sys.

- \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined will no longer work to detect whether pdfTeX
  is running.  Use ifpdf.sty or equivalent logic.
  
- the HOMETEXMF configuration variable is now named TEXMFHOME.

If you run into other "surprises" (aka compatibility problems), we'd
like to know.  In particular, we have had very little chance to test
actual (typical) usage of the packages and programs, so reports of any
new and unwanted behavior there would be most welcome.

In general, please email tex-live@tug.org with any problems, questions,
suggestions.

On behalf of all the many, many, contributors,
Karl
TeX Live home page: http://tug/org/texlive


P.S. You may notice that the inst image is too big to fit on a CD.
That's temporary.  Ultimately we plan to release the same thing as in
previous years: the compressed install-only version on CD, the live
version on DVD, plus a dump of CTAN and other material.

Thanks for doing that. Some notes:
- building "inst" image has crashed on my machine (live.iso is OK).
- it seems that some .tpm files weren't properly updated (and, in 
  consequence, list files):
  a) bin-pdftex.tpm contains 2 new items in <TPM:BinPatterns> (altpdfaleph
     and simpdftex) not propagated to specific platforms
  b) plnfss.tpm: DocFiles lists some missing files
  c) tex4ht.tpm: 
  texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts/unicode/cjk/gbksong/#gbksong25.htf# (??)
  (we have also a subdirectory long/ with gbksong.htf, so perhaps
   files names are somehow redundant for tpm build process, or too deep
   directory nesting?). 
Well, when I run separate cleaning of the above a) b) c), things were 
cured (change #8008 submited).

-- install-tl.sh: VARTEXMF is now TEXMFSYSVAR, anyway VARTEXMF still works 
   for that script (backward compatibility ??)

-- lambda generating failed: !Omega capacity exceeded
   (seems that main memory size is too small for lambda)

Ps. Karl, thanks for cleaning all .ini files after that long discussion
concerning dvi 'hacks'. I think that we're both beaten :) on the way 
to the proper and satisfying most users direction ;-)

Best,

Sorry for that. I've spoiled my MakeImages.sh copy by experimental 
additions. My appologies for the noise.
BTW I think that /doc (found on p4) is obsolete and should be removed.
Also, for "inst cd" we could reach the CD capacity leaving only binaries
for 3 most common platforms (win32, i386-linux and mac osx).

there are differences in darwin and linux builds:

darwin builds have no "pdfopen" and "pdfclose"
but they contain "bbox" and "ps2eps" which is absent elsewhere.

could this be fixed?

Thank you for this.

My understanding is that, if you are right, then microtype.sty and
the like are the main beneficiaries of the proposed change.

So it seems, as I understand it, that microtype.sty can be changed.

This seems to me to confirm my original view, that the microtype.sty
tail is wagging the TeX dog.


Somewhat off-topic.  I got the following query today from a user:

A file that used to work is no longer working.

And the user thought it was something he had done.

The problem is due, of course, to LaTeX now using eTeX, which
defines a new primitive \marks.

Bear in mind that this is as per request from the LaTeX authors,
it is not a TeX-Live issue.  Now, "LaTeX" means "eTeX engine + LaTeX  
macros".
Admittedly annoying for your user, but not open for debate here.

I don't see how a LaTeX package should be the beneficiary of anything.
The beneficiaries of the proposed change are LaTeX users who want to use
the microtypographic extensions provided by pdfTeX for DVI output or
especially parallel DVI and PDF output.

I was a bit too optimistic here. As Frank correctly mentioned in his
reply to your message, microtype.sty not only differentiates between DVI
and PDF output, but also between different versions of pdfTeX. This is
necessary since the microtypographic extensions provided by pdfTeX have
changed over the time. It /might/ be possible to adapt microtype.sty to
the primitive-masking in TeX Live 2004, but it sounds very error-prone.

Please not that the reason for building the LaTeX format using pdfTeX
was to enable the microtypographic extensions for DVI output, too. It
now has been realized that masking some of the new primitves provided by
pdfTeX inhibits to a large degree the very purpose of the original
change. Hence, either go back to using eTeX for the LaTeX format or use
an uncrippled pdfTeX.

Relax, this does not concern the TeX lion at all. We are talking about
the LaTeX format here. The plain TeX format is still produced using 'TeX
the program' without any extensions.

    darwin builds have no "pdfopen" and "pdfclose"
    but they contain "bbox" and "ps2eps" which is absent elsewhere.

    could this be fixed?

If Gerben wants to change his stuff to build pdfopen+pdfclose, that's
fine with me.

As for bbox and ps2eps, Gerben had requests from his users to include
them, so they are in the binary sets he delivers to me.  I could remove
them, but what's the point of that?  I see no harm in having them.  (He
also sent me the sources, which are available in /support.)

I certainly don't object in principle to building them for other
architectures, but we need to be reaching stability here.  Building new
binaries always involves lots of hassles.  I don't want to go down that
road right now.

In general, I don't see that these minor discrepancies between arches
are a problem.  Obviously something to minimize, but in my mind it is
not on the critical path.

I was using the name of a package as a shorthand for its users,
developers, and other stakeholders.  As already noted, it seems that
for the microtypography there are few users.

TeX (written by Don Knuth) is renowned for its stability.
Many users value this quality very highly.

It seems that the microtypographic capabilities of pdfTeX have not
reached the same degree of stability.

That plain TeX is unchanged does not allay my concerns regarding the
stability of LaTeX documents.

My concern is that we might be breaking (how many) existing documents,
for the benefit of (how many) users of microtype.sty.

And that there may be a better solution to this evidently continuing
problem.

OK. Gerben, please compile pdfopen and pdfclose for darwin (powerpc
and i386), if it will not be a problem for you.

We will add bbox and ps2eps to the source tree after a release, then,
so in this year's release only darwin builds will have them (and in
those archs who's builders don't mind to build them separately).

Among other discrepancies which would be nice to fix:

* epstopdf in darwin builds differs from what we have in other archs
  (and in the source.development tree). Gerben, why is that? why do
  you not put differences into the common source tree, but prefer to
  have some differences present only in your darwin builds?

* texdoc in darwin builds is outdated. the file in source.development
  was updated on 2005/08/03, so again it is unclear why darwin's
  binaries do not match what is in source tree.

* texi2html in i386-linux was not built from source.development tree
  (see e.g. different settings for $USE_UNICODE if you compare
  texi2html from i386-linux and from some other arch). Why is that?
  Staszek, could you comment why you prefer to not substitute
  texi2html binary from your local copy, and not submit it to
  source.development tree?

Best,
v.

One reason could be that it wasn't usable for DVI output on standard
installations until recently, and still isn't in tex-live 2004.

How do you come to this conclusion?  It's not microtype.sty that is
unstable and error-prone, it's the adaption of microtype.sty to the
hacks that some systems did in the past (and to other possible hacks
other distributions might invent).

Only buggy documents.  And not many, as Thomas Esser has pointed out.

The pdfopen/pdfclose commands need a version of the Reader that is
under direct control of the X11 window manager. Only if that is
true does it makes sense to build the executables  (and even then
i do not dare promise that it will work).

I may be mistaken completely, but I got the impression that
Adobe Reader on the Mac was a native aqua (non-X11) application.

Yes, that's correct. Besides, many Mac users just use TeXShop anyway 
which doesn't have this problem to begin with.

Number of users is pure speculation. Your search gave only 18 hits, here
are two searches which give ten times as many hits:

(microtype OR pdfcprot) -Hefferon -Announcements group:*.text.tex

           Note that pdfcprot.sty also deals with character protrusion
           and is also affected, but IMHO microtype is the better
           interface.

("character protrusion" OR Randausgleich) group:*.text.tex

            '(Optischer) Randausgleich' is the german term for
            'character protrusion' which is one of the microtypographic
            extensions implemented in pdfTeX.

Interestingly, most hits are from d.c.t.t.

With respect to breaking existing documents I would like to repeat that
teTeX made exactly this switch without an one-year warning period. The
number of problems reported on TeX related newsgroups or mailing lists
which I follow has been quite low.

> And that there may be a better solution to this evidently continuing

'Writing additional code because a documented API has been hidden' does

Does OS X need pdfopen/pdfclose at all?  On Win32 they are important 
because you can't write over an open PDF, so if you start pdftex without
remembering that you have the PDF open, you get an error (asking for a
filename). On unix/linux all they can do is save manually reloading the
document.

What happens if the pdf file is being written to a shared disk exported from a
Win32 OS?

instead of a 660, will it materially affect users?

(I have no evidence or even vague ideas about the answer myself.)

We've been producing 700Mb Knoppix CDs by the thousand
for the last few years, like many other people, and have never heard
a whisper of it being an issue.

Ah, that is great to hear.  Given that, I think we should definitely

      a) bin-pdftex.tpm contains 2 new items in <TPM:BinPatterns> (altpdfaleph

Yes, I know.  I fixed that after building the images but didn't think it
was worthwhile to rebuild them right away.  No one cares ...

      b) plnfss.tpm: DocFiles lists some missing files
      c) tex4ht.tpm: 

I don't understand how either of these problems could have happened.
Can't debug at this point since you fixed them :).

There is no limit on directory nesting as far as I know.

Thanks.  Rebuilding images now.

    -- install-tl.sh: VARTEXMF is now TEXMFSYSVAR, anyway VARTEXMF still works

No, that is one backward compatibility I did not intend :).  I tried to
change VARTEXMF to TEXMFSYSVAR, but it seems I did a rather incomplete
job.  Will review it.  Thanks.

I don't understand.  Neither lambda nor omega has changed since last

Can you find out what main_memory size is needed?

(No, Sebastian, I don't think we should just let it stay broken. :)

    Ps. Karl, thanks for cleaning all .ini files 

Thomas is the one who disabled pdftex-dvi.tex.  I continue to disagree
with these repeated characterizations of "broken", "crippled", "buggy",
"hard to program", etc.  But let's not go there :).

    I think that we're both beaten :) on the way

wah, i was not aware that there are non-X11 graphical apps on MAC OS X.

i just noticed that they're not present on some platforms).

so then, i guess, since pdfopen/pdfclose are only useful in connection

I think so, yes. They are absolutely useless on those platforms.

Last time I tried these did not compile on Mac OS X.  They offer a  
specific interface to X11 Acrobat on Linux and family if I recall  
correctly. That will not work on OS X.

Karl was going to add this to TL. If not, they can just be removed  
from the set of binaries I offer (which is taken from my  
redistribution, so the bbox and ps2eps programs are added after a TL  
make install)

Years ago I fixed epstopdf because it was not robust for the mess of  
line endings on Mac OS X. When I offered it to the maintainer(s) I  
got the reply that he/they was working on an overhaul anyway. If have  
in the years after now and then contacted him/them again but nothing  
came from it. I don't remember who it was I mailed with at the time.

I am not inclined to overwrite something in TL when it is part of  
someone else's work, I do not feel I should be that  presumptuous. I  
contact them instead and it is up to them to use it or not. In this  
case, using the original is not possible for me). Besides, I  
generally follow the strategy to get something fixed at the source  
and if that does not work, fix it locally. TL is for me an  
intermediate source for my redistro and fixing it there while it is  
not fixed at the source I find a dangerous strategy because that way  
a fixed bug might suddenly reappear if the original maintainer drops  
in a new version.

This was a leftover of the time that texdoc was not as smart as it is  
now (today with different settings for different systems) and it only  
worked properly on Linux and friends (starting acroread, a bit like  
pdfopen/pdfclose I imagine). In my build Makefile it was still being  
overwritten by a patched old one. I was unaware that texdoc had been  
improved in TL. I have therefore now stopped overwriting for the  
current release (TL2004 still had one that needed patching).

A next build will have the default texdoc. Thanks for spotting this.

I did not look into the sources, but it seems that microtype.sty tries
to support very ancient versions of pdfTeX. 

There had been a change in in character protrusion code (proposed by
Don Knuth) but this was years ago (version 0.13 or 0.14).

I suppose that microtype is quite useless with these old versions of
pdfTeX because people had to create all the tfm files for font
expansion manually before the \autoexpand primitive had been added.

PdfTeX is quite stable.  I use it for a couple of years and I did not
have any problems.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I installed it and it seems to work even with my ancient libc.

The tex4ht stuff seems to be quite out-of-date.  I don't know where it

    The tex4ht stuff seems to be quite out-of-date.  

Specifics, please?

Before I made the image, I updated TL from Eitan's "fix" distribution
dated less than a week ago.  It doesn't get any newer ...

Maybe something went wrong with p4 or in building the image, which
Staszek also mentioned something weird with one of tex4ht's fonts,
which I saw no sign of.  Sigh.

    I don't know where it comes from 

It comes from http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.htm, which
is mirrored at http://tug.org/applications/tex4ht.  (Eitan and I set up
the mirror a few months ago.)

    namely, shall we delete pdfopen/pdfclose (in addition to i386-darwin

They may be useless, but it is extra trouble to delete them.  I don't
want to bother changing the build process.

Anyway, couldn't an alpha-linux pdfopen (in theory) be used to control
an acroread running on a (say) i386-linux server?  Ok, it's not a likely
scenario, but that's what X is all about ...

I must admit that I do not use the latest stuff from the p4 repository
but the latest ISO-image.  There the htf files are from 2004,  though
vntex provides newer ones (now maintained by Eitan).

Maybe the ISO-image is not up-to-date.

i wonder whether during convert, pascal files have to be split into up

convert

splitup_options="-i -l 100000"

then removed pdfetex1...3.c from the Makefile, and it still runs ok.
Would give less .o file clutter.

With nowadays big machines and compilers, is this splitup still

there from 2005.  Also some that are older.  I take whatever Eitan gives
me, it's that simple.

    though vntex provides newer ones (now maintained by Eitan).

Are the new vntex htf's in
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/fix/tex4ht.tar.gz?  That is
what I import.
    
    Maybe the ISO-image is not up-to-date.

I specifically updated tex4ht just before remaking the test image to get
Eitan's latest stuff.

Best,
karl

Hi,
I just downloaded the latest TL using rsync, not p4.  Are they the
same?

configure complains that the texmf tree is not found.  In the Build
script the environment variable $TEXMFMAIN is set properly, but it is
checked only in the toplevel configure script.  The configure scripts
in the subdirs do not test for $TEXMFMAIN and set $texmfmain to the
value of the --datadir option, which causes an error message.

If no program makes use of this variable, I think that I can ignore
the message.  The programs obviously compile properly.

But there is another problem:

allrunes.map is in texmf-dist, not in texmf.  But texmf-dist is

better anyway.  I have a p4 client installed already.

Maybe I should mention that my system is now 5 years old and many
other programs require a newer version of libc.

  > After this year's release, I plan to (a) get back to subversion,

We use subversion for vntex and it turned out to be pretty unstable.
We first used it at sourceforge.  It often produced svnserve processes
doing nothing else than consuming 98% CPU time.  If such a process is
running, nobody can access the repository.

Sometimes it din't work and we had to run "svnadmin recover $REPOS".
This is not a big problem, everything worked then.  We never lost any
data.  But it is quite annoying.

But once I got a "permission denied" message when running "svnadmin
recover" while the file permissions looked ok.

The only solution was to copy everything to my machine, compile a
special version of svn linked to the same version of BerkelyDB as used
at sourceforge and dump the database.

Then I set up a server on my machine.  It works pretty well when I use
it myself.  When Thanh checked out the stuff it was broken again.
Running "svnadmin recover" gave me the error message "permission denied".

I had to run "svnadmin recover" as root and fix the file permissions and
ownerships manually.

We never lost any data.

If you want to use subversion I recommend to install it soon and
create a "sandbox repository" which people can play with.  So you can
get some experience before you switch from p4 to svn.

Despite all the problems we had I think that subversion is a good
thing.  I have no experience with p4 or CVS, I decided to use svn
because it claimed to handle binary files, and in this respect I had
not been disappointed.

Thanks for the hints,
  Reinhard

Yes (modulo a 10-minute cron, which is not an issue here).

    If not, can you tell me how to download it with p4?  Maybe this is

If you're not already familiar with p4, I don't advise going there.
Unless you want to commit changes, there is no gain to it.

    If no program makes use of this variable, I think that I can ignore
    the message.  

Yes, you can ignore the messages about texmfmain.

    The programs obviously compile properly.

Glad to hear it :).

    allrunes.map is in texmf-dist, not in texmf.  But texmf-dist is
    unknown at compile time.

Indeed.  There is no "real" problem here, it's just the bizarre way that
TL is constructed.  The Build script compiles everything and "installs"
it with a prefix of source.development/inst, as you probably realized.

But in order for the newly-made binaries to do anything useful, they
have to be manually moved to Master/bin/somearch and run from there (so
that the TL texmf-dist will be found, not to mention texmf.cnf and
everything else).

The fact that the make install tries to run updmap and complains about
missing maps isn't important.  That's only about the "data" part of the
tree in source.development/inst, which is purely temporary and never
used for anything.  (I make some desultory attempts to sync it with
Master/texmf from time to time.)

Yes, this is all very bizarre and unintuitive.

After this year's release, I plan to (a) get back to subversion, and
(b) write a web page about building TL.

Cheers,
k

P.S. I will be offline tomorrow and Monday.  Back Tuesday.

Did you try the subversion file system (fsfs) instead of the database one (bdb)? We use the fsfs here and so far have no problems

No, thanks for the hint.  Can this be configured by a normal user or
is it a compile-time option?  At sourceforge we are not allowed to
install our own software and I want to move vntex to sf when svn is
supported there.

Hi Reinhard,

> configure complains that the texmf tree is not found.  In the Build

The Build script is just good enough to ensure that everything is compiled
and that the bin directory is set up correctly.

For a "real" installation from the sources, one should pass a --prefix
such that $prefix/share/texmf-dist, $prefix/share/texmf etc. exist.

Why is it that in DVI mode (via LaTeX) then graphicx does not know the 
.mps extension? It's a subset of EPS anyway.

The main problem is when one wants to include METAPOST figures directly 
using pdflatex. These often have extensions like .1, .2, .3 \dots

So the recommendation goes: Use

 	\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}

But that fails when one wants to compile ones document using LaTeX instead 
of pdfLaTeX. So one needs

\usepackage{ifpdf}

\ifpdf
\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}
\fi

Is there any reasons for you not to include mps as one of the formats 
recognized by graphicx in dvi mode? (I cannot remember which file it is 
that needs to be changed a little).

(I've just tested it with the latest 2005 TL beta so I know the problem 
still exists).

Dear all,

I still believe that TL2005 can (and should) have win32 binaries
and I hope we will have recent compilation for at least some of the most
changed programs (pdfetex, mpost, dvipdfmx).
I've just added the win32 installer to MakeImages.sh:
tlpmgui.exe is a tcl based gui which uses logic similar to 
install-tl.sh (it works with schemes and collections, moreover
it makes some postprocessing, like setting the environment variables).
The gui installer uses tlpm.exe as an engine, and the main problem is that
engine works only for "inst" CD (ziped archives, specific layout of the 
"inst" CD-ROM).
As nobody wanted to adapt tlpm to the "live" DVD, we cannnot offer
any installer for that at the moment.
Anyway, please try tlpmgui for "inst" CD (should be at the place
after next iso rebuild).

All the best,

While on the subject of things to fix: can we have the texmf.cnf files as
synchronized as possible?

Currently, there is one in Master and there is one generated by "make
install".

Currently, the one in Master is leading. In my opinion, the one from make
install should be leading. That one should (when it changes) be installed
in Master. But either way, they should both be the same.

Hi,

I am working on a small documentation project, which is already
in a good shape for about twenty languages (mostly Western
European, but also Russian and Ukranian), but I have problems
with some other languages.  I use the texlive distribution for
Debian GNU/Linux.  My first question is about Greek.  The text
I prepare contains both Greek and Latin text in UTF-8 encoding.
Why is LaTeX confused about the attached input?

Many thanks in advance for any help!

utf8 is a (huge) *input* encoding.

the greek babel language uses its own *output* greek encoding (LGR) 
which is a 8 bit encoding (latex doen't support more anyway).

in the LGR encoding, there are no latin chars at all. In the place of 
the standard a ("61) there is an alpha (etc.)

So as long as you are in the greek language, the "a" input will give you 
an alpha.

utf8/ucs allow you to type directly  <alpha> in your input file, that's 
all : this alpha is mapped to the command \textalpha which is defined by 
\DeclareTextSymbol{\textalpha}{LGR}{"61} in ucsencs.def.

But in order to get latin chars you have to go back to the T1 encoding 
(that's what do \textlatin)

Is there a way to let LaTeX do this automatically?  In the input
file, the characters are entirely different, so in theory it
should be possible for LaTeX to deduce the right mapping, right?
Why is the command \textlatin{} not necessary for Russian or
Ukranian text mixed with English?  It should be similar to
Greek, but works without the additional command.

Well, you question is a good chance for me to promote Omega and
my antomega package :) Standard tex compiler implies too many
limitations related with its 8-bit codepages. Normally, you have
to switch between output codepages manually. If you don't
like this, you should use Unicode both in your input and output.
This is possible with omega/lambda, but not with tex/latex.

Because standard Cyrillic encodings contain both Cyrillic and
Latin characters, while the de facto Greek encoding contains
only Greek ones. You know, there are too many accented characters
in polytonic Greek, and so after mapping all them there is just no 
place remaining for Latin characters.

However, support for Latin characters in Cyrillic codepages is
also limited: you still can't type language-specific symbols
(like German double "s" or the "ae" ligature) without switching
to a Latin codepage (e. g. T1).

I am not a TeX guru, but as it was explained, here we deal with basic 
ascii chars, say "d". I don't see any way to get "d" be something else 
that to be simply "d", apart to make "d" active, and define it in such a 
way that it will switch to the standard encoding...

But if one do that, think to what will happen to the \def command...
                                                       ^

And of course calling an input encoding may define the behaviour of not 
"standard" chars, but must *not* change the behaviour of standard chars.

This sounds interesting.  Could you please point me to an FAQ
list or any other web resource?  I only found somewhat outdated
pages.

Interesting.  My source documents are in DocBook XML format and
converted into LaTeX with the db2latex-xsl stylesheets.  Is
there something similar for omega?

OK, now I understand.  I just didn't know, that Greek is so
complex.

Fortunately not so important for very current and purely

That sounds difficult enough to scare me away :-) I will try to
get the \textlatin{} command into my text.  (Which is a little
bit complicated, as my LaTeX is generated from DocBook XML using
db2latex-xsl.)

even if you would have a straight input -> font mapping, you still have to supply info about what you're doing / expecting. The simple fact that you refer to an (greek) alpha [e.g. using unicode] says nothing about what is expected: greek text (to be treated as greek), a greek character  used in a latin context, a math symbol, a physics particle indicator, etc. So, in practice, when you want properly typeset documents, an input source will never be (utf) chars only, but have structure / indicators as well, and those are to be/ can be used a trigger points for special typesettign features (like fon switched); also, afaik there are no fonts that cover the whole range of unicode, so some kind of managament is always needed.

That is right, of course.  In my special case it is simpler, because I
have a text in one main language (e.g. Greek) with only some literal
words (UNIX commands, URLs, ...) to be treated like English.

I think, I have to wrap the English stuff anyway, as it is necessary
for RTL languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi) - the URLs still have to be
LTR.

Unfortunately, there is no relevant resource, because Omega developers
don't care about such things, and the whole project looks abandoned.
Nevertheless, the existing version of omega compiler is quite stable
and has great advantages in comparison with tex/latex. 

Again, unfortunately, currently you can't use omega out of box (e. g.
after installing teTeX or TL), because omega's texmf part is broken for
a long time, and developers aren't interested in fixing it. My antomega
package is an attempt to correct this situation by providing a working
multilingual support tool (similar to Babel, but oriented especially to
Omega/Lambda). You can find more information about it in antomega manual
(available on CTAN at
systems/omega/contrib/antomega/doc/omega/antomega/antomega.pdf).

Basically, omega is a Unicode-enabled version of TeX, and lambda
is a latex-based format for omega. So if you document is UTF-8 
encoded and has a latex syntax, then it probably should be already
compatible with antomega. Only preamble needs to be changed.

this time, I like to know about the Hebrew support in texlive.
The attached file translates well with tetex + ivritex, but
texlive for Debian seems not to have everything that is needed,

I just read briefly through the document.  What languages are

This sounds better :-)

As I'm only an end-user of both tetex and texlive, (how) can I
just use antomega, e.g. by installing texlive?

I checked the stretch and shrink parameters in all lmtt TFM files from
version 0.98.3: they look correct, now (i.e., zero).

Ugh. For some reason,
ftp://ftp.loria.fr/pub/unix/tex/ctan/help/Catalogue/entries/lm.html
pretends to give you version 0.99.2 but the link
ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm.zip it presents you
points to version 0.98.3, which is why I didn't check the last version.

So, in 0.99.2, the stretch and shrink parameters are still correct *but*
tftopl says:

  Bad TFM file: Parenthesis in string has been changed to slash.

The parentheses in question are those in:

  EC Encoding (Cork)
  TS1 Encoding (text companion for EC)
  LY1 Encoding (TeX'n'ANSI, Y&Y)
  T5 Encoding (Vietnamese)

(these strings can be found by looking at the TFM files with less). I
suppose this should be fixed.

Hello,
I read with interest the new info on TeXLive 2005.
Sorry to bother you, but I can't tell from what's there whether
there will be an installable windows version included. It said that
the windows binaries were not ready yet, and I was hoping that,
since there were several preliminary installers contributed during

(I do miss fptex and I'm still using TL2003.)

If not, do you know whether a ProTeXt CD will be included like last
year?
Thanks for any info,

Have you ever considered aleph/lamed instead of tex/omega? Would
antomega work together with aleph/lamed?

AFAIR aleph is a bit more supported and worked on, while omega seems to
be rather dead (unfortunately John and Yannis seem to invent always new
things without finishing started stuff!).

Hmmm... The main problem is that omega, lambda, and even antomega still
haven't good and *exact* specification. As for distributions like teTeX or
TL we had always problems which files belong to the separate and well
distingushed packages, which files were borowed and/or changed from each
other, etc. We tried our best to clean that mess and this problem was
often reported on that list (but without special reaction). Anyway, I'm so
glad that (at least) antomega is still alive and I believe that with
your help, Alexej, we will find any good consent.

As I see, this document is somehow outdated in regard of the thread
already discussed here [Omega and the recent changes in TDS], so perhaps
it would be fine to adapt it to (some) conclussions taken. It is not clear
difference between lambda and lambda+antomega (e.g. the later uses
specific hyphen.cfg; if so, we need separate command/link to invoke
antomega). Can antomega be run with aleph (lamed), which is considered as
runable and enough (as the users say) stable omega based engine?
There are much more such questions... Unfortunatelly, we have so weak
input from people using such tools.

Please also have in mind that all distributions, like teTeX, TL, MiKTeX,
consist of hundreds of packages, so without good specification very few 
people involved in preparation of those distributions are somehow lost.

Best wishes,

Martin, you may have missed the point.

My problem is not the lack of stability of these features.
After all, I do not use them.

My problem is that as a side effect of enabling these features,
documents that previously worked might be broken.

And these are documents that do not use these features.

I don't think I've got anything to add, beyond this.

I have already suggested that microtype.sty be revised.

Another suggestion is to do nothing.
This follows the principle "First, do no harm".

Finally, we could understand how the problem arose.
And then address those causes.
Which doubtless still exist.

I don't think I have anything more to say on this.

Not too hard to do, I guess.  I can't see that you even have a point.

No.  Documents that previously worked did not enable the features, so

Then how could they break?

I am unsure I understood this. Can you explain what do you call "exact
specification"? At least I suppose I do my best to keep antomega as
well distinguished as possible by giving unique names to all my files
and placing them to unique directories. If this is not sufficient,
please tell me what else should be done in order to simplify including
antomega into an official distribution like TL.

For now, no acceptable solution has been found for the problem I
described in that thread. I am still awaiting an answer from Karl
and others and hope the problem can be resolved soon. May be I
have to initiate a similar discussion in the TDS list too.

> It  is not clear difference between lambda and lambda+antomega (e.g.

Well, antomega can be turned into a separate format if it
is considered necessary. However, I can easily explain the reasons
for which I still haven't made this step:

-- as long as antomega is not available by default in all major 
TeX distributions, any necessity of creating additional links/commands
may make the package installation too complex for an average user.
Of course things may change if antomega ever gets included into TL;

-- the default lambda format (without antomega) should be considered
practically useless anyway. Note that at the old times when Omega had
its own (although imperfect) multilingual support package, it was
distributed with a special version of hyphen.cfg. Since this file is no
longer present in modern distributions, babel's hyphen.cfg usually
gets loaded into format by default. Most commands defined in that
file are not only useless in Omega context, but even explicitly
contradict to principles Omega is based on. 

So antomega just does the job which normally would be performed
by lambda's own texmf stuff if it was not broken. Since I can hardly
imagine anybody who really needs a lambda format with babel's
commands, replacing babel's hyphen.cfg with antomega's file probably
doesn't hurt.

> Can antomega be run with aleph (lamed), which is 
> considered as runable and enough (as the users say) stable omega

To my surprise, it can't, because processing some of my OCP rules
(absolutely correct to my mind) causes compilation errors! I suppose
this is a bug in aleph, but probably I have to ask in the alpeh mailing
list.

Well, I should admit I know very few about Arabic or Chinese.
Antomega is oriented to european languages with a special 
stress on Greek and Cyrillic alphabets. I know that Omega itself
has a quite good support for RTL scripts, so I think antomega
can easily be adapted to languages like Arabic or Hebrew if
somebody helps me to do that. Of course you also need a Unicode
font covering all necessary characters, and this font should
already be adapted to Omega. AFAIK, an Omega-specific Arabic font is 
already available in the default Omega distribution (and thus
also in teTeX and TL).

You should install antomega as any other TeX package, i. e.
download it from CTAN, and copy the files (preserving their
directory structure) into one of your texmf trees. After that,
you have to rebuild the lambda format (e. g. by running

fmtutil --byfmt lambda

). Additionally, I have to warn you that currently there is a small
incompatibility in directory structure between antomega and teTeX/TL.
I hope this problem can be resolved soon, but for now you have
to edit manually search paths for omega and lambda in your texmf.cnf.
I hope there is nothing difficult in these operations.

Hi Alexej,

    For now, no acceptable solution has been found for the problem I
    described in that thread. 

Despite reading and rereading all the many messages many times over, I
am still not clear on the actual, immediate, practical, problems.  That
is one of the reasons I've been so laggard in replying.

There are so many things being discussed that I am not straight on which
things are "this change xxx would be nice" and which are "this change
yyy is necessary or antomega doesn't work".

The one problem I do understand is that you cannot test for the
existence of an OCP because they are no longer in the input path.  I
think the simplest fix for that is to add $TEXMF/omega/ocp to TEXINPUTS
for omega and lambda.  Will that suffice for you?

Can you please briefly recap any other changes to the search paths,
directory structure, or whatever, are needed so that antomega will work?
Don't bother re-explaining the theory, problems with the TDS, etc.  I
understand the theory.  What I don't understand is what changes you
actually need to have made.

Thanks,
Karl

I mean that people would receive just plain text file what was changed,

What to do with, e.g., tex/lambda/base/UT1omlgc.fd? Should it be rather
ut1omlgc.fd, as you've described in your manual? Morever, if you could try
the current TDS recommendations (I know, still not perfect), your package
would be more easy to install, as well to incorporate to the current
distributions.

Well, the best way is to cleaning all files relating omega, lambda
and antomega, and againg refreshing them from CTAN (which should be
the only source for TL, howgh!). I'm ready for doing that, but please
do not beat me if I don't include things not documented or not more 
supported, like those from R. Pournader and A. Syropoulos, etc.

Well, well.. Have you noticed that even TL2004 produced lambda.fmt using
your hyphen.cfg (from antomega)? Anyway (but only after your
explanations), I'm quite sure that antomega should be propagated as
*standard* for all distributions. It is no problem for adding
TEXINPUTS/omega/ocp, as Karl decribed in the other mail...

Ahh, really bad news. Could somebody using aleph comment that?

Karl,

according to your explanation, the main idea behind the changes between
TDS 1.0 and 1.1 was removing engine-specific directories, because they
were considered unneeded. I tried to explain that this assumption was
wrong in regards to omega, because omega does need a place for files not
bound to a specific format.

This is the main problem. As far as there is no such directory defined
in TDS, I can't make antomega conform to the TDS recommendations,
because I don't know WHERE should I put files which currently reside
outside of the lambda tree (e. g. hyphenation patterns).

As you can see, this is a practical problem, but I don't think a 
reasonable solution can be found without discussing the TDS theory.
And of course I think this should be a long-time solution, which 
would prevent any similar problems in future. I don't like
quick hacks (e. g. "put your files wherever you want and forgot it").

    Well, the best way is to cleaning all files relating omega, lambda
    and antomega, and againg refreshing them from CTAN (which should be
    the only source for TL, howgh!). I'm ready for doing that, but please
    do not beat me if I don't include things not documented or not more 
    supported, like those from R. Pournader and A. Syropoulos, etc.

I do not think we should do this at this late date.  Just let the status
remain quo.

The whole Omega/etc. situation will never be satisfactory until it is
actively maintained.  Until then, all we can do is limp along and try
not to break whatever use people have been making of it.

    Anyway (but only after your explanations), I'm quite sure that
    antomega should be propagated as *standard* for all distributions.

I agree.

Should I call this file "SPECIFICATION" and put it into the
package root? Anyway, even if I add such recommendations, they
would surely be quite simple, because everything in the package
should be just copied to the main texmf tree one-to-one. At
least it was so before TDS 1.1 was released and I hope it will
be so in future. There are no conflicting files. The only
exception is my language.dat.sample file which should be merged
with omega's default language.dat.

Good idea. I'll consider adding such a file in the next release.

Of course I would prefer this file to be named ut1omlgc.fd,
just to comply to naming conventions applied to other *.fd files,
where encoding name is usually written in lowercase. However,
antomega will accept both UT1omlgc.fd and ut1omlgc.fd.

I have already explained why it is impossible for now. For example,
the current TDS doesn't provide a relevant place for storing
omega-specific hyphenation files. I hope this problem can be
resolved somewhere.

I agree with Karl that this cleanup should not be too radical.
However, some things surely can be removed (like *.bgd and *.lay
files, remaining from the old time when omega.sty supported them), and
some moved to more appropriate directories. This is the case of
otibet, ocherokee etc: i don't think lambda/base is a correct
place for package-specific files. There are also some font-specific
*.cfg files, which have a non-tex syntax and so without any doubt
should be placed to the omega directory (even according to TDS 1.1).

Damn. Aleph really seems to do something quite strange with the OCP
buffer. I'll post a question to the aleph mailing list.

not only omega (aleph), if i remember right, xetex (the mac thing, but 
it may become cross platform in a few years) also needs some specific 
files, e.g. unicode mapping resources

i didn't follow the discussion closely, but i think that part of the 
reason for removing the engine paths was that there ws a danger for 
duplicate trees in there

  omega/tex omega/latex  ...

now, another option is to have something

  tex/generic/omega
  tex/latex/omega

that way the parent structure remains simple

it's mainly an ordering issue since macro packages can check what engine 
is used, they can load specific files anyway

now, with regards to 'non tex files', i wonder if it makes sense to let 
kpse search in the texinputs path for such files;

also, you mention hyphenation files ... these are just tex files, so you 
can put them in for instance

  tex/generic/antomega/generic

the fact that there is a generic pattern path does not mean that you 
cannot put patterns someplace else esp when they are not generic at all; 
actually, even the generic patterns are not generic -)

base is for macro packages, isn't it? maybe

texmf/tex/omega/patterns

in the case of specific patterns for context + omega, i'd put them in

texmf/tex/context/patterns (/omega)

unless those omega patterns are really generic (never seen them)

anyhow, as long as anthomega is able to locate them anything is ok

indeed, actually, if antomega is something very special, why not consider it a macro package in itself (if it borrows from oter packages, fine, but that not uncommon i think)  

texmf/tex/antomega/base (and if needed: texmf/tex/antomega/patterns) 

things; sounds best to me since then the author is free/responsible for what comes under it; antomega as subpath can never conflict with future omega then also add a progname 'antomega' entry in the cnf file so that it comes with its own input path:

texinputs.antomega=.....
 
the more i think of it ... it's not an engine issue, more a macro package issue; it actually has nothing to do with engines (esp because it probbably also works ok with aleph which is another engine -)

Hello Harriet,

    there will be an installable windows version included. 

There will at least be an installer for the inst version.  It should be
in the next pretest.  Whether there will be an installer for the live
version is not clear yet.

    since there were several preliminary installers contributed during

There is one cmdline installer for Windows; as I understand it, it works
only with inst.  Then there is a TCL-based installer built on top of
that, so it also works only with Windows.

Then there is the Python-based one, which works on live, but I am not
sure if it will actually be usable.  The author hasn't replied to my
last couple emails, but I have hopes he's just away for a few days,
since he was very responsive before.

There are other projects in an even vaguer state.

    If not, do you know whether a ProTeXt CD will be included like last
    year?

Yes, there will be an updated proTeXt this year, regardless of what
happens with the TL windows installers.

Best,
Karl

Hi Lars,

    Is there any reasons for you not to include mps as one of the formats

I am not sure who is responsible for graphicx these days (Morten, can

This doesn't seem like something we should change on our own.
Maybe report the problem in the LaTeX bug database?

Sorry & thanks,

    But either way, they [texmf.cnf's] should both be the same.

My memory from last year is that the one from make install is used by
you, there is another one used by Thomas, and the one in Master used by
TL.  And they were all intentionally different.  I just did some
synchronization, will check again.

In general, there is no automated way to update the results of make
install into the Master tree, and doing that is a long ways off, if
ever.  For now, I check and update things by hand, since there is no
alternative.

I spent several hours trying to repair antomega for *all* 
distributions, but sorry, I've failed. As I've already wrote, such package
should be clearly defined and separate for installation, but it seems
it cannot. Alexej, sorry, but your hints from the documentation cannot
be applied for the distributions like teTeX, TL or MiKTeX. According to your
notes, it is possible to install antomega, but only using some same
directories already in use, so it could break any packaging concept.

Just some terse notes from the poor packager's point of view
(ctan:/systems/omega/contrib/antomega/):

doc/omega/antomega/ 
why not doc/lambda/antomega/ (?)

omega/hyphen/ -> tex/lambda/antomega/hyphen/ 
(or tex/generic/antomega/hyphen in the case that it will work with 
e.g. aleph, or context, as Hans stated?)

omega/lambda/antomega/ -> tex/lambda/antomega (?)

omega/lambda/base/
omega/lambda/config/
omega/lambda/encodings/
even if all the above is moved to tex/lambda/, it means that everybody 
can agree that lambda without antomega is unusable, so only in such
case you can put your files and mix them with lambda. I wrote about that...

omega/ocp/antomega/
OK

omega/ocp/char2uni/
omega/ocp/uni2char/
Not consequent with the above! Should be rather omega/ocp/antomega/uni2char ?

omega/otp/antomega/
OK

omega/otp/char2uni/
omega/otp/uni2char/
The same as above (not consequent).

omega/unidata/
The same as above (not consequent).

source/omega/antomega/
Rather source/lambda/antomega/ I think.

As you can imagine, your layout breaks any packaging concept (clear
distinction from omega/lambda). I know that's easier to add any file
to the local tree, but sorry, we cannot get that way for distributions
(we have some hundreds of packages).

if the search paths are set as:

texinputs.antomega => .....tex/{...,antomega,lambda,...}

they can share files (even with similar names) but no clashes

that's indeed the question that needs an answer

made difficult by the fact that all omega's are different, omega is 
obsolete, aleph is present, etc etc

think of this: aleph is omega with etex, so if antomega would share code 
with other packages that depend on etex ... again an argument against 
using the engine name here

texmf/antomega/config
texmf/tex/antomega/base
texmf/tex/antomega/encodings (or: texmf/fonts/enc/antomega)

why an engine path? ocp's are so related to input and basically tex file

tex/antomega/ocp (no reason for subdivision)

they are just tex input files

btw, i lost track of what role lambda plays in this, or actually, i lost track of what role omega playe here as well -)

No, there were no such paths. Remember that omega compiler, plain
omega and lambda are counterparts of tex compiler, plain tex and latex.
(And antomega is similar to babel, if we continue this
comparison). So in the older TDS the omega directory was at the same
level of texmf tree as the tex directory and mostly followed its
structure (with one significant difference: omega/lambda corresponded to
tex/latex). So having something like omega/tex would be as illogical and
impossible, as, say, omega/omega.

And of course the whole omega directory was intended only for
compiler-specific files, because everything compatible with various
engines could be placed into tex/{generic,plain,latex}. So I don't
understand what is the danger for duplicate trees you are speaking
about.

This surely would be correct for hyphenation patterns in "generic"
format. However, you miss the fact that antomega's hyphenation patterns
are 16-bit and thus can be used only with omega or aleph. So
they should not be placed into the generic directory, which is
world-searchable. Karl already proposed something like 
tex/omega/generic/; this surely would be better, but still much
worse than the oler TDS structure.

Dear friends!
 
Current Version: 2005.09.15-1

A new generation of Debian packages of TeX live are available on the tug

and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

The binary packages are build in a pbuilder/sid environment (Neil, here
it really worked, I don't understand what happened at you pbuilder!).
So the binary packages are only working for sid, but I hope to make
packages for sarge and etch soon.

As usual, the log files of the creation process are in 
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
The file lintian.log shows that the errors/warnings are getting less.
THe two errors now present are rubbish, lintian is stupid on this.

Other thing:

Yes, you have proposed this solution, and in my last reply into the
"Omega and the recent changes TDS" thread I described several possible
conventions regarding this directory with the hope that more detailed
discussion will follow.

However, remember that, if you agree to create a directory like
tex/omega, this means you are creating a compiler-specific tree 
(not just a temporary storage for hyphenation patterns), i. e. 
something explicitly prohibited by TDS 1.1. And of course this 
directory will at least partially mirror the structure of its 
top-level texmf/tex tree, as previously texmf/omega did. For
example, the following directory structure would look more or less
acceptable for me:

tex/
	omega/
		plain/
			base/
		generic/
			config/
			encodings/ (moved from tex/generic)
			hyphen/

Still there are several questions remaining:

-- what to do with the existing lambda directory (I would prefer
to turn it into tex/omega/lambda/, because all lambda-specific
stuff is bound *first* to the omega (or aleph) compiler, and *then*
to the lambda (or lamed) format);

-- why this directory structure is better than older texmf/omega tree?

> You say "e.g." which implies there are other files involved.  What
> are they?

I already answered that, except hyphenation patterns, I have a group
of files used to set \catcode, \lccode and \uccode for various Unicode
characters. I also think I have to modify my hyphen.cfg to make it
compatible with plain omega, so that it should be moved from 
lambda/antomega to, say, tex/omega/generic/config (or, if you wish,
tex/omega/generic/antomega).

ok, not in the strict sense; what i meant to say was that they are part of the way the input is handled and therefore may have a relationship with macro packages of philosophies or handling particular input; in that sense i can imagine that they are organized at the tex input files level since i can imagine macro packages shipping with their own variants (in the end the macro package takes care of loading them)

hmm, that is not quite easy, when one does not understand the specific 
configuration files.

It may be that the change is too large, and tha tit may affect too many 
people.

The involved files are dvips.def and grapgics.cfg AFAIK. But I haven't yet 
been able to create a setup that will recognize MPS in dvi-mode.

I'll keep reading / trying.

hey, this is the same as wanting to put TFM files into TeX search
path: doesn't make sense (except for checking the existance of files;
but this is IMHO an invalid reason to do: better to create some
extension to allow to check existance based on e.g. kpse request, as
was discussed; or not care about this at all - in the correct
installation if some TeX file is installed, then all accompanying TFMs
or OCPs will be installed too, so checking for existance is useless).

Best,

Message-ID: <20050917135052.GH2944@preusse>

Hi Thomas, hi TeX Live team,

the following bug we got here down in the Debian Bug Tracking system.
During the discussion it came to our attention, that the dvipdfm
development has stalled and the upstream can assumed to be dead (last
version was released in 2001, the ML of the project got 3 mails last
year and probably none in this year.
Frank then pointed to the project dvipdfmx, which is an extension of
dvipdfm and actively developed (we got very fast responses from the
maintainers). They said, dvipdfmx can be used as replacement of
dvipdfm as it is fully compatible.

Please consider to drop dvipdfm in favor of dvipdfmx!

Regards,
  Hilmar

Hi,

I am producing some reports using latex and dvipdfm. They all include
the same EPS graphics, and it worked well for years. 

But since last debian upgrade, dvipdfm terminates with this 
error message:

[1(../../../../Common/Doku/logo4c.eps<PS>Invalid PDF name
"HKS#2043#20K"

pdf_new_name:  invalid PDF name



I have tracked this down to:

- The EPS contains a command like

  1 0.75 0 0 (HKS 43 K) false newcmykcustomcolor


- dvipdfm calls gs to convert included EPS into
  PDF. Latest version of gs-eps produces a PDF file 
  with 

  [/Separation
  /HKS#2043#20K
  /DeviceCMYK
  9 0 R]endobj
  10 0 obj


  That HKS#2043#20K name is understood by every pdf application 
  except dvipdfm. 



If I modify (HKS 43 K) into (HKS43K) in the eps, everything
works again. So it is a problem of the Space characters, 
the way gs convertes them, and dvipdfm not understanding them.

Funny thing.  I asked the fmx maintainers the same thing, about
completely dropping fm in favor of fmx in TL, and they advised me not
to do so.  fm had additional programs (ebb and something else), and
different behavior in some cases.  They hoped to make it completely
compatible soon, so we could drop fm next time around.  At least that
was my understanding ...

First, I am really wondering why the same strict approach is 
not applied to packages like otibet or ocherokee, so that their
files are now installed into tex/lambda/base, although they don't
belong to the official omega distribution. Second (and more important),
I don't think that placing files of a specific package into its
own directory is really always needed to keep "clear distinction"
between packages. On Unix, executable files and libraries are
always installed into the same shared directories, and this doesn't
cause any problems. In texmf tree I would prefer to have similar
shared directories for some kinds of files (see the example with
hyphenation patterns below).

> doc/omega/antomega/
> why not doc/lambda/antomega/ (?)

First, my opinion is that having a directory like doc/lambda is
hardly acceptable by itself. Lambda is an extension for omega, so 
that all lambda specific stuff should go into a common omega tree. 
Thus doc/omega/lambda would be OK; doc/lambda is illogical.

Second, I would accept doc/omega/lambda/antomega as a possible
location for antomega documentation, if antomega was just a
lambda-specific package. However, I have already explained that
some of files provided by antomega can be used with any omega-based
format, and I think (especially after this discussion :) I
really have to provide a better support for plain omega. This
is similar to Babel, which is oriented mainly to latex, but, 
nevertheless, is considered a "generic" package.

So I think doc/omega/antomega is the correct location for
my documentation and should not be changed. Of course the
same reasons are applicable to the 'source' directory.

> omega/hyphen/ -> tex/lambda/antomega/hyphen/
> (or tex/generic/antomega/hyphen in the case that it will work with

Both locations are inacceptable: lambda/antomega/hyphen/ -- because 
this placement would be format specific, while the hyphenation 
patterns are rather compiler specific; generic/antomega/hyphen --
because this directory would be, on the contrary, world-searchable,
i. e. accessible not only for omega and its formats.

In general, I would prefer to have a generic (but compiler-specific)
directory for hyphenation patterns, e. g. tex/omega/generic/hyphen. 
This would be especially reasonable, because, if any hyphenation
patterns are present in the distribution, they should be listed
in the common languages.dat file anyway, so that it is really difficult
to keep distinction between packages here. Also note that in teTeX
there are already some omega-specific hyphenation patterns (cherokee,
inuit...), which surely need a better location than lambda/base.

> omega/lambda/base/

This directory contains one single file, called languages.dat.sample,
and I have already explained that it should be merged with omega's
default languages.dat.

Encoding descriptions probably can be moved to lambda/antomega.
I'll think over it.

It *is* consequent. Here I follow the convention introduced by
omega developers themselves, who separated their OCP's (and OTP's as
well) between 3 directories: 'char2uni', 'uni2char' and 'omega'. The
first 2 directories contain files responsible for standard
charset-to-charset conversion. The last directory is package-specific:
the OCP's stored here are used to perform ligature substitutions or
similar things. These files may also produce TeX/Omega command
sequences in their output, so that they can be used only by package
where these command sequences are defined.

Note that this later directory is named 'omega' not because of
its relation with the omega compiler (this would be trivial), but
because it was used by the omega.sty package until it was broken.
That's why I have also distributed my OCP's between 'char2uni',
'uni2char' and 'antomega'. If you wish, I can move everything in
omega/ocp/char2uni/ to omega/ocp/char2uni/antomega (and the same
thing for omega/ocp/uni2char), but placing these files into

Like the hyphenation patterns, this directory is compiler-specific, 
not format-specific. An acceptable location would be something like 
tex/omega/generic/antomega/unidata, but exact placement of
compiler-specific files is still subject to discussion.

It seems that xdvik 22.84.10 (t1lib 5.01) has broken invocation
for generating some missing fonts available only in .mf sources (so not
listed in psfonts.map). Please try removing some font from psfons.map, 
which can be also available in the .mf source.
I've compiled xdvi for TL2005 with Xaw toolkit for i386-linux 
(for portability reasons).

Well, I just have has a closer look at antomega, and if we put everything
aside and just try to see how this would fit into TDS-1.1, I come to
the following conclusions:
  - antomega provides its own hyphen.cfg, so is classifies as a format
    of its own
  - ocp / otp files belong to omega/ocp/antomega resp. omega/otp/antomega
  - the package needs some support for finding files in omega// (to be
    able to check for existance of some files)

So, I would end with the following in texmf.cnf
  TEXINPUTS.antomega = .;$TEXMF/{tex/{antomega,lambda,latex,generic,},omega}//
and
  antomega          omega           language.dat    antomega.ini

The resulting directory structure would be
  doc/antomega/base
  omega/otp/antomega
  omega/ocp/antomega
  source/antomega/base
  tex/antomega/unidata
  tex/antomega/base
  tex/antomega/encodings
  tex/antomega/hyphen
  tex/antomega/config

I think that this would work with TL and teTeX-3.0. I suggest to
proceed with this proposal and to discuss all remaining issues (e.g. the
introduction of tex/<engine>) on the TDS list.

Thomas,

I am sorry, but this solution just messes things up. Regarding
the hyphen.cfg file, I have already explained that it is needed

-- to prevent loading babel's hyphen.cfg into the lambda/lamed
formats;

-- to set \catcode, \lccode and \uccode values for some Unicode
characters.

The first task is optional, but desired (because Babel's model
of i18n is quite useless in the context of omega). The second task is
almost mandatory, because loading huge lists of character codes
at the runtime is surely something that should be avoided. However,
the default omega distribution currently doesn't provide any
standard way to do these things (previously omega has its own
hyphen.cfg, which was abandoned for unknown reasons). 

So, by turning antomega into separate format (and leaving lambda/lamed
in their present state) you just encourage lambda/lamed users to always
load useless Babel extensions and to invent some non-standard ways of
loading character codes into format (e. g. by hacking hyphenation
patterns, as Apostolos Syropoulos sometime proposed), while antomega
would provide a standard and elegant (I hope) way to do that.

And of course, if somebody has built his lambda with antomega's
hyphen.cfg, this doesn't necessarily mean (s)he also has to invoke
the antomega.sty package from all his/her lambda documents. In fact, 
(s)he may use any other packages of his/her choice, but still take
advantage of *some* features antomega provides (like lists of
character codes or hyphenation patterns). This is quite similar to
Babel, which has different levels of support for latex and plain
tex. If you create a separate format for antomega, you will
just prohibit access to antomega's capacities to other omega-based
(or aleph-based) formats. 

Regarding the proposed directory structure, I can just repeat some
things I have already stated in my answer to Staszek:

>   doc/antomega/base

Antomega is useless without a 16-bit compiler, so having a top-level
antomega directory (in doc/, source/ or elsewhere) would be a 
nonsense. doc/omega/antomega is the only acceptable location.

>   omega/otp/antomega
>   omega/ocp/antomega

I have explained in my answer to Staszek, why my OCP and OTP files
are separated into 3 groups (uni2char, char2uni, antomega), and should
not be placed together.

>   source/antomega/base

Same as with docs.

>   tex/antomega/unidata

These filed are compiler-specific. Don't prohibit access to
this directory to other omega and aleph-based formats.

>   tex/antomega/base
>   tex/antomega/encodings
>   tex/antomega/hyphen

The hyphenation files are compiler-specific par excellence.
They were written for omega, not for specially for antomega.
and can be used with any omega-based format.

After some discussion with Gerben, I think that it might be useful to
post a summary of the map file splitting and possible replacements.
I am not saying that any of these replacements should be done now.
Petr Olsak, for example, suggests careful testing. My summary gives an
overview about which map files define the same (TFM name) fonts.

Alexej,

your suggestion to use antomega's hyphen.cfg for lambda might be right,
but users of TeX Live might want to use the original version (even
though this might seem to be nonsense in your eyes: there was a life
before antomega and people might want to continue to typeset their
old documents).

I don't technically understand all the details behind your arguments,
but my suggestion allows people to use both approaches.

> >   doc/antomega/base
>

> antomega directory (in doc/, source/ or elsewhere) would be a

I was trying to help getting your package into TeX Live which has a
structure conforming to TDS-1.1 *now*. The paths that I have suggested
areconforming to this. If this is nonsense to you, I am happy to stop
contributing to this discussion.

> >   tex/antomega/unidata

You seem to draw a wrong conclusion. tex// is *always* searched.

So, what? They *are* accessible to any omega-based format...

And, if some file is hidden by something in e.g. tex/generic, one
can always give tex/antomega// a higher precedence by adjusting the
TEXINPUTS setting.

Good luck with your package!

Thomas,

your statement might be right, if omega still had its original
hyphen.cfg. But this file was excluded long time ago. Currently,
the only alternative to antomega's hyphen.cfg is the file provided
by babel. Believe me, nobody really uses babel-specific commands, 
provided by this file, with omega, because babel's i18n model (based
mainly on active characters) is totally incompatible with the way 
omega proposes.

Except excluding some babel internals, antomega's hyphen.cfg breaks
nothing, so that using it by default is totally safe. So people may
continue to typeset their older documents with antomega as well as they
did with babel-based formats, or with omega's own hyphen.cfg
before it was removed.

Well, I don't insist that antomega should be incorporated into TeX Live
*now*. In fact, I would prefer to postpone this operation, if the delay
can be used to figure out a really logical and stable package directory
structure, so that it will not be subject to changes in future. I don't
like quick hacks.

????
Let's have a look how search paths for 16-bit formats are 
currently defined:
TEXINPUTS.lamed = .;$TEXMF/tex/{lamed,lambda,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.lambda = .;$TEXMF/tex/{lambda,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.omega = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.aleph = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//

As you can see, tex// is *never* searched, and it is correct,
because otherwise having format-specific directories in tex//
would have no sense at all.

So by placing a file into tex/antomega/ you make this file
unaccessible to any format except antomega.

How it is possible? Or do you want to include tex/antomega into
search paths for other omega-based formats?

If afm files are provided, you can use afmdiff.awk written by Nelson
Beebe which is in the lib directory of the ghostscript sources.  It is
not installed by the Makefile.

Of course, it doesn't help if virtual fonts are involved.

I guess the tfm's could be converted to afm's; that might be easier than
doing the diff stuff from scratch.  I wouldn't rely on any afm's in any
tree being the same as the "corresponding" tfm.

    Of course, it doesn't help if virtual fonts are involved.

I was only thinking of comparing tfm's.

I don't have mktexpk invocation (and full xdvi.log doesn't show that). 
As normal user I've blocked pl*.map and run updmap, than run my silly

It seems that .pfb fonts are found anyway, but they are not used with

Ah! I think that xdvik has some kind of "fallback" for using .pfb files
without fontmap entries. I'll pass this to Stefan Ulrich. Maybe, we can
fix this issue by removing this fallback.

loading of (files that contain) macros can be handled at the macro

there is not so much as a curren tomega distribution at least it's not 
maintained; if you want antomega to take over maybe best is top copy all 
the relevant omega files to your package and maintain them there (it 
also give syou the opportunity to fix them)

as has been mentioned a few times in this (long thread): antomega has 
all the characteristics of a separate package / format, so that's the 
way to go and organize it; by treating it 'generic' or 'on top of 
whatever future packages may run into troubles; keep in mind that file 
searching has unpredicatable aspects: if you have whatever/abc and 
whatever/def and both have something hyphen.tex, you cannot predict 
which one is taken (directory search order may depend on creation time, 
sort order, etc); let's imagine sort order, in that case antomega (being 
on top in the alphabet) will be found first, and all later packages may 
suffer from file name clashes (this is why there may not be duplicate 
filenames in tex trees unless clearly distinguishable by package / 
engine / progname); so ...  for the best of all: think of antomega as a 
'macro package of its own' and if needed, copy all lambda and omega code 
(maybe different filenames) to your antimega tex cs paths

hyphenation pattersn may be engine specific (tex vs omega) but they are 
also macro package specific (since they can contain macros), actually, 
many of the pattern files under generic are not generic at all; i see no 
reason why antomega patterns should be generic; maybe now (because there 
are not that many omega packages) but maybe not in the future (i didn;t 
look at the patterns, but with regards to context i've learned that 
assuming that patterns are generic is a mistake)

Subject: [tex-live] Antomega format and directory structure again...
Message-ID: <200509200032.29998.akrioukov@newmail.ru>

Hi,

I am starting a new thread to discuss possible directory
structure for antomega format-specific directory. Let's assume we 
have agreed that antomega should be separated from omega and
lambda. However, still there are lots of things that need to be
clarified.

1. Antomega was born as a multilingual package for lambda, and only
later I had to include some stuff intended for loading into lambda
format (this was needed just to workaround various flaws of omega's
texmf part). That's why the current package structure includes
the antomega/ directory under omega/lambda/ and several directories
outside of this location.

Now, if antomega is considered a format by itself, it is especially
necessary to make a clear distinction between antomega format and
antomega as a multilingual package. So, should I keep the `antomega'
name for the format and rename the related package to something else
(say, `antibabel')? Of course I would prefer not to do so, because this
may cause various compatibility issues. Anyway, it is necessary to
have separate subdirectories in tex/antomega for the generic part and
for the package itself. I can't acccept the directory structure for
tex/antomega/ proposed by Thomas mainly because it messes 2 sorts of
files together. 

Note that this probably again returns us to the question about
compiler-specific directories in the TDS tree.

2. Currently TL and teTeX have 2 16-bit compilers, and both of them
theoretically can be used with antomega despite of several compatibility
problems. Both compilers are imperfect, so that user should have
a choice which compiler to use. This means we need at least 2
antomega-based formats. For example, the following lines in texmf.cnf
may be created instead of one proposed by Thomas:

TEXINPUTS.antilambda = .;$TEXMF/{tex/{antomega,latex,generic,},omega}//
TEXINPUTS.antilamed = .;$TEXMF/{tex/{antomega,latex,generic,},omega}//

Note that I have excluded the lambda directory which is pretty useless
in its current state, so that there is no reason to give it any
priority.

3. Should I duplicate the ut1omlgc.fd file in tex/antomega/?

4. Is it OK to select for my hyphenation files (not for patterns itself,
but for driver files used to load them) some names conflicting with
those used by Babel (i. e. grhyph.tex for Greek)? By this way I would be
able to eliminate the need of own languages.dat for antomega, and so
greatly simplify package installation for average users (because only
`generic' languages.dat can be edited using most configuration tools,
like texconfig.

5. I still insist that OCP and OTP files should be separated between 3
directories, as they are for now. This is principial.

6. Disregarding the question of what we should do with antomega, I
have to stress the fact that the current placement of omega-specific
files is illogical and event doesn't allow to figure out which files
in the texmf tree are used (or at least supposed to be used) by
omega/aleph. If necessary, I am ready to continue this discussion
in the TDS mailing list (but I think that the most issues is just
a natter of packaging).

Oh, I see... Indeed, I missed the fact, that the whole tex// tree
is now a great dump of commonly accessed files, so that even format
specific directories are not really format specific. I still think
that this is much less worse than TDS 1.0, but at least I can
see some logic in it.

In this situation separating antomega from omega and lambda may
be reasonable (although I still don't understand why it is
necessary to keep a useless lambda format and an equally useless
lamed format, built with babel). So I am starting another thread
were I would like to discuss how a future antomega format should
look like.

Hi,

I often do a

  sudo mktexlsr

with the side effect that my ~/texmf/ls-R is now owned by root instead
of my own user.

Is there a reason to not update the user id and group id of the ls-R
files to their original values (when running mktexlsr as root)?

It could be handy outside of the home directories too I guess.

Attached is a patch to show how it could be done.

Kind regards

This is hard to implement in a portable way. I think that neither
"id -u" nor "stat" is portable enough.

>From the view of mktexlsr, the userid and home directories do not match;
which causes the problem that you are running into.

You can easily do it better by using
  sudo -H mktexlsr
to update the global ls-R files and
  mktexlsr
just to update your own file.

Neither the name languages.dat nor the location "generic" nor the search
path is hard-coded into texconfig&friends.

Example:

  $ fmtutil --showhyphen lamed
  .../texmf-dist/tex/lambda/config/language.dat

  $ fmtutil --showhyphen latex
  .../texmf-dist/tex/generic/config/language.dat

  $ fmtutil --showhyphen cont-en
  .../texmf-dist/tex/context/config/cont-usr.tex

The names language.dat, cont-usr.tex, language.def etc. are defined
in fmtutil.cnf. These files are searched along the search path for
the given format. That's why the result for lamed is different from the
result of latex.

I didn't know the -H option. I'll try to remember it (it's probably

I've copied source.development to source.  I believe the trees should be

(I sincerely hope there won't be any more code changes.)

Since they're the same, I personally don't see a need to recompile right

I'll update the source.tar.bz2 archive later.  No sense doing it too

I've checked the current state on TL (antomega has not been yet touched 
since TL2004), and I found that when building lambda and lamed formats, 
both read:
texmf-dist/tex/lambda/antomega/hyphen.cfg and than antomega.cfg
and uni*.def files, but, unfortunately, we don't have 
/texmf-dist/tex/lambda/config/language.dat in TL, so they read 
generic/config/language.dat.
(Thomas can we borrow that from teTeX? btw what's the source
of that file?)

So both formats are somehow broken in the sense already described by 
Thomas (lambda stays untouched), but not so broken in the sense proposed 
by Alexej (lambda is well prepared for reading 16-bit hyphenation 
patterns).

To conclude, the best way is to make separate antomega format, I think.

Ps. Alexej, would you please sending me any example for antomega?

Thanks,

1) sure, you can copy that
2) I don't exactly know where it came from. Maybe, from the omega

It doesn't mean "/the/texlive/distribution" literally.  It means the

    please e-mail me how I can install and start to work with TeX.

My guess is that you'd be better off using protext.  It is much easier

Hello,

I have recently re-installed the Debian distribution of TeXlive, and have
encountered a few problems. Before re-installing, I followed the advice on the
TUG web page, and purged all TeX packages and manually deleted various texmf
directories. Anyway, the problem occurs when I'm running ConTeXt, trying to
create a PDF file. The messages would indicate that gsftopk cannot be found
(which I cannot locate either):

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 72 --mag 1+0/72 --dpi 72 uplb8r
/usr/bin/mktexpk: 264: gsftopk: not found
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for uplb8r.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.
(see the transcript file for additional information)

My previous installation of TeXlive was able to build the PDF without a problem.
Can anyone send me a clue?

I think I had a similar problem some time ago. My problem was that I
still had two old $HOME/.texmf-var and $HOME/.texmf-config
directories.

??? I don't undestand what do you mean. If you have the current iso
image:
http://www.tug.org/ftp/texlive/test/texlive2005-inst-20050920.iso
you can try to run tlpmgui.exe from the CD root.

OK. Have you installed texlive-binextra? gsftopk is part of that

Sorry for not replying that question, I'm completelly overloaded with
too many things... I  think we can purge win32-static, but it needs 
remaking so many .tpm files (removing Patterns, etc.).
Isn't easier exluding win32-static from MakeImages.sh. I found that
"inst" dosn't have them.

    remaking so many .tpm files (removing Patterns, etc.).

There's no harm in leaving the patterns in there for now, they will just
be no-ops.  We can fix them at our leisure.

So I'm deleting the win32-static files.  Cleaner.

    I found that "inst" dosn't have them.

Oh well, so much for that hope.

Dear windows TL users,

With a great help from Fabrice (many thanks!) we have a new set of
win32 binaries recompiled with the current kpathsea/web2c and working with
the same .pool files. Only (o)windvi .dvi previewer is missing, but we can
still use ps and pdf way.
I merged those binaries with some usefull programs already available
and things works well even on an old win98 :-)
tlpmgui installer for win32 is more and more robust, and it has now
some functionality of texconfig (always missing for windows).
This installer works only with "inst" CD, however...

As for the installation and maintenance, I think that for win32 we need 
somehow more simple version of texmf.cnf, because all those new
additions like TEXMFSYSVAR or TEXMFSYSCONFIG are hardly applicable
in the windows environment. I'd like to prepare such modified version
and will put it in texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf-4WIN. Tomek Luczak, who is 
working on tlpmgui, is aware of that and he will adapt the installer
in a moment (texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf-4WIN will be copied to 
texmf-var/web2c/texmf.cnf.

Any objections, comments, blessing?...

just a remark: the statics are great for intermediate updates (whenever possible i use static files instead of library bound ones - on any platform); the xemtex site often has static files as update

Whatever you think best for Windows is fine with me, for whatever that's

Message-ID: <87psr19oh5.fsf@vsu.ru>

Hi!

i just re-built and re-submitted sparc-solaris binaries (now built on
Solaris 8, so they should be more portable than those built on Solaris 10).
some remarks:

1) the lcdf-typetools binaries:

cfftot1
mmafm
mmpfb
otfinfo
otftotfm
t1dotlessj
t1lint
t1reencode
t1testpage

   link to libgcc_s.so.1 and libstdc++.so.6 which are unlikely to be
   found in default installations.

   as far as i understand, this is because lcdf-typetools build
   process does not use the "libstdc++ hack" used elsewhere to link
   statically with libstdc++. hopefully it will be fixed...

   (as a workaround these libraries can be installed from a
   sunfreeware.com libgcc package, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH will need to be
   set to include /usr/local/lib to find them)

2) xdvi-motif.bin links to libiconv.so.2 which is again absent in
   default installation (but can be installed from sunfreeware). i
   don't know whether it is something new (in my previous build for
   Solaris 10 i didn't see libiconv being linked to xdvi) and why it
   wants to use libiconv. maybe there's a configure option to prevent
   xdvi to use libiconv, or maybe i shall try to uninstall libiconv
   and rebuild.

3) the following apparently shell scripts lack the usual #!/bin/sh
   in the first line:

httexexec
htcontext
httex
httexi
htlatex
ht

4) pkfix uses a wild and ugly hack in it's first 2 lines to run perl,
   which could be replaces with "#!/usr/bin/env perl", as used in all
   other perl scripts in bin directory from texlive (except pkfix and
   texi2html)

5) texi2html contains a compile-time path of perl - which shall be
   replaced with "#!/usr/bin/env perl" too

Best,
v.

This is one reason why I prefer to use the native compilers on IRIX;
perhaps that's also an option for the Solaris build?

(Note that you may end up replacing one build issue with others...)

If the configure script find libiconv it gets linked in, and I found
no simple option to prevent this.  For the IRIX build I use a script
that removes the '-liconv' from the xdvi Makefile after configuring.

Hi Vladimir,

    i just re-built and re-submitted sparc-solaris binaries (now built on

Great!  I will give them a try ASAP.

       as far as i understand, this is because lcdf-typetools build
       process does not use the "libstdc++ hack" used elsewhere to link
       statically with libstdc++. hopefully it will be fixed...

Funny, I thought that was in there.  Will have to look.  Meanwhile, it's
no worse than it was last year.

   sunfreeware.com libgcc package, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH will need to be
   set to include /usr/local/lib to find them)

Can you link with -R/usr/local/lib so that people don't have to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  If the libraries are there, they'll just be used.

    2) xdvi-motif.bin links to libiconv.so.2 which is again absent in

libiconv was a hassle for Solaris users last year.  I don't think
it is actually necessary or used in xdvi, it's pulled in by some
sequence of libraries. 

     or maybe i shall try to uninstall libiconv and rebuild.

That sounds good.  On my Solaris 2.8, there is /usr/lib/libiconv.so, but
no iconv.so.2.

    4) pkfix uses a wild and ugly hack in it's first 2 lines to run perl,

That wild and ugly hack has actually been the standard way to invoke
Perl from something that might be interpreted by either perl or sh ever
since Perl was invented.  No change needed.

    5) texi2html contains a compile-time path of perl - which shall be
       replaced with "#!/usr/bin/env perl" too

Yes.  Sigh.  I still don't know why we bother with the Texinfo programs.
texi2html in particular has zilch to do with TeX.  Why do we have it?

Thanks,
Karl

For a release date, I would like (like previous years) a TL beta time 
where I have gone from beta to release and a large community of real 
users is using. I would like to have e few more days for my packaging 
and then a release into the Mac OS X user community. Say 2 weeks from 
now. Is that reasonable? A real live user test of the programs before 
freezing is something useful, I guess, and I can organize that (and 
have so in the past)

i re-submitted lcdf-typetools binaries for sparc-solaris which link

in fact it seems to be used by some code in xdvi. anyway, i re-built
and re-submitted xdvi to not link with libiconv.so.2 (it uses
system-provided iconv functions).

why not change this last beast to use much more elegant approach which

i remember having other problems last year when i was building TeX

i found that it was also necessary to rename /usr/local/include/iconv.h
otherwise it was included instead of system /usr/include/iconv.h and
it redefines iconv_open to libiconv_open which is not found in system
libraries.

after this rename, removing -liconv worked (otherwise there were
unresolved symbols libiconv_open & friends because of
/usr/local/include/iconv.h).

    why not change this last beast to use much more elegant approach which
    is used by all other perl scripts in TeX Live?

My recollection is that pkfix comes from CTAN.  Therefore, if it is to
be changed, then in my view it should be changed there (barring actual
brokenness).  In other words, feel free to write to Heiko :).

    well, we have other stuff like t4ht, so why not have texi2html? 

I don't consider texi2html to be similar to tex4ht, for many reasons.  I
don't see much reason for either texi2html or texinfo to be included in
TL.  But there's no point in debating this now, I certainly don't
advocate removing them for this year at this late date.

    it's only that the first line needs to be changed.

Yes, and we have to do so, since it's broken.  What we really need, I
guess is to override the PERL definition at configure time, so that the
right thing ends up in the #! line.  Would you like to take a look at that?

Meanwhile, we can just fix the #! lines in the bin directories.

Thanks for the library updates.

Ahh, I see. However, very strange:
web/pdftex/ has links to Master/texmf/...../pdfTeX-FAQ*
but we have to update in Master: NEWS and README, so in reverse

Sorry, I'm not clear as to what you're proposing to happen in two weeks,
but for sure, the more testing the better, at any time.  Asking "real
live users" to test is ideal.  Let me know what we can do to help.

My current take on our status is:

- code is frozen (modulo the first line of texi2html)
  and no changes are expected 
- we need a new context and maybe lm to go along with it
- the usual flow of other package updates continues but nothing very major

- I have almost finished updating the English documentation.  The
  changes are relatively small, compared to last year.  So I hope
  (dream) the translators will be able to update their documents
  reasonably quickly.

On the other pieces:
- Staszek and I have to review the proTeXt documentation, but otherwise
  I think it is ready.  (And has been for ages.)
- We hope to put some kind of MacTeX test image next week.

So I guess it is coming together, agonizingly as always ...

Thanks,
Karl

I think I'd say not. If I use plain TeX with Bulgarian hyphenation,
why do I want to be lumbered with LaTeX?

Correct. But why do we have different policy here: In collection-french
we have latex packages (aeguill, le) but no dependency on
collection-latex, while in czechslovak and polish we have a dependency
oncollection-latex? Maybe I miss something special in
polish/czech/slovak?

Anyway, it's good with me, although I will have to hack the postinst
scripts a bit for debian ;-)

this is error-prone. e.g. you missed the fact that now odvips is a
symlink to dvips. but in current alpha-linux binaries odvips is a
separate binary and differs from dvips:

-r-xr-xr-x  1 vvv vvv 396704 2005-08-23 20:40 alpha-linux/dvips
-r-xr-xr-x  1 vvv vvv 396568 2005-06-02 03:05 alpha-linux/odvips

shall i remove odvips and replace it with a symlink to dvips?

My suggestion is, run ls on the old dir, ls on the new dir, and use comm
to find the files that needs to be deleted.  Then do the add all, edit
all, revert -a, bizarreness which is de rigeur with perforce.  That's
what I do, anyway.  If anyone wants my script for it, let me know.

(I am really looking forward to leaving perforce behind.)

And yes, someone should make alpha-linux/odvips be a symlink.

Strange. Very strange. My local odvips in bin/alpha-linux actually *was*
a symlink to dvips, that's why nothing has changed since quite some
time.

I had to call 
	p4 sync -f odvips
to see that the depot actually has a different thing up there.

Strange thing that this happened, but my script should not be blamed.

Done it already.

    In collection-french we have latex packages (aeguill, le) 

Then it seems langfrench should depend on LaTeX, but for that reason,
not because it installs hyphenation patterns.  Right?  (Why it installs
those latex packages I do not know, but I'm not inclined to mess.)

If there are other lang* packages which only install hyphenation
patterns but no LaTeX, then they shouldn't depend on LaTeX.

Dependencies are extremely sketchy in general ...

    while in czechslovak and polish we have a dependency
    oncollection-latex? Maybe I miss something special in
    polish/czech/slovak?

Maybe because Staszek actually takes care of collection-polish, while
most other collections simply languish moribund until someone (you, in
this case) notices an inconsistency?

your scripts also missed other things when files should have been
symlinks (e.g. for altpdf* scripts) which i've fixed some time ago.
it's safest to delete all old binaries and resubmit all new ones.

If it just confuses you, ignore it.  There's no point in any of us

Message-ID: <20050923221039.GC30503@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

Just a short update: I have uploaded some packages in version
2005.09.15-2 fixing some problems:
* at removal time there are some problems because the map link is
  deleted prior to the removal of the updmap program, which then is
  called and bails out.
* installing lang* calls fmtutil-sys --byhyphen, even if texlive-latex
  is not installed. This version makes the language packages depending
  on texlive-latex, but next versions will do something different, ie
  checking with kpsewhich for language.dat before calling fmtutil.


As we are coming closer to a release, for the next round of packages
there will be the following changes (partial list):
* new maintainer adress, an alioth mailing list
* actually build from source and not from source.development
* (probably) new version numbering. I think I will start numbering the
  packages as follows:
	2005-n for packages build from a full release (n being the
		debian release number)
  and later ones
	2005.MM.DD-n for packages build latex on.
  Neil: Please comment on the naming proposal, is this ok?

Best wishes

Norbert

And what happens if the user just decides NOT to install
collection-langspanish and thus eshyph.tex is not present?


PLEASE: Can we have:
* either the same language.dat for latex and lambda and lamed

* or, if this is NOT possible, a self contained collection-omega so that
  if I install collection-omega (thus, aleph, lamed etc) the format
  generation is not bound to break immediately!

Dear friends!
  
Current Version: 2004.05.09.25-1

A new generation of Debian packages of TeX live are available on the tug
server, as usual
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

Important News (for details see below!):

* new numbering scheme (tlversion.yy.mm.dd) where tlversion
  is the last *released* TeX live version and yy.mm.dd is the current
  date. This way we can have regular releases 200N-debrelease and
  additional releases between official TeX live releases.

* I fixed all problems which I found in the last week(s), especially
  problems with fmt generation and different languages.

* New maintainer adress, and email contact point:
  Debian TeX live Maintainers <pkg-texlive-maint@lists.alioth.debian.org>
  if someone wants to help/cooperate you are invited to subscribe to
  this list!!

* reworked the tug website http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

As usual, the log files of the creation process are in 
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
The file lintian.log shows that the errors/warnings are getting less.
The two errors now present are rubbish, lintian is stupid on this.
 
Other thing:
cm-super (now again distributed half sized)
	NEWS: the font files are again under dpkg control, *and* the
	md5sums are correct, *and* the distributed .deb is still only

Just remember that at least 2 formats are needed, since there are 
2 more or less compatible compilers.

OK, I have spent a few hours preparing a more or less complete
test document. Note that it doesn't demonstrate all features
provided by antomega, because I had to typeset it with the omlgc 
font (imperfect, but available in all distributions). Better
results could be achieved with cm-lgc (which however also lacks
some useful characters).

Also, even in this file not everything works as expected,
because preparing it allowed me to find some bugs in antomega.
These bugs are quite trivial and can be easily fixed in future
versions. Some of them are mentioned in my comments.

Unfortunately, I have noticed some bugs in omega compiler itself, which
I have never seen previously. First, lambda from teTeX 3 always
crashes on any attempt to load a 8-bit virtual font. I am sure
there were no such effects in teTeX 2, because previously I spent
enough time experimenting with 8-bit output (which was always
supported by antomega). Lamed doesn't have this problem. However
there are some situations where both lambda and lamed crash
without any clear reason (i. e. adding a text line at the
beginning causes the compiler crash when processing the very end
of the file). Currently I have no ideas what exactly could cause 
this problem.

I understand that, and that's why the word 'generic' was quoted in
my message. I just meant that at least some configuration utils
allow to edit only one languages.dat file, namely, one in
tex/generic/config. So, by usign this file (and replacing only
hyphenation patterns) I could make package configuration easier
for average users.

But, anyway, the question about languages.dat was probably the
least important one, and I still would like to know what to do
with other problems I have described.

ruhyph16.tex is provided by antomega. You can't include this file
into the default languages.dat for lambda/lamed, if you 

-- want to turn antomega into a separate format;
-- don't like to create a 'generic' directory for 16-bit hyphenation
patterns.

On the other hand, the default version of ruhyph.tex (which is
adapted to the T2* encodings) is surely not very usable with omega,
so I don't know why it was listed in languages.dat for lambda.

Well, there were already so many random fixes previously, that due
to these fixes omega currenly looks even less usable than John and
Yannis had left it. So I think more fixes are needed just to correct
some results of the previous fixes :) And I would be glad to take
care of omega setup, if nobody else is interested.

If you tell texconfig that you want to edit the hyphenation setup,
you first select a format name. By using the TEXINPUTS search path of
the specified format name the file specified in fmtutil.cnf is located.
So, as long as your search paths specify a predictable file, it will
just work.

So, again: this is not true, you can use whatever you want and this
will be supported by texconfig.

That's why I have said "some configuration utils", not just "texconfig".
Yes, I see that texconfig asks for format name before editing a
hyphenation setup, but, AFAIK, the MikTeX GUI configuration tool
still doesn't. And of course if I have to make global changes
in my package, I would like to care about MikTeX users too.

In fact ruhyph.tex is an alias for ruhyphen.tex. So this entry
doesn't break anything by itself. Of course this fact doesn't 
make it more useful.

Well, really? I had an impression that most participants of this
discussion finally have supported Hans' opinion:

In fact, I even would not argue with this (may be, except pointing 
out that the hyphenation patterns by A. Syropoulos, currently
distributed with lambda, are no more or less "generic" than those
provided by antomega). That I really want, is just to store 
compiler-specific files separately from the language support 
package itself (since without knowing how to do that I can't repackage
antomega).

Well, I have never used TL (probably this is my mistake), so I can
compare only teTeX 3 with teTeX 2, and I see several quite strange
modifications in directory structure between these versions. Even if we
leave apart the changes caused by changes in TDS, I still don't
understand why so many files inside the lambda directory were moved
to different locations. For example, ocherokee and oinuit are surely
standalone packages; so, why the corresponding directories were removed
and the files were placed to lambda/base? Files from lambda/misc were
moved to lambda/base as well, although they even haven't TeX syntax (and
thus should be left in texmf/omega according to TDS 1.1).

To my mind, these particular changes look illogical (can anybody
explain why they were needed?). So I meant to say that omega-specific
packages (they are few) need more care just to prevent such undesired
modifications.

For testing I installed texlive2005-inst-20050924.iso. 

Running texhash showd that texmf-local was not included in the search

I had a look in  $TEXBASE/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf and found that there was

After changing it to: TEXMFLOCAL=$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local I was fine.

tex/lambda/config/language.dat belongs to lambda package.
Yes, you are right that that file was completelly messy. Thanks for 
pointing that. I borowed it from teTeX 3.0. Now I've just corrected that 
file for TL2005, added some comments, added 16-bit patterns but blocked
every language except hyphen.tex, so lambda (or antomega) users can
select/modify what they really want. Anyway, we still need that file
for engines like omega.
It is really anoying and time consuming task to repair such badly
maintained stuff...

I would suggest to ship a language.dat for lambda/etc which only
contains a minimal language setting, i.e. ushyphen/hyphen.tex. If
someone wants to work with lambda/lamed/antomega he has to make up his
mind and create a language.dat for himself. What do you think?

> Ps2. Norbert, you can revert your patch for Debian, I think.

Which patch? I removed language.dat from the lambda dir completely for
now *FOR THE DEBIAN PACKAGES*. But as soon as we have something useful I
will include it again.

            TPM:License

This should be done in the Catalogue, not in the TL-specific capital
letters.  It already is, thanks to RobinF and others, for many packages.
We could then autoimport the info into the tpm's if we need it there
(not sure we do).

    I have already collected the licenses of all packages starting with a*
    and those with capital initial letter, now I have to go to bed ;-)

If you can send a patch to the Catalogue folks, I hope they will accept
it.  You can get the current Catalogue sources from the texcatalogue
project at sarovar.org.

Thanks,

P.S. Regarding lambda language.dat, I think it is highly desirable to
have some file there, even if it's only English, so that people will
know what the file is they are supposed to modify.  It's asking a lot
for someone to come up with it ab inito.  I couldn't do it myself
without a lot of effort.

Hello Norbert,

Thanks for the great work.

A little glitch with the texlive-htmlxml package. It cannot find the
"marvosym.sty" when it tries to generate the jadetex format file, but no
such dependency requirement is listed in the package information.

Could we? Sebastian? That would be really really really great.
I could include it into the texlive Debian packages and make even the
most bastard DD content with a full copyright file, and for the others
it would be also usefull to know the license.

Is it possible to add this easily to the tpm generation script and make
a run?

I will check what I have and what they have and then see wethere there
is a difference. Thanks for informing me on this.

Hi all!

In current jadetex.ltx there is

and marvosym is in collection-fontsextra, so should we add to
collection-htmlxml a TPM:Require collection-fontsextra, or is the

To be honest, I wouldn't put too much trust in the information in the
Catalogue.  Just having come back from vacation I don't recall which
package it was about, but we had the case this summer or spring that a
Debian user found a non-free license statement in a file, although the
Catalogue said it was free.  I asked the Catalogue admins whether they
had an explanation for the discrepancy - perhaps a mail stating the new
license - but was told that the information was from before the
Catalogue was moved to Sarovar, and they had no information *why* the
Catalogue had this license information.

We have started compiling a list at

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-tetex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/copyright?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-tetex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/Copyright.Files?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

but it is far from complete.  My hope was that whenever we touch a
particular file, we look up its and its package's license and copyright
information and put it there, but we didn't get very far...

These files are needed to build 16-bit virtual fonts for Omega
(omlgc and omarab). There is a special perl script, makeovp.pl,
which seems to be unavailable in teTeX (don't know about TL).
If you feed them together with the corresponding *.afm
files to makeovp.pl, the script will produce ovp files which later 
may be turned to binary virtual fonts with ovp2ovf.

So these files are never used, unless one wants to rebuild
Omega fonts from scratch. And even in this case they are
processed with a perl script, rather than with omega or lambda
compilers.

Why not take the information from the Catalogue, and if someone finds
something wrong, we change the Catalogue entry. This way everybody will
profit from your efforts!

Of course we should feed the information back to the catalogue, yes.
But I don't want to start with a list populated with unverified
information from the Catalogue - it would give the wrong impression that
we have in fact investigated all those files. 

Furthermore, since teTeX comes in one big tarball, I want a way to
indicate which file exactly belongs to which package under a given
license (e.g. think of the many files by different authors in
tex/generic/pstricks/, or font packages distributing files in fonts/,
tex/latex, and maybe elsewhere).  Maybe this is easier starting from the
tpm files.

This is what I want to do: As the tpm files are installed and it
hopefully will soon contain the license information from the catalogue,
everybody can look up which file belongs to which license.

For texlive with more than 1000 different packages it would be
impossible to do this by hand.

Indeed - but it should be done automatically by a script.  In principle,
looking at debian/copyright should be sufficient for any Debian package
to know the license of each of its files, see #218105 and many other
remarks; and also the practical problems we have with finding "Uups,
this file is in package A, but doesn't seem to be covered by the license
of package A".

On the other hand, it is clear that even for teTeX a simple flat list is
completely unuseable, no matter how the list is grouped.  Let alone for
tex-live.  So we need some manageably format;  I started with a list of
packages, grouped by license, and a separate file indicating which file
belonged to a package (grouped by package).  If the thing is automated,
we could do it more readable:  A short plain-text copyright file
referring to the actual file in html or similar; in this case each
package could also have a link to the place where the license is
indicated (if it is in the header of each file, to one of them).

Regards, Frank

Umpf, long term. In principle with texlive one can look up the which
packages it belongs to by grepping in tpm/*, and then looking into the
found tpm file for the license. But this is not like looking into the
debian/copyright file. But this is inpractical, as you said.

The files are fed by the script ctan2tds in the repository. More details
I don't know, you have to ask Sebastian/Karl. I would assume that most
packages are more or less automatically installed using ctan2tds, as it
contains quite a lot of exceptions ;-)

    the texlive repository is

We do the latter -- copy dtx/ins from CTAN and run latex over them (via,
mostly, Sebastian's Build/cdbuild/ctan2tds.pl script).  We have to,
since CTAN does not generally provide the generated sty/cls/whatever.

When Sebastian autoupdated the Catalogue descriptions into the TPM's, it

I'd just as soon not go through that again right now.

Err, right, I should have known.  What I really should have asked: do
you also generate to documentation, or take what's on CTAN (meaning that
you don't have to check how many runs, makeindex invocations etc are
needed)?

>From the Debian side, I don't think we're in a hurry.  We can easily
"backport" the information from texlive development after the release to
Debian packages of the released version.  As for the copyright file
going through NEW queue, I think a word of explanation (referring to
tetex which isn't better, and that soon texlive will have a better
copyright file than tetex) will do the trick.

Hi,
vntex-3 is now available from

It is already in the CTAN incoming directory and I suppose it will be
in CTAN:/language/vietnamese/vntex soon.

Please also keep the htf-fonts from Eitan's bugfixes page up-to-date.
Eitan fixed some problems recently and created the lm fonts from
scratch.  He also supports Iwona and Kurier now.

Any news about the Iwona and Kurier copyright?  It would be sad if
they will not go into the distributions.

>

I downloaded this Friday, and burned the CD and tried installing
today (WinXP).
Here's my experience:

- The Install Utility window came up (looks like a nice interface)
- I selected the scheme-medium and customized it to delete the
languages 
  and add some other things.
- It appeared to install a lot of things (running list in a command
window)
  (It appeared to install the languages even though I instructed not
to.)
- It finished and displayed an Error window that referenced the log
file.
  (a way to click to open the log file at this point would be nice.)
- I found the log file and opened it. But I can't really tell what
(if anything)
  went wrong.
  I am attaching the log file in case it throws any light on what
went on.
- There has been nothing added to the Start menu.

The Install window utility remains on the screen. I checked the
other tabs and found that the add and remove packages windows are
empty, and the Remove Installation tab says:
  "Can't find TEXLive directory. Environment Variable TLroot not
found."

I tried running latex etc from WinShell and WinEdt. Latex runs ok,
so does dvips and pdflatex. However, I cannot preview the dvi file.
Was a dvi viewer included? (windvi, for example?)

I don't know enough about how this installation process is supposed
to work to know if there are really problems, or I just don't know
how to use it. (I've installed previous TeXLives many times, but
this is a different interface.)

    Here's my experience:

Thank you very much, Harriet.

    (I'm also sending this to tex-live, hope that's the right thing to

Can only help :).  Thanks.

  (It appeared to install the languages even though I instructed not to.)

The way the dependencies are written (helter-skelter), I can't say I'm
terribly surprised.

    - It finished and displayed an Error window that referenced the log

That seems like the worst problem.  I don't think you actually attached
your log file, could you resend that, please?  

    - There has been nothing added to the Start menu.

I'm not sure it's intended that it do so (unfortunately).

    However, I cannot preview the dvi file.
    Was a dvi viewer included? (windvi, for example?)

Sadly, windvi no longer works with the current tree (right, Staszek?).

Perhaps we can try to find another maintainer, as Fabrice is no longer
interested in it, or include another dvi previewer, but it won't happen
this year.

    this is a different interface.)

Yes, the old homegrown installer Fabrice wrote is no longer maintained
(or maintainable).  His xemtex package (xemtex.org) has a different
(installshield-based) installer, but it is not integrated (or
integradable) with TL.  Such is life.

    PS I just noticed there's a new image today-- should I try that one?

I am doubtful that anything has changed that would affect much about
your Windows install.  There will be new images pretty much daily.  So
before you spend more time on it, let's make sure we've addressed what
we can.

Thanks again,
Karl

    needed)?

Well, ctan2tds.pl does have all the necessary logic to generate
documentation, including makeindex, bibtex, and more.  Until quite
recently, this was also necessary, as CTAN did not ask/require authors
to upload generated documentation.

However, now that there is supposed to be uploaded doc, I just changed
ctan2tds so that it would not try to regenerate it.  (Sorry, Sebastian.)

Hmmm, I don't see any .log. Would you please sending me that directly.

The message was changed as too drastic.

This log file contains mostly messages from updmap and fmtutil runs.
Of course, some formats cannot be built as they weren't installed.
After installation, the user can run tlpmgui again and do some 
maintenance, like editing fmtutil.cnf or updmap.cfg

Is this really needed? tlpmgui is invoked from the CD...

The system was not yet configured, so add/remove will work for any 
subsequent tlpmgui run.

Sorry, an old windvi seems to not work with that installation, so please
use dvi->ps or pdf way.

Please try more new and robust one:
http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/tlpmgui.exe
and run it from the hard disk. After starting, it is enough to select
the CD drive.

Many thanks for your comments.

Of course, of course. I, too, prefer a release. Rest could be done after
the release!

    Running texhash showd that texmf-local was not included in the search
    path.

I fixed common.sh so that it would notice when TEXDIR is changed, and
not keep the ".." in the TEXMFLOCAL path.

Thanks.

As I see from your .log file things went quite well. The most current 
setup is better optimised, however.

You would better selecting scheme-base and adding needed collections :)

No, those deselected languages weren't finally installed and the local 
language.dat was properly made (e.g. when the latex format is made, only 
minimal set of hyphenation paterns are read, as can be seen from your
log).

> (if anything) went wrong.

Now we have tlpmgui.log (not .err).

> - There has been nothing added to the Start menu.

No need for that, I think. Just insert the CD and run tlpmgui.

Yes, any special "Quit" button is missing, please just click X to close
the window. We tried our best making tlpmgui as simple, as possible (but
stable). And the logic with schemes and collections is the same as with
Unix installer (tlpmgui can be easily adapted for other platforms, but for
this year is too late).

I also installed the 20050923 TL test on Windows XP Pro SP2, but haven't had
time for more than a few basic tests.  I did try "pdflatex symbols" for the 
newly updated symbols.tex (see below, note that you will need to use
ifpdf.sty).



My install experience was much the same as yours, and my log file is essentially
the same.  I changed the default install directory to c:\tl2005.0923, but
noticed that this change was not carried thru to some later menus, which still
expected to find files in c:\TeX.

WinEdt uses the registry to find the fptex installation (see TeXSystem.edt).  
The PC already had registry entries carried over from tl2003 (fptex).
For tl2004 I ran an install on linux, copied the tree, and manually edited the
registry to set the new top level directory.  The same approach seems to work 
for tl2005.  Does WinEdt have TeX Live support?

There is a conflict with XemTeX, which somehow finds 
  c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.texlive2005 
(presumably via one of the registry settings).

I'm able to use pdftex and pdflatex, but there was a version conflict
with ghostscript (I have gs8.51 installed) with one of the font generation
commands.  I just replaced all the TeX Live gs bits with the 8.51 versions.

They worked with fpTeX.  I do not know if Alex is aware that fpTeX is no

Subject: [tex-live] mktexlsr and directory permissions
Message-ID: <20050927152157.GI5758@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi Thomas!

I just found out that mktexlsr in version 1.46 (as in TeX live) has a
new `feature' which makes me a bit unhappy: If the directory where the
ls-R file is located is not actually writeable, the ls-R will not be
updated, *EVEN* if the ls-R file is indeed writeable!

Now in the debian tetex packages this is no problem, as there is still
1.45 of mktexlsr, but in the texlive packages we got a problem:

We (Frank and me) would like to give the option that a certain group is
allowed to create/update ls-R files, eg in /var/cache/fonts or
/usr/local/share/texmf. But users are not allowed to write to
/var/cache/fonts, only to /var/cache/fonts/{pk,tfm,mf}, so with this
change the update of ls-R files is broken.

Is there a chance that this will be reverted, or is there a deeper
reason why the temporary ls-R file is not anymore generated with
	db_file_tmp=`tempfile -p ls-R`
but with
	db_dir_tmp="$db_dir/lsR$$.tmp"
?

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

I don't think this is a problem with the mktexlsr versions - Debian's
teTeX packages patch mktexlsr.  I think I showed the patch to Thomas a
while ago.  Unfortunately it closely mixes two issues: We cat the
tempfile into the real file instead of moving it (thus circumventing the
permissions problem), and we use a different way to create the tempfile
which is not portable.  I don't have time to take it apart now, sorry.
Here it comes,

regards, Frank

I don't know, but I think that TeX programs should be found  
by the editor along the *current* PATH.

We use now somehow optimised configuration, e.g. don't put config

Now you can deselect the installation of gs and/or perl if you have it
already installed. The next tlpmgui revision (this night :-) will not set 
variables for them as well.

No, this package seems to be broken (also on CTAN!, so sorry),
we have yhcmex10.mf|tfm|pfb but only yrcmex10.tfm, without .mf

Subject: [tex-live] Tests with TLPM/TLPMGUI
Message-ID: <433C41E6.14135.14BF811@localhost>

Hello

My box runs Windows XP with SP2. I used TL2005 Image from 9/27/2005.

TLPMGUI:
1.
Installation on a clean machine works fine.
TL2005 if basicly functional. 
Have PATH and environment set properly
texmf-var is filled
formats are created
updmap was executed
I have a running TL. Fine.
2.
Immediately after the installation (without closing and restarting 
tlpmgui) it is not possible to 'Add packages' or do other things.
Even after restarting tlpmgui adding packages does not work but 
tlpmgui always says 'success'.
Removing packages works.
3.
Removing installation works fine if all other windows are closed.
When a filemanager is open on c:\tex remove will crash and never
end successful.

4. TLPMGUI seems to have problems running if the machine is not clean
i.e. path or environment has traces of a (possibly broken) former
installation of TL2005.

5. Repeating the installation does expand PATH again. So you may end 
up with PATH=c:\tex\bin\win32;c:\tex\bin\win32;...

Suggestions

After editing updmap.cfg or language.dat the call of updmap and
fmtutil is done silently which is irritating because of the delay.

It should be possible the edit texmf.cnf also.

Is it possible to run tlpmgui with a custom batch file for tlpm?
This question comes up because none of the schemes presented
fit my needs here. In fact 'full' is much too big and the other
schemes lack a number of packages I would like to see installed
by tlpmgui without using 'Add packages'.

TLPM

Version 1.03 seems to be back to Version 1.01?
Does not work as version 1.02 does
Cant use neither batchfiles nor inst command for schemes or packages.
I always get "no such files or...".
I wonder how tlpmgui works with tlpm.
May be there are major changes in using tlpm?

Wolfgang,

many thanks for your notes. I've just forwarded them to Pawel and Tomasz.

As tlpmgui is still under development, we have new versions every 
day. Please try the latest one (0.40, half an hour old:-)
http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/tlpmgui.exe
and run it from the hard disc, then select cd drive.

?? After simple installation (e.g. basic) you can check some files in TEMP 
and see that tlpm just uses batch prepared by tlpmgui.

The meaning of the numbers is explained in kpathsea's texinfo

I am moving the depot/Master/Tools/tl2deb directory to the svn
repository at alioth.debian.org. You can find it at
	http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-texlive
or under
	svn://svn.debian.org/pkg-texlive/
ATM it contains all the files from the tl2deb directory, and furthermore
the debian stuff from the new cm-super packages and the debian texinfo
packages (all of which I am responsible).

If someone wants to join in the development, check all of pkg-texlive or
only one of the sub projects texinfo, cm-super, texlive and bombard me
with patches (well, at least I hope to see this). Later on I can give
you write permissions.

There are some reasons for this move:
.) in fact the files are not in any way necessary for TeX live, so
   the probably not even belong into the depot.
.) working with svn is, for small things like this, much more
   comfortable. If I am offline I can continue editing. With p4 I cannot
   call p4 edit when I am offline.
.) I want to have all my debian stuff in one place.

I suggest removing the tl2deb subdirectory, but if one of you
(Sebastian?) has a different opinion on this, it's ok for me. For now I
leave the status as is, and try to update the depot now and then from
the svn repository.

Best wishes

Norbert

CORFE (n.)
An object which is almost totally indistinguishable from a newspaper,
the one crucial difference being tat it belongs to somebody else and
is unaccountably much more interesting that your own - which may
otherwise appear to be in all respects identical. Though it is a rule
of life that a train or other public place may contain any number of
corfes but only one newspaper, it is quite possible to transform your
own perfectly ordinary newspaper into a corfe by the simple expedient
of letting somebody else read it.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem TeX-Live 2005 (Test Image): WINDVI missing
Message-ID: <752900473.20050928141714@gmx.de>

Dear Sir or Madam,

i've downloaded and installed the preliminary version of the TeX
Live 2005 release from http://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/.

I'm using Windows XP respectively the "win32"-binaries.
Maybe i'm mistaken -- but is it possible that the dvi viewer,
"windvi", ist missing? According to the documentation in
  \texmf-doc\doc\english\texlive-en\live.pdf
it should be still part of TeX Live 2005.

Thanks for your attention!

Yours
Johannes G?bel

I reinserted (static) windvi yesterday after checking that it can also
work with TL2005. However I should admit that windvi is no more 
maintained.

We reduced the size of cbgreek last year.  We can't go back to the full
set now, it would again overflow the CD.

As for the outdating, I will look.

The old set had pfb's for all sizes and was very large
What there is now is a small set with only 1000 as size (but not all  
fonts)
On CTAN, there are now more (all fonts) but not like the old set (all  
sizes), so the size is limited. What is now on TL is something like 2 
+MB. What is on CTAN is 7MB. Does an extra 5MB make TL overflow?

I see.  Thanks.  I'll look.

It would get very close, but we're already going to overflow with Iwona
and Kurier.  I'll see how it turns out ...

I'd rather not have CB Greek than this incomplete version. This  
breaks existing older documents while it suggests CB Greek is  
available. With \usepackage{type1ec} and the new CB Greek this seems  
not to happen.

Uuups. Actually I wanted to do this later on, in case I need to go back
to older version. But what is done is done. No need to worry. If I need
something I can still dig it out of the perforce depot.

WinEdt looks in the registry and also checks a number of likely candidates 
for the top-level TeX directory, including C:\TeX (but not 
C:\tl2005.0923).  I ended editing the file to force it to use my
tl directory.

I decided to "set HOME=U:\" explicitly and move .texlive2005 there
(U:\ is our user network "home", so I can have TeX the same from
any PC).

Good.  Maybe in the future Win32 gs and perl can be omitted from TL as 
there are good, easily installed, versions readily available.  I'd prefer 
that the space be used for things that are more specifically TeX-related 
such as font packages.  For people who want the TL version the .zip file
could still be distributed via CTAN and DVD.
