Subject: [tex-live] TeXlive for Debian - post ftpmaster release
Message-ID: <20051201133132.GF24030@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

Ok, the first try was a bummer. Rejected by ftpmaster. So what, it
started a long and interesting discussion on debian-devel.

I have now redone a lot, means:
. merged everything to 5 source packages
. renamed several packages to conform more with Debian standards
. killed the three tools/utls packages which are only marginally related
  to TeX (graphicstools, ttfutils, psutil) and are partly already in
  Debian
. Started to use TEXMFDIST=usr/share/texmf-texlive

So there have been a buch of changes.

THUS: CALL FOR TESTERS!!!

I have put a new set on the tug server, and added several usefull
information to the website there about how to come around to install
packages depending on tetex.

Please Neil, NO UPLOAD NOW! I want to get tests. If you have time you
can already get the source packages (everything has changed, you have to
get everything anew, sorry) and build them, but please no upload for
now.

I have completely switched *all* my working machines to these packages,
and have repackaged several debian packages depending originally only on
tetex to depend alternatively on texlive (see web site).

So again, please test, and don't forget to purge everything before
installing the new set!

For the testers: Please PURGE everything and reinstall, as the version
is STILL 2005-1 (the old one was renamed -0.2 ;-)

Current Version: 2005-1 (still!, I renamed the old one to 0.2)

Get it at
  	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
  	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html contains a lot of information, please
read it.

 
As usual, the log files of the creation process are in 
  	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
All the lintian errors are overriden or fixed, only the missing manpages
are still there. I can (and will not) not do this now, to write 40 man
pages. This is for later.

Complete Changelog for this version and the previous one:

version 2005-1 experimental Wed, 30 Nov 2005 21:35:55 +0100

30.11.2005 NP
  * add symlink from texmf-texlive/ls-R to /var/lib/texmf/ls-R-TEXLIVE
  * kill packages ttf-utils, ps-utils, graphics-tools, they should become
    proper Debian packages
  * upload to experimental, based on scripts revision 197.
  * Upload sponsored by Neil McGovern <maulkin@halon.org.uk>

29.11.2005 NP
  * another round of package renaming, adaptions to the perl script
  * move only the files from texmf-dist and texmf-doc to texmf-texlive,

28.11.2005 NP
  * reduce number of source packages
  * rename various packages

27.11.2005 NP
  * properly clean up debian subdir with target clean, ie remove the
    generated maintainer scripts and the generated .link files.
  * upgrade pgf in texlive-pictures to 1.01 for compatibility fixes

24.11.2005 NP
  * Close the ITP (Closes: #312897)
  * add a dependency tl-htmlxml -> tl-latexrecommended because jadetex
    needs the ecrm fonts.
  * switch to texmf-texlive tree, which also makes a dependency on
    tex-common >= 0.12 necessary.

version 2005-0.2 UNRELEASED Tue, 22 Nov 2005 23:49:00 +0100

22.11.2005 NP
  * this release was uploaded as -1 to experimental but rejected. Thus
    the release was renamed as -0.2 and a new -1 will be generated.

  * make updmap-sys silent in postinst script
  * make fmtutil-sys silent in postinst script

21.11.2005 NP
  * fix lintian source override installation
  * fix etex/pdfetex format generation problem
  * remove the 04TeXlive hack as the change will go into tex-common 0.11
    rather soon
  * remap only a few config files (those for programs) to /etc/texmf/texlive
  * try to fix the conundrum with format generation. This is a complete
    upstream chaos (ok, also upstream I created the chaos ;-). Should be 
    fixed rather soon.

20.11.2005 NP
  * fix invocation of grep in common.functions to add || true, since grep
    returns if no match found
  * fix installation of TeXlive.cnf as 04TeXlive.cnf into /e/t/texmf.d
  * add a overriding TEXMF variable to 04TeXlive.cnf which includes
    TEXMFCONFIG without !! (Should actually be fixed in tex-common!)
  * remove the long invocation of language.dat
  * fix merging of common.functions into postrm and prerm
  * fix regexp for installing lintian.override files

19.11.2005 NP
  * add common.functions and merge it into the maintainer scripts
  * change check for the existence of a format from kpsewhich fmt.ini
    to a fmtutil-sys --listcfg check (in common.functions)
  * Leave the map files in TEXMFMAIN and do not remap them to /etc/texmf
  * New configuration file handling, all the files are left in their
    normal place and config files to shadow these files should be put 
    into /etc/texmf
  * Add override for TEXMFSYSCONFIG to /etc/texmf
  * give the updmap.d, fmt.d, and language.d config snippets priority 10
    and only the us language snippet the 09 priority.

16.11.2005 NP
  * add a distribution entry to the ChangeLog file and make tpm2deb.pl
    aware of it
  * fix all remaining man page warnings of lintian
  * load tpm data from a dump of the %TpmData using perl::Storable,
    significantly speeding up the initialization time at source-deb
    building time.
  * add additional override for texlive-langgerman that german is correct

Dear Dr. Berry

Thank you for your announcement on XyMTeX. 
Because XyMTeX has not been fully developed and should be 
equipped with other additional functions, 
I wish to restrict the disturibution within 
personal use and CTAN distribution.

So I think this conclusion would be inevitable under your policy.

Thanks Karl for asking. I am rebuilding texlive debian packages now
without xymtex.

Message-ID: <1133465339.438f4efb63619@imp2-g19.free.fr>

Hi,

The "euclide"package is obsolete in texlive 2005 :
After the installation, it is located in :
/texmf-dist/tex/latex/euclide
/texmf-dist/dvips/euclide/

The good "euclide" package is avaible in texlive 2005 in
/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pst-eucl
/texmf-dist/dvips/pst-eucl
He's name is "pst-eucl" now.

So I had to remove the old "eucide" manually to make the new "pst-eucl" work.

That's why I think you should remove the "euclide" package.

I noticed that "pincins" and "xlop" are missing.

Thank you for TeXlive !

I'm very sorry to hear that my inquiry resulted in the removal of XyMTeX
from TeXLive. :-(  It is a really useful tool.

Let's hope that when Dr. Shinsaku considers XyMTeX more polished, he'll
reconsider the license.

Your inquiry resulted in Dr. Shinsaku's wishes being heeded.  That's
nothing to be sorry for.  It is a pity that such are his wishes, but
that certainly is not a fault of yours.

Don't be so pessimistic.  Obviously he is not satisfied with the
current version and I have the impression that he is still working on
it and will change the license when he thinks the software is good
enough.

Isn't it nice to hear that his major concern is the quality of his
software? 

And there is plenty of time until TeXLive-2006 will be released.

It is good that you asked Karl to clear the copyright.  I don't think
that Dr. Shinsaku will be more motivated when he sees that his
copyright is ignored.

Regards,
  Reinhard

i agree with this; since there are users of his macros out there, 
dropping may also lead to surprises, frustration, unneccessary support 
requests etc

how about a package (zip or rpm) with 'goodies'; since user are willing 
to install other non-free stuff (acrobat reader and such) they probably 
also hav eno problems with les-free goodies

(previous tex collections shipped with texmf-extra that has such things)

I'm sorry, I didn't intend that to sound at all cynical or snarky.  I
really do hope he will reconsider the XyMTeX license eventually (I am
using XyMTeX in my thesis), and I say that without making any guess
(optimistic or pessimistic) of the probability of that occurring.

> Isn't it nice to hear that his major concern is the quality of his
> software? 

It is nice, but one can argue that the quality would improve faster if
it was easily available to a wider audience capable of providing bug
reports and code -- say, the users of Debian and TeX Live. :-)

Message-ID: <20051203164040.GA14735@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>


Hi all!

(for Neil: still no upload please)

After some nights of work (and more or less no sleep) I have done some
things:
. blacklist tipa, tpslifonts, texpower, prosper
  recommend updated (nmu)versions of these packages, distributet
  via tug.org (see website).

. send patches to tipa and arabtex to upgrade them to work with tetex3
  and texlive

. killed texlive-lang-arab as it is arabtex (after arabtex is updated)

. repackaged many packages depending on tetex-XXX to depend
  alternatively also on texlive. 
  distributed via the tug.org website. So now you can install lyx and
  many other packages in parallel with texlive
  (was nothing else den dpkg-deb -e/x, vi control, dpkg-deb -b)

Next on the list of slicing-out is jadetex/xmltex. There are other
candidates, but this is a hard buisness and takes some time to check
wether these packages are ok, maintained, ...

For those who use aptitude, the new packages are still -1 but should be
installed automatically/upgraded. For apt-get/dpkg I don't know wether
it checks that this is a new version of  2005-1.

Current Version: 2005-1 (still!, and will stay like this ;-)

It's not OK to violate someone's copyright just because users don't
mind things which are not free software.

If he wants nobody except CTAN to distribute his package, let it be so.

sure, but i'm not talking about voilating here

the tex collection has a copy of (most of or maybe all of) ctan but 
repackaged in a tree; so, by submitting something to ctan, ths package 
automatically ends up in the tex collection, and if so, it should have a 
place; putting it in a 'less formal' tree would signal the intention; 
so, in-tune with the authors wish it could be removed from the format 
texmftree, and end up in an informal texmfextra tree

(i can imagine that the author would have less problems having his work 
in a tex user group distribution (tex collection only) than in any 
possible distribution, which is out of his sight)

anyhow, i'm not using the packege, so it's up to the users to convince 
authors -)

can you add .enc and .map files for OT2 fonts (wnr10 and friends) to

I just installed TL2004 on a new server when it occurred to 
me I should really have used the 2005 ISO. Duh.

Is there an "upgrade" option anywhere, or should I just install it and
give the same setup info, or should I try
to wipe the 2004 installation and redo from scratch?

Would this be enough for a complete wipe (given that I asked for
the soft links):

for f in /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux; do rm -f /usr/local/bin/$f; done
rm -rf /usr/TeX 

Or is there stuff installed in other directories?

Hi Peter,

    Is there an "upgrade" option anywhere, 

No upgrade, and never has been :(.

    or should I just install it and give the same setup info, or should
    I try to wipe the 2004 installation and redo from scratch?

Definitely better to wipe, not install over.  Or install in a new path.

    for f in /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux; do rm -f /usr/local/bin/$f; done
    rm -rf /usr/TeX 

That should be everything important.

    Or is there stuff installed in other directories?

Not unless you asked for it, e.g., a separate texmf-local.

Personally I install each year's release in a separate dir
/usr/local/texliveNNNN (and have a version-independent symlink).  Have
the last 7 years online -- so thankful that hard disk technology has
improved so much :).

Happy installing,
Karl

A colleague and I gave a 2 hour talk last night using my laptop
booted into Knoppix from a USB key. Works a treat. IFFF your
machine can boot from USB, which your users probably can't.

But why not just talk to the admins? doing things underhand
will just lead to tears.

Because the admins concerned are BOFHs who don't want nasty difficult
stuff like TeX cluttering up their nice disks :-)

All the users want to do (under Windows) is put in the Live CD, open
their document off floppy or USB or over the network, and run LaTeX,
Acrobat or a DVI viewer, and print (maybe dvips).

if the use of TeX is necessary for the academic work, don't
accept that attitude.

which is fine if you run from the DVD :-}

all you need do is copy the bin/win32 directory and the texmf* trees
from the DVD to a USB key, add (eg) e:\bin\win32 to your PATH,
and its done. OK, so it'll be a fairly big USB key you'll want
(a 1Gb will do it). Probably easier to just get the folks to buy a DVD
player.

sorry to be negative, but I do think your users need to take
charge of their lives, and

 a) establish a proper relationship with the admins to get the software
     they need supported properly
 b) stop thinking that buying a new PC or a DVD drive is expensive

the amount of time they waste fooling with their computers anyway
would, if charged out at FEC, more than pay for a shiny new box.

Hi all!

Ok, I really think that the packages are ready now. But please, some of
you test it. I have my main machine on the university and my laptop
running these packages.

After some testing I will build the `final' upload version for Neil to
upload (it is not the one we have now, as some conflicts are missing,
but I expect only minor changes).

PLEASE TEST

Work since the last version (3.12.) has been mainly put into updating
more packages to work with texlive (in updpkg/) and compatibility with
tetex.

The biggest news is probably that tetex users now can install
several texlive packages without any problem (typical candidates:
texlive-latex-extra, texlive-fonts-recommended, texlive-fonts-extra).

Please note that texlive-htmlxml is gone. It is replaced by tex4ht,
xmltex, passivetex, jadetex, all of them in `fixed' versions in the
updpkg/ repository.

Finally, a meta package `texlive' has been made that pulls in a more or
less complete texlive system, i.e. all the texlive packages, plus those
which are in TeX live, but are not included in the Debian packages
because equivalent packages are already in Debian (cm-super, tipa,
jadetex, ...).

For those who use aptitude, the new packages are still -1 but should be
installed automatically/upgraded. For apt-get/dpkg I don't know wether
it checks that this is a new version of  2005-1.

Current Version: 2005-1

Get it at
   	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
   	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
   	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ updpkg/
   	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ updpkg/
  
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html contains a lot of information, please
read it.

Complete Changelog for this version and the previous one:

version 2005-1 experimental Wed, 14 Dec 2005 10:48:46 +0100

13.12.2005 NP
  * make packages which are not texlive specific depend on either texlive
    or tetex, and remove unnecessary conflicts with tetex, so that tetex
    users can use the texlive packages, too.

12.12.2005 NP
  * Rename dependency from lcdftypetools to lcdf-typetools
  * don't build texlive-htmlxml but recommend the respective debian pkgs
  * move xmlplay from texlive-htmlxml (not build) to tl-latex-extra

11.12.2005 NP
  * remove texlive from the dependencies of the texlive packages
  * include security fix xpdf-3.01pl1.patch (CAN-2005-3193)
  * add bzip2 to build-dep
  * fix installation of getnonfreefonts(-sys)

10.12.2005 NP
  * fix rules generation to first unpack and then patch
  * add texdoctk patch warning if perl-tk is not installed (stolen from tetex)
    and remap-link texdotk.{defaults,dat} to /etc/texmf/texlive/texdoctk
  * add a texlive meta package that pulls in all sub packages and other
    Debian packages resulting in a more or less complete TeX Live system.
  * change orig.tar.gz layout to look exactely like the DVD (so we can
    once put the debian dir into the DVD)

09.12.2005 NP
  * use source.tar.bz2 from Master/source (i.e. from the DVD)

03.12.2005 NP
  * blacklist euclide.tpm, as it is superseeded by pst-eucl
  * "give Debian what Debian is":
    - do not build texlive-lang-arab as it is arabtex which is in Debian
    - blacklist prosper and depend on prosper (fix for prosper needed)
      recommend prosper
    - blacklist texpower and tpslifonts as they are superseeded by the
      Debian texpower package (fix for texpower needed), recommend texpower
    - blacklist tipa as it is in Debian (fix for tipa send to maintainers)
      recommend tipa
  * switch field separator in cfg file to ; so that epoch specifications work

02.12.2005 NP
  * blacklisting xymtex as it is not distributable.
  * blacklist (bin-)ppower4 as it depends on java and no sources
    are provided within texlive (but you can get it from the author)
  * save ChangeLog in utf8

01.12.2005 NP
  * add dependency tl-context -> tl-metapost (thanks Arne J??rgensen)

30.11.2005 NP
  * add symlink from texmf-texlive/ls-R to /var/lib/texmf/ls-R-TEXLIVE
  * kill packages ttf-utils, ps-utils, graphics-tools, they should become
    proper Debian packages

29.11.2005 NP
  * another round of package renaming, adaptions to the perl script
  * move only the files from texmf-dist and texmf-doc to texmf-texlive, 
    leave others in place (more work for teTeX cooperation has to be done)
  * fix lintian generation for source packages

28.11.2005 NP
  * reduce number of source packages
  * rename various packages

27.11.2005 NP
  * properly clean up debian subdir with target clean, ie remove the
    generated maintainer scripts and the generated .link files.
  * upgrade pgf in texlive-pictures to 1.01 for compatibility fixes

24.11.2005 NP
  * Close the ITP (Closes: #312897)
  * add a dependency tl-htmlxml -> tl-latexrecommended because jadetex
    needs the ecrm fonts.
  * switch to texmf-texlive tree, which also makes a dependency on
    tex-common >= 0.12 necessary.

For what its worth (not much, since I have not been participating),
I believe this to be a Bad Thing. The whole point of texlive was to be 
complete,
and _replace_ these balkanized ad hoc packages.

I concur with you, but I have to bow to the limits and regulations of
Debian, too.

In principle it is not a bad idea to have these packages separate, as
updates *can* be incorporated more easily.

Of course, the problem is that these packages have to have active
maintainers. 

Bottom line: Let's hope that the maintainer are not getting bored with
their packages and keep them up-to-date, then we don't have any problem.

Side note: I can easily take in currently blacklisted packages if the
maintainer of the respective package gives up. My aim is to have a
complete TeX live system on Debian, and ATM I can do this by
	aptitude install texlive
The packages not in the texlive-debs are at the same level compared to
TeX live, so there is no problem with this.

Have you updated pdfTeX (current is 1.30.5)? I didn't update the
version in p4 yet, as I'm totally unsure of the state and future
of TL-p4...

Hmm, no. I build it from the sources of TL2005, as everything is on teh
DVD.

Is there a specific reason to do? If yes, I can add a patch (is there a
patch that applies to the texlive depot source)?

Best wishes

If you can send me a diff which can be applied to the source.tar.bz2
(unpacked) of TeXlive, I will incorporate it.

But note: I have alreadz patched libs/xpdf myself to 3.01pl1, so only
the changes to pdftex itself are necessary.

Thanks a lot!

The problem of systems locked down by uncooperative and unsympathetic
admins is not restricted to Windows.  With teTeX it has always been
possible for a user to put the texmf trees and binaries in a user disk area
(USB, network, CD, etc.) and run TeX after adjusting the PATH variable.
I think this still holds for TL2005 on unix/linux and on Win32.

I don't know MikTeX well enough to know if there is a way to work around
user privilege constraints, but certainly for TL2005 you can generate a tree

with Win32 binaries using a personal system or even linux, copy the tree to
another system, arrange to add the bin/win32 directory to the path in a
shell window, and run TeX.  You may need to adjust texmf.cnf.

MikTeX uses registry settings. These don't have to be HKLM (local
machine) settings, but KHCU (current user) settings work just as
well. You could create these settings with a little vbscript on the
cd or usb drive. This script would also have to create a user tree
and a filename database. If anybody is interested, I'll have a go at
it.

Hi guys,

I switched to Ubuntu, installed TeX Live 2005 and I have problem with

not!

Yes, creating the tree isn't the problem: I just wanted to know if
anyone had done it already for a run-from-CD TL2005 instead of a DVD.
Extracting the binaries and a suitable subset ("recommended") is
straightforward: it's making the setup suitably foolproof which takes
the time.

I don't know anything about Registry settings, but the users in question
say they can't do anything which involves creating or changing the
Registry (ie install software). Understandably system-wide settings
would be locked (are those HKLM?) but can users normally do things to
KHCU settings?

If they use TL (teTeX) instead of MikTeX, my understanding is that they
don't need to tinker with the Registry; is that correct? If so, then
something somewhere is going to have to set the path to whatever disk
letter the CD or USB ends up at, and somehow make that path propagate
to whatever editor interface the user runs.

In Wignornance :-)

Hi Peter,

    anyone had done it already for a run-from-CD TL2005 instead of a DVD.

Not to my knowledge.

    it's making the setup suitably foolproof which takes
    the time.

What I would do is start with the live image, remove all the binaries
you are not interested in, and see how much more has to go after that.
The sources are probably the only other big thing that is easy to
remove.  Whether that will get you to 700mb, I don't know.  I doubt it.
Probably have to start removing packages.  Good luck :).

BTW, some directory on the hard disk will still have to be writable, so
the format files, among other things, can be created.  Hopefully the
sysadmins will permit that much.  (I've kind of thought we should
include format files in the distribution, so that we could have
something that was truly live, but it hasn't happened yet.)

If you do come up with a live CD image, it would be a nice thing to have
available for others, so let me know, ok?

Cheers,
karl

In what file does this code appear?  (Sorry, I can't balance the parens
in the transcript backwards and be sure.)  And what does the surrounding
code look like?

The error rather looks like something is getting expanded when it
shouldn't be, but it's hard to say anything for sure from this fragment.

In TL 2005, \pdfoutput is defined as 0 in dvi-output latex's.  In all
previous years, it has been undefined.  Perhaps that is somehow related
to the error. 

    I've found out that pdfcslatex and cslatex are symlinked to the same  
    binary...and I'm even more perplexed :)

pdftex (the program) can output dvi just fine.  It's always been able
to.  It retains all of the original tex.

Best,

This is an instance of the renaming of packages. Good that you spotted
this, but it should be solved by now.

The problem is the following:

cm-super 0.3.3-2 depends on texlive-fontsrecommended | tetex-base

but there is no texlive-fontsrecommended anymore, but
texlive-fonts-recommended.

The new cm-super 0.3.3-3 which is already uploaded and should be in the
debian mirror by today fixes this problem.

So please wait half a day and retry, you need cm-super >= 0.3.3-3, I add
this dependency now to the config file, thanks for spotting this.

Best wishes

I have done something like it with a run-from-the-network install,
for users with minimal privileges. I managed to avoid system-wide
HKCU settings.

I used the open source NSIS installer, but I think now that vbscript
would also work. Vbscript is part of w2k en xp. It can detect its
own location and has some support for regular expressions, so this
would give you your disk letter.

TeXnicCenter and WinEdt will pick up the MikTeX registry
settings when they are started up for the first time.

Hi all!

I have added the following things:
. correct dependencies in tl-math-extra and tl-plain-extra, so they
  cannot be installed on tetex
. add a version to the dependency of cm-super
. include pdftex 1.30.5

apt will happily reinstall texlive-math-extra, texlive-plain-extra,
texlive-fonts-extra, but texlive-base-bin (with the new pdftex) you have
to tell apt to install:
	apt-get install --reinstall texlive-base-bin
(and be sure that apt-get redownloads the file).

After a few more days of internal testing I will ask Neil to upload this
version, if there are no new bad surprises.

Best wishes

Norbert

It looks like if I can find the filelist for the "minimal" install
this comes in at around 350Mb.

Yes, I was surprised (not having followed the list) to find that TL2005
generates formats for each new user the first time you use it, and
stuffs them into a .directory in your login directory. Very weird way
to go when you're used to the whole system having one .fmt file for
each app, stored centrally. I'd lobby VERY hard for not doing this,
and for including the .fmt files in the distro.

Absolutely. I'm aiming to do CD and USB.

\Gm@checkdrivers is from geometry.sty, which contains the following test:

\def\Gm@checkdrivers{%
   \ifx\pdfpagewidth\@undefined\else
     \ifnum\pdfoutput=\@ne
       \Gm@setdriver{pdftex}%
     \fi
   \fi
  ...}

I contacted Hideo Umeki in late October and he agreed to change the 
pdftests to use the ifpdf package instead.

However, the real culprit is the cslatex.ini file in TL2005. It ends 
with the following bit of code:

\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined \else % added in Feb. 2005
    \catcode`\{=1  \catcode`\}=2
    \def\tmpa{\pdfcslatex}
    \expandafter\def\expandafter\tmpb\expandafter{\csname\jobname\endcsname}
    \ifx\tmpa\tmpb %% PDFTeX with PDF output
       \message {jobname=pdfcslatex, PDF output initialised.}
       \openin0=pdftexconfig.tex
       \ifeof0 \message{WARNING: pdftexconfig.tex does not exist.
                        I set \string\pdfoutput=1 only.}%
       \else \closein0 \input pdftexconfig.tex
       \fi
       \pdfoutput=1
    \else
       \message {jobname=cslatex with pdftex, DVI output initialised.}
       \pdfoutput=0
       \let\oripdfoutput=\pdfoutput \let\pdfoutput=\undefined
    \fi
    \let\tmpa=\undefined \let\tmpb=\undefined
    \catcode`\{=12
\fi

I don't see why this
   \let\oripdfoutput=\pdfoutput \let\pdfoutput=\undefined
is needed.

By comparison, the cslatex.ini file on my Mac (using gwTeX) starts out 
with this:

\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
\else
   \ifx\pdfoutput\relax
   \else
     \input pdftexconfig
     \pdfoutput=0
   \fi
\fi

I am the author of this code. If you decide to use the cslatex with only
dvi output, then you can do it by standard TeX engine or by pdftex with
\pdfoutput=0. The result have to be identical. I decided that the behavior
of the user-macros has to be the same as if standard TeX engine is used.
This is a reason of "\let\pdfoutput=\undefined". May be the
user-macros can include the following code:

\ifx\pdfoutoput\undefined .. dvi output \else .. pdftex setting \fi

This code must work.

This is evident mistake of an author of the package from which this code
is mentioned. The command "\ifnum\pdfoutput=\@ne" cannot work if standard
TeX engine (non-pdftex engine) is used. Please report the bug to the
author of this package.

Message-ID: <22af238a0512161754j2ad4c860u29ec7e0bfe44d6fa@mail.gmail.com>

Not all the commonly used perl scripts in the texmf tree have corresponding
.exe files in bin/win32.  For those lucky enough to avoid Win32, irun is
a wrapper that is used to create filename.exe to run perl on
"kpathsea -format=texmfscripts filename".

1.  irun.exe must be writable.  In the default install it is not.

2.  pdfcrop.exe (e.g., texmf/scripts/pdfcrop/pdfcrop.pl) complains
of missing Functions.pm with the following code:

  use File::Spec::Functions qw(devnull);
  $my $null = devnull();

The code below for me on Win XP with the TL2005 perl, and in Fedora Core 4
(perl-5.8.6-18) but I have no idea how portable this is:

  use File::Spec;
  my $null = File::Spec->devnull();

Hi Nagesh,

    texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso.bz2

You have to uncompress this with the "bunzip2" program (from the bzip2
package, see bzip.org).  The result is a CD image which you can burn to
an actual disc or mount virtually and install from that way (I assume
Windows is capable).

If this all seems like too much trouble, consider joining a user group
and getting the software sent to you ...

Hope this helps,
Karl

Hello,

I'd like to report that there's an obsolete version of the ttf2afm utility in the TeXLive distribution.
There's currently a version from 2004-11-24. But in January 2005, Han The Thanh has added a new option to print Unicode glyphs (and some other improvements) - see http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2005-January/005597.html

Could you please add the recent version of ttf2afm into the TeXLive distribution?

Many thanks,
Richard G.

If try to get the documention of the importend LaTeX package "geomtery"

  texdoc geometry

I get only the html page

  texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue/entries/geometry.html

Much better would be

  texmf-dist/doc/latex/geometry/manual.pdf@

    Probably renaming this to geometry.pdf would be enough.

But we don't want to rename files from the original distribution, as we've
discussed ad infinitum.

I suppose it is a matter of the entry in the texdoc* data file.

Hi Richard,

Thanks for the report.

    Could you please add the recent version of ttf2afm into the TeXLive
    distribution?

As far as I can tell, TL gets ttf2afm from the pdftex distribution.

Given that Thanh is a principal maintainer of pdftex, I imagine it
should not be impossible to get the new version into pdftex :).  Thanh,
Martin, anyone?

Thanks,

The tetex texdoc script uses find to search for matching files, while
texdoctk
(a perl script) uses a data file, and does correctly find
../geometry/manual.pdf.

    The tetex texdoc script uses find to search for matching files, 

So then the question is why texdoc geometry works in teTeX.  Unless
Thomas renamed geometry/manual.pdf.  Can someone check into that?

Renaming manual.pdf to <package>.pdf is not a good idea because
<package>.pdf clashes with "pdflatex <package>.dtx".  Heiko described
this problem a few months ago and provided some solutions.

  > I suppose it is a matter of the entry in the texdoc* data file.

It's not that easy because texdoc doesn't use a database but depends
on filenames (unlike texdoctk).

This problem can only be solved by a file system standard for
documentation files.  As Heiko pointed out, we need directory names as
well, for instance

    geometry/geometry.pdf
    geometry/manual.pdf
    geometry/example1.tex 
    geometry/example1.pdf 
    geometry/example2.tex 
    geometry/example2.pdf 
    geometry/geometry.xml

where geometry.xml provides some meta information which can be used by
texdoc, but also can be used to create the texdoctk database.

In TL there are many files which cannot be accessed by texdoctk yet.
A structure like

   texmf/doc/<language>/<category>/<package>/<some files>

or

   texmf/doc/<category>/<package>/<language>/<some files>

would be very helpful.  And it's almost impossible to make
documentation which had been translated into many languages available
in texdoctk.

I think that it is reasonable to create the texdoctk menu dynamically
depending of the value of $LC_LANG.

Shouldn't we work out such a file system standard for documentation
before TL-2006 development begins?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, exactly. I was talking about the Windows binary - TTF2AFM.EXE (see the message subject).
After some needless bothering of Hans Hagen (ConTeXt author), I've got the current version from him.
It is included in the MSWinTeX package on the Pragma-ADE website:

http://www.pragma-ade.com/context/install/mswintex.zip

I guess these Win32 binaries should be included into TeXLive. Please look at them.

Thanks,
Richard

  > tetex has a geometry.pdf

On CTAN, there is a file geometry.dtx which produces two drivers,
geometry.drv and manual.drv.

The difference between the drivers is that manual.drv doesn't compile
the source code section.

There is also a file manual.pdf on CTAN (convenient for people
exploring CTAN with web browsers) which is used in TeXLive.

Thomas obviously compiled geometry.drv himself and I suppose that he
has \OnlyDescription in ltxdoc.cfg to suppress the source code.

So we have two files derived from the same source with different names
and different time stamps though nobody renamed a file...

  Reinhard

    In TL there are many files which cannot be accessed by texdoctk yet.

I admit I don't see that as sufficient reason to invent strict new
directory structures.

It seems to me that what would be most general/useful is to create
doc-related data files which list what files are available, what
language they are in, and so on.  texdoc/texdoctk could be modified to
read such files much more easily than we change the whole tree around.

This also has the advantage of being incremental - doc descriptions can
be created for the most important packages first, whichever ones people
care to work on, and gradually be extended.

Yes but we need some conventions for the file system to avoid name
clashes.  There are too many files "manual.pdf" yet.

When I suggested a scheme like

     texmf/doc/<category>/<package>/...

I always thought about whether we need <category> at all.  But I think
that we need it, we can no longer rely on the fact that filenames are
unique on a system.  We have 55,312 files in TL already.

XML files don't help.  We need a directory standard to avoid name
clashes.  And Context and LaTeX are different worlds.  I think that
Hans should name his files as he likes without trying to avoid name
clashes with LaTeX files.  This can only be achieved with a proper
file system standard.

And if we are in luck, the number of files increases linearly with
time. Then we have 100,000 files in ten years.  But I fear that it
increases exponentially.  Sigh.

We really depend on directories.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    There are too many files "manual.pdf" yet.

I fundamentally disagree.  A system where every package author who is
using manual.pdf now has to change, before the system will be usable, is
not practical, it seems to me.  That's why I suggested what I did.

    Hans should name his files as he likes without trying to avoid name
    clashes with LaTeX files.  This can only be achieved with a proper
    file system standard.

That's a whole different problem.  We solve it now by having different
search paths for different programs, which is certainly not ideal, but
it is not obvious to me how to do better.

And those *are* uniquely named, generally. So why not use the directory
names as information and combine that with a set of fixed standard names
(like manual, readme, etc)? When the file is called

    doc/latex/geometry/manual.pdf

"dtexdoc geometry" could open it and "dtexdoc --all geometry" could open
all PDF files in the directory. A "dtexdoc -all latex" could open all
LaTeX docs (a lot) and a "dtexdoc --all context"  could open all the
ConTeXt docs (which have names I always forget).

Just an idea but it might be very comfortable.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXlive for Debian - upload to experimental
Message-ID: <20051222163110.GC21601@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear Neil, dear J?rg, dear all!

I have done another rebuild of the TeX live packages. Now all the
dependencies/conflicts with tetex are correct and let those packages
cooperate.

Neil: Please if you find time upload the packages to experimental. You
can get all the stuff from the usual place:

    	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
    	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

The packages build on current pbuilder chroot, and install onto a clean
pbuilder system (and remove and purge).

I hope that we now can agree that the packages are ready for inclusion
into experimental. 

I add below here a short description of changes which I have already
sent to J?rg. The most important change IMHO is the cooperation with
tetex, which lets users of tetex on Debian use several packages of the
texlive family.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear ftp masters!

After the first try to submit the texlive packages and the rejection a
long discussion on debian-devel developed [1] [2]. I have prepared a 
new set of packages and plan to upload them to experimental via my 
sponsor. But before doing this (it is a big package to move around) I
would like to ask wether you see any a-priori problems with the changes
I made, or with changes I didn't made but you wanted to have. So here
is a short description of the changes. If you have any comments please
let me know, that I can incorporate them.

1) packages names and source packages
=====================================

The packages have been renamed according to standards used in Debian, as
discussed in the above mentioned thread. Furthermore, there are now only
five source packages (texlive-bin for arch=any, and texlive-doc,
texlive-lang, texlive-base, texlive-extra) grouped after importance and
arch.

2) removed and new packages, reuse of stuff already in Debian
=============================================================

Sevaral packages have been removed (texlive-ps-utils, texlive-ttf-utils,
texlive-graphics-tools, texlive-lang-arab, texlive-htmlxml) as they are 
either not directly related to TeX (former three) and/or are present in 
Debian (later two). Bugs and patches have been filed and send to those 
packages in need of upgrade (arabtex is already updated, tipa expects
an NMU).
Some TeX packages are not included in the source and binary debian packages,
as they are in Debian and need only some fixes (prosper, texpower,
tpslifonts, tipa, lcdf-typetools). These packages have been repackaged
(only changed control file) and put on the tug server [3] for interim use.
A new packages texlive has been created which pulls in all texlive
packages plus those which are already in Debian and not build from 
texlive sources, to get a complete system mirroring an installation
of TeX live from the original DVD.
More packages are in the process of being singled out respectivly updated
in the Debian repository, to reduce duplication.

3) interaction with tetex and other packages
============================================

The dependencies of some of the texlive packages have been modified that
they can be used with tetex3 (in unstable). This will bring many of the
fonts and style files up to now not available for teTeX on Debian into
easy reach.

Packages depending only on teTeX but working with texlive have been 
repackaged (only control file edited) and put onto the tug server to be
used with the texlive packages. As soon as texlive enters Debian, I will
file bugs to the respective packages.

4) Removal of problematic material
==================================

At the request of the author, XyMTeX will be removed from next
years TeX live. It has been already removed from the debian packages
of this year, both from .orig.tar.gz and from the binary deb.

Furthermore, ppower has also been removed as it contains a jar file 
without sources. There is an ITP [4] and I hope the maintainer can get
the java sources and build a proper Debian package.

Thanks again for all your hard work, Norbert.   I admit that my personal
inclination is to stick
with the standard tex live distribution, but I get involved helping a couple
small secretariats that use TeX for reports with authors spread across the
globe, and find most authors prefer to
stick with software they can install via the distribution's package manager,
so I'm sure your
efforts will make life easier for lots of people.

aptitude picked up the new versions, but I had a small problem with
"apt-get install texlive-plain-extra":

Setting up texlive-plain-extra (2005-1) ...
Running mktexlsr. This may take some time. ... done.

 ---
# cat /tmp/texlive.fmtutil.XX52cYKc
fmtutil: format `eplain' not available.
 ---

The texmf/tex/eplain directory was missing.

Copying the texmf-dist/tex/eplain directory from an original TeX Live 2005
tree to my
/usr/local/share/texmf tree was sufficient to get past the problem.   I
haven't
installed all the packages due to space/time constraints, so maybe
texmf/tex/eplain
comes in a different package.

Bummer. Thanks for spotting this. I have tested many combinations, but
this one I left out. Funny enough, today morning I started to write some
automatic test procedure that should test all installations, but that
isn't ready for now.

eplain.ini is in texlive-formats-extra, while the fmt definition is in
texlive-plain-extra. This is an upstream perforce bug I will fix in
debian (and upstream).

Thanks for spotting it

Best wishes

Dear All (and Norbert and Klaus in particular),

Just as a data point, today I received some feedback from Klaus Guntermann
(upstream maintainer of ppower4) and he told me that he is busy this end
of year.

I think, on the other hand, that we could collaboratively (read: using
Subversion) put the sources of ppower4 into alioth, say, and work on it
there, if Klaus thinks that there are points that can be improved in the
source code.

This way, we would have one package that I (and actually, quite a lot of
friends) use for presentations packaged in Debian.

What do you think of this? Opinions are quite welcome.


Thanks, Rog?rio Brito.

I've found a typo in an hfb2gf config file, and I've committed it to
the P4 repository.  In case you want a complete stop of updating
within the repository, or in case you are moving the whole TeXLive
tree to a different locatation, please inform me.

When are you done?  I've just discovered another bug:

  mktexmf csso1212

generates a file csso1212.mf which it shouldn't do -- it is a CJK font
to be handled by hbf2gf.  It's a bug in mktexmf: The $rootname
variable holds the font name without the trailing digits (`csso'), but
the `case' statement later on tests whether the font name is identical
to `csso12[0-5][0-9]' which always fails.

Are you recreating all the history? If not, we have to keep a
read-only version of p4 for historians.

I've just installed TL 2005 and have been doing a few tests

it seems that dvips cannot find files that are specified uaing specific 
path.

Example

\listfiles
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
tekst
\includegraphics{/home/daleif/Signet}
\end{document}

*File List*
  article.cls    2004/02/16 v1.4f Standard LaTeX document class
   size10.clo    2004/02/16 v1.4f Standard LaTeX file (size option)
graphicx.sty    1999/02/16 v1.0f Enhanced LaTeX Graphics (DPC,SPQR)
   keyval.sty    1999/03/16 v1.13 key=value parser (DPC)
graphics.sty    2001/07/07 v1.0n Standard LaTeX Graphics (DPC,SPQR)
     trig.sty    1999/03/16 v1.09 sin cos tan (DPC)
graphics.cfg    2001/08/31 v1.1 graphics configuration of teTeX/TeXLive
    dvips.def    1999/02/16 v3.0i Driver-dependant file (DPC,SPQR)

And then

I can confirm this.

I guess (!) that dvips does not accept absolute path names. Which would
be strange.

especially because the versions prior to TL2005 does with out any problems

Does anyone know how to get the old functionality back?

The dvips info file describes the "-R" flag:

`-R'
     Run securely.  This disables shell command execution in `\special'
     (via ``', *note Dynamic creation of graphics::) and config files
     (via the `E' option, *note Configuration file commands::), and
     opening of any absolute filenames.

Try "dvips -R0 ..."

    Are you recreating all the history? 

I am not planning to.  It is hard enough just to get the files checked
in.  From what I see on the web, attempting to migrate all the history
would make it even more painful.

    If not, we have to keep a read-only version of p4 for historians.

This should be no problem.  From what I gather, no license is needed for
read-only operation.

Also, all the change listings and log messages and such will continue to
be available (in Build/cdbuild/logs), which, while not a substitute for
the actual changes, are at least sometimes useful.

Thanks for both.

    When are you done?

I don't know.  Don't hold your breath.  I lost a week due to illness

That did the trick, thanks. It might have been a good idea to write this 
somewhere, i.e. that the normal behavior of dvips have changed.

I'm going to change this globally.

It's the z option in config.ps, and probably the comment in there should
also mention absolute pathnames, not only commands in \special.

Then edit

% \specials.  Dvips allows this by default.
% z1

Yes, I found it, is now using this:

% z1 is "secure", i.e., inhibits execution of `shell commands` in
% \specials.  Dvips allows this by default.
% z1
z0

I haven't found anything hinting this to absolute paths... which is the 
real issue here. It takes a little while figuring out whats wrong.

In the dvips info manual, the very short description for z only says
that it is the same as the commandline switch -R, and there you have the
explanation.  But you are right, it should also be in config.ps.

And I think it sould have been in the TeXLive documentation, since this is 
something that has changed from last year.

I discussed this (with Karl I think) a while back and proposed a  
change. Currently, not only absolute paths are not permitted but also  
relative paths going up. That plays havoc with people having layouts  
like

.../chapters
.../images

because the inclusions would be of the form ../images/foo.eps

I suggested that default behaviour would accept relative but not  
absolute paths (as these can be used to read system information in a  
reliable way) and of course not the shell escapes.

I still have to make that change to dvips, but I will when we have  
moved away from p4.

Unless of course everybody else thinks this is a bad idea.

go ahead ... such a feature would make using tex in workflows much 
easier; i never unerstood this limitation

maybe make it configurable, so that

../../graphics/blabla/

is also permitted, i.e. something parentlevel=2 or so

If you block absolute paths then you have to block relative paths like
[../]^N for N
larger than the current depth,  since those are effectively the same as
absolute
paths.  Where security is concerned, simplicity is an advantage, so I don't
see a
reason to change from the current behaviour.

I think it is a bad idea, but then I tend to think dvi-anything that
requires
maintenance is a bad idea.  I hardly ever use dvi anymore except to track
down other people's problems.  If we make dvips secure enough so it can't do
anything useful then people will stop bothering me.

My pdftex-1.30.5 handles images with absolute paths -- is there a mechanism
to block absolute and upwards relative paths in pdftex?

Time might be better spent considering how to deal with absolute paths in
pdftex and/or improving the documentation.

    And I think it sould have been in the TeXLive documentation, since
    this is something that has changed from last year.

It should have been.  I need people to help me find these things before
the release.  I thought I was doing good to update the dvips
documentation.  Anyway, I added it to the bugs.html page, which is about
all I can do at this point.

I'll update the config.ps comment when svn is online.

    I discussed this (with Karl I think) a while back and proposed a  

Yes.

The basic question is whether secure operation or nonsecure operation
should be the default.  (Also, dvips is just one program.  In general,
TeX programs don't bother to do these kinds of checks.  So is it better
for dvips to be paranoid, or not?  I don't know ...)

    That plays havoc with people having layouts  

My approach is to put .. in TEXINPUTS.

    Unless of course everybody else thinks this is a bad idea.

I think it is fine to have the three levels you and I discussed, Gerben:
0) anything goes;
1) absolute/relative paths ok, shell escapes not ok;
2) nothing ok.


Thanks,

They are similar, but not equivalent.  If absolute paths are
disallowed, what can be damaged if you "cd /tmp" before you execute
anything?

  > Where security is concerned, simplicity is an advantage,

That's true.  And it is helpful when similar programs behave similar
(regarding configuration), see below.

Why doesn't dvips use openin_any from texmf.cnf?   
______________________________________________________________________
% Allow TeX \openin, \openout, or \input on filenames starting with `.'
% (e.g., .rhosts) or outside the current tree (e.g., /etc/passwd)?
% a (any)        : any file can be opened.
% r (restricted) : disallow opening "dotfiles".
% p (paranoid)   : as 'r' and disallow going to parent directories, and
%                  restrict absolute paths to be under $TEXMFOUTPUT.
openout_any = p
openin_any = a
______________________________________________________________________

I do not see a good reason why dvips cannot use them.  They can be
overwritten on the command line.  The default values in tetex and TL
are quite reasonable.  I then suggest *not* to set the z-option in any
config.* file.  Then graphics inclusion in pdftex and dvips will have
the same restrictions and there is only one place where this has to be
configured. 

Karl, your suggestion

  > 0) anything goes;
  > 1) absolute/relative paths ok, shell escapes not ok;
  > 2) nothing ok.

is very similar to what we already have for *tex.

BTW., shell escapes had been removed from dvips some time ago.
libgz is now compiled into the binary so that dvips still can include
compressed graphic files.  No security problems are to be expected
here.

Hans, I do not see any advantage for something like parentlevel=2.
People might set this variable to a reasonable value and then forget
that this variable exists.  But most people will not be aware if this
and then wonder why ../../graphics/blabla/ works but
../../../graphics/blabla/ fails.  And people do not care about the
directory where they execute files.  I vote for not implementing this
variable to keep things simple. 

I do not see any big security problems with dvips at all:  The user
decides where dvips output goes.  This cannot be specified in a dvi
file.

For input files this is a bit more difficult, a PostScript file can
have arbitrary PostScript code inside which allows reading and
creating arbitrary files.  But this code is not executed by dvips.
The security settings in ghostscript are quite restrictive and I
suppose that you cannot destroy anything if you try to open a file in
a printer.

It does not matter very much from which directory an included graphic
file comes.  A bit more has to be done to make an included graphic
harmful.  Only if you provide a PS header which redefines the graphic
file inclusion code in dvips, then you can probably make something
like \includegraphics{/etc/passwd} work.  And you also have to
redefine \includegraphics so that it doesn't insist on having a
%%BoundingBox comment in /etc/passwd.  Good luck!

It is much easier to insert malicious PS code into the graphics file.
But this cannot be prevented by dvips.  This code has to be executed
by a PS interpreter.

However, if you are still concerned about security issues, what has to
be done to make things absolutely secure?

A few years ago I was wondering what can be done with Type1 fonts.
Did you know that you can add a PostScript SPECIAL to a virtual font
which contains arbitrary PS code, i.e. which creates an arbitrary file
when this font is processed by a PS interpreter?  I did this
successfully.  Well, you explicitly have to use the -dNOSAFER option
in ghostscript.  Otherwise, all you'll get is an error message.

I tried this many years ago and all I can tell is that gs had been
absolutely secure at this time.  Today, gs developers are much more
paranoid, which is somtimes a bit annoying.

Can anyone imagine a situation where dvips is a security problem
rather than the PS interpreter?

What do you think about using the value of openin_any as a default and
removing all variables which provide such restrictions from dvips'
config.* files (if necessary)?  Users can add them if necessary,
though I don't know a good reason.

George's statement "simplicity is an advantage" is not only true if we
talk about security.  If similar programs can be configured the same
way or can even share the same variables in the config file, it is
easier for users to understand how the system works, and it is of
course easier to maintain the documentation.

Another thing is confusing:

dvips looks for a file ${HOME}/.dvipsrc

We have now $TEXMFHOME in all web2c based distributions and I think
that dvips should look there instead.  It should be sufficient to set
the variable $DVIPSRC properly in texmf.cnf (see page 16 in the dvips
manual).  It is highly desirable if this file will not be hidden,
i.e. it's name doesn't start with a dot.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Perhaps not damaged, but on some systems, that simply won't work.

Recent GNU/Linux, and possibly other operating systems, allow
filesystem mounts in no-execute mode, and some systems are set to
mount /tmp and /var/tmp that way.  It is then impossible to run any
executable that resides in those directory trees without first copying
it to some other filesystem.  Of course, for shell scripts, one can
still do "sh < /tmp/malicious-script.sh", "perl < /tmp/nasty-stuff.pl",
and so on.

The opening up of avenues in DVI, PostScript, PDF, and fonts for
execution of arbitrary code during simple VIEWING of those files is a
step not to be taken lightly.  Such a facility was tried in TeX in the
1980s at Heidelberg, and then quickly removed when someone exploited
it a short time later for nefarious purposes.

For most users, "viewing" means "reading", and by implication, means
"NOT WRITING".

Of these only openout_any is described in the web2c manual -- and
it's missing in the index. Is openin_any described anywhere else
besides texmf.cnf? Btw: texmf.cnf(5) would be great.

Some sites don't allow users to write in /tmp (they have to use $HOME/tmp)
both to avoid information leakage and the problems when some users process
fills /tmp.

If you allow [../]^N then you don't need absolute paths to get at
files above /tmp.
$ cd /tmp
$ ls -i /etc/passwd ../../../../../../etc/passwd
13075025 /etc/passwd  13075025 ../../../../../../etc/passwd

It is question of policy -- code that might be run on files downloaded
from the net should not be able to read sensitive files such as those in
/etc.
A mechanism that prevents '../../' from reaching the root directory
might be less problematic.

For input files this is a bit more difficult, a PostScript file can

History shows us many failures to imagine situations that turned out to be
security problems.  "Paranoid" configurations are for sites that aren't
willing to rely on imagination.

The issues are not unique to TeX, so it may be worth looking for
examples in other packages.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXlive for Debian - upload to experimental
Message-ID: <20051229160833.GA27728@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear Neil, dear J?rg, dear all!

Another day, another round, another package killed, another 33Mb gone.

I have removed texlive-lang-cjk (from orig.tar.gz and the whole deb), as
the coming packages latex-cjk-all will provide everything. So the size
is stripped down again quite a lot.

Furthermore, all the packages have beein install-remove-install-purge
tested in a clean pbuilder environment. All passed this test but the
package `texlive', but this is a texinfo bug which will be fixed with
the next upload of texinfo (and this bug only occurs in very seldom
circumstances).

The packages also now include a diagramm of the dependency tree, and all
documentation is now collected into /u/s/d/texlive-doc.

Neil: Please if you find time upload the packages to experimental. You
can get all the stuff from the usual place. Note that the .orig.tar.gz
have changed again, since I removed texlive-lang-cjk. Please get all.

    	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
    	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

I hope that we now can agree that the packages are ready for inclusion
into experimental. 

I include the extended short description you all have already seen.
Further down is a the complete ChangeLog from the first upload try to
the current status.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear ftp masters!

After the first try to submit the texlive packages and the rejection a
long discussion on debian-devel developed [1] [2]. Following is a 
description of the changes/advances of the packages wrt to last version.

Contents:
=========
1) packages names and source packages
2) removed and new packages, reuse of stuff already in Debian
3) interaction with tetex and other packages
4) Removal of problematic material
5) Testing procedure


1) packages names and source packages
=====================================

The packages have been renamed according to standards used in Debian, as
discussed in the above mentioned thread. Furthermore, there are now only
five source packages (texlive-bin for arch=any, and texlive-doc,
texlive-lang, texlive-base, texlive-extra) grouped after importance and
arch.

2) removed and new packages, reuse of stuff already in Debian
=============================================================

Sevaral packages have been removed (texlive-ps-utils, texlive-ttf-utils,
texlive-graphics-tools, texlive-lang-arab, texlive-htmlxml, texlive-lang-cjk) 
as they are either not directly related to TeX (former three) and/or 
are present in Debian (later three). Bugs and patches have been filed and 
send to those packages in need of upgrade (arabtex is already updated,
tipa expects an NMU). Especially the removal of texlive-lang-cjk reduced
the packages (orig.tar.gz, source, bin) a lot.
Some TeX packages are not included in the source and binary debian packages,
as they are in Debian and need only some fixes (prosper, texpower,
tpslifonts, tipa, lcdf-typetools). These packages have been repackaged
(only changed control file) and put on the tug server [3] for interim use.
A new packages texlive has been created which pulls in all texlive
packages plus those which are already in Debian and not build from 
texlive sources, to get a complete system mirroring an installation
of TeX live from the original DVD.
More packages are in the process of being singled out respectivly updated
in the Debian repository, to reduce duplication.

3) interaction with tetex and other packages
============================================

The dependencies of some of the texlive packages have been modified that
they can be used with tetex3 (in unstable). This will bring many of the
fonts and style files up to now not available for teTeX on Debian into
easy reach.

A graphics showing the dependencies of the the texlive packages and
marking those which can be installed together with tetex is included
in the texlive-doc-base package (tl4deb-deptree.pdf).

Packages depending only on teTeX but working with texlive have been 
repackaged (only control file edited) and put onto the tug server to be
used with the texlive packages. As soon as texlive enters Debian, I will
file bugs to the respective packages.

4) Removal of problematic material
==================================

At the request of the author, XyMTeX will be removed from next
years TeX live. It has been already removed from the debian packages
of this year, both from .orig.tar.gz and from the binary deb.

Furthermore, ppower has also been removed as it contains a jar file 
without sources. There is an ITP [4] and I hope the maintainer can get
the java sources and build a proper Debian package.

5) Testing procedure
====================

Each single package has gone through a full aptitude install - remove -
install - purge cycle in a clean pbuilder chroot.

All packages succeeded this test but `texlive', but the breakage of `texlive'
is bound to an error in texinfo, which calls fmtutil-sys without assuring
that texlive-base-bin is configured. This error will be fixed in the next
upload of texinfo.

And given that we are reading, is it OK that (1) is the default

    Is openin_any described anywhere else
    besides texmf.cnf? 

Have to add it, I guess.  Thanks for pointing that out.

    Btw: texmf.cnf(5) would be great.

Having two independent documents to update doesn't sound like a good
idea to me -- as you've already seen, even one place can't be kept up to
date.  Automatically creating a texmf.cnf.5 from the Texinfo seems
plausible (maybe not in perfect man page style, but who cares), if
anyone cares to do it.  I don't :).

Hi all!

AM I stupid?
        \documentclass[a4paper,landscape]{article}
does not produce landscape text? Is this the intention? It does only
change the paperwidth and leaves the textwidth as it is. But at least
it changes the textheight.

I had to use geometry to get it right, is this really necessary?

I have always used the following to ensure landscape got done:

\documentclass[a4paper,landscape]{article}
\usepackage[landscape,margin=2cm]{geometry}
\special{geometry}

(bearing in mind I'm a dvips user most of the time).

That's expected behaviour. LaTeX knows only the dimensions of the paper,
rotation of the text to the landscape orientation is the task of the
driver. You have to know which driver will be used for output and send the
command to it. I have commands for dvips and pdftex in my private package.

thanks for the hint.  I'll keep it in mind when I write scripts.
Fortunately, the program getnonfreefonts(1) in TeXLive-2005 executes
programs in $TMP rather than in /tmp.  The next version will check
whether /tmp is non-executable and provide a message which tells less
experienced users how to proceed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

There is long-standing, and widespread, practice in the Unix world of
referring to a temporary directory in scripts via the name TMPDIR,
rather than TMP.

For example, on Sun Solaris 10, here are manual pages for some
programs that use TMPDIR:

	% grep -l TMPDIR /usr/share/man/man*/*
	/usr/share/man/man1/ar.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/as.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/cpio.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/ed.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/gpatch.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/lari.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/lorder.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/mktemp.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/pax.1
	/usr/share/man/man1/prex.1
	/usr/share/man/man1m/nispopulate.1m
	/usr/share/man/man1m/pkgadd.1m
	/usr/share/man/man1m/ufsrestore.1m
	/usr/share/man/man3c/tmpnam.3c
	/usr/share/man/man7fs/tmpfs.7fs

On GNU/Linux, the list is even longer: 50 on one of my systems.

The Sun tmpfs manual page says:
