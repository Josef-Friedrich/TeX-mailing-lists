    ntheorem in TL is very old.

It matches the version on CTAN.  (The dates are slightly different, but
the contents are the same.)

I assume you have a newer version from somewhere.  Can you get the
author to upload it to CTAN?

Thanks,
Karl

Hi,
I just updated the files from tldevsrc.  I'm testing now with the
latest version and without having local texmf-trees in $TEXMF.

It seems that everything works well now ecxept that

   Master/texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts

is not up-to-date.

Recently Eitan fixed a bug concerning /dotlessi and provided support
for Iwona and Kurier.

There is still a small problem with /dcroat in Iwona and Kurier small
caps fonts, I'll send Eitan the files he needs to fix it.

Nevertheless, it would be nice if tex4ht is kept up-to-date so that I
can test it without having local texmf-trees in the search path, which
might hide some errors.

How much time do we have until the texmf tree is frozen?  I'll ask
Thomas Ruedas to add plnfss.txt and vntex.txt to the texdoctk
database.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

Reinhard,

I asked Karl delay refreshing the htf-fonts as much as possible.
That is because the new htf files are still buggy, and due to name
collisions with old fonts they have negative side effects on the usage
of the old fonts.   

I almost done resolving the main collision problems, so it is now fine
with me to get the htf fonts loaded into the texmf-tree.  However, I
hope the fonts will be refreshed close to the time that the tree is to
be frozen.

Ok, now that you've tried it, I will update it again shortly, and then

    How much time do we have until the texmf tree is frozen?  

I don't know.  A week or two?  We're basically just waiting on the doc

Hi,
I have updated from tldevsrc last night.  There are some map files
missing from updmap.cfg:

  mscorevn.map
  chartervn.map
  iwona.map
  kurier.map

I had to remove 

  MixedMap MnSymbol.map

MnSymbol.map is not present in the current texmf tree.  It has been
removed recently, it is in the version I downloaded 3 weeks ago.

There is a problem with updmap itself.  The files in the Master
directory are not writable, of course.

updmap -e copies updmap.cfg to $TMP but it doesn't change the mode
from 444 to 644 before starting the editor.  The same happens with
updmap --syncwithtrees.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Tests with TLPM/TLPMGUI (1. Update)
Message-ID: <4340FA7C.31468.96100@localhost>

I did enlarge my testbed somewhat: a brand new thinkpad r52 with 
xpsp2, my long running xpsp2, a fresh xpsp2 under vmware.
The behaviour was always the same and in some way unpredictable
and not to understand:

-On a clean machine TLPMGUI works as expected with one exception: the
function 'add packages'. 
-After using TLPMGUI the first time I could not
use 'inst' within TLPM but unist, list ... 
-When I changed the default
settings for the target path from c:\tex to somewhat other, say
c:\texlive, I could use TLPM even inst packages. I do not want to 
enlarge this list with all my tests and results.

May be finally I found the problem:

On a fresh XP the PATH is a string in the registry of type 
REG_EXPAND_SZ looking like
 %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;...

After using TLPMGUI on that system we get a String of type REG_SZ 
with content
c:\tex\bin\win32;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\Syste
m32\Wbem;... This is clearly wrong and as %SystemRoot% is no longer
expanded the whole system is working badly. After correcting the PATH 
via control panel (I put the tex path element to the end) I ended up 
with a string of type REG_EXPAND_SZ again of
%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;...;c:\t
ex\bin\win32 Now TLPMGUI works fine. Adding packages is with no 
problems.

On some of systems (not clear why) the PATH is stored in a string of 
type
REG_SZ with correctly expanded %SystemRoot% like
c:\windows\system32;c:\windows\system32\wben;... On those systems 
TLPMGUI will not show the problems I run in.

With best regards

Okay, I incorporated the ifpdf test into symbols.tex for the next
release.  (I'd rather not use \RequirePackage because I want to
require as few packages as possible.)

> 1) loops indefinately at line 3022:

I just downloaded the TeX Live testing version and was able to
reproduce this problem.  The following is a minimal example which
loops forever:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{arcs}
    \begin{document}
    \overarc{H}ello!
    \end{document}

Interestingly, passing "[11pt]" or "[12pt]" to \documentclass avoids
the infinite loop.  The problem involves the interaction between
arcs.sty, which hasn't changed in a long time (if ever), and
relsize.sty, which has.  I still don't completely understand what
arcs.sty is doing but it looks like it involves iteratively searching
for some particular font size by repeatedly calling \relsize{+1}.  For
some reason, it's unable to reach its target when using newer
relsize.sty files.  If you're interested in trying to diagnose the
problem I can send you my local copy of relsize.sty (v2.0b, 1 Nov
1999).

I'm getting this, too, with the TeX Live testing version but haven't
yet had time to diagnose it.  (I'm still working on the arcs.sty
problem.)

> 1) loops indefinately at line 3022:

Okay, I now have a solution for this one.  Replace the "\newif\ifARCS"
stanza in symbols.tex with the following:

\newif\ifARCS
\newcommand\ARCS{\pkgname{arcs}}
\IfStyFileExists{arcs}
   {\ARCStrue
    \usepackage{arcs}
    \def\RSpercentTolerance{5}  % Prevent \overarc and \underarc from hanging.
   }
   {}

The problem is that arcs.sty uses relsize.sty to reduce the font size by
10 steps then increment it one step at a time until the arc width is the
width of the argument to \overarc or \underarc.  However, because only
certain sizes of Computer Modern are defined, incrementing an extremely
small font by one step rounds the font size back to the original size;
hence, the infinite loop.

Setting \RSpercentTolerance gives relsize.sty enough flexibility with the
font size to ensure that \relsize{+1} does select a strictly larger font.
An alternative solution is to \usepackage{type1cm}.

I burned the 20051004 inst CD and put it in the reader (D:) on a WinXP 
machine after removing (I hope) all trace of previous texlive installs 
from registry and environment.  Tlpmgui loaded, but when I tried to 
perform the install I got an error indicating it couldn't find a file in 
D:\.  The file was in the setup-win32 subdirectory (sorry, didn't make a 
note of the name).  Running tlpmgui manually with a custom install worked 
for me, but I haven't had a chance to try adding or removing components.

I manually edited the WinEDT setup file to look at the value of TLROOT. It 
checks registry entires used by fptex and scans long list of directories 
for a bin\win32 subdirectory, but somehow neglects to consider \TeXLive2005!

Interesting observation -- probably explains anomlies with other packages. 
I suspect the REG_SZ entries are the result of some previous installation 
unrelated to TeX Live 2005.

Hi everyone,

Eitan supplied new win32 binaries in his "fix" tex4ht package.  I'm not
sure if we should take those for TeX Live, or if it's better to stick
with what we have already.

I put the new versions at
  http://tug.org/~karl/t4ht.exe
  http://tug.org/~karl/tex4ht.exe
for now.  Can someone Windows-savvy try them out?

I updated the rest of tex4ht (including all the fonts and minor changes
to a few scripts, propagated to all the architectures) with the fix
version of 2005_10_04_0603.

Thanks,

Not sure if it was compiled with the current kpathsea and web2c? Eitan?
We have tex4ht.exe from Fabrice with all changes made on August, so 
perhaps enough good (??).

The windows binaries rely on internal search engine of tex4ht, they
don't employ kpathsea.  The other kpathsea binaries have not been
compiled with the current version of kpathhsea and web2c.

These binarie should be fine.  The only fix since August was for a

Hi all!

I just now found out that
	antt.tpm
is required by 
	collection-langpolish.tpm
and
	collection-fontsextra.tpm

Would it be possible to decide for one of the two?

Reason: For now when building debian packages, I just include everything
what is required in a collection-tpm. If the same Package-tpm is
required from different collections, then it comes into both debian
packages, which gives bad problems.

If you think that it is wrong to care about this, I will have to find my
own solution where to put antt or better where not to put antt, but I
would prefer a common solution.

Best wishes

Norbert

Hi Norbert,

    If the same Package-tpm is
    required from different collections, then it comes into both debian
    packages, which gives bad problems.

This seems like a fundamental problem with the Debian scripts.  I see
nothing wrong, in principle, with a package being in several
collections.  It can even be useful, as it is in this case -- GUST users
may not want all of fontsextra, while they do definitely want antt.  My
perltex stuff also seemed "logical" to me.  I can easily imagine that
other language collections would do the same thing.  I gave in on my
perltex stuff since it wasn't a big deal, but I didn't see anything
wrong (in principle) with the cross-dependencies in that case, either.

I don't have any brilliant ideas about how to solve the problem for
Debian(*), but it seems wrong to me to force TL to have this
restriction.  Unless Staszek is happy to just remove it from one or the
other to appease this ...

Best,
Karl

(*) Non-brilliant idea #1: make such common packages be their own Debian
package, so that both the others can depend on it.

Non-brilliant idea #2: arbitrarily choose debpkg (collection) X where
antt will really reside, then make debpkg Y depend on debpkg X.  Sure,
you get extra stuff along with it, but so what, disks are big.

Non-brilliant idea #3: duplicate such common packages in both debpkg's.

I agree with you. But, till now it didn't happen quite often.

Again, I agree with you. That't the reason why I asked. 

But: With a package management system, with any in fact, it cannot work
this way.

It *would* work if I could make from every Package tpm its own debian
package, and requires would map directly to depends. But alas, this
would gives something like 1000+ new packages, which for sure will never
be accepted.

So we decided for the collection -> debian package way, which I find
quite reasonable.

> (*) Non-brilliant idea #1: make such common packages be their own Debian

No. Or maybe. Or maybe not. I already have taken over the cm-super
package because it already exists in Debian. But I don't want to create
so many packages.

This is what I will do.

> Non-brilliant idea #3: duplicate such common packages in both debpkg's.

Impossible, because when installing dpkg wants to overwrite a file from
a different package, which is not allowed.


So if we come to the conclusion, that some Package tpms will be included
into several Collection tpms, then I will have to choose for each of it
where it actually will be in the debian package.

Best wishes

That's what I've just wanted to say. Thanks, Karl.
I cannot move antt (now rather huge) into fontsrecommended. On the other
hand, GUST members need antt, but they do not want all other mess.
I will do the same with new (beautifull, but also big) Iwona and Kurier
fonts. Norbert, sorry.

OTOH, you should understand that I have to decide where the fonts should
belong to *IN THE DEBIAN PACKAGE*.

For me there are two options now:
* Either I put it into fontsrecommened or fontsextra and langpolish 
  depends on the respective one

* or, if these font packs are big, I could leave them out of the 
  texlive-* packages at all and create their own debian package.

What do you suggest, and especially, which font packages are concerned?
I already have done this for cm-super.

Best wishes

Norbert

Personally, I'm with Norbert, I'd keep packages
in only one collection at a time. However, perhaps
a compromise would be add an extra attribute in
the TPM file, ie " optional='true'", which would act
as a clue to implementors that they should only
follow this link if they can easily do so.  So
one of the "antt" pointers would be flagged as a suggestion
only.

Good idea. When do we implement it?

(And btw, could you tell me wether this fix for Tpm.pm would include the
license information in the tpm files? There is already all the
infrastructure there in Tpm.pm. It gets the entry from the catalogue,
but it does not save it to the tpm file.

    Good idea. When do we implement it?

Not now, not by me anyway.  Sebastian, are you so sure other tools will
silently ignore a new attribute?  I am not certain.  I think TLPM reads
the tpm files.

    (And btw, could you tell me wether this fix for Tpm.pm would include the
    license information in the tpm files? 

Try it.

    There is already all the infrastructure there in Tpm.pm. It gets the
    entry from the catalogue, but it does not save it to the tpm file.

Please, as I said before, let's not make this change now.  I, perhaps
irrationally, fear this.  After our bad experience with descriptions, I
don't want to go adding a new attribute to the tpm files at this last
possible moment.  Nothing good can come of it.  After the release we can
screw up the tpm's all you want :).

Here is a diff that actually works. I had to add an entry to tpm.dtd and
I had to fix the path to the catalogue, the xml entries are not any
longer present in Master! 

It worked nicely

I suppose I am being purist here. If there is software which
reads TPM files, and it is not using a genuine XML parser,
I hope it burns in hell forever. If it is a proper XML application,
it seems inconceivable it will object to extra attributes.

But you are right, I suppose. Better if Norbert maintains his private
tree for a few weeks more before committing the change

I can't claim to be savvy about Windows -- I only use under protest, 
and it has been over a year since I used tex4ht, but I did try the new 
binaries.  They failed to find tex4ht.env:

Hello,

I read http://tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html page, but I have some
questions. I am a coauthor of LEd, LaTeXEditor (www.latexeditor.org),
which is uploaded to CTAN (to support directory). I would like to add
this freeware software to TL, but at the mentioned page I see the
instructions only for packages not additional software.

The editor is, I think, a bit popular since we have thousands of
downloads from our page. Some our users also ask us about adding LEd to TL.

Should I do something more than uploading LEd to CTAN?

Best Regards,

Sebastian

Hi Sebastian,

Thanks for writing.

    instructions only for packages not additional software.

Indeed, I didn't write recommendations for additional software yet
because it is much more complex than for pure TeX packages.

    questions. I am a coauthor of LEd, LaTeXEditor (www.latexeditor.org),

I see a couple issues.

On the legal side, you say it is "freeware", ok, that's good, but I do
not see the sources anywhere?  TeX Live's goal is to consist entirely of
"free software" by the FSF/Debian/OSI definitions.  (Giving no explicit
license results in confusion; I suggest releasing the program under the
GPL.)

You also mention that your dependencies have different licenses.  They
looked ok to me at a quick glance, but it would be desirable to confirm
this.  The Russian dictionary, allowing changes only through patches, is
annoyingly restrictive though perhaps still ok.

On the technical side, the biggest question is, how does it find TeX?
Does it just look in the directory where the led.exe is?  (That would be
ideal.)  Does it have any other support files that it needs to find, or
is everything contained in the executable?

In the CTAN directory for LEd, I see there is also a zip file with a
bunch of batch files for amstex, bibtex, etc.  What are they all about?
Are they required?  Where does it look for them?

That's what comes to mind at first glance ...

Thanks,
Karl

I cannot speak for TeXLive. However, it is on CTAN and then it
will be on the TeXCollection DVD.

Hi,
is there newer documentation for pdftex available than that in the
TeXLive repository?

The manual in the TL repository seems to be out-of-date and I'm sure
that Pawel already has something better.

For this documentation (or documentation in general), a smaller value
of \pdfminorversion would make more sense.  Not everyone has the
latest version of Acroread and some people avoid AR7 because it is so
slow.

  Reinhard

Hi,
there is a problem in texdoctk.dat in the TeXLive repository:

cjk;Typesetting Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK);latex/CJK/CJK.doc;

but there is only Master/texmf-dist/doc/latex/CJK/doc/CJK.txt.

So this line should better be 

cjk;Typesetting Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK);latex/CJK/doc/CJK.txt;

BTW., the search function should be case-insensitive so that people
can search for "amslatex" as well.  At the moment they have to search
for "AMSlatex".

And of course, as a maintainer of plnfss and vntex, I'm quite
interested in having the documentation in texdoctk.dat.

  Reinhard

Yeah, last year Thomas Esser kindly sent me a hint how to update 
texdoctk.dat, so we can check it in the last moment. That problem 
is not for Thomas Ruedas, I think.

Does it mean that texdoctk.dat for TL is maintained by TL people
rather than by Thomas Ruedas?  If yes, I can send you a patch
tomorrow.  texdoctk itself has not to be patched to find amslatex, it
is sufficient to add "amslatex" to the keyword column in texdoctk.dat.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

George,

Here's what I figured out about the remaining problems you discovered:

On Fri, 30 Sep 2005 09:14:25 -0300 (ADT), you wrote:

This turned out to be a three-way conflict between amsmath.sty,
overrightarrow.sty, and empheq.sty (actually, mathtools.sty, which now
is used by empheq.sty).  The solution is to move the
"\let\Rightarrowfill@=\relax" line from the AMS setup to the
overrightarrow setup in symbol.tex.

Now that empheq.sty loads mathtools.sty, there's a conflict between
mathtools.sty's definition of \downbracketfill and \upbracketfill and
those defined by symbols.tex to show how to make extensible brackets.
The solution is to rename symbol.tex's \downbracketfill and
\upbracketfill to something like \DAdownbracketfill and
\DAupbracketfill.

These are out of my control; the TeX Live crew needs to ensure that
the fonts needed by protosem.sty and yhmath.sty are installed
correctly for pdflatex, dvips, xdvi, etc.  Even a trivial document
like the following is problematic in TeX Live:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{protosem}
    \usepackage{yhmath}

    \begin{document}

    \textproto{abgd}

    \[ \wideparen{ABCabc} \]

    \end{document}


The next release of symbols.tex should be compatible with TeX Live.
Thanks again for bringing these problems with symbols.tex to my
attention.

Reason was that I've renamed all *.doc files to *.txt starting with
the last release; too many programs assume that .doc is a MS Word

Ok, I see links on http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/ to the -[las]

I don't see any updates for these files:

pdftex-w.tex

Also, I see sources in the zip file, but no output in the zip file, or

    TeX Live crew needs to ensure that
    the fonts needed by protosem.sty and yhmath.sty are installed
    correctly for pdflatex, dvips, xdvi, etc.

I am looking at yhmath first.  I don't understand it.  Where did
yrcmex10.tfm come from and what is it?  What should the map file entry
for it be, that is, what pfb should be downloaded and should any
transformations be done?  Scott, what are you using?  I don't see any
mention of yrcmex10 in the yhmath documentation, etc.  Maybe I'm not
looking in the right place.

Also, the only outline font I see in this area is TeX-yhcmex10.pfb in
TL, but ychmex.pfa is what is on CTAN:fonts/yhmath (with a later date).
Anyone know what the story is there?  

And finally, does anyone know the relationship between the
CTAN:fonts/yhmath and CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/yhmath?  The former has
a yhmath.sty, whether that's generated from yhmath.dtx in the latter I
don't know.  It seems bizarre to split the package over two different
directories, but maybe that's just the way it is.

After that mess, must have lunch before tackling protosem :).

Thanks,
karl

Yeah, as Karl stated, updating the pdftex documentation is not so 
straightforward... As I see, we have on p4 some (perhaps) obsolete 
files: pdftex-t.txt, moreover texmf/doc/pdftex/examples/ can be also
removed, as pdftex has something better (I believe) in manual/samplepdf/
(not yet on p4). Martin?

As I wrote.  Also 
 pdftex-i.tex
 pdftex-w.pdf
 pdftex-w.tex

    moreover texmf/doc/pdftex/examples/ can be also
    removed, as pdftex has something better (I believe) in manual/samplepdf/

Indeed, I wasn't sure if samplepdf/ was really supposed to replace examples/.

Overall, texmf/doc/pdftex in TL is a frustrating mix of files from a
variety of places.  Advice (or, ideally, a canonical location we can
just copy from) would be appreciated.

    the fonts needed by protosem.sty 

I added all the archaic package's map files to TL execution, which seems
to have taken care of proto10.

No. A simple "make" should get you the output (if you have a
recent enough ConTeXt & pdfTeX).

i looked at random email in ntg-pdftex mentioning recently added
primitives, and i see that e.g. \pdfforcepagebox is present in pdftex
1.30.3, but is not even mentioned in pdftex-s.pdf.

so i guess that pdftex-s.pdf is not "covering up to 1.30.x"

please do make sure that all primitives are described in the manual...

With a file called "v er.tex", pdflatex fails because it cannot find "v
er.tex". TeX itself does find it OK.

I do not have an older build available here, but I recall that it used to
be not a problem that there were whitespaces in the file name.

The problem appears in a build based on *very* recent sources (immediately
after Karl fixed the kpsearch.info problem.

This looks like a new bug to me.

They are; the pdftex-s.pdf you get is just too old. If you
generate it from the current sources (distributed e.g. on CTAN),
you will find its description on page 47.

Hi everybody,
a catch-all reply to the four mails I received earlier today:

I'll take a look at this - might make sense to have case-insensitive 
search.
Please note that my principal email address has changed (quite some time 
ago, actually).

Google found postings on MacOSX-TeX discussing the problem with 
yhmath and a recommendation to change a map file that doesn't look like 
the one in TeX Live:

I don't follow this reasoning -- LaTeX looks for yhcmex10, finds the .vf
file, and is told to look for yrcmex10.

Right, but that doesn't answer the question of where yrcmex10.tfm came
from in the first place.  I see no sources for it.

Anyway, thanks to Akira, I changed the map file and downloaded a newer

Ah, the essence of the problem.  I got that pdftex-s.pdf (and the
others) from the links on pdftex.org, blithely and incorrectly assuming
they were up to date.  So maybe you should update those links?

(Once again, having a canonical source for the doc, formatted versions
included, would make things so much simpler, for both users and
distributors.)

Anyway, I will rebuild the pdf's from the sources.  When I did that last
year, though, Hans decided we should rebuild it all in Optima at the
last minute ... Hans, do you plan to do that again this year :)?

    pdflatex fails because it cannot find "v er.tex". TeX itself does
    find it OK.

Indeed, I confirm that 
  pdfetex 'v er.tex'
works in TL 2004 and fails with the current TL pdfetex (both
i386-linux).  The error message is: 

! I can't find file `"v er.tex"'.

as if two " characters have been added.

Unfortunately, this seems bad enough that we must fix it and make new
binaries before the release.  Hopefully it won't be hard to fix.  Olaf,
Martin, Hartmut, anyone?  (Regrettably, I will be offline starting later
today for the rest of week, so can't follow up myself right now.)

I printed the two fonts with ghostscript's 'ps2pdf prfont.ps':

[gwhite@cerberus yhmath]$ pdffonts TeX-yhcmex10.pdf

The TeX-yhcmex10.pfb seems to have cmex10 in postions 0-127, and the 
yhmath glyphs in 128+, while yhcmex.pfa has just the yhmath glyphs in 
128+.  This suggests that the .vf should not be used with 
TeX-yhcmex10.pfb, so I renamed the file to:

   texmf-dist/fonts/vf/public/yhmath/yhcmex10.vf.bad

In principle, however, it seems better to use the real cmex10 rather
than some copy embedded in TeX-yhcmex10.pfb.

The .dtx file from macros/latex/contrib/yhmath on CTAN uses
\matrix so appears to be older than the .sty file in fonts/yhmath,


< \newenvironment{amatrix}{\left\langle\matrix}{\endmatrix\right\rangle}
---
> 
\newenvironment{amatrix}{\left\langle\begin{matrix}}{\end{matrix}\right\rangle}

Also, the .sty uses a different definition of \widering:

< \newcommand{\widering}[1]{\overset{\smash{\lower1.333ex\hbox{$%
< \displaystyle\ring{}$}}}{\wideparen{#1}}}
---
> \newcommand{\widering}[1]{\overset{\smash{\vbox to .2ex{%
> \hbox{$\mathring{}$}}}}{\wideparen{#1}}}

I made these two changes to the .dtx file and get the same .sty 
file.  Running pdflatex also gives something that looks
very close to the original documentation (the original \widering has
more space between the ring and the horizontal parenthesis).

On Windows, pdfetex "v er.tex" is OK.
Please check
char *makecfilename(strnumber s) in utils.c,
where I find #ifdef WIN32.

the windows version already supported "file name" (and some more things like url inclusion)

the question is: where does this tak eplace, in the kpse library of in pdftex; if i remember right, kpse now does handle it too, so maybe the two mechanisms interfere in the unix branch

If it helps, etex built on linux (FC4) using the current pdftex-1.30.3-2.2
sources  does not have the bug (pdfetex from the same sources and configure run
does).

I didn't have time to learn much with gdb, other than to confirm that access()
is called with the quoted form of the filename.

	In pdftex.ch:

@x 11447
@d append_to_name(#)==begin c:=#; if not (c="""") then begin incr(k);
  if k<=file_name_size then name_of_file[k]:=xchr[c];
  end end
@y
@d append_to_name(#)==begin c:=#; if not (c="""") or not is_quote_bad
  then begin incr(k);
  if k<=file_name_size then name_of_file[k]:=xchr[c];
  end end
@z

	In utils.c:

boolean isquotebad() {
#ifdef WIN32
    return true;
#else
    return false;
#endif
}


On non-WIN32 this means that append_to_name effectively becomes

   begin
      c:=#;
      if true then begin
         incr(k);
         if k<=file_name_size then name_of_file[k]:=xchr[c];
      end
   end

So the quotes aren't stripped from quoted filenames, and the file
becomes unfindable as a result.

I'll most likely do a new release (1.30.4) with this patch, but I
won't have time for this till Saturday.

If there are any other _bugs_ that need fixing, now is the time. :-)

I applied both patches on my FC4 linux system.  A quick test confirms the white

Subject: [tex-live] Licenses for TeX packages (tpm)
Message-ID: <20051012225328.GE3005@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

Probably it is not interesting for anybody around here, but I still
report a bit on my license games:

I have enhanced TPM.pm to include license information into the tpm
files, and furthermore started to include a mapping from tpm names to
entries in the catalogue.

Then I have regenerated the tpm files with license informations and
created a list of all tpm files (in fact only the ones in texmf-dist)
together with their license according to the current TeX Catalogue (cvs
version).
	Attached file: licenses.all

Furthermore I have created lists of packages (tpm file names) whose
license information is missing in the Catalogue and those whose license
information in the Catalogue is "unknown".
	Attached files: license.missing and license.unknown

>From the 1075 tpms in texmf-dist there are
	103 not present in the Catalogue
	197 with unknown license according to the Catalogue
Not too bad I would say.

So if someone has time and interest, s(he) can go through the list of
the missing entries in the Catalogue, I probably have missed some
package name mappings. And of course going through the unknown license
stuff and fix the information, sending it to the Catalogue (or me).

Ah yes, if you want to get my current working stuff of this, it is all
in the pkg-texlive svn repository on alioth:
        http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-texlive/texlive/trunk/LocalTPM

Again, please note that the information in the Catalogue need not be
correct.  Meanwhile, I found the mail I was referring to:

It would be ideal if the Catalogue people could create a list of
"pre-sarovar changes", so that we can verify this information.

I've seen that my CJK package has license `unknown' for reasons

The catalogue is regularly updated and others are welcome to join the
team maintaining the catalogue by creating an account on Sarovar. There
are bound to be errors in the catalogue. If you come across any, or have
comments, enhancements, and additions, please send them to me at
Graham.Williams@togaware.com.

I will try to get write permissions to the catalogue and start fixing
stuff there. In the meaintime I would like you to ask him to change the
entry. Thanks.

Hi all!

Using pictex I always get a broken system:
\! does not match its definition.

Finally I could track this down to this:
Current pictex in TeX live includes piccorr.sty

But piccorr.sty does the following (outline)

{
  \catcode`!=11

  define betweenarrows using lots of \!xloc etc

}
% END THIS GROUP

\def\!qjoin (#1,#2){% ...

I guess everyone understands what I want to say ...


Sample document:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pictexwd}
\begin{document}
$\!$

\end{document}

and latex-ing it I get ...
> \!=macro:
qjoin (#1,#2) (#3,#4)->\advance \!intervalno by 1 \!ifcoordmode \edef \!xmidpt{

As soon as the depot is running again we should fix this!

Hi,
here is a patch for texdoctk.dat.


-------------- next part --------------
A non-text attachment was scrubbed...
Name: texdoctk.dat.diff.gz
Type: application/octet-stream

-------------- next part --------------


Some files are in PDF rather than in DVI now.

There are some files mentioned in texdoctk.dat which do not exist.

I marked them by adding " ___" to the end of the line.  After applying
the patch, you can find them like this:

  grep '___$' texdoctk.dat


  grep '___$' texdoctk.dat | awk -F\; '{printf "%-15s %s\n",$1, $3}'
yields:

epslatex        english/epslatex-en/epslatex.ps
2up             latex/seminar/2up.dvi
custom-bib      latex/custom-bib/makebst.tex

overcite        latex/cite/overcite.sty
citesort        latex/ltxmisc/citesort.sty
symbols         english/symbols/symbols-letter.pdf

Some of the files are not in TL, but most of them exist as .dtx files
in the source directory and had not been extracted yet.  If someone
wants to create the missing files, it would be nice to produce PDF
rather than DVI and change the respective entries in texdoctk.dat.

Finally, if you want to remove all the lines which mention files which
are not part of TL, try 

  sed -e '/___$/d' texdoctk.dat > ...

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] fmtutil-sys, updmap-sys scripts
Message-ID: <434F6ED4.7000405@univ-lille1.fr>

Hi Thomas, hi all,

It seems that the new scripts fmtutil-sys and updmap-sys in TL2005
no longer take into account the TEXMFLOCAL branch of the TEXMF tree.

More precisely, I have modified versions of updmap.cfg and fmtutil.cnf 
in the TEXMFLOCAL tree of my servers.

My (local) texmf.cnf file says:
TEXMF 
=!!$TEXMFCONFIG,!!$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

I moved $TEXMFLOCAL before $TEXMFSYSCONFIG and $TEXMFSYSVAR,
precisely to be able to use my local versions of updmap.cfg and 
fmtutil.cnf (I don't like hacking into the standard trees ;-)

kpsewhich says:
# kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
that's fine, _but_ when I launch fmtutil-sys, it uses the standard
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
This is a consequence of your redinition of
TEXMFVAR and TEXMFCONFIG as TEXMFSYSVAR TEXMFSYSCONFIG, so TEXMFLOCAL is 
hidden!

As a quick and dirty patch, I can do this: add
l=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL`
TEXMFHOME="$l"
export TEXMFHOME
to fmtutil-sys and put $TEXMFHOME as the first entry of TEXMF
in my texmf.cnf...

The same is true for updmap-sys.

So, my questions are:

1) Could you think of a clean patch for fmtutil-sys and updmap-sys
    so that they pick up their config files where kpsewhich expects
    them to do so?

2) I always wondered why TEXMLOCAL was put behind TEXMF(SYS)VAR
    in TL standard texmf.cnf. Wouldn't it be more logical to search
    -- first the personnal tree of the user (TEXMFHOME and co),
    -- second the local trees of the machine (TEXMFLOCAL),
    -- then the standard TL trees?

Best wishes,

Why not simply unset TEXMFVAR, TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFHOME in the -sys
variants?

With TEXMFVAR and TEXMFCONFIG being part of "and co".  That's the whole
point of having TEXMFVAR plus TEXMFSYSVAR.

I fear this might not be possible:

TEXMF='{!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN}' \
  kpsewhich --format='web2c files' updmap.cfg

works, however.  But this is not easy to achieve, since I don't see any
means to extract the raw value of TEXMF with kpse-tools (--var-value
gives the directory names, not the variables).  

I see two possibilities:

- take the value from texmf.cnf via standard unix tools:

  TEXMFCNF=`kpsewhich texmf.cnf`
  TEXMF=`grep '^[[:space:]]*TEXMF[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*' $TEXMFCNF \
    | sed -e 's/[[:space:]]*TEXMF[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*//;s/[!]*$TEXMFCONFIG//;s/[!]*$TEXMFVAR//;s/[!]*$TEXMFHOME//;s/,,,//;s/,,//'`

- or simply define that the -sys variants are less configurable and
  hardcode {!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

Hi Daniel,

thanks for your question regarding TEXMLOCAL / search paths priorities.
I can explain why I have implemented things the way they are now. However,
I can't offer a solution to your problem other then moving your config
files into a different tree... See below. I hope that my explanations
help you (and possibly other people, too).

> It seems that the new scripts fmtutil-sys and updmap-sys in TL2005

Works as designed...

> More precisely, I have modified versions of updmap.cfg and fmtutil.cnf 
> in the TEXMFLOCAL tree of my servers.

Please, don't use the TEXMFLOCAL tree for this. Use the $TEXMFSYSCONFIG
tree instead.

> As a quick and dirty patch, I can do this: add

No, no. Such config files *should* not be put into TEXMFLOCAL.  Similarly,
you should not install pstricks into TEXMFSYSCONFIG or TEXMFCONFIG.

No.

The tools *write* new files into $TEXMFCONFIG / $TEXMFVAR, nowhere
else. If the search path would prefer TEXMLOCAL over the VAR / CONFIG
trees, it would be impossible to modify these files:
  - writing into *CONFIG tree: the new file would be shadowed by the
    copy in TEXMLOCAL and not found by kpsewhich / tex + friends
  - editing "in place": violates my rule to modify files outside of
    TEXMLOCAL

I think that one could implement something else, but that would have to
happen outside of teTeX.

Thanks Thomas for your explaination, I had missed the purpose of
TEXMFSYSCONFIG (new with tetex-3), sorry. I just need to say now
TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $TEXMFLOCAL
in my texmf.cnf, I can keep on putting all my local stuff into
TEXMFLOCAL. Defining TEXMFSYSCONFIG properly also solves my
second issue: there is no need to push TEXMFLOCAL forward in the
search order of TEXMF now, this fully statisfies my needs, thanks!

A few lines should perhaps be added in the documentation about
TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFCONFIG which are new to TL2005, Karl?

Subject: [tex-live] bug in pdfetex (re \immediate)?
Message-ID: <87wtke20up.fsf@vvv.vsu.ru>

Hi!

consider the following Plain TeX file:

\immediate\immediate\openout1=test.out
\immediate\write1 {line 1}
\immediate\write1 {line 2}
\immediate\closeout1

\bye

(it was reduced from a real-life example).

if i process it with vanilla TeX engine (i.e. not with pdfetex, but
with TeX), you get what i expect: two lines are written to the file
test.out, and there are no pages of output (no DVI file generated).

however, if i process this file with pdfetex, i do not get what i
would expect: instead, the lines are written to terminal, test.out is
created and is empty, and there is also a 1-page PDF file generated.

the bug goes away if i remove the second \immediate, but as i said
this is a simplified example converted from a real-life usage.

Best,
v.

Message-ID: <20051015164559.GA9921@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!
 
Close to a month has passed since the last version of TeX live for
Debian occured on the tug server. Here is a new incarnation!
 
Current Version: 2004.05.10.13-1

As usual, see 
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

Changes are mostly under the hood, nothing fancy. I tweaked the postrm
scripts to behave in a more standard way, ie not calling everything
twice (on remove and on purge), same with postinst.
I checked the fmt generation stuff to work even if someone only installs
texlive-pdfetex without -latex. Expanded the infrastructure to check
for double included tpm packages (and break out if there are). Included
some patches and links for man pages. Included some lintian override
files.

I have install-remove-install-purge tested some combinations of packages
(all are not possible), and will continue doing this.

Furthermore, I will start trying to install over a tetex3 and see what
happens. Also the other way round.

As usual, the log files of the creation process are in 
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
The file lintian.log shows that the errors/warnings are getting less.
The two errors now present are rubbish, lintian is stupid on this. I
have to file a bug report on this.

Other thing:
cm-super
	is in Debian/sid
texinfo
	is in Debian/sid

Concerning font packages: also this version includes the lm fonts, but
as soon as teTeX3 and the new lm fonts hit Debian, I will exclude the
tpm package and Depend on the Debian package (as it happens already with
cm-super). On similar line, I am in discussion with maintainers of other
TeX packages to get them compatible not only with teTeX3, but also
TeX live, allowing a better reuse of them.

Please give the packages a test if you are running sid.

Complete ChangeLog entry for this version:

version 2004.05.10.13-1 Thu, 13 Oct 2005 22:44:33 +0200

13.10.2005 NP
  * Include the list of all licenses of all packages into the package
  * Rebuild packages from current depot including perforce change #8432
  * move the format generation of etex and pdfetex from -basic to -pdfetex
  * Install lintian overrides for zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory,
    extra-license-file, and script-not-executable.
  * add support for dh_link and create links for some man pages

11.10.2005 NP
  * Make blacklists collection specific. 
  * Implement consistency checks:
    - packages which are included in two collections
    - packages which are not included at all (missing for bin-* packages)
  * Include antt and iwona only in texlive-fontsextra and not in 
    texlive-langpolish.

06.10.2005 NP
  * change cm-super from Suggest to Depend, as it is now in Debian/sid

04.10.2005 NP
  * remove last traces of texlive-trees and replace it by Master
  * Fix postrm scripts to take actions only on remove action, not
    on purge

29.09.2005 NP
  * Move to svn://svn.debian.org/pkg-texlive/texlive/trunk/
  * split tpm2deb from Master, include the Tools perl modules in orig.tar.gz

27.09.2005 NP
  * Add mktexlsr patch to generate ls-R via a /tmp file and cat into
    the original one. This way permissions can be set for the ls-R
files.
    Taken from tetex-bin.

26.09.2005 NP
  * Changed cmd test to which from test -e, so that no actual paths
    are used in the control scripts (Debian Policy)

The URW fonts are GPL. The metrics from psnfss are LPPL. In TeX Live
2004 there are also other metrics in here (like pplr.tfm). No idea where
they came from, what their license is and if they are still in TeX Live
2005. 

> charter	unknown

The fonts are DFSG free, the metrics from psnfss are LPPL.

> utopia	nosell

The non-free fonts are not in this package, the metrics from psnfss are
LPPL. 

The problem with all these packages is that they are build from several
sources on CTAN. The utopia package is probably a good example for this.
Most likely, the tpm contains /nothing/ from the utopia package on CTAN
that can be found in the catalogue.

This is indeed a bug, I have put my analysis and bug fix

Section 2.2. in the teTeX manual
(http://tug.org/teTeX/texmf/doc/tetex/TETEXDOC.pdf) gives a short overview
of the predefined texmf trees.

Maybe, something like this should be added to the TL docs. The
sources of the manual are available in the source tree of TL:
TeX/texk/tetex/doc/TETEXDOC.tex.

Sure.  Thomas' text is probably a good basis for it.

I think it would also be great to have an item in the "Present"
(changes) section telling people what, in practical terms, they should
do when they have the problem you did (you will not be the only one), in
addition to the "theoretical" description of the trees.

Any chance of you making a draft of either or both of those changes, and
I will edit/install?  I would greatly, greatly appreciate it.

(Meanwhile, I asked Rainer to restart the p4 server.  He's the only one
who can, AFAIK.)

Thanks,

I think the LaTeX packages should be unpacked to

- does this involve embedded documents (if so, the problem can be in using latin modern in the main doc and computer modern in embedded ones i.e. non optimal map files) 

- what is the compression level? set \pdfcompresslevel=9 for both tests 

- run \pdffonts and see if more fonts are used; maybe (when latin modern is used) less fake ones are used (reusing other fonts) 

- actually, the latest versions (an coming ones) of pdftex should be more efficient (less redundant cm's) 

- also, try to run with \pdfcompresslevel=0 and take a look at the files with an editor it may help to nail down the differences

Thanks to Rainer p4 is up, but I wait for patches from Martin (whitespaces
in file names) and perhaps for the last bug mentioned by Vladimir.
Then I'll remade all binaries for linux.

Dear maintainers,
I am wirting you in the name of maintainers of the Velthuis Devanagari
package. We would like to put the latest version to TL although it is not
yet on CTAN. We have an important update in documentation and some new
functionality, thus I fell that TL should contain the new version which is
now only on CVS. it is planned to prepare an instalation script which will
replace the package in an existing TeX installation and release it to CTAN
soon but it may be too late for TL. I can export it almost immediatelly
and package the same way as the previous version. There are just a few new
files so that modifying the TPM file is no problem. How should I post the
new version to you?

Sincerely,

Zdenek Wagner

So, are we ready for a rebuild of TL2005 for all platforms?

Have the changes been checked into source or source.development?

Let me suggest again that Karl announces a DATETIME for us to use  
with p4 to get the sources from source (not source.development where  
development can continue) for the build of TL.

note that you can use not only DATETIME but also revision number to
sync with depot (which has at least no ambiguity with time zones) - see
"p4 help revisions"; i.e. you can sync using

p4 sync //depot/Build/...@8841

(where 8841 is the revision number with Martin's changes to pdftex)

instead of p4 sync //depot/Build/...@yyyy/mm/dd

so if you ever need to sync to some release (e.g. TeX Live 2005 or TeX
Live 2004), remember use the revision number of that release and use it.

================================

in light of that, and seeing how it works in practice, i suggest to
drop completely the source.development tree to avoid unneeded
duplication.

existence of both source and source.development does not give ANY
advantages, in my view, but only creates confusion.

if/when p4 will be moved to another SCM system like CVS or SVN, we
will also have similar mechanisms to check-out sources at any given
point in the past (using either dates, or checkin number or branch
name etc).

Best,
v.

Without them people will not have much fun with Fourier, I suppose.

They are at CTAN/tex-archive/fonts/utopia.

    I just tried the Fourier fonts but the Utopia pfb files are missing.

They are not free.  Modifications are not allowed.

    Without them people will not have much fun with Fourier, I suppose.

Very true, but at least it saves people the nontrivial step of
installing Fourier.

Once again, I'd like to plead for a volunteer to write a script which
would download and install such nonlibre-but-gratis fonts so that users
can easily use such things.  It should not be that hard.  It could get
them direct from their locations on CTAN, or perhaps it would be better
to make a separate package that we could serve from tug.org, or
elsewhere on CTAN, or whatever.

I've just remade binaries for i386-linux (#8443) and can admit that
both bugs have gone (Martin, thanks). I used source.development/ for 
immediate testing (source/ tree is still too different).
Anyway, I found that even using the patch from Thomas (#8322),
which was applied in both trees (tcfmgr), I got exactly the same updmap
as before. Thomas?

Excellent.

    immediate testing (source/ tree is still too different).

They are 100% the same (now) as far as I can tell.  If they are "still
too different", maybe your checkout got confused in the usual p4
madness?  Try removing and then p4 sync -f or whatever?

TeX/texk/tetex/tcfmgr gets installed into $TEXMFMAIN/texconfig, i.e. the
script needs to be updated in Master/texmf/texconfig.

Ahh, I see. I thought that the problem was related only to updmap (as 
reported). Will submit the change.

Hi Zdenek,

Thanks for writing.

    We have an important update in documentation and some new
    functionality,

I hope the preprocessor hasn't changed.  Has it?  It would be a pain to
recompile at this point.
    
    it is planned to prepare an instalation script which will
    replace the package in an existing TeX installation

That sounds fraught with possibilities for problems.  May I suggest
simply packaging the release as a texmf tree, the way Reinhard has done
with vntex, etc.?  That makes it simple for users to install (they just
unpack in texmf-local), and also to see what goes where (since you
already put everything in the right place).

    I can export it almost immediatelly and package the same way as the
    previous version. 

Ok.  But why not upload it to CTAN as well, even if you do another
update soon?  It's not absolutely necessary, but it is better; for one
thing, that way Christian has a chance of getting it in miktex (if he
has devnag, I don't know).

    There are just a few new files so that modifying the TPM file is no
    problem. 

These days, the tpm is automatically generated.  I hope the new files
aren't in any new directories :).

    How should I post the new version to you?

Just give me a url ...


Thanks,
Karl

Fourier needs the original fonts.

Sorry Karl, I just compared the two web2c/pdftexdir/ directories...
I resynced both as you've suggested (still thinking that p4 is not
so mad; for me it is much more reliable and faster that any cvs, etc. ;-)
Anyway, I'm going to remove from the source/TeX/texk/pdftexdir/
pdf_mem.ch, pdf-syntax.txt and TODO to make things clean.
I think that depend.mak (0 bytes) is also obsolete.

And they are also included (using different names) with the ghostscript fonts.

Yes, I know that perfectly well, as has been discussed on many occasions.

    >From CTAN/tex-archive/fonts/utopia/readme.utopia:

Yes, the license text is contradictory, and no one seems to know who to
contact about it (more specifically than "Adobe").  At least I don't.

We haven't included the Utopia Type 1's in TL for several years (and we
have included Fourier).  I don't especially want to change the status
quo now.  Maybe next year.

Subject: [tex-live] Utopia fonts
Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1129590669.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

For those worrying about inclusion of the Utopia fonts in TeX Live:

Sun Solaris 7--10 have the Utopia fonts 
        UTBI____.pfa
        UTB_____.pfa
        UTI_____.pfa
        UTRG____.pfa
in /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/.

FreeBSD 5.0, NetBSD 1.6, OpenBSD 3.2, Apple Mac OS X, Sun Solaris 10,
and GNU/Linux (several distributions) have them in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1.

Hewlett-Packard HP-UX 10.20 and 11.23 have them in
/usr/lib/X11/fonts/type1.st/typefaces/.

I no longer have an IBM AIX system to make a check there.

SGI IRIX 6.5 has them with different names:

	/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/Utopia-BoldItalic.pfa
	/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/Utopia-Italic.pfa
	/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/Utopia-Bold.pfa
	/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/Utopia-Regular.pfa

Compaq/DEC OSF/1 4.0 and 5.1 have them in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/.

I conclude that pretty much all commercial and free versions of Unix
have the Utopia fonts [someone else on this list, please check IBM
AIX].

They are not, however, included in the ghostscript font distribution
at:

	ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/fonts/ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11.tar.gz

I would feel better if there was some statement somewhere, from anyone
(but ideally from Adobe), about the basis on which they concluded the
fonts are free.  As I said, the license is contradictory.

Many if not all "free" distributions actually include various nonfree
packages.  Merely being part of some random distribution doesn't allow
one to conclude it is free.  Debian is probably the best in this regard.

Frank, perhaps you have some insight here?

Contradictory to what?  To the statement in the afm/pfb files?

Thanh asked Adobe (he wanted to add glyphs) and they told him that
only the X consortium has to decide.  So there is a clear statement
from Adobe.

Unfortunately it seems that nobody of the X consortium feels
responsible.  No wonder, Adobe donated the fonts centuries ago and the
people who had been involved at this time are certainly not available
any more.

Can't we assume then that the fonts have the same license as the X
system?

At least the Adobe copyright notice is not the problem.

Here is an excerpt from Thanh's mail (tex-fonts@math.utah.edu):

    However I am not sure that I can modify them to add
    vietnamese support, because I am very ignorant of
    license/copyright issues 

    Concerning Adobe Utopia, I did my best to try to find out
    the answer, but without success: I asked people at Adobe
    first and got a response saying that they have granted the
    font license to X Consortium, so now only X Consortium can
    grant the permission to modify these fonts. I wrote to X.Org
    and got a response saying that  my question is being processed
    and then nothing (it was a few months ago). So I gave it up.

  Reinhard

I think that most Europeans are interested in Adobe Euro fonts.

Some of the code was stolen from

install-adobe-eurofont installs the fonts to $TEXMFHOME.  If there is
a symlink

  ln -s install-adobe-eurofont install-adobe-eurofont-sys

then install-adobe-eurofont-sys will install to $TEXMFLOCAL (which is

I am thinking of users who already have some version from TL in texmf-dist
and want to install a new version from CVS which has traditionally
different directory structure. Simple unpacking to texmf-local might
eventually cause problems, e.g. updmap will complain that there are two
files dvng.map. The installation script should replace the existing
installation in texmf-dist or, if it does not exist, put it to
texmf-local. The locations will be found by kpsewhich. Of course, for TL
I'll just prepare the package to be unpacked to texmf-dist.

The increase of size is due to the updated lmodern fonts.

It occurs only with lmodern fonts (recompiling the same files with 
fourier produces output files of comparable sizes with TL2004 and 
TL2005). Actually, the lm*.pfb files are bigger this year:
lmr10.pfb has grown from 77410 to 106666 bytes for instance.

Quality has to be paid in terms of file size, I guess...

in that case, compare with the cm super variant -) 

anyhow, since subsetting is used (unless disables) the difference should not be that huge

Not from personal knowledge.  I just checked, and the Utopia fonts are
in the package gsfonts-other in non-free.  I couldn't find any
discussions on debian-legal about that (I did only a quick search on
Gmane).  

I read the license info for Utopia given in this package, and it seems
to me that it does (implicitly) allow modification; but it does not
(explicitly) allow distribution of modified versions.  This is bad,
because in fact there have been licenses that do exactly that: allow
modification, but allow distribution only of unmodified versions.

One problem here is that the readme.utopia we have on CTAN is not
present in the CVS of both X.org and Xfree. Therefore the Debian
maintainer of xfonts-scalable-nonfree (which is already in non-free)
decided to not include the Utopia fonts at all. But see also:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=229713

It is quite odd that on the one hand Adobe says that all the rights are
with the X consortion, while on the other hand there is no license
information what so ever from X.org or Xfree.

Subject: [tex-live] Greek: missmatch of .fd-file and map
Message-ID: <4354C4BE.2040207@gmail.com>

This is a copy of a mail I just sent to Apostolos. I think he should 
solve the problem that arose from his renaming of the fontfiles, but 
maybe for TeXLive2005 it would be possible to make Greek run right out 
of the box without everyone fiddling in the files?

-------------------------\
Hello Apostolos,

I try to use the betababel package just to typeset some greek words in 
my thesis. This used to work fine, but after an update to TeXLive2005 
(beta 2005-10-05) I get error messages like the following:

! Font LGR/cmr/m/n/10.95=grmn1095 at 10.95pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) 
file no
t found.
<to be read again>
                  relax
l.501 ({\bcode{a)/gnoia}
                       ) oder sogar ">Unverstand, Torheit,

Finally I get /agnoia/ typeset in "nullfont" which isn't much more than 
nothing.

In the German usenet I've been told that the .fd-file doesn't match the 
.map-file. The fd points to grmn, but map only knows grmn1000. A 
solution I have not tested yet might be to change inside lgrcmr
\EC@family{LGR}{cmr}{m}{n} {grmn}     to
\DeclareFontShape{LGR}{cmr}{m}{n}{<-> grmn1000}{}


Maybe you can change the official package to ensure it runs out of the 
box again???

Thanks for providing the beautiful Greek typeface!

Sincerely, Georg
--------------------------/

Thanks in advance!

if your TeX can't generate grmn1095.tfm, it means that you don't have
METAFONT versions of CBgreek fonts installed. it has nothing to do
with the mismatch between FD and MAP files. Someone may still want to
use all design sizes of CBgreek fonts. if you need only 10pt fonts,
add the following line into your document (at the TOP of preamble):

 \usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}

Best,
v.

That's strange, since the Type1 files are included in gsfonts-other...

And some person (Han The Thanh) tried to get information from them,
because he wanted to distribute a modified version, and didn't get a
response for months.

Do you know which person we could contact among the X.org people?

P.S. The fonts are excluded from xfonts-scalable-nonfree due to "no
license statement", but included in gsfonts-other-nonfree because of the
license statement on CTAN, the origin of which is now unclear.

Just a minor detail. I /think/ the license statement on CTAN (see eg
http://www.dante.de/CTAN/fonts/utopia/readme.utopia) has its source in
GhostScript distributions, ie, gsfonts-other is probably the most
original we have right now.

I downloaded the testing ISO image in order to be sure that I put
everything to the correct directories. Unfortunatelly, its Content-Type on
the server is text/plain and therefore Mozilla in OS/2 converted all LF's
to CRLF's which made the image unusable. I am downloading it again by my
own program which gets everything as binary files but to be sure, I will
bring my Linux notebook tomorrow.

In this special case, it's about the Utopia fonts 

gsfonts-other-6.0/putbi.pfa gsfonts-other-6.0/putb.pfa
gsfonts-other-6.0/putri.pfa gsfonts-other-6.0/putr.pfa

Well, the problem was that someone probably already did that:

    Unfortunatelly it has changed. 

Yes, that is unfortunate.  Please just email me the new devnag.c right
away so I can get it in place for the TL binary builders, without
waiting for all the other files.

BTW, regarding the content-type for the iso's on the server, it's true
that the Apache defaults that we're using don't specify anything in
particular, but no one has reported a problem before.  Hmm.

    I can supply Windows executable.

That would be great, thanks.

    Simple unpacking to texmf-local might
    eventually cause problems,

Well, anything might cause problems.  The script which tries to replace
the package is just as likely to cause problems, seems to me.

Anyway, I applaud your effort to do it ...

    updmap will complain that there are two files dvng.map. 

I thought it should just take the one in texmf-local.

    it even isn't in teTeX.

Miktex is much much bigger than teTeX.

    I think that most Europeans are interested in Adobe Euro fonts.

Even stupid Americans might occasionally be interested :).

As you probably know, there are free Euro fonts too; the best package I
found was eurosym by Henrik Theiling, the fonts being named feym*.

Anyway, it's great that you wrote the script.  Looks nice and
straightforward.  My only immediate suggestion is to put a brief comment
at the top and/or write a simple --help message explaining what it does.
Perhaps then it could go on CTAN in the appropriate directory.

Oh, one trivial thing, "echo -e" isn't terribly portable AFAIK.  In this
case you can easily get the same result with plain echo:
echo; echo "Target: ${TYPE1DIR}"

    Are there other programs than wget and ncftp which can be used in a
    script? 

You meant to do the actual retrieval?  Plain ftp is probably more widely
available than ncftp, but is probably too much trouble to write the here
documents, etc.

Thanks,

when I started maintaining vntex, it already had been packaged as a
TDS compliant tree.  So it was quite obvious to import it into the SVN
repository accordingly.

I must say that I'm very happy about it because it makes everything
very easy.  All I have to do is to check out the files to some
directory and add this directory to $TEXMF (it has to be before
$TEXMFMAIN).

There had never been problems with updmap or the like.  I had been
testing with teTeX-3.0, TL-2004 and some snapshots from current TL.
There had been no need to change anything in the distributions or to
remove files from older versions of vntex.

The big advantage of having a TDS compliant structure in the
repository is that you can add the working copy to $TEXMF and
whenever you change a file you can test it immediately.

>From the experience I have made I think that it is quite reliable to
tell users who want to install a new version of vntex on a system
which already provides an old one to create a dir "texmf-vntex",
unpack the zip files there, make sure that the content of this
directory is found first, and updmap --{dis,en}able...

Of course, I thought about writing a script which removes old vntex
stuff, but it seems that it is not necessary.  And I cannot remove
files from a TeXLive CD anyway.

It is probably quite inconvenient to change the directory structure in
a CVS repository, but it is certainly worth the trouble.

  Reinhard

if you look into a Type1 font (using t1disasm) you'll see that the
space needed for hinting information is not negligible.

Good quality has its price...

No problem.  It seems that we need something similar for Utopia as
well.  Do you want to put the scripts into TL?

Sure. I'll change it.

Hartmut Henkel told me about a few other programs.  I hope that
everyone has at least one of them.

      http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes.html ? 

Just now updated to tex4ht-1.0.2005_10_13_2209.

    Eitan fixed the last (known) bug some days ago.

Five days without a release so far.  May be a record :).

    vntex.tpm claims that the version number of vntex is "3.0-TL" but
    actually it is "3.02".

I removed the incorrect version number.

Thanks,
Karl

    here is a patch for texdoctk.dat.

Thanks, I applied it.

    I marked them by adding " ___" to the end of the line.  

I guess it is actually "???".

   If someone wants to create the missing files, it would be nice to
   produce PDF rather than DVI and change the respective entries in
   texdoctk.dat.

Agreed, it would be nice, but that's a project (either pdf or dvi) I
can't undertake right now.  It should really happen as part of the
package updates.

epslatex is in flux.  Unfortunately Keith has not made a release.

symbols, I ended up removing symbols-letter since those files are
absolutely huge.  Maybe next year we can put it back.

The others, I dunno, have to be investigated individually.  If you or
anyone would like to volunteer to keep working on all this for next
year, that would be great.  (Perhaps texdoctk.dat could even be checked
automatically, both for incorrect and missing entries.)

Thanks,
Karl

More context, please.  Which fonts?

Fonts are a particularly hairy area of our licensing.  If the licence
information rests with 'the X consortium', then it may well still be
tied up deep in the corridors of TOG, or within the old X.Org group.
In any case, the current X.Org Foundation doesn't have it in any
official sense, but knowing which font is a good start.

Try xorg@lists.freedesktop.org; some of the people from the old XC
still hang around there.

Dear TL binary builders,

I know I've said it before, but it's still true: I hope the last change
to the sources has just been made.  I just checked in a new version of
devnag.c (change 8473, around Wed Oct 19 18:22:05 CEST 2005).  (Only a
small bug fix change, compiled fine for me.)

So, please rebuild as usual and let me know.

Thanks,

    Yes, but TL has texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/adobeuro/zpeur*.tfm ...

It probably shouldn't, but I'm not going to mess now.

    It seems that we need something similar for Utopia as well.  

Yes.  And the AFPL fonts listed on http://tug.org/fonts for which Walter
has created support.

    Do you want to put the scripts into TL?

Sure.

Once there is more than one, I suggest having one top-level script,
"getfonts" (or whatever name), which can then either get all the fonts,
or the ones specified, by calling the sub-scripts.  And then the whole
thing can be bundled its own package "getfonts" (or whatever), instead
of scattering the scripts throughout.

Thanks!

The Utopia fonts from Adobe:

    UTBI____.pfa
    UTB_____.pfa
    UTI_____.pfa
    UTRG____.pfa

Usually they are in in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1.

There are two questions (at least):

    1.  Under which conditions can they be distributed?

    2.  Is it permitted to modify them (adding support for Vietnamese
        in this case) if the filename, /FontName, and /UniqueID is
        changed in each font? 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Sebastian,

I have just checked the license in 0.4-beta9exp2 of pscyr package and it 
says:

  This collection may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions
  of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2 or any later
  version.

So, it seems to allow modifications (presumably this was not true 2.5 
years ago when you wrote the above). So, shouldn't pscyr be allowed back 
into TeX Live now?

More generally (and more importantly), imho, all these "license cleaning" 
things I see happening, should NOT be done for several reasons:

a) like with the above example, one day the license may seem unfriendly to 
you but in the next day [or year] the author may come back to his senses 
and realize that everyone should have every right to do ANYTHING he likes 
with his work as long as no freedoms are taken away (and if they are taken 
away then the original author should be compensated as much as he demands)

b) if people always respected "licenses" and obeyed the so-called 
"copyright laws" then no good things/products would have ever been created 
(but this is just my personal opinion --- some may be hypocritical enough 
to disagree and claim that they always obey the laws :)

the TL is a snapshot of the world in a certain state. who can predict

you propose that we simply ignore the law? or we choose which laws we
feel like obeying? or that we obey a law
only when it suits us?

"TeX Live"  (ie me, at the time) made the decision some years back to
follow the Debian Free Software Guidelines. The community
at that time went along with this decision by continuing to use and
distribute the collection; at any time, the community can say
that it does not like the principle, and either make TL change or start
a new project. My personal view is that the decision to use
the DSFG was good; now my opinion matters little, because I am
effectively retired from TL. Unfortunately, my successor, Karl,
is equally keen on the DSFG :-}   So if people want to go a state where
TL falls into that class of stuff generally known as "freeware"
(permission to distribute, all other rights vague or negotiable), they
had better start lobbying..... or be prepared to start a new
project.

The only copyright on these fonts is:
Copyright (c) 1989, 1991 Adobe Systems Incorporated.  All Rights Reserved.

So, I'd say the answer to both of your questions is 'no'.

Daniel, I suppose that you didn't follow the discussion from the
beginning, so here is the excerpt of a mail from Han The Thanh which
he posted to the tex-fonts mailing list:

    Concerning Adobe Utopia, I did my best to try to find out
    the answer, but without success: I asked people at Adobe
    first and got a response saying that they have granted the
    font license to X Consortium, so now only X Consortium can
    grant the permission to modify these fonts. I wrote to X.Org
    and got a response saying that  my question is being processed
    and then nothing (it was a few months ago). So I gave it up.

Regards,
  Reinhard

my statement is not so strong, it is more modest and humble (or I should 
say "more quiet" :) Namely, all I am saying, is that these "copyright" 
activities (though may be loudly claimed to be obeyed officially etc etc) 
should be given such low priority so as not to waste time of very talented 
hackers who contribute to TeX Live. It's just I saw those messages on 
this mailing list which gave me such impression, that is why I expressed 
my opinion and it so happened that yesterday a friend asked me for help 
installing pscyr on TeX Live and I was surprized that it wasn't 
already present and then I found your message of 2003.

Kind regards

hacking is interesting; but without the social and legal context,
not very useful to the bigger community.

Hmmm, I hope I misunderstood you somehow.
Because I can't imagine that I need to explain the meaning of the word 
"hacker" to Sebastian Rahtz, whose fame (as a hacker) covers the earth 
from one corner to the other corner thereof.

Hacker is someone who is extremely knowledgeable in computers and does 
useful things (fixes Linux kernel, improves TeX, designs new fonts for 
typesetting Bibles etc etc :)

So, yourself, Karl Berry, Linus Torvalds and many others are hackers. Not 
to be confused with "crackers" who are defined as people less 
knowledgeable in computers and whose technical abilities don't go much 
further than breaking into bank computers, stealing millions of pounds, 
causing nuclear wars by wreaking havoc in military computers with 
naive/stupid security systems etc etc.

Obviously hackers can do as much (and more) that crackers can, but we 
choose not to (not because we prefer to obey laws, but because we consider 
useful things to be much more interesting than evil things :)

That's basically the main difference between hackers and crackers. Sorry 
about this digression but I felt that you are making an assumption that I 
use the word "hacker" in some evil/criminal sense, which I certainly do 
NOT. I am a very law-abiding citizen myself :)

Kind regards

yes, I was not at all trying to imply anything bad about hackers. I took
it in the good sense which
you describe.

What I meant was that just  "doing good stuff" is not in itself enough.
If we do "good stuff"
on our own, and don't tell anyone, it's just onanism. So we all want to
tell others about it;
and its the interface with the real world where the trouble arises. If
the world
consisted entirely of hackers, in some hippy community outwith the law,
there would
be no problem. However, the plain old users tend to hang out in the
social and legal context
of western capitalism; and when we talk to them, we have to follow their
rules.

Sorry, I was not  trying to be controversial at all. I was just saying that
out work here cannot simply ignore the laws just because we're having
fun and doing good stuff.

Sorry, I cannot find pscyr on CTAN and we cannot search the whole world
for an update. Is pscyr prepared for distribution? If so, please
put in on CTAN. (It could take less time than discussing about

You did not get his point at all, not a single bit of it.  And because
you utterly did not get his point, you fantasized some completely
absurd point and then went on a lecturing tirade to dispell it again.

If hackers like Stallman had not wasted his time in, for example,
designing the GPL, or persuading MIT to release X11 under a free
license, or Linus Torvalds had not wasted his time changing the
license of Linux to GPL while this was still legally feasible, or the
university of Berkeley had not wasted its time getting the copyright
status of BSDlite cleared up and a number of other time wastes for
``"copyright" activities'', the combined work of ten thousands of
hackers would have ended up along with that of by far most software
from millions of programmers in the world: in closed drawers, in
unmaintained and forgotten toys, in the waste bin.

And yes, because maintainers of TeX Live worry about the copyright
status, I can copy and distribute and sell TeX Live reasonably free of
the fear that I will get a preliminary injunction delivered to my door
that will cause me significant costs and stop any business I might
have tried doing dead in its tracks.

Thank you, David, for a complete and accurate and clear explanation. Now I 
understand his (and your) point, thanks to your efforts; and agree with 
you, of course.

Hmm, I'm not more happy knowing that. We have ~1300 packages and we can
download it from CTAN which *is* (and should be) the definitive source.
What to do if you'll have beta10 tomorrow?...

I don't know (I don't use pscyr myself --- I am a happy user of 
Literaturnaya fonts which are present in TeX Live and I hope are not going 
anywhere...)

I cc'd the author of pscyr, so he can comment and/or decide when or 
whether his pscyr package should be on CTAN etc etc.

Well, it is not necessarily "of course".  I'd love to be able to avoid
dealing with such stuff, too.  For one story about what can happen if
you don't bother wasting your time with such details, take a look at

actually, that is a very good advice and very good timing too. Namely, 
what happened recently is that someone contacted me about purchasing a 
"license" to all my PDF Bibles (cf http://www.bibles.org.uk) for inclusion 
on the flash of their (still in development) ebook reader device as "built 
in" and offered a rather large sum of money for the right to print their 
name on the title pages. Well, most people just take my Bibles and 
distribute on the CD-ROM (or DVD if mp3 is also included) without asking 
any permission anyway, so I thought it was very nice of this person to 
offer money for what he could get for free anyway.

But as I read the above article I realize that I should be very very 
careful about the _contract_ that I will have to sign, to make sure I am 
not going to lose my unquestionable rights to continue development and 
free distribution of the Bibles and not being forced to remove any (or 
all) of them from free download from www.bibles.org.uk, not even 
temporarily.

So, thanks for that advice.

Kind regards
Tigran

I made last-minute changes in documentation and placed the package to
http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/devanagr/

I do not know where the binary files should be, therefore the same page
also contains the package with devnag.c and the Windows executable which I
have already sent you.

I have updated even the lists/devanagr file and devanagr.tpm to contain
the correct list of files

The package, as you sent me, did not contain dnmacs.tex for use with plain
TeX. In TL 2004 this file was present in texmf-dist/tex/plain/devanagr/. I
have created this directory and placed the file there. I have corrected
the typo in the author's name in the tpm file, updated the version number
and supplied the sizes calculated by du -cb

Maybe it is sufficient to find someone at X.org who is willing to care
about the legal stuff.  It is a great advantage that Thanh found
someone at Adobe who remembers.

There are some reasons why it's worth some effort:

 1. There are not many free fonts designed by people who know how to
    design fonts.

 2. Utopia is one of very few fonts which can be used to typeset
    mathematics.  Math support for Utopia is distributed with TeXLive,
    but unfortunately users have to download/install Utopia
    themselves, which is a bit inconvenient.

 3. There are only very few fonts which support Vietnamese.  Thanh
    wants to provide a derived font with Vietnamese glyphs.  This, and
    the fact that math support for Utopia already exists, makes this
    font very usable for Vietnamese.

 4. Utopia is distibuted with X11.  Quite interesting for tex4ht
    (LaTeX->HTML converter) users.

 5. Debian people are quite careful about licenses.  Hence, it would
    be good if the Utopia license issue can be resolved.  It would be
    a pity if Utopia will not be distributed with Linux due to some
    license problems while it is part of any other UNIX derivate.

  Reinhard

Karl will be away for 2 days, so I'll put the package on TL's depot in
a moment. Please submit it also to CTAN.

Already at the place. I compiled it for Linux yesterday.

Thanks, but that's not needed as we use the whole machinery for rebuilding

hi,

there is in directory /texlive/Master/texmf/pdftex

./pdfencodings
./pdfencodings/printenc
./pdfencodings/printenc.ps

these have nothing to do with pdftex, and the directory name
"pdfencodings" is somehow misleading (to me). This tool might be useful
with PostScript files. So maybe one should move the 2 files over to
texmf/dvips/printenc and remove the then empty
/texlive/Master/texmf/pdftex directory?

This is another good example of the need for sunset provisions to ensure 
that intellectual property doesn't become unavailable due to demise and/or 
lack of interest of the owner.

Lacking such provisions, the effort might be used better to extend the
virtual font mechanism to allow someone to create a new Type 1 font 
defining additional or replacement glyphs that will be used in combination
with some existing font.  This would be sufficiently useful outside the
TeX community that I think it stands a good chance of getting broad 
support.  One way to implement this would be to generate a temporary local
type 1 font, so the magic would all be hidden in mktfm without the need to
change pdfviewers, ghostscript, etc.

Hi Karl,

I heard you are away for a couple of days, so perhaps someone else can 
commit these binaries for testers to start using them:

Binaries built from source.development as of this afternoon.

Thanks. It was curious how and why it was put into texmf/pdftex
I'm happy to remove that.

Both files has nothing to do in texmf tree.

Because Karl's email said this:

So, I followed his instruction (the "as usual" part) accurately and did 
what I do usually, i.e. get the whole source.development and build it.

If the correct place to get the sources is from "source" instead, I can do 
that. Please confirm that you would like me to do this.

Kind regards

That's OK. At the moment we have both in sync. I think that the very last
rebuilt (if needed) will be from source/

We have a couple of people who deal with legal stuff (a lot of the time
it's me sitting there going, 'y'know, "all rights reserved" and nothing
else doesn't bear well for us distributing this'), but the problem in
this case is the multitude of organisations.

It may have been granted to:
  * the defunct MIT-based X Consortium,
  * directly to The Open Group,
  * X.Org as part of TOG,
  * X.Org Foundation.

All the XOF people swear that they haven't heard of it.  If it's
trapped in XC, then we're stuffed.  If it's deep within the annals of
TOG, then they don't know about it on a surface inspection, and it
would take absolutely ages to find out either way.  If it's within
TOG-X.Org, then no-one who was around during those days knows about it,
so it's likely been lost.

See the problem?

Perhaps the easiest way out is to tell Adobe about the situation and
ask them whether they'd consider relicensing those fonts _again_, this
time to TUG or Dante, so as to clear up any issues.

Since they don't actively market them as far as I know, doing so for
something which is presumed to be in the open, anyway, might be good
PR.

Are you using Norbert's Debian packages, or have you installed texlive
"the normal way"?  Does "apt-get install libxaw6" help?

I do it "the normal way". Of course installing libxaw6 solves the 
problem, thanks Frank!

I just wonder: is it unusual to have libXaw.so.7 instead of libXaw.so.6? 
Debian Sarge is not known to integrate latest libs, I fear RedHat and 
other Linux distributions might no longer have libXaw.so.6 either. Yet 
another point to mention in the documentation?

You should install the libxaw6 package.

Aren't the texlive binaries supposed to be linked statically?

Not for me -- using knoppix and NFS mounting the TeX Live tree.

For the record, Red Hat Fedora Core 2 provides both versions in x11-libs:

[gwhite@mar6030639 gwhite]$ ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so*

I digged into groups.google.com and found the original press release:

http://groups.google.de/group/comp.windows.x/browse_thread/thread/d351921a604a4039/a3e406813544b498

Mountain View, Calif. (October 9, 1991) - Adobe Systems Incorporated today
announced it has donated four typefaces from its Utopia(R) typeface family
in Adobe's Type 1 font format to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
X Consortium. 
[....]

Of course, it says nothing about the license agreement between Adobe and
the MIT X Consortium. There are several quotes from the README as found
in X11R5:

Which is more or less what we have on CTAN now. I think it would be good
if this were readded to the X.org CVS, so that the utopia fonts could be
included in xfonts-scalable-nonfree again.

Of course, asking Adobe to clarify the situation would be even better.

As I recall, the version of libpng matters.  A lot.  Which is why I'm
quite happy that tex-live links a matching version statically.  New
IRIX binaries should be up this saturday.

I've just remade xdvi-xaw.bin for Linux, now statically linked with
libXaw (change #8497). Daniel, thanks for reminding me that.

I should test this as I use a system libpng to link statically against. 
Any set of files I can download somewhere which might fail?

I don't have any test files beyond those in the libpng distributions
(I'm ignoring libz issues for now: let's figure out first whether the
bug is in libpng or libz).

Here is a simple test file that you can use on your system(s):

% cat pngver.c
/***********************************************************************
Report PNG header file and library version numbers and strings:

Usage:
	cc  -I/usr/local/include pngver.c -L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -lpng && ./a.out
	gcc -I/usr/local/include pngver.c -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,rpath=/usr/local/lib -lpng && ./a.out
	cc pngver.c -lpng && ./a.out

[21-Oct-2005]
***********************************************************************/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <png.h>

int
main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    (void)printf("png.h  version number = %lu.%lu.%lu\n",
		 (unsigned long)PNG_LIBPNG_VER_MAJOR,
		 (unsigned long)PNG_LIBPNG_VER_MINOR,
		 (unsigned long)PNG_LIBPNG_VER_RELEASE);
    (void)printf("png.h  version string = %s\n\n", PNG_HEADER_VERSION_STRING);
    (void)printf("libpng version number = %lu\n", png_access_version_number());
    (void)printf("libpng version string = %s\n", png_get_header_version(NULL));

    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

On one local system running Sun Solaris 10, I get this:

	% cc -I/usr/local/include pngver.c -L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -lpng && ./a.out
	png.h  version number = 1.2.8
	png.h  version string =  libpng version 1.2.8 - December 3, 2004 (header)

	libpng version number = 10208
	libpng version string =  libpng version 1.2.8 - December 3, 2004 (header)

Shared libraries are a nuisance, because the Unix linker fails to
record library locations in the executables unless the -R or
-Wl,-rpath options are given (and compilers do not agree about which
of those two is acceptable).

The same executable can give different answers, depending on which
library version is used at run time, which in turn depends on the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, and on GNU/Linux systems, the
contents of /etc/ld.so.conf (Sun Solaris has a similar mechanism, but
we refuse to use it): thus, it may work for one user, and fail for
another, on exactly the same set of input data.

Thanks.  The SGI machines aren't accessible from outside, so I won't be
using TeX on SGI until Monday.  

The local build of pdftex that fails was statically linked, using the
src/libs/libpng/libpnjg.a and corresponding zlib versions from the 
pdftex-1.30.4 sources.  ldd shows the same system libraries are used by both
versions.

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with TL2005 beta
Message-ID: <24848883.20051022003813@physik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi all,

I hope this bug report reaches the right persons.

I tried to install the TL2005 from the DVD-inst-ISO (after removing
my previous TL2003).
During the first try, the whole installation (full install) went
trough without obvious problems. Afterwards, I tried to tex a document
which worked perfectly well in TL2003. So far everything ok. The
problems came with windvi.
When opened from a console with "windvi document.tex" it did not even
open and gave an error message, that not all pixels could be
displayed. When starting just by "windvi" and subsequentially opening
a dvi-file, it only showed the lines within tables, everything else
was missing. I played around with the font files, also to include some
of the Futura fonts used in our university, but was not able to solve
this problem. Nevertheless, the dvi-file in the windvi documentation
could be displayed.
Afterwards I deinstalled TL2005 to try again in a fresh installation.
The problem now is, that I cannot get it installed again, as the
installer stops due to some error in file or directory
creation/copying. Even after manually cleaning registry, all
remaining texlive directories and environment variables it did not
work.
As a test, I reinstalled TL 2003 and everything works as expected.
I forgot to mention my system configuration: P4 1.6Ghz, RAM: 1.6 Ghz,
and  Windows XP Pro SP2.

Finally, a comment on the installer. It would be nice to have a button
in the panel for the choice of an alternate installation directory, that
allows to create a new subdirectory. Otherwise one allways has to use
another program to create a texlive directory, i.e. under "program
files".

Bye
  Gregor

PS: Why is there now the additional texmf-dist directory (compared to
TL2003)?

Every PNG file I tried (mostly big indexed color remote sensing images) 
produced a core dump, so there something fundamentally broken with my libpng.a
(from pdftex-1.30.4/src/libs/libpng).  It may be that a system libpng (or zlib)
compiled with different options will work.  I got a core dump from
pdftex-1.30.4/src/libs/libpng/pdftest (you will have build it manually) 
which uses pdftex-1.30.4/src/libs/libpng/pngtest.png.

On our SGI machines pdftex has to work reliably with the png files created by
RSInc's IDL language.   If you have IDL there are lots of example files in
/usr/local/rsi/idl/examples/data.

Adobe says that it had been granted to the X Consortium.

Did you ask on a mailing list?  That's what I would do, but if you did

Yes.  Can TOG be regarded as the legal successor of the X Consortium?

What I mean is this (at least according to German law):

If you lease an apartment and the house is sold to someone else, the
old leasing contract is still valid.  So the new owner of the house
cannot ask for more money only because he is the new owner. 

As I said, I don't know much about the legal stuff.

As a last resort, maybe Thanh can ask Adobe with whom of the X
Consortium they negotiated, maybe he can help.

Thanh already asked whether he is allowed to distribute modified
versions of the fonts and they told him that only the X Consortium can
decide.  That means that they did not only grant the right to
distribute the fonts to the X Consortium, but they donated the fonts
with all rights to them and abandon their own rights.

When Sebastian presented pdftex at Adobe, they had been amazed that
pdftex can do things they cannot do with their own tools (I suppose
that Hans Hagen provided some files).  This was years ago, but
meanwhile Thanh provided many microtypographical extensions.

If things evolve in the future as they did in the past, I suppose that
pdftex is not good PR for Adobe, it's more likely that they regard
pdftex as a competitor.

  Reinhard

One does not need to mention PDFTeX in that context.  But remind me:
just what Adobe tool is replaced or endangered by PDFTeX?  Do they
have a general purpose typesetting program?

In the past, Adobe has fixed Reader bugs that were triggered by files 
created with TeX (encodings using ASCII NUL, although TeX responded to the bugs
with new encodings).  Enlightened software vendors understand very well that the
user community's investment in workflows forms the basis for long-term success. 
I suspect Adobe is happy to have the TeX community providing the tools to deal
with mathematical typesetting, as the commercial market is probably too small
in relation to the cost of developing/maintaining the tools.  

In my view, current intellectual property law misses the importance of the 
user community.  This creates a danger that users can loose their investment
in workflows through the demise of a vendor or outrageous price increases. 
While I don't think Adobe has immediate plans to cash out on PDF, history shows
that successful companies can fail (e.g., by ill-advised moves into areas where
they have no competence), leaving intellectual property in limbo, or be taken
over by groups who will grab the cash and run.

While there is currently little danger of Adobe doing anything to hurt pdftex
(and if pdftex was harmed as an unanticipated consequence of some other 
action, Adobe would probably work to resolve the problem), there is no
protection for pdftex from some unrelated business catastrophe.  In such an
event, pdftex users would be better off than users who rely entirely
on Adobe tools.

Do people use typesetting programs for typesetting today?

Right.  As I said earlier, it's probably tied up somewhere deep within
TOG: no-one still involved with X today remembers this at all.  So,
unless you really, really, really, really, really, really need these
fonts, it's not going to be worth the effort.

Can we not ask the original author to regrant us the rights ? Or clarify the

So you would say that TOG is the one who now has the right to the fonts ?

Current acrobat reader (well, it was at least a couple of years ago) licencing
forbids it to be distributed alongside other pdf generating tools like pdftex,
which is in big part why it was removed from non-free back then.

I suppose that people are still using them.  It doesn't hurt if they
are still available.

The script now supports eurofont, garamond, lettergothic and utopia.

There will certainly be not so many fonts that it is worth to have
more than one script.  Actually tere are two, getfont and getfont-sys
(the latter should be a symlink).

The current version can be downloaded for testing from

     http://ms25.ath.cx/getfont.gz

but if you only want to browse the code, it might be more convenient
to look at

     http://ms25.ath.cx/getfont.html

It would be nice if I could use vanilla ftp with a here-document piped
into it, but it didn't work.  Don't know why.

Thus I check for lftp, ncftpget, wget, curl, and snarf and use the
first one I find in $PATH.  If someone knows other ftp clients, let me
know.  I will support them as well then.

Comments are welcome.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It seems to be in teTeX, so perhaps Thomas E. has some knowledge.  Thomas?

At least distribution is not forbidden.  I think that if the author
doesn't wants to allow people to change the file, this is something
we can live with. (Maybe Richard Stallman sees things different).

No, the current criteria for TL is FSF/DFSG-free.  Modifications must be

The majority of commercial 3rd party pdf generating tools target Adobe's 
key markets.  Allowing them to include Acrobat Reader could be interpreted 
as some sort of Adobe endorsement as well as giving them an excuse for 
sprinkling Adobe logos around in their literature.  There is a huge 
difference between a product that enables pdf for a class of users that 
would be difficult for Adobe to properly support themselves and products 
that aim to carve out small chunks of Adobe's key markets.

That would be redundant.  Redistribution is already prohibited by
copyright law.  You need an explicit _permission_ overriding the
copyright law default in order to redistribute.

Hi Gregor,

Thanks for reporting the Windows problems.  I hope Pawel, Staszek, and
others can get them fixed.  The one thing I can answer is your last query:

    PS: Why is there now the additional texmf-dist directory (compared
    to TL2003)?

This was done in 2004.  The idea is that, in principle, texmf-dist could
be the same even among different implementations, for example, miktex
and xemtex and tex live could all share the same texmf-dist (and
texmf-doc).  While texmf/ contains the actual programs and their
configuration files.  Whether the distinction is actually worthwhile is
debatable, but that's the main reason.  (This is also briefly discussed
in the documentation.)

Best,
Karl

Unfortunately, I don't have any additional information. Since I am short
of time at the moment, may I ask that someone else tries to contact the
author? Meanwhile, I have removed the package, but I'll put it back if
we get a free software license for it.

One can try. The last thing I have found about Joachim Bleser is that he
left the 'Hochschulrechenzentrum' of 'Technische Hochschule Darmstadt'
at the end of 1996:

http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/hrz/durchblick/db96-2/personal.html

I haven't found much about Edmund Lang. However, Joachim Schrod (CCed)
is one of the authors of extpic.sty which is in the same directory on
CTAN. Maybe he knows something about their whereabouts.

Sure, when they aren't using MS Word.  From my personal sample, PageMaker is
still the favorite, but the sample is biased towards people whose business is
producing "coffee-table" books with a high ratio of color art and the bare
minimum of text.  

My cousin still sets metal type by hand (in addition to wedding invitations, a
big part of his business is fixing mistakes made by big printers in things like
corporate annual reports).

That will be very hard. Edmund and Joachim both worked at the
Computing Center (HRZ) of the Technical University of Darmstadt (TUD).

Edmund Lang died of cancer many years ago. He was a friend of mine,
and his sudden illness and soon-after death was hard on all who knew
him. He left a wife and three children, whom I haven't been in contact
with since more than 10 years.

Joachim Bleser is the principal author of picins.sty. He first worked
as a TA for Edmund and took over his job when he had finished his
studies and Edmund got ill. I don't know how to contact him.

Maybe Norbert Hahn (hahn@hrz.tu-darmstadt.de) knows somebody who still
has contact with Joachim -- Norbert was at the TUD at this time
already and is still there. AFAIK he does now the job that Edmund and
Joachim did before.

If he doesn't know how to contact Joachim, maybe Heinrich Honal
(honal@hrz.tu-darmstadt.de) or Walter Reichenb?cher
(reichenbaecher@hrz.tu-darmstadt.de) can help -- they have been even
longer at the HRZ. (Walter Reichenb?cher is vice-director of the HRZ,
so maybe he knows how to contact previous staff.)

Cheers,
	Joachim

    Debian Sarge is not known to integrate latest libs, I fear RedHat and 
    other Linux distributions might no longer have libXaw.so.6 either. Yet 

I can say that Red Hat WS 4 and ES 4 have libXaw.so.6.

Anyway, I'm glad Staszek statically linked the binary now.  We should
eventually set the Build script up to do that by default, where
possible.

Maybe we can have a script "getfonts" in TL which downloads and
executes "getfont" from CTAN.  This way "getfont" can be extended
while "getfonts" is burnt on a CD. Internet access is required anyway.

The current version can be downloaded for testing from 

    http://ms25.ath.cx/getfont.gz

or for browsing from

    http://ms25.ath.cx/getfont.html

Supported fonts are now:

    eurofont:      Euro symbols (Adobe).
    dayroman:      DayRoman (Apostrophiclabs)
    garamond:      GaramondNo8 (URW).
    lettergothic:  LetterGothic (URW).
    luximono:      LuxiMono (Bigelow & Holmes)
    utopia:        Utopia (Adobe).

Ralf Stubner suggested to support DayRoman and LuxiMono and to provide
all files needed instead of only the pfb files.  I now download
Walter's stuff as well, but I'm not sure whether eurofont is complete.

I changed a few things as proposed by George White and Thomas Esser.

Since I'm not able to use vanilla ftp ("ftp ftp.dante.de < responses")
I search for other ftp clients in $PATH.

At the moment these are lftp, ncftpget, wget, curl, snarf, and gftp.

lftp, curl and snarf had been reported by Hartmut Henkel, but
certainly there are more.

Cheers,
  Reinhard

You must have forgotten the presentations from Hans. :-)

An OpenType-grokking pdfTeX with ConTeXt will be a competitor for
InDesign. Who really needs a GUI? :-)

InDesign.

How would they do it? PDF/X and PDF/A are ISO standards.

They could create a hypothetic PDF 2.0 which would be
incompatible with PDF 1 and try to gain more marketshare. But I
doubt that the market would like that...

What's about putting "wget" as binary to the TeXLive bin directory?

I don't know what sttools is, but it is certainly too late to add any

today (10/31).

This is not necessarily the case.

The X Consortium transferred rights for the X Window System --
trademarks, copyrights on the code, et al -- to TOG as part of the
X.Org process, and then promptly disbanded.  The font grant may not
have been included in that.  Depending on the language, it may not
even be transferrable, so we may be stuck with the original
no-modification grant, given that the entity holding the rights to it
underwent a sudden total existence failure.

And no, no-one can find the paperwork.

I'd suggest the best bet would be getting Adobe to re-grant those rights
to the X.Org Foundation.

I have now two scripts, getfont and getnonfreefonts.

getnonfreefonts is supposed to go into TeXLive and getfont will be at
CTAN.

Whenever you invoke getnonfreefonts, getfont will be downloaded from
CTAN and installed in a temporary directory.

There are two ways to invoke getnonfreefonts:
  If the --all option is set, all currently supported fonts are
  installed, otherwise an interactive shell is started where you can 
  run getfont directly.

getnonfreefonts passes all arguments to getfont, but they can
overwritten if desired.

The source code can be browsed at:

   http://ms25.ath.cx/getnonfreefonts.html

   http://ms25.ath.cx/getfont.html

Download  

   http://ms25.ath.cx/getnonfreefonts.gz

and play with it.

getfont is at http://vntex.org at the momentn because I do not have
access to an FTP server. I assume that you have wget installed.

All you need for testing is 

   http://ms25.ath.cx/getnonfreefonts.gz

Regards,
  Reinhard

Just for interest: what version of AUCTeX (and probably also
preview-latex and the corresponding preview.sty, as of the latest
AUCTeX-11.81) is used in the packaged Emacsen and in the TeX trees?

AFAIK there is no packaged Emacsen in TeX Live.

The LaTeX preview package as of 25 September 2005, checksum 1638, file size
76673, (I'm missing the actual version number for some reason), is
included.

Hi,

the TeX Live pdftex.1 and pdfetex.1 man pages both tell:

"The most recent version of pdf(e)TeX is available for anonymous ftp at
the http://www.pdftex.de/tex/pdftex/ pdfTeX development side."

...which is Martin's homepage (TeX merchandising), and there is no such

Hi,

mptopdf -raw does not work reliably with TeX Live 20051025, some problem
with the shipped mpost binary?

If i type e. g. "mptopdf -raw mandala.mp", in fact the system call by
mptopdf.pl is "mpost --mem=metafun mandala.mp" and this gives here
(Linux sarge i686):

:~/languages/metapost/mandala$ mpost --mem=metafun
mandala.mp
This is MetaPost, Version 0.901 (Web2C 7.5.5)
(mandala.mpSpeicherzugriffsfehler

It's a segfault. The test file is at:
http://www.circuitwizard.de/misc/mandala.mp

The md5sum of this mpost ist ca5e1b37e429f3...

Unclear is also, why the metafun format is used for a -raw job?

And even with the above metafun format call, another 0.901 metapost,
self compiled, within teTeX environment runs ok here:

:~/languages/metapost/mandala$ mpost --mem=metafun mandala.mp
This is MetaPost, Version 0.901 (Web2C 7.5.3)
(mandala.mp [1]
metafun 2005-10-18 0:37

1 output file written: mandala.1

No idea what's wrong. A compiler problem?

Ok, I see.  I thought there was at some time the XEmacs from Fabrice,
but I might be mistaken, or it might have been only part of the
add-ons on the DVD from Dante.

IIRC, there could have been some goof in connection with the version
number in that release.  So it might well be that there is no useful
version number.

Well, that's a bit of a relief.  Thanks.

Yes, I have many UNIX tools like bash, sed, grep, ls... at work for
years (under Windows) and they all came from an ancient TeXLive.

About two years ago a colleague installed XemTeX from a TL-CD.

I tried recompiling it on tug.org, using a different version of gcc,
without optimization.  It still crashed.

Gdb shows that it happens in dospecial, at mp2.c, line 1911.
The line is this:
 mem [lastpending ].hhfield .v.RH = stashcurexp () ;

lastpending is 2499996, which is apparently garbage -- "cannot access
memory at address".

Taco, help??!!!

Well, I presume the original source for the man pages is pdftex CVS, so
they should be fixed there.  (I also suggest making pdfetex.org really a
different page, with only the "e" description, and just saying see
pdftex(1) for the rest; right now the files are nearly identical.  Also,
it's not true that the complete documentation is in web2c.texi; some is
there, but the pdftex manual is a better source.)

Anyway, for now I changed the copies in TL to refer to pdftex.org.
However, the "side" typo did not appear in the files I looked at.  I
don't understand ...

(In general, I'm sure nearly all of the man pages are woefully out of
date and/or inadequate; fixing that would be a whole project in itself ...)

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Hartmut,

> mptopdf -raw does not work reliably with TeX Live 20051025, some problem
> with the shipped mpost binary?

No, just the usual array sizes madness.

fmtutil has a few special cases, so that array sites for context and
mpost are correctly passed down:

  case "$format" in
    metafun) prgswitch=-progname=mpost;;
    mptopdf|cont-??) prgswitch=-progname=context;;
    *)       prgswitch=-progname=$format;;
  esac

This means that we don't need zillions of array size definitions for
metafun, mptopdf and cont-xy. On the other hand, some discipline about
program invocation is needed.

If texexec calls cont-en, it passes -progname=context, else the wrong
array sizes would be used. Similarly, one has to pass
  -progname=mpost
when using the metafun format:

    $ mpost -mem=metafun -progname=mpost mandala.mp
    This is MetaPost, Version 0.901 (Web2C 7.5.5)
    (mandala.mp [1]
    metafun 2005-10-26 5:50
     )
    1 output file written: mandala.1
    Transcript written on mandala.log.

This does not happen here when calling mptopdf and this seems to be a
bug in texexec.

I'll have a look at the change file, but while I can probably
make the required fix, I will definately  be too late for this
tex-live,  so I am not going to rush into it. If someone else
wants to have a go: the problem is that the changes use some
of the configurable array size values from the run-time
configuration instead of from the mem file and/or there are
not enough sanity checks while reading mem files.

Cheers, Taco

if it's related to specials ... change the mem settings in the cnf file

texexec is not involved here, but your analysis made me look into 
mptopdf.pl:

i found that i'd swapped the -mem flags in the following snippet:

        if ($MetaFun) {
            $mpbin = 'mpost --mem=metafun' ;
        } else {
            $mpbin = 'mpost --mem=mpost' ;
        }

there is no reason to use progname here since the mem matches it and 
using a progname would complicate things

(hartmut: you can also use texexec to convert mp to pdf: "texexec 
--mptex test.mp")

I'm seeing erratic behaviour from windvi in WinXP Pro SP2.  It seems to
work with CM fonts, but yesterday it hung on mktexpk with high CPU use
when texdoctk found opic-rel.dvi.  It works this AM (after a reboot late
yesterday!).

Dear Hans,

>            $mpbin = 'mpost --mem=metafun' ;

Sorry, that can't work.

metafun.mem is created with -progname=mpost, so it will use the array
sizes of mpost.  "mpost --mem=metafun" (which reads metafun.mem) uses
the array sizes of metafun. You have to use
  mpost --mem=metafun --progname=mpost

Demo:

    $ mpost --mem=metafun -progname=mpost mandala.mp
    This is MetaPost, Version 0.901 (Web2C 7.5.5)
    (mandala.mp [1]
    metafun 2005-10-26 18:24
     )
    1 output file written: mandala.1
    Transcript written on mandala.log.

    $ mpost --mem=metafun  mandala.mp
    This is MetaPost, Version 0.901 (Web2C 7.5.5)
    (mandala.mpSegmentation fault

While we are at this: the lines

  main_memory.metafun     = 2500000
  pool_size.metafun       = 1000000

in texmf.cnf contradict the implementation of fmtutil (which makes sure,
that the array sizes of mpost are used for metafun.mem creation and not
the ones of metafun).

It would be a similar nonsense to have a
  main_memory.cont-en
setting which makes no sense (texexec and fmtutil both pass
-progname=context when using cont-en).

>            $mpbin = 'mpost --mem=mpost' ;

That, you can change into
  $mpbin = 'mpost' ;

OK, based on this, Adobe still holds the copyrights.  It hasn't granted
explicit modification permission -- but appears to have intended to, given
the word 'unmodfied' in the trademark clause.

Perhaps we could simply ask Adobe's legal department for a clarification
that this license means that we can make and redistribute modified
versions.  I think we should be able to get these fonts in Debian proper.

    They are also in the src area in TeX/texk/web2c/man.

I see there is pdftexman.m4 as well as the .man's.  Not sure what that
is all about, so I think I'll let Martin and crew integrate the changes
as they see fit instead of investigating.  Lots of other updates would
be useful too, as I mentioned.

ok, i now have

       if ($MetaFun) {
            $mpbin = 'mpost --progname=mpost --mem=metafun' ;
        } else {
            $mpbin = 'mpost --mem=mpost' ;
        }
 
i'm still puzzled why it fails with hartmut because he doen't use the 
--metafun switch, does he?

concerning the main_memory settings, i use those here -)

(at least these values indicate what users should set them to for heavy 
metaposting); next tex live i'll switch to the ruby variant of texexec 
(with integrated texutil) which while probably use the metafun mem values

thanks for looking into it

This solution will work fine for any people that use
Hans' texexec to generate the formats instead of fmtutil,
since texexec --make doesn't use the --progname=mpost
switch.

Using texexec is the normal|advised way to run mpost with
metafun.mem preloaded, sop this solution will work just
fine in practise. The only bug on Hans' side  is that he
swapped the if/else branch so that the wrong case was
selected.

Why do you feel that metafun should use the mpost settings
instead of its own, btw? To me that sounds like you have
fmtutil set up backwards.

    but texexec generates mems and calls metafun with the same --progname=mpost 
    directive,

    Hans

I have not heard anything else until then, so I have assumed that
--progname=mpost is what "context" does. If you are right, this has been
changed without telling me (so I could not adjust fmtutil).

So, gentlemen, just tell me what you want, I can easily follow this
in fmtutil. The only important thing is that *all* ways to generate
formats use the same array sites (fmtutil should not be different from
texexec in that respect) and that all *uses* of a format use these array
settings, too.

So, should the metafun format use -progname=mpost?
If yes,
  * change context so that the format is generated with -progname=mpost
  * remove the metafun settings from texmf.cnf
If no,
  * remove -progname=mpost from context
  * I'll change fmtutil

All I am for, is that things match and that they are compatible. Changes
(e.g. dropping an esstial thing such as passing -progname=mpost) should
be communicated to everyone involved.

Maybe, I am not involved?

Hi Lars,

(Please excuse the delayed reply.)

    the latest version seems to be missing dvipdfmx.def

True enough.  Never had it (or dvipdfmx) in the past, either.

    I don't know whether this is intentional or not. Just wanted to let you 
    know.

It's not exactly intentional, it just never occurred to me.  It seems it
should really be included in the graphics bundle?  I'm somewhat
reluctant to just throw in this extra file from the dvipdfmx cvs
repository (it's not even in their distribution, as far as I can see),
although it does seem like clearly a good thing to have.

Staszek, anyone else, what do you think?

Well without it not color or graphics (?) will work with dvipdfmx

AFAIR I got the file from the URL above. It seems to be working fine.
It seems weird that they haven't submitted it to CTAN yet.

Hi,
is it possible to make documentation for pdftex and hyperref
accessible to texdoc(1)?

While the pdftex manual can be accessed if people know that it is
called "pdftex-a" (it sounds like a joke if people say "Read the
documentation" on a mailing list), the hyperref manual is inaccessible.

On my system I get:

$ locate manual.pdf | wc -l
    164

Is it possible to solve it before TL is released?

I would expect that "texdoc <packagename>" or "texdoc <progname>"
provides something useful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yeah.  I don't know what can be done about the plethora of manual.pdf's
except encourage authors to use a better name.

    Is it possible to solve it before TL is released?

Well, if you can make a patch for the texdoc .dat file,
I can install it :).

(Personally I am not sure that so many people use texdoc that it is
worth a superhuman effort, but there's certainly no harm in making it as
good as we can.)

I fear that, unlike texdoctk, texdoc simply uses ls-R as a database.  

Thomas recently mentioned that one can define aliases, but I think
that it is best if the authors provide fixes.

Or, if you don't know that by heart, 

texdoc -s hyperref
texdoc hyperref/manual

Heiko Oberdiek (hyperref's maintainer) argued that there is not one
piece of documentation for hyperref, and therefore there's no good
solution as to what "texdoc hyperref" should show.  The other documents
are not only developers' information, there's also some interesting user
docs in there (especially but not only in README), and a real solution
would require to rewrite the manual (which is outdated, anyway).  I'm
sure he welcomes offers for help; I myself have done that once and have
the sources for the docs on my system, but in fact I never found time.

HI Karl!

Please tell me/us the final revision of perforce used for pressing the
TeXlive 2005 CD/DVDs. I need this for the Debian build stuff, thanks.

Best wishes

hyperref: Next version, this is almost done.
* The source code documentation hyperref.pdf from hyperref.dtx
  will contain a section with links and bookmarks that point
  to the other docus.
  Thus you can then use "texdoc hyperref.pdf".
* And README and ChangeLog will also be available as
  README.pdf and ChangeLog.pdf. (The conversions are done
  automatically).

It may be best, but is it practical?  Will aliases help when you have
dozens of manual.pdf files?  

I suspect it is much easier to make changes in texdoc to support 
"package/manual".  On systems that support symlinks one could process
the doc tree to make package/manual.pdf -> package/package.pdf.

And how you want to solve the problem of several documentation
files? One symlink can point to just *one* file.

Just an explanation: if you keep the old version of the devnag
preprocessor with the new fonts and macros, it will still work. The only
problem will be that two new documented features will not work. so, if you
do not manage to recompile devnag, it is better to include the
preprocessor v.2.12 with macros ant fonts v.2.13. The output of older
versions of the preprocessor is fully compatible with new macros in
dnmacs.tex and dev.sty.

    Yes, but the LaTeX [team] does does not really want to maintain such files.

Sure, but then it seems the files should be in a contrib/ dir or
(better) latex/dvipdfmx/, or something.

Oh well, no need to be persnickety now :).  I added it.

Hopefully the others will at least be be mentioned in manual.pdf, but 
this emphasizes the point that, for many packages, the directory in the
doc tree is the real connection to the package and may contain multiple files
with generic names like manual.pdf that may indicated the type of content but
tell you nothing about the package.

I find it is generally easier to find things in TLC 2nd ed than to use
texdoc or texdoctk, but TLC has a nasty habit of walking down the hall when I'm
not watching.  Maybe we are at the stage where a search engine is the better
approach.  Is there a way to limit google to some texlive doc tree on the web?

I do not claim that "mv manual.pdf hyperref.pdf" solves all problems.
But it is better than what we have now.

If there are more files, names like hyperref-example.pdf would not be
bad.  They can be remembered easily.  But the main problem is that the
name "manual.pdf" is not unique.

But the main doc file should have a name which people expext.

TeXLive will be released in a few days, so we certainly will not be
able to have a perfect solution, but I think that 
"mv manual.pdf hyperref.pdf" is a significant improvement.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Perhaps somewhere, in many cases not:
* Different language versions:
  manual-en.pdf, manual-de.pdf, ...
  The normal expectation is then, that the users that open
  manual-en.pdf see the English version, readers of manual-de.pdf
  the German version, ... It would be a surprise, if theses manual
  versions start with a list of links to the different language
  versions. And which language should be choosen for this part?
* Separate source code documentation and user manual,
  articles, slides, ...

But you still have the directory!

The current texdoc behaviour is not appropriate for
documentation that consist of several files:
  TDS:doc/.../package/package.pdf % for manual
  TDS:doc/.../package/package.pdf % for source code doc
  -> you are running out of names
  -> it is not clear, what the type of content is
  -> redundant naming, you could strip the directory "package" level

A more naturally naming convention is:
  TDS:doc/.../package/manual.pdf
  TDS:doc/.../package/source.pdf

Possible ways to solve the texdoc problem:
* The package author offers a document for texdoc with standardized
  name (e.g. texdoc-index.[pdf,html,...] that
  contains explanations and links to the package's documentation.

    TDS:doc/.../packageA/texdoc-index.pdf
    TDS:doc/.../packageA/manual.pdf
    TDS:doc/.../packageA/source.pdf
    TDS:doc/.../packageB/texdoc-index.html
    TDS:doc/.../packageB/manual.html
    TDS:doc/.../packageB/README

  Then texdoc also looks for this document (texdoc-index.*).

* Or a separate data base is maintained with package overviews.
  (e.g. source in XML. PDF and HTML are automatically generated.)

     source/packageA.xml
     source/packageB.xml
     pdf/packageA.pdf
     pdf/pacakgeB.pdf
     html/packageA.html
     html/packageB.html

     Then texdoc also looks for this database.

* Or texdoc shows the directory and let the user decide, which file\
  he wants.

* ...

You forget about hyperref.dtx --> hyperref.pdf.
Therefore I think my solution is better (see one of my previous mails).

We have already "package/manual". This are not more chars
than "package-manual". But I don't know, why some versions
of texdoc understand "package/manual" and others don't.

hyperref.pdf is the document, generated from hyperref.dtx.
Thus this solution leads to confusion.

There is no file hyperref.pdf in TeXLive or teTeX.  Karl? Thomas?

Subject: [tex-live] pgf hosed?

Hi Karl!

Is change #8537 putting pgf into
	texmf-dist/latex
(without intermediate generi, tex or whatever) intended?

In 
	texmf-dist/latex
there is *only* pgf, is this the right place? At least *my* installation
does *not* find the pgf.sty file!

In the description of the change I see:
	pgf 3.00, now generic instead of latex.
This seems all a bit wrong.

Best wishes

Norbert

Maybe not, but it is a potential conflict so could make trouble in the future.
Renaming is dangerous since it may go against something in the package author's
mind.  Trying to get a bunch of authors to conform to any convention is hard,
so a more robust strategy is to make sure it is as easy as possbile for users
to
discover whatever documentation exists.  

Currently [well, 2 weeks ago test version]: 

$ texdoc -l hyperref
..20051012/texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue/entries/hyperref.html

$ texdoc -l hyperref/manual
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual.pdf
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual.html

So I have to guess the manual.pdf part.  The perl script be changed to
give all the .pdf and .html files, or possible the .txt files if no pdf or
html files are found.  

$ texdoc -l hyperref
..20051012/texmf-doc/doc/english/catalogue/entries/hyperref.html
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual.pdf
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual.html
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual2.html
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/manual3.html
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/paper.pdf
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/slides.pdf
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref/

I would be helpful to add a "-d" option to list matching directories in the
doc tree(s):

$ texdoc -d hyperref
..20051012/texmf-dist/doc/latex/hyperref

I think this could be done with a search of the form:

find `kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMF/doc' | tr : ' '` -name $name -type d
-print

Oh ok. I noticed that texexec doesn't use --progname=mpost, and
simply assumed that that was how it has always been.

That question is definately one for Hans (who is incommunicado

[patch snipped]

haven't tried the patch yet, but isn't it a bug in texmfmp.c that the
sequence of -options does matter at all? Is this behaviour documented
anywhere? IMHO parse_options() should make a round through the complete
argument list only gathering key-val pairs, and then the heuristics of
setting parameters should follow afterwards.

Admittedly I know this might not be the correct place but...

There is a small but critical typo in the file dansk.mbs.

The work 'string' appears three times, two as \string and one as just 
'string'. The just 'string' should be changed to \string. Otherwise the 
'dansk' setup for custombib will not work.

I have written to the author about 6 months ago, I think he fixed it but I 
haven't seen any uploads to CTAN about it.

Maybe be sent it to Patrick Daly, and he didn't send it further.

Should I have the author (another Dane) submit the dansk.mbs file directly 
to CTAN such that this error will be eliminated in the next version of TeX 
Live?

Sounds good, and also cc Patrick, so he can make a new release if he wishes.

Judging by the dates on the custom-bib files on CTAN, I suspect
something similar happened for norsk.mbs.

    haven't tried the patch yet, but isn't it a bug in texmfmp.c that the
    sequence of -options does matter at all? 

Some options determine what files get rid which in turn determine
evaluation of other options -- input filenames, for sure.  (Not sure
this is relevant for -fmt vs. -progname, but I don't think it's possible
to make interpretation be totally independent of the option order,
unfortunately.)

- sparc-solaris, sparc-linux, powerpc-aix binaries (Vladimir?).
- i386-freebsd binaries (Manfred said he will do).
- German doc update (Klaus is doing).
- Czech/Slovak doc update (Petr, Jan?).
- One more small Latin Modern update, maybe (Staszek?).

That's all I can think of, though doubtless there is more ... ?

but almost all these decisions happen after parse_options(). Only the
sequence of -fmt vs. -progname is handled inside. Why not put this check
after parse_options in texmfmp.c? Just move (2x)

      if (!user_progname) user_progname = optarg;

after the parse_options() call, see attached patch (not for TL05 :-)

BTW, is it for granted that e. g.

static string user_progname;

is automatically initialized to NULL just by this declaration? I
couldn't find where it would be initialized, but it _is_ NULL here ok.

Yes that one has the error too. I think one of them is a translation of 
the other.

I'll try and track down Rolf Lindgren, anyways I'll write Dag Langmyhr, he

I found Rolf's webpage and a newer email. So hopefully this will get

Did you fix norsk.mbs as well?

I just noticed that on CTAN there are two norsk.mbs (same error)

biblio/bibtex/contrib/oxford/lang/norsk.mbs
macros/latex/contrib/custom-bib/norsk.mbs

Dear TeXLivers,

let's for the moment assume that it uses progname=mpost (best not mess 
around with in around tex live launch time)

so, basically, the problem with mptopdf was in the mixed up switch

btw, i think that future versions of tex/mp should freeze all mem values 
at format time (currently only some values are frozen); maybe with the 
exception of the mem top/bot values

So many things to test, so little time.

Please try changing the -progname argument in the ppower4 script from 
"java" to "scripts":

#jarfile=`kpsewhich -progname=java -format='other binary files' pp4p.jar`
jarfile=`kpsewhich -progname=scripts -format='other binary files' pp4p.jar`

The script should check that the jar file is found.

lm-t5.enc is missing in current TeXLive.

Can someone check (with p4) whether other files had been removed

But what does

Is there something else wrong?

Hi!

I just downloaded the new iso image and discovered that it contains
gvim6-2-96-ls-tl8.exe
Since Vim 6.4 was released some weeks ago it may be a good idea to 
upgrade.
It also contains vim-latexSuite-1.5-rc1 while vim-latexSuite-1.5 is 
available.

On the Mac I had to replace altpdftex with simpdftex in TexShop, but 
that was indicated by altpdftex. Gerben, will you change this in future 
versions of TeXShop?
(I have version 1.40.)

Even my handwritten pdf-detection code seems to work. (Yes I know, I 
should use ifpdf.)

Just one question:
How do I share PK-fonts between texlive/2004 and texlive/2005?
Should I link texlive/2004/texmf-dist/fonts/pk to 
texlive/2005/texmf-dist/fonts/pk?
Should I tell texlive-2005 to use the 2004 folder?
Or should I simply forget about that and use lmr instead of cmr/ecr?

Axel

Hi Axel,

    Since Vim 6.4 was released some weeks ago it may be a good idea to 
    upgrade.

Thanks for the heads-up.  I deleted the old versions.  It's not obvious
to me exactly which distribution files are useful to include.  Also, it
seems painful to track, since vim has nothing in particular to do with
TeX and isn't on CTAN.

    Gerben, will you change this in future versions of TeXShop?  (I have
    version 1.40.)

TeXShop is maintained by Dick Koch, and I have a vague memory that he's
updated this for the next release.  Gerben can correct me ...

    How do I share PK-fonts between texlive/2004 and texlive/2005?

The simplest thing to do would be to make a copy :).
Or symlink the directories.

    Should I link texlive/2004/texmf-dist/fonts/pk to 
    texlive/2005/texmf-dist/fonts/pk?

Why are there pk files in texmf-dist/fonts/pk anyway?  They should be in
texmf-local or texmf-var.  There are just a few pk's in the distribution
(for no particularly crucial reason that I know of).

    Should I tell texlive-2005 to use the 2004 folder?

Sounds scary.  I wouldn't go there.  Won't you want to delete 2004
eventually?  

    Or should I simply forget about that and use lmr instead of cmr/ecr?

Well, the answer is yes to LM, but aside from that, there are Type 1
versions of all CM fonts for many years, and they are used by default.
There are also Type 1's as part of CM-super which cover mostly the same
stuff as EC (as I understand it), and they too are used by default.

So, in general, if you just take the distribution as it is, usual
documents should end up using only Type 1's, no bitmaps.

Best,
Karl

Hmmm, I don't know if vim6.4 works well on different Windows and is well
enough integrated with latex-suite, so I'd prefer keeping stable old one.
Just for make Windows people live more easy...

The old version wasn't even an official release.  It seems very weird to
keep promulgating it.

As far as I can tell, all that junk in support is basically wasted
space, most of it years out of date.  It's not installed.  Anyone who
actually wanted to use it therefore has to unpack and install it
manually.  And anyone smart enough to do that is smart enough to get a
new version from the web.

That said, I don't really care.  We can keep the old version, it
obviously makes no real difference.
