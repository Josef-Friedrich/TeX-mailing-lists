Subject: [tex-live] texmf-dist/aliases file removed from TL
Message-ID: <200505312314.j4VNEmm22326@f7.net>

Well, since my earlier message garnered no response, I've taken the more
drastic step now of completely removing the texmf-dist aliases file.

(1) Many of the aliased files, such as uzdr.tfm, exist as actual files
    in TL, causing only confusion.

(2) The install*.sh scripts did not install aliases file last year.
    Therefore people who wholesale-copied the tree from the DVD got it,
    but people who used the install scripts didn't.  This inconsistency
    cannot be good.

Hope it flies ...

Hi,

I'm just wondering, why is dvipdfmx (x !) only shipped with the windows version? 
It's the successor to dvipdfm and has been around for ages. It has better pdf 
support etc. I cannot locate it in the unix tree.

    I'm just wondering, why is dvipdfmx (x !) only shipped with the
    windows version?  

Only because it's very time-consuming to put new things into the
sources.  (This is also the only reason why xpdf is not [yet] included;
it is my prime target for addition.)  I will look into it.

    It's the successor to dvipdfm 

Why isn't there one program, named dvipdf?  It's very confusing and
breaks uses of the old name.

Maybe we should try to contact Mark Wicks and see if he would agree to
dvipdfmx being installed as dvipdf and dvipdfm as well, and changing the
web pages, etc.

Thanks,
k

dvipdf is a script in Ghostscript which uses gs's pdfwrite.

i have no idea if dvipdfm is actively maintained; there probably is a good 
reason for the new name (like tex and etex; there has been odvips in the past if 
i'm right); there are also localized cjk versions

one problem may be that in asia people are already very accustomed to the 'x'; i 
would not be surprised if there are more 'mx' users than 'm' users

Subject: [tex-live] tpm directory names
Message-ID: <IMEDICBDMEHFMIMFJKGKEEMECIAA.balcar@ati.ac.at>

Dear TUG,

I have recently acquired the LaTeX Companion 2, which
contains a CD with a newer TeX Live 7 version, with slight differences
compared to my current (old,2002) installation on a Win98 system.
.
In detail, the directory names in the \texmf\tpm directory
(tex packet manager?) differ. What were
previously ...\tpm\collections, ...\tpm\packages, ...\tpm\schemes
are now ...\tpm\collection, ...\tpm\package, ...\tpm\scheme

The (new, TLC2) TeXsetup program does, therefore, no longer find
the appropriate directory names on disk when I want to
run  in maintenance mode to update or install a new package.

Please advise me on the proper procedure, should I
a) rename the directories on the hard disk (old name -> new name),
b) or remove the old and install the new tex-live version
    because the incompatibility is intentional,
c) or do something else?

With apologies if my enquiry is to an inappropriate forum.
Many thanks in advance

Greetings,

    previously ...\tpm\collections, ...\tpm\packages, ...\tpm\schemes
    are now ...\tpm\collection, ...\tpm\package, ...\tpm\scheme

Hmm.  I suspect this was a change between 2002 and 2003, and installing
the new TeX Live version in a new directory would be the way to go.  
Incremental updates of TL are not, at present, possible.

On the other hand, there was a release in 2004, too.  So in general it
would be nicer to install that than the 2003 version, of course.
Unfortunately there was no GUI installer for Windows with the 2004
release, although a cmdline installer was written shortly afterwards,
and a GUI installer is being tested now.
http://tug.org/texlive/windows.html tries to explain the situation and
gives more links.  (Feel free to ask if you're not sure what to do after
reading that.)

Finally, if you're in the mood to test a beta release, you might look at
http://www.fptex.org.  The author, Fabrice Popineau, has written nearly all
the Windows support for TeX Live for years.

Best regards,
Karl

    i have no idea if dvipdfm is actively maintained; 

Not any more, as far as I can tell.  The last release was in 2001.
(Not as bad as some others :)

    there probably is a good reason for the new name

I suspect Cho could have just taken over maintenance of dvipdfm without
creating a new package, but maybe I am wrong.  Doesn't matter now.

    one problem may be that in asia people are already very accustomed
    to the 'x'; i would not be surprised if there are more 'mx' users
    than 'm' users

Sure.  I'm saying it should be installed as *both* names.

    dvipdf is a script in Ghostscript which uses gs's pdfwrite.

Ah, so I see.  Interesting.  gs just took over that name; there was an
original C program (unrelated to gs) released by that name, as I recall.
That's where dvipdfm came from: started with dvipdf and instead of
taking over the package, made up a new name.

dvipdfmx searches for the glyphlist.txt by kpse_program_text_format,
so it should be under $TEXMF/dvipdfm/.

( 
  Runtime program name of dvipdfmx is "dvipdfm" since it
  starts by kpse_set_program_name(argv[0], "dvipdfm")
)

Akira

so the file is currnetly in the wrong spot;

now that we're discussing dvipdfmx ... do you know a way to use a dvipdfmx 
specific map path

../map/dvipdfmx/abc.map
../map/pdftex/abc.map

i want pdftex as well as dvipdfmx to use his/her own map file;
since dvipdfmx does not set a progname (or for this purpose, a maybe a $driver 
variable)

since we have multiple axis

engine   -> pdfetex aleph xetex
progname -> plain, latex, context

we also need a variable

driver   -> dvips, pdftex, dvipdfm

so that we can have

TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/{fonts/map/{$driver,dvips,}//

which then takes us to either the pdftex or dvipdfm subpath without potential 
conflicts

concerning map files ...

   TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{$progname,pdftex,dvips,}//

should work ok for all backends although it's handicapped by the fact that in 
the case of context during a pdftex run it becomes

   TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{context,pdftex,dvips,}//

(lucky me that there is no fonts/map/context)

and in case of plain, probably something:

   TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{pdftex,pdftex,dvips,}//

(i assume that kpse removes duplicate search paths from the expansion; the 
second pdftex entry cannot be removed because else in a context run pdftex would 
not be able to locate the map files)

Subject: [tex-live] tl default installation dir
Message-ID: <200506040221.j542LwJ27251@f7.net>

The default installation directory in the TeX Live Unix install scripts
has always been /usr/TeX.  I would like to propose to change that, to
/usr/local/texlive2005.

I find it hard to imagine any scenario where /usr/TeX is the best target
directory.  It probably contributes to the ongoing confusion of TL can
be installed "over" teTeX in GNU/Linux distributions, or even that one
year's TL can be installed "over" another year's.  It's certainly not
what we recommend in the doc.

Since it's just the default, anyone who really wants /usr/TeX can still
get it.  Since the whole install is interactive (a whole problem in
itself), I can't see that there is a significant compatibility issue.

Objections?

I would like to propose that the default installation be "all" packages,
instead of our "recommended" subset.  Typical disks are huge these days.
Finding and installing packages later is a huge, huge, time-consuming
drag.  Especially with TL, where updates over the net are not supported.
(Obviously a problem in itself, but that's a separate issue.)

I'd also rename "recommended" to something else, "medium" or something.

Again, just changing the default, so if people want the smaller set,
they can still have it.

Objections?

Just as setting $engine required changes in the engines, this requires
changes in the drivers.  (Obviously, because only the engine/driver
know what this should be set to.)

The engines just do (in web2c/lib/texmfmp.c:maininit)

  kpse_set_program_name (argv[0], user_progname);
  xputenv("engine", TEXMFENGINENAME);

with TEXMFENGINENAME itself a #define in texmfmp.h.

The reason we have the big mess of different TEXINPUTS paths is that
there are conflicting files with the same name. I don't think that this
is a desirable situation to maintain this mess of search paths.

The fonts/map subtree is something new and (at least in teTeX) there
are no conflicting files. So all applications can use fonts/map// for
searching map files. In my opinion, we should think of proper filenames
instead of inventing yet another set of search paths which will cause
additional trouble.

if tds/kpse/cnf cannot handle duplicate filenames and locate files based on 
search patterns we're kind of lost; so far we've been lucky that not so many 
conflicts arise in the tex tree (although occasionally i'm bitten by files that 
match unexpectingly

While I strongly support the notion that user installations should go

        and thus, its tree can be used by several different
        architectures.  At our site, and according to common GNU

            /usr/local/texlive/2005, /usr/local/texlive/2006,

Hmm.  Maybe.  I've never tried that, and it's never been recommended,
although I see the logic.  I suggested /usr/local/texlive2005 because
that is what has been recommended in the doc (by me :).  Do others have
strong feelings?

I don't think clutter in /usr/local is a strong argument; one release a
year (if we're lucky), and older trees could always be (re)moved if
desired.

The main thing I want to do is make the default be something other than
/usr/TeX.  Whether it is /usr/local/texlive2005 or
/usr/local/texlive/2005, I don't feel as strongly about.

	/usr/local/share/texlive/2005, /usr/local/share/texlive/2006,

Here I cannot agree.  The GNU meaning of /share is for
architecture-independent data files.  Precisely because TL includes
binaries, I don't think it should go under share.  Following the GNU
directory meanings precisely would mean an entirely different
distribution, and we're not going to do that.

Thanks,
karl

    based on search patterns 

Hans, we've been through this before.  They can't, and they've never
been able to.  The way duplicate filenames are handled is by having
different paths.  Yes, it is suboptimal.

    so far we've been lucky that not so many conflicts arise in the tex

It is not entirely a matter of luck.  We explicitly work hard to arrange
things to avoid this.

    (although occasionally i'm bitten by files that match unexpectingly

Indeed.  Me too.  Nothing is perfect.


Meanwhile, getting back to the problem at hand.  In what is in TL today,
there are no duplicate filenames under fonts/maps/dvipdfm.  What are the
duplicate filenames that you insist on putting there, and where are they
going to end up in TL?

As far as I can see, the short-term solution for your dvipdfmx problem
is to use MAPFONTS.dvipdfm.  If that doesn't work, then it needs to be
debugged and fixed.  If dvipdfmx doesn't set $progname, then it has to
be changed to do so (that is why the dot notation wouldn't work).  I
will try to look at this when I put dvipdfmx into the tree; hopefully
Cho will look at it sooner.

As another short-term solution, I would have no overriding objection to
adding $progname to the default MAPFONTS path, although I'd rather not.
But since apparently dvipdfmx is not setting $progname in the first
place, I don't see that it will help, so let's not.

Another possible solution would be for dvipdfmx to use a different
suffix, instead of .map.  After all, it is fairly bizarre for a
different syntax to use the same extension.  If dvipdfmx used .dpmap,
the problem would away.

The ideal long-term solution, as you know, is for all the programs to
recognize the same map syntax.

Hi Martin,

    I'm not fluent in all the FHSs, but what about /opt/texlive2005 ?

I think /usr/local is a bit more universal than /opt.

We're only talking about the default.  No default will satisfy everyone
(or even a plurality) ...

i have an option for users to generate dvipdfm specific files, and i usethe same 
names; i don't want to clutter context with funny prefixes that in the end even 
i forget where/when /what they mean;

i'm playing with that and it looks like that works,

so, instead of

   TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map//

i propose

   TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{$progname,pdftex,dvips,}//

this works with the non duplicate filenames (i.e. the big updmap approach) as 
well as program specific approach

i now have a version that does set it (i'v ebeen testign several binaries and 
now have the latest version); so adapting the path is a working solution

well, even more bizare is to use no suffix at all (scripts) or to use different 
suffixes for the same thing (pattern files etc) so that's no argument -)

sure, and we're discussing/working on that that in a separate thread; probably 
next year's tex live will have that solution

PS. I can fool around in texeec with setting paths and such but that's not so

So far you have only talked about dvipdfmx.

Are you also potentially generating dvips and pdftex map files with
arbitrary names, so, for example, there might be three optima.map files,
one in each syntax?

If that's the case, then yes, I suppose changing TEXFONTMAPS to include
$progname is best, since having a separate definition of TEXFONTMAPS for
each program seems pretty pointless.  Sigh.

I won't bother arguing the other points, since it won't get us any
closer to release, and we all have more useful things to do.

indeed, apart from general font usage, i also use font map files toachieve 
special effects

No argument that we want to support dvipdfmx.  That was never in
question.  The question was how.

I will change the TL texmf.cnf.

Message-ID: <200506042241.j54MfpH12776@tug.org>

1) I've added ushyphmax.tex (Dr. Kuiken's max patterns for US English)
to the TeX Live language.us file.  It is not the default, just another
language (named ushyphmax).  The default remains, and should always
remain, Knuth's original hyphen.tex.

I don't know how to add support for ushyphmax to babel.  If anyone can
look into this and submit a patch to Johannes, please do.


2) In the process of doing this, I noticed that patterns for a few
languages are commented out in the .dat files, although the pattern
files exist in the distribution.  Does anyone know why?  Otherwise I am
tempted to say they should be enabled (if the user selects those
packages, of course):
% welsh cyhyph.tex
% estonian ethyph.tex
% romanian rohyph.tex
% slovene sihyph.tex
% serbian srhyphc.tex
% turkish tkhyph.tex

(Also it would seem that the comment should be %! rather than %, if it's
to be commented at all.)

    I prefer /usr/local/texlive/2005 

Good.  Done.

I realized this has the advantage that texmf-local can now be a sibling
with 2005 -- at least I think this the right thing, since (except for
the darn map files) texmf-local trees with release N should keep working
with N+1.

texmf-var, on the other hand, seems specific to a given release, .fmt
changes, etc., so that should be under 2005, I think.

Thus:
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-var
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-dist
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-doc
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf

Speak if objections ...

this could be tricky in determining where texmf-local lives (that is, when it's 
specified relative to the texmf parent path), i.e. this autoparent trickery; 
imagine users who have more trees (texmf-extra, texmf-fontst, texmf-project, 
texmf-tugboat, ...), so maybe you will need something

year = 2005
TEXMFMAIN = $SELFAUTOPARENT/{$year,}/texmf

needs some deep thinking (for me)

They can do whatever they want, just as they did before.

All that happened is the *default* of /usr/TeX changed.  Wherever
texmf-local can be now, it could be before, and vice versa.  So whatever
you're worried about (which I don't understand, but please don't take
the time to explain :), you should have been worried about before, if
you are of a mind to worry.  Users could have done it all along.

Nothing has changed in the code or texmf.cnf, and nothing needs to
change.

In fact, just pretend nothing has changed at all.
Forget I ever said anything :).

I would prefer not a texmf-local that is independent of the version of 
TL. People can keep a texmf-local with stuff in the 2005 setting (that 
they keep around for old projects) that for instance is not needed 
anymore in the 2008 version (or in different formats). Remember the 
updmap and friends changes we had and the tree layout changes. Nothing 
should prevent us from optimizing again in the future.

Thus:
/usr/local/texlive/2005/texmf-local

It is easy enough to copy things over if you want to. Having it "forced 
shareable" between years only makes for problems in the future.

The HA-prosper currently in TL matches what is on CTAN.  I hope that's
what needed.

I updated it a few days ago, along with a ton of other packages.

     "forced shareable"

There is nothing "forced" about it.  Once again, all that changed was
the default.  People can and do do different things.

In particular, people right now often have a texmf-local which is
independent of the latest version.  I do myself.  That more or less
seems like the whole point of texmf-local to me.  Yes, there may be
occasional problems with updates, but most of the time it is no problem
at all, and it is simpler and more logical for it to be independent.

You say it's easy to copy, but (a) if it's a pure copy then there's no
reason to do it, and (b) if it's not a pure copy (like the map change),
then it's not easy.

Anyway, if there is some consensus that we should recommend that
texmf-local should go along with the release, then the most important
thing to change is the documentation.  Which has recommended that it be
independent for years, maybe since day 1.

Once again: it's never been possible to assume that texmf-local is in
any particular location relative to the main directory.  The recent
change does not alter *anything* in terms of what implementations need
to handle.  I guess it is bringing up the topic for discussion, but
that's it.

Greetings,

    Would it be possible to update the binaries provided in
    http://tug.org/texlive/tl-2004-sparc-solaris.tgz, 

Unfortunately I think this would take too much effort.
pdftex hasn't been updated in the TL sources yet, so it's not just a
matter of rerunning a build.

    or can I find this somewhere else?

Well, if you're willing to build from source, you can grab the current
pdftex (from pdftex.org) and do it that way.  Once you have binaries, I
think they should be able to be put into the TL tree without incident.

(I advise building without any optimization on sparc, FWIW.  TOo many
compiler bugs have bit us in the past.)

Perhaps someone in the pdftex group would have (or can make) sparc
binaries for the current sources; you might ask pdftex@tug.org if no one
else replies here.

Best regards,
Karl

I suspect this is bug #315 (pdflatex on solaris font problems
with acroread); this is fixed in the next version of pdfTeX
(most likely next week).

Message-ID: <87br6ep68y.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Package: tetex-bin
Version: 3.0-4
Severity: normal

Hi,

as discussed before, for the inclusion of tex-live packages into Debian,
we need to split off parts of tetex-bin into a tex-common package.  This
is the bug report that is going to remind us about this.

On a related note, maybe we should consider to create a tetex-common
package which is built from the tex-common source (and thus does not
trigger downloads of -base, -extra, or -bin when updated) and contains
as much of the Debian-specific teTeX stuff as possible.

Norbert, it seems nobody has reported an ITP bug for tex-live against
the wnpp package.  Will you do this?

Regards, Frank

I have now checked the differences between tetex-texmf.cnf and texlive
texmf.cnf.

I would say there is nothing which prevents us from putting the whole
texmf.cnf stuff into the tex-common package. What do you think?

There are *really* minor diffs, the most important one is probably the
one between
tetex:
TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map//;$TEXMF/dvips//

texlive:
TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map/{$progname,pdftex,dvips,}//

TeXlive contains a comment for this:
% font name map files.  This isn't just fonts/map// because ConTeXt
% wants support for having files with the same name in the different
% subdirs.  Maybe if the programs ever get unified to accepting the same
% map file syntax the definition can be simplified again.

So I guess this will make into tetex, too.

other differences:
(1. always tetex, 2. always texlive)

ENCFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/enc//;$TEXMF/dvips//
ENCFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/enc//


only in texlive:
OSFONTDIR = /please/set/osfontdir/in/the/environment


OPENTYPEFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/opentype//
OPENTYPEFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/opentype//;$OSFONTDIR//

the following one is strange in tetex, what shoud /usr/etc contain?
MIMELIBDIR = /usr/etc                   (in tetex???!?! /usr/etc???)
MIMELIBDIR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/etc

MAILCAPLIBDIR = /usr/etc
MAILCAPLIBDIR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/etc

only in texlive, will go away for the debian package, as all the doc
files go to /usr/share/doc/texlive-package/...
TEXMFDOCDIR = $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-doc/doc

TEXDOCS = .;$TEXMF/doc//
TEXDOCS = .;$TEXMF/doc//;$TEXMFDOCDIR//
(irrelevant, see above)


More interesting is the mem size differences:
(again 1. tetex, 2. texlive)
main_memory = 1000000
main_memory = 1500000

font_mem_size = 500000
font_mem_size = 1000000

param_size = 5000
param_size = 10000

stack_size = 1500
stack_size = 5000

ocp_buf_size = 20000
ocp_buf_size = 500000


And then, the following things are only in texlive, don't know what they
are used for ;-)
main_memory.mf          = 800000
main_memory.mpost       = 1000000

Well, thats for the differences between texlive and tetex texmf.cnf.

IMHO there is nothing we cannot sort out so that at the end we arrive at
a texmf.cnf stuff which is in tex-common package, e.g. already your
texmf.d/ scripts.


More to come, as I have now a chroot sid with the tetex-3.0 packages ;-)

these are the fall-backs (but if i were you i'd take the larger values); most 
macro packages have larger associated memory values

this is for the more demanding metapost user and since metapost is becoming more 
popular (watch how texmf/metapost grows) it makes sense to have the large 
texlive memory values

I am interested that these tetex definitions contain $TEXMF/dvips.  I
thought that was what was being argued against last year with the whole

Anyway, I have added $TEXMF/dvips// to the TL definitions.

I don't believe MIMELIBDIR and MAILCAPDIR are important.

For t2, it's apparently just a source file used in generating enc's, it

that's correct - it's was used in generation of various files, and may
stay in the doc tree (or moved to the texmf/source tree).

The lcdf-typetools do read glyphlist.txt at runtime.  In my distribution, they 
read it from PREFIX/share/glyphlist.txt (they do not search for it in kpathsea). 
  I don't know what the TeXLive distribution does instead.  Probably I should 
update to search using kpathsea when available.

teTeX does not have what is claimed here. Or, Norbert is speaking of a
different teTeX than me...

  $ grep TEXFONTMAPS /t/src/tetex-src/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in
  TEXFONTMAPS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/map//

  $ grep ENCFONTS /t/src/tetex-src/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in

de we need an entry point

or maybe in this case

Sorry, I disn't state it in full correctness, I meant debian-tetex
packages have this. As we are speaking about packaging texlive for
debian, I thought that it was clear what I compared.

Frank has for sure an explanation why this is different in debian.

    I don't know what the TeXLive distribution does instead.  

Nothing.  So the file is not found, unless it happens to exist in the
user's /usr/local/share.

    Probably I should update to search using kpathsea when available.

Yes, I think so.  The simplest thing would be to do the same thing that
dvipdfmx does, and search using "other text files".  That will end up
looking in $TEXMF/$progname// for it, I believe.  

Which leads to more questions:

1) Are there other data files you search for now?

2) Do you explicitly set $progname?  If not, it is essentially the
   basename of $0, so it'll be otftotfm or whatever program is looking
   for it.  In which case it seems like it would be desirable to set it,
   which I believe basically amounts to
kpse_reset_program_name("lcdf-typetools");

3) Since I gather you extend the file (with additional code points), we
   shouldn't try to share it with other glyphlist.txt's even if we
   wanted to (which we don't).  Right?

Thanks,
Karl

OK.  The code will (1) look under "other text files", then if not found, (2) 
look in PREFIX/share/lcdf-typetools ($pkgdatadir).

The makefiles will not, however, install glyphlist.txt in a TDS.  You'll have to 
do that by hand.

> Which leads to more questions:

No.  lcdf-typetools installs 7t.enc in PREFIX/share/lcdf-typetools, but just as 
information.

OK.  I had been setting it explicitly to argv[0]; will anything go wrong for 
existing installations if I just switch to lcdf-typetools?  Also, lcdf-typetools 
contains a dash, which leads to kpathsea lookup on environment variables that 
contain dashes.  That'll surely cause a problem for someone.  I suggest 
"lcdftools" instead, which is what otftotfm already uses for vendor strings.

That's right, I wouldn't.  The lcdf glyphlist is different from Adobe's in 
several ways.

One of them is actually worth some thought.  In Adobe glyphlist, the name "phi" 
maps to a "loopy" phi, while "phi1" maps to a "straight" phi.  In TeX practice, 
as codified in the encoding files, this is reversed: "phi" is straight, "phi1" 
is loopy.  My glyphlist.txt recodes to match the TeX practice, but this feels a 
little iffy.

I will release 2.34 with these changes if you approve.

    "lcdftools" instead

Sounds like a good name.  Looks like you're right about a - being
problematic in the name.

    The makefiles will not, however, install glyphlist.txt in a TDS.
    You'll have to do that by hand.

Sure, that's fine.

    My glyphlist.txt recodes to match the TeX practice, but this feels a

I am agnostic on this.  Maybe others here have an opinion.  Have
lcdftools users expressed a preference one way or the other?  What is
the practical effect?

    I will release 2.34 with these changes if you approve.

Go for it.  Thanks for the quick response, as usual!

Joichi Ito has seeded a bittorrent for TeX Live, but from his laptop,
which isn't always on, etc.  Maybe someone else would like to take 
this up?  I've attached the "torrent file" he sent me.

Intentionally leaving off Joichi's email to try not to add to his spam,
will send to anyone who wants it.

Instructions that I could put onto the TL web pages would be welcome, too.

Thanks,

Just download the client

Then open the torrent file [attached]. You may need to click  
start (the button that looks like a play button.) Then it will start  
downloading from peers. After it has downloaded it, if you keep  
BitTorrent open, it will automatically be "seeding" by making your

The good practical effect of the phi-vs.-phi1 change is that people using 
"texmital.enc" or "plmi.enc" with otftotfm will get what they expect.

The bad practical effect is that people writing new encoding files will continue 
to make the same mistake as "texmital.enc".

Oh well, it's not a big deal.

I've released 2.34.  Thanks!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.56.0506122032510.4661@pasta.austrics.com.au>

Hi TeX,

I've been playing with some of Alan Hoenig's "Tex Unbound" book
examples - I needed underline and overstrike for some legal
documents and got good results.

However I tried to use mathinst to get the euler math fonts
working and it looks like mathinst is well and truly broken. Has
it been replaced or are there other ways of doing such things
these days?

Cheers,
Geoff Russell

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0506130629560.7413-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

Finally I've made a big repackage of cm, latex and amsfonts (as promissed:)
The idea was to clean up the mess with ams fonts, clearly separate the 
packages and make them complete (with all additional files, like .map 
files, etc.)

1. amsfonts are merged into
texmf-dist/doc/fonts/amsfonts/
texmf-dist/dvips/ams/
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/bluesky/ams/ (missing files added from CTAN)
texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/ams/  (new map files!)
texmf-dist/fonts/source/ams/
texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/ams/
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/bluesky/ams/   
texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/

2. cm
texmf-dist/dvips/cm/
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/bluesky/cm/
texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/cm/   (new map files!)
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/cm/
texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/cm/
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/

3. latex
texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/
texmf-dist/fonts/afm/bluesky/latex/
texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/latex/ (new map file!)
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/latex/
texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/latex/
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/bluesky/latex/
texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/
texmf-dist/source/latex/base/

However I failed to rebuild .tpm files for 1. 2. and 3. (any help?)

Affected .tpm files:
texmf/tpm/bin-tetex.tpm (removed bsr*.map, we have new .map files in 
                         texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/)
texmf-dist/tpm/euler.tpm (now contains only support by Frank Jensen)
texmf-dist/tpm/amssymbols.tpm (deleted)
texmf-dist/tpm/wncyr.tpm      (deleted)
texmf-dist/tpm/collection-fontsrecommended.tpm (removed amssymbols)
texmf-dist/tpm/collection-langcyrillic.tpm (removed wncyr)

Still pending is "cmextra" in texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/cmextra/
Who knows what's the original source, as I cannot find them on CTAN?
That's something different as old AMS cmextra,
tfm files are however in texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/cm/

Thanks for pointing that. As I see teTeX/TL contains only some of those
sources. Anyway, fonts/tfm/public/cmextra should be also made, or can
we merge cm with cmextra?

teTeX has:

I think that it is worth keeping cm / cmextra separate.

And, that's how it is suggested by special.map (from fontname):

@c First the extra CM fonts from the AMS, where the names must match exactly.
cmbsy5		ams		cmextra
cmbsy6		ams		cmextra
cmbsy7		ams		cmextra
cmbsy8		ams		cmextra
cmbsy9		ams		cmextra
cmcsc8		ams		cmextra
cmcsc9		ams		cmextra
cmex7		ams		cmextra
cmex8		ams		cmextra
cmmib5		ams		cmextra
cmmib6		ams		cmextra
cmmib7		ams		cmextra
cmmib8		ams		cmextra
cmmib9		ams		cmextra

@c The 75 standard cm fonts (+cmex9) from Knuth. List them in all available
@c pointsizes, since there also exists a sauter version of them.
cmb10		public		cm
cmbsy10		public		cm
...

BTW: can someone please enlighten me about the history of cmex9?

I don't recall whether my other mail also went to this list, therefore
again:

This setting was meant to implement a "compatibility mode", and allow
packages for teTeX-2.0.2 on Debian to work with the teTeX-3.0 packages
that I was/am preparing.  Now that sarge is released (without
teTeX-3.0), I will drop it and force the other packages' maintainers to
update their installation paths.

OK, done for TL, as well as finally cleaned amsfonts, cm, latex and 
symbol packages and their tpm files (however symbol is still somehow
messy because of adobe/symbol and cmpsfonts-adobe/symbol ).
Anyway, the packages looks more clean, I hope.

Agreed for ams root, but cmextra etc. below seems not needed, so perhaps
fontname would be changed...

Thomas, many thanks for your help with that great cleaning and new
map files (they are waiting on CTAN/incoming).

Oops... I had looked in an older version of my tree. Yes, after the
discussion, that the separation into euler / symbols etc. was not needed
for the ams fonts, I had moved the files around:

  map/dvips/ams
  source/public/ams
  tfm/public/ams
  type1/bluesky/ams

That public/cm vs. public/cmextra is not affected by this and still
separate in my tree.

I will follow that and only move
source/ams -> source/public/ams
tfm/ams    -> tfm/public/ams

right below the line with xmallocarray, and to common.defines the line

Hi Karl, hi all!

After the reshuffling it seems that some fonts are a bit messed up:

pdflatex cannot find som efonts:
Warning: pdflatex (file sfrm0800.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for
reading

Warning: pdflatex (file sftt1095.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for

while dvips -Ppdf + ps2pdf works seems to work, although I am not sure
as I don't see any entry in the ps file.

Anyway, what is the reason for this?

All tpm files in texmf-dist/tfm contain

  <TPM:Build/>

but only three (amsfonts, cmextra, and latex) contain

  <TPM:Build>

Looks like a bug in the script which creates TPM files...

Interestingly, tpm files in texmf/tpm are fine.

Message-ID: <20050619.012115.236262549.wl@gnu.org>


Right now I'm in the process of checking my CJK package (and
eventually updating it).  While doing this I just found out that all
CJK-related entries for special.map are missing (for e.g. the fonts in
cns.tpm).  Ideally, all packages which need entries in this file
supply them separately, but looking into the TPM files I see that not
a single package does this.

How shall I proceed?  Ideally, I would like to have

  <TPM:Execute function="addSpecialMap" parameter="cns.specialmap"/>

but such a function apparently doesn't exist.

Please advise.

Karl,


can you update the dvipdfmx stuff to the current CVS version?  It
contains a very important improvement for my CJK package, namely to
use a cmap file `foo.cmap' (for ToUnicode mapping) for a font
`foo.tfm' -- since the CJK fonts in TeXLive are splitted into Type 1
subfonts, this greatly simplifies the process to get proper ToUnicode
mappings.

Was the problem with bibtex8 not finding any files ever solved? I 
experienced it
lately on OS-X. Posting the question on the tex-osx-list lead to 
interesting

When I run  bibtex8 sampleart  on the trivial TUGboat sample file
(http://tug.org/TUGboat/sampleart.ltx), it finds plain.bst and
tugboat.bib, but that is on GNU/Linux, with the current bibtex8 binary

Can someone with a Windows or Mac box try it, please?  If it fails and

Indeed.  Clearly special.map would be best handled in this way, similar
to the main maps, but we're not going to solve that problem now.

    All tpm files in texmf-dist/tfm contain
      <TPM:Build/>

Unless I've got my slashes confused, this is simply an empty element and
is not a problem.

    but only three (amsfonts, cmextra, and latex) contain
      <TPM:Build>

I believe Staszek put those in in his recent changes, under a
misconception which I've mentioned before: in texmf-dist and texmf-doc,
it is useless to have a <TPM:Build> ... </TPM:Build> section with
RunPatterns, because the Tools/tlrebuild script *automatically*
regenerates the entire tpm file in those hiers and throws out any such
patterns and other such "extraneous" stuff anyway.

Put another way, the file lists in texmf-dist and texmf-doc cannot be
changed manually.  They must follow certain patterns, usually meaning
that all the files have to be in a directory with the same name as the
package name.  Any unavoidable special cases have to be accounted for in
the tpm-factory 

The only things in the texmf-dist & texmf-doc tpm's that can be edited
manually are the text parts: name, version, description, author, etc.
The file lists are completely regenerated whenever tlrebuild is run.

This was one of the major purposes of Fabrice's reorganization last year.

I'm trying a rebuild now, and it looks like the patterns were simply
redundant.  Whew.  (A few of the dvipdfmx files I was messing with
aren't installed properly yet, but there were no complaints about the
files in Staszek's font reorg.)
    
    Looks like a bug in the script which creates TPM files...

I don't think so.

    Interestingly, tpm files in texmf/tpm are fine.

The tpm files in texmf/tpm are not completely autoregenerated, so there
the RunPatterns and similar are what count.

In texmf, editing the file lists is still useless, though; the patterns
must be changed to add or remove files, since the patterns are what
tlrebuild uses to generate the file lists.  Fabrice wrote some
additional utilities that check the tree against the patterns, etc., etc.

Yes, but it isn't so clear how to do that.
Now such special cases should be applied for amsfonts (and perhaps for
some other packages).

Anyway, amsfonts.tpm again doesn't contain fonts themselves...
We need "amsfonts" key for latex's stuff and "ams" key for fonts.
We have now the layout which couldn'd be messed with other packages
I discussed many times that layout with Thomas and we agreed that
such layout will be also followed in teTeX.

This not applies for <TPM:Requires> I hope. They should be still
edited by hand.

I don't believe this is related to the ams/etc. reshuffling, but rather
to my removing all of cm-super except the 10pt sizes.  I did this so
that the inst version could even come close to fitting on a CD.

Vladimir told me that with \usepackage{type1ec}, the 10pt fonts should
get scaled for all sizes and it should work out.  If you want the full
set of fonts, you'll have to get them from CTAN (or use Latin Modern,
maybe?).  Sorry.

I seem to remember removing all the non-10pt map file entries, but I see
that cm-super-*.map still have everything.  I'll look into that.

This is not particularly difficult or dangerous in and of itself.

I've done it myself, thanks.  Right now I've only added entries for
bitmap fonts, but theoretically most Type 1 fonts used by the CJK
package need similar entries (these are a few hundred lines).  Shall I
add them too?  Given that xdvi, dvips, and pdftex directly use the
outline fonts it's probably overkill, but...

What do you think?

I'm not sure I understand.  Are these fonts which only exist in outline

Even if they do exist as bitmaps, would users ever actually
intentionally want to use them instead of outlines?  It doesn't seem

Hmm, now special.map in the TeXLive repository doesn't contain my
entries...  I think that something must be screwed up.  Please check.

This what I've asked.  So I won't do anything further.

I think so too, but there might be drivers which still can't use PS
fonts and need to call mktexpk.

    Hmm, now special.map in the TeXLive repository doesn't contain my
    entries...  I think that something must be screwed up.  Please check.

Everything is fine.  As I mentioned in passing, special.map (and all the
other files from fontname) are automatically updated.  So:

1) you edited the file in p4;
2) the autoupdate ran and overwrote your changes;
3) I noticed this and installed your changes into the master file
   (~www/fontname/special.map on tug.org);
4) the autoupdate ran again and updated the file.

You noticed them missing between 3 and 4.  They're there now.

Cheers,
karl

Hi Lars,

(Sorry for the delayed reply.)

    I;ve just reinstalled my linux laptop so I need a new LaTeX
    installation.  I was woundering when the TL 2005 will be ready for
    testing?

We are trying to freeze the code and major package updates by July 1.
Optimistic, but it's a goal.

    I wouldn't mind testing an unstable version.

You can test what there is right now if you so desire:
  http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Images/test/

The AMS fonts and dvipdfmx aren't quite there yet, I hope to fix that
tomorrow or early next week.  There will also be a round of updates to
the code before the release.  But still, what's there should basically
be functional, other problem reports are definitely welcome.

Best,
Karl

You mean that the array might be moved somewhere else and that some

(Sorry for the delayed reply.)

    However I tried to use mathinst to get the euler math fonts
    working and it looks like mathinst is well and truly broken. Has
    it been replaced or are there other ways of doing such things
    these days?

I thought that all the best support for the Euler fonts was already
included in TeX Live (and other distributions), with no need to install
anything.  My understanding is that Walter Schmidt's eulervm package is
the best approach these days.
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/eulervm.html

I've never heard of mathinst :).  I see it existed in TL as
support/mathinst.zip, but was never really included.  If you're curious
about that, fontinst@tug.org is probably the best place to ask.

Best,
karl

I just checked in a change to the source.development/Build script such
that everything gets installed in a subdir inst/, instead of in a bunch
of subdirs directly in Build (bin, include, man, texmf, etc.).  If this
is troublesome to anyone, or some process or another depended on it, let
me know and I can make it optional.  I just was tired of seeing all
those random directories appear.

Also, we can now set the envvar TL_EXTRA_CONF to pass extra flags to
configure, like turning off optimization with CFLAGS=-g, I hope.

Yes, but it seems to be safe at least for pdf_mem as this is only
indexed relative to its origin, so a move doesn't matter (if i didn't
miss/mess anything :-)

Lars and all,

I set up the ams(fonts) special case in Tpm.pm, fixed other assorted tpm
problems, and rebuilt the ISO images in
ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test/.  Please give it a try if you're so
inclined, although plenty more updates are coming.

Olaf checked in a bunch of web2c/etc. updates yesterday.  I think the
main code thing that's pending at this point is the pdftex release
... Martin, how is it looking?

Werner, Hirata said that they hope to make another dvipdfmx release
shortly for our sake.  Hopefully that'll come through too ...

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20050625.162717.194779804.wl@gnu.org>


kpathsea got a new variable, SFDFONTS, to hold the location of subfont
definition files.  This points to fonts/sfd, but currently there is
nothing.  Please move all *.sfd files from texmf/ttf2pk/ to either
texmf-dist/fonts/sfd/ttf2pk/ or texmf/fonts/sfd/ttf2pk/, whatever you
think is more appropriate.

Additionally, I suggest to replace
texmf/fonts/map/ttf2pk/config/ttfonts.map with
texmf/ttf2pk/ttfonts.map (the latter should be removed then), but with
most entries removed and just a few ones commented out as an example.

Message-ID: <20050625.185011.46214915.wl@gnu.org>


There are a lot of other embarassing errors!

tftopl reports the following for public/apl/cmapl10.tfm:

  There's some extra junk at the end of the TFM file,
  but I'll proceed as if it weren't there.
  Subfile sizes don't add up to the stated total!
  Sorry, but I can't go on; are you sure this is a TFM?

There are two files in TeXLive which shouldn't be there:

  tfm/public/ibycus/fibo.pl
  tfm/public/ibycus/fibr.pl

Extra junk have all files in tfm/public/cmcyr/cmcyr/,
tfm/public/sanskrit/, and some in tfm/public/wsuipa/.  Some files in
tfm/public/wnri have parentheses in strings.  Those files should be
regenerated IMHO.

For tfm/public/montex/bcghsb.tfm, I get this message:

  The file has fewer bytes than it claims!
  Sorry, but I can't go on; are you sure this is a TFM?

The same I get for almost all files in tfm/public/malayalam/.

Since there is always a possibility that the files on my hard disk are
corrupted I suggest that you run the command below in the tfm tree and
check the log file by yourself:

  for i in `find -type f`; do
    echo $i >> ~/tfm.log
    tftopl $i > /dev/null 2>> ~/tfm.log
  done

Maybe we should run similar tests with the PFB and TTF files...

This is really harmless, but similar to the EC fonts I suggest that

Hi Andrea,
You didn't tell if you are using Windows or Linux or whatever else.

I only can speak for Linux and BSD platforms where skt isn't readily
available as a binary. When using those platforms you have to compile
it and then best put the resulting binary into a directory which is in
your path.

If you are using TeXLive 2004 then you might find skt.c here: 
$ROOTDIR/texmf-dist/source/latex/sanskrit/skt.c where $ROOTDIR it the
directory where you installed TeXLive.

You easily create the binary like this: cc -o skt skt.c
and you could install it like this: install -s skt /usr/local/bin/skt
if /usr/local/bin is appropriate.

Hmm, I don't understand.  If have to, say, add a file to my CJK

be texmf-dist/tpm/CJK.tpm since it is created automatically.  What am

You mean that the mere existence of a single file in, say,
texmf-dist/tex/latex/foo, automatically makes it a package `foo'?  And
that consequently texmf-dist/doc/latex/foo is also packed into the
same bundle?  What else?  Now this should be *really* documented :-)

A follow-up: Is it possible to have packages which live in both texmf
and texmf-dist?  I assume that the answer is no, and that this must
become two packages, right?

Is it possible to have symlinks in the repository?  I have to create
hundreds of them (to get proper ToUnicode mapping files for CJK
subfonts) since pdfTeX and dvipdfmx need different names to access
them.

An alternative is to add entries to the `aliases' file, but I fear
that, similar to `special.map', there is no `addAliasMap' function...

Please advise.

try to avoid using the aliases file; it's a source of troubles

not quite. you create a skeleton TPM file for foo with the name, author,

then that skeleton is fleshed out by a file tree walk

Well, this is not an easy task.  Some explanation: Vladimir's cmap.sty
expects that a ToUnicode cmap file is called

  <fontencoding><subfont>.cmap

for example `c1017.cmap' (C10 is simplified Chinese in my CJK
package).  After creating a DVI file, this information is lost.  The
new dvipdfmx version (currently only in the CVS) checks whether for
font `foo' there exists a ToUnicode cmap `foo.cmap' and uses it if
found, which is quite natural.  Assuming that font foo is subfont `17'
of encoding `c10', the file foo.cmap should be a symbolic link to
`c1017.cmap'.

    space is cheap.

Well, it depends on how much space we are talking about.  We have
the continuing problem of the CD space limitation.

But in this case I imagine the files are small, so even hundreds of
duplicates is doable.  What's a bit of drag is maintaining the copies.

    font `foo' there exists a ToUnicode cmap `foo.cmap' 

If there was more structure in the name, perhaps the copies could be
avoided.  Eg, make the subfont names be things like c10-17.cmap.  Then
for a font name foo-bar, dvipdfmx can first try foo-bar.cmap, then (if
there is a dash in the name) try foo.cmap.

Or it could just try try stripping chars off one at a time, if changing
the names is not feasible: c1017.cmap, c101.map, c10.cmap.

Do pdftex and CJK play together or is that not an issue at this point?


P.S. Hirata just released another dvipdfmx tarball, I'll try to get it
in ASAP.

is there really a clash? dvipdfmx searches in the /texmf/font/(dvipdfmx) path 
while latex looks into its texinputs path which i suppose is /texmf/tex/latex

Subject: [tex-live] Upper Sorbian hyphenation patterns and other problems
Message-ID: <20050627.154948.55505072.wl@gnu.org>


The Upper Sorbian hyphenation patterns sorhyph.tex are problematic for
various reasons.

  . The copyright says

      % Non-commercial usage and usage in TeX-related programs only
      % Packaging with commercial stuff only with written permission
      % of the author

    I'm quite sure that the author is willing to change this into
    something more liberate.

  . There is no language.sor.dat.

  . It is part of the hyphen-german bundle which is bad IMHO.  While
    the area where Upper Sorbian is spoken (the Lausitz valley) is
    indeed in Germany, the language itself is a Slavic one and not
    related to German.

I suggest to create a separate `hyphen-usorbian' bundle.

BTW, checking the various hyphenation patterns in other bundles I see
that the following files don't have a proper .dat entry:

  hyphen-norwegian: nohyph1.tex
                    nohyph2.tex

Additionally I suggest the following:

  . Remove the files lahyph7.tex and lahyph8.tex since lahyph.tex is a
    merger of the former two files.

  . Remove ithyphen2.tex since it is an old version of ithyph.tex.

  . Move hyph_hu.dic into the doc tree (or remove it completely).

  . Move ghyph31.README and ghyphen.README into the doc tree.

  . Move bahyph.sh into the doc tree (or remove it completely).

Another problem is package hyphen-interlingua and hyphen-icelandic:
There is neither a file iahyphen.tex nor icehyph.tex!

Well, part of my CJK package are hyphenation pattern for toneless
pinyin (a Chinese transcription) together with a babel LDF file which
I would like to add to patterns for tex and friends.  This is, I have
to create a language.py.dat (`py' is not a reserved two-letter country
code, BTW).

Putting the pinyin stuff into a separate `hyphen-pinyin' bundle is not
difficult, but how shall I indicate that those files are part of the
CJK package in case CJK gets updated on CTAN?

The short answer is that you are entering unknown territory.
Unless someone steps forward who wants to work on the TPM
software, it'll remain a manual process.

Both are part of babel, at least according to a CTAN search.
icehyph.tex is LPPL 1.2 or later, while iahyphen doesn't seem to have a
license statement.

Thomas, you have iahyphen.tex in the tetex-texmfsrc tarball, but it is
not installed in tetex-texmf.  Do you know anything about its status?

Yes, they are.  When I updated babel a little while ago, I created these

I've written to the author listed in the file (Peter Kleiweg).

Please, anyone, when you see license problems, try to write the author.

Put requires into the tpm's.  At least that'll be a clue.

    The short answer is that you are entering unknown territory.
    Unless someone steps forward who wants to work on the TPM
    software, it'll remain a manual process.

Well, I have been working on it, since it's obvious that there is no
other "someone".  In Master/Tools there is now a script tpm-ctan-check
which does a very simple check of some of the packages in TL against
their incarnation on CTAN.  It is just in the beginning stages, and I'm
sure it won't handle a complex package like CJK without modification,
but it's a start.

Werner, my advice is, don't worry about this last step for CJK, unless
you really want to get involved in TL administration and overhead.  If
you split up the packages as you describe and make the initial TPM
files, that will already be doing more than 99% of the other authors.

Best,
karl

Generally speaking, any "package-level" directory foo is found by
Tpm.pm, so also texmf-dist/source/whatever/foo,
texmf-dist/fonts/whatever/whatever/foo, etc.  There are plenty of
special cases and built-in searching going on, though.  I don't know all
the rules and searches myself that Fabrice implemented, I just
investigate when there is a problem because of some new change.

    Apparently, it can't be texmf-dist/tpm/CJK.tpm since it is created
    automatically.

As I wrote a few days ago, the *file lists* in the tpm files are
maintained automatically, but not the other info.  So tpm's are still
initially created by hand, as Seb wrote.

As long as the new file is in a directory that is already included in
CJK.tpm, it should be fine.  If you create a new directory which has to
be included in CJK.tpm, that could require changes to Tpm.pm (always a
good thing to avoid).

I know, but I have experienced that it's generally worth asking people
who likely know more about this, or might have tried to contact him,
before mailing the author.  

If Thomas had answered "no idea", or simply not at all, I would have
done that sooner or later.

    Hello Johannes,

    I note that lahyph.tex as contained in babel is an outdated version. CTAN
    has a newer one. iahyphen.tex has no proper license.

    And, somewhat unrelated, ntgclass is broken. Have you ever tried
    something like
      \documentclass{rapport3}
      \begin{document}
      \end{document}
    with the current release of latex and ntgclass?

    And, even more unrelatred, did you get my mail about changebar.dtx +
    \pdfoutput.

    Well, if your file has been contributed to babel, it would make sense
    to release it under the same license as babel itself; the LaTeX Project
    Public License (lppl, see CTAN:macros/latex/base/lppl.txt).

    Thomas

Johannes has promissed to check the license of iahyphen.tex (01
Jun 2004). Vladimir Volovich has written a mail to "Peter Kleiweg
<kleiweg@let.rug.nl>" asking him to add a proper license to his file
(09 Jan 2005). A day later, Vladimir has written an email to
  To: babel@braams.cistron.nl, ctan@dante.de
  Cc: texlive@tug.org
where he notes that iahyphen.tex exists in two locations on CTAN and he
suggests that the copy in babel be removed.

The file iahyphen.tex is not listed in babel's manifest.txt, so I'll
just remove this file from teTeX.

Thanks for all those reports.

If Jorg updates the tfm's on CTAN, we will update them in TL.  I don't
think we should change them on TL alone.


Ditto for the other bad tfm's you found -- the maintainers need to
update them, IMHO.  Would you be able to make the reports, by any
chance?  (Although some of the files may be so old as not have
findable maintainers anymore, I think others are still active.)

(Except for Malayalam -- there's a new release of that which I have not
updated in TL yet.)

    Maybe we should run similar tests with the PFB and TTF files...

I'm sure that any systematic check of *anything* in TL will turn up lots
of discrepancies :(.

Edward,


to include your sorhyph.tex in the TeXLive distribution (and teTeX) we
need a license which isn't as restrictive as the current one you have
in the file:

  % Non-commercial usage and usage in TeX-related programs only
  % Packaging with commercial stuff only with written permission
  % of the author

What do you think about using the LPPL?  Can you update the file on
CTAN ASAP so that we can update it properly on the TeXLive CD?  The
deadline of the TeXLive freeze is the beginning of July.

This is not possible.

The very problem is that the LaTeX font encoding (and subfont
encoding) is lost in the DVI file where only font names survive.
While it makes sense for some special case to deduce the font encoding
from the font name, it will always be an educated guess.

This won't work either.

There is no clash, but for the sake of maintainability it would be
good to share the data.  Vladimir's cmap.sty is very special since it
basically adds data directly from the texmf/font tree (namely, cmap
files) to a pdftex document.  I'm not sure how to set up this
correctly in TeXLive.  Ideally, the following link should be done:

  texmf-dist/fonts/cmap/fontenc -> texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmap/data

and the currently available five cmap files (t1.cmap and friends)
should be moved to fonts/cmap/fontenc.

On Unix hosts, it would be good to have post-actions to create the
link, and for Windows hosts the files should be simply copied.  Maybe
a script `check-cmap-hierarchy' could be run after calling installing
or removing packages in the TeXLive system which takes care of
linking/copying?

Note that the link setup between the `fonts' and `tex' trees is
something in addition to what I want to do.  For example, for the two
traditional Chinese fonts bmsilp and bkaimp (the former is in TeXLive)
I need this:

  fonts/cmap/bmsilp/bmsilp01.cmap <- fonts/cmap/fontenc/c0001.cmap
  fonts/cmap/bmsilp/bmsilp02.cmap <- fonts/cmap/fontenc/c0002.cmap
  ...

  fonts/cmap/bkaimp/bkaimp01.cmap <- fonts/cmap/fontenc/c0001.cmap
  fonts/cmap/bkaimp/bkaimp02.cmap <- fonts/cmap/fontenc/c0002.cmap
  ...

bsmilp01.cmap and siblings are needed for dvipdfmx, and c0001.cmap and
siblings are needed by cmap.sty.

Files c0001.cmap and friends would be directly part of my CJK package,
while bmsilp01.cmap and friends should be created by a post-action
(either by linking or copying) in the bmsilp font package.

i tend to keep this kind of code (like additional pdftex specific cmap code) in 
tex files since one never knows how shared data may change to less sharable data 
and  then changes may go unnoticed

I think we owe an explanation *why* this license is too restrictive.
The problem is that free TeX systems like TeXLive (or Linux
distributions with teTeX) often *do* get sold.  Even if there is just a
TeXLive CD as an add-on to a book about TeX, for a lawyer this means
selling TeXLive, and thus selling any file in it.  Similarly, if
Lehmann's offer a TeXLive CD with their name on it for what is hardly
more than the cost of distribution, it is still commercial.

Therefore, in order to be able to distribute the file with TeX systems,
the restriction on non-commercial uage must be dropped.

The second restriction, TeX-related, is problematic, too:  First of all,
it is quite hard to define.  Furthermore, I personally don't see why it
shouldn't be used in other Free Software, e.g. in competitors like lout
or OpenOffice.

> What do you think about using the LPPL?

I would also suggest that, either the current version (1.3a) or "version
1.3a or later".

Many thanks in advance,
Frank

Ok, I'll go the brute-force method of not sharing any CMAP files,
neither between cmap.sty and dvipdfmx, nor with the fonts themselves.

maybe cmap.sty can output some \special which will say that some font
corresponds to such and such cmap file, and then dvipdfmx can use this
info? then all the symlinks for font.cmap will not be needed.

Does this imply that you have something newer?  BTW, it would be great
if you add some usage instructions to the pattern file, for example,
which font encoding you expect.

Can you upload something to CTAN, please?  We try to avoid differences
between TeXLive and CTAN as much as possible.

The hyphenation patterns for OO are based on this.

      . Remove the files lahyph7.tex and lahyph8.tex since lahyph.tex is a
        merger of the former two files.
Done.

      . Remove ithyphen2.tex since it is an old version of ithyph.tex.
Done.

      . Move hyph_hu.dic into the doc tree (or remove it completely).
Done.

      . Move ghyph31.README and ghyphen.README into the doc tree.

I delete ghyph31.README since it was a symlink.  I am reluctant to make
a whole new doc directory for ghyphen.README, although admittedly that's
where it theoretically belongs.  I can't imagine that anyone looking for
the file would find it there instead of right next to ghyphen.tex in the
first place.  So I left it.  I don't see that it does any harm.

      . Move bahyph.sh into the doc tree (or remove it completely).

Ditto, left this one too.

Thanks,

Subject: [tex-live] Norwegian hyphenation patterns status
Message-ID: <200506281258.j5SCwTI14929@f7.net>

Hi folks,

The situation with Norwegian hyphenation patterns appears to be fairly
confused (not unusual :().

On CTAN there are three files matching "nohyph", all in language/hyphenation:

1) CTAN:nohyph.tex -- by Preben Randhol (hi Preben), Frank Jensen, Ivar
   Aavatsmark (hi Ivar), and others. changed by te to use characters
   instead of macros.  This file reports itself as nohyphen.tex, circa 1994.
2) CTAN:nohyph2.tex -- by L. Thoresen and D.F. Langmyhr (hi Dag), uses
   real 8-bit characters and has catcode statements.
3) CTAN:nohyphbx.tex -- by Rune Kleveland and Ole Michael Selberg (hi hi),
   circa 2005, a much much larger set of patterns.

Ok, so that makes some kind of sense.  But now, in TL we have the
following (all in texmf/tex/generic/hyphen):

4) TL:nohyph.tex -- appears to be an updating of #1.  Same patterns, but
   has a different misspelling of "substituted", a different address for
   te, and a \begingroup ... \endgroup around the definitions.
5) TL:nohyph1.tex -- appears to be Ivar's original file, from 1992.
   Uses cathyph.tex.  I expect it should just be deleted.
6) TL:nohyph2.tex -- almost the same as #4, the only difference is in
   te's email address.  I expect it should be deleted too.

I did not see a copyright/license statement of any kind in any of the
files :(.

So perhaps what we should do is something like this:

1) fix the spelling of "substituted" in #4, include a license statement
   if we can, and update nohyph.tex on CTAN.  Preben, Ivar?

2) Include a license statement in nohyphbx (#3) if we can, and put that
   in TL with a language.nobx.dat (I guess) file so it can actually be
   used as an alternative.  Rune, Ole?

3) Don't know if nohyph2.tex should be included as an alternative set of
   patterns or not.  Dag?

4) delete #5 and #6.


Any information or instructions would be welcome ...

Thanks,
karl

Message-ID: <200506281258.j5SCwTb14987@f7.net>

    kpathsea got a new variable, SFDFONTS, to hold the location of subfont
    definition files.  

But will ttf2pk use it for searching?  Do you co-maintain ttf2pk these
days?  I see your name at the end of the README, which seems like good
news :).  Except there is also something called ttfutils.  I am confused
...

    This points to fonts/sfd, but currently there is nothing.  Please
    move all *.sfd files from texmf/ttf2pk/ to either
    texmf-dist/fonts/sfd/ttf2pk/ or texmf/fonts/sfd/ttf2pk/, whatever
    you think is more appropriate.

Well, I guess those .sfd's come from the ttf2pk distribution, so texmf/
seems like the right place.  

    Additionally, I suggest to replace
    texmf/fonts/map/ttf2pk/config/ttfonts.map with
    texmf/ttf2pk/ttfonts.map (the latter should be removed then), 

Again, where does ttf2pk actually search for ttfonts.map?
Does it know about TEXFONTMAPS, etc.?

    but with most entries removed and just a few ones commented out as
    an example.

Well, config/ttfonts.map is empty, so clearly that's pretty useless.
(The config/ subdir also seems wrong, but skip that.)
ttf2pk/ttfonts.map has only a few entries already, so I'm not sure what
you're really proposing.  I'd guess you know more about what will work
than anyone else, certainly more than me anyway, so can you just do the
right thing?  (Ah, I see you already did.  Cool.)

Thanks,
k

Indeed, dvipdfmx hasa `ToUnicode' special, but it isn't documented.
I've just sent a request to the dvipdfmx list, asking for help.

Hi Cherry,

    I have installed TexLive 7

FYI, TL 7 is from 2002.  You might want to grab TL 2004, or protext
(http://tug.org/protext).

    ! I can't find file `prepictex.tex'.

That file (and the others) did exist in the 2002 release.  They are in
the directory texmf/tex/generic/pictex -- maybe the pictex package was
not installed?  I recommend choosing "install all packages" ...

                  Also, what has happened to TEXINPUTS and BIBINPUTS?  

They still exist.

    Where can I put files that I want to inputs, apart from in the
    current directory?

If you have a Windows environment variable $HOME defined, I think it
will work to create a directory $HOME/texmf, with subdirectories tex and
bibtex, and put your tex and bib files there.

Another possibility is to use the TEXMFLOCAL hierarchy, as discussed in
the documentation (I hope).

Hope this helps,
karl

none of the x-specials is documented; one has to reverse engineer the c code -)

I tried that without success, and it would take a longer time to

> The situation with Norwegian hyphenation patterns appears to be fairly

I have exchanged a lot of mails in January (this year) with Ole Michael
Selberg (author of nohyphbx.tex) about it.

nohyphbx.tex is GPL. I did get a version of this file from the author with
the following header:

    % (runekl@math.uio.no) from dictionaries available from
    % http://www.uio.no:/~runekl/dictionary.html.
    %
    % Adjusted manually by Ole Michael Selberg to prevent
    % numerous wrong hyphenations, especially in compounds.
    % Last changes: December 19, 2004.
    % License type: Free. GPL
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    % Supplementary information (in Norwegian):
    % http://home.c2i.net/omselberg/pub/nohyphbx_intro.htm

However, the next version from the author (which is now on CTAN, I think)
did not have the GPL statement any more.

Back in January, he wrote to me:
    The hyphenation patterns in nohyphbx.tex (the file I downloaded today)
    are a manually adjusted and extended version of Runar Kleveland's
    nohyhb.tex (which was a tremendous improvement on nohyph.tex and
    nohyph2.tex).  Certain patterns have been removed and about seven
    hundred have been added, so that the file now contains 26761 patterns
    versus 26017 in nohyph.tex.

    Having used Kleveland's patterns for some time to typeset my own
    translations of Polish and German fiction, I noticed that despite
    their generally very satisfactory performance they still produced a
    number of erroneous hyphenations. That's when I started to improve
    the patterns manually, which isn't as difficult as it seems. A
    fair number of the corrected mishyphenations are listed in the file
    http://home.c2i.net/omselberg/pub/korrigerte_delinger.htm.

    The supplementary information in the file referred to in the preamble
    (http://home.c2i.net/omselberg/pub/nohyphbx_intro.htm) is provided
    only in Norwegian (if you don't know Norwegian, you problably won't
    need to acquaint yourself with it). This file contains a link
    to another file in which the hyphenation rules of Norwegian are
    explained and commented on.

That sounds like a good thing. teTeX-3.0 also shipps with this file and
it is enabled in language.dat.

    Is it intentional that the linux i386 binary of dvipdfmx isn't linked
    with zlib

I've just submitted a new dvipdfmx binary, updated to the 20050627
release which Hirata just made (some details below).  It is linked with
libz, although I don't know how to tell directly if a PDF is compressed
or not.  There's plenty of binary in the output from story.dvi, at
least.

Hope this will work for your CJK stuff, let me know if problems or if
something else needs to be done.

One change I noticed is that they now default to outputting pdf 1.4,
instead of 1.3, for alpha channel stuff:
%% PDF (minor) version stamp to use in output file.
%% This also implies maximal version of PDF file allowed to be included.
%% Dvipdfmx does not support 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 since TrueType font embedded
%% as CIDFontType2 requires at least version 1.3. Transparent imaging
%% model requires version 1.4. So if you want soft-masking support for
%% PNG image with alpha channels, you should set version to 4 or higher.

I'm guessing we should stick with 1.4 (although I hate pdf versions).
More informed opinions welcome :).

Bug Fixes:

  * Important fix for PK font creation: 2005-05-04
  * Important fix for metapost output PS handling:
    2005-03-05
  * Fixes in PDF import: fixes for SEGV error and for
    double-free problem in treating corrupt PDF file.
    ChangeLog entry 2005-05-04.

Others:

  * Fallback to old path search behaviour: 2005-06-09
    Dvipdfmx's install script does not install map files
    (and others) in proper locations (for TDS 1.1). So,
    I made dvipdfmx to search old install locations too,
    as a workaround.
  * pdf:literal (without 'direct') seems not working
    as expected. I've changed to always enclose
    pdf:literal with 'q' and 'Q' so that it does not
    affect subsequent DVI interpretion. (INCOMPATIBLE)
  * Fixes for color special handling: ChangeLog entry
    2005-03-07 and 2005-05-07. Still there are bugs.
  * Removed HAVE_KPSE_XXX_FORMAT macros, instead use
    simpler __TDS_VERSION__.
  * Removed undocumented/experimental features:
    2005-06-26.

Doing `dvipdfmx -z9' using the binary from change 7308 I still get

  ** ERROR ** You don't have compression compiled in.
              Possibly libz wasn't found by configure.

Is there a specific reason why this is set to `a' by default, except
that in the old times people were friendly and peaceful ;-)?

Message-ID: <20050629.093132.205774096.wl@gnu.org>


Apostolos,


I've just stumbled across glyph name problems with Type 1 versions of
the cbgreek fonts (in the type1.tar.gz bundle on CTAN, and
consequently in the current TeXLive repository).

Note that I haven't tested all fonts; I just report the very problems
I've encountered.

  . grxn1000.pfb has completely wrong glyph names!  Instead of Greek
    ones you have glyph names appropriate for an EC font.  Looking
    into some more fonts it seems that many others have exactly the
    same problem.

  . grmn1000.pfb has Greek glyph names, but many of them don't follow
    the Adobe Glyph List (AGL).  For example, the lambda glyph is
    incorrectly called `lamda' (a typo?), or `sigmafinal' has the
    wrong name `finalsigma'.

Today, with the widespread use of PDFs, it is of great importance to
have correct glyph names so that the ToUnicode feature works
correctly, enabling cut and paste from a PDF document into other
documents.

Are there plans to fix this?

you can try compression by playing with

   dvipdfmx -z ...

open the pdf file in an editor and see what happens to streams (each page has a 
content stream); file size should be affected as well

sure, but if we start assuming that kind of tex usage we're lost anyway; just as 
i don't open those 'watch this nice jpg picture' i will not run a tex file from 
someone i don't know (unless posted on a mailing list, but then i look into teh 
file anyway); the tex file suffix is more likely bound to editing than to 
processing

setting it to anything else can be a pain for users; apart from many messages, 
files are not seen; (keep in mind that the main audience for tex live is users 
who just want to use tex, not to hack config files)

those who run tex in web apps can take care of themselves and tweak the config 
file; they may want to isolate tex in more ways than only opening files; (the 
average unix box is set up so that users can read lots of files and i see no 
reason to make tex more restrictive);

I just wonder whether it makes sense to reduce the number of included
cbgreek Type 1 fonts in a similar way as it have been done with
cm-super.  Currently there are 233 files which need 19.1MByte.
Removing all files but the g*1000.pfb fonts we only have 1.8MByte in
22 files.  Since the fonts follow the EC font naming scheme,
Vladimir's type1ec.sty file works just fine.

Message-ID: <20050629.160011.182611385.wl@gnu.org>


Apostolos,


the character widths in grxn1000.tfm differ enormously from the
advance widths in grxn1000.pfb!  Take, for example, the character
`alpha' -- this corresponds to glyph name `a' in the Type 1 font.
t1disasm gives

  /a {
      48 575 hsbw
      -5 96 hstem
      355 97 hstem
      1 53 vstem
      ...

and tftopl yields

  (CHARACTER C a
     (CHARWD R 0.6553955)
     (CHARHT R 0.444336)
     ...

As you can see we have 575 PS units in the the Type 1 file and
0.655*1000=655 units.  Even if we convert TeX points to PS points, the
difference is far too large.  Compare this with grmn1000 which has
correct widths:

  /alpha {
      42 500 hsbw
      -11 64 hstem
      0 25 vstem
      307 104 rmoveto
      ...

  (CHARACTER C a
     (CHARWD R 0.499878)
     (CHARHT R 0.43045)
     ...

Most drivers like xdvi or dvips use the width values from the TFM
file, while dvipdfmx apparently doesn't do this.  This is the very
reason why I've noticed this problem.

I don't know how many other cb fonts are affected...

I for one wouldn't mind reducing it further to just the 10pt sizes,
especially if it turns out we need the space at the end, but I have to
follow up with the code-related packages (dvipdfmx, dvipng, xpdfopen)
right now.  If you or anyone feels like cutting it down, please do :).

    Since the fonts follow the EC font naming scheme,
    Vladimir's type1ec.sty file works just fine.

That is very good to know.

Thanks,
Karl

some wsuipa TFM files are corrupted.  tftopl reports `extra junk' at

Uh, oh, this no longer works, and he seems to have `retired' (as my

  See http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/typeforum/unicodegn.html

and search for `glyphlist.txt'.

In the TeXLive data trees you can find it three times:

  texmf-dist/doc/generic/t2/glyphlist.txt
  texmf/dvipdfm/CMap/glyphlist.txt
  texmf/lcdftools/glyphlist.txt

>From those, the most useful list is probably the version in

The version of glyphlist.txt texmf-dist/doc/generic/t2/ is old
and should probably be updated.

If you use type1ec.sty, it's a non-trivial operation for Joe User to
actually avoid that only the g*1000 fonts are used.  With other words,
users who want to process T1 encoding with cm-super PS fonts from
TeXLive together with Greek normally do this

  \usepackage{type1ec}
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage[greek, USenglish]{babel}

and will never need more than the mentioned 22 cbgreek fonts.

Hi Dag,

Thanks much for the reply.

    If Ole can deliver a set of patterns he is satisfied with, 

Happily, he has already done so.  He has extended and fixed Rune's
original automated set considerably.

Also happily, Ole just wrote me in private email that he is happy for an
explicit GPL or other free license statement to be inserted, and gave me
the ok to upload that to CTAN.  So I'll do that later today.

     included as the only Norwegian patterns

Do you think backward compatibility is a concern?  That is, is there a
body of LaTeX documents using the prior nohyph Norwegian patterns which
would get different output if retypeset with the new patterns?

TL has only ever included nohyph.tex.  I'm not sure about previous
versions of teTeX (I know it uses nohyphbx now).

    My files (nohyph2.tex) were created before the concept of a licence was 
    common. I have no problems with a GPL licence.

Perhaps it would be good to upload a nohyph2.tex with a free license and
a note about nohyphbx.tex to CTAN (while we're thinking about it), or
else to remove it if you think the confusion isn't worthwhile.

    list of hyphenated words was not public. 

Virtually all the hyphenation pattern files, including Knuth's, were
prepared from non-free word lists.  (Perhaps the patterns you made with
your student are an exception. :) So although I can imagine a legal
argument that we are in trouble, in practice I see no way we can worry
(or do anything) about this.

Thanks again,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] Lots of configure files updated.
Message-ID: <87r7el819y.fsf@infovore.xs4all.nl>

The changes I've just checked in touch many files: kpathsea and web2c
are in sync now with my source tree.  One last change I can see there
is a minor mod to kpathsea/NEWS and web2c/NEWS, to include a date for
3.5.5/7.5.5.  I want to postpone that until after there's been some
shakeout of the texlive trees.

I've bundled the autoconf2.13 script from my build machine in the texk
directory, so you can get the configure scripts rebuilt without having
autoconf2.13 itself installed.  The rules in texk/make/config.mk use
the bundled script now.

Another change in this area is that I've applied some patches from
Peter Breitenlohner that make the autoconf scripts use a syntax that
is compatible with autoconf2.5x, making migration easier.  However,
certain files that would be necessary to run with autoconf2.5x are not
present, so the switchover itself cannot be made yet.  This is
deliberate.  Also note that Peter's patches were based on the teTeX
3.0 source tree, so not all sources in the TeX-live tree were updated.

To simplify updating the configure scripts, I've included a
reautoconf.texk in the top level.  Based on Peter's original (which
was inspired by teTeX's version, IIRC) I modified it to use the
bundled autoconf2.13 and to call /usr/bin/autoconf2.50 for those cases
where we know this version should be used.  Certain other trees are
not regenerated at all, in particular nothing under utils.

With the exception of dvipng (noted in another mail) everything seems
to configure and build fine at this point, though there are some
updmap complaints at the very end (vnr.map not found).

Note that at present reautoconf.texk assumes autoconf2.5x should be
used for dvipng.  This might have to be changed, depending on how you
implement the mesh with kpathsea...

Note that the autoconf stuff now prefers kpse_include over ac_include,
though it accepts both.

It is, and I hope things can now be settled. I am very glad you brought

These are the first Norwegian patterns. They were manually created (i.e., 
not using `patgen?) by Ivar so they are difficult to maintain. Also, they 
hyphenate according to the pre-1973 rules. My opinion is that this set of 
patterns should be omitted from future TeX distributions.

These were made by a student and me.

An improvement, but I had the impression that list of hyphenated words was 
not public. Also, I did not know that Ole was involved.

My files (nohyph2.tex) were created before the concept of a licence was

I think that Rune's nohyphbx effort is the best so far, particularly if 
Ole can improve it. If Ole can deliver a set of patterns he is satisfied 
with, I suggest that these patterns should be declared "official" in some 
sense and included as the only Norwegian patterns (provided they can be 
given a suitable licence).

I am very happy that Ole has joined the project -- it needs someone with a 
linguistic background. (There exists no official hyphenation dictionary in 
Norway, only a set of vague and sometimes contradictory rules.)

If I can help Ole in this effort, please tell me. I can also offer disk 
space in connection with the NTUG web site.

There are (at least) two problems: first I do not really know where to
get this AGL, and second there are glyphs included in the CB fonts that
haven't found their way into Unicode (or at least that is what I

I suggest to move

to

  texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname

The main reason is that these files are not specific to dvips but are
mainly used by scripts to construct directory locations for PK and TFM
files.

Objections?  Since those files aren't directly used by drivers I don't
see a possible clash.

At least the lcdftools programs and dvipdfmx need Adobe's
glyphlist.txt at run-time.  For good cooperation with TeX fonts it is
necessary to extend this file, namely, to add a bunch of glyph names
which are used in already existing TeX fonts.

This raises two problems.

  . It is a waste of space to have multiple instances of
    glyphlist.txt.  For instance, this file can be currently found
    five times on TeXLive (three times in the texmf trees, two times
    in the source tree), and at least one version is out of date.

  . I consider it problematic to touch the original file.  It makes it
    more difficult to update to a newer version, and to maintain
    extensions to it.

I suggest the following -- not for this TeXLive distribution, but for
the next one due to our proposed deadline.

  . Put the unmodified glyphlist.txt file into

      texmf-dist/fonts/map/AGL

    Consequently, use the TEXFONTMAPS variable to locate it.

  . Put extensions to this file into, say,

      texmf-dist/fonts/map/AGL/glyphlist.ext

  . Modify all programs which need this data to first read
    glyphlist.txt, then glyphlist.ext.

  . Make all programs accept the slightly extended format as
    implemented in lcdftools to provide more than a single mapping:

      <glyphname>;<mapping1>[;<mapping2>;...]

    Example:

      Delta;2206;0394

I work for one of the more prestigious universities around, in
a Computing Service. You'd thnk we had good kit.
Last week I came back with a copy
of Solaris 10 on a DVD. I tried it on 4 machines in succession
around the office. Did it work on any of them? no.

    I suggest to move

      texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/fontname

    to

      texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname

Sounds reasonable.  I did it.  Thanks.

Message-ID: <17092.25341.173263.835735@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
because we do not have an INSTALL file which explains how to install
VnTeX on all platforms yet, we decided to prepare a special release
for TeX Live 2005.

The INSTALL file shouldn't go into the TeX Live distribution anyway.

Another difference from the final release is that files had been
removed which are part of other packages provided by TeX Live.

You can download this release from

    http://vntex.sourceforge.net/vntex-3.0-TL2005

If you have any problems, let me know.

Regards,
  Reinhard
