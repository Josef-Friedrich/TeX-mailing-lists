    Shall I do it?  More opinions, please.

Surely cm-super is used by far more people than cbgreek.  Since we
already slashed cm-super, I see no particular reason not to do the same
for cbgreek.  I don't recall any huge reason why Hans and I chose the
partial cut-down last year, basically just because that freed up enough
space, I think.

Just be sure to hack the map files to remove all the no-longer-available
fonts.  

The annoying part of having to do these cut-down things is that it
becomes very difficult to automate updates.  With cbgreek last year and
cm-super this year, I didn't try ...

After Olaf's latest updates (I guess it was), xdvik failed to build for

uint32_t in stdint.h.  

Turns out this is because the old autoconf we are using does not look in
stdint.h for the type, so was considering it unsigned, so did a #define
of uint32_t to unsigned long.

I changed our acgeneral.m4 to look in stdint.h if stdint.h is present --

I popped in Thomas's configure.in and Makefile.in and did a simple

have not even checked to see which of them are out of date, but I'm sure
it will be a time-consuming process to update them.  I've already been

I've updated cbgreek.map -- any other place?

BTW, it is very important IMHO to inform users that they have to use
type1ec.sty in case they want outlines only for EC, FC, Russian, and
Greek fonts.  Has this already been done on prominent places of the

Due to the many problems I've found recently within TeXLive (and
fontforge), and which have to be fixed first, I have a delay of about
a week w.r.t. the planned deadline of the end of June.

So I ask for some more days to check in a new version of my CJK
package together with updated CJK and Thai fonts (which will be
smaller, and most of them will contain AGL compliant glyph names)

Is this OK?  I'll start after the weekend.

Have you tried filing a bug report or feature request?  It is not like

I'd ask for a week for the purpose of preview-latex/AUCTeX/preview.sty
as well: we are currently in the process of getting the latest AUCTeX,
11.80, out.  It comes with preview-latex included, so there will not
be a separate preview-latex package anymore.  In preview.sty there
have been a number of fixes of various importance, and AUCTeX has
improved quite a bit (and there have been changes in supporting new
features of the beamer class and several other things that would make
it a better match with the current TeXlive release).

It also features some installation modes that make it a better
candidate for inclusion in precompiled/prepackaged Emacs variants, and
it is pretty much what Fabrice uses in XEmTeX, in the current CVS
version.

The AUCTeX release is more or less planned for this weekend.  The
release has received quite a bit of testing in its core code, but
since it is a major new release, it is not unlikely that within a week
or two trailing, there might be one or two bug fix releases which,
however, should not affect any build scripts and should be just
drop-in replacements for 11.80.

Missing pieces currently are mostly RPM spec files which should hardly
be relevant for TeXlive, so the current CVS should be fine for
checking out what changes are needed compared to 11.55.

indeed, kind of mid-way solution; also, the further gain in space was not that 
large; for cmsuper going 10pt was the only reasonable option to downsize.

[btw, if in the end we can move greek and cyrillic into latin modern we can get 
rid of much more]

My redistribution of TL/teTeX gives the user a choice between TL  
2003, 2004 and 2005 (devel). All so far have been compiled with gcc2  
on Mac OS X 10.2 (for backward compatibility).

I have been testing compilation of TL on Mac OS X 10.4 with gcc 4  
(and gcc 3.3) but while the source.development from  
@2005/05/16:09:30:00 (my current 2005 snapshot) compiles fine (and so  
does source.development from @2004/11/13:13:00:00, my 2004 base), the  
source @2003/09/23:21:00:00 does not compile with gcc-3.3 or gcc4. I  
get:

if g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include    -g -O2 -MT  
error.o -MD -MP -MF ".deps/error.Tpo" \
   -c -o error.o `test -f 'error.cc' || echo './'`error.cc; \
then mv -f ".deps/error.Tpo" ".deps/error.Po"; \

../include/lcdf/hashmap.hh:109: error: '_pos' was not declared in

I'd like to be able to keep providing this older version as an  
option. Any clue what I need to do to get this compiled with gcc3+?

hashmap.hh is unchanged between source and source.development, so I

probably answer easier than anyone else.  Or keep compiling the old

No problem.  The main thing we were trying to freeze today is the
(compiled) code.

(And it looks like that's not quite the case, since pdftex isn't quite
released ... Martin, or anyone?)

I hope to add the xpdfopen package today, barring more configure
madness, and then maybe we can start trying some builds on the different
platforms to shake out the inevitable problems.

Package updates will continue for a while yet.  For one thing, last I
heard there was going to be some big update of Latin Modern which isn't
in yet (Hans, Staszek?).

FYI ...

Thanks to Taco H, his pdfopen/pdfclose utility is now in TeX Live.  It
uses Automake.  Astoundingly, I had to make no, as in zero, changes to
get it to work.  It requires only system and X libraries, not kpathsea
or anything else (thankfully).

Hopefully it will compile ok on the other platforms.

I hand-hacked the list of subdirs in the TeX/configure script, since I
did not feel up to attempting to regenerate it.  I did make the changes
in configure.in and withenable.ac, though, so whenever it does get
regenerated it should still be included in the build.

A week at most. We'll have rc2 today.

Note that I currently don't have access to p4, so someone else
must check the next rc against changes in web2c etc. and update
p4 with the release later.

On the sizes of the tfm files:

I generated them on OpenVMS. The most widely TeX implementation on VMS 
(DECUS TeX) required the tfm file size to be a multiple of 256, therefore 
VMS METAFONT pads the tfm files with the canoncical end bytes. That's the 
reason why the tfm files on UNIX or Windows systems are usually shorter.

I will not change this feature since it does not harm other users.

I consider correcting the font encoding scheme (I wonder why METAFONT 
generates happily tfm files which are BAD by the standards of tftopl).

Yours,

Hi Werner,

This seems reasonable.  I've updated my sources to install a base glyphlist.txt 
and an extension file, texglyphlist.txt  (note the name).  The files are found 
with kpathsea's kpse_fontmap_format.

fyi: pdfopen and pdfclose have been part of the windows fptex distribution for 
ages; it was never picked up for other platforms until taco did the translation 
(because texexec uses it); so, make sure that you don't overwrite existing 
windows versions;

I assume you're talking about the Debian packages?
(They are still very raw, by the way.)

There seems to be a texlive-latex package in
http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/binary.  By coincidence (?), we just
received a bug report that the instructions in
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html were bad.
The line to be modified in /etc/apt/sources.list must be 

   deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/binary/

(There was a space instead of a slash.)

If that's not it, I don't know, hopefully someone else can help.

Best,
Karl

Hi Karl,

Less than a month ago, we talked about getting lcdf-typetools to find 
glyphlist.txt using kpathsea; and version 2.34 does this, looking in 
$TEXMF/lcdftools//.  Werner Lemberg recently sent me mail, included below, about 
this.  I agree with his arguments, so version 2.35 will split glyphlist.txt into 
glyphlist.txt and texglyphlist.txt, and search for both files using 
kpse_fontmap_format.  Does this make sense to you?  Should I stick the files 
somewhere else?

Is there a way to disable this for a run, i.e. to get the

Just specify -translate-file=something on the command line, I think.

I guess we need to create an ascii.tcx.  Somehow I thought there was
already a way to do it, but it's not coming to me.

Maybe you can add a sentence to the README file to inform the users
about this feature.

Don't blame metafont!  While tftopl.web explicitly says that
`parentheses should not appear in this name' (this is, in the font
encoding scheme), Metafont simply uses the data from the `headerbyte'
command, without checking, and this command does appear neither in
plain.mf nor in cmbase.mf.

It is a problem of `modes.mf' which doesn't contain a proper character
check in function BCPL_string().  Karl, can you fix this?

Somehow I missed the original report.  The EC fonts have parentheses in
the coding scheme strings?
    
    It is a problem of `modes.mf' which doesn't contain a proper character
    check in function BCPL_string().  Karl, can you fix this?

Well, I'm not sure that modes.mf is the right place to fix this either,
what if it's not loaded?  But I suppose in practice it is.  I wonder
about changing tftopl in the first place?  But I guess that might be
more work than it's worth.

Anyway, I don't mind including the check in modes.mf, but it's been too
long, I can't write it out of my head and can't make it a priority.  So
if you or anyone wants to send a patch, I'll release it, otherwise,
it's been this way for so many years ...

Also, what is it going do?  Change parens to brackets or something,
with a warning?  Giving an error message doesn't seem right.

Thanks,

Sure.

    Should I stick the files somewhere else?

1) we should hear from the dvipdfmx folks that they agree, too, so that

2) I think your GNU-style install process should just use pkgdatadir or

Then those fields aren't set at all in the TFM file.

This was my first reaction too.

Well, it simply means removing the parentheses check which has no use
today.  Probably the simplest solution.  Olaf?

Changing `(' and `)' to `/', as it is done with pltotf.

It does here also. I didn't actually test with an empty file but
with no file (i.e. --translate-file=""). An empty file works.

Both is not true. Jan-?ke knows what I have done and he has even
supported this in the sense that if he had changed something, he has
given advice for me to follow this in autoconf-2.13.

Basically, it was not so easy to merge our autoconf stuff, because:
  - my stuff supports uninstalled libraries (kpathsea, libpng etc),
    making assumptions about certain features (standard autoconf checks
    don't work for uninstalled stuff)
  - my stuff was based on autoconf-2.13, his on autoconf-2.5x

Hopefully, things will improve with Peter's patches (which allow us to
use autoconf-2.5x in texk).

Hi list, I'm investigating the possibility to make pdfopen (aka pdfdde) 
a part of the MiKTeX distribution.  pdfopen (at least the Windows 
version) is (C) Adobe.  The "Acrobat(r) Plug-ins software development 
kit license" applies here.  I tried to get more info about this license. 
Without success.  It seems that you have to become an ASN developer 
(i.e., pay $195) before you can download the pdfdde sources.  To make it 
short: am I allowed to
- fetch the pdfdde sources (from the TL source depot)
- compile and distribute pdfdde.exe?
The README in TeX/texk/contrib doesn't tell.

Thanks,
Christian

So it seems.  I can't find any explicit definition of that license
either, but nothing on the Adobe site would imply it's free, quite the
contrary, as you reported.

It seems we will have to delete it from TL :(.

it's probably the same as with the microsoft windows libraries; you may ship 
those with your apps; those have been around for ages (without source code); 
don't we have some contact person at adobe who can verify things?

    it's probably the same as with the microsoft windows libraries; 

Unfortunately, according to the Adobe web pages, it is not the same.
They allow use of the code only in very restricted circumstances, and
don't allow modification at all.

The MS libraries fall under the "system exception" stuff.  This source
code doesn't. 

    don't we have some contact person at adobe who can verify things?

I have never talked to anyone at Adobe, but you did :).

Message-ID: <17097.50743.324419.558609@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
at the moment I'm writing an INSTALL file for vntex.  It is 
supposed to be used by people who want to install vntex on a system
which doesn't provide vntex-3.0 yet (for instance TL-2004).

I assume that it's best to put everything into a separate directory,
say $HOME/texmf-vntex or /usr/local/share/texmf-vntex or c:\texmf-vntex.

The reason is that they want to remove this directory if they upgrade
their TeX distribution.

I want to keep things as easy as possible.

The easiest way is to set TEXINPUTS and make use of the colon which
expands to the original value of TEXINPUTS, for instance

   TEXINPUTS=$HOME/texmf-vntex:  or  TEXINPUTS=c:\texmf-vntex:

This should work under Windows, the kpathsea manual says that colons
are expanded if they are either the first or the last character of the
string.

Can anyone confirm that "TEXINPUTS=c:\texmf-vntex:" works under
Windows?  I can't test it.

Thanh provided tfm files for the Microsoft core fonts (Arial,
Verdana...).  It would be nice if TTFONTS can point to
c:\windows\fonts but `colon expansion' cannot be used with the
variable TTFONTS.  It seems that it works with TEXINPUTS only.

Is there a way to set an environment variable under Windows so that
TrueType fonts are found under c:\texmf-vntex *AND* the original value
of TTFONTS?

Another solution would be to convince people to create their own
texmf.cnf and set TEXMFCNF appropriately, but I fear that I then have
to explain too much.  It seems that `colon expansion' doesn't work
there.

Any ideas?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard (and Thanh and Werner),

        http://vntex.sourceforge.net/vntex-3.0-TL2005

Thank you very much for preparing this.  Barring mistakes with p4, I
think I've just updated all those files (including creating a new
vnextra package).

    If you have any problems, let me know.

The only problem I see is are the vnextra files for tex4ht.  Can you
send those to Eitan so that he can include them in his distribution?
Otherwise when we update tex4ht it will be a pain to preserve them,
since otherwise it is a "simple" copy of his ht-fonts directories to
ours.

Best,
Karl

If you mean puting everything in texmf-vntex, just follow tds below
that directory and add texmf-vntex to $TEXMF before TEXMFMAIN and 
TEXMFDIST.

No, it doesn't work (because of a colon in c:, but I'm not sure that,
just failed for me: set TEXINPUTS=c:/texmf-vntex:)

> Thanh provided tfm files for the Microsoft core fonts (Arial,

so you should also change TFMFONTS (if you don't like tds structure
below your texmf-vntex).

The only solution: change TTFONTS in (preferably local) texmf.cnf, 
I think.

Looks fine for the first glance, but I don't see any reason
for 2 packages: vnr, containing fonts (but without map and enc files)
and vntex (with map and enc files :). I'd suggest making just one vntex
package because vntex cannot work without vnr fonts.
Renhard, Thanh, would you consider changing fonts/.../vnr/ into
fonts/.../vntex/ ?
I'd also move 
fonts/enc/dvips/vntex/t5.enc 
to
fonts/enc/dvips/urwvn/t5.enc
since only urwvn uses such reencoding and t5.enc should belong to the
urvn package.

I'd also opt for doing that.

please add a script `update-map' to Tools (and add it to your cron

Why?  There are more Vietnamese fonts than vnr.  It's easiest to
maintain the texmf tree if each family has its own directory.

`vntex' is just the latex and plain stuff.  Compare this to my CJK
package which also doesn't contain CJK fonts.

I disagree.  t5.enc is a generic encoding vector which describes T5
encoding.  It's straightforward to use it with any other Unicode font
(assuming it has the necessary glyphs).

OK. So, to be consequent, we have to move
dvips/vntex/ -> dvips/vnr/
fonts/map/dvips/vntex/ -> fonts/map/dvips/vnr/

Well, t5.enc isn't related to vnr fonts, so cannot be packaged with them.
On the other hand, we have "vnextra" package containing t5d.enc and
t5uni.enc, so?
btw. i think that fonts/map/pdftex/vnextra/mscore.map should be renamed
to something like vnmscore.map.

t5.enc should be present independent of a vnr package; i for instance do not 
want to install vnr fonts but use latin modern (antikwa, iwona, etc) instead.

Message-ID: <200507051315.j65DFsh05162@f7.net>

Hi everyone -- Rainer needs to move the p4 repository from the old Sun
on which it's lived for many years to a new server.  The plan is to do
this sometime tomorrow (July 6), probably morning/early afternoon German
time.  (Rainer, please send us mail when you actually start the move.)

Rainer's gone through the procedure as a test, and the server should not
be down for long, perhaps an hour or so.  

If your P4PORT variable refers to sun.dante.de, you should change it to
refer to texlive.dante.de (you can do this now, in advance):
  P4PORT=texlive.dante.de:1666

On the other hand, due to the vagaries of DNS, I suppose this might
resolve to the wrong place for a little while after the move, so here
are the settings with the physical server names, just in case:
  old  -->  P4PORT=sun.dante.de:1666
  new  -->  P4PORT=comedy.dante.de:1666

sun.dante.de has IP address 134.100.9.52,
comedy.dante.de is 80.237.210.73.

Karl

     `colon expansion' cannot be used with the
    variable TTFONTS.  It seems that it works with TEXINPUTS only.

It's a generic feature.  I find it hard to imagine why it would not work
with TTFONTS, although I admit I didn't check the code.

    Can anyone confirm that "TEXINPUTS=c:\texmf-vntex:" works under
    Windows?  I can't test it.

How about
  TEXINPUTS=c:\texmf-vntex;

    I want to keep things as easy as possible.

That would be nice.  Following Staszek's suggestion, I wonder about
telling them to set
HOMETEXMF=c:\texmf-vntex
TEXMFHOME=c:\texmf-vntex

to get the tree into $TEXMF by default.
Anyone who's actually using $HOME/texmf probably knows what to do.

Dunno about MiKTeX, though ...

Let's change it to mscorevn.map because we already have urwvn.map.
It's easier to remember then.

I suppose that under windows the colon maust be replaced by a
semicolon.

But since TTFONTS cannot set by an environment variable, I'll ask
people to create an own texmf.cnf file.  This seems to be more system
independent. 

Many thanks,
  Reinhard

I tried it under Linux last night.

If no env var is set, kpsewhich --expand-path '$TTFONTS' expands to
the path set in texmf.cnf.

With "export TTFONTS=/a/b/c" it returns "/a/b/c"  but with 
"export TTFONTS=/a/b/c:" it returns an empty string.

I'll ask a friend.

    With "export TTFONTS=/a/b/c" it returns "/a/b/c"  but with 
    "export TTFONTS=/a/b/c:" it returns an empty string.

I get the empty string even when TTFONTS is set, regardless of the extra :.

    tug$ export TTFONTS=/a/b/c; kpsewhich --expand-path '$TTFONTS'

    tug$

Olaf, can you look into this?  I don't see anything obvious in
tex-file.c, it seems to be getting treated the same as everything else.

It seems that it makes a difference whether /a/b/c exists or not.

            tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ptptex/
            (where there is also wrapfig.sty???)

Thankfully, it's a symlink.  ptptex files are up to date.

    piccorr.sty
            tex-archive/graphics/pictex/addon/

Ok, I installed all the pictex files.  Hope that c.1994 code is still
useful to someone.

    swrule.sty
            not latex specific:
            tex-archive/macros/generic/

Updated all the top-level files from tex-archive/macros/generic into the
genmisc package.  Hope none of the new files cause name clashes.

Yup, --expand-path culls those path elements that do not exist.

	$ kpsewhich --expand-path '/a/b/c'
        
	$ kpsewhich --expand-path '/tmp'
        /tmp

The other part is that default expansion works on "formats" not
environment variables.  Example:

	$ env TTFONTS=/tmp: kpsewhich --expand-path '$TTFONTS'
        /tmp
        $ env TTFONTS=/tmp: kpsewhich --show-path=.ttf
        /tmp:.:/home/olaf/texmf/fonts/truetype//:!!/var/lib/texmf/fonts/truetype//:/usr/local/share/texmf-local/fonts/truetype//:!!/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/truetype//:!!/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype//

This is because more than one enviroment variable can used to
determine the .ttf path.

Rainer updated the master DNS, but it'll take a day or two for the
change to propagate.  So may have to use P4PORT=comedy.dante.de:1666 for
now (I did).

Thanks for doing the switch, Rainer.

Message-ID: <200507071856.j67IuHW30377@f7.net>

I don't know if it's intentional, but with the new autoconf support in
web2c, it seems the (really) old form
  AC_OUTPUT(Makefile.in)
no longer works; no Makefile gets generated.

There were about a dozen packages which used that, whose Makefiles and
configures were written by Thomas or Sebastian.  I adjusted them to all
to use the new KPSE_CONFIG_FILES instead.  Also to use kpse_include in
the Makefiles instead of ac_include.

The result seems to once again build everything, hopefully there are no
other problems lurking there.

The next problem is that we're out of all 262,000 words of pattern space
after enabling all the languages ... will work on that later today.
Sigh, it just never ends ...

Subject: [tex-live] pattern memory size
Message-ID: <200507072031.j67KVwo28048@tug.org>

Is there any prospect of changing the maximum allowed pattern memory
(trie_size) to more tham 262,143?  

With our current set of patterns, that space is exhausted.  For now, I
removed ushyphmax.tex since it obviously hasn't been used by anyone.
That freed up enough space for everything else.

If anyone has any ideas about what else could be omitted or might be
reundant, let me know.  Everything > 10k listed below.

I'm also writing to Ole and Dag again, since the new Norwegian patterns
are more than twice as big as the next (Hungarian), and ten times (or
so) the average.

One thing that's not immediately apparent to me is how the memory is
used.  After rebuilding latex.fmt, texmf-var/web2c/latex.log reports:
  Hyphenation trie of length 163373 has 4191 ops out of 35111
I'm sure that ushyphmax.tex does not add ~70,000 to the "length".  So
what does this number mean?  Oh well, don't suppose it can be changed
anyway.

Thanks,
karl

I sent a mail to Eitan yesterday evening (early afternoon in Ohio) but
did not get a response yet.  Maybe he is not at home, usually he
responds within 5 minutes.

There is something I forgot to mention.  There are two files in
doc/generic/vntex, GPL.txt and LPPL.txt.  They can be removed.  All
license notes in human readable files contain URLs to the original
files.

It's probably not bad to put these files into texmf-dist/doc.  The
most happiest users of TeX-Live are those who do not have internet
access.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] new i386-linux binaries + iso image
Message-ID: <200507072119.j67LJdw22729@f7.net>

Finally, I've submitted new i386-linux binaries, and remade the ISO
image at ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test.

This includes pdftex 1.30.0-rc2, Olaf's new web2c/kpathsea stuff, and
the rest -- including new pool files (the bane of our existence).  I
don't know if these pool files match any of the Windows binary sets
Fabrice has released or not; Staszek (or anyone), can you try it, please?
I rather suspect we will have to have separate pool files, which will
not be fun.

Norbert already submitted alpha-linux binaries.  Could the rest of the
architecture-building volunteers give it a whirl?  I'm sure there will
be plenty of problems to figure out.  Here's the rest of the list I've
got from last year:

 i386_64-linux				Tigran (1jul04)
 i386-freebsd (i386 FreeBSD)		Manfred
 i386-openbsd (i386 OpenBSD)		Sebastian
 mips-irix (SGI IRIX)			Olaf
 powerpc-aix (IBM RS/6000 AIX)		Vladimir
 sparc-solaris (Sun Sparc Solaris)	Vladimir/Maksym [gcc 331]
 sparc64-linux (Sparc Linux)		Vladimir

(Vladimir/Maksym, I strongly suggest building the sparc-solaris binaries
without optimization, since we've had soooo many bug reports about them
in the past.  export CFLAGS=-g; Build should do this as well as we can,
ie, for most of the programs.)

Thanks,
Karl

I suspect that number is here because in the original TeX that was
the value of max_halfword (probably somehow connected to a 9-bit
machine). I do not believe there is a reason why it cannot be
enlarged (up to the same value of max_halfword even).

    I do not believe there is a reason why it cannot be

That's what I thought too, but when I tried increasing the value in
texmf.cnf to 362,000, it still ran out of memory, reporting the max was
262143.

Ah, maybe changing the @d ssup_trie_size in tex.ch is all that's needed?
The implications aren't immediately apparent to me ...

Thanks. On RH7.2 I got:
$ ./pdfetex --version
./pdfetex: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3' not found (required by 
./pdfetex)
./pdfetex: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3.4' not found (required by

So the question: should I remade the binaries for Linux on even older

Guess not.

Yes, it would seem so.  If you're running RH7, I'm sure plenty of other

You need to do both, because anything larger than ssup_trie_size is
automatically downgraded during the executable's initialization phase.

Yep, got that.  My question is whether increasing ssup_trie_size will
have other inadvertently bad consequences, like something ends up being
a four-byte array index or some such implementation craziness.

I can just try it if need be, but I thought it would be prudent to ask
first :).

It looks like it should be safe to icrease trie_ssup_size (it is
already a 3-byte value).  My first suggestion would be moving from
262143 (@"3FFFF) to @"3FFFFF (4194303).

I could have sworn that I'd gotten things to build.  But yes, that

    I could have sworn that I'd gotten things to build.  

The way texk/Makefile is written, if a Makefile is not generated in a
subdirectory, it will be skipped.  (For sake of windvi, etc.)  So since
the configure didn't generate the Makefiles in bibtex8, cjkutils, etc.,
the make didn't descend into them.  So the build completed
"successfully", just without building those programs :).

So it goes ...

    262143 (@"3FFFF) to @"3FFFFF (4194303).

Thanks much.  I changed the following lines

./omegadir/com16bit.ch:144:@d ssup_trie_size == 262143
./tex.ch:206:@d ssup_trie_size == 262143
./omegadir-1.15/com16bit.ch:144:@d ssup_trie_size == 262143

./alephdir/com16bit-rc1.ch:144:@d ssup_trie_size == 262143

To use 4194303 instead of 262143 and recompiled pdfetex for i386-linux.
No problems (yay).

Turns out trie_size=300000 in texmf.cnf was sufficient to load all the
patterns again, so I left it at that for now, but we'll be set for the
foreseeable future :).

Thanks to Hans' reminder, I also told Christian so that he could do
something analogous for miktex, if needed.

Eitan reported that the vnextra files are now part of the tex4ht
distribution:

  http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/fix/tex4ht-1.0.2005_07_08_2355.tar.gz

They are not in htf.zip!

You can now remove them from vntex.

Hi Karl, hi all!

I am back from several conferences and have built in a new hard disk
into my laptop were I am working on, so now I can do some things again.

Ok, I have done the following:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{type1ec}
\begin{document}
\texttt{preining@logic.at}
\end{document}

and then pdflatex bla.tex and I get: 

...

> </usr/TeX/texmf-var/fonts/pk/ljfour/jknappen/ec/ectt1095.600pk>
...

So the same problem is still going on, but a bit different. 
I guess there should be some pfb fonts for this, or not?

Best wishes

Works. But this is hard to know, isn't it?

Can you explain me btw why I have to use type1ec at all?

 NP> Works. But this is hard to know, isn't it?

 NP> Can you explain me btw why I have to use type1ec at all?

there's some explanation on the purpose of the "type1ec" package at
the top of the file "type1ec.sty":

% Put \usepackage{type1ec} before \usepackage[...]{fontenc}
% in order to use CM-Super EC/TC/LH fonts at arbitrary sizes.
% To reduce the output PS or PDF file size, use \usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}
% (that will use only 10 pt fonts scaled to any desired size).

So it serves two porposes:

1) allows to use EC and other similar fonts at arbitrary sizes
   (similarly to what the "type1cm" package provides)

2) allows to scale only 10pt fonts to any requested size, thus
   reducing the set of fonts used in the document.

TeX Live maintainers decided to leave only one font per fontshape
(10pt) to reduce the size of the CM-Super package (and similarly for
CBgreek).

Thus, if you wish to use Type1 EC fonts at any size in your documents
in TeX Live installation, the second usage shown above is what you
need.

If you have a full set of CM-Super fonts, you don't need to pass the
[10pt] option.

Best,
v.

Message-ID: <20050713162012.GJ20682@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi guys!

I have now time and energy to work on the debian/texlive stuff. Here is
a short update on the current status:

- BUilding of all the packages work (I am using my version tpm2deb-norb)
- Installation works more or less, following problems currently exist
	- texlive-texinfo should confict with texinfo
	- following files are in tpm for latexextra and binextra
	  /usr/share/texmf/source/latex/perltex/perltex.{ins,dtx}
	  /usr/share/texmf/tpm/perltex.tpm
	  /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/perltex/perltex.sty
- After this, there are still some problmes and no working system:
	- texmf.cnf and updmap.cfg are not used from tex-common
	  thus there are wrong pathes in the texmf.cnf file. The right
	  option is to have
	  /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf -> /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf
	  /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg -> /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
	  ..../fmtutil.cnf (I don't know ATM)
	- ls-R files are not rebuild correctly, maybe this is only a
	  problem of the wrong texmf.cnf file
	- mktexfmt --all does not work (see other email)

I will work on this stuff during the weekend, if someone has a good
idea, please tell me ;-)

If someone wants to see current binaries/debs, please tell me.

Best wishes

Sorry for the late answer, I have been ofline some time.

We are still far from a working system. If you want to play tester and
you have a bit of knowledge on debian configuration stuff, debian-tetex

mktexfmt is a symlink to fmtutil and fmtutil is the usual name. If you
call it as mktexfmt, give the name of the format to be generated as
argument.

Examples:
  fmtutil --all
  mktexfmt latex.fmt

Problem: 
collection-latexextra.tpm requires Package/perltex
collection-binextra.tom requires TLCore/bin-perltex AND Package/perltex!!!

What should I kill? I would say that collection-binextra does NOT depend
on Package/perltex? Suggestions?

Dear Friends!

I need some help. I know that all of the tetex-debian maintainers are
already working like hell, but I still hope that I can get some
feedback.

I have now most stuff fixed, can install all the packages, what I am
attacking now is the postinst stuff.

Since we are starting from a plain new start, we don't need any transfer
stuff.

Now the questions:

* What are the essential things we have to do, and how?

- texmf.cnf
	ATM we don't have any additional configuration files for
	/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf.d, so, is it enough to just link
	/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf to /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf?
	Do we have to call some ucf magic etc???

- updmap.cfg
	I believe that we don't have to do anything here for the 
	texlive-basic package, as updmap.cfg is already (from
	tex-common) in /var/lib/texmf/web2c, which is TEXMFSYSCFG or 
	so.
	Other packages containing map files install an entry into
	/etc/texmf/updmap.d/ already and call 
		update-updmap --quiet
	Is there more to do?

- language.dat, fmtutil.cfg
	Until now I haven't though about them, sorry. Ideas?

I would be very grateful if the masters of debianization could give me
some hints, thanks a lot!

Best wishes

Norbert

I see that there is a way to have an TPM:Installation enty

Is there a reason why this is not used, and can this be put into the the

Thanks.

BUT: I have a different question now:

I have a adapted language.dat file in /var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config
and the original one /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config

When I call fmtutil-sys the language.dat from the /usr/share tree is
taken:

$ kpsewhich language.dat
/var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config

but if I do the same like the fmtutil-sys:
$ v=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR`
$ c=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSCONFIG`
$ TEXMFVAR="$v"
$ TEXMFCONFIG="$c"
$ export TEXMFVAR TEXMFCONFIG
$ kpsewhich language.dat
/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat

I definitely do not understand this, can you help me?

Dear Sebastian, dear Karl!

Soon (next week) I have debian packages ready which should install and
work quite nice out of the box. There are some questions still open (see
my other emails), but none of them is a serious problem.

I have already tested the .debs on my chroot system here with success,
so now I am thinking about putting them somewhere online. I know that
there is already a set online made by Sebastian on the tug.org server,
but AFAIR there are several problems with this set.

Now my question: Can I get access to the tug.org/texlive/debian stuff,
i.e. upload new binaries, write some explanation etc.

THis way I hope to get some feedback from `brave debian users' ;-)

Best wishes

> BUT: I have a different question now:

I think this can be explained if you look at your definition of the
order of TEXMF trees given in the TEXMF variable.

In teTeX's default setup, there is no overlap among the directories
mentioned in $TEXMF, i.e. all of TEXMFDIST, TEXMFHOME, TEXMFMAIN,
TEXMFCONFIG, TEXMFVAR, TEXMFSYSVAR and TEXMFSYSCONFIG are different
directories.

If you do something else, you should know what you are doing and also
know that I don't recommend to do this...

Second case, I want an automatic way to get entries in fmtutil.cnf, as
with debian package I am not sure which engines/formats are installed.
Having this information in the buildFormat would be nice.

Or, like wiht language.XX.dat, it would be nice to have
fmtutil.blabla.cnf collected somewhere.

For now I am using the standard fmtutil.cnf without any modifications,
even if some engine is not installed.

I may be misremembering,  but my recollection of the reasoning
was that the system creates format files as and when needed,
and we were short of space on the CD.

why do you want to precreate formats? or do you mean you
want to add entries to fmtutil.cnf?

other memories welcome....

I think (although I'm not completely sure ATM) it is sufficient to ship
the symlink in /usr/share/texmf/web2c/.  The call to update-texmf is
already done by tex-common.

Yes, because update-updmap does *not* call updmap, you have to do that
manually.  This is something we have discussed before, but we never
decided what we should do.  One option, of course, would be to include
the updmap call in update-updmap.  However there were some reasons
against it (don't recall the details), and there's an other option:  We
could try to delay all or some of the time-consuming tasks (like format
creation and running updmap), moving them from the individual postinst
script to the tasks that dpkg carries out after it has finished all
postinst scripts.  Thus, this would only have to be done once.  The
problem is that currently I don't know how we can make sure that if
something goes wrong in that stage, we can direct the blame on
tex-common.

language.dat is indeed a problem.  Up to now, there were no packages
providing hyphenation patterns besides tetex-base.  We have now a
request from a packager who wants to provide additional patterns:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-tetex-maint/2005/07/msg00115.html

So one solution would be to extend the update-foo mechanism to
language.dat and have an /etc/texmf/hyphen.d/.  Ivan, are you just
trying to package the bulgarian patterns for local usage, or is it about
a different set of patterns?

Norbert, please remind us of the structuring of language support in
tex-live:  Will there be separate packages for most of the languages, so
that one cannot tell which patterns are available without actually
checking whether they are installed?  Or are the patterns installed in a
base installation?

Ah, fmtutil.cfg.

there are only comments in 00tex.cfg from tex-common, so you have to add
your own files for the respective formats.  As for the numbering scheme
- how many different packages that provide formats will there be,
approximately?

there will be texlive-langvietnamese etc packages.

Again, I have created tex-common_0.3.3 which includes already
update-language etc, and configuration of it.

Please take a look at the package, maybe you have some useful comments.
http://www.logic.at/people/preining/tl/

ATM I have entries in /etc/texmf/language.d/:
00tex.cnf                      50texlive-langhungarian.cnf
10texlive-basic.cnf            50texlive-langitalian.cnf
50texlive-langcjk.cnf          50texlive-langlatin.cnf
50texlive-langcroatian.cnf     50texlive-langmongolian.cnf
50texlive-langcyrillic.cnf     50texlive-langnorwegian.cnf
50texlive-langczechslovak.cnf  50texlive-langother.cnf
50texlive-langdanish.cnf       50texlive-langpolish.cnf
50texlive-langfinnish.cnf      50texlive-langportuguese.cnf
50texlive-langfrench.cnf       50texlive-langspanish.cnf
50texlive-langgerman.cnf       50texlive-langswedish.cnf
50texlive-langgreek.cnf        50texlive-langukenglish.cnf

where the 10texlive-basic.cnf contains the contents of language.us and
the others the respective parts, eg:
$ cat 50texlive-langgerman.cnf 
german           dehypht.tex
ngerman          dehyphn.tex


>From these files in the usual mechanism 
	/var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat
is generated.

Related to this is my other question  about WHY fmtutil-sys does NOT
find /var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat but uses the one in
/usr/share/texmf? (See my other emaisl!)

Hi guys,

   The patterns are actually for the Church Slavonic language,
provided by a package called HIPTeX. Since this is not a living
language, and its use is rather specialized, I don't think I can
expect it to be added to Babel or to the TeTeX distribution. I hope
it's not too much trouble to change the package infrastructure to
accommodate adding new hyphenation patterns. Thanks for at least
giving the issue some thought.

       Ivan

Looks good generally.  I have rewritten the manpage and dropped the
unreleased versions from the changelog (and fixed a typo from Thomas,
already notified him), a diff is attached.  And we should add a section
to the TeX Policy document - do you have time to write it?

Subject: [tex-live] debian packages ready
Message-ID: <20050718155546.GA7459@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear all!

I have a set of debian packages of texlive ready, and I hope that soon I
can upload to www.tug.org. For now, here is the README file, please
tell me if I have forgotten something:

------------- 8< --------------------------
README forTeXlive for Debian
=============================

(status: 18.07.2005, Norbert Preining)

Here you can find Debian packages of the TeXlive system. 

These packages are not for production systems and should only be used
by persons who know how to deal with bugs, errors, on the Debian side
and on the TeX side.

Please send comments and suggestions to the tex-live mailing list,
and nowhere else. Especially NOT to the debian-tetex-maint mailing list
or some other debian related list.

At the moment the binaries are only for i386, but packages for alpha can
be produced on request.

Installation:
-------------
Add 
	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ binary/
to your /etc/apt/sources.list, apt-get update and
apt-get install texlive-latexrecommended should you get going.

Postinstallation stuff:
-----------------------
There are still some things you have to do *after* installation: Call once
	fmtutil-sys --all
(as root). This should give you a working TeX system.

	
Comments:
----------
* You need at least tex-common_0.3.4, which is also in this set, but not
  in debian/sid (for now).

* Conflicts: 
  - texlive-psutils <-> lcdf-typetools 
    this is ok, since we provide all the programs
  - texlive-psutils <-> psutils
    Here there is a problem, as kdeprint depends on psutils.
    So you either install psutils and kdeprint, or texlive-psutils and
    forget about kde(print). It is your option, and we are working on this.
  - texlive-fontsrecommended <-> lmodern
    For the TeX side there is no problem/lost. But the lmodern package
    also provides the fonts for the X-Window-Systems. Decide what you want.
  - texlive-latexextra <-> preview-latex-style
    Another problem. texlive contains the same files of preview-latex-style,
    but preview-latex (containing emacs stuff) depends on preview-latex-style.

------------------------

That's it.

The AUCTeX team is (still) preparing AUCTeX 11.80.  It will contain
preview-latex as an integrated part of AUCTeX instead of a separate
component.

It also has an optional compile time configuration that places the
required style files locally into the Emacs tree and manipulates
TEXINPUTS to access them.  From the installation instructions, the
section for package providers:

       If your package is intended as an XEmacs package or to
    accompany a precompiled version of Emacs, you might not know which
    TeX system will be available when preview-latex gets used.  In
    this case you should build using the `--without-texmf-dir' option
    described previously.  This can also be convenient for systems
    that are intended to support more than a single TeX distribution.
    Since more often than not TeX packages for operating system
    distributions are either much more outdated or much less complete
    than separately provided systems like TeX Live, this method may be
    generally preferable when providing packages.

       The following package structure would be adequate for a typical
    fully supported Unix-like installation:

    `preview-tetex'
         Style files and documentation for `preview.sty', placed into
         a TeX tree where it is accessible from the teTeX executables
         usually delivered with a system.  If there are other commonly
         used TeX system packages, it might be appropriate to provide
         separate packages for those.

    `auctex-emacs-tetex'
         This package will require the installation of `preview-tetex'
         and will record in `TeX-macro-global' know where to find the
         TeX tree.  It is also a good idea to run
              emacs -batch -f TeX-auto-generate-global
         when either AUCTeX or teTeX get installed or upgraded.

    `auctex-emacs-notex'
         This package will be compiled with `--without-texmf-dir' and
         will consequently contain the `preview' style files in its
         private directory.  It will probably not be possible to
         initialize `TeX-macro-global' to a useful value, so running
         `TeX-auto-generate-global' does not appear useful.  This
         package would neither conflict with nor provide
         `preview-tetex'.

    `auctex-xemacs-tetex'
    `auctex-xemacs-notex'
         Those are the obvious XEmacs equivalents.  For XEmacs, there
         is the additional problem that the XEmacs sumo package tree
         already possibly provides its own version of AUCTeX, and the
         user might even have used the XEmacs package manager to
         updating this package, or even installing a private AUCTeX
         version.  So you should make sure that such a package will
         not conflict with existing XEmacs packages and will be at an
         appropriate place in the load order (after site-wide and
         user-specific locations, but before a distribution-specific
         sumo package tree).  Using the `--without-packagedir' option
         might be one idea to avoid conflicts.  Another might be to
         refrain from providing an XEmacs package and just rely on the
         user or system administrator to instead use the XEmacs
         package system.


So with the next release of AUCTeX, there will be several ways of
tackling the problem.  One will be to use auctex-{,x}emacs-notex, another
would be if a separate package preview-texlive was created that would
satisfy the dependencies of auctex-{,x}emacs-tetex.  Maybe it would
make sense to factor out auctex-{,x}emacs-base from the above package
scheme and just make additional packages providing the rest.

Of course, this is just the advice from upstream.  Whether or not
Debian will follow it is a different question: after all, the
previous preview-latex scheme was quite different.

You don't have your own copies of the Emacs lisp files?  Then I'd
suggest that you simply remove this style.  Since lisp and tex files
closely depend on each other, the LaTeX style files from an arbitrary
version won't help much anyway.

In case you do ship the Emacs lisp files, you have the same conflict
problem also with the preview-latex package.  Also beware that upstream
has merged AUCTeX and preview-latex, so that you'd have to provide
AUCTeX, too - I don't recommend to try this.

The preview styles are a required part for ps4pdf and a few other
things.  I think they should definitely be part of the normal TeXlive
tree (as opposed to the Elisp and other Emacs support stuff in
preview-latex/AUCTeX).  AUCTeX's next version will come with ways to
use corresponding styles in the Emacs tree instead, so I think that
the problem of reconciling versions can be left to the basic operating
system vendor/packager.

It does not seem like a good idea to leave out the preview styles from
TeXlive just on the hunch that the operating system might also provide
preview-latex in an unnecessarily conflicting manner.

    The preview styles are a required part for ps4pdf and a few other
    things.  

ps4pdf.sty depends on preview-latex?  I don't remember anything like
this, and http://www.perce.de/LaTeX/ps4pdf/ps4pdf.sty doesn't seem to
mention it.  Are you talking about a different ps4pdf?

Anyway, this is a side issue.

I had the impression that you were going to release everything
"integrated" tightly together instead of in separate pieces.  Guess
that's wrong.  No need to explain, it doesn't matter.  If there's some
directory on CTAN which will eventually contain (la)tex files and
similar, which can be installed usefully as a TL package by themselves,
as you describe, then sure, I agree, we'll include that.  If I have to
pick out certain files from certain directories and omit others, that
would be a drag.

Thanks,

No, on preview.sty.  preview-latex is the Emacs application.

>From ps4pdf/README:


    The LaTeX package `ps4pdf' provides a new way to use Postscript
    commands (e.g. PSTricks graphics, PSfrag replacements, EPS
    graphics) inside a pdfLaTeX processed document. You need recent
    versions of the LaTeX packages `preview', `ifpdf', `ifvtex' and a
                                   ^^^^^^^^^
    new LaTeX base installation.

Uh, you are talking about a basically undocumented style file, not
about its documentation.  Still, the file is _plastered_ all over with
references to the preview package.

Everything is one tarball, AUCTeX, but the various parts are installed
into different places by the installation procedure.  The default is
to place the preview styles into the TeX tree, but that's not the only
option.

The directory CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/preview has always been
provided for the styles only.

I consider it likely that you already did include the above.

I gather you don't need the information in a TPM:Execute specifically,
just would like it somewhere in the tpm.  Right?  I suppose it's doable,
but I have no idea what the relevant packages and formats are, BTW
... do you?

On a somewhat related subject, I wouldn't mind adding some more fields
to the tpm schema, not for use by the actual installers like
install-tl.sh, but for our utilities which try to update packages from
CTAN to TL.  Right now I have a bunch of special cases embedded in the
scripts, but having it all data-driven from the tpm seems like it would
be cleaner.  Not that this is high on my priority list.  And I expect it
would tie into the catalogue and CTAN dtd projects ...

(Turns out comments get eradicated by tpm-factory, BTW.)

    >For now I am using the standard fmtutil.cnf without any modifications,
    >even if some engine is not installed.

Is this a problem?

    Seb> why do you want to precreate formats? 

I have been pondering the idea of precreating some common formats in
order to make the DVD truly "live" (for some users), ie, no writable
local directories required.  It seems to me this would be a good thing.

I haven't actually tried it, so I don't know if there are other issues
with doing so.  I don't think the amount of space would be impossible,
especially since it's only relevant to the DVD these days anyway.

So I would suggest that we ask the maintaineer of preview-latex that he
only Suggest: preview-latex-style or makes a 
Depend: preview-latex-style | texlive-latexextra

Does one of you have contact with the DDs responsible for preview-latex
stuff?

having a TPM instruction whose job is to create a .cfg file in some

I don't think we were talking about leaving them out from TeXlive
proper, but from the Debian package texlive-latexextra.  We can still do
that, and have the packages that provide ps4pdf and friends Depend: on
preview-latex-style.  But since this might produce incompatibilities if
the versions differ, it's probably best to have everything
(preview-latex and texlive-"ps4pdf") depend on "preview-latex-style |
texlive-previewlatex" and add the required versions when necessary.

I would like to have something similar to the language.XX.dat for
formats. So that if a tpm installs a new engine, it also contains a file
formats.xxx.cnf (eg) which contains the format definitions formatted for
fmtutil.cnf. Furthermore, in the action there should be something like
xxx as parameter so that when running the tpm file, I can look up
formats.xxx.cnf, incorporate it into the fmtutil.cnf file (or for debian
into /etc/texmf/fmtutil.d/) and be happy ;-)

How would we do this?

True, completely.

Well there is no texlive-previewlatex (If we would go down to this level
we would have several hundreds of debian packages, and we decided not to
do this).

I have taken out preview-latex of the texlive-latexextra package (not of
course out of TeX live proper).

Fortunately the debian package preview-latex-style does NOT depend on
tetex specifically, so you can install it also into texlive.

The texlive-latexextra suggests preview-latex-style

It can't just suggest it if ps4pdf depends on it.  _IF_ Debian will
follow the suggested package layout in AUCTeX's INSTALL file (and the
only way to find out is to ask the Debian maintainers), then you
should alternatively depend on preview-tetex, which is a saner name.
However, preview-tetex would be installed in the teTeX tree, so I
don't quite see how it can substitute for TeXlive.  Or is TeXlive
supposed to not be installed in parallel with teTeX?

Anyway, please don't use "preview-latex" in your package names unless
you are talking about the Emacs package: the Emacs system is called
"preview-latex", but the style files are just "preview".  Yes, Debian
got this wrong, too, at the moment.

Oh, I think it can, or we can use recommends: 

,---- Recommends:
| The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together
| with this one in all but unusual installations.
`----

|     without them is perfectly reasonable.
`----

If one LaTeX style from a couple in texlive-latexextra needs an
additional file, this doesn't mean that it has to declare a "Depends".
A depends is rather for "you cannot make any sensible use of this
package, or it even fails to install, unless...", and this is clearly
not the case here.  I'd say Recommends is in order.

Why should it be renamed to preview-tetex?  It has nothing to do with
teTeX (at least nothing with the Debian teTeX packages, and not more
with teTeX than with TeXlive), and it can be used with texlive-* or with
tetex-* packages.

No, on a Debian system you can only have one (at least with Debian
packages - of course you can install a copy of the other in
/usr/local).

"preview" as a package name is maybe a little too generic, and will lead
people to think it is something to preview file contents (isn't this the
name of the Mac application for this?).  Within texlive, it would be
okay to call it preview only (although this isn't needed AFAIS), but as
a separate Debian package, adding something about TeX is really needed,
I'd say.  preview-latex-styles is not so bad after all, (la)tex-preview
could be an alternative.

Thanks Frank. I seems to me that there is a fundamental misunderstanding
about Debian Packages vs. upstream distribution systems. Naturally, I
cannot add anything to the words of a DD, as I am only a simple user
trying to make debs.

For now we have preview-latex-style, if this changes, we can of course
change the Suggests to the new name, including acutex.

how to do this?! I thought the tpms files are automatically generated,

Yes, I am afraid so :-}

Each time they are re-generated, the TPM files are
checked against the current file, and any Execute
instructions are copied across. The autogeneration
is of the file lists. You can see it works, because
the language Execute instructions are preserved.

Dear friends!

Just now the debian packages of TeX live are in the upload process.
Within 10 hours it should be done (yes sorry, it takes that long, I am
not sooo good connected at my flat!)

Please see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
for instructions and comments.

Suggestions, improvements, installation reports etc etc (even flames)
are welcome to the list or directly to me.

I want to thank here Frank, Sebastian and Karl for the incredible
support they gave me so thatwe could reach this state. There is stil a
lot of work to be done, but it is a start.

For the DD/related people: I do not announce anything on d-d list, I
want to get some feedback prior to getting there and getting killed ;-)

Hi Masters of the TOM stuff!

2 things:
First: I have changed collection-binextra.tpm to NOT include perltex
directly, as outlined in previous emails. As I haven't got any response,
I suspec this is ok.

Second: Missing files mentioned in tpm files: When building the deb
packages the scripts moans that some files which are mentioned in tpm
files are not present in the actual distribution.

Can you take a look at it and tell me wether this is only a problem
solved by revbuilding the tpm files or are there other problems.

Hi Claire!

I didn't want to take over anything, it was more a case of: Do I have to
include several other exceptions now to get some testing, or can I
think about them when I have mad all the other ends met. And since there
are no inter-dependencies (like there are with kde via psutils) I
decided not do do all this now.

AND: I have written all this so that I get this kind of feedback. So now
I will remove the lcdf-stuff from the texlive-psutils package, hoping
there is still something left.

And I will put in a 
Suggest: lcdf-typetools

ok?

Best wishes

Norbert

Okay. This is so exciting I just had to try :-)

I started out by purging my tetex and then doing `aptitude update &&
aptitude install texlive-latexrecemmended' and the a `fmtutil-sys
--all'.

1. `texlive-basic' conflicts with Debians `texinfo' package because
   the file /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/dvips/epsf.tex is in both
   packages (I just purged texinfo and proceeded).

2. Now I wanted to install `texlive-texinfo' but this conflicts with
   Debians `info' packages because the file
   /usr/share/man/man1/info.1.gz is in both packages (I just purged
   info and proceeded).

3. My test document tried to generate some missing fonts, but failed
   because `gsftopk' was missing (I then installed `texlive-binextra'
   where it is present).

4. There is no /var/cache/fonts directory so generating of fonts
   failed until I created one myself (writable ny all users).

5. I installed some more packages and at some point `fmtutil-sys
   --all' stated to fail with:

        This is a summary of all `failed' messages and warnings:
        `aleph -ini  -jobname=aleph -progname=aleph *aleph.ini' failed
        `omega -ini  -jobname=omega -progname=omega omega.ini' failed

   This was before installing texlive-omega (which solved the problem)
   and texlive-formatsextra.

6. mathpazo.sty is installed with the package `texlive-latex' but uses
   some font stuff or something from `texlive-mathextra' (at least
   with my test document).

7. My test document also fails with \usepackage{lmodern}. From the
   missfont.log:

        mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ec-lmtt9
        mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+57/600 --dpi 657 ec-lmtt10

        mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+57/600 --dpi 657 ec-lmtt10

I have now installed all the packages except for the locale
documentation packages and the language packages (texlive-langdanish
has been installed though) and so far I have not discovered problems
besides the above.

Good work, Norbert!

I know, in the next version there will be txlive-texinfo which does not
include the info program, and which conflicts with texinfo.

Which fonts, can I see a testrun, thanks.

This is because up to now I ship one fmtutil.cnf file regardless of what
formats are actually installed. I am just now working on a better
integration with tex-common and /etc/texmf/fmtutil.d which makes this
problem go away.

Ok, I have done the following:

I have added
    <TPM:Installation>
      <TPM:Execute function="BuildFormat"/>
    </TPM:Installation>
to all the bin-XXXXX programs generating formats,

AND I have generated files
	format.XXXXX.cnf
which contains the respective lines for the fmtutil.cnf file.

So when installing the installer just takes the files format.XXXX.cnf
installed and concatenates them to a fmtutil.cnf


QUESTION:
* Where should I put these files? Up to now I have them in 
	/Master/texmf/formats/...
  which seems not to be a good location, but I couldn't think about
  a better one for now.

* Is the above method ok for everyone here? Up to now no installer
  actually makes use of it. But the debian packages will do this soon.
  As soon as I have the ok from Sebastian and a good location!

That's good news - the texinfo package seems to lack an active
maintainer, anyway; and if we would get a usable, fairly recent version
into Debian this way it would be great.  As far as I can see, most of
the bugs in the texinfo package are actually upstream issues, so you'd
have some communication work to do, but not much packaging problems.  If
it turns out that texlive-texinfo is better than the current Debian
package, I'd suggest to either take it (or just its name) over, or
cooperate with the maintainer should he still be willing to do some work
on it.

Grmmmmprf. I was tooo fast with saying this. I just now found out that
info AND texinfo are in the SAME tpm file, which actually makes it
really hard to get this working. Umpf. Hmmm. Ok, I will try.

Sebastian: How can we split out the actual info stuff (not texinfo, but
info and info-key etc) from the bin-texinfo into bin-info tpm?
Do I only have to create a new tpm file, is this enough?

Maybe. FOr now I want it to work as texlive-texinfo. Later we will see.

Minimal document attached as test3.tex.

A log file from a run with pdflatex without the texlive-binextra
package installed is attached as test3-without-tl-binextra.log.

Missfont.log contains:

   mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ec-lmr10

But the interesting part is only shown on stderr:

   kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ec-lmr10/usr/bin/mktexpk: line 141: gsftopk: command not found

Ok. But as I remember it the error wasn't reported when I only had
  
  tex-common texlive-basic texlive-basicbin texlive-documentation-base
  texlive-latex texlive-latexrecommended texlive-pdfetex

installed. I then installed some more packages (I don't rember which
anymore, but _not_ texlive-formatsextra) and the error message
occurred. And disappeared again when I installed texlive-omega.

But since you are working on something better anyway this doesn't
matter.

A minimal example is attached as test6.tex and log file with and
without the texlive-mathextra packages installed is attached as
test6-without-tl-mathextra.log and test6-with-tl-mathextra.log.
Missfont.log contains:

    mktextfm fplmr

Probably because:

   seamus% dpkg -S /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/psnfss/mathpazo.sty
   texlive-latex: /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/psnfss/mathpazo.sty

where as:

   seamus% dpkg -S /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/mathpazo
   texlive-mathextra: /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/public/mathpazo

But I guess this is not a problem spcific to the Debian packaging.

A minimal document (test7.tex) and log from run with pdflatex

   mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ec-lmr10

Subject: [tex-live] underlin package on ctan/in catalogue/in tex-live
Message-ID: <E1DvHXJ-0000Ax-00@mta1.cl.cam.ac.uk>

in the course of my work on the catalogue, i came to be looking at the
entry file underlin.xml

this describes a macros/generic file for underlining

i was surprised to find it also having a statement

  <texlive location='latex3'/>

so i looked at the fptex stuff on ctan which has a snapshot of
tex-live tpm files.  that file has text from underlin.xml, but plainly
contains the code from macros/latex/contrib/underlin, which is a pre-
fancyheadings/fancyhdr thing for pagestyles with underlined headings.

it seems to me that the tpm is describing a different package from the
one its file pointers specify.

underlin.sty is in fact by rainer schöpf, and i shall be creating a
catalogue entry for it "soon" -- probably with the name underlin-ltx
(i.e., unless someone has a better idea).

Hi Arne!

With the new packages just in upload process this should not happen
anymore, but I have some specific comments:

Do you have lmodern or texlive-fontsrecommended installed? In my chroot
cage with fontsrecommended installed, it does work without any problems.
Maybe your lmodern.sty is coming from the lmodern debian package. I have
to add some conflict or something like this.

This should be gone with the new version where only those formats really
installed are generated.

I can confirm the following:
I can latex the file, but dvips does not work. For this you have to
install the texlive-fontsextra which contains the fpl fonts.

Wether this is intended or not, I don't now.
(And it shouldn depend on texlive-mathextra, are you sur?)

Also this I cannot reproduce. If you have lmodern,sty, this is in
texlive-fontsrecommended, but then you should also have the actial
fonts. Probably as above a problem with the installed lmodern package.
PLease remove it (sorry, I hope to find something better soon).


Thanks for testing, and when you see new information on the tug.org
texlive/debian website, you can also retry if you have the time and
nerves, thanks in advance!

Should be done soon, something like one hour.

Best wishes

Dear friends!

A new set of binaries have been uploaded. So now some have
timestamps-version 2005-07-20 and some -19.

These debs should now automatically generate the formats, in fact all
should now already be automatic. Just apt-get install ...

Some remarks, for this see the web page below.

If you install the same files in the same place, you need a conflict,
anyway, or dpkg will bark at you.  Otherwise, I think it should be
possible - and we should really try to actually make it possible with
the packages - to use lmodern.sty from the lmodern package with
texlive.  I guess lmodern will often be more recent, which is important
for a font in development.  As for "same place", lmodern can be the
first to use TEXMFSITE (which does not yet exist).

why would the lmodern package be more up to date than texlive?

edit the BinPatterns, and the other sections get done

its not a great split, but its a small price
to pay to make it play with Debian

adding it to the CD installer will be moderately easy. even

"NP" == Norbert Preining <preining@logic.at>

    NP> * Conflicts: - texlive-psutils <-> lcdf-typetools=20
    NP>   this is ok, since we provide all the programs

Um, no, it's *not* okay.

TeX Live may provide some version of some or all of the programs
included in the lcdf-typetools package, but the last time I
checked it didn't include the latest version.

Even if it did, I suspect that the lcdf-typetools package is more
likely to be updated than the version in TeX Live, so by replacing
the lcdf-typetools files you are potentially forcing older
programs onto users.

Debian policy is that packages that contain versions of libraries
should use the libraries already packaged rather than the internal
ones unless there's some really good reason not to use the shared
libraries.  It stands to reason that the same sort of policy
should apply to binaries -- if a set of programs is already
packaged, you should require or suggest that package rather than
build a different version of the binaries.

If TeX Live is making significant patches to the programs included
in another package, then the right way to handle that situation
would be to file a bug against the other package containing the
patches so that the package's maintainer could work with upstream
to have those patches integrated into the upstream source code.
Failing that, it's possible to integrate patches into the Debian
packages, even if they aren't accepted upstream.

Please remove the lcdf-typetools files from your TeX Live
packages, and feel free to talk to me about any changes to
Debian's lcdf-typetools that might be needed to work with TeX
Live.

I accept whatever you decide.

ATM I haven't split the texinfo.tpm into two, but have added special
cases to the generating scripts. As there are only a few files, this is
no problem.

So please, I do not want to decide about this matter, please tell me
what you want to have. I will adjust the tpm2deb accordingly.

ATM, as I said, texlive-texinfo contains everything what
collection-texinfo references, BUT the info, info-key, install-info
binaries plus the respective documentation.

This is exactely what I am trying to avoid!!! I want to get rid of dual
stuff. I do not know anything about the texinfo-debianpkg vs
texlive-texinfo, I guess they should be at the same release level. SO
probably only minor changes are necessary for making texinfo from debian
play well with current texlive.

Hmm, I want to have a separate directory as for the languages. These
snippets do not actually belong to texmf RUNTIME system, it is only
present for installation procedures.

So do you have another suggestion, otherwise I will put them really into
texmf/web2c

I WILL work on this as soon as the packages and generation process has
reached a more or less stable status.

Then I plan to check the following packages:
- lmodern
- lcdf-typetools
- texinfo
- psutils
- etc
wether they play well with texlive, and if not, suggest to the packagers
some improvements.

I had lmodern installed (I thought it was purged but it wasn't), but
purging it makes no difference. texlive-fontsrecommended is installed.

Now with lmodern purge, all texlive packages installed (except
languages and documentation) a simple document with T1-encoding and
lmodern:

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\begin{document}
This is a test.

But my original point with this item was that without texlive-binextra
installed the above would also fail because gsftopk is in that package
and therefore missing. But I guess that we will never need gsftopk if
the other problem is fixed(?)

And also when you want to use pdflatex on the document.

It just seems confusing that mathpazo.sty is in texlive-latex; the
.pfb-files in texlive-fontsextra and texlive-fontsrecommended; and if
you want the "real" small caps (the sc-option to mathpazo) you also
need texlive-mathextra.

As a user I would expect to have all the functionality of the mathpazo
package installed (including the actual fonts) when I have the
.sty-file (on the other hand TeX Live probably also ships .sty-files
without fonts for commercial fonts and that is okay with me ...).

But this seems more of a TeX Live question than a Debian packaging
question.

This problem appears to be the same as the one mention in 3.


A thing with your newest upload. I just had texlive-langother
installed and purged (just to see what languages where in there).
Formats doesn't get rebuild by this package (and I guess the other
language packages as well) so hyphenation patterns are not
added/removed from the formats on install/purge.


Keep up the good work!

That was because I still had some left overs in ~/.texmf-var/

Removing that directory solved my problem with the Latin Modern fonts.
You really gotta watch out when purging an old system!

This means my new Debian TeX Live installation is without serious
problems now. Thank you, Norbert et al.

Well, only on the surface. Because of a stupid error not all formats are
created from those which should actually be created (the same file under
fmt.d was written several times with different contents, instead of once
with all the contents merged, stupid me!).

Furthermore update-fmtutil wasn't called before calling fmtutil-sys etc
etc etc.

I hope all this is fixed with the rebuild I am just starting ;-)

I think you should carry on like this. Debian style is that
the runtime info system is separate from the development
texinfo; thats their decision as packagers, if we want to
play in their area we should follow it.

but perhaps it should be texmf/fmtutil, on the argument
that directories in texmf are named after the application

Any of the 23 normal, minor, or wishlist bugs, not marked "forwarded to upstream" on
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&data=texinfo&archive=no&version=&dist=unstable

The 4th and 7th are (or rather were?)  probably a Debian issue, the
others under "normal" all look like upstream problems.  It would have
been Josip's responsibility to contact you (or to orphan the package)

I meant "if it turns out that the Debian package "texlive-texinfo" is in
a better shape than the current Debian "texinfo" package ..."

I didn't notice it so you're not stupid to me :-)

I'm now using the packages you uploaded this night.


One of the scripts in /etc/cron.daily discovered the following
dangling symlinks from texlive-omega:

   /usr/share/man/man1/odvicopy.1 -> dvicopy.1
   /usr/share/man/man1/odvips.1 -> dvips.1
   /usr/share/man/man1/odvitype.1 -> dvitype.1

The actual man-pages are gzipped so the symlinks should be:

   /usr/share/man/man1/odvicopy.1.gz -> dvicopy.1.gz
   /usr/share/man/man1/odvips.1.gz -> dvips.1.gz
   /usr/share/man/man1/odvitype.1.gz -> dvitype.1.gz



In /etc/texmf/texmf.d/65BibTeX.cnf BSTINPUTS is defined as

   BSTINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/bst//

TeX Live is shipped with an kpathsearch enable version of bibtex8 and
searches its sorting order files (.csf) along the BSTINPUTS-path.
Since the .csf files are installed under /usr/share/texmf/bibtex/csf/
the definition should be changed to

   BSTINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/{bst,csf}//

But this is probably a general TeX Live issue.

Can we add this to tex-common stuff 65BibTeX.cnf? Or is there a problem
with tetex?

Tetex doesn't ship bibtex8, but changing BSTINPUTS will not do any
harm to tetex.

Ahhh, bingo. THnaks for this. Here dh_compress tricks me out. 
Reason: When the package is built, there is a symlink
	odvicopy.1 -> dvicopy.1
Normally dh_compress respects symlinks in the sense that they are
renamed and `relinked' to the compressed file.

Alas, dvicopy.1.gz is distributed by another package, thus it is not
present when calling dh_compress, i.e. already then there is a dangling
symlink, which is not renamed and `relinked' accordingly.

If more things occur, please tell me, and thanks for your testing!

    its not a great split, but its a small price
    to pay to make it play with Debian

As someone working on both texinfo and tex live, it sounds quite yucky
to me.  Why does the texinfo tpm need to be split up because of these
new Debian packages?

In general, why bother having "texlive" versions of packages which
Debian already has, like texinfo, lcdf-typetools, texi2html, and
probably others?  Sorry, I find it all impossible to understand ...

    why would the lmodern package be more up to date than texlive?

Since we release TL once a year (if we're lucky), "most" packages/styles
will be out of date "most" of the time.  This is not news to you.

    the bugs in the texinfo package are actually upstream issues, 

What bugs in the texinfo package?  I am the upstream maintainer.  Most
bug reports I've received recently were resolved in 4.8, which Debian
didn't have.

    it turns out that texlive-texinfo is better than the current Debian

texlive-texinfo is exactly the same as texinfo 4.8.

    ATM I haven't split the texinfo.tpm into two, but have added special
    cases to the generating scripts. 

Ah, in that case, no problem.  I thought the tpm was being changed.

    I do not know anything about the texinfo-debianpkg vs
    texlive-texinfo, I guess they should be at the same release level. 

If anything, the Debian texinfo will (should) be newer.  It seems
texlive-texinfo can simply be omitted.  Ditto texi2html.  Lcdftools is
probably more complicated, since it actually uses a significant number
of TeX files.

Lmodern is a problem in the other direction.  It is an integral part of
the TeX distribution.  I doubt it can be arbitrarily updated.  Good luck ...

    probably only minor changes are necessary for making texinfo from debian
    play well with current texlive.

FWIW, the only part of texinfo which is relevant to TeX is texinfo.tex
(well, and the txi-LL.tex files).

Thanks,

    Hmm, I want to have a separate directory as for the languages. 

Well, texmf/tex/generic/config contains a few files (pdftex-dvi.tex,
pdftexconfig.tex, and preload.cfg) besides language.*.dat files.

I guess the format.*.dat files aren't read by TeX, so that directory
doesn't make sense.  Indeed, there is no directory that makes sense.
Making a new top-level dir does not appeal.  How about a subdir of
web2c, say web2c/fmtconfig?  They aren't really related to web2c either,
but ...

I rather suspect a subdir of texmf/tpm/ will create lots of hassles.

Hmm.

Hi friends!

I want to ask you about one thing: Did we decide that the *Debian*
packages of TeX live should *not* provide stuff already in Debian?

If yes -> we will Suggest or Depend
If no  -> Any kind of policy?

Just a short list of packages which occur in debian and are also part of
TeX live:
arabtex, chaksem, latex-beamer, latex-xcolor, lmodern,pgf, tex-chess,
texpower, prosper, musixtex, ........

THere is a long list, I am not even half through checking all the
packages.


So now for me there is also the question: WHY? did we decide NOT to
package every tpm, also every single package, into a separate .deb?

Well, a whole lot of work for me to be done :-{{{{{ Getting all these
packages to work with texlive.

texinfo in unstable is still 4.7, the last maintainer upload was  a year
ago (2004-07-13) with two non-maintainer uploads after this, the last on
2004-09-26; after this nothing happened.  I doubt that Debian texinfo
will always be newer.

I had a couple of versions of the lmodern package working with
tetex-2.0.2 and tetex-3.0.  Where do you see the problems?

I would say that the policy is "the Debian packages
of TeX Live should be limited to TeX macros and fonts,
and software  which is only used by TeX". So software like
psutils or texinfo which has a wider currency should be excluded;
I'd not include things like the emacs preview stuff of David, either.

Hmmmm. So we conflict with packages which are present in texlive and
Suggest those not in texlive. 

Ok, Frank and the other DDs, is this a `valid' procedure?

Did it? It would have been just some few hundreds of new packages ;-)

Well, this would be easy, ok.

But as I said, the lmodern-debian package has several advantages, as it
also installs stuff for X, so it would be preferable to use the lmodern
stuff from the direct debian packages. Also because it will probably be
more often updated as once a year.

I think this is a general question: Do we want to have TeX live `as
close as possible' into Debian, or do we want to have a `as complete as
possible' TeX system which is based on TeX live?

I think that TeX Live repository is in real the first place where
packages are updated. So the most fresh lmodern etc. (ready to 
install and run) will be found on TL's p4 anyway.

Yes, of course.  You could make the thing more flexible if a
package/metapackage texlive-b that depends on style A which is in package
texlive-a and the older package a has the following setup:

texlive-b: Depends: texlive-a | a
texlive-a: Conflicts: a

I would start off assuming that from a TeX point of view it doesn't
matter which you take, and only should bug reports point to some
incompatibility add (possibly versioned) Depends/Conflicts.

Not conflicting might be more work, yes.  However - as I said - if the
packages follow the (not yet mandatory) Debian TeX policy, they should
usually work, and you need not do much.

But not on TL's last *released*CDs*, unless you coordinate releases
(including bug fix releases) with TeXlive.  And I assume that texlive
Debian packages will be based mainly on the released version of
texlive.  

My experience with the teTeX packages in Debian is that the combination
of a TeX distribution with a rather long (and, in case of teTeX,
unpredictable) release cycle and a Linux distribution with a really long
and unpredictable release cycle is problematic.  For example sarge ended
up with tetex-2.0.2 (even without lmodern), whereas lmodern is quite
recent (and it's a deliberate decision of the maintainer to be not
completely up-to-date).

For texlive, these problems will probably be less severe, but still
there.  Therefore packages that are under heavy development (an other
example is beamer) will almost for sure be more recent if you take the
individually packaged versions.

We could also have texlive-binextra (which bibtex8 is part of) ship a
file

    /etc/texmf/texmf.d/65BibTeX8.cnf
or
    /etc/texmf/texmf.d/50texlive-binextra.cnf

with the contents

% BibTeX8 sorting order files and BibTeX style files.
BSTINPUTS.bibtex8 = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/{bst,csf}//

That way it won't interfere with teTeX (not even with TeX Live's own
bibtex). That's what I'm doing on my system currently.

No. Frank K?ster and we have agreed that we have only *one* texmf.cnf
stuff as long as possible, and this is located in tex-common.

Up to now neither tetex (>3.0_5 or so) nor texlive install texmf.d/*
files. We want to keep it in one place.

With new tetex there will be no interference anymore.

Dear friends!
 
A new set of binaries are being uploaded. So now some have

Changes:
* map files are back to /etc/texmf/map
* Conflicts with more or less all the packages already in debian.
  Later on I will work on exceptions like lmodern.

Please test.

Dear Norbert,

I have updated to 2005-07-23-1.

The only problem I have discovered is that during upgrade it is
reported that:

updmap: Scanning for LW35 support files

!!! ERROR! The map file `dvips35.map' has not been found at all.

    Either put this file into the right place or remove the
    reference from the configuration file. An automatic way
    to disable unavailable map files is to call
      updmap --syncwithtrees

    For manual editing, call
      updmap --edit


Kind regards,

Subject: [tex-live] ttex on TeXLive
Message-ID: <20050724.154214.229731717.wl@gnu.org>


[Erronously sent to ctan@dante.de, sorry.]


The current Thai bundle in TeXLive (ttex) is more than 10 years old!
Additionally, there are the following problems.

  . ttex uses the dbtt font family which is (a) a set of bad fonts
    (from the technical point of view) and (b) has an unknown license.

  . The cttex preprocessor needed for Thai isn't available as a binary
    in TeXLive.

For these reasons, I suggest the following.

  1. Remove ttex and dbtt completely.

  2. Install the recent thailatex bundle -- BTW, is this already on
     CTAN? -- but with a reduced set of fonts.  The norasi fonts are
     already in TeXLive, and I would like to use the garuda family as
     a replacement for dbtt.  Is this OK?  I'll update both norasi and
     garuda by myself, since I need it for my CJK package too (but
     with different metrics files).

  3. Make cttex a separate bundle (it is no longer part of thailatex)
     and update it to the recent version (the version on TeXLive is
     1.15).  Since it is a Unix filter it should be straightforward to
     compile it on all platforms.

     I wonder whether cttex should be replaced with another Thai
     preprocessor.  Please advise.

I volunteer to do the changes -- only for proper integration of cttex
I will probably need someone who checks whether I've done the
integration correctly.

Great.  I'm perfectly happy for you to do whatever you think best about
the Thai setup in TL, and I dare to presume that Sebastian feels the
same, so please go ahead with that.  You certainly know far better than
me what will work best.  Your plan sounds good as far as I can tell.

    >   2. Install the recent thailatex bundle -- BTW, is this already on
    >      CTAN?

In general, for TL we *strongly* encourage all authors to make sure that
what we install is on CTAN.  To the point of not updating if the updates
are not on CTAN.  I'm not clear on who wrote what here, but can we
please make sure that whatever fonts/styles/programs end up in TL are
also on CTAN, in some form?

    Since it is a Unix filter it should be straightforward to compile it
    on all platforms.

Compiling *anything* new in TL is far from straightforward :(.  Should
be added to the various Makefiles, configures, and withenable.ac's.
Not kpathsea or any of the other libraries will certainly make it
easier, though.

Thanks,
karl

Yes, I know. The problem is that I don't know how to upgrade a dir to a
link. Please do the following as root:

cd /usr/share/texmf/fonts
rmdir map    (should work, it should be empty)
ln -s /etc/texmf/map .
mktexlsr
updmap-sys

This should work.

Best wishes

Greetings Germain,

    I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

I am no expert on Windows, but since no one else has replied --
try running
  mktexfmt latex
or 
  fmtutil latex
and hopefully it will be able to create it and put it in the right.

Although the .fmt's are supposed to be created on the fly as you need
them, it seems that is not working for some reason.

Ultimately I believe there needs to be a file latex.fmt in your
texmf/web2c directory, under wherever you installed TL.  Perhaps
c:\tex\texmf\web2c\latex.fmt judging from your prompt. If all else
fails, you might be able to create it by hand:
  cd c:\wherever
  pdfetex -ini   -jobname=latex -progname=latex -translate-file=cp227.tcx *latex.ini

Hope this helps,
karl

Ok, I made a diff between the files in
	Master/texmf-dist/tex/context/base/

Hi Karl, all!

When building the debian packages I get:

/usr/TeX/texlive-src/Master/texmf-doc/tpm/epslatex-fr.tpm not found!

it seems that epslatex-fr was added again in #7577 (Karl) but the
respective tpm file is missing, and also seems not to have been produced
with the latest update of the tpm files.

Hmm, I have now all the files from context actually in my local depot,
but fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-en fails with:
..
(/usr/TeX/texlive-src/Master/texmf-dist/tex/context/patterns/lang-nl.hyp)

Bingo, there was an old cont-usr file lying around in texmf-var

Thanks all working now.

I submit the change.

I had an old cont-usr config file in texmf-var.

I have submitted a new context, form 2005-07-27 website.

What I don't know is how do I recreate onetpm only? Can you tell me how
to create e.g.
	texmf-dist/context.tpm

Another thing: Why is there no link from
	cont-en -> pdfetex
in bin/i386-linux (nor in any other bin dir)? ALso no context link.

Context should find the files in tex/context/patterns before the ones in
tex/generic/hyphen (which is in this case more like tex/babel-specific).

It's probably the aliases file messing stuff up, because modern context
releases actually search for lang-cz.pat,czhyphen.tex and czhyph.pat, in 
succession, but never for czhyph.tex.

    locate your aliases file (in the texmf root) and delete all references

I deleted texmf-dist/aliases in TeX Live some time ago (change 7086 on
May 31).  There are no others.

As I already wrote, all solved, it was a rogue cont-usr file.

(Package/foo for texmf-dist, TLCore/foo for texmf, Documentation/foo for

should be a front-end script or all the variations just built into

Thanks, I re-added it.  Apparently ctan2tds.pl doesn't p4 add the

And I fixed it. It called itself (in the tpm) impatient-fr and not
epslatex-fr, which seemed strange. And make perl TPM bark.

    ! I can't find file `latex.ini'.

Oh, well, this is the root problem.  (Probably why the .fmt wasn't
automatically created in the first place.)  If you run 
  kpsewhich latex.ini
does it return anything?  Presumably not.  The file exists in
texmf-dist/tex/latex/config/latex.ini (under c:\tex in your case, I
guess).

Do you have a personal TEXINPUTS (or other TeX-related) environment
variable set to some stray value, by any chance?  Otherwise, what's the
result of
  kpsewhich -var-value TEXINPUTS
?  It may be necessary to edit c:\tex\texmf\web2c\texmf.cnf.
(Or maybe in texmf-var instead of texmf.)

Regards,
Karl

The patterns=from did the trick, the tpm_dir didn't change anything at
all, strange enough.

Hi Karl! Hi Sebastian! Hi all!

I have again a problem:

Ok, I have done this: (bin-latex.tpm)
...
      <TPM:RunPatterns>
texmf/fmtutil/format.latex.cnf
texmf/tex/generic/config/preload.cfg
texmf/tex/latex/config/*
texmf/tpm/bin-latex.tpm
      </TPM:RunPatterns>

Then I recreate bin-latex.tpm with
perl $tm/Tools/tpm-factory.pl   --master_dir=$tm --dest_dir=/tmp
--ftp_dir=/tmp     --tpm_dir=$tm/texmf-dist/tpm       --clean
--patterns=auto --name=TLCore/bin-latex

and it is rewriten, I see it. BUT: THere is noting wrt format.latex.cnf
in the RunFIles:
    <TPM:RunFiles size="7906">
texmf/tex/generic/config/preload.cfg
texmf/tex/latex/config/color.cfg
texmf/tex/latex/config/graphics.cfg
texmf/tex/latex/config/hyperref.cfg
texmf/tpm/bin-latex.tpm
    </TPM:RunFiles>

Can someone explain me why the format.latex.cnf is not included in the
RUnFiles part?

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

If that fails, try adding --debug, although the output is usually not

Message-ID: <20050729154609.GA19152@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!

Another set of binaries are ready on the tug server. I consider them
quite stable and well working. 

Please really give them a try, if you can. You have to have debian/sid
running, as the shlib-depends are build on my sid box, sorry. Please
also read http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

On my todo list there are only a few things open:
- man page links for some programs are lost (dh_compress problem)
- depends on perl if there is a perl script missing
- aleph and lamed do not work with all languages installed, trie_size?
- long term: make other packages play well

I am off for the whole weekend, so do NOT expect any responses from me.

Furthermore: I start working on `real' debian packages, i.e. packages
with rules, orig.tar.gz etc etc which we could thinl about uploading.
A first start is done, see Master/debian. If someone has time and fun
he could edit the Description fields of the various control files ;-)

For arch-independent packages I am more or less finished, this works 
quite well. Now I have to think about how to do it with the building of
binaries. Grmmm.

Best wishes

Norbert

Don't you have some short descriptions in the tpm files, or elsewhere,
that are used for the installer?  Why not just generate the description
from these, like this:

Descriptions: <short description from tpm>
 TeX-live is a comprehensive collection ... bla ...blubb
 several
 lines
 .
 This package provides <repeat short descriptions from tpm>

Packages with perl binaries in it should have Depend: perl in the
control file.

There is already a one-line description, but I thought that this is too
short.

    Don't you have some short descriptions in the tpm files, or elsewhere,
    that are used for the installer?  

The descriptions (and version and author fields) in the .tpm files (both
short and long) are not maintained and often missing or erroneous.  I do
not know what really needs or uses them.

If real information for these is necessary or desirable, it should come
from the TeX Catalogue, which is actively maintained.  (The descriptions
in the tpm files could be autoupdated from the Catalogue, but I haven't
yet seen a reason to take the time to do this.)

Best,
Karl

Ah.  This seems like a problem with tlpm; maybe Staszek and the author
can help.  Meanwhile, maybe one of the other Windows installation
methods would work for you.  (Or use proTeXt, unless there's some reason
you specifically want to use the TL version.)

You can get the latex.ini file itself from
http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/config/latex.ini,
but if that fundamental file is missing, it seems very likely that
others will be missing as well.

Looking into collection-langcjk.tpm, I see this:

    <TPM:Requires>
      <TPM:Package name="CJK"/>
      <TPM:Package name="arphic"/>
      <TPM:Package name="cns"/>   
      <TPM:Package name="garuda"/>
      <TPM:Package name="korean"/>
      <TPM:Package name="norasi"/>
      <TPM:Package name="wadalab"/>
      <TPM:Package name="wansong"/>
      <TPM:Package name="yi4latex"/>
      <TPM:TLCore name="bin-cjkutils"/>
      <TPM:TLCore name="collection-basic"/>
      <TPM:TLCore name="hyphen-pinyin"/>   
    </TPM:Requires>

On the other hand, most of those packages are required by CJK.tpm
itself.  Wouldn't it be better to reduce the above to

    <TPM:Requires>
      <TPM:Package name="CJK"/>
      <TPM:Package name="yi4latex"/>
      <TPM:TLCore name="bin-cjkutils"/>
      <TPM:TLCore name="collection-basic"/>
      <TPM:TLCore name="hyphen-pinyin"/>   
    </TPM:Requires>

?  This looks simpler and easier to understand IMHO.

BTW, in CJK.tpm, I currently require the maximal configuration, this
is, the complete functionality of the CJK package is available if
CJK.tpm is selected -- I could split CJK.tpm into CJK-base.tpm,
CJK-japanese.tpm, CJK-chinese-traditional.tpm, CJK-thai.tpm, etc.

I wonder whether I shall do this or whether this is unnecessary, given
the big hard disks of today's computers.

this used to happen. it would be worth doing again, I think.
perhaps I'll have a go.

I wouldn't bother. as you say, disk space is not usually an issue these days

They have a sarovar project now (I don't know the name).  Maybe best to

is if it is).

If no one else answers here, write ctan@dante.de ...

I have looked at the Sarovar site, and I cannot see the source anywhere,
just a load of HTML files etc. There is a reference to the source in CVS
there,
but the last update is from 2004.

I want to write a script to walk over the TPM files and update the
<Description>
from the Catalogue; or, alternatively, do that in the debian-making
machine. But either
way one needs a reliable URL to look at which will return a stream of
XML about eg
"geometry".

Following this link gives the current version:

thanks, thats what I need.

sadly, the XML is not valid, as it references "catalogue.dtd" , which is
not in the directory where
the XML is, but I can work around that.

I'm updating the TPM files the CTAN catalogue now, for the
title, author and description.  This is for those cases where
there is a 1:1 correspondence of the name, of course.

Norbert, I'll submit these in a few hours (its only on the letter C...),
so when you come back you might like to see about using them
to build the Debian control file nicely
