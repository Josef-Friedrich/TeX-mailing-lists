Okay, clear.  I read: "depends on perl (if there is a perl script
missing)", but you meant "depends on perl (if there is a perl script)
missing".

Of course it would be better to have a longer description, but I'd
rather not create all of them manually.  If a texlive Debian package
contains one (La)TeX package, or one (La)TeX package plus add-ons, you
could try to generate it from the text in the Catalogue.

Hi all!

Concerning the descriptions, some comments from my side:

The problem is that all the texlive-debian packages are generated from
the respective collection-* TPMs, which normally include a whole bunch
of other packages/TPMs.

THe problem is - as I said - with the descriptions in the collection-*
files, which are probably not updated from the Catalogue.

For now I have decided that I will:
- take the TPM:title for the short one line description
- take the TPM:description for the long description
and maybe one of us (including me) find some time to write a bit more in
the Descriptions of the collection*, there are some with good
descriptions, but some of them are just short one-liners, too.

I have now build source packages for those texlive-* packages not
including real binary files. And I have checked all of them with lintian

Message-ID: <20050802094757.GJ19853@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

I would like to hear your suggestions concerning packaging the
SourceFiles into the respective Debian packages.

In the TPMs we have the part describing the SourceFiles.

ATM all these source files are installed into /usr/share/texmf/source/..

lintian (integrity checking tool for debian packages) finds a whole lot
of errors and warnings in these source files
(included binary files in arch=all packages, shell scripts with wrong sh
path, scripts with wrong tcl path, etc).

Thus my question is:

How should I cope with these errors:
- Leave the source stuff completely out (out of source package and
  binary package, it is not actually used for building since TeX live
  includes already everything prepared).
- Leave the source stuff out of the binary package only
- Leave it in source and binary, and ignore lintian errors
- Leave it in source and binary and try to hack all errors

Thanks a lot for enlighten me!

Best wishes

Norbert

Well, obviously it is not to me. Why is the source actually needed for
*running* TeX? 

If I leave it in the source package everyone can get it with apt-get
source ...

I can fix these errors either in the Depot, or in the Debian diff, what
do you think?

Up to now there aren't that many errors, most of them I can fix either
in Debian or direct in the Depot. More problematic are the actual binary
files (splitindex). I don't know what to do with them.

There was one for otibet, I deleted it, it was sooo useless.

Even if it isn't needed, it should be as correct as possible.  Talking
in bug severities, it's minor or wishlist, but if it's a bug it's still
a bug, even when it's in a separate binary package with the sources, or
only in the source package.

>> can you give an example of a package where the problems apply?

In my view, the ideal solution to this would be to have a source package
that produces the architecture-dependent binary package that contains
splitindex, and the arch=all binary package that contains
splitindex.sty.

A more realistic solution would be to simply remove the precompiled
binaries from the orig.tar.gz, both of the arch=all package and of the
arch=any package.  This has the additional benefit that it will never
happen that you accidently upload a version which fails to compile
splitindex, but doesn't detect that because it simply takes the
precompiled file.

> 	wrong shell path:

Is there any sane system in the world where the POSIX shell is not in
/bin/?  

> 	wront tcl path:

Isn't there a tcl analogon to the magic perl header?

It doesn't matter as long as somebody pesters upstream to fix them in
their sources and on CTAn, too.

Is it necessary to remove the stuff from the .orig.tar.gz? I would
prefer to leave it in the .orig.tar.gz (why: it is generated by simply
copying all files referenced in the current tpm to the .orig directory.
Exceptions are only taken into account at package build time), but
exclude it from the binary .deb.

Is this possible, too? Is it allowed to have precompiled binaries in
debian .orig.tar.gz?

Anyway, I have started to add dpatch support for all the packages, and
just fix these wrong locations with a dpatch.

I could fix it in the Perforce TeXlive depot, but with the next update
from upstream = CTAN it would be gone again. SO for debian I use dpatch.

;-) For now I don't want to discuss this with up-up-stream (not TeX
live, but with the authors). I leave it as dpatch in debian.

What files are these?  Either they are not in fact
architecture-dependent, than they deserve a lintian override, or they
are, then they shouldn't be in an arch=all package.

I would prefer to keep it in the source package.  This makes it much
more usefull - you can actually use it, e.g., to prepare patches to
submit to the package authors, which is hard with a generated *.sty
file.  And we also had bug reports that asked whether we couldn't build
tetex-base from the dtx files, well that'd make up a nice circular
build-dependency, but in principle the wish is understandable.

> - Leave the source stuff out of the binary package only

For teTeX, we have a separate tetex-src package that installs the dtx
files etc.

> - Leave it in source and binary, and ignore lintian errors

If there are good reasons to ignore them, yes.  Scripts with wrong paths
in /usr/share/texmf/source, i.e. that aren't meant to be run on the
system, are a good reason, I'd say.

> - Leave it in source and binary and try to hack all errors

That could be the ultimate goal (and would proably lead to more portable
scripts on CTAN), but it isn't necessary before uploading to Debian.  It
isn't even necessary before releasing as part of Debian stable.

    Anyway, I have started to add dpatch support for all the packages, and
    just fix these wrong locations with a dpatch.

It seems problematic to me to make Debian TL have source changes which
do not exist in the original TL.  Is this really a path we want to go down?

It will lead to the same pseudo-forking as occurs for everything else in
the Linux distributions -- changes get made, never get propagated back.
So there are different versions floating around.  This can only increase
confusion and trouble.

Of course I know perfectly well that it takes tons and tons of time to
send changes back to upstream, and I don't blame you for not wanting to
do it.  So are these changes really important?  Why spend your time
working on these things simply to quiet some tool, when they have
existed for many years and no one has complained?  Aren't there more
important things to be working on?

It is allowed, at least if it is possible to compile them from the
sources themselves, which is obviously the case.  The suggestion to
remove it is just a safeguard to prevent accidental "successful" package
building.  I would really do it; if not in the orig.tar.gz (which seems
sensible), then in the clean target.

If you detected it and prepared patches, you've done a good part of the
work.  Somebody else can take over.  It would be good to keep a list of
patched packages somewhere.  Thus, if we contact upstream anyway, say
because of a LaTeX problem in their package, we can notify them of this
problem, too.

I agree.  A patch in Debian should either be really Debian-specific
(e.g. dvipdfm(x) uses libpaper (which doesn't seem to exist elsewhere) to
get a default papersize), or it should be submitted to the responsible
upstream person.  

You won't be able to forget those problems, lintian will keep you
informed.  Therefore you can delay fixing them to when you have time to
contact upstream responsibles, too.

Hi all!

Lot of discussion about some very small stuff:

On Die, 02 Aug 2005, Karl Berry wrote:

No, of course not.

Don't get over the border, please. YOu know that I am feeding everything
back to TeX live.

> do it.  So are these changes really important?  Why spend your time

Well, this is something I can not answer at the moment. I am not a
proper DD, I want to submit this stuff `as close as possible to the
original TeX live' to Debian.

I don't want any split at all. But there are some requirements, at least
in the documentation I have read. Maybe, as the saying goes in german,
`it is less hot eaten then cooked', these things are not important, but
a priori I don't know.

> working on these things simply to quiet some tool, when they have

It is all about infrastructure, too. With all this debian packaging I
have already corrected a whole bunch of errors in tpm files, found
missing pieces etc etc. I just fix them in the depot and don't talk
about. And as soon as it is easy to fix something for me, and I create a
diff or something, I try to feed it back to TeX live.

With regard to changes to files in source/... I don't WANT to feed it
directly back to TeX live, since the next upgrade will eradicate my
changes.

I have to submit it up-upstream as I would say.

BUt to calm everybody down: Here are the two patches I have, up to now,
used as dpatches. SO everybody can see what I am talking about, and
maybe that we are ATM loosing much more time over trivialities then
necessary:
texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/wsuipa/compilefonts
	Comment the part that describes the shell script. THis is
	a shell script with a long description at the end. I have
	only put comment signs in front of the description

texmf-dist/source/latex/calendar/mkaddr.tcl
-#!/usr/local/bin/tclsh
+#!/usr/bin/tclsh

texmf-dist/source/latex/wordcount/wordcount.sh
-#! /usr/bin/sh
+#! /bin/sh

and these three files are not included into a debian package (but are
present in the debian source package)
file:texmf-dist/source/latex/splitindex/splitindex-Linux-i386:BLACKLIST:
file:texmf-dist/source/latex/splitindex/splitindex-OpenBSD-i386:BLACKLIST:
file:texmf-dist/source/latex/splitindex/splitindex.exe:BLACKLIST:

With these changes I get all the arch=all packages lintian clean (at
least what errors concerns). THere are a lot of warning I will work on
next.

> If you detected it and prepared patches, you've done a good part of the

Patches will accumulate in
	DEPOT/Master/debian/dpatch/<collection-name>
and everybody is invited to contact upstream ;-)

Message-ID: <20050802151648.GB7765@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!

To make sure that problems occuring while packaging TeX live for Debian
are reported back, here is a list of warnings found by lintian. Some of
the warnings are irrelevant for us, but others seem to be interesting
and maybe should be fixed in the depot, in upstream, or in the
conversion scripts.

binary-without-manpage:
-----------------------
	lintian moans about missing man pages. If someone knows about
	the existence of man pages for these tools, please contact me.
	Maybe I take a look into tetex for debian.
altpdfamstex
altpdfcontext
cslatex
csplain
fdf2tan
mex
mptopdf
pdfcslatex
pdfcsplain
pdfmex
pdfplatex
perltex
physe
phyzzx
platex
texsis
utf8mex

configure-generated-file-in-source:
-----------------------------------
	Probably irrelevant, but what has this file to do in the source
	distribution?
texmf-dist/source/plain/pdcmac/config.status

executable-not-elf-or-script:
-----------------------------
	These four files have the executable bit set, which is
	definitely useless. I don't know wether this comes from
	the ctan2tds script or from upstream.
texmf/bibtex/bib/iopart-num/iopart-num-example.bib
texmf/bibtex/bst/iopart-num/iopart-num.bst
texmf/source/latex/ebsthesis/ebsthesis.dtx
texmf/source/latex/ebsthesis/ebsthesis.ins

manpage-has-bad-whatis-entry:
-----------------------------
	from lintian:
N:   Each manual page should start with a `NAME' section, which lists the
N:   name and a brief description of the page seperated by '\-'. These
N:   sections are parsed by `mandb' and stored in a database for the use of
N:   `apropos' and `whatis', so they must be in a certain format. This
N:   manual page apparently uses the wrong format and cannot be parsed by
N:   `mandb'.
man/man1/vlna.1.gz

unusual-interpreter:
--------------------
	Irrelevant. This is a good interpreter, we know this.
	Probably only simplify-rename.pe should also get fontforge!

zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory:
--------------------------------
	This is something which really is interesting. ALL these files
	have 0 byte. Ok, for some of them (VERSION-1.1) it might be ok
	as the name is the information, but for some other files this
	really looks fishy.

If you tell a possible sponsor (the DD that does the upload): "We have
discussed these lintian errors/warnings on the upstream mailing list,
and decided that I will not fix them without discussing the changes
needed with the 'real' upstream authors." I don't think anybody will
refuse to upload based on these lintian errors.

The script doesn't need the comment signs, because it has a "exit 0"
statement before that?  In this case I'd say lintian is wrong, and I'd
use an override.  At least I'm not sure whether I would accept such a
patch if I were upstream.

If it is only deleted in the binary package, it's a Debian-specific
issue anyway that doesn't need any upstream change.

I was thinking more of a list sorted by directories on CTAN or the
like.  So that when I'm going to write the author of wordcount.tex, I can
see on a single browser page that I should tell him about the strange
path in wordcount.sh - without clicking through patches against various
debian packages.

Ok, probably the others, too. It is just good to think about it once!

Seems it's the only thing I can say something useful about...

Have a look at 

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-tetex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/copyright?op=file&rev=0&sc=0
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-tetex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/Copyright.Files?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-tetex/tetex-base/trunk/debian/unclear_license?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

There's work to be done, and probably much of it will be useful for both
teTeX and tex-live.

Hi all!

I just found out that the option
	--without-packagename
in source.development/configure does not really work. Even if I deselct
several packages with these options, they are still compiled.

Can someone with auto* knowledge take a look into this, thanks a lot!

(Side note: today I build the first debian package including binaries
automatically from Master/source.development etc).

Hi Norbert,

            --without-packagename
    in source.development/configure does not really work. Even if I deselct
    several packages with these options, they are still compiled.

1) Specifics please, i.e., which packages?  I can at least glance at it
   for five minutes, but if I don't see anything ...

2) Does it really matter?  Why do you want to build only some packages,
   can you just build everything?  Life is short.

Forget it Karl, thanks, but I decided that you are right ... (as always

It is loaded by users who want it, after \usepackage{german}.  BTW, why
after - and what about babel, which activates lots of stuff only at
\begin{document}?

Message-ID: <20050804143902.GA12466@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!

A new generation of Debian packages of TeX live are available, as soon
as the rsync prozess is finished. Please see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
All packages come with source (!new!) and binary packages for
i386-linux. In a nutshell, add (attention, changed from previous form!)
	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
to your /etc/apt/sources.list, and then
	apt-get update
	apt-get install texlive-latexrecommended

The arch=all packages are more or less lintian and pbuilder clean. With
respect to the texlive-binaries-source Debian source package there are
still several open items (missing man pages, not compressed man pages,
errors in the man pages, missing Build-Depends for sure, etc).

You can browse the output of lintian -i -v, pbuilder and
dpkg-buildpackage of most packages in 
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/

I would like you - if you have time and energy - to:
- Check the binaries for useability, problems with installation etc
- for DD: check the debian sources/binaries and comment on them

I expect that there are still several problems/inconsistencies with
regards to the packaging, please report!

Best wishes

Norbert

Message-ID: <200508042342.j74Ngij14380@tug.org>

Olaf and Martin have released new, hopefully-final (I think), versions
of web2c, kpathsea, and pdftex.  Thanks!

So I submitted new i386-linux binaries, until Staszek has a chance to do
it on his older machine.

Tigran, Gerben, Norbert, Manfred, Sebastian, Olaf, Vladimir -- it would
be good to try building on your respective architectures.

Plus Windows, of course.  I'm not sure where that stands, if xemtex also
has pdftex 1.30.0, if the same pool/fmt files will work, etc.  Fabrice,
help?

I cannot rebuild the images right now:
  not well-formed (invalid token) at line 20, column 1, byte 742 at
  /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/i686-linux/XML/Parser.pm line 187
Seems to be somewhere in texmf. I'll try to look into it tomorrow unless
someone (Sebastian) beats me to it.  Please :)? 

And then there is:
  Wide character in print at /home/karl/src/Master/Tools/Tpm.pm line 551.
also in texmf.  Likely the same thing, I suppose.

(It is so annoying that the relevant filenames are not reported.)

Because the file simply contains a big \hyphenation {} pattern,
nothing else -- it doesn't explicitly switch to German.

You have to load the file where German is active, perhaps with

  \begin{otherlanguage}{german}
    \input{dehyphtex}
  \end{otherlanguage}

Hi,

Karl and I had a bit of private email about this, it seems the binaries
need a static libstdc++.so to be usable everywhere. This worked for
pdf[e]tex:

  ./Build --with-cpp-runtime-hack

But it seems that the configure from the lcdf_typetools package
doesn't understand that switch.  :-(

That reminds me of something unrelated: Recently, I have had to
make -i world because something in texinfo fails (don't kow how
to make version.texi) Is this known/my fault, or should I attempt
to isolate the error precisely?

Cheers, Taco

Comment/suggestions:
-- as dehyphtex.tex is ISO-Latin1 encoded file this may end
   in portability problem when using different input encoding.
-- as 
   -- the list is rather huge (which actually shows that it is
   time to regenerate the patterns from scratch similarly as
   for English), 
   and 
   -- is consulted by TeX for every word to be hyphenated
   and
   -- may cause troubles with the size of hyph_size
   I'd suggest as a temporary solution either 
   a) making new version of dehypht.tex such that dehyphtex.tex is 
   converted to additional patterns in such a way that
   -- . is addres to the both beginning and end of every word exception
   -- 8 is added at the wrong positions
   -- 7 is added at the good positions.
   or
   b) using patgen with dehypht.tex patterns and dehyphtex list as
   input and generationg two new passes covering the new words
   (slightly more tricky but more space effective solution than a)).

This would have advantages:
-- it is much quicker (no need to read dehyphtex.tex in every run
   of German document), leaving exception dictionary empty for user's
   exceptions
-- it is more portable (using the encoding of dehypht.tex) and encoding
   problems free
-- people would not have to think of adding dehyphtex.tex into 
   every German document
WDYT?

     --with-cpp-runtime-hack

The string "cpp-runtime-hack" does not appear anywhere in the current
sources in TeX Live, BTW.  Oh, looking at web2c/configure.in, it seems
to be --with-cxx-runtime-hack.  (I hate C++.)

Anyway, my recent build did statically link libstdc++ (and the other
libraries) into the pdfetex binary.

    But it seems that the configure from the lcdf_typetools package
    doesn't understand that switch.  :-(

Hardly surprising.  We will have to insert similar kludges for that;
I'll see if I can do that unless someone else can work on it.  (I hate
C++.  Dynamic libraries too.  Life used to be simpler.)

Staszek's build will probably go against libstdc++ v5, which is better
but not good enough, since Taco reported that Mandriva may ship without
v5, with *only* v6.  It's nice to see such concern for compatibility :(.
Sheesh.

(BTW, last year's lcdf binaries also dynamically linked against

    because something in texinfo fails (don't kow how

Texinfo builds fine for me.  version.texi exists in my original
distribution as an up-to-date file; it should not need to get rebuilt.
Maybe your timestamps are munged.

The v5 is in the distribution of course, but it is quite possible (and
becoming increasingly likely as time passes) that it will not have been
installed (by the user|installation program).

v5 has been with us a long time. But I remember similar headaches
from the previous libstdc++ transition, when v5 first appeared on
the scene.

Quite possible. It would not be the first time. I'll try fetching the
branch again with "force" and see if that helps.

Actually, it uses T1 encoding.

Both suggestions sound interesting, but I don't have time to do that.
The list of exceptions currently available in dehyphtex.tex is only
about 20% of what I already have collected meanwhile -- due to more
urgent work I can't continue right now.

Well, there is still the unsolved problem how to tag hyphenation

I got some build breakage with pdfopen, due to what looks like an
improper Makefile.am:

Change 7656 by olaf@olaf on 2005/08/05 19:18:34

        Put libraries (-lX11 ...) in LDADD, not in AM_LDFLAGS.  This because
        AM_LDFLAGS will be put before the objects when linking, which means
        that some linkers will not search those libraries to resolve symbols
        from the program's objects.
        Since my version of automake differs, I also had to regenerate
        aclocal.m4.

I'm testing TL2005 on Redhat Fedora Core 4 with Redhat's tetex.  Both packages
create generated formats in $HOME/.texmf-var/web2c, so when the .pool files
differ you get errors when switching between packages.  I'm used to switching
between TeX packages pretty dynamically using environment modules to manage the
PATH setting.  The simple fix is to change texmf.cnf to use something like
$HOME/.tl2005/texmf-var, etc.

It is important that TL2005 play nicely with tetex-3 because some packages have
dependencies on tetex-3 (to format documentation).

one way to proceed would be to make RPMs for texlive
which did the same job as tetex. This is almost complete,
for Debian, so RPM would not be that big a job.

personally, I don't think TL should work around things as you
suggest. it would be much better to NOT mix and match binaries,
surely?

I can only support Sebastians comment, and if you really need to do this
kind of switching, make the change in texmf.cnf yourself.

Isn't there a tool like "equivs" for rpm?  That is, something that
creates a fake package to tell the system that the dependency is
fulfilled?

Playing nicely with other packages has been a feature of teTeX, and by
association, TeX Live.  If there are good reasons to recommend that TeX Live
not be installed without removing the vendor package, they need to be
explained.
Here is my list:

1.  historically, vendors have done a poor job of maintaining tex packages

2.  if you work with a GUI front end and menus rather than the shell, you can't
change the environment seen by programs such as emacs dynamically, so you are
effectively limited to one tex package.

I've been told that if I want to have multiple TeX distos I have to use WinXP,
but this seems to be because each disto is associated with a different editor,
e.g., xemacs for fptex (now xemtex), WinEDT for mikTeX.

I've already done that, so if I'm the only one who wants both vendor tetex and
TeX Live, the problem is solved.  If someone else has the problem, they can
check the archives for the fix.

I prefer to keep the rpm database "honest", but it's good to have another
workaround in the record.

Hi Alex, hi Frank! Hi all!

ATM a new set of binaries and sources are uploaded to tug.org. They
should be there in about 3h, see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

The packages are now in a state that I would like to ask DD to take a
decent look, especially Alex, as he has volunteered to mentor me.

BUT: If there are other DD, PLEASE also take a look and comment on the
packages, there are 66 source packages and 79 binary packages, i.e. a
lot of work, although all the arch=all packages are all build more or
less the same way, and the arch=any all from one source package.

I have build all the source packages in a pbuilder-sid box, so the
Build-Depends are ok.

I have checked the packages with lintian and linda (linda didn't give
anything different from lintian). I attach to this email the file
lintian.log which is a compilation of the warnings and errors which have
been reported by lintian, ordered by error/warning tags. 
The only error is in fact not an error, but misinterpretation, as this 
script uses a funny perl/sh header to get perl whereever it is installed.

For now I consider these warnings as not severe enough, but you are
welcome to argue for/against this opinion.

On www.tug.org there are in fact not only the debian source and binary
packages, but also a bit set of log files in
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
namely
	collection-*.build.log
		Output of the build process using tpm2deb.pl and
		dpkg-buildpackage
	texlive-*_version.lintian.log
		the output of lintian texlive-*_version.changes
	lintian.log
		the compilation of lintian.log files ordered by
		error/warning tags and pkgs.

Alex, Frank: What do you mean, should I also ask on debian-mentor for
comments, as there are so many packages? Alex, do you need/want support
in this?

Best wishes

Norbert

[snipped]

I'm putting in my 2 cents as a user.

I started using texlive (instead of tetex) on a new notebook pc for a
couples of days without any problem. As it is, texlive conflicts with
the tetex stuff -- tetex-bin, ... and texlive-texinfo conflicts with
texinfo. However, there are debian packages that depends on them. Is it
correct to say that now texlive provides the capabilities of at least
tetex-bin, tetex-base and texinfo? (I think so but I'm not 100% sure.)
If so, it would be great if it can be worked out that the dependency can
now be provided by texlive (texlive-basicbin provides tetex-bin, for
example). Perhaps this has to involve the tetex maintainers as well.

A big thanks for the deb packages.

ST

Provides works only for virtual packages (or for packages that
disappear, Conflicts/Replaces/Provides), and tetex-bin is obviously not
a virtual package, it's quite real.

So the solution would be to file bugs against the packages that depend
on one of the tetex-packages, or texinfo, and ask to add to the Depends
on the respective texlive package as an alternative, as in 

before:
Depends: texinfo 
after:
Depends: texinfo | texlive-texinfo

Of course it would be best to really check that the texlive package
provides the complete functionality.  E.g. if a package depends on
tetex-extra because it needs two style files that are in separate
texlive packages, it would be

before:
Depends: tetex-extra
after:
Depends: tetex-extra | texlive-foo, tetex-extra | texlive-bar

please be sure to put the texlive packages after the or bar |, so that
the buildd continue using tetex.


As for texinfo, the package in Debian is missing texi2pdf and therefore
prevents teTeX-3.0 from entering unstable until it is updated.  If you
(Norbert and Alex) think the texlive-texinfo package is okay (maybe I'll
have a look at it this evening), then please consider contacting the
texinfo maintainer in Debian for taking over texinfo, and/or uploading
the package to the NEW queue.

Is there a list of tetex-base/tetex-extra packages? If yes I could check
wether all packages in tetex are also in texlive, and in which
sub-package.

Sure.

(Alex is not subscribed to any of these lists, I suppose).

The problem is that texinfo depends on texlive-basic, which in turn
depends on texlive-basicbin and texlive-documentation-base, so this
would need to pull in all the texlive packages.

Well, a bit early without review.

Might be early, but on the other hand preparing an upload for a new
upstream version of the traditional texinfo package is probably a lot of
work, too - while you have done most of it already.  And I don't have
the impression that Josip is particularly interested in texinfo
currently. 

I had a look at texlive-texinfo, here are a few remarks:

- drop the empty preinst

- a manpage for texinfo and pdftexinfo is missing

- is usr/share/texmf/fmtutil/format.texinfo.cnf at its place on purpose?
  It seems to be a copy of /etc/texmf/fmt.d/50texlive-texinfo.cnf

- do the tpm files in /usr/share/texmf/tpm serve any purpose?

- the info file in /usr/share/doc/texlive-texinfo/info should be put at
  its proper place and registered to the info system;  see
  dh_installinfo(1). 

- I wouldn't put the pdf and html file put into a subdirectory, but
  directly into /usr/share/doc/texlive-texinfo/info.  And don't you have
  texdoc or a similar program?  Then you should either put those files
  into $TEXMF/doc (in teTeX this is a symlink to /usr/share/doc/texmf,
  and we should keep this consistent), or create symlinks so that they
  can be found.

- why do you conflict with tetex-src - you don't install any 
  files in /usr/share/texmf/source, do you?

Overall, this looks as if it shouldn't be too hard to make this a
replacement for the traditional Debian texinfo package.  I don't know
Josip's plans about it, but in case he is not interested, uploading this
as texinfo is probably as easy or easier than doing an update of the
texinfo package.  It shouldn't be too hard to disable the build of all
other packages.

I wonder whether texdoc's default of TEXDOCVIEW_pdf should be really
acroread.  Why not xpdf on platforms where it is available?  I further
suggest that the format of the TEXDOCVIEW_xxx variables is explained
in the --help output.

Well, I wanted a list of CTAN packages, but this will work, too, I
guess.

Ok.

Are the in the original distribution? If not, do you have them in tetex?
If yes, can I copy them?

Yup, every tpm can contain a Execute-directive to create a format,
together with a name string, in this case texinfo. The deb-source
creation program and/or the deb build program (both tpm2pl) use this to
collect *all* format snippets of one collection (texlive-...) for this
package. In this case there is only one, but there could be more.

> - do the tpm files in /usr/share/texmf/tpm serve any purpose?

Yes. They describe the packages. In fact they are used to install the
resepctive files from the perforce depot into the debian-source-packjage
and from the debian source package into the binary tree. I could leave
them out of the binary packages, but they may serve some good use,
especially as they describe which CTAN packages are part of a
collection.

Hmmm, yup. This seems to be some work in the script, but probably not
too much. I don't want to do anything by hand, you know! Up to now all
the source-packages and binary-packages are generated automatically from
the tpm2deb.pl script, which has as few exceptions as possible.

I will see, should be possible.

Ahhh, good hint. Up to now I thought that I install all the DocFiles (a
category in the tpm files) into /usr/share/doc/debname/... instead of
/usr/share/texmf/doc/... were the originally are present. 

This means I can leave the files in the place they are normally, and
also create this link. Thanks!

Not in texlive-texinfo, but in other collections. We decided here on the
list that the packages come with their source.

Again, as above. Some one should review at least:
	texlive-basic
	texlive-basicbin
	texlive-documentation-base
which texlive-texinfo depends on (directly or indirectly).

In fact I thought about splitting texlive-texinfo into a separate
source-package, but for the time being it was just easier to get it
running and source extracted like this. I can make a seperate source
package, is this what we want?

Would it be possible to install the (texlive-)texinfo package together
with tetex? Would this work out?

AFAIK, updmap.cfg can be generated automatically, right?  Please do
that, together with a regeneration of all map files.  Otherwise,
here's a patch.

I thought they would be in the texinfo package, and

of course, since it's free software.  But the manpage is missing also in
the texinfo package.  Well, it's not so severe, since there is
texinfo(5) and the info, pdf, and html files.

But doesn't this mean that the file is only useful up to the point where
the deb file has been created, with the 50texlive-texinfo.cnf file in
it, and is useless in the installed texmf tree?  Then why not remove it?

It would be nice to collect the information from these files and put
them into the long description field in the debian/control file.  But
after this has been done, I'd say they are superfluous (on an installed
system) and shouldn't be in the binary package.

You can create debian/<package>.info automatically (just look for info
files in the respective trees).

According to policy, the documentation should be in/below
/usr/share/doc/debname/.  Therefore you should in fact make a symlink
from there to /usr/share/doc/texmf/<someplace>.

I would suggest to put it on your TODO list, less important items, to
sort this out and drop conflicts that aren't needed.

It does work.  I just tried in a clean sid pbuilder chroot with
teTeX-3.0 from experimental installed:

dpkg -r --force-depends texinfo # because of a bug in texinfo,
                                # tetex-base still depends on
                                # texinfo instead of the other
                                # way round
dpkg --force-depends --force-conflicts -i \
   texlive-texinfo_2005.08.08-1_i386.deb

After that, I have succesfully created html, dvi, pdf, and info files
from dvips.texi.

I would like to  propose
#define FMT_SUFFIXES ".fmt",".nfmt"
because others are not used any more.

done.
tpm files and the fmtutil/* files are present in the source package, but
not in the binary package.
(This is the good thing of having a cfg file for the generation process
where you can specify a hell lot of actions ;-)

done.
info files are installed into /usr/share/info with install-info via

So to be sure: The real files *MUST* exist in /usr/share/doc/debname/
and the files in /usr/share/doc/texmf/... are symbolic links. True?

On the TODO list, but takes some time.

The direction of the symlink doesn't matter.  There's a "should" clause
in the Policy for /usr/share/doc/debname/, and there's a "must" clause
in texdoc'c code; but IMO both can be satisfied if the files can be
found at both places; the physical location doesn't matter.

There are no texinfo(1) and pdftexinfo(1) man pages in the original
Texinfo distribution -- because the original distribution does not

As the change says, all I did was run tlrebuild, which runs update-tpm,
which automatically rebuilds everything using tpm-factory.pl.

Apparently Sebastian's new tool now writes things in a somewhat
different format than before (he changed it recently at my request to
avoid 8-bit chars in the tpm's).  Hopefully he can re-munge it so that
the tools don't fight ...

Ok, now I have all the files in
	/usr/share/texmf/doc/...
and symlinks from
	/usr/share/doc/package/... to /usr/share/texmf/doc

(BTW, sidenote: Frank, did you mean /usr/share/doc/texmf and not
/usr/share/texmf/doc? In texcommon there is TEXDOCS = .;$TEXMF/doc//)

Furthermore, I have installed all the info files. Now:

. Since the doc files are *not* present anymore in
  /usr/share/doc/package/... dh_compress leave them uncompressed.
  Is this OK?

. Can I leave the info files also in /usr/share/texmf/doc/.... where
  they are present in TeX live, or should they not installed into TEXMF;
  and only into /usr/share/info?

Well, that's it. More suggestions from your side?

Best wishes

In teTeX in Debian the physical path is /usr/share/doc/texmf, and there
is a symlink

/usr/share/texmf/doc -> ../doc/texmf

so that the TEXDOCS setting above will work.  I don't know the reasons,
but it doesn't seem to be a problem anywhere, and therefore I never
considered changing this.  Because of the behavior of dpkg, switching a
symlink to a dir is a complicated, error-prone process even if the
change is only at one place (e.g. in woody we had 

/usr/share/texmf/web2c/ -> /var/lib/texmf/web2c

and now we have both as directories).  I think it will be even more
difficult to actually switch target and location of a symlink.  

Therefore, unless somebody comes up with a really convincing argument,
I'd just keep it as it is, and the texlive packages should do the same
(otherwise dpkg will have inconsistent information).

Should have read this earlier.  This *is* a good reason for putting the
files into /usr/share/doc/texmf, not /usr/share/texmf/doc.

> . Can I leave the info files also in /usr/share/texmf/doc/.... where

I think they should be removed from the TEXMF tree - everybody who knows
that they can point info on a file with a full pathname will also be
able to find them where they belong; everybody else will just say "info"
and start browsing, or "info program".

Can someone give me an idea how to cope with the following problem:

Files are installed into /usr/share/doc/pkgname/...

Links are created in /usr/share/texmf/doc/... to /usr/share/doc/pkgname/...

dh_compress is called, files in /usr/share/doc/pkgname are compressed.

But I guess dh_compress does not care for the link?

Is there a way that the links in /usr/share/texmf/doc/ do not come out
as dangling symlinks to the uncompressed files?

Just link complete directories:

Umpf, sorry to bugger you that often:

> /usr/share/doc/texmf/latex/latexextra -> ../../latexextra/

Hopefully all the directories are `separate' in the sense that no two
packages install files (not directories) into the same directory.
Hopefully.

So we have
. /usr/share/doc/pkgname/...		
	contains the actual files
. /usr/share/doc/texmf/
	contains some directories and some symlinks to directories in
	/usr/share/doc/pkgname (as I said, hope this works, will
	implement it now and see ;-)
. /usr/share/texmf/doc -> ../doc/texmf

Is it the way it should be?

I haven't looked at the structure of your arch:all packages yet, but it
seems to me that this shouldn't be too difficult.  

Either a package has only one documentation directory
/usr/share/doc/pkgname/ and one symlink
/usr/share/doc/texmf/{latex/}pkgname.

Or it contains a collection of CTAN directories, then you can simply
organise it like this:

/usr/share/doc/pkgname/styleone
/usr/share/doc/pkgname/styletwo
/usr/share/doc/pkgname/stylethree
/usr/share/doc/pkgname/somefont
/usr/share/texmf/latex/styleone ->
/usr/share/texmf/latex/styletwo ->
/usr/share/texmf/latex/stylethree ->
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/somefont ->

Yes it is, indeed it works, I have written a quick script to check for
this.
$ generate_duplicate_docdirs
$ cat duplicate-docdirs.txt

This is good.

Two times .afm is not a problem really, but you're right that in the
web2c code none but .fmt are used these days.  Where does .nfmt come
from?

Subject: [tex-live] simplifying installation of user-licensed fonts
Message-ID: <200508122306.j7CN6gc00988@tug.org>

A number of interesting fonts are only available under licenses which
allow users to install them (with no charge or restriction), but which
do not permit modification and/or free redistribution, so we don't
include them in TL.

The main ones I know about are garamond and lettergothic from GhostPCL,
Utopia, and LuxiMono.  All these packages (including pfb's) are on CTAN.

What I'm wondering is if someone would like to write a script or make a
distribution of these fonts, so that users can easily add them.  I think
they should end up installed in $TEXMFLOCAL (by default).  The map files
are probably the main complication, that is, adding the relevant entries
to updmap.cfg (and rerunning updmap).

Any takers?

Thanks,
Karl

Message-ID: <200508122349.j7CNn7621039@tug.org>

After discussing the situation with Thomas, we feel that we should in
fact change TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR to use an identifier in the
directory name, following George's note.

To restate the principle: in the past, teTeX (as installed in GNU/Linux
distributions) and TL (as installed by users) could happily coexist.
teTeX was in the system dirs, and TL was wherever the user put it, eg,
/usr/local/texlive, the user set their path to whichever they wanted.  I
think it's critical that this continue to work, since it has always been
the standard way to install the distributions.

The general idea of one package writing a .fmt (or updmap.cfg or
whatever) into these directories, and then another package reading it,
will not work.  It is not just a matter of teTeX vs. TL -- there will
also be a problem with future releases of either, e.g., .fmt's from
TL2005 will not work with TL2006.

Therefore I've changed TEXMFVAR and TEXMFCONFIG in the default TL
texmf.cnf to use $HOME/.texlive2005/texmf-whatever.  Thomas has said
he'll use something like $HOME/.teTeX-3.1 in his next release.

Comments/alternatives welcome.

(Having these new user-based directories for "system" files will
definitely be this year's #1 confusion/problem.)

Yes, the world is sorely lacking in happy coexistence/playing nicely these
days, so keep what we already have!

Confusion can be healthy if it leads to correct rethinking.

Many experienced teTeX users will be surprised to find tex putting .fmt files
in
their home directories.  It may, however, seem natural to the poor VISTA
(VIrus,
Spyware, Trojan, and Ad-ware) refugee fleeing the M$ empire and struggling to
find a home in the linux world, so the problems will come when they consult
co-author X (who has been using linux for years) for advice.

On Windows, many TeX users equate TeX with an editing environment (e.g.
winedt/miktex or xemacs/tl2003).  A non-rivial number of people with multiple
documents in preparation use multiple TeX distros, e.g., winedt/miktex because
co-author Y uses that and xemacs/tl2003 because co-author X uses texlive on
linux.  I find many of these (invariably LaTeX) documents actually compile fine
on the other system, but the author had a bad experience several versions ago
and concluded that tex distros are incompatible. 

I suppose it is time for a bit of higher-profile discussion of where TeX
is today -- something along the lines of an article in SIAM News -- to let
people know that TeX distro authors are interested in:

1.  happy coexistence/playing nicely
2.  internationalization
3.  open source freedoms

and also to warn people of the pitfalls of relying on the linux distro's 
tex package.

    The binaries

      cfftot1 mmafm mmpfb otfinfo otftotfm t1dotlessj t1lint t1reencode
      t1testpage

    in `bin/i386-linux' link to libstdc++.so.6 -- I don't have this, only
    libstdc++.so.5, and my system is a bit older than a year.

I took a look today at importing the --with-cxx-runtime-hack stuff from
web2c, which statically links libstdc++, with lcdf-typetools.  Anything
is possible, I suppose, but it is not exactly straightforward.
lcdf-typetools uses Automake, and for the hack to work, it obviously has
to change the link command.  The result would not be pretty from the
point of view of maintaining lcdftools, I'm afraid.

Since we have always distributed the lcdftools binaries dynamically
linked before, I am inclined to just keep doing that, despite it being
suboptimal.  At least when Staszek builds the binaries, it will be
against libstdc++ v5 instead of v6.

Of course, if anyone has any suggestions or time to investigate further,
that would be welcome.  For the record, the configure code is around
line 185 of web2c/configure.in
(http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source.development/TeX/texk/web2c/configure.in)
(search for runtime_hack), and then it's used in (among other places),
the pdfetex: rule in pdfetex.mk
(http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source.development/TeX/texk/web2c/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.mk).

There's one more problem:  C++ code compiled with Gcc-3.3 and older is
not binary-compatible with C++ code compiled with gcc-4.0 (and I think
3.4, too).  Debian is just making both transitions (libstdc++ v5 to v6,
gcc-3.3 to gcc-4.0) together, and other distros might have done or will
do the same. 

So it might turn out that even when you use v5 to allow running on older
systems, people won't be able to use it on newer systems where v5 is
still available, but has been recompiled with a newer gcc.

I'm not really familiar with these things, but I can look up some pages
explaing this, although somewhat Debian-specific, in my bookmarks.

FWIW, the IRIX build of lcdf-typetools with MIPSpro compilers is
broken, because it uses 'ar' to create some convenience libraries,
where 'CC -ar' is required to get some C++ templates properly
instantiated.

Using libtool might resolve this, but being lazy about this I just
have my own buildscript that uses 'sed' after configure to fix up the
makefiles in question.

I need to do something similar with the xdvi makefile, as the
configure script happens to find iconv on the machine I build on, but
shouldn't be linking against it, and the most convenient way to
suppress this again turned out to be to edit the generated makefile.
(Another way would be to set up a chroot build environment.)

While this kind of quick and dirty hack is definitely not ideal and
somewhat fragile, it does have the advantage of being implementable on
short notice, and without requiring a rewrite of the auto* stuff of
lcdf-typetools itself.

Summary     : Compatibility standard C++ libraries
Description :
The libstdc++ package contains compatibility standard C++ library
from GCC 3.3.4.
/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5
/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5.0.7

In my experience, these are rarely installed, and most users won't know to
install them unless explicitly instructed to do so.

TeX Live maintainer time is a precious resource, so the first priority should
be
a tl distro that builds and runs on systems tl maintainers use without tricky
hacks that will only cause trouble next eyar.  The 2nd should be to ensure that
it builds and runs on other "sufficiently common" systems.  

A few years ago, building tl on linux was a big deal.  Many users were running
linux on older hardware that was too old for Windows, with small disks and
memory. Compiling a big package could be an adventure.  My guess is that 
most libstdc++.so.6 linux system can build tl2005 from source with little
effort.  

This argues for tl binaries targeted for libstdc++.so.5, and a recommendation
that libstdc++.so.6 systems either install the vendor's compatibility libraries
or install the vendor's compilers and development libraries and compile the
sources.

    v5 is still available, but has been recompiled with a newer gcc. 

Argh.  Wouldn't it be better to distribute a libstdc++.5 compiled with
gcc 3, so that the (millions of) existing binaries continue to work?

Anyway, that's your bailiwick, of course.  For our purposes, Thomas
suggested that we change the gcc specs file on the build machine to link
libstdc++ statically, which should be far simpler than messing with
auto* stuff in the lcdftools source.  Naturally in gcc 4 they don't even
make that easy (no specs file by default any more), but it should still
be possible.  I'll work with Staszek on that front and see what happens.

Thanks,
Karl

Hi Manfred, Gerben, all,

I guess I should have mentioned that the current sources are in
source.development.  Olaf made some fixes last night in the course of
updating mips-irix, so the last change which needs to be included at
this point is #7721 on 2005/08/13 13:07:22.  Gerben, sorry, I don't know
what time zone that is or how to translate into yours.

Anyway, besides p4, the sources can be retrieved by rsync:
  rsync -a --exclude Images \
    tug.org::tldevsrc/Build/source.development/TeX/texk/web2c .
Or http:
  wget -np --mirror \
    http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source.development/TeX/texk/web2c

(There have been a few more changes since 7721, which will neither harm
nor help a build.)


Meanwhile, I noticed that i386-linux and alpha-linux have two
executables which are not in the new mips-irix set: utf8mex and ttf2tex.

For ttf2tex, it seems this is something that just got thrown in "by
hand" last year.  I'll see if I can get the package in the tree
properly, if it's still relevant.

For utf8mex, I realize I am not exactly sure what creates symlinks to
pdfetex.  Will have to look that up, unless someone else can point me ...


FYI, Fabrice told me that he hopes to update the Windows binaries at the
end of August.

Best,
Karl

FWIW, the way I build on IRIX is that I remove all the directories
stuff gets installed to before doing the 'make world'.  Then I copy
the installed binaries and links into the Master tree.

As part of this, a fmtutil.cnf derived from TeX/texk/web2c/fmtutil.in
gets installed in texmf/web2c before the formats are generated.  The
"official" texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf contains a line for utf8mex, which
is missing in fmtutil.in in the source tree.  (There are also some
gratuitous whitespace differences.)

Ah!

Many thanks, I added utf8mex there, and fixed the stupid whitespace
differences.  Hope that won't cause any trouble.

Do we really need to derive fmtutil.cnf from fmtutil.in?  The only
difference seems to be omega/aleph stuff, which I assume is omitted if
omega/aleph aren't built, but in practice we always build them, so ... ?
It would be a lot easier to just compare the files byte for byte, that
could be easily automated.

Thanks,

    v5 is still available, but has been recompiled with a newer gcc. 

BTW, do you know if the backward incompatibility is for C as well as
C++?  If a gcc3-compiled program won't work with a gcc4-compiled libc,

I think the compatibility libraries (FC4 comes with 11 of them covering c, 
c++, g77, readline, db, ...) deal with this.  For redhat they seem to work 
well in the sense that old binaries still work, but I don't know about 
other distros, and I avoid them myself.

Subject: [tex-live] libstdc++ linking
Message-ID: <200508142135.j7ELZYb04050@tug.org>

Hi Staszek, and all,

It isn't pretty, but I managed to get a build of the lcdf binaries with
libstdc++ (but not libc) statically linked, by running our build script
with CXX set:
  CXX=cxxhack Build
where cxxhack is a one-line script:
  exec gcc "$@" -Wl,-Bstatic -lstdc++ -Wl,-Bdynamic -lm

Can you give that a try?  For now, I checked in the i386-linux lcdf
binaries I built on tug.org using this.

Some of the output from configure looked doubtful ("no -lstdc++"), but
the binaries (including pdfetex) can do --help, anyway.  I didn't try to
actually do anything real.

Explanation: it turns out that (incredibly annoyingly) g++ does not use
the specs file to determine the final link command -- the stdc++ part is
hardwired into the binary, and no environment variable or runtime
configuration can change it, as far as I could see.  Thus, the idea is
to use gcc instead of g++ or c++ for the front-end compiler, and link
with -lstdc++ ourselves.  g++ automatically links with -lm, so we do
that too.

Perhaps there is a cleaner way to alter the lcdf configure setup to
achieve the same link line, but I could not find it offhand.  I wrote to
bug-automake for advice.  If anyone has any ideas, so much the better. 

For the record, this web page:
  http://www.trilithium.com/johan/2005/06/static-libstdc/
has more details and a warning that static linking with libstdc++ can
still fail in the face of various exception-related stuff.  I sincerely
hope that won't be an issue for us.

Thanks,
Karl

\index (and related commands).

Try the "Indexing" chapter in lshort for starters.
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

    (2) How do I program latex to produce the index at the end of the book?

makeindex is the most common program to create the sorted index,

I am planning to build something like this, which also would work for
commercial fonts. The script should generate either a debian package or
a tar.gz or whatever to be installed, including the config files for
updmap etc.

But this is definitely for later.

Umpf, well, removed also fourier.tpm from collection-latexextra, as it
is also in collection-fontsextra. There it should be, and nowhere else.

I want to update the last bit of my CJK stuff (namely, the CJK package
itself); part of it is hbf2gf.  Looking into TeXLive's makefiles of
hbf2gf I can see that during `make install' the file hbf2gf.1 is
copied to the texmf tree.  I wonder whether this target is ever
executed while creating the binaries, or whether the created binaries
are copied manually.  Looking into cdbuild/logs I assume the latter.

With other words, it seems that I have to update hbf2gf.1 in both
source.development/ and texmf/doc/.  Is this correct?

As far as I see the xpdf in our depot is still vulnerable to

Does this hit TeX live? Which programs do make use of xpdf libraries?
Is it possible to drop in xpdf-3.01?

Do you actually provide xpdf?  The xpdf code used for pdfTeX, pdftosrc
etc. is not affected, only interactive uses are - see the mails of

    What is this good for?  It seems that the `*.1.html' patterns are
    obsolete since there are no *.1.html files in the TeXLive repository.

In the past we (Fabrice, as I recall) created html's for the man pages
so that Windows users (who typically don't have man itself) could have
access to the information.

I don't know if that will happen this year or not.  The patterns being

Correct.

    With other words, it seems that I have to update hbf2gf.1 in both

Yes.

In general, there is no automatic update from the result of "make
install" (which goes into source.development/Work/inst) to the actual
live tree (texmf).  I have stuff that checks the two for
incompatibilities, though mistakes would (as always) not surprise me.

The current mess over the file EC.enc, for which three different
versions exist in the CTAN tree in four locations (I show MD5
checksums and locations)

7a76ac2c099e4bfdef074daa90efc450  tex-archive/dviware/mdvi/data/EC.enc

d09dada0f71f932458b47aabb8a3d076  tex-archive/fonts/utilities/vplutils/encodings/EC.enc

and yet another one in the TeXlive tree with different contents and
spelling

caf61a0c98f79110e8394fc4bb1d8aa9  texlive-2004-11/texmf-dist/fonts/enc/dvips/base/ec.enc

is simply bad archive management practice.

It is now more than 13 years since the platform-independent checksum
utility and standard file-header comment support for GNU emacs were
developed after a late-night brainstorming session by a large group of
us in Heidelberg, and then later implemented by Robert Solovay
(Berkeley) and me (Utah):

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/emacs
	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/checksum

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/emacs
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/checksum

They should be used for ALL of the files in the TeXlive and CTAN
archives, so that such files carry author information, a version
number, a timestamp, a checksum, and other documentation in a standard
form, making it easy to figure out which version is current, who is
responsible for it, and for end users to verify whether the file has
been modified without a header update since it was released.

Header standardization makes it very easy to automate the generation
of software catalogs, something that is badly needed. Such catalogs
could be kept up to date by nightly cron jobs.

All of the bibliography archives at

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib

carry such headers, as do all of the emacs files at the above
locations, and as do the AMS (La)TeX files.

Once the EC.enc mess is sorted out and the definitive version
identified, let's add a standard header to it, put it in a version
control system, and track the changes to it that way.

A 500GB SATA disk

	http://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/menuitem.8f07a3c3d3a7a12d92b86b31bac4f0a0/

now lists for US$437; we can easily have the resources to store
complete revision histories of every file in the TeXlive and CTAN
archives.

Please remember that one of the great strengths of TeX is its
stability over decades.  It is important at many sites to be able to
retypeset documents that were written years ago, and to do that, all
of the style files used by the documents must be available.  That is
why the revision control system either needs to be publicly
accessible, or else version-numbered packages of every collection of
files need to be available back to the day they were first released.

While single users with personally-owned machines may enjoy always
having the latest-and-greatest versions of every piece of software,
corporate and institutional realities require much more stability and

Hello Nelson,

Your idea with the checksums is great.

But, to say that different files with the same name in different
packages (that are supposedly the same also semantically) is `simply
bad archive management practice' is ridiculous. That's as if you
demand that librarians change book pages when they detect an error in
it. Life ain't as simple you try to make it. Please don't disqualify
yourself with such a blank statement, when you obviously haven't
realized the constraints of (current) CTAN management.

In particular, your rant about small disk prices is completely off the
point. Our problem is not money, our problem is that the whole CTAN
archive management (including cataloguing new entries, communicating
with uploaders, and also sysadmin work) is done by just three people. 
By the way, these three people are all on holiday now and won't answer
you this week; I'm keeping an eye on the DANTE server and on the ctan
mailing list in the mean time.

If we give you an account on a CTAN server, would _you_ (either
personally or with persons that _you_ manage) please:

 -- implement a checksumming solution
     -- storage is no problem, we've got plenty of that
     -- available is also a database (currently we use PostgreSQL), or
        CVS or Subversion or anything you need for it. We've got
        everything for you to start.
     -- Your BibTeX-headers are not a solution that will be accepted
        by submitters. Your solution must be one that DOES NOT ALTER
        SUBMITTED FILES. We are not allowed to do so on our own.
     -- Your solution MUST NOT demand headers from submitters. The `C'
        in CTAN stands for `comprehensive' -- we archive everything
        TeX-related!
     -- Some authors deny us to even add files. Therefore, your
        solution should store the meta-data somewhere else, not within
        the package.
     -- By the way, you know about the catalogue XML files and
        database, do you? That might a good starting point.

 -- implement a method that detects upload of duplicate files to CTAN
     -- Please note that this method needs heuristics, i.e., it needs
        to borrow AI methods
     -- The reason: Currently, the CTAN administration only checks for
        naming conflicts of package names. You want to add checks for
        single files that are named the same in different uploaded
        packages. Your EC.enc example says so, these are four files
        with the same name in four packages. All those packages might
        also have a file README. They can be different, can they? 
        Therefore your heuristic must be able to decide which file
        name collisions are relevant and be checked, and which
        collisions aren't.
     -- Your method MUST NOT be as simple as restricting duplicated
        file names. We have lots of names that are perfectly good in
        many packages (most of them auxiliary files like Makefile or
        README, but also some driver files, etc.)
     -- Your method must detect the owners of other versions of that
        file on CTAN and must be able to identify the reference
        package.
     -- Your method must cope with the fact that that reference
        package might not be maintained any more and that this is
        simply a spawned version.
     -- Again: Denying uploads because they don't conform to your idea
        of good archive management is a no-no because it would counter
        the whole objective of CTAN. So you have to have a process
        that makes conflicts manageable. They will exist over time.

 -- implement software support for your method above.
     -- Your method must be almost completely automated. No additional
        manual steps must be necessary for contributions. We already
        ask them a few questions; e.g., if they don't have a README
        file. E.g., your software might give us information what else
        to ask for; that would be a good help.
     -- That is important: The admin work is already too much for the
        available volunteers, we cannot add new manual work.
     -- Firing up Emacs and loading each submitted file is not
        acceptable. The software must be usable remotely from the
        command line, as this is the work environment of CTAN
        maintainers.

 -- integrate your software support into the available software. In
    particular, in
     -- the upload software
     -- the mirroring software

 -- set up the checksumming data and the initial problems.

If you do all this, then more people will listen to your rant. Up to
then, you are simply unrealistic in your demands.


Concerning your concrete EC.enc problem,
 -- CTAN maintainers will _not_ update EC.enc in different packages.
    This is package maintenance and not archive maintenance, the
    package owners have to submit upgraded packages.
Therefore, you can help the TeX community here, as you did so often in
the past:
 -- Contact all authors of the respective packages where they got
    their EC.enc from and if they can upgrade to the current version.
 -- Of course, the authors will have to make sure that their package
    still is functional after that update.
 -- Make them upgrade their package and submit that upgrade to CTAN.
 -- Contact the TeX-Live group and ask them about the change of file
    name and content. Get the issue resolved with them. This may also
    include communication with Thomas Esser and the MikTeX folks.


With both of these actions,
 -- either getting active in CTAN management and supplying a file
    collision solution without changing the CTAN objectives,
 -- or with sorting out the EC.enc collision,
you would help a lot. And help we need and take without objections.
But rants with unrealistic demands are something different.
(If it hadn't been you, I would have simply discarded the message and
not taken the time to answer.)


Best wishes to Salt Lake City, and give my greetings to Margret,

	Joachim

This is possibly true. It's also true that there should be

Subject: [tex-live] new CJK scripts
Message-ID: <20050819.004137.107684724.wl@gnu.org>


I've added the following bunch of CJK scripts (from version 4.6.0) to
TeXLive:

  bin/${ARCH}/bg5+pdflatex
  bin/${ARCH}/bg5pdflatex
  bin/${ARCH}/cef5pdflatex
  bin/${ARCH}/cefpdflatex
  bin/${ARCH}/cefspdflatex
  bin/${ARCH}/gbkpdflatex
  bin/${ARCH}/sjispdflatex

Those scripts have been correctly registered in
texk/cjkutils/scripts/Makefile.in.  Please don't forget to regenerate
texk/cjkutils/scripts/Makefile before creating new binaries for your
platform!

For my own convenience, I've added those scripts to already
bin/i386-linux.

Is it necessary to manually update the architecture sections in
bin-cjkutils.tpm?  I've properly added those scripts to the
TPM:BinPatterns section (and, for my own convenience, the TPM:BinFiles
section for i386-linux), and I wonder whether this is sufficient...

Dear friends! Dear DDs! Dear TeX Gurus!

I would like to ask for comments on the packages of TeX live I have
created. The original ITP is #312897, see
http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00970.html

The TeX live for Debian packages consists out of 66 source packages and
78 binary packages. These packages are all build more or less
automatically from the TeX live perforce depot.

For more detailed information please see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

In a nutshell, you need:
       deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
       deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
and if you want texinfo installed too, you also have to use my local
texinfo packages (which will get NMUed by someone else soon). They are
available at
       deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ texinfo/
       deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ texinfo/
After apt-get update you can install texlive-latexrecommended for a
start.

At
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
you can find several log file, namely:
        collection-*.build.log
                Output of the build process using tpm2deb.pl and
                dpkg-buildpackage
        texlive-*_version.lintian.log
                the output of lintian texlive-*_version.changes
        lintian.log
                the compilation of lintian-log files ordered by
                error/warning tags and pkgs.
	texlive-*_version.linda.log
		the output of linda -f lintian texlive-*_version.changes
	linda.log
		the compilation of linda-log files ordered by
		error/warning tags and pkgs.

Please note that the packages are ATM being rsynced to www.tug.org. They
should be there within a few hours. All the packages have version
	2005.08.18-1

i'll try to submit sparc-solaris, sparc64-linux and powerpc-aix
in the next few days.

i have a suggestion re directory names in the Master/bin directory:

currently we have this inconsistent situation:

drwxr-xr-x alpha-linux
lrwxrwxrwx i386-freebsd -> i386-freebsd4.10
drwxr-xr-x i386-freebsd4.10
drwxr-xr-x i386-linux
lrwxrwxrwx mips-irix -> mips-irix6.5
drwxr-xr-x mips-irix6.5
lrwxrwxrwx powerpc-aix -> powerpc-aix4.3.3.0
drwxr-xr-x powerpc-aix4.3.3.0
lrwxrwxrwx powerpc-darwin -> powerpc-darwin6.8
drwxr-xr-x powerpc-darwin6.8
drwxr-xr-x sparc64-linux
lrwxrwxrwx sparc-solaris -> sparc-solaris2.7
drwxr-xr-x sparc-solaris2.7
drwxr-xr-x win32
drwxr-xr-x win32-static
drwxr-xr-x x86_64-linux

i.e. for some platforms, there's a version number in directory name
and a symlink without a version number; and in some platforms the
directory with binaries doesn't contain version number, and neither
there's a symlink.

i suggest to not use version numbers in all cases, and also rename
sparc64-linux to sparc-linux (that's because actually all the binaries
are 32-bit):

drwxr-xr-x alpha-linux
drwxr-xr-x i386-freebsd
drwxr-xr-x i386-linux
drwxr-xr-x mips-irix
drwxr-xr-x powerpc-aix
drwxr-xr-x powerpc-darwin
drwxr-xr-x sparc-linux
drwxr-xr-x sparc-solaris
drwxr-xr-x win32
drwxr-xr-x win32-static
drwxr-xr-x x86_64-linux

(and we don't need the symlinks with version numbers). i can do the
necessary changes (including in the install scripts) if you approve.
what do you think?

Best,
v.

only if you update the install scripts which detect OS and choose
the appropriate binary.... so far as I recall, they have version numbers
wired-in. See common.sh and utils.sh

WOW! Documentation!!

For years now I have been mystified by these pseudo-BibTeX (do I detect
also a hint of MFT in the choice of %%% as line prefix?) headers some TeX
files carry. (At one point I even hacked together a script of my own to
update the timestamps in the fontinst files which carry these headers,
since an incorrect such header is far worse than no header at all.) This is
however the first mention I have seen _anywhere_ of what created these
headers in the first place.

IMNSHO this indicates that the "standard" hasn't been very widely
publicised, and thus is perhaps isn't that strange that is isn't being
followed.

My initial enthusiasm is also somewhat quenched when I look at the things
these URLs point to. Rather than being a documentation/specification of the
format, the material appears to be software. This is perfectly fine if you
can immediately install and run that software, but from a superficial look
at it this seems far from certain. Maybe there is a specification somewhere
in one of the tarballs, but right now I don't have the time to explore that
further.

An Emacs solution is not a universal solution.

Is this a suggestion to extend CTAN with CVS capabilities? Good idea!

Hi Vladimir, 

    i'll try to submit sparc-solaris, sparc64-linux and powerpc-aix
    in the next few days.

Excellent, thanks.

    currently we have this inconsistent situation:

Well, it was inconsistent only because there is no decent way to give a
version number for linux.

    rename sparc64-linux to sparc-linux (that's because actually all
    the binaries are 32-bit):

Then it should certainly be renamed :).

    (and we don't need the symlinks with version numbers). i can do the
    necessary changes (including in the install scripts) if you approve.

>From the point of view of maintaining the scripts, it sounds good, I'd
love to get rid of the version numbers hardwired in there, they are a
pain.

Only thing is, sometimes it is useful to know on what os version,
specifically, the binaries were built (for bug reports, etc.).  So how
about if everyone doing builds records that, and I'll put the list into
the documentation or a README or something.  I'm thinking of the output
of uname -a, gcc -v (or whatever compiler), and anything else useful.
That will do a better job than the version numbers in the bin directories.

How does that sound?

Thanks much,
Karl

The program ttf2pfb is obsolete; I no longer maintain it.  You can do
the same (and more) with ttf2pt1.  Any objections that I remove it?

In case you agree, I have another question: Since I only have checked
out the i386-linux binaries I wonder how to remove the binaries from
the other platforms.  It seems to me that I have to ask here on the

Not from me.  I always like to see stuff be deleted :).

    I wonder how to remove the binaries from the other platforms.  

After you do the deletions for linux I'll do it for the others.  It
would also (presumably) happen when new binary sets are checked in.

Hi Karl,
I did it using rsync. It worked fine. Thanks.


I'm not exactly an expert to know how to build it. Therefore without
better knowing I tried

./configure --prefix=`pwd` --datadir=`pwd` --enable-multiplatform

That worked. Then I tried: make
and got: 

cd lib && make   -I /home/manfred/Documents/programming/make CC='cc'
CFLAGS='-O -pipe ' LDFLAGS='' make: don't know how to make /config.h.
Stop *** Error code 2

Stop in /data/dl/web2c.


The problem seems to be that in lib/Makefile  the variable
kpathsea_srcdir isn't defined and this gives /config.h for
$(kpathsea_srcdir)/config.h


I guess this is all my fault. If you could tell me how to properly
build it?

Hi!

while building texlive, i got an error like this:

make[5]: Entering directory `/home/vvv/src/tl2005/Work/TeX/texk/dvipdfmx/src'
if gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfmx/src -I..   -I../../../texk -I../../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfmx/../../texk  -g -O2  -MT pngimage.o -MD -MP -MF ".deps/pngimage.Tpo" -c -o pngimage.o ../../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfmx/src/pngimage.c; \

../../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfmx/src/pngimage.c:75:17: png.h: No such file or directory

but texlive does include libpng; do apparently dvipdfmx doesn't use
the library provided with the texlive sources, and depends on system
libpng.

that is not a problem to install libpng development package, but it is
a bug that texlive sources include libpng but some of the programs
nevertheless require system libpng: either they shall use texlive's
dvipng, or texlive shall not include libpng, and use OS-provided
libpng.

Best,
v.

Hi Vladimir,

As you surmise, every program in TL is supposed to use the libraries
that are in TL.  I was able to compile dvipdfmx, and the result doesn't
use the system libpng shared library, at least -- I didn't think to
check about the headers.  That's what --enable-tetex-build is supposed
to get us (which is enabled implicitly in the TL tree in tetex.ac
somewhere).

I just checked, and my build does have the -I's to find the TL png:
    gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfm
    -I.. -I../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfm/.. -I../../libs/libpng
    -I../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfm/../../libs/libpng -I../../libs/zlib
    -I../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfm/../../libs/zlib -g -c
    ../../../../TeX/texk/dvipdfm/pngimage.c -o pngimage.o

Can you try to check further into why you're not getting this?
Let me know, we'll figure it out somehow ...

(My full log is in ~karl/src/Build/source.development/Work/tlbuild.log
on tug, if it helps.)

Thanks,
karl

    I'm not exactly an expert to know how to build it. 

Sorry, I thought you built i386-freebsd in the past?

Anyway, my immediate guess is to try running "make world" instead of
make.

But skip that, it is probably best to run the top-level "Build" script;
it is in the source.development directory.  It'll build everything in a
subdir Work, and install it to a subdir inst.  Let me know how it goes ...

Thanks,

Oh.  It's making the dependencies.  I didn't notice that. 

Well, it will take some effort to figure out how to affect the compile
flags for doing that.  Meanwhile, it shouldn't make any difference to
the actual binary, since the right flags were used there.  So I think
it's ok to proceed.

Those are supposed to be in -lX11 (since day 1).  I don't think anything
has changed in TL in this regard since last year.  Strange.

Googling for that error message shows a few people with the same
problem, no obvious answer.  Maybe you'll see something better, though.

There was some suggestion to use ".dylibs" where possible.  Does that
make sense to you?  (I assume you have the X11 SDK installed, which was
the other thing mentioned.)

Anyway, running nm libX* | grep rabServer  should at least show you
where they are (or are not) defined ...

Nothing comes easy.

Yes, that's why I first looked for a Build script which however didn't

Forgot to mention. I tried: make world

make: don't know how to make world. Stop

That's _just_ the web2c directory.  For a complete build you need all
under
	http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source.development/
Plus suitable texmf and texmf-dist trees, e.g.:
	http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf-dist
	http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf

Otherwise you have a partial source tree (from which you _cannot_ do a
build) and miss some of the files needed to generate formats, which
breaks the final step in 'make world'.  Symptoms of an incomplete
source tree look like this:

> ./configure --prefix=`pwd` --datadir=`pwd` --enable-multiplatform

See above.  If you have the bandwidth and disk space, the easiest way
is to just grab everything under 'devsrc/Master' and 'devsrc/Build'.

Thanks. I guess that would work but I need someone else to do this to  
the TeXLive source in the p4 repository because I have no reliable  
automake setup

I know, but the point is that the next time I resync with the p4  
repository and reconfigure, my Makefile is overwritten. I therefore  
need a solution that is in the p4 repository, not one that is  
overwritten every time I update the sources and thus that adds to my  
maintenance complexity.

this (adding --trace-symbol options to the linker) is not a solution
to that problem - it is a debug measure which is intended to debug the
problem which you have.

therefore it is a one-time-only thing which may help to understand
what is going wrong in your setup. it does not need to be put into p4

This is the same problem that Vladimir had -- all the necessary -I's to
use the TL libraries (like libpng) are not being passed when the
dependencies are created.  Actually I'm slightly confused that the
dependencies are being recreated at all.

I'll try to look at this today.

Seems like we might as well wait for 1.30.1 instead of doing an

Subject: [tex-live] Omega and the recent changes in TDS
Message-ID: <200508202223.34409.akrioukov@newmail.ru>

Hi,

First of all, sorry if I have selected a wromg mailing list
for my message. I don't use TL myself, and the problem my message 
is devoted to was encountered in teTeX 3.0. However, I
suppose (may be I am wrong) that at this point teTeX just mirrors
directory structure changes in TL, so that this mailing list
should be the right place to discuss the problem.

Let me introduce myself: I am developing antomega, an alternate
language support package for the omega/lambda system. My package
has a quite stable directory structure (at least so I supposed), where
most stuff goes to texmf/omega and texmf/omega/lambda. This is one
(but not the most important) reason why the recent changes in TDS look
hardly acceptable for me.

After installing teTeX 3.0 I realized that now the omega/ directory is
excluded from lambda's search path and all default Omega's stuff is
moved from omega/ to tex/ *except* ocp and otp files. Of course 
that's correct even according the recent TDS recommendations, since
ocp/otp files (Omega's  translation processes) have a non-TeX syntax 
and are engine-specific. The problem is, that these files are loaded by
lambda compiler as any other files (e. g. style packages) at the
runtime, and so they should be present in the search path! So even
standard translation processes are unaccessible with teTeX 3.0 default
configuration, which makes the whole omega system just unusable without
editing texmf.cnf.

Since my package provides a bunch of additional translation
processes, this problem is very actual for me. However, there are
other files which can hardly be integrated into the new directory
structure. For example, antomega includes its own hyphenation
patterns, mainly incompatible with standard tex/latex,
since they are 16-bit encoded. So, I would prefer to keep them
separately from patterns used by Babel, and the omega/ directory
seems to be the right place for them. My package also includes
its own version of hyphen.cfg; again, no reason to put it into tex/,
where it can cause clashes with the file provided with Babel.

So I think the omega/ directory should at least be returned into the
search path both for omega and lambda compilers. And, of course, I would
like to know, which directory structure I should use for my package in
order to keep it compatible with future versions of TL and teTeX.
I would prefer to keep anything as it is, since the recent TDS 
recommendations just seem hardly applicable to omega.

No, this is not the right description for the development process. In
fact, such implementation details are revised over time and usually
discussed on the TDS mailing list before they are implemented. It is
just a matter of timing whether a stand-alone web2c distribution or TeX
Live or teTeX is the first release implementing something new.

The kpathsea library provides an API to locate files along different
omega specific search paths, e.g. kpse_otp_format. The implementation
needs to be changed to access OTP files only via these search formats.

Some omega is quite useless in teTeX-3.0. Interestingly, I did not get
a single bug report about it. Where are the users of omega? What binaries
are they using? Is none of them using teTeX?

The TDS working group has decided against the engine specific separation.
I think that you should raise your issues there, but I also suggest
that you search the list archives for thediscussion that has led to
this decision.

> its own version of hyphen.cfg; again, no reason to put it into tex/,

That file can be in a format specific subdirectory in tex/. The version
in tex/generic will then be used for all formats which don't have their
own file *and* sarch path.

TDS-1.1 and the engines (omega, aleph etc.) should be fixed.

Hi Alexej,

(I see Thomas also replied, but here's my take anyway.)

Thanks for writing.  I'm glad that you are continuing to work on antomega.

    at this point teTeX just mirrors directory structure changes in TL,

Well, technically/supposedly both teTeX and TL follow the TDS, but in
practice the same people work on all these projects, so it hardly
matters which mailing list is used.

    The problem is, that these files are loaded by
    lambda compiler as any other files (e. g. style packages)

Well, that's a bad situation.

So omega and lambda do not use OTPINPUTS and OCPINPUTS to find otp/ocp
files?  If not, then why do those variables exist?  I'm confused.  (I
admit I did not review the sources.)

    other files which can hardly be integrated into the new directory

Right now, there is a tex/lambda/antomega directory, which is (I
presume) found by lambda.  Is this a problem to use for the location?
Is antomega tied to lambda, by the way (as opposed to plain omega)?

As for hyphen.cfg, how about giving the file a unique name, like
antohyphen.cfg?  That would avoid any confusion, either by computers or
humans.

In any case, the search path for lambda is
  .;$TEXMF/tex/{lambda,latex,generic,}/
so your hyphen.cfg (or other files) would be found first.

    separately from patterns used by Babel, 

They should certainly be separate from any babel files, since they are
provided by antomega, not babel.  We try to keep files from any given
package together, and distinct from other packages, although it's not
100%.

In general, we tried to explain the reason for moving omega/lambda input
files to the tex/ tree (even though the original tex cannot read them)
in the tds revision, as below.  I understand that antomega is never
going to be read by latex, so the first reason doesn't apply, but does
the location under tex/ hurt?  I don't see why, exactly ...

Best,
Karl


\item Authors of relevant packages typically make their code detect the
engine being used, and issue error messages or adapt to circumstances
appropriately.  Furthermore, as a package matures, it may support
multiple engines.  Thus, a package could conceivably be placed in any of
several top-level directories, at different times.  Putting all packages
under the top-level \path|tex| directory provides a stable location over
time.

\item Users need to be able to switch between engines, and configuring
different search paths for each engine is difficult and error-prone.

\end{itemize}

Thus, in practice, having different top-level directories caused
difficulties for everyone involved---users, package authors, site
administrators, and system distributors.

Vladimir, Staszek, all, hope it will fly now ...

(I was confused before, it was dvipdfm, no x, which was finding the TL
libs; dvipdfmx never was.  Long strings of consonants don't make for

We've discussed with the submitter. We've got to the conclusion, that
changing the settings is not really necessary by default. He instead
suggested to leave a note above the line documenting that it *might*
be dangerous and how to change it, for example:

% The default settings are not secure when you process LaTeX files of
% possibly doubtful origin. In this case, set openin_any = p.

I've no clue if that will really help many people, however you could
consider to modify the texmf.cnf in that way.

Dear Karl,

many thanks to you and Thomas for your answers.

Well, that was my mistake. Indeed, for OCP files OCPINPUTS is used,
so that they not necessarily should be present in the search path.
BTW, I don't know why the OTPINPUTS variable is needed at all, since
OTP's are just source files, never loaded by any compiler.

Unfortunately, this is not very helpful for me, because Omega seems to
provide no special way to check if a specific translation process really
exists. That's why in antomega I used to apply an \IfFileExists test
before loading any OCP. There are good reasons to do so, because some
translation processes are optional, and, if they are not available on
user's system, this shouldn't cause compilation process to be aborted.

This check was important also because previously antomega depended from 
some standard translation processes supplied with default Omega package,
and, unfortunately, different sets of such files where available in 
different TeX distributions. In the latest release I excluded most such
dependencies, but I still think that removing this test (which requires
the file in question to be present in the search path) would be a
backwards step.

Antomega requires a latex-based format, and so yes, it is tied with
lambda. Since antomega has its own specific setting which need to
be loaded into format (so that system's default lambda format usually
cannot be used) I considered separating my package into an independent
omega-based format. However, I am unsure if currently there are 
really good reasons to do so (and this would cause additional
problems anyway).

> As for hyphen.cfg, how about giving the file a unique name, like

> or humans.

Well, as I have said, antomega requires a latex based format. I
can't rewrite the whole latex.ltx to make antomega independent from
latex, and this is really not needed. However, loading latex.ltx into
format means that some files related with Babel (and so practically
useless for my purposes) also get loaded. hyphen.cfg is THE place
where I can exclude babel-specific commands and replace them with
my own ones. If I rename the file, how can I manage it to be loaded
into format instead of babel's hyphen.cfg?

The problem is that omega/lambda is a 2-level engine, like tex/latex.
There is plain omega compiler (with its plain format), and there is a
latex based format for it, called lambda. So previously the omega/
and omega/lambda/ directories tried to mirror the directory structure
of tex/ and tex/latex/, and this was logical. Well, now I can move
lambda-specific stuff to tex/lambda/, but what about files which not
necessarily require a latex-based format, and so may be used by plain
omega as well? This is the case of hyphenation patterns: I probably
have a choice between placing them into tex/lambda/ and tex/generic/,
although both locations are surely wrong.

And that's why I think the new TDS is illogical: it provides engine
specific directories only for latex-based formats, but not for plain
formats they are related with! As a result, some omega-specific
files in teTeX 3.0 are now placed into tex/generic/. For example, 
the whole tex/generic/encodings/ directory is omega-specific, and I
don't understand why it should be in tex search path.

tex-live@tug.org is the real list, with the archives and all,
while texlive@tug.org (and live@tug.org) are mailing aliases
for tex-live@tug.org. So regardless where you send your message,
it all ends up at the same place :)

    A real solution would have this fixed in xdvik such that the order of  
    X11 libs is correct for non shared libraries.

The X library order is a constant source of problems, since different
vendors require different things.

Here is what the comment in xdvik/Makefile.in says:
# Follow the library order used in X11R6 itself.
# It seems that on Cygwin, libXaw needs _XpmReadFileToPixmap, so we put
# x_xpm_libs last.
# Xmu needs to come before Xt and after the toolkit libs.
 
>From your earlier message, the order you're getting is:

    libt1.a ../../libs/t1lib/../type1/libtype1.a -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXaw
    -lXmu -lXt -lSM -lICE -lXp -lXext -lX11 -L/usr/lib -liconv -lXpm
     ../kpathsea/.libs/libkpathsea.a -lm

>From which I surmise that the *GrabServer functions are in -lXpm on
macosx.  Is that correct?  If you try manually linking with -lXpm just
before -lX11, does it work?

If so, it should be straightforward to change the order in the Makefile,
but there's no sense reautoconfiscating unless we know the result will
work for you.

(The comment above implies -lXpm has to come after -lXaw for Cygwin, but
not after -lX11.)

Hello,

Every night at 02:08 GMT some job tries to access an rsync module
tldevsrc on the DANTE CTAN server, from shell.sourceforge.net. 
(Hostname might be rsync.dante.de, ftp.dante.de, or dante.ctan.org.)
I thought this access might be connected to the tex-live project (or,
what else could `tldevsrc' be?).

Does anybody know something about that job?
Are we supposed to provide an rsync module with that name?
If yes, what should it access?
If no, who could know something about the job?

Best,

I cannot remember such a thing. I cannot check, since the old ftp.dante.de
is switched off.

On the other hand, since noone on shell.sourceforge.net noticed that it
didn't work, I conclude that it isn't important anyway.

Hmm.

    I thought this access might be connected to the tex-live project (or,

I'm sure it is.  We provide a tldevsrc rsync module on tug.org.

    Does anybody know something about that job?

Not me.

    Are we supposed to provide an rsync module with that name?

No.  dev = development, shouldn't be on CTAN.

    If yes, what should it access?
    If no, who could know something about the job?

I agree with Rainer that since no one has noticed the failure, it can't
be very important.

If it's bothersome, asking the sourceforge admins what project has such
a cron job is the simplest idea I can think of ...

Hi Hilmar,

    % The default settings are not secure when you process LaTeX files of
    % possibly doubtful origin. In this case, set openin_any = p.

I'm not too excited about putting such a vague and alarmist message into
texmf.cnf.  I have no objection to putting in something more specific,
along the lines of "openin_any=t will let TeX documents read any file on
the system; if you're allowing unknown people to run your TeX over the
web, you should change this to openin_any=p."  Well, that's not great,
but you get the idea.

What's the scenario where this is a problem again?  Ordinarily the
output from TeX is not readable except by someone on the system who can
read any file TeX can anyway.  If we're talking about some hypothetical
web interface which allows generic uploading/running tex/displaying
back, that's not a good idea for lots of other reasons, too.

    I've no clue if that will really help many people, 

I agree with you that 99% of users (at least) will never see a note in
texmf.cnf, but we could write a couple of sentences in the
documentation, if we can come up with something useful to say (even if
just to point to when this question arises in the future).  That would
have slightly more of a chance of being seen.

Best,
Karl

It would be good if we could find a better solution for checking for
existence than putting the files into TEXINPUTS. Files which are not
TeX syntax should not be there. Maybe, something that you should discuss
with the Omega developers or Olaf Weber.

Well, you could use
  tex/antomega/{base,extra,...}
for your directory structure and have
  TEXINPUTS.antomega = = .;$TEXMF/tex/{antomega,latex,generic,}//

Then, your hyphen.cfg somewhere in tex/antomega would only affect the
antomega format.

> And that's why I think the new TDS is illogical: it provides engine

Well, in some sense, we have a mapping (engine,format) -> identifier, e.g.
  (omega,latex) -> lambda
  (aleph,latex) -> lamed

This, however, was not invended by the authors of the TDS, rather than
the people who have developed the new engines. If, for some reason, you
need a new identifier, just create it (even for plain based formats).
Such an identifier only makes sense if it is used in TEXINPUTS
definitions, such as the example of TEXINPUTS.antomega given above.

So, if this directory layout is the way to go, you need to ask your
users to modify their texmf.cnf file (until your change ends up in all
TeX distributions).

Looks like TeX syntax to me...

It's not bothersome -- I'll ignore the message in the future. I just
wanted to weed out a list of syslog messages where I don't know if
they are relevant or not. Relevant messages are emailed by logcheck to
me and to Rainer, I'll categorize this regular rsync access as not
relevant.

Cheers,

Well, discussing anything with the Omega developers certainly makes no
sense, because they absolutely don't care about their users.

Hence the problem. Yes, there are special directories for most
(engine,format) pairs, but no directories for files which are
related with a specific engine rather than with a specific
format, and still have a TeX syntax. This is the case of hyphenation
patterns, or, say, those *.onm files which currently reside in 
tex/generic/encodings.

BTW, I am wondering why plain omega (unlike lambda) even hasn't 
its own directory in the search path (i. e. something like
texmf/tex/plainomega).

I just don't understand why I have to put into a format-specific
directory something that really is only engine-specific.

If I have to ask my users to modify texmf.cnf anyway, I'd rather
ask them to change the search paths for omega and lambda.

Of course, but this doesn't make them useful for tex (they are probably
useless for omega as well, but that's another issue). The whole
problem I am speaking about is related only with engine specific files
which, unfortunately, look more or less like TeX packages.

Subject: [tex-live] cleanup: remove special cases in texlinks for {pdf,

Message-ID: <87irxzez9q.fsf@vvv.vsu.ru>

Hi!

texlinks has a special case for the following four programs:
  cslatex, csplain, pdfcslatex, pdfcsplain
for which it creates a special script instead of a symlink.

on the other hand, fmtutil.cnf has the following rules for these
formats:

#! csplain	pdfetex		-	-translate-file=cp227.tcx *csplain.ini
#! cslatex	pdfetex		-	-translate-file=cp227.tcx *cslatex.ini
#! pdfcsplain	pdfetex		-	-translate-file=cp227.tcx *csplain.ini
#! pdfcslatex	pdfetex		-	-translate-file=cp227.tcx *cslatex.ini

so my question is: why not use symlinks for {pdf,}cs{plain,latex} just
like for all other formats (some of which use -translate-file feature
too)?

but note that the special-case scripts contain translate file il2-cs
but not cp227.

so my proposal is:

1) uncomment (and change) the lines in fmtutil.cnf in the following
   way:

csplain		pdfetex		-	-translate-file=il2-cs.tcx *csplain.ini
cslatex		pdfetex		-	-translate-file=il2-cs.tcx *cslatex.ini
pdfcsplain	pdfetex		-	-translate-file=il2-cs.tcx *csplain.ini
pdfcslatex	pdfetex		-	-translate-file=il2-cs.tcx *cslatex.ini

   (uncommenting them in TeXLive is necessary for automatic format
   file creation, because we do have these links installed by default)

2) remove special case for these formats from texlinks, thereby
   changing them to plain symlinks instead of ugly shell scripts.

do i overlook something which prevents us to do that?

Best,
v.

I don't see any reason against this proposal and I suggest to follow this.
One thing that I'd do, however, is to ask Petr. Maybe, he wants to do
some checks, adjust documentation etc.

I suspect you have used rc2.
I find

instead of

Subject: [tex-live] TeXlive for Debian - new packages on tug
Message-ID: <20050822093342.GB8897@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!

A new generation of Debian packages of TeX live are available on the tug
server, as usual see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

Note: If you had an older version of the packages installed, PLEASE
completely purge these packages before installing the new ones! THe
reason for this: The location of files have changed and some files have
been replaced by symlinks, which with a normal upgrade process gives
problems!

News:
  * Fix installation of /var/cache/font etc, make it multi user able
  * Link verious config files into /etc/texmf
  * remove generated formats in the postrm script
  * dynamically generate ChangeLog file from the ChangeLog of tpm2deb

Upcoming (with the next packages):
  * Include the included packages and their title in the long description
    of the control files, and generate the control files automatically.

eg:
Package: texlive-basic
...
Description: TeXLive: Essential programs and files
 These files are regarded as basic for any TeX system, covering
 plain TeX macros, Computer Modern fonts, and configuration for common
 drivers.
 .
 This package includes the following CTAN packages:
 bibtex -- Bibliography management for LaTeX.
 cm -- Computer Modern fonts.
 cmex -- The cmex package.
 dvips -- A dvi to PostScript driver.
 enctex --  A tex extension translating input on its way into TeX. 
 fontname -- Naming scheme for naming fonts in TeX.
 makeindex --  Process index output to produce typesettable code. 
 metafont -- Macro package for TeX (the most popular).
 misc -- Miscellaneous macros for TeX and MF.
 plain -- The Plain TeX format.
 tex-ps -- TeX to PostScript generic macros and add-ons.

They are not installed anymore. ALso no format description. Karl and
Thomas convened that it is completely useless to have these
links/formats, as texi2dvi and texi2pdf do not use the formats!

Only the name changes is missing, Thomas submitted a fix for this
already.

done - changed common.sh and utils.sh, deleted old dirs with OS
version numbers (and symlinks pointing to them), and resubmitted the
same bunaries with directory names without OS version numbers.

BTW, i noticed that the files on

http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/bin/

were already updated, but the old directories which were supposed to
be removed are there (but are empty). Probably the P4 options on
tug.org's client which fetches from the perforce repository need to be
updated to delete empty directories.

Sounds great - also Thomas uses similar descriptions in teTeX
(see file INSTALL in tetex-src-3.0 tarball):

teTeX-3.0 was successfully compiled on the following platforms:
  - ix86/Linux,         GNU gcc-3.4.3, GNU flex 2.5.4, GNU bison 1.875, GNU make 3.80
  - Sparc/Solaris 9,    Sun C 5.5, GNU flex 2.5.4, GNU bison 1.875, GNU make 3.80
  - x86/Solaris 10,     Sun C 5.5, GNU flex 2.5.4, GNU bison 1.875, GNU make 3.80
  - Digital UNIX 4.0E,  gcc 2.95.3, make (OS), flex (OS), yacc (OS), awk (OS)
  ...

probably we can put such info for TeX Live in some file (at least what
version of OS, C compiler was used to build the binaries included into
TeX Live).

i'll write such info for binaries i submitted later.

Best,
v.

Hi Vladimir,

    done - changed common.sh and utils.sh,  ...

Terrific, thanks!

    tug.org's client which fetches from the perforce repository need to be
    updated to delete empty directories.

The client options are there.  P4 often does not delete empty
directories regardless of options.  I run a cron job which rmdirs
everything nightly, so they'll go away in due course.

    probably we can put such info for TeX Live in some file

Yes, we should.  source.development/README comes to mind as the file.
Anyway, if people can send me the info, I'll put it in.

    i'll write such info for binaries i submitted later.

But, you can ask on tex-k or Olaf Weber directly about a solution for
your problem.

Maybe, we can just use
  tex/<engine>/<package>
instead of the old
  <engine>/generic/<package>
scheme.

(Karl: it might make sense to extend the TDS for this -- explicitly
allow tex/<engine> in addition to tex/<format>).

At least, we have all files which are accessed by the same API
(kpse_tex_format) in one directory inside the texmf tree ($TEXMF/tex).
This was the main problem which was "solved" be omitting the top-level
<engine> directories.

There is no need for a separate search path, aslong as there are no
conflicting files. That might be the reason.

Good point.

Look at it at the API level. omega and tex use the same implementation
for finding files for \input.

Hmmm, someone decided to rename the standard name x86_64 to a strange 
"i386_64"? This is unfortunate and imho wrong decision because the name 
x86_64 is standard and is used in many contexts (e.g. as arch part of an 
rpm filename, as a subdirectory in Linux kernel source tree, in uname -a 
output etc etc). (I can imagine only those who particularly hate Intel for 
taking AMD_64 and calling it x86_64 without any reference to AMD would 
object to the name x86_64.)

Anyway, I'll build it of course. I'll download the sources and do it, but 
not right now. If it's OK to wait 2 more weeks that would be great (I need 
to finish something urgent by the end of next week).

Kind regards,

Tigran

This file was generated by "make depend" with gcc 3.3.5 20050117
(SuSE 9.3). :-(

I have just submitted a hopefully correct file (#7819) and will try to fix the
"depend" target.

Sorry for all the trouble.

Martin, can you make sure the things I flagged as regressions get
fixed in the pdftex master sources?

Please?

Subject: [tex-live] suggested cleanup of texlinks for {pdf,}cs{plain,latex}
Message-ID: <87vf1xd8rp.fsf@vvv.vsu.ru>

Hi Petr,

the following 4 scripts are the only ones left in the TeX Live (and
teTeX) which still use shell script to call the TeX engine (with
the specific -progname and -default-translate-file options):

cslatex csplain pdfcslatex pdfcsplain

All other engines are using the symlinks to the TeX engine (most
commonly pdfetex).

Thomas Esser agreed:

 TE> I don't see any reason against this proposal and I suggest to
 TE> follow this.  One thing that I'd do, however, is to ask
 TE> Petr. Maybe, he wants to do some checks, adjust documentation
 TE> etc.

note that since the -translate-file setting during format generation
is, as far as i know, stored in the format file, this should have the
same effect as passing -default-translate-file during runtime.

What do you think?

May we proceed with changing these four scripts to symlinks:
  cslatex csplain pdfcslatex pdfcsplain
and making the above changes to fmtutil.cnf and texlinks?

Best,
v.

Message-ID: <0904f87f0645dced7fa92244391eec81@rna.nl>

I would like to propose to guarantee standardization all of all binary 
builds of TL2005. Personally, I use the @2005/08/21:17:00:00 type of 
addition with p4 sync to make sure I get a reproducable set of sources.

Hence, at the time Karl asks us to make a new build, he could tell us 
exactly which datetime string to use when syncing with 
source.development.

The advantage of a scheme lik ethis is that when you want to debug 
different behaviours on differen systems later you are certain of one 
thing: the exact source code used.

G

PS. The only thing I do not know is if p4 uses local time or repository 
time or GMT or whatever, but that can be easily found out.

Message-ID: <200508222247.j7MMlX412210@tug.org>

I updated dvipdfmx to its 20050821 release, at ChoF's request.  

So another round of binaries now would be good, to get this, the new
pdftex, and the bibtex change.  Once the major arches are in, I'll
remake the images and we can (at long last) ask people to test.

Oh no, maybe not, 'cause Latin Modern is still pending.  Staszek,
anyone, ... ?  Last I heard from Hans, on Aug 15, there was going to be
a release in a "couple of days".

(Martin is preparing another pdftex release, but the only changes [so
far] are those that we already made, so there is no harm in going ahead
now.)

Thanks,
Karl

I do not know either, and I resist searching p4's painful web site, so I

Yes, you want sarge packages? I will make a pbuilder sarge environment

Ok, I will rebuild tex-common and the texlive packages and even texinfo
(my new one) for sarge and put it on tug.

Maybe only the next version including the latest fixes in the depot.

We only have to add it to the collection-context.tpm Requires and we
have the dependencies also in debian.

Do you do this?

Does the Debian texlive package ship lm fonts, or depend on the existing
lmodern Debian package?

it ships its own. I think it is a matter of policy that texlive should
not depend on the existing packages, as we want to entirely replace
them, being a different type of granularity.

texlive ships lm fonts and Conflicts with lmodern.

If there is a lmodern in debian/sid which works well with the new
infrastructure, I may disable the inclusion of lmodern into the texlive
debian package and add a Depend.

Yes, I also remember now.

I changed make to gmake (GNU make as in Linux) ) in Build and could
build the binaries.


I'll be away from home till end of next week. When I'm back I'll will

I noticed that the really latest code (Aug 23) is 8% slower than the  
Aug 21 code under comparable circumstances.

G

This is how I measure (as have other on the Mac OS X TeX list):

1. Put the following (what is between the ====== lines) in the file  
tex-perf

=====================================
#!/bin/sh

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9 10
do
         fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex >/dev/null
done
=====================================

2. Make the file executable:

chmod +x tex-perf

3. Run the following command:

sudo time ./tex-perf

Enter your password and let it run. After a while, it reports a  
result. Send that result back to me with a description of the system  
you have used with information about your system.

In the process of updating the hyphenation exception list for the next
tugboat (going to the printer later this week, hopefully), Barbara and I
discovered that the list, after Werner's hyphenex.sh script is run to
produce variants, has grown to about 1025 entries.

TL's texmf.cnf sets hyph_size to 1000.  So if anyone actually tried to
use the list, they'd lose.

So I'd like to increase hyph_size to 5000 (at least).  Anyone see
problems with that, or have a different number to propose?  (I'll also
ask Christian to do the same with miktex.)

Thanks,

In Debian tex-common we have agreed on

so go ahead.

Knuth comment in tex.web (section 12) is that hyph_size
should be a prime number (but it is not checked in the code).
I admit I do not now implications (effectiveness of hash function
for locating the hyphenation exception?) not following this constraints.
I'd suggest default setting of hyph_size to a prime that is 
higher than sum of biggest expection lists for at least American 
English and German (current dehyphtex.tex has about 800 words).
A prime around 5000 may suffice for some years.

Good point, thanks.  I think I will go for 10007.  The space is

It surely would be reasonable. But why not to go further and
move all existing format-specific directories to that 
engine-specific tree, so that the new texmf/tex/omega/ directory
structure will look exactly as older texmf/omega/ except files
which have a non-TeX syntax? At least this will reduce the
number of directories in texmf/tex/ and make search path
definitions in texmf.cnf less complicated.

Frankly speaking, I don't understand why this problem was
really important. In teTeX 3.0 I am still able to add to my search 
paths any arbitrary directories, including those outside of
texmf/tex/. If technically tex has no problems finding any
files in any arbitrary locations, why it is necessary to
simplify its task by placing them together?

If there are no such files now, this doesn't mean they can't be
introduced by future Omega releases or any additional packages.
Anyway, I think format-specific directories should exist not
only because of possible name clashes, but mainly because there
is no reason to disturb standard tex or latex with files they 
can't process. For example, most lambda-specific files in antomega 
also have unique names, but I hope this doesn't mean I have to 
put them into tex/latex/ rather than tex/lambda/?

Moreother, since currently all files specific for plain omega
(fortunately they are few) are splitted across various subdirectories 
of the tex/plain/ tree, it is quite difficult even to figure out
all such files or understand that they are omega-specific. So I
think creating a separate directory for plain omega-based format (either
in the texmf/tex/ tree, or as a subdirectory of future engine-specific
tree) is absolutely necessary.

In tex.ch, hyph_prime is introduced, which resembles hyph_size in tex.web.
Should hyph_size still be prime, Olaf?

Dear friends!

A new generation of Debian packages of TeX live are available on the tug
server, this time build in a pbuilder env for Sarge, so these packages
should be usable on all Debian systems from Sarge upward. As usual see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

Note: If you had an older version of the packages installed, PLEASE
completely purge these packages before installing the new ones! 
tex-common (>= 0.7) takes over some files from texlive, and for now I
don't care to put Replace fields for texlive into tex-common.

Note 2: I am leaving for vacation and I will return on 11. September.
>From this sunday on (28.) I won't read any emails and won't work on TeX
live, but I hope to see these packages getting more testing.

Changes since 2005.08.21-1:
version 2005.08.24-1 Wed, 24 Aug 2005 18:10:02 +0200

24.08.2005 NP
  * Everything is build with depot at change #7842
  * Really fix the info problem: Now all the info files are converted at
    install time to unix line endings. Thus also the strange ^M in the
    postinst script install-info commands should be fixed.

23.08.2005 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #7836
    This includes fixed versions of pdftex, mpost, dvipdfmx, and as usual
    several updates to  (La)TeX packages.
  * fixes the dvips.info install problem
  * lm is now included in texlive-basic, so changed conflicts in tpm2deb.cfg
  * generation of /var/cache/font/* and various ls-R files has moved to
    tex-common (>= 0.7), thus also the changed Depends
  * Dependency on tex-common (>= 0.7) also fixes the lambda with all
    languages problem in dumping the format file

22.08.2005 NP
  * Include the included packages and their title in the long description
    of the control files, and generate the control files automatically.

that's because TeX Live includes a limited version of CM-Super fonts
(only for size 10 pt).

ot use only 10-pt fonts in your document, include the line
\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}
before \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

or get the full version of CM-Super package from CTAN.

OK. This works. But I don't like it!!! The new TeXLive is no more
compatible with the previous version in respect to using Type1 fonts for
the EC family. If the CM-Super fonts are to big, I suggest to remove them
completely and make the lmodern fonts the default for T1 encoding (EC).

it's not possible to change the default family (cmr) used by LaTeX:
you have to explicitly load the package which switches to LM fonts
(lmr family).

This is not what I mean. It is possible to change the kind of Type1 font
(.pfb) which is used if a user want Computer Modern Font in T1 coding.

The mixing of .pfb and .pk in the current version is not acceptable!

The reason is obvious:  In fmt.d, the formats are commented.  I guess
the easiest thing would be to simply drop format generation from
postinst. 

However, there's a different problem:  It seems you regenerate the
orig.tar.gz files on every build?  At least after downloading the
dsc and diff.gz files of texinfo_4.8-0.1 into the directory where an
orig.tar.gz file from previous tests is, dpkg-source complains:

$ dpkg-source -x texinfo_4.8-0.1.dsc 
dpkg-source: error: file texinfo_4.8.orig.tar.gz has size 2148904 instead of expected 2140626

i think that LM fonts do not support the same wide range of font sizes
as do the EC fonts. therefore it is not possible to do a seamless
substitution of EC fonts with LM fonts.

it is better to explicitly include \usepackage{lmfonts}
if you wish to use LM fonts.

otherwise you will be using (for T1 encoding by default) the EC fonts.

The original problem was that the cm-super installation of TeX Live does not 
support the same wide range of font sizes as do the EC fonts, wasn't it?

The problem with cm-super of TeX Live is: If a user needs help because of 
bitmap-fonts (Type-3) at pdfs or ps using T1 encoding he'd often be told to 
install cm-super. But with TeX Live he already uses cm-super. So the 
community has to know, that he uses TeX Live's cm-super (and which version of 
TeX Live) to tell him: use cm-super from CTAN or add \usepackage{lmodern} 
instead. Not good.

Complete agreement.

When we discussed reducing the cm-super in TL, I was simply ignorant
that cm-super was used for any EC usage by default, so that
straightforward documents like your example ended up using cm-super
Type1's.  I guess it was too obvious for anyone to think to mention.

Vladimir, I do not see any fundamental reason why Latin Modern cannot be
used.  That was the basic thrust all along.  It is not necessary that
a separate Type 1 be available at every size.

If someone else can investigate the details, that would be great.
Otherwise, I'll get to it as soon as I can.

Thanks,
karl

i don't know satisfactory solution besides either removing partial
cm-super from TeX Live or installing full distribution (after all, TeX
Live on DVD has plenty of free space, so why not install the full
package?). - or somehow to manage to tell users to use the
\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}

similar situation (with mized Type1 and PK fonts) would occur with TeX
Live's CBgreek fonts...

technically nearly everything is possible, but practically it would be
incompatible with "backwards compatibility" considerations which
historically were very strictly considered in the past so i assumed
that it's unlikely to happen.

Ooops. Sorry. THis was fixed 3 days ago, but since it is not
automatically synced to tug, I forgot to upload it there.

Please *reget* texinfo (apt-get install --reinstall) and it should work.
After deactivating the format stuff for texinfo, I still called the
fmtutil-sys in the postinst script.

I guess the reason is the following: I first build the orig.tar.gz from
the TeX live sources, but switched then to the original from the gnu.org
site (there are no serious differences, and I mentioned it once in an
email).

So probably what you have is the old .orig.tar.gz from the TeXlive
source.

All my current sources and the ones on tug look like this:
4e9a1a591ed236003d0d4b008bf07eef 2140626 texinfo_4.8.orig.tar.gz
this is what you get from gnu.org, no repackaging. Please remove the old
source file!

Hello Norbert and friends,

Another little problem. It appears that /usr/bin/etex is a symbolic link
to pdfetex and it causes texi2dvi to invoke pdfetex. (That's how I first
found it out.) Should it be linked to tex instead? I've never use etex
at all, though.

Regards,
ST

Do you have a problem with this? It does generate .dvi files, so I don't
see any concern with this.

I'm building the Octave package (http://www.octave.org) from CVS and it
uses texi2dvi to generate the documents. It successfully generated the
pdf files but *failed* to generate the dvi files.

I've investigated further by using texi2dvi on a standalone texi file
(namely Octave-FAQ.texi) and as you said, both dvi and pdf files are
generated successfully. I observed that Octave comes with its a
"texinfo.tex" file of it's own and it's version is 1999-09-25.10. So
version incompatibility is the possible reason I can think of.

    "texinfo.tex" file of it's own and it's version is 1999-09-25.10. So

If the current octave documentation fails with the *current* texinfo.tex
(ftp://tug.org/tex/texinfo.tex), please report it to
bug-texinfo@gnu.org, with the actual error messages and a pointer to
where I can get the sources, etc.

Meanwhile, you might mention to the octave maintainers that their
texinfo.tex is woefully out of date.  If there is some reason why they
are choosing not to update, then I'd like to discuss it with them.  The
primary goal of texinfo.tex is to be useful for GNU packages like
Octave, after all.

I don't think this is related to the etex vs. tex vs. pdfetex question,
unless you specifically tested it, and the same .texi+texinfo.tex works
with tex and fails with etex.  It didn't sound like you did that.

    I just suppose etex is some sort of extended or enhanced tex. How is
    it related to pdftex? Some pointers to the literature will be much
    appreciated.

Surprisingly, I could not quickly find a concise explanation of this to
point you to.  I should write one, unless someone else can give a pointer.

tex is (in TeX Live anyway) still the original program as written by Knuth.

etex adds some primitives, mostly related to TeX programming, rather
than typesetting.  The manual is in a file named etex_man.pdf.
http://www.tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/etex/base/etex.html

pdftex adds primitives for the possibility of native pdf output from
tex.  More recently, primitives for other sorts of features, including
advanced typographical features (called "microtypography" or "hz") have
been added.  The manual is in a file named pdftex-a.pdf; see also
pdftex.org.

pdfetex combines etex and pdftex; in practice, this is what is used for
everything except (plain) tex, and it is maintained by the pdftex group.

Hope this helps.

    I'm still trying to learn the immense intricacies of texmf. :-)

We appreciate your interest and willingness to explore :).

In case it's of any use, http://tug.org/begin.html is my attempt at a
relatively brief collection of links for getting started with TeX.
(Comments welcome.)

Best,
Karl

Why do these packages ship texinfo.tex at all?  For it to be actually
usefull, one has to install a TeX system anyway - why not also require
to install texinfo?

I found the same in the Debian package of GNU make
(http://bugs.debian.org/322353), and the reason was that some ancient
texinfo version tested whether \pdfoutput is defined and set it to 1 if
yes.  The bug is fixed in Debian, and I guess upstream has been informed.

Message-ID: <200508251902.j7PJ2A919539@tug.org>

    Why do these packages ship texinfo.tex at all?

One reason is that a package might well need a newer texinfo.tex than
comes with the user's system.  Until fairly recently, all (GNU/)Linux
distributions had a texinfo.tex (and TeX in general) that was many, many
years old.

    For it to be actually usefull, one has to install a TeX system
    anyway - why not also require to install texinfo?

Requiring texinfo does not help.  Texinfo does not install texinfo.tex
(by default) and never has.  This is because I am unable to think of any
rational way for Texinfo, in its original GNU package incarnation, to
determine where to install it.  There is an install-tex target so
users/distributors who know where they want the files can install it,
but that's the best I've been able to do.

    some ancient texinfo version tested whether \pdfoutput is defined
    and set it to 1

Ah.  I didn't realize that was the problem.  Not necessarily that
ancient -- that whole \pdfoutput thing became an issue last year.
So if Octave, Make, or anyone else gets their texinfo.tex updated,
hopefully the problem will go away.

However, I'm a bit confused about why it was a problem in the first
place.  In TeX Live, we adopted an approach that kept compatibility, by
reading a file pdftex-dvi.tex when the non-pdf formats are built, which
undefines \pdfoutput and the like, precisely because of problems like
this.

Thomas, did you end up deciding to break compatibility in teTeX?  I
thought you had gone along with that, but maybe not.  Yeah, I think I do
remember that you didn't, after all.  So it goes.

Sure, I did.

teTeX-3.0 shipps with \pdfoutput defined (and set to 0) in etex.fmt and
latex.fmt. I have got a few mails about it, but nobody really complained.

Well, even Debian sarge (istn't that an ancient distribution already?)
has texinfo 4.7 which does it right (at least "right enough", AFAIR it
sets \pdfoutput to relax with original TeX).

    TeX Live on DVD has plenty of free space, so why not install the
    full package?). - 

Because the compressed TL on CD doesn't have space.  That's why the
issue of space comes up in the first place.  Having the CD and DVD
distributions be different seems very bad to me.

    similar situation (with mized Type1 and PK fonts) would occur with TeX
    Live's CBgreek fonts...

cbgreek is one thing (we made that change last year and I haven't
received a single mail about it).  Every document using EC/T1/Cork is
something else again.  One way or another, straightforward latex
documents using that encodings must continue to use only Type 1 fonts.

The fix-cm package in the LaTeX base distribution enables scalable fonts 
and avoids all the EC sizes of 20pt and above because they are butt 
ugly. For the T1 and TS1 encodings that amounts to app. 200 pfb files, 
so that would be about half the size, right?

Hi Karl, hi all!

Just FYI: The *DEBIAN* texlive packages will *not* install the cm-super
fonts, but depend on the
	cm-super
packages, which includes the full set of fonts, thus handling this.

This is my general idea: I take everything from TeX live, only if there
is a already a Debian package providing *superior* options, I make this
work together with the texlive-Debian packages.

Best wishes

I don't think they have to.  The missing fonts can be scaled in the map
files.

    why not include \usepackage{lmfonts} which is the correct and

That will continue to work but is not the point.  The point is that
Rolf's original simple latex document ends up using pk fonts.  That's
unacceptable.

As far as I can tell, the choice is either to restore all of cm-super
(and delete a bunch of other stuff to make room) or change the map files
so that lm is used.  I prefer the latter, if it will work.

I am writing Jacko about it now, as I don't see a map file for this in
the LM distribution.

well, if you consider acceptable to ignore difference in metrics for
scaled fonts and real fonts (optical scaling), then that can be done
to some extent.

(i mean, that you consider acceptable e.g. to use cmr10 at 17pt
instead of cmr17 - these fonts have different letter proportions, so
scaling cmr10 to 17pt ON THE MAP LEVEL will produce ugly result,
because ON THE TEX LEVEL, the real non-scaled TFM metrics will still
be used: in such approach you would be fooling TeX to have the wrong
idea on the glyph proportions of the fonts which will be used
de-facto, and that will result in poor quality)

it is far better to avoid such silent degradation of quality and
insist on user to use proper fonts: be it 10pt-only scaled ON TEX
LEVEL cm-super fonts (with \usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}), or
limited-size set of cm-super fonts (with \usepackage{fix-cm}) or LM
fonts (with \usepackage{lmodern}).

so, what you propose would silently degrade the quality in default
case without user knowing about that.

Best,
v.

    scaling cmr10 to 17pt ON THE MAP LEVEL will produce ugly result,

Well, there is no need to do that one in particular; lmr17.pfb exists.

In general, however, you are of course correct that LM does not provide
fonts designed at every size of EC file.  This is well known.  Obviously
we do not want to noticeably/unacceptably degrade quality.  So if the
result of scaling is unacceptable, then we would go back to including
all of cm-super.

However, there is a more basic issue -- as far as I can tell there is no
way to scale fonts in map files.  There is /SlantFont, /ExtendFont, and
/ReEncodeFont, but there is no /ScaleFont.

In fact, I now seem to recall discussing this with Hartmut, Hans, and
others, and concluding it was not going to happen any time soon.

So I guess we are back to the full cm-super.

I second that.  People who use TeXLive should have a look into the
README file to see TeXLive's font limitations, and how to circumvent
them.  We have to decide whether it is more important to have many
packages at the cost of less font files, or vice versa.

I wonder whether we shall create a fourth texmf tree (besides `texmf',
`texmf-dist', and `texmf-doc'), say, `texmf-dvd', which holds extra
stuff not available on the CD release due to space limitations.  This
would be the right place for the missing cm-super and cbgreek PFB
files, bold CJK fonts, etc, etc.

that sounds great - we can safely omit huge packages such as cm-super
and full cb-greek from the TeX Live "CD version", and put it to only
to "DVD version".

and in case of CD version it is better to not include cm-super at all
than to include a cut-down version to avoid confusion with mixed
Type 1 and PK fonts.

For T1 and TS1 encodings fix-cm is definitely the way to go. But it does
not change the T2[ABC] encodings, that are provided by cm-super, too.
Incorporating these encodings into fix-cm would be necesary IMO. But
still, that is something the user has to enable, just like type1ec with
option 10pt. 

Another factor of 2 in size can be achived with gzip + pfb2t1c (from the
cm-super/debian subdirectory). There would be quite a bit of saved space
if one would use it for all Type1 fonts in TeX Live and teach dvips/
pdftex/dvipdfmx about this format. No, I am not volunteering. ;-)

Something like /ScaleFont is not necessary, since Type1 fonts don't have
a size. Both cmr5 and cmr15 are drawn in the same coordinate system with
1000 units per EM, but they have different proportions.

BTW, a admittedly exaggerated example for what happens if one uses TFM
and PFB which do not fit together (needs pdflatex):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\pdfmapline{+ecrm3583 CMR5 <cmr5.pfb}
\begin{document}
\fontsize{36pt}{43pt}\selectfont Really huge!
\end{document}

I am not sure if anyone is willing to test *all* realistic substitutions
of EC by LM. In addition, cm-super is needed for T2[ABC] encoding, too,
which is not provided by LM. I know no good solution for all this. :-(

    I've just discovered that ttf2pt1 is compiled only for Windows.
    Please fix the scripts so that it is available on other platforms too.

Sorry, it's not just a matter of fixing the Makefile.  It has no
configure script, no support for srcdir!=builddir in the Makefile,
nowhere to hook in to use the libraries from the TL source tree, etc.

If you or anyone wants to integrate it into the build structure, that'd
be great.  Getting the changes back to the author would be even better,
if it's still being maintained.  I see at ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net that
the last release was 2003-12-31, and that we are several revisions
behind even that.

I think that statement by Frank is a bit difficult to understand without
a bit of context: The current teTeX setup in Debian has the bug that you
can install LaTeX (in tetex-base) without PSNFSS (in tetex-extra), which
is a required part of LaTeX. So there are discussions about how to
reorganize the teTeX packages. One of the paradigms being not to
separate metrics from fonts.

AFAIK the situation in TeX Live is even more complicated:
collection-latex includes PSNFSS, as it has to be. The LW35 fonts from
URW are in fontsrecommended. I am not sure where the actual font metrics
from PSNFSS are, as without metrics both PSNFSS and the fonts are a bit
pointless. But then, most will install fonts_recommended_ after all.
However, other fonts needed by PSNFSS are in fontsextra (charter and
fpl) or mathextra (pazo), where mathpazo.sty is the right way of using
Palatino with PSNFSS.

I guess there is no simple way to split a TeX system ... :-(

Hello,

I wiped out everything as recommended and reinstall with
	apt-get install texlive-latexrecommended
and now it appears that only latex.fmt is generated in
/var/lib/texmf/web2c (and not others). Is this the intended behaviour?

I try pdflatex as an ordinary user with no problems for pdflatex.fnt is
automatically generated $HOME/.texmf-var

Message-ID: <959a4dee48f85bde700cf195f5178f65@rna.nl>

I have been busy trying to get some performance measurements for TeX so 
I could see if the Mac Intel version I have performs OK compared to teh 
Mac powerpc version. So, I created a very small initial test (which 
runs the cration of pdflatex.fmt for 10 times in a row with output to 
/dev/null) to see if there were basic differences at 
file/filesystem/etc level.

The results I got were weird. Mostly they were in line with the single 
CPU integer speed of the hardware, but some testers reported times that 
seemed blazingly fast compared to others. First, the suspicion was that 
the OS version was to blame. But it turned out that a very large part 
of the performance development was just TeX itself.

As one person reported (for 10 times "fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex" on a 
system for the rest completely equal):

And I have seen more reports corroborating this. Let me stress: apart 
from TeX, this system is completely the same. Sometimes people report 
that their older TeX is about twice as fast as the newer. The big 
difference seems to have been with some web2c release, probably the one 
where most binaries were folded into pdfetex.

My personal idea is that first we need some sort of reliable test for 
an *installed* TeX. That is, a test that uses local binaries, local 
pool files, but that for the rest is independent of what is or is not 
on the system (search differences, size of texmf tree differences, 
language setting differences, font differences, etc).

In the past, default number of hyphenation pattern files was small.
In these days many pattern files are described in the default
language.dat. Thus format files become considerably larger.
I think this factor is significant in your tests to make
format files.

You should make sure your volunteers do these tests with identical
values for the variable arrays like main_memory.  Recent versions
of (pdf)TeX have much larger (and more, compared to Knuth's TeX)
array sizes, resulting in bigger malloc() arguments, resulting in
more time spent in system, but also in user, for the extra
initialization code (zero-ing 32MB of memory takes 16 times longer
than zero-ing 2MB of memory).

I suspect this is the problem, because ConTeXt has not become
noticeably slower, and ConTeXt has used large arrays all along,
so that would be consistent.

Also, are you sure that the trees are identical? Larger trees
and/or disk-access-enabled trees could account for at least some
of the extra time in user space.


Greetings, Taco

Well, the submitter spoke about some mal code sent to somebody, who

    Well, the submitter spoke about some mal code sent to somebody, who
    calls it and the LaTeX file does something really bad. 

As far as I know, foreign files can't do anything *really* bad.
As distributed, TeX will only write files (via \openout) under
TEXMFOUTPUT (if set) or the current directory, not to arbitrary paths.
And of course it only has current-user privileges, anyway.  And it won't
run arbitrary processes, either (\write18 is disabled by default), either.

As for reading, I don't see a problem in this scenario.  Fine, so this
foreign document can read /etc/passwd, and you process it and the output
contains a nicely (horribly) typeset version of /etc/passwd.  As long as
you don't blindly post the output on the web for all to see, I see no
problem here.  Nothing TeX does will get the information to anyone but
you, and you already had permission to read it.

The time I can see reading being a problem is in a TeX "preview" web
page scenario, where people can upload arbitrary documents or insert
arbitrary code.  In this case, setting openin_any=p makes all the sense
in the world.  (I doubt it is sufficient, but at least it is a start.)

Perhaps you can condense the above into a couple of sentences for
texmf.cnf :).
    
    normally I don't read very long documnents before processing them....

I don't either, but I don't see a problem with it.

    Agreed. Where can I find the docs for texmf.cnf?

I would either add text to the `Runtime options' node in the Web2c
manual, or add a new node `Security' as the last section of the
`Installation' chapter, depending on how much we have to say.

The individual options of texmf.cnf aren't systematically documented
anywhere but in the file itself -- the `Runtime options' node is all
there is.  (I don't think it makes sense to put this kind of information
where the syntax of texmf.cnf is discussed, which is in the Kpathsea
manual ...)

best,
karl

since one can open a file and write to it, one can overwrite a system file and mess up a machine; there is not much that one can do about it, (apart from setting permissions of files/paths) since tex jobs needs auxiliary files; just don't process files you don't trust

Reading this makes me feel good that I have not followed this
pdftex-dvi.tex in teTeX-3.0. Frank, thanks a lot for passing this report
to us. Maybe, TL 2005 should also stop using these "new hacks" now!?

Well, I know that arguing about issues like this can be very
disappointing. So, I won't argue about it. Someone else has to decide
about it.

    Maybe, TL 2005 should also stop using these "new hacks" now!?

Sorry, I continue to strongly disagree.  It will break thousands of
users documents -- like every one that tests for pdftex up until last year.

There is no good solution at this point.  Every compatible solution has
been broken.

Can anyone explain the difference between \pdftexversion and
\normalpdftexversion?  Has one release of pdftex two different version
numbers?

If you don't break them now, when are you going to break them?  If you
don't plan to break them anytime, have you already asked the pdftex
people to rename their primitives, so that they are usable again?

I don't know how long ifpdf.sty exists, but for sure it is longer than
just last year.  Ever since then anybody who wanted to do it right could
do it right.  And people where told to do it right in mailing lists and
newsgroups.

When we tried to compile all? Debian packages that Build-Depend on teTeX
before uploading teTeX-3.0 to unstable (it's currently in experimental),
it turned out that only a couple of packages actually had problems; most
notably debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-tools which are used by a lot of
other packages, but on the other hand that was easy to fix.

I would say the clear cut solution is good.

Indeed.  So there's no point in trying to stay compatible.  You can as
well adopt the clean solution and not fiddle with pdfTeX primitives.

Regards, Frank

?xorg and packages build-depending on it wasn't tested yet, since it had
other problems at the time.

I bet a keg of beer? that it won't take a year from today - now that
\normalpdfoutput makes it into google with this discussion - until the
first user (who still doesn't know that pdfTeX can produce dvi files,
but has read somewhere that \normalpdfoutput is "the proper way to do
the test") does the test with \normalpdfoutput, does it the wrong way
and does not fail because on his system (probably Debian sarge :-(
\dots) latex still uses etex as its engine.

How long do we want to wait until we break this user's documents?

    If you don't break them now, when are you going to break them?  

I don't know.  Not this year, in my view.

    When we tried to compile all¹ Debian packages that Build-Depend on teTeX

The problem is not software manuals, packages, etc.  All that is already
fixed or easily fixable, I don't mind breaking living documents.  The
problem is the ten zillion archived *user* documents.

As Thomas said, this is a painful subject to discuss.  Let's drop it for
now, please.

So if there is no good solution at all, why use the hack^2 version with 
\normalXXX?

The number of people who report problems on (de.)comp.text.tex is 
smaller than I had anticipated when the engines changed. When it happens 
they are told to use ifpdf and then that's it. More often than not they 
have already defined that \ifpdf switch themselves so it's easily fixed 
by simply deleting their own test and replacing with a package they 
already have installed.

I personally got hit by that same message about not running pdftex a 
week ago and I had to fiddle with a makefile in the cvs repository I was 
using to force dvi mode. Rather that than including a hackish solution 
that would restore \pdfXXX to its old state. I shall not repeat the 
words that came out of my mouth when it happened (they were in Danish, 
so...)

And yes, I'm also in a position where I think about backwards 
compatibility but in this case I don't see how we can a) decide to use 
pdfetex for almost everything and b) continue to hack our way around 
something that only ever worked due to shear luck. This way it's never 
going to be right.

I think now is a good time for me to be constructive:

What I think it very important is for stuff like The Not So Short... to 
include a description of the ifpdf package instead of what it does now 
(which is why I cc Tobias here). When I started out I looked at the 
source of that document and found out that I could just use 
\ifx\pdfoutout\undefined. I doubt I was the only one.

I'm wondering now.

When we discussed the \pdfoutput stuff on Mon, 5 Apr 2004,
I said:

    and you can't change this in the future.

And you said:

    Yes we can.

If you are sure that things that had been inroduced in the past can be
removed, so let us do it now.

Regards,
  Reinhard

	2005.08.27-1 online
Message-ID: <20050828063627.GA17793@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!
 
A new generation of Debian packages of TeX live are available on the tug
server, as usual
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

Note: If you had an older version of the packages installed, PLEASE
completely purge these packages before installing the new ones! 
tex-common (>= 0.7) takes over some files from texlive, and for now I
don't care to put Replace fields for texlive into tex-common.

Note 2: The texlive-fontsextra does *NOT* include the stripped down
version of the cm-super fonts, but Suggests the cm-super Debian package.
This package is for now available at
        deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ cm-super/
        deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ cm-super/

Note 3: I forgot to write in the last emails, the new texinfo is still
available at
        deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ texinfo/
        deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ texinfo/

Note 4: I am leaving for vacation NOW! and I will return on 11. September.
>From this sunday on (28.) I won't read any emails and won't work on TeX
live, but I hope to see these packages getting more testing.

Note 5: The 2005.08.24-1 versions are still available at
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/old/{pool,log}


My TODO list for the version after returning (not including all the
complaints I will get soon):
* Make control scripts set -e or so. Errors!
* uninstall still calls updmap etc even if not installed.
  The probem is that texlive-basic is *deinstalled* and *purged*, but the
  other programs are *only* deinstalled not purged. Then, the postinst
  is called
* why breaks dselect with the texlive-latexextra description (which is
  indeed a bit long)
* make /var/cache/fonts/ls-R writeable???



Changes since 2005.08.21-1:

version 2005.08.27-1 Sat, 27 Aug 2005 16:03:44 +0200

27.08.2005 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #7870
  * fix build dependency on libXaw7-dev | libXaw8-dev
  * Fix generation of formats of texlive-basic. The actual fmt.d files
    are in texlive-basicbin, but the .ini files are in texlive-basic,
    so actually the call to fmtutil should be in the postinst of
    texlive-basic. (Thanks to LUK ShunTim)

26.08.2005 NP
  * Do not include cm-super.tpm, but suggest the debian package cm-super,
    which contains the full set of cm-super fonts. For now locally
    available on tug.

25.08.2005 NP
  * Fix installation of README.Debian-source into all binary packages

version 2005.08.24-1 Wed, 24 Aug 2005 18:10:02 +0200

24.08.2005 NP
  * Everything is build with depot at change #7842
  * Really fix the info problem: Now all the info files are converted at
    install time to unix line endings. Thus also the strange ^M in the
    postinst script install-info commands should be fixed.

23.08.2005 NP
  * New source version, including up to perforce change #7836
    This includes fixed versions of pdftex, mpost, dvipdfmx, and as usual
    several updates to  (La)TeX packages.
  * fixes the dvips.info install problem
  * lm is now included in texlive-basic, so changed conflicts in tpm2deb.cfg
  * generation of /var/cache/font/* and various ls-R files has moved to
    tex-common (>= 0.7), thus also the changed Depends
  * Dependency on tex-common (>= 0.7) also fixes the lambda with all
    languages problem in dumping the format file

22.08.2005 NP
  * Include the included packages and their title in the long description
    of the control files, and generate the control files automatically.



Best wishes

Waiting now means waiting forever because the number of not living documents 
doing it wrong does increase not decrease so the argument to wait will 
enlarge not shrink.

So IMHO the answer has to be: don't wait any longer.

And: Is it more important that correct documents behave correct or that 
incorrect documents behave correct. Currently I can give you a correct 
document that will not make the same, correct, and expected result with TeX 
Live. I think compatibility with faulty documents must not hurt compatibility 
with correct documents.

I don't know what Heiko thinks about that but I doubt it would be that 
useful. Not because it's not a good idea but because chances are the 
user already has it installed.  Users with teTeX or TeXLive already get 
it installed from the start and MiKTeX users get it installed 
automatically the first time they try to use it if they didn't go for 
the full package when installing.

This has already been discussed with Thomas and Heiko.  It belongs
into tex/generic because it can be used with plain TeX as well.

latex/required/tools is a CTAN location, tex/generic a TDS path.  I think
that Martin suggests this latex/required/tools, because this is one way
to ensure that all LaTeX systems contain ifpdf.sty (at least all systems
newer than a given date).

CTAN directories do not directly map into installation directgories.
babel is one example which resides in CTAN:macros/latex/required, but
it it usually installed into tex/generic/babel in a TDS tree.

It would be a pain if one file in CTAN:latex/required/tools was
installed in a different directory than anywhere else.  Of course it's
doable, just another special case to add to the millions already there,
but it's much easier to operate with each directory being a chunk.

tex/generic
-----------
I agree that ifpdf is "required". However, ifpdf is not just a
LaTeX package, but it can be used by plain TeX users, too.
Some weeks ago Thomas Esser forwarded me the problem:

| because some plain TeX users might want to remove tex/latex from the
| search path.

Therefore Thomas and I agreed to put such packages of mine into
  TDS:tex/generic/oberdiek/

Together with Martin's idea the best place would be
  TDS:tex/generic/required/...
but this doesn't exist. Perhaps not too bad, because each has
different ideas about what is "required".

use in hyperref
---------------
I could use it in hyperref, without driver option hyperref
checks for pdfTeX in pdf mode. But I don't know whether this
is a good idea. Anyway it would put another argument for
TeX distributors to include ifpdf.

documentation
-------------
That is an easier issue, converting it to dtx format and
provide better user documentation.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek@uni-freiburg.de>

But do they know it's there and do they use it?

In an ideal world, the \ifpdf switch would be added to plain.tex
and the LaTeX kernel and after the next update the documents (if
not broken) would just work. Since both plain.tex and the LaTeX
kernel are in permafrost, we need other ways to get ifpdf
installed and used. Including it in required would solve the
installation (after a new LaTeX, of course), and the usage could
be solved by mentioning it in ltnews.

Currently, teTeX has such exceptions, e.g. for
  macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek

I agree that a simple CTAN -> TDS mapping would be the easiest thing
for everyone. On the other hand, I can also see some need for exceptions
like this.

And, to be honest, packages like xypic, amsfonts, pstricks etc. end up in
several places in a TDS tree. So, some really missing part is some glue
(metadata) and some tools which allow a flexible, reliable and automatic
way for doing the update
  CTAN -> TDS

I see, of course, that this is nothing that is implmented in a day
or two...

Message-ID: <200508290104.j7T14Ik25725@tug.org>

Back on this thread from a week ago (sorry).  I'm afraid I am quite lost.

    It would be good if we could find a better solution for checking for
    existence than putting the files into TEXINPUTS. 

I certainly agree that a primitive for finding OCP files would be ideal.
But since I gather there is no such primitive now (and never has been
and it will certainly be quite a process to create one), it seems quite
undesirable to simply break existing tests like Aleksey's with no
replacement.

Adding $TEXMF/omega/ocp// to the omega-related search paths, while
annoying, doesn't seem especially harmful to me, compared to the benefit.

    (Karl: it might make sense to extend the TDS for this -- explicitly
    allow tex/<engine> in addition to tex/<format>).

Seems reasonable.  The implication being that we would add
$TEXMF/tex/$engine to the search paths -- and $TEXMF/tex/omega to the
aleph/lamed paths, etc.

In the original mail, I see Alexej proposing that tex/generic/encodings
should be moved since it is Omega-specific.  I guess
tex/omega/encodings?  tex/omega/generic/encodings?
tex/omega/plain/encodings?  I don't know enough to say what's best.

What else, if anything, is omega-specific in the same way?

    why it is necessary to
    simplify its task by placing them together?

As explained in the rationale I sent earlier, the main issue is that
engines aren't really a good distinction, because they are so similar.
tex, etex, pdftex, pdfetex are all "almost" the same, and ditto omega
and aleph.  Most packages need no changes to run under any of the above,
and of the rest, most adapt themselves to whatever is running.  So
trying to put files under an engine-specific directory usually turned
out to be wrong; they actually ran under other engines.

I don't think there is any really good way to handle this, because of
all the inconsistencies and incompatibilities.  (Not to mention lack of
updates in the base programs.)

    For example, most lambda-specific files in antomega 
    also have unique names, but I hope this doesn't mean I have to 
    put them into tex/latex/ rather than tex/lambda/?

No.  As far as lambda is concerned, the search path looks like this:
TEXINPUTS.lambda = $TEXMF/tex/{lambda,latex,generic,}//

texmf/tex/lambda/antomega certainly seems like the right location for
your package.  Is there a problem with that?  I am confused about what
you need.  If you put your hyphen.cfg there, it will get read before any
hyphen.cfg under latex.

For reference, you can see all the current search path definitions at 
http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
It's nearly the same as TL 2004.  And all the formats do have their own
directories.  

This message probably just confuses things more, sorry.  It certainly
confuses me.

Best,
Karl

Why not this year?  Why do you think that the situation gets better over
time?  Just because other TeX distributions do the hard work for texlive? 
Then why not get together and do it now, making the painful time shorter?

@+ ledger
@+ 11x17

In fact, as pdftex is a tex engine that contains its own driver, it is a 
nonsense to have several paper size external options. Of course there is 
a default which is defined with the \pdfpagewidth/height primitives (in 
pdftexconfig.tex). But the good way is to set \pdfpagewidth/height at 
user level.

hyperref automatically sets their values (\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth 
\pdfpageheight=paperheight at begin-doc) : so if you call hyperref the 
pdf file dimensions are made coherent with the latex page dimensions if 
setted). I think the geometry package will do it too (provided it is 
able to recognize the pdftex engine :-)))

If you don't call hyperref you have just to say yourself
\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth \pdfpageheight=paperheight

    Please note that the B series in Japan has different dimensions than
    DIN B.  We should perhaps add b3j, b4j, etc.

I just received a note from Jerzy that a GUST member's investigations
found that the config.ps sizes were actually the Japanese sizes.

Whichever way it goes, it would certainly be good to fix this, and make
b3/etc. be the European sizes, and define b3j/etc. for the Japanese
sizes.

Can someone investigate and send the correct paper size definitions for
config.ps?  I would doubt any findings I came up with myself at this
point :).

The live/development config.ps is visible at:
  http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Master/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps
(except your browser will probably think it's a PostScript file, so have
to download it with wget or whatever ...)

 Dear Sir/Madam,

 I was wondering what I could do to create an image of your TeXlive 
 distribution -- but for additional platforms. I would then be happy to make 
 the binaries or an ISO image available to you and/or host it on my 
 university's servers. We run HP-UX on the ia64 architecture.

 I very much look forward to hearing from you!

 With best regards,

 Dr Kreil.

Message-ID: <B223E21E-B886-4EAE-BA56-C6D484A1411D@rna.nl>

blacklettert1 is part of TL but it does not seem to be part of Master  
in a ready-to-use state (I did not see the vf files for instance).  
Running the make also failed for me.

I do not know much about the system, but I got a request for its  
inclusion in my redistribution.

 From what I see, though, it seems a nonfunctional source  
distribution in TL.

What am I missing?

It looks like targets already exist. Please install them by setting
TEXMFDIR in the Makefile suitably.

Tobias has just updated TNSS... so now it uses the ifpdf package in the 
"testing for pdf mode" example.

Hi,
I just made a new release of plnfss.  See:

  http://vntex.org/download/vntex-support/plnfss/README.txt

You can download it from:

    http://vntex.org/download/vntex-support/plnfss/plnfss-1.1.tar.bz2
or
    http://vntex.org/download/vntex-support/plnfss/plnfss-1.1.zip

I uploaded it to CTAN as well but it is not installed there yet.

BTW., in teTeX's updmap.cfg some comments refer to
"http://vinux.sourceforge.net" but it's now "http://vntex.org".
Can you check this in TL too?

Cheers,
  Reinhard

Thanks.  I'll see what I can do, as soon as I have a chance.

It would be so much easier if packages came ready to use.  Having to
examine the intricacies of everybody's Makefile is not practical.  The
main script, Seb's ctan2tds.tl, looks for a `texlive' target but
otherwise ignores Makefiles.

Anyway, I know this is not your problem.  Thanks for looking into it.

I have looked into CTAN/fonts/gothic/blacklettert1.
texlive's blacklettert1 seems not to contain "targets".
Sorry for my mistake.

Do you know how and how fast this will propagate

- to CTAN

- to the translations?  Do we have to ask each of the translators?  

Oh, I just noticed that e.g. l2kurz, the german translation, doesn't
mention that at all.

Message-ID: <200508311408.j7VE88Y16150@tug.org>

Hello Dr. Kreil,

Thank you very much for offering!

    We run HP-UX on the ia64 architecture.

If you could build TeX Live for hpux, that would be great.

The easiest way to get the sources is probably with rsync:

  rsync -a --exclude=Images tug.org::tldevsrc /your/local/dir

It should be about 2gb.

Then go to the ./Build/source.development directory and run the
script "Build" there.

If all goes well, you'll end up with a bunch of binaries in the
inst/bin/ subdir.  However, every new architecture usually fails in
some new and "interesting" way, so let us know about any problems.

Once the binaries are made, we can go into more detail about testing +
distributing them.

Thanks again,
Karl

I know that Walter is planing a new version of l2kurz, so I am CC'ing
him here. Walter, in case you haven't included it already, please
mention ifpdf as the canonical way for checking for pdftex in PDF-mode.

Akira, does this format mean you have actual config.ps entries for them?
If so, can you send them?  (And if not, would you be willing to make
