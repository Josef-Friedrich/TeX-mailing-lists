I don't plan to make any more package updates for TL 2005 (didn't make
any today, either), and am rebuilding the images now.

This still won't be the final image, though -- the German doc still
needs updating, at least, which I know Klaus is working on.  Optionally
perhaps Vladimir and Manfred will rebuild powerpc-aix, sparc-solaris,
and i386-freebsd for the new devnag, but this is not critical.

I imagine Staszek still has some tlpm tricks up his sleeve too :).

Thanks everyone.

How did you guess? :-))
Well, I updated tlpmgui, top level polish readme, but also added 
new bin-getnonfreefonts.tpm, then remade the .iso images.
todo: 
1. german documentation
2. source/source-win32.zip to zap as outdated.

That's finish from my side. Many thanks to everybody involved.

Regarding the custom-bib problem, there were actually a newer version of 
norsk.mbs on CTAN (dated 2005-06-03), for some reason that one didn't make 
it into TL.

Patrick Daly just informed me that he will upload a new version of 
custom-bib, including the correct norsk.mbs (already on CTAN), the correct 
dansk.mbs (which you have already fixed in TL) and a new version of 
merlin.mbs.

I don't know if it's too later to include them.

I guess because there was no announcement and custom-bib as a whole
wasn't updated.  Anyway, whatever.  I updated norsk.mbs now.

    I don't know if it's too later to include them.

It's too late for a new custom-bib, unless it happens in the next ten
minutes or so :).  So it goes ...

Actually, it would help to systematically replace `$HOME' with `~' in
texmf.cnf, e.g, from

	TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf
to

	TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf

In the first case, the generic variable-expanding code is invoked,
which doesn't try to eliminate spurious slashes.  In contrast, if the
code that expands a `~' uses the value of `$HOME' it knows it is a
special case and will strip a trailing slash.

Are we sure ~ gets expanded right on Windows?

    >> My $HOME env var was set to "/home/thomas/". Running "kpsewhich

Overall, I don't feel compelled to make a change at the last second to
fix this, although I have no real objection.  I doubt TeX is the only
program that fails when HOME has a trailing /.  (I know it's used for
ftp-only configurations, but ftp-only configurations can't run any
commands to get confused. :)

Couple minor doc things just in, so the present rebuild is not the
last.  Didn't really think it would be :).

at http://tug.org/texlive/Images/test.  I'll wait a while before
promoting them to the current release, updating all the web pages, etc.
In fact, that all might not happen until next week.

Testing is welcome, but I sure hope no stoppers will arise!

Can't say for sure until the discs are burned, but if what I just made
turns out to be final, I guess it will be #8640.

(I rebuilt the images again just now, as Manfred put in some new freebsd
binaries.  As he is the one who actually delivers the images to the
production company, he is entitled :).  I did the small custom-bib
update at the same time, since it had already propagated on CTAN.)

    > Now on to setting up svn ...

I was planning to set it up on tug.  (I had it basically working earlier
this year, until the disk crashed.)  Unless someone else (you?) have
time and energy to do it?  I guess you have svn running already, right,
but do you feel like dealing with importing TL?  I wrote some
scripts and configured some stuff in svn to deal with it ...

No, definitely not. I am using the alioth.debian.org svn server for all
my stuff. And my knowledge about svn consists of 5 cmds I need, and
svn-buildpackage for debian stuff. Basta.

Sorry, but here I cannot be of any help.

Dear TeXLivers,

     I downloaded and burned texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso, and tried a 
installation, on my  winXP-SP2 machine.

     I chose to install it on c:\Program File\TL_2005\

     TLPMGUI worked OK.

     But... with pdfetex, I think I ran into the "space in pathname" 
problem :

when I type, on a command line, the exact following line (in one line)
pdflatex "c:\Program File\TL_2005\texmf-dist\tex\latex\base\sample2e.tex"

I get the following answer :

This is pdfeTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.30.3-2.2 (Web2c 7.5.5)

1 - you can't use \ in path names with TeX (guess why ...)

2 - the double quotes you used are removed by the command line
interpreter, so you need to quote again the pathname.

  As a matter of fact, I didn't type the command line I mentionned. 
TeXnicCenter did it for me. I will have to learn it how to do that, but it 
doesn't look impossible.

Hello
May be you are faced with an long existing error in the 
outputprofiles of TeXNicCenter.
Please check the LaTeX => PDF Profile. Find the entry for arguments
send to the compiler. It should read as
-interaction=nonstopmode "%Wm"
Probably it reads 
-interaction=nonstopmode "%pm"
now which causes the error.
Compare with the other profiles. They all should be ok out of the 
box.

[...]

That's the only solution working so far.

- I didn't succeed in including another pair of double quotes, as
suggested Fabrice (patterns  like "\"%pm\"" don't work)
- I tried "%sPm", which should give the 8+3 form with /, didn't work, as
well (pdfetex breaks the name at the ~ character)

(Seems that this discussion belongs to TexnicCenter topics rather than
TexLive's. If it continues, I'll stop Cc: the texlive list).

Yes, but for Windows we still have 1.30.3, fortunatelly working with the 
same .pool and without bug 377 (the most important).

I think the texlive people or Thomas Esser probably know history and

Hi,

there's a small typo in a comment in updmap.cfg - I just assume that
it's also there in texlive, but didn't check:

    pdftosrc is a small program build on top of the xpdf libraries, so it
    uses the same code for accessing pdf objects as pdftex. I'd say that
    if the pdftex maintainers are willing to maintain pdftosrc, then the
    program should be installed (not only build) and that something like
    the manpage that you have submitted should be added.

My opinion has not changed since then. I have no idea why pdftosrc is no
longer installed. Maybe, Olaf Weber or Martin Schr?der can say something
about it?

Message-ID: <20051106143901.GA881@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all!

As TeX live 2005 is out I am working on fixing the packages and
everything I can find which could be problematic.

And here is a problem concerning dependencies: 
Disclaimer: This is only relevant ot the debian packages.

collection-pdfetx includes the package pdfpages
the Package pdfpages depends on the packages eso-pic
but eso-pic is in collection-latexextra

With the normal TeX live installer this is not a problem, as the
selection *actually* is on the package level. BUt in Debian I have to
define dependencies between packages! And as collection-latex depends on
collection-pdfetex, it is not a good idea to add a dependency from
collection-pdfetex to collection-latexextra :-{

Similar problem:
collection-pdfetex includes texpower
texpower depends on tpslifonts
tpslifonts is in collection-fontsextra


How should I continue with this, any suggestions?
Make a Enhance? Make a Suggest? Ignore the problem and ignore the bug
reports coming in?


2 similar problems were easier to solve:
pstricks depends on pst-uml
pst-uml depends on multido
multido is in generic-recommended
	I let collection-pstricks depend on collection-genericrecommended

collection-latexextra contains beamer
beamer depends on pgf
pgf is in collection-pictures
	I let collection-latexextra depend on collection-pictures

Just use Suggests (or Recommends if the style file in question is
central to the package; pdfpages and texpower are probably not).
Remember the definitions of the dependencies:

,----
| Depends
|     This declares an absolute dependency. A package will not be
|     configured unless all of the packages listed in its Depends field
|     have been correctly configured.
| 
|     The Depends field should be used if the depended-on package is
|     required for the depending package to provide a significant amount
|     of functionality.
`----

This is clearly not the relationship between collection-pdfetex and
collection-latexextra.  As for the decision between Suggests and
Recommends, ask yourself whether the packages "would be found together
with this one in all but unusual installations" or not.n

reasonable decisions. I think you just have to keep making them.
after all, there will be many many more - dependency info
between packages is notoriously lacking in TeX-world.

Hi Heiko,
sorry for the late response and thanks for your suggestions.

If we talk about a scheme for a doc tree, let's forget how texdoc and
texdoctk work today.  I think that they can easily be adapted.

You mentioned different languages.  We have indeed documentation in a
lot of languages already, so it would be nice to have a standardized
scheme to find a document describing a particular package in a
particular language.  For instance, if we have

TDS:doc/en/...
TDS:doc/de/...
TDS:doc/fr/...

programs can evaluate the locale settings ($LC_ALL or $LC_LANG) first
and if they do not find something appropriate, default to English.
If English documentation doesn't exist, search for whatever fits best
(documentation for german.sty exists only in German, AFAIK).

Your proposal <package_dir>/<any_file> is also reasonable, especially
if there is texdoc-index.{html,pdf} file (or simply index.{html,pdf}).

Another point is that there are sometimes two versions of a file, one
for screen preview and one for printing.  Hans Hagen has files
<file>-s.pdf and <file>-p.pdf.  I don't think that we want to have
separate directories for these files, but I think that there should be
some conventions.  I provided lshort-vi.pdf and lshort-print-vi.pdf
but I'm not very happy with it because it doesn't comply with any
standard.  I think that Hans made the first step.  Note that texdoctk
has a [view] and a [print] button already, and it would be nice to
view the file in color and print it in b/w.

IMO we need some guidelines describing how to arrange documentation.  

When I provided lshort-vi and amsldoc-vi I really missed such
guidelines.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <437018AB.4000602@pakin.org>

The problem described in the 12AUG2005 comp.text.tex thread, "CTAN update:
arev" also applies to TeX Live:

     http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/c06bbcd9527c99e8/4f04f9d06de194e2#4f04f9d06de194e2

Basically, to get the arev package (included in TeX Live) to work one also
has to install the mathdesign package (*not* currently included in TeX Live)
and ensure that arev's .enc files are installed someplace dvips can find
them, as opposed to in arev's default location.

Here's a minimal test document which can help you determine if arev and
mathdesign are installed properly:

     \documentclass{minimal}
     \usepackage{arev}

     Does this $\steaming$ work?

Hi,
the .enc files are in fonts/enc/dvips/arev in TL2005 as well as on
CTAN.  Is this wrong?

Hmmm...I guess not for TL2005 as it's already configured to look there:

     % kpsewhich -progname=dvips arevoms.enc
     /mnt/tmp/texmf-dist/fonts/enc/dvips/arev/arevoms.enc

(This was a problem for an old teTeX distribution I also use.)

Mathdesign needs fonts which cannot be distributed on a CD/DVD because
their copyright is not appropriate or at least unclear.

For this reason TeXLive-2005 now has a backdoor.  If you have the
*latest* version of TL2005, there is a UNIX shell script,
"getnonfreefonts" and a symlink "getnonfreefonts-sys".

This script downloads and executes a script "getfont" from
ftp://tug.org which then downloads and installs the fonts.
getnonfreefonts installs to $TEXMFHOME and getnonfreefonts-sys
installs to $TEXMFLOCAL.

There is a manpage for getnonfreefonts, but you get more up-to-date
information with "getnonfreefonts --help".  The latter will also tell
you which fonts are currently supported.

To access the manpage, set MANPATH=..../texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH, unless
you did this already.

You must have at least one of the following programs installed on your
system: wget, lftp, ncftp, curl, snarf, or gftp.

I just added support for mathdesign.

  > \usepackage{arev}

Yes, after running getnonfreefonts it works for me.  Please let me
know whether you have any problems.

Thanks for the info and the test file.  Life is easier if people provide
test files.

  Reinhard

Since what date is this in the system, because it is not in my binary

    IMO we need some guidelines describing how to arrange documentation.  

There seems to be two areas -- (1) giving recommendations to package
authors about what to provide, what to name it, and tips on creating it,
if available, and (2) recommendations to distributors on how to organize
doc across many packages.

For the latter, there is a difference between documentation packages
(like lshort), and documentation of packages (e.g., grfguide).  For
example, for TL I don't see any purpose in having en/de/etc. levels in
texmf-dist or texmf, but texmf-doc, perhaps the current full names
should be changed to the abbreviations.

About the "=" sign. This might be of no help but I use

pdflatex -output-format dvi blah.tex

with no "=" sign. This resembles more the man page and works for me.
However, the man page also tells us to

pdflatex -src-specials cr,display,hbox,math,par,parent,vbox blah.tex

but this does not work for me: instead I have to use

pdflatex -src-specials=cr,display,hbox,math,par,parent,vbox blah

with the "=" sign

Quoting Karl Berry <karl@freefriends.org>:

Certainly.  This is a necessary first step towards a packaging system that
requires less effort from maintainers and works for users.    Two examples that
merit study are Debian and the R-project.  Something along the lines of the
Debian Policy Manual:

 <URL: http://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#policy> 

could provide a rationale and give details (e.g., TDS) in appendices.   

R-project packages are distributed in binary .zip archives for Win32 and source
.tar.gz for unix/linux.  Documentation source uses a format (Rd) that can be
converted to tex, html, or text. 

So, guidelines for documentation will be more useful if presented in the larger
package management context -- the vision of effective package managment will
encourage authors to follow the guildlines and there will be a rationale that
makes it easier to understand and follow the spirit of the guidelines.  With the
examples of Debian and R I think it is possible to write guidelines that will
work without actually
having all the tools in place.

There are some larger issues that cause confusion:

1) For many users, TeX is integrated with their editor.  This creates several
problems:  a)users don't know about command-line tools, there is a disconnect
between the installed version of TeX and the documentation the user actually
reads, and b) the editor is confused with the tex distro ("I need tex on my
linux machine but have to install wine so I can run WinEdt").  Since few
editors provide online TeX manuals, users are left with the printed material
they find in the library and whatever usenet postings google can find.  You
have a people trying to use TL while reading from the original LaTeX book and a
dog-eared copy of  the local
guide from the site where they learned to use TeX.  The guidelines should
suggest that editors which allow the user to run TeX also provide access to the
associated documentation.

2) Users have difficulty describing the tex system they are actually using when
requesting help from package authors/maintainers.  My experience suggests that
the average user is actually using some mixture of 2 or more tex distros,
although the increase in ViSTA (Viruses, Spyware, Trojans & Addware) does mean
that many Win XP systems have a short time between reinstalls.  Many users have
collections of macro packages that they keep either in the directory with their
documents or in a user texmf tree, but they fail to install the accompanying
documentation, so the documention they can read if they know how to find it
doesn't match the packages they are actually using.  
 
3) Differences in package management approaches.  On Win32 and *n*x sites where
sys. admin's responsibilities are limited to security and  backups,  packages
are installed by and for individual users.  Users coming from a Win32
background aren't familiar with the notion of packages that are shared across
many users, and expect to find a simple mechanism to install updates from the
net.

I prefer a scheme that keeps all the translations together so a user can easily
decide which language to read if their first choice isn't available, so:

  package/user.man-en.pdf --> User Manual for Package
  package/user.man-fr.pdf   --> Manuel d'Utilisation du Package

(If the names are standardized, document viewers can provide translations)

The guidelines also need to recommend using tools that result in searchable 
pdf's so google and other indexing tools can make sense of them.  Package
documents are often used as templates by users, so they should be reviewed to
ensure they are good examples for a user to follow (including publishers' 
instructions to authors).

    I also wonder whether we should provide documentation as DVI or PS at
    all.  If the doc tree can be accessed by Google

The TL tree is public -- tug.org/texlive/Contents.  I've gotten google
hits on it from time to time.

    (which would be great), only PDF makes sense.

I don't think there is much .dvi or .ps left in the TL tree.  What there
is is just because no one has systematically expunged it.  And CTAN only
requests/requires pdf.

$ find texlive2005/texmf*/doc -name "*.pdf"|wc -l
   1129
$ find texlive2005/texmf*/doc -name "*.ps"|wc -l
     50
$ find texlive2005/texmf*/doc -name "*.dvi"|wc -l
    482

I think that there are still too many .dvi files, I hope that they do
not have references to graphics to include.  This always causes
trouble.

Message-ID: <86veywhchx.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Hi,

some Debian users have complained that the initex symlink is missing
from teTeX 3.0, and I couldn't tell them the reason. Thomas Esser told
me that he didn't recall the reasons either, but that the discussion
leading to this decision should be in the texlive archives, or the web2c
release info.

I didn't succeed finding it in the texlive archives, and all I could
find in web2c was

but that's not really the background that will allow me to convince our

To get the format right regarding search paths and array sizes, the
right --progname has to be used. And, even more, the format must be
build with the same engine that runs it (example: a "tex" based initex
will generate an unusable "latex" format, since latex is run with the
pdfetex engine). So by removing "initex", we have removed a common source
of problems.

People using a tetex based system should use fmtutil for all format
creations to avoid common problems.

    So by removing "initex", we have removed a common source of problems.

It is a common source of problems these days, yet it has also been
documented and used since day 1.  For this reason, I recall asking Olaf
to reinstate initex and inimf (don't care about any of the others) --
but it seems TL'05 won't have it, so you'll be happy about that :).

Just removing it also has the disadvantage that people who simply run
`initex' on a system with more than one tex installed (like everyone who
uses TL) will get the wrong one.

Perhaps it should be a shell script next time around:
#!/bin/sh
echo "initex and inimf are too problematic to use directly any more."
echo "Please run fmtutil on teTeX and TeX Live to make formats."
echo "See http://whatever/whatever for more info."

Wdyt?

what would Don think if:

- we drop dvi in favor of pdf
- if we extend tex to do this or that
- if we change the way binaries are organizes (no initex)
- if we adapt computer modern fonts
- if ...

don't worry, Don is way more progressive than some users think; also, he 
either uses web2c (which has had the --ini fro years) or compiles his 
own stuff;

Several times i've heard him respond "why wasn't that done ealier ..."

>So the thing seems to be a little emotional :-(
>

for a long time initex has been integrated; a quarter of a century ago 
it  made sense to distribute two binaries, one with initialization code 
and one without (making more mem available for the real thing)'

the (in your case symlinks, but better think of it as separate binaries) 
were no longer used and replaced by the --ini switch

concerning emotions ... similar thinsg happened with dropping computer 
modern bitmap in favor of type 1 outlines

tell your users that it's called progress (just as assembler was 
replaced by n-th generation languages); for the die-hards: tell them 
that most of tex is still written in pascal -)

Hans

ps. actually, with regards to compatibility i'm more concerned about the 
fact that last years tex binaries no longer run on freshly installed 
linux's (this library thing); it makes it nearly impossible to run older 
trees (frozen for projects) on new(ly installed) machines; so there are 
worse nightmares for your users than a missing initex -)

since tex live uses the 'only docs with source' criterium, they then 
qualify for ommision (since graphics are source as well)

I don't know whether this is intentional or not, but this give me some odd 
problems

A user posted this on a Danish group (well he had a blank line bwetween 
the verbatintex and the %&latex lines, so the commandline parsing didn't 
work untill that was removed)

But now here is the odd thing running the following

%%% test.mp

verbatimtex
%&latex

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\begin{document}
etex

beginfig(1);
dotlabel.bot(btex $\mathbb{R}^2$ etex,origin);
endfig;
end;

through mpost (from TL 20051101 on Linux) gives you something like this:

[22]boromir:~/tmp/mp-bug> mpost test.mp
This is MetaPost, Version 0.901 (Web2C 7.5.5)

what's up with that

newer: target file `test.mpx' doesn't exist.

line? It's gone the next time the file is compiled. Is this just a new 
feature or what's 
happening?

The whole initex stuff is marked as system dependent, and thus fair
game, anyway IIRC.

Lars, thank you for reporting this.  I'll fix it and send Olaf a
patch.  Until then you can ignore the message.

It simply means that the mpx file doesn't exist and has to be
created.  The background is this:

John Hobby's version of newer accepted only two arguments.  To make
this program more useful I wrote one which can have more than two
arguments, so that you can write:

  if newer *.tex abc.dvi; then 
    tex abc.tex
  fi

I also added a --verbose option to report missing files.  Olaf found

Just for completeness, is it an error or just bad reporting, because the 
output in the first run seems to be ok.

Otherwise we might need to tell people that from now on you will have to 
to an initial to times run for each new metapost file one compiles.

Actually, I understood that request as asking for etex, pdftex, etc to
recognize "initex" as a special name, so that _if_ they are called
through an initex symlink, "ini" mode is enabled.  But I did not
reinstate the symlinks themselves.

Message-ID: <20051115090914.GA6332@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Dear friends!
 
A month has passed since the last version of TeX live for
Debian occured on the tug server. Since then TeX live 2005 has been
released (ok, still inofficially, but the depot is finished). I have
invested quite some time for getting the packages into shape, there will
be no changes in the .orig.tar.gz files (I hope) and hopefully no big
changes in the debian stuff.

I am now seriously asking every potential sponsor to take a look at the
package. Neil, Alex, maybe one of you have the time?
 
Current Version: 2005-0.1

As usual, see 
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html
and get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

The most important change probably is the inclusion of a consistency
check. At the moment it checks for: double inclusion of tpm-packages
into different debian packages, unresolved indirect dependencies from
package-tpm to package-tpm, not included packages.

The maintainer scripts have been reworked and they should now be more
standard, also reducing the repetitive calls to mktexlsr etc.

I will start trying to install over a tetex3 and see what
happens. Also the other way round.

As usual, the log files of the creation process are in 
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
The file lintian.log shows that the errors/warnings are getting less.
The two errors now present are rubbish, lintian is stupid on this. I
have to file a bug report on this.

Please give the packages a test if you are running sid.

Complete ChangeLog entry for this version:

version 2005-0.1 Mon, 14 Nov 2005 20:11:34 +0100

14.11.2005 NP
  * remove build-dep on tex-common
  * Rework maintainer script handling, separate out the creation of
    maintainer scripts into a function, allow only to create the
    maintainer scripts for checking.
  * move the extra format configuration from the snippets/post scripts
    to tpm2deb.cfg.
  * Building a first prerelease version. The scripts used are from
    svn revision 134.

11.11.2005 NP
  * Fix a failure in setting the executes, thus there were some map files
    missing.

09.11.2005 NP
  * Don't forget dh_strip

08.11.2005 NP
  * Fixes for big cleanup part I.
  * Create all rules file from tpm2deb.pl, make the rules subdir
    unnecessary.

07.11.2005 NP
  * Big cleanup in the script, part I.
    - make config file syntax more readable
    - create infrastructure for all kind of tests by reading in all tpm
      data and store it in a hash
    - separation of functions handling with tpm data, config file
      reading and hash creation from the debian functions
    - work on more packages in one go is now possible, thus the tedious
      reading of all the tpm files is not necessary anymore

05.11.2005 NP
  * TeX live 2005 is done. It includes everything up to perforce change #8640.
  * Make a new set of tpm/licence files
  * allow independent building of orig.tar.gz files
  * do not create empty control files
  * remove old fmt/log files in the postinst script prior to creating
    them new to get rid of leftovers.
  * include a lot of checks that dependencies are going right


Best wishes

Up to now you should *NOT* upgrade from a old version of the texlive
packages, but purge completely. I think this is ok so, for prerelease
packages I don't have to provide an upgrade path. And since the packages
are not in Debian up to now, no upgrade path at all has to be taken into
account.

Only for next version (after -1) this is important.

There are some more warnings, as the packages install lintina overrodes,
too. Maybe I comment on them and you (or any other DD) can give me his
ideas:
lintian-override:
	zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory
		some of these files are actually needed, like empty
		index files
	extra-license-file
		see below
	script-not-executable
		the source of many font packages etc contain script
		examples, but I don't want them to be executable.

other lintian problems (from lintian.log):
	shell-script-fails-syntax-check a2ping
		can someone PLEASE explain me how to fix the script
		header of a2ping? I tried but didn't succeed! Here it
		is, it starts quiet strange, but actually works very
		nice:
#! /bin/sh
eval '(exit $?0)' && eval 'PERL_BADLANG=x;export PERL_BADLANG;: \
;exec perl -x -S -- "$0" ${1+"$@"};#'if 0;
eval 'setenv PERL_BADLANG x;exec perl -x -S -- "$0" $argv:q;#'.q+
#!perl -w
package Htex::a2ping; $0=~/(.*)/s;unshift@INC,'.';do($1);die$@if$@;__END__+if ! 1;
# This Perl script was generated by JustLib2 at Wed Apr 23 09:14:13
# 2003.
# Don't touch/remove any lines above; http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/justlib

	spelling-error-in-description
		this is actually an extremly stupid lintina error.
		I guess the problem is that 'german' is written lc once,
		in the following line:
		german -- Support for German typography.
		where the first 'german' is a package name.
		How to overcome this stupidity?

	manpage-section-mismatch
		I have seen this in tetex, too, can I ignore this, or
		override this?
	
	manpage-has-errors-from-man
		Ok, the long and old Umlaut/latin1 story man cannot show
		without encoding the characters. I will try to fix all
		of them ...
	
	unusual-interpreter

		seems to me not to be *very* unusual. fontforge is in
		debian, so why not use it.
		Should I replace it with 
		#!/usr/bin/fontforge

	configure-generated-file-in-source
		yes true. But I don't repack now. Maybe for next

I guess we have to go through various more prerelease incarnation (or
are you content now?), they will be -0.2, -0.3, etc.

The first release actually uploaded will be -1.

This is what I got as a recommendation for preparing packages before
first upload.

Good with me. I gues I have first to somehow eliminate the two lintian
errors (please someone helps me!).

License issue: I left license files in the respective places, and
collected as much information from the Catalogue into a license file.
Furthermore I included the license statement of TeX live as distributed.
I hope that this is enough.

> Does this sound ok?

How to continue? I propose:
. try to fix a2ping header error with some help
. create new packages with version number -1 for experimental
. you upload

What did I miss?

I just wonder why the following AFM files from Adobe are missing in
the TeXLive repository:

  AvantGarde (pag*8a.afm)
  NewCenturySchlbk (pnc*8a.afm)

All other AFM files from the 35 standard PS fonts are there...

Note that the corresponding pag*.tfm and pnc*.tfm files are available
in TeXLive.

Hi there,

Ok, the packages are currently building fine on my box.

I've got a few issues:
1) you mention at http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html that there are
issues with upgrade paths. Have these been resolved?
2) The additional lintian warnings should be cleared up, especially
warnings reagrding man pages.
3) The version numbering system think it's an NMU. This should really be
-1 rather than -0.1 for inclusion in the archive.

As this is such a big package, and could potentially clog up the
ftpmaster's time, I'd like to make sure the packages are ready for
release and have been tested throughly. I'd suggest that we make the
first uplaod to experimental for this.

Does this sound ok?
Cheers,
Neil

Hi,

I just tested the preliminary test image texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso.
Everything works fine under SuSE 9.3. However, I have found some 
packages which could be updated:

texpower:   TL 2005 beta contains 2004/07/27 v0.1b
             current (texpower.sourceforge.net): 2005/04/08 v0.2
tpslifonts: TL 2005 beta contains 2003/05/29 v0.6
             current 2004/07/27 v0.6d


seminar.bg2: TL 2005 beta contains 1997/11/20 v1.6
             v1.7 1998/05/22 can be found at 
www.tug.org/applications/Seminar/seminar.bg2

             v2.1 2002/05/31 !! can be found inside
http://www.tug.org/applications/Seminar/SemDemos.tar.gz

Yes, I know that there are better packages than seminar and that it's 
not up-to-date. But there are a few users at my site still using it. In 
this context I would suggest to add Seminar-FAQ.ps.gz to the doc tree 
because it contains the results of all examples.

Further, the package ltxtable.sty is missing in tex/latex/carlisle. Just 
run source/latex/carlisle/ltxtable.tex and mv ltxtable.sty to the 
appropriate place.

These are all minor issues and it could be too late for this years 
release cycle. But perhaps they can be updated next year ;-)

It is not updated on CTAN. Sorry, we cannot scan the whole world
and CTAN *is* and *should be* the definitive source for any update

    and CTAN *is* and *should be* the definitive source for any update
    in the distributions.

Right.  Torsten, if you could ask the respective maintainers to update
CTAN, that would be greatly appreciated.

    Hmm, strange. Why that's no simply ltxtable.dtx?

Only DC knows :).  Anyway, I see Rolf N. reported the same problem back
in June.  Apparently I didn't fix it for real.  Well, there's always
next year.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <11269.1132230642@www30.gmx.net>

Dear list, 

I just installed texlive on my ubuntu 5.4

In terminal my texlive binaries are found very well, but emacs doesn't
find them.  It seems that emacs doesn't search them were I put them
(/opt/tex/bin/i386-linux).

When I ask emacs: (getenv "PATH") C-x C-e

The answer is:
"usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"

At the emacs e-mail list I was told my problem is a global one, not of
emacs, so the solution should be a global level.  Can you please tell me
what
does that mean? (They won't)

Should I make links of all texlive executables to /usr/loca/bin ?
And, how could I do this at once?

Or should I change change some other general files?

Thank you in advance,

Martin.

if you use Debian (ie Ubuntu) it would make much more sense to install
the Debian TeXLive packages; details at

that way, your TeX softwrae will be under proper package management

Hi Martin,

    Should I make links of all texlive executables to /usr/loca/bin ?

I don't recommend it; the exact list of executables changes every year.

    Or should I change change some other general files?

I expect you already know this, but the basic idea is to add
/opt/tex/bin/i386-linux to your PATH, in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc or
some such initialization file.  (Which one depends on your shell -- do
you use bash?  What does echo $SHELL say?)

In any case, if you do 
  echo $PATH
in your terminal, what does it show?  I'm puzzled as to how it can be
found in the terminal and not by Emacs.

Maybe you have PATH set in your .profile or .bash_login, but not
.bashrc?  In this case, your .bashrc could read .profile (or
whatever), as in:
. $HOME/.profile

Another possibility: did you log out and log in again?

I have never used Ubuntu, but I expect you can change the path
systemwide by editing /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc or some such.  This
shouldn't be necessary though.  I suspect it's all about your personal
startup files.

Hope this gives you a couple clues, anyway ...

I do it in a different way since there are several methods how to get the
shell. I use bash and all personal settings are in .bashrc. My
.bash_profile contains:

if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi

Thus I have the same environment not depending whether I sit at the
computer, whether I go there via ssh forme somewhere else, or whether
someone else is logged in to the server and I obtain my shell from his/her
terminal by su. I use the same technique on Fedora as well as on Debian.

Yes, source.development -- source will/would remain untouched until the end
of the 2006 cycle.

Except that when and if I get our whole thing working with subversion,
our plan is to get rid of that level from the repo and use a branch
instead, as is the more usual method of handling these situations.

    Currently, I've only checked out `source', and I don't see

There have been no updates to any part of the repository since the final
images were made, and this is good.  Later for that ...

Message-ID: <20051123214734.GA3403@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>


Dear Neil, dear all!

Tomorrow is my birthday and this conincides nicely with the first
release I want to see going into experimental.
It fixes all the problems, installes/remove/installs/purges nice, works
quite well. I have invested a lot of work in the last weeks, build about
20 versions, checked, reimproved ... See the changelog below for
details.

Unfortunately I have to say that ther *WAS* a change in the .orig.tar.gz
files, so who ever (Neil) builds from source, you HAVE TO GET the new
.orig.tar.gz files. Sorry for that, but this was the last time.

Please, for the last time, PURGE all of the texlive packages, from now
on there will be decent upgrade paths.


Current Version: 2005-1

Get it at
 	deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/
 	deb-src http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/ pool/

(www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html is *not* updated)

As usual, the log files of the creation process are in 
 	http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian/log/
All the lintian errors are overriden or fixed, only the missing manpages
are still there. I can (and will not) not do this now, to write 40 man
pages. This is for later.

Complete ChangeLog entry for this version:

texlive-publishers (2005-1) experimental; urgency=low

  22.11.2005 NP
  * re-add updmap-sys call to the postrm scripts
  * make updmap-sys silent in postinst script
  * make fmtutil-sys silent in postinst script
  * make mktexlsr silent in postinst script
  * change depend on tex-common to >= 0.11 for TEXMFSYSCONFIG change
  * First release to be uploaded into experimental, based on scripts 
    revision 154.
  * Upload sponsored by Neil McGovern <maulkin@halon.org.uk>
  21.11.2005 NP
  * fix lintian source override installation
  * fix etex/pdfetex format generation problem
  * remove the 04TeXlive hack as the change will go into tex-common 0.11
    rather soon
  * remap only a few config files (those for programs) to /etc/texmf/texlive
  * try to fix the conundrum with format generation. This is a complete
    upstream chaos (ok, also upstream I created the chaos ;-). Should be fixed
    rather soon.
  20.11.2005 NP
  * fix invocation of grep in common.functions to add || true, since grep
    returns if no match found
  * fix installation of TeXlive.cnf as 04TeXlive.cnf into /e/t/texmf.d
  * add a overriding TEXMF variable to 04TeXlive.cnf which includes
    TEXMFCONFIG without !! (Should actually be fixed in tex-common!)
  * remove the long invocation of language.dat
  * fix merging of common.functions into postrm and prerm
  * fix regexp for installing lintian.override files
  19.11.2005 NP
  * add common.functions and merge it into the maintainer scripts
  * change check for the existence of a format from kpsewhich fmt.ini
    to a fmtutil-sys --listcfg check (in common.functions)
  * Leave the map files in TEXMFMAIN and do not remap them to /etc/texmf
  * New configuration file handling, all the files are left in their
    normal place and config files to shadow these files should be put 
    into /etc/texmf
  * Add override for TEXMFSYSCONFIG to /etc/texmf
  * give the updmap.d, fmt.d, and language.d config snippets priority 10
    and only the us language snippet the 09 priority.
  * create a README.Debian
  * lintian override for a2perl header problem
  16.11.2005 NP
  * add a distribution entry to the ChangeLog file and make tpm2deb.pl
    aware of it
  * fix all remaining man page warnings of lintian
  * load tpm data from a dump of the %TpmData using perl::Storable,
    significantly speeding up the initialization time at source-deb
    building time.
  * add additional override for texlive-langgerman that german is correct
  15.11.2005 NP
  * fix the man page errors (wrong char and ttf2pt1)

Message-ID: <17285.17298.873174.41223@zarniwoop.ms25.local>

Hi,
unfortunately I did run install-tl.sh first after TL-2005 had been
frozen, so here are some suggestions for TL-2006:

The main menu has 3 (too narrow) columns.  There are some items which
are quite unclear, for instance

[X] PostScript and Tr
[X] Support for publi
[ ] Win32 support pro

On the other hand, about 1/3 of the menu items are 

[X] <language> docume[...]

My suggestion is to remove the latter from the main menu and add it to
the language collections.

Then the main menu then needs only two columns.

As far as "<language> documentation" is concerned, I don't think that
it makes sense to install support for a particular language without
documentation.

If disk space doesn't matter, people can install the whole TL.  On the
other hand, if disk space matters, it makes more sense to install only
packages for languages people need and it is quite unlikely that
someone wants support for Vietnamse but not lshort-vi.pdf.

Also, there are some menu items

[ ] Ghostscript for W
[ ] Perl for Windows
[ ] Win32 support pro

They can be removed by install-tl.sh (sed -e /Win/d).


When install-tl.sh has done its work it asks to set PATH.  I think
that it should ask to set MANPATH and INFOPATH properly as well.  And
it makes sense to add a whatis(1) database to TL.  It is quite
difficult for a user to run makewhatis(1) if the man pages are on a
read-only file system.

There had been a discussion about initex on the teTeX list.  If
MANPATH is set properly and the whatis database is up-to-date,
"apropos initex" will point people to tex(1).

I must admit that the current behaviour of makewhatis is quite
useless but it is not a big problem to use a modified version for TL:
Instead of

 tex, virtex, initex (1) - text formatting and typesetting

"apropos initex" should provide:

 tex, virtex, initex: tex(1) - text formatting and typesetting

makewhatis is a shell script, so it is not a big deal to change it.

When I use getnonfreefonts(1) to install mathdesign, pdftex complains
about duplicate entries in pdftex.map for md-chb7m, md-chb7t, and
md-chb7y.

pdftex.map looks like:

md-chb7m MathDesign-CH-Bold-MathItalic-10 <md-chb7m.pfb
md-chb7m ?????? <md-chb7m.pfb
md-chb7t MathDesign-CH-Bold-OT1-10 <md-chb7t.pfb
md-chb7t ?????? <md-chb7t.pfb
md-chb7y MathDesign-CH-Bold-Symbol-10 <md-chb7y.pfb
md-chb7y ?????? <md-chb7y.pfb

The "??????" entries come from TL though TL doesn't provide mathdesign
at all.  The easiest way to avoid this problem is to provide a recent
version of mathdesign.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

    The main menu has 3 (too narrow) columns.  There are some items which
    are quite unclear, for instance

There are many things I'd change about the Unix installer, but it seems
there are always higher-priority things that must be done.  If you or
anyone would like to spend some time on it, by all means.  Your
suggestions about the various packages and columns sound reasonable to
me.

    it is quite unlikely that someone wants support for Vietnamse but
    not lshort-vi.pdf.

I suppose, but I don't see a big reason to preclude the option for users
unfortunate enough to be short on disk space, that is, to absolutely
force installation of all LL documentation for a language LL.

    it makes sense to add a whatis(1) database to TL.  It is quite

Sure.  As above.

    "apropos initex" will point people to tex(1).

Which is wrong in itself, per the recent thread.  The man pages could
certainly use plenty of work and updating.  Again, I fear it's not
something that's likely to ever get to the top of my list.  (Let alone
hacking makewhatis.)

    md-chb7m ?????? <md-chb7m.pfb

Hmm, I'll have to investigate where those bad entries came from.  Yes,
including the mathdesign fonts next year sounds good.

Thanks,
Karl

FYI, as some of you know may already know, SIL has released the OFL
version 1.0
(http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=OFL).
I have attached it, and their explanatory FAQ.

In this version, they weakened the selling clause to be like of Vera for
Gnome (can't sell by itself, but selling in conjunction with anything
else, e.g., Hello, World, is ok).  Since this was deemed acceptable for
Vera, I am going to presume it is acceptable here as well.  (I've asked
rms and licensing@gnu.org for a ruling, but don't expect that to happen
soon.)

This seemed to me like the major stumbling block to the previous draft
being a free license.  So my opinion of the moment, barring further
input, is that this license is ok for TeX Live and other free software
distributions.  Which means that we will soon be able to distribute
Gentium, if we can create the necessary TeX support :).

Neil has uploaded to experimental, so as soon as (could take month) the
ftp-masters check through the packages, *and* are a bit happy, there
will be the first time texlive in debian/experimental.

After the ftp-masters have accepted, I guess I will open a bottle of
good wine. (Not that I don't do this now and then, but maybe I once
allow myself a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino, since I am living so
near to Montalcino).


Best wishes

Message-ID: <dm7c9i$j5o$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hi all,
I tried to install TeXLive 2005 from "texlive2005-inst-20051102.iso",but
for some reasons linking fails:

Unpacking zip files for packages...
..........................................................................................................warning:

.


And indeed for example pdflatex is just an ASCII-File containing
"pdfetex" (without LF):

lasar@mixit:lasar 53 % ll
/export/home1/lasar/texlive2005/bin/i386-linux/pdflatex
-rw-r--r--  1 lasar ls11 7 2005-11-25 16:22

lasar@mixit:lasar 54 % cat
/export/home1/lasar/texlive2005/bin/i386-linux/pdflatex
pdfetexlasar@mixit:lasar 55 %

System is latest stable Debian, file system type ist ext3. TeXLive
2003+2004 run fine.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,
   Christian

Hi Christian,

    Any ideas?

Something about the unzip program and/or options being used?  I seem to
remember some issues around this during development.  (Might check the
archives.)

We used zip 2.3 to create the zip files, and it was working ok all
during testing with unzip 5.50.  install-tl.sh (aka install-compr.sh)
just does unzip -o -qq zipfile.zip.

If you just want to get on with life, try installing from the live
distribution, which doesn't need to unzip anything.

HTH,
karl

Hi Karl,
this might be the reason, but if so, there must be an other reason, why
I am the first one (on this mailing list) suffering from this bug :). So
I do some further investigations and found, that there has been an
update to unzip (date: 2005/11/21 ) due to a vulnerability
(http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=321927):

lasar@mixit:lasar 64 % unzip -v
UnZip 5.52 of 28 February 2005, by Debian. Original by Info-ZIP.

Latest sources and executables are at ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/ ;
see ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html for other sites.

Compiled with gcc 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13) for Unix (Linux ELF) on Nov
17 2005.

UnZip special compilation options:
        ACORN_FTYPE_NFS
        COPYRIGHT_CLEAN (PKZIP 0.9x unreducing method not supported)
        SET_DIR_ATTRIB
        TIMESTAMP
        USE_EF_UT_TIME
        USE_UNSHRINK (PKZIP/Zip 1.x unshrinking method supported)
        USE_DEFLATE64 (PKZIP 4.x Deflate64(tm) supported)
        VMS_TEXT_CONV
        WILD_STOP_AT_DIR
        [decryption, version 2.9 of 05 May 2000]

UnZip and ZipInfo environment options:
           UNZIP:  [none]
        UNZIPOPT:  [none]
         ZIPINFO:  [none]
      ZIPINFOOPT:  [none]

I am *not* sure, that this is the reason for my problem, but if so and
if other distributions patch unzip the same way, no one (or no not-root
user) will be able to install TeXLive 2005.

Best regards,
   Christian

Hi,
I want to supplement, that installation is fine on my home system (opensuse
10.0). I am also using a non-root account here and unzip does not seem to
be fixed (yast online update log).

Glad to hear it.

If an unzip refuses to do anything with symbolic links, I don't see
there's much we can do about that.  I hope you or someone can
investigate to see when and why it really fails.

Best,

reports and suggestions are welcome.  (The bugs page for TL already

The last lines and the line containing the warning are the most interesting
ones. I would be glad, if someone with an uptodate Debian system could
check if she/he can observer the same problem. If so, you could remove
symbolic links from zip and create them automatically in the installation
script.

Best regards,
    Christian

Hi,

Klaus Hoeppner reported the same bug with his Debian 3.1 system, but he
succeed with self-compiled binaries (thanks). People like me (unable to
mount an iso-image or burn a dvd) maybe can also download "unzip" binary
from homepage (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html), install it
into an local directory, ensure it is first on the PATH and then install
TexLive 2005. My little test script is fine with this solution, I will
check TexLive CD on Monday.  Funny: the binaries are zipped and contain
symbolic links, but just ignore the warnings :).


Best regards,
    Christian

    Klaus Hoeppner reported the same bug with his Debian 3.1 system, 

Sounds like a bug in that Debian version of unzip ...

    mount an iso-image or burn a dvd) maybe can also download "unzip"
    binary from homepage
    (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html), install it

I added this info to http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html.  Thanks.

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <C814C483-20A8-450D-8900-63516E71B121@rna.nl>

Suppose I have an .fd file with some special font like a light  
variant of the main font or an ultrablack. I can define these in an  
fd file

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{gwfoo}{s}{n} {<-> gwec-foodemibold}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{gwbar}{l}{n} {<-> gwec-barlight}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{gwopa}{u}{n} {<-> gwec-opaextrablack}{}

But how do I access these in LaTeX? There is no \textub{} command for  
exttra black.

Or: How could I create a sty file where one could have (for a rich  
family) a set of the light+demibold or the normal+extrablack as 'set'?

This is all doable in ConTeXt, but is it als doable in LaTeX?

1. You can select all by one command:
\usefont{T1}{guopa}{u}{n}

2. You can switch just the font series (NFSS will supply alternative it it
is not available for current family):

3. Define \textub:
\newcommand*{\textub}[1]{{\fontseries{u}\selectfont #1\/}}

I do not understand what exactly you need. First you must have the .fd
file. If you wish to have your family as default, you can do it similarly
as in times.sty, e.g.:
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{guopa}
You should also define command for switching the extra font series
similarly as above. The style as well as the .fd file must be in a
directory where LaTeX expects such files. You find the list of such
directories by
kpsewhich -show-path tex -progname latex
If the directory is preceded by !!, you must ru mktexlsr after inserting
the files.

Of course. And fntguide and The LaTeX Companion have the details.

Hi Karl!

I hope life after release of TL2005 has settled down a bit and the
discussions about Lucida fonts are going well!?

ATM I have a different question: In the course of trying to get TeX live
into Debian, a discussion about the licensing of XyMTeX occurred. Short
background:

Kevin McCarty wanted to package XyMTeX for Debian, and found several
interesting license conditions in the files contained in the
distribution of XyMTeX. Afte consulting the debian-legal mailing list he
wrote an email to the author of XyMTeX to clear up the license
statements and got back, in essence (see full email below):
	I regret to say that only personal redistribution (except CTAN)
	is permissible.
Interstingly, the files state something a bit different:

% Copying of this file is authorized only if either
%
% (1) you make absolutely no changes to your copy, including name and
%     directory name
% (2) if you do make changes,
%     (a) you name it something other than the names included in the
%         ``xymtex'' directory and
%     (b) you acknowledge the original name.
% This restriction ensures that all standard styles are identical.

which seems to be ok in the sense that it is LPPL (more or less).

But as the explicite statement of the author does not permit
redistribution (and thus not even in TeX live), it would be nice if we
could ask him again if this is his intention, or if it wouldn't be
better to license the files as LPPL, allowing redistribution as
specified there.

If you agree with this interpretation, that the files would have to be
taken out of TeX live, we (actually Frank K?ster suggested this) would
like you to ask him again about the license condition, as you are
responsible for TeX live (and more famous ;-).

If you think this is not your job and/or you don't want/have time to do
this, I will ask him myself, but better you than me!

Thanks a lot and all the best

Norbert

Hi Norbert,

    I hope life after release of TL2005 has settled down a bit 

Well, just redirected into other areas :(.

    Interstingly, the files state something a bit different:

A "license" statement clearly taken from tex.web, so I'm glad it is not
considered nonfree :).

    we (actually Frank Küster suggested this) would
    like you to ask him again about the license condition, 

Ok, I will ask him.

Cheers,
karl
