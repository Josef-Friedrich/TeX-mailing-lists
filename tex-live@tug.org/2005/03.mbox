I should have mailed before now to say that upgrading from PDFTeX 1.20
to 1.21a fixes the problem with the particular PNG file I had being
recognised. What I did was (where $TEXLIVE is the root of our TeXLive
tree):

$ unzip pdftex-$VERSION.zip
$ cd pdftex-$VERSION
$ ./Build
$ cd build/texk/web2c
$ cp pdfetex pdfxtex $TEXLIVE/bin/i386-linux
$ cp pdfetex.pool pdfxtex.pool $TEXLIVE/texmf/web2c
$ PATH=$TEXLIVE/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH
$ fmtutil --byfmt pdftex
$ fmtutil --byfmt pdflatex

I hope that this is correct and sufficient, but don't know for sure.

Many thanks to Karl and to Martin Schr?der for their assistance.

Message-ID: <1109674574.10124.81.camel@pc118>

A user here (not the same one) has reported another problem in TeXLive
2004 (on a modern Linux system):

> $ mktextfm bbold11

I can reproduce the problem by running latex(1) on:

The problem doesn't happen with 10pt bbold in TeXLive 2004, and with
neither of 10 or 11pt bbold in TeXLive 2003.

(I wish these users had found these problems in the several weeks I
allowed for local beta testing of TeXLive 2004 on Linux, and not now
I've made it the default here! I don't really want to revert to TeXLive
2003.)

HI Sebastian! Hi all!

I wanted to ask why the fonts from the musixps-unix package are included
in TEXlive (in musixtex.tpm) but not the (necessary) additional files:
./doc/musixps/readme.txt
./dvips/musixtex/psslurs.pro
./fonts/tfm/public/musixps/mxsk.tfm
./fonts/source/public/musixps/mxsk.mf
./tex/musixtex/pmx/pmx.tex
./tex/musixtex/musixps/musixps.tex
./tex/musixtex/musixps/slurs.tex

(maybe the pmx.tex is not directly related, but useful anyway)

Can I include them in the musixtex.tpm? Should they go into a differnet
directory or stay there?

Best wishes

Not just you.

I suspect panix is having problems again.  They are a favorite target

Dns lookups actually succeed for me, and the domain is not expired, but
the web site is not responding.

Probably best to just wait a couple days.

Hi John,

I get the same error with TL 2003 and bbold11:

$ PATH=/usr/local/texlive2003/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
$ mf-nowin -progname=mf '\mode:=ljfour; nonstopmode; input bbold11'

I suspect the bug has been there "forever" and is in the original bbold
MF code.  The bbold files haven't changed, plain.mf hasn't changed, the
same jknappen bbold11.mf file is generated ... could always be a bug in
MF itself, but it doesn't seem likely.

Alan, do you have any inclination to look into this in the bbold MF
sources?  The bbold11.mf file is simply these two lines:
design_size := 10.95;
input bbold;

Thanks,
karl

Do I have to manually add the files to the respective .tpm file
(musixtex.tpm) or are they rebuild automagically? (I think I have asked

All stupid me, I mixed up two thing.

ANyway. I have added a tpm file musixadd which includes ATM only the
musixps (postscript slurs) and pmx support files (pmx.tex).


P4 changelog:
        Added new package musixadd which includes musixps and pmx
        support files. Added musixadd to collection-music.

Files:
        //depot/Master/texmf-dist/doc/generic/musixps/readme.txt # add
        //depot/Master/texmf-dist/dvips/musixps/psslurs.pro     # add
        //depot/Master/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/musixps/mxsk.mf # add

        //depot/Master/texmf-dist/tpm/musixadd.tpm      # add
        //depot/Master/texmf/tpm/collection-music.tpm   # edit

The sizes of musxadd.tpm will not be right, but they are recomputed, so
I don'T care.

I see now that I had to work around this problem in TeXLive 2003 also. I
agree that it's likely to be a long-standing bug, but am not expert
enough to suggest where the root lies.

Akira Kakuto, referring to the bbold11.mf file that mktexfm(1) generates
and leaves in $VARTEXMF/fonts/source/jknappen/sauter, writes:
> It will succeed if you change as
> 
> design_size := 10.95;
> input b-bbold;

TeXLive 2003 supplied b-bbold.mf in
$TEXDIR/texmf/fonts/source/public/sauter, along with the other Sauter
Metafont files - 46 in all. TeXLive 2004 supplies the other 45 Sauter
Metafont files in $TEXDIR/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/sauter but
omits b-bbold.mf. It is necessary to put that file back in the TeXLive
2004 installation (and run 'texhash') to make Akira's work-around above
work. I think we'd all be grateful to anyone who had a proper fix,
though.

The Blackboard Bold typeface is a historical fudge in any case - whose
origin is the pseudo-bold characters that mathematicians and others
wrote on blackboards with chalk because drawing proper bold glyphs would
have been too much effort. Some Blackboard Bold glyphs such as N, Z, R
etc. have, of course, long been adopted as symbols in their own right.

got this sorted.  It was a matter of environment variables.  The version of
ghostscript within the texlive wasn't working but once I added
s:\gstools\gs7.04\bin\ to the PATH all worked well.

Thanks to all for the help.  I'll try and document this for the win32 page.

Fantastic!  Is that a public archive we could all try out?  Any chance of
the /etc/apt/source.list stanza?

possibly next week.  I am working on it to show at EuroTeX next week,
so I have a deadline of Sunday to get the remaining bits in place.

this is NOT the "proper" solution as discussed at some length
in recent months with Frank. This is the nasty hack, but  I wanted
to clear up a few things like the texmf.cnf, and postinst updating
of ls-R

I cannot change pdf[ex]tex.pool, since it could introduce incompatibility

but we have to have the new pool, or its useless!

since TL is not supposed to be stable any more, its OK
to break the other platforms.

The following is a part of the mktexmf:

sauterroot=`kpsewhich b-$rootname.mf 2>/dev/null`
if test -n "$sauterroot"; then
  rootfile=$sauterroot
  rootname=b-$rootname

Thus a proper fix is to copy b-bbold.mf into
$TEXDIR/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/sauter/

Then mktexmf will generate a correct bbold11.mf.

Ok, since it seems that you want to *use* the new stuff now: I have just
added texmf/texconfig/tcfmgr and texmf/texconfig/tcfmgr.map which are
needed by the new texconfig / updmap / fmtutil scripts.

Many thanks. It seems also that we need to adjust install-tl.sh

Apologies, but I am still struggling with installation.

I received the three discs from TUG.  I placed the Tex-Live CD in my 
drive, which mounted and I brought up the icon for "install-tl.sh".  
However when I click on it, the system says there is no application to 
run the installation.  I get the same result if I try from a terminal

Thanks much.

Basically, the doc for Unix installation should hopefully be workable

Subject: [tex-live] debian packages status report
Message-ID: <4229DFAE.3050409@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

I have done a fair bit more work on Norbert's script to
make Debian packages from  tpm metadata, and it seems
to work now. I mainly hacked at making post and pre installation
scripts, and folding  the small hyphenation and binary
packages into larger collections. I now have 77 packages,
which seems plausible.

For the moment, I have installed into /usr/share/texmf, and put binaries into /usr/share/texlive/bin, which are then symlinked to /usr/bin. This works, but it is not very proper at all. We now need to review the exchanges between Frank
and Norbert and sort out some of these placement issues.
We also need to check the installation scripts against teTeX
and make sure the behaviour is the same. We also
need to make it all work with multiple architectures.

Can anyone else look at this to assist Norbert? I am going away for 2 months shortly, which means I won't be touching TeX at all until June at the earliest.

Dear TeXLive:

The fontname distribution contains a file named index.html (basically
a table of contents) and one named Index.html (a topic index). In any MS 
windows/DOS system these are not distinguishable. I reported this to the
fontname maintainers a year ago, but I haven't seen any change.

Now I have noticed that TeXLive2004 contains only the first file (or else
the second one is invisible to Windows). Perhaps the TeXLive people can
have more success than I had in persuading the fontname people to change
the name of Index.html.

Remember that I suggested to have a "tex-common" package.  It could take
care of all the merging of information from the different packages into
a common updmap.cfg, fmtutil.cnf, etc.  However, I'm currently getting
some hope that teTeX-3.0 will make it into sarge, and therefore will
concentrate my work on this.

yes, that will be a good idea. it would be fairly
easy to make the TL stuff depend on that, I think.

    Thus a proper fix is to copy b-bbold.mf into
    $TEXDIR/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/sauter/

I'm reluctant to copy it into public/sauter since it's not part of the
original sauter distribution.  It turns out that b-bbold.mf has never
been included in TL, as far as I can tell.

On CTAN, it is in the fonts/cm/sauter/addons/ directory, which includes
a number of other files:

b-bbold.mf   b-cmrisz.mf  b-cmrz.mf    b-ilcmsb.mf    b-stmary.mf   cyrillic.mf
b-cmbizx.mf  b-cmritz.mf  b-czinch.mf  b-ilcmsi.mf    b-wasy.mf     cyrl.mf

b-cmbxsc.mf  b-cmroz.mf   b-icmex.mf   b-lasyb.mf     c-lcircle.mf  cytextit.mf
b-cmbz.mf    b-cmrs.mf	  b-icmmi.mf   b-lcircle.mf   c-line.mf     cytitle.mf

b-cmrcz.mf   b-cmruz.mf   b-ilasy.mf   b-linew.mf     cyitall.mf

I don't know where they all came from.  Most of those Cyrillic files
already have other versions in other directories, with numerous
differences.  Sigh.

I guess we can just copy b-bbold, I suppose cleaning up this mess would
be a bit much to ask at this late date.

Any thoughts?

Hi all!

I made a p4 sync and Master/texmf/ls-R suddenly had permissions

which is bad since no one else than me can read this file, which breaks
our whole system here on the insitute.

Is there a reason for this, or did I configure something wrong?

My p4 client options are

Or is there another reason for this problem?

BTW: p4 sync -f ls-R made the permissions right to
	-r--r--r--

I got my TeXLive DVD and went happily for the long install,
just on the hopes of being able to use the new version of 
"tex4ht" which is a nice piece of software but with 
incomprehensible installation instructions.

I finish the installation of MikTeX, did the Synchronization 
and update of new packages but that did NOT list "tex4ht" even 
though a new package was made available on March 01.

Went on to try, but to my surprise it does NOT work straight 
out of the box. On a small file like:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) = e^x \]

\end{document}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It bombs out and complains of "Illegal storage address" and the file
contains no MathML, as one would expect.

Here is the bottom of the error message:

if you installed MikTeX from the DVD, this is a MikTeX issue,
not a TeX Live issue.

by the way, you won't get MathML from a vanilla run of TeX4ht,
it defaults to making a bitmap image.

It was my own mistake. There was still a --with-x11 somewhere so it 
became

	--with-x11 --withoutx11 --without-xdvi

and this resulted in xdvi being made.

Why not the inst ISO image for TL 2004?
And maybe the protext 1.1 image.
That's what I was thinking.

I know it seems like only yesterday that TL2004 was done,
but it seems sensible to establish a timetable for TL2005 now.
My impression (correct me if I am wrong) is that not a lot
needs to change. There are:

 - many packages updated (eg last week's new release of the LM fonts)
 - bugs fixes (eg in libpng, and bits of pdftex)
 - small improvements and additions
 - infrastructure changes (eg the changed environment variable names in 
new teTeX)

Martin, can you summarize the state of pdftex? 

My suggestion is

   May 1st: source freeze
   May-June: compile fest
   June 15th: texmf and install freeze
   July 15th: total and doc freeze

from my point of the view, this means that I cannot do
much of the texmf work, as I shall be out of contact in
April and May, but I'll get things up to date at
the end of March.

I guess we'll be without Windows executables, unless
someone steps forward with necessary setup and abilities.

Karl, I fear the burden will fall on you of updating and
checking the install scripts, in light of the infrastructure
changes. I wish I could see a way forward there to
a new installer....

I see Siep is on the list.  Siep, do you have any plans to continue to

It looks quite nice, but without any installer or previewer, and being
based on teTeX 2.0.2, it'll take some doing to be useful to distribute

As I see, the main problem is to have new binaries for Windows (from
so unix oriented web2c sources).
The installer can be made by some new people (Pawel Jackowski, Bob 
Margolis, perhaps Klaus Hoeppner).
Anyway, after my investigation, people still wait and need TL (web2c
compatible) also for Windows.

Kind regards,

I very much want to second this.  MikTeX may be nice and all that, but
as a TeX and free software developer it is relevant to me that stuff I
develop under Linux will work as similar as possible under Windows.
Having a TeXlive based on the same sources and trees is a real life
saver, regardless of whether MikTeX might possibly provide a superior
solution for Windows-only users.

Agreed whole-heartedly.  We're a mostly windows house but we don't use
MikTeX because there are some Linux people and it's great to have a totally
common setup.

    As I see, the main problem is to have new binaries for Windows 

Agreed.

    (from so unix oriented web2c sources).

Fabrice uploaded his sources last year and they are in the repository
and distribution.  That can be a starting point.  There is no need to
start from the "Unix oriented" sources.  It's not like starting from
scratch!
    
    The installer can be made by some new people (Pawel Jackowski, Bob 
    Margolis, perhaps Klaus Hoeppner).

Ah, I'm glad to hear that!  

    Anyway, after my investigation, people still wait and need TL (web2c
    compatible) also for Windows.

There is no question that it is desirable.  No one is arguing that
point (although many people seem to think so).

The *only* point is that someone *has to do the work*.  So far, no one
is.  I have asked everyone I know/come across, and posted many times in
many places over the years asking for volunteers; no one has come
forward.  If anyone here knows people who are skilled and interested,
please ask them!

All I'm saying is, if the choice is to release without Windows or not
release at all (and so far, that is the choice), I think we should
release without Windows.  Maybe *that* will cause Windows developers to
finally come forward.

It's a volunteer effort.  If no one volunteers, well, the work won't get
done.  It's that simple.

afaik fabrice still maintains his sources if only because he needs them for 
xemtex; so i wonder what 'starting point' means here since they are still ok;

the only thing fabrice dropped doing for tex live was the installer

texlive is both

- the reference texmf tree
- a reference binary distribution

i can imagine multiple binary variants to operate on the same tree (currently 
miktex ships his own); i'm also curious what will happen with the miktex-unix 
variant if that one surfaces; in that case we have multiple binary variants for 
most platforms (all capable of operating with the reference tree)

If there is real interest, I would consider resurrecting them,
especially if they would be included into the main sources.

The patches consist of a small set of actual patches, which
shouldn't interfere with a normal Unix compile, plus some
Windows-specific sources slightly adapted from versions by
Fabrice, plus some scripts for preparing the source- and build
trees. [pdf][e]tex, dvips and various font utilities could be
compiled with these patches, but the mk... utilities aren't
addressed.

My and Taco's immediate motivation was being able to provide
Windows executables to others of our TeX-related stuff for
testing and that explains what is and isn't there.

The original set was meant to support cross-compilation, but
compilation with MinGW is what matters most, since almost
everybody has a real or virtual Windows system around somewhere to
install MinGW and MSYS on.

But I am a slow worker, and the most I could hope to finish before
the deadline is getting the patches to work with a more current
source tree. 

We still need somebody to coordinate all the pieces that go into a
Windows version, and it isn't me.

A couple more points: 1. pdf being as prevalent as it is, a
previewer is not as essential as it used to be. 2. There are
nowadays some very nice open source Windows installers, such as
NSIS and Inno Setup.

I disagree.  The documentation tree of a complete TeX system should in
my opinion be built using dvi wherever possible.  Much faster access
and usually more compact size.  In contrast, the prebuilt
documentation on CTAN should preferably be in PDF: easy access without
having to rely on the specifics or even existence of a particular TeX
system.

I'd actually like the .dvi files to be built using Source Specials
pointing to the respective source tree, so that one can jump between
source and DVI easily where the editor permits this.  And while we are
at it: having a special command harvesting the .ind files and storing
the macro definition information in a central database file would come
in handy.  Then I could use a command line tool or my editor to access
the definition and/or description of, say, \DeclareRobustCommand, with
a simple command.

if there are some brave i386 Debian users there, they 
could try adding

  deb http://www.tug.org/texlive/Debian binary/

to their /etc/apt/sources.list file, and then doing

 apt-get update
 apt-get install texlive-latexrecommended

and see what happens. don't kill me if it
fouls up your systems, but do make suggestions
to improve it. 

obviously the other binaries need adding for those
architectures where one encounters Debian; and
I need to set up a system for keeping these
packages up to date.

If one wants to stick to dvi documentation, then an alternative
solution would be a documentation browser which converts dvi to
ps/pdf on the fly.

NSIS has various exec functions and a postinstall callback hook.
Its uninstall facilities look ok to me.

As to my MinGW patches: my thinking had been that a MinGW-based
Windows version would require a lot less separate maintenance than
than an MSVC version. But there doesn't seem to be much point in
targeting a revived a Windows version of TeX Live if nobody steps
forward to take it on. Anyhow, if and when there is an update of
the patches I'll announce it on the texlive list.

But I'll have a look at the free MSVC compiler too.

That's not an alternative since it is dead-slow even without an extra
conversion.  One of the main points about DVI viewers is that they are
fast, and also that they support Source Specials.

    the only thing fabrice dropped doing for tex live was the installer

Fabrice himself has said that he is dropping support for DVI output, DVI
previewers, bitmap fonts, and some indeterminate set of utilities.  I
realize full well that he, you, and others do not care about these
things, and there's no reason you should spend time on them when you
don't care about them, but this is not universal.

    i can imagine multiple binary variants to operate on the same tree

Me too.  Christian told me that he is not opposed, in principle, to
using the texmf-dist tree from TeX Live.  Where that stands in practice,
I do not know.

    i'm also curious what will happen with the miktex-unix variant if
    that one surfaces

Christian also told me that Hans Nordhaug was porting the command-line
package manager to Unix.  A Unix port of the full MiKTeX distribution is
not contemplated.

    If there is real interest, I would consider resurrecting them,

Well, if the result is binaries that can be dropped into bin/win32 (or
some new arch name, if there are updated win32 binaries from Fabrice
or anyone else), that would be great.

    We still need somebody to coordinate all the pieces that go into a
    Windows version

Indeed.

Hi,

A humble request. I'd like to see

OSFONTDIR =

.;$TEXMF/fonts/{type1,pfb}//;$TEXMF/fonts/misc/hbf//;$OSFONTDIR//
AFMFONTS      = .;$TEXMF/fonts/afm//;$OSFONTDIR//
TTFONTS       = .;$TEXMF/fonts/{truetype,ttf}//;$OSFONTDIR//
OPENTYPEFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/opentype//;$OSFONTDIR//

being added/patched in texmf.cnf

that was users can easilly hook in the os specific font path (e.g.

set osfontdir=c:/windows/fonts

on mswindows.)

I don't see a problem with the idea; Thomas, Sebastian, anyone else want

It does seem like it would need to be written differently, as in:
OSFONTDIR = ;c:/windows/fonts//
AFMFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/afm//$OSFONTDIR

(which also allows multiple directories)

With the original formulation, when OSFONTDIR was empty, the path would
look like .;$TEXMF/fonts/afm//;//

... which seems problematic, unless a special case has been inserted to
make // a no-op.  (Olaf?  I remember writing things so that if a ~
expansion ends in /, as in ~root, // is avoided, but not otherwise.)

Perhaps the name would be better as EXTRAFONTPATH or HOOKFONTPATH or
some such; I can imagine it being useful for things other than OS fonts.

i already have trees with OSFONTDIR

maybe we need both: OSFONTDIR (can be set by installers) and EXTRAFONTPATH (That 
can be set by users, e.g. when testing fonts)

There are also Aleph and even Omega users around...  Anyway, it
appears meaningless to discuss the merits of recognizing .otf as long
as we are actively distributing Omega and Aleph binaries.  Of course
we need to support what the binaries use.

Or did I miss out on any relevant information?

OTF is the future, so it won't hurt to have it already available.

Uh, I was confusing ofm and otf.  Never mind.  Too bad one can't

Hi,

one frequently encounters the situation where one has a program run
with some command

latex "\AtBeginDocument{...}other junk...\input{whatever}"

or even

latex "\AtBeginDocument{...} \input{extracted_region}"

Obviously, this does not cooperate with the -parse-first-line option.
It would be nice if one had a -first-line-file=whatever option
available to let TeX revert to the given file _before_ looking at
commands introduced with "\".

It would not be prudent to use something like
-parse-first-line=filename option itself for this: the user might
enable and disable parse-first-line in his config file, and this
setting should usually be obeyed unless overriden explicitly.  The
-first-line-file=... option would typically be passed in by TeX shells
and similar that don't necessarily pick up the users preference for
one setting or another.

Another question: I have not been able to get my TeXlive2005 into the
state where it outputs ^^8a and similar transcriptions to the
terminal, even by setting LC_CTYPE to C.  This means that I have a
harder time testing my smart recoding routines for AUCTeX, designed to
cater with those uglinesses.

Is there a reasonably easy way to get, say, an encoding that will
quote 00-09, 0b-0c, 0e-1f, 7f-9f, so that I get the original ugly

Hi All,

This is Nagendra Sharma, and am looking some good tool or converter
which can be used to convert the LaTex files in to XML.

Please I will be glad if any other process or ideas comes from any one.

you are asking on the wrong list. this list
is about the process of making the TeX Live CD,
not about using the contents.

you should investigate TeX4ht for a start (Google
will locate its home page easily); there are several
others, none of them easy to use or guarenteed to
give satisfactory results. LaTeX to XML is, inherently,
extraordinarily hard to 100% right. In my personal
view, its a Bad Idea :-}

you should use the appropriate TCX file which does not "describe" any
"unsafe" characters (or probably also not using any TCX file during
format generation will do the same effect).

    an encoding that will quote 00-09, 0b-0c, 0e-1f, 7f-9f, 

Does this work?  (I thought we already had a tcx for this in TL04, but

That makes 0a and 0d unprintable as well?  Wait...  TeX has no static
relation between character codes and line endings, right?  I tend to
forget minor things like that.  So of _course_ you want those
characters unprintable in particular.  Thanks for the reminder.

Anyway, that is a bad name because you have just 95 printable
characters after all.  It should be cp95.tcx.

Oh, you make a0 to ff unprintable as well.  But at least this is good
enough to tell me how to work this for, uh, cp191.tcx
(iso-8859-everything).

If I create a few of those files, I should have enough of an
opportunity to simulate copious amounts of broken and unfitting
locales.

Thanks, I'll try this out.

Yes.  If -parse-first-line is enabled.  Otherwise the option does
nothing.

Hi,

I just noticed something on the "texlive-demo-2003b" part of 
the texlive2004 DVD. The "latex.efmt" file is missing when
you try to run the 2003 LaTeX from the DVD. The 2004 LaTeX
works fine.

I did a work around "sorta", by doing tex -ini elatex.ini 
and renaming it and then running tex --fmt latex file.tex.

Also,

dvipdfm seems called from the texlive dvd seems to look
for fonts on the hard disk, not just on the DVD.

The DVD was not in the path so I called it like
/dvd/texlive2004/bin/i386-linux/dvipdfm file.dvi

pdflatex from the DVD works fine.

The reason this is a little bit of a problem is that
I have my older system all set up more or less the way
I want it, and I don't relish the thought of taking it
all down and reinstalling stuff. It works for the documents
I create, but there are times when I download a .tex file
from someone else that I want to create a pdf or ps file
from and I get tons of errors, because they are using a
newer system. Then I load in the DVD and try TeXLive
and it almost always works.

Also, I just noticed that my 2203 Demo CD and the install CD
which I have not used at all since I got the 3 disk set ( I used the DVD
)
has some gunk on the back of them and my cdrom drive won't
read the entire disk. I was wondering if you have any cds
left over from 2003 that you could send me.

Hi Gordon,

Sorry I didn't answer earlier.

    I just noticed something on the "texlive-demo-2003b" part of the
    texlive2004 DVD. The "latex.efmt" file is missing when you try to
    run the 2003 LaTeX from the DVD.

Puzzling.  The format files are supposed to get created on the fly.
Your workaround of creating the format files yourself is probably the
best approach.

    dvipdfm seems called from the texlive dvd seems to look
    for fonts on the hard disk, not just on the DVD.

In general, the programs will look at the cache directories on the hard
disk.  Did you run install-tl.sh and do the r(un live) setup?  You can
give different directories there, so it won't change anything in your
existing setup, and won't copy everything off the DVD.

    I don't relish the thought of taking it
    all down and reinstalling stuff. 

I understand perfectly.  You don't need to do that.  It should actually
be possible to run multiple versions side by side ... I do this myself.
They just need to be installed in separate directories.  The manual goes
into this in some detail.

    I was wondering if you have any cds left over from 2003 that you
    could send me.

Robin has been out of the office for a few days.  She should be able
take care of it when she gets back later this week.

Hope this helps,
karl

to their /etc/apt/sources.list file.

However, I lied. I should have said to add

subtle difference....

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0503240440210.15485-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

As Latin Modern were corrected and released (ver. 0.982), it is perhaps
good time to discuss how can they be used to replace Type1 versions
of CM, CS, PL and VN in real working distributions. The current LM
contains also substitution map files for such fonts.

I've made several tests of CM substitution, having in mind font map files
prepared by updmap (for dvips, pdftex and dvipdfm). Please note that
this machinery is also used in MiKTeX.

1. Fonts from AMS/BlueSky are declared altogether by bsr.map. I'd suggest
   making bsradd.map (containing only euler, lasy, linew, wn*) and 
   using cm-lm.map instead of bsr.map (in updmap.cfg).

2. As always, we have the mess with additional cm*. They are sometimes
   used from the BaKoMa collection (they should be completely removed
   from the distributions, as nowadays they only make a disaster), 
   sometimes are substituted by bsr-interplated.map. Anyway, we have some
   name clashes in bsr-interpolated.map vs. cm-lm.map

cmbxti12 CMBXTI12 <cmbxti10.pfb % long standing bug in bsr-interpolated;-))
cmbxti7 CMBXTI10  <cmbxti10.pfb
cmcsc8 CMCSC10    <cmcsc10.pfb
cmcsc9 CMCSC10    <cmcsc10.pfb
cmitt12 CMITT12   <cmitt10.pfb
cmitt9 CMITT10    <cmitt10.pfb
cmsl6 CMSL8       <cmsl8.pfb
cmsltt9 CMSLTT10  <cmsltt10.pfb
cmssbxo10 CMSSBX10 <cmssbx10.pfb

so perhaps the above part could be removed from bsr-interpolated.map.

cmex7 CMEX10 <fmex10.pfb
cmex8 CMEX10 <fmex10.pfb
cmex9 CMEX10 <fmex10.pfb

those lines should be removed from cm-lm.map, as such fonts doesn't
exist in any distribution in cm* concerning map files (extra *.pfb fonts 
belong now to the different package).

Ps. replacing CS, PL and VN would be the next step (more easy).

I don't know much about these things, but it seems that there are still
uncorrected errors in 0.982.  Florent Rougon, maintainer of lmodern in

indeed, once we have convinced the polish and czech that they should use the 
accented variants in lmr (consistency etc, as discussed at eurotex)

one thing to keep in mind is that for pdftex you need lines like

   cmr10 CMR10 <cmr10.pfb

while dvips wants:

   cmr10 "the full latin modern name" <cmr10.pfb

if pdftex map files have the full name, inclusion of files that already have cmr 
fonts embedded will be very inefficient (i had examples of hundreds of addition 
cmr subsetted fonts) because pdftex compares the internal names.

future versions of pdftex will probably be able to handle constructs like:

   cmr10 foo,bar <cmr10.pfb

so that we can add both the old and new internal name.

[context already made the switch to latin modern, and it is a bit of a struggle 
for users to get things integrated in their tree; i post lmr archives in the tds 
format for that purpose; as long as mall bugfixes take place in lmr, we need to 
make sure that tetex/fptex/gwtex use the latest versions; this can be a problem 
with official linux distributions since they are sometimes quite frozen to a 
stable version of tetex; so .. a clear version indication is important)

Indeed, but wasn't jacko going to fix that? I think that there were also some 
missing glyphs. We can expect an update pretty soon.

We know about the bugs concerning lmtt and it will be corrected soon.
Why do you refer to ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl (rather for testers) while the 
official release goes to CTAN/fonts/lm and *is* unpacked.
Don't know why 0.982 is "unfortunate version number". Should all the world
follow Debian conventions?

Hi Staszek,

days? weeks? months? I am just asking, because several people have asked
me already to release an updated teTeX, mainly because of the new lm
fonts release.

I don't particulary like to clutter the configuration with paths and
variables which *might* ease user's configuration. We could as well put
a setup.bat (and a setup.sh and setup.csh with burne shell and c-shell
syntax) with a template somewhere which has:
  set fontdir=c:/windows/fonts
  set T1FONTS=;%fontdir%//
  set OPENTYPEFONTS=;%fontdir%//
  set TTFONTS=;%fontdir%//
for people who might need it.

You mean to add SUFFIXES (".otf") to kpse_opentype_format? I don't know

The search format kpse_opentype_format is already available in kpathsea. I
thought that Sebastian asks to register the otf extension so that drivers
can ask the library to look for arial instead of arial.otf.

hm, there are already cluttering paths that we don't bother about, like

that will not work, because one needs the tex fonts as well; i don't know about 
linux but windows and mac users definitely want to use the fonts that come with 
their systems

Well, with the added suffix rule, it would be easier, but it is
already possible:

  $ kpsewhich --format='opentype fonts' LMSansQuotation8-Regular.otf
  /software/oss/Text/teTeX-3.0/share/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/LMSansQuotation8-Regular.otf

I strongly suggest a code freeze at the end of April if at all possible,

in generic scripts it's painful to take care of platform specific quoting, so i 
wonder, is it a problem to handle

kpsewhich --format=opentypefonts LMSansQuotation8-Regular.otf

as well, i.e. internally strip the spaces from the format and accept spaceless 
ones from the command line?

Hm... There are plenty of formats only available like this:

  bitmap font
  TeX system documentation
  TeX system sources
  Troff fonts
  dvips config
  type42 fonts
  web2c files
  other text files
  other binary files
  misc fonts
  opentype fonts
  pdftex config

Some of those are quite unimportant for scripts, but "web2c files"
and "other text files" are relevant to many scripts. So, the current
implementation of lots of scripts has already to take care of correct
and portable quoting.

What I want to say is: if you want to get rid of this problem, you can't
just change the "opentype fonts" format. A more general approach has to
be taken.

    A more general approach has to be taken.

Indeed.

When I devised those names originally, I did not realize that they would
be used from scripts and hence there would be quoting issues.  They were
more meant to be descriptive.

Adding spaceless "identifiers" for them all seems like a good idea to
me, so that programming can be easier in the future.

As far as type42 and opentype goes, I don't see any need for the
"<space> fonts".  After all, it's not "pk fonts", it's just "pk".  (etc.)

what i have in mind is something

compare (cmdlineformatstr,internalformatstr) ==

strip spaces from cmdlineformatstr
strip spaces from internalformatstr
cmp both stripped strings

so, in practice

other text files
other textfiles
othertext files
othertextfiles

are all the same; that way there is no need to change existing scripts, since 
the spacy variant is still supported

That is just an inconvenience for the Debian packaging, but doesn't

I don't think these are only Debian conventions.  For a starter, a Linux
Kernel version of 2.6.11 is higher than 2.6.2, while 2.6.1.1 (or
2.6.1-ac1) would be lower.  And there *is* software around with version
numbers in the three-digit-area: My less is v.382, Perl modules seem to
have such version numbers frequently (libconvert-binhex-perl: 1.119-2,
libgtk-perl: 0.7009-2).

There might be differences in what one regards as a number-separator:
Only the full stop, full stop and dash, or also other characters.  But I
think it is common that everything that is not separated by such a
separator is regarded as one number; and then 0.982 is larger than 0.99,
anyway.

Not in any world with which I am familiar.  What on earth is /wrong/
with 0.982, so long as it has normal (real) semantics, and therefore
satisfies :

	0.98 < 0.982 < 0.99

If I know that there will never be a lmodern version 0.100 (and 0.101,
0.299, 0.903, 0.993), then there is nothing wrong with it.  But this
only works for the LM fonts.  Anybody who wants to describe and
implement a scheme for version comparison that is generally applicable
to different pieces of software in a collection (like CTAN) or
distribution (like any Linux distribution), he will have to arrange for
version numbers in the three-digit range.  Of course my less version 382
must be higher than some ancient version 39, and of course
libconvert-binhex-perl version 1.119 must be higher than 1.12.  There is
no way to tell that lmodern will have 1.00 after 0.99 without knowing
about lmodern, in other words it is impossible in a generally applicable
version comparison.  And if 0.100 is higher than 0.99, then 0.982 will
be higher, too.

Hi all!

Once a question from me corncerning latex/pdflatex:

Since the last p4 sync with all the stuff Sebastian put into perforce my
pdflatex (still not the new binaries) produce pdfs where the TOP margin
is far too big.

Going through ps and ps2pdf works.

Does anyone of you have this problem, too?

There may well have /been/ versions 0.100 .. 0.903, but these
will all ne of only archival interest, since there is now
a version 0.982

Why, Frank ?  Where is it written on tablets of stone (or elsewhere)
that versions must be differentiable by the first three significant
digits.  Why can Staszek et al not propose LM-fonts V0.9821, being a
subtle improvement on V0.982, then V0.99, 0.991, 0.9911, 0.9912,
0.99121, and so on ?  If Knuth may elect to number TeX as

	V3.14159265359879663 ...

and MF likewise (for e, rather than for pi) then why may others
not follow his lead of using real numbers to differentiate versions ?

> Of course my less version 382
> must be higher than some ancient version 39, 

Yes, if "less" is numbered using positive integers

> and of course libconvert-binhex-perl version 1.119 must be higher than 1.12.  

"must" ?  I honestly fail to see any logic in this last statement at
all.  /Why/ "must" libconvert-binhex-perl version 1.119 be higher than 1.12 ?
It would certainly not appear to be so, if by "higher" you imply "more recent".

> There is no way to tell that lmodern will have 1.00 after 0.99 without knowing
> about lmodern, 

Yes, I agree : unless one knows how packages are numbered, one has
no way of differentiating between earlier and later versions based
solely on their name.  But we /do/ know about the numbering scheme
for LM Modern, and therefore there is no problem.  There /does/
seem to be a problem for "libconvert-binhex-perl", if version 1.119
is really "higher" (more recent) than 1.12, but that would appear
to be a problem for the author(s)/creator(s)/maintainer(s) of
"libconvert-binhex-perl" rather than for Staszek et al.

Not sure what this statement means ...

and if the Holy Father were a Protestant, then the entire Vatican
staff would be out of a job!  But he isn't, any more than
0.100 is higher than 0.99, so what are we to gain by discussing
counter-factuals ?

The point is simply one of convention.  It's impossible for software
authors to guess how many subversions they will need so rather than having
to pad the first version 0.00000001, they say 0.10 > 0.1 because 10 > 1.
Subsubversions are done with an extra full stop.  This full stop is not a
floating point, it's just a delimiter.

As an example of this, the man page of the unix ls command says:

       -v     sort by version 

this implements the above scheme:

  gavin@ravioli gavin> touch v0.99 v0.982
  gavin@ravioli gavin> ls -lv v0*
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 gavin gavin 0 2005-03-29 17:22 v0.99
  -rw-rw-rw-  1 gavin gavin 0 2005-03-29 17:22 v0.982

implying 0.99 < 0.982.  While of course everyone is in a position to break
conventions, it is not generally a good idea.

Knuth's numbering scheme is consistent with the above.  He just skips an
awful lot of possible version numbers.  Even LaTeX does this with its
sectioning commands.

/Some/ software authors may say; others may say that if 0.1 has
been released, then there will never be a V0.10 (although
there may well be a V0.11).  These same authors would
happily accept that that 0.2 > 0.1 /and/ 0.2 > 0.11

Yes, I have no problem with that : V0.1.1 > V0.1
However, would you assert that V0.1.0 > V0.1 ?
If so, on what basis ?

However, Staszek is not using such a scheme, it would
appear to me : he is using a simple real number,
expressed to whatever number of digits seems to him
and his co-autho0rs to best reflect the degree of
difference from any preceding version.

Is perhaps even predicated on it.  However, what the Unix "ls"
command does is neither here nor there : it may be of interest
to Unix users, and it may well be beneficial for Unix users
to number their packages in accordance with a scheme with which
"ls" can cope, but that is surely of no concern to people such
as Staszek et al, implementing /portable/ software which need

In the Unix world.  Nowhere else, as far as I know, and
certainly not according to the generally accepted
principles of real arithmetic.

But as you yourself point out, this is a Unix convention.
Staszek is not, as far as I can tell, offering anything
that is Unix-specific.

Yes, with embedded period : as I said above, I have no problem with
such a numbering scheme.

I daresay that may.  That doesn't change the convention.  This mailing list
speaks English.  If we didn't obey that convention things might get a
little difficult.

I think it would be unlikely that both would exist.  However I would assert
that V0.11.0 > V0.1 and V0.11.0 > V0.1.1 > V0.1.0

The point of the . as delimiter is that each number is not a real but an
integer.

No, he's using an integer delimited with dots.  You'll see this same
behaviour in the sectioning commands in LaTeX.

Human beings do not count:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,991,992

this is platform agnostic.

Consult The LaTeX Comanion Section 11.10 which comes after 11.9.  Try

	section numbering in MS Word, LaTeX, OpenOffice
	version numbering in CVS, SVN, 
	IP Addresses,

No I pointed out that it was a software convention and gave an example in
unix.  I don't think dir in Win32 has such a rich syntax and Microsoft
certainly don't tend to number things consistently, they do it for
marketing.

His numbering scheme is consistent with both scenarios.  That doesn't make
either of the above wrong.

True if there are two or more periods; uncertain/ambiguous

No, but they /do/ count (omitting an infinite
number of steps)

   0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,0.91,0.92,0.93,0.94,0.95,0.96,0.97,0.98,0.99,0.991,0.992

No, with :-)  LaTeX will happily generate 0.1.1, 0.1.2 and so on,
at the right level of (sub-)sectioning.

The real point (and this is only just becoming clear to me)
is that 0.982 /is/ ambiguous : it could be a real, it could
be a period-delimted pair of integers.  My initial
interpretation (on which all previous argument was based)
is that Staszek et al were treating it as real.  If they
are treating it as period-delimited integers, let them
say so now :-)

What exactly have you ever seen counted like this?  People do not count in
real numbers.  They count in integers.

As long as each level has only one digit the entire point is moot.  Given
that this is the TeX Live list it seems the best thing to do is point you
to The TeX Book to see what Knuth does.  Picking an example at random,
chapter 14's exercises are numbered:

14.1, 14.2, ......., 14.9, 14.10, 14.11. etc

If you feel this is ambiguous perhaps you should file a bug and see what
response you get.

The convention in versioning is that it is the latter.  1.10 is the tenth
subversion of version one.  It does not mean we are one tenth of the way to
version two.

Everywhere, as soon as you start seeing the "." as a separator instead
of a floating point sign.  And a separator it must be, because a "real
number" 1.12.6 cannot exist, while such version numbers are common.  Or
version numbers like 1.7b (larger than 1.7 and 1.7a, but smaller than
1.7c and 1.8).  Currently, my JabRef installation has this version
number, and this is _not_ a Unix program, it's written in Java and works
well under Windows.

It doesn't matter much what they say or do:  By convention, software
versions use integers (and even letters), not real numbers.  Therefore
version comparison, except when taylored to one specific piece of
software, expects versions according to that convention, and any
software that tries to go with real numbers causes problems.  

It's not impossible to handle them, but it would be much more convenient
if lmodern would follow the convention.

/Who's/ convention ?  If Staszek et all want to use a real-number
based numbering convention, then that is their right, as package
authors.  If other software has problems as a result, then that
software is probably considerably less flexible than it need to be.

It seems to me (and now we're getting /really/ off-topic)
that what we are seeing here is exactly the same type of
coercive pressure as is used to "persuade" package authors to
include some quasi-legal "Free software" licence in any package
for which they are responsible.  I for one resent that pressure,
and I similarly resent these attempts to enforce a particular
versioning scheme on the authors of what is potentially a very
significant package.

The scare quotes, and the phrase quasi-legal are really unnecessarily
aggressive. Software licences are software licences, and are
legal documents, irrespective of whether you have paid for the software.

> I for one resent that pressure

The pressure that has been applied has been to ask authors
to put their software on a proper legal basis. By default,
without a licence, people cannot use or distribute any code you write.
Really. However much you may dislike this, its the legal framework
we operate it.

Frank merely remarked that the versioning scheme was unusual,
and wondered if it could be changed. Staszek can call the package
whatever he likes, and Debian folks like Frank can work around it.
However, the more work involved in packaging up something for
distribution in Debian carries the increasing likelihood that no-one
wil bother. Similarly, I tend to leave aside packages that might
get into the TeX Live texmf* trees if they have complex installations or
strange names. I don't _reject_ them, I simply put them on one side 
until I have leisure,
which I seldom have. I imagine Frank and other Debian-like folks
would make similar judgements.

You point out that the situation is ambiguous.  Frank points out the
convention which completely clears up the ambiguity and you suggest that
anyone who uses that convention is not being flexible enough.  I think you
need to make up your mind.

Of course it is their right.  Which is why I said

I doubt that it would be possible to write such a flexible software.  It
would somehow have to be instructed to use the usual integer/char
convention for software A, but the real number convention for software
B.  This only works for a predefined number of software packages; it
would be doable for a linux distribution (as long as everybody creating
rpms/debs is aware of the problem), but, for example, hardly for a
script for keeping a CTAN copy up-to-date, because there is a quasi
unlimited number of packages there, with unknown versioning scheme.

Or rather it is not, because I have never found any software
deliberately using a real number scheme.  Perhaps the lmodern authors
intended to do so; I don't think it would be a good idea (which is why
we are sending copies of this thread to Stazek).

There is certainly such pressure if you care for the group that asks for
the license, or for the versioning scheme.  If you don't, there's no
pressure, and the software might still be useful or not.  

The pressure for the version number, however, is of course much less
than the pressure for a license: If I don't like the version numbering
of a package on CTAN, I can simply invent my own one for distributing
purposes (using the release date, for example, which gives a reliable,
unambiguous version number - maybe adding upstreams version number after
it for reference).  If a package doesn't have a license (or a non-free
one), it simply cannot be included in the commercially distributed CTAN
derivatives, like TeX-live, Debian, or whatever. (I do *not* want to
discuss here what exactly "a non-free one" might mean).

The rest of the world?

Can one name any software package outside of the TeX world that uses
real numbers as version ids? I can't, sorry.
Can one name software packages that use ``integers (and even
letters) with separaters''? Yes, every software package that I ever
used that had a version identification, be it on VMS, Windows, MVS, or
Unix.

You're barking up the wrong tree, and this seems more like a political
crusade against `those persuaders' than a rationale discourse of
version numbering. This thread started with the assertion that
lmfont's numbering scheme is _inconvenient_. It was asked why, and a
rationale answer was given. There was never the question what Staszek
has the right to do or not. -- I'm not a native English speaker; but I
would have hoped that you, as a native English speaker, know the
meaning of `inconvenient'. It's not to demand a change, it's about
asking for a change to be able to integrate lmfonts better with common
tools, in particular, with package management tools.

It's a pitty that one has to explicate that meaning of a common
English phrase to such a prominent member of the TeX community as you
are. C'mon, Phil, you can do better; why do you let yourself carried
away with such a topic? For my person, I would prefer to see us
developers be forthcoming to our downstream packagers, they are
important for the survival of TeX. (For the record: I know Staszek for
some time now; and he has always been forthcoming and respectful for
wishes of others if these were rationale. This is not a remark on his
actions or the version number, this is a remark on this mail thread.)

Best wishes,

	Joachim

The XEmacs package system actually uses real numbers to compare
versions.  And the XEmacs maintainers readily admit that this probably
was quite a mistake and should get replaced by something saner in a
future version...

Hmm, sorry for the noise. THis was the point (changing class from llncs
to article without adding a4paper).

But why did the printout from pdflatex->acroread really produced bad
output, while the latex->dvips->ps2pdf not? (Maybe because dvips/ps2pdf
assume a4)

Again, sorry for the noise and all the best.

Message-ID: <424A6E1E.9020803@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

This whole discussiom has become considerably more
heated than seems appropriate for this list, so
I would like to start by apologising to anyone
who feels that I have been over-confrontational :
I kicked in in defense of Staszek's original
thetorical statememt and question ("Don't know
why 0.982 is [an] "unfortunate version number".
Should all the world follow Debian conventions?")
and since then things have rather gor out of hand.

However, it does seems to me that the discussion has
raised one very real issue : in version numbers
with a single period separator, is the second
element intended to be a real or an integer ?
Clearly most believe the latter, but I remain
unconvinced that this is universally accepted.

If we look at the evolution of TeX82 prior to
V3, we see that Knuth adopted the following
version numbers :

	0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9,
	0.91, 0.92, 0.93, 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99,
	0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999, 0.999999,
	1.0 (I stop at this point)

Now, /if/ Knuth believed that the second element was an
integer, why did he not use V0.10 after V0.9, then V0.11
and so on ?

I argue that his numbering unequivocally indicates that
he was treating version numbers as reals : the use
of an increasing number of significant digits,
as in 0.99, 0.999, ...0.999999 is clearly intended
to indicate the closeness of the release to the
(future) announcement of a putative V1.0 (which
eventually we see).  In order to indicate this
closeness, Knuth (and anyone else who wants to
use the version number to convey more than
simple rank--ordering) is /forced/ to treat the
version number as a real, since (of reals and
integers) only reals are capable of indicating
asymptoticity : 0.999999 is clearly "very close"
to 1.0 only if it is perceived as a real; if it is
perceived as an integer, then it is no closer to
1.0 than is (say) 0.1000001, 0,123456789,
0.111112222233333444445555566666777778888899999
or any other increasingly long string of digits.
Indeed, the very concept of being "close to"
1.0 is meaningless if the "1" and the "0" of "1.0"
are treated as orthogonal dimensions rather
than a single-dimensional real.

At this point I stop and rest my case : I hope
that those who felt that I was either playing
devil's advocate or playing politics will now
accept that I was actually trying to raise a
genuine point of semanhtic interpretation, and
that we can restore TeX-Implementors to its
previous state of calm and equanimity.

Did you notice that the version numbers Knuth chose are unambiguous in
both schemes, that is when you treat them as real numbers as well as
when you treat them as integers?  One could speculate that he tried to
convey the concept of asymptoticity (?) to the human reader, while still
following the machine-readable convention of integer version numbers.

Yes, I'm very happy to accept that point.  Indeed, if we could
reach agreement that version numbers should retain the same rank-order
when (a) sorted as reals, and (b) sorted as ordered pairs of integers,
I would be positively ecstatic :-)   As far as I can tell, Staszek
et al were adopting that convention (tacitly) whilst "libconvert-binhex-perl"
appears to violate it, if "version 1.119 must be higher than 1.12" as
previously asserted.

The thing to note is that he has been smart enough not to commit
himself either way.  His versioning system does not meet the
"unfortunate" criterion.  His version numbers sort as integer fields,
lexicographically, and as real numbers.

He'll have to blow his cover after releasing

3.1415926535897932384626433832795

Will then the next version be

3.14159265358979323846264338327950

(in which case the "real" version number idea will be disproven) or

3.141592653589793238462643383279502?

And I argue that Knuth is definitely one of the least relevant
authorities with regard to software engineering and particularly
version numbers in cooperative environments, anyway, so I wonder why
you would bring him up here.  I certainly would not want to suggest
that we should, say, put LM into a versioning system 1.6, 1.61, 1.618,
1.61803...

A very good point : I wonder if we can persuade him to stop work
on TAOCP for long enough to resolve this vital question ?

hm, since it's latin roman what we're talking about i was just about to propose

Real (number) semantics is your own assumption, and one that
is less popular.  Not to say that it is never used.

I bet that after a few more versions Don will switch to a numbering 
scheme like:

\pi-10^{-6}, \pi-10^{-7}, \pi-10^{-8}, etc.

which has the advantage that the number of characters needed for every 
new
version increases logarithmically and not linearly as with 3.14, 3.141, 
3.1415, 3.14159, ...

How old is the pdftex you use? Does it still use some pdftex.cfg
lying around somewhere?

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 2004 distribution
Message-ID: <424AF667.8030900@udel.edu>


We have come across a problem with the most recent distribution of TeX 
Live on Solaris.  It appears that the utility programs such as texinfo, 
etc. have been compiled without the -R option or I am guessing in 
previous distribution this was statically bound rather than dynamic. As 
a result it won't work just installed as is.  Minimally you need to set 
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the specific version of the library for gcc and 
you can't even point to a newer version if you have that installed 
rather than the older version it appears to require.  Can someone please 
provide specific documentation on how it is intended to work?  I know 
that we can probably work around this by making symbolic links and/or 
having users set their LD_LIBRARY_PATH if they have and know the correct 
version.

Thanks.

Hi Anita,

    etc. have been compiled without the -R option or I am guessing in 
    previous distribution this was statically bound rather than dynamic. As 

Ugh.  Very sorry to hear about these problems.  We did many, many
iterations on the binaries to try to minimize this stuff.

Let me mention that the binaries on the CD also triggered (as usual) a
compiler bug.  You can get new binaries, for Solaris 2.8, from
http://tug.org/texlive/tl2004-sparc-solaris.tgz

I don't know if their behavior will be different than the ones on the
CD, but it might be worth a try.

    you can't even point to a newer version if you have that installed 
    rather than the older version it appears to require.  

Are we talking about libgcc_s?  I thought we statically linked that.
Guess we ended up not doing so, how unfortunate (I sure wish the gcc
people had never invented that library).  In any case, unless the major
version is different (highly doubtful), a newer lib should certainly
work.  Very weird.  I know we did not do anything particularly special
to try to require very particular versions of anything.

    provide specific documentation on how it is intended to work?  

Sadly, there is no "specific documentation" at hand because the
intention was that it would "just work".  Sigh.  How frustrating.

It will take me some time to investigate all the details.  Perhaps
Maksym (who made the binaries on the CD with gcc 3.3.3, as I recall) or
Vladimir (who made the new ones, with a slightly newer gcc, as I recall)
or someone else can look at it as well.

Sorry for the trouble.

No. But it seems that the dvips uses automatically A4, the two different
pdfs (one via pdflatex, one via dvips-ps2pdf) also contain different
page formats:
pdflatex-version:
	216x280mm
latex-dvips-ps2pdf-version:
	210x297mm (A4)

Interestingly the top margin of the pdflatex version when printed was
*huge*, much too big.

Anyway, it was my stupid error, let's forget about it.
