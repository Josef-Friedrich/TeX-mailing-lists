But I've seen that Gow provides the program "ln".  I'm wondering what it
does.  Does ln -s create a .lnk file?  This is what Cygwin does and
symlinks work like on Unix there.

First, it wasn?t possible to delete the link. But i could solve it.

My system is WIN XP 5.1.2600 (home), AFAIK with all SPs.

Another try

ln -s -S=exe pdftex.exe pdflatex

this results to pdflatex.lnk

All the links in the explorer are shown without the suffix .lnk  

Here is the result of ln --help

Usage: ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME   (1st form)
  or:  ln [OPTION]... TARGET                  (2nd form)
  or:  ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY     (3rd form)
  or:  ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...  (4th form)
In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.
In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.
Create hard links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.
When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
      --backup[=CONTROL]      make a backup of each existing destination

  -b                          like --backup but does not accept an

  -d, -F, --directory         allow the superuser to attempt to hard link
                                directories (note: will probably fail due
to
                                system restrictions, even for the
superuser)
  -f, --force                 remove existing destination files
  -n, --no-dereference        treat destination that is a symlink to a

  -s, --symbolic              make symbolic links instead of hard links
  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX         override the usual backup suffix
  -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY  specify the DIRECTORY in which to
create
                                the links
  -T, --no-target-directory   treat LINK_NAME as a normal file
  -v, --verbose               print name of each file before linking
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The backup suffix is `~', unless set with --suffix or
SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or
through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

Hi Marco, 
first of all, if you ask on this mailing list, there is no need to
attach files to your mails which are already in TeX Live.  And
regarding fncychapleo.sty, a link to the web site would be sufficient
and more useful.

This list isn't the correct place to ask such questions.  Please note
that TeX Live can only provide what's on CTAN.  And packages on CTAN
can only fixed by their authors.

The best thing you can do is to provide a tiny LaTeX file which
demonstrates the problem and ask on the *texhax mailing list* again.
Your statement "It does not work with the rest of the latex system"
is too vague.  Does it clash with LaTeX itself or with a particular
macro package?  And with which package?  More information is needeed.

As far as I understand fncychapleo.sty is an extension of an older
version of fncychap.sty.  If there is an error in fncychap.sty the
author has to fix it.  And if you want to have fncychapleo.sty in TeX
Live, ask the author to put it on CTAN.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello,

I tried to generate a texlive tree on a portable USB-connectable hard disk on a Linux system. At first sight everything seems to be relocatable, but when I mounted my portable disk on Windows under cygwin xetex did not find any truetype or opentype directories. I "grepped" all files in the texmf trees, and found one file, texmf-var/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf,
which has explicit absolute filenames to list the font directories. Its contents is shown below.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
  <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
  <fontconfig>
  <dir>/media/usbdisk/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
<dir>/media/usbdisk/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>
<dir>/media/usbdisk/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/type1</dir>
</fontconfig>rectories 

This prefix /media/usbdisk is the one the system assigns on my Linux fedora-based OS. On windows, the disk is mounted on the  E: disk (or /cygdrive/e/). I wonder, why in the texlive-fontconfig.conf file the directory names are not relative to the root of the texlive setup (texlive/2010 in this case?) as are all the other files that contain file lists (e.g., ls-R). 

When I mount my portable disk on my windows PC, open a cygwin command shell adding /cygdrive/e/texlive/2010/bin/win32 to the PATH (the same behaviour happens in a "cmd" command prompt window) and then try and execute xe(la)tex, it does not seem to find any of the truetype and Opentype fonts that are found on the same disk on Linux. Do I have to "prepare" my windows setup running tl-portable.bat as explained on the install-tl page the first time I try and use the new texlive on every Windows machine? I n fact, when I run tl-portable, I get the following:
 
$ /cygdrive/e/texlive/2010/tl-portable
Testing whether /cygdrive/e/texlive/2010 is writable...
/cygdrive/e/texlive/2010 is writable.
Using /cygdrive/e/texlive/2010 for generated files.

Thanks for your help, mg

May be ecause fontconfig does not handle relative paths (it is system\
library not bound to TeX).

This file is not used directly by any texlive program.  It is created by 
the installer and is intended to be copied to a suitable location (and 
edited as necessary).  See Section 3.4.5 of the texlive 2010 manual, 
which should be at

/media/usbdisk/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/texlive/texlive-en/texlive-en.html

on your system.  This is for Unix-compatible systems.  I'm not sure what 
you should do under Windows; the texlive installer usually takes care of 
that for you, I think.  On the other hand, you could install the Cygwin 
texlive binaries and then follow the instructions for Unix-compatible 
systems.

Hi Robert,
thank you very much for testing.  The information you provided is
very useful.  I fear that .exe.lnk files are useless if .exe files
are found first even if they appear later in PATH.  I tend to assume
that this problem isn't solvable.

Ok, Gow's ls obviously doesn't circumvent the M$ extension craziness.
Cygwin obviously does.

I would expect a relative link here.  Either Microsoft doesn't support
relative paths in .lnk files or it's a bug in Gow's ln command.  

Absolute paths are not acceptable because they make TeX Live
non-relocatable, which is very painful if you install it on a
USB~stick which is assigned to different "drive letters" on different
machines.

I suppose that "pdflatex --version" works if there's no other TeX
distribution in PATH.

I fear that it doesn't matter whether it's .exe.lnk or .lnk because
it's very likely that Windows looks for .exe files first in all PATH
components.

A clear specification of the .lnk file format and the search strategy
would be very helpful but I didn't find anything in the internet.
What I've found is what someone else reverse engineered:

  http://www.stdlib.com/art6-Shortcut-File-Format-lnk.html

It seems that relative links are possible.  But the main problem is
the search order of executable files in PATH.

At a first glance it looked quite promising.  Symlinks really make
life easier.  They are much more user-friendly than the stubs we
currently have but I fear that we have to live with them in the future.

Robert, thank you very much.  I'm glad that *you* tested it because
you have more than one TeX installation on your machine and thus
detected a problem which we hadn't noticed otherwise.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello!

While trying to understand a problem with PS Tricks and XeTeX I also  
used an elder file with the statement

	\rput(2,3){\fontsize{0.5in}{0.7in}\fontfamily{ptm}\selectfont X}

When I hard link the XDV file as file.xdv.dvi I can use disdvi and see  
that an OT1 encoded font variant gets used:

Hi Peter,

> 	fontmap: ptmr8r -> ptmr8r(8r.enc)
It should be
        fontmap: ptmr8r -> Times-Roman(8r)

where Times-Roman is not embedded by default because
it is one of base 14 fonts. There may be a problem in your
map file. The corresponding entry should be

ptmr8r    8r    Times-Roman

Best,
Akira

I've checked the setting in TL2010. The dvipdfmx.cfg in TL2010
uses pdftex.map instead of dvipdfm.map, because the new
dvipdfmx and xdvipdfmx can read map files of dvips format.
The entry in the default pdftex.map is

ptmr8r NimbusRomNo9L-Regu "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <utmr8a.pfb

Therefore the above message must be
          fontmap: ptmr8r -> utmr8a(8r.enc)
and the type1 font utmr8a.pfb must be embedded.

Best regards,
Akira

Please stay on list (again!!!), don't you have a group reply key?

I found more disturbing pieces in your installation:

Once you said:
> fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
> /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def failed
> (status 1), output:
> fmtutil: no format depends on hyphen file
> `/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def'.

That suggests that you have installed into /usr/local/texlive/2009, right?

Later on you said
> This is the output I got when I typed the
> kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf command in a terminal.
> **********************
> /opt/texlive/2009/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
> ************************

Which hints at /opt/texlive/2009/...

Then again, which fmtutil is
> The output is
> /usr/bin/fmtutil
> I have created links to this directory.

Links from where to where?

Can you please either give a clear explanation
- how you did install
- where you did install
- what links you set up
- and anything else that might be interesing!!!

So next step, please run the following as root, and send me the terminal
output as well as the fmtutil.log file, thanks.
	tlmgr conf
	which tlmgr
	ls -l `which tlmgr`
	which fmtutil
	ls -l `which fmtutil`
	ls -l /opt/texlive/20009
	ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2009
	ls -l ~/.texlive2009/
	echo $TEXMFVAR
	echo $TEXMFCONFIG
	v=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR`
	c=`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSCONFIG`
	TEXMFVAR="$v"
	TEXMFCONFIG="$c"
	export TEXMFVAR TEXMFCONFIG
	f=`kpsewhich language.def`
	echo "$f"
	bash -x /usr/bin/fmtutil --byhyphen "$f"

Please before doing all this kind of messing around learn the basics
of Unix user management, at least the simple things like read/write permissions!

I tried it by renaming the other pdflatex.exe, it doesn?t work without the

Subject: [tex-live] GUIs crash on latex-error
Message-ID: <20100804064817.186120@gmx.net>

Hi,
I have tried to compile a .tex file using pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009/Debian) on my kubuntu 10.04.
Manually, executing "latex", everything works.
When I use a GUI like Kile or texmaker, it works, if there are no errors in the tex-file.
If there is an error, the "latex" program hangs forever and Kile or texmaker hang then as well which is so annoying.
I rule out the possibility that it is a Kile oder texmaker problem, since both hang, so no more information on versions and so on for those is necessary.
The weird thing is, that manually executing the latex-command on the .tex file including an error works as well - it just complains that e.g. the graphics-file is not found or so.
The tex-file is okay, since on an older machine, which uses an older version of latex and kile, everything is fine as well.
Ah, I forgot - the log in Kile tells me the error, e.g. missing graphics file - and then it hangs and cannot recover.
Also, this only happens with a certain *.cls file - which I have to use and must not change.
I assume I am making some ugly non-latex rooky mistake I just don't see right now... Googling the whole day did not show up any solution.
Thanks for any ideas.

Tillmann

So then it is not a bug of latex or so ...

> PS: this happens with any of the example files in here (if I unwillingly add a mistake, e.g. forget a graphics file): http://www.jfm.damtp.cam.ac.uk/jfmstyle.zip

The bug is in jfm.cls ... it defines \checkfont with
	\batchmode
in it.

The problem is that GUIs use
	latex -interaction=nonstopmode
but jfm.cls \checkfont does reset that to \batchmode without saving
and restoring the original mode.

Remove the calls to \checkfont in your documents and it will work.

And complain to the writers of jfm.cls, it is their fault.

Best wishes

I have two computers, one of them a laptop and another desktop.
In my  laptop, I have installed texlive in /opt/texlive.  In my desktop I
have installed
texlive in /usr/local/texlive.

In the case of laptop, I couldn't update my texlive using my University
internet connection. However, I could update the texlive on laptop
using my home connection.  In the case of desktop I could update it from my
University connection. In both the cases, after updating, the tlmgr gave an
error code of 1, meaning unsuccesful with the error message.

Since I got the same error message from both my laptop and desktop, I am
running
all the commands you mentioned in the command line of
my laptop and sending you the output.
The output I am sending is from my laptop where I have installed texlive in
/opt/texlive and
I have created symbolic links to /usr/bin. I installed installed
texlive2009 dvd  by the command
running tl-install as root from the terminal.

Here is the output form tlmgr conf

You have 
	/opt/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/config/language.def
that is not a good idea ....

What else is hidden there in texmf-local that does override the
system files???

> No more posts from me. I will manage on my own somehow. I feel like russian

Well, you are not, you are just putting files into TEXMFLOCAL that
override system files, and expect then that everything works.

I would suggest to rename /opt/texlive/texmf-local to SAVED.texmf-local,
create a new /opt/texlive/texmf-local (empty) and see if all runs then
(what I expect).

Then move only those packages and style files over, NOT files like language.def
or similar!

Sometimes it is not desirable to use \batchmode or \nonstopmode and
the hang problem can appear not only in GUI's but also when run as a
server application. In such a case I run latex through my Expect
script. Developing such a script in Expect is easier than using other
languages. The script is attached.

Yes.

I would call as *ROOT*
	fmtutil-sys --all
just to be sure.

Many thanks for taking the time to  sort out this problem while
I was out enjoying some (rare for this area) nice weather.  In
the future I hope I can remember to suggest that the user temporarily
move texmf-local to see if the problem goes away.

I am trying to upgrade my TeXLive 2010 distribution with tlmgr, but ever since it was "frozen" I haven't been able to use the pretest repositories, nor the regular ones (they are still geared for 2009). Are there any repostiories I could use to upgrade TeXLive 2010, or must I wait till work start on the next distribution?

Thanks a lot everybody,

Hou have to wait.  There are no updates available even in the svn
repository.

What do you mean by "haven't been able to use", and is there a
specific update you need to install?   Since the
freeze I get (on a linux system):

$ tlmgr update --list
tlmgr: package repository http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//texlive/tlpretest
tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/backups
tlmgr: no updates available

Thank you all for your help. My distribution is up to date with the "frozen" TeXLive 2010, it's just that I hadn't realized that TeXLive updates were frozen pending the 2010 release.

Thanks again,

Subject: [tex-live] removing belleek from TeXLive
Message-ID: <A457AE0EC669934B985DC973A9B1B16D040E6C7F@EVS3.aecl.ca>

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

While installing the mathtime fonts, it came to my attention that pdfLaTeX gets confused
And ends up not using the mathtime fonts for certain things.

The source of the confusion is the belleek fonts.
Belleek interferes with mathtime and needs to be removed.
The easiest way I came up with for doing this is to simply delete
the belleek.map file from the installation and then regenerate all
of the map files.  Since belleek.map is no longer there, these
entries will no longer propagate to the map files used by
all of the applications.

Somehow this method seemed a little "abrupt".
I would have preferred a more generalized method, so I tried uninstalling the
belleek package from the TeXLive Windows Manager (GUI).
At first it didn't want to uninstall it because belleek is needed by other packages.
I was still using the "older" TeXLive manager, and it has a checkbox to "force" the uninstall,
And using this seemed to work, although there were some strange error messages that said
I has not uninstalled belleek.  But the belleek entry in the updmap.cfg now had a #! In front
of it, and when I checked the appropriate map files, they also no longer had the belleek font entries in them.

Was this the appropriate way of removing belleek?
Does the "force" do what I think it does (remove anyway, in spite of dependencies)?

In any case, let's continue the story.
Knowing that the manager has an update< I decided to try it on for size.
When I attached to the internet repository, the manager dutifully informed me that an update
for the texlive manager was available and it could not do anything until I updated it.
So I said yes, and the update promptly failed and I had to do it manually.
Not too impressive.

Then I started up the new update manager and tried to uninstall belleek.
I was told that belleek cannot be uninstalled because it is needed by collection-fontsextra,
and for the life of me I could not find a "force" option anywhere (did I miss something?)
Alright then, what about uninstalling collection-fontsextra?
No can do, because the collection-fontsextra dependent on scheme-full and scheme-gutenberg...

So what to do?

And another thing.
The manager action depend on the repository being present.
This could end up being a major pain for anyone using a laptop (not me, but now the majority of
just about everyone... First year students: 90+%) because they would have to run around
with a copy of the DVD at all times...

Right now I'm uninstalling TeXLive completely, loading up the entire repository on hard disk,
And reinstalling from there just for fun... :-)
Last time I tried it this way on another machine, it took only 20 minutes instead of 1-2 hours from dvd.

Comments welcome!

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

As hinted in my previous mail message, I tried uninstalling TeXLive installation from 
a Windows XP X64 machine (which is really a re-branded server 2003), and I must say
I'm somewhat less than pleased.  The uninstaller refused to removed all executable files
(basically all .bat, .exe, .dll, and .cmd files and their associated directory trees).
So I'm left with 817 files that were not uninstalled, and to boot the TeXLive 2009
Entry in Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs is still in there, and I can't even remove
the package entry using the windows install cleanup utility program because the install
was never made using Windows Installer in the first place.  The desktop entries are
all still there, along with the Start -> programs entry for TeXLive.

My first impulse would be to delete the remaining files and desktop entries, and remove the install entry directly
in the registry through regedit.  Is that advisable?  Editing the registry directly always
faintly gives me the creeps.  The possibility of REALLY mucking up the system is always there.

This is just too ugly.
Has anyone else had this type of experience or am I just "special" somehow?

updmap-sys --disable belleek.map

Indeed, but what would be the point of the windows GUI then?
Personally, I am not averse to the command line.
In fact, I prefer it because of the possibility of automating/batching things.
But, if I may play devil's advocate for a minute, what is the point of a GUI
if it doesn't do the job it sets out to do?
What would the average windows user do?
As stunted as it is, very few average windows users know about the command line...

Thanks for the reply though!
I appreciate it.

Well known, I have the same circumstances, and don't see a problem.

Which strange error message? Unless you can provide them I cannot help.

So that is fine.

Reading the documentation of tlmgr - maybe????

There you could have found under the "generate" action:
       For "updmap", however, "tlmgr" does not use "generate", because the
       result would be to disable all maps which have been manually installed
       via "updmap-sys --enable", e.g., for proprietary or local fonts.  The
       "generate" action only incorporates the changes in the "--localcfg"
       file mentioned below.  Furthermore, "tlmgr" updates and maintains the
       final "updmap.cfg" in "TEXMFSYSCONFIG" (while the other files are in
       "TEXMFSYSVAR"), because that is the location that "updmap-sys" (via
       "tcfmgr") uses.

       Notwithstanding the above, if you only use the fonts and font packages
       within TeX Live, and maintain your local fonts (if any) using
       "updmap-local.cfg", there is nothing wrong with using "generate
       updmap".  Indeed, we use it ourselves to generate the "updmap.cfg" file
       in the live source repository.
and further down
        #!NAME
         %!NAME
         --!NAME

       where "fmtutil.cnf" and "updmap.cfg" use "#", "language.dat" and
       "language.def" use "%", and "language.dat.lua" use "--".  In any case,
       the name is the respective format name, map file name (include the
       ".map" extension), or hyphenation pattern identifier.  Examples:

         #!pdflatex
         #!lm.map
         %!german
         --!usenglishmax

So by simply putting
	#!belleek.map
and calling tlmgr generate updmap you would have been settled.


Another option, as hinted in the above quoted man page, and about 
as easy to find on the internet is the already mentioned
	updmap-sys --disable belleek.map
which would have been the same effect.

So you are complaining about one of the most asked questions, a simple
google would have given you loads of answers to this.

We *on*purpose* tweaked tlmgr so that the recommendations all over the
internet (namely using updmap-sys --enable/disable) will still work
with our new system, so please use it.

> Does the "force" do what I think it does (remove anyway, in spite of dependencies)?

Yes, as specified in the documentation of tlmgr, available in the
following places: tlmgr help, weg page on tug.org, and probably some others.

??? What do you mean with
	"...promptly failed and I had to do it manually."
I am 100% sure that you do NOT know how to upgrade tlmgr by hand, i.e.
getting the right packages, un-xz-ing them, untar-ing them in the right
place, including the new .tlps into the texlive.tlpdb, ...

So what onearth do you think is "manually"?

Or wait ... are you complaining that you had to type
	tlmgr update --self
on the command line? THen it might be a bug in the GUI, which can happen,
it is a *front*end* to tlmgr...

> Then I started up the new update manager and tried to uninstall belleek.

You already had belleek fonts disabled??? What else do you want?

> I was told that belleek cannot be uninstalled because it is needed by collection-fontsextra,

Yes, that is true. And on purpose.

> and for the life of me I could not find a "force" option anywhere (did I miss something?)

No, it is not present in the GUI anymore. If you feel so comfortable
with messing around in the internals and overriding decisions in
packaging we made, then you have to use the command line. 

> Alright then, what about uninstalling collection-fontsextra?
> No can do, because the collection-fontsextra dependent on scheme-full and scheme-gutenberg...
> 
> So what to do?

Why not simply keep it as it is?????

Do you have any problems now?

> And another thing.
> The manager action depend on the repository being present.

Rubbish. It loads the remote repository *only* for those actions
needed.

Of course if you ask it to update packages the remote repository has
to be present.

You are sooooo unspecific, can you please try to write meaningful
complains:
	"The manager actiondepend on the repository being present"
*WHICH* action:
	tlmgr search 		(without --global)  doe snot neeed
	tlmgr list 		does not need
	tlmgr remove 		does not need
	tlmgr backup 		does not need
	tlmgr install		needs
	tlmgr update		needs
etc etc.

But hell, how should tlmgr know what to update without having a connection?

Have you tried updating your Windows or Linux Desktop without internet
connection? Did it work --- I would be impressed!

Ahh, you mean the DVD, so what about, as mentined on TOP of the documentation
in example invocation:
	tlmgr option repository some/other/repository
???? 

Arrggghhh, I sometimes ask myself why people are not able to READ, andwhy
I invest time in writing these documentation if you not even care for looking
into the first lines?
tlmgr help (or web page) mentions on the top:
EXAMPLES
....
       "tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet"
           Tell "tlmgr" to use a nearby CTAN mirror for future updates; useful
           if you installed TeX Live from the DVD image.
....

Is that sooo hard to digest???

> Right now I'm uninstalling TeXLive completely, loading up the entire repository on hard disk,
> And reinstalling from there just for fun... :-)

And why??? Why not
	tlmgr option repository /path/to/local/checkout/
??? That is the much faster option!

> Comments welcome!

Here they are, and in short: RTFM!!!!!!

The only problem that comes to my mind is file permissions.  Was
installation for all users (admin)?  Did you install under
%ProgramFiles%?  TL version (NET or DVD)?

I don't recall a report of this sort.

The uninstallation process goes like this:
- remove shortcuts, file assocs, etc., for each installed package
- remove TL from the search PATH
- unregister uninstaller
- delete TL directories

Since most of TL files are gone in your case, the installer won't work
any more and you probably have to do the remaining steps manually.

The point is to allow to do the most often needed actions.

Maybe it would be better to have a more complete GUI, allowing to do anything
that could be done from the command line, but:
- it is not that easy to design a GUI with lots of options without making it too
intimidating to the newcomers;
- a GUI allowing to do some tasks  but not all is better than no GUI at all.

Although I can understand why you make that last statement,
Manuel, I am not convinced that it is true.  Seamonkey (for
example) has an extremely large number of options, some
of them available only through an "Advanced" button, yet
it seems to be usable without difficulty by a large number
of people on multiple platforms.

Wait, I didn't say it was impossible. I just mean it requires some effort. You
can't just keep throwing new options in without thinking.

You mean, it is easy to design a GUI with lots of options and make it
usable and not too intimidating at the same time?

Everyone is free to provide improved guis for tlmgr. It is in fact quite easy as the gui simply calls the action subs, so hacking a new gui is easy, so why *nobody* steps forward to do it?


I would even offer the actual implementation if someone can send be detailed drawings of the Gui and all its windows/dialogs etc ....

So please ui-designers step forward!

Actually for MacOSX there is TeXLive Utility which is a native MacOSX
frontend for tlmgr albeit it does not have all the options CLI has. I
cannot recall anyone making big splashes on MacOSX mailing list
because of this. Probably people there believe that the person who
wants Advanced options should be sufficiently advanced to be able to
use CLI.

GUI design varies from OS to OS and a native interface is better than
the generic one.

Note that TeX Live Utility doesn't call the Perl subroutines directly, but runs tlmgr as a separate process.  No idea whether that's easier on Windows, but it might be another option (or maybe I misinterpreted Norbert's comment).

Frankly, it doesn't matter what people on mailing lists want...I decided long ago that I'm not going to add support for all tlmgr features.  There is a semi-hidden way to force removal in TeX Live Utility, but someone wanting to use 'generate' will have to use the command line and be responsible for his own mess :).

Howdy,

What I don't understand in all of this is that the mathtime pro fonts got installed but the same person is complaining because they have to disable the beleek fonts? Will tlmgr install those fonts (presumably placed in texmf-local or a personal txmf tree) or was that done using updmap(-sys) or by manually editing the updmap file?

Good Luck,

Subject: [tex-live] bug in TeXWorks
Message-ID: <4C61B8F0.2060507@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

I've found a bug in the windows version of TeXWorks shipped with TeXLive 
2010: when I try to save a file with an arbitrary extention, I click on 
"Save", then I select All files (*.*) in the list, and I choose the name 
myfile.myextention. Then I have an error saying that 
myfile.myextention.* is not a valid file name format. I guess it 
automatically adds the .* extention in this case, which makes it fail. 
The problem does not appear if I select "auxiliary file". I don't know 
if this bug is upstream or not, that's why I report it here.

Thank you,

This bug can be found in other Windows programs. It sometimes helps to
enclose the file name in quotes. In such a case the program does not
try to add any extension. Maybe this is not a bug of the program but
of the standard File/Save dialog.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Follow up report to this issue.

(For the record: during all of this I am logged in as admin,
and I am installing into the default area c:\texlive\2009)

Original install was done from DVD.
 
The next time I tried installing from a copy of the
install disk in hard drive to help speed things up.
(Otherwise it take almost 2 hours to install in this system.)
 
On second install, everything went smoothly as before,
except this time, TeXLive was not inserted into the path.
 
On uninstall, everything was properly removed, except
for all of the executables like last time.
I have no idea why that should be happening.
I am logged in as administrator and can easily delete
all of the leftover files manually after the uninstall.
 
On the thought that perhaps some other process was
perhaps interfering with the install and uninstall,
I rebooted the machine and stripped it down,
turning off literally everything non-essential.
Unplugged it from the internet, turned off
COMODO software firewall, and removed all
running process associated with the virus checker.
 
Then installed, rebooted, uninstalled.
As before, no PATH on install, and
all executables left over after uninstall.
 
I did the same thing with another machine that
I have running XP Professional (32 bit) and
on that machine everything installed and
uninstalled perfectly.  I compared the file
attributes on both machines and there is
no difference.
 
Any idea why Windows XP X64 would do something
this strange?  It's not as if I have any problems
on install or uninstall for any other software
I have...
 
Man all of this installing and uninstalling testing has
cost me an entire night.  If there is any more information
I could provide to help tracing this problem,
please let me know.
 
I also have a machine running Windows 7, 64-bit version.
I wonder what would happen on that machine.
 
Perhaps I can test it tomorrow.
 
Thomas

The only problem that comes to my mind is file permissions.  Was
installation for all users (admin)?  Did you install under
%ProgramFiles%?  TL version (NET or DVD)?

I don't recall a report of this sort.

The uninstallation process goes like this:
- remove shortcuts, file assocs, etc., for each installed package
- remove TL from the search PATH
- unregister uninstaller
- delete TL directories

Since most of TL files are gone in your case, the installer won't work
any more and you probably have to do the remaining steps manually.

Message-ID: <3779.1281517374@cl.cam.ac.uk>

we're in holiday season here, and i've got a few days planned before the
end of this month, when i shall be away from home.

it seems to me that i need to be around when the new version is to start
distribution to mirrors.  (in principle, other ctanners can tweak the
cambridge node, but it's most efficient if i'm there to do it.)

furthermore, we ought at least to give mirror sites a day's (or
preferably 2 days') notice of the event.

most of my planned activity is flexible, in the sense that i can do it
"any day" (there's just one day that needs booking, now).

so, is it possible to offer a date, yet, when tl2010 is going to be
available to mirror?  if not, is it possible even to guess which month
it is likely to happen?

Probably because it doesn't really have anything to do with TeX. The TECkit compiler is provided (IIRC) because it is used to create mapping files for use with the xetex font-mapping option, but general text file conversions could be considered out of scope.

TECkit compiler is useless for those who just use the map, they add
Mapping=something. The compiler is needed by developers of the maps.
and then it is useful to test the map by txtconv.

updmap: This is updmap, version $Id: updmap 17423 2010-03-11 17:53:34Z karl $
updmap: using transcript file `/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.log'
updmap: initial config file is `/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg'
updmap: configuration (updmap.cfg) unchanged. Map files will not be recreated.

I've checked the updmap.cfg file, and the entry "Map belleek.map" is still there (not commented out). Am I missing anything obvious, or is there a problem with updmap and the belleek font?

Thanks everybody for your patience with "rookies" like me,

Artemio

What happens for the name with suffix?
updmap-sys --disable belleek.map

updmap(-sys) knows nothing about packages, it knows just the map files
and looks for the file names. AFAIK
updmap-sys --disable belleek.map
is the only correct syntax

Herb,

sudo updmap-sys --disable belleek.map

worked like a charm! Thanks a lot for your expert and prompt help,

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=zAQCVR-nu9LNs=kdrwbvcetFam0gBHvRiSJnK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to get revtex4-1 to work under my /usr/local/texlive
installation . I installed revtex4-1 according to the README found in
the revtex4-1.zip file from here
https://authors.aps.org/revtex4/revtex4-1.zip . I then ran mktexlsr
and also texhash and it looks like it did the right thing :

texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-config/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-var/ls-R...
texhash: Done.

These commands also give :

$ kpsewhich revtex4-1.cls
/usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/tex/latex/revtex/revtex4-1.cls

$ kpsewhich revtex4.cls

$ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL
/usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local

But then when I try to run tex on the aps template under
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/doc/latex/revtex/sample/aps/apstemplate.tex
or on the 00readme.tex file from the revtex4-1 distribution I get the
error :

Any ideas?

This indicates that you should be using "latex", not "tex".

Howdy,

First of all revtex4-1.cls is already a part of TeX Live 2009 so there was no need to try to install it. BAacking you install out is probably the best thing you can do.

Second it probably isn't a good idea to compile a template since it probably needs things filled in to make it useful.

Finally, you need to compile with latex or pdflatex to have it work since \documentclass is pat of the LaTeX2e macro package. That is what the error message is all about

Good Luck,

I would get:
http://www.amazon.com/LaTeX-Document-Preparation-System-2nd/dp/0201529831

or, if you are too lazy to learn it, simply run
	latex apstemplate.tex
instead of
	tex apstemplate.tex

It looks like a document fragment which might be included by another
file but isn't meant to stand on its own. (There is no \documentclass
either but it contains LaTeX document commands.) If it were me, I'd
just read it in a text editor. It is not very long.

Good luck!

The file 00readme.tex is not a standalone LaTeX document.  It's
supposed to be included by another LaTeX document.

I fear that you can't compile this file separately.  But I suppose
that there is a LaTeX file somewhere which includes 00readme.tex,
either using \input{} or \include{}.  Sorry, ATM I don't have enough
time to reverse-engineer the revtex package for you.

I don't understand why such a file is in the top-level directory of a
package at all while the top-level README doesn't explain how to
process this file.

No. 00readme.tex is input by other documentation files, e.g.:

% The following references the \file{00readme} file,
% which contains basic information about this package.
% The contents of this file are generated when
% you typeset the programmer's documentation.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

I have now tried the install/uninstall of TeXLive 2009 on
four different systems, several times in some cases.
?
1 - Windows XP Laptop corporate image
2 - Windows XP Dell Laptop
3 - Windows XP X64
4 - Windows 7 (64 bit version)
?
On systems 1 and 4, the install and uninstall worked perfectly.
On systems 2 and 3, the install did not set the path properly,
and the uninstall did not remove the executable files, as explained previously.
?
At first I thought the non-removal of files might stem from the
fact that the system was running a Windows XP X64 operating system,
but when the procedure went perfectly on the 64-bit Windows 7 system,
that blew that hypothesis out the window.? On the other hand the
32 bit XP (1) system had worked perfectly, so I thought perhaps
that all XP systems would work well.? The test on system 2 proceeded to
destroy that idea.
?
The only other clue I have is a small thing that happens during install.
On the systems where the install/uninstall proceeded perfectly, the
third install screen entitled "The screen allows you to configure some options"
offered three options:
?
1) Use letter size instead of A4 by default
2) Add shortcuts to the menu and desktop
3) Installation for all users.
?
On the systems were things messed up, the third option was missing.
?
Is this perhaps a hint as to why the install/uninstall didn't work properly?
?
Does this hint prompt any ideas?
I'm at a loss, and just about out of time and patience. :-)

Message-ID: <A457AE0EC669934B985DC973A9B1B16D040E6C95@EVS3.aecl.ca>

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

This is a question about fonts and dviout.
Since the dviout list is essentially comatose,
I wasn't sure where to post it.
Please let me know if another mailing list is more appropriate.
 
When I first installed TeXLive 2009 on my windows systems,
I also had the pfm mathtime and CM fonts installed native
on the system.
 
Everything worked well, except for dviout when I tested it
with the default cm fonts.  For example when I tried to render
the following document on screen as a sort of "hello world":
 
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
test test
\end{document}
 
the font appeared as some strange san-serif font that didn't
look anything like the cm fonts, even though dviout seemed
to be going through the right motions.
 
After a lot of testing and head scratching, I finally traced it
down to the natively installed CM fonts.  When I uninstalled them,
dviout rendered everything perfectly.
 
Does anyone have an idea how I can make dviout 
and the pfm installed CM fonts co-exist peacefully?

How did you test path setting?  For single user installs (non-admin)
the user PATH should be used, otherwise the system PATH.

Thanks for spending so much time on investigating this.  The third
option is conditional on having admin rights, so it seems you don't
have them on these systems.

>From what you describe I'm more and more convinced that this is some
sort of write permissions / security policy settings on those systems
that interfere.  The uninstallation of TL executables is done the same
way as any other files, specifically, by executing:

  rmdir /s /q "C:\texlive\2009\bin"

command from a batch file.  You can try to execute that manually from
the command line after failed uninstall and see if and what kind of
error it generates.  Just be sure NOT to start the cmd.exe through
"Run as", because that may affect the permissions you have.

Or better yet, do the uninstallation from the command line by
executing uninst.bat directly:

  call C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat >"%temp%\tl-uninst.log" 2>&1

and send me the resulting tl-uninst.log file in the %TEMP% dir.

Cheers,

The saga continues

Several ways.
1) Get into the command line, and type "path": no path to TeXLive
2) Get into the command line and type "latex": wont execute (can't find it)
3) Right click on my computer and navigate to the system settings and look at the actual path.
   Result:  No user path set. Global path does not contain TeXLive

Not at all.  It takes some time, but when I see something broken, I'd like to
try and help fix it (it's the engineer in me perhaps)

I understand your sentiments regarding administrator rights, but I do try and
make sure that I have administrator rights to all of the windows machines I log into
because I install/uninstall a lot of stuff. I have installed/uninstalled literally
dozens of packages on this machine without a problem.
Besides, why it is that only the executable things don't get deleted.
Only .bat, .cmd, .dll, and .exe files remain!
And why can I readily delete them afterwards by hand from file explorer?

I didn't try that just yet, favouring the method outlined below:

>Or better yet, do the uninstallation from the command line by
>executing uninst.bat directly:
>

Alright, here's what I tried:

I started the command line windows from a shortcut that is targeted directly to:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
I hope that does not have any consequences with regard to the permissions
you described above.

Then I executed 
C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat >"%temp%\tl-uninst.log" 2>&1
(without the "call", since we're not in a batch file right now)

This uninstalled everything perfectly, and removed ALL of the files.
As expected from this performance, the contents of the tl-uninst.log file is:
============================================
        1 file(s) copied.
The system cannot find the file specified.
The system cannot find the file specified.
The system cannot find the file specified.
Done uninstalling TeXLive.
The batch file cannot be found.
============================================

The only think I could note is that the path is still as follows:

%SystemRoot%/system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%/System32/Wbem;C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32

I had added the texlive path manually at the end of the global string, 
so perhaps it's not surprising that is still there after the uninstall.

So I deleted the texlive path, and then re-installed.

Since this didn't show anything, I tried a thinking about a different tact.
The uninstall in the registry entry is at the following location correct?:

My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\TexLive2009

This is currently set to: "C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat"

How about changing it to: "C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat >"%temp%\tl-uninst.log" 2>&1"
instead.  But wait, I don't have enough experience with this. Perhaps the double set of quotes
might mess things up?

So I tried putting this string into the registry instead:
 
"C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat >C:\tl-uninst.log 2>&1"

But that didn't want to work...
The system now thinks TeXLive is already uninstalled, which is clearly incorrect.
when I set it back to "C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat" again,
everything reacts properly again.

Anyway, that's as far as I got.

Perhaps you can think of something else?

    Since the dviout list is essentially comatose,

Appearances are deceiving :).  The dviout authors and maintainers are on
the dviout list, really.  (And not all of them are on this list.)

Since no one has had an answer here, I'll resend your msg to dviout.
(I have no idea myself.)

All this sounds very misterious to me, but here is my 2 cent worth suggestion:
install with install-tl.bat -v -v >C:\install.log 2>&1 and send us the
install.log. After all, mysterious things are happening at installation too
(admin status not properly detected, path not set), so we may learn things here.

Thanks for taking the time to test,

Hi Robin,

    so, is it possible to offer a date, yet, when tl2010 is going to be

No.

    if not, is it possible even to guess which month
    it is likely to happen?

If we're lucky it will be (late) August, but September would not be a
surprise.

So, thanks for checking, but do you whatever you need/want to do in

right now.

Our installer checks for admin rights by trying to get full access to
the HKLM environment key.  For some reason it doesn't get it.  The
failure to set (user) path is also very mysterious.

That is very bizarre.  I have no clue what could cause the uninstaller
to behave differently when launched from the command line instead of
add/remove programs.

Hmm, I can't remember how this was handled in the original '09
release. In the current installer that should be removed too.

Yep.

Good thinking.

Perhaps this would work:

  "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c
C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat >C:\tl-uninst.log 2>&1"

or putting that in an intermediate foo.bat and using that in the registry.

Also, please edit ...\tlpkg\installer\uninst.bat and remove '@echo
off' at the top, so we can see which commands are executing and
failing.

Not much except that on the next attempt you can also follow Manuel's
advice and send us the full debug log from running:

  install-tl.bat -v -v >C:\install.log 2>&1

Cheers,

Subject: [tex-live]  texdoc issues
Message-ID: <201008130345.o7D3ihje028466@comp.uark.edu>


The command
     texdoc pgf
produced a wildly inappropriate document (number 1 below).

Adding switch -l produces

   1 C:\TL\2010\texmf-dist\doc\latex\pgf-umlsd\pgf-umlsd-demo.pdf
     = Package demo
   2 C:\TL\2010\texmf-dist\doc\latex\pgf-umlsd\pgf-umlsd-demo2.pdf
     = Package demo (2)
   3 C:\TL\2010\texmf-dist\doc\generic\pgf\pgfmanual.pdf
   4 C:\TL\2010\texmf-dist\doc\generic\pgf\images\pgfmanual-mindmap-1.pdf
   5 C:\TL\2010\texmf-dist\doc\generic\pgf\images\pgfmanual-mindmap-2.pdf
   6 C:\TL\2010\texmf-dist\doc\latex\pgf-soroban\pgf-soroban-doc.pdf

I can't imagine what heuristics would not put 3 above 1 and 2.
Perhaps the bonus for directories which exactly match the
keyword (pgf in this case) is not sufficiently high. It ought to
put 3, 4, and 5 at the top. Changing it in score.tlu from 0.5 to
1.0 sets things right.

Running texdoc with -d, it seems that number 3 (pgfmanual) gets
a heuristic score of 3.5, while number 1 (pgf-umlsd-demo) gets
a heuristic score of only 1.0. Somehow, however, the latter gets
2.5 added to its heuristic score. I can't imagine why.

Because of an alias, "texdoc tikz" correctly opens pgfmanual.pdf.
Barring the above change, pgf needs the same alias.

Dan

Hi folks,

yesterday I updated my texlive tree from 2009 to 2010
and my thesis compiled anymore... After some investigations
I found out that tl10 contains a older version of xfrac (0.2a)
then my a tlmgr updated tl09 (0.3), which cause my compiling problems...

Try this

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{xfrac}
\usepackage{keycommand}
\usepackage{glossaries}

\begin{document}
Hallo

I can confirm that 0.3 is in tl09 while 0.2a is in tl10. However, 0.2a
is what is currently found on ctan. So maybe it's the package author's
decision to decline to 0.2a.

This is works for me with TL 2010. I wonder where xfrac 0.3 came from: I 
only know of v0.2a.

Ah, I remember now. v0.3 was the version I re-span to keep xfrac in sync 
with expl3. Something odd must have happened at the CTAN end. I'll talk 
to Robin and Morten about this and see if it can be sorted.

Same wonderment here! And I am supposed to be the author... 0.2a is
what is released - I do not remember 0.3.

Morten is rather 'busy', so Lars is looking after things on his behalf. 
There were some issues with xfrac which I sorted out, but only uploaded 
to CTAN and not to Morten's source repository. I'll sort out xfrac, make 
sure it goes to the correct places and then upload it to CTAN on 
Morten's behalf. Give me a day or so.

The 2.5 is the score for a comment in the catalogue (here "Package demo"). Such
comments are free-form strings, so it's not easy to know what to do with them,
but in general texdoc assumes they mean the file is important (unless it finds
"readme" in the comment, then the added score is lower). (I'll expand the debug
output to make that clearer.)

The point here is, pdfmanual.pdf doesn't have any comment, which is surprising,
since it there is one in my installation. Can you please try

tlmgr install --reinstall pgf

and see if it fixes the problem? (Comments are read from texlive.tlpdb.)

Regardless of this problem, you're right that the bonus for good directory
should probably be higher. I'll think a bit further and do a few checks, and
probably change it.

Thanks for your report and suggestion,
Manuel.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Alright,

I have some good news and some bad news on this issue.

The good news is that my install/uninstall seems to be working correctly now.
The bad news is that I really have absolutely no clue as to WHY.
Perhaps it was my state of mind that fixed things last night?
Perhaps it was the Leonids?  I don't know.

In any case, when I got home last night, I attempted to go ahead with
modifying the registry for the uninstall in various ways that were suggested,
but invariably, for whatever reason, the system kept telling me that
the package was already uninstalled.  Then, as a result of my fiddeling
somehow I managed to get rid of the desktop icons and the program entry
and even the uninstall entry in the registry, probably due to a partial
uninstall caused by my rude prodding.

So I decided to wipe the slate clean manually, and reinstall and try again
to uninstall.

When I installed, the first thing I noticed was that The "third option"
(local/global) was now active, which I found very strange to begin with
because I wasn't logging in any differently than before...
And then when the install was finished and I checked, lo and behold,
there was the path, all properly set and everything.

So without attempting anything more, I rebooted, and did an uninstall,
which now worked perfectly. Huh.  Go figure.

So something happened (perhaps it was that Windows update yesterday?)
but for the life of me I have no idea why.  Widows is sometimes strange
that way.

So the upshot is that I now seem to have a properly working system,
and we have lost our opportunity to try and track down why it wasn't
properly before.

Unfortunately, the other system on which the uninstall didn't work properly
is heavily used, and I would get my fingers smacked if I started to
monopolize it for testing, so that's out as well.

Sorry for the bad news, but I really tried my best.
Thanks also for all of the excellent response, help and suggestions from
everyone on this issue as well!

Thomas

I apologize for resending this but I haven't gotten any reply and all my 
attempts to convinve tlmgr to update the distribution brought forth no 
effect. I could keep updating my MikTex distribution so I see that TeX changes 
are posted out. 

Would it be possible to continue the TexLive2009 tlmgr to update the 
distribution or should I wait unitl the TeXlive2010 is out ?

thanks ... 

Michael

Anyway, the answer is no: it is not possible to update 2009 any more. You have
to wait until 2010 is out, and install it. Alternatively, you can install the
current (and probably final) pretest release of TL2010 if you can't wait:

Hi Manuel, 

I sure didn't receive your reply in my email.

Thanks for update. So I will then just patiently wait for the TL2010... 

BTW are there any real changes in TeX ? I saw the vieo presentation by D. 
Knuth who was obviously being facetious ...

best regards
-Michael

Sure :-)

You'll find a summary of the actual changes in the TL 2010 documentation:

Manuel,

Thanks ... I hope that TL2010 is 'uneventful' and I am looking forward to 
installing it. 

I have 1 last irrelevant Q: is there any good in your oppinion open source 
code to translate PDF to PNG ? I tried the 'convert' but it does not seem to 
do anti-aliasing for text vertically oriented.

thanks again

Michael

To answer my own question:

/usr/local/bin/gs -dNOPAUSE  -dBATCH \
                -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 \
		-sDEVICE=pngalpha -sOutputFile=$Fpng $Fpdf


Actually this should be useful to all those who have tried to create graphical 
elements with OOffice 3.2.1 and wanted to import them seemlessly 
in as .eps or .pdf images using latex or pdflatex respectively and obtain 
decent results.

1) Draw figure in OO 3.2.1 (earlier may have font rendering issues)

2) Ctrl-A to grab single figure and save as PDF + Option 'selected' into say G.PDF 

3) pdftops -eps G.PDF G.PS ;		# create PS as eps

5) epstopdf --outfile=G.pdf F.eps 	# to .pdf with corrected BB

6) gs -dNOPAUSE  -dBATCH \

                -sDEVICE=pngalpha -sOutputFile=G.png G.pdf

					# if you need a .png

Now you can include the G.eps, G.pdf or G.png in latex/pdflatex or HTML and 
have the correct BB.

Use pdfcrop after step 2, then you do not need steps 4 and 5. This
works also for multipage PDF files, each page will have its own BB.

I have done that. Now pgfmanual.pdf comes first, and gets a heuristic
score of 3.5 (as before) but a final score of 6.

But what is step 6 good for?  It is highly undesired to convert vector
graphics to bitmaps.  

BTW, I never used OpenOffice or Microsoft Word because their user
interfaces are so inconvenient.  TeX Live provides some tools for
creating vector graphics (Metapost, Asymptote, PGF/TikZ, PStricks).
They are extremely powerful.  But if you prefer a graphical user
interface, consider this:

Hi Reinhard,

I post some times on the web HTML versions of articles I write with TeX, using 
the .png versions of the figures.

I started using OO for convenience since Xfig is now too far behind for one to 
be able to work quickly with complex figures. I wanted to have a common basis 
to generate .pdf and .eps to include in the latex document. I am used to 
including .eps (Xfig or gnuplot). I am now noving to .pdf and pdflatex so I 
was trying to see what's the best way to draw and export once and then get correct 
.pdf .eps and .png;

Unfortunately, exporting a figure to pdf directly from OO basically generates 
an entire page. The fonts and the antialiasing look good though. At the same 
time expoting .eps even tough the BB seems to be OK, fonts look horribly and 
even line drawings look antialiased. OO does a great job exporting to .png.

Anyway after several trial and error attempts I ended up with the sequence 
below which seems to generate correct BB for .pdf and correctly looking fonts 
for the .eps figures. 


inkscape is not easily portable to Solaris10 (yes I am a die hard 
old-schooler). I have seen it on windows and linux and looks good. I would 
love to use it on Solaris10 one day. 

Thanks for the tips

Michael

For bitmap graphics (photographs) .png or .jpeg is fine, but I don't
think that it's a good idea to convert vector graphics to bitmaps.  I
assume that most web browsers support .svg nowadays, which is the
preferred file format for Scalable Vector Graphics in the internet.

Is the whole page visible, without being clipped?

...but line drawings are not scalable then.

You can always get the BoundingBox:

   gs -sDEVICE=bbox .........

More likely the Perseids than the Leonids.  Or probably, since you're
on Windows, the Leonids from last year?  :)

I'm aware that the hint comes too late but maybe it's helpful whenever
you encounter such problems in the future:

Before you change anything in the registry manually, it's best to dump
the content of the registry to a text file.  I don't have Windows and
therefore can't provide precise instructions.  AFAIR there is an
"Export" entry in the "File" menu of regedit.exe.

The created text file is UCS-2 encoded, if it screws up your favourite
text editor, try another one.  Emacs is always a good choice.

Such a registry dump is quite useful.  Especially if you create
another one after you modified the registry and the system behaves
differently then.  You can use standard tools like "diff" in order to
compare the two files.  It helps to find out what you've actually
changed and which of your changes solved the problem.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Clea,

    I noticed that texnansi.enc includes germandbls twice but no SS. The
    same is true of the 8y.etx included with fontinst. Is this intentional?
    If so, could somebody explain the thinking behind it?

As for texnansi goes, the first germandbls (at "19) is to match CM
(thus, existing macros would work).

The second (at "DF) is to match ISO Latin N encodings (thus, documents
written in Latin 1 or whatever would work).

I assume that 8y.etx was following the .enc.

By the way, there is texnansx which eliminates the duplicates from
texnansi.  (There are others besides germandbls.)

As for SS, the general idea of the original TeX encodings was the exact
opposite of (and considerably predates) Unicode: encode glyphs, not
characters (because glyphs are what are in fonts, after all).  SS was
not needed as a separate glyph (and doesn't exist in Latin N, either).
SS did make it into T1 (and "extex.enc", I see), as you probably know.

Best,
karl

I had some idea that for any encoding, TeX needing a mapping from upper
case to lower case and vice-versa. So I thought that the inclusion of
SS had to do with that and would therefore need to be in any encoding
which included germandbls. Obviously not!

Yes, that *is* the case. SS was mainly put in to make \uppercase
and \lowercase work.

I was at the session in Cork where this was proposed and decided,
and can attest that fact.

Howdy,

I assume that ``no news is good news'' as far as TL2010 DVD creation is concerned and things are going according to schedule(?).

Looking ahead, will the addresses for the repositories for TL2010 be the same as those for the then retired TL2009?  I assume that the TL2010 repositories will simply replace the TL2009 versions.

Good Luck,

Message-ID: <20100818.010729.198137159.ssakata@interchange.ubc.ca>

I regularly use TeXLive 2007 on my machines running Debian
Linux. Given my positive experiences with TeXLive, I recommended it to
my friend and installed TeXLive 2009 on her new computer a few days
ago. Her machine is running Windows 7. 

To test the installation, she ran LaTeX to process a document using
lots of packages. Unfortunately, she got a strange error message,
which says that rcs.sty is not found on the system. After checking
several things, I found that the cause of the problem was ls-R in the
texmf-dist directory did not contain lines for the directory rcs,
where rcs.sty lived. After playing with mktexlsr on her machine for a
few hours, I now suspect that mktexlsr simply ignores any directory
named "rcs" or "RCS" (and maybe rCS, rcS, etc., too).

On Linux machines, mktexlsr is a shell script. Looking at the one on
my machine, I have realized that mktexlsr on my machine strips off the
directories named RCS. Probably, the windows version of mktexlsr in
TeXLive 2009 does the same. Nevertheless, the capitalization could be
ignored on Windows platforms, depending on how mktexlsr obtains the
directory information. This may be the reason why mktexlsr does not
work correctly on my friend's machine.

Anyway, I hope that the problem will be corrected in the future
verions of TeXLive. To bypass the problem in the short run, I renamed
the directory "rcs" to "rcs1" and ran mktexlsr again. The problem is
gone now.

Best,

  Shinichi

RCS directory is an administrative area of an RCS working copy
(similarly CVS directory for CVS wirking copy). Such directories
should not be seen by TeX. Unfortunatelly, Windows file systems are
not case sensitive, so they consider rcs and RCS being equal.

But it would be perfectly reasonable for a TeX user (Windows,
Unix, whatever) to /want/ a directory called (case-irrelevant)
"RCS", "CVS", or whatever, so to deliberately ignore such
directories just because they /might/ be something to
do with a Revision Control System, or a C-dontknow
?Versioning? System would seem to me a fairly major design
error to me.  How many normal TeX users have even /heard/
of RCS or CVS, let alone use one or other in conjunction
with their TeX work ?

I would prefer another solution. TL developers know what directories
are ignored and they decide what the directory names of the packages
would be. Knowing that TL  may be installed on a case insensitive file
system, the directory names in the TL packages should be made safe
with this respect.

Funny that it pops up now, the last 3 or 4 or 5 years nobody complained ;-)
Nobody evennoticed ... so it seems that it is not a *feature* the
many people find disturbing.

I have several of my papers in an VCS, working concurrently with 
other authors ... so at least for me this feature comes in handy.

Should not such reserved directories simply live outside
of user space ?  For example, if the root of the installation
is D:\TeX\Live\2010, could there not be a directory
D:\TeX\Live\2010\System in which all such files live ?  Since
this would (by definition) not be a branch of the tree
into which arbitrarily named user files would be placed,
would that not be a cleaner and better solution ?

Yes, I don't doubt that you do, Norbert, but with the greatest
respect, you are not a "normal TeX user", nor does the fact
that one person (and I am sure there are more) use such a
feature in any way conflict with my suggestion that the
vast majority of TeX users do not.

But then you can't move a dir around and still keep its information
from the SCM.

I also use the texmf-tree from the TL SVN.

This problem only happens with RCS, as this doesn't use dot-files for
storing its information (like CVS, SVN and git do).

Sorry, the VCS create these directories.  The only one I know which
keeps meta data outside the tree is Perforce.  But this is proprietary
software and thus not as popular as CVS or SVN.  And Perforce has
other disadvantages.

The default Mac OS X filesystem is also not case sensitive, so it
would be nice if any scripts in TeX Live didn't assume
case-sensitive filesystems.

To the best of my knowledge, no script in TeX Live assumes a case-sensitive
filesystem.

The problem here is not really case sensitivity, it's rather to known if
ignoring "well-known" directories used by popular VCSes, namely

	.bzr .git .hg .svn CVS RCS _darcs

does more good than harm.

Well, one could argue that the rcs directory ignored has something to do with
RCS, since rsc.sty is about using information from RCS keywords ;-)

But obviously, shipping a package in a directory using a special name that our
tools will ignore is a bug and we're going to fix it.

I'm take it you're thinking of a definition of "normal" such that the answer is:
"zero, by definition" ;-)

Sounds reasonable. I just checked, and the rcs package is the only problematic
case, so we could just rename it to something like rcs-pkg, for example.

The only problem remaining would be a user installing something in a directory
names rcs in texmf-local (texmfhome is not a problem since it doesn't use a ls-R
index file by default). So we could also decide to stop ignoring RCS and CVS
directories (it seems really unlikely to me that someone ever wants to use a
directory named .<something> or _darcs).

I'm not very familiar with RCS nor CVS, but I'm under the impression the files
in "real" RCS or CVS directories are unlikely to be confused with other files,
since they either end with ",v" (RCS) or are name "Entries" or "Repository"
(CVS). So, if the only harm they do by being included in a ls-R index is slowing
down the lookups a little bit, maybe it would be acceptable?

Manuel,

Well, mktexlsr of TeXLive 2007 on my Debian Linux box, which is a
shell script, is case-sensitive. But I was talking about the one for
Windows. Mktexlsr of TeXLive 2009 installed on my friend's Windows 7
box is a binary executable file (i.e., the one with extension
.exe). So, the source code can be quite different from the shell
script version of mktexlsr you are talking about.

Anyway, TeXLive 2009 contains a LaTeX package named rcs, which is
sitting in directory rcs. The feature of the windows' version of
mktexlsr keeps users from using it, because rcs/rcs.sty never shows up
in ls-R. This is a bug in my opinion, though it can be bypassed easily
if you know what is going on, as I mentioned in my initial message. By
the way, rcs.sty used to be in latex/misc. A possible solution may be
to move it back there.

Let me be a little more precise: to the best of my knowledge, no script in TL
requires a case-sensitive filesystem to work correctly. Of course scripts
running in case-sensitive environments are going to work in a case-sensitive
way, but they won't break in a case-insensitive environment.

Sure it is. I think (hope) everybody agrees on that point. The only point under
discussion is, how we should solve it.

No, the ultimate goal is to get rid of latex/misc. It's much cleaner to have the
files here in separate packages.

Indeed, I tend to have directories with such names grouping stuff that I
grap from version control systems.

No TeX users are "normal" by most definitions, so I don't
think this discussion will go anywhere useful :).  In my
opinion, though, ignoring directories which don't have a
leading . is more trouble than it's worth.  

FWIW, I kept all TeX files from my dissertation under CVS, 
and the CVS directories have 3 files: Entries, Repository,
and Root.  My guess is that those would not affect search
performance significantly.  I can't speak for RCS, since
I've never used it directly.

I've been using TL2010-pretest to update a number of documents and
everything has been working nicely -- I hope others who are
not affected (or can work around) by previously reported issues are
also putting TL2010-pretest to good use.

Maybe there should be a "swap" -- "-pretest" becomes "texlive" and a
small number of the existing TL2009 "texlive" repos are preserved as
"-previous" for those who may need to repair or restore (e.g., update
a DVD install when replacing a stolen laptop) the previous version.

It would certainly be a good idea to announce in good time
the imminent removal of the TeX Live 2009 repositories so
that those of use who are able can take one final snapshot
that can be used for the very purposes that you propose.

Since we're clearly converging on agreement, I would
not want to pursue this one unnecessarily, but I do
most genuinely believe that /most/ TeX users are
blissfully unaware of RCS (or believe it stands
for Residence and Catering Services, as it does
at my former college), CVS (presumably a place
for curricula vitae) and as for "Git", well --
a little exposure to Steptoe and Son [1] would
provide many many examples of what that word means
to many of us :-)

    I assume that ``no news is good news'' as far as TL2010 DVD creation is

Sure.  Whatever that means.

    Looking ahead, will the addresses for the repositories for TL2010 be
    the same as those for the then retired TL2009?  I assume that the
    TL2010 repositories will simply replace the TL2009 versions.

Yes.

Yes, this is reasonable, a better name for this directory is rcs-util.

It's not sufficient to change the shell script, the binary for Windows
has to be adapted as well.  I doubt that it's worth the effort.

People who are using version control systems usually don't host their
projects in texmf trees.  The problem Shinichi reported was caused by
a package provided by TeX Live, and it can be fixed quite easily.

At a first glance it looks fine because kpathsea depends on filename
extensions.  But the way Knuth handles extensions is always good for
surprises.  Kpathsea even enhances the problem because the search
order is wrong, and case-insensitive file systems enhance the problem
even more.

Sigh! Everything could be so easy if computer programs simply do what
users ask for.  But obviously neither Knuth nor Microsoft have a clear
concept.

I'm not concerned about efficiency because no project which is under
RCS or CVS can be so large that the extra entries in ls-R slow down
the system significantly.  TeX Live provides more than 85,000 files.

Maybe, but if the conclusion is that mktexlsr should be changed, I
vote for simplicity: Don't maintain a list of directories which should
be ignored anymore.  Just ignore all directories with names beginning
with a dot.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Possible bug in texmf-dist/tex/luatex/luaotfload
Message-ID: <4C6D250F.3050408@rose.uni-heidelberg.de>

Hello,

today I came upon a problem in otfl-node-inj.lua 
(texmf-dist/tex/luatex/luaotfload). My version of LuaTeX is 
beta-0.60.2-2010071218. I'm using texlive pretest at the moment.

Here is some output:
--- snip ---
(./s_articles.tex (./3579.deaf(load:

The last line of the following code snippet of otfl-node-inj.lua is line 
197. In my case the local variable tm stays nil. For that reason I get 
problems at line 197.

             local nf, tm = nil, nil
             for n in traverse_id(glyph,head) do

                     valid[#valid+1] = n
                     if n.font ~= nf then
			nf = n.font
                         tm = fontdata[nf].marks
                     end
                     mk[n] = tm[n.char]

My problems go away if I do a small modification:

 >                     end

Is there a bug in otfl-node-inj.lua or is there a problem on my side?

Marcus

Message-ID: <1372DDD2-355F-42A1-8857-583BFF126AC0@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to write my schedule for classes with Termcal. http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/termcal/

It works great, except for a snag. Instead of generating two columns  
(or 5 depending on the number of days in a week). I would like for it  
to generate the table with only one column with each date in a  
separate row. I suspect I have to modify the termcal.sty file. I also  
need to add as the topic name as bold for that particular day in the  
same line as the date.

Since I am not very familiar with editing style files, I was wondering  
if someone can take a look and point me in the right direction?

Thanks.

Hi,

Are the files generated by updmap and fmtutil platform independent? We
are thinking of providing a pre-made texmf-var in OpenBSD packages (if
possible). Is there anything else I would need other than texmf-var
(texmf-config?).

Tips and info are gratefully accepted.

> Are the files generated by updmap and fmtutil platform independent?

  Yes, absolutely.  The map files produced by updmap are plain text
files whose syntax varies slightly between the different programs that
read them (dvips, dvipdfm, pdftex), but in any case it does not depend
on the platform.  The format files also don't depend on the platform
they're produced on, although their layout varies greatly from one
engine to the other (TeX, pdfTeX, XeTeX, etc.).  I seem to remember that
at some point, LuaTeX generated format files that depended on the
endianness of the processor, but that was definitely considered a bug
and has been fixed since then.

  The configuration files in texmf/web2c, obviously, since that's where

You can install TeX Live on a server and mount it (via NFS or Samba)
on various clients.  This worked for Unix systems for years, for
Windows since TeX Live 2008.  This means that everything except the
files in bin/<platform> is platform independent.

I recommend not to change anything in texmf at all unless there is a
good reason.

Hi. First of all this mailing list is dedicated to TeX Live
_development_ and _maintaining_ but not package (re)writing.

If you want to ask how to adapt some package to your need you should use
texhax mailing list.

I only glance at termcal documentation and couldn't say more but I think
you could get desired result not rewriting package but writing your own
macros.

For reference you could use books listed here [1] and internet resources
here [2]

    Are the files generated by updmap and fmtutil platform independent?

Updmap merely generates plain text files, so certainly yes in that case.

Format files are supposed to be platform independent but this is an area
where there seems to be new bugs most years, so you can't be sure unless
you actually try it with the binaries you are shipping.  (That is,
generate fmt f on each platform x and read it on each other platform y,
for all f, x and y that you care about.)

Neither of them are *package* independent.  If you let your users choose
which packages are installed, e.g., which fonts, then your map file
won't be accurate.  OTOH, the extra entries won't cause any harm that I
can think of.

Good luck,
karl

Yes, exactely. Please take care not to mess that up. Last time you installed
the config.ps and updmap.cfg file as distributed but not all fonts
were installed.

*IF* you have several different packages (like we do have in Debian), 
you *HAVE* to have an automatism that activates/deactivates the map file
in updmap.cfg and calls updmap-sys afterwards.

This is done in TL proper within tlmgr, and in Debian in the postinst of
the packages, or better now triggered automatically.

This is what we want to try and avoid, as for users on slow machines (some crazy
people use texlive on their PDAs) it takes forever.

Seeing as we only have 2 texmfs that would install any fonts, I hope to be able
to pre-generate the 2 configurations for those (along with ls-R etc...). Any
further comments on this?

Thanks for your replies - Hopefully this can work.

If the target configuration(s) are basically frozen, i.e., no adding
or removing new packages, then I think this is fine, otherwise I would
follow Norbert's advice (and there is no one more qualified to give
such advice than Norbert).

If there are only two packages and you can make sure that always the
right updmap.cfg or better psfonts.map is installed, then it can work out.

But what if other users/system admins want to install their private fonts?

Imagine a department with University/company specific fonts that need
to be activated? This *IS* a real situation I have seen myself several 
times.

Think about possible usage szenarios.

In the above case I would prepare on more package
	texlive-pda
or so where no changes are possible, but for the rest I would allow some
dynamic adaption.

Otherwise you will get flooded with bug reports:
	How do I activate a font map file?
	I want to get rid of the TeX Live installed beellek fonts?
	TeX doesn't find our department fonts?
...

I think you guys have things wrong, from a packaging point of view.

In the current world, most people install texlive from packages made
by their distributors.   The way things are organized corresponds to
a view of the Unix world that went out of favor 10 years ago.

The current script organization is a "lazy" view, you run all kinds of
stuff during the actual installation of the package. There are two
operations at work:
1/ scanning a set of files to generate map/ls-R/whatever information.
2/ store that information on the local machine.

On *any* machine which runs with prebuilt packages, doing the first operation
during install is a complete waste of time.

Heck, the texlive packages are huge, it already takes some time to extract
it, then (get this), when you run updmap and mktexlsR, it takes *almost as
much time* to finish the installation.d

This is a total disgrace, most of this information should be auto-generated
during packaging.

How about this:
- during packaging, scan information *relevant to the package at hand* and
store it in the package (as a partial map/partial ls-R), in a specific
place (say a given directory).
- during install, after doing each and every package, just merge those
partial maps together, and create the "final" map files and ls-R.

If an admin has his own files, well, he can run those tools to generate
those partial maps, and have them picked up during installation/update.

I'm pretty sure this is not even hard-to-do, you would just have to
figure out a place to dump partial information, and extend the tools
slightly to separate the scanning/merging/creating map information.

I'm pretty certain that *you can get rid of 99% of the time spent running
special commands* during install for the end user.  This makes a huge
difference for people wanting to run texlive on small netbooks (or
zaurii), and will even be useful for people with fast machines.

Even if the admin has his own files, this is totally dwarfed by the total
size of the texlive installation. Generating those map *once* during packaging
is a huge gain.

The slight problem is the "just merge" you mentioned ...

So if you are pretty sure, stop insulting us, [insult deleted] and program it!!!
Let me see the outcome, and I will be one of the first who merges it 
into Debian packages for example ...

Yes yes, easy scanning the updmap.cfg file, which has redirections
to the map files, and they again contain definitions.

Just a small question: What to do with duplicate entries? Sorting?

Sure, everything *can* be done, so please DO IT and [insult deleted]

How hard can it be ? are the formats *that* complicated ? in most cases,
it's just a question of parsing a few lines of text and merging them.

I can put it on my list of things to do. I'm rather busy with a lot of things,
so it might take a while.

Sort and remove duplicates... that's sort -u to you ;-)

If it's currently difficult to do, maybe tweaking the file formats to make
things simpler is the best idea ?

And yeah, I haven't been directly involved with TeX* for a few years. Doesn't
mean I didn't use to be, and don't know what I'm talking about...

And sort them... It can be programmed in perl using associative arrays
but it is known that such operations in perl are time consuming. It
would be better to add a new function to kpathsea that would collect
these merges during instalation and finally writes everything to the
disk, maybe Berkeley DB could be used for this purpose in order to
make it faster than perl implementation. Merging the map files is
exactly the job of updmap(-sys). If you know how to merge map files
more efficiently, why should it be in the installer only? Why not to
implement updmap in a better way?

Right. Let's come back to this after we see some code, shall we?

> I can put it on my list of things to do.

If you can come up with a good and clean solution, I'm all for it.
But if you're just going to bolt some more complexity on top of the
existing code, then thanks very much.  We have already enough to do
without adding more ways for things to go wrong.

I'm not sure about map files, so I won't discuss them. Concerning ls-R files, at
first glance, it seems doable to update them without re-scanning the whole tree,
which is indeed quite expensive due to disk access. Actually, one could even
imagine generating the ls-R files for TEXMFMAIN and TEXMFDIST from texlive.tlpdb.

The main problem could be people changing files here and manually running
mktexlsr afterwards. We can't always assume people do things the right way.

I'm not saying it's worth it, I have no definite opinion on that right now, but
it seems technically doable.

By the way, the formats (fmt files) definitely need to be regenerated (I'm
probably stating the obvious, but anyway).

Well, simplifying the way map entries are handled would definitely be great, but
that would be an ambitious project. (Which doesn't mean it shouldn't be done,
but it would definitely require consequent work and careful thought.)

The same thought occurred to me (except I thought about using .tlpobj files).

That wouldn't be a problem if done with explicit switch to mktexlsr,
like --add-tlpobj foo.tlpobj.  But this only makes sense if we finally
get around to rewrite mktexlsr in Perl.  Then we could reuse our TL
modules and perhaps end up with a nice and concise implementation
(although, probably not as concise as ~20 lines long ;)

Right.  It would make sense to do some measurements first to see where
the actual bottlenecks are and how much the can be optimized.  The
whole thing might turn out just not worth it.  On my (partial) TL
installation running updmap & fmtutil -all & mktexlsr takes 10 sec
(warmed up) and a few sec more on cold system, so speed was never an
issue for me.

It's not obvious to me, but I never really looked into this.

I don't even have a clue what is the problem now (never looked into
that either).

Yep, on install the .tlpobj files can be used, but on removal we don't have them
any more. Anyway, the data in the tlpobj and in the tlpdb are hopefully the same :-)

Yep.

I'm not against the idea of doing measurements, but as far as ls-R files are
concerned, I'm pretty sure any solution working at an abstract level (that is,
patching the file) will be orders of magnitude faster than walking a tree of
circa 100 000 files in 7 000 directory doing actual stat()s and readdir()s.

Concerning updmap, I have no opinion (yet), as I stated earlier.

On my old server (P3 600, slow disks) mktexlsr alone takes a bit more than 1
minute, and that is for TL2007, 2010 is quite bigger.

I mean, *when* something concerning the formats is changed, the only way to
handle that is to regenerate the formats, patching them like we would patch the
ls-R files is not an option. (Binary files, engine-dependent format, etc.)

Hyphenation patterns are inside the format.  These patterns are
definitely not additive in the binary format file. Reimplementing this
part of the iniTeX engine in perl so that the format files can be
patched according to user selection would be painful

since TeX Live 2010 isn't officially added to Fedora yet, I don't file
a Bugzilla ticket but bother you directly. :)

When the attached TrueType font "empty.ttf" is present in one of the
scanned font directories, the LuaTeX utility "mkluatexfontdb" crashes
with a segfault (using the latest TeX Live 2010 build from your yum
repo). This empty font is obviously an exotic case but it's a valid
TTF file that should be handled properly.

Maybe you can forward this issue to the proper TeX Live or LuaTeX
developers.

Regards,
Martin

Looks like the font was lost during forward, without the font there is
little one can do.

It looks like a luatex (engine) bug, submitted to luatex bug tracker:

I've committed something to the luatex repository that removes the
crash, at least.

I confirm the fix, using the font for actual typesetting is just fine
(it shows nothing as expected).

Message-ID: <64357B7E-B9EC-4F62-8900-CD8551EF5CCE@inf.ethz.ch>

Hello

I've decided to try out the pretest version of TeX Live 2010. I've found some issues that I'd like to report back. I used the network installer and only selected a subset of the distribution. See below for the details:

Network install (customized)
----------------------------

Binaries:

u: x86_64-linux

Installation scheme:

a: basic scheme

Custom collections:

a: Essential programs and files
g: Recommended fonts
l: Recommended generic packages
o: Basic LaTeX packages
p: LaTeX3 packages
t: LaTeX recommended packages
v: Advanced math typesetting
y: Graphics packages and programs
D: XeTeX packages

Custom languages:

j: US and UK English
m: German

Options: default values


Problems
--------

* tlmgr --help: The TeX Live Manager uses "less" to display the help text. In the new version, it shows some wired escape sequences. I guess there is something wrong in rendering the man-page.

* XeTeX: missing package binhex.tex. When I tried to compile one of my real-life documents using XeTeX and "unicode-math", it tried to pull in "binhex.tex". I think this is needed by the package "xpackages". The missing file belongs to the "kastrup" package. The problem seems to be a missing dependency of "xpackages" to "kastrup".

Installing "kastrup" manually using tlmgr solved the problem.

* XeTeX: segfault when using strechy math characters and <unicode-math>.
  Example document:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{amsmath}
  \usepackage{unicode-math}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  \begin{equation*}
      \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation*}
  
  \end{document}
  
In TeX Live 2009, this document rendered without stretchy characters (on Linux), but XeTeX did not segfault. This is clearly a regression from the previous version.


Best regards,
Markus

That seems very odd, as xpackages shouldn't to my knownledge need that. 
Could you post or send directly an example? (I note that this is not a 
TeX Live issue per se, but I'd like to understand it anyway.)

unicode-math.sty line 29:

	\RequirePackage{fontspec}[2010/05/18]

fontspec.sty line 22:

	\input binhex.tex  % before expl syntax!

So, strictly speaking, unicode-math should have a dependency on fontspec,
and fontspec should depend on kastrup.

(I was bitten by this too.)

I don't see this in konsole from Ubuntu 10.4, with TERM=xterm or on Mac OS X.

I think this is a known issue -- the workaround is to install the i386
binaries.

Hi Markus,

    I've decided to try out the pretest version of TeX Live 2010.

Thanks for the reports.  

    * tlmgr --help: The TeX Live Manager uses "less" to display the help
      text. In the new version, it shows some wired escape sequences. 

Neither less nor any other pager is hard-coded.  What tlmgr does is call
pod2usage(), which calls perldoc.  If that doesn't display properly,
there's not much we can do about it.  Perhaps it is related to the
terminal program being used, also.  If perldoc is not in the path, we
don't use it.

    * XeTeX: missing package binhex.tex. 

Ok, will fix one way or another, but when you custom-choose a set of
collections, missing packages are not unexpected.

    * XeTeX: segfault when using strechy math characters and <unicode-math>.

Really sorry to hear it.  Does not crash for me on i386-linux, so I
suppose it is another 64-bit-related bug.  Will report to Thanh and
Jonathan.  Won't be fixed for this release :(.

Karl

I can't reproduce this problem.

Can you send us the output somehow?  Please send us compressed files
in order to prevent "smart" mail software from re-encoding them.

If you still have an older version of TeX Live on your system, can you
send us the output of tlmgr --help you get on this system too?

The output of the commands below is quite helpful too:

  locale
  set | grep LESS

Regards,
  Reinhard

Reinhard,


    * tlmgr --help: The TeX Live Manager uses "less" to display the help
      text. In the new version, it shows some wired escape sequences. 

I can reproduce it on tug.org, ssh'd in with a plain old xterm, locale
settings all POSIX.  I run:
$ (unset LESS; unset LESSOPEN; tlmgr help)

And it says:
"/tmp/OWdfETYIXZ" may be a binary file.  See it anyway?

And I type "y" and and what I see is the attached screenshot, full of
ESC sequences.

If I just hit RET instead of typing "y" to the binary file question, it
displays correctly.

If I set PAGER=more (which gets /bin/more), it displays correctly.

Both /bin/less and /usr/local/gnu/bin/less on tug have the same wrong
behavior.

I don't know when I'll have a chance to really look into it.  If you
feel like it, so much the better.

Thanks,
karl

No, it's not _another_ 64-bit related bug. It's probably the same bug
I reported here last month, which was already too late to fix by then.

As a workaround, I would suggest to install the 32-bit XeTeX binary
as a replacement for the broken 64-bit version.

Regards, Ulrik.

P.S: Besides the 64-bit issue, there are a few more known bugs on
XeTeX with OpenType math, that will need to be fixed in the engine,
but those should not be architecture-specific.

Hi.

 

I've installed TexLive 2009 on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 server. It built successfully using configure, make and make install. However, when a client runs a Latex program, it gives the following:

 

~/testLatex:latex utf8test.tex

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.4.5)

(./utf8test.tex

I believe the make check also gave this utf8.def error. I have no idea what to do with this as I'm a sys admin and don't know anything about this product. The client says he needs this fixed. I install TexLive under /usr/local/. There is a utf8.def file under /usr/local/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/utf8.def. Can you please tell me what's wrong or how we can fix this?

 

Thank you.

Yes, but your are running latex from /usr/bin/latex which is the 
distribution TeX ... otherwise it would not search for in /usr/share/texmf/..

As a Unix sysadmin you should know about PATH issues ... the problem is
probably that /usr/local/2009/... (BTW, why did you remove the "texlive"
part, normally it is /usr/local/texlive/2009/?!?) is where you installed
everything, so the binaries are in
	/usr/local/2009/bin/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE/
and this has to be added *BEFORE* the other latex in the PATH setting.

Best wishes

This is exactly what I'm seeing, too. I noticed this morning that it happens only when I do "sudo tlmgr --help", i.e. as root. As a normal user it works as expected.

To be more precise:

$ sudo tlmgr --help
"/tmp/XXXXXX" may be a binary file.  See it anyway?

and then typing "y" shows the help page with escape sequences.

$ sudo tlmgr --help
"/tmp/XXXXXX" may be a binary file.  See it anyway?

and typing <enter> shows the help page without escape sequences, but line brakes are wrong.

$ tlmgr --help

shows everything ok.

Best,
Markus

Subject: [tex-live] TeX4ht does not work properly with default TeXLive
	Windows install
Message-ID: <A457AE0EC669934B985DC973A9B1B16D040E6CE0@EVS3.aecl.ca>

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Since I am sending this to both the TeX4ht and the TeXLive lists, I will summarize.
 
On installation of TeXLive, I did a "hello world" test of TeX4ht,
which did not work properly when executing htlatex test.
The all files were generated properly EXCEPT the .png files.
After some deliberation on the TeX4ht mailing and some helpful
hints from various participants, I found out that what was
missing was the presence of ImageMagic and Ghostscript, as outline below...
 
As suggested, I downloaded and installed ImageMagick,
and made sure the install is in the path using the suggested installation test.
 
Re-running with the original tex4ht.env, or even modifying it as suggested
did not produce the required png files.
 
Then I noticed that ImageMagick uses ghostscript.
I had ghostscript installed, but it was not in the path by default in Windows,
so I added it, and also made sure that I had the latest version of ghostscript loaded,
since my relatively old version was not able to produce png files,
and re-ran, and lo and behold, there were the required .png files,
just a pretty as can be.  Everything now displayed as expected.
 
The conclusion: TeX4ht requires the installation of ImageMagic, which in turn
requires the installation of ghostscript, both of which are not available
by default on a Windows machine, and which are not installed by default
when TeXLive is installed.  Both are required to be on the path, which may
require some manual tweaking of the path for ghostscript.
 
The upshot is that, TeX4ht does not work properly by default when TeXLive is installed
on a windows system.  I assume that virtually all *nix systems have both
ImageMagic and ghostscript/ghostview installed by default, so there never was a problem
on this class of system, but I have trouble believing that I am the first or only person
to try using TeX4ht on a windows system.  Were there never any complaints about this?
 
Is there any way around this?
I'm not sure, but the maintainers of TeXLive and TeX4ht might want to discuss...

In any case, I'm just as happy as can be that I know what the problem is
and can go off in a corner and play around with TeX4ht!

Thanks for your help everyone!
 
Thomas

Yes, that is something we cannot change and we will not change. We cannot
provide ImageMagic, that is far far out of bounds for TeX Live.

I would suggest installing a decent operating system ;-)

> Is there any way around this?

Yes, install ghostscript and imagemagick on Windows.

It might be useful to post a note on tex4ht or in the docs of tex4ht
that on windows machines bla bla bla is necessary. Maybe it is already
there mentioned somewhere.

Yes, but both provide the "convert" utility which is needed, right?

On a cursory glance at texmf-dist/tex4ht/base/win32/tex4ht.env it
would appear that creating .png files shouldn't require the convert
util at all, only GS is needed.

We include GS with TL, so it shouldn't be necessary to install it.  It
is not available outside of TL (it is hidden), but our tools are
started through a wrapper that puts GS on the path for them.  So, if
the convert util from ImageMagick is started by tex4ht, gswin32c.exe
should be already on the path or something is malfunctioning.

Cheers,

Tomek

Thanks, Norbert. I actually noticed the path issue yesterday after
posting it. I didn't realize the client was running the /usr/bin/latex
rather than the one under /usr/local/texlive (yes, I forgot textlive in
the /usr/local path in my initial post). Thanks for taking the time to
respond.

what to do with this as I'm a sys admin and don't know anything about
this product. The client says he needs this fixed. I install TexLive
under /usr/local/. There is a utf8.def file under
/usr/local/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/utf8.def. Can you please tell
me what's wrong or how we can fix this?


Yes, but your are running latex from /usr/bin/latex which is the 
distribution TeX ... otherwise it would not search for in
/usr/share/texmf/..

As a Unix sysadmin you should know about PATH issues ... the problem is
probably that /usr/local/2009/... (BTW, why did you remove the "texlive"
part, normally it is /usr/local/texlive/2009/?!?) is where you installed
everything, so the binaries are in
	/usr/local/2009/bin/YOUR_ARCHITECTURE/
and this has to be added *BEFORE* the other latex in the PATH setting.

Best wishes

Sorry, there is no attachment, only the string "[ATTACHMENT

But I can reproduce the problem with:

   (unset LESS; unset LESSOPEN; tlmgr help)

The escape sequences you see on screen are probably ANSI colors.
less(1) doesn't pass them to the terminal by default.

Could you set the environment variable

  LESS='-R'

and try again?

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Interesting replies up to now.

Norbert seems to feel that a manual install of the other software is required, and that
these packages should not be installed by TeXLive 2009.  This is the answer I expected
given the philosophical leaning of the TeXLive install.  Don't get me wrong,
I understand why this should be so.

Tomek on the other hand seems to feel that perhaps gs is all that's really needed to
have TeX4ht working properly, and points out that it is in fact already provided
with the install, albeit hidden.

My own question is a more general one.  If the TeXLive distribution provides a certain
package like TeX4ht, should this package not work out of the box without further
user intervention requiring the installation of other packages?
Given the needs of TeX4ht, and the restrictions imposed on the TeXLive install,
is it possible to provide a fully working TeX4ht with the TeXLive install at this time?

Tomek is our Windows Master, so if he says so I trust him. But from what
I udnerstood and read in the tex4ht docs on quick glance is that it
uses convert, and if "convert" is not installed, and it is shipped
by *Magick then it will not work.

That would be nice, but there are limits of what we can do. We do not
and will not provide a full operating environment.

We tried to fix that for many programs requiring ghostscript by including
a hidden copy of it. But this is already a pain. Adding more and more
programs seems not to be a feasable option for me.

Perhaps there's something can be done then, but it sounds like some
development and testing would be needed.  Here's hoping!

You also make very productive hidden use of Perl I believe.
In any case, the TeX4ht package managers will have to chime in.
Who's "responsible" for TeX4ht right now?
I'm fully intending on stress testing the package with some
reasonably heavy documentation in the near future, and I suspect
I'll be running across certain weaknesses...

In some configurations graphicsmagick provides a wrapper "gm" so
you may need to run "gm convert" instead of just "convert".   This
can be handled  by editing tex4ht.env.

It needs to made clear when parts of TeX Live are not "ready-to-run" without
additional configuration.   Maybe there could be dummy packages that serve
to highlight the configuration steps needed to use ConTeXt MkIV and tex4ht.

You can set the path for gsXX.exe in tex4ht.env, but that won't help
ImageMagick's "convert" find gs.

If the tools were configured to use 'tlgs' then dummy packages could install
trivial wrappers of the form:

$ cat /usr/bin/texlive/2020/bin/<arch>/tlgs

#! /bin/sh
# tlgs -- wrapper to notify users that they need to install gs or
# edit this script to set "realgs" as required
realgs=$(which gs)
if [ "${realgs}X" == "X" ] ; then
  echo 'Please install ghostscript or edit the tlgs script to set the
value of realgs.'
  exit 1
else
  exec "$realgs" "$@"
fi



> I'm not sure, but the maintainers of TeXLive and TeX4ht might want to discuss...

There have been discussions in the past, and ghostscript has been
included in some
windows distros, including MiKTeX, where you see people encountering problems
because they have a .ps or .pdf file that works with a current gs but
not the older
version provided in a perhaps old MiKTeX.

MacTeX does provide ghostscript, and calls it 'mgs'.

There is nothing to prevent repackaging CTAN TeXLive for Windows to include
ghostscript and ImageMagick.

Cygwin or a VM running linux allow Windows machines to run TeX Live with
3rd party tools.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Gah.  And here we are with the hand tweaking again.
Norbert's going to jump all over me again, I'm sure,
but one of the things I always liked about Eitan's approach
to TeX4ht is the "just use it, it should take care of everything
automatically" approach.  Code developers we need to remember
that their users are not developers.  All they really want is for the
install to work so they can get on with what they really want to do...

This is where the MAC really wins fans.  They are running unix underneath,
but the user never really knows it.  And from what I hear, they are
gaining ground with this approach.
(see http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/08/07/1744223/Microsoft-Losing-Big-To-Apple-On-Campus)
Besides, MAC also is renowned for its low latency.  Also very important.

Sorry, I'm drifting here...

Thomas

Yes, they don't have to know ... until it breaks, and then they are lost.

And it breaks, I can tell you, working myself partly on Mac...

MacTeX does provide ghostscript, but it's news to me that it renames it to mgs.  Are you sure about that?  

MacTeX also provides a partial ImageMagick (only the `convert` binary, IIRC) for TeX4ht.

Oops -- I was thinking of MiKteX's 'mgs'.

In the case of Windows, it didn't start with gs as the problem.
It was convert that wasn't working at first, and in that case,
it would be very difficult to tell what's going on in Windows,
because windows already has a convert command in dos.
In that case you're hooped, because something executes, it's
just the wrong something!

Maybe TeX Live could set a good example by using namespaces,
and rather than invoking "Convert", invoke (say) "TL.Convert".
Possible ?

It won't help either because ImageMagick contains convert, not
"TL.Convert". It will just cause another mystery because installation
of missing ImageMagick will not help.

TeX Live doesn't rename 3rd party programs, it hides them. ;)

    Who's "responsible" for TeX4ht right now?

Read http://tug.org/tex4ht.

CVR and I need more developers who are willing to delve into the
mysteries of tex4ht!  We both have a "few" other things to do.  Posting
bug reports is all to the good, but don't expect instant resolutions to
knotty problems when the two of us are all there are.

Please send further mail about tex4ht just to tex4ht at tug.org, not
tex-live.  Since I'm on that list, I'll be able to handle any TL issues
that come up.

Sorry, my mistake.

    The escape sequences you see on screen are probably ANSI colors.

Yep.

    less(1) doesn't pass them to the terminal by default.

Yep.

     LESS='-R'

It works, and no question about binary characters any more either.  But
people shouldn't have to set envvars to see the help.  It seems like a
bug in perldoc, or something.  The whole "y" vs. "RET" thing seems
pretty bogus, too.

I suppose we could add -R to the LESS envvar in tlmgr before calling
pod2usage.  What a kludge, but if it suffices ...

I think that less(1) is the culprit.

Yes, but we should also unset LESSOPEN.

There is an idiom: "less is sometimes more".  Sure, but less(1) does
too much.  I once created a file "foo.ps" and "less foo.ps" didn't
display the content of the file.  Instead, it bothered me with a bunch
of ghostscript error messages.  Sigh!

I added the line

  unset LESSOPEN

to /etc/bashrc

and didn't encounter such problems anymore.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] asy & texmf v texmf-local
Message-ID: <376418F8-42F7-422A-9FE3-293A7DB17B9D@gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a small problem when updating asy from source on top of TL2010 pretest (via MacTeX, perhaps not quite the last one that was released).

In my pre-test of TL2010, asymptote's style file is kept in 

    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

but when I compile asy from source, it puts its file (correctly, it seems to me) in

    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-local/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

(This is newer than the TL2010 one.)

Unfortunately, running `kpsewhich -show-path=.sty` and trimming all but the last three terms shows the problem:

!!/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex///:
!!/usr/local/texlive/2010/../texmf-local/tex///:
!!/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex///

The TL-installed asymptote.sty is found before the texmf-local one, which isn't very friendly. What should be happening here? While asymptote.sty isn't its own package on CTAN, should asymptote be installing it (from source) in the texmf/ rather than the texmf-local directory? Or should the order of the paths above in texmf.cnf be adjusted so texmf-local is found first?

Thanks,
-- Will

As you know, I'm no expert, but a regular user... But from my point of view, if asymtote wants to install itself in texmf-local directory, it should be in

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

that is, year-distribution independent, and not create a texmf-local inside .../2010


Best,

Axel

Some things need to be clarified, the following is my interpretation:
- because asymptote.sty and the binaries are closely linked, the .sty
  file resides in texmf, not texmf-dist, so that it is *not* overridden
  by a texmf-local file
- those who actually *compile* a new asymptote should be apt enough to
  understand that they have to replace the texmf/asymptote.sty file
- the install process of the asymptote package assumes that there

No, it is found *before* texmf-dist but *after* texmf, and that is fine.

Both added to the todo list after the repository is open again.

On a side node: LESSOPEN is *very* useful, a simple 
	less foo.tar.gz
	less bla.rar
etc is quite nice. But I agree sometimes lesspipe is sometimes overdoing it.

Oops, sorry; that was a typo on my part. The location is:

    /usr/local/texlive/2010/../texmf-local/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

which is equivalent to

    /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

So it is indeed year-independent.

Okay, that seems sensible. (I was just checking this order was definitely intentional.)

Hmmm. From my point of view, it would be better if asymptote.sty was part of texmf-dist -- i.e., if it were a stand-alone CTAN package. (I'll talk to John about that but I won't hold my breath.)

I'm not very comfortable with writing a script to locate asymptote.sty correctly -- it seems like it will be a fragile process and I don't have the resources for testing it widely. For now, I think, I'll simply recommend that users compiling asy from source need to delete their TL-installed copies of asymptote.sty.

Thanks for the advice,
-- Will

I have two asymptote.sty

/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty


and the second one is installed by asymptote. Methink it should be
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-local/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty


I copying this message to John Bowman who can either clarify things or
change installer behaviour

Hi,

Since John has presumably missed the beginning of this short thread, I'll recap quickly:

In TeX Live, asymptote's style file is kept in 

   /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

but when I compile asy from source, it puts its file (correctly, it seems to me) in

   /usr/local/texlive/2010/../texmf-local/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

Unfortunately, the TL-installed asymptote.sty is found before the texmf-local one in the search path, and I was asking the best way to resolve this situation (since it would be nice if the source-installed copy was found first by default).

Norbert reckons that asymptote.sty belongs in 2010/texmf/ since it's tied to the engine, which seems sensible to me. While the source makefile could install asymptote.sty over the top of the TL version (i.e., replacing it), this would require the makefile to check if TL is being used, etc., which isn't fun.

I don't think there's any easy solution to this problem beyond saying "if you compile from source you need to remove the TL-installed asymptote.sty".

-- Will

P.S.  Perhaps I'm exaggerating the frustrations of checking for TL in the makefile. The configure script has

if test "x$kpsewhich" = "xtrue"; then
  latexdir=`kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFLOCAL'/tex/latex`
else
  latexdir=$prefix/share/texmf/tex/latex
...

Is there a suitable test so you could write instead

if <TL2009 or TL2010 or greater but not teTeX nor MiKTeX>
  latexdir=`kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFMAIN'/tex/latex`
else
  <the test above>

?

On reflection I think any scheme that relies on wrappers is doomed to
fail -- there are too many places where ghostscript is invoked,
different names on different platforms (gswin32c on Windows), and
the names are already coded in many places, including 3rd party
tools such as convert.

There are also problems with providing 3rd party tools.   One of the
issues with MiKTeX's ghostscript is that users may have a separate
install of ghostscript with added fonts, so eps files using these fonts
without embedding can be viewed/converted using the separate
ghostscript, but not by MiKTeX's version.

In my view, the biggest issue is how to make it clear to end users that
"some configuration is required".  Recent examples are ConTeXt
MkIV (user needs to run "luatools --generate") and tex4ht (user
needs to ensure "*Magick::convert" is available and can find the
a suitable ghostscript).   Dummy packages could serve to document
the packages that depend on 3rd party tools, and could be replaced
with real packages on platforms (mac, windows) where the tools
are not widely available.

It should also be possible to  provide (architecture dependent)
"tlbug" scripts similar to perlbug or octave-bug that would include
checks for 3rd party tools.   The script should be designed to be
run by the end user in order to document issues with the user's
environment, but unlike scripts designed purely for reporting
bugs, they should be written in a way that will help users
resolve configuration/setup issues before reporting them as
bugs.

These checks should be "modular", so when tex4ht
is installed the checks for ghostscript and convert are enabled,
and when ConTeXt is installed a check for whether "luatools --generate"
has been run, etc.

Management of 3rd party tools is out of scope for us.

Easier said then done.  For example, how can I check whether "luatools
--generate" has been run?  Or whether installed ghostscript has the
right fonts?  These kind of things are very package/tool specific and
often tend to be fragile and change over time.  Who's going to write
all these checks and keep maintaining and testing them as things
change?  Your suggestion sounds nice in theory but I don't think it
would work out in practice.

Cheers,

Tomek

I can sympathize with your plight.  You are trying to provide access
to all the great tools and packages that have been developed, but some of
them, like TeX4ht require other third-party packages to be available.
It was particularly difficult for TeX4ht because the documentation
takes a "just use it, it'll work fine!" attitude, which, quite honestly,
I like, but if something is a little "different", it can lead to my
sort of questions.  I'm hoping that at least this current thread
of discussion will alert future Windows users that there's
something more that's needed and what can be done about it.

The goal should be to ensure that the version of asymptote.sty matches
the program.  You omit to mention whether you also installed a
binary.  In any case, my recipe for this sort of messing around:

create bin/<arch>-t and texmf-t directories

put bin/<arch>-t just before bin/arch in the PATH
adjust texmf.cnf to put texmf-t before texmf, e.g.:

I find it very convenient to have such "test" trees available.

With the right framework the checks can be improved over time by
the people whose packages need the tools.    Also, there are many
of us whose code is owned by our employers who can't contribute
non-trivial code but can provide "small" patches and bug fixes to
open source projects, so the potential list of contributors is much
larger.

For the luatools question, one test would be to see if
"luatools --find-file mtx-context.lua" returns a non-empty
string.   It isn't perfect (and luatools appears to have
failure modes we don't yet understand), but failure could
be linked to a message "have you run luatools --generate?"
which should get the majority of new users headed in the
right direction.

I suppose this has to be done in perl or maybe lua so it
will run on all the platforms.

If you install your own new asymptote, you could put your own new
asymptote.sty under TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty.  (Or
TEXMF{,SYS}{CONFIG,VAR} -- but none of those seem like good choices.)

    makefile could install asymptote.sty over the top of the TL version
    (i.e., replacing it), 

It seems conceptually wrong to me to do this.  Does the asy makefile
install the asy binary in .../bin/i386-linux?

We can already specify an arbitrary code to run (either an executable
or a perl/lua script) on per package basis for install and removal.
So the plumbing is already in place.  Whether this is the right
solution, I'm still not convinced.

TeX4ht is almost of necessity a kludge, but tex4ht.env
contains several methods to convert dvi fragments into
png files, one of which seems to require only dvipng and
one (commented out in Windows) seems to require only GS.

The documentation seems to say that an option like " -cdvipng"
would select the dvipng method.

I've never used dvipng, nor tex4ht, so I can't say if this or the
GS-only method works in TeXLive as distributed.

Well, no, but there doesn't seem to be a good system-wide place (hence not TEXMFHOME) in TL to put the asymptote.sty file. Unless 

!!/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex///           TEXMF
!!/usr/local/texlive/2010/../texmf-local/tex///

were swapped. But since they are in that order by design (and as documented in texmf.cnf), I don't think there's anything we can do about it.

My proposed solution would be to change the configure script in Asymptote to first check for and use
    `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFMAIN`
then try 
    `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL`
and then fall back to the old method of
    `$prefix/share/texmf/tex/latex`
but I can't imagine that one works very often :)

On the other hand, just deleting the TL-installed asymptote.sty isn't too big of a deal, so the current situation is probably fine.

If you manually overwrite the version of asymptote.sty that ships with TL,
it seems to me that you should also manually overwrite the corresponding
asy binary file.

If instead you let configure install asy to /usr/local/bin
and you put /usr/local/bin in $PATH before /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin,
then you should also do the same with asymptote.sty, putting

/usr/local/texlive/2010/../texmf-local/tex/latex
before
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/latex

in $TEXINPUTS. This allows you to select between two different versions of
asy and its corresponding style file on the same system, as long as you keep
$PATH and $TEXINPUTS in sync.

Does this seem reasonable?

Not to the TL team, I think. I'd prefer not to touch texmf.cnf if at all possible.

I have to admit to not telling the whole story here. I'm trying to put together a script to compile Asymptote that takes care of its dependencies on Mac OS X, using the Homebrew packaging system. (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ for those who care to look.)

I'm fine with just adding a caveat to the install script saying "remove the TL version of asymptote.sty before continuing", but any solution I use must be generic.

However, I don't even know if this project will accept this script ("formula" in their parlance) since it requires a TeX distribution to compile the source. So before taking any drastic action I think we should wait and see what they say.

FWIW, the script is attached if you'd like to take a look. I suspect it's only of interest to Mac users.

  def caveats
    caveats = <<-EOS
1) If you are installing Asymptote on top of a TeX Live system (e.g., and most
   commonly, with MacTeX 2009 or 2010), you will need to move or remove the
   standard asymptote.sty package. For example,
   
       rm /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/asymptote/asymptote.sty

   If you do not do this, the new version of asymptote.sty installed with this
   new version of Asymptote will not be used in your LaTeX documents. Errors
   will probably result as a consequence of this.

2) Because brew installs asymptote without super-user privileges, the command
   `texhash` to update the TeX filename database has not been run. If this is
   your first time installing asymptote from source, you will (probably) not
   be able to use the `asymptote` package in LaTeX without first running

       sudo texhash

3) If you wish to use xasy, run the following command to install the Python
   Imaging Library (PIL):
   
       easy_install http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz

You should choose one of the following:
1. you either use full TL with all it (old, not updated,...) utlities, or
2. compile some utilities by yourself but _remove_ apropriate packages
  from TL.

I choose the second way. Some time ago I tried to live with TL texworks
& asy but also compiled and installed them using my distro utility but
this, of course, failed (bad interactions). So I simply delete
apropriate packages from TL and all works fine.

Note however, that in the second case the responsibility to update
software is on your side. So you have to watch if software you manually
install is updated.

Also consider the following situation: you update asymptote and force it
to put sty file into 'texmf' tree but asy binary to /usr/local/bin .
Then suppose that TL updates asymptote package and overwrites sty file
(not bad because the versions are the same) but then TL
update asymptote again (or you forgot that you also have manually
installed asymptote package) and then you going into trouble: version
mismatch.

A newer version may be needed because the one from TL is buggy or because
your colleague is using some feature from the new version in a document
on which you are coauthor.

This approach can run afoul of dependencies.   With some package managers
there is a way to create dummy packages to deal with this.

3.  arrange things so allow switching between the old and new versions.  For
binaries you can do this by choosing suitable directories and
adjusting the PATH,
but for texmf things you have to create a new tree and adjust texmf.cnf.

4.  on platforms that support hard links, just copy using "cp -lr" of
CTAN texlive
to a new location and overwrite the existing files with the new versions.  The
you only need to adjust the PATH to switch between the standard and modified
TL versions.

Such mismatched version are one of the top sources of problems for our
TeX users, although more often caused by someone copying file that belongs
in a texmf tree into the document directory.

You may want to have both versions available -- new to check
compatibility of existing
documents/templates before users start encountering problems or
because you need a
bug fix/feature in the new version, and old because you have
multi-author projects where
the other authors use the old version.

however  /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/latex/ still contains
obsolete  asymptote directory and it take a precedence over a correct

solves the problem

BTW, /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/tex/latex/ contains also

Everything that is under texmf/tex is there because I thought it was the

I think it's better if the name "afm2pl" is replaced by the name of
the package which provides the file afm2pl/uclcptm.sty.

Otherwise one has to reverse-engineer.  The file itself doesn't
contain any information about its origin or its license.

Where does it come from?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

I'm trying to build a package from the gentoo ebuild and eclasses. I'm
not using gentoo, I just follow the codes and the bash scripts in the
eclasess. I've installed successful all the necessary modules and files.
But I've have problem, which I've tried to explain below.

As the subject said, i can't run latex. I've tried several things
wihtout any success. Below you see the error output, after that you will
see the command's that I execute and the following outputs of this
execution.

I guess it has something to do with TEXINPUTS variables. Actually there
are no variables set. I guess that's why fmtutil doesn't work at all.
Should i set some variables and the try to install texlive from scratch ? I
guess that these empty variables causes the system not to create the
.fmt files.

What should I do ? 

Thanks in advance

How should we help you there? Why would you do that instead
of using TeX Live as it is?

Anyway, lets try:


> //etc/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
> file: http://cekirdek.pardus.org.tr/~farslan/fmtutil.cnf

That file looks strange, is moved TEXMFSYSVAR and TEXMFSYSCONFIG
to
	/usr/var/lib/texmf
and
	/usr/etc/texmf
respectively (if the binaries are in /usr/bin).

Can you call
	kpsewich  -debug=-1 plain.tex
and the you might study the output, what are the search paths
etc etc.

It should give you some information.

But in genereal we do *NOT* support any private homebrewn or
whatever build and restructuring of the texmf trees. When
I (Debian hat on) get a bug report about these kind of
things I have to sort it out myself, as this is not the
way TeX Live proper is shipped.

Best

Norbert

Gentoo indeed has config files in /etc/texmf.  I currently don't have
Gentoo's TL installed.  But I had no problems with any environment
vars in the past, so I assume that there are symlinks in the
/usr/share/texmf* trees pointing to these files.

A reason latex.ini isn't found might be that dev-texlive/texlive-latex
is missing.

I also strongly recommend to use the official TL release instead of
reverse-engineering Gentoo.

  Reinhard

This does not sound like an easy thing to do -- is there a reason not to
use CTAN texlive?

Normally the TEX... variables are not set in the shell but by
loading texmf.cnf in the tex-related programs.
You should use kpathsea debugging to see what is really
going on.

What is you want to accomplish?  If you just want to get a current TeX
system (and have internet access), there are easier methods.

Thanks all for the comments. I have developed something of a compromise, which will work for most users and does not require any changes to how TL or Asymptote do their thing. Read on if you're interested in what that solution is.

My installation script lets the Asymptote makefile do its thing, installing the asymptote.sty file (and others) into TEXMFLOCAL. At this stage, they are currently not found by kpsewhich since the TEXMFDIST files are found earlier. I then symlink the TEXMFLOCAL files into TEXMFHOME for the current user, and spit out a message telling the user that this should be repeated on any other accounts necessary.

When the script is incorporated into the homebrew system, installing Asymptote from source is a matter of running `brew install asymptote` and waiting a few minutes for the compilation.

I can't find the format file `mptopdf.fmt'!

MPtoPDF 1.3.3 : logo.1 is converted to logo-1.pdf

---- error message end

And logo-1.pdf is not created.

It appears that somehow, MSYS interferes with my TeX Live install, and
the search
path is prefixed with "/msys/1.0".
Please help!

BJ.

Please check whether TeX related environment variables are set whithin
the MSYS environment.  There shouldn't be any.  Try:

   set | grep -i TEX

I just wanted to add a tiny bit of not really important information -
mptopdf always used to report success until recently even if there has
been a problem in conversion. This has been fixed, but it won't ever
get changed in TL 2009.

When you move from an Msys process to a windows process, Msys tries to
adjust environment vars that look
like paths from "Msys" to "Windows" locations.  This certainly seems
to be what you are seeing.   Are you running
an Msys shell program?

I didn't encounter something like this on the MSYS version I installed
two or three years ago.  I ran TeX and Perl in an MSYS environment.
TeX Live doesn't set environment variables, so nothing unexpected
should happen.  But ActivePerl sets PERL5LIB and it worked without any
problems too.  Seems that you have a newer version of MSYS.  I don't
have access to the Windows machine anymore.  If newer versions of MSYS
really behave as you describe, I suspect they are buggy.

I don't know what "move from an Msys process to a windows process"
means exactly and I can't check myself.  The PATH variable seems to be
intact when a "Windows process" is called:

> Running the command c:\texlive\2009\bin\win32\fmtutil.exe

This program is invoked indeed because the message

> warning: kpathsea: configuration file texmf.cnf not found [...]

can't come from the shell.  If MSYS invokes external programs with a
broken environment, then kpathsea's debug facilities should provide
more information.

A quick and easy test to find out whether the problem is MSYS or TeX
Live related is to install Ghostscript.  The command

  gswin32c -help

prints the search paths to screen.  They depend on the env vars GS_LIB
and GS_FONTS.  Hence, if it's an MSYS issue, you should get different
results when you invoke the command from the MS-DOG command line and
from MSYS.

In this case it's best to consult the MSYS developer(s?).  As said
before, I didn't encounter any such problems with a two or three year
old release of MSYS.  The bug must be introduced recently.

Another thing comes to my mind: As I said before, the TeX Live
installer doesn't set any environment variables.  However, versions
older than TL-2008 set TEXMFCNF.  If there is such a leftover from an
older TL installation, everything is condemned to fail, even if you
run programs from the MS-DOG command line.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for the link.  MSYS seems to be broken indeed.

What I don't understand is why people prefer to expose their
complaints so loudly in the internet instead of simply inform the
author about the problem.  The bug can probably be fixed easily if the
author is aware of it.  Seems that they aren't interested in a bugfix.
Yeah, we all like people who only complain.

  Reinhard

On the contrary, your argument means that renaming is doomed to fail, but not
wrappers. What the wrappers do is set the path so that the external tools (GS &
Perl for now) become "visible" with their natural name. Since path is inherited,
tools called by the wrapped script will see the 3rd party tools.

Sure. That's what documentation is for :-)

The problem is, users have to know about this tool in the first place, so
documentation is needed again. Moreover, I'm not sure even the best tool can do
more than tell users to read the appropriate documentation about what to install
and how.

If I try the following on Windows command line

    set | grep -i tex

I get

    C:\Ruby191\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Python27\;C:\Program
Files (x86)\Mercurial\;C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\;C:\Program
Files (x86)\Pandoc\bin;C:\gnuplot\binary\;C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32;C:\MinGW\bin\;C:\msys\1.0\bin\

This is exactly what the PATH environment variable on my Windows 7
system is set to.
Does it help?

FYI, the same command under MSYS shell returns

    PATH='.:/usr/local/bin:/mingw/bin:/bin:/c/Ruby191/bin:/c/Windows/system32:/c/Windows:/c/Windows/System32/Wbem:/c/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/:/c/Python27/:/c/Program

SHELLOPTS=braceexpand:emacs:hashall:histexpand:history:interactive-comments:monitor:posix

But, I encountered the problem when I was running mptopdf in Windows
command line.

No, I was running it in Windows command.
But, I get the same error messages if I run the command under MSYS shell.

I don't know if it will be of any help, but my setup is as follows:
I have: TeX Live 2009, GnuWin32 make, and MinGW/MSYS installed. The versions
of MinGW/MSYS is not the latest ones but those provided as automated installers.
I draw figures with MetaPost, and the final pdf file is created using
"make" from
LaTeX and MetaPost source files. In the makefile, the myfigure.mp file
is converted
to myfigure.1 and then myfigure-1.pdf to be included in the final document.

BJ

In fact, I did not have this problem before, either. My other old computer has
TeX Live + MinGW/MSYS and I don't have this problem on it. (I want to
retire the old system soon.) My old system has

      TeX Live 2008 + MinGW/MSYS

and MinGW/MSYS was installed from the latest induvidual packages at
the time of installation (around June 2009).

I think the problem started when I installed TeX Live 2009 + MinGW/MSYS.
First I tried

   TeX Live 2009
   +
   MinGW/MSYS (manual installation, latest indivudual packages, early 2010)

and I got the error. Later, on a freshly installed Windows 7 system, I tried

   TeX Live 2009
   +
   MinGW/MSYS (using automated installers, which were several years old)

and the error persists.

So, I wonder if the problem is with TeX Live?

I installed Ghostscript 8.71 and run the command from Windows command

As I mentioned above, I did not have the problem with TL-2008.
So, is there any chance my problem is the result of not setting
TEXMFCNF?

As an experiment,
1. I created and set an environment variable TEXMFCNF to
    "C:\texlive\2009\texmf\web2c", where texmf.cnf is located.
2. and ran the command: mptopdf logo.1

Interestingly, I got a similar error message but with a much shorter
list of directories kpathsea tried as follows:

    warning: kpathsea: configuration file texmf.cnf not found in these
directories:
    C;C:/msys/1.0/texlive/2009/texmf/web2c.

As shown above, kpathsea tried only the directory defined by TEXMFCNF, but
the path is wrong because it is prefixed by "/msys/1.0".

So, defining TEXMFCNF doesn't seem to solve the problem.

I am not versed in UNIX enough to understand the blog entry.

But, even assuming MSYS has a problem, I still don't understand why
this is hapenning. mptopdf is not an MSYS application. If I did not have
MSYS installed, I would not be having this problem. Am I wrong?

The UNIX part is that $PATH lacks drive letters and uses forward slashes.
MSYS works with "/bin" which Windows knows as "C:\msys-NN\bin".

Please post your results for the two perl examples from the blog.  There is a
basic perl provided by TL2010, but it may be that some other perl is being
used.

It isn't that MSYS has a problem, it is that normal MSYS "features"
are mistakenly being applied to the variables used internally to
pass TeX Live's directory structure between TeX Live programs.

Your symptoms certainly appear to be caused by MSYS path
munging.   Now that I can run linux in a VM I have stopped using
MSYS and Windows TL, so it is up to you to figure out how MSYS
is getting involved here.   The top suspects are a command shell
(sh.exe or bash.exe) and perl.   I don't know if TeX Live on Windows
uses any MSYS .dll's, but I think MSYS provides some mechanism
to control the PATH munging, so another possibility is that your
environment somehow conflicts with the settings needed by TeX Live.

Happy bug hunting.

In an earlier message you said you were running make.
Depending on the Makefile, it is quite possible that it
shells out to bash, which almost surely is an MSYS program.

Judging from PATH, you probably have no special version of Perl
installed, so it is quite possible that Perl is being called from MSYS
and that one might mess up some paths.

A while ago I had a problem on computer where ruby was installed under
cygwin which prevented ConTeXt to work properly.

You may try two things (separately, not both at once):

- Before you install perl, remove all the msys-related variables from
PATH (Do you know how to set path in bash without having to mess with
system-wide settings?) My guess is that it might not work at all if
there's no perl installed.

- Install perl (you don't need to install it, it should be enough to
extract it to some folder) and make sure that path to "native perl"
comes before msys. It's quite possible that Perl gets installed with
TeX Live, so it might be enough to figure out where Perl was installed
and only set the path to see that folder.
