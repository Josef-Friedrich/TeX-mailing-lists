Subject: [tex-live] Inclusion of qpdf
Message-ID: <w2j68c491a61004010834jc5ecc35fibc890ab7fbb86d29@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
the more I use it, the more I want to see it included in TL2010.

<quote src="http://qpdf.sourceforge.net">
What is QPDF?

QPDF is a command-line program that does structural,
content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It could have been
called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful
capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who
just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how
they work.

QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as web-optimized)
files and encrypted files. It is also capable of converting PDF files
with object streams (also known as compressed objects) to files with
no compressed objects or to generate object streams from files that
don't have them (or even those that already do). QPDF also supports a
special mode designed to allow you to edit the content of PDF files in
a text editor. For more details, please see the documentation links
below.

QPDF is not a PDF content creation library, a PDF viewer, or a program
capable of converting PDF into other formats. In particular, QPDF
knows nothing about the semantics of PDF content streams. If you are
looking for something that can do that, you should look elsewhere.
However, once you have a valid PDF file, QPDF can be used to transform
that file in ways perhaps your original PDF creation can't handle. For
example, programs generate simple PDF files but can't password-protect
them, web-optimize them, or perform other transformations of that
type.
</quote>

qpdf is the only free program I know (I'm not counting pdfopt, as it
works quite different and needs gs) to be able to linearize (optimize
for web) PDF, which makes it quite interesting for us.

It's free (artistic license 2.0), there are already packages for
Debian/Ubuntu (but not for OpenSUSE), and the author is quite
responsive to bug reports.

Subject: [tex-live]  Tlmgr Is Auto-Installing Forcibly Removed Packages
Message-ID: <201004012208.o31M8Wpx028241@comp.uark.edu>


Hi:

This afternoon (2010/04/01, about 4pm CDT), when I ran
   tlmgr update --self
and
   tlmgr update --all
a large number (~120) of packages that I previously forcibly removed
were auto-installed.

I then ran
   tlmgr remove --force
on all those packages. Finally, as a test I ran
   tlmgr update --list
and it listed all the packages I had just forcibly removed.

Is this a bug, or should I be doing something (perhaps some
new option for "tlmgr update")?

Hmm, I cannot reproduce that in any way.

Can you send me your texlive.tlpdb in the state where packages are  
forcibly removed and would be reinstalled, and als tell me the output  
of tlmgr -v -version

Hello everyone!

The package biblatex-philosophy (v. 0.7) is available on CTAN since last March 30.
I've just updated TeX Live but the package biblatex-philosophy  is not in the list of the updated packages.
Is there any problem?

Thank you very much

Hi,
are you sure it has not been installed before? I just checked and found it on my system (TL 09) and I think I remember that it came with an update 2 weeks ago or so.

For interested windows users, I've built statically linked

Not fully tested.

Note that the directory structure is slightly different

Oh, I see. I'd assumed that everything was done more-or-less

Not everything can be done automatically.  There are scripts which
create TeX Live packages from packages on CTAN.  But these scripts
have to be adapted manually if, for instance, someone uploads a new
version of a particular package to CTAN with a modified directory
structure.

As far as MikTeX is concerned, some years ago I told Christian that a
new release of VnTeX is available.  He told me that he retrieved the
package from the TeX Live repository.  Sure enough, if MikTeX gathers
packages from the TeX Live repository rather than from CTAN,
everything can be done automatically.  And IMO this is the most
reasonable approach.

However, the hard task is to integrate packages from CTAN into TeX Live 
and this can't be done automatically.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Jindrich,

    The summary is pretty descriptive and it is done in today's state of
    the TeX Live repository. I hope it helps.

Thanks for forwarding it.

I hope you'll be able to report problems with the actual fonts to the
actual font maintainers, which is never us.  (Well, hardly ever ...)

For problems with the packaging (duplication, "font files in other
packages"), what we need are the actual files involved.  I can't tell
anything just from the package names.

Thanks again,
Karl

More precisely, 90% of the time, it isn't hard and can be done automatically.
Human intervention is needed for the other 10% (and those can be hard), but
actually for all packages, in order to make sure we are in the good case (which
the script can't detect).

Today's upgrade of TeX Live had niceverb, but there are problems

are unreadable.


It's probably due to a bad submission to CTAN.

Message-ID: <g2tfd3eb9bf1004050511nb3551c2bk37d92f938d6023b4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

there is a bug in beamer related to hyperref and PDF bookmarks: beamer
adds \section* and \subsection* to PDF bookmarks (but not to
\tableofcontents), and \subsection* appears empty; it would be much
more logical if it didn't add them at all.

Since beamer is no longer maintained, I'm posting this patch Heiko
sent me when I mailed him about it. It works; all you need to do is
put it into document preamble. It would be great if someone could
integrate this with beamer source (effectively replacing code that
doesn't work), so I'm CC'ing Karl and Vladimir who stepped up when
beamer's interaction with geometry had to be patched.

I looked at beamerbasesections.sty, but to actually integrate this fix
requires knowledge of LaTeX macros. The difference between lines 238
and 166 could be the reason why subsections appear empty, while
sections appear with a name.

Regards,

Vedran Mileti?

Howdy,

The new librarian package is missing its documentation, librarian-doc.pdf. And texdoc needs to be informed too, of course.

this is deliberate, since the documentation is non-free (licence nosource).

Subject: [tex-live] Ignoring portion of LaTeX code; the \par problem.
Message-ID: <87zl1j5dc3.fsf@cadilhac.name>

  Hi there everyone,

  My goal today is to write a command that would include another TeX
file, but not its document environment.  For instance, I would want to
use it like:

document.tex:
\documentclass{article}
% Lots of includes and configurations.
\begin{document}
  Text.
\end{document}

appendix.tex:
\usepreambleof{document.tex}
\begin{document}
  Other text.
\end{document}

  The goal there is to be able to move the appendix close to any
document.tex, and the appendix would take the form of the document.

  My first tries were focused on just ignoring code.  But while I had no
succeed in defining \document=\iffalse and \enddocument=\fi, for
whatever reason, I might have found some bugs on my way, seemingly
linked to TeXlive.

1- The \par problem.  I do understand that a \par may break the system
by which arguments are parsed.  But how come this gives me an error:

\def\ignore#1{}
\ignore{\string\par}

or even

\ignore{\let\par=\relax}

2- The ^L matter.  Let's use the \ignore command again, but without
\par's.  
\def\ignore#1{}
\ignore{one

  two}

Of course, the paragraph ended before \ignore was complete.  I then ask
for lines and spaces to be obeyed with \obeylines\obeyspaces.  Now,
let's add a ^L character (C-q C-l in Emacs), which is used, e.g., as a
marker in a file for Emacs.

\obeylines\obeyspaces
\def\ignore#1{}
\ignore{one

  two}

-> "Forbidden control sequence found while scanning use of \ignore."

If I add a \def^^L{}, everything works fine.  I'm just wondering why the
\obey* are not enough for that job.


Have a nice day.

You seem to have failed to read my preceding email.  Maybe you should
consider working on understanding basics of good communication -- see:

Better hint, Robin, my post wasn't any try to get help on such matter,
but to report an apparent bug.  Also, you may have had a look at the
"Subject" field of my message, which usually relates pretty good with
its contents: it mentions a problem with `\par', which you may have
addressed if you had tried to answer my email instead of trying to get
some potential newbie out.  Also, you may have found that my main point
was that the *parsing* (as in "mechanics") of the TeX file failed me.

You'd be kind enough not to answer again without having a look at my
first message.

You seem to have failed to read the subject of this list, see --
http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex-live, which says " This list is
devoted to the discussion of the development issues of the TeX Live
CD-ROM." Could you kindly, please, point to the "development issues of
the TeX Live CD-ROM" in your original message?

Dear Micha?l,

please *first* learn about TeX before insulting long term contributors
and people much more knowledgable than you on this list!!!

I think *YOU* missed the point in:
- knowing where to ask:
  is this a problem with TeX Live?`Did you try MikTeX, any other TeX
  implementation? You would have seen that it is always the same,
  because you seem to miss some core points of TeX.

> Better hint, Robin, my post wasn't any try to get help on such matter,

There is no apparent bug, there is only a misconception of yours.

The error message of TeX when rrunning on your "\par problem" is 
clear enough:
! Paragraph ended before \ignore was complete.
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
l.2 \ignore{\string\par
                       }
? 

You might look up how macro expansion in TeX works in the TeX book
or somewhere else.  But having \par in the argument unprotected
is not the best way.

And here Robin's remark comes in quite handy, even if you threw it away
with diguise: Look up code in other packages who have dealt with that
problem already...

> some potential newbie out.  Also, you may have found that my main point

Well, that is because TeX parsing is far from trivial.

I have myself no IDEA AT ALL how to write something like that, but I would
trust Robin's remark on where to look for a solution, instead of
bashing him.

And you could be so kind to excuse for your impoliteness, and check out
his suggestion.

Well, this is pretty clear: you need to specify either a list of packages, or
--all. Here I assume you want --all:

FYI, texdoc finds <name>-doc.pdf without needing to be informed (since version
0.60 at least).

Micha?l,

a few more hints:

- look for explanations about \long and the way TeX reads arguments before
processing them in your favourite book (the TeXbook is an obviously good choice,
"TeX by topic" too, and it's even free).

- if you're not sure whether something is a bug or a misunderstanding, first
assume that you didn't understand (especially if the software is TeX, which has
been stable for more than 20 years) and look for a confirmation in technical
forum (here, the texhax list and the Usenet group comp.text.tex are good choices)

- when a visibly knowledgeable and helpful contributor (it is clear from Robin's
signature that he is maintaining the TeX FAQ) replies, it is likely that what he
says makes sense.

We all make errors, what makes a difference is how we react when someone points
our errors out...

Manuel.

Unfortunately, no. Last checkin into
http://latex-beamer.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/latex-beamer/latex-beamer/
happened over two years ago. I don't know why he stopped maintained
it, but it doesn't matter; we should thank him for bringing it to a
state of such a powerful and bug-free package.

And, who knows, maybe someone else takes over the maintenance at some point.

The LPPL has a procedure for changing the maintainer; you should start
that process.

It's not relevant for this precise case, but for other packages whose
documentation is named <package>-doc.pdf rather than <package>.pdf, I just
wanted to point out that there is no need to "inform texdoc" in any special way
in general.

The place of bidi on CTAN has changed to
http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/bidi/

I would be grateful, when you update bidi, change its place from
/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/bidi to /tex/latex/bidi

This is because bidi is not any more just specific to XeTeX.

Thanks

Hi there Zdenek,

Well, I wasn't really searching for a /solution/ per se, to this
problem.  But an environment wouldn't do, as many command expect to be
executed in a "document" environment (which I would delete).  The use of
a command comes naturally, as no expansion is done on its arguments.

Have a nice day.

As previously demonstrated, I am no expert in the politics of TeX.  I
would have assumed that people maintaining the distribution were those
who maintain the source codes shipped with it as well.  If its not the
case, I may go see somewhere else without further due; but I would have
liked to see the problem I pointed discussed, so that I would know where
to go.

Free software is a common effort, and it doesn't help anyone when some
bearded guru answers by the aggressive when someone reports a bug.  (A
bug, not a query.)

Have a nice day.

That wasn't for the fun on insulting people.  I've been treated as a
burden in a situation where I only wanted to report some bug.  I
couldn't understand more colleagues saying that they wouldn't report bug
as it all seems pretty useless.

I'm willing to agree on that.  I'm a simple user trying to help.

Well, I wasn't going to try to solve that one problem in fact, I just
got to this point and was amazed to see that, however you protect \par
from being expanded, it still breaks the argument parsing.

Right.  I wrongly assumed that I knew how the parsing was mainly made.
The misleading bit is that when defining some token to be equal to \par,
using it instead of \par rules out this behaviour.

With all due respect, his tone wasn't helping, first, and second, he
didn't reply at my points, but what he /thought/ were my points.  And
that's all the more sad knowing that he is indeed an important guy.

I any case, if you're not sure (not sure this is a bug, not sure where to report
it in case it's actually a bug), it's best to ask a general list like texhax@ or
the usenet group comp.text.tex. There's no shame not to be an expert, either in
TeX itself or in its ecosystem. Just take choose the right place for asking your
questions, and try to ask them in a more open way if you're not sure.

It doesn't help either when someone reports a "bug" because he didn't understand
how the software is supposed to work. I mean, the behaviour you report is
intended, documented, and didn't change since 1982 at least :-)

In your case, it is probably faster to solve your initial problem by using one
of the resources pointed to by Robin and Zdenek than understanding all the
subtleties of argument grabbing and conditionals in TeX fist. After all, that's
also the point of software: reuse the work of others.

Manuel.

One possibility:

% appendix.tex
\let\originaldocument\document
\let\document\endinput
   \input document.tex
\let\document\originaldocument
\begin{document}
   Other text.
\end{document}

Making \enddocument=\fi doesn't work because
after \iffalse, TeX never sees \enddocument, only
\end{document}, which it ignores as instructed by
\iffalse.

There are also commands that are not allowed to come
between \iffalse and \fi which can also lead to errors:
anything defined with the \outer prefix (\outer\def...).

It is standard that the token \par as well as blank lines
(which are automatically converted to the token \par) are
not allowed in the argument of a macro, unless it has been
defined with \long\def. Not a bug, but rather intentional
design.

Thank you very much for your input and explanation, much appreciated.  I've
read the relevant parts of the TeXbook, as suggested, and I now understand
the rationale.

Again, sorry for the noise, the inconvenience and the impoliteness.

This is a nice and straightforward solution.  I remember that I did
something very similar a few years ago in order to use the preamble of
the main document within Metapost files.  For Metapost users this
technique is quite convenient because whenever they change the font in
the main document they don't have to adapt all the Metapost source files.

Thanks,
  Reinhard

No, it doesn't.  The opposite is the case.

\begin opens a new group with \begingroup and \document closes it with
\endgroup.  LaTeX is doing this deliberately in order to avoid an
unnecessary nesting level which probably loads the save stack.

\begin{document} looks like an ordinary environment but it isn't.

Please consult the LaTeX sources.  In latex.ltx you'll find a line 

   \def\document{\endgroup

With the ordinary definition of \document, yes. Here we are precisely redefining
\document, so our new definition should do the same.

Actually, I think Heiko and you agree on the TeXnical part, and the discussion
is merely a matter of wording of this particular comment.

Anyway, this kind of discussion belongs on texhax@ :-)

The point is that the redefined \document does *not* close
the group opened by \begin. Therefore I have provided a fix
for this:
  \def\document{\endgroup\endinput}

The option in TL was renamed as -file-line-error by Olaf years ago.
It may be a bug in latexmk.

Really I observe that on Cygwin but NOT on GNU/Linux Kubuntu 9.10

Looking at 'latexmk.pl' script, I see the block:

elsif ( $^O eq "cygwin" ) {
[...]
# For both fptex and miktex, the following makes error messages explicit:
$latex_silent_switch  = '-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors';
$pdflatex_silent_switch  = '-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors';
[...]
}
  else {

so, if I read correctly, on Cygwin TL is confused with fptex or 
miktex... Really I do not see any reason for that block on current 
Cygwin-1.7...

Indeed omitting it *completely*,

-elsif ( $^O eq "cygwin" ) {
-[...]
-# For both fptex and miktex, the following makes error messages -explicit:
-$latex_silent_switch  = '-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors';
-$pdflatex_silent_switch  = '-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors';
-[...]
-}
  else {

the script works just fine :-)

Ken, what do you think?

Well, more generally, I think it's wrong to try detecting the distribution using
the underlying OS as the only information. TeX Live runs on Windows as well as
MikTeX or fpTeX. (I heard there are also experiments to make MikTeX work on Unix.)

I'm not sure what is "the right way" to detect which TeX distribution is being
used, but I'm sure it's not just looking at the OS.

And, given that TL includes Cygwin binaries, it is certainly wrong for 
the script to test for Cygwin and then decide that TL is *not* being 
used.  I agree with Angelo.

Even odder (perhaps), I don't seem to have "texi2pdf", despite
having installed TeX Live 2009 from DVD.  Neither "texi2pdf"
at the command line, nor "texdoc texi2pdf", produce anything
useful :

AFAIK it's not part of TL. My version is from /usr/bin, part of my
Linux installation. I don't know why this question was sent
to the TL list.

It was removed from TeX Live last summer, but you can simply copy it
from the TL-2008 DVD.

Message-ID: <t2oeba574421004080531nf9873ae1u7a9d55f9da1e04f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

If I test the LuaTeX 0.60 for mingw32 that I can get on
http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/frs/, everything is doing
fine, but if I compile my own binary under cygwin, for documents using
a lot of big fonts, I easily run out of memory. I don't think it's a
big deal as I can use mingw32 binaries under cygwin without any
problem, but I think it would be worth documenting it for TeX Live's
cygwin distribution (if binaries are built under cygwin).

Thank you,

Can you check whether this is because of lua garbage collection
that kicks in too slow (the most common cause of high memory usage
so far)? If this is the cause, then it should be fixable by adding

  collectgarbage('collect')

statements at key points in the lua code that loads those big fonts
(one before or after each font should do the trick). But if that
doesn't work, then I suspect something is seriously wrong with the
cygwin executable and you'll need a tool like valgrind to figure
out what is leaking and why.

Best wishes,
Taco

This does not work, sadly...

Another problem is that Valgrind is not working under cygwin... I
won't have time to inquire (especially without any appropriate tool),
so I guess the only option is to document it somewhere...

Texlive does distribute Cygwin binaries (for Cygwin 1.7 only).  Can you 
test to see if the problem occurs with those?  I'm the one who built the 
binaries, but I've never used Luatex and don't know how to test it.

Are the binaries for TeXLive 2010 built already? If so where can I
find them? If I test on the binaries of TeXLive 2009, it won't be
reliable as a lot of changes happened in LuaTeX since...

I just did a test build yesterday based on the current svn sources.  I'm 
not at that computer right now, but I'll be there later and can make a 
tarball for you.

Because the texlive installed version of bidi is under xeltex specific
path, so kpathsea will prefere it (AFAIK) over the one installed under
your local texmf tree which is under generic latex path, which is not
the case with lualatex. You can check with:

$ kpsewhich --progname=lualatex bidi.sty
$ kpsewhich --progname=xelatex bidi.sty

Try an option
-O number
where the number is the max. depth of open bookmarks (default is 0).

Unsupported by dvipdfm and older versions of dvipdfmx.

If you have a recent dvipdfmx try:
  \usepackage[dvipdfmx,dvipdfmx-outline-open]{hyperref}
and use dvipdfmx.

I, too, get alerts from Sophos and so I copied the Windows .exe's and .dlls to my Linux box and scanned them with 3 other AVs.
F-Prot found nothing, but ClamAV and AVG both reported the same files as Sophos: dviout.exe, psv.exe, and texworks.exe

It is somewhat disconcerting that 3 out of 4 antivirus scanners tested pick out the same 3 files.  Are the scanners all using the same (false) signatures.  [I would
expect that would lead to patent/copyright problems...]

This discussion probably belongs on the tlbuild list.  I've set the 
Reply-to accordingly.

I did a grep of the luatex sources and found a large number of places 
where there are special cases for Cygwin, including many where Cygwin is 
lumped with Mingw32 and Win32.  I suspect this is what's causing the 
problem.  Cygwin is a unix-like system and is treated as such in most of 
the texlive build.  The configure scripts and libtool are usually able 
to do the right thing on Cygwin.

Maybe you should try removing some or all of the special-casing.

Confirm that those places are not essential parts of LuaTeX.
The code only restricts output of executable files.

Hello!

After an update (on the Easter weekend?) I now see these additional  
hyphenation patterns used: assamese, bengali, guajrati, hindi,  
assamese, malayalam, marathi, oriya, panjabi, tamil, telugu, turkmen.  
The names

	guajrati, panjabi

are obviously incorrect. IMO they are correctly spelled like this:

	gujarati, punjabi

Hi,

When I include the line

\usepackage{skull}

I get a compiling error, even if I do not use the command $\skull$. Attached, I have included the message from the log file.

This used to work but now it doesn't after running the TeXLive Utility. I am using MacTeX 2009 if that means something. I should add that this works when I work on Windows (MikTeX) even after it updates.

Kindest regards,

  The former is indeed a misspelling, but panjabi is a common variant
spelling for punjabi in Latin.  We took it in hyph-utf8 from the
contributor, I'd rather stick to the spelling he chose.

  I'll correct guajrati.

Hi,

since there have been some suggestions about what software could be
included in TL2010, I would also like to ask about ChkTeX:
http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/ It's basically lacheck
replacement, and it's written in C and has no special dependancies,
and unlike lacheck, it's maintained.

Hi Vedran,

    http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/ 

1) It doesn't have a configure script.  Can't include it for that
   reason.

2) The version on CTAN is stale.  Should't include it for that reason
   either, although at least that is more easily remedied than 1).

3) As it happens, I just heard from someone who may resume maintenance
   of lacheck.  I hope so.  I'll tell him about chktex.

Not guajrati but gujarati. Notice that short "a" is not pronounced in
many cases, so that gujrati most probably reflects pronunciation.
Spelling panjabi is a direct transliteration and it is used this way
in India, punjabi is an English spelling.

  Yes, that's what I meant: I'll correct guajrati into gujarati :-)
I know the first 'a' is mute, but I've never seen the spelling "gujrati"
in English.

  Thanks for this, that's what I suspected as well.  I'll keep it that
way (panjabi), in any case.

When Indian people send SMS or write emails using Latin script, they
often do so, even in places where would not expect it. Anyway, from my
point of view "gujarati" would be better than "gujrati".

This works fine for me

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{skull}
\begin{document}
$\skull$
\end{document}

did you install a full TeXLive (I don't work on Mac so I don't know what

Subject: [tex-live] Texlive 2009-39.1 update caused beamer problem
Message-ID: <201004121330.01665.paolo.crosetto@gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

I am a heavy latex-beamer user (actually, I depend on it!).

I use Opensuse 11.1, x86-64, and use to have texlive update from the (stable) 
Publishing repository (here: Index of 
/repositories/Publishing/openSUSE_11.1/x86_64)

I recently updated to the latest version of texlive available on the repo (it 
is 2009-39.1 for some packages and 2009-38.1 for other (notably the main 
texlive itself).

Since the update, beamer files fail to compile properly with pdflatex some of 
the old files, and _does not_ compile at all the new files.


In the second case, which is by far the worse, beamer cannot compile any file. 
It spits out an error at the very first line (undefined control sequence: 
\begin{document}).

In this case beamer cannot compile even a minimal file like this:

\documentclass[a4paper,9pt,handout]{beamer}
\title{A title}
\author{Me}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle 

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{A sample frame}
\begin{itemize}
 \item frame content 1
 \item frame content 2
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{document}

The errors it reports are striking: follows an excerpt from the log

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009/openSUSE Build 
Service (...)

*geometry* driver: auto-detecting
*geometry* detected driver: pdftex
! Undefined control sequence.
\Gm at lmargin -&gt;\Geom at lmargin 
                            
l.12 \begin{document}
                     
! Undefined control sequence.
\Gm at rmargin -&gt;\Geom at rmargin 

------------------------

In the first case (some old file with a beamer presentation) the file 
compiles, and pdf is generated, but margins are wrong, parts of the slides is 
cropped, and it reports errors in the beamer style file.

The errors reported are somewhat different from file to file, but they usually 
have to do with style files (innertheme, outertheme). More precisely, 
compilation reports errors on meeting statements related to 'text margin left' 
and/or 'text margin right'. 

\setbeamersize{text margin left = \beamer at fancy@normalmargin}

Beamer complains that this is an undefined control sequence (I suppose it 
complains about 'text margin left').

I suppose something must have gone wrong either in texlive sources or in the 
compilation process used to build the 2009-39 (and -38) rpms.

I wanted to contact the repo maintainer as I think this could be the 
packager's fault but could not find his/her name anywhere.

Thanks!

Paolo

File a bug with bugzilla (https://bugzilla.novell.com); the problem is
already fixed in TeXlive.

I have no idea about what this numbers mean, since they are specific to OpenSuse
packaging. But anyway...

There was a problem with the newer version of geometry, which dropped some very
old control sequences. Unfortunately, beamer did rely on these. This problem
appeard in r17014 (2010-02-15, geometry 5.0) and was solved by r17092
(2010-02-19, ad-hoc patch applied to beamer). (Revision numbers from our svn
repository: <http://tug.org/svn/texlive>.)

Apparently, the OpenSuse packages are using a snapshot fix a recent geometry and
an unfixed beamer, which is very unfortunate. I suggest you report this in your
distribution's bug tracking system (with the above information), so that they
can update their packages using a consistent snapshot of TL.

For your convenience, here is the patch that solves the problem:

Hmm, when did they build those RPMs?

This looks like an error (caused by a geometry update), which have been 
fixed several weeks ago

This is why I get LaTeX from TL directly, and not from a Linux dist.

If you search the archive for this list, you will find which file needs 
to be updated.

Hmmm ... http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html does *not* show any
informations about this issue.  Wouldn't it better to have
some errata for TeXLive 2009 on that page?  Btw: there is
already a bug #591958 at https://bugzilla.novell.com

This bug did only exist in a 4-days window. I'm not sure it's worth trying to
document every transient bug in TL. (OTOH, I agree that this particular one is
very annoying.)

Perhaps I'm missing something, but given the way TeX Live tends to be 
released would errata which appear when updating "count". I can see the 
need to mention problems with the DVD release, or with ongoing issues 
(which as far as I know currently don't exist!), but not with individual 
packages updated after release. (The MiKTeX "issues" takes much this 
approach: only things which are ongoing get mentioned.)

The problem with the beamer class was caused by an update with
the geometry class for an XeLaTeX problem.  As I do maintain
the RPM package version of TeXLive the tlmgr is a nogo (it would
interfere with the RPM data base).

You should also tell graphicx the correct driver name.

Message-ID: <201004121326.56963.paolo.crosetto@gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

I am a heavy latex-beamer user (actually, I depend on it!).

I use Opensuse 11.1, x86-64, and use to have texlive update from the (stable) 
Publishing repository (here: Index of 
/repositories/Publishing/openSUSE_11.1/x86_64)

I recently updated to the latest version of texlive available on the repo (it 
is 2009-39.1 for some packages and 2009-38.1 for other (notably the main 
texlive itself).

Since the update, beamer files fail to compile properly with pdflatex some of 
the old files, and _does not_ compile at all the new files.


In the second case, which is by far the worse, beamer cannot compile any file. 
It spits out an error at the very first line (undefined control sequence: 
\begin{document}).

In this case beamer cannot compile even a minimal file like this:

\documentclass[a4paper,9pt,handout]{beamer}
\title{A title}
\author{Me}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle 

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{A sample frame}
\begin{itemize}
 \item frame content 1
 \item frame content 2
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{document}

The errors it reports are striking: follows an excerpt from the log

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009/openSUSE Build 
Service (...)

*geometry* driver: auto-detecting
*geometry* detected driver: pdftex
! Undefined control sequence.
\Gm at lmargin -&gt;\Geom at lmargin 
                            
l.12 \begin{document}
                     
! Undefined control sequence.
\Gm at rmargin -&gt;\Geom at rmargin 

------------------------

In the first case (some old file with a beamer presentation) the file 
compiles, and pdf is generated, but margins are wrong, parts of the slides is 
cropped, and it reports errors in the beamer style file.

The errors reported are somewhat different from file to file, but they usually 
have to do with style files (innertheme, outertheme). More precisely, 
compilation reports errors on meeting statements related to 'text margin left' 
and/or 'text margin right'. 

\setbeamersize{text margin left = \beamer at fancy@normalmargin}

Beamer complains that this is an undefined control sequence (I suppose it 
complains about 'text margin left').

I suppose something must have gone wrong either in texlive sources or in the 
compilation process used to build the 2009-39 (and -38) rpms.

I wanted to contact the repo maintainer as I think this could be the 
packager's fault but could not find his/her name anywhere.

Thanks!

Maybe not the best idea to test these things on the

You can install strawberry perl and use that instead for running latexmk.

Btw, with current TeX Live, an external Perl will always be used if installed
and visible in the PATH (except for a few specific scripts such as tlmgr).

So you don't need to do anything special for latexmk to use your external Perl
besides:
- installing Perl (no kidding)
- making sure your texlive-scripts package is up to date.

HTH,
Manuel.


PS: the next Perl we'll ship will probably contain the whole Digest module
(well, the whole basic Perl distribution), but we're still having a few problems
with it, IIRC. On the long run, we don't plan to track the dependencies of all
scripts, so that the recommended way for scripts depending on modules not in
tlperl will remain the same: install your own Perl, then our wrappers will make
sure it is used by those scripts.

Today I discovered that installing gnuplot-4.4.0 as "root", e.g.
"sudo make install" does:
[...]
test -z "/usr/local/usr//usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/tex/latex/gnuplot"

"/usr/local/usr//usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/tex/latex/gnuplot"
 /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 gnuplot.cfg gnuplot-lua-tikz.sty
'/usr/local/usr//usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/tex/latex/gnuplot'
make  install-data-hook
test -n "" || texhash
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/ls-R...

texhash: Done.

so the ls-R ownership gets changed to root.   What other packages do this?

Yes - it should be this way as you install gnuplot as a root and it
installs also in TL tree. Asymptote does the same for sure and I guess
any s/w which installs LaTeX packages.

I suspect that any non-TL s/w which in the process of "(sudo) make
install"  installs LaTeX packages

Maybe "install" should have an option to make ownership of
installed/generated files match the existing value.

TeX Live could provide a mechanism so that when mktexlsr, etc.
are run by root the ownership is set to that of the pre-existing files
or to some designated tladmin user:group, or at least exit with
warning message if pre-existing files are not owned by root.

You could ask the maintainer of gnuplot (and/or other similar packages) for an
option to use "sudo <user>" before any intervention related to TeX Live (writing
files in the texmf-local tree, running mktexlsr). This is quite easy to
implement: define a Make variable "TL_CMD_PREFIX", empty by default, then add it
to a few places like :

$(TL_CMD_PREFIX) mkdir -p ...
$(TL_CMD_PREFIX) install  ... ...
$(TL_CMD_PREFIX) mktexlsr

The the user can do:

sudo make install TL_CMD_PREFIX="sudo tladmin"

(omit the initial sudo if you're already root or otherwise have sufficient
privileges).

I'd don't really like this idea. IMO utilities should respect "natural"
ownership. If you want the files generated to be owned by tladmin, you should
become tladmin using sudo or su before running the utilities.

Subject: [tex-live] no kpsetool on windows?
Message-ID: <4BC37BFE.5070008@ankabut.net>


Hello Karl and others,

All architectures supported by TL provide kpsetool (and the associated 
symlinks kpsepath and kpsexpand). Except Windows, where only kpsewhich 
is available (they are not in MikTeX either): I assume there is a reason 
for it, but I am just wondering: can this be changed or improved?

The reason I'm asking is that Biber relies partly on the ouput of 
"kpsepath bib" to locate bibliographic databases, but we found out today 
that this fails on Windows, so we had to hack the code to use kpsewhich 
instead.

Thanks in advance,
Fran?ois

Hi Francois -- my suggestion is, forget kpsetool.  Why do you need it?
Just always use kpsewhich.

kpsetool is a /bin/sh script so it can't run on standard Windows.
Rewriting it is not likely to happen, at least not by me.  Sorry.

not sure, latexmk on win 7 with a fully updated TL 09 just complained

just had a second look, yes you provide

Digest::MD5, etc.

but latexmk explicitly calls

use Digest;

which makes it fail

But since latexmk only use Digest->MD5 (AFAICS), it fwould be enough to 
change latexmk to use

use Digest::MD5;

could someone send a message to John Collins?

I'm watching this thread.  It's a little more complicated than just using

    use Digest::MD5;

unfortunately.

sorry to hear that. I usually only work on Linux, where latexmk always 
work, so I was a bit surprised to see that it didn't work by default on 
windows.

I'll just go along with what I have now (which is working) and tell the 
students that it will be fixed.

One of the first things I'm going to show in my demo is how to update 
TeXLive using the manager.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr update problem
Message-ID: <0D506209-6B65-4AEF-BB9B-E8CB64B3FE76@mac.com>

I ran `/usr/texbin/tlmgr --repository http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet --machine-readable --persistent-downloads update --all` to update my OS X (10.6.3, TeX Live 2009) system this evening.  

While the tlmgr update was running, I started a VPN session, and about that time updates started failing.  I've snipped dozens of lines, but they're all the same xz error message you see following the successful update lines.

What I find odd is that presently `tlmgr update --list` finds nothing to update, in spite of all these failures.  Is the installation in an inconsistent state?  I'm guessing I should nuke it and start over again.

thanks,
Adam

the authors haven't uploaded it or offered mirroring capabilities, so
i've deleted the package from ctan (what we had was older than what's on
offer).  i assume they don't want it on ctan.

i don't know what that does for inclusion in tex live.

Before you throw out the evidence it would be good to figure out why
the update failed.

Since you are using texbin I assume you have MacTeX rather than a
vanilla TL install.   MacTeX sets ownership to root, so if you ran
tlmgr without "sudo" updates will fail due to permission problems.   I
use "chown -R <tladmin> /usr/local/texlive/" to reset permissions so
the <tladmin> user can run tlmgr to update systems via ssh terminal
sessions.

that might, depending on your configuration, suddendly route all traffic 
through the VPN, and I am not sure if already running connections
can cope with that. Be reminded that there is already one open
connection (persistent download connection).

So since I have no way to trigger that myself I have to say no idea,
and I guess you have to figure that out yourself.

IN general, messing with the network settings, and setting up a VPN is
exactely that, is not really the best way to be done during an update.

If your Windows users have recent hardware you can use a Linux Virtual
machine.

Where I work, Windows is the "standard", but we have "mission" critical
apps that require linux.  Using unix tools on a bunch of Windows
machines is a constant battle.   For scientific users many 3rd party
apps install versions of perl, ghostscript, cygwin, etc so you never know
what you will find on a randomly selected Windows box.

The Sage people are providing a VM for Windows users but it also
gives a simple way to get sagemath on other platforms that have
VirtualBox.

  ------------http://www.sagemath.org/mirror/win/README.txt------------------
Sage VirtualBox Distribution

This is Sage (see http://www.sagemath.org) distributed as a compressed
VirtualBox appliance.  It requires 2GB of free disk space and 1GB RAM
to install and run.

INSTALLATION:
   1. Install the free open source program VirtualBox (70MB) for your
      operating system (Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, or x86
      Solaris):  http://www.virtualbox.org/
   2. In VirtualBox, click File --> Import Appliance, and select the
      file "sage.ovf", which is in the same directory as README.txt.
   3. Click "Next", then "Import", and wait about two minutes.
   4. From within VirtualBox, start the new virtual machine "Sage
      VirtualBox Appliance", then open your web browser in Microsoft
      Windows (or OS X, etc.) to the address that is displayed.

YOUR WORKSHEETS:
   All of your worksheets are stored in the virtual machine.
   To download them all to a file
   download_worksheets.zip, click the link "Download All Active" from
   the list of Sage worksheets.  The file download_worksheets.zip
   contains all of your worksheets.  You can upload that zip file into
   another copy of Sage to open *all* of your worksheets.

DEVELOPMENT:
   You can modify the copy of Sage included in this virtual machine.
   Also, GCC is included, so you can compile code, etc.

SUPPORT:
   Join http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support or get free
   live help at http://www.sagemath.org/help-irc.html
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With cheap disk you can easily afford to have multiple VM's
for different applications on a Windows PC.

It is not a big job to create new VMware VM's that run under the
free VMware player, so even if Oracle messes up VB there are
alternatives.

FWIW, I agree with Lars. We put quite a lot of effort to offer support for
windows (many thanks to Tomek, Akira and Siep for that), so it would be a pity
to be forced to use a Linux VM just for TL.

Here the point is to install a Perl distro. Perl is easy to install on windows
thanks to the strawberry Perl distribution. No need to use Linux just to get Perl.

Not that I'm a big fan of windows, but let's not exaggerate the problems with
this system. A lot of free software is available on windows and as easy to use
there as on Unix. TeX live is one such software.

You're right. I had not even looked at kpsetool to figure out it is a 
shell script. Biber now uses "kpsewhich -file-type='bib'" instead. It is 
simpler and always works. Sorry for the noise!

I'm quite sure that's what it did :).  The VPN allows http traffic, but it probably started hitting a network authentication page.

Yeah, I know that now?but it would be nice if tlmgr marked the failed updates as such and allowed me to rerun the update command.

I would be quite surprised if updates were added to the texlive.tlpdb
without actually being done. The reason is that the .tar.xz file has
to be unpacked (xzdec failures!) followed by un-tarring and only then
the addition of the tlpobj (the new one) to the texlive.tlpdb is done.
So it *SHOULD* be in consistent state ...

Is there any way to tell for sure?  For instance, the XeTeX update
failed, and I have this in /usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb:

name collection-xetex
category Collection
revision 17780

Likewise polyglossia:

name polyglossia
category Package
revision 17538

The base install was installed using install-tl from a local repo that
is fairly old, and it shows

name collection-xetex
category Collection
revision 16078

name polyglossia
category Package
revision 16132

Since this was the first update after installing from that repo, it
seems like the failed packages should have the same versions.
I also noticed some complaints about "uninitialized value $out in
concatenation...at /usr/texbin/tlmgr line 508" but that may be
irrelevant.

thanks,
Adam

What xetex update failed? collection-xetex oder xetex.*?

Hard to tell, please run
	tlmgr check all

Can you tell me the svn rev of your tlmgr?
	tlmgr -v --version
?

Collection-xetex.  I just picked one from the list in my original message,
which was snipped heavily.  The list of failures is ~600 lines, with 2 per
failure:

I snipped this heavily.  Let me know if you need the full output.

I can try reproducing this tonight, if needed.  I still have the source files

Ouch ...

Did you update texlive.infra *before* updating all the rest?

That is really strange, because it means that the
	` ... `
in TLUtils::run_cmd didn't work, which is rather surprising.

It really seems that you hosed something more than normal.

I have absolutely no idea what has happened here, but $out above should
definitely not be undefined if at least xzdec was started. But it seems
that even that is missing?

Do you have your ROOT/tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.$ARCH and can execute it?

I can only imagine that the xz binary is hosed and cannot be executed.

Best wishes

They seem to be related to the packages that didn't decompress; I noted a 
lot of similar names.

Yes.  I was using TeX Live Utility, which forces you to do that :).

I'll check when I get home tonight.  However, there were a bunch of packages
that successfully decompressed and installed, so I think xz is present and
working.  There were no failure messages until I connected to VPN, at
which point xz was probably being fed HTML from an error page instead of
compressed data.

It was missing indeed.  I uploaded it to the repository (rev. 17847).
Will be available via "tlmgr update" soon.

I've stolen it from Akira's W32TeX distribution.  Almost everything in
/path/to/texlive/bin/win32/ comes from Akira anyway.

Thanks for reporting the bug.

Running a virtual machine only for using TeX Live? In that case I'd prefer using MikTeX, which is known to run fine on Windows. (But I don't know whether it includes latexmk.)

There are no substantial problems with Windows, only wrong expectations. If you expect Windows to behave like Linux, you're going to be disappointed. MikTeX is popular because it feels like a native Windows application, while TeX Live still seems to be biased towards Linux.

Done.  Thanks for reminding me.  I always forget to update tlpsrc.
It seems that during the last decades I was getting older, but now I'm
apparently getting old.

Nope:

$ ll /usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/installer/xz/*

/usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.universal-darwin: Try `/usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.universal-darwin --help' for more information.

So it's executable, and spits out an error when trying to run it with no input.
Some packages are now available for update, so I ran (from TLU)

/usr/texbin/tlmgr --repository http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet --machine-readable --persistent-downloads update biblatex-philosophy

and had no problems.  I'll move aside this install and see if a clean one
from my local repo has problems.

thanks,
Adam

Because TeX Live avoids the crappy Widows registry, or what?  Nothing
within TeX Live is Linux-specific or platform-specific at all.  TeX
Live just supports ***all*** operating systems which are in use today.
There is absolutely no reason why people shouldn't use TeX Live under
Windows.

Can you explain why Windows users should use MikTeX instead of TeX
Live?  Did you ever try TeX Live on Windows yourself?  If yes, what's
wrong with TeX Live?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Having switched from MixTeX to TeX Live very recently, I found TeX
Live very easy to use (as is MikTeX for that matter) and I was
especially happy with the included perl distributions that made a
whole bunch of scripts simply executable (I trying to use some font
installation tools and quickly decided to change to TeX Live on which
this appeared more natural to me, a novice at anything distribution
related). I'm happy it ignores the registry (why can't programs simply
use a local config file?).

My only less positive experience with it is that the tlmgr and the
installer interface appear extremely slow/inresponsive, on both XP
32bit SP3 and windows 7 64bit. For instance, I ended up downloading
the DVD and installing from there as the download progress appeared
stuck. The update after the install (300 something packages) also
proved hazardous, not haveing completed after several hours and the
GUI being frozen. Command-lining things, all worked fine and fast
though ;) does anybody have similar experiences on windows?

Best,
Dee

Done.  Tlmgr check all reports only a few issues, so I think my repo is fine.  
If it would be helpful, I guess I could try breaking it again by starting a VPN
session during an update.

That is strange. I am running XPSP3 on a virtual machine and it works

I assume that the actual problem is the downloading of the programs.
It seems that you have either a slow or choppy connection.

Did you update your texlive.infra as a first step (what does tlmgr --version
say).

You could try to do the update on the cmd line and see if there is
a similar slow down:
	tlmgr update --all

I just updated my texlive.infra to test it out: tlmgr revision 17611
(2010-03-30 01:21:59 +0200).

The connection would not be the problem, I did run it over the command
line at that time and then had no issue (also, its a connection from
one uni to the other here inside Hong Kong, I get over an megabyte per
second from the ctan mirror).

After updating texlive.infra, I'm now applying the other 64 updates
that were awaiting me. It started out fine, but now seems to show the
same problem. When selecting the GUI, it does not seem to be redrawn,
giving the illusion to be stuck. When view the process list, perl.exe
and wget.exe seem to be running (I guess if a blocking call to wget is
made, that explains the GUI not refreshing). No processor activity for
either over a few minutes, so I force-quitted and now ran it over the
command line, which was fast, matter of a few minutes, even only a few
10s of seconds for the 28MB pst-geo update.

If you can't reproduce this, it'll be hard to test. I cant exclude
this is a psuchological phenomenon with the blocked GUI creating the
impression of a stuck process, but the inactive but running wget.exe
might point to something else.

Best,
Dee

Oh, and should it matter, being a windows only user (by history) I'm
running a clean windows ship with no linux/unix tools installed (yet,
I'm going to take a look at the GNU collection). So no cygwin, perl or
python distribution, etc. IMHO, thats an environment in which TeX Live
for windows should be tested, in case it isn;t.

Best and thanks!

wget.exe is running???? That is surprising ... with new tlmgr you should
not see wget running, but downloads should be done via one open
connection. Can you *before* starting the update turn on debugging
(Options->Debug) and copy the output in the log part?

There should be a persistent connection ...

For the no window updates this is a problem with the perl and that
we cannot use threads, so during wget running no updates to the GUI
are possible.

Seems that wget was hanging!!

Hmmmmm ... why on earth the gui is so much slower I don't know.

Inactivity of the processor together with running wget seems to be
a sign that downloading does not work as expected, at least that is
what it seems ...

very strange.

If you can get a debug log and send it it *might* help.

There definately isn't, following the update in the process list (I
did, I remember), wget.exe pops up every now and then (well yeah, for
downloading each update).

Is there a way to downgrade a few packages to earlier revisions (I
dont know whether CTAN actually stores earlier revisions as well) so
that I can update again and get the log to you. Meanwhile, I simply
installed a few packages I hadn't, here's the log. It ran smoothly
this time btw, maybe this is perception... wget.exe was running again,
popping-up and disspearing during download (and install? maybe the
windows task manager is not that real time.. things went fast, saw
only two separate wget.exes for 7 packages).

Best,
Dee

Yeah but there is one per package. It all looks fine.

The delay could come from the --timeout=900 of wget, but would happen
only if you have a bad connection, which you don't have.

Norbert, there is no LWP module in our current tlperl, I just checked.
You probably using our test one (as do I), where LWP is included and
everything works as expected.

I'm not in the position to judge this as I don't use TeX on Windows, but I've read a few opinions in the newsgroups that MikTeX still seems to be preferred on Windows. My post is not intended to be a criticism of TeX Live, which I like much and have been using for years.
Some general thoughts: Operating-system independence is impossible because the look and feel of operating systems differ a lot. An application should have a native graphical interface that blends well with the operating system?MacTeX does that (the installation process, TeX Live Manager, TeXshop), but I'm not sure about Windows or Linux. It (the application) should be stored in the standard program directory (e.g. C:\Program Files), and should be able to access arbitrary valid Unicode file names, meaning that the standard C functions cannot be used, etc.
My point is that if you want to take users from MikTeX, there must be something that is better than the MikTeX equivalent.

Yup, tried to run with this switch (I am using the normal released
texlive 2009, not any development version), wget.exe does keep popping
up for every seperate download, as always.

As a side note, we recently enabled our script wrapping machinery also
for end user added scripts (either your own or coming from manually
added packages). Interested folks can get instructions from:

  runscript --help

I had a similar issue updating from the command line under Ubuntu:

and so on for every package to update. But the weird thing is that this just happened under Ubuntu ---with Fedora and Mac OS everything went smoothly, *using the same repository*.

This happened for a couple of weeks more or less, and now Ubuntu is back to normal, but I don't know what changed.

In my (probably biased) opinion, a few years ago, MikTeX was technically a
better choice on windows (basically because it had a package management system
unlike TeX Live < 2008), but now (say TeX Live 2009), I'd say the difference is
pretty tiny:

- MikTeX has this on-the-fly-install feature which is very convenient for people
wanting to install a minimal system and complete it according to their needs.
- MikTeX may "feel" more native in some ways, though TeX Live is getting more
and more polished (or so I hope, and thanks to Tomek).
- TeX Live ships with Perl and GS, no need to install them separately.
- TeX Live is cross-platform, which is convenient in heterogeneous environments.
- TeX Live already includes LuaTeX (though this doesn't matter yet for a
majority of users).

IMO, the prevalence of MikTeX is mainly due to the fact that it used to be
really the better choice, so people are used to it and continue recommending it.
And obviously remarks like "just use a Linux VM" don't help people changing
their mind.

(Btw, I personally don't consider it as a goal to make people migrate from
MikTeX to TL. If MikTeX fulfils their needs, I even encourage them not to change
unless they have a reason to do so (never change something that works). My only
goal is to make TL as good as possible on all platforms. Again, this is only my
personal opinion.)

The problems I have seen are more to do with the 3rd party "utilities"
such as ghostscript, perl, ruby, icon (for noweb), tcl/tk, etc. With linux
these are usually provided by the distribution and used by TeX and
other software.

The TeX users I know all need other software for the work that they
publish using TeX.   Much of this software also uses 3rd party utilities,
so on Windows you may end up with several versions of ghostscript,
perl, etc.

Many people decided to use MiKTeX years ago when TL did not have the
current installer, or when the installer was less robust than it is now.  My
impression is that TL is still "fragile", e.g., when user has some old version
of perl, etc., early in the PATH.   Recent TeX adopters tend to use what
works for others, so MiKTeX will continue to be used on more Windows
machines as long as it is good enough for most users, e.g., until ConTeXt
MkIV supplants LaTeX.

MiKTeX has a "portable" configuration that can be installed on a USB
stick and does not touch the registry.

TL is used on WIndows by people who were already using TL on other
platforms or who need something not available in MiKTeX.  ConTeXt
MkIV users currently have to install the "minimal" distro, but the
situation will change if TL finds a way to keep up with the ConTeXt
update schedule.

Many people can work comfortably on Windows using MiKTeX or TL,
but there are also many who struggle to get noweb, ConTeXt,
sagemath, etc. to work -- all things that are easily done in current
linux distros.

That is the one point with which I would take issue.  As I have
written elsewhere, the naive belief that all Windows users
still live in the dark ages, have one physical drive with one
logical partition, and that it is Good Practice [tm] to store
programs and data on the same partition as the operating system
is a myth that needs to be eradicated, by force if necessary !

Any competent Windows installer (by whom I mean a person,
not a program) knows to divide the available disc space
into a number of disjoint partitions (e.g., system, programs,
read-only data, read/write data, scratch, swap), to keep (say)
C: solely for the O.S. (and for those things that Microsoft
/insist/ on installing there, offering the user no choice
in the matter), and to install all layered products (such as
TeX Live) on a separate partition, separating programs from
data from scratch space whenever possible.

It is, I believe, a great mistake that TeX Live, too, assumes that
a single partition will be used to hold the whole of a TeX
installation, and makes no provision for storing the binaries
outside of the primary data hierarchy.  [I would be very happy
to stand corrected if I am misjudging the TeX Live installer
here].

100% agreed. I don't want any fight between MikTeX and TeX Live. Actually
it would have been nice to work together in packaging ...

That will not happen, as the search path and the primary texmf.cnf is 
found according to the location of the binaries.

You still of course can move TEXMFLOCAL whereever you want ...

When TL is packaged by a linux distro there are policies that dictate
what type of file can go where.   In addition to the CTAN installer
there are debian/Ubuntu and Fedora installers:

<http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/texlive>
<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TeXLive>

Maybe Microsoft has seen the light:

"Now this is interesting. Microsoft developer Garrett Serack has
acknowledged that it is generally easier to roll out a, for instance,
complex stack of open source server software on Linux than it is on
Windows. He also offers a solution - he's working on a project to
bring package management to Windows. This project will be
community-driven, and Serack has the full blessing from Microsoft." --

> That will not happen, as the search path and the primary texmf.cnf is

It is a useful feature that CTAN TL can live entirely under a single
top-level directory, but there are problems for sites that want to put the
data on a shared "folder" but also have "no execute" policies for
such folders.  Given that disk is cheap and more and more people
rely on laptops, I suspect most sites use the shared directory for a
local cache of the archives with TL installed to local disk.

If someone wants to enforce a policy, they need to implement the
policy in tools or the end result will be chaos with the files in different
"areas" getting out of sync after updates.   Linux has two "proof of
concept" examples showing that it can be done, so it is up to the
Windows community to help Serack get it done.

> You still of course can move TEXMFLOCAL whereever you want ...

Or just use debian linux.

1. This is in no way specific to windows.
2. I don't think it's a mistake.

Well, it's hard to tell program from data in the various files from texlive. For
example, a lot of scripts do only have a stub in the "bin" dir, and the actual
program is a text file in the texmf(-dist) tree. So, from an administration
point of view, I don't see any reason to put some part of TeX Live in one place,
and some other part in another place.

And as Norbert said, the search mechanisms of kpse assume that texmf has a fixed
location relative to the binaries. But, as mentioned in a previous discussion,
the whole package infrastructure (tlmgr) does a similar assumption (even
stringer, since both texmf and texmfdist have to be fixed). So, changing this
would mean at least two *major* changes in TeX Live, and even with a very good
reason it is highly unlikely to happen.

Manuel.

I have never used TeXLive but I'm sure there is nothing fundamentely
wrong with the windows version. But nevertheless is doesn't feel
like a windows application. By simply looking at the documentation I
could find some examples:

E.g. 

1. The installation descriptions at
(http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) starts with
"After unpacking the archive, move to the resulting install-tl-*
subdirectory". This is simply not the windows wording. 

2. The description in the main documentation is a bit better as it
contains the word "double-click":
"If you are using the net installer, or the DVD installer failed to
start automatically, double-click install-tl.bat"
But the naming of the install script is wrong. It should be
setup-texlive.exe or something like this. 

3. The package manager in miktex is mpm.exe, and the configuration
tool is mo.exe. The main tool in TeX Live is tlmgr. Now look at this
two captions from the miktex and the tex live documentation:

Figure 4.1. MiKTeX Options: General Settings
Figure 9: tlmgr in GUI mode. 

A windows documentation avoids to confront a user with "technical"
looking names like tlmgr. If you look at discussion of miktex users
you will seldom find one which use "mpm" or "mo". Everyone writes
"miktex options" or "miktex settings". 



4. Later on in the documenation there are some screenshots of the
gui of tlmgr and while there look quite neat, there certainly don't
look like normal windows dialogs.

Hi

Can anyone get tlperl to start Adobe Reader? I'm trying to see if In can get

latexmk -pdf -pv file.tex

to work on Windows (WinXP or Win7), but Adobe Reader keep failing.

Interestingly psv.exe does seem to work with a simply

$file = "test.pdf';
system("start psv.exe $file");

and on cmd.exe

start test.pdf

opens AR just fine.

very interesting

BTW: how come it does not look in the current dir?

to test a script I had to add it to texmf-dist/scripts and update the 
database. Might be useful for users if they could write their own scripts.

forgot to mention that apparently there is no problem with

if one is using ActiveState perl.

Yes, but as long as we do not want to loose tlmgr update --all
facility that will not happen. Or as long as we do not get
more programmers that actually reimplement something like apt-get/dpkg
in perl for us, it will happen neither.

data - program - that is all the same ... is there a difference???

You should separate your *own* input files from those provided by
texlive, but within TL what need there is for separation I don't see.
If the partition wiht TL on it (bin and texmf trees) crashes so what,
reinstall. But the user data is the important thing.

Please let us NOT FORGET that the important thing in the end is
to "produce beautiful documents" ... !!!!

It *is* not a Windows program, but a multi-arch distribution ...

Of course, if you start from an expectation that TeX Live is
just another Windows program ok ...

Sorry, *WHO* cares for the name of the install program? I have seen
many different names already, and install-tl.bat does NOT seem
worse than others.

That is the weakest argument I heard in the last years.

So we do often write

.... 

You are suggesting things that are plain simply documenation conventions,
that has nothing to do with "feeling lieka win app"

What please is a "normal windows dialog"?

Do you mean the window decorations?
Do you mean the wording?
Do you mean the order of the Ok/Cancel buttons?

Look at eg Avast Antivirus programs main window ... or Norton or
any other program? They all do NOTlook like "normal" windows 
programs to me.

I would say you are judging on the fact that TeX Live does not look
like MikTeX. That is true. But that is not what we are discussing.

as he explained further: He dont't assigns data=mydata

Norbert seperates: (files from elsewhere <-> myfiles)

A lot was writen the past hours about the seperation under Windows. As
of today it is still very difficult to get user-config-files out of
C:\users\ ... without trouble

And so, if I loose my Windows-Partition, I'm loosing a lot of config
data ...

But that could be changed (should be changed, IMHO).  Just because
that is how things currently are does not mean that that is the
way they must remain for all eternity.  Every new release of TeX
Live allows for things to be improved : one such improvement would
be the separation of programs from data.

I do, as a matter of course, but it doesn't address the fundamental
issue of the separation of programs from data.  Ye Gods, this is
2010, and this is hardly a new or a revolutionary proposal, even
if Microsoft have done their d at mndest to make it impossible with
Windows 7 :-(

Absolutely: we have to balance the cost of "improvement" in terms of development
time and all the bugs (= annoyance to users) that would not fail to happen if we
did such a big change, between what it would actually bring to the users. Here,
the cost would be huge, since we'd be touching at two fundamental things: kpse
and tlmgr, so the benefits should be huge in order to compensate.

Sorry, but I can't see huge benefits here, besides you stating that the question
is fundamental.

George N. White gave a practical example, with shared folders, which is IMO a
much stronger argument than just stating that the question is fundamental. But I
still don't see it changing in the foreseeable future.

For testing

set TEXMFSCRIPTS=.;

in the current command prompt. That's what I do. Or you can add this
to the top texmf.cnf if you prefer.

Are you talking about TL or in general? I keep a close watch on where
our config data go and bug the rest of the team (and also 3rd party
contributors) whenever they are tempted to put something outside of TL
managed locations: TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR. You can move these two
trees to another location, make corresponding changes in texmf.cnf and
you are good to go.

Some time ago, there was a problem with AR started from texlua, only if the
texlua script was itself started using our texlua wrapper script from then. I
don't remember the details, but it boiled down to something like:

kpse.set_program_name(arg[-1])
os.exec('texlua foo.lua')

with foo.lua containing:

os.execute('start foo.pdf')

failing badly when AR (a certain version) was associated with pdf files. If you
changed the os.exec in os.execute, or didn't initialize kpse before, the problem
disappeared.

So it would be worth checking if the problem depends on whether tl's perl.exe is
called directly from the command line, or indirectly through the wrapper.

I hope we don't have an occurrence of a similar problem, since at that time
nobody had the slightest idea what was going on.

Do you remember who reported this problem? Was it Uwe Siart by any
chance (then I might have an idea what was it)?

In the future, we might offer a windows-specific installer in the form of a
self-extracting executable (since objectively, the zip/move to dir/run a bat
file way isn't familiar to most users). I have no objection to call it
setup-texlive.exe if it can make windows user happier :-)

I must admit that such names without vowels are rather Unixish (the mostly
recall of the C library or POSIX function names, which is probably not the
definition of windows-user-friendly).

It costs essentially nothing to change the windows title to something like "TeX
Live manager" which is the full name of tlmgr anyway, and again, if you think it
makes users happier...

Well, as a matter of personal taste, I don't like the Tk look on X11, I find it
less bad on windows, but yeah, it doesn't feel really native. I'm under the
impression that Wxwidgets and Qt look more native, or at least more mainstream,
but changing the toolkit essentially means rewriting the interface (and other
changes), so I don't see it happening, sorry.

Anyway, thanks for your remarks.

Manuel.

which perl is this?

as far as I can see I cannot just run 'perl' when the only thing I have 
installed is TeXLive, the tlperl is hidden inside and not really 
available for the outside.

cmd.exe does not respond to it.

I can get things executed using runscript though, so perhaps we are 
doing down too many subshells for ARs liking

the interesting part is also that AR does react, by telling that some 
error occured. But not really mentioning what error.

Yes, it is hidden. I added a wrapper for it for my own use.

Does it give any error code?

Do you have start or start.exe in your path by any chance?

The culprit in texdoc case was the shell script from MSYS named
'start' (Manuel, is this the problem you had in mind?):

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-July/021290.html

If you will provide me with exact instructions/scripts leading to AR
failure, I will try to reproduce it and track down the problem. Which
version of AR do you have?

Cheers,

Tomek

When I need to test something with tlperl on windows, I usually just call it
with full path, like c:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\tlperl\bin\perl.exe. I'm not sure if
it's equivalent to the wrapper way, but it seems to work.

Nope, this was another one. /me is digging... got it:

See also:

I have exactly the same issue, the only difference being that the error message is still appearing under Ubuntu.

On WinXP:

it simply says, "Internal error occured" (or similar, this laptop is 
runing in danish)

AR 9

it suggests sending MS an error report, along with it an error report 
with a lot of odd information

The offending command

latexmk -pdf -pv test.tex

for some compilable test.tex

I think that the most important thing is that one can guess from the
filename what a particular program is supposed to do.  On the Windows
machine at work I recently searched for "setup.exe" and found more
than hundred files with this name.  Don't know what they are supposed
to do and where they come from.  I don't think that we make Windows
users happier if we do everything exactly as they are used.

And I'm sure that the word "install" is clear enough and even
unexperienced Windows users understand what it means.

  s/install/setup/

makes sense if we assume that Windows users are unable to read but are
familiar with patterns like "setup".  But should TeX Live assume that
Windows users are idiots?

The opposite is the case.  Many filenames under Windows are very
cryptic in order to fit into the 8.3 scheme.  The situation did not
improve significantly after longer filenames were allowed because
programmers want to maintain backwards compatibility.  The names of
Unix programs are traditionally very short because Unix provides a
very powerful CLI and people don't want to type long names.

The title bar in figure 9 already contains the string "TeX Live
Manager 2009" but I think that the caption of figure 9 should be
changed in the documentation:

  Figure 9: TeX Live Manager in GUI mode. 

Ulrike, I know that you are using MikTeX but I didn't expect that you
never tried TeX Live yourself because you are on this mailing list.

However, what you can't know then is that the TeX Live installer
creates several shortcuts in the start menu.  You can invoke tlmgr
from there without being bothered by its filename.  And I assume that
most Windows users invoke tlmgr from the start menu and not from the
command line.

The main problem is that we can't assume that those interfaces are
already installed on all platforms supported by TeX Live.  The
installer and tlmgr were written in Perl because we can assume that
Perl already exists on all Unix systems and we have to provide a Perl
distribution only for Windows.

And there is one thing we always have to keep in mind:  TeX Live is a
multi-platform system.  It should behave identically on all supported
platforms.  You can install it on a Unix server and mount it on
clients running any operating system supported by TeX Live.  This is
definitely TeX Live's strength.  It's much easier to achieve with TeX
Live rather than with MikTeX.  See:

 http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb27-1/tb86kroonenberg-miktex.pdf

I don't worry so much about the "look and feel" because TeX is a
commandline tool anyway.  TeX Live provides very few GUI programs.
I'm convinced that TeX Live supports Windows very well.  What always
bothers me is that some people assume that unless TeX Live provides a
Windows-like "look and feel" it can't recommended to Windows users.

But I strongly disagree.  It's impossible to provide reasonable
support for Windows and simultaneously treat Windows users as idiots.

Regards,
  Reinhard

These are definitely false positives.  However, I have little hope
that these scanners will get ever fixed, so I recompiled the binaries
in question with a different tool chain and now they pass through all
39 scanners on www.virustotal.com.  Please try and report any
problems.

My pretty fresh TeX Live 2009 install shows up in 3 places (I'm very
happy to have it in my C root, so please don't bug me on that. and
yes, I'm usually a deepnester, who likes to build elaborate directory
trees):
C:\texlive\2009
C:\texlive\texmf-local
C:\Documents and Settings\DCN\.texlive2009\texmf-var

Directory listing of the last is attached. According to you, the last
should not exist? I'd be happt if its all in C:\texlive\texmf-local
indeed, Or am I misunderstanding the philosophy behind the two and are
you referring to behavior outside these directories?

I too think that anybody capable of using TeX would also be capable of
using a command line. I also think that it does not matter whether the
install script is a .bat or a .exe. As long as it is clearly
identified in the manual and a user knows how to double-click, there
should be no problem. A program does not need to look like windows for
a user to be able to use it. As long as a button looks like a button
and the text printed on it is clear in meaning, one should be fine.

I don't see the point in spending lots of energy on making the windows
side of tex live look more like windows. Catering to users who get
homesick as soon as there is something slightly non-windows on the
screen should not be a priority. Besides, TeX Live runs great on
windows. Being a windows user myself with virtually no unix-like
experience, TeX Live still feels great to me. Having recently switched
from MikTeX, I'm also happy to say that it feels like TeX Live
produces my documents significantly faster.

Anyway, keep up the good work and please focus on more important
development issues than making windows users feel at home.

Best,
Dee

Yes it should exists, because the default setting in texmf.cnf is
	~/.texlive2009/texmf-var
which expands to the above.

If you want it somewhere else add a line in
	c:\texlive\2009\texmf.cnf
for
	TEXMFVAR = ....
	TEXMFCONFIG = ....

Yes, you do.

texmf, texmf-dist, texmf-local, texmf-var, texmf-config in c:\texlive\2009
are the system wide directories. Even on a Windows system there
can be more than one user.

The last one plus ..../.texlive2009/texmf-config are user specific
directories.

Agreed.

Allright, thanks for the clarification (forgot to attach that
directory listing of my user directory, but it would be of no interest
I see now).

BTW, why if I hit reply do I reply to the person that send a message
to the mailing list and not to the mailing list itself? Is this a

Configuration of the mailing list headers, I usually use group-reply
which honors (in mutt) the settings of the senders. So if you
but a mail-follow-up header into the email it will be honored.
mutt also knows list-reply so that is easy, too.

You simply have to use a good MUA ;-) and neither thunderbird, nor 
outlook nor anything else I know qualifies for that ;-)

Best wishes

Hmm, I see. I'm on the gmail web interface which plays nicely with all

No offense taken, maybe my words came over a bit harsh, but I only
tried to explain that our situation is due to the fact of multi-arch
support not that simple as for a windows only product. Actually some
of your suggestions concerning documentation and wording will
hopefully be taken into account (I am not one of the doc writers,
fortunately ;-)

I think here the contribution of each and everyone here is asked for.

TeX Live is not a project of the few people around Karl, but everyone
can contribute. All the documentation sources are available and
easily accessible. Same with the source code of all the programs.

We simply don't have the (wo)man power do work on all fronts, and
the I must say IMHO enormously improved situation on Windows is
only due to Tomek, who joined some time ago with some very
simple suggestions about improvements, and then somehow got caught
and sticked (how happy I am about that!!!)

Room for improvements there always is, and contributions are taken
with open arms.

Best wishes

I think that this in some way reflects on Ulrike's recent
contributions to this thread.  There may be (almost certainly
are) a large number of programmers and retired programmers
who could contribute to the project, but to whom a startinging
point of "something like apt-get/dpkg" is completely meaningless.

Perhaps if you could outline, on-list, what needs to be done
in everyday English (yes, I know it's not your first language,
but you're pretty good at it !), rather than in crypto-speak
("something like apt-get/dpkg"), you would attract significantly
more volunteers.

Now --- http://tezcatl.fciencias.unam.mx/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet wasn't updated for several days, so tlmgr picked other repositories; today it got updated..., and the problems got back. It starts with

> TLDownload::get_file: response error:

I first updated Ubuntu... and it took about an hour to update 16 packages. Then I tried with Fedora, same mirror (tezcatl.fciencias.unam.mx) and everything was done in one minute and ten seconds!

Then I did a dry-run on Debian ---same thing as on Ubuntu:

> tlmgr update --persistent-downloads --self --all --dry-run

> TLDownload::get_file: response error:

So I chose another repository:

> tlmgr --repository http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet update --self --all


It took about 6 minutes, but completed without errors. Lastly, I updated the Mac with the default repository (tezcatl.fciencias.unam.mx), and it completed in one minute six seconds!

So something is happening with Debian/Ubuntu in *some repositories*.

Best,

Axel

I think that Norbert already explained the directory structure
sufficiently.  The point I was trying to make is that programs that
are distributed with TeX Live, should (and do) respect TL directory
structures, so everything can be managed globally by TL [*].

Cheers,

Tomek

[*] There is only one exception that I know of (Asymptote), where the
user settings are written outside of TL directories by default,
however, this can be reconfigured in texmf.cnf as expelained at
http://www.tug.org/texlive/portable.html.

I quite strongly disagree here. Look at what exists on the Mac with TeXshop and
MacTeX. I can assure you it counts for users. If TeXworks is developed and
shipped with TL on windows, it's for a reason. IMO, TeX shouldn't be reserved to
command-line lovers but rather be made more accessible and less frightening to
more users.

I don't think that caring about details and the look and feel of a software
distribution is treating users as idiots (regardless of the underlying OS).

It is not so much a question of the intelligence of different
categories of users
but one of finding a balance between the "comfort level" of developers and that
of users on all the different platforms.   What many users forget is that they
only have TeXLive due to the efforts of the developers, so it is in the users'
interest to have developers spending time and energy on things that matter.

It would be good to have some "use cases".   The users I encounter are all
scientists, some who used MS Office until they encountered a project
where the manuscript has to be provided in LaTeX form, others who have
used TeX for nearly 2 decades still prefer plain over latex (because latex as
too big for their early MS-DOS machine or because they don't like the
default appearance of the article class.  The MS Office users often have
a sample .tex file provided by the publisher, but find it impossible to get
LaTeX working without help.   They ask around and are told to "get WinEDT"
or "get MikTeX".

Some sites provide systems "pre-configured" with, e.g., WinEDT and some
TeX system -- those users come away with the impression that WinEDT contains
TeX.

It would be nice to have some documents or youtube videos that show
the MS Office users how to format the publisher's sample, starting with
installing a TeX distro.

An important use case is  people who come to TeX because they want
to use some 3rdparty tools (e.g., sagemath, building systems from source
where the documentation comes in .tex form, etc.).  These all go beyond
the normal bounds of a TeX distribution.   They tend to work smoothly on
current  Apple or linux systems, but are not easy to achieve in (native)
Windows.

I gather there are many other use cases, but most are outside my
experience.

One may care about such details, but still make the choice to spend energy
on other parts of the project.   I prefer my car to look nice, but
first it has to
run.

It's a bit better these days as both TL and MiKTeX come with TeXworks
editor.  I consider this a big step forward usability-wise.

There is video course a bit like that on CTAN, it's just not very well known:

But the user experience here is largely up to the developers of these

we can't (usually) persuade people to use sensible names for their
packages on ctan, so we don't often try.

(exception, i had an upload on sunday whose name was single to another's
plural: i mentioned the problem and the author re-edited and uploaded
again within the hour.  kudos to that man.)

meanwhile, we make do with the name for the 4th edition of george's
organ.

I agree with you that s/tl/texlive/ is useful but I don't understand
why you prefer s/bat/exe/ at all.  The Widows Exploder suppresses
filename extensions by default anyway.

I don't object if people adapt GUIs for particular systems.  But I
don't think that anybody avoids TeX Live only because tlmgr's Perl/Tk
interface doesn't provide color gradients in title bars.

Unfortunately I don't have a Mac.  As far as I understand MacTeX
adapts tlmgr's GUI.  But is tlmgr's CLI kept intact?  I hope so.

But if you are concerned about color gradients in title bar
backgrounds, you actually treat users as idiots.  Sorry.

Well, said this way, obviously not. But the look and feel (and in particular,
feeling "at home") is an important part of the user experience IMO.

tlmgr is intact, including its gui (but, as I understand it, the gui will only
work for people who previously installed Perl/Tk hence X11, not installed by
default, and I'm not sure which proportion of OS X user it represents). But
another GUI is provided, named TeX Live Utility, which looks like it belong on a
Mac (or so I heard, never had the occasion to test myself, yet). I'm not even
sure if TLU is included in MacTeX or has to be installed independently.

Still disagree. Not only idiots appreciate good-looking apps. Not only idiots
are sometimes afraid by computer stuff, and need to be reassured by a familiar look.

But there's no point in discussing this further, I'm sure neither of us will
change our mind about it. So, I'll try to stop arguing (which is sometimes
difficult for me (stopping, not arguing)) and get some actual work done instead.

Manuel.

PS: I happen to have color gradients in the current theme of my window manager.
However, my friends keep being afraid of my computer for some mysterious reason.
(I mean, zsh with vi keybindings is *very* user-friendly.)

I agree completely.  For example, Google Earth (Qt, I believe) just doesn't feel right on Mac OS X.  There are small inconsistencies in appearance and behavior that add up to an overall feeling that it just doesn't belong.  It's difficult for users to trust a GUI that doesn't work the way they expect.

Correct.  The CLI is intact and works out of the box, but Perl/Tk has to be installed manually.

Screenshots here:

http://code.google.com/p/mactlmgr/wiki/GettingStarted

There are some warts, notably the wrong toolbar icons, but it has a more native look-and-feel than a Perl/Tk application (and I mean no offense to Norbert or other TL developers when I say that).

It is included in MacTeX, but can be installed independently or used with any TeX Live install.

I think Manuel is absolutely right, and I also think you'll find far more users of this type on Mac OS X and Windows.  It's not so much about color gradients, but all of the little things that add up to an overall distrust of an application.

I don't think I'm an idiot (I may be, but I guess I'll never know), yet
the main reason I don't use tlmgr GUI is that I never liked how Tk apps
look, even on Linux they don't look like anything else on my system; I
use the command line utility instead.

In my experience, Perl/Tk is fragile on MacOSX.   It worked for tlmgr
early on, but now:

$ tlmgr --gui
no event type or button # or keysym at
/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/Tk/Widget.pm line 1105.
 at /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 222
Compilation failed in require at /usr/texbin/tlmgr line 3193.

A simple script works:

#!/usr/bin/env perl

use Tk;
use strict;
use warnings;

my $mw = new MainWindow;
$mw->title( 'Hello' );

$mw->Label( -text => 'Hello World' )->pack;
$mw->Button( -text => "Done", -command => sub { exit } )->pack;

MainLoop;

Sophos now reports all files in bin/win32 to be clean.  Many thanks.
I was going to try to get a false positive report to Sophos but it would 
first have to go through my IT dept (@ drofnats.edu) and that would have 
taken
a long time.  Your approach of rebuilding with different tools was much 
more efficient, I'm sure.

Thanks again,

Howdy,

I wonder if there is a (very) preliminary list of goals and changes for TL-2010? I know it's early but it would be good to get prepared to test (as best I can!) those changes.

Good Luck,

Simple answer: Nothing fundamentally. Those following the normal updates
will probably not see much changes.

Recently some Japanese-specific TeX programs have been added to the build
system so they will show up in 2010, but you will not need them.

At some point before 2010, probably not during the normal running updates
(but that is not decided) we will switch to strawberry perl, but some
things have to resolved before we can do that.

I think that is it ... sorry to be so disappointing, but actually we are
quite happy that not more changes are coming in ;-)

Best wishes

Are there plans to make luatex updates available to tlmgr? That would seem like a quite substantial improvement to me.

A new BibTeX IS news! It's been only more than 20 years... :-}

No XeTeX 1., though.

Hello,

what about the protected shell-escape mode by default (for eps2pdf)? Are 
there any news on this topic?

Thank you,

That's one of the major goals of this release. It seems to be going just fine,
this time.

Another new item is that formats that output directly a PDF file will default to
PDF 1.5 with object streams compressed. A LaTeX package will be provided to
switch back to pdf 1.4 when needed.

Unless I'm mistaken, there is no technical problem with the current
insfrastructure concerning binaries updates. The fact that we don't ship newer
binaries for LuaTeX more than once a year is rather a matter of policy. We want
to avoid problems with binaries changing too fast, and besides, we don't have an
automated build infrastructure, so building TeX Live binaries is a non-trivial task.

Besides, even if we decided to update binaries between major versions (which I'm
not saying we're likely to do, just do be clear), we'd probably only ship
"stable" betas of LuaTeX (0.X0.y), and there are not so many of them between two
yearly TL releases (TL 2010 had 0.40.6, TL2010 is going to ship 0.60.x, only
0.50 is "missing").

Also note that it is rather easy to grab a LuaTeX binary for your platform from
the ConTeXt minimals distribution (linked from
<http://luatex.org/download.html>) and install it on top of your TL
installation. Here are instructions (in French, sorry, but I can attempt a quick
translation if you need one):

http://weblog.elzevir.fr/2009/02/integrer-un-luatex-recent-a-tex-live/

I'm using this setup daily (also with locally compiled LuaTeX binaries) and
never had the slightest problem with it.

Manuel.

Another reason is that binaries for various platforms are compiled by
different people.  It always takes a certain amount of time until all
problems are solved and binaries for all supported platforms are
available.   It would be too time-consuming to update binaries more
than once a year.

But the main problem is in luatex specific packages which either have to
maintain compatibility with luatex shipped binaries (which is a waste of
effort giving the rapid development of luatex) or not update texlive
versions, leaving the users alone to hunt the interwoven dependencies
(also installing macro packages is not as simple as updating binaries).

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr updates
Message-ID: <201004182208.o3IM8ITt011039@f7.net>

Norbert has been adding more refinements to tlmgr.  Since the last
update, we have:

  * do not auto-install packages contained in forcibly removed collections.
  * tlmgr restore --all: restoring the latest, using all available backups.

  * GUI: provide simple and expert modes (Options->Expert options)
  * GUI: provide access to the manual (tlmgr help) in the Help menu
  * GUI: add support for restore action.
  * GUI: add support for the three command line options: --no-auto-install,
    --no-auto-remove (under Menu->Options), and --reinstall-forcibly-removed
    (just below the "Update all installed" button).  The first two in
    "expert" mode only, as I understand it.

If anyone would like to test this out of tlcritical now, that would be
great.  Barring problems, we will release it to the main repository soon.

Thanks,
Karl

And, of course, biber ?

An update to xindy would also be nice, since it currently has serious issues with hyperref.

Karl said earlier that it's not likely that biber will ever get
included because of complicated dependencies.

Actually, what he said was in no way so absolute:

And while I understand some of the problems included, I think that this project is of great importance to LaTeX in general; getting beyond BibTeX's limitations is overdue.

Well ... biber is not in by now, and I am not sure it will be, as
already discussed. It would be great to have it, but please remember
	* TeX Live is NOT an Operating System *
we cannot make any program work and ship a huge amount of dependencies.

Our aim with TeX Live is to keep a consisten set of binaries/programs so
that it behaves the same way on all systems. That means we have to get
all the stuff compiling on all systems. This is already a pain ... dragging
in another big big set of dependencies does not make it simpler.

> An update to xindy would also be nice, since it currently has serious issues with hyperref.

But that has not been resolved by now??? Or am I wrong? AFAIS the Debian
package still has a RC bug with the comment "as long as this is not
fixed no xindy will enter testing" or so.

I do understand these problems, but as I said in another post: I think biber/biblatex is one of the really important additions that has happened to LaTeX for quite some time. BibTeX's limitations have been known for years, and now that we finally have a working solution which finally takes the whole concept into the modern age, not including it into TL would be areal shame.

Sure, biber is really exciting, and we all want it included in TL. That doesn't
make it easier to include, so we just can't promise anything now.

TeX Live only includes material from CTAN, as a general rule. Also, we insist
that all the distributed material is covered by a free licence. So, if you want
these fonts in TeX Live, a good starting point is to make sure they are free and
get them on CTAN.

Btw, XeTeX is able to use fonts from the system, so you can just install these
fonts "the normal way" for your system, and use them from XeTeX. (Same for
LuaTeX with luaotfload.sty, btw).

Thanks. Hereby the request if other people from the TeX Live community 
are also interest in helping out packaging these fonts.

My system with TeX Live can already work with these fonts. The intention 
is to make this more generic and reusable for others too.

There is nothing about packaging here. You should do the following things
(as Manuel wrote):
- check that the license is free
- make sure that the files are uploaded to CTAN

After that they will quite probably appear in TeX Live automatically

We are working on integrating pTeXLive at least partially here, so that 
might be of use for you, too.

No, this is not resolved. xindy and the current version of
hypperref are incompatible and will remain so for the forseeing future.

This incompatibility is documented (p.678 in TLC2, also explanation
of xindy/MakeIndex differences in xindy by topic), and it does not
only concern hyperref, but also memoir in some use cases. A problem
is that this documentation is not seen by most people, and if they
see it, the connotation is missing that this is relevant for
hyperref and memoir.

To make that clear: hypperref's linked index implementation works
only with MakeIndex, not with xindy; and to change that would
probably be a major enhancement in xindy. Well, maybe someone finds
a workaround, but I don't hold my breath for that. That's because
Heiko uses one feature of MakeIndex where xindy introduced an
incompatibility to implement other enhanced features.

For those who are interested: It's about the differing meaning of
`bbb' in \index{aaa|bbb}. In MakeIndex, this is an arbitrary string
that is output with a leading backslash. In xindy, `bbb' is a
`location class' that must be defined and where its processing can
be influenced. E.g., one may define if such `bbb' references are
dropped or additionaly mentioned when the same location appears in
another class or in a page range of another class. As an example:
If I have a page range 10-20, I may want to drop an index entry on
page 15 with location class `hint', but may want to introduce an
additional entry if the index entry has location class
`definition'. One can also define if location classes shall be
mixed, or if they shall be listed seperately. That's because in
xindy locations are structured objects where their semantic go
beyond mere page numbers, as in MakeIndex.

I.e., that current hypperref's index links don't work with xindy is
not a bug, it's the result of *intented* behaviour. It would be
nice if one could support hypperref's index links, but that would
be an enhancement, i.e., the introduction of a new feature
`location class attributes'. For now, if one wants to use hyperref
and xindy together, one has to turn off index links.

Already discussed several times, they don't bring much advantage at all,
and at times are slower (at least on Windows 64bit). If the 32bit 
versions are running fine there is no need -- or do you have so big
documents to address?

I know this is not the place to request a packaeg. I was hoping to find 
people that would like to help. I need at least a native Japanese 
speaker to understand all the download pages to figure out the licenses. 
Hoped to find one here... perhaps via the pTeXLive connection. I will 
also post a request to find people to help on the main TeX list.

Thanks so far,

Pander

Sorry about asking that again.

I was just curious and also I have almost zero 32bit apps on my system,
TeX being the only one.

Yes, hyperref has fixed a major flaw in the user interface:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{makeidx}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \makeindex
  \begin{document}
  \section{Hello World}
  \index{hello|textbf}
  \printindex
  \end{document}

Works now automatically.

Previously it didn't work out of the box, manual intervention
is necessary:

  \newcommand*{\indexbf}[1]{\textbf{\hyperpage{#1}}}
  \index{hello|indexbf}

An andvanced user can manage this, but the |-part can be
hidden inside a package (see doc.sty). I tested with Makeindex
and thought it would be a subset of XIndy.
  However I don't want to go back (maintaining two versions;
another option -- there are already too many; much to document --
nobody has time for this, ...)

Perhaps it's easier to implement a mapping between
the full location argument and the location class?
Example:

  \indexentry{hello|hyperindexformat{\textbf}}{1}

Location class would be "textbf".

Bummer .. it is not shipped by default, you are right, my failure.

The problem is that I treid to capture the help text using
	Pod::Text
and to get this into a scalar instead of directly into stdout
I had to use Io::String, but that is not available at your place.

I will try to find a solution for it ... but in the meantime please
take the attached IO/String.pm and put it into the search path
somewhere, I hope it will work.

    Already discussed several times, they don't bring much advantage at all,

While this is true, the fact is, people want them and Dick is building
them.  So providing them has the non-technical advantage that people
will stop asking about them :).  The technical advantage is that people
have reported some (not most) documents running noticeably faster
(meaning 1 second instead of 2, as far as Dick and I can tell, but anyway).

So I expect we will include 64-bit Snow Leopard binaries in TL'10.  This
is better than continuing the separate distribution we did last year,
since the additions of new scripts, etc., in the bin dir can be managed
as usual.

Resistance is futile,
karl

There is a potential workaround and a better solution.

Currently, xindy has the restriction that the stuff after | must be
an identifier. The workaround would be to lift that restriction and
allow arbitrary character sequences as location attributes. Most
probably that would work as I don't see anything in the code that
prevents it.

The solution would be to recognize entries of the form
{KEY|LOCATTR{BALANCED_MATERIAL}} and make available the
BALANCED_MATERIAL to the markup output definition of LOCATTR. That
is the major enhancement that I'm speaking of. It would not only
help compatibility to hyperref, but also to memoir.

But that goes beyond TL issues and is probably off-topic on this list.

     Dear all,

         indeed, copying String.pm in /opt/texlive/2009/tlpkg/IO/ fixes 
the issue.

             Thanks again for all your work,

Please not. I asked the author of the caption package: subfig is
unmaintained, but it's license allows only the author to fix it (one
should free it according to the LPPL).

He suggests using subfigure or subcaption instead of subfig.

which problems with memoir is it you are talking about. I use memoir and 
texindy and do not seem to have problems.

The only two problems I have with texindy is the stuff mentioned above 
and at least some switch such that $ and \$ (and similar) is not mapped 
to the same item.

Usage of memoir's \specialindex is not supported. The same problem
exists also for tex4ht, I forgot to mention that.

See
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1326629&group_id=10646&atid=360646

Hu? $ is ignored, as it is TeX markup, and \$ is mapped to `$'. They
are not mapped to the same item:

    \indexentry{$a$}{1}
    \indexentry{\$}{1}
    \indexentry{\$a}{1}

results in

  \lettergroupDefault{default}
  \item \$, 1
  \item \$a, 1

  \indexspace

  \lettergroup{A}
  \item $a$, 1

as it should be.

What happens is that index entries of form '\foo' and '\bar' where
neither explicit print keys are given nor merge-rules are specified,
are merged to the same entry. That's because one has to tell texindy
what's behind \foo and \bar, what they resolve into, so that texindy
can sort them. Remember: texindy is supposed to sort the stuff that
the reader sees, not the stuff that LaTeX outputs.

it would be a good thing.  (but the recommendation itself is a bit odd.)

i can add words of warning in the catalogue, but changing readme files
requires the author's permission, since the package is lppl.

martin, were you implying that you're in contact with sdc?

Subject: [tex-live] Problems using Asymptote on Cygwin [TL2009]
Message-ID: <4BCD855B.3080606@alice.it>

On Cygwin (TL2009 for i386-cygwin), I have tried what suggested by 
user's manual: texmf/doc/asymptote/asymptote.pdf at page 82:

$ latex latexusage
$ asy latexusage

Here 'asy' seems to hang (40%-50% of CPU) and soon I find a 
'pdftex.exe.stackdump' file, which is not good...

Besides this, Asymptote creates an '.asy' directory in 'C:/Documents and 
Settings/user' instead that in /home/user, as it should be on Cygwin... 
It looks as if it is using USERPROFILE (a typical 'Windows native' 
environment variable) instead of HOME (which is used in an unix-like 
environment as Cygwin).

Are we sure that the Asymptote binaries shipped with TL2009 Cygwin 
binaries are not mixing Cygwin with Windows native (Mingw!?, perhaps!)?

Ciao,
Angelo.

The asymptote binary shipped with the TL2009 Cygwin binaries is 
identical with the native Windows binary.  I never succeeded in doing a 
proper Cygwin build.  Maybe I'll try again for TL2010, but it will be a 
while before I can get to this.

Looks like an Asymptote problem.  Most people who never used Cygwin
themselves assume that Cygwin just allows you to run Unix programs
under Windows (like MSYS) and don't know that it's a self-contained
Unix-like environment.

However, I suppose that the files in the .asy directory is platform
independent.  Then it's wortwhile to consider $TEXMFHOME/asy instead.
Suppose you have a multi-platform TeX Live system installed on your
USB stick.  Then you certainly don't want to have these files on your
hard drive.

Yes, see below.  MinGW uses MSVCRT.DLL.

Indeed! :(

I have tried this (with current sources):

$ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/asyinst --enable-texlive-build

First problem:
[...]
checking for fpu_control.h... no
configure: WARNING: *** Broken rpc headers; XDR support disabled ***

Second problem:

Really Cygwin has libglu32.a in /usr/lib/w32api... I have tried to add 
LDFLAG=/usr/lib/w32api, but with no success.

Another observation:

Ok. We assume to build without OpenGL:

Sorry, I used confusing terminology.  I shouldn't have said it's a 
native Windows binary.  What I meant was that it's the same binary that 
John Bowman built for the TL2009 Win32 distribution (using Cygwin tools 
and linked against cygwin1.dll).  But, being intended for Windows, it 
doesn't use Unix-style paths, which leads to the issues that Angelo 
reported.

It probably wouldn't be a big deal to tweak Bowman's build to make a 
Cygwin binary that integrates better into the Cygwin environment.  But I 
couldn't quite get it to work, and I didn't think it was worth a lot of 
effort at the time.

We had a discussion back then, where to put asy config files.  I was
for $TEXMFCONFIG tree (by default under $HOME or $USERPROFILE), where
we put all other config files, but I failed to convince others at the
time and asy retained its defaults also in TL builds.  There was
ASYMPTOTE_HOME variable added instead that can be configured in
texmf.cnf to repoint asy config location to a different place.

While I can agree on using subcaption instead of subfigure, there's nothing
in the README file of subfig suggesting that the package is unmantained;
actually it starts with

MANIFEST:
---------
  The following files as well as the derivative files `subfig.sty' and
  `altsf.cfg' constitute the subfig package and are considered as "the
  work" under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL 1.3 or later).

You can check on CTAN (<http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/>).
Axel Sommerfeldt was wrong.

It hasn't been updated since 2005/07/05 (nearly five years), and it is
"author-maintained", so there's no way to switch the maintainer
without the consent of the author (please check the LPPL).

if it's unmaintained, such things aren't necessarily reliable.

you think we didn't?

i don't know whether axel was right or wrong.  i don't believe we have
evidence either way (essentially no-one bothers to tell ctan that
they've stopped supporting their packages -- i can think of only two
people who have notified us, in all the time i've been co-running ctan).

the only way we can actually answer the question is to attempt to
contact dr cochran; i'll try that later tonight.

So, to clarify: subfigure is obsolete, subfig _was_ it's replacement
but it's also (likely) unmaintained and subcaption is the way to go?

I'm interested in knowing this too so that in future I can choose a more

Hi everybody,

first of all I am really glad to read your comments, thanks. I thought 
subfig was the best choice. Anyway, I will probably switch to subcaption.

Whether subfig is maintained or not, why not fixing beamer to allow 
subfig? Is there any drawback?

Because beamer is also unmaintained?

the difference is that beamer is gpl, so one could in principle "just
take it over".  finding someone to do it is likely to take longer than
getting till t's agreement, so one might as well ask for it, for
politeness' sake.

    It hasn't been updated since 2005/07/05 (nearly five years), and it is
    "author-maintained", so there's no way to switch the maintainer
    without the consent of the author (please check the LPPL).

As you know, Martin, the LPPL defines an explicit process to switch
maintainers in the absence of an active author.  So, as Robin said, you
are actually in touch with Cochran, so you know he's not absent?  Cool,
if so.

More importantly, anyone (whether the lppl maintainer or not) can
release a modified version (otherwise the lppl would certainly not be a
free software license).  And the filenames do not have to be changed.
What has to be changed is that the files unambiguously identify
themselves as modified versions, etc.  (Section 6 of the LPPL.)

Of course, it would be better to talk to Cochran and get him to
explicitly abandon it, hopefully in favor of someone else.

The most important question is, is anyone actually proposing to take
over subfig?

Switching the maintainer doesn't work if the package is "author-maintained". :-(

Message-ID: <t2yed4892841004210149j8fd93217rc9a7a1629e7f249d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, experts

I did some upgrade on my system, may be my cygwin, may be texlive
iteself.  It happened several weeks ago and I am not so sure about
what part of upgrading leads to the problem.

The beamer presentations (even those provided as samples with beamer
package) can not be compiled any more.  I use pdflatex, if the
presentation contains more than one frame, it will produce an error:

! Incompatible list can't be unboxed.

But all my beamer documents worked before!   Where should I come to
find information?

Thanks.

Hi Jindrich,

check the recent thread "Changes for 2010?" Biber has been discussed there and the bottom line is: Probably not due to the complicated dependencies.

surely, linux distros are in a better position to provide a separate
biber (rpm|deb) than tl is to provide one of its packages?

the problem is the large number of perl dependencies, which is surely
"run of the mill" for you, but definitely stressful for tl.

and in any case, you could surely put a biber rpm on the road well
before tl 2010 is likely to be released?

Dear Sir/Ma'am,

Recently I realized that Korean language collection for TeXLive was missing
in Fedora.
collection-kotex ( <http://ftp.ktug.or.kr/KTUG/texlive/2009>
http://ftp.ktug.or.kr/KTUG/texlive/2009 )
Therefore, I asked Fedora, and the below is the reply from him.

The reason that Fedora could not package collection-kotex is that
collection-kotex was
not included in the upstream metadata (
ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb )

It would be really helpful Korean Fedora/TeXLive user if the collection
could be included in Fedora.
Would you consider including collection-kotex into the upstream metadata?

The collection-kotex can be easily installed through tlmgr, I don't think
there will be any problem.
But, iff you need any help to include collection-kotex into the metadata,
then please let me know.
I'll try to resolve any kind of issue as much as I can with KTUG staff.

Please let me know, and thanks in advance,
Seung Yeop

it seems that texlive-collection-kotex is not an offcial part of TeX
Live. Otherwise it would be included. The reason is that the upstream
metadata (ftp://ftp.ctex.org/mirrors/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb)
doesn't mention kotex collection at all. If you think that it should
be included, please mail to upstream: tex-live at tug.org. If they agree
and kotex will be included into metadata then it will occur in the
next Fedora repo update.

Thanks for heads-up,
Jindrich

I compiled biber on MacOSX and it was a bit tedious and annoying
experience as not only few perl modules biber depends on were missing
(it would be easy as biber can retrieve and install them on its own)
but they were depending on the modules which were also missing and ad
nauseum and  there biber could not help I was forced to go down.

I suspect that if TL includes biber it would be a full time job to
answer enquiries.

It's not possible to include something just in metadata.  It would
have to become a part of TeX Live.  For this to happen it has to be
free and on CTAN (there are additional requirements wrt binary tools).
 If these conditions are/can be met, then it can be included.

Thanks for your opinions. I haven't had any experiences with biber so
far so now I can at least guess why incorporating biber into TeX Live isn't
too good idea.

Thanks again!

Hi,
the best thing you can do is to ask the authors to put the collection
on CTAN.

One of the authors is obviously Dohyun Kim <nomosnomos at gmail.com>.

I don't understand Korean but they obviously discussed it last year:

  http://project.ktug.or.kr/pipermail/dev-kotex/2009-June/000024.html

There might be a problem regarding the kotex-utils.  It would be
easier if the two little C files were written in Perl. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

What have changed in mptopdf lately?

If I run

mptopdf file.mp

mptopdf not only leaves file without extension (same contents as 
file.mp), but it also changes file.mp!

Try this
cp file.mp copy.mp
mptopdf file.mp
diff file.mp copy.mp

This is quite anoying when working with emacs, because it complains that 
file.mp changed on disk

I find mptopdf to be very useful, but what is this behaviour good for?

Tested on the latest TL on Linux.

Test file if needed

beginfig(1);
draw fullcircle scaled 2cm;
endfig;
end;

diff responds

The problem seems to be with Perl.  I can't start AR9 from Perl at
all, always the same error as you see.  What's even more bizarre, I
can't start AR9 from any child process started from Perl!  So there is
something that is inherited from the perl.exe process that causes AR
to crash, but I have no clue what it might be and I couldn't find
anything suspicius in Perl's sources regarding process spawning.  I'm
out of ideas I'm afraid.

The problem appears to be AR9 specific.  I have no trouble starting AR8 in 
the same way.

Do you know whether the problem always occurs when a perl script tries to 
start AR9, or whether it only occurs if perl has been started by a TL 
wrapper program?  (I think there was a statement in an earlier message that 
the problem doesn't occur if perl is started from the command line.)

Just tested on my Win XP box, with up-to-date texlive-scripts, and foo.pl
containing only system('start doc.pdf') (PDF associated with AR9).

perl foo.pl works (perl.exe from Strawberry Perl found in the path)
c:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\tlperl\bin\perl.exe foo.pl works too

runscript tlperl foo.pl fails

I'm afraid this is related to our wrapper indeed.

I didn't test by installing foo.pl in a texmf tree with a wrapper in bin (which
would mean using our wrapper but with my strawberry perl instead of tlper unless
I'm mistaken), I htg now, but I can test later if needed.

On the contrary, one could also say that Victor's experiences speak in favor of the inclusion of Biber into TeX Live. Currently every Biber user has to compile it for themselves, and that is simply too unfriendly for normal users.

One can say everything but I suspect that what is annoying for the
user will be a programming nightmare. Even biber' authors went to some
length to attempt to install necessary modules.

Right but please have a look at the thread I pointed to in my previous post. The maintainers have made it quite clear that they are aware of all these arguments but will not include biber due to the dependencies.
Also, I have compiled biber on my Mac too and once I found out that you can very easily install per modules via cpan on the command line the compilation process was actually rather easy.

In principle, you're right that the more difficult the software is to install
from scratch, the more desirable it is to get it packaged in a distribution so
that the user doesn't have to go through the installation steps himself.

Unless I missed something, nobody from the TL team said we don't *want* to
include biber. We just said we're not sure when (and even if) we will be *able*
to include it due to the aforementioned technical difficulties. (What is sure is
that it won't be for TL2010, it's too late for that.)

Manuel.

I concur with Alex and Robin (as well as Norbert's comments in the 
previous thread "Changes for 2010?"): Incorporating Biber in TeX Live is 
definitely not feasible for TL 2010 and would require absurdly 
disproportionate efforts from the part of the TL maintainers. However we 
(the two Biber devs) have plans to solve this issue, hopefully before TL 
2011. The idea is to ship a single script with embedded PAR archive that 
will contain all dependencies. The only requirement to run it will then 
be Perl 5.8.x or later (with core modules). For that we need to first 
setup a robust build environment that will work on all platforms 
supported by TL. This is not a trivial task, but it is feasible.

For the time being we indeed encourage distributors to package Biber 
separately if they can (as it is already done for instance in Arch 
Linux: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=36407). Having packages 
for Fedora and Debian/Ubuntu would be nice too.

I should also point out to Victor that most of the outstanding 
installation problems reported in the past have been resolved, 
especially those concerning  the dependency Text::BibTeX (and its 
underlying btparse library), whose most recent version on CPAN now 
installs smoothly on most platforms (it used to have been nearly 
impossible to install on Windows, and was sometimes problematic on Mac 
OSX too). So it is definitely worth trying again with version 0.53. 
(Don't forget to run ./Build installdeps after running "perl Build.PL": 
that takes care of automatically installing all dependencies). If you 
still encounter problems, you are very much encouraged to report them on 
the Biber User Forum on SF: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/forums/forum/824416 . We 
will gladly help!

Best,
Fran?ois Charette

interesting because I did not have problems running

../tlperl/../perl.exe poc.pl

where poc.pl contains

system('start file.pdf');

Really? Quoting Norbert from the thread you mentioned:

	"Well ... biber is not in by now, and I am not sure it will be"

That doesn't mean we will never ever include biber. Please let us time to:

1. Prepare the release of TL 2010 quietly.
2. Look for solutions regarding biber afterwards.

As Fran?ois mentioned, compilation of biber and its dependencies is getting
smoother on major platforms and will probably continue to do so. It means
there's hope for the future.

So, please don't misinterpret what we say: "not now" and "we're not sure"
doesn't mean "we don't want to" or "will never happen".

Manuel.

PS: I agree with Robin and Fran?ois that it makes a lot of sense for Linux
distributions to build packages for biber without waiting for it to be included
in TL.

Well, I was running (sudo) ./Build installdeps

but it stumbled upon few things so I went to install them manually but
they had other dependencies missing or not as new as required and
probably this was a reason. So I went manually down the tree and
installed biber. True Text::BibTeX had most branching dependencies.

Sure, but whether Biber is pushed into TeX Live or not is not a matter
of taste.  There are severe technical problems and it doesn't matter
how many people ask for it.

Note that by default "./Build installdeps" will use cpan as a backend to 
install missing modules. But sometimes CPANPLUS can be more reliable. So 
you might prefer to do
     ./Build installdeps --cpan_client 'cpanp -i'
instead. See "perldoc Module::Build" for details.

Indeed, I was using perl through our wrapper.  I will investigate more tomorrow.

I got the same problem with strawberry, I'm afraid.

It's probably not Perl specific.  We encountered the same problem with
the texlua wrapper for texdoc.  We first assumed that the argument
vector had not been passed properly to AR.  I then read all the
related mails again carefully and found an interesting hint: The error
doesn't occur when AR is already running.  This means that the
argument vector can't be the culprit.  On the other hand, Manuel found
out that it made a difference whether the wrapper passed the arguments
as a list (os.spawn()) or as a string (os.execute()).

os.execute() is a Lua function which expects a string as an argument
and calls system(3) in order pass the request to a shell.  os.spawn()
is a function gratefully provided by Taco.  It passes its arguments as
a list to execvpe(3).

The Perl function system() also supports both, system(3) and
execvpe(3).  However, Perl tries to be smart, which makes debugging a
bit harder.  If you provide a string, system() always passes the
string to a shell.  If you provide a list, Perl decides itself whether
system(3) or execvpe(3) is more appropriate.

On Unix, execvpe() simply passes the argument list to the program it
executes.  On Windows, however, it converts the list to a string and
then the string back to a list again.  Of course, this breaks
arguments containing space characters.  The workaround is to quote
each argument.

The difference between Perl and texlua is that Perl automatically
quotes all arguments before they are passed to execvpe(3) while in
texlua you have to quote arguments yourself.  Under Windows at least.

If you can reproduce the problem with texlua, I think that debugging
is much easier because Lua is tiny.

However, I suppose that it's a Windows problem, quite unrelated to
Perl or texlua.  How execvpe() is implemented under Windows is
completely braindead and error-prone.

Another approach is to ask Adobe under which circumstances the error
message "Internal Error" is raised.  It's probably difficult to get in
contact with Adobe developers.  But you could ask Leonard Rosenthol.
I remember him as a maintainer of the PDF backend of ImageMagick but
for 3 or 4 years he is employed by Adobe as a PDF guru.  He's quite
open to TeX-related problems.

  Reinhard

Remember that installation from CPAN is not always a good idea. For
instance, if you now install PerlTk from CPAN to a RHEL4 based Linux,
it will not work because it requires newer version of modules. It is
not easy to undo all changes done during installation. However, if you
install PerlTk from the rpm prepared for RHEL4, everything works
because this rpm contains an older version compatible with the perl
modules shipped with RHEL4.

It does not mean that CPAN is unusable, I managed to install something
from CPAN to my CentOS4.

The question: if biber needs module A, and module A needs module B,
and B is not installed or is installed but has a lesser version than
required, will ./Build installdeps install B and then A? My impression
(I may be mistaken here) is that it is where the process stops and one
needs either to give up or to go manually.

For normal UNIX user it is a tedious and annoying but neither
complicated nor overly time consuming task. An average MacOS X however
never bothered to install DevTools and most likely has no idea what is
it and is afraid of the terminal.

You're right. As Manuel pointed out it seems to happen only if texlua
wrappers are used.  I will do more testing tomorrow.

Yes, I'm quite familiar by now how those things work in texlua and
perl.  Still, I'm really baffled how those problems can propagate
farther down to child processes.  I started cmd.exe from perl that was
spawned from texlua and AR9 just wouldn't run from that cmd.exe no
matter what (nor from any other process started from there).

This is definitely not the quoting problem.  I always pay special
attention to this, because this is such a PITA on Windows.

Indeed, the spawn* and exec* functions on Windows are absolutely
braindead to the point that makes you wonder whether they aren't
broken on purpose.

Anyway, if the problem is indeed related to os.spawn() in texlua, then
at least I know where to look.  I did patch that function not so long
ago, so I will try with the recent texlua build as well and see if
there's any difference.

Let's wait with bothering 3rd parties until we exhaust other options.
But I will keep that in mind, thanks.

Yeah, that's really amazing. Maybe something with the environment that would
propagate differently using spawn/exec vs execute?

And your experiment with lauching cmd.exe from wrapped-perl and trying to launch
AR from this cmd also proves that (if another proof was needed).

Quite easy:

Open a document, move it away and reload^1.
The result:
AR7.0.9/Linux, AR8/Linux: "An internal error occurred."

^1 uses a JavaScript file (Alexander Grahn, see CTAN:support/acrorelaodpdf)
to add this function:

var reloadCurrentDoc = app.trustedFunction(function(currentDoc) {
  app.beginPriv();
  var currentDocView=currentDoc.viewState;
  var currentDocPath=currentDoc.path;
  currentDoc.closeDoc();
  currentDoc=app.openDoc(currentDocPath);
  currentDoc.viewState=currentDocView;
  app.endPriv();
});

But I doubt that this is of much help here.

Yours sincerely

As one of the authors of kotex related packages,
I also eagerly want to upload kotex to CTAN.
There are, however, several issues blocking the upload,
one of which is that some macro files definitely rely on derivatives
of proprietary fonts.

Anyway, I will disscuss with other authors and push forward with
uploading kotex, or probably some part of kotex, to CTAN in due course.

Sincerely,

Did you use the cpan command for installation, or did you download
the modules by hand? The latter is a nightmare, the former should
work. Downloading CPAN modules is like installing rpm/deb packages
by hand without using apt/yum/zypper -- a nighmare of dependencies.

If anybody wants to know how to adapt cpan to install Perl modules
in user-specified directories, i.e., outside of system dirs -- I'm
willing to help with information and ready-to-use configuration
files. They solve two issues: (1) It's a way to collect CPAN
modules in a tree that one can ship later. (2) It doesn't update
system modules or vendor-delivered trees. (This may be a problem on
some older distributions, as Zdenek mentioned for RHEL4.)

I've made such support because we had to ship to a customer all
non-core CPAN modules that were used by a Perl application. (Also
ancient RHEL4 btw, so I know the problems Zdenek mentions quite
well.) Just to note: I'm not willing to do that work for biber,
just to get someone started to be able to do it.

Best,
	Joachim

Usual mantra: download - perl Makefile.PL - make -make check - sudo make install

What is "cpan command"?

You can run the Perl "cpan" program from the command line:

system-prompt > cpan

cpan-prompt >> install "Module::Name"

Thanks! On MacOSX 10.6 it is by default not executable and has a strict warning

"The contents of this script should normally never run!  The perl wrapper
should pick the correct script in /usr/bin by appending the appropriate version.
You can try appending the appropriate perl version number.  See perlmacosx.pod
for more information about multiple version support in Mac OS X.

Odd: on my Mac (10.6, clean installation + Dev tools) this doesn't happen!

cpan is to the "usual mantra" what tlmgr is to installing macros
from CTAN manually. Or what apt/yum/zypper are to
download/configure/make/make install. Relief from a big hassle.

It is a command that searches CPAN, shows information about CPAN
modules, and installs CPAN modules while taking all its
dependencies in account. (Of course, the dependency must be
declared in the CPAN module description; but almost all modules
that I have encountered are OK in that.) It may also used for
housekeeping of an entire local Perl installation, but that goes
beyond our use case.

That command is also the reason for the existence of CPAN modules
Bundle::*. These are empty packages with just dependencies to other
modules that install a whole set of modules that are
prefered/recommended for a given task. E.g., installing
Bundle::Apache2 would install the whole mod_perl framework for
Apache2, including all recommended modules.

The cpan command may be problematic to use if your Perl
installation is provided by a package manager, as it is on most
Linux distributions. Then it may overwrite files in the
distribution's perl package without updating the package manager
information, which is usually a Bad Thing(tm). But then, some
people just don't care and wait what happens. (They may get burned
by the next system update that throws away their changes.)

Therefore I normally use a special configuration for this command
that installs these modules in a separate directory tree; just like
a TL user would have a local texmf tree. One can use such a
directory tree via env var PERL5LIB, and one can distribute it to
other parties. (Don't forget to distribute the sources as well,
then; cpan command leaves them in a download cache directory.)

I hope this gives more information how one normally handles
installation of Perl modules from CPAN. Manual installation is not
feasible for regular usage or more complex modules.

Of course, if one has multiple Perl installations, one has also
multiple cpan commands, one for each installation.

The default behaviour of cpan is to install modules in the
directory tree of the respective installation it belongs to.

Hi,

I'm the fedora user who started this :)

First of all, thanks for the information, I might even try to hack
together a rpm for biber if I find time for it.

But I would still like to see biber in TeX Live if possible. If not now,
then maybe in a later release, because at the moment, all I need to
create nice looking LaTeX documents is included in TeX Live, even an
editor (TeXworks is in since 2009, right?) - and BibTeX. In the future,
all of us will (hopefully) move to biber+biblatex, but I wouldn't want
to loose the comfortability that TeX Live gives me by shipping
everything I need. 

But I guess all this is perfectly clear to you and when biber's time
will finally come, somebody will look into packaging it again.

Thanks again
Benedikt

Hi,

I have been using tex for a while but only so far as writing documents
and using other peoples style files.

Anyway, I am trying to write my CV. I have found a style that I like
but it is doing something funny with the address that I don't like.

The following section of code:

\def\@printcentername{\begingroup
  % print the name centered
  \leavevmode\hbox to \textwidth{\hfil\@tablebox{\namefont\@name}\hfil}\par
  % address
  \leavevmode\hbox to \textwidth{\hfil\@tablebox{\@addressone}\hfil}\par
\endgroup}

produces an address that is centered on the page but not with respect
to itself, i.e.,

\address{Road Name\\City\\postcode}

produces (centered on the page):

Road Name
City
postcode

but I want something like the following:

Road Name
   City
 postcode

but I cannot figure out how to make this happen in the style file, any
help would be much appreciated.

Only on Windows (and OS X via MacTeX). We don't ship binaries for other
platforms due to shared libraries issues. But I guess every Linux distro has it
packaged by now.

This help is more likely to be found on the texhax mailing-list or the
comp.text.tex usenet group.

This list is for TeX Live packaging and development discussions.

On my Linux system cpan and cpanp are configured to install to 
"sitelib", which is the Perl equivalent of TEXMFLOCAL. That means there 
is no overlap or conflict, as perl packages installed via the package 
manager go to "vendorlib" (which has a lower priority). Note also that 
cpanp (CPANPLUS, another tool to manage CPAN distributions) has the 
advantage over cpan that one can actually uninstall modules. Generally I 
still prefer to use a CPANPLUS plugin to generate packages for my Linux 
distro instead of installing directly, that way I keep everything under 
the control of my package manager. But most systems won't allow this and 
I would not recommend this approach to a normal user anyway.

Another possibility is to use local::lib 
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm) to install 
everything to, say, $HOME/perl5 instead. A very interesting, recent 
alternative to cpan and cpanp is cpanm 
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/lib/App/cpanminus.pm). It has 
no dependencies, is standalone, and requires zero-configuration. Since 
it gets its metadata from http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com it does not need 
to download and parse the large CPAN databases all the time, which saves 
as lot of time and RAM. You can download the standalone script 
<http://xrl.us/cpanm> thus:
     wget http://xrl.us/cpanm
then make it executable, and run, for instance:
     cpanm biblatex-biber-v0.5.3.tar.gz
which should automagically install Biber and all its dependencies. The 
installation target will be "sitelib" if you use sudo or if you have the 
appropriate permissions, otherwise it will use local::lib to install 
under ~/perl5.
Definitely worth a try!

Manuel, you've been on the right track all along.  I finally (almost)
got to the bottom of it.

The problem is the same as reported in the past for texdoc:

http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/dev-luatex/2008-September/001771.html

It comes from kpathsea, which changes \ to / in USERPRIFILE var and
this leads to the dreaded AR crash with "internal error occurred".
I've been unable so far to locate at which point this substitution
happens, but at least there is an easy fix for that, which I will
commit shortly:

  os.setenv("USERPROFILE", os.getenv("USERPROFILE"):gsub('/', '\\'))

But it gets even more interesting.  This change doesn't seem to happen
really in the environment but only in the environ variable exported
from the kpathsea lib.  This explains why os.execute() works (as
reported in the texdoc thread referenced above) and os.spawn()
doesn't. With os.execute() the child process inherits the environment
automatically from its parent, while os.spawn() is implemented using
_spawnvpe() with the environ variable passed for the environment.

What's more, this USERPROFILE manipulation happens only with w32tex
builds.  For my private mingw static build this doesn't happen.  Also,
the same substitution of \ to / happens sometimes for the command line
arguments, which should be fixed too.

Now, I'm not sure if using the environ variable in os.spawn() is
actually intended.  It is certainly not consistent to use it there and
not use it in os.execute().  I would suggest to remove this entirely
with this one line change in luatex:

I'm very glad to finally understand this so mysterious problem. Thank you for

Hi ?Reinhard,

My reply may have come across the wrong way.  It was simply meant to
emphasize that despite my knowledge on the subject I was absolutely
baffled by what I saw.  In fact, if not for yours and Manuel's
comments I would probably not progressed at all, because I got
completely stuck yesterday.  So thank you and everyone in this thread
for helping to finally hunt down this long standing bug.

Cheers,

Tomek

    one of which is that some macro files definitely rely on derivatives
    of proprietary fonts.

As I gather you're aware, those have to be excluded for TL.  Hopefully
the remainder is still usable.

    Anyway, I will disscuss with other authors and push forward with
    uploading kotex, or probably some part of kotex, to CTAN in due course.

Great, thanks.

Hello,
I installed texlive2009 using the script that wgets packages directly on 
the web. Now the distro is up-to-date but since the installation was 
manual, it gives me a lot of problems in managing dependencies since 
every latex editor (Gummi, DeSigle, and so on) I'd like to install 
requires latex-base and many other latex-* packages ... My distro is an 
ubuntu 9.04 based one, synaptic just recognizes texlive as packaged from 
the repository, and it's the 2007 version :(

So... I'd like to uninstall texlive 2009 as installed by the script and 
then install Texlive 2007 from ubuntu repositories. Eventually I'll 
manage every latex package update manually.
But... how to remove completely texlive 2009 as installed by the script? 
Can anyone give me an help ? I'm completely stuck'd.
Thanks in advance ;)

You can used a dummy deb package as described here:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html#vanilla

in order to make your Debian package manager happy.

Alternatively, just let synaptic install whatever dependencies he wants to, if 
your TL09 comes first in your PATH, it will still be used.

Well, unless you're very short of disk space, there is no reason to remove TL09 
even if you let synaptic install a few bits of texlive from the debian packages. 
Many people I know chose this solution and are perfectly happy with it : the 
bits from TL07 install by APT (synaptic) don't interfere with you TL09 
installation as long as it comes first in the PATH.

Message-ID: <s2gc555717c1004280057zdd72a49fx3e1ed7876562fa0b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I would like to install TeX Live on computers in a course room by
using the network installer mentioned in the TeX Live manual.

I have installed TeX Live on a dedicated machine, and now export the
texlive directory as a network share. The w32client scripts are in
place. When I attach the network share to a client computer (assigning
drive letter T:) and start the installer, I get the error message
"Cannot chdir to D:: Permission denied at
T:\2009\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl line 3835". D: was probably the
DVD drive on the server used for installing TeX Live.

A workaround *seems* to be inserting a CD into the local drive (hoping
that is called D: as well). Is there a better solution? Where does D:
come from?

Thanks,
   Joern

Why do you start the installer? You should call w32client script and
that is all, it runs the necessary things.

That's probably the easiest solution. I hope I understood it well; after 
the script installation I added manually the following entries to 
/etc/profile (system-wide):

if [ -d "/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux" ] ; then
     PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux:$PATH"
fi

if [ -d "/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/doc/man" ] ; then
     MANPATH="/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH"
fi

In order to apply this solution, I'd simply check, after dependencies 
installation, that these rows are processed BEFORE the corresponding 
tl07 ones? Is this sufficient?

Thanks again and forgive the noobyness ;)

That's what I meant by "the installer". I start "w32client09.bat" and
get the error message.

Is the w32client* script (all of them) in

Did you change *on the server* the installation location to CTAN?
On the server:
	tlmgr option repository ctan
(and check that then the location is http://mirror.ctan.org/... with
tlmgr option repository)

The only reason I can imagine is that the D: is saved there because
you installed from DVD.

I installed TeX Live on the server via install-tl.bat from a DVD in
drive D: to C:\texlive (i.e. I changed none of the defaults). Then I
exported C:\texlive from that server.

Do you suggest I should try the command above and see if the error persists?

> The only reason I can imagine is that the D: is saved there because

See my original mail...

Please note that as workaround I can insert *any* CD/DVD into D:, not
necessarily a TeX Live DVD. So the error handling on this path check
should be relaxed, IMHO. If this is technically possible, of course, I
have no idea if this another Windows limitation.

Yes, please do so (on the server).

	tlmgr option repository ctan

if that does not work

	tlmgr option location ctan

and if that does not work

	tlmgr option location http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

Ok, so the above should help.

You should anyway to the above and then call
	tlmgr update --self

Well, there's no corresponding TL07 lines, since Debian-packaged TeX Live will 
have its binaries in /usr/bin. So your TL09 will come first.

If you want to check that the correct TL installation is used, there are two steps:

- run "which latex" in a command line: if the result is
/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux/latex, then you PATH settings are good in 
you shell
- but, depending on your grapical environment, your PATH for GUI apps may be 
different. To check that, open your favourite GUI LaTeX editor (not from a 
command line), compile a document, and have look at the pdfTeX version in the 
log, which should be:
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (TeX Live 2009)

The dummy package method works well, but some people need both
(e.g., to ensure that software documentation can be formatted by those
using the texlive 2007 deb packages).

This should work.

Some versions of man will look for man pages in directories related to
those in the PATH.   If you have this type of man commands you can
create a symbolic link to the "real" man directory to enable this without
touching MANPATH.

Assuming you did not create the symbolic links for the current TL in /usr/bin
all you need to do is examine the PATH setting in a terminal.

> Thanks again and forgive the noobyness ;)

Just for the sake of completeness, I should mention the environment
modules system which allows users to adjust the environment using
a command-line utility:  <http://modules.sourceforge.net/>.

Thanks, but this is not a list for user support, but about developing
TeX Live. With very high probability you will not get any answers here.

Please contact comp.text.tex or the texhax mailing list, and best even
to contact upstream authors of gost780 (whatever it may be) that they
fix that.

Thanks

Norbert

Hello!

> 	tlmgr option repository ctan

This did the trick.

BTW: It would be nice if TeXdoc GUI could also get added to the start
menu, like in a local installation.

Thanks,
  Joern

That is btw documented in many places, that after installation from
the DVD you should switch to a different installation repository.

You can call 
	tlmgr postaction install shortcut texdoc
on the client machine, or add it to the w32client script.
(Please see the man page of tlmgr, or the output of tlmgr help for the
"postaction" action documentation)

Best wishes

Norbert

Hi.

(I think this is not right place to post such questions. Use texhax
mailing list).

[snip]

I'm not a big expert in TeX and LaTex but I look into bibentry.sty
code and found that it redefines thebibliography environment. It uses
\begingroup and \endgroup commands and that means that
\begin{thebibliography}
opens a block and \def command is not propagated into block. Package
gost should use \gdef instead of \def.

Try your code again and change \def in bbl file (before second run of
pdflatex) to \gdef. You see that there will be not error.
