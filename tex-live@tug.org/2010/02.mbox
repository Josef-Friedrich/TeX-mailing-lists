E.g.

For all three packages pdf-documentation is on CTAN. TeXLive doesn't
include the files as the sources are not on CTAN.

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc + flafter and a question
Message-ID: <4B66EE9E.3070708@imf.au.dk>


Hi,

texdoc flafter

sends me to 
texmf-dist/doc/generic/tex-virtual-academy-pl/latex2e/macro/flafter.html

which does not seem to be appropriate, there is no doc for flafter, but 
then it might be an idea to let texdoc point toward flafter.sty

Question: where can we add local texdoc information? We have several 
packages which are only available at our site, and I'd like to add them 
to texdoc (some need a texdoc alias, hence the question)

However, flafter.sty doesn't contain any documentation unlike

If the information is site-local, I think TEXMFLOCAL/texdoc/texdoc.cnf is the
most appropriate place. The syntax in the same as in the main texdoc.cnf file
which contains (hopefully) enough comments, but you can refer to 'texdoc texdoc'
if needed.

What a pity.  Viewing DVI in xdvi is so much faster and in particular so
much more comfortable than PDF in xpdf(-derivatives) or acroread.

Is there really a majority of TeX users who prefer PDF?  Is the planned
new 1.5 format faster to load?  Are there any alternative PDF viewers
that can be handled conveniently with keystrokes, like xdvi?

Maybe users should be able to set in tlmgr or elsewhere, whether they
prefer DVI or PDF if both are available.

There are DVI files that can be viewed in xdvi,
there are DVI files containing \specials for other
drivers, not supported by xdvi (perhaps dvipdfm, dvipsone, ...),
there are DVI files with fonts that are not installed on
the system, there are DVI files with graphics where
the graphics type is not supported or the graphics file is even
missing, ...

xdvi is a nightmare in comparison to emTeX's comfortable dvi drivers.

If there would be a common standard for DVI extensions (\special) for
* specifying page size for each page
* color specifications
* graphics inclusion
* rotating
* scaling
* anchor, links
* bookmarks
* embedding of fonts
* embedding of graphics
* metadata
* ...
that would be supported by the major dvi drivers (dvips, dvipdfm, ...),
then the DVI format would have a chance, even nowadays.

Also xdvi isn't well supported by LaTeX:
* Package `color' 2005/11/14 v1.0j contains:
    \DeclareOption{xdvi}{\ExecuteOptions{dvips,monochrome}}
  Thus xdvi doesn't even support color?
  (Rethorical question, I know that xdvi support some
  kind of color specials.)
* xdvi supports the \special{papersize} for *each* page
  (according to manual page), but both Package `geometry'
  and `typearea' are setting this special on the first
  page only.

But if you like, you can convert the PDF files to DVI files
(probably not the DVI that you have in mind, but DVI is DVI, isn't it?)

I don't think so, but anyway noone said all documentation was going to be
converted to PDF 1.5. We don't usually generate documentation in TeX Live.

I almost never use the mouse with xpdf (only to resize the sidebar sometimes).

This was discussed in depth already.  DVI is not an option at all
because DVI files don't incorporate all the needed resources (fonts,
graphics,...).  Furthermore, they can contain stuff (\special)
supposed to be processed by post-processors.

Whether to provide documentation as DVI, PS, or PDF is definitely not
a matter of taste.  There are many technical constraints.

And for CTAN, DVI doesn't make any sense at all if documentation is
supposed to be accessible online.
 
 > Is there really a majority of TeX users who prefer PDF?  

Sure, the majority of TeX users create PDF.  Most PDF related
documentation files *have* to be in PDF.  Run "texdoc movie15" for
example.  Be warned: you *need* Adobe Reader 6 at least.

 > Is the planned new 1.5 format faster to load?  

The files will be smaller, at least.  How much depends on the content.
Network downloads will be faster. If you have the file on your hard
drive, I'm not sure that you'll notice the difference. 

 > Are there any alternative PDF viewers that can be handled
 > conveniently with keystrokes, like xdvi?

Good question.  Alexander Grahn wrote a JavaScript file which adds a
"Reload" entry to Adobe Reader's File menu.  It's pretty easy to
install: just throw the script into AR's "JavaScripts" directory.
I don't know whether it's possible to define keyboard shortcuts
similarly.  Would be great.  Does anybody know more?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have not tried, I have an old version but it seems that CTAN
contains a newer version with a shortcut. Linux allows me to write a
PDF although it is open in AR. Then I just reload it.

This is already possible with the existing texdoc (variable ext_list in texdoc.cnf). There is not need to add another option to the already overly complex tlmgr.

Correct, but OTOH packages seldom come with both dvi and pdf documentation in
TL, so I doubt this option is so usefull in practice. Anyway, it exists indeed.

aiui, tl package making _doesn't_ involve building docs -- they come
from ctan, along with the package.

only the most eccentric die-hards would suggest that dvi is an
appropriate format for sites that are browsable (istr someone had
configured this lab's mosaic so's it could bring up xdvi, but i've not
seen it since such facilities.  afaik no-one's bothered to provide a
firefox- (or any other browser-) embeddable dvi reader.

given that, since ctan wants its holdings to be browsable, we have given
up on dvi docs; the only doc formats we accept in uploads are plain text
and pdf.

so any docs that come from ctan are in pdf -- in the sense that i know
of no exceptions.  (when i come across a package that's in need of docs,
i usually just generate the pdf and install it.  this is advertised ctan
policy.)

Added to the heuristics rather than as an alias. Btw, since you're fluent in

 (either to the logic or the 'suffixes' table).

Hi,

Lars Madsen a ?crit :
> texdoc flafter
> 
Since this is at least the third request in a few days concerning a package from
latex/base, I decided to systematically review them. Here is the result:

# latex/basic classes
alias article = classes
alias report = classes
alias book = classes
#alias ltxguide = ???
#alias minimal = ???
adjscore(minimal) europecv = -1000 # false positive

# latex/basic packages, grouped by dtx
alias bezier = latex209
alias fleqn = latex209
alias leqno = latex209
alias openbib = latex209
alias t1enc = latex209
alias fix-cm = fixltx2e
alias flafter = source2e
alias tracefnt = source2e
alias fontenc = source2e
alias textcomp = source2e
alias(20) fontenc = encguide
alias(20) textcomp = encguide
alias makeidx = makeindx
alias showidx = makeindx
alias shortvrb = base/doc

I didn't feel a need to add aliases like article-pkg = latex209 (for
article.sty). For fontenc and textcomp, the two results encguide and sourc2e
will be given in this order. For minimal, I'm not sure it's useful to show
minimal.cls (anf in any case I won't do it just right now since it requires
changes in the code), so I just killed the false positive from europecv.

Please comment if I got something wrong or forgot anything.

Thanks,
Manuel.

At least I have perfomed a quick test with the old example
that uses option `mag=1500' as option for geometry.
Two remarks:

* TL's geometry.cfg should be removed, if the new geometry
  version hits TL, because the current geometry.cfg forces
  driver `pdftex' for geometry if XeTeX is used. A user might
  think, there is something wrong.

* Because XeTeX supports many specials of dvipdfm, there might
  be a global option `dvipdfm'. Then \GM at checkdrivers does not
  check, whether XeTeX is running and uses option `dvipdfm'
  with a wrong result.

Yours sincerely

And so will be the docs in TeXLive, until I come up with a script that

Message-ID: <1CE753A0-6CAF-4DDE-A149-FA904089EB80@gmail.com>

Dear all.

Is there anyone who succeeded in building TeX Live 2009 from source
on Mac OS X 10.6.2, Snow Leopard?

At first I got an error message "does not find freetype2" at the time of
configuring the gd library, and I solved it by giving "-framework Carbon"
in the configure file.

After that, I faced with many error message related to Mac OS X's native
functions (Carbon, etc.) at the time of compiling XeTeX.

Please let me know how to build TeX Live 2009 from source.

Best regards, ChoF.

You'll need to do a 32-bit build (the default is 64-bit on SL). XeTeX uses some Mac APIs that are not available in the 64-bit frameworks.

I'm not sure exactly how to achieve that within the TL build process, but basically it should involve passing the -arch i386 flag to the compiler.

Hi Manuel,
I'm not sure that I'm fluent in Lua, I still have to consult the
documentation quite frequently.

The suffixes table looks fine so far, I expect that you'll have to
extend it when people detect other problems.

I found something interesting in functions.tlu:

    function win32_hook (path)
        local res = string.gsub (path, '/', '\\')
        return res -- get rid of gsub's 2nd return value
    end

Another way to get rid of extra return values is to use the function
select().  It allows you to select the nth element of an argument
vector.  However, it doesn't work properly here.  I'll put you into
the CC when I file a bug report.

But for the time being you can provide such a function yourself:

function select (n, ...)
   return arg[n]
end

Then you can write:

    function win32_hook (path)
        return select(1, string.gsub (path, '/', '\\'))
    end

It saves you a local variable and if you need it more than once, it
also saves you a few lines of code.

Another thing I noticed is this:

$ texdoc -s pgf
60 results.  Display them all? (y/N)

There are 53 results actually.

$ texdoc -s dvips
25 results.  Display them all? (y/N)

There are 24 results actually.

Hey, I thought you are a mathematician. ;)

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello,

Currently tlmgr gui looks like this on my Xfce: (Xfce-4.6.1 on

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/translations/tlmgr-gui-FreeBSD-Xfce-20100203.png

So it would be nice if it could be possible to use default session font

Besides, input boxes (such as Match -> Pattern) do not work here, i.e.
they are now writable; just a cursor blinking.

tlmgr does nothing special, ut uses the "fixed" font AFAIR. So if your
system has a broken definition of "fixed", that will be taken.

If you have some Asian fonts installed that might be the case.

What the gnome terminal or so shows is completely irrelevant, sicne they
re using fontconfig to get the fonts.

That is the default fontconfig font as fixed in gnoem, but that I cannot
and will not read.

That is strange .... never seen before.

Ahhh no ... you don't have write permissions, can that be? So that
explains why also the buttons are disabled.

Start it as the one who installed the program (so with write permissions
to texlive.tlpdb) and it should work.

It is just an untouched Xorg/Xfce install with all defaults...

So what an average user is supposed to do in situation like this? 

I mean, I don't ask because of myself, I am able to fix this somehow. I
just reported what I deemed useful info about perl-tk behaviour in some
standard circumstances.

No, I deliberately arranged it to show an additional window with some
text. The boxes are non-writable regardless of write permissions.

So it be, then it is probably the cyrillic encoding. Maybe someone
else with cyrillic locale can help here.

That does not help.

Maybe your .Xdefaults of some other resources list some strange
font as default?

Can you tell me the output of
	xlsfonts -l -fn fixed

> So what an average user is supposed to do in situation like this? 

No idea. Fix the "fixed" font.

As said, there are many people using this program and it didn't happen
by now. Don't assume that it is a *default* behaviour.

Isn't that the text that tells you that you don't have write permissions
to ".../tlpkg"??? My Russian is quite rusty, but still ... and that would
mean that all the entries are disabled.

MacTeX is a wrapper around TeX Live. So even if you only want the basics 
you can use the MacTeX installer to get TeX Live 2009. (This is what I 
have on my Mac: I deselected everything except the core of TeX Live itself.)

Is it running as 64bit or 32bit?

This is what I do, also.  The main difference between MacTeX and TeX Live is
the addition of the TeX Distribution preference pane and associated symlinks
in /usr/texbin; this is handy when you need to switch between TL versions.
MacTeX also sets TEXMFHOME to ~/Library/texmf.

32 bit on a 15" MBP, but if you do a search on this list,

All right. As I said, I hoped this could be useful. Since it isn't --

Yes, it does say it (although not in Russian). But, as I said, the same
happens with writable tlpkg/:

Nothing can be typed in the "match pattern", nor in any other box.

Norbert, I don't see "fixed" being hardwired in the Perl code, though I
certainly could have missed it.  Anyway, I'd expect the normal font for
Tk to be used, not just forcing "fixed"?

In any case, hopefully it can be changed with some confusing X user
preference or another.

Nikola, it seems that this must be some peculiarity of the Tk you have
vs. what tlmgr is expecting/doing/programming for.  There's probably no
practical way for Norbert to debug why it's happening on BSD when it
doesn't happen anywhere else.  Any chance you can dig into it?

This is ok.  ~/.Xdefaults allows you to customize your X11
environment.  It shouldn't exist by default.  Setting up X11 fonts
there is a pain anyway.  Don't waste your time.

Please keep in mind that Perl doesn't use the X11 default font anyway.
It uses Helvetica for Western European characters, as you can see in
your screenshot.  The X11 default font "fixed" is a monospaced font
while Perl's default font is proportional.

I'm using Gentoo Linux and when I run

  tlmgr --gui-lang=sr gui

I get much better results than you.  Is

  http://tug.org/~kotucha/tlmgr-gui-sr.png

what you expect?

In Gentoo Linux, Perl/Tk is obviously linked against fontconfig.
Don't know whether Debian/Ubuntu links Perl/Tk against fontconfig
already, but you could check yourself:

  strace -eopen tlmgr --gui-lang=sr gui 2>&1 | grep 'fontconfig\.so'	

Do you see something like

  open("/usr/lib/libfontconfig.so......

in the terminal?

BTW, if you compare our screenshots, you'll see that you get some
messages in English at the bottom of the GUI frame, while I get them
in Serbian.  This has obviously nothing to do with your fonts setup,
the only explanation I have is that your TeX Live installation is not
up-to-date.  With other words, you installed TeX Live before these
strings were translated to Serbian and didn't run

  tlmgr update --all --self

since then.

Could you check whether Ubuntu already offers a newer version of
Perl/Tk?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Actually I was believing that "fixed" is the default font used
by the Tk module. The "Mastering Perl/Tk" book does not give much
information here. It says on Unix it uses the "system fonts" as
found by xlsfonts.

Which font is actually selected based on the LOCALE I have no idea.


Nikola: Can you run the attached script test.pl with
	perl test.pl
and send us the output. It checks that used default settings of
the font and the actually selected ones.

Running it on my computer shows that I actually might use fontconfig
in Tk, too, since here it returns bitstream vera as the fefault
font.

> In any case, hopefully it can be changed with some confusing X user

The "Mastering ..." book suggest using the -font "..." command
line and states that this can be used without changing the code
of the script, but that is not true. I guess we have to add some
calls to the Tk_Commandline or whatever.

Yes I agree, there i nothing I can debug here, there is no reason why
they should be disabled.

Message-ID: <201002041330.36595.robert.king@newcastle.edu.au>

Hi,

I'm sending this to texlive, but I'm not sure which package is to blame, or
whether it is an integration issue. Apologies if it should be going elsewhere

LaTeX can't find font files that are first used in a file included using the 
\import* command.

Two files make up the minimal example, as you need to be including to get the 
error, which is

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `U/msa/m/n' undefined
(Font)              using `U/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 1.

LaTeX Font Info:    Try loading font information for U+msb on input line 1.
LaTeX Font Info:    No file Umsb.fd. on input line 1.

The warning can be avoided by doing any one of the following list:

Not using the amssymb package
Including the file using \input \include or \import instead of \import*
Using a different sized font (via \LaTeX, \footnote or \url) in the
main document before import

First file - problem-example.tex:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{import}
\usepackage[colorlinks, linkcolor=blue, pdfencoding=unicode]{hyperref}

\begin{document}

There is some problem in locating font files if it happens first in a file
that has been included using the function \verb+\import*+.

%But I can make it go away\footnote{I don't know why}.

If there is a footnote here before a footnote in the included file.

It also goes away if I use the \verb+\LaTeX+ before the importfile.

Or if I use \verb+\url+ before the importfile

\import*{./}{problem-include.tex}

It also goes away if I don't use the amssymb package

\end{document}

Second file - problem-include.tex:

Here is the problem footnote\footnote{See this interesing URL

Well this line shows the problem: LaTeX can't find Umsb.fd. The
reason is that you used the starred version of \import which -- as
the documentation explains -- "avoids searching the TEXINPUTS path
when importing files". 

This obviously also affects subsequent searching of files inside the
imported document.

[Replying to 3 emails at once]

Karl and Reinhard, you were right: indeed this was not the problem with
"fixed" font, but with p5-Tk without fontconfig support.

FreeBSD port by default (and eo ipso FreeBSD p5-Tk package) provide
non-fontconfig version because p5-Tk README states that "freetype2,
fontconfig and Xft is provided for Unix" as "experimental".

So, if I pass WITH_XFT=yes to the port's Makefile, tlmgr window looks
just like Reinhard's:

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/translations/tlmgr-gui-FreeBSD-Xfce-20100204-WITH_XFT.png

Various Linux distros obviously all tacitly compile p5-Tk with XFT. I
guess that adding an info about that in tlmgr and on the web would be a
good idea.

Now answering your questions:

I found the cause: SCIM daemon (scim -d) running without XIM_PROGRAM
variable blocks tlmgr. At least on FreeBSD, other Tk applications
have the same problem. (IBUS daemon does not block Tk dialogs.)

I will investigate this further. For now, this solves the problem:

  export XIM_PROGRAM="scim"
  export XIM_ARGS="-d"

With p5-Tk / WITH_XFT:

  preset settings:
  -weight -> normal
  -underline -> 0
  -family -> undefined
  -slant -> roman
  -size -> 0
  -overstrike -> 0
  actually used settings:
  -weight -> normal
  -underline -> 0
  -family -> Bitstream Vera Sans
  -slant -> roman
  -size -> -15
  -overstrike -> 0

Without XFT support:

  preset settings:
  -weight -> normal
  -underline -> 0
  -family -> undefined
  -slant -> roman
  -size -> 0
  -overstrike -> 0
  actually used settings:
  -weight -> normal
  -underline -> 0
  -family -> fixed
  -slant -> roman
  -size -> -17
  -overstrike -> 0

(FreeBSD) It is the last p5-Tk version (804.028).

Good that this is resolved.

Well actually it is not. It still leaves open which font was taken,
which is somehow strange.

Ahh, that is the reason. I swtiched anyway to ibus since quite some
time. Had too much problems with scim.

Huuuuu? Size "-17" ???? That is *strange*

Can you try xlsfonts and try to select that font (the one from "actually
used settings".

Is that the font that was shown.

Anyway, size -17 makes me a bit ahhhhhhh...

Hm, yes. Please take a look at this snapshot:

  http://anthesphoria.net/FreeBSD/TeXLive-Devel/translations/tlmgr-gui-FreeBSD-various-ttf-fonts.png

This ^^^ set of fonts appears on my personal working account, when p5-Tk
is *WITH_XFT* and when test.pl says that "actually used settings" are
"Bitstream Vera Sans" at the size of "-15". There are at least four
different fonts there and I am not sure that Vera is among them at all.

lsof shows that perl binary was accessing the following font files:

perl5.8.9 59306     nikola  txt     VREG               0,92             126064  1515232 /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/cour.pfa

I have no idea why OldStandard and LiberationMono were chosen, they are
not mentioned in any of my config files anywhere. (OldStandard is the
font you see in menu and in Display Settings.)

I always get a negative value for size, on all FreeBSD and Linux
machines I have.

I am not sure what font: when p5-Tk is linked against fontconfig or
when it is not? (I.e. you want to know what is that ugly Cyrillic font?
It is _without_ fontconfig.)

Yes I want to know which font was selected as *ugly* font without fontconfig.

The ugly font is /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/misc/hanglg16.pcf.gz. On
FreeBSD that file is installed by x11-fonts/font-daewoo-misc port.

If it is present, tlmgr takes Cyrillic letters from it if it can.
However, that daewoo font has only Russian letters; Serbian-specific
"?", "?", "?" and "?" look good: they are picked from 8x13.pcf.gz
(x11-fonts/font-misc-misc port).

If daewoo fonts are absent, it will pick up Russian Cyrillic subset
from some other (ugly) font.

So, the way to invoke a nice Cyrillic tlmgr without fontconfig was:

1) % mkdir ~/testfonts

2) put there only 8x13.pcf.gz and cursor.pcf.gz (on FreeBSD these
   font files are provided by x11-fonts/font-misc-misc and
   x11-fonts/cursor-misc ports)

3) % mkfontscale ~/testfonts
   % mkfontdir ~/testfonts
   % xset fp ~/testfonts
   % xset fp rehash
   % tlmgr --gui-lang sr gui

     and it looks perfect:

Message-ID: <1agqtnk1b42nq$.dlg@nililand.de>

Hello, I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, but I think
there is a chance that someone knows the answer ;-)

I'm trying to use the windows binaries from http://w32tex.org/ of
the lcdf-typetools.

When calling otftotfm I get the error message
otftotfm: temporary file '\s1so.4': Permission denied

This looks as if otftotfm tries to write at the root of the drive.

I can avoid the problem by calling otftotfm with admin rights. I
probably can also avoid the problem by changing the permissions.
Both possibilities don't appeal to me. 

Has someone a idea how I could tell otftotfm to use another folder
for this temporary files?
(a setting in a texmf.cnf would be ok, otftotfm is installed in a
mini  texmf with kpathsea).

Hi Ulrike,

    Hello, I'm not sure this is the right place to ask, but I think
    there is a chance that someone knows the answer ;-)

I do not know the answer, but the people to ask are Eddie Kohler (author
of lcdf-typetools) and/or Akira Kakuto (author of w32tex).  Eddie's not
on this list.  Akira is, but I haven't received mail from him for a
couple weeks now.  (Sure hope he's ok.)

If you have any problems finding their email addresses, let me know.

Best,
Karl

TL isn't an operating system.  I don't want to provide iconv in general.

What would be nice is if the libraries could be statically linked on
Windows.  Failing that, I agree that instructions would be highly
desirable.  I'm not able to do either one myself; I hope others can make
it happens.

Thanks for the report,

This mailing list is definitely the right place to ask.

The best way to determine the path to a temporary directory is to
evaluate environment variables.  On Windows the relevant variable is
%TEMP%.

otftotfm behaves as expected on Unix.  When I run 

   strace -eopen otftotfm .....

I see:

  open("/tmp/501-reinhard/otftotfm.dq6Zup", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0600) = 3
  open("/tmp/501-reinhard/otftotfm.dq6Zup", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 4

The default temporary directory on Unix is /tmp.  However, it seems
that otftotfm is using the value of $TMPDIR, which is set to
/tmp/$UID-`whoami` at login time on my machine.

The lcdf-typetools were written for Unix.  Akira ported them to
Windows for his W32TeX distribution.  Maybe he forgot to adapt the
environment variables.

Ulrike, I'm not sure whether it works, but you could try:

  set TMPDIR=%TEMP%

I don't have Windows and thus can't test it myself.  But maybe it's
sufficient to provide an environment variable %TMPDIR% which contains
the same path as %TEMP%.

BTW, this mail is sent to Akira as well.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] bibtex's max_print_line
Message-ID: <B91753A0-A6D7-4D27-96C8-0C372B57C125@gmail.com>

We are seeing the convergence of two things: 1) long, unbreakable URLs  
or the like and 2) frequent use of TeX multiletter control sequences  
in the .bbl (such as those produced by REVTeX and AIP .bst files).  
Under some circumstances the two will coincide, resulting in a .bbl  
file with a line where a TeX multiletter control sequence will have  
been broken by bibtex's mechanism (insertion of "%<newline>"), which  
is, of course, regarded by TeX as an error.

In bibtex.web:

> @<Constants in the outer block@>=
...
> @!max_print_line=79; {the maximum: must be |>min_print_line| and | 
> <buf_size|}


I propose a change to the way bibtex handles this parameter, such that  
its value is set via web2c.cfg, with the default value considerably  
larger than the current (79).

A cleaner, more thorough way of handling things would be for bibtex to  
understand what a TeX control sequence is, and to not break the line  
there.

The needed changes could be incorporated into bibtex.ch.

Would such a change be considered meritorious or welcome?

TeXlive has those resources.  TeXlive is not CTAN or the web.

Addition: While trying to find a solution I also downloaded the
texmf.cnf and wondered a bit about the curious texinputs setting for
luatex (compared e.g. to pdfluatex). Why does it have texinfo at the
start?

TEXINPUTS.pdfluatex =
.;$texroot/{plain,generic,platex209,latex209,}//

TEXINPUTS.luatex = .;$texroot/{texinfo,generic,plain,}//

The reasoning is as follows:
1. DVI is not suitable for the web, hence not suitable for CTAN.
2. The material in TeX Live is the material from CTAN.
3. Therefore, there will be PDFs in TeX Live.

Besides, TeX Live doesn't always have the resources. The fonts used in a
given DVI may not be part of a given TeX Live installation (because the
installation is not a full install, or the fonts are non-free, etc.)

(I can find other arguments for PDF, but I guess you'll disagree with them,
so I try to keep the discussion on the technical points.)

If you want to have DVI's in your local installation of TeX Live, please
write a script to generate them. If it works, feel free to report success so
that others who prefer DVI can benefit from it.

Manuel.

There are some other technical reasons.  Many documents conatain
\pdfliteral and \special commands which can't be processed by dvi
viewers.  They have to be provided as PDF.

David, do you insist on DVI or are you mostly interested in source
specials or synctex?

"Many" meaning a small ratio.

I am not insisting on anything.  I am not going to do particular
applications requiring premade DVI files in the foreseeable future.  It
just happens that a number of things (including fast viewing) work
better with DVI.  But a large part of those things are nice to have
while working on documents of your own, and that does not concern
packaged docs.

First of all, I am surprised that you run into that code part. It is not
supposed to be used at all in normal installations.

Can you please run 
	tlmgr -v -v -v update --all >tlmgr-debug.log  2>&1
and send the compressed output.

I don't have it.

It's possible, probably not even too hard.  If you or anyone would like
to supply a patch, great :).  If it has to wait for me, it'll probably
be waiting quite a while.  I'll put it on the list though.

Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi Arthur, Oren, all,

    A cleaner, more thorough way of handling things would be for bibtex to  
    understand what a TeX control sequence is, 

Or url.  I surmise it should only break lines at known good places, and
there is no known-good place, it shouldn't break at all, overriding
max_print_line.

    and to not break the line there.

I think that would be much better than making max_print_line into an
(semi-)dynamic parameter, or even a truly dynamic one.  Just because
there is one 100-character control sequence or url in a bibliography
doesn't mean I want every entry to be broken at column 100.

    Would such a change be considered meritorious or welcome?

Meritorious.  Is it something you can work on?

Background: I've talked to Oren quite a few times over the past several
years about making a bibtex bug-fix release, with this incorrect
line-breaking being the principal bug to fix.  Oren had hoped to do it,
and still hopes to (not to mention BibTeX 1.0), but there is not even a
STIX-like ETA at this point.  (Hope this is a fair summary, Oren.)

So any fix for it (from anyone) sounds excellent to me.

Thanks,
Karl

I don't think it is a good idea to manually change pdftex.map

I have

  WebOMintsGD WebOMintsGD <WebOMintsGD.pfb

in webo.map, which is located in

texmf-local/fonts/map/dvips/webomints

ran texhash to make sure webo.map can be found, aka

kpsewhich webo.map

then enabled it

updmap-sys --enable Map webo.map

I use it via

\newcommand{\wb}[2]{\fontsize{#1}{#2}\usefont{U}{webo}{xl}{n}}

\wb{36bp}{36bp}

I would try to find the files with kpsewhich. If it does not work, the
file name database is wrong or the files are on wrong places. As I
see, the tfm file is not in the tfm subdirectory which might be the
problem. If the files are found but do not work, the map file is
wrong.

This mixes plain old tex with latex -- it isn't valid for either
pdftex or pdflatex.

I used "updmap-sys --enable Map=webo" and can compile+view sample1.tex
using pdflatex and xpdf.

Or, if you are like me who has texmf-local copied from another system (that
is currently on a several week trip to distant places) where it was populated
by getnonfreefonts, you can use:

wget http://tug.org/~kotucha/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
texlua install-getnonfreefonts
getnonfreefonts-sys -r

[on my system, "ul9.map" is not found??]

Please change two directories texmf\local into
a directory texmf-local.
All files under texmf\local cannot be found.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

OK, the files are definitely found :

and tbe map entry in PdfTeX.map was inserted by "updmap"
using "webo.map" as its source.

Yes, did all that, and even did

	updmap-sys --enable Map ./webo.map

with a copy of webo.map in the current directory, and thus
it was updmap that modified PdfTeX.map ...

Well, it works for Guido Herzog !  And as far as I can see,
it is valid for PdfLaTeX, even if it breaks every rule
in L2TabuEN :-)

Well, I don't have texmf-local set up as you do, but
I thought that I would give "getnonfreefonts" a try.

First attempt was :

 > getnonfreefonts-sys -r

but this produced :

> H:\TeX\Live\2009\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:293:
> no appropriate script or program found: getnonfreefonts-sys

 > getnonfreefonts -r

produced no errors, but seemed to do very little,
so next I tried :

 > getnonfreefonts -a

That seemed to do a great deal, but at the end of the
exercise, Guido Herzog's example still fails in the same way ...

/However/, I repeated the exercise (with all the same
incantations of getnonfreefonts, including those that
had previously seemed to do little or nothing), and
this time, Guido's example works :-)))

I have no idea how or why, or what is different now
to how things were before, but it works.  My sincere
thanks to George and to all who offered advice, and
to Reinhard for providing "getnonfreefonts" in the
first place.

Is it possible to persuade "getnonfreefonts" to install things
in the local equivalent of "texmflocal" ?

Actually, it  works for me with "umrand" replaced by "niceframe"
and '\end' with '\end{document}'.

Ah yes, mea culpa : I tried not to bore the list with
the full gory details of Guido's source, but over-
simplified it to the point of breakage :-(  Incidentally,
the "umrand" bit works for me (after downloading it).

niceframe is in TL2009 and umrand is not -- what does umrand
provide that niceframe does not?

Yes, but first of all a few words about the error message you got:

> H:\TeX\Live\2009\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:293:
> no appropriate script or program found: getnonfreefonts-sys

The purpose of the wrappers is to run programs in a modified
environment on order to make the hidden ghostscript and perl, for
instance, visible to scripts which need them.  If you can convince
your Exploder to show file sizes in bytes instead of kilobytes, you'll
see many .exe files with a size of 1536 bytes.  All these tiny
programs are doing the same thing:  They invoke the generic wrapper
(bin/win32/runscript.tlu) and pass what you typed on the command line
to it.  runscript.tlu then evaluates the first argument (the name of
the script) in order to decide what to do.

I just looked at the code of the generic wrapper.  It behaves different
from the old one.  

The old wrapper always checked whether the first argument ends with
"-sys".  The new wrapper only supports updmap-sys as an exception and
doesn't recognize getnonfreefonts-sys.  Instead of launching
getnonfreefonts in a modified environment, it assumes that a script
called getnonfreefonts-sys actually exists.

I could change the getnonfreefonts installer in order to install
getnonfreefonts-sys also, but I'd like to hear Tomek's opinion first.
It would be nice if one and the same program has to be installed twice
under different names.

For the time being you have two options in order to invoke
getnonfreefonts-sys.

  1. cd texmf/scripts/getnonfreefonts
     copy /b getnonfreefonts.pl getnonfreefonts-sys.pl
     mktexlsr

  2. getnonfreefonts has an undocumented option --sys.  The
     invocations

       getnonfreefonts-sys
     
     and

       getnonfreefonts --sys

     should be equivalent.

The reason files were installed in TEXMFHOME instead of TEXMFLOCAL is
that you ran getnonfreefonts instead of getnonfreefonts-sys.  Running
getnonfreefonts-sys again won't help because files in TEXMFHOME take
priority.

If you are absolutely sure that you never installed anything in
TEXMFHOME yourself, just remove everything from TEXMFHOME and TEXMFVAR
and run mktexlsr.

You could run

  getnonfreefonts --sys webomints

but I think it's best to remove the files you installed manually
first.  You installed them in other directories than getnonfreefonts.

   fonts/type1/local/webomintsgd.pfb
   fonts/type1/public/webomints/WebOMintsGD.pfb

I don't expect any problems because these files are identical.
However, if things change on CTAN, getnonfreefonts will offer you to
update the fonts.  getnonfreefonts will replace old files by newer
ones but it's not aware of stuff in other directories.  And kpathsea
doesn't know which version of a particular file is more appropriate.
There should never be two files with the same name within a particular
TeX installation.

Let me cite Monty Python: "And Now For Something Completely Different".

getnonfreefonts provides documentation.  I'm aware that manual pages
are more or less inaccessible to Windows users.  Therefore, the web
page

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/getnonfreefonts

offers the manual page in HTML.

Though one could regard the manual page as the definite guide, it
also makes sense to invoke getnonfreefonts with the -h or --help
option.  The help message tells you where files are supposed to be
installed:
 
 $ getnonfreefonts --help
 [...]
 Directories:
       temporary: '/tmp/501-reinhard/getfont-<PID>'
       install:   '/home/reinhard/texmf'

 $ getnonfreefonts --sys --help
 [...]
 Directories:
       temporary: '/tmp/0-root/getfont-<PID>'
       install:   '/usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local'

I think the "different behaviour based on executable name" trend in TeX
world is really a bad idea and should die, having tens of identical
executables (or links to it) is ridiculous. "--sys" like options are
cleaner IMO.

Option (2) seems preferable to me; indeed, it is not
clear why there need to be two command names at all,
when a single command plus appropriate qualifier(s)
can achieve the same effect.

Clear about deleting below TEXMFHOME, but why iunder TEXMFVAR; why
might there be things there, Reinhard, and why is it safe to delete
them ?

Files in *VAR are created automaticaly by programs.  Now you have a copy 
of updmap.cfg there which makes your system-wide configuration invisible.

Subject: [tex-live] Some observations for TL09 DVD and texworks
Message-ID: <4B73F43C.9000609@imf.au.dk>


Some observations

* if TL 09 is installated on Win 7 from DVD, as a regular user (i.e. not 
installing with admin rights) is it then correct that TL should not add 
itself to the Windows menu (or what ever it is called in W7)?

A student did the above, which now makes TL management tedious (a 
student does not know about the tlmgr --gui commandline feature, at 
least not a Windows user)

* TeXWorks/SyncTeX does apparently not like non ascii letters in paths.

I have an example file (test.text) lying in a folder with the name

hest ?ko

Then compilation works fine, but SyncTeX in the PDF viewer fails.

Renaming the dir to

hest nisse

then synctex in the viewer works fine.

This was tested on WinXP and verified on Win 7.


* I was wondering, will the TL manager opdate TeXWorks when a new 
version arrives? I noticed that apparently MikTeX ships with a newer 
TeXWorks version (at least it had a scripts menu item, which my test 
version does not have)

Yes. There is an option to turn this on and off. If the user
is not admin it will be installed into his sub-tree only.

At installation time simply disable the integration.

Or, you can also use 
	tlmgr postaction ....
to add/remove the integration.

Cannot comment on that.

Really? Is there a newer texworks version out there than the one
in TL? If yes please let me know and we update it, no problem.

Message-ID: <a6e8c1d1002110521k7a78374aobf3e4455d45d9da9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have had a couple of people report a bug in jadetex on TeX Live
2009/OpenBSD. I will try my best to explain, but i know very little of
SGML.

If we go to the jadetex homepage there are some examples
(http://jadetex.sourceforge.net/#index-div-d18e385). If I follow these
instructions, all is fine (other than a warning from openjade, not
sure if that is important).

edd-i386% openjade -t tex -d demo.dsl demo.sgm

or directory)

If I use pdfjadetex in place of jadetex, I do not get a PDF, but instead a DVI:

A pdf *is* written and appears to look correct, but something seems wrong here?

 * should pdfjadtex output pdf by default?
 * should we bet getting those warnings?
 * should we be getting the openjade warning?

Do other users on different systems get this? Linux, Solaris... etc...

Thanks

I'm not sure, just noticed the 'scripts' menu that isn't in the TL
installated TeXWorks

It might be something that MikTeX have added.

I didn't follow TW developement recently, but at some point, there was two
unofficial patches, one adding Lua scripting support, the other adding printing
support, and Alain Delmotte maintained windows builds of TW with those patches
included.

According to the official TW page on tug.org, version the 0.2.x branch is the
stable branch and doesn't offer those features, which are listed in the "future"
section. (And IIRC, Jonathan may prefer to provide scripting in QtScript (of
whatever Qt calls their ECMAscript variant) rather than in Lua, for practical
reasons, so I don't think it's a good idea to provide Lua scripting to users if
it is to disappear in the next version...)

I believe MikTeX ships a build based on the texworks svn development
sources, which are considered unstable, experimental code where features may
be added, revised, or even possibly removed. There has been quite a bit of
work on scripting support here, including several iterations on the
scripting APIs; there will eventually be a new "stable" release that will
include this functionality as well as other new/updated features, but it may
not exactly match the experimental code MikTeX has chosen to ship.

Personally, I think it was premature for the MikTeX people to ship the
unstable development code as a standard part of their distro. But they've
never asked my view about it.

Ahh, that explains it. Thanks Jonathan.

BTW does the svn versions fix the other problem we had with TW and 
non-ascii letters in folder names?

\setsubsecheadstyle{\large\scshape\raggedright}
\setsubsubsecheadstyle{\scshape\raggedright}


but as soon as i try to make the font bold, the font style \scshape gets
overwritten by the default font in italics or bold ....

any option for getting sections in bold and with font "\scshape"

and you're using a font family that supplies bold and italic small caps?

the .fd files you're using are specifying that substitution for the
combination you're asking for, since they "believe" there's no font in
the family that satisfies your request.

if your fonts do have the appropriate shapes, then you need to complain
to the supplier of your .fd files.

find (and possibly then buy) a font family that offers it.  i don't
believe there are any free ones meeting this requirement, but that could
just be memory fade on my part.

and before asking your next question, consider

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=gethelp

for advice on an appropriate mailing list to ask these sorts of
question.

It may be a bit more difficult. Commercial fonts do not consider small
caps a font shape but rather a family that contains upright and italic
 shapes in medium and boldface. I have such commercial fonts.

    I think the "different behaviour based on executable name" trend 

It's not a "trend", it's a historical fact.

I am not a fan of it either, as a matter of principle.  But I also don't
see any harm in it, when there are options to achieve the same behavior.

    in TeX world is really a bad idea and should die,

It will never die.  latex, pdflatex, etc., as executable names that one
can type are obviously not going to go away.  And having them be links
is much cleaner than wrapper scripts.

As for getnonfreefonts, Reinhard was following the pattern established
for fmtutil, etc., of course.  Perhaps we should not have started with
that -sys suffix, but just used a --sys option, but it's too late now.

IMHO, it's never too late to abandon a bad idea and adopt a good one

Hi Edd,

     * should pdfjadtex output pdf by default?
Yes.

     * should we bet getting those warnings?

No.  They come from our incorrectly dumping the .fmt with the dvips
driver loaded (for hyperref) instead of the pdftex driver.  Whether 
jadetex actually does anything that could expose a real problem there, I
don't know.  Seems possible.

I have committed a new pdfjadetex.ini to TeX Live that (I believe)
solves these things.  It is also attached.  I don't know if
pdfjadetex.fmt will be automatically rebuilt via tlmgr (but presumably
that's not relevant for you anyway).

I'll also attach the demo.tex file I was using for the record, since it
is not easy to find (and there are two of them).

     * should we be getting the openjade warning?
     openjade:E: cannot open "/usr/local/share/builtins.dsl" (No such file

I don't know.  openjade is not part of TeX Live and I know nothing about
it.  Looks like it depends entirely on how you configured and installed
it.

    Do other users on different systems get this? Linux, Solaris... etc...

Yes, it was system-independent.

Thanks for the report.

That's the question of compatibility. A lot of tools may depend on the

Image type, the default 'png' does not work out of the box (complains

Hi Arthur/Karl --

Well, I checked (the most recent part of) my notes, and I think there's
a pretty good chance that what I say here is really what I've converged
on.  (It's possible I've forgotten something from earlier in my notes.)

 A> A cleaner, more thorough way of handling things would be for bibtex to
 A> understand what a TeX control sequence is,

 K> Or url.  I surmise it should only break lines at known good places, and
 K> there is no known-good place, it shouldn't break at all, overriding
 K> max_print_line.

My current plan is pretty much as Karl suggests here, where a "known
good place" is tentatively set to be defined as white space (but not
including the TeX tie character ~).  One issue I still need to check,
notes suggest, is whether Bill Gates's (evil) decision to allow spaces
in file names means that breaking at that space in a url (if it's
allowed in a url) will somehow mess things up.  I assume not, but as I
say, I want to check to make sure.

So can someone who really knows this stuff tell me whether breaking at
a whitespace character will ever be a real problem?  (I know it's
possible to redefine things in TeX to make all hell break loose, but
I'm not counting that as a real problem.)

[Historical note: The reason we (that is, I) got into this mess in the
first place -- possibly breaking a line in the middle of a TeX control
sequence -- was that I was assured by one of the TeX gurus (probably
this was a miscommunication) that it was always okay to insert a % and
then break the line at that point.]

Yes, that's pretty accurate, except for an ETA for a bug-fix for just
this bug.  (Karl: I'll contact you offline within a day or two to

Hi Phil,

context comes to help :-)

Puff also (beside brothel) means 'phut', 'thump', 'pouf' or 'toke'.
If you know the context, it becomes clearer (so not always).

Cheers,
      Volker

For the record, according to RFC 3986, a URI (hence a URL) can't contain a
literal space (ascii 32) character: such characters must be percent-encoded when
forming the URI.

Now, I'm not sure it's the question here. The problem with URLs is that they may
be very long strings (longer than max_print_line), so bibtex should be able to
ignore max_print_line when no "known good place" for line-breaking is found.

Well, if url.sty is used, it seems to me that the "argument" of the \url command
is read verbatim, and it is never ok to break inside something which is read
verbatim. On the other hand, as mentioned above, there should be no space in
(conforming) URLs, so this problem could possibly be ignored (and anyway, the
current behaviour already is incompatible with verbatim reading).

the url package copes correctly with bibtex's (established) line breaking
technique: it ignores the "%" and the end of line.  (details in the doc
show that feature appeared in v 1.6, jun 2002.)

quite how it would react to oren's proposed new setup is (currently)
more than i would understand.  however, we already know that spaces
shouldn't appear in urls.

I'm sorry that I haven't done anything yet, but I still have to find out what the incoming directory is ;-)
Maybe ftp://ftp.tug.ctan.org//incoming/ ? But that is completely empty?!

You don't need to be sorry. The packages lacking pdf documentation have been in
this state for a while, so few weeks more won't hurt much.

> but I still have to find out what the incoming directory is ;-)

I was referring ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/incoming/ which I tend to use when I don't
want to use the web upload form for some reason. But I suppose these details
would be best discussed on the ctan list, since they don't really concern TeX Live.

If however you notice a package that has pdf documentation on CTAN but not in TL
(I'm sure there are such packages) please tell us on this list.

Thanks again,
Manuel.

I always thought that ftp incoming directories are usually write-only
but now I found this:

   ftp://ftp.dante.de/incoming/README.uploads

------------------------------------------------------------------
To upload material to CTAN you should use a web form.  Visit one
of these pages
  http://dante.ctan.org/upload   (in Germany)
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/upload    (in the UK)
  http://tug.ctan.org/upload     (in the US)
Instructions for preparation of your materials are included there.

If for some reason the form is awkward then you can write to the
administrators at the mailing list ctan (at) dante.de to make
other arrangements.

well, it would be: you've not uploaded anything yet.  there's rather
more dribble on ftp.tex.ac.uk/incoming, but that's just my untidiness.
(apart from the actual upload that pressure of work stopped me installing
earlier, i now remember.)

as manuel says, ftp.tex.ac.uk:/incoming is the only ctan site that
accepts ftp uploads, now.

if you want to upload a complete package, use
http://www.ctan.org/upload.html, http://www.dante.de/CTAN/upload.html or
http://www.tex.ac.uk/upload.html (that list comes from the faq,
www.tex.ac.uk/faq).  the upload pages lead you through what's needed.

I have just uploaded the two PDFs mentioned originally (for ucs and german). I've created a mess in the directory because I didn't know that only two levels of subdirectories are allowed, sorry for that.

and so far, i've dealt with the 2in1 package -- it's moved to a
directory of its own, like earlier m/l/c/misc packages that have gained
doc files.

macros/latex/contrib/twoinone

i'm just a teeny bit concerned about the other two packages.

(1) languages.pdf (~= 20mbytes) seems a bit over the top -- the
uncompressed  .ps.gz is only 850kbytes or so.  how did you
create it -- i don't know the app that pdfinfo tells me about?

if its a fresh compile?  or a distill of some sort?

ucs.pdf is also apparently huge by comparison with ucs.ps.gz, but not
quite so over the top

(2) there already _is_ a gerdoc.pdf on the archive.  i don't actually
understand why it's not in tl already

Probably because the file is more recent (2007) that the last update of german
in TL (me too lazy to find the precise date), and this package is not in our
"new" (anyway much newer that the last actual update to the package)
update-check system.

I just installed gerdoc.pdf in TL. It's not the first time I notice this, and I
expect it's not the last either.

Dear Heiko, dear TeX Live gurus,

if we run pdfxmltex in TL 2009 in pdf mode it dies with:

>   (/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/context/base/supp-pdf.mkii
>   ! You can't use `macro parameter character #' in horizontal mode.

supp-pdf.mkii is loaded by hyperref.

That is hard to trigger in original upstream TeX Live because there
is another bug in the pdfxmltex.ini file in upstream TL2009, which 
makes it use dvi mode all the time, since it loads first pdftexconfig.ini
and then xmltex.ini which in turn loads latex.ini which in turn
turns off pdfoutput... I will fix that one myself, but the above
problem is still present.

Best wishes

Norbert

supp-pdf.mkii is loaded by pdftex.def, that is loaded by the
color package and the color package is loaded if hyperref has
seen option `colorlinks'.
  And pdftex.def uses \AtBeginDocument to load supp-pdf.mkii.

But the format pdfxmltex has not loaded neither color nor hyperref.
And the log file of debian that is shown for debian bug report 566591
only shows supp-pdf.mkii without hyperref and without color or pdftex.def.
But the .log file is generated by xmlto (I don't know it), that
seems to use a different format than TL's pdfxmltex.

Yours sincerely

i installed it as part of my occasional campaign to document things that
are without docs:

Thu 04 Jan 2007 12:33:02 rf10: -new gerdoc.pdf language/german/gerdoc.pdf

obviously this fact got missed...  perhaps i should send a message to tl
when i do these things?

using distiller 9 (i think it is, on that server[*]),i get:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 rf10  763230 2010-02-13 08:09 languages.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 rf10  864713 2010-02-13 08:06 languages.ps
-rwxr-xr-x 1 rf10  129807 2010-02-13 08:10 ucs.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 rf10  152497 2010-02-13 08:06 ucs.ps

by contrast, your files are:

--w-r----- 1 ctan 20724260 2010-02-12 21:53 languages.pdf
--w-r----- 1 ctan  3638287 2010-02-12 21:56 ucs.pdf

it occurs to me that someone more expert than i in understanding pdf
files might understand what you've done, better than i.

this is now understood -- manuel has installed my original.

robin

[*] i have access to a "windows terminal server" which talks to the same
file server as the un*x world talks to.  very good it is, too, except
where the file protections are something arcane.

Yep, I think it would be good. Quite often, packages with dvi documentation
weren't updated in a long time, and that's precisely these packages that are
most likely to escape our update detection system.

Perhaps it is not necessary to disturb the whole list, just Karl and me would be
enough.

Sure!

Ah, ok, that is a long queue I didn't get.

I attach a .fo file that is intermediately generated by xmlto. Running
pdfxmltex on it shows the same problem. I also attach the log file of
running it through pdfxmltex.

All that was done on an up2date TL2009 (not Debian package) with
a fixed pdfxmltex (that does pdf output).

Do you have any idea what is going on here?

Best wishes

I have opened the PS files in the previewer application of OS X which automatically converts them to PDF. I don't know why the resulting files are that large. However, I've just created and uploaded the PDFs again, this time with ps2pdf. Now they are even smaller than the corresponding uncompressed PS files.

Subject: [tex-live] page size bug or problem
Message-ID: <19318.41475.972077.520933@t1000.bb-c.de>

Hello everybody,

after using teTeX for a long time, I have recently switched to
TeX Live 2009 on Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris, and to MacTeX 2009
on OS X Leopard.

My TeX Live has a default page size A4, but unfortunately it seems
that A4 output is all it wants to produce.

Running "tex sizetestplain.tex" produces sizetestplain.dvi with A4
size, with the following input in sizetestplain.tex:
\hsize=100mm
\vsize=150mm
Hello.
\bye

Running "pdflatex sizetestlatex.tex" produces sizetestlatex.pdf with
A4 size, with the following input in sizetestlatex.tex:
\documentclass{article}
\setlength{\paperheight}{150mm}
\setlength{\paperwidth}{100mm}
\begin{document}
Hello.
\end{document}

That didn't happen with teTeX 3.  Using that, I got output files
with height 150mm and width 100mm.

That's a bug in TeX Live 2009, right?
(I think a default should be a default.)

Thanks in advance for any helpful comment!
Rainer

or \usepackage[some options]{zwpagelayout} - a different approach to
setting tha page layout

Remember that \paperheight and \paperwidth may (or may not) be used by
LaTeX classes and packages for setting some dimensions. Pdf(la)tex get
the paper size form \pdfpageheight and \pdfpagewidth. If they are not
set, there is some logic how to set them. Dvips and dvipdfm takes the
dimentsions from \special{papersize=...} or from the command line
options. The above mentioned packages take care of setting the paper
dimensions according to the driver.

Others have mentioned the geometry package, but as
you mention tetex a bit more explanation might be
helpful.

There have been many changes from tetex days.  Now
pdftex is used to produce both .dvi and .pdf output. With
tex+dvips, the papersize was contolled by dvips (perhaps
based on \specials for some macro packages, but usually
set in the dvips config file).  For .pdf output, the default
papersize is set in the pdftex configuration.   We now have
latex macros (geometry package) that allow you to
set paper size for both output formats without changing
the document.

You will need to take care if you have legacy documents
that assume pdftex is used only for .pdf output -- for latex
you will want the ifpdf macros.

I've revised the beta and I've just submitted
the new version (v5.0) of geometry package to CTAN.
It'll be distributed soon anyway, but the archive file
is attached here for you.
(geometry.ins is removed from the archive
 for Gmail's security reason...
 you can get geometry.sty with command
"tex geometry.dtx" anyway.)

I hope it works well in XeTeX.
See the document pdf for details and other new features.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Hideo

Of course it did.  Nothing was changed in this respect.

 > Using that, I got output files with height 150mm and width 100mm.

No, you didn't.  In the plain TeX example you even don't attempt to
change the paper size, \hsize and \vsize do something completely
different.  In the LaTeX example you only set some variables but don't
load a package which passes their values to the back-ends. 
 
 > That's a bug in TeX Live 2009, right?

No.  TeX Live 2009 behaves exactly like teTeX 3 in this respect.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] [patch] More consistent paper handling in texconfig
Message-ID: <877hqg97fm.fsf@alhambra.kuesterei.ch>

Dear TeX Live folks,

currently texconfig(-sys) handles the setting of the default papersize
differently for each executable involved.  The result is that "texconfig
paper" only accepts a4 and letter, although most of the individual
executables can handle many more.

Attached is a patch that addresses this issue.  I'll explain it a bit,
and below is a general remark which might be interesting even for those
who don't care about papers (look for "reimplement").  I would be glad
if you could apply it, or make suggestions what needs to be improved.

1. The patch handles default paper settings for pdftex, dvips, xdvi,
   dvipdfmx and also dvipdfm (I know the latter is just a symlink, but the
   code is still there in texconfig, so I "fixed" it).

2. First it adds a function to read and show the current default paper
   setting.  And while I was at it, I added calls to these functions to
   the output of "texconfig confall".

3. Then, I use the papersize information from config.ps to get the
   information for the functions SizeToPaper and PaperToSize.  It might
   be better to add a separate file containing this information for the
   purposes of texconfig, but I didn't do this yet.

4. Now pdftex can be configured to use any default paper that dvips
   knows about, by querying the dimensions using PaperToSize.  Most of
   them will never be used, but it's hard to draw a line.

5. I've updated the list of papers that xdvi knows about from its
   source.  There's also a function I used for that.  It lists which
   papers are known to xdvi only, to dvips only, and to both - but that
   is not meant for users and hence commented.

6. Thus, the intersection of sizes accepted by "texconfig paper" is now

   a0 a1 a10 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 c5 ledger legal letter tabloid


While I was working on texconfig, I found it hard to navigate in the
file, and keep a feeling where I was.  In case this will be
reimplemented in lua (or perl or whatever), I suggest that someone
should clean it up a bit.  I suggest to, and have already followed this:

In tcBatch, there shouldn only be 2 directly nested case statements, and
no real code in there.  Instead, the main commandline parsing should
only look for the first and second word, and then call a function to do
all the rest. The functions should be in different sections of the file,
one group containing those directly called from the tcBatch $@ parsing,
the other (already existing) group with functions that are re-used all
over the program.

Regards, Frank

Err, not for that - it was me who read xdvi.c.

The function only parses the information in texconfig itself.

Hi Frank,

    Attached is a patch that addresses this issue.  

Thanks.  I will happily review/incorporate it in days to come?

Did you do this because somebody actually wanted a default paper size
other than letter|a4?  If so, I'm curious about their situation.

There is also tlmgr paper letter :(.

TL's fmtutil.cnf contains:

| # from xmltex:
| xmltex pdftex language.dat xmltex.ini
| pdfxmltex pdftex language.dat pdfxmltex.ini

Because of the missing `*' in front of the .ini files e-TeX
is disabled. Accidently or on purpose?

Thanks.

If someone thinks, I am paranoid because of the excessive
catcode settings, then this example proves that I must be
even more paranoid.

Therefore I added more settings to \GPT at catcodes
(backslash, curly braces, space, tab, endline char).

pdftex.def 0.04n is available temporarily:
  http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~oberdiek/tmp/pdftex.def
CTAN update is on its way, but I had problems updating the
berlios project of pdftex.def.

Subject: [tex-live] Bug#566591: pdfxmltex stumbles over supp-pdf.mkii
In-Reply-To: <20100213110814.GC12017@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>
Message-ID: <201002140055.o1E0t39c004102@f7.net>

First, I checked in the fix for pdfxmltex.ini.

    (/home/norbert/tl/2009/texmf-dist/tex/context/base/supp-pdf.mkii
    ! You can't use `macro parameter character #' in horizontal mode.
    l.82     \def\@@mptopdf@@twodigitrounding#

Is there any way to "escape" into TeX in an xmltex document?

Anyway, to make a start at debugging this, I copied xmltex.cfg to my current
directory and appended
  {\globaldefs=1\loggingall}\nonstopmode
as the last line.  The resulting big log file shows that supp-pdf.mkii
is being read with unusual (xmltex's, I suppose) catcodes.  \, for
example, expands to \utfeightay \

Since supp-pdf.mkii is being loaded at \begin{document} time, I suppose
xmltex's catcodes are already in effect.  \GPT at catcodes seems to be
getting invoked, and it doesn't include \catcode`\\=0.  And just adding
it in the obvious way caused new and worse errors.

Evidently color is getting loaded by xmltex's sec.xmt, which is what
triggers the rest.  And presumably that is necessary.  So I guess we
somehow have to either arrange for the right catcodes to be set, or add
an option to pdftex.def to tell it not to load supp-pdf.mkii.  I tried
disabling those inputs in pdftex.def, and then your sample .fo did get
processed ok.  And xmltex is not likely to need to transparently read
.mps files.

No solution yet, but that's my allotment for today.

Hello,

biblatex 0.9 has finally been released. 0.8x contained this statement in the manual:
"Please be advised that this package is in beta stage and released for testing. The version number will be stepped up to 1.0 as soon as it is considered suitable for general distribution. \tex distributors are advised to wait for version 1.0."
This sentence has been removed in the 0.9 manual. Now I wonder whether TeX Live will include 0.9, or wait for 1.0.

Regards,
Philipp

ACK. Remember: "texconfig paper" sets the systemwide default. I think
_very_ few people will use something else than a4 or letter for that.

Message-ID: <201002150212.35408.crpg@aha.ru>

I have reproduced the following problem in Debian and Gentoo, so I believe it 
is an upstream bug.

In texlive-2007 listings packages has typed a correct line number within a file 
listing. For example, '\lstinputlisting[firstline=20, lastline=25]{..}' command 
starts numeration counting from '20'.

In texlive-2009, listings package always starts counting from '1', ignoring 
'firstline'.  For example, '\lstinputlisting[firstline=20, lastline=20]{..}' 
starts line numbers from '1' instead of '20'. So, the listing first line will 
have a number '1' but in fact it is a line number '20'.

Due to this bug, a document included partial file listing will have invalid 
listings line numbers after recompilation. I have received no warning or error 
during 'pdflatex' run so this bug is a very unpleasant surprise.

The minimal example follows.

======================
% File 'test01.tex'
\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{
numbers=left,
stepnumber=1
}
\begin{document} % this is a line number 9, not 1!
\lstinputlisting[firstline=9, lastline=11, language=TeX]{test01.tex}
\end{document}
======================

Debian bug #569576.

This is an up-upstream bug. TeX Live takes what there is on CTAN.
That has to be breought to the authors of listints, currently AFAIS

Who knows.

In the old times we had
	xmltex          pdftex  language.dat    &latex xmltex.ini
	pdfxmltex       pdftex  language.dat    &pdflatex pdfxmltex.ini
so it was based on the latex format. THat could create some problems,
so we moved the loading of latex.ini into the xmltex.ini files.

Should I add the *?

I don't have any opinion on that.

Accident, at least I can't see any reason not to enable etex extensions
here.  We do so for jadetex.  I think I just forgot the darn *.

To be short: in TEXMFHOME

E.g.
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/latex
for latex stuff or
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/plain
for plain tex stuff.

For precise location of TEXMFHOME on Windows read TL 2007 documentation (search for TEXMFHOME).

More details and some explanation could be found here

P.S. I advise you to upgrade your TeX system.

change \input xdvipdfmx.con in your pstricks.con into

\input  xdvipdfmx.cfg

or rename the CTAN/graphics/pstricks/base/config/xdvipdfmx.cfg
to pstricks.con

Or just ask kpsewhich: open a command prompt (Start Menu -> Execute -> cmd.exe)

Note that you may need to create this directory, and that the tex/ component is

AFAIR since Vista "Execute" (or "Run") was removed. You may either use "Start

I was wondering, have mpost been changed such that

input ../file.mp

is no longer allowed?

A user complained, that his file from last year didn't work any more.

If it have been changed, do we have any options to change this back for 
our own site?

Message-ID: <201002151554.33147.crpg@aha.ru>

I have reproduced the following problem in Debian and Gentoo, so I believe it 
is an up-upstream bug.

In Texlive 2007, listings packages has typed a correct line number within a 
file listing. For example, '\lstinputlisting[firstline=20, lastline=25]{..}' 
command starts numeration counting from '20'. This behaviour confirms 
documentation manual.

In Texlive 2009, listings package always starts counting from '1', ignoring 
'firstline'.  For example, '\lstinputlisting[firstline=20, lastline=20]{..}' 
starts line numbers from '1' instead of '20'. So, the listing first line will 
have a number '1' but in fact it is a line number '20'.

Due to this bug, a document included partial file listing will have invalid 
listings line numbers after recompilation. I have received no warning or error 
during 'pdflatex' run so this bug is a very unpleasant surprise.

The minimal example follows.

======================
% File 'test01.tex'
\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{
numbers=left,
stepnumber=1
}

\begin{document} % this is a line number 9, not 1!
\lstinputlisting[firstline=9, lastline=11, language=TeX]{test01.tex}
\end{document}
======================

Debian bug #569576.

I've done a little more testing. I think it is his files that have a problem

this simple setup seems to work fine on Linux:


hest.mp:

beginfig(1);
draw fullcircle scaled 3cm;
endfig;

t.mp:

input ../hest.mp
end;

works fine

sorry about the noise

The RELEASE notes are very clear:

"I have received many inquiries about why biblatex is not yet
included in TeX Live and MikTeX and why I was maintaining that nasty
do-not-distribute clause. There seems to be some confusion about
what the term 'stable' means. The point typically brought up was
that biblatex runs well and is thus 'stable'. Well, in that sense,
biblatex has been pretty stable since version 0.1. However, it has
not been stable in the sense of maintaining backwards compatibility
since version 0.1. *This release, however, is finally considered
suitable for wider distribution.*"

The question whether or when biblatex will be included in TeX Live is of 
course entirely the responsability of the TL maintainers, though I 
personally have no doubts that it sooner or later will.

a bit more careful this time

assume a dir structure:

t2.mp
sub/t1.mp

t2.mp:

beginfig(1);
draw fullcircle scaled 3cm;
label(btex $A$ etex, origin);
endfig;
end;

t1.mp:

verbatimtex
%&latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
etex
input "../t2.mp"
end;


if I go to 'sub' and run

mpost t1.mp

I get the following error:

This is MetaPost, version 1.208 (kpathsea version 5.0.0)
(./t1.mp (../t2.mp
 >> t2.mp
 >> t2.mpx
! Unable to make mpx file.
l.3 label(btex
                $A$ etex, origin);
Transcript written on t1.log.

it seems the labeling feature want to create a mpx file for the included 
file

this is a bit contrary to the way TeX handles input.

Is this a feature or a bug in mpost?

if t2.mp is moved to

sub/subsub/t2.mp

and we include that instead, I get a similar error.

Any ideas as to what have changed, and how this can be fixed?

Thank you very much for your responses.
?
I followed your instruction and it showed:
?
c:/TexLive2007/../texmf-local
?
But there's no texmf-local subdirectory under TexLive2007. Instead there's texmf-local directory right under c:/ along with TexLive2007. (c:/TexLive2007, c:/texmf-local,...)
?
Under c:/texmf-local there are 4 subdirectories: doc, dvips, fonts and tex.
?
Can you tell me which?
?
For upgrading:?last year I tried to upgrade to TexLive2008, but I have had bad experiences, so I try not to anymore as long as TexLive2007 along with metapost 0.9 work. (Or until new TexLive could be downloaded with a couple of simple ?clicks)
?
Thanks,
Steve

To be short: in TEXMFHOME

E.g.
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/latex
for latex stuff or
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/plain
for plain tex stuff.

For precise location of TEXMFHOME on Windows read TL 2007 documentation (search for TEXMFHOME).

More details and some explanation could be found here

P.S. I advise you to upgrade your TeX system.

A quick test indicated that the search for mp input (and generation of
mpx output) files for labels does not take the specified path into
account.

I'll apply a fix to the next metapost release, but for now probably
the only thing you can do is add '..' to the MPINPUTS search path.

Thanks for your hints and explanations.
I'm going to use the geometry package for LaTeX.

I notice that nobody commented on what I said about DVI files produced
by plain tex (not LaTeX).  That's good, because I was wrong.
The DVI files _do_ reflect my page specifications, except that the page
height is always 8.435mm larger than what I requested.
I have yet to check whether teTeX's tex did that, too.

Thanks again,
Rainer

The same file worked perfectly about three weeks ago (when I started to write it).

So I tried with my linux box with the same error. 

Well, maybe something is changed and I have just to simplify my

but using the example on sourceforge (see the bottom of this message) 
I got the same problem. 

Do you have the same problem ?

The same file worked perfectly about three weeks ago (when I started to write it).

So I tried with my linux box with the same error. 

Well, maybe something is changed and I have just to simplify my 
preamble.... let me try first with a standard example.... 
but using the example on sourceforge (see the bottom of this message) 
I got the same problem. 

Do you have the same problem ?

Thanks,

You left out the details: how do you request page size in
plain tex? And do you mean text size or paper size?

The dvi format has no provision for paper size data. Setting
\hsize and \vsize simple determines the width of paragraph
lines and vertical amount of text (ignoring \headline and
\footline) at which page breaks occur.

Paper sizes are determined by the dvi post-processors, as
follows:
  1. What paper is in the printer, if printed.
  2. How xdvi (or whatever dvi previewer) is configure, if
     viewed on screen (this is just to put a white
     background rectangle on the screen).
  3. How dvips is configured or by \special commands for
     dvips, if dvips is used to generated ps.
  4. How dvipdfm(x) is configured or by \special commands for
     dvipdfm(x), if dvipdfm(x) is used to generated pdf.
  5. How GSview (or whatever PS viewer) is configured, if ps
     output is viewed on screen (again, just for the white
     background).
  6. If pdftex is use to produce pdf, the dimension registers
     \pdfpageheight and \pdfpagewidth determine what paper size
     is specified in the output file. Defaults are stored in the
     format files.

The number 8.435mm is almost exactly 24pt, which is the extra
space taken in plain tex for the footline (page number). Note
that plain tex adds this on after the amount of space determined
by \vsize. If you are measuring from top of text to bottom of
page number, then that exactly accounts for the extra 8.435mm.
Plain tex (in all distributions) has always behaved this way.

This can be verified by the following simple demonstration :

\hsize = 200 true pt
\vsize = 100 true pt
\let \Shipout = \shipout
\def \shipout #1#2{\setbox 0 = #1 {#2}\showbox 0 \Shipout #1 {#2}}
\hbox {}
\end

which yields (in the log file)

 > \box 0 = \vbox (124.0 + 0.0) x 200.0

(spaces interpolated for ease of reading).

Howdy,

Brought up by epicurus on the OS X TeX list.

It appears to be typo in texdoc.cnf:

alais german = gerdoc

should be

alias german = gerdoc

Good Luck,

It's not so much "they", it's rather "it", Debian's libpaper.

There have been many requests by users to configure TeX's default paper
sizes automatically according to libpaper, which is supposed to be the
central place in Debian to specify which paper will be found in the
attached printer's main trays.  Of course, all people that actually
complained wanted to use letter (those that want a4 are, by chance,
happy with the default in Debian's TeXLive packages).

I don't know whether anyone actually uses other papers as default, but
libpaper supports many more:

$ paperconf -a | tr '\n' ','
a4,letter,note,legal,executive,halfletter,halfexecutive,11x17,
statement,folio,quarto,10x14,ledger,tabloid,a0,a1,a2,a3,a5,a6,
a7,a8,a9,a10,b0,b1,b2,b3,b4,b5,b6,b7,b8,b9,b10,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,
c7,c8,DL,Comm10,Monarch,archE,archD,archC,archB,archA,flsa,flse,
csheet,dsheet,esheet

I don't plan to support all those.  But I'd rather support a couple more
than necessary, and never test the code for the error case in the real
world.  I know computers whose only attached local printer uses a3, and
of course a0 (but you wouldn't want to send quick test documents
there).  In a print-on-demand company, maybe the default size is
something special, too.

> There is also tlmgr paper letter :(.

There's no tlmgr in texlive, so I have no experience - what does it do?

Of course, for all "paper-producing" TeX applications.  And "texconfig
dvips paper" sets the systemwide default for dvips.  Why don't you
restrict that to letter and a4?  And what about dvipdfmx?

I'm sure that in Debian quite a couple will do, and if only for testing
whether libpaper is properly supported.  I'm not sure about real
use-cases.  

But I also don't see a reason to allow all sizes that xdvi, dvips, and
dvipdfmx understand for those, but only letter and a4 for pdftex and for
all.

It's the TeX Live (package) Manager. It's not included in "downstream" TeX Live
such as the one you package for Debian, but in "vanilla" TeX Live it takes care
of package install/update/removal (which explains why it is not in downstream
versions) as well as a few other things like regenerating databases and formats,
 and setting the default paper size.

The man page is online in case you'd like to read it:

What kind of bad experiences?

If your network connection is good, you unpack install-tl.zip, run
install-tl.bat, select what to install and wait. texmf-local intentionally
is not below TeXLive2007, your personal file will be used by later TL
versions as well, no need to reinstall.

My computer sits on a gigabit backbone, our local mirror is about 5 miles
apart so installation of scheme-full takes about 9 minutes but normal users
will probably have to wait longer.

Thanks for your response.

<<c:/texmf-local/tex

?
This directory is empty. Also I use latex. Do I need to create TEXMFHOME or can I just?use c:/texmf-local/tex instead for my purpose? i.e., move all my frequently used input file in?here to call from any working directory. 
?
<<What kind of bad experiences?>>
?
After a couple of days of struggling (with a lot of help from experts in this site), I was finally succeeded in downloading TexLive2008, but pdf file showed smaller size output. I used (still using Latex-->dvips-->pstopdf.
?
Again I asked many people from this site, but I don't even know whether the problem was solved or not. Since then, I decided to stick to TexLive2007 until I need more function.

?
<<..installation of scheme-full takes about 9 minutes ..>>
That's amazing! I remember it took more than 6 hours last year! It's very tempting to try again, maybe.
?
Thanks again,
Steve

To be short: in TEXMFHOME


E.g.
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/latex
for latex stuff or
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/plain
for plain tex stuff.


For precise location of TEXMFHOME on Windows read TL 2007 documentation (search for TEXMFHOME).

P.S. I advise you to upgrade your TeX system.

Subject: [tex-live] xdvipdfmx.con is missing from PSTricks
In-Reply-To: <4B78F39F.6080000@FU-Berlin.DE>
Message-ID: <201002160151.o1G1pABF025605@f7.net>

    change \input xdvipdfmx.con in your pstricks.con into
    \input  xdvipdfmx.cfg

In TL, I (1) included the pstricks/config dir in the runtime (it's
amazing to me that generic names like "dvips.cfg" don't have filename
clashes, but apparently they don't), and (2) changed the two files
  texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/xetex-pstricks/pstricks.con
  texmf-dist/tex/xetex/xetex-pstricks/pstricks.con
to \input xdvipdfmx.cfg instead of xdvipdfmx.con.

If someone can confirm (after tonight's update) that this actually
works, I will upload to CTAN.

Thanks,
Karl

I can rename all cfg files to con. No real problem.

That bug has been closed now, it is wrong usage of the package.

a simple ...[firstnumber=9, ...] fixes it.

LaTeX will first look into texmf-local/tex/latex and its subdirectories,
then to texmf-local/tex and its subdirectories. So it depends on a number of
files. If you have just a few files, you can put all of them to
texmf-local/tex. If you have a lot of file, this may be confusing to you. It
may then be better to create some directory structure under
texmf-local/tex/latex similarly as exists under texmf-dist/tex/latex. Do not
forget to rebuild the file name database after you put the files to
texmf-local.

It's unlikely that this is a TL problem. There's a posting on ctt that
reports the same error. Message-ID: <7tuc3aF4hpU1 at mid.individual.net>.
The latest release of geometry seems to break beamer. You may want to
contact the author of the geometry package about this.

geometry 5.0 has removed the  options: 'compat2' and this breaks
some code in beamerbasecompatibility.sty. 
There is already a report in the beamer bug database.

In the meanwhile use this 

\makeatletter\let\ifGm at compatii\relax\makeatother
\documentclass{beamer}

does tl have the new geometry package (5.1) released last night?  (it
doesn't look so from my mirror, but i updated the catalogue at 2316 gmt,
after the new version had been installed on ctan.)

i had assumed that the new version was in response to the c.t.t error
report.

No, 5.1. gives the same error. beamerbasecompatibility.sty contains
the code

\ifx\ifGm at compatii\@undefined%
\def\Gm at lmargin{\Geom at lmargin}\def\Gm at rmargin{\Geom at rmargin}
\else
\geometry{includeheadfoot}
\fi

but geometry no longer defines the switch \ifGm at compatii.

I would say beamer should change its code. It doesn't sound senseful
to maintain compabilitity to geometry 2.0.

I?transfer an input file in c:/texmf-local/tex from working directory and tested, but it didn't work. Maybe, the latex commend didn't search c:/texmf-local/tex.?So, this is not my TEXMFHOME.

I tried c:/TexLive2007/texmf/tex/latex, but it also didn't work.

Is there anyway, I create a directory and put all the common input file in there and call from any working directory?

If your network connection is good, you unpack install-tl.zip, run install-tl.bat, select what to install and wait. texmf-local intentionally is not below TeXLive2007, your personal file will be used by later TL versions as well, no need to reinstall.

My computer sits on a gigabit backbone, our local mirror is about 5 miles apart so installation of scheme-full takes about 9 minutes but normal users will probably have to wait longer.

To be short: in TEXMFHOME


E.g.
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/latex
for latex stuff or
%USERPROFILE%/texmf/tex/plain
for plain tex stuff.


For precise location of TEXMFHOME on Windows read TL 2007 documentation (search for TEXMFHOME).

The appropriate place is TEXMFHOME.  Run 

    kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME

in order to find out where it is.  If you put files somewhere else
then you have to run texhash in order to update the file database.

Did you ever condider to read the TeX Live Guide?

Hi Lars,
it's not an Emacs for Windows.  It's GNU Emacs compiled on Windows
and bundled with AucTeX and a few extra DLLs for graphics support.

Regarding xpdf, it's the default on Unix.  AFAIK "start" is used in
order to invoke the default viewer on Windows.  Could you try again
with your .emacs temporarily removed?  I can't remember that I ever
had to configure this manually.

Do you have a default viewer (a file-type association for .pdf) at all?
Does 

  start "" <foo>.pdf

launch a viewer?  It's mandatory on Windows.

You should better discuss this with David.  I've put him to the CC.

I can't and don't want to provide a modified AucTeX for TL/Windows.

Simply because texconfig is not actively maintained anymore.

Maybe I should mention that I met Thomas Esser some time ago and asked
him why texconfig supports so many paper formats which don't qualify
as default values.  He told me that when he wrote texconfig, he
didn't care whether a particular size is useful, he just supported the
sizes provided by the various config files.

As far as tlmgr is concerned, I'm convinced that it's not necessary to
support anything but A4 or letter.  It's also not sensible to assign
different paper sizes to different engines except if an admin
deliberately want to confuse his users.  On the other hand, it doesn't
hurt that tlmgr supports all this, though unnecessary, and maybe
confusing.  But tlmgr is Norbert's child and he is the one who has to
decide.  IMO an A4/letter switch for all engines is sufficient.

Remember that we are talking about defaults:

How would you create an A0 poster?  Configure TL system-wide in order
to use A0 by default, switch back to A4 if you have to write a letter,
then switch back to A0 if you want to continue with the poster?  I'm
sure that nobody works this way.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sorry for being unclear - of course I know what tlmgr is.  I meant to
ask what "tlmgr paper letter" does.

Ah, thank you.  Should texconfig start configuring context's paper
default, too?  

What are your long-term plans?  Is it planned to let tlmgr replace
texconfig once in the future?  Or will texconfig continue to be present?
What's the status in Windows?  I guess cmd.exe might not be able to run
texconfig - should it be reimplemented in luatex?

    Should texconfig start configuring context's paper default, too?  

If you care enough about it to implement it and send me the patch, I
have no objection.  I won't be working on it myself.

    What are your long-term plans?  Is it planned to let tlmgr replace
    texconfig once in the future?  Or will texconfig continue to be
    present?
    
I expect that texconfig will exist forever, essentially in its present
state.  As you know, I'm happy to incorporate changes or make
simple-enough fixes, but do not plan to ever do any significant new
development. 

    What's the status in Windows?  I guess cmd.exe might not be able to run
    texconfig - 

Naturally it cannot run in "default" Windows, being a shell script.

    should it be reimplemented in luatex?

There is no need.  Essentially all of texconfig has already been
reimplemented (by Norbert) in tlmgr (in Perl, which we provide in TL).
Thus Windows users can run tlmgr.

Best,
Karl

Hm, it is not so easy but it is simple. Consider example: latex package
'geometry'. It is located in
TEXMFDIST/tex/latex/geometry
(file geometry.sty).

So if your want to use package FOO (file FOO.sty) and this package isn't
in TL then create directory
TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex/FOO
and copy this file into this directory.

Then refresh FNDB (file name database or ls-R in TL terminology) using
'mktexlsr'.

With plain tex 'packages' situation is similar.

You should give TL2009 a try. It could be installed in parallel with TL2007
(only executables should preceed TL2007 ones in PATH)

Yes. This is due to new version of geometry (v5.0) which doesn't have
compatability settings (see changes.txt). I think you should report
this problem to beamer developers too.

For workaround you could add this
\makeatletter
\newif\ifGm at compatii
\makeatother

_before_ \documentclass.

Subject: [tex-live] lualatex segfault when run sample beamer document
Message-ID: <20100216102009.GD4067@smoon2>

Hi.

When I was digging out one problem with beamer and geometry package I found
a bug with lualatex.

Lets consider this small example:

\documentclass{beamer}

\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}

\title{Example Presentation Created with the Beamer Package}
\author{Till Tantau}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\frame{\titlepage}

\section[Outline]{}
\frame{\tableofcontents}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview of the Beamer Class}
\frame
{
  \frametitle{Features of the Beamer Class}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Normal LaTeX class.
  \item<2-> Easy overlays.
  \item<3-> No external programs needed.      
  \end{itemize}
}
\end{document}

and run it through lualatex engine (this file should give an error if
geometry package of ver. 5.0 is used, see another messages in list).
(just before update the TL I saw the same behavior.)

The first run of lualatex is ok. I get pdf file but the second run right
after the first one is ended with lualatex segfault.

I checked this with upstream lualatex (TL 2009 with today update) and
lualatex from my distro (Archlinux). System: x86_64.

latex, pdflatex and xelatex run ok on this file.

It is documented in the AUCTeX installation notes that Ghostscript is

Put in the luatex bug tracker as

just in case it happens with the current luatex beta (0.50) as well.

If my memory serves me well, TL'07 still sets TEXMFCNF environment
variable that will mess things up for TL'09. So I don't think you can
easily install them in parallel without being somewhat knowledgeable
about the system.

Certainly not in the near future, as there are many technical 
difficulties to level out. I hope this can be achieved shortly before 
biblatex 2.0 comes out though, since that version will no longer support 
bibtex as a backend engine, and will thus be entirely dependent on Biber.

@Karl and Norbert, I did not have time to reply to you about this yet. I 
hope to do it tonight!

It should be possible though.  There are two files "texmf.cnf" in
TL2007: one for Unix and one for Windows.  TEXMFCNF points to the
Windows version.

  1. Determine where texmf.cnf for Windows resides
     (kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFCNF).

  2. Move this file to texlive/2007/bin/win32.  kpathsea looks there
     first and variables will not be overwritten by other texmf.cnf
     files found later. 

  3. Remove TEXMFCNF from the environment.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks. I have applied the patch for my local copy of beamer. The
terrible maintenance state of beamer is a concern since this package
seems to become very popular :(

    * TL's geometry.cfg should be removed, if the new geometry
      version hits TL, 

It has (as of a couple days ago).

      because the current geometry.cfg forces
      driver `pdftex' for geometry if XeTeX is used. A user might
      think, there is something wrong.

So I removed our previous geometry.cfg.

    * Because XeTeX supports many specials of dvipdfm, there might
      be a global option `dvipdfm'. Then \GM at checkdrivers does not
      check, whether XeTeX is running and uses option `dvipdfm'
      with a wrong result.

I didn't do anything to check on this.

Thanks,

Subject: [tex-live] xdvipdfmx says "** ERROR ** Capacity exceeded"
Message-ID: <4B7D3CD9.2070401@dimedis.de>

Dear tex-live users and wizards,

I've got a problem with xdvipdfmx trying to build a PDF from an xdvi
file compiled with xelatex.

The logfile is empty except for this:

<FONTMAP:cm-dvipdfm-fix.map><FONTMAP:dvipdfm.map><FONTMAP:cid-x.map>
** WARNING ** DVI need stack depth of 291,
** WARNING ** but DVI_STACK_DEPTH_MAX is 256.
** ERROR ** Capacity exceeded.

I have no clue as to what's causing this.  It happens with about 1 out
of 1000 source files I'm creating.  I'd be glad to get some help to
pinpoint this.

What stack is this DVI stack?

What may be causing it to become so deep? E. g. can I do something to my
latex-source, embedded images, fonts or whatever to make this go away?

I'm creating through an automated process and I'm afraid simply going to
the source and increasing the limit will only make this problem go away
for a little longer rather than forever.

I'd be grateful for any ideas.

Thanks in advance
----Daniel

It is easy to understand if you are familiar with DVI commands, push and pop.
The "push" command will save a few values related to the current status and
increase the "stack depth" value. On the other hand, the "pop" command will
restore the saved values, and decrease the "stack depth".

DVI_STACK_DEPTH_MAX says how many "push"es you can use.

I never see a valid TeX file causing the dvi stack problem. One exception is
when some style or class files may have a bug. If you send me sample ".xdv"
file, I can check what happened really. (It may be helpful if I have a source
TeX file too.)

If you are able to compile "xdvipdfmx" by yourself, it is very simple to adjust
the maximum value of DVI_STACK_DEPTH_MAX. Find the 70th line of the
"dvi.c", and change the value 256 to what you want.

Best regards, ChoF.

Hi Daniel,

It may not related to your problem, but cm-dvipdfm-fix.map
is obsolete for the new type1 cm fonts.
I think that TeX Live's dvipdfmx.cfg does not read cm-dvipdfm-fix.map.
Are you using old TL?

Best,
Akira

Well, I'm not.  ;-)

In fact I have no idea about the structure of DVI files at all, but I'm
willing to learn.

All right, so it's a stack for any sort of data.

There's a problem there, I'm afraid.  The failing xdv files all contain
some customer's personal data, so I cannot provide them, sorry.  I have
not been able to reproduce the problem in a simple test case, at least
not yet.  I hope that the help I'm getting from you and others leads me
closer to what's actually causing the problem.

Somebody else suggested the issue might be related to nested boxes.  As
I do have quite a lot of those, I'm hopeful that this might be the right
track.  What do you think?

Yes, I have successfully built texlive 2008 from sources yesterday
evening, but it's not quite behaving like the binary distribution yet.

I'll investigate and let you know if setting DVI_STACK_DEPTH_MAX to 4096
made the issue go away.  If it did not I think I can be sure there's a
problem with my LaTeX code.

Hi Taco.
I saw you closed bug on tracker. Yes, you are right, in SVN version
(lualatex --version: 20100217) this sample compiles fine.

Nevertheless this behavior (segfault) presents in default TL distro
(lualatex --version: 20091225) and in TL from my distro
(lualatex --version: 20100121).

Just for note.

Yes, I'm on TeX Live 2008.

I'm not using the cm fonts (well, at least I don't intend to), so I hope
the reason the map became obsolete doesn't apply to me.  Or does it?

As I suggested to you on the xetex list, I'm pretty sure this is the root of the problem.

A trivial testcase would be something like

  \global\setbox0=\hbox{x}
  \newcount\n
  \loop \ifnum\n < 250
    \global\setbox0=\hbox{\box0}
    \advance\n by 1
    \repeat
  \shipout\box0
  \end

which you can run with plain xetex. This works fine. But increase the loop limit to 260, and you'll get the DVI_STACK_DEPTH_MAX error.

Recompiling xdvipdfmx with a larger constant will defer the problem, but a nesting level of over 250 boxes is suggestive of a poorly-implemented page layout structure that could almost certainly be simplified/optimized.

(Note that if you do increase the driver stack to allow such complex pages, you could eventually hit a hard limit in the DVI format, and a problem in how TeX generates it. I think it's either 32K or 64K -- can't remember offhand if the relevant values are signed or unsigned 16-bit numbers. TeX itself doesn't detect the overflow, but the DVI output it creates will be incorrect.)

The date part of the version number is the build time which means
nothing more than when this binary were built, so unless you provide the
full version string, the above paragraph says almost nothing.

Yeah, I realised only a few minutes late that the XeTeX list would have
been more appropriate from the start.  Apologies.

Hang on, I think I misread your original comment.  Do you think the
problem arises from a nesting _depth_ of 256 boxes? Your previous
example, here it is:

I assumed that the boxes 1 through 4 were put into box 0, side by side,
so we'd end up with 4 boxes in one top-level box, with a nesting depth
of only 2.

> Recompiling xdvipdfmx with a larger constant will defer the problem, but a nesting level of over 250 boxes is suggestive of a poorly-implemented page layout structure that could almost certainly be simplified/optimized.

I definitely don't intend to have boxes nested as deep as 256 levels in
my documents, so the culprit really has to be in my LaTeX code.  (Coming
to think of it, more than 255 boxes inside one top-level box sounds
pretty insane, too.)


> (Note that if you do increase the driver stack to allow such complex pages, you could eventually hit a hard limit in the DVI format, and a problem in how TeX generates it. I think it's either 32K or 64K -- can't remember offhand if the relevant values are signed or unsigned 16-bit numbers. TeX itself doesn't detect the overflow, but the DVI output it creates will be incorrect.)

Of course there must be some limit.  I was hoping that it was just under
some crazy worst-case circumstance that I reached the 256-depth limit,
and would never even come close to, say, 512.  But if I really produced
some nesting that was that deep there definitely is an error that would
tear down any limit I could come up with.

So thanks again, now I know what I need to go hunting for.

Have fun

This is default output. If there were more verbose and version evident

If there was a sane way to get the gobal revision information from
subversion, I would use that in the banner. Unfortunately, subversion
is horribly lacking in that.

You should call "svn info", parse the output, find URL of the
repository, call "svn info $url" and parse its output. Of course, it
should be done AFTER commit. This will create some svn_info.h file
containing the definition of the banner.

Except that all of that processing has to be sort of optional because
the source tarballs are not based on a subversion tree, and in that case
(and only that case) there has to be a static svn_info.h file that is
created automatically during packaging.

After three tries at scripting something like this, I have discovered
that it sounds a whole lot easier than it actually is, and concluded
that subversion is simply unfriendly wrt build id numbering and gave up.

If you (or anyone else) can write me a script or executable that can do
all of this, that would be absolutely wonderful!


Best wishes,
Taco

I'd be interested too. Currently, TeXworks builds include the svn revision in their "About" info, but maintaining this is not fully automated and therefore it is not always up to date.

In TeX Live packages we use the highest number of all the 
last-change revisions of the included files. That works *very* nicely
(besides the fact that we sometimes delete files from a package, which
seems not to be important for you).

SO there we get a nice revision number which is ever increasing.
The whole online update mechanism is based on that, so don't tell
me it doesn't work ... ;-)))

I was actually inquiring about git and a similar approach, because
I wanted to see if we can swithc to git instead of svn. git is *much* *much*
more efficient, And we could pull from git repositories of luatex/xetex
(if they swithc) and others. But well, it turned out to be
not really easy ;-)

In which file is this scripted, so that I can look it up?

Basically it is Master/tlpkg/TLTREE.pm which is used in
Master/tlpkg/TLPOBJ.pm, sub recompute_revision.

But it is all perl code, not shell or so.

The idea is simply to read the output of 
	svn status -v
and collect for each file the revison number it was last changed,
then maximize of these values.

Ok, thanks. I'll look this up and see if I can adapt it to luatex.

Well, this IS a FAQ:

svnversion certainly is a way.

I don't know how you build the source tarballs, but maybe you can arrange for a
file like SVN_REV containing the output of svnversion to be created just before
the tarball is built? Then at build time, test for the existence of this file,
read the svn rev from it if it exists or try svnversion or default to "unknown"
(or whatever string) if both fail.

(This won't help people like me who enjoy tracking the source using git-svn, but
anyway...)

Just my 2 cents.

Manuel.

Hi

I've just updated TeXLive and memoir package, among other packages, and noticed a strange space that appears when a footnote command is placed immediately before a period. Here's an example code:

\documentclass{memoir}

\begin{document}
Test\footnote{test}. Test
\end{document}

The space appears just before the period. I used pdflatex to compile the code, but get same result with latex and xelatex. Can anyone confirm this?

Hello Dan,

In the first message of this thread, I wrote:

Running "tex sizetestplain.tex" produces sizetestplain.dvi with A4
size, with the following input in sizetestplain.tex:
\hsize=100mm
\vsize=150mm
Hello.
\bye

(end of quote)

I wasn't thinking about the difference between paper size and
the size of what David Fuchs called a "page" in his DVI format
description reproduced in TugBoat Vol. 3 (1982), Nr. 2, pp. 14-19.

Thanks for making me aware of that.  So, my statement about
"A4 size" above doesn't make sense.  Rereading the TugBoat
article, I also notice that the vertical size given in the
DVI file isn't just height, but height plus depth.

Good to know that.

Ok, so my DVI files have a depth of 24pt.  I noticed that saying
\nopagenumbers doesn't change that.  However, finding out how
isn't important right now, as I'm not trying to solve a problem.
I'm only trying to understand what's happening.

Thanks again for helping with that.

Presumably the other three occurances of \Printmoves should
also be changed (lines 1724, 1733 and 1743).

Subject: [tex-live] Luatex formats and hyphenation patterns
Message-ID: <20100222213215.GA15069@khaled-laptop>

Currently luatex format, like other etex engines, loads all hyphenation
patterns in the format.

However, this is unnecessary for luatex which can happily load
hyphenation patterns on the fly, it is even discouraged per luatex
manual. The result of this is noticeable slow down in luatex startup
(about 3 seconds on my system).

In my naive attempt to fix this, I made a copy of etex.src with the name
luatex.src, patched it to only load hyphenation patterns when requested
(i.e. in \uselanguage instead of \addlanguage) and changed luatex.ini
accordingly.

Attached the modified files, and a diff for quick review.

This seems to work as expected, but I don't think this is the right
approach since the patterns are reloaded every time the language is
requested instead if only once the first time it is called. And latex
format needs to be fixed too.

Regards,
 Khaled

i was thinking in the context of babel (which definitely has to be
fixed).  my scheme would patch the \selectlanguage (and similar) calls:
if the language being asked for had not been loaded, then load it at
that time.  (babel throws an error if the language hasn't been loaded,
just now.)

this general mechanism can surely be extended, making a straightforward
addition to any package that needs to select languages.

    In my naive attempt to fix this, I made a copy of etex.src with the name
    luatex.src, 

Aside from anything else, it's certainly inadvisable to duplicate the
entire file.  Instead, a conditional should be used that we can
set/unset in the different formats.  I realize you were just doing the
expedient thing for an experiment, but if we want to ship a change like
this, it should be done in a clean way.

    approach since the patterns are reloaded every time the language is
    requested instead if only once the first time it is called. 

Indeed.  If you, or someone, can do that, we can consider adopting the
change for plain luatex.
    
    And latex format needs to be fixed too.
     
An entirely different matter.  Don't hold your breath.

Hi,

I've download a new version package pgfplots 1.3 from CTAN, but I
don't know how to update my existing old version of the package.  My
system is texlive 2009 Windows.  In the 'update' tab of the tlmgr user
interface, only a 'texlive infra' appears in the package list.

The 1.3 version of pgfplots on my hand is an zip file, it was got from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/pgfplots.html#Download.

Thanks.

One method:

(1) Find the location of TEXMFLOCAL by
    kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL
(2) Copy doc, scripts, source and tex directories
    into $TEXMFLOCAL
(3) Run texhash

Best,
Akira

First update *only* the infra structure stuff (texlive.infra) and
after that you will probably see many more updates, including the 
one for pgfplots.

My bad, Akira is of course right, that sounds like a more reasonable 
explanation.

Hello,

thank you Khaled for talking care of this issue! Here is a new
attempt, taking into account Karl's remarks... the changes are now
integrated into etex.src, the patterns are loaded only once, I added a
log message and I also changed \fmtversion not to have the languages
in it (in order for it to be coherent during all the compilation)...
but I'm not 100% sure it's a good idea, especially since I'm not
familiar with Plain logs. Wdyt?

Thank you,
-- 
Elie

That's the third time in a few days I've seen this, hopefully it'll get fixed very soon

Subject: [tex-live] "I can't find the format file" problems
Message-ID: <4B83BC66.70100@jacob-head.com>

Dear everyone,

I am a user on a public NetBSD alpha system where the administrator has 
just installed a TeX Distribution. I believe it is tex-live 2009 based 
on the files it generates in my $HOME.

The difficulty I have is that attempting to run TeX generates the following:

$ tex test.tex
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (Web2C 2009)

kpathsea: Running mktexfmt tex.fmt
I can't find the format file `tex.fmt'!

I get a similar message when trying to run xetex on the same file (which 
simply says "Hello, World! \bye").

Running luatex produced more output on the screen. The full file should 
be attached and is available at 
<http://www.jacob-head.com/temp/luatex.txt>. I believe that LuaTeX is 
attempting to generate the relevant fmt file before failing with:

(/usr/pkg/share/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex
! Conflicting pattern ignored.
l.4453 }

?
! Emergency stop.
l.4453 }

!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
Transcript written on luatex.log.
Error: `luatex -ini  -jobname=luatex -progname=luatex luatex.ini' failed

Running fmtutil --all or fmtutil --missing produces similar error 
messages (also attached and at 
<http://www.jacob-head.com/temp/fmtutil.txt>). Running fmtutil --byfmt 
tex (in an effort to avoid the luatex problems) produces no output.

For what it's worth, I also copied over a working xetex.fmt file and 
placed it in the revelant local directory. XeTeX then fails with:

(./test.tex [1]xdvipdfmx: not found
  )
Error 32512 (driver return code) generating output;
file test.pdf may not be valid.

I appreciate that this may be a different problem.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could proceed from here?

Many thanks,

Best wishes,

Jacob

Notice how packages 42, 46, and 47 fail in a different way than for

following output:

Notice that the three packages biblatex-nature, braket, and breakcites

Although it might look strange, this is the intended behaviour. These
packages failed during auto-install, which will be treated the same as
if they were forcibly removed. The same happens if you add
--no-auto-install switch, see:

  tlmgr --help update

This is a limitation of the current package management system.
Forcibly removed packages are not tracked in the local database and
are found from the difference between the local and remote databases.

To avoid any forcibly removed packages, use:

  tlmgr update --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed

Cheers,

Tomek

What happened to the six other packages that failed download but didn't 
get marked as forcibly removed (see my previously quoted tlmgr output)?

The output line(s): "Restoring old package state succeeded" should
give you a hint. They were reverted back to the previous version from
the auto-backup copy that is created as a part of the update process.

So the ones marked as forcibly removed are packages that were not 
previously installed and therefore could not be restored?

AFPL says: The software may not be sold, including any fees involved
with distribution. It seems to me that the font names and id's have
not been changed so far.

Yes, I contacted Gael Varoquaux and he told me:

Doesn't sound promising.

The changes to suggest (/UniqueID etc.) are trivial with FontForge.
Surely that's not the problem?

It can even be done with T1utils and any text editor (or any scripting
language) but I will not do it for non-free fonts. And I do not know
how to select good UniqeID's.

  Reportedly there also are issues with the license, see the original thread.

> Surely that's not the problem?

  The problem is that the author, by his own admission, wrote those files for a
friend and never had the intention of distributing it anywhere.  Plus, he's
obviously uncomfortable with the idea of devising a package for TeX Live.  It
feels to me like the people wanting to have it included in TeX Live should ask
for his permission and take things over.

Hi

I'm running the latest version of TexLive 2009,

$ sudo tlmgr update --self
Password:
tlmgr: package repository
http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr: no updates for tlmgr present.
tlmgr: no updates available
$ sudo tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: package repository
http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
tlmgr: no updates available$

but when I try to see the help for tlmgr I get the following:

$ tlmgr --help
"/var/folders/Hc/Hc53KnQCGN8u9bLoMHnEqE+++TI/-Tmp-/wE5eXiJKEj" may be
a binary file.  See it anyway?
$

then get a man page with loads of control characters. Is anyone else
seeing this?

This is on Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

Cheers

Adam

It was installed using a 2009 pretest version and then kept upto date
using tlmgr, I don't have an /Applications/TeX directory.

If you don't have or don't want to use TeX Live Utility, it just uses the
disaster recovery script discussed here:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html

You can download 
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh and run
it to get tlmgr in a known good state.

Subject: [tex-live] Stable vs. Unstable/Testing Update Repositories?
Message-ID: <30336.1266957827@vosill.math.hmc.edu>


I'm wondering if there could be more than one update path, with
(at least) one kept fairly stable (with tested, known-working
packages, scripts, and documentation) and one that is updated with
the very latest and greatest from CTAN.  It might even be worth
having a very stable (bugfixes-only) branch, a known-working
branch with the newest safe code, and a cutting-edge,
latest-and-greatest branch.

I have a colleague who naively updated his TeX Live 2009 install,
which happily updated him to the beta version of geometry.sty,
which broke beamer, which he needed to compile his slides for
teaching later that day.

Most of these problems get sorted out fairly quickly, and most of
them can be worked around or temporarily fixed by a skilled user,
but for faculty on a deadline, they can be serious problems.

As I have a department full of faculty who might easily get
themselves into trouble on their laptops, I'm a bit less
enthusiastic about rolling out TL 2009 than I might otherwise be.
I'm not ready to flip the desktop machines over to TL 2009 for the
same reasons.

No wonder, the package was never included in TeXLive.  The fonts are
included, though, and the file antiqua.sty only contains trivial code:

\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{antiqua}
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{uaq}
\endinput

Is there a reason not to include this?  It appears to me as if TeXLive
contains the contents of CTAN://fonts/urw/antiqua/uaq.zip, not of
CTAN://fonts/psfonts/urwvf/*.

I have looked at the licenses. URW Garamond is issued under AFPL. I am
afraid that the modified version must be issued by the same license.
IMHO you first have to persuade URW to change the license and then the
derived work could have free license.

* \patterns (and \hyphenation) are *global* assignments,
  therefore \gdef should be used to define "\plded@#1".

* Loading at runtime means, the catcodes are not known any longer.
  Before loading a file, the correct catcodes must be set
  and restored after loading. If there is a resource managment
  for catcode tables, then a catcode table can be used for
  this purpose.

LuaTeX also provides library `lang'. If I remember Taco correctly,
the patterns as plain Lua string are faster than \patterns.
Loading the patterns via Lua also solves the catcode problem.
Probably it is not to difficult for the hyph-utf8 project
to provide lua pattern input files that are generated automatically
from the project data?

A strict name convention can help to detect whether the 
patterns for a language is available as Lua code and/or TeX code.

And not to forget: hyphenation depends on the font encoding ...

Unhappily I don't have time in the next weeks for implementing
and experimenting.

You should preferably ask the author of geometry.sty not to put beta
versions to CTAN. The TeX Live team is not large enough to test all
updated packages for possible problems.

Although I am a skilled user, I never update during a work on o
project unless a critical security update is available. I sometimes
delay updates even several months, sometimes even a year just to be
sure that everything will continue to work the same way. And you can
use tlmgr to make backup.

actually I don't think it was any fault of the geometry author

it was the beamer people who was relying on internal features in 
geometry, i.e. relying on \... at ... commands instead of official macros 
stated in the manual, that is just asking for trouble.

geometry 5 had been beta tested, but apparently the beamer people did 
not remember their test

Hi Claire,

1) People on deadlines shouldn't update.  The only combination of
   packages that is or can be tested is the one that ships as the yearly
   release.  Personally, I keep an installation of that on my machine,
   and never update it.

2) There is no feasible way for anyone involved (authors, CTAN, TL) to
   know what a given update breaks and what doesn't.  So there's no
   feasible way to have branches (in addition, it would be a huge amount
   of work and a huge additional complication).

3) I don't know what the problem is with the new beamer not making it to
   mirrors, or if that's really what's happening.  The new package was
   posted in the tlnet repository on Feb 19 (file size of
   beamer.tar.xz=94756).  I haven't checked the mirrors to see which
   don't have it.  In any event, I will attach the new file to this
   file.  It differs only in comments from the patch that was posted
   (thanks, Vladimir and Ulrike).  At least I hope so.

Best,
Karl

That looks like a message from less, which is perhaps your default

your LESS environment variable to "-f".  (I.e., less -f says to not
bother checking for supposedly-binary-files.)  Or setting PAGER to
some other program that is smarter about what is and isn't binary.

Well, making them available is some kind of distribution, isn't it?

Sorry, I didn't cite the whole response.  He also said:

But there are still a few other problems:

 * If someone is willing to take over maintenance, I assume that he
   needs the fontinst sources.  Ga?l improved kerning pairs.  This
   affects the metric files, not the fonts themselves.  It's better to
   have the sources instead of reverse-engineer things.

 * The glyph outlines should be revised because there are some
   glitches which might be visible.

I think that anybody who wants to take over maintenance has to contact
Ga?l anyway.  And he has to be familiar with a font editor (fontforge,
for instance) and with fontinst.

I didn't reverse-engineer the tfm files.  Ga?l replaced the original
glyph "Q" by something where the stroke at the bottom is much longer.
It looks very nice if a "Q" is followed by a "u", but it looks very
strange in abbreviations like "FAQ".  I assume that it's possible to
convince fontinst to treat "Qu" as a ligature.

Furthermore, I think that if someone is very familiar with fontinst,
much more can be done.  The new OsF are still mono-spaced.  This looks
ugly in continuous text but is required for tables.  I think that it's
quite useful to have some virtual fonts with different metrics and
some TeX macros which allow to switch between them.  But as I said
before, thorough knowledge of fontinst is required.

If someone is brave enough to proceed, I don't want to stop him.  But
I'm sure that all this is non-trivial.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Are you running MacPorts?  If so, do you have /opt/local/bin/nroff
(provided by the groff package)?  If I remove the MacPorts groff
package, ``tlmgr help'' works as expected.

(Now to reinstall all the broken Perl modules.)

Thanks Claire, the MacPorts nroff was the source of the problem.

Hi Jacob,

    I am a user on a public NetBSD alpha system where the administrator has 

Thanks for the detailed report.  Unfortunately, I'm sorry, but you need
to find whoever is responsible for this netbsd port.  This area of .fmt
file creation is precisely one of those which varies most widely among
different versions of TeX (Live), and I can't guess as to wehere the
problem really lies.

I can only offer the generic advice to check your
environment variables, and unset anything TeX related.  It's easy for
old settings to cause failures.

If you just want to make a .fmt so you can actually use (la)tex, as
opposed to debugging these failures, running
tex -ini tex.ini
should create a tex.fmt, which you could then move to wherever it will
be found (I wouldn't want to guess, for your system).

In general, fmtutil.cnf gives the commands to create any given .fmt.

    (./test.tex [1]xdvipdfmx: not found

xdvipdfmx is an integral part of XeTeX, not an independent part of the
flow (as dvipdfmx is).  So if it's not in PATH, xetex has no chance of
working.

Hope this helps somehow,
Karl

Some funny 8bit input encoding is copied 1:1 to Unicode,
then LuaTeX doesn't know the characters. And at the font
level using tfm/vf reading LuaTeX also does not know
the real characters. Then the same text can be represented
in different ways.

However I agree with you, if the input is already Unicode
or is translated to Unicode.

That error makes it seem that \Geom at rmargin (which is the supposed
replacement for \Gm at rmargin) is undefined.  Indeed, I see no \Geom in
the new geometry.sty.  So I don't think the problem is that the mirrors
aren't updating (which didn't make sense anyway), but rather that the

Can you (or anyone) please post an actual example of a document that
fails?  I could not reproduce the problem with a minimal beamer test

"KB" == Karl Berry <karl at freefriends.org>

    KB> 1) People on deadlines shouldn't update.  

Of course not, but updating is a great way to procrastinate, plus
it gives you the warm glow of having all the latest and greatest
features.  Saying that people should use common sense doesn't
really help us, as all humans do dumb things sometimes, especially
when it's made easy for us.

    KB> I keep an installation of that on my machine, and never
    KB> update it.

That's a reasonable policy, but it's not the policy that's
suggested by the easy access to the updating features (which are
also used for installing additional packages) in the current TeX
Live.  If updating is something that only the most hardcore,
living-on-the-edge folks should be doing, it should be hard(er) to
do.

With TeX Live 2008, there was no updater, so I installed the
current MacTeX on our Macs or the current TeX Live 2008 on the
servers.  If there was a major update (to MacTeX), I'd install
that on my machine and use it for a while before I'd consider
installing it anywhere else.

Near the end of 2009, tlmgr came out for TL 2008, and I installed
it and used it on my machine.  There weren't many updates, and I
(possibly wrongly) assumed that the updates were ``safe'' and
``recommended''.

But TeX Live 2009 includes tlmgr as part of the base distribution,
and talks about it in the docs as if it's something ordinary
people should use.  MacTeX 2009 goes further by installing TeX
Live Utility.app right next to TeXShop.app along with a nice
document telling them how to use it.  Curious users are going to
try that app out to see what it does.

The same argument could be made about any of the Linux
distributions, which have thousands of potentially interacting
packages from hundreds of upstream developers.  Yet they manage by
implementing some system to handle the testing stage -- Debian has
sid (unstable) and testing in addition to the stable release;
Fedora has its releases as well as rawhide for development (and is
moving towards having a separate prerelease testing repository,
too).  Even better -- these distros typically have stable releases
that only get security updates or occasional feature updates.

The same options could be used for TeX Live.  There could be a
time-based progression, where new packages come in from CTAN and
are added to a bleeding-edge TL repo for people to play with, and
after some amount of time, those packages would qualify to be
moved into the main TL repo that's considered safe to update from.
New versions of a package reset the clock.  Adding some active
testing would make that system even safer, of course, but would
make things more complex.

An even easier (and arguably better) option is to simply have a
stable release repository, that only gets bugfixes or well-tested
feature changes, and a second development repository where the
newest stuff comes directly in from CTAN, and publicize the stable
repositories.  An added advantage here is that you can continue to
maintain that release for as long as you want, and even keep it
around for people who aren't ready to update to the next year's
release.

The beamer issue is just an example of the problems that can
happen when you're dumping brand-new untested code into a update
stream that's easily accessed by naive users.

I'm happy with the policy being ``updating is for elite TeX
hackers only; ordinary users should install the released version
and never update until next year's release'', but it would be nice
if the tools to subvert that policy weren't prominently included
with the distributions and used to provide other attractive
functionality.

I'd be even happier if there was a stable repository for each TL
release that only had bugfixes added to it and could be used by
ordinary users without fear of breaking their systems.

TeX Live: probably 4 who do that core stuff?

Can you send over some people working for us, please?
Can you employ some people for us that work full time on TL, please?

Please see the reality. It is ATM Karl, Tomek, Manuel and me doing 
most stuff, with say different areas of responsabilities.

Please go ahead and program something similar. Our scripts are
all free and open and the source is on the web/svn.

But keep in mind that we want to keep only one svn repository
without branches etc, the whole bunch is already big enough.

Then they should make a backup, not update in critical situations,
etc.

Reality is different. 

tlmgr/infra structure is practically a one-man-show, package updates
are done by one only.

We don't have any test cases, we don't have the man power, 
suggestions there are many, helping hands a few!

Yes, that is a bug. The reason is as already mentioned that tlmgr
deduces the information which pacages are new (auto-install) from the
contents and revisions of the collections.

Currently the sequence of events is:
- remove old packages
- update normal packages
- update collections and schemes
- install new packages etc

Now since the update of collections is pushed behind the normal update
a failure there works out nicely.

But when an auto-install of a new package fails the new collection is
already installed and on the next run it is considered forcibly removed.

Please use the way described in the thread to get these packages.

We will work on getting this behaviour fixed.

Best wishes

Hi Frank,

    Is there a reason not to include this?  It appears to me as if TeXLive
    contains the contents of CTAN://fonts/urw/antiqua/uaq.zip, 

Plus the contents of urw/antiqua, it looks like.  More or less.  Sort of.

    not of CTAN://fonts/psfonts/urwvf/*. 

Well, in theory we could install urwvf easily enough.  But as always
with these old font sets, things don't look simple.

They look like two different but overlapping sets of files to me.  Both
uaq.zip and urwvf include many of the same tfm's and other stuff.  I
didn't check if they are really the same.  Furthermore, urwvf
conglomerates antiqua and grotesk.  (I wonder if anyone actually uses
these two little fonts or if this is all just theory ...)

If the metrics are really the same, I guess I could go forward.
Otherwise, it looks to me like the cleanest way would be to prepare one
set of files, say "urwextra", which combines urwvf, antiqua, and
grotesk.  

Anyone happen to know if ToMasz Wierzbicki (urwvf author) is still
active?

Oh yeah, everything was absolutetely stable and well tested in the
good old days when there was no tlmgr which now breaks everything.

Pure nonsense.  TeX Live ...., 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 were snapshots
of what was on CTAN at the time TeX Live was released.  Nothing was
tested at all.  And if something didn't work you had to wait for next
year's release.

Now we have tlmgr.  All it does is to provide a snapshot of what is
currently on CTAN.  It's possible that a particular update breaks your
system, but if a problem occurs, all you have to do is to report the
problem and run tlmgr again a few days later.  In the "good old days"
you had to wait for a new TeX Live release.  Everything is better than
in the past.  Definitely.

I agree with you that something well tested like "Debian stable" is
useful somehow.  I really don't want to prevent you from maintaining
something like this.  But please keep in mind that TeX Live now
consists of more than 91,000 files and this number is rapidly growing.
If you think that it's sensible to provide a repository where all these
files are well tested, please go ahead.

I personally think that tlmgr is a great thing.  If you are missing
the "good old days", there is a simple workaround: Don't use tlmgr
and wait for TeX Live 2010 if you encounter a problem.  It might be
fixed then or not.  If you don't use tlmgr, everything behaves exactly
as in the "good old days".

I'm not sure I understand you correctly.  Do you think it's sufficient
if the TeX Live installer provides a [back-to-the-stoneage] button or
do you prefer a solution ? la Khmer Rouge?

You can't please everyone, eh, TeXLive people? For years everyone was complaining ``Why can't we have an easy to use system as MiKTeX to have the latest updates?'' And now that we have it, then ``Why do you make it so damn easy to upgrade?''

Sorry, Claire, but what you're saying is that it isn't common sense to ask people to use common sense.

When in a deadline, I use a combination of Zdenek's and Karl's advices ---I want to have the leading-edge packages as your faculty members do, but before every update I tar my working distribution (I still have my 2008_backup_2009-09-11.tar, done before installing TeXLive 2009) ---it only takes about 2 minutes in my MacBook.

Best,

Axel

Wrong! As turned out, the geometry package was tested and bug free. It
just turned on the beamer bug that was there unnoticed for a long
time. Package developer guide says that authors should never rely on
undocumented internal macros of other packages but beamer relied on
it. What you ask is to find all packages that rely on undocumented
internal macros and put them to the unstable branch. It won't be easy
to find such packages. And quite a lot of packages may end up in the
unstable branch although they work.

I disagree with your assessment here. Even well tested updates can
sometimes break your system.  When being on a tight deadline I usually
don't update anything, including the OS. The rule "if it ain't broken
..." applies is such situations.

The update system is not intended for hardcore types only. Although
updates can occasionally result in breakage, most problems are
addressed within days and hot fixes for the critical ones are often
available within hours. I think this is quite a reasonable and
workable time frame in most cases. People requiring a stable system at
all times should update rarely or make regular backups.

What we could do to improve the situation somewhat is to set the
autobackup option in tlmgr as default.

While I agree with what you propose in general, our resources are
already spread quite thin. Besides the lack of man-power and technical
hurdles there are also hosting problems -- TL is quite big and that
alone can preclude maintenance of multiple concurrent repositories.
That being said I will discuss with the rest of the team some ideas
and see if there is anything that we could do (but don't hold your
breath).

Cheers,

Tomek

There are many people actively using and updating TL, so updates do get
tested -- likely more thoroughly than the pre-release versions as more users
are involved.  Case in point: the problems with beamer were found and a fix
is available.

The issue is not so much with testing as it is with the unavoidable delays
between when an update breaks something and the wide availability of a
fixed version.

People with deadlines need to figure out a way to have a "stable"
configuration, but they also have a responsibility to check for
problems using a "current" version so they can update the "stable"
version when the schedule allows.

The best way to detect conflicts is to have lots of people using the
software (and reporting the problems sensibly rather than telling all
their friends "TL doesn't work"!).

There will always be problems like this, and as authors retire or are
forced onto MS Office workflows the problems of orphan packages
will grow.  Still we are better off with TeX than the people who
relied heavily on Wordstar, Nota Bene, Macsyma or any others in a
the long list of defunct commercial packages.

Many large organizations force-feed security updates -- breaking some
end-user app is seen as less risky than leaving systems vunerable to
crackers.  These "large-organizations" are also concerned with security
of  home systems of their workers -- if you work for a large organization
there are people who want to know everything about you, including what
is on your home computer.

TL is not big by today's standards.   A snapshot of the TL archive
directory can easily be stored on a PC too old to handle Windows
XP.

you contrast the public and the private space.

buying a new computer for my wife, recently, i found that a 1.5tbyte
main disc on the machine was acceptably priced.  if she was into tex,
two complete copies of tl would hardly be noticed.

by contrast, ctan is

17032580        .../ctan/tex-archive

on this central site, and for sure

2806448 .../ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive

is a noticeable chunk of the whole

as galbraith didn't quite say: private affluence, public poverty.

This tends to prove one thing: using tlmgr's autobackup option is most probably
the way to go. That way, space is used on the big unexpensive hard drive of the
user, while precious space/bandwidth of CTAN mirrors are saved.

The problem with this solution is, you still need to educate users so that they
activated this option and know how to use the backups. And educating users is
the most difficult task in system administration :-)

Claire, I understand your request and I think it's reasonable (that's the main
reason why I love Debian : unstable/testing/stable). People have already
explained why it wouldn't be easy to do this (though I have a few ideas on this
point, but we'll discuss them internally) but I'd like to add another argument.
You'd still have to educate users not to use the unstable repo. Or we could make
"stable" the default, but then we'd have fewer testers on unstable, so bugs
would be more likely to go unnoticed to stable.

So, I agree that the solution probably lies on the user's side, either:
- not updating at all
- or updating only specific packages when they know they need newer versions (eg
for pstricks or other regularly-enhanced packages)
- or using the autobackup option of tlmgr to be able to unwind the problematic
updates when they happen
- or using more elaborated solutions like having two distros on their hard
drive, or manually backing up their entire distro before upgrading, etc.

Manuel.

Many thanks. The pkgsrc website seems to be down at the moment but once 
it is back up I will see if I can track down the package maintainer 
(assuming that's what they are called in the NetBSD world) and go from 
there.

Yes, of course. I tried that before posting and it seemed not to make a 
difference.

That's very helpful. Running that and installing the resulting file at 
~/.texlive2009/texmf-var/web2c/tex/ allows TeX to function again. 
Running luatex -ini luatex.ini (which I assume would be the equivilant 
command for producing the luatex.fmt file) breaks with the same error 
that fmtutil did:

(/usr/pkg/share/texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex
! Conflicting pattern ignored.
l.4453 }

though forcing it to continue does produce a fmt file which, when 
installed appears to allows luatex to function (albeit with further 
warnings on conflicting patterns whenever it is invoked).

XeTeX simply breaks horriby:

(/usr/pkg/share/texmf-dist/tex/plain/config/xetex.ini
! I can't find file `unicode-letters'.
l.12 \input unicode-letters

Thanks for that. I wonder if this, and the error above, suggests a 
broken installation of XeTeX.

It does indeed, so thank you. I think I now have a clearer idea of the 
people and questions I should be asking.

I am a bit uneasy with statements "people on deadlines should not
update". There are some people who rely upon some big server
administrated by sysadmin and at any given moment someone is on
deadline. This is exactly the reason why system administrators in our
dept maintain teTeX and allowed me to maintain TL. At least they know
that they "did not changed nothing" when one of my esteemed colleagues
screaming bloody murder requires explanations why some file which
worked for the last 200 years stopped working (in 99.999% cases they
made "minor" changes). So sysadmins want some assurance.

May be limited rollback feature would be helpful? For example keep
previous versions of some major packages?

We already have a testing repository of sorts (tlcritical) but it is
limited to infrastructure updates only. If it would be a complete
repository then perhaps more users would be inclined to use it. But
let's discuss it internally first.

There is a difference between public repository run by volunteers and
professional enterprise sysadmin. Some time ago I developed LaTeX
package for a bank and it had to be verified by their sysadmin. The
employees can only use verified software. Thus they can use MiKTeX,
because it is verified by their sysadmin, but not TeX Live. Any
organization could block CTAN in the firewall, the sysadmin will make
a mirror of TL and if the sysadmin considers it stable, the local
mirror will be made available to employees.

Yes, and you can even specify how many backups you want to keep...

As with today's update the file comma.sty is included twice. In package
'carlisle' and in the new package 'comma'. Maybe the purpose was to
relocate the file from 'carlisle' into a stand-alone package.

no more than finger trouble, i expect.

my procedure in making these separate bundles on ctan has been

1. acquire docs (mostly written by philipp stephani, but some by me)
2. install docs together with original package as a new bundle
3. update the catalogue repository
4. delete original package.


i have always left at least 24 hours between (3) and (4), so that non-tl
users of ctan don't suddenly find that a package they've been
recommended has summarily disappeared.  after 24 hours, the indexes and
the web copies of the catalogue files will have been rewritten.

this procedure is of course prone to the problem you've observed.

it will no doubt be sorted out rsn.  the two files are identical, so it
doesn't matter which your document uses.

Here is another attempt:

"RF" == Robin Fairbairns <Robin.Fairbairns at cl.cam.ac.uk>

    RF> by contrast, ctan is

    RF> 17032580 .../ctan/tex-archive

Exactly, 17 GB for all of CTAN, which we mirror locally (on a
public mirror).  Compare with 885 GB for Fedora (who are asking
for 1.2 TB in the near future); 267 GB for Debian; 89 GB for
CentOS; 320 GB for Ubuntu.

TeX Live is only 2.8 GB.  Compare that with some big commercial
software packages for which I maintain local mirrors:

   4.5G  wolfram/mathematica/7.0.1
   5.8G  matlab/upstream/R2009b
   1.4G  maple/sw/13

A local install of the latest MATLAB on a Mac (with both 32- and
64-bit packages) is 2.8 GB; TeX Live (from MacTeX) with all its
myriad packages and binaries is still slightly smaller.

Space can be saved on the mirrors through hardlinking --
packages that don't change can be linked; those that do are
replaced by new versions, which will still be a fraction of the
size of the whole.

Maintaining multiple releases is very doable, it just requires
someone to decide to do it.  And, yes, obviously, I can do it
myself.  I can maintain my own local mirror, point all my machines
at it, and only migrate packages there after I've looked at the
changes, maybe done some amount of testing and think they're safe.
Similarly, on the server side I can juggle links to maintain
multiple copies of our TeX Live install.

But having that process handled upstream would make those benefits
available to everyone, and having it handled by the system's
developers will mean that problems, when found, can be addressed
quickly and competently.

We're currently discussing the options internally for maintaining multiple
releases without doubling or so the space occupied by TeX Live on CTAN mirrors.
One of the options discussed is using links (though we were thinking symlinks
rather than hardlinks), if the CTAN admins think it can properly work with all
mirrors.

If you have personal experiences or useful references you'd like to share with
us, you're welcome.

Manuel.

Thanks for the explanation. If I knew about this procedure before I
would not have been so hasty.

    As with today's update the file comma.sty is included twice. In package
    'carlisle' and in the new package 'comma'. Maybe the purpose was to
    relocate the file from 'carlisle' into a stand-alone package.

I deleted the extra comma.sty yesterday and the update should be making
its way around as usual.

"MP" == Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard <mpg at elzevir.fr>

There are a few key advantages of hard links over symlinks for
mirroring.

First, hard links use minimal space on the filesystem -- a symbolic
link is an actual file on the filesystem that takes up some amount
of space and contains a pointer to another file.  Hard Links are
notations in the directory that one file *is* another file (they
use the same inode).*  Rsync (with the -H flag) takes advantage of
the inodes being the same to make copying hard links quicker.

Second, rsync (with the -H flag) will transparently replace a link
with a new file if one of the files that was a link is changed on
the upstream copy.

Third, even without rsync's -H option or local filesystem support
for hard links, you can still copy the whole tree as separate
files (it will just take longer or take up more space on the local
disk).

For comparison, here are some numbers from making copies of my
Linux (x86_64 and i386) install of TeX Live 2009:

  Original tree       2459.25 MiB
  Symlinked tree       637.35 MiB
  Hardlinked tree       53.37 MiB


There are tools for creating hardlinked trees quickly -- ``cp -al
tree1 tree2'' (with a GNU cp) will create a copy of directory
tree1 as tree2 with the directory structure intact, but the files
replaced with hard links.  I use this method to duplicate some
large software packages before updating them; for example, when
updating some toolboxes within a MATLAB install, I might duplicate
the existing install with hard links, then do the updates on the
duplicate tree.  When I'm happy with the new version, I can delete
the old version, and I'm left with a working tree.  Even better, I
can have multiple versions on the server at the same time, but use
way less space than completely separate installs would use (which
is very helpful when you have different licenses for the same
application that support different subsets of functionality).

Hardlinkpy, hardlink++, and similar tools will recursively scan a
directory for files that can be hardlinked.  It's common to run
these tools occasionally on mirrored data in case the upstream
mirror broke the links or never made them in the first place, but
the bandwidth savings only come if upstream uses hard links.[*]

   Claire

[*] Sadly, hardlinkpy can only find 190 MiB of potential savings
    in the CTAN mirror, but it would obviously help with multiple
    TeX Live trees.

There is one advantage you didn't mention:  If you remove the file,
you end up with a dangling symlink.  If you are using hardlinks, you
can remove as many directory entries as you want.  The file is deleted
when no directory entry points to the file/inode anymore.

I also think that hard links are advantageous.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <eba574421002250340i4b246d0ak25967f8ce9068d19@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

in the recent development of luaotfload
(http://github.com/mpg/luaotfload), we came up with a script,
luaotfload-fonts.lua
(http://github.com/mpg/luaotfload/blob/master/luaotfload-fonts.lua)
that build a font database by parsing the output of fc-list (or
parsing the directories of OSFONTDIR) and exploring the directories in
OPENTYPEFONTS (both in texmf.cnf), and writing a file otfl-fonts.lua
in TEXMFVAR/tex. This file is used in order to be able to call a font
by its name, like XeTeX does.

I'm thinking now about making writing a wrapper for it look more like
another TeXLive script, the thing is I'm not really aware of all the
techniques TeX Live has to use in order to execute scripts on all
platforms, and thus I don't really know how to build it... can someone
explain me how to build such a script (restrictions on languages,
modules to use, etc.)?

Also, currently the script writes in the user's TEXMFVAR, it is a good
idea to make a -sys version of the wrapper that would write in the
system's TEXMFVAR, or is a --sys switch better?

Does it seem reasonable to call fc-cache at the beginning of the
script? Is the name updatefontdb(-sys) OK for it (knowing that it's
LuaTeX-only)?

Thank you,

and it isn't now.

there are lots of these (i listed 23 in a reply to someone else about
something else, this morning).

a small group (philipp stephani doing most of the work, and me[*]) have
been generating documentation for packages.  people have been
complaining about the lack of some documentation, but i guess it's only
to be expected that they would also complain about the side-effectss of
generating it.

it's likely to take a *very* long time to document all the packages that
need it.  (i've been working on cataloguing everything for nearly two
years, and though i'm near to absolute stasis, there are still a few i
more or less understand that don't yet appear in the catalogue.
documentation requires more effort than cataloguing...)

documentation generation is unlikely to cover anything but latex
packages (though philipp has done one latex 2.09 package), but there are
an awful lot, and while most aren't as obscure as the typical
undocumented plain tex package[**], a lot are going to take quite a bit
of work.

On Windows only Perl and Lua are available out of the box. Our tlperl
comes with a bunch of standard modules, Lua is rather bare-bones but
it has direct access to kpathsea library. In both cases language
primitives should be sufficient for simple parsing.

Single common script is better. For Unix acting on argv[0] is standard
and allows the -sys version to be a symlink. For Windows I need --sys
switch for our universal wrapper, because I can't alter argv[0] for
scripts (well, for Lua script I could, but switch will be less hackish
:).

No strong opinion on this but I would rather go for a more LuaTeX-specific name.

This (bringing some order and splitting artificial "superpackages"
into real ones)  is a very welcome development and confusion seems to
be the only side effect.

Thank you for hard work - and clarification.

Hello Tomek,

thank you for your answer!

I have another technical question : how is the wrapper working exactly? 
 From the script developer point of view is it just something that will 
call lua on the good script (which means we don't have to rename it) 
with the same options it was passed (plus eventually a --sys if the -sys 
variant was called)? Also, our script works under texlua (it calls 
fontloader), is it a problem?

What about updluatexfontdb for the script name?

Thank you,

No cryptic, hard to remember cryptic names please, the slow terminal on
which Unix were developed are long gone ;)

I'd rather call it `update-fonts-database` and make it a wraper around
both luaotfload-fonts and fc-cache (may be with a switch to run only one
if needed).

 Khaled

I now have a more or less working babel patch, but I'm not sure if this
list is the proper place to discuss it, where else?

The proper place is latex-l [1]. But as Karl said, updates to babel are
currently complicated/slow for a number of reasons. Anyway, submit your patch,
and we'll just see :-)

Yes. But I would prefer to use the same name for the wrapper as for
the script, because this is handled automatically. So a wrapper
foo[.exe] will search for script foo with various extensions. The
cases where wrapper name and script name differ are treated specially
through an alias table (I will need to do that for the -sys variant),
but I generally try to avoid them.

Yes, on Windows the entire command line (sans argv[0]) is passed
through unparsed to the interpreter binary, with double quotes and
whitespace unchanged.

> Also, our script works under texlua (it calls fontloader), is it a
> problem?

Not at all. The wrapper we have on Windows actually links with
luatex.dll and calls texlua interpreter internally. If you are
interested in more details about the wrapper, you will find them in:

  http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/texlive/w32_wrapper/runscript.tlu

> What about updluatexfontdb for the script name?

Sounds good to me but I always leave those decisions to Karl.

Yes, precisely.

I suggest you add #!/usr/bin/env texlua to the beginning of the script, so that
under Unix we can just symlink it in the bin directory, just as we do we other
script. If it works this way under Unix, then thanks to Tomek's magic it will
Just Work? on Windows too (the only limitation is that arg[0] won't have the
same value as in the Unix case, hence the use of --sys instead of arg[0]-based
behaviour).

We're using texlua as our Lua interpreter, so no problem here.

texlua also has many libraries compiled into the binary and thus it's
quite usable.

Since there are already some -sys scripts we can't get rid of, I think
it's worthwhile to consider whether it makes sense to follow this
scheme, just that such programs behave similar.

There is at least an advantage, at least on Unix.  People who are
using command completion will notice immediately that there is a -sys
variant.

Formerly -sys programs were directly supported by the generic wrapper,
like this:

   if string.find(progname, '-sys$') then
     basename = (string.gsub(progname, '-sys$', ''))
     sys=true
   else
     basename = progname
   end

   if sys then
     os.setenv('TEXMFVAR', kpse.var_value('TEXMFSYSVAR'))
     os.setenv('TEXMFCONFIG', kpse.var_value('TEXMFSYSCONFIG'))
     os.setenv('TEX_SYS_PROG', 'true')
   end

But the current wrapper only supports updmap-sys.  The result is that
fmtutil exists twice on the system and getnonfreefonts-sys doesn't
work anymore on Windows.

Since the only difference between programs and the -sys variants is a
changed environment, I found the original behavior of the wrapper more
reasonable. 

Tomek, what do you mean with "I can't alter argv[0] for scripts"?
Don't you have to simply pass argv[0] from the .exe to the wrapper and
process it there?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'd say we shouldn't keep repeating the mistakes of the past just
because we can't (or unwilling) to fix the old ones.

The point is, when the interpreter is not lua, the argument to system looks like

executable = /path/to/perl.exe
argv[0] = perl.exe
argv[1] = c:/tlroot/texmf-dist/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl
argv[2] = ...

When perl.exe executes epstopdf.pl, it shifts all, so that $ARGV[0] is
c:/tlroot/texmf-dist/scripts/epstopdf/epstopdf.pl. If you want to lie to the
script about its $ARGV[0], you have to lie to perl.exe about its argv[1], which
is impossible (or it will fail to find the file). One would need an option like
"perl.exe --set-argv0=c:/blabla/bin/repstopdf otherarguments".

On Unix, all works fine because the argv[1] of /usr/bin/perl is the name of the
symlink, which still allows Perl to find the real file, and gives the expected
$ARGV[0] in the script.

This is the same for all other interpreters. As Tomek said, one could make an
exception for texlua scripts, since the interpreter is the wrapper written by
Tomek, hence we have total control over everything. But I don't think it would
be a good idea: uniformity is better.

I don't think it's a mistake.  It was a design decision and the way it
was done is reasonable:

A few years ago there were no distinct config files for users.  A user
had to do everything manually if he had own fonts or own format
files.  The -sys programs were introduced in TeTeX-2.0, if I recall
correctly.

The only difference between a system-wide and a per-user configuration
is that files are written to different directories.  Hence, the
obvious way to add the new functionality without revising the scripts
themselves was to add wrappers.  The scripts were thoroughly tested at
this time and providing just wrappers was the safest solution.  Thus I
think it was a good decision.

Regarding other scripts, I think that it's not a good idea to invent
other schemes because that would confuse people.  It's bad enough that
there is no unique scheme how to process command-line options and it's
annoying, for instance, that xpdf understands "-fullscreen" but not
"--fullscreen".

As far as getnonfreefonts is concerned, I provide a -sys program
because I'm convinced that this is what people expect.  The reason
there is a --sys option is simply that I wrote the program before
thinking about how it can be invoked under Windows and I thought that
such an option can't hurt. 

I don't think that what we have in TeX Live is wrong.  Just a design
decision, not a mistake.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I consider a "different behaviour based on executable name" a wrong
design decision and hence, IMHO, a mistake.

I don't understand this, how having "different behaviour based on
executable name" (which still requires editing the script to understand
this, right?) is a less invasive approach than, the more natural,
command line switches?
Andi, remind you, though this behaviour might be consistent through TeX
Live utilities, it differs from the rest of the world, which adds to the
frustration of newcomers (like me, that why I'm complaining, as all this
-sys naming did is confusing me like hell).

That is because each application is using his own command line options
parsing routines instead of, say, using GNU's getopt. (This reminds me
with an issue I was concerned about; we should have a lua getopt like
library for lua scripts to use to avoid inconstancies like this, I guess
this should be done right now before we start making legacies in the
Never Changing[TM] TeX world).

No, it does not differ from the rest of the world. It is quite common
in the unix world that there is one executable with several hard links
with different name. The function depends on the name of the hard link
by which it was invoked.

Since I never used a Unix, I can't tell. But here, in my GNU based
system, the only application, that I know, doing this is BusyBox and
that is a very special case.

I disagree on this point. It is perhaps a bit unfortunate, but I don't think
it's a mistake.

No, that is (or was) the point. The script was not edited, a wrapper was used
that just modified the environment before calling the original script.

> Andi, remind you, though this behaviour might be consistent through TeX
> Live utilities, it differs from the rest of the world,

No, look at the man page from GNU grep for example:

       In  addition,  three  variant  programs  egrep,  fgrep  and  rgrep  are
       available.   egrep  is  the  same  as  grep -E.   fgrep  is the same as
       grep -F.  rgrep is the same as grep -r.

I agree that many people I confused by the sys scripts (like calling updmap as
root) but I don't think they would be less confused if they had to call updmap
--sys rather than updmap-sys.

Sure. Reinhard and Norbert started something, you can find it in
texmf/scripts/texlive/lua/texlive but I don't know what's it status. Also, there
are a few getopt-like Lua modules out there, but last time I checked, none was
implementing exactly the GNU syntax, which is probably the more "standard" in
pracite.

I just found http://luaforge.net/projects/alt-getopt/ which seems to
fully implement GNU's getopt_long, I didn't try it, yet, though.

Then good luck with something like 

  dos2unix --unix2dos

instead of simply a link

  unix2dos

$ iconv -f "windows-1256" -t "utf-8"

(Just an example of how executable name "hack" is very limited compared
to standard practices).

Yeah, I noticed it, but didn't try either. This issue was discussed a bit on the
texdoc list (I just noticed the archives were private, I changed that) at the
end of 2008. At that point nothing looked satisfying. In january 2009, I
discovered that one, but I didn't test it since. (Looks like I'm terribly late.)

I guess someone should include it in a package on CTAN so that it gets in TL and
anyone can use it.

I think we should distinguish between mechanisms and policy in this
discussion. From the mechanisms POV (i.e. how to write the script) I
think it's best to have the --sys option *and* the condition on
argv[0]. This doesn't particularly complicate the script and gives us
the most flexibility without needlessly bothering the script author
should we change our policy.

Indeed. I was told that there is not need for getnonfreefonts-sys
support anymore. If this is not correct I suggest we discuss it off
the list.

The only reason I didn't implement the old behaviour was that upon
review it turned out that updmap-sys was the only one actually needing
it (Akira took care of fmtutil-sys). There is no problem to restore
the old behaviour, though, I'm just not sure if that's what we want.

I'm glad I didn't rush with my reply. I couldn't explain that better myself :)

I tend to disagree here, but I don't have a very strong opinion either.

My point is that if we remove other foobar-sys scripts, people will get confused
because there is quite a lot of web pages out there that mention them (and as we
all know, people use google rather than looking at the official and up-to-date
documentation). And having updmap-sys but update-luatex-fonts-db -- sys would be
confusing too. Anyway...

Sure.  I assume that you propose:

  pdftex --progname=etex
  pdftex --progname=latex
  pdftex --progname=pdflatex
  pdftex --progname=amstex
  ...

instead of

  etex
  latex
  pdflatex
  amstex
  ...

Right?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Regardless of anything else, we will not be removing the existing
foo-sys scripts (as long as I'm involved, anyway).  That would be insane.

Following this reasoning further we should use:

  pdftex -fmt=latex ...

but I rather use the current solution. Or to give yet another example
- the whole idea of the universal script launcher on Windows is based
on finding the right script based on argv[0]. Otherwise you would have
to call them as:

  runscript foobar ...

It is workable (tex4ht takes this approach with mk4ht) but not very
convenient, IMO.

Cheers,

Tomek

Nobody is suggesting this, but the question is: should we add more? I
will be soon updating the wrapper script anyway, so I can add back the
support for them.

i used to use tex back when there _was_ a separate executable for plain
tex, amstex, latex, texinfo, and so on.  it was a real pain to manage.

i'm all for executable name defining functionality, as now happens with
just two "traditional" tex executables in current systems.

Yes, I do actually propose that (and ConTeXt has been doing this for
ages), I for example strongly disliked the idea of having separate
luatex/lualatex binaries just to change the output format, to me this is
plain stupidity, but whom I to complain, younger than TeX being I.

We already have --fmt specifically for this (and --output-format in
pdftex/luatex to switch between pdf/dvi).

I think your age has nothing to do with your arguments. I'm rather a
newcomer to TeX myself and have fairly radical views on some aspects
of TeX ecosystem but I simply don't find your arguments (or the lack
thereof) convincing.

If tex engines wouldn't act on argv[0] then we would soon enough have
wrapper scripts/programs for the same purpose (and ConTeXt too comes
with a fair share of those). Your example with inconv is really
ill-contrived -- the main reason to introduce command shortcuts (and
argv[0] trick is just that) is convenience, not flexibility. It is
easier for people to associate a particular name with a particular
piece of functionality than to remember the right combination of often
cryptic switches of a general tool. I sure find it easier to use
ps2pdf than directly call gs with all the switches required (which I
don't remember anyway).

Cheers,

Tomek

Subject: [tex-live] How to do ... with array package?
Message-ID: <op.u8qf47kitpjj8f@lpr>

Dear friends,

I have problem setting centered alignment of some columns in a table (array package, tabular enviroment).

I can do it in any inner column, but not in the last one. I tried '\centering' command, 'center' environment, math mode using '$', but I'm not able to do it successfully.

Could you give me some help?

Here's the code (also in the attachment):


\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}

\usepackage[cp1250]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\usepackage{a4wide,array}


\begin{document}

    \newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering}m{.5in}}
    \newcolumntype{V}{m{.5in}}

    \begin{tabular}{|C|c|V|}
    %\begin{tabular}{|C|c|C|} % The 'C' in the last column causes error!
      \hline
      1     & ab ab ab    & 3 abcd efgh \\
      \hline
      11111 & 2 2 2       & 3.3 \\
      \hline
      1     & 2 2 2 3 3 3 & 3.33 \\
      \hline
      1     & 2 2 2       & 3 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{document}


I use TeXLive 2009 under WinXP.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,

Lukas Prochazka


NB:

This is my first mail to this conference; I hope it is not off-topic.

Firstly I referred my problem to Mr. Frank Mittelbach and/or Mr. David Carlisle.

Both of them are cited as authors of LaTeX array package documentation; unfortunately, there is no mail address in it.

The only mail to them I found was carlisle at cs.man.ac.uk. But the message returned to me as undeliverable.

you are better of sending to the texhax mailing list (see tug.org), this 
list is for TeXLIve development, not LaTeX macro problems

You problem is answered in the array manual

use

  \newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{.5in}}

\centering messes with the meaning of \\, \arraybackslash restores it to 
its meaning in arrays and tabulars.

They want versions compiled internally against the system .dll's,
which get updated with the distro updates.   If TL is in the distro
that will be get updated.   IT often takes the view that "security is
the priority" so updates will be applied even when they have
been told the application will break -- it is up to users to fix their
applications.    There is some justification for this -- for some it
is better not to have a document at all than to have one that
is being read by the wrong people and recent calls from the FBI
to some US corps demonstrated to upper management that
IT doesn't really know who is reading those documents.

Right -- users who want multiple versions of CTAN TL have to
save the older version and can't rely on going back to CTAN for
downgrades.   The important feature of CTAN TL (as opposed to
distro TL) is that you can install it (e.g., without creating links in
/usr/bin) in a way that allows you to have multiple versions and
switch back and forth as your projects require.

Use case: site has been running TL on platform X.  They find
that some updates to the base TL are needed, so freeze the
config after adding a particular set of updates.  Then they want
to move the system to platform Y.  Using CTAN they won't be
able to get to the version they have been running on X.   There
is actually a good chance they can just add the binaries for Y
to the platform X install and get something with the same texmf
trees that runs on platform Y, and in any case they need to
check that their jobs work the same on both platforms and be
prepared to do some troubleshooting when they don't.

I haven't been watching carefully for changes to binaries, but
on this machine most of the binaries don't appear to have
changed, although symbolic links and scripts have been
updated.

Note that the "use case" issue only occurs because the site
didn't test on the pre-release version.    I presume Karl does
test his files, which is why his "stable" version is the release
version.

Howdy,

I'm seeing the message

2010-02-26 08:03:38 -0600 Error tlmgr_cwrapper[416]	The following files should be removed due to the removal of texlive-docindex,

when I run TeX Live Utility (a front end for tlmgr on the Mac). Does something need to be updated in the repository?

Good Luck,

Considering my comments again, I think I was a bit exaggerating, I'd
even classify it as trolling :) Anyway I was just expressing my, may be
unreasoned, deep dislike of the "argv[0] trick". It isn't really that
critical issue.

And Elie even went ahead implementing '-sys' support, disregarding my
concern :P

    doc.html - texlive.infra

It is hard to read that.  But as best I can make out:

1. texlive-docindex has not been removed.  It was very recently created.
   It contains only the doc.html file, moved from texlive.infra.
   Perhaps it failed to be installed initially, so it is now "forcibly
   removed"?

2. There is nothing named tlmgr_cwrapper in TeX Live and never has been,
   as far as I can recall.  I surmise it is Adam's wrapper around tlmgr
   for TLU.  I wonder if a name like tlu_tlmgr_wrapper would be clearer.
   Adam, wdyt?  (Not that it's a big deal, of course.)

Best,
Karl

You are correct.  Tlmgr_cwrapper is mine; it calls setuid(geteuid()) so perl works with Apple's privileged task launching, and it also handles IPC so the main app can show output/progress.  Herb copy-and-pasted from the TLU log view, which intersperses my output with that of tlmgr and underlying utilities.  I'm not terribly motivated to rename the wrapper app at the moment, but I'll think on it.

Karl: That is an obvious problem: We created a new package contianing
doc.html, but the texlive.infra without the doc.html is still in
tltesting!

The removal is happening in the course of the update procedure.

As long as we do not update texlive.infra in tlnet this will happen with
every update of texlive-docindex.

So maybe push tlcritical together with the wrapper things Tomek mentioned?

Best wishes

Hi list.

In last update of svn trunk (using rsync, 27-02-2010) I noticed that
message.pot doesn't have string 'File' and in ru.po (Russian
translation) string 'File' is commented.

I don't that this was intentional because tlmgr gui still has 'File' menu entry.

Yes that is true. Please leave it like it is.

We will ship a new tlmgrgui with "File" replaced with "tlmgr" soon,
so no need to take action.

I know this might not be a proper place to ask, but I don't know any
better. I would like to add croatian translation to biblatex, in order
to replace babelbib with it.

Can anyone point me how to do it and who to contact?

Norbert, I totally agree with what you wrote. 

However - I also remember you writing that you were considering to
update TeXLive 2009 in unstable "at some point".  

Do you still think this is feasible?  How would you suggest to choose
the right moment?  

And might it be possible to somehow label this point for plain TeXLive
users?  If our Debian testers reveal an incompatibility that is solved
by updating a particular package, this could also be done in this
"labelled point".
