Of course! The release we had was as arbitrary as any other point.

svn revision will be the indicator. It is guaranteed to be found

Hi, everyone!

Well, I am really new in the Latex World, and since I decided to use TeX
Live I have had problems! I cannot use Beamer, because the
following error message shows up:

! LaTeX Error: File 'beamer.cls' not found.

Please, what can I do to solve this problem? Where can I download Beamer
from, and after that, where in TexLive should I paste it? I use Windows XP.
Thank you very much.

Did you install the all of TeX Live, or only a subset?

Can you send us the .log file of your test file.

Dear Texlive

I have just downloaded and installed texlive 2009, and my Antivirus
programme (Sophos) tells me that the following three files belong to a
malware (mal/Dorf-I)

C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32\dviout.exe
C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32\psv.exe
C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32\texworks.exe

Could you check if this is the case on your server and let me know where I
can get clean versions of these three files?

Thank you

Linda

If the files have the following md5sums:
d132caed244851b1a944221921611235  dviout.exe
4ea3886315f590856e6d921c54aca0f2  psv.exe

and sizes
dviout.exe* 3584
psv.exe* 13824
texworks.exe* 178688

then they don't have a virus, but your anti virus program is just reporting
a fals positive.

I am quite sure that it is that way, meaning that this is a false 
positive. Detecting a virus is heuristics, and it seems it failed here.

but you never know ;-)

The files are (almost certainly) clean. They probably just rub Sophos
the wrong way. Could you report it to them, so they can fix their
scanner?

I see that now that biblatex is in TeX Live my style s"biblatex-chem"

Hi Karl,

thank you so much for including biblatex and it's styles in TeX Live
as an update after release. I'm certain that many people really
appreciate that (and all other work you are doing to keep this
distribution going).

Message-ID: <313855311003041914u42b6de03kaead8a8f9fb3a1e6@mail.gmail.com>

I have successfully installed TeX live on many computers before, but
recently I tryied to install it on a friend's computer, and it failed. I
have no idea why. His system is Windows Vista, he has full administrator
privileges, and the user account control is disactivated.

I have downloaded the whole installation package before installation.

The installation program succesfully untarred a few packages, but then it
stopped and wrote the following message:

tar: Could not change access and modification times of .... Permission
denied
untar: untarring ..... failed, stopping install.
Installation failed
Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
I have googled this problem, and seen that several people have experienced
the same problem, but could not find any solution to it. If any of you could
give me some advice, it would be great. I am actively trying to promote the
use of LaTeX in my institution.

Best wishes,


Guillaume

Did you - in special - start the command prompt to run as administrator?

Message-ID: <bc9fce51003050312p2f02b38al70f2da438f1eb850@mail.gmail.com>

I Have Ubuntu Linux installed within a virtualbox on top of a Windows
system. My files are on a windows server that I can mount within
Ubuntu. I can see and edit my files from within Ubuntu just fine.
However, when I try and run LaTeX, it complains that the file is not
found.

Does anybody have a clue as to what is going wrong?

If I have not explained the situation well enough, please say so that
I can add any extra information that may help sort this issue out.

Which file is not found? What is your command line to invoke LaTeX?
Does "which latex" and "which pdflatex" find the right executable?

We need more information.  You should provide the exact command
and error message.

Are you using CTAN TeX Live that you installed yourself or the
Ubuntu packaged version?   If CTAN, did you install TL on the windows
drive or in the virtual disk?

Does LateX work if you copy the file to the virtual disk?

Are you using a GUI environment to run LaTeX or the command
line?

What happens if you run "pdflatex sample2e" in a terminal?

It is the version of LaTeX that comes with Ubuntu. I am running 10.04,
but the same thing happened with 9.10.

It does just fine. However, I need my files to be on the server

Subject: [tex-live] TeX-Live on Windows -- problem with dviout fixed
Message-ID: <201003051059.36839.jwe@cpceditor.demon.co.uk>

I have just installed the Oct2009 texlive in my Windows XP machine, and found 
that dviout hung when I used it on files with included graphics.

When I set gsx to point to another version of ghostscript that I have on my 
machine the problem went away.

Listed below are the cmd window output and the tmp files that dviout produces.
I fixed the problem of the distributed version of ghostscript not working by 
adding a Resource directory and copying the gs_res.ps file from the standard 
ghostscript distribution to the lib directory of the texlive distribution 
ghostscript.

-------
Another problem I have is setting the dviout search path for graphics files. 
Does anyone have a suggestion as to the best way to do this?

Interesting.   What does "kpsewhich st10-03_M1_with_L160_LED.tex" give?
You can use "strace latex ..." to see what system call is failing.  This will
generate a huge amount of output, so you need to set a terminal with lots
of scrolback space or use a shell in an emacs buffer.

Was the sample2e.aux file created?  What about log files?

This smells like a problem with using mmap2 on a CIFS
filesystem (using StarOffice aka OpenOffice):

<http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=104974>
"StarOffice is trying to mmap(2) a file in the smbfs mount point, which
returns ENOSYS because smbfs(7fs) does not support mmap"

At work we deal with hdf files and often have problems with apps
failing for files on CIFS mounts due to the same issue.  On Ubuntu
"man mmap" has explanations for a long list of possible errors.

strace -eopen latex ...

produces much less output.

I have reworked the tlmgr update routine so that thi problem should
hopefully be fixed. It will take some time until this tlmgr will
hit the general public, but from tomorrow on it should be available
in the tlcritical repository.

Best wishes

CLABBY (adj.)
A 'clabby' conversation is one stuck up by a commissionaire or
cleaning lady in order to avoid any further actual work. The opening
gambit is usually designed to provoke the maximum confusion, and
therefore the longest possible clabby conversation. It is vitally
important to learn the correct, or 'clixby' (q.v.), responses to a
clabby gambit, and not to get trapped by a 'ditherington' (q.v.). For
instance, if confronted with a clabby gambit such as 'Oh, mr Smith, I
didn't know you'd had your leg off', the ditherington response is 'I
haven't....' whereas the clixby is 'good.'

I did a quick test with trace. The last line before it stopped did
have mmap in it. I can't give more details now, as I am at home, but I
will definitely follow this line of inquiry on Monday.

Maybe too little output if the error is in mmap or mmap2 --
may -e trace=open,mmap,mmap2.

You should get the filename, e.g.:

$ kpsewhich st10-03_M1_with_L160_LED.tex
./st10-03_M1_with_L160_LED.tex

This is very helpful as kpsewhich has lots of debugging support.

pdftex uses mmap2 for lots of files -- you need to look for
lines like:

entering extended mode
open("st10-03_M1_with_L160_LED.tex", O_RDONLY) = 3

I installed Samba on my Ubuntu 9.10 box and mounted my home directory
using cifs on the same machine and can't reproduce the error.

$ df -t cifs

In my test using CTAN TL2009 the tex source file is not memory mapped.
Your version may behave differently, but the kpathsea problem suggests
that the problem is elsewhere.

TeX Live 2009 provides a "hidden" gs-8.70 for the programs which are
part of TeX Live.  It's deliberately not in %PATH% because it
shouldn't interfere with other instances of Ghostscript people have
installed on their machines.

These programs are launched by wrapper scripts which make the hidden
Ghostscript (and Perl) visible to them.  TeX Live's Ghostscript is
*not* supposed to be invoked directly from the command line.

Another thing you should be aware of:  Recent versions of Ghostscript
for Windows have the Resource directory and gs_res.ps compiled into
the binary.  The other version you installed is obviously older than
8.63.

   http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690000


In order to find out why dviout hangs, it's better to invoke
Ghostscript by a wrapper supplied by TeX Live:

   rungs @tmp$.@@@

But you should remove the Resource directory and gs_res.ps from
tlpkg/tlgs/ before.

Which error message do you get then?

Is the file "CulhamEMlogo.eps" the only one which doesn't work?  If
yes, can you send me a copy?

Don't DVI files contain paths to the graphic files already?  If dviout
doesn't find a graphics file you can use dvitype for debugging.  From
the manpage:

NAME
       dvitype - translate a dvi file for humans

SYNOPSIS
       dvitype dvi_name[.dvi]

  Reinhard

J?r?me has posted a comment:

?In fact, the current behavior is to write what TeX gives. This can differ from OS to OS and from distribution to distribution. Adding some filename management to SyncTeX would add too much overhead. Given a synctex file, the input file should be searched in the output directory and all the directories above.?

So if SyncTeX is not going to change, TeX Live and/or Skim should.

I repeated the tests using the debian packaged version of TL2009 and can't
reproduce the problem in this environment.   I have access to other servers,
but time will be limited until April, so I hope the OP can see something with
kpathsea debugging.

this command has worked in the past but today the error message said it had
failed to chdir to S:

S; being the DVDRW drive which the install took place from.

Could this be an unwell tlmgr-latest? The title bar says padate rather than
update.

Well if anyone can be of any help please respond,

'tlmgr update --self' and 'update-tlmgr-latest.exe' are two
independent ways of infrastructure update. The fact that both of them
fail points to some problem in tlmgr but I can't tell you off hand
what's wrong. Is drive S: empty when you run tlmgr?

I will try to look into it but I might not have time in the next few
days. How bad is the situation? Does latex et al. work?

Cheers,

Tomek

Was that from original DVD?

It seems that your tlmrg is still searching the original install location.
Did you change it to the network location?

Can you do:
	tlmgr option location ctan
	tlmgr update --self

What was the error message? I guess *not* the same as the one before,
because the code path for changing the repository does not go through
init_tlmedia.

Ah, but then again you cannot update, because there is nothing behind
that? DId you try
	tlmgr option repository ctan
?

TeX Live's policy is not to provide tex support files for fonts if the
actual fonts can't be provided too.  The actual fonts can't be part of
TeX Live for legal reasons.

Hi Philipp,

Having now read the comments and reread our previous thread ...

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2872347&group_id=58056&atid=486369
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-October/022844.html

.. I see no practical or desirable way to fix this in TeX Live somehow
"independently" of SyncTeX.  What's in the .synctex file is clearly part
of SyncTeX.  Jerome is the one who maintains the SyncTeX-related code in
TeX Live.  I'm not going to tamper with it.

Also: I find it very troublesome to make all paths absolute.  That just
seems fundamentally wrong to me.

However, it certainly seems right to me for the synctex file to include
the input directory to which the relative paths are relative, since I
don't see any other way for viewers to find the directory.  As "hofman"
on that thread suggested.

I'll post a note on that thread too.

karl

I agree. I don't know why I suggested this, probably I thought it was the simplest solution. Of course, I don't insist on absolute paths; everything else that fixes the problem would be fine.

Message-ID: <CD84F074-5991-442D-9852-F3D39688074D@mac.com>

Hi,

I just noticed that tlmgr and AucTeX install preview.sty (et al.) in two different branches of the TeXLive tree (in Debian, but I guess it might be the same in other distros).

I had done a tlmgr update of TeXLive a few days ago (24 Feb), and yesterday I updated AucTeX (from 11.85 to 11.86).

tlmgr had installed preview.sty 11.86 (et al.) in

/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/preview/

whereas AucTeX installed it in

/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/tex/latex/preview/


kpsewhich shows that the one used is

/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/tex/latex/preview/preview.sty

that is, the one installed by AucTeX; both are, as said, v11.86. I think it would be better if both installers look into the same branch to do the updates.


Best,

Axel

Hi,

I've updated TeXLive 2009 today and noticed that my small caps in headings are gone. Were there any changes in memoir recently or my installation got messed up? Here's a simplified example code which worked previously:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
\documentclass{memoir}

% Actually, Xe(La)TeX isn't needed to reproduce the problem; it exist with pdflatex too


\makepagestyle{test}

\makeevenhead{test}{\thepage}{\scshape\MakeLowercase\leftmark}{Test TEST}
\makeoddhead{test}{Test TEST}{\scshape\MakeLowercase\rightmark}{\thepage}
\pagestyle{test}

\usepackage{lipsum}

\begin{document}
\chapter{Test Chapter}
\section{Test Section}
\lipsum[1-111]
\end{document}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

NOTE: I tried \makeps marks and \nouppercaseheads and all I get is that without \nouppercaseheads I managed to get upper case letters, but never small caps. Ideas?

if thes works in the past I'd see it as a fluke of nature. As far as I 
know we did not change anything in relation to the headers

But this works

\let\memUChead\MakeLowercase
\pagestyle{test}

the lower casing does not belong in the headers, it should go into the 
\sectionmark macros (which is where \memUChead lives)


please post memoir problems on comp.text.tex, the tex live list if for 
the distribution as a whole not problems with single units

DId you install AucTeX using .deb package or by building from sources?

I don't like the idea of a 3rd party package changing the contents of
the trees that are managed by tlmgr, but that is up to the 3rd party
package
developers.

Since AucTeX is a combination of emacs stuff and support files for
LaTeX, it doesn't make sense to have an AucTeX package for TeX Live
(except maybe on Windows), so the decision about what and where
support files are installed is up to AucTeX.   If AucTeX installs
support files, I'd prefer that they go in texmf-local, but it would be
nice if the AucTeX installer checked for the support files and only
installs them if they are not already present in the distro.

In any case, the AucTeX configure allows you to set the texmf path and
tex-dir, so at least you can ensure that preview.sty ends up in the
location of your choice.

if thes works in the past I'd see it as a fluke of nature. As far as I know we did not change anything in relation to the headers

But this works

\let\memUChead\MakeLowercase
\pagestyle{test}

the lower casing does not belong in the headers, it should go into the \sectionmark macros (which is where \memUChead lives)


please post memoir problems on comp.text.tex, the tex live list if for the distribution as a whole not problems with single units

It's certainly not intended.  But it's what is on CTAN.

Martin, this mailing list is the wrong place to ask.  Could you
contact the author instead?  It's not a TeX Live issue and has to be
fixed upstream.

I installed preview.sty in the standard way for TL because it is part of
the preview[-latex] package on CTAN.

David, if you prefer that I install it in texmf (seems wrong to me), or
not install it at all, just let me know.  Whatever you want.

Is it feasible to remove preview.sty from CTAN, put it somewhere under
site-lisp/auctex and set TEXINPUTS in Emacs accordingly?  If only
Emacs needs preview.sty, this is certainly the best solution.

And, maybe, if they are older; but that means that tlmgr (and MiKTeX?) has to recognize also if the files installed by AucTeX are up to date or older when you do a general update.

No, not this! Please see below.

No, please! As a matter of fact, I started using preview.sty before using more seriously Emacs-AucTeX ---on a Mac, with TeXShop, and beamer.cls, I've done standalone TikZ graphics for later inclusion on a book:

So, preview.sty is *really* useful independently of Emacs-AucTeX.

On the other hand, Seiji Zenitani manages to make a self-contained Emacs-AucTeX-preview package:

http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html

But it's way out of my knowledge to replicate his procedure.

As a matter of fact, with the previous install (AucTeX v11.85) I had used ~/texmf in Debian (and ~/Library/texmf in the Mac). But in February, seeing that tlmgr was installing a newer version of preview.sty, I decided to get rid of preview.sty et al. in my personal trees in both OS.

Now ---with Debian installing AucTeX is really simple ---just

./configure
make
make install

and it finds both my build of Emacs (v23.x) and TeXLive. But on the Mac that's not so simple --- configure finds the Emacs shipped by Apple (/usr/bin/emacs, v22.x), instead of my build (v23) in /Applications, and gets confused by the MacTeX mechanism of /usr/texbin, so I have to configure with-emacs, with-lispdir and with-texmf-dir.

Trying to keep both TeXLive distros (Debian and Mac) always the same, I looked into Debian where were the support files installed, and that's when I found AucTeX and tlmgr were installing in different branches.


Best,

Axel

preview.sty is a standalone style and used by numerous other packages
such as pst-pdf.sty.

The Emacs subsystem AUCTeX (which includes preview-latex) has provisions
to install a private version preview.sty into the Emacs source tree and
use that for Emacs-internal operation.

If Debian's Emacs installation (which is a black art for itself) chooses
not to avail itself of this but installs another preview.sty somewhere
else, I'd not consider this a problem of the TeXlive team.  Keeping the
Debian Emacs maintainers from shooting everybody in the foot including
themselves is not really humanly possible.

Yes ---as I said in other post, I've used it for TikZ pictures.

This is what Seiji Zenitani does in his Carbon Emacs for the Mac (but, alas!, v22.x, that's why I also build Emacs for the Mac from CVS).

No, I never meant that ---everything is hand-installed and -build ---TeXLive, Emacs, and AucTeX, and completely independent one from another (well, not completely ---AucTeX asks for Emacs and a TeX distribution if it can't find them, of course). First, TeXLive from TUG, then Emacs from http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/, and last AucTeX from http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex.

I didn't use Debian's repositories at all!

So it is AucTeX from http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex that installs preview.sty et al. in a different branch than tlmgr, when using just configure / make / make install. Of course I could specify in options for configure which TeXLive branch to use, but if it worked ``out of the box'', why bother?

And, by the way, thank you for AucTeX ---I'm sure the next book I copy-edit/produce will be done completely in Emacs with AucTeX.

Best,

Axel

i don't see the relation between th predicate and the conclusion there.
whatever, "removing from ctan" is something the author does, and given
the _other_ uses of preview.sty, i don't really see that it would be
particularly desirable.

> If only

preview.sty has other uses, for sure.

i don't believe your proposal is a "solution", but if the authors want
to remove preview.sty from ctan, we wouldn't prevent them.

Indeed.

I think that now we all pretty much agree that preview *shouldn't* be removed from CTAN/TeXLive. I've never used psTricks, but the production of standalone TikZ graphics is very useful and popular. I've done that with TeXShop on a Mac, but here is an example in Linux:

http://www.hackenberger.at/blog/ktikz-editor-for-the-tikz-language

and here the same within Emacs:

I think the key point here is that AucTeX source installer (e.g.,
configure) should assume preview.sty may have been installed by the
TeX distro or some package manager.   Certainly configure can do some
tests for an existing preview.sty, but there are potential problems:

1.  some other uses of preview.sty might break when a newer version is installed

2.  for people like me who routinely have multiple versions of TL
(distro, svn, etc.) preview.sty might not be the same in all distros,
so whatever install-time check is done would be incomplete.   If I'm
trying to keep a stable snapshot of TL for some long-term project
(book) and use preview.sty there is a potential for breakage whenever
the system AucTeX is updated.

I would prefer that the default with "configure; make ; make install"
be "--without-texmf"
to put preview.sty in the lisp directories for the exclusive use of
AucTeX (e.g., with
adjustment to TEXINPUTS).   Even then, if there are version clashes
with other uses
of preview.sty this could cause some problems for emacs users, who
might need to
selectively disable auctex for some documents.

> And, by the way, thank you for AucTeX ---I'm sure the next book I copy-edit/produce will be done completely in Emacs with AucTeX.

A number of people who abandoned TeX over a decade ago, in part because latex
sources are "hard to read",  have expressed surprise when they see a document

Yes, I think that's the ideal, but also to check which is newer.

The same with tlmgr.

Oh!... How embarrassing! So this is how it is done! How fool of me not to have read the small ``If you use the `--without-texmf-dir' option...'' paragraph.

Indeed, I tried on my Mac and it installed everything in site-lisp, including preview.sty et al. in .../site-lisp/latex, and typesetting and previewing show it's using the installed files:

(/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/auctex/latex/preview.sty
(/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/auctex/latex/prtightpage.
def)

No question about it --it's really beautiful and *so* easy to read!

Hello,

The ?mktexfmt? tool from TeX Live 2009 apparently fails to honor the
?--fmtdir? option:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
$ HOME=/nowhere mktexfmt --fmtdir $PWD --all ; echo $?
fmtutil: format directory `/nowhere/.texlive2009/texmf-var/web2c' does not exist.

--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

Below is the output of this script after adding ?set -x?.  I?m not
familiar with the tools involved so I can?t make much sense of it.

Any ideas what?s going wrong?

Thanks,
Ludo?.

I think the key point here is that if you have nontrivial
configurations, you should read the installation instructions.

Hi Ludovic?

If I'm correct, the syntax of mktexfmt is
mktexfmt foo.fmt etc. The extension is necessary.
You have to use fmtutil if you need the option --fmtdir.
mktexfmt is a symbolic link of fmtutil, however the
syntax in the mktexfmtMode is different.

Akira

Or you should install using the defaults and then look for
problems, as the OP appears to have done.  Since you have
to test in any case, this is a useful approach because it
examines what most users will do.

IIncreasingly,  configure ... are run by some build system like macports
or openpkg so user has to rely on some 3rd party to do the reading.

That's not a good idea since by then you may have clobbered parts of
your system.  I actually never do that.  Even if I try out things
blindly, the very least is to

make -n install

before doing anything more permanent.

And it will work even in this case.  And if preexisting stuff sits in
competing paths, the configure run will give out warnings at the end if
I am not mistaken.

If you don't follow instructions, don't look at what the installation
does, and don't heed warnings, yes, you might get yourself into trouble.

Blaming AUCTeX for that is a bit cheap.

It would be helpful to know what's exactly the error message you see.
There is no message starting with "runscript.dll: no such script ..."

I wrote the libertine author.  Most of the new tfm's do not actually
define any characters, as far as I could tell.

    It will be an interesting test for the live DVD.

I guess I'll take this opportunity to say that for 2010, we've concluded
that the DVD will not contain a live TL distribution.  Instead, it will
contain essentially what is now "tlnet", the compressed per-package
archives.  Experiments show that this will make installation from DVD
much faster (less read head seeking).

These days, people are much more likely to run live from a USB stick.
Those who do want a live DVD can do an install and burn their own from
the result.  We'll talk about this in the documentation, when the time
comes.

As Hans said years ago, "TeX Live" can be taken to mean
"TeX [is still a]live" :).

I somehow agree that making inputting utf8 with -recommended would be

Well, ucs isn't required for utf8 input, \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} is enough.
Maybe ucs has a better coverage, I'm not sure, but I don't see a problem with it
being in -extra, since there is already something for utf8 input in -recommended.

Hi Guillaume,

quoting Guillaume Jacques, [10.03.2010 05:36 +0100]:
> Dear Andreas,

As far as I can see, the PATH from the first try is still present. Maybe
this causes the problem.

Try to remove every file from prior installations and remove the
TL-Parts from the PATH-Enviroment and give it another try.

Good luck!

Andreas

Well, I myself always use \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}, but without

As suggested, there seem to be some files with wrong permissions.

Please remove
	c:\texlive\2009
completely, then start a new installation.

Aside from already mentioned things, ucs also breaks pdf title, author
and keywords. It gets stuff like
[Pleaseinsert\??rerenderUnicode{??}intopreamble] for every non-ASCII
character.

I would keep it in extra.

utf8 covers (at most) characters represented in latex-standard font
encodings.  anything (like japanese, for example) without such an
encoding, isn't covered.

in your case, i would imagine the problem was just that.

analysis of the code of utf8x leads me to suspect that it's not as
robust as that of utf8; since utf8x is not supported, this could in
principle be a problem.

fwiw, the only european language omitted from utf8, afaik, is greek.

as an (indirect) result, i've never actually used utf8.

Hi Lars,

I drop TW list from this conversation, since the problem seems TL related.

The runscript wrapper consist of a few pieces but there is no such (or
similar) message anywhere in its sources. Without more information I'm
not able to troubleshoot it. I regularly use TW through TL wrapper on
my Vista system and don't have such problems (nor anyone else reported
them).

How did you start TW (command line / explorer)? Was console window
opened with it? Where did the message appear (console window / pop-up
dialog)? Was tlmgr (infrastructure) up to date?

Cheers,

Tomek

To get rid of this behavior, you just have to do what the message suggests (or read the documentation). This is not the reason why ucs and utf8x should be avoided; rather, it's the maintenance status, the complexity of the package, and its failure to work with packages like csquotes.
In princliple, the whole idea of ucs (and also of inputenc) is flawed: The (pdf)TeX engine is not and will never be Unicode-aware. This is impossible to fix on the macro level: you need a modern engine (i.e., LuaTeX).

Are you talking about utf8 or utf8x (? ucs) here? The former is part of the LaTeX kernel; the latter has not been improved since 2004 and is unsupported, perhaps it should even be added to the l2tabu document. If you want Greek, Japanese or similar, you probably should not be using pdfTeX at all.

we tried the icon on the desktop, and texworks.exe directly in explorer, 
same result in both.

it was a clean net install just 30 min old, so I'd assume that it was 
completely up to date.

I have to see if I can find the student again

Catched in hyperref 2010/03/10 v6.80m (TUG server, tomorrow CTAN).

BTW: \PrerenderUnicode from ucs.sty:

| \uc at newcommand\PrerenderUnicode{%
|   \@ifstar{\@prerenderunicode\unichar}{\@prerenderunicode\@gobble}}%
| \uc at newcommand\@prerenderunicode#1#2{%
|   \begingroup
|   \UnicodeCharFilter\@gobble
|   \let#1\@gobble\setbox0\hbox{#2}\endgroup}

should use "\sbox0{#2}" instead of "\setbox0\hbox{#2}" to prevent
leakage of color specials.

Hello,

I had forgotten to upload my bundle yesterday. Unhappily
hyperref relies on it, thus currently there is an error
message. Workaround:

\makeatletter
\RequirePackage{ltxcmds}[2010/01/28]
\@ifpackagelater{ltxcmds}{2010/03/09}{}{%
  \def\ltx at pkgextension{sty}%
}
\makeatother

The updated bundle is already uploaded to the TUG server,
thus the problem will vanish soon.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko

I have spent long time to install TeX Live, there is always some problem
with your fuckign system.

1. DVI viewer does not work
2.TeXworks editor does not work,

I installed TeX works seperately to check the other part of the system,
spell check also does not work.

Send me the links to reinstall these three functions.

They might all be done seperatly but there are files for them I don't know
which to delete to get rid of the junk part of the system when get them
seperatly.

Thanks for your very intelligent contribution. If you want support
please send pay checks, or be friendly, otherwise nobody will
have the slightest intention to help -- we are all doing this
in our spare time for free.

Enjoy, and learn to behave, that is what one normally learns at the
age of 6 or so, and you should not forget that.

unicode-based engines good, 8-bit engines (tex, pdftex,...) bad.

you can bash 16-bit (or whatever) characters into an 8-bit engine, but
the result is hardly robust.  people _can_ do it (witness heiko with
hyperref) but it's going to be increasingly difficult to make such
piecemeal solutions inter-work.

or it would, were it not for xetex and up-and-coming luatex, which
eliminate the need for the lot.

in the words of the advertising twaddle: you _know_ it makes sense.

Well, so many things have been done with 8-bit engines, so I
would not say bad, but space for improvement ;-)

Yes I know, and I agree. but still we are a long long way from
replacing pdftex with luatex.

Time for change. The inputenc package makes use of active characters
and multibyte characters come in pieces. If your macro contains
\futurelet\somechar\dosomething then \somechar may contain a part of a
character. another example, suppose that you redefine \chapter so that
it changes the first character into an initial by:

\def\PutInitial#1{\global\everypar{}%
  % code for putting #1 as an initial
}
\everypar{\PutInitial}

Now #1 may contain just a part of a character and using this part will
cause an error. That's why I cannot use inputenc even with Czech, I
need above mentioned constructs in my LaTeX macros and the same macro
must work both with accented and non-accented characters. Moreover,
non-accented characters can be compared by \if, multibyte characters
and active characters cannot.

I wouldn't argue that way: the same is true for all systems that use variable-width encodings like UTF-8 or UTF-16, and there are lots of these systems (Java, Windows, Cocoa...). You simply have to know that a "char" in Java is de facto a UTF-16 code unit, and that all string functions work on code units, not characters. The situation is not that different from the TeX one, it's just a bit more obvious when using UTF-8 (non-ASCII characters are ubiquitous, in contrast to non-BMP characters).

These are not necessarily limitations of inputenc: If languages like C or Java had only a "char" (meaning: UTF-8 or UTF-16 code unit) and not a "string" datatype, similar issues would arise; that's why "char" datatypes have limited usage nowadays, and some languages like Python don't use them at all. The problem is rather that TeX has no real string datatype.

I think the problem with pdfTeX and inputenc is not so much the variable-with encoding, but rather the technical delicacies (LICRs, font encodings...). Usually the first step when reading a text file is converting it to some internal (fixed) Unicode-enabled encoding, something pdfTeX just cannot do; and the macro language inadequate for this.

Message-ID: <20100311041806.GJ26801@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi all,

there is again something fishy going on with supp-pdf.mkii: The following
simple test document fails:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\newcommand{\undefined}{\textbf{undefined}}
\begin{document}
This is an \undefined\ command.
\end{document}

with
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/context/base/supp-pdf.mkii
! Undefined control sequence.
l.17   \writestatus
                   {loading}{ConTeXt Support Macros / PDF}


I assume it comes from supp-pdf.mkii testing
	\ifx\writestatus\undefined

But \undefined is a completely valid TeX command. Mind that I am
even using \newcommand here. 

Any suggestion to fix this?

Best wishes

Norbert

Well, let's say it is a perfectly valid command that you shouldn't
be defining. In non-etex mode, the only way to test for the existence
of a control sequence is by comparing it to an undefined one, and
Hans chose \undefined, and I don't think using a more bizarre one will
actually solve anything.

Best wishes,
Taco

Well, something like
\makeatletter
\ifx\writestatus\@undefined@
...
\makeatother
would probably protect against these errors, I mean, isn't it still
good practice to use some @ in internal command names ...

Or some \let\@original...

As for now I can imagine *many* usages of \undefined as normal command,
but as of now we make it impossible to be used as soon as graphicx
package is loaded (maybe some others).

Please, make that a bit more robust!!

What does it cost us do use something that 99% of normal TeX documents
will *NOT* use as command names?

Best wishes

This is purely a LaTeX convention.

Well, in one-and-a-half decades of \undefined, you are the first
person to run into this and complain (there could be more that
didn't complain, of course). But I'll talk it over with Hans.

I think the big difference is that since 2008 or 2009 we automatically
load the supp-pdf.mkii code, which didn't happen before.

People did the conversion by hand.

SO that might be the reason it didn't show up till now.

At least in TL2007 there was no problem with that! And in this respect
I am concerned about backward compatibility.

A document that is perfeectly fine in TL2007 suddenly does not compile
at all, and not due to some bad usage of internal things of a macro
package, but we suddenly load supp-pdf.mkii automatically.

I consider this a reason to change that.

Well, it might ...  If the test were written as (e.g.)

	\expandafter \ifx \csname N0-b0dy 1n th at 1r r1ght m1nd w0uld us@ th1s @s @ c at ntr@l s at qu@nce \endcsname \writestatus

then the probability of a clash would be significantly smaller :-)

Hans sent me new versions of supp-pdf.mkii and supp-mis.mkii
that use eTeX's \ifdefined instead of \ifx\undefined.

supp-pdf is from ConTeXt, and the LaTeX naming conventions just don't apply for ConTeXt.  I think there is no distinction between "internal" and "public" names in ConTeXt.

But supp-pdf is now loaded at *every* latex run where graphicx is loaded,
AFAIS. 

And in addition, even if many other packages do the same, supp-pdf 
seems to be the only one making it break. Manuel mentioned fancyhdr and
hyperref, but both do NOT break:

Good:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref,fancyhdr}
\newcommand{\undefined}{\textbf{undefined}}
\begin{document}
Hello World \undefined
\end{document}


Bad:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\newcommand{\undefined}{\textbf{undefined}}
\begin{document}
Hello World \undefined
\end{document}


That is not a good situation.

Best wishes

\newcommand doesn't prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.
Defining \undefined is a very bad idea. Altough having \@undefined
in LaTeX, many packages are using \undefined:
  find texmf-dist/tex/latex -exec grep -l '\\undefined' {} \;|wc
found 530 files.

> Any suggestion to fix this?

I have catched this case in pdftex.def 2010/03/11 v0.04o
and hyperref 6.80n/backref 1.35 and I left you the other 527 cases,
preventing you from getting bored. ;-)

You're right.

Anyway, the supp-pdf case is solved thanks to Hans, but I still consider
\newcommand\undefined{anything} a dangerous practice that should be discouraged.

Does that matter? I highly doubt TeX82 will be able to process

As I wrote to Norbert: give Hans and me few days to make sure the fix
is ok. After that, I'll commit to texlive directly.

Yes, documents just loading supp-pdf.mkii without using it
will break. It isn't possible to simulate \ifdefined using macros.

supp-pdf.mkii didn't need eTeX to process MetaPost PostScript output.
Even metafun can be used without eTeX:

%%% cut %%% testmetafun %%% cut %%%
% process with:
% pdflatex "testmetafun.tex"
% metafun "testmetafun.mp"
% pdflatex "testmetafun.tex"
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}

supp-pdf.mkii takes care of non-eTeX users:

If \ifdefined or \ifcsname are only used at top level, then
I can write a workaround for pdftex.def. Otherwise I would
have to drop MetaPost support in pdftex.def, if eTeX is not
enabled.

commit it to texlive, only, and we'll have an obsolete version on ctan.
since texlive updates from ctan, we don't update from texlive, for fear
of looping.

This is getting silly. Can someone please do a fork of these
files already? Hans and I are not amused with all those
requests for changes in core context files just because
other people want to use them.

FWIW, I attempted (in the development sources) to improve the error

Message-ID: <201003111928.o2BJS4O2019524@comp.uark.edu>


Hi:

In my installation (TL2009 under WinXP) texindy fails. All
incantations, even something as simple as
   texindy -h
result in
   texindy.pl: cannot locate xindy
There is no problem in running xindy directly.

It was easy to track down where this error message comes from,
namely the definition of $xindy at lines 365--378 of texinfy.pl.
I came up with a 3-line change that seems to correct it. See the
diff below.

Note that the original code searches for xindy.exe only under
$ENV(TL_ROOT), and this variable is not defined. Defining it
(in the environment or in texmf.cnf) permits texindy to run
normally. The search for xindy.bat is perfectly good, but
xindy.bat no longer exists. I merely copied the same search
command, substituting xindy.exe for xindy.bat.

Regards,
Dan

Nice.

Speaking of mysterious errors, I wasn?t able to make much sense of this
one:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
This is a summary of all `failed' messages:
`luatex -ini  -jobname=luatex -progname=luatex luatex.ini' failed

The newest release (install-tl-20100309) of the install-tl script
fails on Solaris 10 09/2009 because the OS version isn't matched
correctly. The auxiliary script tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm calls the
tlpkg/installer/config.guess which returns sparc-sun-solaris2.10
The "solaris" choice in tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm is not matched
because of the regexp used /\b$os\b/

Don't think I can do much about that one.  The real errors should be

    \newcommand{\undefined}{\textbf{undefined}}

I know there were a lot of replies to this already, but ...

1. IMHO, any document that defines \undefined deserves what it gets, so
   "no change" (which seems to be where we ended up, with Heiko's
   workarounds) is ok with me.

2. Nevertheless, in order to minimize such stupid breakage, rms long ago
   recommended using \thisisundefined instead of just \undefined.  IMHO,
   I think that couldn't hurt.  Using special characters or etex
   commands, in this particular case, seems like it causes at least as
   much trouble as it solves.  As discussed.

Humbly,
Karl

Subject: [tex-live] installing TeXLive
Message-ID: <4B9A3355.6040504@FU-Berlin.DE>

Hi,
today I installed TeXLive with my students on 16 computers.
I have to use VMware for running Linux under Windows.
On every computer and with every mirror I get errors
like

./tlpkg/installer/xz/xzdec.i386-linux: (stdin): Unexpected end of input
tar: Das sieht nicht wie ein ?tar?-Archiv aus.
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
untar: untarring /home/voss/texlive/temp/tap.tar failed (in
/home/voss/texlive/texmf-dist)
untarring /home/voss/texlive/temp/tap.tar failed, stopping install.
Installation failed.
Rerunning the installer will try to restart the installation.
Or you can restart by running the installer with:
  install-tl --profile installation.profile [EXTRA-ARGS]
Writing log file to current working directory.
voss at linux-f5ux:~/Downloads/install-tl-20100311>
------------------------------

restarting with using the mirror of my own university
(ftp.fu-berlin.de) doesn't really helped. I have no idea if
this might be a problem of VMware, which runs under Windows XP.
It was a bit curious, because it was not the same package
where the installer stopped on the different computers.

I've been assuming that errors like these are mostly due to internet
breakage, including traffic shaping.   Installing TL requires an
unusual volume of network traffic and may be triggering some
protection mechanisms at your site.

How much memory and disk do the VM's have.  My experience
with computer labs is that they are often set up for simple programming
and often don't have memory or disk for large applications.

There might be some hints in the system logs or the
windows event viewer.

Hi,

I installed the Tex Live 2009 from the internet to run on a windows XP 32
bit. But I couldn?t make it to work. When I try to run the TexWorks it says
that "there is no such file or directory" and when i try to run the PS_View
it says "Failed to load shared library 'gsdll32.dll'(error126)"

Can someone help me?

Thank you for your consideration,

Thanks for the report. I located the source of problems and will fix
them soon (hopefully today + a couple of days to mirror it). In the
mean time you can do the following:

For texworks make sure that there exists directory:
  kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFCONFIG

For dviout make sure that there exists directory:
  kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR

PS_View can be started for the time being from the command line with
the `psv' command.

Cheers,

I saw it, figured that it was the same problem.

BTW: what exactly was the problem?

Hmm, that seems *really* strange. Why?

The packages you download are .xz compressed. So if the uncompress 
would have failed, then there should already be a warning message.
Same with the download, the md5sums are checked. So all that is fine.

Now, what remains is that either the xzdec at un-xz time creates something
broken, which could be possible, or the tar file itself is broken.

But we check our server in a daily cron script and during that unpack
*all* packages, so we would see an error.
 
Also ...

due to the fact that it happens at different packages points to 
something very strange right in vmware/xp, and not by itself in
the texlive. If the underlying OS/(pseudo)hardware makes problems,
we cannot catch them.

Sorry, bottomline of all that, no idea what to do.

Best wishes

Since the problem occurs for different packages, and others are not
reporting problems, it is more likely the tar extract is failing due
to some issue
in the VM's.  This could well be a resource constraint -- size of the
virtual disk
or RAM.   I've seen problems with VM's under Windows due to bugs in
iastore.sys.
These may be cured with  a  simple update if the IT people at your
site will allow
you to install updates.  Usually there are errors that can be found in
the Windows
event viewer.

It would be useful to know RAM requirements for TL installs.  I do
installs on a i386-linux box that has 1G physical and 2G swap space.

The OP could install TL on one (non-virtual) machine (with multiple
architectures if the machine is not the same as the VM's) and copy
the texlive directory to the VM's.

Hi.

Please, don't drop mailing list from your reply. It will be much faster
and easier to track down you problem.

And again, this is strange. Why 'texmf-dist/doc/context/manuals/...' has
ls-R?

Check environment variables (Windows and your tool): run in cmd.exe and
in your tool 'set' command.

May be you don't have permission to write onto file
C:/texlive/2009/texmf-config/ls-R?

Always use
prompt$ kpsewhich rcs.sty
to check if there is such file (read: could be found by texlive).
If file exists (on disk) that doesn't mean that texlive could find it.
If you curious why that read tds and texlive manual.

You could redefine TEXMFHOME, in TEXMFMAIN/web2c/texmf.cnf.

These variables look good (expect last one: why
'texmf-dist/doc/context/...' here?). Check your
TEXMFMAIN/web2c/texmf.cnf

Check if you have permissions to write to these directories.
And run mktexlsr (or texhash) from cmd.exe.

It may or may not matter. If there is no change in the corresponding
tree may remain unchanged. The problems with write permissions can
arise if you install TL as a normal user and then invoke mktexlsr as
admin. The fastest solution is to delete all ls-R files from all TeX
tress as admin and then call mktexlsr as normal user. Be sure that the
directories themselves are writable.

Message-ID: <20100315224631.GA17246@oberdiek.my-fqdn.de>

Hello,

in comp.text.tex there is a discussion about mktextex.
The following test file for plainTeX shows the
primitives that calls mktextex (if MKTEXTEX is enabled):

\pdfobj file{file-pdfobj.dat}\relax
\openin5=file-openin.dat\relax
\pdffilesize{file-pdffilesize.dat}\relax
\pdffilemoddate{file-pdffilemoddate.dat}\relax
\pdfmdfivesum file{file-pdfmdfivesum.dat}\relax
\pdffiledump length 1{file-pdffiledump.dat}\relax
\input file-input.dat\relax
\pdfximage{file-pdfximage.dat}\relax
\csname @@end\endcsname\end

Result: mktextex is called for
* \pdfobj file
* \pdffilesize
* \pdffilemoddate
* \pdfmdfivesum
* \pdffiledump length (>=1)
* \input
* \pdfximage

The exception is
* \openin

Is this on purpose, accidentally, bug?
I couldn't find documentation/specification of this feature.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko

On win32, MAKE_TEX_TEX_BY_DEFAULT should have been 0,
since we have not mktextex.exe.
I had set it to be 1 by mistake.
I don't know on the other platforms.

That could explain the problem of the OP in comp.text.tex.

It's disabled by default under Linux.
For testing I have done the following to enable the feature:
* Environment variable MKTEXTEX=1
* Script that prints its argument as `mktextex' in PATH.

\openin does not respect the feature.
It can be on purpose, because it is used in \IfFileExists.
But it is not a clean way, because \openin could expect
real data files that should be generated by mktextex or
\pdffile(size,moddate) are used for existence tests,
especially for graphics files (\pdfximage supports space
in file names).

Yours sincerely

I seem to remember that's the reason indeed (though I can't find any reference
right now). For this case, kpse_find_file is called with false as its last
argument (must_exist), so that it doesn't try to "make" the file with an mk* script.

I tend to agree. Morover, if some day we want to use mktextex for on-the-fly
installation of packages ? la MikTeX, we'd better have mktextex triggered by
\openin, since it's used by \usepackage before doing an \input, iirc. Then, it's
up to mktextex to do the right thing if the file is not actually meant to exist.

Message-ID: <4B9F6C40.8090302@gmx.net>

Hello,

just now I happened to come across the "quite affordable" collection of 
fonts at www.fontsite.com. And the corresponding TeX support files at 
http://contrapunctus.net/league/haques/fs500tex/. And I wondered why the 
support files haven't been submitted to CTAN yet. This way maybe a few 
people more could take notice of their existence.

 From Fontsite, you can get e.g. a Bembo (Bergamo), Garamond, Sabon 
(Savoy), Futura (Function), Optima (Opus), all with small caps, oldstyle 
figures, and many others more...

...for ~15$ each (!). For a complete family.

Is there anything wrong with these fonts that an amateur like me can't 
spot from the PDF samples?

TIA,

Sincerely,

Wolfgang

Some one have to upload it to CTAN, this is usually whoever who prepared

there used to be a fontsite 500 disc you could buy, for an even sillier
price.  istr there was a set of metrics for the fonts on that disc, but
that was long ago and i can't find any reference to it now, though your
link may refer to the same thing.

fontsite-garamond appears in the mathdesign bundle, fwiw.

in general people seem to consider that fonts at these sorts of prices
*must* be ripoffs.  i have never bought any of them, and shan't now, so
close to retirement.

if the fonts are "morally" ok, i don't know of any particular rationale
for there being no metrics, etc. ... except it would take a fair bit of
work, and people tend not to do such things unless they have their own
need for them.

(walter schmidt used to create support files a propos of i know not
what, but he seems to have vanished below some event horizon -- i had
heard he was involved in the stix black hole, which would explain it...)

if the creators of support files don't submit them to ctan, ctan won't
offer them.  of course, mailing the tex-live list seems eccentric, since
tex-live won't hold free support files for commercial products, even.

Without looking at the fonts themselves, and looking only at
the price, I would suspect that they are clones : low-price
rip-offs from which the original type designer gets not
a single penny by way of licence fee.

See /Alphabet Stories/, by Hermann Zapf, pp.~71--74,
"Sir Francis Drake Society", which is itself taken from
the /Bulletin of the Typographers International Association/,
February 1994, Flemington (New Jersey).

   Check environment variables (Windows and your tool): run in cmd.exe and

I have attached the output from each, cmdset.txt and shset.txt,

No, I do; I can actually touch it. I also ran "attrib -r * /D /S" on
/texlive.

   > > and I still get the rcs.sty-not-found error from latex.exe.
   Always use
   prompt$ kpsewhich rcs.sty
   to check if there is such file (read: could be found by texlive).

Ok. I still get no output from "kpsewhich rcs.sty".

   You could redefine TEXMFHOME, in TEXMFMAIN/web2c/texmf.cnf.

To what? That expands to C:/TeXLive/2009/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf . I had
to remove the Windows extension binding between .cnf and Autodial to be
able to see this properly. I find

   % This used to be HOMETEXMF.
   TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf

What should I change TEXMFHOME to? How does kpathsea do tilde expansion?
For me, HOME=c:/home/jhharris . It seems a dangerous and confusing to
use tilde notation in a configuration file.

   These variables look good (expect last one: why
   'texmf-dist/doc/context/...' here?). Check your
   TEXMFMAIN/web2c/texmf.cnf

As I mentioned earlier, I set the system environment variable TEXMFDBS
to include all the directories where I found ls-R files.
C:/TeXLive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/context/manuals/reference/en/ has an ls-R
file. I will remove it from the TEXMFDBS list.

   Check if you have permissions to write to these directories. And run
   mktexlsr (or texhash) from cmd.exe.

Ok. Still no output from "kpsewhich rcs.sty".

TeXLive was installed with, and is normally used with, admin privileges.

I renamed C:/TeXLive/2009/texmf-config/ls-R (which had a "Cannot
open...to write" message) to .../ls-R.off and ran
mktexlsr. It did not create a new ls-R.

Aha! I note that, in the TEXMFDBS variable, the two "Cannot open" paths
begin with a space character. I cleaned it up and ran mktexlsr and got no
"cannot open" messages this time.

But still no kpsewhich rcs.sty output. I guess that is progress.

I think it is time to try a reinstallation. My fear here is that I
cannot be sure I have a clean machine. While troubleshooting the present
problem, I found several bits of detritus from former TeX Live
installations, including my last, 2007. There where environment
variables, directories, files. Is there a checklist for cleaning up?
I do not trust the uninstall script.


Thanks again

TEXMFDBS in cmdset.txt has two spaces between paths, as you
noticed.  You don't need to define TEXMFDBS.
It is best to use the default setting.

>    % This used to be HOMETEXMF.
>    TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf

On windows, ~ expands as $USERPROFILE, thus
$TEXMFHOME=C:/Documents and Settings/jhharris/texmf

In general, it may be a source of various errors to
try to redefine TeX related variables.

Akira

TEXMFDBS is definitely wrong. Note spaces between paths.

This might be a problem. TL'07 used to set a bunch of environment
variables, I don't have a list though. TL'09 does not set
(permanently) anything in the environment (with the exception of
PATH), so anything starting with TEX or TL does not belong to TL'09*.

    \openin does not respect the feature.
    It can be on purpose, because it is used in \IfFileExists.

Right.

    But it is not a clean way, because \openin could expect
    real data files that should be generated by mktextex or
    \pdffile(size,moddate) are used for existence tests,
    especially for graphics files (\pdfximage supports space
    in file names).

I have no theoretical counter-argument.

The practical problem is that it is expensive and ugly/verbose to call
mktextex on every (failing) \openin.  I venture to say, the result would
be unusably slow.  I didn't try it today, though.

I suppose enabling it for \openin could be a separate option from
enabling it for everything else.  That is, if there is any actual
practical need for it, which I doubt, since mktextex has been disabled
ever since I originally invented it.  I don't recall ever seeing a
request for it.


As for this hypothetical world where we try to auto-download packages a
la MiKTeX (which I don't foresee ever actually happening), I certainly
wouldn't advocate doing so on \openin.

Not necessarily.  Hermann Zapf told me that the Palatino fonts
provided by Bitstream and URW were created by him.  They couldn't be
called "Palatino" because Linotype registered the name "Palatino" as a
trademark.  Hermann Zapf is not happy with it.

There are also some fonts which were designed decades (Futura, Sabon)
or even centuries (Garamond) ago.  I think that nobody has to pay any
licence fee to the designer or his surviving dependants any more.  

But I must admit that I don't know where "Opus" comes from.

There is something wrong which even an amateur like you should be able
to notice:

  http://contrapunctus.net/league/haques/fs500tex/fs500tex.pdf

page 49, "New Baskerville".

This font is completely broken and absolutely useless.  And some of
the other fonts are broken too (awful kerning).

Yeah, the fonts are cheap, but this is not all what matters.  Fonts
which are not provided by famous font vendors are often broken or
incomplete.  Even if a font provides all glyphs required by Adobe
StandardEncoding, you can't be sure that kerning pairs are
appropriate.

I don't think that it's sufficient to simply run fontinst \latinfamily
on arbitrary fonts in order to create TFM files.  Especially if crappy
AFM files are involved.

BTW, what we need in the TeX world are high-quality fonts, not as many
fonts as possible.

  Reinhard

not to the designer.  however, we know that digitising a face involves a
lot more investment than just collecting a bag of bits, and that's what
is being protected, for many fonts.

we've heard that some fontsite fonts are very poorly set up.  is this
because fontsite regenerated outlines from a metal cut, or because they
tried to distance themselves from the existing digital font they were
aiming to resell?

Message-ID: <83e4277b0bea10859ead84dda5acee0c.squirrel@www.timothylegg.com>

Hello,

I have just installed the TexLive package on Debian because it has support
for the Cherokee syllabary in the package texlive-fonts-extra.

While I have used tex about 10 years ago for English documents, I am
trying to use it for non-English documents and finding that it doesn't
handle fonts they way I expect it to.  Apparently cutting and pasting the
unicode text into the .tex document isn't enough.  I would like to take
advantage of texlive-fonts-extra, after all, that is the reason I chose
this version of tex.  I have no idea where to find documentation for the
usage of these fonts.  Even Google has failed me with this one.

While there are a moderate number of documents regarding using CJK fonts
in TexLive, that is not what I am doing and I don't want to permanently
break my installation by experimenting with scripts/commands without
understanding their full effects.

Where should I begin so I can get started?

If somebody really wanted to push these Fontsite support files to CTAN, I would cooperate. Just make sure they work for you first with the latest CD (is it even still available?).. because even I don't use them anymore.

Most of the basic families are very usable (New Baskerville definitely an exception), but it took an enormous amount of work to tame them for TeX.. plucking glyphs out of expert sets that don't consistently obey any standard encoding, for example. And with each new edition of the CD the encodings would change!

I think some of the families are now available for separate download, and I have no idea whether these continue to work with the existing support files. It's not something I want to bother with anymore, when XeTeX and professional OTFs work so much better with way less hassle. I got the Adobe Type Classics CD and never looked back.

Indeed, that is strange. 

I have fixed that for now manually, should be out by tomorrow.

Message-ID: <f38cbe6a79a738f63b70c8675e034e30.squirrel@www.timothylegg.com>

Hello,

I have just installed the TexLive package on Debian because it has support
for the Cherokee syllabary in the package texlive-fonts-extra.

While I have used tex about 10 years ago for English documents, I am
trying to use it for non-English documents and finding that it doesn't
handle fonts they way I expect it to.  Apparently cutting and pasting the
unicode text into the .tex document isn't enough.  I would like to take
advantage of texlive-fonts-extra, after all, that is the reason I chose
TexLive.  I have no idea where to find documentation for the
usage of these fonts.  Even Google has failed me with this one.

While there are a moderate number of documents regarding using CJK fonts
in TexLive, that is not what I am doing and I don't want to permanently
break my installation by experimenting with scripts/commands without
understanding their full effects.

Where should I begin so I can get started?

I cannot say for sure what happened, but I suspect that
arabxetex.tds.zip contained the wrongly-named file when I installed the
update.  (When .tds.zip is provided, all we do is use it as-is.)  Then
later it got updated, but I failed to notice; that check is not easy to
automate.

    Karl, Manuel: Something seems to be wrong with ctan2tl, 

I doubt it.

Yes it does.

Hi Tim,

    I have no idea where to find documentation for the
    usage of these fonts.

TL can only provide the documentation which the authors themselves
provide.  So you need to be looking for documentation about the specific
TeX Live package.   "texlive-fonts-extra" is a Debian invention, an
aggregation of many TeX Live packages.

In this case, I'm guessing the relevant package is "ocherokee".  If you
run "texdoc ocherokee", you should get the short document by the author
(Apostolos Syropoulos).  Alternative, you can read it on the web.
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/ocherokee.html

    Apparently cutting and pasting the
    unicode text into the .tex document isn't enough.

I'm not sure if it's necessary, but perhaps you need to use the XeTeX
engine (e.g., run "xelatex" instead of "latex" or "pdflatex") for direct
support of Unicode Cherokee.  I have no experience with anything related
to that, so can't advise further ...

Hope this helps somehow,
Karl

if you want to know more about the history of the FontSite fonts (and
there seems to be the original (!) Palatino by Hermann Zapf included),
these may be of interest:

XeLaTeX usage is very simple, there are just a few differences. You
must not use inputenc and fontenc packages because everything is in
Unicode. Most documents will require \usepackage{fontspec} and that's
all you need. And you should read the manual of fontspec in order to
understand how to load fonts and use font features.

The document makes fascinating reading in its entirety,
Hartmut, and I thank you for drawing it to our attention.
If I were certain that the contents were accurate, I would
describe it as "absolute dynamite"; in your considered
opinion, how accurate is the document and its allegations ?

On one of computers I run texlive maintenance not as a root but as a

then ordinary users are getting errors

It is a bit of annoyance to remember to change permissions

Regarding German law, it looks very convincing.  The author goes into
great depth why fonts are not computer programs in the sense of the
copyright law ? even the hints of (most) TrueType fonts ? and can thus
be protected in Germany for at most 25 years as a `Geschmacksmuster'
only.

This is more than an annoyance, it is a leading indicator that
life as we know it is coming to an end.

You are fighting a losing battle.  Such problems don't
arise or are someone else's problem if you adhere to the
one-user-one-machine model.   This is increasingly the
the only tested configuration for new  packages.   Many
license agreements now assume the user and the person
installing the package are the same, so you could be on
the hook if some user violates the NDA clause "this
software contains proprietary technology...you agree
that any bugs will only be reported to us.. discussing
this software in a public forum is a violation of your
license." by complaining about a bug on some mail
list.

Many apps (including xetex) make use of the GPU and
assume the user has exclusive control over the
graphics hardware (e.g., to use the system font rasterizer
and fonts with anti-aliasing via openGL).   On some
configurations, Mac OS X xetex refuses to run in a
remote (ssh) terminal session.

There are ways to wrap common admin commands
in scripts using:

set -v
sudo chmod -R <tladm>:<grp> /usr/local/texlive
set +v

or sometimes a script intended to be run using sudo:

chmod -R <tladm>:<grp> /usr/local/texlive"
/usr/bin/sudo -u  <tladm>:<grp> commands...

Similar problems arise for MacTeX.  We have some users who
log in at the console, while others use terminal sessions from
Windows desktops.  If an admin user does maintenance with
the MacTeX GUI tools, ownership reverts to root and the
texlive user has to fix permissions before running command
line tools.

This is caused by the umask of the 'texlive' user, which is apparently
set to 077. If this is a user just for texlive maintenance, I suggest
changing its umask.

A legal term that non-lawyers don't know or understand anyway, so probably it's not worth translating. I guess the main point is that fonts can be protected for at most 25 years.

Ha, it's even untranslated in the English Wikipedia:

  Under German law, the Geschmacksmuster ("aesthetic model") is a form
  of intellectual property that extends industrial design rights over
  the visual design of objects that is not purely utilitarian.  The
  term of a Geschmacksmuster is twenty years, compared to twenty-five
  years for a community design.

And `community design' (which has the nice German name
`Gemeinschaftsgeschmacksmuster') is quite similar but newer.  So with
25?years you are on the safe side.

If the tool in question is TeX Live Utility, I'd like to know how it's causing you problems with permissions.  AFAIK MacTeX isn't relocatable, and will always end up installed as root.  If you change permissions, authorization shouldn't be required if the user running TLU has write permission to `kpsewhich -var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT` (and so permissions wouldn't be reset).

I still have the zip file that I uploaded to CTAN. The file was named 
correctly. However the path in the tds.zip was incorrect (it was under 
tex/xelatex/ instead of tex/xelatex/arabxetex/) and Karl fixed it after 
informing me. Probably he introduced the typo when he corrected the path 
inside the tds.zip. No offense taken, it would not have happened if I 
had provided a correct tds.zip in the first place :)

Good to know that this is settled, it is anyway fixed already.

It is not TeXLive utility (as it is on linux). In fact on Mac I always
maintain TL via sudo (as a root) and never had such problems

I changed umask to 022

The problem on Mac comes when you have multiple users.  User A
is at the console doing some big job with a GUI application, user B
logs in via ssh and needs some change.    TeX Live is too complex
to be trusted, so we want to avoid doing TL admin as root.   Also,
one of the points of sudo on multi-user systems is that you can
go the logs and figure out who and when the command that broke
something was run.  If every package needs sudo for all admin,
then sudo becomes pointless.

If we keep TL under a normal user ownership, console users with
admin rights can still do TL admin as on a personal Mac, we just have
to revert ownership (using sudo) before doing tladmin.  Running one
"chown" is a small fraction of the potential for damage that you could
get from a bug or intentional hack in one of the many TL admin tools.

This is NOT  problem I experienced on Mac but ?? linux. On Macs where
I run tlmgr as a root this problem NEVER occurred.

That makes sense, but who or what is changing the ownership such that you have to use chown?

Hi Markus, Reinhard,

    At de.po, line 574 you should change "SIe haben keine Berechtigung" into "Sie 
    haben keine Berechtigung".

Thanks.

    -"Bitte starten Sie dieses Programm als Administrator, oder kontaktieren Sie "
    -"den lokalen Administrator.\n"
    +"Bitte starten Sie dieses Programm als Administrator, oder kontaktieren Sie den lokalen Administrator.\n"

And these string should be combined into one line?  (I did that, just
wanted to be sure it was intentional.)

    In the same line: s/Installations/Installation/

Did that.

Hope I didn't mess up the file ...

Thanks,
k

We pushed out a new version of tlmgr today.  The most notable change is
that "persistent" http (1.1) connections are used by default.  It
automatically falls back to the previous one-at-a-time connections if
the persistent stuff fails.  Hopefully this will speed downloads.

We've also started to maintain a list of high-level changes in the
updates of tlmgr, at http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr-news.html (linked from

"tlmgr --help" gives a brief description of the backups:

           "tlmgr" always makes a temporary backup when updating packages, in
           case of download or other failure during an update.  In contrast,
           the purpose of this "--backup" option is to allow you to save a
           persistent backup in case the actual content of the update causes
           problems, e.g., introduces an incompatibility.

           The "restore" action explains how to restore from a backup.

My guess is that tlmgr is not able to find files that should be installed.
I think this sometimes happens when packages are reorganized, so the
locations in the new package differ from the current install, but since
I have arabxetex 17470  (Ubuntu 9.1, both amd64 and i686 linux ) and
have not seen the backup problem there may have been something
amiss with your configuration.


Some additional information might be helpful:

Does TL work for your documents after the updates?

what platform are you using?

how did you install TeX Live? (e.g., linux distro, install CTAN, etc.)?
  did you use the option to create links to the binaries in /usr/local/bin?

have you used tlmgr successfully in the past?

what is the version of tlmgr?

do you use a root account or some normal user account for TL administration?

is this a routine update or are you trying to recover from some problem?

 I have Ubuntu 9.10 on two machines here, but with some minor
differences:

1) the 32-bit machine is updated from the SVN repository

2) I use a regular user account to administer CTAN TL (the systems
also have debian TL2009 test version).

3) I did not create symbolic links

Have you tried another update/install to check if things are working now?

Do you have (non-admin) users working in SSH sessions wanting to run tlmgr?

Both me and user texlive (my alter ego) are not admin and texlive is
running tlmgr to update

There is no reason why anyone should not be able to run tlmgr in the read mode

So far after changing umask of user texlive  I have not observed
irregular behaviour

If a user (probably has to be one with admin privs, but that is
normally the "owner" of the system)
does an update with the MacTeX GUI the permissions revert to ownership
by root (as will most
Apps).    We have a small number of Macs, each dedicated more or less
to a particular data set,
with most user needing access to the other Macs using ssh terminal
sessions to work with data
using Fortran and generate documents from the data using LaTeX as they
have done for years
using unix.

Thanks for clarifying! Just to be sure, the "owner" does not have write privs to /usr/local/texlive?  I assume "the MacTeX GUI" is TeX Live Utility, so I'd like to improve this if possible (I wrote it).

If you were to create a group that had write privs to /usr/local/texlive and added the ssh and console users to that group, TLU would not ask for admin rights, and wouldn't be running tlmgr as root.  Consequently, you shouldn't have to do this chown dance.

Another possible solution would be to add a preference setting to TLU to use a specific owner and group.  I think I could do this by reading owner/group of the directory at `kpsewhich -var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT` and calling setuid() appropriately, if you checked a box for "Run as install directory owner" or something.  Other suggestions are welcome.

Subject: [tex-live] removing PCL font metrics from TL
Message-ID: <201003212335.o2LNZL2a023479@f7.net>

TL includes metrics for the fonts that were built into the LaserJet at
some point.  As I recall, I created the metrics based on files from Norm
Walsh when I first bought an LJ many years ago, and other people wrote
LaTeX support, etc. to make them usable -- the pclnfss package.

But there no (free-for-TL) outlines for them, so I don't think it's very
useful to have the metrics for them in TL -- documents using them can't
be previewed.  I also highly doubt the metrics generated 15 years ago
are up to date.  Plus potential licensing questions.

Thus, I plan to remove pclnfss, which includes the metrics for:
bh: wingding/ 
cg: albertus/  clarendo/  courier/   lettrgth/  optima/  univers/
    atqolive/  coronet/   garamond/  marigold/  times/
monotype: helvetic/  symbol/  timesnew/

(This won't affect the PostScript/Adobe or other times, symbol,
etc. fonts.  Just PCL.)

I hope this doesn't unduly discommode anyone, but I see no option, for
our own self-consistency.

It was intentional (and automaticly done by emacs' po mode while editing the 
string) but it changes nothing in the result of the usage of the string.

They are supposed to change passwords every 3-4 months, but that is

Hi,

I know it's far away and it's probably too early to say, but is there
a chance that TeX Live 2010 will include biber? If not, is it because
of complicated dependancies or is it some other reason?

The owner gets write privs to everything by virtue of being an
administrator.   The ssh users are generally not
in the admin group.

Mac TeX has a different GUI that runs tlmgr in non-gui mode.

We could easily put the owner in "tladmin" group with write privs on
/usr/local/texlive, but currently MacTeX uses a
"TeX Live Utility.app" that prompts for an admin login and then runs
tlmgr as root.   The Apple GUI apps aren't
available in ssh terminal sessions.

On most Apple systems "tlmgr --gui" won't run due to problems with the
perl-tk library:

gwhite@<apple1>:~$ tlmgr --gui

Cannot load Tk, thus the GUI cannot be started!
The Perl/Tk module is not shipped with the TeX Live installation.
You have to install it to get tlmgr GUI running. See
http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html for more details.

Tried that -- once upon a time it actually worked, but after a few updates:

gwhite@<apple2>:~$ tlmgr --gui
no event type or button # or keysym at
/Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/Tk/Widget.pm line 1105.
 at /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl line 222
Compilation failed in require at /usr/texbin/tlmgr line 3126.


On Apple the "TeX Live Utility.app" also creates links in "system"
directories.  This allows the admin to switch
the default TeX distro:

gwhite@<apple>:~$ which tex
/usr/texbin/tex
gwhite@<apple>:~$ ls -l /usr/texbin
8 lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  63 Nov 19 15:03 /usr/texbin@ ->

MacTeX is more like using a linux distro install of TL that follows
distro-specific conventions, but
with the difference that tlmgr is still being used.

Hi,

Today I installed the newest pgf package (pgf 2.0) on my texlive 2009
by unpacking the tarball into the text-local directory followed by a
texhash.   Then I found pdflatex on any beamer presentation will fail
with an error:

Did anyone meet the same problem?  Thanks.

I know?as I said, I wrote that app (hereafter TLU).  If the user running TLU can write to the dir at `kpsewhich -var-value=SELFAUTOPARENT` without root authorization, TLU should /not/ prompt for admin rights.  If it does, there's a bug that I need to fix.  

Since you're using groups already, if you add the owner to the tladmin group, your problem should be solved.  I may add another workaround for this particular situation in future.

No, the MacTeX installer package does this, and it also installs the system prefpane.  TLU does not do this, which is the reason net install isn't enabled in it.

Whilst TL-2009 seems to allow me to specify
many things at installation time, such as
the location of TEXDIR, TEXMFLOCAL, TEXMFSYSVAR,
TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFHOME, the one thing
it doesn't seem willing to allow me to specify
is the location for whatever name is actually
instantiated to $TEXDIR/texmf-dist.  Obviously
I can relocate this after installation, but then
things will almost certainly break : what else
must I change if I would like those files currently
under $TEXDIR/texmf-dist to actually be under
$TEXDIR/texmf/dist, by analogy with all the other
locations which I have specified as
	
	$TEXDIR/texmf/local
	$TEXDIR/texmf/var
	$TEXDIR/texmf/config
	$TEXDIR/texmf/home

Message-ID: <daef5be81003231141w44a5196g73ad50414f0a3f20@mail.gmail.com>

How do I restore the backup/snapshot taken before an update? Consider
the following seq:

tlmgr backup --clean=3 --backupdir $SOMEDIR --all
tlmgr update --self
tlmgr update --all

Now, reading the manual:

restore --backupdir dir  [pkg [rev]]
Restore a package from a previously-made backup.
If neither pkg nor rev are given, list the available backup revisions
for all packages.
With pkg given but no rev, list all available backup revisions of pkg.
With both pkg and rev, tries to restore the package from the specified backup

If I understand correctly, one can restore only individual packages
and not the entire snapshot? Well, I could create separate backupdir
for each snapshot and then restore from there. Is that the right way?

Not supported. You can relocate it by hand, but that will break updates.

Allowing this to be configurable makes updates over the network
quasi impossible.

You have to adapt paths in texmf.cnf .

But I strongly recommend not to do so.  The paths set by TeX Live are
very reasonable.

   ..../texlive/2007 
   ..../texlive/2008 
   ..../texlive/2009
   ..../texlive/texmf-local 

texmf-local is located outside the main TeX Live trees deliberately
because otherwise it would be more difficult to remove a distribution
_and_ preserve your personal files.

And TEXMFHOME should be in %USERPROFILE% unless you are the only
user.

I don't know what you want to achive.  I suppose that you have
consistency in mind.  But there are many reasons why the TeX Live
directory structure is as it is.  

Are there any technical reasons for your changes or do you change the
directory structure only because it looks more consistent then?
I fear that you invest a lot of time but there is no real benefit.
You just make your system harder to maintain.

I strongly recommend to leave the directory structure proposed by TeX
Live as it is unless you want to achieve something special.

BTW, *never* change texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf because when you update your
system it can happen that your changes get lost.  Instead, add your
local changes to texmf/../texmf.cnf if they are really necessary.

  Reinhard

It would be nice if it could be configurable in a future release.

Incidentally, having just completed a virgin install from DVD,
I notice that unlike many other packages, it doesn't immediately
go off to see if there are updates available; do you think it
might be worthwhile adding this feature for TL-2010 ?

Well, as Norbert said, it would force to make drastical changes to the logic of
tlmgr. Unless there is a very good technical reason (as opposed to a matter of
personnal taste) to allow this, I doubt we want to do it (an even with a good
reason, I'm not sure we want to try).

I have no strong opinion on that point. If you installed from the network, there
won't be any update anyway.

Passing over my earlier "Installation flexibility

PS_View has installed itself, and taken over the WinEDT
hooks for viewing PDF documents.  There is nothing under
Add/Remove Programs to throw out the (unwanted) PS_View,
nor can I find anything in TL Manager to allow me to
remove it.  How, please, can I get rid of PS_View and
return to using Adobe Acrobat as my sole interface for

I guess the problem is not actually PS_View being installed, but rather that the
PDF files are now associated with it. I seem to remember there is an option
about that in the installer (even in wizard mode). Anyway, you can undo the
associations with

tlmgr postinstall remove fileassoc tlpsv.win32

Alternatively, of course you can just plain remove PS_view using tlmgr, either
in GUI mode or in command line mode:

tlmgr remove --force tlpsv

hth,
Manuel.

Thank you, Manuel.  Unfortunately option (2) "[Y]ou can just plain remove
PS_view using tlmgr [...] in GUI mode" does not seem possible, and I have
deliberately not tried the other two so as to be able to help you identify
the problem with (2).  Under TeX Live Manager 2009, tab "Remove",
I see nothing between "tlc2" and "tocbind", whilst strict alpha
order would suggest that "tlpsv" should lie between.  Furthermore,
there is no instance of "psv" at its natural location (between
"psutils" and "ptptex") [I checked just in case the "tl" was an
error in your original suggestion].  Finally, TeXdoc fails to
throw up any information for any of :

	TeXdoc PS_View
	TeXdoc psv
	TeXdoc tlpsv

Hi... I'm using bibtex from TeXLive 2007, which is what MacPorts gave
me (sigh).  bibtex does not respect the --min-crossrefs command-line
argument, although it is documented in the manpage.

I looked at the "noteworthy changes" and updates pages for 2008 and
2009 and didn't see this bug mentioned... either it wasn't fixed or it
wasn't noteworthy ;-).  Can you tell me if it's been fixed in a more
recent version than I have?

I think you'll have find the MacPorts people responsible to pursue this.
--min-crossrefs has been supported in Unix TeX's BibTeX for a long time,
and has never been removed.

Or you could install our "original" TL (tug.org/texlive/acquire.html).
It won't interfere with MacPorts or any other system TeX.

When I do

but if I do

texdoc beamer, I get exampleClass.pdf from doc/latex/beamer-FUBerlin

wouldn't it be an idea to let beamer be a texdoc alias for 
beameruserguide.pdf, I think that would be a bit more help full to users.

BTW: this texdoc aliasing we have in TL, makes TL texdoc a lot better 
than texdoc on miktex, much more handy for users.

It sure would. There used to be an alias, then I removed it after some change in
the texdoc logic that made beameruserguide be "naturally" the first result, and
since the last big update of texdoc, it changed again and I didn't check.

I just re-installed the alias for the time being, and I'll investigate later why
it's needed again (cause it shouldn't). Thanks for reporting.

I think there may be a small problem with some of the .fd files included in the folder

${TEXMFDIST}/tex/latex/ly1

The following four files all refer to fonts by their Adobe file names, not their Berry names, making them incompatible with other TeXLive files:

ly1pag.fd (AvantGarde, refers to Adobe font agw)
ly1pbk.fd (Bookman, refers to Adobe font bkl)
ly1pnc.fd (Schoolbook, refers to non-existent TeX font nbr)
ly1ppl.fd (Palatino, refers to Adobe font por)

These seem to be quite old files, dating from 1995. There are updated versions in the psnfssx package on ctan, but not installed in TeXLive.

Message-ID: <803fcee31003251839r3b11f9bejde8e1635b092126e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All (just new to the list, plannign to stay ;) ),

I have been posting about this issue on the XeTeX list already, but
for further follow-up, this list seems more appropriate. Quick recap
and problem statement, the solution I got to is below. I am wondering
if there is any better solution as it does not seem fully
satisfactory.

Just two days ago I moved from miktex to texlive 2009 (fresh install,
fully updated). I was having trouble with XeTeX not detecting the
opentype fonts i put in $TEXMFLOCAL
(C:\texlive\texmf-local\fonts\opentype and underlying folders). I ran
fc-cache on that folder with the --verbose switch. The first time i
run it, it tells me it is caching the fonts in all the subdirectories,
the second time it tells me it is skipping them as they are already in
the cache, so that seems to have worked correctly. However, when I run
"fc-list > fc.log" and search in that log file (no grep on windows
for as far as i know) I find no references to the fonts that were just
cached.

I'd like to keep my fonts in $TEXMFLOCAL so they stay with updates and
I do not want to install them into the windows fonts directory, don't
want to put too much in there.

A working solution is this:
I came accross this thread:
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2008-November/019261.html

Solution:
Based on comments in the texmf.cnf file, I edited the texmf.cnf in
texlive/2009, where you should add your local changes only.
first I tried adding my opentype fonts folder to a promising looking
key, but that didn't work:
OPENTYPEFONTS =
.;$TEXMF/fonts/opentype//;$OSFONTDIR//;$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/opentype
Then, I followed the suggestions in the thread and got things to work:
(1) add to texlive/2009/texmf.cnf:
   FONTCONFIG_PATH=$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf
   FC_CACHEDIR=$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/cache
(2) create the directories:
   $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf
   $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/cache
(3) copy everything in $TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf/
   to $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf/ and then edit the
   file $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/conf/fonts.conf to include
   the line <dir>C:/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/opentype</dir>

I am not sure this is the best way to go about it, I don't really like
having a full local copy of fonts.conf, overriding a possibly updated
$TEXMFSYSVAR/fonts/conf/fonts.conf. I would just like to add that one
directory to it. I am wondering if there is a way analogous to having
a updmap-local.cfg where you only specify your local changes/addition
to updmap.cfg, but then for fonts.conf?

Best and thanks!

Don't do the above.
Confirm that there is a directory
C:/texlive/2009/texmf-var/fonts/conf/conf.d.
And add a file
C:/texlive/2009/texmf-var/fonts/conf/local.conf
with the following contents:


<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
<!--

<dir>c:/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/opentype</dir>

Hi Akira,

Lets continue this discussion on this list, I'll post back to the
XeTeX list when we've got it working.

Yup, its there, with a whle bunch of .conf files in it.

I've just tried that, but it seems it does not work.
I've first reverted the changes I made, described in my previous post.
I then followed your steps, ran fc-cache, mktexlsr and texhash (all of
them twice (1 2 3 1 2 3) to be sure).
The fonts are however not found by XeTeX or fc-list.

Also, shouldn't the local.conf file be in the $TEXMFLOCAL tree? (Tried
it, doesn't work as well.)

Best,
Dee

Is there a file 51-local.conf with the following contents?

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
	<!-- Load local system customization file -->
	<include ignore_missing="yes">local.conf</include>
</fontconfig>


> Also, shouldn't the local.conf file be in the $TEXMFLOCAL tree?

No it should be in $FONTCONFIG_PATH, and $FONTCONFIG_PATH should
be unique.

Try fc-cache -v
then various directories are displayed in the process.

Best,
Akira

Hi Akira,

The 51-local.conf with the right contents is indeed found.

2010/3/26 Akira Kakuto <kakuto at fuk.kindai.ac.jp>:

Interesting, it said it cannot find the path. So I copied in the path
from windows explorer and changed all slashes to forward slashes
(these we're visually exactly the same, i compared them side-by-side)
and now things work!

Great, thank you for providing the solution.

Best,
Dee

If it does not work in your case by some reason
that I cannot understand,
simply add a line
<dir>c:/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/opentype</dir>
after the line
<dir>c:/windows/fonts</dir>
in
C:/texlive/2009/texmf-var/fonts/conf/fonts.conf

You can install MSYS

  http://www.mingw.org

which provides a Unix-like environment under Windows.  It's not as
Unix-like as Cygwin, but it provides grep and many other Unix tools,
at least.

I also found:

  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm

I don't have Windows and thus can't test it myself.  But what they say
on their web page sounds quite reasonable.

As you have MacPorts, that means you're using a Mac, in which case I would advise you to install the especial TeXLive distro for the Mac:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/

It *is* TeXLive with some very convenient additions ---first and foremost, the ``TeX Distribution'' control panel ---courtesy of Gerben Wierda and Jerome Laurens---, which detects which TeX distributions you have installed and allows you to shift from one to another with a simple click; see

http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/multipletexdistributions.html

read specially the last paragraph, which deals with Fink and MacPorts distros.

MacTeX also comes with some useful applications, like ``TeX Live Utility'', a front-end to TeXLive Manager (tlmgr) to update your TeXLive distribution.

Ah! And it also sets the proper path automatically.

Best,

Axel

Message-ID: <C91E5143-5C79-4A43-A990-8275BA7959B4@gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I seem to experience a bug in the current texlive distribution. I reduced it to the following short testcase:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\pdfgentounicode=1
\begin{document}
$\nabla$
\end{document}


When this document is compiled, pdflatex errors out saying:

pdfTeX warning: pdflatex: No flags specified for non-embedded font `Times-Roman' (ptmr8r) (I'm using 34): fix your map entry.
pdfTeX warning: pdflatex: No flags specified for non-embedded font `Symbol' (psyr) (I'm using 4): fix your map entry.
../../../texk/web2c/pdftexdir/writefont.c:536: failed assertion `fo->fd->builtin_glyph_names != NULL'


>From my reading of the archives, it appears that the two warnings are unrelated, known issues in the pdftex core. The last one, however, causes pdflatex to stop compiling and fails to produce a document.

All three elements are needed to produce this: the mathptmx package, using pdfgentounicode and including the \nabla symbol. I don't know which one is behaving unexpectedly, causing the core to error out.


I hope someone can shed some light into this, or even fix it.

Best regards,

Dear Manuel --

OK, I have worked around it for now by changing the associations
for PDF files within Windows Explorer, but my real concerns are
as follows :

1) From "Start TL Installer (Advanced)", I see nothing on the
main "Install-TL" window that suggests that the system is
going to interfere with a pre-installed Adobe Acrobat :
there is no mention of PS_view, and under "Change file
assocations", "Only new" is pre-selected, yet somehow the
TL Installer ignored my previous association with Adobe
Acrobat 7 and replaced it with PS_view.

2) There is no obvious uninstall route for PS_view,
as reported in the previous message in this thread.

3) It was not possible to revert to the previous Adobe
Acrobat settings because they had been irrevocably
discarded.  I would have to install Adobe Acrobat for
a second time in order to be sure that the settings were
as Adobe intended and as they had originally been.

I do not think that installing TeX Live should interfere
with pre-existing non-TeX installations.  As an absolute
minimum, the TeX Live installer should issue a very clear
warning such as "The current association for PDF files is
Adobe Acrobat 7.  TeX Live would like to replace this with
PS_view.  Permit this ?  [Y/N], with "N" pre-selected.

Which revision of the installer was used? There was a bug fix related
to this (rev. 16316 from 2009/12/06). When installing as a nornal
users, the system wide associations (in HKLM hive) were not respected.
Did you try Manuel's advice (tlmgr postinstall remove fileassoc
tlpsv.win32)? This should help in this case.

I don't see any arch type packages in the gui, so I suspect Nortbert
filters them to reduce the clutter (in which case tlpsv.win32 would be
hidden since there is no corresponding tlpsv package). Norbert, am I
right?

They may be still there in the the HKLM registry hive, but simply
overridden by the ones in HKCU (if you installed Acrobat as admin and
TL as non-admin).

It shouldn't and if it does, then we have a bug, but please check with
the current installer before making conclusions.

Not completely. 

It is true for the GUIv1 (gui-old), but it is fixed in GUIv2 (tlmgr gui),
where these packages are shown (those without mother packages).

	tlmgr gui
and remove the package. With gui-old you will not see it.
Or you use the command line.

FWIW, TeX Live Utility doesn't require installing via MacTeX; you can also
use the standard UNIX installer.  It does require TL 2008 or later, so
wouldn't be useful with the macports install of the OP.

I renamed it tlu_ipctask, so this confusion should be cleared up whenever I
get around to a new release.

You right (of course), tlpsv.win32 is there. Philip probably uses the
old stuff, which would explain all the problems.

Yes, sorry, although I mentioned a virgin install from DVD in passing :

> Incidentally, having just completed a virgin install from DVD

I perhaps didn't make it as plain as I should have done that
these issues all arose after installing from the TeX Collection
2009 DVD.

In the light of very helpful comments from Tomek et al,
pointing out that the new installer is better in several
respects than the one shipped with the DVD, may I now
re-iterate a point I made earlier, with a slight twist ?

> Incidentally, having just completed a virgin install from DVD,
> I notice that unlike many other packages, it doesn't immediately
> go off to see if there are updates available; do you think it
> might be worthwhile adding this feature for TL-2010 ?

Even before getting this far, would it not be a good idea
(and certainly consistent with the user interface of
"better" Windows software), if the installer supplied
on the DVD first went out to the network (where possible)
and looked to see if a more recent version is available,
and if so, propose to the user that it be permitted to
fetch the new installer and then transfer control to it ?

Clearly installing from DVD will be the preferred option
for anyone in possession of such a thing, but if the
installer were more clever, and capable of both checking
for a new version of itself (pre-install) and then checking
for new versions of packages (post-install), the whole user
experience could be much improved.

These are clearly proposals for TL 2010, but for those
(like myself) who have now received their TeX Collection
2009 DVD and who wish to use it as the basis for local TL
installs, what is the recommended way of getting the most
up-to-date installer (of production strength, rather than
an alpha- or beta-test version) and then using it in
conjunction with the DVD for an initial install, followed
by an update from the web ?

Yes, programmers wanted. All of that is not a problem to implement,
time is the limiting factor.

THROCKING (participial vb.)
The action of continually pushing down the lever on a pop-up toaster
in the hope that you will thereby get it to understand that you want
it to toast something. Also: a style of drum-playing favoured by Nigel
Olsson of the Elton John Band, reminiscent of the sound of someone
slapping a frankfurter against a bucket. An excellent example of this
is to be heard on 'Someone Save My Life Tonight' from the album
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.

I did in fact already try

	Install-TL[-Advanced] --repository Y:\TeXLive\TLpkg

but when that didn't work either, I sent off the message

Howdy,

Well, I forgot to paste in the message...

What does

which pdflatex

return? Do you have more than one TeX Distribution on your system? If so, what does the System Preferences->TeX Distribution Preference Pane show is the active distribution?

Good Luck,

Hi Michael,

    ly1pag.fd (AvantGarde, refers to Adobe font agw)
    ly1pbk.fd (Bookman, refers to Adobe font bkl)
    ly1pnc.fd (Schoolbook, refers to non-existent TeX font nbr)
    ly1ppl.fd (Palatino, refers to Adobe font por)

Thanks much for the report.

    There are updated versions in the psnfssx package on ctan, 

Where do you see them?  In ctan:macros/latex/contrib/psnfssx/ly1, there is a
zip file ly1-min.zip, but it only contains ly1{pcr,phv,ptm}.fd, as far
as .fd files go.  I couldn't find ly1pag.fd (or the others) anywhere
else.

Unless I'm just missing them, I guess I'll try to update those files and
get them on CTAN.  And maybe clean up one little piece of the font mess
in the process.

Thanks,
k

The lua_altopt module installed under texmf-dist/scripts/ is not seen by
kpse, and since luatex's "require()" use kpse to find files, I can't
require the texlive installed module.

If this is the expected behaviour, then we either need to special case
lua modules (e.g. have a searchable scripts/lua/ subdir) or move lua
modules somewhere else.

Please try this:

  kpse.set_program_name('texlua')
  dofile(kpse.find_file('lua_altopt.lua'))

AFAIK require() expects a name without an extension but kpathsea needs
the full name, of course.  Thus, you could also try 

  kpse.set_program_name('texlua')
  require(string.gsub(kpse.find_file('lua_altopt.lua'),'.lua$',''))

but using dofile() looks more straightforward to me.

I assume that you got lua_altopt.lua by running tlmgr update,
otherwise you shouldn't forget to run texhash.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

This statement is too imprecise to be true. Kpse will or will not see the file
depending on the options you pass to it.

Currently LUAINPUTS is .;$TEXMF/scripts/{$progname,$engine,}/lua//;$TEXINPUTS
which means that with format = 'lua' (and I guess this is what require() is
using), lua scripts in texmfscripts will be found only if their path contains a
directory named lua. (By the way, we may remove this restriction in the near
future.)

So I'd recommend to follow Reinhard's advice: locate the script using kpse an
load it using dofile(). More precisely,

local f = kpse.find_file('lua_altgetopt.lua', 'lua')
    or kpse.find_file('lua_altgetopt.lua', 'texmfscripts')
dofile(assert(f, 'lua_altgetopt not found'))

should do the trick.

I agree that it is suboptimal, and we'll see to fix this one way or another
(either by changing LUAINPUTS or by installing the files in a lua subdirectory)
soon.

Manuel.

I re-installed PS_View (some CTAN ftp servers were refusing anonymous
connections : security lockdown ?), and agree that all that seems
to be available is a compiled HELP file from which one can generate
single pages of PDF but not a composite linked document.  It might be
worth asking the two Ps if they can offer it in linked PDF format.

But a related question : why, as far as TL Manager is concerned,
is it called "tlpsv" ?  Surely (a) it isn't specifically TeX-Live
(hence why "tl" prefix), and (b) it presents itself as PS_View, so
if a user (such as myself) wants to remove (uninstall) it, finding
it in the list of installed components is extraordinarily difficult
(who would think to look for "tlpsv" without prior knowledge ?).

That was my naive observation, I don't claim any understanding of how
kpse path search work.

Using texmfscripts as format does work, so I guess we should install
require'able lua scripts under scripts/lua/ (I just tested it).

Neither worked (the actual filename is alt_getopt.lua, but it doesn't
make difference).

My recommendation is not to make any change to the location of the files right
now, since we may change the search path in the near future. As soon as this is
settled, I'll let you know what the preferred placement for the files (and
searching/loading method) is.

The search algorithm for require can be extended, see
luatex-loader.sty/oberdiek.luatex.lua:

-- oberdiek.luatex.lua
module("oberdiek.luatex", package.seeall)
function kpse_module_loader(module)
  local script = module .. ".lua"
  local file = kpse.find_file(script, "texmfscripts")
  if file then
    local loader, error = loadfile(file)
    if loader then
      texio.write_nl("(" .. file .. ")")
      return loader
    end
    return "\n\t[oberdiek.luatex.kpse_module_loader] Loading error:\n\t"
           .. error
  end
  return "\n\t[oberdiek.luatex.kpse_module_loader] Search failed"
end
table.insert(package.loaders, kpse_module_loader)
-- end of file

However I haven't solved the problem with submodules yet.

As long as plain require() does work, I'm fine. Having to deal with
locating files myself kills the whole idea of making require() use kpse.

since you quote no date or time, it's not really possible to investigate
this.  i know of no reason (other than overload) that any of the ctan

It is quite common for ftp servers to limit the number of connections
and also to limit the number of connections from the same client in
a short period of time.   At work there is a firewall with a limited
number of external IP addresses, so it is quite possible for several
users to end up connecting via the same IP.

There are ways to combine many pdf's into one using pdflatex or
context MkII, but I have only done this when producing hard copy, so
I'm not sure how hyperlinks between PDF's would work.

It's sometimes helpful to try this link:

  http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/

I occasionally encountered temporary ploblems with name servers,
especially with that of my ISP.  And sometimes Firefox claims that a
server is down or doesn't exist at all while wget can access it.
Don't know why.

It's often helpful to run wget from the command line and try to
download a tiny file.  wget provides useful diagnostic messages:

  $ wget ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/timestamp
  --2010-03-29 21:43:20--  ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/timestamp
             => `timestamp'
  Resolving ftp.tex.ac.uk... 128.232.104.10
  Connecting to ftp.tex.ac.uk|128.232.104.10|:21... connected.
  Logging in as anonymous ... Logged in!
  [...]

Thus, under Windows it makes sense to copy tlpkg/installer/wget/wget.exe
to a directory which is in %PATH%.

As far as shutdown periods due to maintenance of CTAN nodes are
concerned, I vaguely remember that they are announced in advance on
mailing lists.  And it's extremely unlikely that two nodes are down at
the same time.  My impression is that CTAN is extremely reliable.

  Reinhard

Howdy,

Using tlmgr (via TeX Live Utility on Mac) this morning I continuously get collection-langturkmen should be forcibly removed. Sounds like something is wrong in the database?

Definitely looks fishy as

% tlmgr show turkmen
returns
.....
collection:  collection-langturkmen

and
% tlmgr show collection-langturkmen

returns

....
installed:   No

So there are at least two orphaned packages (I use CL tlmgr)

There used to be a problem in the way tlmgr computed dependencies when new
collections are added. Norbert fixed it yesterday, so it should work with
today's tlmgr. Please get tlmgr 17611 from an up-to-date mirror, try again and
report back.

No, it was a bug in tlmgr that I have found the same way as you, and
have fixed yesterday.

But now it is too late for you, simply do
	tlmgr install collection-langturkmen
and all is fine again.

No that is too late now, all those having done the update with the
old tlmgr are now in the situation that that langturkmen will appear
forcibly removed. That cannot be changed anymore. People should install
it by hand, or with tlmgr update --install-forcibly-removed

I just found out that tlpkg/tlpsv/psv_help_en.htb is actually a ZIP
file containing HTML stuff.  You can add the extension ".zip" to the
filename and extract the content in an empty directory.

Though I prefer PDF too, I doubt whether the HTML stuff can be
converted to PDF without much effort.  But what you can ask the two
Piotrs is to provide the *uncompressed* HTML files in a separate
directory and adapt the software accordingly.  Then texdoc could
provide an alias for "psv_help_en_contents.html".

Do you plan to attend BT-2010?  It's easier to discuss it with the
authors there than by email.  I intend to come too, but I have to work
quite hard in order to convince my physician that I can be released
from the rehab center before TL-2010.  My last appearance was not very
impressive.  I don't need crutches anymore but I still can't walk
fluently.

This version is indeed TeX Live specific because it has to find the
hidden Ghostscript somehow.  It won't work without TeX Live.

Sure, "psview" would be a better name for the package.  But I don't
know whether it's possible to change the name of the package easily.
I suppose that changing the name means that "tlmgr update" removes
"tlpsv" and downloads and installs "psview".  

On the other hand, I think that if such expensive changes are
considered, they should be done as soon as possible, at least before
Windows users recognize that TeX Live is better than MikTeX.  Just in
order to reduce network traffic... :)

  Reinhard

The PS files are generated using TeX, so it should be no big deal to generate a
linked PDF from these sources.

Also, we'd need to install the files under texmf/doc, since texdoc won't find
them in tlpkg/tlpsv anyway. I'm not sure if this would be a problem (due to the
particular nature of this package).

Anyway, someone has to discuss this with the authors, either by email or in
person at BT.

Hi all!

as a part of an attept to finally include TeX Live 2010 in Fedora I
needed to do a font audit in the whole TeX Live repository using
repo-font-audit utility. I'm sending a final report to you what
oddnesses were found. Some of them could be fixed on packaging level,
but I thought that things like font duplication or fontlint warnings
could be usable for you as well.

The summary is pretty descriptive and it is done in today's state of
the TeX Live repository. I hope it helps.

Thanks,
Jindrich

Test explanation:

t1. Error: fonts deployed outside /usr/share/fonts

  ? Packager task
  
  The standard location for font files is under the /usr/share/fonts root
  (default fontconfig setting). Please simplify the work of font utilities
  and use it exclusively. It is always possible to symlink font files
  somewhere else on the file-system if an application requires it.
  
  If you fear exposing your font files in fontconfig will cause problems,
  please work with the fontconfig maintainers to resolve them.
  
t2. Error: fonts in packages that do not declare font metadata

  ? Packager task
  
  Font-specific rpm metadata is required for automatic font installation to
  work. If you apply our font packaging templates, it will be generated at
  package creation time.
  
t3. Error: packages that mix different font families

  ? Packager task
  
  Reliable font auto-installation requires shipping only one font family per
  font package.
  
  (If you've remapped some font names at the fontconfig level your package
  may appear here pending some fontconfig fixes upstream is aware of).
  
t4. Error: exact font duplication

  ? Packager task, eventual upstream task
  
  Several packages duplicate font files with the same checksum. This
  needlessly wastes resources infrastructure and user side  and makes font
  maintenance problematic.
  
  A repository should always include only one version of a font file.
  
  This test can not discriminate between packages and identity the correct
  owner of the font files. His maintainer will be blamed with others. If
  you're not him it is therefore unfriendly not to fix this error as soon as
  you can.
  
  It is always possible to reuse a font file packaged separately by adding a
  dependency on the other package providing it, and accessing the font
  through fontconfig.
  
  If an application can not use fontconfig today this is a serious bug that
  should be reported to the application upstream. Please ask it to add
  fontconfig support to their code (usually, via a higher-level library
  such as pango-cairo). However it can workarounded by the packager with
  symlinks (that will need maintenance).
  
t5. Error: font faces duplicated by different packages

  ? Packager task, eventual upstream task
  
  Several packages duplicate font files with the same face name. This
  needlessly wastes resources infrastructure and user side and makes font
  maintenance problematic:
  
  1. Very often an upstream that copied some fonts will forget to keep them
  up to date, and the duplication will result in the distribution of old
  buggy data.
  
  2. Shipping the same font in different formats is also problematic:
  different font formats have different features, and are processed by
  different font libraries. It is almost impossible to create a font in
  multiple formats that will all behave the same. Users hate fonts that do
  not behave consistently everywhere.
  
  3. Most of our applications use fontconfig to access fonts, and fontconfig
  uses font names to identify files. Naming collisions make font selection
  unreliable. So even genuine forks with different features from the
  original are a problem if not renamed.
  
  A repository should always include only one version of a font face.
  
  This test can not discriminate between packages and identity the correct
  owner of the font face. His maintainer will be blamed with others. If
  you're not him it is therefore unfriendly not to fix this error as soon as
  you can.

  fontconfig support to their code (usually, via a higher-level library
  such as pango-cairo). However it can workarounded by the packager with
  symlinks (that will need maintenance).
  
  If an application can not use a modern font format and forces the
  re-packaging in an older format of an exiting font this is an application
  bug that should be reported to the application upstream. In that case
  these is no good solution possible baring the fixing of the application.
  
t6. Error: fonts fc-query can not parse

  ? Upstream task
  
  fc-query could not parse some font files in the package. The files may be
  malformed and in need of fixing, or fc-query has a bug.
  
  Any font file rejected by fc-query will be useless in fontconfig and most
  applications. If it can not be fixed drop it
  
  Please relay the problem to the appropriate upstream to get it fixed.
  
t7. Error: fonts not identified as such by libmagic

  ? Upstream task
  
  libmagic could not identify some files with font-like extensions in the
  package. The files may be malformed and in need of fixing, or they use a
  font extension when they should not, or libmagic has a bug.
  
  Please relay the problem to the appropriate upstream to get it fixed.
  
t9. Error: rpmlint

  ? Packager task
  
  Check rpmlint output to fix the listed packages (using the -i flag if you
  don't understand rpmlint messages).
  
t10. Error: fonts in packages that contain non-font data

  ? Packager task
  
  Please do not mix font files with non-font data in packages. Fonts are
  usually useful outside of the package that deploys them and should be
  installable without pulling in other material.
  
t12. Warning: fonts in packages that do not respect font naming conventions

  ? Packager task
  
  Please respect font package naming conventions and provide consistent
  packages to users. Some scripts may depend on strict package naming.
  
t13. Warning: bad font naming

  ? Font upstream task, with packager workarounds
  
  The font naming declared by one or more files in the package is not a
  canonical WWS? naming or has some other naming problem. As noted by Adobe?
  the W3C CSS font family model used in WPF/WWS is less than ideal, but it is
  a standard and applications expect it.
  
  This script attempted to apply some heuristics to fix this naming, and
  computed different values than those in the font files.
  
  That means some of those files are using non-standard, fuzzy,
  self-conflicting, confusing names. A correct naming:
  1. only includes ?Width?, ?Weight?, ?Slant? qualifiers in its style name;
  2. does not declare more than one of each;
  3. declares them using the canonical keywords defined in the WWS paper;
  4. declares them in ?Width?, ?Weight?, ?Slant? order;
  3. uses spaces to separate them;
  4. does not use ?Width?, ?Weight?, ?Slant? qualifiers in its family name;
  5. does not use symbols such as & that cause problems in SGML/XML/HTML
  contexts.
  
  The canonical naming computed by this script was printed at test time.
  Please note that it is only correct in a formal sense: no attempt was made
  to check that the computed naming corresponds to actual font
  characteristics. It still needs human review (when the computed naming is
  way off however that usually indicates the original naming is particularly
  bad and confusing).
  
  Because the aim of this test is to help improve overall font naming it will
  not accept some user-unfriendly naming exceptions Microsoft handles in its
  WPF heuristic. Also, the naming parsing used in this test is more aggressive
  than the one Microsoft uses, so it will manage to ?fix? some names WPF can
  not, at the expense of a few false positives?.
  
  The average application is not as smart as this script and will not attempt
  to ?fix? font naming in any way. Therefore, even if this script computed a
  correct naming, you should not rely on applications doing the same. Please
  ask the font usptream to fix the naming directly in the font file(s).
  
  Packager workaround: patch the file (if it is available in .sfd format),
  or add a fontconfig rule to your package to hide the problem?.
  
  ? http://blogs.msdn.com/text/attachment/2249036.ashx

  ? http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/CSS%20&%20OT%2015.pdf
  ? For example the family name may include some words that look like a
  ?Width?, ?Weight?, ?Slant? attribute, but that are used in a different
  sense. This script is not a natural language parser and can not detect
  those cases reliably
  ? cf the ?fontpackages? remapping template; unfortunately this workaround
  won't fix problems for non-fontconfig applications, or when
  interoperating with other systems.
  
t14. Warning: core fonts use

  ? Upstream task
  
  This package accesses fonts through the X11 Core protocol.
  
  Numerous long-standing problems with this mode of access, and a design
  that could not scale to modern font needs lead the (then XFree86) team to
  deprecate it in favour of fontconfig (n?e xft). Adoption was quick and by
  2003 it was clear fontconfig was the new standard?. Nowadays fontconfig is
  widely used?, including on non Linux/Unix platforms.
  
  While X11 Core access has been kept on life-support this font system is
  not actively maintained today. The font library it depends on is slowly
  shrinking, as it was created in a period of different legal and technical
  requirements?, and there is no one to update the font files when a problem
  is found?. Therefore, projects are advised to migrate before the situation
  reaches a critical stage.
  
  Fontconfig has been our default font system for a long time, and accessing
  fonts by other means will cause behaviour inconsistencies and many other
  problems (since fontconfig can be used to change the behaviour of a font).
  
  If an application can not use fontconfig today this is a serious bug that
  should be reported to the application upstream. Please ask it to add
  fontconfig support to their code (usually, via a higher-level library
  such as pango-cairo).
  
  
  ? http://xfree86.org/pipermail/forum/2003-March/000799.html
  ? Screen technology changed, encoding standard (Unicode) changed, legal
  reviews became more comprehensive, etc.
  ? Leaving culling the only solution.
  
t15. Warning: font linking

  ? Upstream task
  
  Symlinking is a way for non-font packages to avoid duplicating font files,
  but it is also a symptom of missing or incomplete fontconfig support.
  
  Fontconfig has been our default font system for a long time, and accessing
  fonts by other means will cause behaviour inconsistencies and many other
  problems (since fontconfig can be used to change the behaviour of a font).
  
  If an application can not use fontconfig today this is a serious bug that
  should be reported to the application upstream. Please ask it to add
  fontconfig support to their code (usually, via a higher-level library
  such as pango-cairo).
  
t16. Warning: font faces duplicated within a package

  ? Packager or upstream task
  
  Face duplication within a package is almost certainly a bug (usually,
  mis-naming in one of the font files), except for special symbol font
  families.
  
  1. Fonts that were split because of the limitations of legacy font formats
  (PCF, Type 1?) should be converted to modern OpenType (TT, CFF or bitmap)
  containers.
  
  2. Shipping the same font in different formats is problematic: different
  font formats have different features, and are processed by different font
  libraries. It is almost impossible to create a font in multiple formats
  that will all behave the same. Users hate fonts that do not behave
  consistently everywhere.
  
  3. Most of our applications use fontconfig to access fonts, and fontconfig
  uses font names to identify files. Naming collisions make font selection
  unreliable.
  
  If an application can not use a modern font format and forces the
  re-packaging in an older format of an exiting font this is an application
  bug that should be reported to the application upstream. In that case
  these is no good solution possible baring the fixing of the application.
  
t17. Warning: fonts that do not pass fontlint sanity checks

  ? Font upstream task
  
  Fontforge's fontlint? test suite found problems in some files included in
  the package. Those problems may not be obvious and only manifest as
  strange behaviour in specific applications (making them hard to debug).
  For that reason it is recommanded to report those problems upstream and
  get them fixed, even if the font file seems to work fine most of the time.
  
  You can ask help about specific fontlint errors on:
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fontforge-users
  
  Please relay the problem report to the font upstream.
  
  ? http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/fontlint.html
  
t19. Suggestion: fonts with partial script coverage

  ? Font upstream task
  
  Some font files included in the package are missing a few glyphs to be
  accepted by fontconfig as covering one or several scripts. Therefore they
  could be made useful to more people with only a little effort.
  
  Many scripts differ by only a few glyphs and it is unfortunately common
  for font authors not to notice they stopped just short of full support for
  some of them.
  
  To check a font file script coverage, run:
  $ FC_DEBUG=256 fc-query font-file
  and look for lines like:
  script-id?(number) { list-of-unicode-codepoints }
  
  For example
  ?mi(2) { 1e34 1e35 }?
  means fontconfig will accept the tested file for Maori if codepoints 1e34
  and 1e35 are added.
  
  fontconfig is used by a lot of applications on many systems so ignoring
  its opinion on a font is a mistake.
  
  Please relay the incomplete coverage report to the font upstream.
  
  P.S.
  Of course fontconfig is not perfect either so it may require a glyph for a
  script when it should not. In that case, please report the problem to
  fontconfig upstream:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=fontconfig
  against the ?orth? component.
  
  ? http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
  ? https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=fontconfig
  
t20. Suggestion: fonts with partial unicode block coverage

  ? Font upstream task
  
  Some font files included in the package are missing only a few glyphs to
  fully cover an Unicode block. Therefore they could be made useful to more
  people with only a little effort.
  
  The Unicode consortium revises its tables regularly. A font may need to be
  extended to maintain full coverage of a block when a new Unicode standard
  revision is published?.
  
  To check the unicode coverage of a font, run the ttfcoverage command. (It
  only works for modern .otf or .ttf fonts).
  
  Please relay the incomplete coverage report to the font upstream.

It sure helps. We recently started doing regular checks of various file types,
including fonts, but the whole process need to be tweaked in order to better
distinguish innocuous warnings from serious errors, and the results have to be
processed some day. See

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-check-files-by-format

if you're interested. I wasn't aware of fontlint when I started writing this
script, I'll have a look.

I assume repo-font-audit is a specific fedora tool? Where can it be easily
accessed by non-fedora users? I'd like to have a look at it, I can probably
borrow some ideas (or even code) from it.

Thanks again,
Manuel.

Thanks, I will use it as a second pass repo testing :)

The URL is here:
http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/fontlint.html
and it is a part of fontforge package.

Yes, it is written specifically for Fedora and it is part of
"fontpackages" package:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fontpackages

On the URL above. There is also a link to a git repo there.
Repo-font-audit is a shell script so there shouldn't be problems using
it out of Fedora.

This is very much appreciated. I'm adding Nicolas Mailhot, as the script
author to Cc.

Thanks,
