Thanks for your help, Norbert.

It was broken.

The same directory.

I removed the installation directories and symlinks and installed it again.

This was the way to fix it ;-).

Thanks for your help,

Probably the installer should check and warn ... I will try to hack

Subject: [tex-live] updmap and TEXMFHOME
Message-ID: <4cf87884.Iw3RlymwmAMdSIg5%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>


In my 

$HOME/.texlive2010/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg 

I'm instructed to use either 

updmap-sys --enable Map=foo.map

or add entries to TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
and call

tlmgr generate updmap

This is surely not right for *private* local fonts; i.e., fonts that are
in my TEXMFHOME tree, not in TEXMFLOCAL? I can add Map entries using
updmap -e or updmap --enable Map=... but it seems those entries are
clobbered when tlmgr updates.

I conjectured that I should add entries to TEXMFHOME/web2c/updmap-local.cfg 
but then what do I use to re-generate 

$HOME/.texlive2010/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg

Does not work for the updmap.cfg in your home directory

does not work either.

No they shouldn't.
	tlmgr generate updmap
will update TEXROOT/2010/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg, so it
will not clobber changes you have made to the one in TEXMFHOME:

Fonts in home directories are a pain, still by now.

You can:
- move them to TEXMFLOCAL if you have access to it
- keep them in TEXMFHOME, but then you have to call tlmgr with
   additional argumetns:
      tlmgr --localcfg /path/to/your/local/updmap-local.cfg \
            --dest ~/.texlive2010/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg \
            generate updmap

This ensures that all fonts installed in the system plus all your
fonts are included in your home updmap.cfg, but you have to
do that whenever the sysadm has changed something regarding fonts
in the main updmap.sys

All the best

Norbert

PS: tlmgr is by now *NOT* meant for user file configuration and
management, it is for the TeX system admin.

Then there might be something wrong with my
configuration because I lost all recent updates to my
$HOME/.texlive2010/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg when tmlmgr did a
system update. (And other strange things have happened; kpsewhich still
can't find tcfmgr.map unless there's a copy in the pwd.)

TEXMFHOME is the only reasonable place to put licensed proprietary
fonts.

Surely we can do better than this. The problem seems to be that updmap
currently expects a *single* configuration file. It should instead
merge system, local, and user files when it is called. Or it should be
possible for one config file to link to another; then they could be
changed independently (without necessitating regeneration of the one
true updmap.cfg).  Lots of applications allow for system/local/user 
configuration files, and allow call-time options as well.

I wouldn't expect tlmgr to *manage* user config files; but they should be
allowed for.

This is really strange and I cannot see how that can under normal circumstances happen.

Can you send the output of
    tlmgr conf
please? Both running as normal user and as root.

Well, something seems badly wrong on your side ... some env variables?

Yes we know, but nobody came up with a solution. Mind that updmap is a mdta program, it generates conf files for other progs, so simply including other (users) files is not enough, optimally *all* programs should read from different sources....

If someone steps forward and does that for tex, pdftex, xetex, dvips, luatex, etc etc that would be great ... but nobody did.

As said, I'm quite surprisedbut other symptoms on your system point to a seriously broken system.

I don't know what a mdta program is. AFAIK, only updmap and updmap-sys
read updmap.cfg files. Their *outputs* are read by other programs but
I'm only talking about re-organizing their *input(s)*.

The updmap of miktex is doing it: It reads all updmap.cfg-files
starting from the one in the main root up (or down) to the one in
the UserConfig-root. I must say that I don't quite understand why it
should be so difficult for the updmap of TeXLive. It is able to
merge two cfg's (updmap.cfg and updmap-local.cfg) so why not three
or more?

Becasue it is not updmap, but tlmgr. tlmgr creates from the information
of the installed packages and the -local.cfg the final updmap.cfg,
which is read by updmap.

The real problem here is that we need a rewrite of updmap in perl,
then it will be portable on all systems. Currently we have the version 
in bash for Unix, and a C version for W32, which is not optimal.

Well the first time I tried to pdflatex something after a tlmgr update,
I got the familiar missing font messages, so I did updmap and it
immediately bailed telling me that tcfmgr.map couldn't be found (I can't
recall the exact message). At this point I looked at my updmap.cfg and
realized most of my additions had gone missing. After copying tcfmgr.map
to wherever I was and restoring updmap.cfg from backup, I'm again in
business. And now updmap seems to work without needing a local copy of
tcfmgr.map.  All very mysterious.

I'd say it was an example of the operation being unsuccessful but the
patient lived. Next time I tlmgr update I'll be sure to have a backup of
my updmap.cfg at hand.

Sure.  But which TeX engines are you using?  If you need pdftex and
luatex only, I recommend to add \pdfmapline to the macro package which
is loading the font(s).  But it doesn't work with dvips or xetex.

\pdfmapline is a pdftex primitive and described in the pdftex manual.

I would be very grateful if someone finds the time to implement
\pdfmapline in dvips.  We already can pass the information on the
command line, what's missing is the ability to pass it via \special.
As far as xetex is concerned, maybe Jonathan can steal code from
pdftex.

IMO \pdfmapline is by far the better concept.  I'm absolutely
convinced that it's more valuable to invest the time in order to get
rid of updmap instead of improving it.

I recently used \pdfmapline for a modified version of a font.  It's
amazing how easy things can be.  AFAIK, ConTeXt uses \pdfmapline for
ages and doesn't use updmap at all.

Bob mentioned call-time options.  I don't have the slightest idea how
to implement them with the existing model.  With \pdfmapline it's
extremely easy.  Everything can be done at macro level.  Instead of
running 

  updmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14=false

and creating all the map files again, one could simply write:

  \usepackage[download=false]{helvetica}

This would be a significant improvement, IMO.


Another thing comes to my mind: Since dvipdfm is a symlink to dvipdfmx
now, is there any program that needs dvipdfm.map anymore?  According
to strace, dvipdfmx uses pdftex.map.  Can we comment out the piece of
code in updmap which creates this file?  It slows down updmap so much.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It will have to be sent via \special to xdvipdfmx.

There is a small caveat. If I need a small part of text in Times, I
write just {\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n}Text} and I know that the driver
knows from updmap.cfg how to handle Times. If updmap.cfg is removed,
all these documents will cease to work unless the \pdfmapline commands
are dumped into the format.

Then it's similar to dvips but it seems that you can't specify

Good that you mention it.  Maybe this problem can be solved somehow,
but ATM I'm quite clueless.  The following works fine:

-------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
text
\newpage
text
\newpage
\pdfmapline{=zchr8r CharterBT-Roman <8r.enc <bchr8a.pfb}
{\usefont{T1}{zch}{m}{n}Text}
\newpage
text
\end{document}
-------------------------------------------------------

I thought that it's sufficient to put \pdfmapline into the .fd file
because this is loaded on demand:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ProvidesFile{t1zch.fd}
   [2010/10/29 Fontinst v1.933 font definitions for T1/zch.]

\pdfmapline{=zchb8r  CharterBT-Bold                   <8r.enc <bchb8a.pfb}
\pdfmapline{=zchbi8r CharterBT-BoldItalic             <8r.enc <bchbi8a.pfb}
\pdfmapline{=zchbo8r CharterBT-Bold  ".167 SlantFont" <8r.enc <bchb8a.pfb}
\pdfmapline{=zchr8r  CharterBT-Roman                  <8r.enc <bchr8a.pfb}
\pdfmapline{=zchri8r CharterBT-Italic                 <8r.enc <bchri8a.pfb}
\pdfmapline{=zchro8r CharterBT-Roman ".167 SlantFont" <8r.enc <bchr8a.pfb}

\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{zch}{}
[...]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

But I get:

[2]
(/opt/tex/texlive/texmf-zcharter/tex/latex/zcharter/t1zch.fd) [3] [4]
(./testmapline.aux)
kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 zchr8r
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for zchr8r.
mktexpk: perhaps zchr8r is missing from the map file.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.

Please note that the error occurs after all pages had been shipped
out.

The following works:

\input t1zch.fd
{\usefont{T1}{zch}{m}{n}Text}

And even this:

{\usefont{T1}{zch}{m}{n}Text}
\input t1zch.fd

Don't know yet how \usefont loads the .fd file.

it runs with nfss catcodes, which (among other things) ignores spaces,
which is (of course) death to map files.

if you preceded the loading with something setting the catcode of space
(and so on) back, and then reset using \nfss at catcodes afterwards, your
code would work.

Dear Zdenek --

When you post code such as the following, you run the risk
of it being either misunderstood or even incomprehensible
to newer members of the TeX fraternity :

> \let\savedpdfmapline\pdfmapline
> \def\pdfmapline{\begingroup\catcode`\ 10 \execpdfmapline}
> \def\execpdfmapline#1{\endgroup\savedpdfmapline{#1}}

If you were to put in a few spaces and assignment operators,
as in the following, it might be considerably more transparent
to others :

\let \savedpdfmapline = \pdfmapline
\def \pdfmapline {\begingroup \catcode `\ = 10 \execpdfmapline}
\def \execpdfmapline #1{\endgroup \savedpdfmapline {#1}}

What do you think ?

but you need to reset tab (at least) as well.

to input a file, you need to reset eol as well (not that that was the
question...)

You have forgotten the space before the assignment operator,
the space here belongs to the control token before.

\def \pdfmapline {\begingroup \catcode `\  = 10 \execpdfmapline}

It's a matter of taste.
I would probably have formatted it as:

\let\savedpdfmapline\pdfmapline
\def\pdfmapline{%
  \begingroup
  \catcode`\ =10 %
  \execpdfmapline
}
\def\execpdfmapline#1{%
  \endgroup
  \savedpdfmapline{#1}%
}

The redefined \pdfmapline is incompatible to the primitive \pdfmapline.
For example, LaTeX 3 uses `~' as space token where ` ' is also
ignored.

Also the map line uses `=' that is not covered by \nfss at catcodes.
`=' might be active (see turkish.ldf). Also missing is `+'.

\begingroup
  % assuming \nfss at catcodes is in force
  \catcode32=10\relax % space
  \catcode43=12\relax % plus
  \catcode61=12\relax % equals
  \pdfmapline{...}%
\endgroup

Not forgotten : omitted because two spaces in source
code can look extremely confusing if not protected by
string quotes !

If \pdfmapline commands were in the fd-files it would be difficult
for a user to overwrite such defaults as the fd-files are quite
often read just before the font is used.

Amen! I've been using TeX for several years now and I've always wrote
\let in the wrong order (I really mean always, not a single time I wrote
it first in the correct order, until I told my self to always do the
reverse of what I'd consider first), Have I seen it written with an
equal sign, I'm sure I would never confuse it.

You don't need string quotes ;-)

  \catcode \@firstofone {`\ } = 10

or

  \@firstofone {\catcode `\ } = 10

or use \@firstoftwo instead of \@firstofone ;-)

Which defaults do you have in mind?  \DeclareFontShape?  When I change
them in the preamble, I usually load the .fd file before to make sure
that nothing gets overwritten later.

Or do you have something else in mind?

I understand what Ulrike means. Imagine that I have an "improved"
version of PFB filesand I want to tes them using the same TFM files. I
do not want to install them because I am not sure that I want to use
them in all document. I therefore add \pdfmapline or \pdfmapfile to
the beginning of the document. If the fd file is not preloaded in the
format and the font is first used after my \pdfmap* commands, they
will be overwritten by the definitions from the fd file.

In past I used \pdfmapfile for defining new PFB mapping for testing
purpose and when typesetting a document using a commercial font which
I was allowed to use  just for that single document, therefore I did
not want to install it.

I suppose that \nfss at catcodes sets only the catcodes for characters
used by NFSS.  Suppose you are using Babel and " is active and
\pdfmapline contains PostScript code like "0.167 SlantFont".

dvips also needs [ for things like: 

      "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <[8r.enc 

Do we need
  \catcode`\"=12
  \catcode`\[=12
as well?

  Reinhard

They are covered by \nfss at catcodes.

Example test file that works for pdftex.map:

\makeatletter
\newcommand*{\pdfmap at catcodes}{%
  \nfss at catcodes
  \catcode`\ =10 %
  \catcode`\^^I=10 %
  \@makeother\+%
  \@makeother\=%
  \@makeother\_% 
}

% helper macros for test
\def\RestoreCatcodes{}
\count@=0 %
\loop
  \edef\RestoreCatcodes{%
    \RestoreCatcodes
    \catcode\the\count@=\the\catcode\count@\relax
  }%
\ifnum\count@<255 %  
  \advance\count@ 1 %
\repeat

\def\RangeCatcodeInvalid#1#2{%
  \count@=#1\relax
  \loop
    \catcode\count@=15 %
  \ifnum\count@<#2\relax
    \advance\count@ 1 %
  \repeat
}
\expandafter\ifx\csname LoadCommand\endcsname\relax
  \def\LoadCommand{\input ltxcmds.sty\relax}%
\fi
\def\Test{%
  \RangeCatcodeInvalid{0}{47}% 
  \RangeCatcodeInvalid{58}{64}%
  \RangeCatcodeInvalid{91}{96}%  
  \RangeCatcodeInvalid{123}{255}%
  \LoadCommand
  \RestoreCatcodes
}

% do the test by reading pdftex.map;                          
% put pdftex.map in a location where it can be found
% as TeX input file (e.g.current directory).
\RequirePackage{catchfile}
\def\LoadCommand{%
  \CatchFileDef\TestMap{pdftex.map}{\pdfmap at catcodes}%
}
\Test
\csname @@end\endcsname\end

But other characters could also be added, e.g., &, $, ?, !, ...

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

Ok, I didn't consider this case.  I recently did it the other way
round: I created new metrics for Bitstream Charter and thus had a
renamed tfm file.

But if this all is about testing, a simple solution is to load the .fd
files before setting \pdfmapline in the preamble.  They won't be
overwritten later.

  Reinhard

Sorry, it seems that my printed copy of the LaTeX2e kernel sources
that I consulted last night is hopefully out of date.

Yes I meant the case that someone would like to change the
pdfmap-entries, but I didn't thought only about testing. I also
thought about settings like dvipsPreferOutline, dvipsDownloadBase35
and LW35 in updmap.cfg. Do you really think that a user who wants to
use the adobe fonts instead of the urw fonts should be forced to add
some code to every document?

No.  When a user wants to use an Adobe font in one document, he
doesn't want to break all the other documents.  You cannot reliably
use Adobe fonts with metrics for URW fonts.  I was told that there are
already different versions of the Adobe fonts.  Hence, the behavior is
quite unpredictable.  Not downloading the fonts is even worse.

Nevertheless, one could also consider a config file written in TeX.

I think it's desirable to be able to specify the fonts in documents.
It's not possible with updmap.

Regards,
  Reinhard

as cool.pdf just shows the implementation and the other one is rather

W? y? sh? : but it's some odd convention that the TeX Live team

Hi Lars,

(For the future: it's better to write about texdoc things on texdoc at tug.org.)

    texdoc cool
    point to
    texdoc Content_LaTeX_Package_Demo.pdf

As usual, texdoc is just following the Catalogue here, which says

<documentation details='Package documentation'
        href='ctan:/macros/latex/contrib/cool/cool.pdf'/>
<documentation details='EXamples of use'
        href='ctan:/macros/latex/contrib/cool/Content_LaTeX_Package_Demo.pdf'/>

    as cool.pdf just shows the implementation and the other one is rather 
    hard to guess.

Perhaps Robin could change the Catalogue to say something like 
implementation" for the first and documentation for the second, then.
Robin, wdyt?


Thanks,
k

i'm not entirely sure what's needed; i've made the doc descriptions more
... descriptive of what the docs seem to be doing.

I've got not idea as to how it is done at the TL end.

Just think that a user looking for help on the cool package might not 
get much help from the cool.pdf file.

Nothing is done in TeX Live.  tecdoc reads the catalogue and assigns
entries with <documentation details='Package documentation' a very
high priority.

Not that I agree with this change (see below), what Karl suggested is
to change the catalogue entry like this:

 <documentation details='Package implementation'
         href='ctan:/macros/latex/contrib/cool/cool.pdf'/>
 <documentation details='Package documentation'
         href='ctan:/macros/latex/contrib/cool/Content_LaTeX_Package_Demo.pdf

 > Just think that a user looking for help on the cool package might
 > not get much help from the cool.pdf file.

The opposite is the case.  Actually, the example file doesn't contain
any information which isn't already present in cool.pdf.  Just ignore
the macro code.  Each macro is explained somehow, even with examples.

I don't think that the proposed change is a good idea.  The file
cool.pdf *is* the package manual and the file
Content_LaTeX_Package_Demo.pdf is exactly what its name implies.  I'm
sure that texdoc's current behavior is what the package author intended.


Robin, something related: entries/v/vntex.xml doesn't contain an entry
for vntex.pdf yet.  Could you add the following, please?

 <documentation details='Package manual' language='en'
       href='ctan:/language/vietnamese/vntex/doc/generic/vntex/vntex.pdf'/>

There is another file, written in Vietnamese, vntex-man.pdf, which
already has a 'Package manual' tag in the catalogue.  This shouldn't
be found in the first place by texdoc.  vntex.pdf is the main manual
and has hyperlinks to vntex-man.pdf and other related files already.

I don't know what to do with vntex-man.pdf.  Maybe Manuel can give
advice.  I didn't find out from the texdoc code how catalogue tags are
handled.  If "manual" has a higher precedence than "documentation", it
would be sufficient to assign:

  vntex.pdf     ==> 'Package manual'
  vntex-man.pdf ==> 'Package documentation'

Manuel, any suggestions?

Regards,
  Reinhard

just failed to notice that.  it is at the bottom of a huge tree (why
can't you provide a .tds.zip instead, and have a flatter, browsable,
tree on the main archive?)

i've added your vntex.pdf to the catalogue entry.  if you don't like
what i've done (it'll be visible on the web tonight some time), please
ask for another change.  (while i do occasionally browse the catalogue
looking for problems, there are several thousand entries, and the
chances that i will spot any particular problem are pretty small.  i
can deal with people's requests rather quickly, though.)

FWIW, I have no strong opinion on that point, so I won't take any measure (such
as adding an alias) regarding the result of "texdoc cool". Users who are not
satisfied with the first result are expected to run "texdoc -l cool" which will
offer them a choice between the two documents:

 1 /home/mpg/tl/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/doc/latex/cool/cool.pdf
   = Package documentation
 2
/home/mpg/tl/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/doc/latex/cool/Content_LaTeX_Package_Demo.pdf
   = EXamples of use

Well, you didn't find that part of the code because there is none! The actual
contents of the "details" field are mostly ignored, since it's basically
free-form text. The idea is, if the file was worth a comment in the catalogue,
then it's probably worth a score bonus. I hope Robin won't start adding comments
like "don't read this" :-)

(Full disclaimer: I lied and texdoc does look at the content, but only to see if
it contains the string "readme", then it gives it a lesser bonus.)

None at all on this point.

Currently, there is an alias vntex=vntex that forces vntex.pdf to be the first
result. If vntex gets any comment in the catalogue, then this alias will become
useless and my alias checking script will warn me, so I'll eventually remove it.

I already upload .tds.zip files since you are maintaining them.  This
is also the least error-prone way to create a CTAN package which can
be used by TeX Live and MikTeX because the stuff in the vntex svn
repository is TDS compliant already.

A flatter tree might be more convenient for browsing, but I don't
see much benefit.  If I upload a tree for browsing and a .tds.zip
file, which one would you check for changes?

You could use geometry pacakge. Just add
\usepackage{geometry}

With `geometry' I can see the changed paper size. But why article is not
respecting the paper size option? I need to fix this because some of my
.tex files are exported by software. Thanks.

I didn't digg deep but AFAIU this is related with '\special' command.
latex/pdflatex must have different content for that command. geometry
package take care of that. IMHO by default article class uses latex
(read: dvi/ps) special command (or this is hard-coded into config files
so to change that setting globally one should change default paper
with the help of tlmgr).

I don't want to raise big flame but nowadays the only 'right' way to
change paper size is to use geometry pacakge.

Because LaTeX by itself does not have an idea on which *physical*
paper size you are printing, and it has no idea how to transport
that to the driver.

That is about as old a question as LaTeX. It was always like that that
you have to use one of the following:
- give the physical page format to the driver (dvips)
- use special packages to instruct pdflatex to set the paper size
  (latex by itself does NOT do that!)

As said, this has nothing to do with TeX Live, this is texhax material,
or any other user group related to TeX. Thanks.

Best wishes

Subject: [tex-live] Value of TEXDOCS in texmf.cnf needs adjustment ?
Message-ID: <2b672cc7a310acfd9a48ba6665eb787c@free.fr>

Hi TUG list,

following installation of TeXLive 2010 (via MacTeX) on a Mac OS X,
I had the following problem: texdoc would not find documentation
(despite an up-to-date ls-R file in texmf-local) I had
added into /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/doc

The value of TEXDOCS as defined in 2010/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf is
TEXDOCS = $TEXMF/doc//
and there was no occurrence in 2010/texmf.cnf

In the end I had to do two modifications, as seen here in the TEXDOCS  
line
which I added to 2010/texmf.cnf:

TEXDOCS =  
{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFLOCAL,$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,$TEXMFSYS 
VAR,$TEXMFMAIN,$TEXMFDIST}{/doc,/doc//}

Modif A: with /doc//, the documentation added in /doc but not in  
sub-directories was not found
Modif B: with the !! (as in TEXMF) the documentation in texmf-local/doc  
was not found, presumably
because I did not create an ls-R file in texmf-local/doc
(Modif C: i put the $TEXMFLOCAL earlier in the list, I don't know if it  
is then earlier in the
*two* expansions of braces, /doc and /doc// )

If really there is a need for an ls-R file in texmf-local/doc,  
shouldn't there be in
2010/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf or 2010/texmf.cnf some appropriate  
adjustment to TEXMFDBS?

Why doesn't the ls-R file at the top of the texmf-local hierarchy  
suffices for texdoc to find files
when TEXDOCS is defined as originally as $TEXMF/doc// ?

Is not normal that TEXDOCS is not at least defined as  
$TEXMF{/doc,/doc//} ?

Regards,
Jean-Francois

What exactly did you download? Remember there is a zip file for Windows that
contains Strawberry Perl and tar file for unix systems that contain Perl
automatically as a part of the operating system.

Could you explain what do you try to do in detail?
What package you try to install and its documentation?
Where do you install them?

Your previous description is a bit unclear for me.

Hello Jean-Francois,

    Modif A: with /doc//, the documentation added in /doc but not in  
    sub-directories was not found

That's because all the $TEXMF trees must follow the TDS structure.
Files directly in the top-level doc/ (or any other) tree indeed aren't found.

    If really there is a need for an ls-R file in texmf-local/doc,  

There isn't, if you put the files in the TDS directories.

    Is not normal that TEXDOCS is not at least defined as  
    $TEXMF{/doc,/doc//} ?

What's normal is the way it is defined now (and has been for ages):
$TEXMF/doc//

You are implicitly arguing that it would be nice if doc files could be
found anywhere under $TEXMF/doc (especially texmf-local).  It's the same
argument as wanting to find tex files anywhere under $TEXMF/tex
(especially texmf-local or texmf-home, which people have asked about it
in the past).

I don't disagree, in principle.  It could be done (via a new tree that
is explicitly not TDS), but it's not a simplistic change.  Meanwhile,
however, that is not now and has never been the way it is set up.  So if
you don't want to mess with subdirs, then yes, you have to mess with
texmf.cnf definitions.

Sorry,
karl

$TEXMF/doc// means $TEXMF/doc and subdirs.
$TEXMF/doc/foo.txt can be found by
kpsewhich --format=doc foo.txt.

It is a special feature of search.tlu of texdoc that cannot find
files in the starting directory $TEXMF/doc, in the case of
TEXDOCS=$TEXMF/doc//

Thanks,
Akira

Hi Akira, Karl and Vladimir

thank you very much for the kind attention devoted to my question,
I confirm that my installation works as Akira said

> It is a special feature of search.tlu of texdoc that cannot find
> files in the starting directory $TEXMF/doc, in the case of

with TEXDOCS=$TEXMF/doc// I obtain:

~% kpsewhich --format=doc frenchb2-doc.pdf
/usr/local/texlive/2010/../texmf-local/doc/frenchb2-doc.pdf
~% texdoc frenchb2-doc.pdf
Sorry, no documentation found for frenchb2-doc.pdf.
If you are unsure about the name, try searching CTAN's TeX catalogue at
http://ctan.org/search.html#byDescription.

with TEXDOCS as in my initial post, texdoc does find frenchb2-doc.pdf

Thanks again,
Best regards,
Jean-Francois Burnol

Hi Karl,

I have a kind of auxiliary question [probably not important enough to 
create another topic]

When I was fiddling with the texmf.cnf at the top of texlive/2010,
I thought that it would be better for my modifications to be in 
texlive/texmf-local

however kpsewhich does not find copies I created in texlive/texmf-local

~% ls /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/texmf*
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/texmf.cnf

~% kpsewhich --all texmf.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf.cnf
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

Wouldn't it be better if one could put a texmf.cnf in texmf-local?

Incidentally, in the end, and regarding my initial post, I have decided
not to change TEXDOCS, but rather simply to put everything in texmf-doc 
in
sub-directories.

(so my frenchb2-doc.pdf is now in /texmf-local/doc/doc/ and is found by 
texdoc)

best regards,
Jean-Francois

I wonder whether that would create a paradox ?  Might TeX & friends
not have to consult TeXMF.cnf in order to know where TeXMF-Local is ?

I am afraid texmf-local is a dangerous place for texmf.cnf because it
is shared between texlive versions. Imagine you modify texmf.cnf now
for TL2010. It may happen that TL2011 will require some changes in
texmf.cnf and will not work with texmf.cnf from TL2010. Even if you
completely uninstall TL2010 before installing TL2011, texmf-local will
not be deleted. Thus TL2011 will find your old texmf.cnf and will not
work.

Hi Philip

but from the doc, it seems that all texmf.cnf files are read, so for 
example
my texmf.cnf in /usr/local/texlive/2010/ contains only three lines

TEXMFHOME = ~/Library/texmf
TEXMFVAR = ~/Library/texlive/2010/texmf-var
TEXMFCONFIG = ~/Library/texlive/2010/texmf-config

Hence the bulk of the configuration is still in the initial texmf.cnf in
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/web2c/

However, if TEXMFLOCAL is redefined in a copy of texmf.cnf in 
texmf-local/  . . .
. . . then I guess things could happen,

but I am just a user, I know nothing of the internals of texlive

regards,
Jean-Francois Burnol

I see your point. I had the worry that personal modifications I made
to the texmf.cnf at the top of the distribution would be lost in an
upgrade, however this was silly on my part as  I had forgotten that
TexLive would install an entirely new 2011 repertory, so whatever I had
done to the 2010 repertory would still be there in case of need of
reproduction

It's not a god idea (as Zdenek wrote already), but you can---you just
used the wrong place---see the definition of TEXMFCNF kpse var:

  kpsewhich --expand-braces \$TEXMFCNF

(WARNING: do not mess with this variable or you may end up with an
unusable installation).

I also feel compelled to point you to:

  texdoc kpathsea

so you get a better idea how things work.

No, you can't.  TEXMFDOCS is already set and will not be overwritten
by any file loaded later.  You can only change it before
TEXMFMAIN/web2c/texmf.cnf is read, for instance in
SELFFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf, which is provided by TeX Live but is empty by
default (contains just some explanations).

It doesn't make sense to have a texmf.cnf in TEXMFLOCAL because the
variable TEXMFDOCS controls the search strategy for *all* TEXMF trees,
regardless where it's set.  I suppose that Jean-Francois wants to have
a dedicated texmf.cnf in TEXMFLOCAL which controls only the behavior
of this particular tree, but this isn't possible.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Manuel, perhaps you could use the kpse.lookup function instead of the
custom implementation of the kpse search?  Taco kindly implemented
this function to expose all available options from kpsewhich
(including --all to return all matches, which wasn't possible before).

Cheers,

Tomek

Nope, even --all isn't flexible enough for what texdoc wants to do. But I'm
aware of the problem (I mean the general problem of duplicating part of kpse,
not only this particular bug) and it is on my list.

Message-ID: <AANLkTiko3cVkHsoVVZEJhDj1t1R5dMMjJLoiV-aNgrq3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

We are debating a change in how external Perl installations are
treated on win32.

Currently, an installed 3rd party Perl is used (if found on the path)
instead of the one from TeX Live in order to allow for extra modules
that some scripts we ship may need.  Unfortunately, some distributors
ship a bare bones Perl interpreter with their software and they think
it's a good idea to put that on the path.  Such a stray Perl will
break lots of our basic utilities (e.g., epstopdf)---clearly not a
good situation.

We plan to introduce an explicit option to enable search for an
external Perl with a default value set to disabled.  Are there any
users relying on the current behaviour, who would not welcome that
change?

Cheers,

Tomek

I would normally expect to have Active Perl on a PC prior to
installing TeX Live, but I cannot envisage any situation in
which I rely on this fact.

This gets quite tricky -- the user may not even be aware that a perl was
installed with some application, or they may install TL and then install an
application that puts a minimal perl on the path and will break existing
apps that rely on the path to find a perl interpreter.

I favor an approach that enumerates the available perl's and lets the user
choose, maybe with some advice of the form "if you don't know what perl
is, choose the one from TL, but note that certain utilities do require
a complete
perl installation."  Once found, the perl path needs to be saved and used.
Perhaps one  option would be "Use the perl interpreter found in the path" for
people who plan to update perl early and often.

One year ago I tried to run quite a simple Perl/Tk program on a WinXP
computer with Active State Perl and it crashed when displaying the
very first window. I grabbed Strawberry Perl from TL repository and it
works fine. I am afraid that it is difficult to know whether the
installed Perl is complete enough. It is possible to write a perl
script that will test whether everything is available but it will be a
lot of work.

What do you mean?  A Perl script which checks whether everything is
available it needs itself, or a Perl script which checks whether
everything is available what _another_ Perl script needs?

The first case is not so interesting because we can't change other
people's programs.  And the only benefit I see is that it allows to
provide a more comprehensible error message.

If you have the second case in mind, what would you do?

  Reinhard

All our gui programs (and a few other vital scripts) are already
restricted to tlperl, so we have the basis covered there ;)

The script could check whether the third party perl provides all
modules needed by th script. If not, it will inform the user. The user
then either may try to install them from CPAN or use perl distributed
with TL. I agree with Tomek that it is very good. I need to port my
perl scripts developed on Linux for Windows users. They are quite
complex and run well on TL perl. So I think that trying to use
(unknown) third party perl will be a lot of endless work which is not
worth the trouble.

Dear list,

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and installed TeXLive 2010 according to the
instructions without error messages.  Unfortunately, already the first
test (latex small2e) failed.  The essential part of the error message
is:

===========================================
Local configuration file hyphen.cfg used
===========================================
(/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/hyphen.cfg
! I can't find file `ushyph.tex'.

(Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit)
Please type another input file name:
! Emergency stop.
<to be read again>
                   \relax
l.370   \repeat

No pages of output.
Transcript written on latex.log.' instead of a filename.
I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

Interestingly -- if I switch back to the (slightly outdated) texlive-
full from the Ubuntu repositories -- small2e compiles without
problems.  But ushyph.tex does not appear in that installation of the
Ubuntu-package either
- -- and the two hyphen.cfg equal, too.  Has anybody experienced a
similar problem?

Cheers,

Konstantin

tl 2010, afaics, contains no reference to ushyph.tex

its language.dat loads hyphen.tex for us hyphenations.

so (apart from the fact that you've not generated any formats, which is
odd -- my install of tl2010 did that for me) ... i would guess you've
got a language.dat somewhere on your path, that's not part of tl2010.

Ouch ... something is wrong.

Did you set up your PATH variable properly?

What does

Beautiful.  That was exactly the reason.  (In our workgroup, we use a
common local-texmf folder which gets mounted into everybody's home.
Unfortunately, some friend on Windows put the language.dat of his MikTeX
therein.)

After removing that, I finished the installation (generating the
formats) and everything runs just fine.

Message-ID: <46a7e012fc77ec153a18a9ccf1d57a47@free.fr>

Hi everybody,

I made recently an installation of TeXLive 2010 via MacTeX,
on a Mac OS X 10.3.9

I previously had a teTeX based installation dating back to 2005,
via Gerben Wierda's i-installer

the MacTeX installer detected correctly the previous installation

For testing purposes, i wanted to try out switching back to the old
tree. Something did not work and I identified the cause of the problem
to be the following:

in /Library/TeX/Distributions/.FactoryDefaults:

drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102  2 Dec 19:47 Fink-teTeX
   drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102  2 Dec 19:47 MacPorts-teTeX
   drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102  2 Dec 19:47 TeXLive-2010
   drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102  2 Dec 19:47 gwTeX-2003-2005

all 4 directories have a Contents/Program/  sub-directory with each 3  
symbolic links
i386, powerpc and ppc.

Actually not gwTeX-2003-2005 which only has "i386" and "powerpc" links

however my usr/texbin symbolic link is

texbin -> ../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/ppc

which in the ends corresponds to the "ppc" link in the directories  
Contents/Program of
each texdist tree. As the "ppc" was missing from gwTeX-2003-2005 it did  
not work

I don't remember removing by myself such a link! so I assume it was not  
created by
the installation script in the first place

An oddity: the control panel "TeX Distribution" installed by MacTeX did  
give me two
choices but on selecting gwTeX-2003-2005 and even after having typed-in  
my password
to validate administrator rights, it did not seem to do anything and it  
seems it first
did something after I had done sudo chmod g+w on the whole /Library/TeX  
  tree.

Further oddity: then appeared a "/usr/powerpctexbin" symbolic link
lrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel     66 17 Dec 23:24 powerpctexbin ->  
../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/powerpc

which would have made the set-up functional, except for the fact that  
nothing
was changed to /etc/csh.login and /etc/profile, so the path to the  
binaries was
still /usr/texbin and not /usr/powerpctexbin

(and pointed to nothing because of the missing "ppc" link)

The cure to all this was simply for me to manually create the "ppc" link

   
/Library/TeX/Distributions/.FactoryDefaults/gwTeX-2003-2005/Contents/ 
Programs:
   total used in directory 24 available 14099312
   drwxrwxr-x   5 root  admin  170 18 Dec 00:30 .
   drwxrwxr-x  12 root  admin  408  2 Dec 19:47 ..
   lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin   66  2 Dec 19:47 i386 ->  
../../../../../../../usr/local/teTeX/bin/i386-apple-darwin-current
   lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin   69  2 Dec 19:47 powerpc ->  
../../../../../../../usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current
   lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin   69 18 Dec 00:30 ppc ->  
../../../../../../../usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current

I am rather impressed that everything works so nicely. In particular it  
is very clever how one does
not need to change anything to the /usr/texbin symbolic link, so that  
there is no need to ever
fiddle with $PATH once it has been set-up to contain "/usr/texbin"

and switching from one distribution to the other is as simple as  
modifying the sole link in
  /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX
very nice

Regards,

Jean-Francois

I can't seem to find it where it was in TL2009, under

If so, any particular reason? superseded by something else? redundant? I am sorry, but I have been unable to find information about this on the web.

Its license is not DFSG compatible (classified as "Other non-Debian licenses" on 
CTAN), so it cannot be included in TeX Live. But it is always available from 
CTAN:
http://ctan.org/pkg/sphack
If you want it in TeX Live, you may ask the author whether he is willing to 
change the license.

Jean-Francois,

Thanks for the detailed bug report!

When MacTeX installs TeX Live, it creates TeX Distribution structures for itself, and for three
other distributions: Fink, MacPorts, and Gerben's original teTeX (but not gwTeX). That's because
these three distributions don't create their own TeX Distribution structures. But MacTeX does not
edit TeX Distribution structures created by other distributors.

Thus the gwTeX structure contains a powerpc link but no ppc link because that's what Gerben
originally provided. This wasn't a mistake on his part; the ppc link came later.

The puzzling feature of your bug report is that your /usr/texbin points to 

	../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/ppc

I have now checked the install scripts for MacTeX 2010, 2009, and 2008 and BasicTeX and all
create a link to 

	../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/powerpc

I also checked my own powerpc machine, which has this second link. The actual code which
does this is in a postflight script. The script first removes any existing symbolic link named
/usr/texbin, and then does the following:

	PROCESSOR=`/usr/bin/uname -p`

	if [[ "$PROCESSOR" == "powerpc" ]]; then
	echo "### setting program link powerpc"
	ln -fhs ../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/powerpc /usr/texbin

Thus the real puzzle is why your /usr/texbin link is incorrect. 

I have never heard of

	/usr/powerpctexbin

and have no idea where that came from.

Jean-Francois,

There is one small mistake in my previous message.  The gwTeX-2003-2005 distribution
is Gerben's original xeTeX distribution rather than his TeX Live based distribution, so your
TeX Distribution structure for it was indeed written by MacTeX. It only contains the powerpc link
because we only had that link in the early days. That would have caused no trouble if your
/usr/texbin link had been correct.

The main puzzle remains. Why do you have an incorrect /usr/texbin link?

Subject: [tex-live] OCR-B fonts
Message-ID: <AANLkTik=vc1mrW1_ZGoEvja1Ta5pL+GZvTWxj9sJTA-U@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I tried to find the license for OCR-B fonts. I have only found the
ocrbinfo file saying:

  2. It is given to free non commercial use, but it may be
     that there rights to the typeface stuff, as
     the original typeface for OCR-B was developed by
     Adam Frutiger. These rights may restrict the use,
     I do not know. (In Germany there even exists an industrial
     standard - DIN ????? - that describes the typefaces.
     Based on such material the input has been developed.)
     Therefore the only rights that I can grant are the
     rights for the digitization in METAFONT input.

The reason why I ask is because a few years ago I converted these
fonts to Type1 by mftrace and some users are interested in my PFB
files. Thus I have the following questions:

1. Is the original license OK so that I can distribute PFB files
created from them (mftrace runs metafont + potrace + fontforge)

2. What kind of free license will suit best to these Type1 fonts?

3. What is the proper place on CTAN where I should put it? The fonts
directory already contains the ocr-b directory with the MF sources.

4. Is someone willing to prepare higher quality OCR-B in Type-1 and
possibly OpenType (with hinting etc)?

Sincerely,
--

Hello Richard,

here is what I just did.

1. I changed the name of the file /usr/texbin to be /usr/temptexbin

2. I went to my System Preferences: TeX distributions,
(the selected distribution is TeXlive-2010)

immediately some error message pops up (in French)
and tells me some link is broken and proposes to fix it. I say Ok,
and then the Control Panel tells me that the problem has been
fixed and that my TeX should be functional

3. so I go to look again at my /usr repertory and it contains now
   lrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel     62 18 Dec 18:23 texbin -> 
../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Cont\
ents/Programs/ppc

in addition to the one I had renamed
  lrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel     62 18 Dec 11:57 temptexbin -> 
../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/\
Contents/Programs/ppc
which is still there of course (I would have been very very surprised 
if this one had disappeared...)

My system is Mac OS X 10.3.9, iBook G4

When I read your detailed previous message (thanks!) at first I thought 
I should have
replaced texbin to point to powerppc, rather than adding a "ppc" to 
.FactoryDefaults/gwTeX-2003-2005

but if the TeX Distributions Control Panel does create "ppc" links, 
then I think I did the correct thing

I hope the information I am sending can somehow give you a hint to what 
is happening,
if there is any special thing you would like me to check on my system 
please tell me

best regards
Jean-Francois

No selling => clearly nonfree.  ocrb is not in TL.

    (In Germany there even exists an industrial
     standard - DIN ????? - that describes the typefaces.
     Based on such material the input has been developed.)

In general, when a work is developed independently from public specs
like that, it cannot infringe copyright of another work.  And in this
specific case, when something has a public spec like this, presumably
the intent is to allow for independent implementations, and not grant a
monopoly to Adrian Frutiger for his particular OCR-B.

    1. Is the original license OK so that I can distribute PFB files
    created from them (mftrace runs metafont + potrace + fontforge)

You can surely distribute them under the same terms as the mf fonts,
which is fine for CTAN.

    2. What kind of free license will suit best to these Type1 fonts?

Using anything except the license of the original mf's is dubious.  One
could make an argument for being allowed to change the license, but that
will just induce questions.  I wouldn't go there.

    3. What is the proper place on CTAN where I should put it? The fonts
    directory already contains the ocr-b directory with the MF sources.

Well, Robin could answer more definitively, but I'd suggest
fonts/ocr-b-type1.

    4. Is someone willing to prepare higher quality OCR-B in Type-1 and
    possibly OpenType (with hinting etc)?

If someone wants to go that far, may I suggest that it would be even
more useful to develop a free ocr-b font from scratch (presumably from
the same specs) in OpenType, which is easy enough to convert to Type1
using fontforge.  Then it could be included in TL.

Another possibility would be to try to contact Norbert Schwarz and see
if he would be willing to use a free license.

The fonts _are_ in TL:

[wagner at hroch486 ~]$ kpsewhich ocrb10.mf
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/ean/ocrb10.mf
[wagner at hroch486 ~]$ kpsewhich ocrb10.tfm
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/ean/ocrb10.tfm

I would prefer if the fonts could be free. I have found only non-free
OCR-B in Type1 on the web.

Hello,

I am trying to get my latex up and running in a newly installed  
zenwalk linux box. However, apparently tikz cannot be installed  
automatically by the zenwalk package manager (netpkg), and so I have  
to do it by hand. However, I am relatively new to linux, and am having  
difficulty doing this.

I am running tetex on zenwalk. Should I persevere, or should I switch  
to texlive, or should I just ditch the whole operating system and  
start again with something like ubuntu, which I hear is a little  
easier to use for linux newbies?

Thanks,

You should first complain in a zenwalk discussion list.

Yes, TeX Live is a usable way. It installs everything by its own
packaging manager to a separate directory tree. You just have to add
the directory of the TL binaries to the BEGINNING of your PATH. I have
seen too many conflicts between teTeX and TeX Live, putting TeX Live
to the beginning of PATH is a remedy.

If it's really tetex, it has been unmaintained for years and its developer
suggests using TeXlive instead. :-)

I second what Zdenek suggested. Changing the operating system/distro just 
because of that issue you encountered would be a real overkill. And installing 
TeXLive from a DVD (or netinstall) has another benefit: TeXLive package manager 
(tlmgr), which you don't get when installing from distro's repos.

I don't know whether Ubuntu is easier to use.  Different Linux distros
come with different installers and different package management
systems, almost every distribution allows you to select the graphical
user interface of your choice.  Once you have the system installed,
you are running the same programs as in any other distribution.

There are a few important things to consider first: If a particular
distro doesn't provide all the software you need, you have to download
and compile it yourself.  This is not a big problem generally, but it
can be a lot of extra work if you have to maintain too many packages
yourself.  Thus, a distro which provides more packages itself is
preferable.

Another thing worth considering is whether you prefer a distro which
supports rolling releases, such as Gentoo or Arch Linux.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release

It seems that the TeX packages in Arch Linux are amazingly up-to-date.

I'm wondering why Zenwalk still provides teTeX at all, though they
claim to provide the "latest stable software".  I suppose that it's
due to lack of human resources, not due to stability.  teTeX was a
rather small subset of what is provided by TeX Live, and it's
discontinued for more than four years by now.

If you decide to stick with Zenwalk, I recommend to remove teTeX
(using the package manager) in order to avoid the problems Zdenek
mentioned.  Then you can safely install TeX Live using the network
installer.

It's certainly worthwhile to check which Linux distribution fits your
requirements best.  But I would do this *before* installing additional
software.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've never heard of such a document (but I'm not a member of the TeX Live team). For the sphack package, there was the additional complication that the style file was moved from the ltxmisc package to its own CTAN package. The CTAN team presumably re-checked the license during this process. Similar license checks might happen to many of the older packages that where created without the use of Docstrip and not thoroughly classified when they appeared on CTAN.

(Please post these questions to the list if you want answers).

THere is no such document but the license statements, on the DVD LICENSES.TL
and http://www.tug.org/texlive/copying.html

We will remove packages as soon as it is brought to our attention
that they do violate the copying conditions set forth there, basically
FSF and Debian guidelines, , with some exceptions.

The packages are still available on CTAN and can be installed from there.

additions and removals appear pretty much every day, without any
announcement.  additions are (almost always) related to a new free
package appearing on ctan -- the ctan-ann mailing list carries notices
about such things.

the classification is patchy.  i've done enormous numbers of them, and
often when i have a need to look at the package again, i come to a
different conclusion.  it's not an exact science, and in any case, the
rules are changing.

one particular bugbear is the package that contains no statement of its
licence.  the upload says "lppl" (or something) and at that time we're
left wondering whether that was a random stab of the mouse, or whether
the author had positive intent.  (in either case, a later review of the
package won't find any licence statement, so the package is re-
catalogued nonfree at that point.)

but there is, as philipp says, no published document saying what's
available, other than texlive.tlpdb, which lists everything in texlive.
one could in principle derive the information from successive releases
of that, but afaik nobody does.

Hi all,
when running tlmgr update -self -all I got the error message shown in
the subject. There were a few problems, error 500 from the server and
no space left in my /usr/local partition. Some packages were not
installed. If I make some space in /usr/local and run tlmgr update
-all, will the packages be installed or should I look what packages
failed and install them manually?

Agreed : any half-decent shredder will do the job,
and it also avoids the toxic gases that are
generated if you /do/ try to burn one ...

ls -l /usr/texbin
lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel  62B Sep 26 14:20 /usr/texbin@ \
-> ../Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/ppc

I have TL 2008, 2009, 2010 installed on a PPC. I needed to revert to TL
2008 and found it didn't work for this reason - because TL 2008 by
default only has a powerpc link. To solve the problem, I just added a
ppc link to the TL 2008 directory. But whatever went wrong in the
reported case evidently went wrong in my case also.

Not a big deal - the fix is easy and everything works fine - but just
to say it isn't (merely) a one-off.

Let me know if I can provide any further information. I created a
temporary texbin pointing to .../ppc and ran an adapted version of the
ln -fhs command and it correctly changed it to powerpc. So either
something odd is going on in this particular case of the postflight
script is not running that command for some reason. Which is to say
nothing at all, I realise.

Subject: [tex-live] Missing "ppc" symbolic link in

Message-ID: <5FF396EC-F33E-416B-BCC9-56023C8B2F50@math.uoregon.edu>

Just for the record, here is a full explanation.

MacTeX calls `/usr/bin/uname -p` to determine the processor. Intel machines
report back "i386" and ppc machines report "powerpc". MacTeX sets the symbolic link
/usr/texbin to  /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents/Programs/i386
or the same path ending in "powerpc", depending on the processor.

The TeX Distribution structure for a particular distribution has an entry named
"i386" pointing to its Intel binaries, and an entry named "powerpc" pointing to its ppc
binaries. Shortly after the structure was invented, a redundant entry named "ppc"
was added, also pointing to the ppc binaries. This redundant entry was missing
from Gerben's original teTeX structure, and perhaps from very early TeX Live
data.

Jerome Lauren's TeX Distribution Preference Panel notices when the link /usr/texbin
is missing, and offers to repair the link. (This can happen when upgrading the system.)
Unhappily, it repairs powerpc links using the redundant "ppc" rather than the original
"powerpc". Thus the repair works for recent distributions, but fails for some older ones.

We don't have the source code, so only Jerome can fix this. This
problem can only affect users with powerpc machines, and then only the small subset of such
users who might want to switch back to a considerably earlier distribution.

The error message comes from execuing tar or xzdec, one of the two.
Probably xzdec returning 2 when there is no space left.

Good question. I guess just simply calling 
	tlmgr update -all
should do the trick. The update procedure updates the tlpdb only at the
end, so in the worst case packages are installed once again.

If you want to be sure call
	tlmgr check all
and look out for strange things, asking here if there have been problems.

Best wishes

Can we get a fixed version this year, pretty please? Methinks the core

AFAIK, if you set LANG=C, other locale related environment variables
are still evaluated.  If you really don't want locale settings to
interfere with your program, it's better to set LC_ALL=C.

I'm sure Norbert knows that and knows how to fix tlmgr.

I mentioned it because, according to your previous mail, Norbert
proposed LANG=C, and because IMO the locale documentation leaves a lot
of room for improvements and the implementation is messy.

What does it mean it is not very clear???
It states which packages are due to be auto-removed, and which packages
are due to be updated, and which packages are due to auto-installed.

If you don't know the concept, please read the documentation of
tlmgr, section on "update".

It means that below the above directory there are files
present that are not listed in the texlive database
(texlive.tlpdb). Some of them are fine to not be listed,
like backups, others are just waste, or old probelms.

Hi, I just noticed that tlmgr has marked the package tree-dvips for  
deletion.  The package is still maintained as far as I know, and I'm  
sure there are many linguists who still use it.  Is there some way to  
find out the reason for the deletion?

Also, when tlmgr reports an updated collection, does that simply mean  
that some subpart of the collection has been added or removed?  (So  
the collection-humanities shows that it will be updated; is that  
because (among other things) tree-dvips is being deleted?

Thanks

Usually the cause for such sudden removals lies in license problems. In this case, there are no license information at all in the files uploaded to CTAN (http://ctan.org/pkg/tree-dvips), thus the package has to be classified as non-free. If you think the package should stay, I suggest asking the author whether she is willing to put the package under a free license.

I just committed the above change---an external Perl will be now used
only if variable

  TEXLIVE_WINDOWS_TRY_EXTERNAL_PERL=1

is explicitly set (in texmf.cnf or environment).

In the process, all Perl programs shipped with TL got tested and apart
from one they all seem to work, so an external Perl should be rarely
needed in practice.

that's already been amswered by philipp.

if you have contact with emma pease, it would be good if you could alert
her to the problem.  if (*big* if) we have a correct address for her,
she'll get mail eventually from one of the ctan or tl team.

i would assume so.  there's not much else in collections, afaict:
istm that they're nobbut programs for the installer.

Howdy,

I know folks deserve a rest over the holidays but I'm curious. I haven't had any updates to TL2010 via tlmgr for the last three days even though I've seen CTAN updates during that time period. I've been using the math.utah repository which seems to be alive and well.

Good Luck,

I was offline for the last few days.

Updates should resume tonight, though it will probably take me a couple
days to catch up with the backlog, as usual.
