Hi Scott,

How did you run it?
	perl ......./scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl
?

That tells me that you are not running it from
	bin/XXX-freebsd/tlmgr
but from texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgr.pl

That does not work, because tlmgr uses SELFAUTOPARENT (../..) to
fined tlpkg. Thus you end up with
	./../../tlpkg
in the search path, which is bad.

Karl: We have to push tlcritical to tlnet NOW!!! The problem is
that since the last push you added *-freebsd that made it
installable, but 
	texlive.infra.*-freebsd 
is NOT in tlnet for now!!!

The push will bring also the new GUI to everyone. if you want
you can undo the GUI commit (there were two) and then push, and
then I reapply the change.

Or we just push the new GUI, too, since the old is still available.

One more thing, after you have done the link stuff, please try
	tlmgr --repo ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical update --self
if that does not work, you have to get 
	ftp://tug.org/texlive/tlcritical/archive/texlive.infra.i386-freebsd.tar.xz
by hand, un-xz it, and untar it in /usr/local/texlive/2009 ...
the problem is that it also contains the xz/xzdec binary.

I did those.

    And good news for you Yvon: you don't have to change anything if you

Unfortunately not, since paresse and engpron also have .tds.zip versions
on CTAN.  So at Yvon's next release, either the .tds.zip should be
removed (my preference), or updated to eliminate the non-UTF-8 chars.

Sebastian was the principal perpetrator of TL for a couple more years

At any rate, fvrb-ex.dtx was evidently written by Denis Girou.  I'll

If I were the author I would not agree. Using ^^ is nothing but a
cryptic way of reaching the same result. Why don't you ask the authors
to write ^^5c^^70^^61^^72^^20 instead of \par? These are exactly the
same tokens (and you may add many more spaces or ^^20 or mixture of
them, TeX will not see them after a control sequence). Now what is the
meaning of ^^dd? It is the character with decimal code 221 in SOME
ENCODING. But which encoding? Nobody knows. If you open a file with
8-bit characters in a text editor, you will most likely see whether
the characters look OK or whether you see garbage. You can try iconv
to convert the file and if you have luck, you find in which encoding
the file was. If the file contains ^^dd, you know nothing. You may
convert it by iconv from any encoding to anything else, but you will
still see ^^dd. Using cryptic 8-bit encoding instead of human readable
8-bit encoding makes no sense.

No! \335 is \335 no matter what TCX table or whatever is used, ^^dd
may have different meaning in different environments.

We're not asking to ^^ every character, but only the >127 characters, so 
that they work the same way in 8-bit encodings (95% of the cases latin1) 
as in UTF-8.

The characters are not printed in the document, they are active 
characters to delimit text, and in latin1 (almost all the authors of 
such packages are french or german). See my examples given in the mail 
of yesterday, 16h57 Bucharest time.

I simply tried the given option and obtained an error message
(illegal verbosity level, or some such), accompanied By the help
text. There was no -V nor --version listed, but I tried -V anyway,
reasoning that Manuel probably knew his options but could easily
mistype one.

Message-ID: <6d52a0f61001011532x33b83c70qa704394886da850e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

when I run "dvips -K1" from current texlive-2009 it removes a newline
after %%BeginFont: command, e.g.  a figure which has

%%BeginFont: MC1_ArialBold
12 dict begin
/FontInfo 8 dict dup begin
...

will be included in the dvips -K1 generated postscript as

%%BeginFont: MC1_ArialBold12 dict begin
/FontInfo 8 dict dup begin
...

which is obviously wrong and results in invalid postscript.

Similarly the font cmr10.pfb
(texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/amsfonts/cm/cmr10.pfb)

which has this header section
...
% available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL.
%%EndComments

FontDirectory/CMR10 known{/CMR10 findfont dup/UniqueID known{dup
....

is included as

...
% available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL.
%%EndComments
FontDirectory/CMR10 known{/CMR10 findfont dup/UniqueID known{dup
...

so the newline after %%EndComments seems to have been eaten, in this
case without adverse effect.

Minimal sample file:

> cat t.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphics}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{Dvss2T02.EPS}
\end{document}


figure is attached to this email

Cheers

I have to disagree on this point.

\catcode`\?=13 \def?{something}

produces a compile error with both XeTeX and LuaTeX, while

\catcode`\^^a3=13 \def^^a3{something}

works fine with both.

So, *if* the >127 characters are used only as delimiter or whatever *without*
any "real-character" semantics (proper lowercase/uppercase, proper
representation by a glyph in a font, etc), and without the user needigin to use
the same character in his source (possibly using a different encoding) then
everything is ok.

AFAIU, most packages discussed here are in this case.

Manuel.

Exactly. This is why such changes are helpful -- I dealt with a few cases back in the much earlier days of xetex (url.sty comes to mind as a package that I remember was affected).

The explanation, in case it's not obvious, is that a ^^ sequence such as ^^a3 is converted during input scanning directly to the *Unicode character code* U+00A3 within xetex (and similarly, I assume, for luatex). It is *not* converted to a byte code which is then subject to codepage or encoding form conversion.

Therefore, it is significantly different from encountering the *byte* 0xA3 within the input data, in which case UTF-8 conversion will be applied (and will fail, in this example).

In other words, ^^ forms represent character codes, not bytes. That's why it makes sense to allow them to extended to ^^^321, ^^^^abcd, or even ^^^^^^101234, etc.

Message-ID: <8773c0f21001011728l6c85b7d8j25f6fd8ea3c4544@mail.gmail.com>

This past January (2009) I picked up a TeX Live DVD at the Joint Math
Meetings.  This December I finally tried installing it on my netbook, which
of course doesn't have a DVD drive.  My solution was to copy it off of the
DVD to an external hard drive, and use that.

The machine for copying runs Windows XP.

Every attempt to install TeX Live from the external hard drive to the
netbook failed, despite following all the documentation available,
supplemented by significant web searching.

Finally I found a 12-hour block of time in which the 2009 version of TeX
Live could be downloaded (it actually took 11), and it worked perfectly the
first time.

My working hypothesis for the failure of the 2007 distribution is that the
XP machine didn't include the Rock Ridge data in the copying process, though
I'm afraid I do not know how I could confirm this.  If this is the case,
perhaps an explicit warning to this effect in the documentation is
warranted.

Thank you.

I assume that the XP machine at least understands the Joliet
extensions, which are supported by the DVD.  But I already encountered
severe problems with file systems like "cifs".  Under which operating
system is your netbook running and which file system does it use?
Which file system do you have on your external disk?  I fear it's a
braindead one if Windows is able to write to it.  Do you remember any
error messages?

Regards,
  Reinhard

I checked, and DEP was not the issue.  In the end, running BitDefender
anti-virus live protection was the issue.  I had contacted BitDefender,
and their suggestion to me was that I remove Google Desktop.  Well, I
don't have Google Desktop.  Here's what I wrote them:

<gsk_to_bitdefender>
I do not have Google Desktop.

I temporarily turned off BitDefender's live protection and then was
able to install TeX Live 2009 without problems.  TeX Live 2009 is a
set of programs I (and many others) trust.  Apparently you
(BitDefender) had an issue with the version of Perl they were running
off their CD.
</gsk_to_bitdefender>

P.S.  Independently, Strawberry Perl, which had not worked ten days
ago, managed to start working even before I turned BitDefender off.
Maybe it just needed a certain number of Windows reboots.  Or maybe
Windows was in a better mood after the Christmas holiday.

I have not tried to use my DVD yet, so I am adding the texlive list to
the CC. I know this is not exactly about TeXLive, but I do not know who
else to contact.

Most external hard drives come formatted with a simple filesystem that
can be used by many OS's.  If you use exclusively Windows XP and later,
it makes sense to convert external drives to NTFS format.

You don't mention the OS of the netbook.  With a windows netbook you can
share a DVD directly via the network from a Windows machine: "right click on

With a linux netbook it should be possible to put a image of the DVD on an
external drive and mount using the loop device.

There has also been some discussion of copying an install from from one
system to another or sharing TL on a network server.

Dead link. It is part of TeXLive 2009 but texdoc cmdtrack returns nothing as

locate cmdtrack
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/latex/cmdtrack
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/latex/cmdtrack/cmdtrack.dtx
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/latex/cmdtrack/cmdtrack.ins
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmdtrack
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmdtrack/cmdtrack.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2009/tlpkg/tlpobj/cmdtrack.tlpobj


There is a minor problem with cmdtrack.dtx

So I copy message to texlive asking them to produce documentation

We don't produce documentation, we take it from CTAN. I've just uploaded a
compiled version cmdtrack.pdf to cambridge's incoming. Exceptionnaly, I've
installed in in TL without waiting for it to arrive on CTAN.

it's now on ctan (cambridge -- the other two sites any minute now, and
then the mirrors on a more relaxed timescale).

in cases where the author isn't contactable (in this case, except by
ouija board), or cases where i can't persuade the author it's useful, i
will generate docs and put them on ctan.

i have announced this fact, but i don't (of course) expect anyone read
the announcement.  (but it does provide a backup against authors who
maintain "if it was difficult to write, it should be difficult to use".)

Message-ID: <751DC606-EDC3-4F98-B8F7-461722DCBC5F@googlemail.com>

Hi,

after installation of TeX Live 2009 under 9.10, I would like to update the TeX Live Manager itself and the TeX distribution via the gui. Therefore, I tried

sudo tlmgr --gui

because of appropriate user privileges for the TeX Live directory. In contrast to a working

tlmgr --gui

the variation with sudo returns

sudo: tlmgr: command not found

How could I use the tlmgr with the appropriate user rights?


Best,

Well, then the PATH for root is not set up to search the texlive bin dir.

> How could I use the tlmgr with the appropriate user rights?

How did you set up the path for yourself? Did you as user adjust 
something like putting
	PATH=..../2009/bin/aaa-bbb:$PATH
into your .bashrc? Or did you symlink the binaries into $HOME/bin, or
something else?

That are in fact quite TeX unrelated questions, it is about checking
the environment of root. You could do
	sudo env
and see the output for PATH and other settings.

Hi

I've been using TexLive2009 for a while and quite happy with its LaTeX part.
Currently I'm learning to use Context but I can't get any response from
texexec and texmfstart command even no error message. I use gdb debugger to
monitor their execution and gdb tell me "Program exited with code
037777777777." My machine is a Dell Latitude D830 running windows 7
32bit.Does anyone has the same problem or knows the solution?

Thanks in advance.

I installed it with the user (chrisp) which was I created during installation and the following sudo command

sudo ./install-tl -gui wizard

from DVD.

After TeX Live installation, I modified the

.bashrc

of chrisp and added

PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux:\$PATH

> That are in fact quite TeX unrelated questions, it is about checking

This gives for the PATH settings

PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

This means, I think, either to add the right PATH setting to the .bashrc of root or change the privileges of the user chrisp?

What would you suggest as the best way and how could it be done?

And how should root then find tlmgr?

Best would be to add the TeX Live stuff to the general path for all
users, or, if there is anyway only chrisp and root, add it to the 
PATH of root in its .bashrc.

> What would you suggest as the best way and how could it be done?

As said, if it is single as in  single single user, then you could
have installed it as user anyway.

Now you have to add that dir to root path, maybe only temporarily:
	sudo bash
	export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
	tlmgr update --self --all

How could the first point be achieved? I would like to know the way to add the TeX Live stuff to a general path for all users.

No idea how that should be done best for all users and all shells ...

/etc/login.defs
	for console logins I assume that is the best place

No idea where it is set for [gkx]dm (add you preferred display manager
here). That are questions for Ubuntu or user guides of Ubuntu

Assuming you installed in the default location, you can do

sudo chown -R chrisp /usr/local/texlive

and then, without changing anything to root's environment, simply run tlmgr as
chris (without sudo). This way, the user crhisp is the administrator of the TL
installation.

That's what I recommend (and personnaly use) for single-user machines.

Subject: [tex-live] dviout hangs/fails when calling gswin32(c)
Message-ID: <4B4079D5.8060905@gmx.net>

Hello,

in de.comp.text.tex a user reported problems with dviout under Windows 7
x64 when viewing DVI files generated from LaTeX source that includes EPS
graphics. I was able to confirm that problem (using Windows Vista x64)
and I have been asked to summarize my findings for this list.

dviout calls Ghostscript to convert EPS files into bitmaps for display.
However, gswin32 (used by default) simply hangs, thus also causing
dviout to hang. gswin32c fails with an error message, which I quoted
below. (Note that while the error message is from a portable version of
TL2009, the problem also occurs with the version installed on HD.)

I noticed that the path mentioned in the error message
(E:\tlpkg\tlgs\Resource) does not exist. Removing the reference to this
path from the dviout wrapper shipped with TL (bin\win32\dviout.bat, the
line setting the environment variable GS_LIB) resolved the problem both
for me and for the user asking for help.

hello all

I've just update texlive2009 and discovered that neither paresse.sty nor

latex chokes on it.
Moreover, the code examples are totaly useless.

So I would like you to make them both entirely disappear from ctan and 
hence from texlive.

So are you the maintainer of these packages?

If not, then you could:
- provide working examples
- fix the current examples
- just ignore the problem

but not in *any* way request the removal ... 

Next I request the removal of the operating system of your computer,
would be about as justified as your request.

Best wishes

AFAICS you are the author of those packages.

Don't you see a way to fix those problems? This would be much a better
solution than simply trashing your work.

Should you insist on the disappearance of your packages then it might be
better to contact the CTAN maintainers rather than the TL developers
(who basically package what is on CTAN). If a package gets deleted from
CTAN then I think it will be deleted from TL in a row.

Hello,

the examples of paresse gives errors because ?D^?a_?d in the .dtx file 
has been replaced by ^^a7D^^^a7a_^^a7d  in the .tex file, which gives an 
error. If I regenerate the example file in latex base mode, then 
everything works OK with the ^^ified .sty; so the .sty is ok, only the 
example is wrong. But I didn't see any error in engpron...

> Moreover, the code examples are totaly useless.

That's true. Is there a way to fix this in TeX Live (using base LaTeX 
mode for paresse.dtx -> examples.tex and the ^^ mode for paresse.dtx -> 
paresse.sty)? Otherwise Yvon would you accept a patch (removing the 
examples from the .dtx, as they are on the ctan anyway)?

> So I would like you to make them both entirely disappear from ctan and

I see no reason why such extreme measures should be taken...

Hi Cristian,
what you did is correct.  Since gs version 8.63 the Resource directory
is removed and its content compiled into the binary.  But with the
current setting of GS_LIB the files are still searched in the file
system, which explains the error.  I assume that the dviout
installation instructions were not adapted.

Thanks for reporting the bug,
  Reinhard

In Kubuntu, under

System Settings -> Advanced -> File Associations -> application -> pdf

I have okular as the first viewer.

Typing

texdoc texdoc

gives this warning message

but correctly shows the texdoc documentation in an okular window. 
Likewise for other packages.

This message is not emitted by texdoc. Either it is a "normal" message by Okular
or some other KDE app, or I'm not calling kde-open directly.

As far as it works, I'm inclined to think the warning can be ignored (some GUI
programs tend to produce a lot of output when run from the command line).

Subject: [tex-live] serious `slovak' Babel bug
Message-ID: <20100104.085051.55848254.wl@gnu.org>


Folks,


is it useful today to report Babel bugs to the LaTeX bug database?  Does
anybody take care of answering them or even fixing issues?

Here's a quite serious bug:

  \documentclass{article}

  \usepackage[slovak,USenglish]{babel}

  \begin{document}

  ^^78

  \end{document}

  ===>

    ! Missing $ inserted.
    <inserted text>
                    $
    l.7 ^
         ^78
    ?

It might be acceptable that the ^^xx notation fails within a Slovakian
language environment since the circumflex has been made a shorthand,
but this is not the case here.

Note that the `esperanto' and `kurmanji' language modules fail
similarly.  Especially in the light of the recent discussion of using
the ^^xx notation instead of `real' 8bit character codes it's quite
important IMHO to fix this problem.

[A CJK user reported this issue to me.  For the CJK package, which
 heavily relies on ^^xx working correctly, a workaround is to insert

   \catcode`\^ 7\relax

 right before starting a CJK environment.]

This is a general babel behaviour: the catcodes of the various
shorthands are not reset at language switches. I reported this in
comp.text.tex some month ago
(http://groups.google.de/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/86d6d296ae28016e?fwc=1)

In some cases it is enough to use \shorthandoff. In other (like
yours) you must explicitly reset the catcode 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[czech,%make - active
            slovak,USenglish]{babel}
\begin{document}
%\catcode`\-=12
\shorthandoff{-}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
a & b\\\cline{1-2}
\end{tabular}

\catcode`\^=7
%\shorthandoff{^} 
^^74

\end{document}

>  Especially in the light of the recent discussion of using

> important IMHO to fix this problem.

Well I doubt a bit that many users use ^^xx in the document, and ^
in math works still fine.

Well, the `latin' language module shows how to handle it in a graceful

A bug is a bug is a bug.  At least it should be documented!

I know about it. ^ is used as a shorthand so that if a user is not
able to type the character on the keyboard, it is possible to type
just ^o instead of \^{o}. The definition is smart, it handles math
correctly but the problem is that ^^78 is handled by the "TeX mouth",
i.e. cannot be handled by macros. Slovak.ltx was deveoped by Petr
Tesarik. He wrote me that he took this feature from an older version
of slovak.sty and included it just not to break compatibility with
legacy documents. I personally do not like ^ as a shorthand character
but Slovak users should say whether they need it or whether we can
remove it.

This problem does not impact on the ^^ified packages:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{fvrb-ex}
\usepackage[slovak,USenglish]{babel}
\usepackage{paresse}
\begin{document}
test
\end{document}

still works with the ^^ified packages.

Thank you,

Message-ID: <CB7D3446-30E2-4966-B9CB-688FF2504F00@gmail.com>

Dear list,

It seems that the last achemso update[1] deleted the achemso bibtex style files (). The then empty texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/achemso/ directory was removed at rev. 16457.

It seems to me that this is a mistake; for one thing, it breaks currently working sources using the achemso package and bibtex. Moreover, the achemso.dtx file still mention these bst files, so they really should be included:

> \usedir{bibtex/bst/achemso}
> \generate{
>   \file{achemso.bst}{\from{\jobname.dtx}{bst}}
>   \file{biochem.bst}{\from{\jobname.dtx}{bst,bio}}
> }


Please revert the offending change!

Thanks,
FX

Sure, I do not need it in normal documents, but I had to write a macro

Or CJK can probably be made more robust. It already defines
\CJK at input for the catcode of `<', thus saving/setting/restoring
the catcode of `^' can easily be added.

This is my fault. I've sent CTAN an updated version of the TDS zip to 
fix this. (Trying to be more efficient always gets me into trouble, it 
seems.)

Not really. E.g in the following example latex simply hangs if I
don't uncomment the \ProsodicMarksOff:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[latin,english]{babel}
\languageattribute{latin}{withprosodicmarks}
\begin{document}
\selectlanguage{latin}
\ProsodicMarksOn ^ia

\selectlanguage{english}
%\ProsodicMarksOff
abc ^^74

\end{document}

I'm not sure whether it can be done better.  However, the
documentation mentions catcode issues, so Joe User has probably a
better chance to identify the problem here.

It is caused by the way how babel handles shorthands. Within
\AtBeginDocument tha \catcode is set to 13 but it expands to the same
character with the original catcode. If you switch the feature for
which you need the character (some \languageattribute etc), the
defiition of the active character is changed accordingly.

Now assume you have $a^2$. If the feature is not activated, TeX sees ^
with category 13 which is expanded to ^ with category 7, so everything
works. If the feature is active, the expansion includes \ifmmode so
that in math we get again ^ with category 7. The case of ^^78 is more
difficult. TeX mouth is looking for two identical characters with
category 7 followed by two hex digits. However, the category of ^ is
now 13 so that they go to the TeX stomach. If the feature is inactive,
TeX will find ^ with category 7 out of math, if it is active,
something unexpected happens. The definition should be able to find
the next character and two hex digits and emulate TeX mouth inside TeX
stomach...

ime, most "joe user" type people will turn off when encountering the
phrase "catcode issues".  they may be commonplace to many readers of
this list, but an ordinary latex-user-in-the-street wouldn't encounter a
catcode change from one year's end to the next.  (what latex books
have catcodes listed in the index? -- none that i have available to me,
and neither lshort nor "beginning latex" mentions it either.)

anyway, istm that we are reaching the limit of what babel can reasonably
do: it's an inherently 7-bit system (extended to 8 bits by inputenc/
fontenc), but we're discussing an interaction between its 7-bit hacks
and the needs of engines using unicode input.

that said, i remember being worried by the use of ^^ in tex, when i
first read about it (it seemed a syntax overload too far, even then).
given that i would have been reading that stuff more than 20 years ago,
i reckon, ^^ has had a pretty good run for its money.

Yes, in fact the .dtx generates files with ? if compiled with 'latex 
paresse.ins', but it generates files with ^^a7 if compiled with 'latex 
-translate-file=empty.tcx paresse.ins', and this will be used in TeX Live.

Yes it's ok, in fact I said we needed TeX instead of LaTeX because I 
didn't know the '-translate-file=empty.tcx' option, now there is nothing 
to change.

Ok, many thanks! Can a CTAN maintainer install it?

Thanks a lot for that.
I have to say that I was really appaled to see what came from the 
paresse-ex-fr.tex.
Fortunately, I've managed to sleep on it and I can agree with you now 
all the more because of the archive you've send to me.

I've got nonetheless some questions : is the issue of the non 7bit-ascii 
compliant code solved ? I see ? in the dtx.
I've managed to force the use of latex (or more precisely to prevent

agreed, very nice

I have one request though, I use a netbook, and thus have a display that 
aren't that high (do not remember the details).

On my screen the action buttons (Update, install ...) get so narrow that 
one cannot read the text on the buttons.

Is it possible for it to detect short display and adjust it self 
accordingly? Like adding an overall scrollbar at one edge?

Well, it was announced that the new GUI will hang some time in tlcritical,
and that we will push it soon ;-)

For those in need, the old GUI is still in tlmgr gui-old (or old-gui)

It is *really* to high for you netbook, what resolution does it have?
I tried to minimize the height since also my notebook is not really
big in that one, but yours seems to be much smaller.

Ok, that is suboptimal.

I will try ... adding overall scrollbars is unfortunately a pain, I

I think it is equivalent to a MSI Wind (it is a Medion netbook). 10" 
screen, of about 1024 by 600 pixels.

thanks. In my case it isn't that important since I usually use the CMD, 
but there might be other people working on netbooks.

Probably it is time to update asymptote: TL is stuck on 188 while svn
is 1.92svn-r4792  so 1.91 is a release.

600 pixels is quite small indeed. But tlmgr could probably fit without
using scrollbars if you the list of packages was independently
resizeable.

this is irrelevant: what counts is what the asymptote people have
uploaded to ctan.  as it happens, they _have_ uploaded 1.91

given that tl release requires builds on zillions of architectures, it's
not surprising that tl is lagging behind ctan.  aiui, binaries for many
of those architectures have to be built by contributors, which would
presumably add to the unpredictability of the delay.

Yes - here I agree 150% - what I build on MacOSX10.6.2 intel MacPro
fails with "bad CPU architecture" on MacOSX10.6.2 intel with Dual Core
(but not Dual Core II processor) MacBookPro :-(

As a general rule, don't expect updates to the binaries between two versions of
TeX Live.

I believe TeX Live has not released x86_64 binaries for Mac OS X yet,
did you happened to build it with x86_64 as the default architecture?
You can check it with 'file' command.

Yes - I know this. It is just to emphasize that "zillions" was rather

I don't grok it, we *never* released version upgrades for binaries
in the normal process by now... What is it that you want to say?

Rather opposite:

[Tue Sep 29 02:53:47 2009] update: asymptote.x86_64-linux (15222 -> 15538)
[Mon Oct 5 08:39:00 2009] update: asymptote.x86_64-linux (15538 -> 15633)
[Tue Oct 6 06:09:11 2009] update: asymptote.x86_64-linux (15633 -> 15653)
[Wed Nov 18 03:27:17 2009] update: asymptote.x86_64-linux (15653 -> 16044)

May be because it was before TL2009 release?

Hi,
I have two files pstricks-add.tex. One in
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pstricks-add/

and another one in
/usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/tex/latex/pstricks-add/

a "kpsewhich pstricks-add.tex" finds the one in the main
tex tree:

voss at shania:~> kpsewhich pstricks-add.tex
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pstricks-add/pstricks-add.tex

my local pstricks-add.tex will only be found before the one
in the main tree, when it is saved in the ../tex/generic part
of my local tree. But in the past kpsewhich found *.tex files,
saved in ../texmf-local/tex/latex/.., always _before_ those,
which are in the main ../tex/generic/.. part.

Message-ID: <db69205d1001050246oe0efccdp8afd880b82696318@mail.gmail.com>

I've recently installed jnovy's Fedora packages of TeX Live 2009 and
the process went great except for one little snag I've hit so far.

I've got some random tex files laying around that I used successfully
with xelatex from texlive 2007 and 2008, but I was getting a weird
error with the new 2009 installation, and going over the TeX logs it
became apparent that the LatinModern package wasn't installed as a
dependency for fontspec or latex or xetex. Once I installed the
texlive-lm package, my documents started formatting properly (hooray!)

I'm definitely not an expert at this by any means, and I have no idea
which package specifically should be depending on lm, but jnovy says
that his package dependencies are sourced from the upstream
texlive.tlpdb file, so if someone could fix that so that idiots like
me don't have to figure out that the lm package is missing.... that
would be awesome.

Thanks for the work on TeX!

That might be, but the lmodern fonts are in collection-fontsrecommended,
thus if you want more than a bare-bone xetex (or tex or pdftex) you
should install the *recommended collections, or what relates to them
in Fedora.

xetex itself definitely does *not* depend on lm.
xelatex neither.
fontspec *might* default to lmodern, but pulling in automatically
all of collection-fontdrecommended is not a good idea.

So what it boils down is that we do *NOT* check on single package
cross dependencies. That means, if you are packaging each texlive
package into one distribution package you have to check yourself
what are the dependencies.

That might btw be a discussion better discussed on the tldistro mailing
list.

Done that, the list will be the first to be resized. Either use tlcritical
from tomorrow, or use the attached tlmgrgui.pl and replace the one in
	YOUR_TEXLIVE_ROOT/2009/texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl

If you could test it it would be nice. I resized my screen to 800x600

This is intended (new in texdoc 0.60, IIRC). They are displayed by 'texdoc -s'
which show results considered less relevant by the scoring system.

(Arguably the order is wrong, texdoc/News should come as the third result.)

If you want files without extension to be shown by -l, add a line like

badext_list = # (empty list)

in you texdoc.cnf. (Default is that 'txt' and no extension are "bad".)

> and such esoteric as
> README.eurosans

This is another problem. texdoc filters by extension, since a lot of non-doc
files end up in the doc trees. Here texdoc sees 'eurosans' as the extension,
which is not on the list of allowed extensions, so the file is not selected at all.

I don't understand. Listed where?

Concerning ChangeLog etc, I tend to think it's better not to show them with -l
but only with -s by default, unless a lot of users say they disagree, and you
can change that locally of you want.

Concerning README.foobar, I'll need to make a special case for it in the code.

Thanks for your feedback,

And how should root then find tlmgr?

Best would be to add the TeX Live stuff to the general path for all
users, or, if there is anyway only chrisp and root, add it to the 
PATH of root in its .bashrc.

> What would you suggest as the best way and how could it be done?

As said, if it is single as in  single single user, then you could
have installed it as user anyway.

Now you have to add that dir to root path, maybe only temporarily:
	sudo bash
	export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
	tlmgr update --self --all

Well, then the PATH for root is not set up to search the texlive bin dir.

How did you set up the path for yourself? Did you as user adjust 
something like putting
	PATH=..../2009/bin/aaa-bbb:$PATH
into your .bashrc? Or did you symlink the binaries into $HOME/bin, or
something else?

That are in fact quite TeX unrelated questions, it is about checking
the environment of root. You could do
	sudo env
and see the output for PATH and other settings.

Assuming you installed in the default location, you can do

sudo chown -R chrisp /usr/local/texlive

and then, without changing anything to root's environment, simply run tlmgr as
chris (without sudo). This way, the user crhisp is the administrator of the TL
installation.

That's what I recommend (and personnaly use) for single-user machines.

I have run across this, too. In fact, I noticed that kpsewhich
was finding a different file than tex was actually using.

The reason for this is that when you use kpsewhich without
specifying a program name, the bare TEXINPUTS variable is used,
which, in the default texmf.cnf, is set to
    .;$TEXMF/tex/{$progname,generic,}//
Thus, /tex/kpsewhich/ (usually nonexistent) is checked first
in all trees (texmf-local usually before texmf-dist) and then
tex/generic/ (in all trees), and then other subdirectories of
/tex/, including latex.

I rather dislike this behavior, but it is hard to say what
ought to be the default value for TEXINPUTS. I myself get
around this by defining the TEXINPUTS.kpsewhich variable,
set to
    .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,latex,generic,}//
since that is the order I usually want. And when I want to
emulate some other tex binary, I use kpsewhich with the
--progname option.

If you use latex, then, because TEXINPUTS.latex is
   .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//
you will get latex searched before generic and your local
version will be used. Ideally, if you want to maintain
local versions that preempt distributed versions, it is
best to maintain them in parallel locations. (In my case,
it was a problem with duplicated filenames for completely
different files.)

I really don't know what the behavior of kpsewhich was before
TL2009, since I never encountered such a problem before.

Message-ID: <4B444902.6030305@morningstar2.co.uk>

Hello all,

I've just tried the new tlmgr GUI for the first time On Windows 7, and I 
notice a slight issue. To work properly, it needs to be run as 
Administrator but, perhaps because it is a vbs script, this is not an 
option if I right-click on the Start Menu entry. I can start up Command 
Prompt as the Administrator and do "tlmgr -gui", but that seems rather 
counter-intuitive. Any thoughts, or am I missing something obvious?

we have a lot of those:

  $ grep README FILES.byname | grep -v README$ | wc
      325    1625   22289

and mostly (when they come to our notice) we rename them to just README

however, we can't always be quite so cavalier.  for example:

2000/05/16 |      38950 | fonts/psfonts/polish/antp/README.ENG
2000/05/16 |      39227 | fonts/psfonts/polish/antp/README.POL

obviously can't both be renamed; there are other packages where there
are multiple READMEs that can't be treated simplistically like
README.eurosans

and what do we do about

2009/12/28 |      45472 | macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/README
2009/12/28 |     297417 | macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/README.pdf

which are separately listed as hyperref doc in the catalogue.

would it be possible for texdoc to grok the documentation entries in the
catalogue?  i could process the catalogue into pretty much anything
manuel would like, if it is of any use.

kpsewhich has been working this way for a very long time, the problem
started more that 15 years ago when LaTeX 2.09 and 2e used files with
the same name but different contents. Now the kpathsea library
recognizes not only the format but also engine.

It looks like you installed texdoc from Debian packages. Here, the detection
mechanism is overridden by a directive in the configuration file setting the
viewer to 'see', as it is the standard command for opening documents in Debian.

Sure.

Yes, there's already code for this in the development version of texdoc. More
precisely, texdoc gets the info from the texlive database, which in turn gets
info from the catalogue. (The point is that the directory components on CTAN,
hence in the catalogue entries, doesn't always match those in TL: even the
package name can differ.) So, the good news is, you don't need to worry about
processing it into a format.

Currently the idea is as follows: get all the entries in "docfiles" from the
database. It's rather crude. The next step is to use the metadata. The bad news
is, the content of the details attribute is free text, which is quite hard to
analyse the right way in texdoc. For example, "FAQ formatted for letter paper" :-)

I wonder if it would be feasable to add an attribute like "type" which would
take its values in a finite, well-determined set like
- usr : usr manual
- dev : commented source etc
- readme : readme files and the like
- ex : example document
- test : test document
- main : the main document(s), for documentation-only packages
- whatever proves to be useful.

While we're at it, it would also be useful if the language info was always
separated in its own attribute and also normalized.

I'm aware it probably means a lot of work. Actually, I've been planning to talk
with you (the catalogue team) about it for quite some time, but I wanted to
investigate more closely, and maybe propose a helper script, etc. But since you
raised the question...

Anyway, if you think the idea is interesting and need help in order to do these
quite extensive changes, I'd be glad to help (either with ideas, code, patches,
whatever is most convenient for you).

Manuel.

Do you mean, that the old GUI didn't require elevation? Does the
problem occur only with our tlmgr-gui.vbs or all vbs scripts?

Hello Tomek,

I did not try to old GUI on Windows 7, sorry (I've only tried the GUI at 
all as I saw the info about the new interface).

On the VBS question, trying an arbitrary VBS file shows the same: the 
Windows right-click menu does not include "Run as administrator" or "Run 
as different user".

That would be worth checking. You can get the old one with:

tlmgr gui-old

In fact, could you also check:

tlmgr gui
tlmgr -version

all from unelevated command prompt. I would like to know what actually
triggers the elevation.

What I meant to ask is whether other vbs scripts require elevation on
your system or only ours (this could be some security setting).

We are in the process of replacing some wrapper scripts, so I might as
well replace tlmgr-gui.vbs with tlmgr-gui.exe but I would like to know
first if it will solve anything.

Cheers,

Tomek

Absolutely right, because this is the way to get zipped support and
the correct treatment using the mime types database.

> No, 'see' is used. Look at its man page for how to configure it.

see uses whatever is the preferred mime type application, please see
the man pages of
	update-mime
and
	mailcap.order
how to configure that.

My mailcap.order for examples contains:
	evince:*/*
because I want to use evince for all viewing it supports.

Hmmm, no. texdoc opens pdfs here on KDE4 now with okular. However, setting a 
different default application for pdf has no effect. So, while

$ kde-open blabla.pdf 

opens blabla.pdf now in, let say gv, a 

$ texdoc texdoc 

still opens the pdf in okular. So it seems for me, that not kde-open is used 
here, but okuar explicitly?

Hi,

I am trying to install TL 2009 on Vista using the
install-tl-advanced.bat. I uncheck the languages that are not
required, toggle letter-paper to yes, toggle registry path to No,
toggle, file associations to No, and hit the install button. After all
the downloading the installer hangs at the following:

running packages specific postactions

and nothing happens after that. The log file is practically empty.

The attached image is with default specs (other than the path). Any clue?

as marked in your screenshot I suppose that the path to your MikTeX-perl
could be the problem ...

Subject: [tex-live] miniltx.tex is broken
Message-ID: <20100107110626.GB6624@varese>

Hi,

 the file miniltx.tex is broken. It is missing the definition for
filename at simple (see output below this mail). I found out that the
suggested fix in this mail:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2009-September/022670.html

has only partly been applied (apparently done on 2010/01/02): The
second definition in that mail:

  \def\filename at simple#1.#2\\{%
    \ifx\\#2\\%
       \let\filename at ext\relax
    \else
       \edef\filename at ext{\filename at dot#2\\}%
    \fi
    \edef\filename at base{#1}}
  \def\filename at dot#1.\\{#1}

is missing in miniltx.tex and that makes it impossible to render my
plain tex documents with \includegraphics from the graphicx package.

Adding these lines to the miniltx.tex file (and replacing the at)
makes everything work again on my machine.

No, that's not a problem with MikTeX-perl. The
install-tl[-advanced].bat wrapper makes sure that the installer uses
our Perl.

The output in command prompt suggest a problem in the menu group
(directory) creation. Most likely there is no write access there. My
guess would be that the installer runs in the user mode but tries to
create shortcuts for all users (requires admin). No idea why this
could happen, though. Siep, Norbert, any ideas?

@kap4lin: It might be useful to see the full output from the command
prompt. You could run the installer from the command line and redirect
its output to file:

  install-tl-advanced.bat > install-texlive.log

and send us the resulting file. To cut down on installation time, you
can install only the minimal set of packages. On a more general note:
you need TL binaries on the path before MiKTeX's ones for things to
work (you can use tl-portable.bat and start programs from the command
line if you don't want to set this permanently).

Cheers,

Tomek

I added another feature, currently available from tomorrow on in
tlcritical, that allows resizing the log window in the bottom. There
will be a resize handle.

Subject: [tex-live] dvips can't find font
Message-ID: <20100107171510.GE695@varese>

Hi,

 I'm having problems with dvips with a custom installed font (Adobe
Syntax) on my Ubuntu 8.10 system with tex-live.

xdvi displays the .dvi file fine. Running dvips gives me this:

  kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+120/600 --dpi 720 psxr8r
  mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for psxr8r.

The relevant entry in my file syntax.map (residing in $texmf/fonts/map/fontname/) is:

  psxr8r Syntax-Roman " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <psxr8a.pfa

running 'updmap-sys --listmaps' shows me the file "syntax.map" is
included.

I installed all tfm, vf and type1 files in the correct locations (with
the correct canonisized names) and created a file
/etc/texmf/updmap.d/10local.cfg

with the following contents:

  Map scala_sans.map
  Map scala_serif.map
  Map syntax.map

Then I ran 'texconfig rehash' and 'update-updmap'.

As I said, xdvi finds the font. Any ideas what I could check? The
other custom installed scala fonts seem to work fine.

    Any ideas what I could check? 

The file which dvips is ultimately looking at is psfonts.map.
Try running kpsewhich psfonts.map and look at that file.
This is the file which is generated by updmap[-sys].

  psxr8r Syntax-Roman " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <psxr8a.pfa

Also run kpsewhich psxr8a.pfa and be sure that file can be found.

Good luck,

Sorry about my stupidity.

I installed more of the code and actually tested it this time.  Maybe it
works now.

I didn't apply that fix as-is because it didn't exactly correspond to
the current LaTeX source.  Using the actual LaTeX code seemed like a
better plan.  We'll see ...

On my win7 VM the menu entries are added to the user menu, but in
the past, we have had other reports of inexplicable lack of write
access.

I ditched my virtual Vista and botched the admin account on my
virtual win7, so ATM I cannot test what happens if an administrator
tries a user install.

You could add a '-v' option to get more output:

....\install-tl-advanced -v >install-texlive.log 2>&1

Did you call
	updmap-sys
as root?

update-updmap *only* updates the updmap.cfg file, but does not update
the actual psfonts.map itself.

That is documented in TeX-on-Debian.

(same like tlmgr generate updmap does)

Yes, that is the case.

I ran install-tl twice:

(1) with "option_desktop_integration 0" in the profile file which
installed (minimal-scheme) TL fine (see the following tailend output):

------------------
pre-generating all format files (fmtutil-sys --all), be patient...done
running package specific postactions
D:running postaction=install for dviout.win32
D:running postaction=install for texlive-common
D:running postaction=install for texlive.infra
D:running postaction=install for tlpsv.win32
finished with package specific postactions

 See
   C:/Users/Public/texlive/2009/index.html
 for links to documentation.  The TeX Live web site (http://tug.org/texlive/)
 contains any updates and corrections.

 TeX Live is a joint project of the TeX user groups around the world;
 please consider supporting it by joining the group best for you. The

 Welcome to TeX Live!

Logfile: C:/Users/Public/texlive/2009/install-tl.log
Press any key to continue . . .
----------------------

and then

(2) wiith "option_desktop_integration 1" in the profile file (all
other options remaing exactly same) which failed (see the following
output):

-----------------------
pre-generating all format files (fmtutil-sys --all), be patient...done

C:\Users\Public\DOWNLO~1\INSTAL~1\INSTAL~1\install-tl: mkdir(//)

Press any key to continue . . .
-------------------------

So, this is not a big problem, shortcuts can be manually created, if I
know which ones!

Thanks. If needed I can provide the entire log (zipped), let me know.

BTW,

(1) I wonder why there is no example profile file in the
install-tl/install-tl-2010106/tlpkg directory? Even to generate a
profile file I had to do a minimal installation first. May be adding a
'Save profile' button with the PerlTk GUI is useful!

(2) I did not have access to the earlier Vista machine, but I ran
these on a 2008 sever which should behave like Vista for all practical
purposes.

\FDP at colonspace is an *internal* command according to the '@' in its 
name, so it is not meant to be redefined by the end-user.

The official way for customizing this space is:
\frenchbsetup{ThinColonSpace=true} for versions > 2.0  or
\renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace} for older versions (this still 
works now).

The origin of the problem is a change in version 2.3: 
\AutoSpaceBeforeFDP was differed 'AtBeginDocument' (\FDP at colonspace is 
still defined but not in the preamble), I reverted this change in 2.4 
because it breaks tex4ht (pointed out by Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard).

What I suggest to Vincent is to replace

\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\FDP at colonspace}{\FDP at thinspace}
\makeatother

by

\renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace}

in all his documents, even if he decides to switch to v2.4a ;-), because 
I cannot guarantee that the name of frenchb's internal commands will 
remain unchanged over the time.

I beg your pardon, but why the hell are your trying to fiddle with frenchb's
internals rather than using the provided interface?

The most correct way to achieve this effect with frenchb 2.x is

\frenchbsetup{ThinColonSpace=true}

Previously, the official interface (which still works with 2.x) was:

\renewcommand\Fcolonspace{\thinspace}

(note you don't need \makeatletter). This interface was introduced in frenchb
1.5f. I can't find the release date, but I checked that the version in TL 2005
was already 1.6g. So this interface has been stable for at least 5 years.

Well, my opinion is that is does not break compatibility since users are
supposed to use the interface, not the @-macros. And the interface is stable and
not broken.

To tell the truth, there is however a problem with the fact that \FDP at colonspace
is undefined in the preamble in frenchb 2.3d (as a matter of fact, it is defined
\AtBeginDocument): it break with tex4ht. For example, the HTML French version of
the TeX Live guide doesn't compile with frenchb 2.3d. As discussed with Daniel,
this was arguably a bug with the way tex4ht is trying to guess the version of
frenchb, however he preferred fixing this on his side, since the maintenance
status of tex4ht was rather unclear at that time.

So, I don't know if it's worth an update, but I just wanted to get the facts
clear: there is no compatibility breakage for documents using the advertised
interface. The only breakage is for documents using tex4ht.

Manuel.

Agreed, sorry Manuel, I was too quick to forward that.

Same here, sorry Daniel and thanks for the quick answer.

Sorry, who cares? If you want that, use plain tex. Yes that is life 
even in the TeX World. You probably can process all documents even
after loads of time, but probably they need some tweaking.

As said, only because someone suggested to you to use internal
macros does not mean it is the right way.

I am closing this bug.

The official interface may or may not work after 10 years, but there is
no guarantee internal macros be still working tomorrow, you pick your
choice.

(The most thing I hate in LaTeX world is packages redefining the
internals of other packages to get around some bug or a miss-feature,
see 'bidi' package for an extreme example of this!)

Well, redefining the internal command is what I had been told to do:

http://groups.google.fr/group/fr.comp.text.tex/msg/30c381f70f2c92e1

(though this was before frenchb was used and then I had to replace
\FDP at space by \FDP at colonspace).

BTW, \renewcommand{\FDP at colonspace}{\FDP at thinspace} doesn't even work
with 2.4a when defined in the preamble anyway (no compilation error,
but no effect either).

But will \renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace} still work in
10 years?

Subject: [tex-live] difference texlive 2008, 2009
Message-ID: <20100108131615.GA2529@nbgentoo.nlcz.cz>

Hello,

I have a strange problem and I am not sure what causes it.

When I run texlive on one of my .tex files in Gentoo (texlive-2008),

\bTD[width=120pt,topframe=on,height=32pt,align={right,low}] \
{\externalfigure[flcz.png] [width=20pt]} Czech \eTD

the result is that I have the flag, then space and the word Czech

In Archlinux (texlive 2009) the text is behind the flag, ie. invisible

When I change  \ {\extern.... to for example xx \{\extern... , in both
versions it is correct, ie. xx flag Czech

Is that
- my file issue
- Archlinux issue
- texlive version difference issue

?

Thank you for any hints...

Lubos

The problem is that the default Perl build in MacPorts doesn't
include shared libraries, but Tk needs them; you can build them by
adding the +shared variant to your build line.  See
http://trac.macports.org/ticket/18391 for details.

So, \renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace} is not correct either
since it is not documented. Only ThinColonSpace=true is documented
for the current version. But this also means that Debian/stable is
obsolete.

Much more likely than using internal macros. LaTeX's system with @ in macros
names is quite clear : when using an @ macro of a packages, you're on your own.

It is correct since it *was* documented, and is kept for compatibility, though
the new interface is recommended. It seems correct not to document the
compatibility measures. The point is that they are available, and they are.

But probably less likely than the recommended way.

It is no longer documented, so that it is no longer correct.

If you want another example, \FrenchItemizeSpacingfalse was documented,
but doesn't even work any longer:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.5 \FrenchItemizeSpacingfalse

It is not possible to compile some LaTeX files (using only documented
features) with (only) the distribution provided by Debian/stable. There
has been no transition period.

Well, not quite. It tries to create // directory and chokes on it
obviously. My guess is that USERPROFILE is set to a network location
and our code mishandles network paths. If that's the case than I know
how to fix it. It would be great if you could confirm that. Just start
regedit, navigate to:

  HKCU/software/microsoft/windows/currentversion/explorer/shell folders

and tell me what's under Programs key.

Sorry what are you talking? Please refrain from this rubbish.

Debian/stable contains TeX Live 2007 (7!!!) and can compile your
document.

You filed the bug against TeX Live 2009 in Debian /UNSTABLE.

What does that have to do with "Debian stable is obsolete"?

Howdy,

Why oh why didn't you simply use the MacTeX installer? See <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/>. It's aa five minute install of TeX Live 2009 along with some very useful GUI applications, a TeX Distribution System Preference Pane and a structure which doesn't require any setting of environment variables, etc.

Good Luck,

No, I can't:

l.4 \frenchbsetup
                 {ThinColonSpace=true,CompactItemize=false}

That's for the document before the change.

Said otherwise, a document can be compiled either under Debian/unstable
or under Debian/stable, but not both.

Yes, so it be. That has happened before and will happen in future.
LaTeX is not written in stone, even less the packages.

Wrong statement!

Debian/stable holds v.1.6g of frenchb, in frenchb.dtx (V.1.6g), 
\renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace} is fully documented:

%    \textbf{Changes in version 1.5}:
...
%      \item From version 1.5f on, it is possible to customize
%         the space inserted before a colon in French; its default
%         value is |\space| (as in previous versions of |frenchb|),
%         but it can now be changed to |\thinspace| by redefining
%         |\Fcolonspace|.

and also in the same file:

%  \subsection*{Customizing frenchb: an example of configuration file}
...
%% frenchb inserts a normal space before a colon in French (following
%% I.N. specifications), but some people prefer a thinspace instead;
%% uncomment the following line if you prefer a thinspace.
%%
%%\renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace}

Debian/sid holds v.2.3d of frenchb, the command \frenchbsetup{} is now 
the recommended way to gather all customizations, it is fully documented
(see \subsection{Customisation} in frenchb.dtx) *and* (most of) the 
former ways of doing customisation still work (ie 
\renewcommand{\Fcolonspace}{\thinspace}), what are you complaining about?

The advice you got here in 1998 (!) was correct at that time (no way of 
customizing the colonspace was supported, internal macros had to be 
tweaked), later (in v.1.5) I added support to do this properly and even 
later (v2.x) I added \frenchbsetup{} to make life easier for end-users 
with backward compatibility in mind, please read sections 4.6 
"Incompatibilit?s assum?es" and 4.7 "Comment recompiler ? l'identique un 
document ?crit pour frenchb 1.6" in the French documentation here:
http://daniel.flipo.free.fr/frenchb/

Anyway, people taking care of TeXLive and Debian distibutions are *not 
responsible* for packages changes, next time, instead of filing a bug 
report to Debian or TeXLive, please read the documentation first, then 
contact the package maintainer if you are still in trouble.

You missed the point. I have to modify my files so that they can
compile under Debian/unstable, and I don't want to use a command
that is no longer documented, thus likely to be unsupported in
the future (I don't want to do another change again in a few
years). That's why I use \frenchbsetup, and Debian/stable is
obsolete because it doesn't support it.

In fact I *must* use \frenchbsetup under Debian/unstable for the
replacement of \FrenchItemizeSpacingfalse, which no longer works.

But this needs to modify the file, which is bad when one wants to
distribute / share it among several users. And I think this is more
complicated in practice, e.g. because \FrenchItemizeSpacingfalse is
no longer defined.

The best way is to complain to the maintainers of the French style for
babel. This style goes to babel, the babel then goes to LaTeX and it
goes to CTAN from where TeX Live team, Debian team and others take it.
They will not replace a random file from the core LaTeX distribution
with a new version. It may sometimes work, sometimes not. As you
wrote, the interface has changed. If the LaTeX distro is changed in
Debian, just because you need the new interface, someone elses
documents may be broken, thus please complain to french.ldx
maintainers if you need long time compatibility. If you have to
support several versions with different interfaces, you have to check
them by \@ifundefined or similar mechanism.

Message-ID: <f5cb9d441001090703r4dc6be7eue223a0598c68d165@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I have done Russian translation of new tlmgr GUI. I don't know should
this new gui be in TL2009 or not (I judge on recent thread concerning
new version of asymptote and asymptote in TL) and should new
translation be in TL2009 (I made small improvement in old translated
strings). This is TL developers decision.

I also noted small bugs in new version while making translation.

New tlmgr:

line 280: string 'all' not translatable;

line 1764: string 'Loaded repository' not translatable.

line 1612: long string contains "Update all" button below
           but in new interface ther is not button Update all
	   there is only Update all installed.
	   Help text should be changed accordingly.

Suggestions:
- add translation for
  line 645: tlwarn("Cannot find...
- add space after 'on:'
  line 537: "Details on:"

I made small patch to fix the first two issues.

Hi,

I'm translating tlmgr to Croatian. However, I ran into a rather
nontrivial issue. As you can see on [1], Croatian letter ? gets
converted \x{0107}. It breaks only in menu and works elsewhere.

Is this a bug in tlmgr?

I don't think so. I made Russian translation on my Linux system
(Archlinux x86_64) and Russian letters are ok there. But today I go to
my University (I maintain TeX system on Windows and Linux OSes at
University): Windows XP has the same problem: instead of Russian
letters I see '\x{}' things but only in menu bar. The perl (as well as
Tk) for Windows is shipped with TL so IMHO this problem related with
Tk and Perl.

Changed that, too, thanks for spotting it.

Yeah, and big thanks for the translations. Actually if any of the
translators has some remarks/comments/suggestions about the
general infrastructure of translation, please let me know, it is
the first time that I did something similar.

As Vladimir already noted, that is a combination of our perl and Tk.

As we are planning to switch to Strawberry Perl and new Tk rather soon,
I guess that problem will go away.

You could help already now if you are experimental friendly:
- get http://www.logic.at/people/preining/texlive/tlperl.zip
- rename ROOT/2009/tlpkg/tlperl to ROOT/2009/tlpkg/tlperl.original
- unzip tlperl.zip in ROOT/tlpkg/ (it will create the tlperl dir)
- try running tlmgr again and see if it is fixed.

tlperl.zip contains Strawberry perl and Tk modules.

Best wishes

Hmm, actually no idea. Where did you say it does not work? Only in

Message-ID: <201001110109.o0B19D6D014620@f7.net>

(Sorry for the cross-posting.)

For TL 2010, we would like to change the default PDF output version to
PDF 1.5 (proposed by Elie Roux).  This is so we can use
\pdfcompresslevel and generate noticeably smaller PDF's by default.

The executables etex, pdftex, pdflatex, luatex, and lualatex would be
affected (among other more obscure ones).  Of course it's irrelevant to "tex".
ConTeXt has been using 1.5 for some time.

We've done a fair amount of research and can't find any significant and
reasonably current software that doesn't support 1.5.  For instance,
Acrobat5 does not read it, but Acrobat6 does.  PDFBox-0.7.3.jar (3 years
old) doesn't read it, but 0.8 (>1 year) does.

>From Taco, we know that the iLiad e-reader and others do not support
1.5, but they have such specialized needs anyway that this does not seem
like a stopper.

If anyone knows of other reasons not to make the change, please speak up.

This'll be mentioned again, but I thought to bring it up early, too.

Thanks,
Karl

Any idea how to set the pdf version to 1.5 in tl2009? I want to
experiment this change a bit.

In the cases of XeTeX or latex --> dvi --> dvipdfmx --> pdf,
set
V 5
in the file texmf/dvipdfmx/dvipdfmx.cfg.
The difference will be remarkable.

In the case of pdftex or pdflatex, write in the source
\pdfminorversion=5
\pdfcompresslevel=9
\pdfobjcompresslevel=3

The difference will not be so great.

Thanks,
Akira

Set \pdfminorversion=5 in your documents but don't expect any
improvement.

If you want to create smaller files, read the pdfTeX manual and look
for "object stream compression".  Simply switching to PDF-1.5 is
absolutely worthless.  You have to enable the features provided by the
PDF-1.5 spec explicitly.  I tried "object stream compression" already
and came to the conclusion that compressing these tiny things isn't
worth the effort at all.  You only save a few bytes but your PDF file
is incompatible with older versions of Adobe Reader then.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The key is "tiny". If I remember correctly my experiments in large
beamer one can save up 30%

If you want to produce files that conform to ISO standards like PDF/X-3
(which is widely spread in printing industry) or PDF/X-1a (mainly for
archiving purposes) files in PDF 1.5 won't pass.

Is there/will there be a configuration option to set the level globally? 
That would seem sensible to me, as users who need PDF/X-3 (or PDF/X-1a, 
or whatever) could then just "set it and forget it", while the rest of 
us can move to PDF 1.5 seamlessly. Something like

   tlmgr pdfversion 1.5
   tlmgr pdfversion 1.4
   ...

(With appropriate documentation, of course.)

I checked that new translation of tlmgr GUI works fine with new and old
GUI (I tested this on Linux only).

I also make translation for TeXworks but this program uses Qt so I
update translation file (ts) using Qt Linguit (I just run lupdate -pro
TeXworks.pro -ts trans/TeXworks_ru.ts and ts file is updated
accordingly so new strings are added).

Is there similar way to update po files? (I made translation several
days ago but today I have to begin with ru.po file in TL ROOT).

Also small notes about new GUI:

Design notes:
- 'File' is not meaningful name for this menu entry. More closely would be
  'Repository'.
- File->Quit, may be add a button at bottom of window?
- I don't understand the idea of 'Backup' button. If I could
  make backup of some packages then how can I restore these packages
  from backup? (another words: is there button to restore packages?).

  I think this is advanced feature so may be it is worth to make a switch
  which will make this button visible (by default this button is
  invisible).

Actually, this is quite important. With this in mind, I would vote
against PDF 1.5 in TL2010.

That's why PDF/X-4 (which allows PDF 1.5) was invented. :-)

Nothing stops you from generating PDF 1.4 instead; those who want to
generate PDF/X-3 will have to fiddle with their engines anyway.

Thank you.

Indeed for pdftex I haven't seen much difference as suggested by other

But if you have many of these tiny things (links, anchors, bookmarks, ...),
then it matters:

hyperref.dtx: 4634482 Bytes (\pdfminorversion=4)
hyperref.dtx: 1412019 Bytes (\pdfminorversion=5, \pdfobjcompresslevel=2)

This also raises the question, whether also the documentation
should be generated with \pdfminorversion=5, \pdfobjcompresslevel=2
to save space or is something similar to PDF/A (PDF-1.4) to be
preferred?

Currently the default setting is pdf-1.4 aka Acroread 5. It does not
prevent many users to produce pdf-1.5 with compression. However for
majority of users one extra line in the preamble seems too much - why
otherwise we see a lot of math manuscripts without hyperref.

So in my opinion the best default is what is the best for this mass of
losers - not that I care much about them but I care about myself as
some of these pdf files I need to read. In this sense I am for pdf-1.5
and those who know what pdf/X- is definitely know how to adjust
settings. However I am an extremist: if it was up to me hyperref would
be loaded by the default (I know, I know that it should be loaded
after (almost)  all other packages)

Please no hyperref as default. It is a useful package, I use it
sometimes, but it also breaks some documents. For instance, if you
want to write a document in Hindi (Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit) using
the Velthuis package, hyperref must not be loaded. The hyperref
package is too huge so that I do not know where the problem is. It
used to work a few years ago but I am not sure whether I still have
all the files that worked. At that time I did much work on OS/2 but
both my OS/2 computers have already crashed.

Yep, there was some discussion on this point. We thought people usually 
expect the first menu entry to be "file", so it would be good to fulfill 
this expectation. But you're right, the price is a not-so-meaningful name.

I think you have to use the command-line interface to restore backups.

And as Manuel said, for actually editing the .po file there are 
many editors, gtranslator, poedit, ksomething, ...

Agreed with Manuel, there was actually several discussions on that
and we settled for the "what people expect more" than "what is the
most suitable name".

Yeah for now the restore is only possible via command line, but
I want to add it to the GUI at some point.

Since we don't generate documentation ourselves in TL, but merely take what 
is on CTAN, which is provided by authors. So we could consider the decision 
is up to individual authors, unless the CTAN wants to state some preference 
on their upload page.

i doubt any such statement would have any effect -- most users pay
precious little attention to what our stated preferences are.

Hi Zdenek and all -- got back to this in my old mail.

I suppose the belleek fonts must correspond to the old MathTime fonts
that were in Y&Y and (the metrics) in teTeX.  I can't imagine that
Thomas E changed any metrics.

If anyone is interested in putting together a good belleek package, that
would be great.  It's not something I can take on.

Thanks,

I found a backup copy of my OS/2 teTeX in one of my Linux machines.
The README contains after some information marked as obsolete this
message that seems important:

-- original README:
These are the Belleek fonts described in my paper at TUG 98, the 1998 annual
meeting of the TeX Users Group.  They are drop-in replacements for the
proprietary fonts required by the LaTeX mathtime style, where the "dropping
in" process is simply to change the .fd files calling for specific fonts to
reflect the font names starting with "bl".

Notwithstanding any copyright notices in the files, these fonts have been
contributed to the public domain in their Type 1 (.pfb) and TrueType (.ttf)
forms:

    blex
    blsy
    rblmi

I remember I used these fonts in some documents so that I can trace
what exactly is needed and then pack the files. I am not able to
verify the metric files are unchanged, maybe Thomas Esser may remember
whether the metric files included in teTEX were unmodified. Maybe I
know someone who bought the mathtimes fonts many years ago. If I
manage to get the original metric files from him, I can compare them.

    In the case of pdftex or pdflatex, write in the source
    \pdfminorversion=5
    \pdfcompresslevel=9

We're thinking of \pdfcompresslevel=2 for the default.  That seemed like
the best space/time tradeoff in Elie's experiments, as I recall.

    If you want to produce files that conform to ISO standards like PDF/X-3
    (which is widely spread in printing industry) or PDF/X-1a (mainly for
    archiving purposes) files in PDF 1.5 won't pass.

Sure, but as I understand it, pdftex does not now produce output
conformant with those ISO standards, so changing the default PDF version
won't affect the issue.

I surely agree it would be desirable to support those output formats,
but, as I expect you and most people here know, changing the PDF version
is a tiny part of the job.  I can imagine that when PDF/X* is really
supported, a different .fmt will be desirable anyway.

In any case, the reason to switch to 1.5 is to meaningfully reduce
output size in the usual case, which does not involve PDF/X.  It is what
just about every other document production system does these days.

In my experiments

	\pdfminorversion=5
	\pdfobjcompresslevel=1

got me a 10% smaller PDF file with tl2009. The other option had no 
effect on my theses.

It very much depends on how much linking is going on in your file. No 
hyperref and no links => very little (if any) saving. Lots of links (for 
example, a hyperrlinked code index in a typeset DTX) => potentially 
large savings.

Footnote:
(BTW I'm producing tex files that pass standard validation tests of
PDF/X-3.) 

But true when not producing files for printing a default which produces
smaller pdf files will please the "average" user (including myself) :-) I
also didn't want to discuss the pro and cons of this or that standard but
only answer your question. As already written someone who needs a certain
standard for professional printing will know how to do so ...

Best regards,
Ulrich

I think it is worth to gather all repository related entries in one:
for now there are entries in File and in 'Options->General...'.
May be collect them under 'Options->Repository' entry?

Pros: all repository related things in one place.
Cons: the action 'Load repository' should be easily and quickly accessable
but then it will be buried under 'Options->Repository->Load ...
repository'.

If first entry in menu is 'File' then this is right place for 'Quit'.

Yes, right, we do not distribute that to the installations, as
with many other files primary for developers.

The cons is really a bad cons ... And Options->General is not only
about repositories, but many other options, too.

I don't want to put the actual "loading" together with setting the
options, I don't think this is a good idea.

In fact it is not complicated. Since all the gui functions do nothing
else but calling the underlying tlmgr.pl perl subs it is quite
straight forward. One only has to design a decent UI for that, and
program it ... time time is the problem.

On one hand there is the wish to switch to PDF 1.5 to use
the more advanced compression feature \pdfobjcompresslevel,
then you want to reduce compression? For the final run I would
want to have \pdfcompresslevel=9. The previous runs can be done
using option -draftmode. That should be faster than any setting of
\pdfcompresslevel.

IMHO the alternatives are:

a) the current setting
   \pdfminorversion=4
   \pdfcompresslevel=9
   \pdfobjcompresslevel=0

b) the suggested new setting
   \pdfminorversion=5
   \pdfcompresslevel=9
   \pdfobjcompresslevel=2 (recommended setting from manual)

The whole issue would become less dramatical, if the format
generation would support a user configuration file, e.g.

%%% pdftexconfig.tex %%%
\pdfoutput=1
...
\pdfpkresolution=600
%
\openin0 pdftexconfig.cfg
\ifeof0 %
\else  
  \closein0 %
  \input pdftexconfig.cfg %   
\fi
\endinput
%%% pdftexconfig.tex %%%

And pdftexconfig.cfg belongs to the user if he wants other default
settings.

Yours sincerely

Not a good idea. Then we will end up with outdated format dumps hanging
around in users TEXMFVAR and they will never know what they have
to do.

If a user *really* knows what he is doing he can already now call
	fmtutil-sys --byfmt ...
after having dropped n update pdftexconfig.tex into his TEXMFCONFIG
and the formats will be generated the correct way.

User specific formats, ie .fmt files in TEXMFVAR (~/%USERPROFILE%)
are a pain if the user does not know about them. The problem is
that a normal user will end up with an outdated format file while the
admin tells him: "Yes I have installed the hyphenation patterns for foo"
but he never sees them because he has an outdated format.

Same with pdftexconfig.cfg. It does not help. Those who can cope with
the problems already know what to do.

Is it not the case that one should perform
a \closein 0 regardless, once one has finished
with stream 0 ?

This is a no-go for me. Loading a repository is the most frequent action you'll
want to do with tlmgr. I must be accessible. Besides, it is an action, putting
it in "options" sounds very counter-intuitive for me.

Having listened to the various arguments for and against,
I would now like to express my personal position.

For me, Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5 was the last successful
version before Adobe started to split out functionality
into so-called "Professional" and "Professional Extended"
versions, and therefore remains my choice even today.
Thus I would want to be able to view any PDFs generated
using TeX Live 2010 in Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5 or Adobe
Acrobat Reader 5.0.5.  I am far less interested in
how small or how large my PDFs are, since I can always
compress them using Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5.

On the other hand, I fully appreciate that not everyone
has access to Adobe Acrobat, and may prefer to generate
highly compressed PDFs right from the outset.

Thus I believe that the correct choice is to add one
or more options to the installer, such as :

     PDF : Optimise for compatibility (PDF 1.4)
           Optimise for size (PDF 1.5)

What does it mean, to "load a repository" ?
As a native speaker of (British) English, it
seems highly ambiguous : it could mean

	(a) Select the repository for subsequent use
or	(b) Upload ones own files to the repository.
or	(c) Download the entire contents of the repository.

Are any of these meanings intended, or is
the actual (intended) meaning none of these ?

It means: "get the information about packages available in this repository". Or,
in more technical terms, get and load the TeX Live database (texlive.tlpdb) from
this repo. Or, again in non-technical terms: "do whatever is needed to be able
to use this repository right now".

If you want to suggest a clearer, but still quite short, formulation...

Not everybody can be expected to be using Windows and an old version of
Acrobat.

No, you can't.  Acrobat 5.0.5 has no options that would not cause it to
either decrease the quality of included JPEG images or drastically
_increase_ the size of the processed PDF.

So I don't think that your personal position and assessment is really
matching that of the needs of a significant ratio of TeXlive users.

As I made no such assertion, it is hard to see how
your observation is intended to add to the discussion.

Since "File / Save as" produces a series of "consolidating ...",
"consolidating ..." and "removing ..." messages, it seems
quite reasonable to believe that these operations are intended
to reduce file size rather than bloat it.  Furthermore,
experience shews that the resulting file is almost invariably
smaller (sometimes considerably smaller) then the original.

Once again, I made no such claim, but you are, of course,
fully entitled to your personal opinion, no matter how
irrelevant to the issues under discussion.

So, assume you receive a document in PDF 1.5 format. Is it very inconvenient 
for you to read, or can you cope with it?

IMO that is the real question. Most people seem to prefer smaller PDFs. If 
that only makes the documents inconvenient to read for others, I think it's 
acceptable. It would be more annoying if the documents were completely 
unreadable for some users.

\begin{document}
??????????.

their carons (?, ? and ? work fine).

However, this does _not_ occur with Evince and other Poppler-based
viewers and does not occur if file is compiled with
latex-dvips-pstopdf or latex-dvipdfmx.

The question is: Acrobat bug or pdfTeX bug?

An interesting question, since I do not know which
version people send. I am quite used to seeing "This
document contains features that are not compatible
with your version of Acrobat, so you may miss something",
but in general the document still displays OK.  If
you can send me (off-list) a known PDF 1.5 file, I will
be more than happy to try to open it and to report
back the results.

If \pdfobjcompresslevel is set, then AR 5 isn't able to view
the file, e.g.:

\pdfminorversion=5
\pdfobjcompresslevel=2
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Test
\end{document}

AR5/Linux complains:

| There was an error opening this
| document. The file is damaged and
| could not be repaired.

and doesn't show the file.

In theory it is possible to limit object streams to additional
features such as bookmarks, links, anchors. With a traditional
cross ref table the file could still be viewed by AR5,
see PDF specification. But pdfTeX doesn't support this.
And I don't see the point in not having bookmarks, links, ...
Then ghostscript could be used as PDF viewer.

I kind of disagree : this means that users won't see their TeX system 
improved because Phil Taylor has Acrobat 5.0 and doesn't want to change 
(even for a free software) because he has principles (that don't have 
anything to do with TeXLive)... doesn't sound like the 'very fair' 
definition to me ;-)

1) You appear to believe that generating PDF 1.5 would
    be an improvement; this is surely the very point
    being debated, rather than an /a priori/ given.

2) This has nothing to do with my principles.

3) In my humble opinion, Manuel's assessment :

 > IMO that is the real question. Most people seem to prefer smaller 
PDFs. If that only makes the documents inconvenient to read for others, 
I think it's acceptable. It would be more annoying if the documents were

i have a machine at home that can boot into a system containing a very
old acrocrap reader.  this is convenient in some circumstances, for
testing (and it's much faster on that old machine than my desktop is on
a modern acrocrap).

however, i'm at liberty to do something else (as is phil).  the people
who one should be considering are not the phils and robins of this
world, but rather the people who download over a dial-up line, and
struggle with almost everything.

such people may very well install a new dvd, and then find they can't
read any of the docs on it, and can't reasonably download even a
freeware viewer.

should we worry about them?  should there be a freeware viewer in tl?

it's all rather tricky, if you ask me.  my general view, as when
jonathan fine and i argued the toss over the arrival of latex 2e[*], is
that better things sometimes cost, and the best we can do is ameliorate
the users' problems.

I wouldn't change anything. Documents produced with TL are not distributed only
with TL :-) That's the whole point: using PDF as a document exchange format.
Otherwise, we could simply tell that people using a recent TL are certainly able
to install a recent viewer.

IMO the point is rather along the following lines: a TL2010 user creates a
document, sends it to people or puts it on the web. Now, someone receives or
downloads the documents, and tries to read it with his favourite viewer, which
may happen to be old if this person is a Phil or a Robin :-)

No what? If the person wanting to read the document is likely to be able to use
an alternative, more recent, viewer, fine. If not, it is more annoying.

100% agreed. The tricky part is to guess if the cost if higher than the benefits.

The ones who have anything newer than Acrobat5 would probably appreciate
smaller file sizes.

    should there be a freeware viewer in tl?

Well, we have psv for Windows.  I don't especially want to include

To correct myself -- I had said we were thinking of \pdfcompresslevel=2,
but this was wrong, I should have said \pdfobjcompresslevel.  As Heiko
stated, the choice is about

a) the current setting
   \pdfminorversion=4
   \pdfcompresslevel=9
   \pdfobjcompresslevel=0

b) the suggested new setting
   \pdfminorversion=5
   \pdfcompresslevel=9
   \pdfobjcompresslevel=2 (recommended setting from manual)


Another thing we could do is provide separate executables/formats
pdflatex-14, etc.  Then both options would always be available to all
users.

Much as I like the idea of supporting both PDF 1.4 and PDF 1.5,
it seems to me that having "separate executables/formats" is
using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and would cause major
problems for users of front-ends such as WinEDT.  Is it really
so difficult for these PDF options to be set in a single (one-
purpose) file that can be accessed through the TL installer
and manager, or even set in environment variables ?

I must admit that I don't know which solution is best.

Given that the default is 1.4, it would be best if packages like
movie15.sty switch to the version number they need.  And maybe a
tiny package compresspdf.sty is needed.

It's also possible to do it the other way around.  Make 1.5 the
default and provide a file which complains about features which are
not supported by PDF/X or PDF/A.  But someone has to provide such a
package.  Doing it this way is more cumbersome.

I personally prefer to try to solve such problems on macro level
whenever possible.  I regard changing format files as a last resort,
if a particular problem can't be solved otherwise.

I'm not even convinced that it's useful to create a new format file
whenever someone wants to switch from A4 to letter or vice versa.  TeX
provides a token register called \everyjob which can be used in the
source code of a format file in order to \input a config file at runtime.
Shouldn't we make use of it?

  Reinhard

There is still no free viewer available which supports PDF-1.5.  Period!

Try

  texdoc movie15

or

  texdoc miocrotype

and see what happens if you are using anything else but a recent
version of Adobe Reader.

I thought about this too. Then may be you try again and return to tab-based
gui. For me the GUIv2 looks unintuitive: in 'File' there are 'Load'
actions, on main screen (I like this very much) package manager. 

I think about two or three tabbed window:
the first tab 'General' or 'Options' (English is not my native language, sorry)
shown by default has following standard actions:
  Load repository
  Change repository

  Update filename database
  Rebuild all formats

  Quit

Next tab 'Package' will have the same content as GUIv2 have (I
mean main screen) now.

Third tab 'Advanced' or similar could have several buttons which will
call apropriate actions (Paper,...), i.e. reorganize actions and items
currently spreaded in Options, Actions (menu in GUIv2).

I understand that this is raw idea but if you will be interested in this
idea it will be improved.

P.S. This is like in MiKTeX Options.

No I don't want that. People *were* complaining about the GUI bein
not intuitive, and I think the current status is much more 
intuitive then what we had before.

Changing anything in the Options should not be necessary but very
rarely, so making it a separate tab is too much importance for it.

To repeat: Normally nobody wants to change anything in the options
after having made the installation. So why make it as prominent
as an extra tab.

We are *only* discussing here the naming
	"File"
which people might find counter-intuitive because loading
repositories is behind.

But from my personal experience I go for "File" in a a new program
(I never read manuals) if I search something, whatever it may be. And
I guess that many other will have a similar behaviour. That is the
reason it is called "File", the expectation in the users.

If many here speak up and say, please call it FooBar then we can
think about changing it to FooBar, but I don't want tabs.

Best wishes

But they all support objcompression (which is the main point of the discussion).

movie15 uses features of PDF1.6 (and flashmovie from PDF1.7 optional
extentions), even though it doesn't change the \pdfminorversion,
that's the problem. I sent a bugreport, but they didn't change
anything.

> ?texdoc miocrotype

This is strange, Adobe Reader 6 which is said to support PDF 1.5
doesn't read it... I think it has some PDF1.5 optional extentions in
it...

Anyway let's keep talking about the widely supported features of
PDF1.5, talking about the extentions makes no sense here.

Thank you,

Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5 /can/ open this document, albeit with
the "normal" warnings concerning "This document may contain
newer information than this viewer can support".

In addition, pairs of pop-ups displaying "The plug-in required
by this "SetOCGState" action is not available" occur if
the mouse is moved over the "Microtype" logotype.

Thanks, that's already suggested by Rolf and it indeed works. I search
around ConTeXt wiki for it's file with the same purpose and found it.
In case someone finds this thread via Google, ConTeXt requires this:

\input enco-pfr
\startencoding [ec]
  \usepdffontresource ec
\stopencoding

Not sure about plain TeX.

It is an improvement in the sense that it allows \pdfobjcompression
which decreases the size of the PDFs. For me having smaller PDFs is an
improvement, as well as for 99% of users : it saves disk space and
bandwidth, and thus polar bears (although it would be interesting to
see if the additional power consumption due to the compression is
lower that the average consumption of the saved bandwidth)... So I
guess the whole point is to know whether it's better to have small
PDFs or PDFs readable by a 9 year-old software... does TeXLive have
something like a voting system?

If it's not a good default value for pdfTeX, can it be at least the
default for LuaTeX? People working with luatex certainly know they are
dealing with modern things not mandatorily compatible with 2001
softwares... and the LuaTeX manual cannot be viewed by Acrobat 5.05
anyway (it is \pdfobjcompressed).

Also it's strange that you manage to open the microtype pdf, it bugs
the same way for 5.05 as for 6.0 (I see only blank pages and I have
some error messages all the time).

Thank you,

A less biased way of expressing this would be "... small/er/ PDFs,
or PDFs readable by a larger fraction of the potential set of
consumers".

Agreed (that it cannot be opened in AA 5.0.5) : "The file is
damaged and cannot be repaired".  What is the lowest version of
AA that /can/ open the file successfully ?

Are you using AA 5.0.5, or AR ?

Do you see the videos at the end of movie15.pdf and the fancy buttons
in page 4 of microtype.pdf? I think that's what Rheinard was talking
about.

I find this biased too ;-)

Until yesterday I didn't even know that people were still using
Acrobat 5.05, so I think "or readable by alarger fraction" could be
replaced by "and not readable by a small margin"... but that's where
we certainly disagree...

Version 6.0 of AR reads PDF 1.5. I don't know about AA.

My bad, I tested with AR.

There is certainly no reason to assume that a majority of potential
TL users will still be using AA (or, more likely, AR) 5.0.5, but
we have no idea what fraction are, nor what fraction are using
non-Adobe software that cannot handle PDF 1.5 with the proposed
compression.  Thus unless there is clear and indisputable evidence
that (say) 98,5% of TL users can handle compressed PDF 1.5 w/out
any difficulty, I argue that we should continue to (a) supply TL
documentation in PDF 1.4, and (b) that TL should be installable &
subsequently configurable to generate (at least) PDF 1.4, uncompressed
PDF 1.5 and compressed PDF 1.5 at the user's choice.

I've been looking for statistics on PDF viewers, but I don't think
such a thing can exist, as I don't see any method to produce them...
It looks obvious to me that noone uses AA 5.05 anymore, but I must say
the TeX world is full of surprises!

I don't think uncompressed PDF 1.5 is useful: most PDF readers don't
even read the version of the PDF, they just try to read it as well as
they can, so practically, uncompressed PDF 1.5 is equivalent to PDF
1.4. But I'm in favor of the option in tlmgr too.

Thank you,

We're precisely trying to get an idea through this public discussion. Atm,
nobody but you and Robin have stated they use old PDF software on a regular
basis. IIRC, Robin also stated he can easily access more recent software if needed.

And again, the point is not about TL users, but about people who will receive
PDF produced by TL users. If it was about TL users, we could just assume that if
they got a recent TL, they can also get a recent viewer, period.

> Thus unless there is clear and indisputable evidence

There will not be such evidence, and there will not be any such evidence in the
opposite direction either. We can only reasonably assume that X% of people can
read compressed pdf 1.5. And according to this discussion X seems to be quite large.

> I argue that we should continue to (a) supply TL
> documentation in PDF 1.4,

I see no point in doing so. If people can install TL2010, they also can install
a recent pdf viewer. If they really don't want to, we provide the documentation
as plain old html too.

(And if you were talking about the documentation in packages, they are not
generated nor modified in TL, so the choice is up to individual authors.)

It will be possible (just as you can already configure TL09 to make compressed
PDF 1.5 the default). The question is, how hard should we try to make it easy.

Yes, I could install a more recent version of Acrobat Reader;
however, there are real advantages in using Adobe Acrobat (as
opposed to Reader) but the cost of upgrading to (say)
AA Professional Extended 9 is way beyond my reach :-(

Sure, but then you could stay with TL09, or install a free viewer just for
viewing while keeping AA for the rest, tune your TL2010 to produce 1.4,
etc. They are plenty of options and the choice is yours. Put another way: you
*can* read compressed PDF 1.5 if you want to, it's merely a matter of personal
choice.

I would be much more reticent to introduce compressed PDF 1.5 as the default if
it were really very inconvenient for some users to get a reader for it.
Currently I've heard of no such example.

And let's not forget about TeXworks. So at least on Windows we already
provide not one but two capable pdf viewers.

I actually find TW superior to some other popular free alternatives
like AR, PDF-Xchange (no file locking), Foxit (auto-refresh on
change), SumatraPDF (better compatibility), GSView (bookmarks and just
looks better :)

The problem is (and this problem does not originate with TL)
is that all versions of PDF use the same file extension
(.pdf), and on any given system, that extension can be
conveniently associated with at most one utility).  Thus
I (and others in a similar position) would either have
to re-associate PDFs with a more recent version of AR,
or leave the association as it is, with a more functional.
less crippled (but also less modern), AA.  It /may/ be
possible to create an alternative action (say, "Read" :
the default is "Open") but whether TeXdoc could conveniently
attach itself to the "Read" hook rather than the "Open"
hook I could not predict ...

I have AR 9 and AR 5 on the same machine, I guess it's possible to
have AA 5 too... did you try?

When you build a software dealing with PDFs, you don't just read the
PDF character by character and do things according to the character
you see with a spaghetti code, you rely on a PDF library, and they all
can read PDF 1.5 when they are in a recent version, so I don't really
see your point here...

SVG can be compressed, I don't know if it is most of the time though...

Aouch !!! You've been told wrong, doing such a thing is totally
impossible. Which protocol are you talking about exactly? an IP router
deals with IP, it is already a humongous work for a router to make a
packet go from one place to another through the good pipe and most are
overloaded, deep inpection of the packet to see if it could be some
bits shorter is just absurd... I never heard such a rumor, it's quite
funny though :-)

OK, I have downloaded and installed AR 9.3.0. [1] After some
interaction with Explorer/Tools/Folder Options/File Types/,
I have managed to set the default action to "Open", the
default association to "Adobe Acrobat 5.0", and create
an alternative action "Open with Adobe Reader 9.x".  The
one remaining question, to my mind, is whether TeXdoc
can conveniently associate itself with the action
"Open with Adobe Reader 9.x" rather than with the default
action "Open".

http protocol can do it. If the server can compress the file on the
fly and the client informs in the Accept headers that it is able to
decompress it, the file may be sent compressed. However, routers do
not compress packets. The packets are quite small, the compression
ratio would be close to negligible.

Texdoc can't guess. But there is a personal config file 
(TEXMFHOME/texdoc/texdoc.cnf) where you can set your preferred viewers. (The 
plain old way: by giving the full path to the appropriate program, rather 
that any file association.)

Hmmm.  TL 2009 : how do I find the value of "TEXMFHOME" ?
It isn't an environment variable, and the TL Manager doesn't
seem willing to disclose it even under the "Configuration"
tab, which is where I had (half-)expected it to be shewn ...

I thought it was only for html, css and js files, but apparently it
works sometimes with pdf files too (seems buggy though), thank you for
the tip!

You raise interesting points here. It would be good to check if most PDF 
readers (as opposed to viewers) can handle compressed PDF 1.5 since a 
reasonable amount of time (say, a few years).

But texdoc kindly takes care of it for you :-) Try

texdoc --files

Manuel.

PS: it makes little sense (if any) to change this value after installation, 
so I don't think it should be in tlmgr's configuration tab. Maybe an 'info' 
tab (or now, dialog) with read-only values like this one would be useful. I 
don't know.

a bit odd that you have to have AR installed then in order to print a pdf.

or am I missing something? Is is possible to use TWs PDF viewer to print 
a PDF on windows?

Thanks for the encouraging comments! :)

In fairness, we should note that the TW viewer does not support all possible PDF features; in particular, things like embedded video don't work, AFAIK, nor do page transitions (e.g. for slideshows), nor certain kinds of (JavaScript-based) links.... and doubtless various other things. So it won't suit everybody.

No, printing is not currently implemented in TW, so you need a different tool for that.

I tested some, 90% of them don't read PDF, 1 of them (text2speech, a
really bad one) doesn't read compressed pdf and TextAloud (which seems
a bit better according to what I saw) can handle compressed pdf...
Does someone know anything in this area?

Even though is reminds me of my youth, going on ugly sites where you
can get outdated trial versions of 30$ crappy windows softwares is
quite annoying...

Thank you!

I do know someone who is completely dependent on AT for his
use of computers, and he has -- in the past -- said that PDF
poses quite severe accessibility problems.  I am bcc'ing him
with this reply so that he can add any comments he may wish to.

It turns out that some people have noticed the horrible, horrible
bloat of XML... there are a number of papers on XML-specific data
compression, including techniques to be able to efficiently) query an
XML file without decompressing any more data than necessary.  It isn't
a big research area, but it is an active one.

Really?  I hadn't heard that.  In any case, for people working from
home there is the last bit of the data path, which is where the
bottleneck is.  Even if the ISPs compress the data through most of the
path, the bandwidth to my ADSL "modem" is capped, and there is the
problem for me when d/l'ing PDF files.

Cheers.

P.S. While I sympathize with Philip Taylor's situation, I feel that
holding back progress because a few (?) people have valid reasons to
use "old" versions of software is not good.  Perhaps those people who
find the need to keep PDF 1.4 capability could form a group and put in
the effort to keep this capability in newer versions of TeX software?
(I know, that is really easy for me to say, since I'm not in that group.)

Please try 'texdoc texdoc' and look for the appropriate section (1.4 with texdoc
0.6x). If you think it is unclear or too short, please tell me so, and I'll try
to clarify. Alternatively, you may want to have a look at the default

Did that, Manuel, almost by instinct, but it suggested

	viewer_pdf = (xpdf %s)

which I localised to

	viewer_pdf = (E:\Layered 
products\Adobe\Acrobat\Reader\9.x\Reader\AcroRd32.exe %s)

but that failed to work :

	The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

so I tried :

	viewer_pdf = ("E:\Layered 
products\Adobe\Acrobat\Reader\9.x\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" %s

and that similarly failed :

	'E:\Layered' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

Ah, the joys of the overly-simplistic idea that it makes sense to
associate one program with a given extension.

If this is (easily) do-able under your favourite OS, could you write a
program which, when given a PDF, Does The Right Thing and calls either
AA 5 or AR 9 (or whatever) on the file, as appropriate?  And then
associate this program with '.pdf' ?

(I have a shell script which does a generalization of this: when
passed one or more file names, it checks my rules to see which program
I want to use for that/these file type(s), and runs the corresponding
program(s) on the file(s).  I have found it much easier to do this
than to fuss around trying to get the right entries into .mime.types
and other similar things.)

Cheers.

Not on the same machine! installing newer versions of AR implies
uninstalling old versions even of AA (if I understood correctly the
acronyms used by Phil...). Acrobat 5 was a really good, reliable, and
affordable (especially if you're in education) piece of software.
Moreover, you had free plug-ins by e.g. Enfocus (or commercial
extensions by the same): I am sure that in many workflows,
professional or not, keeping AA 5 has been preferred to an endless
upgrading (thus plug-ins as well, etc.).

Anyway, this is really a tiny detail. What is less tiny is the content
of the files distributed. In PDF 1.4, the internal structure of the
PDF tree is more or less transparent, so that any viewer supporting
PDF 1.0 can understand the file and display what it supports (the HTML
viewer philosophy, more or less), and just leave apart some objects
that are not understood. If you have so many annotations and objects
that this structure represents heavy weight overheads, then you could
just gzip your PDF file that would still be compatible with the
world. (Maybe not elegant, but efficient). If you produce a PDF file
where all this structure (which is verbose text) is compressed, then
the content of the file is just inaccessible to any third party parser
which has not been updated for PDF 1.5 (remember that people might be
interested not only in viewing or printing PDF, but also reading it
aloud for blind people, extracting metadata, converting textual
content to some XML dialect: it's not only acrobat replacements whose
compatibility have to be evaluated before such a move!).

It is funny to observe that while the trend for the ubiquitous format
like XML (do you see a strong demand for compressed SVG?) is to have
hyper-verbose uncompressed representation of content, we should care
so much about the size of PDF files. I've been told that most text
file transfer over the networks are compressed on the fly by the
routers (?) so that the actual impact on bandwidth might be zero.

I tried it with AR 7 and AA 5 (and it was as I just said). Never
since I upgraded to Acorbat pro 8 or 9.

This might be true, I just wanted to raise the issue. For instance, I
know of people that *do not read* the PDF but just parse its
structure to get directly to some objects they extract.

I also think that in the logic of long term archiving and access to
PDF's content, having a more-or-less transparent structure is
obviously safer. But I wouldn't advocate that pdftex only output PDF/A
by default anyway.

?R> Aouch !!!

when writing router I knew that it would be questionable (thus the
question mark!). The rumour was that in many cases some component of
the network infrastructure do compress the files.

I can't help but wonder how many polar bears have been adversely affected 
by this thread. But the purpose of this message is not to dwell on such 
imponderables, it is to point out an important fact that has escaped the 
current protaganists: as of PDF1.4 a document's /Catalog can have a 
/Version entry that *overrides* the version given in the file header (PDF 
Reference 1.7, Appendix H, p. 1096). In other words, for some documents 
the version given in the file header is moot. For example, try processing 
the following:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\pdfcatalog{/Version /2.0}
In this example the version in the PDF file header
is overriden by that in the document's /Catalog.
\end{document}

and then view it using AR9.3, which was released yesterday.
Even though the resultant PDF has a file header, %PDF-1.4,
AR9.3 will complain that the file is a newer format than it can handle. 

The ISO-32000 spec extends this idea further with the use of
/BaseVersion and /ExtensionLevel. Of course, many of the "free" 
PDF viewers do not recognize these /Catalog entries (e.g.
xpdf 3.02). Therein lies the problem, what's the point of having
an international standard if individuals choose to use
non-compliant browsers? 

I do understand why people choose to do so (acrocrap and all that),
but if I author a PDF, I'm going to have no qualms in using
a feature that's in ISO-32000, especially as Adobe Reader is
freely available. And if I lose some readers in the
process, so be it: they're probably not the sort of people
I'm aiming to communicate with, anyway.

A vote would be fine, so long as the electorate are properly
educated to know the pros and cons of what they're voting on.
And as I've tried to show here, in this particular instance
matters are a little bit more involved than the current debate
suggests. The good news, however, is that the /Version entry 
in the /Catalog could be leveraged to allow macro packages 
to fix the effective level of a PDF. This would naturally
require a standardized interface to allow an individual
package to stipulate its specific requirement, so that the
highest requirement can then be output in the /Version name.

Don't forget there's always the security angle to consider,
as older versions of AR/AA have buffer flow problems that can be
exploited by malicious PDFs. Therefore if you're going to stick
with AR5/6/7/8, be aware of the risks involved.

Is a PDF considered a text file? I thought the whole idea of
the four binary bytes after the header were to inform routing software
that they're dealing with a binary file.

I forgot to bring up the following URL:

http://blogs.adobe.com/adobereader/2009/12/adobe_reader_and_acrobat_versi.html

The bottom line is that AR5  (and 6 and 7) are no longer supported.

If you're going to go that route, it's also possible to have the program 
do conversion from PDF1.5 to PDF1.4, or whatever, before it passes the 
document to the viewer. It's more involved, but still do-able. And with 
the speed of today's machines, hardly noticeable in the overhead it 
introduces.

I could have done, when programming was still done in
real languages such as Fortran, Pascal or Algol-68.
Sadly those days are long-since past, and as any
contact with "C" and its friends brings me out in a rash
that takes weeks to heal [1], I prefer to leave such tasks
to the current generation of nerds, geeks, dorks and
so on :-)

As far as I can read from the TeXLive page

Emacs + auctex for windows is included on the TL DVD.

I'm wondering if it can be downloaded as well?

Of course it is recommended that users by the DVD to support their local 
user groups, but sometimes it is nice to be able to just download it.

As far as I know it can be downloaded directly from tug.org, but as I'd 
like not to cause too much extra trafic on tug.org, I wanted to know 
whether it is available through mirrors as well?

which is not to suggest that V9 of AA/AR is any

This Ubuntu 9.10 system has:

/usr/bin/gnome-open /usr/bin/gvfs-open  /usr/bin/kde-open  /usr/bin/xdg-open

These open .pdf with with okular or evince, but If I'm not using the "expected"
window system or an ssh tunnel I often get messages like:
** (evince:26606): WARNING **: Failed to create dbus proxy for
org.gnome.SettingsDaemon: Could not get owner of name
'org.gnome.SettingsDaemon': no such name

Mac OS X has an "open" command.

1) Such tools are "expected" to be available in current desktop environments
2) These tools are useful to people who have never heard of TeX

These tools should do some checks beyond looking at the extension to match
a file with a suitable application.   I don't know if anyone has
written similar
utilities for Windows.

I would prefer to see the XX-open tools improved so they deal with issues
such as matching pdf files with appropriate applications.  It doesn't make
sense for TL to work around problems with these tools as the problems
affect people who won't be installing TL.

I realize it's far from ideal, and printing is definitely a feature we need to add. The challenge is doing it (a) cross-platform, (b) through many varieties of printer drivers, and (c) well. I don't want to ship a print command that may give poor results.

Indeed, as soon as one vulnerability is plugged another is exposed. 
However Adobe are inching forward with extra layers of security, such as 
black-listing of individual JavaScript functions, see 
http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/504/cpsid_50431.html, and so for most users it 
does make sense to swim with the security-flow. Although as Dumas 
once observed -- all generalistions are dangerous, including this one.
Hence it is easy to pick holes in such statements.

it's no problem to have multiple versions of acrobat on windows either 
(not that i care to keep old versions around as recent versions can

afaik only the metadata xml blob is to be text-only as it has to be 
parsable without having to interpret the pdf structure

and with object compression annotations dicts etc are also compressed

Hi Kap4Lin,

Thanks for investigating this problem for me. The fix is in svn now
and should be available with the next round of updates.

Cheers,

Does it support compression only or other 1.5 features too?

What 1.5 features are you talking about precisely? I'm not sure the ones 
used in microtype.pdf are really standard 1.5... did you verify?

might be an idea to add say an item in the file menu, labelled 'no 
print' and let et activate a message explaining that the viewer cannot 
print, and perhaps suggest a few possible other PDF viewers that CAN print.

As far as I understand the 1.5 spec, layers (OCG groups) were
introduced in 1.5.  This is what microtype.pdf is using.  You can
verify if you open the layers panel in a recent AR.

Quite true, and possibly shown only by Acrobat/Reader (for example, 
Preview on Mac OS X doesn't seem to manage these). However, such 
features are not relevant to the discussion about the default output 
from TeX Live, as this type of thing does not appear simply by switching 
from PDF-1.4 to PDF-1.5.

The key question is whether the features (essentially the compression 
stuff) that does appear on adding

\pdfminorversion=5
\pdfcompresslevel=9
\pdfobjcompresslevel=2

to a document which gives a fully-functional result without them. 
Documents which use \special's, etc., to introduce PDF features directly 
are going to potentially fail whether TeX Live produces PDF-1.4 or 
PDF-1.5 files.

For me, this is key. I use LaTeX in a world which has never (for the
most part) heard of it. The fact that I am not sending somebody a Word
document is already potentially (a) weird (b) awkward (c) annoying. If
there is *any* chance that the person or system receiving my CV/job
application/paper will not be able to double-click and open my document
immediately, without warnings and errors in their default PDF viewer, I
want to change my PDF output so it will work. Since I don't typically
know the person receiving the document and since I might forget to
change to a non-default setting, this means that in practice I want
pdftex to give me 1.4 by default. If TL 2010 changes the default, I'll
have to figure out how to change it/regenerate formats/whatever it is
you have to do. An installer option wouldn't help me because MacTeX
doesn't offer options on install as far as I remember. (Haven't
installed 2009 yet though.)

Should this type of consideration affect the choice of default for
2010? I don't know. Since I would currently hesitate to recommend TeX
to humanities users in any case because of compatibility problems with
journals/conferences/institutions requiring submissions in Word,
possibly not. Two compatibility issues requiring user awareness and
capability are not necessarily more of an obstacle than one. On the
other hand, the situation regarding compatibility with Word-requiring
receivers does seem to be improving to at least some extent with some
of the newer GUI converters available. (At least, pre-docx it looked
that way. Not sure what the situation is now.) So introducing a
second compatibility issue might prove to be the important obstacle.

Do I think it reasonable to assume that some of my recipients might
still be using AR5? Definitely. Certainly in 2004 there were people
still using AR3 or AR4. Not from choice but because that's what was
installed by default on university machines. To them, the failure of my
pdfs to open was incomprehensible. Things like versions of software
were just not things they thought about. The software was on the
machine. Someone sent a pdf. It worked or it didn't.

To me personally, it doesn't matter much. As long as there's
documentation somewhere I can find which tells me how to switch the
default output to 1.4, that's fine. It would potentially affect whether
I would think it reasonable or responsible to recommend TeX to somebody
in the humanities. But that may not really be an issue either. People
aren't exactly queueing up asking for information. (Or, rather,
sometimes they say my stuff looks nice but I tend to dissuade them from
investigating further since I doubt they typically care enough about
the output's appearance to tangle with TeX. I doubt that would have
persuaded me to make the switch.)

If the default is switched to 1.5, I think it would be very important
to make the potential implications of upgrading TL without changing the
format extremely clear to the user.

No argument here. I'd prefer to receive smaller PDFs. I don't think it
is TL users who should be the focus of concern here - certainly not TL
users updating to TL2010. My main concern is the people I send PDFs to
- not reading PDFs myself. Easy for me to say, perhaps. But there it
is. Disk space and download times are real issues for me (even though
I'm not on dial-up, MacTeX is a huge download).

An easy way to switch from 1.4 to 1.5 with compression on a
document-by-document basis would be very welcome. Smaller beamer
presentations would be great. Ideally, I'd like something which enabled
me to specify the choice by reference to the minimum AR version
necessary to read/use the document without losing anything rather than
my having to get to grips with various features of PDF which I never,
frankly, think about. In the same way that AA asks you to specify a
minimum version when you ask it to reduce file size.

Well, they are not the only ones.

Although I do have recent pdf viewers and actually use them too,
I had configured texdoc to use AR5. It was much faster than newer
ARs then and that mattered especially when opening documentation,
looking up certain things for a few seconds, and then closing it
again. Only recently (a few weeks ago) I configured texdoc to use
AR9 which starts quite fast but I still feel the difference.

I have no problems using more recent pdf viewers and I won't
complain. I was always using several pdf viewers alternately.
The curious thing is that until recently I was using AR5 more
or less exclusively with texdoc. Times, they are a changin'.

Correction: microtype.pdf uses them, but the package doesn't.

Most likely only compression - I know of no other PDF viewer then AR
that does layers.

As you know, I find the "File" menu counter-intuitive too. Standard
entries like open/save/save as, that one expects in such a menu, just
don't make sense in this context. My preference goes to something like
"Repository" or "Database", although, these are not so intuitive
either. Still, I think they fit the purpose of this menu better than
"File".

Do you want TeX Live, or do you want only Emacs+AucTeX?

For TeX Live iso see
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html
there are torrents.

For Emacs/Auctex: Get the package from the iso, or the net from websvn.
Or from any of the usual download sites shipping emacs/auctex.

You can always use another viewer, there are many free (as in freedom
and free of fee) viewers that are much faster than Adobe Reader (even
Evince has a windows version now), I don't think there are many package
documentation that do fancy stuff like microtype.pdf and you can resort
to Adobe Reader for those isolated case. I never use any version of
Adobe Reader by default myself (it is just too slow to be of any
practical use anyway) and I'm quit happy.

Dear list,

it seems as if oolatex is not a available in TL2009?

macbook-daniel:aktuell daniel$ which htlatex
/usr/texbin/htlatex
macbook-daniel:aktuell daniel$ which oolatex
macbook-daniel:aktuell daniel$ 

Is that normal?

And I cannot use the command I found at 
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn-commands.html#QQ1-9-38

macbook-daniel:aktuell daniel$ htlatex DynTaxComp_0.9.tex "xhtml,ooffice" "ooffice/! -cmozhtf" "-coo -cvalidate" 

it returns an error:

-bash: ! -cmozhtf": event not found

is this a texlive, a tex4ht or a mactex problem?

Sorry, I know nothing on this subject.

The problem with this command is that bash tries to replace ! -cmozhtf with 
the latest command that started with -cmozhtf. Try replace double quotes with 
single quotes and report new error message.

Because you should oolatex install by yourself.

No problem. We do NOT include all possible programs on the internet.
oolatex didn't cross our mind, and probably will not for some time,
unless one takes over the task to check out the program, integrate it,
make it compile/work on all the platforms including Windows, ....

Many scripts in tex4ht except for a few typical
ones are omitted in TL09, since they may be possible
by a generic script mk4ht:
mk4ht oolatex ... ...

I'm sorry to contradict you, Norbert, but it looks like oolatex is part of
tex4ht, and we do include tex4ht. There is probably a reason why we excluded
this particular bit, though I can't find it right now, but the question sounds
pertinent to me.

Ahhhh, ok, that is something different then. I thought that is some 
funny program that converts ooo documents to latex or so.

Well, then I also understand the comment from Akira.

And I didn't see it before I answered: that's certainly the reason why we didn't

thanks for all answers. Yes, oolatex is part of tex4ht and this is why I expected it to be part of TL.  

mk4ht oolatex myfile.tex

seems to work - at least I now have a folder full of zillion files where I now an look for an open-office version of my paper :-) 

But that is now a tex4ht/mk4ht/oolatex problem....

Hi Daniel,

    oolatex is part of tex4ht and this is why I expected it to be part
    of TL.

There were so many tex4ht cmd names; some of them conflicted with other
programs, others were short and generally problematic.  It was a
decision we made for TL, although I did discuss it with Eitan, and he
didn't have a problem with it.

We could put oolatex specifically back now that we know someone
actually uses it :).  OTOH, maybe that's not really useful since we
made a release without it.

    But that is now a tex4ht/mk4ht/oolatex problem....

BTW, please report tex4ht issues to tex4ht at tug.org.

This refers to Akira's statement:

>mk4ht oolatex ... ...

If they are going to be omitted, then that fact _must_ be
better documented. Running "texdoc tex4ht" produces a page
that explicitely states to run "oolatex filename".

You have to click on "calling commands" search down some
ways to find the command mk4ht, which seems to be presented as
an optional interface (rather than a requirement).
The requirement to run mk4ht should be on page 1.

Please direct that to the ht list (already mentioned here), best of
course with a patch to the documentation.

Message-ID: <4B505E41.4030407@olsthoorn.ch>



Hi to all

I am starting my roots with texlive, and downloaded the iso.xz source.
Unfortunately, I was not able to decompress it with my winRar or 7-zip 
on windows.

So I tried on my Debian server where the decompression didn't work. The 
proposed xz-utils cannot be installed, as they are missing on the 
repository. A try with the original release didn't work either.

After this disappointing result, I tried the network install on windows. 
That seemed to work properly, but after installing probably most of the 
data, the installation stopped with following error:
untarring D:\texlive\2009\temp\xetex.win32.tar failed

I have repeated the installation several times, but the result remains 
the same on my XP prof. SP3 system (remaining 3GB FAT32 disk space).

What can I do (exept giving up)?

Regards

For Windows: If you can use the cmd line (cmd.exe), get
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.exe
and use it to decompress the .iso.xz
But then you need something to mount it, or you burn it onto a DVD.
DaemonTools come to my mind (I use it often) which creates a virtual
CD/DVD drive and can mount .iso images.

Strange, which release? stable/testing/unstable?
Depending on your architecture you can download either
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.i386-linux
or
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.x86_64-linux
and use that for decompression. Then you can mount the iso image
with either fuseiso, or if you can get root access, with
	mount -o loop,ro texlive2009.iso /whatever/directory
(you have to create /whatever/directory).

That is *really* strange and we have not seen something similar.

Did you *remove* everything in D:\texlive\2009 before restarting?
BEFORE (!!!!) DELETING, please send me/us the xetex.win32.tar ....

the list continues for every "when <value>:" line. I found out, that
ruby 1.9 does not accept a double colon at this point, but rather
expects "then" as keyword.

Find attached a patch, which solves the issue.

My apologies. I appeared to me from the other messages in
this thread that it was TeX Live which had made the decision
to replace the separate oolatex with the mk4ht incantation.
I refer to this message fron Karl:

Also miktex 2.8 contains an oolatex command.
I know Karl said to report tex4ht issues to the tex4ht list,
but, as I said, itseemed it was a TL decision, which makes
it a TL issue.

I personally don't use tex4ht at all, and was just making
a point to those I thought were responsible. Ignore my
suggestion if the responsibility lies elsewhere.

Subject: [tex-live] Comments on texlive 2008 to 2009
Message-ID: <4B53B17A.4070200@earthlink.net>

     I have just installed texlive 2009 from the DVD on top of the 2007 
and 2008 editions on a linux box using the gui installer, and have a 
couple of comments.

o I went with the suggested No Symlinks and updated the PATH environment 
to use texlive 2009 before the 2008 and 2007 editions. When testing I 
kept getting the 2008 contents. After much tribulation I found that I 
must have requested symlinks when installing 2008. Deleting everything 
in /usr/local/bin eventually cured the problem. It could be beneficial 
to add a comment to the Guide that this, as well as an incorrect PATH, 
can lead to the correct programs not being found.

o I have several third party fonts (e.g. WebOMints) and they were not 
accessible after moving from 2008 to 2009. I discovered that I had to 
run updmap-sys for each of the map files for these fonts. I had followed 
  waht appeared to be the `standard' suggestion of putting the map files 
into TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map/dvips/... It appears that updmap is run for 
map files in the standard distribution at installation time. It would 
make life much easier for users like me if the map files located under 
TEXMFLOCAL were also updmaped when TeXLive was installed.

Apart from the above quibbles, everything has appeared to go well. Thank 
you all.

Yes, that of course can be a problem ...

Only by putting fonts into these directories they will not be activated.

You have to call updmap-sys for each map file, or you can put the
map files in TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg and call
	tlmgr generate updmap
Please see the documentation of tlmgr generate for that. That is the
way I do manage my local fonts.

finally the TeX Live 2009 package swapped over to Debian/testing, so
they will be in the next stable release.

That took some time, but it is good to know.

A while ago, Werner suggested:

    Date: Sun, 21 Sep 2008 07:20:18 +0200 (CEST)
    From: Werner LEMBERG

    As a corollary of this thread: Maybe the installer should do something
    like this:

      set | grep -i tex | less

    to show the user what environment variables related to tex (or not)
    are set, together with a message that the user have to check them.

I just added this check to install-tl, although I rather worry that
there will be too many false positives.  If anyone notices particular
variables which are not a problem, please report so they can be
excluded.  I already exclude $PWD, $OLDPWD, $_, and various others.

Thanks,
Karl

Here's what the message looks like:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following environment variables contain the string "tex"
 (case-independent).  If you're doing anything but adding personal
 directories to the system paths, they may well cause trouble with
 some parts of running TeX.  If you encounter problems, try unsetting
 them.  (And please ignore any spurious matches that are unrelated to TeX.)

Message-ID: <2448e5461001182101lfaa00e0tcc41897488812b18@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I want to use package revtex4, a package from American Physical Society, in
texlive. I am using Fedora, so I add the repository in
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TeXLive to install texlive, and then
install texlive-revtex . But when I compile a latex file using revtex4, I
still get error like "! LaTeX Error: File `revtex4.cls' not found". I give
another try by downloading the revtex4 package from APS website, following
the installation instructions but still I get the same error. Does anybody
know how to do that in Fedora? I know in Debian people just install package
texlive-publishers and everything will be okay.

Best,

Lijun

revtex4 has been reintroduced into TeX Live upstream some time ago.

Please ask Fedora people to sync with upstream TeX Live.

As it is today, you can't get a PDF/X-1a:2001 compliant PDF with pdfTeX either.

I managed to get a 100% PDF/X-1a:2001 compliant PDF (a 720 pages book with hundreds of graphics) using the excellent pdfx.sty (thank you so much, CV Radhakrishnan and Han The Thanh!). After some trial and error, I found the best loading order to be

\documentclass{book}%
\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}%        <- I use Greek
\usepackage{verse}
\usepackage[x-1a]{pdfx}
\usepackage{fixltx2e}[2006/03/24]%

and a long, long preamble follows.

Most of the time spent achieving this, was changing several Illustrator graphics that weren't OK for PDF/X-1a (TikZ graphics were fine).

So I definitely vote YES for pdf 1.5 as the default for TL 2010 ---it has many advantages for common use, and, if we need pdf 1.3 or whatever, we can always resort to \pdfminorversion or pdfx.sty.

Best,

Axel

As Norbert wrote, the best solution is to have it added to Fedora
distro but from the error message it seeme to me that you forgot to
run mktexlsr after unpacking the package.

The problem with pdfx.sty is that it requires hyperref but sometimes I
have to use packages that are not compatible with hyperref. And I do
not know how to cope with glyph->unicode for Devanagari entered via
the Velthuis package. The next problem is black overprint, I am not
able to set it. The minor problem is that the MediaBox, BleedBox and
TrimBox are set to fixed value. I would prefer if they could be read
from the values stored in my zwpagelayout package.

Well ---then \pdfminorversion=whatever is the solution. Anyway, I repeat, as it is now you can't get a PDF/X-1a:2001 compliant PDF with pdfTeX.

I modified pdfx.sty in my working directory to fit my exact needs:

\pdfpageattr{/MediaBox[0 0 581.102 765.354]
             /BleedBox[0 0 581.102 765.354]
             /TrimBox[113.385 113.385 467.717 651.969]}

Is there any chance that some guru may re-package the "enhanced" Garamond package from http://gael-varoquaux.info/computers/garamond/index.html (including small caps and old-style figures) for use with TeX Live anytime soon?

Convince him that he uploads these packages to CTAN. Then there might
be a chance.

I have to correct myself ... the stuff is under non-commerical license,
si it will not end up in TeX Live, never, unless you convince the
author to release the fonts under a different license.

Honestly, I am a bit surprised that this is possible, what is the
original license of URW Garamond? Can he change it to Alladin
Free Public License like this?

Actually I have done that after I install revtex4. It is a little strange
that revtex.cls still can not be found.

But now I erase all Fedora-based texlive packages and download the whole
texlive package from tug.org and it works.

Thanks.

Better not!

Someone already asked before.  These fonts are modified versions of
the original URW GaramondNo8 available by getnonfreefonts, but neither
/FontName was changed, nor the /UniqueID, nor font filenames.  This
will definitely clash with the original fonts.

And there are no small caps, only OsF, BTW.

I'll contact the author, but I'd like to have a closer look first.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi

I included epstopdf as follows:

\usepackage{epstopdf}
	\epstopdfsetup{update,prepend}

When including a eps file with

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{captionstruktur}
	\caption[Elemente der Beschriftung von Gleitobjekten]{Elemente der Beschriftung von Gleitobjekten}
\end{figure}

I get the following error message:

!!! Error: Writing to gs failed, signal 127

In just happens on that one file, which is exported from Corel Technical Designer X4 as EPS. The system I am sitting on is a OS X 10.6.2 with TL 2009 (all updates). The compilation is done via TextMate and pdflatex.

I already exported again, but it still happens with that file.


Thanks for your advices,

Sometimes Corel software adds garbage at beginning of EPS file
The first line in the file should be
!%EPS
or similar.

Bonjour tex-live, 

On internet i find : 
to use texworks (or texmaker, winshell, etc..) with texlive portable i need to change the file tl-portable.bat like this :  
replace the line : 
"%ComSpec%" /k "title TL-SHELL& prompt TL %prompt%"  
by the lines : 
REM "%ComSpec%" /k "title TL-SHELL& prompt TL %prompt%"  
start "" "%~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe" 

i do and it's works well. 
i also test the line :
start %~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe  

and it's works to. 

what's the difference between the line : 
start "" "%~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe" 
and the line 
start %~dp0TeXworks\TeXworks.exe ? 

what's better : the first line or the second line ? 
   
thanks for your answers and sorry for my bad english.

The first. The second line won't work if there are spaces in the path to
texworks. That's why you need the second pair of quotes. Now, the syntax of
'start' is quite strange: if the first argument is double-quoted, then it is
interpreted as the title of the new window. To avoid this, we need to provide a
dummy title (here empty), hence the first pair of quotes.

Welcome to the weird world of windows scripting :-)

Hello Guys,

many thanks for providing TeX Live. Nevertheless I have some things to  
suggest for improvement:

===================

In the docs there is are no hints on which paths can be used to  
customize the installation by the user, e. g.

# where is .dvipsrc?
DVIPSRC may be set optionally

# the next is not really necessary, it's just the default
BIBTEX_CSFILE = /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/bibtex/csf/base/ 
88591lat.csf


missing or wrong in texmf.cnf, corrected items below:

BSTINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/bst//

# where to look for bibtex8 code sort files
CSFINPUT = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/cfs//


no links in documentation /usr/local/texlive/2009/doc.html to

	bibtex8 in /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/doc/bibtex8
	
	ae in /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/ae

missing documentation
	
	symbols of textcomp

missing packages:

	url.sty

==========================================

Many thanks and greetings from Germany

Andreas

First paragraph of doc.html: "This document lists links to all HTML and PDF
files  [...]". There is no PDF nor HTML documentation for those packages.
Anyway, doc.html is automatically generated, so we won't adjust it manually, but
if you have suggestions to improve the logic, they are welcome. (The point with
selecting PDF and HTML is to try to avoid cluttering the document with
irrelevant links.)

Were do we find it on CTAN? As a user, I wasn't able to locate it, except in
encguide.pdf (section A.2) and at the end of the German version of lshort (more
readable, with user commands). Of course there is also section 20 of
source2e.pdf. However, as a user, I would appreciate a separate, user-oriented
document about textcomp. I guess we should ask the latex team...

Present in ltxmisc. Arguably, ltxmisc should be split in individual packages,
and each package in it should come with user documentation, but that's another
story...

Message-ID: <C77C61AF.B036%adam.maxwell@pnl.gov>

In TeX Live Utility, I download update-tlmgr-latest.sh for infrastructure
updates.  A user just reported getting an error where TLU downloaded an HTML
page instead of a shell script.  I'm not sure which mirror he used, but
mirror.ctan.org just sent me to the binkerton.com mirror, which isn't
allowing a direct download of update-tlmgr-latest.sh.

Opening this in a browser or downloading with curl will give some PHP
wrapper around the script:

http://ctan.binkerton.com/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh

It's happened before with this mirror, so I'd like to blacklist it in TLU.
However, if the user's default repo is mirror.ctan.org and it hands back
ctan.binkerton.com, I'm not sure what I can do.  Any ideas?

(that mirror is also giving similar behavior but 404 errors for .pl files,
which I suspect could cause problems for tlmgr as well?)

thanks,
Adam

A text version could be automatically extracted from the package file,
see appended perl script and saved and provided as "url.txt" that
can then be found and presented by texdoc.

Hi,

Before blacklisting this mirror in TLU, it may be worth trying to fix it by
discussing the problem with its administrator. Cc-ing the CTAN team, though I
know Robin watches the TL list carefully.

roughly speaking, binkerton.com sounds broken "as a mirror".

i'm copying this to the ctan list -- we can stop it appearing in
mirrors.ctan.org, but we need to approach the mirror managers to see if
what you're observing is a passing fad.

Yep, it delivers different content based on the User-Agent string. Plain wget 
works OK, but "wget -U texlive" gives some html+javascript blurb (and it froze 
my Firefox as well).

I'll write to the contact address for this mirror. In the meantime, I've removed 
the site from the list for mirror.ctan.org.

Do you get the same result when using wget instead of curl?

quite possibly.  the site determines what to return based on the agent
setting in the request.

rainer's changed the database so that binkerton is no longer part of the
mirrors.ctan club.  he's also mailed the registered manager of the site
to ask what's going on.

Interesting.  I'm using Mac OS X APIs for downloading, so I've no idea what
User-Agent it's passing.

I ran into this exact problem about a year ago (30 Dec 2008 according to svn
logs) with binkerton.com, but I believe Karl passed on my complaint and they
fixed it.  Having it break randomly is sort of a support nuisance, though
:).

Thank you!  Either way, that's much better than me trying to find a
workaround.

Message-ID: <daef5be81001210938l16078ae6r4d281412bc65a2f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I understand this may not be the right list, so I am Cc-ing the author
of latexdiff as well.

A "simple" problem while using latexdiff: \sout (or \uwave) of ulem
interacting with the combination of \textbf{} and \citet{}. Minimum
working example follows. The solution that I have is to use '-t CFONT'
when calling latexdiff. Any other solution (which includes sout and/or
uwave) is highly appreciated.

I think, having a .txt file in the TDS:doc// tree is better than
adding special handling for special files in `texdoc'.

The current texdoc version defines aliases for url, ulem, ...
that redirect the request to the .sty file, excerpt from texdoc.cnf:

  ...
  alias ulem = ulem.sty
  alias underscore = underscore.sty
  alias url = url.sty
  ...

CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/misc/url.sty has file date 2007/12/10
(dante server) and identifies itself as "ver 3.3 12-Apr-2006",
the same version of the copy in TeX-Live 2009.

Of course, formatted LaTeX documents are easier to read.
But naturally it costs time to write them.

indeed.  manuel asked me some time back about this area, and i've
generated a documented version of my own trivial capt-of package[*], and
done some work on generating .tex docs for url.sty and chapterbib.sty

url i've nearly finished, but i'm floundering with chapterbib.

sure, it takes time, but it beats letting the devil find work of an idle
pair of hands...

It does. However, it doesn't look for .sty unless explicitly requested, hence
the aliases like 'url = url.sty'. Maybe texdoc could automatically look for .sty
files when no results are found, but it looked easier for me to generate those
aliases; .sty files already are a special case in many aspects in current texdoc.

Moreover, my personal opinion is that it is desirable that every package has a
documentation in pdf, html or txt format, so I didn't want to spend more code
than necessary on the .sty case, hoping that this special case would slowly
disappear :-)

Should I extract the textual documentation and send it to ctan?
In some of my other packages I delimit the instructions as so:

%====================== BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS ===========================
%====================== END INSTRUCTIONS ===========================

and I should also do that with ulem.  I at one point thought that
texdoc would be able to extract on the fly.

Hmmm, the version on ctan is 2000 whereas my copy is 2004, so some minor
fixes went unreleased.

On the other hand, I am not averse to making a crude LaTeX document
out of the instructions.  Should I do that and avoid special handling?

As part of making a new version, I may include some more command
definitions that I have posted on c.t.t over the years.

OK, that sounds easy.

Does texdoc ordinarily search for pdf/ps/txt in some order,
without any special aliases?  I imagine there are aliases for
such things as "graphics" -> "grfguide".

The 2000 date is for ulem.sty.

Message-ID: <2019B1CD-08BF-4F35-91F5-68C64EE3964B@site.uottawa.ca>

Hi!

I recently purchased a new computer and installed TeX Live 2009.

I ran intro trouble when using htlatex on files where I am also using babel/french. These documents used to work fine with previous versions of the distribution, but now fail.

I was able to create a small example to reproduce the problem. As far as I understand, it's the presence ':' before the itemized list that causes the problem.

Your help would be much appreciated!
Marcel

encl: a small example to illustrate the problem, this works fine using pdflatex, but fails using htlatex (but only for TeX Live 2009).

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[french]{babel}
\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
\usepackage[pdftex,colorlinks]{hyperref}
\pdfcatalog{ /PageMode /UseNone }
\else
\usepackage{hyperref}
\fi
\begin{document}
Un simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item avant une liste
\end{itemize}
The presence of `:' immediately before the itemized list causes the
following error when using htlatex.
\begin{verbatim}

Oh wow!  Obviously I should not start on those!

I will submit a new version of ulem shortly with a .tex (and .pdf)
for the documentation.  It looks very straight-forward (as long
as the docs don't include code and its comments).

One big enumerated list ? :-)

\begin{verbatim}

 chapterbib.sty   Version
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   1.15 (30-JUL-2009) DA (typo \CitationPrefix)
 ...
\end{verbatim}

? :-D

There is unfortunately a slight incompatibility between the version of frenchb
included in TL09 and tex4ht. The maintainers of both tex4ht and frenchb are
aware of it, and the problem was solved with french 2.4, but it will take take
for it to be incorporated in babel hence in TL.

In the meanwhile, you can either grand a newer frenchb from Daniel's site [1]
and install it locally, or add the following lines to your premable as a
temporary workaround:

+  \makeatletter
+  \AtBeginDocument{\let\FDP at space\FDP at colonspace}
+  \makeatother

(That's the hack I used to get the French documentation of TeX Live compile with
tex4ht on TL09...)

Thanks a lot for your precise report. I wish everyone gave as much information

I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this, and wanted
to look in TeX.web to see how DEK had implemented DVI commenting
in TeX, but was very surprised to find no instance of TeX.web
in my TeX Live (2009) distribution; is this an accidental
(albeit very regrettable) oversight, or an intentional omission ?

It _must_ be in sources.

TeX Live:

Except for the answers package, all sources for latex packages
are in source/latex/. For the answers package, they are in
source/tex/latex/. I don't know if this is contrary to the TDS,
but it certainly makes them harder to find.

Hi Phil, 
the installer doesn't install any sources.  This would blow up
the system too much.  Consider network installs.

But if you have the DVD, uncompress and untar the file

  /path/to/DVD/source/texlive-20091011-source.tar.xz

It contains a file "texlive-20091011-source/texk/web2c/tex.web".

Anyway, if you are only interested in tex.web, the easiest way to get
it is to download it from the repository: 

  http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/web2c/tex.web

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <4326b7601001241434p7186536cn693a8b17dc57941e@mail.gmail.com>

I've been working on the fixed and new version of geometry package lately.
The source is done, but the doc and packaging are not yet.
While doing them, I'd appreciate it if anybody could check whether the attached
geometry.sty (v5.0 pre) works well in XeTeX and any other systems.
If there're any problems and suggestions, I'll try to reflect to the
CTAN release of v5.0
I'm going to make it soon, anyway.

New features in v5.0 are outlined below:

* fixed driver auto-detection.
   - add `xetex' driver option
   - ignore \pdf{h,v}origin if undefined.

* added \newgeometry{...} and \restoregeometry commands
  to change and restore geometry on any pages in the middle of the document
   - \newgeometry has the same options as geometry package, but changing
     papersize and \mag are not allowed.
   - \restoregeometry restores the page layout specified in the preamble.
   - both call \clearpage internally.

* added `layout' option. you can specify papersize for layout
different from printing.
  This would be useful when you don't have right-sized paper to print.
  For example, with "a4paper, layout=a5paper", the package goes to `a5' layout
  to calculate margins but paper size is still 'a4' paper.

* improved `showframe' output: now shown on every page.

* improved paper size presets.

* improved "geometry.cfg" loading order.

* fixed other bugs...

Hope it helps

when collection-latexrecommended and scheme-basic is already installed on

Live builds smoothly again?

Subject: [tex-live] can you remove a package from TeXLive?
Message-ID: <20100125105016.GA20290@kaist.edu>

Hello,

I'm afraid I need to request that a package be removed from TeXLive. I'm
the maintainer of SageTeX [1], which works with Sage [2] and LaTeX.
Since Sage is (largely) a Python program, SageTeX uses both a Python
module and LaTeX style file, and these two things need to be
synchronized if SageTeX is going to work.

A new version of Sage gets released once a month or so, and while
TeXLive is updated frequently, I don't think most users update TL as
often as they might update Sage. I've already run into problems with
sagetex.sty from TL shadowing the version from Sage, so I think in this
case it would be best to request that SageTeX be removed from TL.

I hate doing this, as I'm very pleased that my work has been included
with TL, but I think it's probably the best thing to do.

Thanks,

Dan

Why don't you get the sage update process to also call tlmgr to update the TeXLive package?

This would be much more convenient for users than them having to manually reinstall sagetex every time they update sage?

tl takes its content from ctan.  the latest sagetex on ctan dates from
june last year.  if what you say is true, we should remove sagetex from
ctan, too, because there seems no way to mirror it.

this has the plus side that it will then be automatically removed from
tl; i don't know what miktex's policies are, so i suggest you send a
similar message to the miktex support address (whatever that is).

anyway, shall i delete sagetex from ctan now?

but it would be troublesome for dan, since he would have to get a new

Currently, <http://wiki.sagemath.org/#Images.2BAC8Plotting.2BAC8Art>
points to CTAN for sagetex.  Is there another place to find it?   It does
not appear to be included in the Ubuntu 9.10 packages.

In my view, there is no point putting something that can only be used with
one 3rd party app in TL -- it just makes work for all concerned.  TL and
MiKTeX both make it easy to include additional texmf trees -- why not tell
sage to RTF {TL,miktex} M and add a sagetex texmf tree, which would
need to be included in the distribution?

If sage updates don't change the top level directory then the texmf
directory only needs to be set once.  If file names are changed, the installer
can regenerate the ls-R or fndb as appropriate, but I assume most
updates would reuse the names.

It was my point of view with Asymptote. However if sagetex.sty is
automatically installed into texmf-local (as asymptote does when
compiling/installing from the source) then it takes priority over  its
counterpart in texmf-dist

Using texmf-local for newer versions is risky -- when an even newer
version does appear on CTAN and makes it to a package you have to
remember to remove the old version from texmf-local.   Around here,
texmf-local gets copied across multiple machines, so it is nice if it
is the same everywhere.  I sometimes create a texmf-updates for
things that are slow to get into TL if we need them to fix a broken
document or for tests.

I am well aware of this - and bitched about this asking for tlmgr or
its sidekick to check texmf-local
But I suggest for 3rd party software which uses some style should take
care in installing it

The version of Sage in Debian/Ubuntu is hopelessly outdated and right
now no one is working on getting new packages prepared. SageTeX will be
included in the next Sage released, and we can switch links and so on to
the Sage documentation.

That's roughly what I've done in the current documentation. When you say
"add a texmf tree", do you mean add an entire new tree that tools like
kpsewhich look through, in addition to texmkf-local, ~/texmf, and so on? 

Oh, and as far as MikTeX goes: Sage doesn't currently work on Windows,
so I've been ignoring it. Getting Sage ported to Windows will be much,
much more difficult than getting SageTeX added into MikTeX.

Hi Jindrich,

    I'm experiencing this behaviour for at least few weeks back. The latest
    TeXLive build hangs with:
    
    kpathsea: Running mktextfm ptmr7t

It doesn't happen for me when doing our build.
What part of your "build" is trying to access the font?
That is, what comes before that msg you started with?

    It seems that obsoleted "times" package is at fault here. 

I see nothing wrong with the times package, nor would I exactly consider
it "obsoleted", in the sense that we'll never remove it, even though
better alternatives exist.  Anyway, nothing has changed wrt ptmr7t and
the like for many years.

The error is happening because something is expecting to find
ptmr7t.tfm.  It exists in the TL tree
(texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/adobe/times/ptmr7t.tfm).  It doesn't exist in yours
if all you have is scheme-basic.  You need collection-fontsrecommended.
The purpose of basic is to be basic, I don't want to include all the PS
font stuff there.

i.e., there's a .deb containing an outdated sage system?  or there's
no-one working to update sagetex to current ctan standards?  (we know
that's false.)

of course, since sagetex is already in miktex.

however, we don't know (since you've not answered my question about
ctan) whether you consider that our (ctan's) holding of sagetex is
outdated.  since texlive and miktex have what ctan holds, this seems a
significant germane question.

do you want me to delete the ctan holding?

The .deb for Sage is outdated.

CTAN's copy of SageTeX is pretty current. I've noticed that updates to
CTAN happen pretty quickly; I'm concerned here about how long it would
take for updates to filter into TL or MikTeX, and then into other
packaging systems, etc.

It seems like it would be nice if SageTeX stayed on CTAN, but was not
included in TL. I don't know how reasonable or easy that arrangement is,
though.

Hi Dan,

    I'm concerned here about how long it would
    take for updates to filter into TL or MikTeX

Both TL and miktex usually update from CTAN within a few days.
When users update is up to them, and many don't (ever).

    It seems like it would be nice if SageTeX stayed on CTAN, but was
    not included in TL. I don't know how reasonable or easy that
    arrangement is,

If that's what you want, I certainly have no objection.  It is no
problem at all for that to be the case.

so sagetex is ok?

ctan installation should be within a day of submission.

cataloguing happens within a day, often within a minute or so of
installation.

tex live typically packages within a day of ctan installation.

miktex packages once a week, roughly.

Hi all,

I once installed the Texlive2009 in my Windows 7 system and uninstalled
that using the control panel. Now I want to install it again. While I
double click the file install-tl.bat, I was told that

Can't spawn "cmd.exe": No such file or directory at
..../tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm line 2047

I guess my uninstall was not clean, and I can not reinstall now. I saw
solutions for Linux system. Is there any solution for Windows?

Thanks a lot!

Hi,

A few minutes ago I completed the update of TL 09 with tlmgr (gui-old, to which I'm accustomed). I first had to update

Then it restarted to do the full upgrade, which went well (all ``... done''), and finally

I don't understand this last ``Segmentation fault''. As I said, everything seems to have gone fine, and I have typeset a whole book with pdfLaTeX and I see no problem at all.

I can imagine two reasons:

1. TeXLive remained in your PATH and it is now trying to search for
perl there. Look into your settings and remove it

2. Something from install-tl.zip is missing, it may be better to get a
fresh copy

This font set (mathdesign uses garamond font) doesn't distributed with
TL.

You should either download fonts and install them manually or (not
checked) use getnonfreefont script (search tug).

I can't speak about sagetex, but sage in Debian is uninstallable in Debian's sid 
distribution. I'm CC'ing the maintainer, via a new bug filed with bugs.debian.org.

I tried to install sagemath on my computer, since I needed to do some lenghty 
calculations. :-(

To be fair, it seems that the package needs some work upstream:

http://bugs.debian.org/535357

I don't know if the newer sources fix the problem there, but it would be really 
nice to have this fixed before the new releases of Debian/Ubuntu.

Are you using 32-bit or 64-bit version of Ubuntu? I have x86_64:

$ uname -mrv
2.6.31-17-generic #54-Ubuntu SMP Thu Dec 10 17:01:44 UTC 2009 x86_64

also updated via command-line a few minutes ago, but it didn't run fmtutil.

Ubuntu has had quite a few updates recently -- is your system current?

It doesn't look like the segmentation fault came from the pdftex format
builds.   I tried a few installs using guiold and didn't enocunter any
nasty behavours.   You might want to look through the logs (dmesg,
messages.log, Xorg.0.log) for signs of trouble elsewhere in the system.

According to the xelatex error message below, it seems that the tfm
file and the map file is found but not the pfb file.  Installing the
fonts manually is error-prone.  Obviously only the content of ugm.zip
was installed, which doesn't contain the actual fonts.

It's easier indeed to use getnonfreefonts:

situation. I have searched everything named texlive and deleted them, but

I just looked into these logs (and the previous archived) and didn't find the string ``Segmentation''. Also, the tlmgr.log ends just with the last item updated:

So I think it will remain a mystery for me. But, as I said, everything seems to be working fine.

Subject: [tex-live] Non-PDF documentation
Message-ID: <9A95499E-72EB-4E03-A2F3-892C4622A2C5@yahoo.de>

Hello,

are there any plans to convert non-PDF manuals to PDF? I think PS and DVI manuals are inconvenient for many because end users generally have no DVI or PostScript viewer installed. For example, on Mac OS X, PDFs can be viewed natively, whereas DVIs and PSs have to be converted on the fly and look much worse.
To be specific, I found at least two packages without PDF documentation: ucs has only ucs.ps.gz (using compression and PostScript), and german has gerdoc.dvi and gerdoc.tex, but no gerdoc.pdf. I created PDF versions of these manuals in my home tree, and added appropriate aliases (ucs = ucs, german = german/gerdoc, ngerman = german/gerdoc) to texmf.cnf to be able to read them.

Regards,
Philipp

I agree with you. Actually there are such plans. At least Robin an I have been
converting dvi/ps documentation to pdf (or generating pdf documentation when no
compiled doc was available at all) for some time. As for me, I didn't work on it
recently, perhaps Robin is still taking care of it.

If you want to track packages with only dvi/ps, your help will be very welcome.
Please upload your PDFs to CTAN and we'll import them in TL. (Generally, the
packages concerned are quite old so they may not be integrated in our update
detection system. So, if you upload a pdf and notice it doesn't made it into TL
one week later, please inform us.)

> To be specific, I found at least two packages without PDF documentation:

Last time I checked, there was far more than 2 of them...

Thanks for these documents. Now where url.pdf and capt-of.pdf are there, I think the aliases for TeXdoc can be removed.

A segmentation fault is usually caused by a program or a shared
library, not by a script.  This means that the culprit is either a
program called by tlmgr, or Perl itself.

Since you are using the GUI, there is also Tk which could cause
problems if it's not installed properly.  This is quite likely because
the segfault happened after the "Completed."-message.  Hence, I also
think that the update was successful and everything works as expected.

In order to find out whether it's a Perl-Tk issue, I suggest to do the
next update on the command line:

  tlmgr --all --self

It would be nice to know whether this works.

Regards,
  Reinhard

mpost works without problems.

Can anyone help?

Subject: [tex-live] segfault in pdflatex
Message-ID: <20100128170224.7714b151@solsar.slowdive.dyndns.org>

Hi - 

pdflatex segfaults in libc when including graphics in specific
circumstances in texlive-2009.  It is location-specific (certain
location in the file - seems like when its near the top of a page).

If there is a ./ at the beginning of the \graphicspath, and no path on
the \includegraphics item, it segfaults.  If there is no \graphicspath,
but a ./ at the beginning of the \includegraphics item, it segfaults.
Again, this is only for a pdf at a certain location (tried with multiple
pdfs).  

Here's the backtrace:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xb7b6b17b in strlen () from /lib/libc.so.6
(gdb) backtrace
#0  0xb7b6b17b in strlen () from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0xb7e688c3 in GlobalParams::scanEncodingDirs() ()
from /usr/lib/libpoppler.so.5 
#2  0xb7e699cf in GlobalParams::GlobalParams(char const*) ()

#4  0x080bb753 in ?? () 
#5  0x0860a120 in ?? () 
#6  0x00000000 in ?? ()

That's probably not enough info to debug fully, but I can't provide
the .tex I'm using at this time.  If there's something I can try to
debug this more, let me know.

If you want to follow-up with me on this, email me directly (I'm not on
the mailing list).

[Thu Jan 28 02:55:23 2010] update: ifluatex (16759 -> 16833)

[Thu Jan 28 02:55:44 2010] update: scheme-basic (13822 -> 16819)

After this I found the url package was gone as one of my docs failed to

I've taken the opportunity to try ``tlmgr update --all --self'' right now, with a few packages to update and install, and everything went well, with no segfault message whatsoever.

But I should say that I've used the GUI of tlmgr many, many times, and it's the first time that I have noticed this ``Segmentation fault''.

Thank you.

Yes, you should provide minimal example which will illustrate the
problem.

I made small example that works fine:

<file sample1.tex>
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

%\graphicspath{./figures}

\includegraphics{./figures/sampl1.pdf}

\end{document}
</file>

Here code (asymptote) for sampl1.pdf:
<file sampl1.asy>
pair P[];

P[0] = (0,0);
P[1] = (0,1);
P[2] = (1,1);

draw(P[0]--P[1]--P[2]--cycle);
</file>

url is no longer a ltxmisc package, it is part of its own (new) package.

this has also happened to capt-of, and i uploaded a new ulem last night
which may already have made it to its own package.

you've observed the down-side; the positive is that all these packages
have a separate documentation file (previously they all had
"documentation in the .sty").

(cite bundle package is next in my sights...i've already completed
chapterbib, which is potentially the most taxing.  those packages will
all remain together, i think.)

Not much of downside. I just want to make sure the integrity of the
update so that when things go wrong I know where to look.

Same opinion here.

Also either miscdoc.sty is a package for general use, then
it should become its own package, not part of url. Or
miscdoc.sty is just "source" for the documentation,
then it should also go to TDS:source/latex/url/.

At any case it should get a license.

Of course I would like to see something like
  \RequirePackage[pdfusetitle]{hyperref}
  \RequirePackage{bookmark}
  \bookmarksetup{numbered,open,openlevel=1}
in url.tex or miscdoc.sty to get bookmarks. :-)

Yours sincerely

it's only a doc file.  i tend to put such files on my own (home)texmf
tree, but i tend not to recompile them once installed, so i guess i'm
not a good reference.

i agree.

> At any case it should get a license.

you're right.  miscdoc was a convenience for writing documentation, and
as a result slipped under my radar.  will sort all these issues out over
the w/e.

noted.  perhaps i ought to make it optional in miscdoc.  (what one needs
is an "\AtEndOfOptions" command for this sort of thing...)

How can I add something to an existing packages that was not written by me? Is that covered by the LPPL and by CTAN's upload mechanism?
Anyway, I've written a tiny program that looks for non-existing and non-PDF docs. I've attached the program and the lists that are created on my system (excluding the ucs and german packages). To date, it lists 1213 packages without any documentation (that's around 42% of all packages), and 316 packages without PDF manual (11% of all packages).
The new texdoc doesn't seem to warn about switching to full search mode any more. The previous version of the program also listed those packages as undocumented, adding some 400 more to the list.

Well, the error message says that that the system command interpreter
is not found !?! No idea why.

Apparently, cmd.exe is found on the PATH or an error would be thrown
much earlier in runscript.tlu. For some unknown reason, however,
spawning a new cmd.exe instance fails. I cannot reproduce this
behaviour on my machine, though. I will need more info from you to
troubleshoot this.

Can you run the following lua script for me (save it as test.lua and
execute with `texlua test.lua'):

assert(os.spawn("C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c echo All is OK"))
assert(os.spawn({[0]="C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe", "cmd", "/c echo
All is OK"}))

It should output "All is OK" twice.

In the meantime try running:

  mptopdf.bat test.mp

This should allow you to get on with your work.

Cheers,

Tomek

Hi,

thanks for your help. I tried running your script and it does indeed
return "All is OK" twice.
I also tried running mptopdf.bat before, it terminates but doesn't
generate any output (mpost does, as I said).

I'm not familiar with the script language, but maybe you could tell me
how to print the content of the table "program" in the line where the
script fails?

if (atype == 'table') then
  os.exit(assert(os.spawn(program)))
elseif
  ...

I appreciate your help,
Georg

Whcih distribution do you use?

Please report a bug there, that is NOT (!!!!) a TeX Live problem.

This is a consequence in linking the binaries with libpoppler
instead of the included xpdf lib.

That is, as seen in the backtrace, a bug in libpoppler and has nothing
to do with TeX Live.

Thanks.

Well, I don't think transforming dvi/ps in PDF (or event compiling a .tex or
.dtx file) is really adding something to the package, for a licence point of
view. (Taking the comments out of a .sty and turning them into a pdf is another
question.)

Concerning CTAN upload, I think uploading just the generated pdfs to one node's
incoming directory, and asking one of the CTAN admins (or perhaps the collective
ctan@ address is preferred) to add it it the appropriate package is the best.

I'll answer that part later, needs more time. Anyway, thanks a lot for your

Message-ID: <b3260f791001290626v7e5f7e21x4cf47656cbebe4b5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list!

I have hit a problem while upgrading texlive under debian testing. I get a
configuration error with texlive-latex-base. This makes it impossible to
install the texlive-publishers package, and it makes it impossible to export
my lyx files into tex, so I can compile them by hand...

The reason I am writing on this list is that I have tried on the debian-user
list and gotten no answer. I am becoming desperate, because I am working on
a lyx document which is trapped in lyx world, and cannot be exported to tex,
pdf, or anything else, because of this...

I am hoping that there are some debian users on this list that might give me
a helping hand...

I found out that the problem was that I had no ruby interpreter
installed on my system (while texlive seems to include perl, it
doesn't provide ruby). It works now (thanks to your help).

Thanks,
Georg

certainly, i've announced that i will generate pdf docs for packages as
and when i feel like it.

as for uploading, remember that only ftp.tex.ac.uk runs a /incoming
service, now -- all three ctan sites offer web upload, but i remain
behind the times (in this as in so many ways...).

note that there are circumstances where i've looked at a package on ctan
and found it difficult to regenerate.  a case in point would be ucs: i
thought it had non-scaleable fonts in places where it had a choice, and
that's why i've not converted the the .ps -- regenerating it would be
too painful for words.

i'll second that.

Please try the debian-tex-maint list, or file a bug in the Debian BTS. This list
is about upstream TeX Live, so we can't do anything about Debian packages
configuration problem.

Still, it is very strange that the error came from runscript.tlu (as
you reported) and not somewhere from mptopdf, i.e. the mptopdf process
should be spawned properly in any case and the fact that it might fail
and return with a non-zero exit code is inconsequential to
runscript.tlu -- it will just propagate this exit code silently to the
calling process to let it decide what to do with it.

Have you found the reason why the runscript.tlu script fails?

Cheers,

Tomek

Subject: [tex-live] arial.pfb and times.pfb in arabi.map cause dvips failures
Message-ID: <6d52a0f61001291405oe416bf6rb6ec23f82d423a42@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

texlive-2009 enables arabi.map by default. This map references
arial.pfb and times.pfb, both of which are not part of texlive
and not available with normal linux installs.

texlive/2009/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/arabi/arabi.map

artimes TimesNewRomanPSMT " UnicodeGlyphNamesArabicEncoding
ReEncodeFont " <arunicode.enc <times.pfb
frtimes TimesNewRomanPSMT " UnicodeGlyphNamesFarsiEncoding
ReEncodeFont " <frunicode.enc <times.pfb
ararial ArialMT " UnicodeGlyphNamesArabicEncoding ReEncodeFont "
<arunicode.enc <arial.pfb
frarial ArialMT " UnicodeGlyphNamesFarsiEncoding ReEncodeFont "
<frunicode.enc <arial.pfb


ArialMT and TimesNewRomanPSMT are fonts which are frequently used in
eps figures produced with MS software. When including such figures in
a latex document, dvips looks for the corresponding pfb files and
fails. E.g. this simple test file

> cat test.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphics}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{optcond2.eps}
\end{document}

gives

> dvips test.dvi
This is dvips(k) 5.98 Copyright 2009 Radical Eye Software (www.radicaleye.com)
' TeX output 2010.01.29:1442' -> t.ps
dvips: ! Couldn't find header file arial.pfb.


even though the figure has the necessary fonts embedded and declares so much

%%DocumentFonts: ArialMT
%%+ MyriadPro-Regular
%%+ TimesNewRomanPSMT
%%+ AdobeSongStd-Light-GBpc-EUC-H
%%DocumentSuppliedFonts: ArialMT
%%+ MyriadPro-Regular
%%+ TimesNewRomanPSMT
%%+ AdobeSongStd-Light-GBpc-EUC-H


apparently dvips doesn't remove the DocumentSuppliedFonts list from
the DocumentFonts list before looking for external fonts.
(commenting out the DocumentFonts line avoids the problem)

after disabling arabi.map the dvi file can be processed by dvips, but
gives warnings.

$ dvips  t.dvi

2 questions:

1) should arabi.map be disabled by default or should the map be split
into an optional part and a default part?

2) does the font handling of dvips need to be improved in these circumstances?


Cheers

    First of all: thank you for creating {url|...}.pdf! 

We all thank Robin profusely for this and much else :).

    But one question:
    shouldn't url.tex go into .../texmf-dist/source/latex/url?

url.tex is the source of the documentation.  I see no compelling reason
to prefer either doc or source.  In general, I think it's more helpful
not to proliferate subdirectories for tiny packages, so I didn't.

But installing miscdoc.sty in the runtime was a mistake that I didn't
notice.  I've moved that back to doc.

Looking forward to Robin's weekend releases.

Thanks for the report,
Karl

    texlive-2009 enables arabi.map by default. This map references
    arial.pfb and times.pfb, 

I agree that arabi.map should not do that.  Can you please write the
arabi author (Youssef Jabri, yjabri (at) ensa.univ-oujda.ac.ma) about it?

    apparently dvips doesn't remove the DocumentSuppliedFonts list from
    the DocumentFonts list before looking for external fonts.

You mean it shouldn't look for the DocumentSuppliedFonts?  I suppose
that's so.

    after disabling arabi.map the dvi file can be processed by dvips, but
    gives warnings.

Is the dvips output (without arabi.map) correct?  The warnings are just
warnings, after all.

Thanks for the report.

First of all, avoid MS software.  Microsoft doesn't know what .eps is,
maybe even deliberately.  The BoundingBox is almost(?) always wrong
and you have determine the correct values yourself.  Regarding the
fonts, programs should include them if they are not ubiquitous.

What you could try is to copy the content of the directory 

   texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/tex-gyre

to 

   c:\windows\fonts

and use TeXGyreHeros-Regular instead of ArialMT and
TeXGyreTermes-Regular instead of TimesNewRomanPSMT in your graphics.

The TeXGyre fonts should be found by dvips.

Maybe it's even better to copy the content of
texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/tex-gyre to c:\windows\fonts but I
don't have Windows and can't test anything.

Another thing you could try is to install ghostscript and add aliases
like this to lib/Fontmap:

/ArialMT	                /NimbusSanL-Regu ;
/TimesNewRomanPSMT              /NimbusRomNo9L-Regu ;

Then programs like ps2pdf or eps2eps can insert the URW versions at
least. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

we are using a standard texlive-2009 setup (on linux) to process third
party contributed material (several thousand/month). While I can think
of many workarounds, I believe it is simply wrong of arabi.map to
reference a non-free font by default. This should be optional. In our
case we simpy disabled arabi.map, which is trivial to do (updmap-sys
--disable arabi.map), however my intention was to point out the
underlying problem.

I could have also altered arabi.map and simply removed the 4 lines
referring to times.pfb and arial.pfb

gs has no issues with these figures. They do not require system fonts,
because they are self-contained with all the necessary fonts embedded.
It is dvips in combination with arabi.map which is problematic.

with arabi.map dvips fails

yes, I think that would be the most robust approach (unless figures
lie about their fonts), and pretty obvious for a single figure.

I believe there is some attempt to combine fonts from all figures in a
document in some sensible way, to avoid multiple inclusion. However
with (subsetted) embedded fonts I don't see how this can be done in a
robust way, because the font name is not necessarily a unique
identifier for the actual font used.

So time ago I found one solution for the same problem: I did several
conversion: eps->pdf->eps:
bash$ epstopdf file.eps
bash$ pdftops -e file.pdf
This assumes that all fonts are embedded into first eps file.

This advice doesn't help you with map file but could be used to get rid
of explicit font reference in eps file.

IIRC, eps2eps is enough, it'll convert any fonts into outlines, but this
might not be an acceptable solution (unselectable text).

Hi Andreas,

    missing or wrong in texmf.cnf, corrected items below:

    BSTINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/bst//

    # where to look for bibtex8 code sort files
    CSFINPUT = .;$TEXMF/bibtex/cfs//

Looking at bibtex8/utils.c, around line 718:

#ifdef KPATHSEA
          status = ((full_filespec = kpse_find_file(filename, kpse_bst_format, false)) == NULL);
#else
            status = find_file (CSF_INPUT_ENVVAR, CSF_INPUT_PATH,
                                filename, full_filespec);
#endif

Of course we compile with -DKPATHSEA.  Therefore it is correct for the
TL texmf.cnf to only set BSTINPUTS, and for BSTINPUTS to also include
csf files.  There is no separate path in kpse for csf, and I don't see a
need for one.


    no links in documentation /usr/local/texlive/2009/doc.html to
            bibtex8 in /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf/doc/bibtex8
            ae in /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/ae

No documentation exists, that I can see; texdoc -l bibtex8 shows the
readme file, etc.  Would you like to write a man page for it?  Or maybe
some distro has one?

Thanks,
Karl

    missing documentation
            symbols of textcomp

textcomp.sty is generated from ltoutenc, so it seems to me the best we
can do (lacking dedicated documentation, which presumably will not be
forthcoming) is to alias textcomp to ltoutenc in texdoc.

However ... TL 2008 had a ltoutenc.pdf, but it does not exist in TL'09.

Heiko, was this intentional?  (What we install in TL comes straight from
your latex-tds project, for which I am ever so thankful, BTW.)

Yes, because it is part of source2e as "File l".
The LaTeX kernel sources consists of 40 dtx files.
I doubt it makes sense to generate separate PDF files
additionally. Thus `textcomp' should be aliased to `source2e'.
This might be a little irritating, but simple text search for
"textcomp" reveals "20.2 The textcomp package" in the table
of contents. If a user fails with simple text search, then
I don't think he wouldn't happier with ltoutenc.pdf. It doesn't
have a table of contents and the package is described quite late.
Also the description is more documented source code for developers
than a comprehensive user manual.

Also there are even classes in latex/base that lacks
PDF files at all: minimal.cls; "texdoc minimal" finds
  texmf-dist/doc/latex/europecv/examples/minimal.pdf
and "texdoc minimal.cls" doesn't find documentation.
It's a similar case like url.sty, the class is documented
in the class file itself.

Other example, "texdoc makeidx" finds makeindx.pdf that
describes packages makeidx and showidx, but "texdoc showidx"
doesn't find documentation.

Yours sincerely

That is a bug you should send to the Debian bug tracking system,
it has *NO* place at all here.

Furthermore, if you report something, it is helpful to change
the language to English, so that people don't have a hard time reading
your reports.

Which version of texlive-latex-base do you have installed? You have
to upgrade *all* packages of texlive, not just paticular ones.

In Debian texlive 2009 there is no

> This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.50.0-2009122515 (INITEX)

That seems to be the right version.

Please report:
- version of texlive-latex-base
- version of luatex
(find them with dpkg -l XXXXXX)

Best wishes

documentation of encodings is in the latex doc encguide, which we put
together some time around 2000, and that contains the twisty little
passages that criss-cross the various sub-encodings of TS1.  there isn't
much that textcomp can do that isn't covered by encguide, i thought.

i had missed the appearance of the documentation, let alone its
subsequent disappearance.

except, of course, that url.sty now has free-standing docs, so it's not
really a good example.

cite.sty, maybe.  for the rest of this weekend at least (i have it in
hand, but may not complete by tomorrow because my wife is ill).
