Dear Colleagues -- Following a clean install of TL 2009 on this
machine yesterday, I now see that TEXMFLOCAL is in

     E:/TeX/Live/TeXMF/Local/

rather than in

     E:/TeX/Live/2009/TeXMF/Local/

as I had intended.  How can I retrospectively move this
folder such that all continues to work ?

Edit TEXMFLOCAL variable in <TL ROOT>/texmf.cnf.

On my Linux + TL '10 system, this works:

chesky at derrial:~$ kpsewhich texmf.cnf
/opt/texlive/2010/texmf.cnf
chesky at derrial:~$ cat /opt/texlive/2010/texmf.cnf
% This texmf.cnf file should contain only your personal changes from the
% main texmf.cnf.
%
% Do NOT change values in the main file (which is in
% .../texlive/YYYY/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf), as YOUR CHANGES WILL BE LOST
% by later updates.
%
% If you need to make changes to texmf.cnf, put your custom settings in
% this file instead, which is YYYY/texmf.cnf.  And insert *only* your
% changed values.
%
TEXMFHOME = /home/chesky/texmf
chesky at derrial:~$

I'd guess you should edit the file pointed to by `kpsewhich texmf.cnf'
and include your override of TEXMFLOCAL.

A little bit of topic, but I know Taco usually reads the list

Is it possible to provide options to mpost through the mptopdf interface?

I would like mpost to run in nonstopmode, but I cannot do that since I 
don't know anything about texexec or how it pass options on to its 
subprocesses.

ideas?

Run mpost and mptopdf separately:

         mptopdf <file>

Remind by a message from Barbara that I had not yet started
participating in TeX Live 2010 trialling, I decided to take
advantage of the fact that I had gained a day (I thought today
was Monday, and was very confused when both my central
heating system and my computer claimed it was Sunday) to
make a start; I am afraid that initial impressions are not very
favourable :

1)  At http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

this part is OK :

but this part :

> The exact http://somehost/some/path urls to use are link targets on the texlive-pretest mirmon page.

is extraordinarily poor :

2) Option-3 should read :

install-tl-advanced  -location=<location> ! for advanced/expert GUI installation

3) The text "In the case of the installer package" conveys nothing.

4) The text "The exact http://somehost/some/path urls to use are link targets on the texlive-pretest mirmon page"

is far too opaque : "are link targets" is only too easily missed, and as the
real "targets" appear nowhere in plain text on the referenced page (why not ?),
it takes some time to realise one has to dereference a link to find a real
value for "-location".

5) The GUI installer seems just as buggy as the 2008 version (this is now 2010) --
click at-end and reverse drag to highlight the value of the field "Enter path for TeXdir ..."
followed by overtype /still/ leave the newly typed text highlit and self-destructing.

When I first reported this in 2008, I was told a new version of PERLTK was needed
to address this problem; the same was repeated in 2009; surely two years after
my first report, a  newer version must by now have emerged ???

No it hasn't. The last version was released a month or so ago and
none of us had the time to build and include it into perl/w32.

The rest of the comments are interesting, but not so importatnt,
we are discussion *pretest*, so you are expected to read and understand
the text, even if some parameters are explained later than expected.

I see a new version was released in January :

	 	Tk-804.028_502  	 [Download] [Browse]   	30 Jan 2010  ** DEVELOPER RELEASE **

Was that version considered for adoption ?

Yes, we /are/ discussing "pretest", and I assume (I hope correctly)
that you want pre-testers.  My point is that you are making it
unnecessarily difficult for pre-testers to even get started --
surely it is not that difficult to write a brief introduction to
the process of pre-testing that actually /helps/ potential
pre-testers rather than acting as a deterrent ?

It is tagged as a developer release. I didn't look into it, but it doesn't sound
like it means "ready for production".

Pretesters are expected to be advanced users, and to easily come and talk on the
TL list. When they do so, we help them installing if necessary. For now, we
didn't have so many questions about the pretesting process on the list (but many
bug reports about pretest, indicating we do have pretesters), so I guess the
explanations on the page are more or less suited to the average pretester.

OK, fair enough : I am happy to accept that you and Norbert are confident
that everything in the garden is rosy, and that feedback such as mine
is either an indication that I am not an advanced user or that I feel
inhibited in raising queries on the TL list.

I now start to remember why, each year that a new TeX Live
pre-test is announced, I feel ever more reluctant to participate.

Just in case I become sufficiently put off by the reactions to
my first feedback on the TL 2010 pretest procedure/documentation
to abort pre-testing before I've really started, I will post the following :

Additional whinge(s) :

5) It is extremely annoying that the installer insists on
re-writing backslashes as forward slashes.  Backslashes
are the norm in Windows, and if one wants to copy
and paste a proposed location, this simply will not work
once the slashes have been reversed.  Why can they not
be left in the default orientation for the platform, and/or
as typed/inserted by the user ?

Don't take me wrong: I'm not saying either of these. Your message left me with
the impression that you understand the download/installation process well enough
to give it a try, and I was just saying that if it is not the case, we'll
happily answer your questions here.

The page about pretest is only temporary and targeted at a specific audience. As
far as I am concerned, your feedback about the actual distro is much more
interesting than about this temporary page.

Your feedback about the distro is always welcome, as are your questions about

Hi Phil and Karl,
Phil, I just looked into the HTML sources.  Please note that the word
"location" is set in italics.  So it's clear that it's a placeholder.
Do your web browsers display the word "location" in italics?  I can
imagine some problems with <tt><i>foo</i></tt> if the default
typewriter font has no italics variant.  I'm using Latin Modern
Typewriter (at 8pt) and Firefox obviously doesn't find the italics
version.  It's using a slanted version instead and I assume that it's
fontconfig which provides it as a workaround.

I already have a modified version of pretest.html at

   http://tug.org/~kotucha/pretest.html

which is rendered much better by Firefox and avoids problems
concerning font selection in other web browsers too.  It simply uses a
Roman italic font instead of an italic typewriter font.

Karl, I could send you a patch, but I think it's much less effort for
you if you simply replace your file by mine on the TUG server.  You
can run

  diff /home/httpd/html/texlive/pretest.html /home/kotucha/pretest.html

in order to see what I changed.

| <ul>
| <li><tt>install-tl <i>location</i> -gui text</tt> for text (command
|      line) mode; default on Unix.
| <li><tt>install-tl <i>location</i> -gui wizard</tt> for a maximally
|     simplified GUI installation asking only the minimal questions;
|     default on Windows.
| <li><tt>install-tl <i>location</i> -gui perltk</tt> for advanced/expert
|     GUI installation with the usual array of options; requires <a
|     href="distro.html#perltk">Perl/Tk</a>.
| </ul>
| 
| <p>In the case of the installer package, the pretest repository
| <i>location</i> to install from must be specified:<br>
| 
| <tt>install-tl&nbsp;-repository&nbsp;http://somehost/some/path&nbsp;...</tt>
| <br>
| The exact <tt>http://somehost/some/path</tt> urls to use are link
| targets on the <a href="mirmon/">texlive-pretest mirmon page</a>.
| 
| 
| <p>But in the case of mirroring, no <i>location</i> should be specified
| at all.  The installer will automatically find its files in the current
| directory.
| 
| <p>For information on all of the installer options, run
| <tt>install-tl&nbsp;--help</tt>, or see the <a
| href="doc/install-tl.html">install-tl documentation page</a>.

Sure, but I think that it's correct though.  The more one writes, the
more people can/will miss.  If one writes too much, it's unlikely that
people read it at all.  Thus I prefer to keep explanations short and
precise.

Because the author of mirmon decided so.  It's probably done this way
in order to save space, and I must admit that I dislike horizontal
scrollbars in web pages too.

 > it takes some time to realise one has to dereference a link to find
 > a real value for "-location".

Because you missed the phrase "are link targets".  Even then, I'm sure
that you don't expect the pretest stuff in the root directory of a
mirror.  That would mean that they don't provide anything else.  The
first thing I would try then is to click on the link.

Phil, I often waste a lot of time too because I'm missing obvious
things.  Don't worry, it just indicates that we're getting older.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Be happy that the TeX Live installer supports Windows at all.  This is
how it all started:

Norbert wrote some Perl modules for managing packages.  In order to
make use of Norbert's modules, we needed a new installer.  Norbert
said that he is not familiar enough with shell programming in order to
make his modules available to the teTeX installer.  I proposed that a
new installer had to be written in Perl because otherwise we can't
support Windows.  Then Pawel Jackowski, who was involved in
development of the Windows installer, said "please proceed".  I still
don't know what the phrase "please proceed" meant, but I suppose that
it was meant as "good luck" when I said that a new installer should
work on all platforms, including Windows.

It turned out that it's pretty easy to write an installer which works
on every platform, ..... except Windows.

Windows is a pain.  Nothing works as expected.  Bugs are not
documented.  Nothing is documented.  If you are interested in the
details, I could forward you abt. 5500 mails from the TL developers
list immediately.

I consider to write a book about Windows when I'm retired and have
nothing better to do.  The title of the book will be "Broken by Design".

Coming back to your question:

The MS-DOG API supported forward slashes and backslashes from the
beginning.  So, what is so wrong with forward slashes.

I fear that your next complaint is that on Windows options start with
a slash instead of a hyphen.  And later you might ask us to support
something like 

  progname/a/b/c

Sigh!

Regards,
  Reinhard

Dear Reinhard, et al --

I appreciate the fact that you have taken the trouble to look
at my message : I would just like to respond to a couple
of particular points :

> Phil, I just looked into the HTML sources.  Please note that the word
> "location" is set in italics.  So it's clear that it's a placeholder.

Yes, I see it in italics (just : I am using Palatino Linotype because
at the moment my primary preoccupation is preparing an ASP.NET
web form with embedded Greek), and I fully understood it was
a placeholder : but I anticipated that it was a placeholder for
a <location>, not for a prefix ("-location ") and /then/ a <location>.
That is the primary fault with that syntax.  And "In the case of
the installer package" really does just add confusion : if the page
is talking about "install-tl" (and it would seem that it is), then
why mention it at all, particularly by a different name ?  The whole
prose is about "install-tl", so why (a) mention it at this point, and
(b) confuse things by calling it "the installer package" ?

> Because the author of mirmon decided so.  It's probably done this way
> in order to save space, and I must admit that I dislike horizontal
> scrollbars in web pages too.

Surely you don't think that replacing (e.g., ) www.math.utah.edu
by  http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/ would cause
horizontal overflow ?  And WTF is the "@" sign doing there : /it/
dereferences to http://www.math.utah.edu/, so we have the insane
situation where www.math.utah.edu dereferences to
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlpretest/ and "@" dereferences
to http://www.math.utah.edu/ : I cannot imagine a less intuitive or
more confusing way of presenting such material.

> Windows is a pain.  Nothing works as expected.

On Windows, if I want to type a file, I type "type filename";
if I want a directory listing, I type "dir"; if I want help, I type
"help".  All work exactly as expected.  What do I do on Unix ?
I type "cat filename" to type a file; "ls" to get a directory listing;
and "man" to get some help.  Are you really suggesting that
these commands do what I would expect from their names ?????
I would expect "cat" to have something to do with Felix domesticus,
"man" with Homo sapiens, and as for "ls" I would have no expectations
at all and assume it was simply a typo.

(don't answer that : let's stick to TL 2010)

> The MS-DOG API supported forward slashes and backslashes from the
> beginning.  So, what is so wrong with forward slashes.

What is wrong with forward slashes is that they are (a) not what
Windows users expect; (b) not what Windows users would type
when entering a path; and (c) not understood by the CLI.
So if I enter (e.g.,) "E:\TeX\Live\Common\TeXMF\VAR"
and then this is re-presented by the installer as
"E:/TeX/Live/Common/TeXMF/VAR", I can't copy that string
and use it within CMS in any meaningful way.

> Be happy that the TeX Live installer supports Windows at all.

Why ? Windows is /the/ preferred platform, used by more people
than any other operating system in the world; why should I
be grateful that it is supported by the TeX Live installer ?  If
I were running CP/M, then I would indeed be grateful; if I were
running OS/360, I would be grateful, but I am running the world's
most popular and widely used operating system, so I think it
is not unreasonable to expect that it will be supported by
packages such as TeX Live.

Dear Reinhard,

you need to be aware that

according to the UN Universal Bill of Rights

"It is indispensable human right to have any software ported free of
charge to your preferred platform"

However, there is an UNHRC explanation that

"All animals are equal but Windows Users are more equal than others
and this right is applied only to them and to software developed for
Unix/Linux based systems and it is duty of developers to have more
than twice available software for Windows than for any other platform"

victor:

this is all very well and amusing, but one should recall that (a) tex
live advertises that it's available for widnoze, and (b) phil was
explicitly asked to investigate the latest version on a widnoze box.

i'm not keen on tex on windows, myself (i only ever use it when i've got
an issue for the faq), but it would be extremely unfortunate, imo, to
give the impression that tex _doesn't_ live well with windows *for those
that want/need it*.

It does nothing any more (and has not for a long time), I do not
know why it still exists. When it did do something, I am fairly
certain that it passed options to texexec, not mpost

That mptopdf can process mp input files at all should be seen as
a bonus feature, I think. Its core business is converting mp
output to pdf.

Best wishes,
Taco

After this night update asymptote as a part of TL pretest stopped to
work on MacOSX:

as "everything" but binaries got updated /usr/texbin/asy returns

It is not the case on x86_64-linux where asy binaries got updated to
version 2.00. BTW release is 2.01

Please do not consider this as a complain (c'est  pretest la vie :-)
) but as a warning. Those who use asymptote on daily basis should
either maintain the "other" copy of it (as I do, updating it via svn)
or not to update it unless in

update --list or update --dry-run

asymptote comes with a binary.



BTW, it would be useful for this if tlmgr update  understood no only
<packagename> and --all but also "except <packagename>"

Fortunately TeXLive Utility on MacOSX (GUI interface for tlmgr) can
update "selected packages"

Thank you, Robin.  And, to be fair, my criticisms are meant
to be /constructive/ criticisms : I do not criticise for the sake
of it, but because I genuinely want Windows users to be
able to use TeX Live with the same ease as Eunuchs/Lunix/
<whatever> users.

100% agreed. I might add, users don't need to be happy that it works on windows
at all: we claim it does, and it does, period.

However, we don't claim (AFAIK) that it looks and feels native. Eg, forward
slashes feel wrong to most windows users, but actually work.

IMO, it would be good to have TL feel as native as possible on windows, but the
priority is to make it work, and as Reinhard recalled, it's sometimes difficult.

OK, let's stop there before this thread spirals out of control (if it
is not too late for that already).

Windows users are treated no better and no worse than users of any
other platform.  Indeed, it is a pain to support win32, but simply
because it is not *nix based as all other platforms we support and not
because it is broken by design.  I expect it would be equally painful
(or more) to support something like BeOS or AmigaOS.  We go through
that pain for Windows, because we think it's worth it. The forward vs.
backward slashes issue is just a minor, unimportant detail here, so
let's not blow it out of proportion and start a holy OS war here,
shall we?

Respectfully,

Tomek

Robin, I know and what I wrote was never intended as a serious
argument but a a joke. Definitely Windows needs to be supported
despite being a Certified Royal Pain. Philip as a webmaster should
know what a Royal Pain is MSIE (...,6,7,8) support.


Philip's remarks are not unfounded and many go beyond windows (f.e.
incomplete URLs on mirman were a stumbling block for majority of users
if not everyone on the first run of the installer or updater,  I
believe that majority guessed a correct URL on the second or third
run, but some people could not).

However there is a bit more serious argument:

in pretest mode the number beyond platform does not really matter: if
Windows had 1000 times more users than some other platform, it does
not need 1000 times more testers (well it needs more testers because
there are at least 3 or 4 different popular windows platforms)

BTW MacOSX has an OSX version and arch variations.

I agree that it's minor, but I don't agree that it is unimportant.
Being able to take a string from a dialogue box and paste it
into Explorer / CMD / <whatever> is important, as is the simple
fact that Windows users /expect/ their path slashes to be
backslashes.  Suppose I were to embed a "URL" such as the
following  in this message :

	http:\\www.tug.org\texlive\

What possible use would that be to anybody ?  Yes, you can
see what is meant, but you can't do anything useful with it :
just the same for

	E:/TeX/Live/Common/TeXMF/Var

from the TL installer under Windows.

Dear Phil,

I would expect that a typical user will want to copy a path from
explorer (or other palce) to the installer, not the other way around,
and this works just fine with backslashes.  Also, using "slashed"
paths in explorer (and throughout the Windows API) works just fine for
me, contrary to what you say.  Have you actually tried and found
otherwise?  So, I don't find your arguments fully convincing/accurate.

I agree that slashes are against expectations of windows users, but
there are other issues/features that I deem of higher priority and
would like us to focus on first.  (And for the record, I'm a Windows
user myself and care a lot about how TL works on that platform.)

Cheers,

Tomek

Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa : forward slashes /do/
work in Explorer as Tomek says, provided that one enters them
after Explorer has been launched (e.g., by pasting into the "Address"
field).  I can only think that when testing, I tried

	Start /Run Explorer <forward-slash-delimited path>

and this does indeed not work.  However, in the main, Tomek is
correct, I am wrong and I gratefully stand corrected.  Of course
Windows users still expect to see backslashes, and would prefer
not to see them re-written as forward slashes, but that is a far
weaker case than my original claim.

Now where did I put those nettles ??? !

I'm far from a windows expert, but I think the only place where forward slashes
may cause any harm on windows is in command line arguments to programs that
expect slashes only at the start of options.

Precisely. To me it looks more like a look & feel issue than a real usability
issue. As Tomek said, we have higher priority issues atm. However, I gave this
one a try, and I think I got a less surprising version of the perltk and wizard
interfaces for windows users. It converts all path to use backslashes (on
windows, obviously) before displaying them, regardless of what kind of slashes
the user actually typed.

You can try it, either by waiting for tonight's updates to tlpretest, or by
downloading the files

http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/install-menu-text.pl
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/installer/install-wizard-text.pl

and putting them in the tlpkg\installer subdir of either your (extracted)
installer package or your full copy of tlpretest, then running
install-tl(-advanced).bat as usual.

Manuel.

It does. It is opposed to the case of mirroring the full tlpretest repo. I tried

I agree that the behaviour is not very intuitive (someone should probably ask
mirmon authors about it). I'm not sure how to explain it better. Do you want to
propose a better wording?

Message-ID: <4C31DFCF.2000802@elzevir.fr>

Hi all,

I just noticed lshort fails to compile with TL'2010 (running live from svn).
The error seems to happen during thumbpdf's run (which is surprising, because
according to its banner it has not been update since TL09).

How to reproduce:
- grab the sources from
http://mirror.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort-4.31.src.tar.gz
- untar-gz them and cd to the created dir
- run "make lshort.pdf"

Sorry for not producing a minimal example: I'll probably try later, but for now
I just wanted to make sure not to forget.

OK, herewith explicit suggestions, and a proposed revised
version is at :

	http://web-consultants.org.uk/sites/TUG/pretest.html

1) The prose reads "To do a network installation" in one place
    and "In the case of the installer package" in another.  These
    refer to the same operation, and should therefore use the
    same terminology : the latter therefore amended to read
    "If performing a network installation".  Unfortunately
    the document needs to fork earlier, so see online version
    for full changes.

2) "The exact http://somehost/some/path urls to use are link
     targets on the texlive-pretest mirmon page."

     Yes, they are, but that is hardly user-friendly documentation.
     Proposed : "To find a real value for <em>location</em>, identify
     a suitable (topologically  near) host from the texlive-pretest
     mirmon page, then right-click on your chosen host and choose
    "copy link location" or your browser's equivalent.  You can then
     paste this value in following the "-repository " parameter.  Ignore
     the "@" signs in the texlive-pretest mirmon page : they are simply
     there to confuse.

3)  Is there an "Install-TL-advanced" for Unix/Linux ?  If so, option (3)
     of "Installing" should use this.  If not, then the document needs to
     fork even earlier.

Various other changes made, and the final document contains both
QUERIES (in red) and COMMENTS (in blue).  Getting the final part
to validate (the form and surrounding <small> stuff) was a real b1tch.

but it has filesize 1.5 MB vs 2.6 MB of the one in doc and while visibly

If I go to lshort-4.3.1/src and run pdflatex lshort and makeidex pdfshort  
etc it produces 1.5 MB file but with visible thumbs/pages; however it is  
shorter, 167 pp out of 168 and probably has slightly different page setup

I used something along these lines, but tried to make it shorter, and moved it
earlier on the page (in the "downloading" section).

No, the only purpose of install-tl-advance.bat is to allow Windows user to
double-click it, so that they don't need to use this horribly frightening
Unixish tool name a command line (just kidding, not wanting to start yet another
OS troll) in order to specify -gui perltk to get the fully configurable version
of the installer.

Since, in pretest phase, even windows users are not supposed to be afraid by a
command line (since they often need it for the -repository option, and a
courageous people anyway---they wouldn't be pretesting otherwise), there's
little point in mentioning install-tl-advanced.bat on the pretest page IMO.

> Various other changes made, and the final document contains both

I made adjustements to make some of theses points clearer (hopefully) and
uploaded the resulting document. I don't intend to spend more time on tweaking
this page, sorry: as previously mentioned, this is only a temporary and very
specific documentation page.

I didn't look at your comments about the "notable changes" section yet, but if
something should be fixed there, it's probably better to fix it in the actual
TL2010 documentation. But I'll wait for Karl opinion before touching this
document, since I don't want to negatively interfere with the ongoing
translation process.

If you don't mention it, how can you expect it to get tested ?

Personally I would recommend we overwrite Install-TL.bat with
Install-TL-Advanced.bat and recommend only the former; I cannot
any see any benefit in hiding important options from even complete
beginners at TL installation.

The batch script itself doesn't need to be tested, it is a trivial wrapper
around install-tl. We need the interface to be tested, which is achieved by
install-tl -gui perltk.

It's a common fact in UI design than presenting too many options to a user who
possibly don't understand them can be very confusing. (And here I'm not kidding.)

Anyway, beside yours, we didn't have many complaints (on the contrary) about the
wizard installer being the default one since last year, so we don't plan to
change that.

OK, I don't want to waste much more time on this point,
so just one question : what fraction of Windows pre-testers
do you believe are testing the non-advanced version ?

I for one am not, because I cannot know in advance
what it will do to my system : hence I will /only/
test the advanced one, to be sure I can configure
things not to conflict with production work.

My first thought was that it has something to do with ghostscript, but
it also fails with much older versions (8.15, for example).

I also created a format file with \pdfminorversion=4 because this was
changed recently, but it still fails.

It works under TL-2009.

Hi,

While doing a backup, I accidentaly removed executable bit from whole TeXLive folder recursively, which naturally means none of the programs (latex, pdflatex, xelatex...) don't work. My question is: is it safe and enough to select all files in TeXLive2009/bin/x86_64-linux folder and make them all executable?

I'm using Debian Testing, 64bit, locally installed TeXLive.

Well, I have installed TL2010 three time. The first on WinXP Pro
with install-tl-advanced, then on WinXP Media edition with wizard
mode, and finally on Windows 7 (it was _not_ my idea) by simply
copying the TeXLive directory from the first install.

So, if I am in any way typical, the answer is one third :)

I might add that I believe I am at least in one sense a typical
pretester: I have used TL2009 (and previous) extensively and have
played around with tlmgr and its options a lot (mostly command-line
mode), and was therefore quite unsurprised at the forward slashes
and not particularly confused by the descriiption of the location
parameter or by mirmon.

As to mirmon, I did what I always do with an obvious link: moused over
it to make sure it seemed legitimate and then went there. In fact, this
how I downloaded install-tl.zip. It was therefore obvious what URL to
use.

Also: all three installations are working without a hitch and updates
run without issues (except those already worked out here).

Yes, except xindy.mem as all other files are either executables or
symlinks to executables some of which are in the same directory and
some in
../../texmf-dist/scripts/ and its subdirectories

For those who want to try it on Windows I just put a statically linked 
version of GNU make 3.81 for win32 on my web server:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/w32/GNUmake/make-3.81-w32.zip

You only need this file but according to the GPL I have to provide the
sources too.

  http://ms25.ath.cx/w32/GNUmake/make-3.81.tar.bz2

If you really need the sources, better get them from

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make

The .zip file contains two files, make.exe and make.pdf.  The easiest
way to install them is to put make.exe into texlive/20xx/bin/win32 and
make.pdf somewhere under TEXMFHOME or TEXMFLOCAL where texdoc can find
it.

Sure, the minimal example I provided is so simple that it's sufficient
to type the commands once on the CLI and use the cursor keys in order
to avoid re-typing commands again.

But I fear that nobody would try Manuel's example (lshort) without
make.  Furthermore, make is quite useful in the TeX world, it's
unavoidable if you have to manage large projects.

Regards,
  Reinhard

PS: The phrase "statically linked" means that you don't have to
    install anything else.  Neither MinGW nor Cygwin is required.

It doesn't hurt if the executable flag is set for xindy.mem.  Whether
it's set or not only has an impact on the error message you get when
you try to execute this file.  But this file isn't supposed to be
executed at all.

You can run the TL live sytem from a USB stick even though all files
are executable on a FAT32 file system.

TeX works fine with Windows, this is proved by MikTeX. I think the TL team has to choose whether they actually want to support Windows or not. If they decide to support it, then I think it's not really helpful if team members constantly criticize the OS that they officially pretend to support.
Please continue with the great work on TeX Live and resume those ugly OS discussions on Slashdot or whatever.

Just out of curiosity, why are you using hard-coded path separators then? All programming environments that I know offer some sort of generic path manipulation functions (C++ has Boost.Filesystem, Python has os.path, .NET has System.IO, Java has java.io?) that abstract away such details.

We intend to support Windows as long as this system exists.  You are
obviously a user who hasn't the slightest idea about the problems
developers have to solve.  Supporting Windows is a pain, not because
it's different from Unix, the problem is that nothing works as
advertised.

For example, the C runtime library (MSVCRT.DLL) claims that signals
are supported.  Please run

   ftype | more

and press "q", and see what happens.

  Reinhard

What has criticizing to do with supporting?

Remember we are doing that on volunteer basis, none of us is earning 
one meager cent from that, and now you ask us not to criticize those
stupid shortcomings that creates long lng hours of headache for us?

Please either start contributing code that is portable yourself, or
stop telling us what we should or should not do, thanks.

Doing that we would get even more complains that

creating the wizard was *out*of*that*very*reason* of trying to feel
more native to WIndows users, they expect

So you see, what feels native and not is very subjective.

If I were you I wish I could just stop supporting this stupid platform.
However, whenever I have to use windows I still prefer TeXLive to
MikTex. I don't know why, maybe it's because TL gives the same user
experiance as in its nix counterpart to some degree, which make me
feel at home. So thank you for all the work.

I think that a more accurate casting of that last part
would be "nothing works as we expect it to".

This is what is classically called a "non sequitur" : just because
a Borg-Warner gearbox claims that engine speed sensing is supported
doesn't mean that I should expect my SAAB 9000 engine to never
exceed 5500 rpm.  And just because "signals are supported" doesn't mean
that they are correctly generated when the consumer of a pipe
terminates before the producer, nor does it mean that "ftype"
has been correctly written to handle such signals.  The problem
may originate in any one of many places : it doesn't in any way
demonstrate that the statement "signals are supported" is incorrect.

Just to confirm these assertions, you might like to
try "Assoc | more" and then  type "q"; the signal is
correctly handled and the producer ("Assoc") terminates
cleanly.

Well, imagine you are a windows user, you come to the TL list for help (and/or
to report a bug or request an improvement), and often the reply is "you're on
windows? be happy that it works at all", followed by a rant about a randomly
picked windows gotcha. Won't you feel like a 2nd-class citizen in the TL world?

the final impression of users is that using TL on windows is not really ok.

Anyway, I agree with you that if someone asks us about a particular feature that
we have problems implementing, it is perfectly ok to complain about a particular
problem with windows (like "sorry, but it will be difficult to port this
particular software since there is no <typical-unix-feature> on windows, so
we're afraid it won't happen").

But here the original question was about backslashes vs slashes in paths: a
purely arbitrary convention. Nothing to do with how ftype incorrectly handles
some signals, for example ;-)

Sorry, but I think Philipp (Stephani) is right, those regular rants on the TL
list are counter-productive and give a bad image of our work on windows.

> (asking himself sometimes what people expect and believe)
> 
They expect a clear position: we can't say "be happy that it works at all on
windows" and "we fully support windows since the 90's" in the same thread, this
is inconsistent. Since we support windows, people don't need to be "happy" that
things work (at least, no more happy that they are on unix): we claim it works,
so it works, period.

Be realitstic, that is not the case. We often get questions from W32 users,
and we keep answering them in most cases in the normal way. It is simply
not true that we do the
	"be happy and shut up"
response as default to W32 users.

Philip got his share because we know him well and he is a proud W32
users enjoying bashing other systems as much as we enjoy bashing W32,
aren't you Philip? I don't consider Philip a "normal" user in this respect,
more like a good tester with a very picky taste :-D

Enjoy

Well, we cannot change reality, W32 *is* a pain to support. Period.

Why? Sorry as a logician I don't see any inconsistency here.

Still one can be happy *that* it works even though there are a lot
of hurdes to master for W32.

Anyway, I guess the bottom line of all that is:
	THANK THANKS Tomek for you wonderful work on W32.

  Hi,

as maintainer of TL on Arch Linux I have been communicated the following bug report:
http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/20065?dev=1047
which is identical to http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501520

This is a problem with the CTAN package "flashcards", which seems no longer to be 
maintained. I do not want to patch anything coming from CTAN, and am considering removing 
flashcards from texlive-latexextra. Of course the better solution would be to have someone 
take over its maintainance on CTAN :)

Opinions?

Sure it isn't the default response, but IMO it shouldn't be a response at all.

Right, I don't have anything about joking on each other system of choice, but
IMO again, such jokes are better done privately or in some other place that the
TL list, if we want to avoid developing the wrong impression that windows is not
as supported as unix (and try to avoid lengthy off-topic and sometimes heated
discussions).

Since we support windows, it is just normal that things works, it's not a
surprise. People may be happy that we support windows. But once they know it,
they don't need to be happy every time a particular thing works. Are you happy
every time you run "ls" and it works? ;-) (Well, perhaps I should, I'd be happy
(almost) all the time...)

On a more general note, supporting windows is our choice, (and on an even more
general note, developing free software is our choice), I don't see any need to
constantly tell people how hard it is and that they should be happy about it.

Thanks for thanks :) but I think the rest of the team is equally
committed to supporting w32 (as any other platform), despite the
occasional grumpiness.  But let's not prolong this discussion and
better focus on whipping up some code :)

Cheers,

Hi Phil,

What do you mean it doesn't correctly set path in presence of TL'09?
It prepends (rather than appends) TL'10 bindir to path, because
otherwise TL'09 would be still used. AFAICS, it works as intended.

BTW, you have TL'09 on system and user path in the registry.  This is
abnormal, probably one of test installations didn't uninstall cleanly.

Cheers,

Tomek

I am at a complete loss.  This morning, in rseponse to the enquiry
from anas.ghrab at saramusik.org, I saved and opened his attachment
(attached) and launched XeLaTeX from WinEDT's command prompt.
I was told I was running the TL'09 version of XeTeX.  I have just
repeated this, and now I am told I am running the TL'10 version.
I have no explanation.  My sincere apologies for the noise.

Perhaps you needed to re-login (or at least re-start WinEDT) for the new PATH to
take effect?

Wrong guy: the above message is not by the author of flashcards, but rather by the blog 
author who wrote about flashcards 5 years ago and mentioned its incompatibility with 
geometry, proposing a patch to circumvent it.

BTW it was not me, but the Debian people who tried to reach the original author of 
flashcards: see the Debian bug report.

The source of this file doesn't seem to be available. Usually, we include a
README.texlive file stating which files were removed as well as the possible
reasons. I'll add one for this package.

Of course, if anyone wants to contact the authors and convince them to provide
the sources, we'll happily include the document again.

I think so. I seem to remember the installer does the adequate incantations so

No. This point always surprises me, but the system path takes precedence.

It has a practical consequence : if you installed TL2009 system-wide, and
install TL2010 only for your user, then TL2009 will continue to be used, and
afaik there's nothing we can do about it. Hopefully this case will be rare.

Many systems will have TL2009 previously installed and a user wants to
try TL2010.
For machines with more than one user, this likely means TL2009 is installed
"system-wide" while TL2010 is installed by and for one user.

Perhaps the installer should try to detect such cases and issue a warning, but
it is the little surprises that keep life interesting.

Well, my (possibly wrong) vision is that one of two scenarios are most probable:
- essentially single-user machine, so the user-admin will probably install
system-wide TL2010 too
- multi-user machine, like in a university network, where the user is hopefully
unlikely to ever want to install something like TL on his account.

But of course those are not the only possible scenarios.

It seems to me the installer is already doing that. From Phil's original message:

Yes, that is precisely the case.  Changes take effect immediately, but
environment of already running programs cannot be changed anymore, so
you have to restart them (and do it form the explorer or shortcut, so
they get a fresh environment and not the one form the parent process).

Yes, this is exactly one of those pain points about Windows.
Unfixable I'm afraid.

Windows doesn't allow for user path to take precedence over the system
path, as Manuel already noted.  There is nothing we do about this one.

And it will further tell that it can't fix this for you if run in
single user installation mode.

But this message is concealed in a 11930-line file; should not
warnings and errors be additionally displayed as the final
step in the console window (and perhaps a flashing red icon
appear in the GUI warning the user of this, and allowing
a GUI way of seeing warnings and errors) ?

It would be useful to see a small table summarizing the number
of various types of errors/warnings at the end of the run with
some indication importance.

I assume that you are talking about the log file.  I don't have a log
file containing any error or warning messages.  Do you think it's
sufficient to display all lines beginning with "Error:" or "Warning:"
at the end?

Parsing the log file has some drawbacks.  If a message contains line
breaks, for instance, we only get the first line.  But the advantage
of this approach is that we don't have to modify the installer itself.
Parsing the log file can even be done by a separate program.

And even if a multi-line message is truncated, I think that it's
helpful to provide the line number of its occurrence in the log file.

I can imagine better solutions but I don't think it's a good idea to
add new features to the installer itself a few days before it's carved
in stone.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, so long as we detect that there are one or more such lines
and then precede them with a bold alert : SEE BELOW -- SOME ERRORS
OR WARNINGS WERE ENCOUNTERED.

There are hooks in TLUtils::tlwarn sub that could be used to, say,
gather all warning messages in a global array and then, if this array
is not empty at the end of installation, spit them out in a message
box or something.  Would anyone be willing to look into that? (asking
in hope to outsource the idea :)

This should be of interest to perl coders outside the TeX community.
The SLATEC xerror package for Fortran is one example that might
be a useful example for someone looking to provide a similar capability
for Perl: <http://www.netlib.org/slatec/index.html>

No need, a short test file for pdfTeX:

\nopagenumbers
Hello World
\bye

TL2010 uses
  \pdfminorversion=5
  \pdfobjcompresslevel=2

Then important objects for the perl script thumbpdf are hidden,
because compressed. In short, thumbpdf doesn't support compressed
objects. Thus either use \pdfobjcompresslevel=0 or don't use
thumbpdf. I don't have plans to extend thumbpdf, because supporting
compressed objects would require a complete rewrite of thumbpdf using
a PDF library. And I doubt the usefulness of thumbpdf nowadays, when
AR versions generate thumbnails on the fly very fast.

Yours sincerely

Could "thumbpdf" itself perhaps specify "\pdfobjcompresslevel = 0\relax" ?

Because thumbpdf uses the plain format
(with default setting \pdfminorversion=5, \pdfobjcompresslevel=2).

Update of thumbpdf 3.11 is on its way, its sets
\pdfobjcompresslevel=0 and \pdfminorversion=4 for its intermediate
pdf file.

Thanks for the bug report.

A more elegant solution might be to ask Thanh to consider
implementing "\pdfmaxobjcompresslevel", an integer variable
with side-effect : an assignment thereto would automatically
be compared with the current value (default: \maxdimen), and
if the new proposed value were less than the current value,
the current value would be updated.  This would allow quasi-
competing packages to each specify the maximum compress
level with which they can cope, and the lowest common
denominator would then be selected.

There are two PDF files that needs parsing by thumbpdf:
* the original PDF file to get the MediaBox.
* an internal PDF file with the thumbnail data.

The second case is fixed in version thumbpdf 3.11.
The first case can't (at least, thumbpdf.sty generates a warning),
but this case is less problematic, because thumbpdf uses a default
resolution in case of an unknown MediaBox.

I think, this is the job of the format kernel, at least of a
package to manage the additional resources of pdfTeX
(\pdfminorversion, \pdfcompresslevel, \pdfobjcompresslevel,
\pdfpageresources, ...)

Otherwise we would end up with \pdfmaxminorversion,
\pdfminminorversion, ...

A quite convenient way to get the MediaBox is to use pdfinfo, which
already supports object stream compression.  TL provides binaries for
all supported platforms and I suppose that MikTeX provides it too.

You could check whether pdfinfo is in PATH and fall back to the default
resolution otherwise.

Unhappily it doesn't support pages with different MediaBox settings.

Message-ID: <201007072342.o67Ng53L009747@f7.net>

FYI ... my general idea of the tl release schedule at this point:

- program (build) updates are now frozen (aside from some final
  portability tweaks) unless a critical bug emerges.
  
- I plan to freeze package updates around July 15.

- Build candidate images for a few days, only fixing critical bugs and
  final doc tweaks.

- Deliver final release image to DANTE by July 22 for Manfred to start
  building the full TeX Collection DVD.  That is always a lengthy
  process with lots of qa, and then production itself takes time, so the
  best guess at this point is that DVD's will begin appear in member
  mailboxes "sometime in September".  We'll see.

Hi Francois,

      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501520

    I do not want to patch anything coming from CTAN, 

Well, how about uploading a new flashcards.dtx to CTAN?  That does not
imply "taking over maintenance", which everyone seems to be so scared
of.  If someone had done that instead of messing around with bug
databases this could have been fixed long ago.

The diff on http://www.feferraz.net/en/P/Flashcards_in_LaTeX appears to
be trivial.  (Too bad about the backward-incompatible geometry.)

I'll do it if no one else does, but I do have a few other things to get
to first :).

fwiw, luatex allows to parse PDF natively (using xpdf functions via a
Lua binding).

No, I have no such expectation.  Nor I do expect to make the release

Undocumented? At least I couldn't find this in the manual
of LuaTeX 0.60.2.

And when netinstall is expected to become a release?

Another question: there were hopes that TL2009 could be updated to
TL2010; it will not happen?

it's in trunk only. Terse documentation see "epdf library" (needs fresh
manual generation).

Ahhh... really pity. For me those packages are the pearls! And all macros
are signed LPPL anyway. We have so many packages without doc sources (like 
fonts or context), so I still cannot understand why we have such 
restrictions. I dare swear that for open source packages
we use too much restrictions, or, hmmm... how to say, political
(american :) correctness. All in all:
- the program, macro, font IS open source;
- why we cannot give freedom to the developers to add (also freely
   distributable and readable) the documentation, which is not real,
   workable part of the package itself?

Just the case, as Don Story kindly explained.

Oh, Staszek, must we go through this yet again?  

There are gray areas, but complete lack of doc source is not one of
them.  Fundamentally, the point is that free documentation is as
important as free software.  We made the decision long ago that TL would
follow such guidelines -- no question that's not the only possible
decision, but it is the one we made.

And it has nothing to do with political and/or American correctness.

I would happily distribute acrotex with tex-live, but for the restrictions
on the documentation; of course, I could simply pdflatex the dtx file, but I
usually only include minimal descriptions for my own purposes, and to remind
myself of any reasoning that I was using at the time. Typically, I have a
separate manual that is more reader friendly.

I must confess I am confused. Even if it cannot be compiled due to proprietary fonts (which is also the case with the fontspec manual, also for biblatex, etc.) what is wrong with including the source file for your manual?

It's not a pity.  It bothered me all the time that Story can't accept
standard licenses like GPL or LPPL.  

And refusing to publish the doc sources is silly, isn't it?

I'm happy that his stuff is removed from TeX Live now.

  Reinhard

Subject: [tex-live] Update failure
Message-ID: <6FDB4682-F9DA-4B90-9EDE-E758F5F9DD0A@mac.com>

I just tried to update two systems: one Mac OS X, 10.5.8; and the other Mac OS X, 10.6.4.  The update on the 10.5 system completed, and the results seem to be functional.

The update on the 10.6 system failed.  The tail of the log file (appended below) shows something involving luatex failed:

      fmtutil-sys --no-error-if-no-format --byengine luatex failed (status 1), output:
      fmtutil: fmtutil: unknown option `--no-error-if-no-format'. Try fmtutil --help for help.

Full log is available if needed.

With this failure, TLU/tlmgr seems to think that its job is done (no updates available).  The URL for this update is
       <http://ftp.math.utah.edu:80/pub//texlive/tlpretest>

How does one recover from this?

Thanks,

Justin

I'm too one of the people who doesn't publish sources of their
documentations. Partly because they too use personal macros and
fonts and so wouldn't compile anyway. But more importantly because
the sources do contain a lot of personal remarks, comments and names
of people. 

I accept that the TeXLive team doesn't include my documentation and
I will not ridicule or sneer at it in any way: TeXLive is _your_
package and you decide about the content. But I would really like it
if members of the TeXLive team would in return not ridicule or sneer
at the decisision I and Don made about their packages and their
content. 

> I'm happy that his stuff is removed from TeX Live now.

If it makes you happy you can naturally also remove my packages. It
was the decision of the TeXLive team to include them and it's up to
the team to decide if when and how to remove them. I don't mind. I
put the stuff on CTAN without restrictions and everyone is free to
use or not to use it.

I did not really want to reply to this thread (I guess everybody knows
by now that I agree with Staszek and Phil on this) but I do want to
point out that as of this year (TL2010), there is 372 page long manual
for context under texmf-dist/doc/context/manuals/reference.

Hello,

Take a look on e.g. binaries' dependencies list of xindy package in GUI

note that it was don's request that his packages be removed.  the common
case is no more than: if the documentation source is not available, the
documentation doesn't make it to ctan.

if you don't want your packages included under those terms, it's _your_
decision to say so -- imo, a "dark hint" like the above should _not_ be
sufficient for removing packages from tex live.

personally, i value your many inputs, and would feel sorry if any part
of them were unnecessarily blocked or removed.

I would like to continue this thread in a constructive
manner (i.e., please do not interpret what follows as
intentionally provocative : it is genuinely a request
for information), so could the TeX Live team please
tell us :

1) Where is the source document for "doc.html",
    in the root of the TeX Live 2010 hierachy ?

2) What would you define as the "source" for the
    attached file [1] ?  In my opinion, the "source"
    is an evanescent sequence of keystrokes, since
    there is no physical copy other than the PDF.

It may have been Don's request, but it doesn't look to me
as if it arose spontaneously : it would appear to me to be
more a response to your (RF's) own suggestion "if you would
rather that the package(s) are not in tex live [no doubt
others of your packages are in the same state], perhaps a message to
tex-live at tug.org would be in order, to explain the situation."

Oh, please Phil, don't make it harder than it is.  The source is not
some mythical animal no one has ever seen.  If you use OOWriter to
produce the PDF, then the .odt file is the source.  If you would
hand-craft that PDF, then the PDF is the source.  I don't think there
is any ambiguity here (at least I don't see it).

Speaking for myself, but with my TL hat on, it doesn't make me happy
at all that we have to remove any packages.  I would much prefer that
some solution is found that is acceptable to both sides: the authors
and us, but failing that we have no choice but to follow the
guidelines we adopted or we are just a bunch of hypocrites.  If the
package author(s) decide to withdraw their work entirely because of
that, then we have no choice but to respect these wishes.

It makes me even less happy that such a discussion (and in this tone)
is taking place on this list.  Licensing and polices are hairy
subjects, but let's not make this debate more heated than it has to be
and let's keep it in mutually respectful tone.  (Personally, I prefer
to focus on technical matters rather than politics, so I will likely
stay away from this thread from now on.)

Cheers,

Tomek

Yes, if you are happy to accept that a PDF is also
the source itself.  Why should one format be acceptable
as source when the other is not ?

I'm not trying to "make it harder than it is" : I'm trying
to point out that the "source" for a document is an
extraordinarily hard thing to define, and that we must
therefore be flexible in terms of our requirements rather
than rigid as at present.  There /is/ no .odt file for
the PDF which I circulated, nor has there ever been,
nor will there ever be : it is clearly possible to go
from an evanescent sequence of keystrokes to a final
PDF file without there ever being a physical instantiation
of a corresponding source document.

Don Story and Ulrike Fisher's work is clearly of interest
and benefit to the TeX community : if they prefer to
offer only a final PDF rather than their own personal
sources for that PDF, then that should (IMHO) be more
than sufficient to allow the inclusion of their work
in TeX Live.

With respect, there /is/ another choice : re-visit the guidelines
that have been adopted and consider whether they are in the best
interests of the TeX Community.  Surely this last criterion is
the one that should govern such considerations, not (as Staszek
has suggested) "political (american :-) ) correctness".

I agree with you. Again, this was Reinhard's opinion, not the official position
of TeX Live.

(More generally, I think it would be good if members of the team could avoid
offensive messages here, be it about author's choices or user's OSes, ...)

Well, our rules are quite clear: we value free documentation as much as free
software, but lack of documentation sources is in no way a reason to remove a
package from TeX Live (as far as the code itself is free): only the incriminated
file is removed. Nobody wants your packages removed from TeX Live.

Without mixing into the core of discussion. What is the source of
hyphenation patterns? I think that we could remove 80% of hyphenation
patterns - hardly any patterns contain the source from which they have
been generated.

i didn't bother to look at your "evanescent" pdf file, but i would claim
that if it was as substantial as one of don's or ulrike's documents, and
_didn't_ have a source so that it could be regenerated after bugs were
discovered, then it would hardly be worth maintaining on ctan, let alone
tl.

we're not talking about trivia here.  nor about readme files.

there's no problem with including their work, just so long as there's
source.  if they choose not to provide the source of the documentation,
then the package will make it to tl without the documentation.  the
documentation is still available to people with net access: this is less
than totally satisfactory, but it's not impossible.

i think that only _one_ member of this list has proposed removing all
such packages from tl.  it would be a pity if tl were to go down that
route, imo, and i don't believe it's likely to happen.

don story decided (without any prompting) to remove one package from tl
because its documentation wouldn't be included (this was in a discussion
with the ctan list).  i agree i made a mistake, at that point, by
pointing out that all his packages were in this state.

May I suggest that if documentation does not satisfy the criteria it
should be replaced by a short notice:

"Complete manual could be downloaded from http://.....".

The fact that you didn't choose to save your source format, doesn't
mean it didn't exist.

Following your argument I could distribute binaries without sources
and claim that I typed them on the console and piped through the
compiler.  Surely you see, how ridiculous this gets.

Cheers,

Tomek

Surely this is another possible choice, but I see no reason to re-visit the
guidelines each time they get public exposition.

I'd like to avoid a big debate here and now about it, but here is my opinion
(and to be clear: my a opinion as *a* member of the team, not the official
position of the whole team):
- if you understand why it is important for software to be free, I guess you can
understand why it is important to us for documentation to be free, too.
- freedom of the software and its documentation is not a matter of political
correctness, it is also in the interest of the "TeX community" as you call it,
so I think we are serving it by insisting on free documentation. (Though I agree
that this position has drawbacks too, obviously.)

Manuel.

But it wasn't the /source/, Tomek, simply an alternative
representation of the same underlying in-memory data
structures as were used to generate the PDF.  To put it
simply, the PDF was not generated from the ODT : both
were generated from the same sequence of keystrokes
using the menu interface of Open Office.

Yes, we agree : it /is/ ridiculous.  That is the whole point !

For the record, we are already putting a notice like:

The following files have been removed from the current package
due to licensing conditions or missing source code. Please find
these files on the CTAN!
	<list-of-files>

So, your suggestion is basically that we add the url of the package on CTAN in
the notice, right? If so, it looks like a good idea to me (even if it only saves
the user a few seconds, it may look friendlier).

Manuel.

(1) I (personally) don't believe that it is important for
software to be free; if I did, I couldn't use Microsoft
Windows with a clear conscience.

(2) Even if I did believe that it is important for software
to be free, I cannot see how that would lead me to believe
that documentation must also be free.  In fact, quite the
reverse -- I would believe that the software must be
accompanied by adequate documentation in a platform-neutral
format, but how that documentation was generated would
be of absolutely no concern.

I would be more inclined to ascribe value to this statement
if it were backed up by evidence.

Well, at least in your final statement we reach agreement :-)

I'm sorry, and please don't take it as a personal attack (it isn't meant to be
one), but I think you are :-)

Let me explain: neither Don nor Ulrike claimed there is no source to their
documents. It is clear to everyone here what the source to their document is,
and that it is not published. So, discussing in full generality what a source
is, is completely besides the point. And since such topics are bound spawn a hot
discussion, it is sort of "making it harder than it needs to be".

> I'm trying to point out that

For the record, not that much. A possible definition is "the preferred form for
editing by the author".

Sure.

We (our policy) disagrees.

A short argument: if for some reason they disappear from the TeX community at
some point and become unreachable (which I obviously don't wish, but experience
proves such things happen), it will be very hard to take over maintenance of
their packages, since the documentation will have to be rewritten basically from
scratch.

But I'd like to avoid going through the whole standard list of arguments for
free software advocacy... So, let me just repeat what I said in another message:
if you understand why we value free software, then you may understand why we
value free documentation.

  Good point, Mojca.  For the vast majority of the languages of Western
Europe, the patterns have been generated from word lists with patgen,
and we have none of these word lists in TeX Live.  In some case they
were even proprietary (I think this was the case for Slovenian ;-)

No, we don't agree.  You are trying to justify distribution of any
digital work without the source -- one can always claim that a
magnetic needle and a steady hand were enough to create them.  This
*IS* ridiculous.  Please, stop.

It is certainly true for British English.  Dominik Wujastyk negotiated
the original licence with O.U.P., who granted the right to distribute
the resulting patterns but /not/ the sources from which they were
derived.

I have stopped.  It is clear that there are two diametrically
opposed points of view, and (sadly) little likelihood of
finding a mutually agreeable solution, although it will
be interesting to learn if Don Story is willing to have
his work re-instated with a link such as Victor & Manuel
propose (I personally hope very much that he is).

Just to be clear, the term "incriminated" didn't mean to be offensive, I just
mean "the file without source". (As a reply to a private remark that the term

Here I disagree: first, content of documentation should not be
recreated. For some packages it would be a matter of retyping. DPStory
is a completely different story but not because of proprietary fonts
(fonts could be replaced) but because recreation of astonishing
effects would require very significant efforts. But even in this case
it would be less than "from the scratch". Finally, a lazy/time pressed
 maintainer can use the original documentation + addendum

Well, maybe "basically from scratch" was a bit too strong, but surely you'll
agree that it is much less convenient than editing the source?

Manuel.

PS: as a matter of personal experience, I lost files a few month ago, and had
only a paper copy left from a 40-pages document. I really felt like the source
is an important thing at this point :-)

I do not see a great problem if some particular package is not
included into TL as long as this package is maintained on CTAN in the
standard form AND in tds. The good question is "if documentation comes
without source, should be it on CTAN?". If I am not mistaken on of the
answers is "NO" and this I find problematic as we are sure that CTAN
will exist forever (at least long enough) but we cannot be that sure
about acrotex.net.

Yes, no disagreement here albeit the degree of inconvenience varies
wildly depending on the nature of the document

LOL: you think you had a problem? I also had lost the source (almost
hundred of pages). Some of my colleagues had a lot of papers from
pre-computer times and they retyped hundreds of pages. Actually, as
experience shows OCR helps even for mathematical texts: formulae do
not go through but the text is OK (depending how well s/w can find the
border between text and formula). So, formulae were retyped but it
saved some time.

PS I never did it for my old papers: just scanned, converted to djvu
and OCRed all my old papers.

really rather few packages are available in tds-based forms, other than
through tex live or miktex.  (in particular, none of don story's are
likely to be: he uses y&y tex, whose author set his face against
organising files *long* ago -- long before the company y&y closed its
doors.)

it's not clear to me what you're saying here.  ctan certainly holds
documents whose source is not available.  when we notice the problem, we
tend to alert the author to the consequences, which is how this whole
starburst of complaint and counter-complaint started.

this assumes that the present maintainers of ctan can be replaced when
they retire, or that they can afford to keep the work up when they
retire.  the latter point is likely to be difficult for me (i'm not far
from retiring).

acrotex.net has survived don retiring.  i presume he gains income
through it (sensible man): i would gain no income from continuing ctan
work.

in short, don't assume anything.

Good to know. I'm now making more systematic backups than before, but in case it
happens again, I'll think OCR (for some reason, the thought didn't occur to me
previously).

My remark was meant as a dark hint. I only wanted to point out that
members of the TeXLive don't have to sit there and hope that all
this evil packages are removed by their authors. They actively added
the packages to TeXLive and so they can actively remove them if this
makes them happy. 

(And I know that Reinhard is not issuing the opinions of the TeXLive
team. Nevertheless he should consider a bit the effects of his
postings on the "image" of the TeXLive team.)

You're right, we could; we just don't want to. Our policy is clear: lack of
source for the documentation is a reason to remove the file without sources, it
has never been a reason to remove the whole package (unless of course it is a
documentation package).

There is no free software without free documentation, and they both must
include the source. It is up to the package authors to decide whether
they want to meet these standards or not. It's all the same as with the
GNU and Debian projects. Period.

But I would like to add that from my point of view we should not make
rants about any author's stand on this license issue because we are also
talking about their free decisions here.

BTW, been there, seen that ...

Let me draw a comparison.

Do any of you guys drive cars? 
Do any of you have the source code to the engine control unit?
Does that stop you driving your cars, or cause you to refuse to buy one?

Perhaps you can start to see why for most of us ordinary users, having a working package with documentation is to be preferred to having no package included because its documentation has no source code. 

Best wishes

Phil, I assume that you think that TeX Live's policy is too
restrictive.  But please keep in mind that this is not only TeX Live's
policy, almost every open source O/S insists on the sources too.  
Most TeX users on Linux are using a TeX Live shipped by the Linux
distro they are using and it would be a pity if Linux distributors
can't ship TL as it is.

Many packages were removed from TL or not included at all due to
license issues or missing sources.  I think it's unfair to make an
exception only because some people like a particular package.

In many cases removal of packages could be prevented by asking the
authors to adapt their licences, in many other cases packages had to
be removed because the authors couldn't be reached anymore.  In this
case the situation is quite clear, it's the authors decision.

Removing packages from TL breaks existing documents, hence it's best
to remove them as soon as possible, i.e. before even more people rely
on them.

Regards,
  Reinhard

no (i don't buy a new one because i can't afford it).  but from what i

rather few people suggest that anything becomes inaccessible (and those
that have, have been urged to moderate their language).  what is
suggested is that some documentation will only be available on-line
rather than from the tex live distribution.

i don't know how the car-control-unit analogy maps that situation.

and the package too, if the author withdraws it.

Finding, and installing, the package and its documentation 
makes things awkward for ordinary users 
- a bit like having to ride a bicycle. 

OK, the analogy has gone too far. But what I was trying to point out was that the argument about having documentation source is an issue of principles, yet most people are prepared to be pragmatic rather than principled when the benefits are high enough. Please note that this is not aimed at anyone in particular, just an observation on human nature. I'm just trying to point out the benefits to the "ordinary user" of being pragmatic. 

Best wishes

This is absolutely correct.  Thanks for mentioning it.  Everything I

OK, let's start with the opening phrase of the second sentence :
"Most TeX users on Linux".  Now I readily admit that I have no
idea what fraction of the total users of TeX Live is represented
by "TeX users on Linux", but I /suspect/ (and it is only a suspicion)
that they don't represent the majority of users of TeX Live.
Rather, I would suggest that the majority of users of TeX Live
are represented by the recently stated view of Professor Martin :
"for most of us ordinary users, having a working package with
documentation is to be preferred to having no package included
because its documentation has no source code", or perhaps even
by my own view "for most of us ordinary users, having a working
package with documentation is to be preferred to having a working
package without documentation because its documentation has no
source code".

So that really leaves us with the question "for whom is TeX Live
intended".  If it is the group you identify (TeX users on Linux,
using a version of TeX Live shipped with their Linux distribution),
then I am sympathetic to your position even if I disagree with
it; but if it is the group on behalf of whom Professor Martin
and I are trying to speak ("the man on the Number 53 Clapham
Common Omnibus"), then the present requirement to provide source
for all documentation is counter-productive and I for one would
urge that it be rescinded.

Actually, it's best not to remove them at all :-)

We're very well aware of that: TeX Live and especially tlmgr wouldn't exist
otherwise...

But again, we're *not* removing packages, only the documentation files without
sources. And grabbing a pdf file from a CTAN mirror is not that difficult (as
opposed to install TeX packages in general).

There are also very pragmatic benefits to free software and free documentation,
it is not only a issue of principles (at least IMO).

This appears to assume that "TeX users on Linux" and "most ordinary 
users" are mutually exclusive. If TL cannot be included in their
distros, "ordinary TeX users on Linux" would miss much more than one or
two packages.

I think the important arguments here are probably not of this
pragmatic sort but it is worth pointing out that the pragmatic case is
not as clear cut as some people might be suggesting. (Indeed, this goes
both ways: the FSF's list of entirely free OSs excludes many (most?) of
the familiar distros on the grounds that they do not meet the criteria
for entirely free software.)

Even on these grounds, the best policy is not clear. It might be, for
example, that "ordinary users" benefit most from free packages with
free documentation and that including documentation which is not free
will reduce the number of available packages of this sort over time.
I'm not saying this is clearly the case but it seems at least possible.
If that's right, which policy would be in the "best interests" of
"ordinary users" (as they are being conceived here) would depend on the
degree to which the longer term benefits resulting from more free
packages with free documentation would outweigh the disadvantages of
having some packages for which documentation was available only online
(and, in extreme cases, some packages which were not available through
TL at all).

As I say, I'm inclined to think there are more fundamental principles
at stake here which matter (even to "ordinary users" who may not think
they matter to them). But I do not think those defending the current
policy need to concede the pragmatic case too readily if they do not
wish to.

I wish they would not include TeX at all. Our Dept server came with
teTeX a couple years ago (Red Hat is extremely conservative) and
despite I maintain there TL (2009 and 2010-pretest at the moment) the
majority of my esteemed colleagues use teTeX. Net-install is soooo
easy

The next update should fix that. This is temporary because first the 
new tlmgr is used that calls fmtutil with --no-error-if-no-format, and 
only later fmtutil is updated supporting this option.

Simply ignore.

Hi everyone,

too many messages on a very funny topic, with loads of misunderstandings.

Maybe the following will clear up some things:

We = TeX Live Team do the following:
- remove or not include packages on the explicit wish of the author
- remove documentation files without source, adding a README file
  which files have been removed
- do *not* remove packages because some documentation file has been removed

So we will not start removing packages just for fun.

Concerning the "source" documentation: source is the preferred form
of modification. And if someone sends me a pdf file and says this
is the preferred form of modifications and in the pdfinfo I see that
it was generated by pdflatex, or OOwriter, or MSOffice, then this is
a lie, period.

This is the way these kinds are handled in Debian, and TeX Live
follows the DFSG with the exception of GFDL with invariant sections.

I think that clearly states our position. Further discussion can be
please done on debian-devel or somewhere else to get explanations of
what DFSG means.

If anyone questions the meaning and importance of free software (and
that includes free documentation) (s)he is free to do so, but we are
free to do what we think is the right way. Period. If you are not 
content with that please start your own TeX distribution.

We already proposed *MANY* times that someone steps forward and creates
a TeX Live Package repository for non-free packages, and probably 
removed documentation. That would be easy to do, there is a detailed
explanation how to do tha tin our docs. So if the need is *SOOOO* big
why didn't anyone step forward?

Again, we are free to choose our guidelines, and they are summed up in
the above paragraph (DFSG with exception for GFDL). If you don't like
it, please make your own distribution. You can use all our scripts, you
can use all our knowledge (that is why we develop free software!), but
you have to do your own work.

Thanks

Norbert

The context minimals team has a provisional plan to do this, but it has
a fairly low priority at the moment: first we have to sort out a number
of internal issues with the context minimals distribution. Hopefully in
some months (before the end of the year) we will have a repository that
contains context/luatex updates and non-DFSG free packages.

Best wishes,
Taco

Norbert,

I agree with everything you said, but with two exceptions.

There are other differences between TL and Debian. For example, we accept
documents using proprietary fonts, while Debian doesn't, AFAIK.

I don't think TL is bound to follow the Debian rules. However, I agree with your
statement in the following sense: if someone wants to discuss free software
definitions in general (such as what is a "source") and their relevance, there
are more appropriate places than the TL list.

How we apply the rules to concrete cases in the TeX workd, OTOH, is IMO
perfectly on-topic here, provided that the discussion doesn't degenerate (too much).

Otherwise, I repeat, I agree with everything you stated.

Manuel.

Briefly : perhaps so.  But for some of us (and here
I speak for myself), this list is the /only/ place
on which we knowingly interact with Free Software
developers, and thus it is natural that this is the
place on which we would raise such vital questions
as "what is the definition of 'source', and how
important is it that a source document should
be convertible to final form using only the
resources of the distribution in which it is
included ?".

The preferred form of modification.

If you need to change the document of your pdf, you will do it in OOwriter,
not unpacking and editing the pdf streams, so it is the OOwriter document.

If you create a graphic with gimp, then the gimp .xcf file is the prefered
form of modification, not the generated .png or .jpg.

It is not *that* complicated, although I have to admit there are borderline
cases.

But NOE (!!!!) of the things that started the discussion here are in any
way borderline cases (like doc file where source is present, but should 
be kept private).

So do we discuss just for the fun of discussing or are you genuinly 
interested.

I will not continue this discussion unless proper new arguments or
questions come up. If you or anyone else has questions that remain
answered please subscribe to debian-legal and post there.

Best wishes

Genuinely interested, because an unenforceable law is
a bad law.  Mojca had already shewn that 80% of the
hyphenation patterns on TeX Live have no corresponding
publically available source, yet I think we would all
agree that they should not be removed.  So if an
exception can be made for hyphenation patterns, why
can it not also be made for documentation ?

Since it's based on Fedora 12 (and a bit of technology from Fedora
13), it's most likely it will ship TL2007.

Perhaps I am missing something but if I needed to edit the hyphenation
patterns for British English, I would suppose that hyph-en-gb.tex would
be the preferred form for editing. I don't see that I would want or
need to go back to the OUP list of words - indeed, I would imagine that
I would want to avoid doing so. This is not to say that there might not
be other reasons for wanting or needing access to that list, but I
would assume that hyph-en-gb.tex would be the relevant source for the
hyphenation patterns in TeX because that would be the preferred format
for editing and modification.

There are some cases in which I am genuinely unsure whether something
counts as part of the source or not, or what, if anything, would count
as the source. But the fact that the concept of 'source' is fuzzy does
not undermine its usefulness or mean that guidelines which employ it
are somehow confused or unenforceable. There are, after all, many, many
such concepts. Can you give a precise definition of 'book' or 'game'?
If we avoided reliance on fuzzy concepts we would have very few
concepts at our disposal. Things get complicated when you are faced
with unclear cases - as in the UK legal case to determine if teacakes
(I think - might be misremembering) should be classified as 'biscuits'
or 'cakes'. In Britain, one of these is subject to VAT while the other
is not. But the fuzziness of the distinction in some borderline cases
did not render the legal distinction unenforceable or unclear in the
vast majority of cases. (Nobody could reasonably defend the claim that
rich tea fingers are cakes or that victoria sandwiches are biscuits.)

No, that's not the source : that's the result of processing
the source through Patgen.

But if it is the preferred form for editing and 'source' is, in this
context, defined to be the preferred form for editing, then it is the
source in the relevant sense. Of course, if it is *not* the preferred
form for editing or if 'source' is defined differently, then it is not.

Wrong sort of 'teacakes'. I think it was about those things you can buy
which involve a round biscuit at the bottom with marshmallow on top,
entirely covered in chocolate (and maybe there's jam inside, too?). You
can see how these could plausibly be claimed to be biscuits despite the
name. As I say, it might have been a different product - I don't
remember the details but only the basic cake vx biscuit + vat = dispute!

I think I can say with 99.9% confidence that it is not the
preferred source for editing.

Ah, that sounds more like a Jaffa cake to me, which is
(of course !) not a cake but a biscuit :-)

I'm willing to raise the confidence level by a couple of nines
on that. Editing patgen-generated files to fix hyphenation issues
is next to impossible, you really need the source word lists
(unless you have an full and correctly hyphenated vocabulary of your
language in your head and are able to juggle all the juxtapositions
of all the hyphenation points in them without making errors or omissions).

The problem is that for many (most?) pattern files, the
word lists that were used to generate them are commercial
intellectual property (e.g. of some dictionary publisher).
The fact that this is possible and accepted in any country
is mind-boggling, but nevertheless that is the actual
state of affairs.

I am not going to propose removing patterns without sources, but
it would be really nice if the source word lists for languages that
are indeed 'free' would be included on texlive, as they really are
the sources. The pattern files themselves absolutely are not.
In fact, I'd rather disassemble a binary program than try to
deduce a word list from a pattern file.

Best wishes,
Taco

But Donald Knuth decided that TeX is free.

This was a good decision.  And TeX Live is a TeX distribution.
I think it has to be free too.

Hi Taco,

First of all, I'd like to make clear I have no opinion on what is the source of
a pattern file, so the question below is no an argument in the "source"
discussion, but really pure curiosity.

I'm quite surprised to learn that. I know near to nothing about the process of
building pattern files, but, being French, I already had a look at hyph-fr.tex,
and noticed it is full of comments, and moreover the patterns are divided as
"phonetic" and "etymological". Here is an excerpt:

%-------------------%-----------------------%
% phonetic patterns % etymological patterns %
%-------------------%-----------------------%
%%a
.a4
'a4
.?4
'?4
ab2h % df-bg 1998/02/07 for abhorrer
                    .ab3r?a
                    'ab3r?a
ad2h % df-bg 1998/02/07 for adh?sion & co
                    a1?2dre
                    .ae3s4ch
                    'ae3s4ch
                    1alcool

It really give the impression the pattern list was edited by hand, sometimes
with the intention of fixing hyphenation for a particular word, which looks
quite contradictory to your remark.

Could it be that it depends very much on the language, and that French would be
a particularly regular language wrt hyphenation? Or am I misinterpreting the
presence of the comments?

Thanks in advance for your explanation,
Manuel.

Patterns for Romanic languages, AFAIK, can be manually maintained.
You should rather have a look at languages like German: Adding, say,
hundred compound words changes virtually the complete pattern set.

Looking at a couple of files was really what prompted my earlier
comments. I don't know anything about doing this. The file for Welsh,
for example, doesn't have the sorts of comments you see in the French
file but the commentary at the top seems to assume that people would
edit the file directly. For example:
% This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and resulted from
% semi-manual conversions of hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June
% 2008.
%%
% Source: cyhyph.tex ()
% Author: Yannis Haralambous
%% The above mentioned file should become obsolete, 
% and the author of the original file should preferaby modify this file instead.
etc. etc.

Obviously the same isn't true for all languages - that's what happens
when I peak without finding out properly!

I think it is possible that the person who did the UTF-8 conversion
was simply not au fait with the normal Patgen process, otherwise
I think that he or she would not have spoken about "modifying"
this file but rather "re-generating" this file.  In my experience
(I took over the responsibility for the UK resources at Dominik's request),
generating a "patterns" file is a time-consuming task requiring
multiple runs of Patgen (the latter may even need enlarging for
large word lists), and I for one would not even /consider/ editing
the resulting "patterns" file with the sole exception of the list
of exceptions at the end.  And, for what I hope are obvious
reasons, not even that part should be edited once the patterns
have been distributed and archived.

That file is truly remarkable, and does indeed give every indication
that it has received considerable post-Patgen attention, although it
is by no means clear that the actual /patterns/ therein were
derived empirically rather than through the use of Patgen.

My suspicion is that when a problem was noticed, the word-list was
modified and Patgen re-run, then the two "patterns" file compared
using a "differences" utility and comments added at the point(s) of
difference.  It would certainly be worth contacting those of
the original authors who are still reachable (sadly not Bernard G)
to ask what they know of this process.

Thanks, learned something new: I did not know that romanic languages
were *that* easy ;)

I assume the purity of the language (the extend to which it has been
influenced by other languages, especially languages from different
roots) and whether digraphs and in-word inflections exist also make a
big difference to the complexity of the generated patterns.

Here is an example of the complexities in Dutch: following are some of
the words  starting with 'arm' that were used to create the patterns in
the 'max' pattern list, with a bit of explanation (I deleted most
of the plurals and diminutives):

arm             % 1) body part 2) poverty/poor
ar-ma-da        % 1) fleet of warships
ar-ma-ged-don   % 1) end of the world
ar-mag-nac      % 1) a drink from the Armagnac region
ar-ma-tuur      % 1) armoring 2) (light) fixture/fitting
arm-band        % 1) bracelet (this is a compound)
arm-ban-den     % plural of armband
arm-band-hor-lo-ge  % 1) wristwatch (a double compound)
arm-band-je     % diminutive of armband
arm-band-jes    % plural armbandje
ar-me           % 1) a poor person
ar-mee          % 1) army
ar-men          % multiple of arm
Ar-me-ni-?r     % 1) inhabitant of Armenia
Ar-me-ni-?rs    % multiple of Armeni?r
ar-mer          % 1) poorer than
ar-me-re        % infliction of armer
ar-me-tie-rig   % 1) languishing
ar-me-zon-daars-ge-zicht % poor-sinners-face
arm-las-tig     % 1) the status of being poor
arm-leng-te     % 1) measure of distance (compound)
arm-leu-ning    % 1) arm rest of a chair
arm-pje         % diminutive of arm (as body part)
arms-gat        % 1) sleeve hole
arm-slag        % 1) freedom of movement

'arm' has Germanic roots in both meanings, but they behave quite
differently: the body part nearly always stays whole (except in
the simple plural), wile the poverty case often breaks between
r and m.

'armada' comes from Spanish,
'armageddon' from Hebrew,
'armagnac' from French,
'armatuur' from Latin via French (but with Germanized ending),
'armee' from French (this word is not in normal use anymore),
'band' is Germanic,
'horloge' from French,
'zondaar' and 'gezicht' are Germanic,
'leuning' appears to be a local Dutch invention.

The other word constituents are too hard to explain for me quickly.

'armsgat' is a compound word in principle, but the extra 's'
is a Germanic possessive. The 's' in 'armezondaarsgezicht' is
the same, the 'e' in that case comes from the possessive.

'armetierig' and 'armslag' would not be considered a compound any
more, even though they are based on combinations of roots.

Looking at 'arm' in the middle of a word, there are many words
that have this combination of letters stemming from totally
different roots than 'arm' e.g.:

alarm          % alarm (from French)
baar-moe-der   % womb, compound from 'to bear' + 'mother'
bar-man        % bartender, compound
char-mant      % charming (from French)
daar-mee       % with that
darm           % intestine (unclear)
haar-mid-del   % a product for hair, compound
hand-warm      % luke warm, compound
har-mo-nie     % harmony
jaar-markt     % fair, compound of 'year' and 'market'
kar-mo-zijn    % a colorant (can be traced back to Arabic via Latin)
klaar-ma-ken   % to prepare, compound of 'ready' and 'make'
mar-me-la-de   % marmelade (originally from Portuguese)
mar-mer        % marble (from Latin)
mar-mot        % small rodent (from French)
waar-merk      % verification seal, compound of 'true' and 'mark'
war-moes       % vegetable pulp
warm-te        % heat (Germanic, infliction of 'warm': somewhat hot)
zwaar-moe-dig  % depressed ('zwaar'=heavy,'moede'='tired')

The result: in hyph-nl.tex there are 18 containing 'arm', and no
less than 61 patterns containing 'rm' . I hope it is clear that
you cannot easily alter a line or so in the patterns if you want to
fix the bad hyphenation of word containing the sequence 'arm'.

Best wishes,
Taco

Side note: of course you can 'fix' the patterns by adding a badly
hyphenated word in this way: s8m8o8g9a8l8a8r8m, but I definitely
not call the the 'preferred way'.

Right. Thank you for you very detailed explanations, I learned quite a lot.

Meanwhile, I heard of a very interesting article in the Cahiers Gutenberg (in
French) about French hyphenation patterns and the work done on them in 1994:
comparison of the different set of patterns existing at that time, automated
testing of the patterns over a large database of hyphenated French words, and
manual correction and extension of the pattern list in order to correctly
hyphenate the words in this database).

http://cahiers.gutenberg.eu.org/cg-bin/feuilleter?id=CG_1994___18

Anyway, the conclusion of this sub-thread about whether pattern files are their
own source seems to be: it depends. (Which is probably not that surprising,
after all.)

If TeX was not a free software from start, I doubt it would have been
still relevant after 32 years of its inception, especially after its sole
author deemed it "frozen".

If I was 99.9% certain that hyph-en-gb is not the
preferred source for editing, then I am 99.999999%
certain that members of this list are sick and tired of
hearing my views on the pros and cons of so-called
"free" software.  I therefore thank you sincerely for
the opportunity to comment further, but on this occasion
at least, I shall, with deep regret, decline so to do.

This might be a CTAN question - I'm not sure.

I have produced/am in the process of producing various font-related
support packages for LaTeX. Right now, 4 are on CTAN although one is a
single file.

Two packages currently on CTAN use ts1-euro.etx/.enc and at least one
further package is ready to upload which also uses this file. At the
moment (I just realised) only one of the packages on CTAN actually
includes these files.

It is likely that future versions of these packages (or maybe other
similar packages) will share similar files.  Most are either modified
versions of fontinst files or of files from the Font Installation Guide.
Although some are specific to a particular collection, others might
find themselves being re-used.

ts1-euro, for example, works around a problem I encountered using
fontinst with fonts containing "Euro" rather than "euro". (Basically,
fontinst was faking the Euro symbol even when the font provided it.) It
is not very interesting since it is otherwise identical to fontinst's
ts1.

Question: how should these files be packaged? Should they be included
in all the relevant packages? Should they be packaged separately?
Individually? (The latter would seem far too complex.)

Thanks,
cfr

For the .etx files, yes, but the .enc files are needed at runtime as
far as I understand it.

Not in tex/, but they are in fonts/. So you will end up with multiple
copies/versions to potentially confuse dvips/pdftex etc. Won't that
create problems?

OK. If I can possibly avoid proliferating .etx files, I'd like to as it
will make things easier (in some ways).

What I'd like to do, then, is copy the .enc files with unique names.
But I'm not sure if that's practical.

The .map files will obviously need to be edited.

Suppose a line contains this reference:
 	<ts1-euro.enc
This presumably requires a matching file name so can I simply change it
to:
 	<yyy-ts1-euro.enc
for example?

I'm not sure what the last entry on the .map file lines does:
 	" fontinst-autoenc-ts1-euro ReEncodeFont "
This matches the following line in the encoding file:
 	/fontinst-autoenc-ts1-euro [
Does this need to match the filename? Or can this be left?

Or should I really create unique .etx files to feed fontinst in the
first place?

Sorry for all the questions.

I can see that. The reason I've created the problem is that it
obviously does not create problems on the machine of a single user and
it allowed me to reuse code easily. That was fine for practising in
private...!

Yes, that's what I had in mind (and what other fonts do).

    I'm not sure what the last entry on the .map file lines does:
            " fontinst-autoenc-ts1-euro ReEncodeFont "
    This matches the following line in the encoding file:

    Does this need to match the filename? Or can this be left?

The PostScript name (/fontinst...euro) doesn't *have* to match the
filename (indeed, it doesn't), but it's probably asking for trouble not
to also have it be unique across fonts, in the event that one day the
two definitions are actually different.  I.e., better to add the yyy-
there too.

The problem I envision is this: a year from now, someone points out that
font x now has ts1 character foobar, while font y still does not.  At
that point, ts1 for x is going to want to be different from ts1 for y.
And if the names are not distinct in the first place, compatibility
could suffer.  It's just more robust and simpler (not for the
implementor :) to keep them as separate names from the start.

Wdyt?

Yes, you're right, duplicated .enc's are a problem.  For that case, I
think by far the best approach is for each .enc to have its own unique

Hi Clea,

    Question: how should these files be packaged? Should they be included
    in all the relevant packages? Should they be packaged separately?
    Individually? (The latter would seem far too complex.)

My suggestion would be to include each file used for font xxx in the
package for xxx.  That makes it easier for each font to be installed,
used, and understood individually.

To minimize the problem of duplicated files, I would put a comment in
the beginning of the file saying "this file is shared between packages
x, y, and z".  Depending on how you have your own infrastructure set up
for these packages, that list could conceivably be automated, if useful.

Since (I believe) the duplicated files are only in the doc/ and/or
source/ trees, not tex/, there's no technical problem with finding wrong
versions at runtime.

Thanks for asking about it.  Feel free to let me know if questions or
problems ...

I'm not sure I follow this. The definition of /fontinst...euro is the
stuff between the square brackets in the .enc file, correct? I would
have thought it would make sense for that to be the same across fonts
just because the encoding is the same.

If I found I needed a different encoding file, I wouldn't alter
ts1-euro.etx/ts1-euro.enc, I'd write a new .etx file and generate a new
.enc file. (Exceptions: if I found I'd made a mistake, I suppose; or if
I wanted to change the .etx file in a way which wouldn't affect the
.enc file; or if ts1.etx/ts1.enc changed; etc.)

I'm not understanding the problem. Suppose font x currently lacks
copyleft, say, to take a concrete ts1 character commonly missing, as
does font y. OK, so next year, x is updated to include copyleft but y
still lacks it. That's fine. The encoding file is just based on the etx
file and so included copyleft from the start. The definition doesn't
need to change.

I'm obviously not seeing the problem because I'd think changing the
name would just make things more confusing. It means having
 	/fontinst...euro-x = /fontinst...euro-y = /fontinst...euro
which will work, but seems needlessly complicated. A bit like having
many different commands with the same definition - it will work but
seems to introduce complications to no purpose. What am I missing?

What if the new glyph is named Copyleft instead of copyleft?  I.e., the
whole problem with euro vs. Euro can repeat ad infinitum, with any glyph
in any font at any time.  Or new glyphs might be created which are
conveniently added in an empty slot, not in a whole new font.  In
general, pretty much every font I know of which started off using
"common" definitions eventually ended up diverging and needing its own
version.

In any event, I suppose it ultimately depends on how careful you want to
be.  If you are confident you will never change ts1-euro in the future,
then there's no technical problem with just using it and repeating it as
many times as you like.  As long as the files are identical, it doesn't
matter which one is found, so (true) duplicates aren't a problem.

I still think each font should have its own copy to avoid dependencies.
Getting back to your original point, I think that duplication is better
than having a separate package with the common files, because
package-to-package dependencies in TL are not perfect and not
guaranteed.

Up to you.  You asked for advice, well, that's my advice :).

    The definition of /fontinst...euro is the
    stuff between the square brackets in the .enc file, correct? 

Yes.

    I would have thought it would make sense for that to be the same
    across fonts just because the encoding is the same.

I was talking about the name, not the definition.  Yes, the glyph names
in the definition have to match whatever the fonts have.  So if the
fonts use the same glyph names, the enc definition will be the same too.
(And, more likely, if the fonts use different glyph names, the enc
definitions have to be different.)

I would do one of two things:
1) if Copyleft occurred very rarely (ie not an issue likely to affect
many fonts), I'd put the Copyleft in a font-specific encoding file and
use \renameglyph{copyleft}{Copyleft};
2) I'd copy ts1.etx or ts1-euro.etx to ts1-copyleft.etx or
ts1-euro-copyleft.etx if lots of fonts used Copyleft rather than
copyleft and edit the file as I did for the euro/Euro case.

I can confidently say that I would not change copyleft to Copyleft in
ts1-euro.etx.

Mostly, I'm using ts1-euro.etx in conjunction with font-specific
encoding files. Only if all of the glyphs needed for TS1 and available
in the font have the names TS1 expects, except for the Euro/euro, do I
use ts1-euro.etx for the TS1 encoding on its own.

I don't really have to be careful. Not changing it is simply part of
the way I've set things up. I have certain .etx files which are
"standard" (customised but standard) which I reuse for new fonts but
don't change in ways which would change the corresponding .enc files. I
keep these entirely separate from the font-specific .etx files. If I
update the support for a font and the glyph names have changed, I'd
edit the font-specific .etx files and regenerate the .enc files, but I
wouldn't change the .etx files I've put into the "standard" group. (I
might copy them and create additional files for the standard group or I
might copy them and turn the copies into font-specific encoding files.
But then I'd rename them.)

Maybe I've just set things up oddly, but being careful really doesn't
come into it.

I also meant the name :). I was thinking a 1-1 mapping from names to
definitions was most straightforward even though a many-1 mapping would
also work.

If the /fontinst... name is changed in the map and enc file, is that
sufficient? Do the vf and tfm files also contain references? (The
pl/vpl files do but I'm not sure if they're just comments.)

Net-install is easy indeed, but consider that in a Linux distribution
TeX Live is only one package among thousands of others.  You are
maintaining TeX Live yourself because 

 1. The Linux distribution you have to use isn't updated regularly

 2. You are interested in the latest stuff

 3. You are testing things before they are officially released.

I don't know much about Red Hat.  Is this an enterprise edition (like
CentOS) where only security fixes are provided?  In this case you
certainly have to maintain TeX Live yourself.  You also have to
install TeX Live on a server yourself if you want to make it available
to clients in a heterogenous network.  Linux distributors don't ship
binaries for other platforms.

I think that most Linux users are using distributions which provide a
package manager which supports updating.  These distributions do not
provide the latest TeX Live release, they lag 1..2 years behind, but
this is acceptable, because not everybody needs the latest stuff.

Not everybody regards TeX as the most important program and it's not
wrong to use an older release.  Sure, teTeX is too old and only a
subset of TeX Live.  But imagine what happens if TeX Live is removed
from Linux distributions and GCC, libc... developers do the same.

Then we end up in a Windows-like environment where users have to
maintain 3rd-party software themselves.  This is unacceptable.

I just want to run "emerge --update world" in order to update the
whole system (Gentoo Linux).  I'm maintaing my TeX Live installations
myself only because I'm more a developer rather than a user.

Why do you say that it's better to remove TeX Live from Linux
distributions?  Because your esteemed admins don't trust you and
refuse to put the binaries you maintain into $PATH?  Do they think
that there is no need to support TeX Live because teTeX is already
available?  I'm wondering because you are obviously maintaining a
recent TeX Live system and say "the majority of my esteemed colleagues
use teTeX".  This sounds like a $PATH issue.

  Reinhard

Indeed, and it's not trivial to update it from 2007 to 2008/2009/2010,
as it wasn't trivial to update from teTeX to TeX Live. Fedora is still
shipping TL2007 (basically since June 2008), and it had teTeX prior to
that.

Indeed. We should rather be grateful that TeX Live infrastructure is
so good that it allows manual installation and maintenance for those
who want the latest bits.

I know, it took me some time to move the packaging over in Debian, hopefully
the move from 2009 to 2010 will be easier thatn the one from 2007 to 2009.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive Pretest - XeTeX segfaults on LInux 64
Message-ID: <4C3A49CD.7030404@arcor.de>

Hi folks,

today I have been testing TL 2010 pretest on both Linux64 and Windows32.

Unfortunately I have been running into segfaults again for XeTeX
on Linux 64 when trying to use OpenType math fonts with XeLaTeX.

It already crashes while loading the unicode-math package, even
before typesetting a single equation, using a test file like this:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{unicode-math}

\setromanfont{XITS}
\setmathfont{XITS Math}

\begin{document}
\end{document}

When it doesn't segfault, XeTeX doesn't work correctly either, e.g.
it ends up with all math-related fontdimens initialized to zero
instead of the values from the MATH table of the OpenType font.

All previous reports on the XeTeX mailing list seem to indicate
that problems with XeTeX exists on several 64 bit architectures
(not just Linux64), while it seems to work fine on 32 bit systems.
(I had no problems testing on Windows32 on 64 bit hardware.)

Given the soon approaching deadline for TeX Live releases, I wonder what 
would be a good workaround to supply a working XeTeX to users:

Would it be a feasible idea to supply Linux32 binaries for XeTeX
on Linux64 platforms? Would this work at all or would this require 
additional infrastructure (e.g. 32 bit versions of libraries)?

I'm just a little concerned that XeTeX seems to be broken on some 
platforms for some time now and nobody seems to be able to fix it,
so I'm afraid that we might end up shipping broken versions.

Is there an easy workaround by just staying with 32 bit for now?

Regards, Ulrik

I assume that the problem is that XeTeX is dynamically linked.  I
don't know which Linux distribution you are using.  I'm using Gentoo
Linux on AMD_64 and Gentoo only supplies shared 32-bit libraries
needed by nonfree 32-bit-programs like acroread.  I assume that a
64-bit version of XeTeX works better on my system.

In order to find out whether dynamic linking is the problem, run

  ldd /path/to/xetex

  Reinhard

I did check with ldd, but I don't have the exact ouput at hand.
AFAIK, the XeTeX-modified ICU library was statically linked.
Only stuff like fontconfig or zlib was dynamically linked.

I am running Ubuntu 10.4 on AMD 64, but I haven't checked yet
which libaries are provided as 64 bit versions.

I wouldn't assume that the problem is with dynamic linking per se.
I rather suspect that there are some issues with parsing the 
font information on 64 bit systems in general. It doesn't always
produce segfaults, but it may simply produce incorrect results.

When I first reported it to the XeTeX list some weeks ago,
my problem was confirmed to exists on Solaris 64 as well,
so this seems to be a generic problem of 64 bit architectures.

I'm pretty sure this is true; it's probably a straightforward error related to data structures/sizes/etc in the code that interprets the font tables, but I haven't had the opportunity to set up a 64-bit system and try to debug it. If someone on a 64-bit system cares to do a debug build and provide a backtrace from such a crash, that would be a good start towards identifying the problem.

It doesn't need to match the filename. There is no problem if you
have a "/my-special-encoding" in a myspeenc.enc file. 

But you should make sure that /my-special-encoding is a unique name.
You shouldn't have two different encodings in files with different
names which use the same name for the encoding. pdflatex will not
care much as it looks mostly at the file name in the map-file, but
dvips will not reload an encoding if an encoding with the same name
as already been used.

Yes. I think I put it badly or was just confused when I wrote that.

Yes. I realise different encodings need different names (even if I
could not have said why). The question concerns what to do about cases
where different font packages use the same encoding i.e. is it best to
have a 1-1 mapping from encoding names to definitions or a many-1
mapping. (The case of a 1-many mapping is definitely out.)

It seems that a many-1 mapping is favourite so that's what I'll do...

The crash has probably nothing to do with dynamic linking indeed. Reinhard was
replying to this paragraph:

so I think his answer is that it is *not* doable to ship 32 bit XeTeX on
LinUX64, since the user would need a 32-bit version of the dynamically linked
libraries.

RHEL based distributions also often contain both i386 and x84_64
libraries. If I install them via "yum install" and do not specify
required platform, then on i386 only i386 libs are installed, on
x86_64 both will be installed . I always install both because some
legacy tools do not work without i386 libraries.

GaramondNo8-Ita.ttf
LetterGothic-BolIta.ttf
NimbusRomNo9L-MediItal.ttf

From
http://mirror.ctan.org/support/ghostscript/AFPL/GhostPCL/urwfonts-1.41.tar.bz2

Using a simple lua code like:
f = fontloader.open(arg[1])
m = fontloader.to_table(f)

The crash happens with the to_table() call. Interestingly, it happens
only with tex-live binary, self built binary from luatex svn repository
don't crash.

Interestingly enough, the version shipped with TL segfaults just as in Ulrik's
report, while a locally compiled version (with debugging symbols, using the
sources in xetex's trunk) doesn't.

Sounds very much like Khaled's report conerning LuaTeX, one hour ago...

I'm now going to try out more versions.

I'd like to emphasize that, if all files are identical, but (all copies)
sometimes change, then at some point there may be two different versions
installed from different packages, so even true duplicates may be a problem if
they're not frozen in time too. (Maybe it was clear already, but I just wanted
to make sure.)

I can't reproduce those exact crashes with the texlive binary
(x64_64-linux). However, in my case the texlive binary crashes on
A030-Bol.ttf and URWGothicL-BookObli.ttf, and a self-compiled
binary crashed on NimbusRomNo9L-Regu.ttf.

Even though the crashes are somewhat random, I do think I have
found what is causing them. Ttx output shows the following:

[taco at boo urwfonts-1.41]$ grep bXHeight *.ttx | grep -v \"0\"
A028-Med.ttx:      <bXHeight value="6"/>
A030-Bol.ttx:      <bXHeight value="164"/>

CenturySchL-BoldItal.ttx:      <bXHeight value="198"/>
Dingbats.ttx:      <bXHeight value="1"/>
GaramondNo8-Ita.ttx:      <bXHeight value="125"/>
GaramondNo8-MedIta.ttx:      <bXHeight value="9"/>
LetterGothic-BolIta.ttx:      <bXHeight value="71"/>
Mauritius-Reg.ttx:      <bXHeight value="11"/>

NimbusMono-Reg.ttx:      <bXHeight value="2"/>
NimbusRomanNo9-MedIta.ttx:      <bXHeight value="162"/>
NimbusRomNo9L-MediItal.ttx:      <bXHeight value="40"/>
NimbusRomNo9L-Regu.ttx:      <bXHeight value="133"/>
NimbusSanL-BoldItal.ttx:      <bXHeight value="4"/>
StandardSymL.ttx:      <bXHeight value="7"/>
U001Con-BolIta.ttx:      <bXHeight value="6"/>
U001-Ita.ttx:      <bXHeight value="1"/>
U001-Reg.ttx:      <bXHeight value="24"/>
URWBookmanL-LighItal.ttx:      <bXHeight value="31"/>
URWClassico-Ita.ttx:      <bXHeight value="8"/>
URWClassico-Reg.ttx:      <bXHeight value="2"/>
URWGothicL-BookObli.ttx:      <bXHeight value="194"/>
URWPalladioL-BoldItal.ttx:      <bXHeight value="15"/>

The panose bXheight parameter is supposed to be between 0 and 7, and
luatex is actually counting on that to convert the number into a string.
This failure to accept rubbish input is a bug that I will commit a
crude fix for in a moment, but nevertheless, this font set is broken as
well: it appears there is a random value in the bXHeight fields of a
lot of the fonts (only StandardSymL makes any sense).

Best wishes,

It has to be unrelated as Khaled's crash happens in code that does not
exist in XeTeX.

I was suspecting a font issue, too, I get no crashes with
urwfonts-8.71.tar.bz2, so may be it has long been fixed.

I have just checked-in a patch to the xetex and texlive source trees to fix the xetex segfault that was occurring with \XeTeXdelcode on some systems. This brings the xetex version number to 0.9997.4.

Anyone who has been experiencing this problem is welcome to build and test the new version to confirm that the crash no longer occurs; obviously, I have not been able to test it personally on all possible systems and configurations.

You will need to rebuild xetex-based format files after installing the new binary, as the .fmt file is not compatible with earlier releases.

For the future: it is much easier to debug problems (any problems) if
they can be reproduced using fonts that are included in TL.  Installing
system fonts is not easy, versions are likely to be different, etc.  

At any rate, hoping that Jonathan's fix will suffice to at least avoid
the crash, I've asked the TL folks to rebuild.

Thanks to you and Jonathan and Thanh :).

Well, in that case, I would like to ask for XITS fonts to be added
to TL as sson as Khaled Hosny has pushed his final version to CTAN.

Yes, when it is on CTAN, it will be included in TL as a matter of course.

Yes, this is exactly what I meant.  Furthermore, consider that TL
currently supports five 64-bit Unix platforms and that one of them,
'x86_64-linux', stands for zillions of Linux distributions.  Finding
out whether all required 32-bit libraries are availabe everywhere is
nearly impossible.  I'm not even aware of all Linux distributions.

Message-ID: <4596EB6E-2B19-40F1-99EE-7EE8B48960DE@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

A problem has cropped up on the TeX on Mac OS X list with someone who is using TL2010 pretest with all updates (as of 12 July). He is using pdflatex with --shell-escape and using both the graphicx and epstopdf package (although the latter is not needed) and has given the full path (/Users/<usename>/Pictures/xxx.eps) to the graphic. In spite of using --shell-escape the xxx-eps-converted-to.pdf file is not created and there is an error message about restricted mode (I guess repstopdf is always used since that is what is set in epstopdf-sys.cfg). In TL2009 (where there was no restricted mode) this worked with --shell-escape. Shouldn't repstopdf behave exactly like epstopdf if --shell-escape is present?

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Hum, this is no easy question. The core problem is, pdftex and repstopdf are
different processes, and there is currently no way for repstopdf to know which
options were passed to pdftex.

A possible way to solve this problem would be :
- make --shell-escape imply openout_any=a and openin_any=a;
- change the \write18 code so that a few critical values (such as shell_escape
and open{in,out}_any) are copied in the environement of the child process.

It looks like the long-term correct fix to me, but of course, such changes are
not going to happen before TL2010 is released.

Manuel.

PS : in the meanwhile, \esptopdfsetup{program at epstopdf=epstopdf} should to the
trick.

Hi---

     There is some error. It says mathspec requires new version of XeTex. So
what should i do. Please provide the command line arguments.

I don't know which version of TeX Live Fedora 13 is stipping, so
providing a bit more information would be useful, or do you expect
us to check what Fedora is actually checking?

Your test run *without* any problem on both Debian/TeX Live which is
TeX Live 2009, as well as TeX Live 2010, so I don't see any further need of
action here.

If Fedora 13 ships TL 2008 or TL2007 or whatever then you have the following
otpions:
- upgrade your Operating System
- install TeX Live 2010 locally
- don't use mathspec

Hi Chandrasekhar,

As I explained earlier, you need to install TeX Live separately from your
Linux package manager. The DVD or the net installer is available from
http://tug.org/texlive/. The package mathspec requires a more recent version
of XeTeX, and if you install TeX Live 2009 or later and run the updater,
you'll be fine because adequate versions of all necessary components are
included there.

Andrew

Since TeX Live 2010 is not released by now (but quite close), please
see this page for pretesting:
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html
If you want the TL 2009 release, please see:
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/
especially:
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

I will not repeat what is written there

Looks fine to me. Tested, works (ie, compiling with an image in a forbidden path
fails without --shell-escape and works with it), hence applied.

Thanks very much for this so prompt fix, Heiko!

Herb, things should work properly starting with tomorrow's updates. Please
report again if it doesn't.

(Btw, in general, I think my previous remark still holds and we should do
something about inheritance of security settings between processes, at some point.)

Just for the record: 0.9997.3 doesn't crash on FreeBSD-8.0/amd64 with
the example originally posted by Ulrik (with or without equation). Of
course, the same goes for 0.9997.4.

I run Fedora 13 and TeXLive, and I use XeTeX frequently. I installed
TeXLive 2009 separately since F13 only has TeXLive 2007. Follow the
standard installation instructions using the netinstaller for TeXLive
2009. I installed everything.

Remove all Fedora packages texlive-*. If RPM complains about
dependencies, force it to remove the packages with

	rpm -e --nodeps $(rpm -qa texlive texlive-\*)

You will have to be root to do this.

I have updated the latest binaries from TL Pretest and tested it
on Linux x86_64. It is getting better, but it is not perfect yet.
It has fixed some problem, but I am still getting segfaults and
malfunctions, depending on which formulas I typeset.

1) I am getting segfaults for formulas involving \left and \right,
i.e. delimiters. See the attached test file xe-test-delim.tex.

The \tracingall output indicates that the segfault occurs at the end
of display math, i.e. when the accumulated math list is converted
to a horizontal and vertical list.  The problem only occurs when
the formula contains \left and \right delimters,  The fraction
in display math is typeset correctly when it appears by itself.

Unfortunately, I don't have a xetex binary with debug symbols,
so I can't provide a meaningful backtrace from the core dump.


2) I am getting incorrect results (presumably caused by incorrectly
reading the font metric data) for formulas involving radicals.
See the attached test file xe-test-sqrt.tex and corresponding PDF.

This seems to indicate that RadicalRuleThickness and or related stuff
is not intialized correctly.

Quick Update:

I have finally tried to build xetex from source on my system.
That version  does _not_ segfault unlike the version from TeX Live.

That may suggest that the segfault problem may be partly due to
library incompatibilities between different Linux distributions.
(Ubuntu has both 64bit and 32bit versions, but uses the 64 bit
versions by default.)

Nevertheless, my self-compiled version still shows incorect ouput,
e.g. big delimiters not growing and radicals printed without a rule.
Essentially, I am back to the exactly the  problem I reported to the 
XeTeX list on 06/06/2010 using a xetex binary from Context minimals.

Regards, Ulrik

Good afternoon, dear developers,

I've played a dummy and tried a couple of things on Ubuntu 9.10.

To the "Installing" section of http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html.
install-tl doesn't work for me as I'm using a specific directory. I can use:
./install-tl
perl install-tl

http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
./install-tl -repository ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/
The release version of the installation source and the installation media do not agree:
source: 2010
media: 2009
install-tl line 463
That's correct.

http://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
./install-tl
The release version of the installation source and the installation media do not agree:

./install-tl -repository ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/tex/local/tlpretest/

After setting .bashrc everything looks fine.

Everything looks fine here.

Well, pTeX and pLaTeX are really there!  

I can recommend you this webpage (Fujita Shinsaku) with some additional packages:
http://xymtex.com/fujitas2/texlatex/

Also packages as zhspacing, gezhu (Jjgod Jiang) and other CJKV-related packages might be added to CTAN / TeX Live one day.

Thank you for TeX Live and all the best!

I added the url of the package on CTAN to all existing README.TEXLIVE files and
made sure it will be added to similar files in the future.

I also modified texdoc so that if finds those README.TEXLIVE files (previously
ignored due to their bizarre "extension"), to help users find this information.
(texdoc update coming in tomorrow's packages)

While checking the README.TEXLIVE files, I made the following count:
- 11 packages have their main documentation excluded due to missing source;
- 7 packages have another document (sample or showcase) removed for this reason.
(Just bare numbers for information.)

hth,
Manuel.

Yes, finally, my move to Japan made me push that a bit, but most credit
goes to Peter Breitenloher who fixed all my integration bugs, plus many
many many bugs in the programs itself!

if these package would occur on CTAN then they would appear in TeX Live
very fast.

Do you want to take the duty to collect these package and upload them
to CTAN, contacting the authors maybe?

zhspacing is on ctan and in tex live (2009 at least).  i don't know if
the complaint is that it's not the latest version: we can't control that
-- we assume that people who update their ctan packages will send us a
version.

gezhu isn't on ctan.  if jjgod jiang chooses to upload it, all to the
good, but i've more than enough to do without chasing packages that
someone other than the author wants on ctan.

> > http://xymtex.com/fujitas2/texlatex/

i don't even understand what most of those are about.  there seem to be
few comments, and those are often in oriental languages that i can't
read.

if someone chooses to upload a bundle of these things to ctan, with
documentation of some sort, then (supposing that the licences are right)
we could expect to see them in fairly short order, too.

The correct URL is http://xymtex.com/fujitas3/xymtex/indexe.html (notice
the 3!)

I would love to see XyMTeX in CTAN; however, for some (unknown to me
reason) he chose to maintain versions on his own server. I have been
using basic XyMTeX macros for years now: publication ready, once the
formulas are correct. About two years ago, I had contact with the
author. But he keeps himself almost hidden and does not answer to mails.

Greetings

Bernhard

Publication on CTAN has nothing to do with versions maintenance. I am
one of the developers of Velthuis Devanagari for TeX. The latest
stable version is on CTAN because TeX users usually look there for
packages. Its documentation says that the package is developed at
Sarovar. Those who need it can find previous stable releases at
Sarovar and even the history in CVS.

not in tex live, afaics.  i was unsure about licence status when i
catalogued it, but wrote down "knuth" in the end; tex live has things

Note, however, that the system checks and will not use a 32-bit library
with a 64-bit program or vice versa.

Again, same here.

What is the build environment for the x86_64-linux texlive binaries?
I.e.:  cross compiling?  Which OS/distribution?  Which compiler version?

Maybe it would help understanding the segfault if Peter compiles a binary with
debug symbols in his usual build environment, and we use it in our runtime
environment to produce a backtrace...

(Fwiw, I've tried the 32-bit binary, and it works ootb (Debian testing) without
segfaulting.)

  The first section contains packages for vertical typesetting, for
example.  It's an area where input from the Japanese community is
obviously most valuable, and where TeX Live is somewhat lacking.  But
this is of course not to contradict you when you say that those packages
should be uploaded to CTAN first.

no: first, there should be some sort of documentation, if only a readme
file with lists of packages and summaries of what they do.

we've got plenty of files with names that offer no hint and no comments
in the source (see uncatalogued macros/plain/contrib, macros/generic,
macros/latex209/contrib) and i *really* don't want to spend the time
analysing what each package does (using an extension of tex i've never
used) so as to write catalogue entries.

so -- as they stand, they would not be accepted on ctan.  we stopped our
subscription to "if it was difficult to write, it should be difficult to
use" some time ago (but we've got a large backlog of work from those
days ... it takes time to decide "this package is useless nowadays, we
just need to say so").

Friendly said, I didn't complain either, I did recommend those packages as your website supports us (the TeX Live users) to do so.  I did contact Mr. Fujita once (no response) and I'm trying it again.  Well, that pTeX in TL2010 makes me happy as I'm reviewing an article about it.  After I installed TL2010 I was ready to start doing my job.  I like it, thanks! ;-)

Btw. I like the way the TL installer checked my path (TL2009) on Windows and corrected it to a new one (TL2010).  That was cool and friendly!

Hello,

I tried an install on Windows (Vista) with "Add shortcuts to menu and

2010 menu, there are just:

  * TeXdoc GUI
  * TeXworks editor

entries and that:

* DVIOUT DVI viewer
* PS_View
* TeX Live documentation

and, more important:

* TeX Live Manager

entries are missing!

Hi.

When one run 'tlmgr check' in TL 2010 the first he/she see will be warning:

I saw the same message when I used TL 2009.

The solution is simple: change '!=' on 102 line to 'ne'.

Subject: [tex-live] textlive seems to ignore top of home tree
Message-ID: <620902.63077.qm@web51107.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Dear All:
I am using texlive on debian squeeze and an NFS-based system.
For some time I had difficulties making texlive find LaTeX classes which I put in my "home tree".

After much trial and error, and following some suggestions I found at:
http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/configuring.html
(thanks, you know who you are!)
specifically running: 
kpsewhich -debug=32 packagename.sty
I became aware that texlive does look inside TEXMFHOME/tex (for us, $HOME/texmf/tex )  but NOT  TEXMFHOME=$HOME/texmf
That is, texlive ignores the "top" (root) of the home tree while searching for LaTeX classes and style files (see example below).

I never encountered information explicitly stating this fact, and in fact naively imagined that by placing a package at the "top" of the home tree (as opposed to a subdirectory within  $HOME\texmf\), texlive would find it more easily.

The above behaviour seems reproducible 100% of the time.  Is it intended  (a "feature"), or  a "bug", or the result of a non-standard configuration of our system?

How/where can one adjust texmf.cnf or whichever appropriate to make texlive consider the top of the tree so that either 
$HOME\texmf\mypackage.cls 
or $HOME\texmf\tex\mypackage.cls 
is found?

Thanks in advance.

Virgil
Example:
a) with the package IEEEtran2.cls in $HOME/texmf/IEEEtran2.cls
$ kpsewhich IEEEtran2.cls
<<nothing reported>>

$ kpsewhich -debug=32 IEEEtran2.cls
kdebug:start search(file=texmf.cnf, must_exist=1, find_all=1, path=/usr/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/share/texmf-texlive/web2c:/usr/local/share/texmf/web2c).

It is one of the most common mistakes when putting files in TEXMFHOME, so it

Why to you want to do so? I recommend you keep the standard layout (see tds.pdf
(which you can locate easily by typing "texdoc tds" in a shell)) unless you have
a strong reason to deviate from it.

Hi, Manuel:
Thanks for your prompt reply. 
Among other sources, I looked at:
http://people.debian.org/%7Epreining/TeX/TeX-on-Debian/ch2.html
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=privinst
as well as the recent discussion here:
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2010-May/thread.html#25729

For example, the first reference states:
"TEXMFHOME: Default location: $HOME/texmf/
Contains user-specific static input files, e.g. new LaTeX packages.
:::::::::::::
If you want to add files, you should usually use TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME, depending on whether you are the system administrator or a user." 

The placement of LaTeX classes in TEXMFHOME/tex/ when mentioned it is done in a way that sounds like a recommendation, and not a hard requirement.

The belief that if the system cannot find something that is in the "top" (root) directory, it would have even more difficulties to find it in a subdirectory -- wrong in this case -- it is somewhat intuitive,  especially for a not so experienced user. 

And if one only has a few items in TEXMFHOME (presumably the most common case) a subdirectory structure would seem unnecessary.  

So, if the administrator can easily reconfigure our texlive system so that it finds both  TEXMFHOME/mypackage.cls and TEXMFHOME/tex/mypackage.cls this could save some users (and possibly help-desk personnel) valuable time  ("latex cannot find my class not matter what I do").

Best,

Virgil

I do second this, I usually have very few stuff in my TEXMFHOME, having
to understand the TDS structure to do a seemingly very simple task like
installing a new OpenType font, seems too much for me.

Yes, but in a TDS tree ... that it the whole discussion about.

	kpsewhich -show-path .sty

would show you the directories actually searched.

I am sympathetic to these views for a small TEXMFHOME where you can just
dump everything into the top-level directory (or arbitrary
subdirectories).

However, TEXMFHOME itself is already being used by other people for very
large trees.  We can't just change the way it's defined without messing
them up.

Adding another tree which looks for anything anywhere seems like the
only viable option, and I don't want to make that big of a change now.
Maybe next time.

No, hurry, it is just something to be considered in the future.

While at it, any chance of TeXLive following XDG Base Directory
Specification[1] in the future?

I didn't think it is such a drastic change, all what I was thinking in
is moving $HOME/.texlive2010 to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/texlive2010 and
$HOME/texmf to $XDG_DATA_HOME/.local/texmf, or something as simple as
that.

Moving the default for TEXMFHOME, et al., to anywhere outside $HOME is
such a radically incompatible change, against user expectations, that I,

The idea is to unclutter the home directory (I've tens of dot
directories and files under may home) and make clear separation between
data, config and cache dirs, so one can easily back up the important
ones from the noise. It is not a big deal, and still too many
non-conforment applications for it to prove any usefulness.

Sorry, but I am unable to follow you.

What I have in mind is to _optionally_ (if the administrator wants) configure the system so that it finds stuff at the top (root) of the home tree, *as well as* in the subdirectories. 

That is, it would find *both*:
TEXMFHOME/tex/mypack.cls (as it does now)
but also
TEXMFHOME/mypack.cls
Those who have a large TEXMFHOME with the recommended subdirectory structure would see NO change in functionality whatsoever... their stuff would be found in the usual way, as now.

On the other hand, those who won't bother with subdirectories (b/c they only have a few items in TEXMFHOME or for any other reason, valid or not) would also have their stuff found.

Of course the system administrator could still choose not to allow  the system to search the top of TEXMFHOME if for some reason s/he thinks that is better. 

I see no one losing.

Sure, but it's easier said than done.

It won't work anyway.  TL depends on the directory structure.  Search
for "TEXINPUTS." in texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.  Search paths depend on the
engine you are using.  You can't throw everything into a single
directory.

Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1007170006400.1368@cyfrifiadurcfr.local>

I'm not sure if this is a fontool or TL issue (or something more local).

For TL 2009, font2afm hangs forever if fed an opentype file:
 	font2afm lmroman10-regular.otf
 	...
It works fine for a truetype font:
 	font2afm lmtypewriter10-regular.ttf
produces lmtypewriter10-regular.afm.

In the case of opentype fonts, a type 1 binary (pfb) file is produced
but no afm ever appears, the script hangs and my computer gets
hotter and hotter.

I tried the script from TL 2008 and that has the same issue.

I don't read perl so I'm not sure exactly what the script is trying to
do or where things are going wrong. cff2kpx seems to work OK (although
this only produces part of what's needed, I know). What is font2afm
calling/doing to write the first part of the afm?

Thanks,

I noticed that the SFD (Spline Font Database) files of XITS font are
installed under fonts/sfd, however the later is supposed to contain
Subfont Definition Files and the two SFD's are completely different.

FontForge's SFD files (and the .fea file) are source files of the fonts,
and thus should go to fonts/source instead. They are useless to TeXLive
anyway since you need FontForge to build them, but it is not distributed
with TeXLive, but if you insist, then they don't belong to fonts/sfd.

Reading the TDS document, I now think they actually belong to the top
directory "source", per the document:

  source is intended for files which are not needed at runtime by any TEX
  program; it should not be included in any search path.

Which is the case here.

Maybe. But then again, at present TL routinely searches whichever directory that contains the user's source tex file.

In fact, a common "workaround" when LaTeX is having difficulties to find a user-installed package is for the user to place the corresponding cls or sty file in the same directory as the source tex file... this seems to work always.
 
This directory could be very large, and have a mix of all types of files (even if not recommended, it is under the sole control of the end user, and could be a (very large) "mess")... TL would find cls/sty files there anyhow. 

The above suggests that making LaTeX treat the top (root) of TEXMFHOME in the exact same way it presently treats the directory where the source tex file resides may be as easy to do as to say it (or only slightly less so).

If you want to put macros in the top of TEXMFHOME,
define the environment variable TEXINPUTS as
export TEXINPUTS=/home/rodxxx/texmf:

Don't forget the last colon.

best of all is to keep a ctan miror and to include

  /local/ctan/tex-archive//   [on this machine, perhaps not on yours]

in the lookup list.  this has the useful side-effect of slowing your tex
runs down to an absolute crawl.

Fontool.  Try writing Marc Penninga.  Dunno if he's still around.

    What is font2afm calling/doing to write the first part of the afm?

I see it calling cfftot1 in the case of otf input, and then rerunning
itself on the resulting pfb, plus calling ot2kpx.  Perhaps running it
under strace/truss would show all the external exec's in sequence.

Hi Michael,

    There seems to be a typo in both typeface.map and fontname.pdf. The
    Zapfino font is referred to in both as zapinfo. 
    
Thanks for the report, but that is not a typo, it's a directory name,
which is always lowercase.

    Additionally, there seems to be no entry for zapfino in any of the
    supplier map files distributed with TeXLive2009.

There is no attempt for those supplier map files to be complete.
Indeed, I don't recall updating any of them in ages.  I add things to
typeface.map independently, when people ask for them.

Best,
Karl

Do you have any contact details for him? The readme date on CTAN is

Hi,

Have I missed something (wouldn't be the first time), or is sTeX missing from TeX Live?

    <http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/stex>

The package is pretty monolithic, so I can't tell exactly whether (say) all of its sources are there or not, but looking briefly it seems to me that there's no reason it should be omitted. (Besides, erm, a really annoying directory structure that would require a bit of work to get it into a decent TDS format.)

(I'm not fussed if it makes it into TL2010 if that's an issue, since tlmgr can always bring it in later.)

Cheers,

i don't think it is, but i'm not entirely sure.  it's one of the things
i've had on my list to work on for some time -- to check and if
necessary write separately catalogue the bits -- but just lately there's
been a bit of a rush of other tex work.  i gather something is imposing
a deadline...

on cursory inspection, i think they are.  however, if you were to demand
assurance, i couldn't yet give it.

I guess "monolithic" was the wrong word. I meant "there's a lot in there and it's not clear to me -- on first look -- how it all relates to each other". What's currently in the catalogue is fine, IMO, considering the documentation of the suite itself.

Right I agree; it seems like everything is composed of dtx files and their extractions.

Hi Will,

    is sTeX missing from TeX Live?

FWIW, when I remove something my (terse) reasons are either in the svn
log message or Master/tlpkg/libexec/ctan2tds or (usually) both.

I regretfully removed sTeX because the new release was simply too
complex for me to deal with.  Given infinite time I could have gotten it
working, maybe using the generic Makefiles, maybe talking to the author,
maybe other things, but I didn't have that long.

Some extremely generic file names (presentation.sty, statements.sty)
also troubled me, although I don't think they actually caused conflicts
at present.

    annoying directory structure that would require a bit of work to get it

The directory structure per se isn't the problem (we just eradicate the
dir structure in such cases, it's a common thing to do), it's the
complex build process.  Just doing the "simple" things like running the
.ins files does not suffice.  Or so it seemed to me.

As you surmise, it won't be in the TL'10 release, but maybe it'll come
back some day.  If you feel like talking to the author, this would be
one of the very few packages where an author-provided TDS tree would
actually be very beneficial.

Best,
karl

Though sources are generally useful, in this case the SFD files provide
almost no data that is not present in the generated OTF files, so apart
from being plain text dump of the fonts (in a format only FontForge can
make use of AFAIK), they provide no extra value.

As previously threatened :), TeX Live is now frozen for the 2010
release.  I updated a few final packages today (bidi, biblatex-apa), but
don't plan to make any more "routine" updates.  Only critical bug fixes
and perhaps doc tweaks.  (And I'll update the Master/source directory
later today or tomorrow.)

We'll rebuild tonight as usual, but (in theory) maybe not after that.

Message-ID: <2F791AFD-5B0A-413C-96F1-5AAC03204696@mac.com>

Hi, all,

This seems like a repeat of a problem I wrote about on 7/8 (to the TeX- 
on-Mac OS X list):

I got a couple of the following errors during an update of the 2010  
pretest, using TLU on Mac OS X.  I updated both a 10.5 and a 10.6  
system at the same time.  The update of the 10.5 system succeeded; the  
update of the 10.6 system failed.

There were two errors from 'fmtutil-sys' ("unknown option `--no-error- 
if-no-format'"); and one obscure error about unhandled status  
results.  I'm attaching the log file from the TLU run.

Checking the version on each system I get

10.5: fmtutil 19225 2010-07-04 12:26:44Z preining $
10.6: fmtutil 17423 2010-03-11 17:53:34Z karl $

which seems telling.  After my problems on 7/8, I waited a day or two  
(following advice resulting from my posting) and then reran TLU.  The  
update succeeded, and until today, I have had no problems on either  
system (at least, none related to tex-live :-}).

FWIW, when I ran the update (yesterday), the tex-live infrastructure  
on both systems was updated first.

Thoughts?

Thanks as always.

Justin

Thanks, that all makes sense. I'll get in contact with the author about supplying a TDS tree and also mention the possible issue with the generic class names.

with fontconfig-2.7.3 (libfontconfig.so.1.4.3).

Was this segfaults for latest XeTeX version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4 ?  There
have been some critical fixes between 0.9997.3 and 0.9997.4!

You are aware that the extension `.sfd' is used for two different file
types, and that FontForge accidentally uses both of them?  I've
`invented' the extension for `Subfont Definition Files' (IIRC, this
was even before George used `.sfd' for FontForge) as needed by ttf2pk,
and I suspect that Karl is talking about this.

It's an unfortunate clash of file extensions...

By "useless to texlive" I was referring to FontForge SFDs, and as they
are now moved to "source" and thus no searched by kpathsea, the clash
should not be an issue, too.

Thank you, Akira. I tried it and it seems to work. 

I also noticed that if there are 2 instances of the same class, one at the root TEXMFHOME, and the other at TEXMFHOME/tex/ kpsewhich takes the one at the root of TEXMFHOME -- which is also taken over any instance in the /usr/... hierarchy. This seems reasonable. 

I would like however to clarify that the above has only a marginal benefit for users who already know that they must (by default) place any "personal" class or style file in the subdirectory TEXMFHOME/tex/ in order for it to be found by LaTeX (that is, the subdirectory structure of TEXMFHOME/ is a requirement, not a recomendation). For users who know, placing a class at the root of TEXMFHOME vs in TEXMFHOME/tex/ makes a very little difference.

The main problem of enforcing the subdirectory structure by default (that is, setting the system so that it finds TEXMFHOME/tex/myclass.cls but NOT TEXMFHOME/myclass.cls ) is that it may lead to significant time waste for those who don't know it (and possibly those who provide support to them).

(This is similar to requiring the user to run texhash after a new class installation in the TEXMFHOME hierarchy, which is a very minor inconvenience if the user knows it is necessary.)

I would strongly advocate that the system default behaviour (subject to overruling by the administrator) should be that it finds by default either 
TEXMFHOME/tex/myclass.cls OR 
TEXMFHOME/myclass.cls

I cannot see how that could hurt anyone -- especially if the system administrator is allowed to re-configure the system so that  it behaves as it does now.

Thanks again.

Virgil

We can use TEXMFHOME for various kinds of files, fontmap files, font
encoding files, TeX macros, configuration files, ...
I strongly recommend to follow the TDS:
Please put LaTeX macros under $TEXMFHOME/tex/latex, and
don't use the top directory for them.

Hi Peter,

The segfault did occur with the latest XeTeX version 0.9997.4.

Updating from 0.9997.3 to 0.9997.4 changed it from segfaulting
immediately when loading unciode-math to segfaulting only in
certain situation, depending on what kind of formulas you typeset.

> with fontconfig-2.7.3 (libfontconfig.so.1.4.3).

Ubuntu 10.4 ships with fontconfig-2.8 rather than fontconfig-2.7.x. 
Could there be compatibility issues with that?
Would it be better to use a static version of libfontconfig?

Regards, Ulrik

P.S: As I wrote earlier, my self-compiled version did not segfault 
when compiled on Ubuntu 10.4, but it did not work correctly either.
As for the latter, I suspect another issue which may be unrelated
to the segfaults.

Hi Ulrik,
fontconfig is linked dynamically because there are system dependent
paths to the config files compiled in.  Static linking is preferred in
TeX Live, but fontconfig is an exception.  A statically linked
fontconfig might work on your system but you can't be sure that the
config files are found on others.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Ulrik,

in principle yes, although libfontconfig.so.1.4.3 (from 2.7.3) and
libfontconfig.so.1.4.4 (from 2.8.0) both use the same soname and thus ought
to be compatible.

I could try to build (actually already done) and install fontconfig-2.8.0,
but should then first upgrade freetype-2.3.11 => freetype-2.3.12 or maybe
even to freetype-2.4.1.

Moreover there are zlib-1.2.3/1.2.4/1.2.5!

Which versions are used by Ubuntu 10.4?

> Would it be better to use a static version of libfontconfig?

Could this different behaviour be due to different gcc (and glibc?)
versions -- caused in both cases by some obscure bug?

Hi Ulrik,

these are libz and libfreetype linked statically into the xetex binary.  The
shared libfontconfig, however, pulls in a libz.so.1 and libfreetype.so.6, as
shown by 'ldd xetex'.  What are their versions?

This is a transient problem, it should happen only once and never on a new
installation. You needn't worry about it.

Thanks for reporting anyway,

This is not required any more since TeX Live 2007.

"Only once"?

Thanks; I'll stop worrying.

We haven't been able to reproduce this problem. Only one of us has access to a

Does anyone else on the list experience the same issue?

Hi--

     Everyone, i had actually installed TeX Live 2010 and compile this using
the xelatex command. Here i attach the log files and the output files. The
output is not coming as i wanted it to come. The math fonts are not at all
changing. I think the error which it is showing is that that font is not
installed but i have installed it already.

Hello, I have been using the TeXLive 2009 from Linux an Solaris updating all 
the installed packages. Unfortunately a month (or so) ago  the tlmgr stopped 
bringing in any updates. Is there anything I can do to rectify this ?

thanks ....

No, this is correct. Updates to TL09 are stopped since we are preparing the
TL2010 release. So, you can only wait for TL2010 to be released, and then
install it, and later update it. TL09 will never be updated again.

P.S: Given that Ubuntu provides both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of all 
the shared libraries, I did a quick experiment today. I installed the 
i386-linux (32-bit) binary for xetex (checked out directly from svn) and 
gave it a try. That version works out of the box on Ubuntu-10.4 and 
produces correct results with Unicode math fonts. If all else fails with 
the 64bit binary, I coud indeed switch to using the 32bit binary as a 
workaround on Ubuntu.

    If all else fails with the 64bit binary, 

We won't be changing the binaries again for the TL 2010 release, so that
sounds like your only viable alternative.

Yes they are -- look carefully at those 'k' symbols.

fontspec is reporting that the italic font can't be found automatically. You may need to specify it manually (see the fontspec manual).

Furthermore, when using luatex with web access, why not include
some google search space or some other search machines into the
tex search path?

Yes, namely after the first update of the texlive.infra package and
before the second run that updates the tetex-scripts (or so) package
which contains the fmtutil script.

Hi Ulrik,

this might indicate a 64bit problem, and if so could also manifest itself
for other architectures.

Hi, Akira:
Apparently I didn't explain myself well in my previous email. Let me try again.

I already know that the subdirectory structure of TEXMFHOME has shifted from a recommendation, to a requirement. Therefore, I have *already* moved the ONE (1) class file that I have in TEXMFHOME -- which I had naively placed in TEXMFHOME -- to TEXMFHOME/tex/ (this class is also in our distribution tree, but I had to made some relatively minor changes to the distribution version in order to accomplish certain objectives).

While it seems unnecessary to have a subdirectory structure for a directory that only contains ONE (1) file in total, for those like me who already know of this requirement, placing a class in a subdirectory as opposed to the top of the directory is not a big deal.

I have also followed your kind suggestion of setting the environment variable TEXINPUTS=TEXMFHOME.  Even though I already know that the subdirectory structure of TEXMFHOME is a requirement, I prefer that the system searches for classes at the top of TEXMFHOME in case I eventually forget about the subdirectory requirement-- which is exactly what the system do with the directory where the source latex file is located.

So, from a selfish viewpoint, I am covered.

Now, considering that every day new people come into LaTeX, and that placing a class file at the top of TEXMFHOME has been recognised (even in this very thread) as a common mistake, one has to consider the possibility that other people will make the same mistake (as egregious as it may be). And these people may waste valuable time searching for a "solution" to their "problem" : LaTeX will not find the file placed at the root of TEXMFHOME. What to do about it?  

Those in a position of power can do one of two things:
1) Nothing... afterall it is those users fault that they don't know that a TEXMFHOME subdirectory structure (even if only for one (1) file) is required... Even if those users jointly waste lot of valuable time because of this... so what... it is their fault anyway. Sooner or later they'll figure it out, and they would have learned their lesson. 

2) While the above approach is appealing, a radically different approach is also possible... Even though it is technically the users fault not knowing about the required subdirectory structure, the powerful people could still try to save thosese users valuable time... after all, their wasted time does constitute a "social cost", and if one can prevent such waste by doing a minor thing that won't bother anyone, why not?

Those who believe that option 2 is reasonable and actually socially superior to (1) can opt to configure the system so that BY DEFAULT it searches BOTH the top of TEXMFHOME and the appropriate subdirectory (administrators that don't like it may still re-configure their systems as they see fit).  This way, those who have all their subdirectories will see no significant loss, but the poor souls that for some reason have no subdirectories won't have to waste valuable time searching in vain for a solution to a problem that does not exist.

Thanks.

Virgil

    BY DEFAULT it searches BOTH the top of TEXMFHOME and the appropriate
    subdirectory

As I said before: that would be nice in theory, but as far as I can
tell, it would inflict an unacceptable performance hit for some people
currently using TEXMFHOME.

The only compatible solution I can think of is to invent a new tree that
doesn't require the subdir structure.

In any event, neither of these things would be simple to do, and require
considerable thought.  (If you don't understand why this is so, please
just take my word for it.)  Perhaps for TL'11.

Thanks for the suggestion.

Fwiw, I'm using the same mirror (ctex.org) and never experienced any problem
with symlinks.

Maybe more relevant than your OS is the filesystem of the partition where the
files are placed. I see the location is under /media, maybe you're using a
removable medium such as a USB stick, which are usually formatted in fat32,
which would explain the problems with symlinks.

The new users (and most of the experienced users) seldom need any
packages which are not part of TL. Packages  are "just one file" also
very seldom. In few years of just dropping files to the directory one
will create a bloody mess and it would be virtually impossible to say
what package some file belongs to. I have seen local-texmf transformed
to a city garbage dump which nobody wants to touch anymore. Even
without performance hit, encouraging this kind of behaviour looks like
very bad idea

You ask for changing the behavior of the whole system only because you
eventually forget something?  Are you serious?  If you fear that you
forget something, just write it down.

If software is not packaged reasonably (see below), I assume that it
comes at least with a README or INSTALL file containing installation
instructions.  If not, the package author is the culprit, not the
user.  But if the package author provides instructions and a user
doesn't read them, I fear that the user has to learn his lesson.

You are discussing a very special case.  Usually users want to install
whole packages, including documentation, examples, and sources.  Then
a flat directory structure doesn't make sense anymore.  Furthermore,
many packages provide files like README and manual.pdf.  You cannot
safely install more than one package in a single directory.

I'm convinced that that option (2) is neither reasonable nor socially
superior to (1).  If people aren't aware of TDS when they install the
first package, they won't be aware of TDS when they install additional
packages.  Thus, what you propose doesn't solve the problem, it just
delays it until nothing works anymore as expected.

The preferred way to distribute TeX software is to create a .zip file
which has a TDS standard compliant directory structure.  This file can
be extracted either in TEXMFLOCAL or in TEXMFHOME and users don't have
to worry about TDS at all.  If the author of the package doesn't
provide such a .zip file, he should at least provide installation
instructions.

I don't know where you got the class file from, but it's quite unusual
if such a file is shipped without documentation.  I'm wondering why
you always emphasize that you want to install ***ONE*** file only.
Don't you want to install the documentation too?

Is the class file you are talking about shipped without any
installation instructions?

There are some reasons why I'm convinced that your proposal isn't
reasonable.  Assume that users are not supposed to be aware of TDS.
Then it's not sufficient to put the top-level TEXMFHOME directory into
the search path.  It's more likely that they want to install a .zip
file which has a non-TDS-compliant directory structure.  In order to
support this, TEXMFHOME has to be searched recursively.  But then it
can't be guaranteed anymore that kpathsea always finds the correct
files.

Another reason is that currently the search strategy is the same in
all texmf trees.  Treating TEXMFHOME differently requires extra
explanations in the TL user manual.  Is it reasonable to add more
complexity to the software and to blow up the user manual only because
there are a few guys who refuse to read the manual?

I strongly recommend to leave everything as it is.  Virgil, your
problem is too special and you wasted a lot of time because either the
class file you installed was provided without installation instructions
or, if there are any, you didn'd read them.  I don't think that TeX
Live should provide a workaround.

Your proposal is based on the wrong assumption that people want to
have a class file in the top-level directory.  Nobody wants to have a
class file there, everybody wants the whole package, with documentation,
examples, and sources.

  Reinhard

Well, just following Akira's suggestion I achieved the exact functionality that is being proposed with one single line of "code" 
(export TEXINPUTS=/home/rodxxx/texmf: )
With that LaTeX looks for a class first at the top of /home/rodxxx/texmf then in the subdirectory /home/rodxxx/texmf/tex/ which exactly what is being proposed as default behavior (with the obvious benefit that if the user does not put the class/style file in a subdirectory it would still be found).

So the only remotely conceivable "performance hit" that I can imagine is the act of looking for the class/style file at the top of the home tree... and action equivalent to looking for the class/style file in the work directory, which LaTeX currently DOES always, without anyone complaining about it.

I myself cannot notice any performance difference while doing simple tests of this action. Then again, if I had a million items at the top of the home tree then there may be a performance hit... but I cannot imagine a reasonable set of circumstances leading to any user having a huge number of items in the HOME tree... most of what s/he needs should be available at either the distribution tree or the LOCAL tree (both managed by an administrator presumably... otherwise the user could installed any desired package in the main tree, using the standard tools).

But if this was really a problem, it could in principle be solved (I suppose almost as easily) by asking LaTeX to first look inside the appropriate home tree subdirectory and then, ONLY when it could not find what was looking for, at the top of the home tree. In this scenario, whenever the user has put the package in the expected subdirectory, LaTeX would behave in the EXACT same way it does today, so that those with a TEXMFHOME according to the recommended (required?) structure wouls see ZERO effect.

In any case, I continue to be puzzle by the fact that today LaTeX seems to always look (by the fault) in the user work directory (which could conceivably be a huge mess with all sort of files in it) and no one seems bothered by it, yet somehow we are expected to accept that if LaTeX treat the top of the home tree in the exact same way it treats the work directory today some major problems would arise. If this was true, it would be highly counter-intuitive.

Btw, maybe it would be better the other way round: looking first at the
"regular" location, then at the root of the tree:

export TEXINPUTS=:/home/rodxxx/texmf

Trust me (and Karl, and others), some users *do* have a huge number of files in
TEXMFHOME. (I, for example, used to have a rather large TEXMFHOME on my
university account some time ago: the admin didn't want to update TeX Live there.)

LaTeX writes down some information in an auxiliary file foo.aux when compiling
foo.tex, obviously in the current directory, then reads this file again to get
the information back. So the current directory *has* to be searched unless you
want to break LaTeX and probably dozens of packages using similar mechanisms.

Reality is sometimes counter-intuitive, at least if your intuition is not
regularly fed with a lot of surprising examples of how people use TeX.

Also, please understand that we are currently concentrating on preparing a
release, so this is not exactly the best moment to discuss such big changes
(which, as Karl said, require careful thought). But be assured that we won't
forget to discuss it for a future release.

Manuel.

Even with an up to date distribution, I confirm the trouble on Windows
Seven: either intall-tl.bat or install-tl-advanced.bat, with
administrator rights or not, is displayed in English though the OS
language in use is French.

The problem seems to be rather recent: if I remember well, my first
tests 10 days ago were OK from this point of view.

On Windows Vista, everything is OK.

Best regards.

Then for sure something else must be the reason,because there have
been *no* changes at all in this area since about half a year or so!!!

Only because *you* cannot imagine some problems does not mean they
don't exist. I don't see much contribution (besides whining) of you
in the last 10 years, so why don't you *simply* trust those people
who are working on preparing TeX distributions since more than 10 years?

So, why - instead of whining and whining - don't you get your *** off
and program that into the LaTeX kernel, or into libkpathsea, or wherever
you think it is appropriate and supply a patch to that?

> In any case, I continue to be puzzle by the fact that today LaTeX seems

Ever, *ever* tried to understand what is written there?

Philip, please don't start *that* one again. I guess if you would
take your time and count:
- the number of friendly and helpful answers
- the number of sarcastic answers
these numbers wold speak much more than the two sentences you wrote.

My personal estimate is that the last number is far below 1% of the
third number.

No, I'm sorry, every time that you, or one of your fellow
implementors, finds it necessary to resort to sarcasm in
order to make what might otherwise be a valid point, all
you achieve is to bring the good name of TeX Live, and
your own reputation(s), into disrepute.  I for one find
your sarcasm highly offensive, and cannot understand
how a person such as yourself, who is friendly, pleasant
and helpful in real life, can find it necessary to
descend to these depths.

Sincerely :

I first thought something similar, but then if the normal - distribution -
pdflatex is used (as it seems from /usr/bin in the beginning), then it
should also find the distribution specific texmf.cnf.

Sarcasm is a very nice thing, and very typical for Viennese people,
I like sarcastic people, the know not to take themselves to serious
since we are all jokes.

Well, I disagree. It might happen that one is getting pissed of, but
everyone searching for answers and reading through the mailing list
archives, will see 99+% of helpful comments, and far less than 1% of
sarcasm, and furthermore, sarcasm that spreaded out *AFTER* the 
user got a working solution for his problem, and was told several
times that what he wishes is not a feasible solution, and after
that he continued and continued. SO please, tell me that this is
inappropriate behaviour from our side? None of us has infinite
patience, and using some sarcasm in these very few cases helps a lot
to give nice and friendly answers to other not tooo intelligent questions.

Why do you think that sarcasm == (negative meant) depth? I think 
sarcasm gives a bit of spice to life, like strong red chillis.

Yes, if we're standing side-by-side at the camp fire, and you
accidentally throw your beer all over me, and I say (sarcastically)
"Thanks, Norbert !", no-one will take offence.  But a mailing
list isn't like that : I don't know how many members this list
has, but every time that anyone resorts to sarcasm, I suspect
that the majority of the list recipients wince.  We all /know/
that some questioners can appear opaque, and that some questions
are dragged out beyond all reasonable expectations, but that really
doesn't give you (or any other list member) carte blanche to let
loose with ill-concealed vitriol.  Try (please) just to step back,
and let someone else who is less inclined to go o.t.t., respond
to the question/questioner/offender.

Sincerely :
** Phil.

I counted (probably wrongly), but there were at least 12 friendly 
and helpful answers before followed by regurgitating the same comments
over and over again ... wasn't that enough time?

Time to stop responding, undoubtedly; time to resort
to public sarcasm, no (IMHO).

No further comments from me : I've made my point, and
leave it to others to comment if they wish.

I second this: Being Viennese too, you should have some mercy for us
doing `raunzen' all the time...  Here's a nice page which touch the
whole topic slightly:

Norbert, there you can also find two Haiku in Viennese dialect :-)

I have seen such errors in RHEL based Linux distributions if TeX (that
comes with Linux) is not completelly installed and path to TL binaries
is not in the beginning. In the past it happened to me too. Another
source of such a problem may be some TeX related environment variable
that remained set from the TeX distribution coming with the Linux
distribution. If nothing helps, "strace" can show what is happening
but I would start with PATH and verification of the environment
variables. It should be possible to find them by

set | grep TEX

I always think of it as quite British. When I lived in the States I not
infrequently engendered confusion because my sarcastic comment would be
interpreted literally and I had to explain it was a "joke" (=not
literally meant or not entirely serious).

I personally found the interjection something of a relief, but perhaps
I am not entirely typical.

I am impressed by the thought that somebody could have found it "highly
offensive". I did not find it offensive but I could understand somebody
finding it mildly so. But there is so much excellent competition in the
world that I cannot but be impressed that somebody could find it highly
so.

In any case, it is not always wrong to offend, even knowingly. There is
a prima facie case against it, perhaps, but no more than that.

Not in unix-like systems, unlike in Windows TEXMFCNF and texmfcnf are
different environment variables.

Yes, but it was the path to which I was referring : my
path contains "E:\TeX\Live\2009\bin\win32" and that
element would not be found by a case-sensitive
search for "TEX".

OK, a simple confusion over the ambiguity of "them", then.

I took "them" to be "PATH and [...] the environment
variables", whereas I now think that by "them" you meant
only "the environment variables".

You misunderstood. I have ALREADY implemented Akira's suggestion, so that if I ever forget that the TEXMFHOME subdirectory structure is now a requirement, the system will still find a package that I may have placed at the top of the home tree. 

I need nothing. This discussion is for the benefit of those who do not YET know about the mandatory subdirectories.

No, the use case I am thinking of is imho the most common these days... the user only needs to install the cls or sty file in the home tree because,
(a) a new version of the package addresses a nagging bug, but the system administrator does not want to deal with it until a major upgrade is performed, and the user does not wish to wait, or
(b) a slightly modified version of the cls/sty file is available (done by the user, a friend, colleague, etc) to meet certain special need and the user wants to install the slightly modified file in his/her home tree.

In both cases, the package "support" files are already available in the "main tree" and need not be re-installed.

I believe the above use cases are the most prevalent these days, because as storage has become plentiful, installed TeX systems tends to be very rich in terms of the packages they provide.

Good question.

The output of

  echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'

is quite helpful too.

Additionally it's helpful to get the output of

  tlmgr conf

I have the impression that not many people are aware of this feature
though it's soooooooooooooo helpful.

It does the same as teTeX's "texconfig conf" but works on Windows too.


Yesterday Chandrasekhar said that he installed TL 2010 and sent us a
log file produced by xetex.  According to the banner, he's actually
using the latest stuff:

This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.3 (TeX Live 2010) (format=xelatex 2010.7.14)  19 JUL 2010 23:22

But according to the log file, all macro packages are found in
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist, thus I suppose that he installed TL in
/usr and overwrote the TL system provided by Fedora.  I'm wondering
why xetex works but pdflatex not.  Maybe the installed Fedora release
doesn't provide xetex yet.  However, such a setup is problematic: The
Fedora binaries are in /usr/bin and the TL-2010 are in
/usr/bin/<platform>/ (if installed this way).  /usr/bin can't be
removed from PATH.  If TL-2010 is really installed this way, it might
help to try this:

Start a new shell (or open a new terminal window) and type:

PATH=/usr/bin/<platform>:$PATH
pdflatex lshort

Does this work?

It's never a good idea to install packages you maintain yorself in
/usr.  Even if this works, it can happen that Fedora's package tool
pulls in TL again if there is a dependency from another package and
overwrites parts of TL-2010 with older stuff.

I strongly recommend to install software you maintain yourself in
/usr/local and leave the rest of /usr to Fedora's package manager.

Chandrasekhar, I don't know how good your internet connection is,
i.e. how painful it is to install TL-2010 again.  But I strongly
recommend to install TL again in the directory proposed by the
installer.

1. Uninstall TL using Fedora's package manager.

2. Remove remnants from TL-2010.  If there is a directory
   /usr/bin/i86-linux or /usr/bin/x86_64-linux, check the creation
   date (ls -ld --time=ctime /usr/bin/<platform>).  If it's from 
   July 19, it was created by the TL installer and can safely be
   removed.  If it's older, you have to investigate whether it
   contains stuff not related to TL.  Also look for directories
   /usr/texlive and /usr/share/texlive.  You can remove them, but
   first save anything you installed yourself in texmf-local.

3. If you want to have Fedora's TeX Live as a fallback, you can
   install it now.  This is not necessary, you can do it any time
   later, if you want at all.

4. Install TL-2010 again using the installation directories proposed
   by the installer.

5. Set your PATH like this:

   PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/<platform>:$PATH
   export PATH

   You can do this in your ~/.bashrc if you only need it yourself, if
   you want a system-wide configuration you have to do this in the
   bash config file in /etc, but this is quite system depended
   (because package managers have to add/remove things).  If you don't
   know where to add the lines above, I'm sure that Zdenek can help.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Maybe Fedora's TeX is broken. Then it would be Fedora's problem.

Which crystal ball???????????  I examined the log file he sent us.

 > Maybe Fedora's TeX is broken. Then it would be Fedora's problem.

Please read my mail instead of using a crystal ball.  Chandrasekhar
isn't using Fedora's TeX, at least not deliberately.  He installed TeX
Live 2010.  Again, from his log file:

 > This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.3 (TeX Live 2010) (format=xelatex 2010.7.14)  19 JUL 2010 23:22

I assume that he installed TL-2010 over Fedora's TeX.  Then you can't
blame Fedora.

Your question "How did you install TeX?" is not specific enough.  I
assume that he used the TeX Live network installer.  And without being
more specific, you can't expect a more specific response.

In the reply to Phil's mail you said:

 > Chandrasekhar hasn't supplied enough information.

Sure, there are still some open questions, but he supplied a log file,
at least.  Hence he provided much more useful information than many
others who ask for help on this list.

The content of my previous mail was based on the information I
retrieved from the log file he sent us.  And I'm very glad that
Chandrasekhar sent us his log file, it's the best he could do.

Regards,
  Reinhard

So was my advice. I am familiar with RHEL based distros and I saw
several times in the past the very same conflicts between TL and TeX
coming with RHEL based Linux, and Fedora is RHEL based. I could also
asume that Fedora's TeX distro does not contain xetex, that's why it
canot cause any conflict. And why the files are loaded form Fedora TeX
directories? Either TL was installed over Fedora's TeX or TEXINPUT is
defined in the profile or the .rc file. It can be found from the
supplied log, Octopus Paula not needed here.

Phil didn't waste bandwidth.  Is a 679-byte mail message a problem for
you?  There's nothing wrong with Phil's mail.  

Why didn't you ask Zdenek to shut up when he said that he has only the
environment in mind though he formerly wrote "...I would start with
PATH and verification of the environment variables"?  At this time you
weren't concerned about bandwidth at all.

Phil explained in his mail how he interpreted the phrase "...I would
start with PATH and verification of the environment variables".  This
was necessary, of course, because otherwise other people might think
that he's an idiot because he was talking about PATH while nobody else
remembers that PATH was mentioned in the original message and
everybody believes that it's his own invention.

Martin, could you read the mails before you respond?

  Reinhard

Preining: You are clearly out of line here, and should be ashamed of yourself for your improper and uncivil tantrum. 

This discussion is clearly appropriate for this list. Anyone is free to follow it or not, to reply or not, and of course to heed any suggestion or not. 

As much as it may bother you, there is nothing inherently wrong with this: User makes a suggestion. Some choose to reply. User chooses to answer to some replies. Some choose to further reply to user's replies, and so on.  It boils down to adults choosing how to invest their time concerning a discussion that is clearly relevant. 

Neither you nor anyone else has been forced to read anything (other than the subject line) or reply to anything or much less do anything. Those who have participated have done so on their own free will.

Exactly. That would be the civil way to proceed given your belief...Except you should have done it *before* the message I am replying to.


On the other hand, others may choose to continue to participate... (and you may choose to ignore their participation).

Please stop being impolite.

Mr. Preining is investing a lot of his private time for TeXlive which
one should honor in much a different way. 

And just because you have a different opinion or you think your opinion
is not accounted enough for does not give you the right to get
offending.

Thanks.

If your statement is true, Robin (and I sincerely hope
that it is not), then that is a sad reflection on the
TeX Live project.  What Virgil is trying to do is to make
life simpler for the first-time user of TeX Live : we both
know that learning TeX itself is non-trivial, so to expect
a first-time user of TeX Live to also familiarise himself
with the requirements of the TeX Directory Structure is
(IMHO) not very realistic.  Virgil is proposing that
such a user should be able to place a small number of
private files in the root of his/her TEXMFHOME directory,
and that TeX Live should be able to find them there.
It is not at all clear to me why the received opinion
is that this would cause a massive performance hit.
Virgil is not (as far as I can tell) suggesting that TeX
should search the entire TEXMFHOME tree before looking elsewhere --
rather that TeX should look first in TEXMFHOME itself
(presumably after looking in the current working directory)
and then continue to use its normal search mechanism.

Completely agree.  I made the change and it seems to work as expected... if there is an instance of a given file at the top and in the subdirectory, kpsewhich points to the instance in the subdirectory. But if the only instance is at the top, kpsewhich still finds it. I think exactly that would be the ideal default behaviour.

There may well be some users with huge TEXMFHOME. But still one has to consider:

(a) the percentage of those users in the total user base

(b) the typical "proficiency" of such users (vs the average user)... Power users are likely to be over-represented among such users -- those with huge TEXMFHOME. 

(c) A decrease in performance, while undesirable, it is a relatively mild problem (within reason) in the sense that the user is able to continue to get the job done (even if not as fast as s/he would like to)... Under most scenarios it would be non-emergency... the user could without a lot of pressure seek help to determine why the system seems to run slower than expected and eventually figure out what may be wrong. On the other hand, a condition such as "class not found" stops the user from accomplishing any usable work, and may have severe consequences under certain scenarios (missing an important deadline, perhaps?). Thus, it would seem that the priority should go to the latter case.

(d) Today's the typical user has a lot more computer resources (processing-speed, memory, storage, network connection, etc) at his/her disposal than even a few years ago... this means that what would have been a major performance issue a few years ago, may no longer be so... 

For example, suppose that the modification above adds 1000 additional "steps" to the typical LaTeX run, and each step on average involves 20 raw CPU instructions (these numbers may or may not be realistic, they are only for illustration)... that would be 20 thousand CPU instructions for EVERY run... sounds like a huge problem, 20,000 additional instructions PER RUN... Yet, today a typical PC CPU can do 20 billion of instructions per second (20,000 MIPS), so the additional 20,000 instructions per run would induce a meagre micro-second of running time!... that is, even after one million runs, the user would have only "wasted" one second (in total)!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second
Compare that to the time a typical "newbie" could waste trying to "solve" the "LaTeX cannot find a class in my home tree" non-problem..

Thank you. As I indicated elsewhere, I am only suggesting -- for the benefit of others, I hope --... I am well aware of the many advantages of the free-software development model, but also of its limitations... I hope and trust to the extend possible that the above issue will be addressed in the most appropriate fashion, as soon as possible/practical.

Best,

Virgil

Are you saying that a "first time user" changes class files and put
them into TEXMFHOME????? Are you joking or is that serious?

The OP asked about a changed .cls file ...

I somehow feel like this thread is loosing more and more the contact 
to reality.

At least *I* was using LaTeX for a long long time until I had the need
to change a .cls file, or creating my own sty files outside the 
current project ...

Well, maybe I am so stupid and retarded and others are doing that right
after the 
	\documentclass{article}\begin{document}Hello World\end{document}
If this is the case, please simply feel pity for such a retarded one,
and sorry for disturbing the great minds.

The problem with this suggestion is that it facilitates a creation (in
the not so distant future) by such user of the bloody mess which
he/she later will ask to help to clean someone else and this someone
else will say a lot of nice well deserved four letter words in English
(or longer in other languages) about poor moron who created this mess
and those who made it possible.

Unless I am missing something obvious, this should do
the trick:

TEXMF =
$TEXMFHOME;{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

But the first-time user isn't necessarily the author
of said .cls file. He/she may be a new postgrad,
just starting in a High Energy Physics group somewhere,
and will almost certainly acquire some locally customised
files from those already there.  That is certainly
how things were at Royal Holloway : I can't imagine that
things are substantially different at any University
that you have experienced.

The first time user IMHO makes use of what is available in his distro.
If he or she needs something nonstandard that cannot be installed by
standard menas, the probably puts it to the current directory and it
will work. If such a user starts building a flat file collection
without understanding the internals, it will sooner or later result in
a garbage, his or her distro will cease to work and nobody will be
able to help, the only remedy would be to erase everything and start
the whole installation from scratch. As I understand Norbert's
reasoning, his advices should prevent such a bad situation from the
very beginning. He tries to educate users not to create unmanagable
garbage.

Excellent :-)  Now in your opinion (and you have at least
as much experience as any of us, and more than most),
could this lead to an unacceptable performance hit ?

I sometimes do it too, but I tell th user:

1. If he or she is very inexperienced, I say "put it to the direcotry
containing your document"

2. If he or she can undestand the concept of directories, I say
"create such a directory and put it there", or if the package consists
of several files, I create a TDS-compliant zip and explain how to
unpack it

3. The best way is to maintain a network installation so that the
users just mount it and everything is on proper places automatically.

Unfortunately (2) & (3) require skills that are not to be
found in every research group.  I would be pretty confident
that whilst most P/G TeX users in their 3rd year will
have created one or more modified style files to suit
the requirements of their Department, few if any will
have the slightest idea what TDS is.  The overlap
between the two skill sets {Hacking TeX source},
{Understanding TDS} is just nowhere near as great
as some people believe.  H at ll, I have been hacking
TeX source since 1986 (25 years), and I have /never/
read the TDS specification, nor would I claim more
than a passing awareness of (some of) its contents.

LOL! I know many very intelligent people who (on UNIX) never created
intentionally a directory and never changed it and just saved
thousands of files under non-descriptive or confusing names in their
home directories and then spent hours trying to find a necessary
document. Or engaged in competition who places more icons per pixel
on their desktops.

The temptation is to keep trying to find a totally convincing
argument that the other party cannot deny. But sometimes you have to
acknowledge that the other side won't budge no matter what, and then
it is time to shut up.

Sure, but then you cannot assume that such people will be able to put
anything to TEXMFHOME's root and still keep their TL working for
longer time period. Putting a modified class to the document's
directory is much safer.

Right! Because they put EVERYTHING in their home directories (or
desktops, depending on OS)

No, I don't think so. But it is not the best of ideas for various
other reasons, in that I agree with the other people that have
responded in opposition to a flat TEXMFHOME.

We sure want to make life simpler for newcomers (and intermediate users), and
are interested in suggestions for doing so. As I stated earlier, we did put this
item on our list for further rumination (which doesn't mean we will change
something in the default setup, maybe we won't, that's all the point of
ruminating: we don't know in advance).

What we are surely *not* interested in is reading repeatedly the same kind of
arguments from Virgil while we are now perfectly aware of the problem but made
it clear we will not be acting upon it soon.

I don't know if I was a typical user at that point, but when I first tried to
install something in my TEXMFHOME, I remember doing at least two mistakes: not
running mktexlsr, and not creating a tex subdirectory (so, believe me, I
understand Virgil's request quite well). I then "understood" that I needed to
put the files in tex/latex (for some reason I thought the latex subdir was
mandatory too) and went that way for quite some time. I discovered the concept
of TDS much later.

I think the opinions about massive performance hit was based on the misleaded
assumption that the entire TEXMFHOME tree would be recursively searched. But
there are other potential problems with looking at the root of TEXMFHOME, like
possible mess (at the root and/or with duplicated files in the tree and at the
root), inconsistency with other trees (why not do the same for TEXMFLOCAL), etc.

Anyway, as far as I am concerned, now is not the time to discuss this (and the
current thread didn't evolve as an appropriate place for calm technical
discussion), so the discussion is (temporarily) over for me.

Thanks,
Manuel.

I think that's a shame, Manuel, because the thread /did/ revert
to a civilised discussion, and it would be nice if it could
now be drawn to a mutually agreeable conclusion.

Sorry, but not everybody has the time for useless endless discussions,
regardless whether they are civilised or not.  Everybody is aware of
Virgil's standpoint now.  Isn't this sufficient?  Nothing will be
changed only because someone repeats his arguments again and again
while disregarding the concerns of others.

There's no need to continue the discussion.  We already know what he
wants.

Karl already said:

 > In any event, neither of these things would be simple to do, and
 > require considerable thought.  (If you don't understand why this is

Isn't this clear enough?

I have the impression that Virgil believes that he can enforce things
when he's only annoying enough.  And it bothers me that I wasted my
time writing down my concerns and Virgil permanently ignores them.
Zdenek also explained his concerns and they were ignored too.  It
obviously doesn't matter whether we post our explanations to a mailing
list or to /dev/null.

Continuing the discussion is useless, in the sense that it has no
impact on TeX Live.  Everybody is aware of his arguments already and
there is no need to repeat them again and again.

Furthermore, I fully agree with Victor Ivrii:

You might claim that it's too sarcasic, too impolite, ... , but it's
the truth, sorry.

sarcasm is only improper if it comes, as a result of total exhaustion of
patience, from a member of the tl team.

of course, the op obviously believes, as did a rather earlier of the
same name

  Conticuere omnes intentique ora tenebant

i.e., everyone shuts up and listens carefully ... when he starts to
speak (or, in the original

  inde toro pater Aeneas sic orsus ab alto

)

i'd better shut up now, or people will start associating *me* with the
tl team, whereas all *i* do is distribute the stuff.

Yes, thus spoke Vergilius ...

There's no need to mention the "TL team" at all because it's not
relevant here.  It's Karl who has finally to decide whether changes
like that proposed by Virgil are made or not.  Suggestions made by
team members have no higher rank than those made by anybody else on
this mailing list.  Only the arguments count.

I've the impression that some people on the list believe that what
team members say is the official opinion of the team.  But there is no
such "official opinion".  The team consists of individuals who have
their own interests, ideas, and opinions.  Each member works on a
different part of TeX Live.  The only thing they have in common is the
goal to make TeX Live as useful as possible for everybody.  It even
happened occasionally that team members had different opinions.  Then
Karl was asked for a decision.

The TeX Live team can be considered as an orchestra conducted by Karl.

I hope this makes clear why I'm not happy when the expression 
"TL team" is associated with my mails.  The only one who can speak
officially for the team is Karl.  I can only speak for myself.

Robin, you are concerned that people associate you with the "TL team"
and I'm concerned that people believe that what I say is the official
opinion of the team.  The best solution for both of us is to simply
avoid the term "TL team" in our mails.

Regards,
  Reinhard

i wouldn't say i'm concerned about such a view, except in so far as it's
unreasonable to associate me with such a hard-working and skillful group
of people.

rather, i was suggesting that people like vergil and phil taylor and so
on will assume the worst of what i say, and make mischief for the
workers on tl from it.

it's a sorry tale, this.  let's try and forget it.  i've formed my own
view of the request, and shall not bother to expose it.

Assuming that you meant "people /such as/ Virgil and Phil Taylor" (I have
no idea how people /like/ Phil Taylor would react, if indeed there are any
such people), then "making mischief for the workers on TL" would be the
very last thing I would do : my sole concern(s) throughout this over-
prolonged debate have been to try to ensure (a) that Virgil is not subjected
to sarcasm as a result of his suggestion, and (b) that his suggestion is
properly evaluated.  In the latter, at least, there has been progress :
it is now accepted that there would /not/ be an unacceptable performance
hit if Virgil's suggestion were adopted, whereas previously this was one
of the main bases for ridiculing his suggestion.

And if you would like to prevent further prolongation of this debate,
please consider avoiding /ad hominem/ attacks in any reply.

That was *NEVER* the case. The sarcasm started *after* he got decent
replies to his answer and still considered pushing this matter.

That was the reason sarcasm sprung forth, not the original request.

Hello, this morning I tried to run the latest version of tl2010 (test) on win32 (Vista).

Tex, latex, luatex, and lualatex seem to run without problems, but when I tried xetex or xelatex, I got a problem with xetex.pool. I am running from the same portable hard disk, which I connect via USB first to my linux box, where
Xelatex wuns without problems (see below).

When I connect the same hard disk to my windows portable, then I get the following behavior with
Xetex and xelatex (tex, latex, luatex, and lualatex do not show that problem).

Is that a problem on my system (I get it both on the DOS and the Cygwin command line), and, if yes, how can I fix it?

I checked that xetex.ch, xetex-latex3.ch and xetex-hz.ch
in my sourcces are the same as those in the repository.
However I didn't check that the formats can be shared
between other platforms. If they cannot be shared, it must
be my fault which I cannot fix, sorry.

Thanks,
Akira

[Sorry, for the cross-posting, but I wasn't sure which mailing list was more appropriate]

Hi, 

after downloading the latest MacTeX 2010 pretest, I noticed that xindy does some strange things. Sorting rules which have worked for me for years suddenly seem to have no effect.

For example, something like this which I use to sort book and film titles:

(merge-rule "The (.*)" "\1~,The" :again :bregexp)

This now has no visible effect on a entry of this kind:

\indexentry{\emph{The Black Cat}}{85}

This used to work and AFAICS the problem is with xindy.

Michel -- did you regenerate xetex.fmt?

I have no way to check anything on Windows, but running xetex story on
Unix works ok, after remaking xetex.fmt.  I put that fmt temporarily at
http://tug.org/~karl/xetex.fmt.gz so you can see if it works on your

The same as Michel here. It must be my fault.
I'll fix after the release if I get it.

so you can't, it seems, run lyx with the koma-script package scrbase.

this is a problem for lyx to correct, though you could make a latex
export of your document and compile it with pdflatex or whatever.

if the problem still occurrs with pdflatex, report it to the koma-script
error report address (i fear i don't know that, but it's probably
available on the web somewhere.

this is not (a priori) a tex live bug.  difficult to be sure whether
it's a lyx bug or a koma-script bug, though.

(lyx isn't part of tex live, and the tex live people regularly -- and
rightly imo -- refuse to debug packages.)

Well ... 

you are running
	platex
which is Japanese Publishing TeX Latex.

Maybe you mixed it up with
	pdflatex
????

Could it be that your lyx is configured to use platex instead of pdflatex?

I've fixed the problem. XeTeX is running here with your xetex.fmt.
I'll update xetex.exe after the release of TL2010
when it become allowed.

You are running
	platex
instead of
	xelatex
.... Don't you see that from the log file and terminal output:

platex/ptex does not have eTeX extensions, it is specifically for
JAPANESE!!! typesetting?!?!

Why don't you read my email?

xetex is NO other name of xelatex.

xetex is the program *and* the format based on plain.tex

xelatex is the format based on latex.ltx

Your problem is *SOLELY* based on the fact that you use platex
instead of xelatex ... why don't you try to fix that?

Is that a language problem? Do you need a translation of the explanations?

(Waiting for Phil to come after me again ....)

I understand the instructions, but when I try to put them into action, 
LyX will not let me configure it that way. I need output in Postscript, 
is that I need to print in book form with the leaves arranged for 
binding, and it will not let me in pdf, but in ps, and that's the 
problem. I return to texlive 2009 and sorry to be so stupid.

Thanks for the effort, and the counsel

Hi Miguel,

So I think you should try getting help on a Lyx-specific list or forum, see

http://www.lyx.org/MailingLists

I suggest your ask there why LyX is trying to use the "platex" command instead
of the regular "latex" command for compiling normal documents in DVI (hence PS)
modes, and how to set it up otherwise. As Norbert explained, this is clearly the
culprit here.

> I return to texlive 2009

Please don't. Instead, here is a (more or less random) idea about how to work
around the problem. If you don't need ptex, try uninstalling it (either using
tlmgr gui or, in command line: 'tlmgr remove --force ptex') then reconfigure Lyx
(menu tools -> reconfigure). Then platex won't be available anymore (as in the
TL2009 case) so we can hope Lyx will stop incorrectly trying to use it.

If it works, it would indicate the problem is due to a mis(auto)configuration of
Lyx, which is bound to hurt anyone installing TL2010 in the future, and should
really be reported and fixed on the Lyx side.

Manuel.

As an addendum: When I switch back to MacTeX 09 with the TeX Distribution prefpane, everything works just fine.

That's because an error has been fixed...

This used to work, but shouldn't, and that has been repaired.
It must be in the release notes, thanks for pointing this out.

:bregexp are `basic regexps', where parenthesis don't have special
meaning. Unqoted parenthesis as grouping expressions work only with
`extended regexps' a.k.a. :eregexp. This strange distinction of basic
and extended regexps had been introduced by the POSIX standard and is
rubish, IMHO. Almost all the time one wants to use those extended
regexps -- and that's why they are the default, too.

I.e., discard :bregexp from your merge rule and it will work as
intended.

Best,
	Joachim

That is all fine up to now, did it update anyting?

> What is the solution this problem?

What is the exact problem? There are probably no updates for TL2009,
if you have updated some time ago. 

TL2009 is frozen since quite some time, no updates are going into it
anymore.

So maybe all is fine.

Did you install the CTAN version or use the Ubuntu packages?

It would be useful for the record to see the versions of the
various programs you mention.

You might consider using TL2010.   It is quite possible that something
in Ubuntu 10.4 causes a problem in the 2009 tlmgr, but since the
developers are concentrating on TL2010, resolving such problems
may be a low priority.

The "unitialized variables" problem may prevent you from getting to
this stage, but
AFAIK, the gui and commandline versions use the same code to download the
packages.

aptitude is likely using different servers, protocols, and settings.
For me, aptitude
often fails when tlmgr is working, so there is very little reason to
think success with
aptitude implies success with tlmgr or vv.

Have you tried other CTAN servers?   You may have better luck using http.

As Norbert mentioned, there are no more updates to TL2009, so if you installed
it from the network (as opposed to a DVD or disk image), it is no real problem
that updates don't work. However, some of the warnings you get are intriguing.

Can you please give us the output of "tlmgr --version" and the version of the
gui as given by "Help -> About"?

This does not necessarily indicate a problem, unless followed by other error
messages. tlmgr is trying one method to connect to the server, this method
doesn't work, then it says it will be trying another one ("retrying with wget"
at the end of the quoted output). If the next method works, you'll see no other
message.

Not completely sure what OP is attempting, but there is a common
"use case" where user with limited internet access has to replace
a virused, broken, or stolen system that was using TL2009, starting
from a DVD, but knows they need updates released during the lifetime
of TL2009.

Someone in this position may have spent considerable time on the
upgrade treadmill (what with waiting for slow downloads) getting a TeX
installation that works for their multi-year project (think book).
Bad enough that the previous linux version won't run on the new
hardware -- all the apps have new versions with potentially new
bugs so they are faced with repeating a process they know will be
painful.   Note that a small minority of such users have backups,
but many of those find the backups aren't usable with the newer
hardware/OS.

CTAN TL has the advantage that one can just backup the texlive
tree (e.g., copy to DVD) and have a reasonably good chance that
it can be restored on a newer hardware/OS version, (or even a
different OS if they can find the appropriate binaries).

Honestly, I completely lost all my English, I didn't understand anything
you wanted to say here ... sorry.

To rephrase:

1)  the OP's problem (wanting a TL2009 with updates on a newly installed OS)
is not unique

2)  as you note, TL2010 is the only viable option going forward (I assume
TL2009 will soon disappear from the CTAN mirrors).

3)  for those who wish to avoid the OP's predicament, it is worth noting that
the design of CTAN TL does facilitate disaster recovery.   Those who
want to use a particular configuration would do well to make copies of the
TL tree (perhaps including binaries for several OS's if their disaster
recovery may involve a change in platform).   In particular, there may still
be some options for the OP if a colleague can provide a copy of a TL2009
tree (perhaps after adding the required architecture).

As George said, I have installed texlive from scratch.
Earlier, I had a fairly up to date installation of texlive 2009.
I have formatted my hard disk and installed texlive 2009, CTAN  DVD
version, not the Ubuntu version.  So, I know that updates do exist .
I have tried dante, cambridge and
default ctan site without any success.
This is the output I get when I run tlmgr --version command.

As George said, I have a few long running tasks and I am a bit wary of
updating to 2010 just now.

Executing action update
***************************************
The programme doesn't seem to be doing anything after the
last line.  There is not disk activity either.


George, how does one install from the backup?
Is it that, all you have to do is to put back the
links to the executables or does it involve anything more?
Aren't there any environment variables set by texlive that we
have to set by hand again?  Can you elaborate a bit?


Best,

Can you please do the following:

select one mirror by hand, say 
	http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/

then do
	tlmgr --repository YOUR_MIRROR --no-persistent-downloads update --list
If that does not work, then do the same again, but add
	-v -v
and send us the output captured to stdout and stderr:
	tlmgr ...arguments -v -v ... 2>&1 >tlmgr-debug.log
and send me that one.

It might be that at your place FTP protocol is blocked, so please 
try an http mirror!!

Thanks.

Best wishes

cambridge is probably your best bet, or utah (i _know_ cambridge has
lots of bandwidth, but i'm merely guessing from what i know of the place
about utah).

a pity that there's no registered mirror in india, but it does take
effort...

unfortunately your email address gives no indication of where you
actually are (it points at google), so i can't form an opinion of where
the bottleneck might be.

feel free to drop me a (private) line at ctan-uk at tex.ac.uk if you want
me to keep an eye on the logs when you try to connect to *.tex.ac.uk.

That is very strange. I can only assume that wget on your computer is
actually broekn.

Can you please type in the following on a shell prompt:

wget --user-agent=texlive/wget --tries=10 --timeout=900 http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet//tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz

ans see if that downloads something at all? Are there any error messages?

I have just tried to install TL2009. I did network install on x86_64
GNU/Linux (CentOS 5.3). After installation (it took approx 13 minutes)
tlmgr --version replied:
tlmgr revision 17811 (2010-04-12 06:05:03 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2009
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2009

Both "tlmgr update -self" and "tlmgr update -all" replied "no updates
available". I got no error message, everything worked.

Yes, but the OP said he installed from DVD and only updates tlmgr,
so there should be updates available.

ANd furthermore, tlmgr should not terminate always with
	Cannot load tlpdb ...

Well, updates did exist, but will likely be lost at TL2010 release.

Understandable, but unless you have some very specific needs,
it will be less painful to use the current 2010 version because
the developers are actively working to ensure that TL2010 works
properly, while problems with TL2009 are less likely to be
fixed (especially problems stemming from an OS that is newer
than 2009!).

It seems that you are not "close" to CTAN mirror site.   I was
in the same position until quite recently, when 1) a local
university created a mirror site, and 2) my office got a
direct connection to a research network.   With the old
setup I found network installs unworkable, so I created
a local mirror that was updated during off-peak hours.
If you are "close" to Ubuntu or Debian mirrors, you may
be better off using texlive as provided by a linux distro.

The design of CTAN TL means that if you have the disk
space you can easily have both a distribution texlive and
your own texlive (just don't use the symlinks option in CTAN
TL).    You can try:

sudo apt-get install texlive

I don't know how well the distro packages track updates, but
in the event of a problem you can file a bug with the distro.

Sure.  CTAN TL resides entirely in the tree you chose
(in your case, I recall seeing /opt/texlive/2009).   There is
an option to create symbolic links (e.g., in /usr/bin), but
you can add those after you have the TL tree.   I use this
routinely -- I do one install on linux for all the <archs> and
then copy the tree to each machine that will be running
TL.

If you have a backup of your old system, simply copy the
tree to the new system, e.g.,

sudo mkdir -p /opt/texlive
sudo chown <yourself>{<your group> /opt/texlive
rsync -a <backup location>/opt/texlive/2009/ /opt/texlive/2009/

If you want symbolic links, "tlmgr --help" mentions:

option
        sys_bin    (directory to which executables are linked by the
path action)
        sys_man    (directory to which man pages are linked by the path action)
        sys_info   (directory to which Info files are linked by the path action)

path [--w32mode=user|admin] [add|remove]

       On Unix adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages, and info
       pages in the directories specified by the respective options (see
       above).

Note that if you have TL2009 installed on a system with different <arch>,
you can add binaries for the new <arch>, copy the tree, and remove the
unwanted <arch> from both systems.   I prefer something like:

PATH="/opt/texlive/2009/bin/<arch>:$PATH"

because I can easily switch between, e.g., TL2009 and TL2010 pre-prelease
for testing, but this does create some difficulties with tools/packages
that require /usr/bin/<program>.

Some basic network troubleshooting is needed.  I would not be

15 hops from tex.ac.uk to him, which is quite moderate, imo.

it's sad (given that so much tex support comes from india, now) that
there's no indian ctan mirror.  there is at least one pakistani mirror,
and i wouldn't be surprised if mirror.ctan.org was routing him there.

when things really go pear-shaped like this, mirror.ctan doesn't help.

having said which, i don't see his ip in any of the logs i've looked at
so far, on tex.ac.uk

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

 

Recently I loaded the 2009 version of TeXLive in a Windows machine.
I wanted to also use the Y&Y mathtime fonts I own with this installation.

 

To do this, I need to add the mt-yy.map and mt-plus.map
files to the map files used by pdfTeX and dvips among others.

 

I tested by manually adding the entries to the files,
and everything worked well, but it's probably not the "correct" way

adding the font definitions.

 

According the information I could find this should be possible
by adding the definitions via the texmf-local area.

 

So I saved the mt-yy.map and mt-plus.map files in the
C:\texlive\texmf-local\web2c
area, and also added a updmap-local.cfg file in this location.



The updmap-local.cfg file contains the following two lines:

 

Map mt-yy.map
Map mt-plus.map

 

Then I booted the TeX Live Manager 2009,
pressed the "configuration" tab, and clicked the following three buttons in the following order:

 

- Re-initialize the database
- Re-create all formats
- Update font map database

 

Doing this allowed me to set up the paths to various other needed packages like
mathtime.sty and the mathtime font definition files located in the texmf-local
area.  That part worked nicely.  This action also refreshed the updmap.cfg files

and reset them back to their original state (removing my manually added modifications),
but it did NOT add the changes I put in the updmap-local.cfg file.

 

At this point I'm not sure why.

What did I miss?

In case anyone misunderstands my previous message,

I was not looking for changes in the updmap.cfg file

as a result of my additions in updmap-local.cfg,

but rather in files like pdftex.map and psfonts.map

in the texlive/2009/texmf-var/fonts/map... areas.

I am not sure *WHEN* this support was added, I assume it was
AFTER the initial tlmgr that went into the TL2009 release.

Please do the following in cmd.exe (dos box):
- tlmgr update --self --all
- tlmgr generate updmap

That should be enough to get everything working.

I tried cambridge mirror some time back, around 10.40AM, which means it is
around 5.10AM in
UK with the same result.

I also tried out the wget I have as part of the OS:
export http_proxy=http://190.10.40.250:8080/(Just o be sure.)
followed by
 wget
http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet//tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb.xz
with the same result.

Wait .. do you have some environment variable set to http_proxy?

This is a problem on your computer side. It seems that:
- either you have some env variable that asks for a proxy that does not work
- or port 80 outgoing is blocked (higly unlikely, but you never know)

We cannot do anything if you are working in an environment that prohibits
connection to the outside world.

None here can help you, please contact your local system administrator
how to contact port 80 of a remote server.

If you need some proxy and authentication at the proxy, I have no idea
if that is possible at allwith wget, but probably you can pass
some --user --password to wget.

If you manage in some way to get wget running, send us the working 
invocation (without the password if you need one) and we can tell you waht
to change.

Best wishes

Norbert

CLABBY (adj.)
A 'clabby' conversation is one stuck up by a commissionaire or
cleaning lady in order to avoid any further actual work. The opening
gambit is usually designed to provoke the maximum confusion, and
therefore the longest possible clabby conversation. It is vitally
important to learn the correct, or 'clixby' (q.v.), responses to a
clabby gambit, and not to get trapped by a 'ditherington' (q.v.). For
instance, if confronted with a clabby gambit such as 'Oh, mr Smith, I
didn't know you'd had your leg off', the ditherington response is 'I
haven't....' whereas the clixby is 'good.'

So you have a proxy server.  This opens all sorts of potential for
mischief.   The
Wikipedia entry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server> may be useful if
you aren't familiar with the possible problems associated with certain types of
proxy servers.

Have you discussed the problem with the person who manages the proxy server?
You may have to request that a CTAN mirror be enabled on the server.

Can you connect to any CTAN mirrors using a web browser?   Can you see the
mirror information at <http://www.dante.de/mirmon>?   Have you tried
ftp or rsync?

Since I couldn't update the texlive 2009
distribution in my laptop, I decided to have
a shot at my desktop. I still have jaunty jackalope,
ubuntu 9.04 on my desktop.  I had no network problems
whatsoever.
 tlmgr behaved well
and everything looks  perfect but for

I hope others can shed some light on the error, but it is good news that you
were able to get updates.    Do laptop and desktop use different networks,
or does this indicate a problem with the network on the laptop?   In any case,
all it takes is one system that can do updates and you can copy the TL tree
to other machines to bring them "up to date".   Even if you use the symbolic
links method on the laptop this will work, assuming you don't need a binary
that wasn't in the original install (in which case you might need to manually
create a missing link).

What do you get if you run the command:

"fmtutil-sys --byhyphen
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.def"

manually?   On my system (MacOSX) pdfetex and xetex fmts are generated.

No, you can safely ignore this message. We arranged for it not to be issued
anymore, since it is harmless, but the fix is in TL2010 only.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

If there is some consensus on this suggestion, I will try it when I get back home to my test machine.
I don't quite understand how a missing update is the culprit however since the advice about the
use of updmap-local.cfg was located in the updmap.cfg contained in the 2009 distribution.
As a result I would have thought that this "local" method of providing updates would have
Been well established and tested at that point.

With regard to the " tlmgr update --self --all" command, there is something else there that has been bugging me.
If I loaded my original install from F: (say) drive using a DVD, then the first thing this command will demand
is that the load disk should still be resident in that drive to recall the load database and refuse to proceed
if this disk is not resident. Why should this be necessary?  Once the load and install is done, why should the
updater need to refer back to the original install disk for reference?  I just find that strange and bothersome.
Perhaps there has been an earlier thread on this particular subject that I have nt read yet (I joined recently).

I am not sure *WHEN* this support was added, I assume it was
AFTER the initial tlmgr that went into the TL2009 release.

Please do the following in cmd.exe (dos box):
- tlmgr update --self --all
- tlmgr generate updmap

That should be enough to get everything working.

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

...so you are saying that for the "local" install to find the right files in the right places,
the "main" directory structure must be replicated in the "local" structure?

Again, I can try this when I get back to my test machine, but I'm not sure here.
Why wouldn't the install database be able to find them anywhere in the local area?
Does it look for different things in different places?
Is there any documentation I can read up on this about?

If so, which directory do the map files have to be located?
It's not obvious from which "main" directory the install picks them from.
There are a bunch of choices I can see that I could choose to replicate locally:

C:\texlive\2009\texmf\fonts\map\pdftex\updmap
C:\texlive\2009\texmf-dist\fonts\map\pdftex
or perhaps even
C:\texlive\2009\texmf-var\fonts\map\pdftex\updmap

The original skeleton of the C:\texlive\texmf-local\fonts...
does not contain this structure, and nowhere in the documentation
have I seen this advice with regard to the local map install.

But then on the other hand, I have not spent more than a day or so searching yet...

You must put the map files in .../texmf-local/fonts/maps/(possibly dvips/) or sub-dirctories thereof.

Howdy,

The short answer is YES, replicate the structure.

I usually put extra map files in sub-directories of .../texmf-local/fonts/map/dvips/ but that's out of habit, I assume .../texm-local/fonts/map/ would be fine too.

Good Luck,

For language.def???? There should be *always* be etex and pdfetex
in the installed system, however small it is.

What we fixed was a different error ... if you disable all formats of
an engine, the --by-engine would warn. But this is something different.

Because the default installation location is the one from where you installed.

You have to change that one to the internet update, like
	tlmgr option repository ctan
which will allow you to update TL2009, and the tlmgr.

Message-ID: <19539.38627.721308.584161@zaphod.ms25.net>

Hi,
a few days ago Rolf Niepraschk pointed me to

  http://wiki.github.com/bmatzelle/gow/

 > Gow (Gnu On Windows) is the lightweight alternative to Cygwin. It
 > uses a convenient Windows installer that installs about 130

I don't think it's an alternative to Cygwin.  Cygwin provides its own
runtime library which circumvents many bugs in msvcrt.dll and cmd.exe.
And Cygwin provides an X11 server which is needed by programs like
xdvi or xpdf.  There is still no alternative to Cygwin.

However, the Gow binaries are quite interesting if they are linked
statically.  If I don't misinterpret the description, they are.
Statically linked binaries are interesting because they are quite
useful for TeX Live.  Currently TeX Live depends on a statically
linked wget.exe and getnonfreefonts requires unzip.exe.

I don't have access to a Windows system and can't test anything
myself.  But I've seen that Gow provides the program "ln".  I'm
wondering what it does.  Does ln -s create a .lnk file?  This is what
Cygwin does and symlinks work like on Unix there.

Could anybody install Gow (at least the programs ln and ls) and tell
me whether this works:

  1. cd /path/to/texlive/20xx/bin/win32

  2. del pdflatex.exe

  3. ln -s pdftex.exe pdflatex.exe 

  4. pdflatex --version

?

And what is the result of "ls -l pdflatex"?  Do you see something like
"pdflatex -> pdftex"?

Don't be worried if it doesn't work.  You can always restore
pdflatex.exe: 

  cd /path/to/texlive/20xx/bin/win32
  copy /b pdftex.exe pdflatex.exe

BTW, I read somewhere that Vista provides "real" hard/symbolic links,
whatever this means.  But I assume that they depend on NTFS.  Thus,
they are not an option because USB sticks still use the dumb VFAT file
system.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes.  There are MS DOG line endings.  But it's not your fault.  It's
the smtp protocol which insists on MS DOG line breaks and your mail
program does the conversion if necessary.

Reinhard, I complained because in his emails there are ^M at the end
of every line, but not in any other email. 

The reason is that the first two emails were send in multipart/alternative
where the first part contained the text variant *WITH* ^M, but there
they should not be there. Or some message header like encoding is 
missing. Anyway, I don't care, I was just wondering about what MS is
sending out.

Best wishes

Nope: 'symbolic links are not supported on this system'. Cygwin's ln is 
playing slightly fast and loose (as it's not using features of the file 
system), whereas I assume that GOW is as far as possible not modifying 
the originals.

Indeed, NTFS provides 'junctions', which is what you've described. 
However, as you say this doesn't work on older file systems.

Junctions have been there since Windows 2000, but they can only be used with directories. Unix-style symbolic links are implemented since Windows Vista. Both are implemented on top of the reparse point facility. Hard links are supported since Windows 2000, too.

This is the output I got when I typed the
kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf command in a terminal.
**********************
/opt/texlive/2009/texmf-var/web2c/fmtutil.cnf
************************
Incidentally, I managed to update the texlive on my laptop
from my home where I use another ISP.
It upgraded around 645 packages.  But ,
in the end it gave the same error message and
said that the upgrade was unsuccessful.

Don't you need to re-run updmap-sys after that? Or run

tlmgr generate --rebuild-sys updmap

so that tlmgr does it for you.

As I said earlier, this message is perfectly harmless: it simply means you
didn't install any format that uses the hyphen file language.def.

That looks fine, and there are definitively formats that
depend on language.def, as for example:
> luatex luatex language.def luatex.ini
> dviluatex luatex language.def dviluatex.ini

So now the question: Do you use
	sudo
or
	su
or something similar?

Did you call
	kpsewhich fmtutil.cnf
as the user that runs fmtutil?

Otherwise I cannot understand what is wrong.

Wait,what is the output of
	which fmtutil

OF COURSE ALL AS THE USER THAT IS INVOKING THESE COMMANDS, so if you use
su/sudo then as *root*!!!!

Best wishes

ZEAL MONACHORUM (n.)
(Skiing term.) To ski with 'zeal monachorum' is to descend the top
three quarters of the mountain in a quivering blue funk, but on
arriving at the gentle bit just in front of the restaurant to whizz to
a stop like a victorious slalom-champion.

Subject: [tex-live] Bug report on fncychap.sty jul 2007
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1007301717210.19213@lyric.labma.ufrj.br>

I have updated my Ubuntu system.

On the texlive-latex-extra 2009-7ubunutu 3 package there is the

fncychap.sty  which is attached.

It does not work with the rest of the latex system.

So I search over the net and installed this fncychapleo.sty
which is also attached and make it work again.

I look throgh know bugs and did not find it.

All the best,
