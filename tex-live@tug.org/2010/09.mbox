Subject: [tex-live] Content shifted to the right
Message-ID: <05bd01cb497d$edf24b90$c9d6e2b0$@webkr.de>

Hi list,

I ran this simple tex file:
\special{papersize=80mm,32.5mm}
\parindent=0sp
\hbox to 80mm{
\hbox to 40mm{\vbox to 32.5mm{Hello left.\vfill}\hfill}
\hbox to 40mm{\vbox to 32.5mm{Hello right.\vfill}\hfill}
}
\bye

by the TeX Live command: 
tex label.tex && dvipdf label.dvi

and got the attached PDF.

I'd expect the "Hello left" starting at the very left border but the content
is shifted to the right. Where is my mistake?

Regards,
Andr?

* The TeX origin isn't in the left top corner, but
  1in to the right and 1in below the top.
* The line ends become spaces, effective inside \hbox.
  Cured by comment characters:
    \hbox to 80mm{%
      \hbox to 40mm{...}%
      ...%
    }%
* The paragraphs inside \vbox are set with width \hsize,
  causing overfull \hbox warnings, because the parent box
  is "\hbox to 40mm". Cured by \hsize=40mm

\special{papersize=80mm,32.5mm}
\parindent=0sp
\hsize=40mm
\hoffset=-1in
\voffset=-1in
\hbox to 80mm{%
  \hbox to 40mm{\vbox to 32.5mm{Hello left.\vfill}\hfill}%
  \hbox to 40mm{\vbox to 32.5mm{Hello right.\vfill}\hfill}%
}
\bye

I just found out that perl comes also with TeX Live 2009. But the executable
is named differently:

D:\>which perl
C:\msys\1.0\bin\perl.EXE

D:\>which perltex
C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32\perltex.EXE

D:\>

So, I think what's happening is,
when I run "mptopdf logo.1", my TeX Live installation calls perltex.
When perltex is running, it uses the PATH provided by MSYS for
MSYS's own perl.

So, if this is the case, how do I ask perltex not to use the PATH set by MSYS?

Best Regards,
BJ

Do you mean the PATH in ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile?
I don't have .bashrc or .profile in my msys home directory.
I don't usually run MSYS shell, and only occationally run gcc from
CMD.

If you meant something else, could you please give me a more
specific instruction?

As I wrote in another e-mail, I have two perl versions installed -- one
that came with MSYS, and another that came with TeX Live 2009.

The perl that came with MSYS is named "perl.EXE", and the one
that came with TeX Live is "perltex.EXE". If TeX Live needs perl, I suppose
it uses perltex. And, on my system, the path to TeX Live comes before
the path to MSYS.

So, what do I do now?

That is not the perl executable, but a utility for
the perltex package ( a wrapper which calls the actual perl ).
TeX Live 2009 comes with perl, but it is hidden and not
on the PATH.

No, I meant
    echo %PATH%
in cmd.exe. You can set it with
    set PATH=<copy everything from the previous answer but msys-related tools>
(if I'm not mistaken).

mptopdf is not aware of TeX Live's perl installation (even though it
should probably not be too difficult to make it aware of it; I have no
idea how perl in TL works though).

Maybe you could find perl somewhere under tlpkg/tlperl.straw/bin/ (or
something similar). The fastest way to check what happens if you add
that into PATH (under cmd.exe) before anything else, so something like
    set PATH=C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\tlperl.straw\bin;%PATH%
but you need to check for details (if that path exists and if the
syntax is right).

It turn out that it is not possible to use mdfga in latex+dvips+ps2pdf mode because the PostScript names of the fonts distributed in mdfga.map are incorrect. The fix is to make the following replacements.

FSGaramondSmallCaps-Bold    ==> FSGaramondSmCaps-Bold
FSGaramond-Regular          ==> FSGaramond
FSGaramondSmallCaps-Regular ==> FSGaramondSmCaps
FSGaramondExpert-Regular    ==> FSGaramondExpert

so that the contents of mdfga.map reads, after correction,

fgab8y FSGaramond-Bold "TeXnANSIEncoding ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <fgab8a.pfb
fgabo8y  FSGaramond-Bold "0.194 SlantFont TeXnANSIEncoding ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <fgab8a.pfb

Hi!

I would like to thank you guys for your patient and kind help with my problem.
Unfortunately, I cannot afford to spend more time on this at the moment
(some deadlines coming up, etc), and decided to shelve it for now.

So, I uninstalled MSYS, and mptopdf works fine. Probably, I will have to
reinstall MSYS (or cygwin, which I am even less familar with) in the future.

I am sorry for not being able to return your favor by solving and sharing
the solution.

Best Regards,
BJ

PS.
Mojca, yes you are right. There is C:\texlive\2009\tlperl\bin\perl.exe.

Hi Taco,

First of all, thank you for your work in the tex and metapost field !

I have with Texlive 2009 the following issue. I beg your pardon to 
bother you with that !

I don't manage to have a live metapost session. Look at this :

$ mpost -mem=mpost
This is MetaPost, version 1.208 (kpathsea version 5.0.0)
**
Please type the name of your input file.
**mpost.mem
! I can't find file `mpost.mem'.
<*> mpost.mem

Please type another input file name: mpost

(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/metapost/base/plain.mp

I tried mpost "&mpost", mpost -mem=mpost, no possibility to have a live 
session. However the command mpost -mem=mpost foo.mp functions.

What can I do ?

Sincerely yours,

G?rard.

Type a single backslash here, followed by enter. Or put
a backslash (suitably escaped for your shell) at then end
of the command line, like this:

   $ mpost \\

Because $EDITOR is set to emacs. If you don't want to start
an editor, don't answer TeX's error prompt with 'E'.

Yes, I know that E invokes an editor; my question was "Why Emacs" ?

This is Windows, for ***'s sake : maybe WinEDT, maybe TeXshop,
maybe EDT+, or even Notepad or Wordpad, but never Emacs ...

i've never used "e" in 2.5 decades of tex usage.   when i'm developing,
i've always got an editor open (in the background, in the days of glass
ttys).

so my hypothesis is that you're seeing a hang over from a time when
web2c was a un*x only setup.  remember, the author of web2c was closely
associated with the gnu project (other people might have chosen vi, but
not i).

since it's such a rare facility to use, it was forgotten in the move to
widnoze.  (of course, some of us use emacs under widnoze, too, but i
imagine we're a minority.)

kpsewhich --var-value=TEXEDIT

The default value of the variable is set in texmf.cnf.
emacs was my choice, since I thought emacs was widely
used also on windows.

I was wrong. TEXEDIT is not defined in texmf.cnf in TL2010.
Therefore the hard coded EDITOR, which is emacs, is used.
If TEXEDIT etc. are defined in texmf.cnf, they are prefered.

Akira

a future release (TL2011+) you might be willing
to consider making the default an editor that can
reasonably be  expected to exist in a normal Windows
installation (Emacs is pretty "niche" in the Windows
world, as I'm sure you realise).

Hi Phil,
I don't think it makes much sense.  The point is that you never should
rely on compile-time defaults.  TEXEDIT is a per-user variable and
should always be set it the environment of a particular user.  In
texmf.cnf this variable is deliberately not set for this reason and
because there is only one texmf.cnf for all platforms.

Another question is which editor should be the default on Windows.
The one *you* think is best for Windows users?  There are so many
different ones and most Windows users have never seen anything else
but TeXniccenter.  Should this be the default?

It's quite common, especially on Windows, that people run TeX from
their editor or IDE in batchmode, hence they never encounter a
situation where they can start an editor during a TeX run.  I can only
confirm what Robin already said.

The compile-time defaults are what developers use for testing their
code.  They are not meant for end users.  When I unset $TEXEDIT, then
pdftex starts vi, which isn't surprising because Vim is Thanh's
favourite editor.  And for testing code on many platforms you need an
editor which runs on all of them.  emacs and vi are good choices.

I recommend not to change these defaults for Windows.  Sorry Phil, but
Akira is not the author of these programs.  If his build environment
can be improved in order to produce binaries which are closer to what
Windows users expect, it's fine.  If he optimizes the many Windows
specific programs written by himself or by Fabrice, it's fine too.

But patching programs written by others is always quite problematic.
You have to make sure that your patches don't break anything whenever
you compile a new release.  This is quite painful and I really hope
that Akira can compile all these programs on Windows without modifying
the sources too much.

Since TEXEDIT has to be set by end users (if they really need it at
all), I don't think there is any good reason to make the build process
more complex as it already is.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No. TeXniccenter is widespread but certainly not suitable as a
default. If you want to set a default, you should at my opinion use
like miktex as default the standard editor of windows, notepad.exe.
And perhaps add in texmf.cnf some examples how to change this
default to something more useful.

OK, let me stop [you] there -- all that seems fine, /but/ :

1) The TeXlive Installer does not ask the user which editor
    he or she prefers to use (I think it should), and

2) In the absence of any editor being specified, the default
    action of the binary should be to report "No editor
    specified : please set TEXEDIT and re-run".

Both of these are IMHO, of course.  But there /may/, of course,
be security risks associated with executing an arbitrary piece
of code that just happens to be called "Emacs.exe", "Emacs.bat"
or whatever, as the calling code has no way of knowing whether
this is "real" Emacs or some nasty Trojan horse ...

Many many people use "E", entirely accidentally, thinking
that it is "E" for "Exit", not "E" for "Edit".  When they
do so, the last think they will expect under Windows is
to be told that Emacs is not in their path.  And what
(as I suggested earlier) if there /is/ an "Emacs" in
their path, but it is (e.g.) a Trojan horse ?  A simple
user error ("E" for "Exit" rather than "E" for "Edit")
should not lead to the execution of an arbitrary program
or script of which the user may well be completely unaware.

Bear in mind as well that when Don designed the user
interface for error handline, he did not give much
thought to the more common semantics of some of the
commands he chose :

	Don : "E" for "Edit"
	Almost all other software : "E" for "Exit"

	Don : "Q" for "Quiet"
	Almost all other software : "Q" for "Quit"

Thus it is vital to take /safe/ action when a user
specifies one of these, not potentially disastrous
action such as launching a binary over which one has
no control and of the contents of which one has no
knowledge.

No, in CUA, File/Exit is accessed by Alf-F followed by X, I have never
seen E (and I still sometimes use Windows and used OS/2 for a long
time, CUA and CORBA were designed by Microsoft and IBM in cooperation,
possibly together with other vendors)

Now quite a lot of programs use Ctrl-Q, even in Linux.

Unlike the cmd.exe, calledit does not execute emacs.exe or emacs.bat
in the current directory if "." is not in the PATH, which is
satisfied in most cases on windows.
It is a users responsibility to take care of the PATH.

Hi there,

saturn5.avi, no matter which permissions it has, cannot be found by

The same, because it doesn't complain a missing `saturn5.avi'.
It also needs the player `player_flv_maxi.swf', but that
file is installed in
  TDS:doc/latex/flashmovie/player_flv_maxi.swf
In this location it isn't found by pdfTeX, therefore it should
be moved to
  TDS:tex/latex/flashmovie/player_flv_maxi.swf

E for Exit??? That I have never ever seen in any program,
please tell me which funny one is using this shortcut?

For the trojan, see Akira's answer.

You could tell us a bit more about your setup.
It seems you are not using normal TeX Live, but
some distributors package, but I might be wrong.

Send us the output of
	which pdftex
and
	pdftex --version

Subject: [tex-live] question about archive naming scheme
Message-ID: <20100909092623.GA7076@hunyadi.local>

Greetings!

I have a serious question about the archive naming scheme of tex package
archives: 
 Why do they lack any hint to the version of the package contained in
 the archive? This make packaging the software a painful expreience. Or
 more specifically: distributing the software in a source-based software
 distribution environment, such as pkgsrc, as the sources referenced in
 "recepies" are called the same way, but contain a different version,
 and have different checksums. It is easy to see, that such automated
 software distribution systems need to provide the authenticity of the
 sources (for the sake of security), and the apropriate versions, known
 to work (for the sake of stability). Therefore I'd kinly ask you, to
 tell me a way to obtain tex archives from past versions, and, possibly
 i'd like to as ou to consider changing the archive distribution to a
 way (possibly reverse compatible with the current scheme, so _also_)
	offering a way to be able to choose from multiple versions of the
	tex packages.
I must also emphasise, that this does not only affect NetBSD (or other
		systems using pkgsrc) but also affects gentoo, and other source
based distributions.

Yours Sincerely: G?bor Gergely
                       (an unhappy LaTeX user, as cannot get TeX working
						on NetBSD)

Because this information is in the accompanying texlive.tlpdb, as well as in the tlpobj file in the archive.

File names don't give any guarantee.

I'm packaging TeX Live now since five years, of course it is not easy, but not out of the reason you state.

md5 sums are also in the texlive.tlpd

I recommend to read all the documentation before complaining, the structure is fully documented, and we are distributing since some years now in this way without probkems derived from our namin scheme.

Enjoy

Message-ID: <201009092241.o89MfjTj015484@f7.net>

We've gone ahead with the network release of TeX Live 2010.  It is now
or will be soon available from CTAN sites
(http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive).  As with last year, we
recommend doing a network install in one way or another instead of
downloading the large (2gb) ISO -- http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

Package updates will start propagating in another day or two.

If anyone notices stale or missing information on the TL web pages, or
problems with the release, please report as usual.

MacTeX 2010 has also been released and is available from CTAN.  Its web
pages will be updated soon.

The TeX Collection DVD will be released as soon as possible; hopefully,
it will go out in October.  Issues with it (unrelated to TL) made me
decide it was not desirable to delay the TL release any longer.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

P.S. RobinF, can you resend this announcement to ctan-ann, please?

Dear TL developers,

First: thank you all for your great work preparing TeXlive!!!
Second: could you please remove "2009" in the first line from the file
install-tl-20100909/readme-html.dir/readme.de.html?

I was very disappointed when I saw that the german release is still for
2009 ;-)

The tug.org pages are usually updated last when all CTAN mirrors have
been provided with the new release.

Thx from me, too, to all contributors to the new version.

Howdy,

Just got the first updates to TL-2010 via tlmgr (well, TeX Live Utility via tlmgr) and biblatex.sty seems to be broken. It requires logreq.sty which doesn't seem to exist in TL-2010 although it is available from CTAN.

I prefer to let one of the many people here who know German make a new

Here is a changed file.
I have removed 2009, 2008 and changed 
	... finden Sie die deutsche Anleitung im Verzeichnisbaum
texmf/doc/texlive/texlive-en 
to

Hi,

 

I've just installed TL2010 and found something wrong with fontspec(?) and
verbatim* env.

 

Test code:

 

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fontspec}

\begin{document}

 

\begin{verbatim*}

abc def

\end{verbatim*}

 

\end{document}

 

Compile with XeLaTeX, it can't stop.

 

It seems a problem about fontspec package. But I'm not sure. Could anyone
help?

Howdy,

Looks like we have to wait for the fontspec 2.0c update to come through.

He meant the update _to_ 2.0c. You get the error with 2.0b, 2.0c
works fine. Miktex has already updated to 2.0c.

(Thanks for CC-ing me on this; I'm not following the TL list at the moment.)

No plans so far on post-2.0c versions. There's been a couple of minor documentation updates since v2.0c was posted on CTAN.

My TL2010 pretest distribution contains v2.0b; I just updated my mirror URL to  
  <http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet>  
and I'm not currently seeing v2.0c available through tlmgr.

But I'm sure it will appear soon enough :)

<embarrassed>hadn't thought of that</embarrassed>.

i had forgotten i had a modest bunch of tl updates overnight, and (of
course) fontspec was one of them.  i had merely remembered that it was
more than 24hours since i got tl 2010 onto ctan.

amusingly, warwick pulled a copy of fontspec from cambridge within
seconds of cambridge grabbing it from the source directory.

warwick's few seconds, though, were enough for it to pick up the 2.0b
version.

Subject: [tex-live] simple question on upgrading TL2010 from beta
Message-ID: <4C8BC097.6040205@web.de>

Hi there,

after reading the documentation, I guessed that the best way to upgrade 
TL2010 from beta was to run as root:

tlmgr show fontspec repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

But it doesn't seem to work.

My question might be be extremely simple, but I don't know how to change 
the repository and to update TL2010 beta.

Which is the right way to do this?

Thanks for your help,


Pablo

Hi Pablo,

I guess you are using Linux. So try

"sudo tlmgr option repository URL"

Whereas URL needs to be replaced by the server url of your choice. After 
that you repository is set to the new url.
Then you can run "sudo tlmgr update --self" and "sudo tlmgr update --all".

Regards
Fadi

Where did you get the "show fontspec" from?  The correct command is mentioned in tlmgr's manpage:

tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

I just spend some time looking for any information on how to upgrade
from 2009 -> 2010 starting at http://www.tug.org/texlive/ . IF that's
supported, could it please be made more prominent in the
documentation (like mentioning it in the Readme)? Pretty please?

Thanks for your help, Philipp (and to others who replied).

I replaced ?option? with ?show fontspec? because I thought ?option? was 
to be replaced with a real option.

Thanks again,

It is not supported, it was never announced, it was mentioned as
a possible option, but nobody came around to program it.

Should we announce everything we didn't do?

In reality for those adventureous in the archives you will find an
explanation how to do it. It is not so hard, requires a bit of editing
of the texlive.tlpdb. That's it. But don't kill me if afterwards things
don't work out.

It is simply that nobody had time (esp me) to program a perl script that:
- makes a copy of the whole tree
- changes the relevant setting in the tlpdb
- changes whatever else (ni idea actually anymore)

Esp because doing that on Windows requires more work, like
	tlmgr postaction path remove
....

Upgrading from an old release to a new release is something many people
(especially ones not familiar with internal of texlive) would expect, so
I think it is important to document the lack of such option.

And how one would know it is not present when he would, naturally,
expect it?

Some one installed texlive2009, now texlive2010 is released and he is
wondering how to upgrade, reading the docs, but it is talking about
fresh install so he thinks "no, that is not what I want, I already have
2009 release, I need to just upgrade", so he starts googling, nothing,
time to join ask texlive list and ask. So by documenting this you are
saving your and your user's time.

(and this scenario already happened, it is not fictional).

Hi Fadi,

I haven't seen your message before since my mailbox doesn't put messages 
from unknown recipients in the inbox folder.

Many thanks for your help.

BTW, sudo seems to be the standard way to access to root privileges, but 
in Fedora I log in as root.

Thanks again,


Pablo

You don't need root privileges to install texlive, you just need
read/write permissions on the destination directory.

Thanks for bringing this up. I'm in that exact situation.

I installed TL2009 a few weeks ago, saw the messages about TL2010, but
have so far done nothing about it because the message trail so far seems
to suggest that the wise course of action would be to wait until things
stabilize a little bit (particularly if one is fairly new to this whole
process).

In due course I'll be wanting to upgrade, and will be hoping that the
procedure is relatively straightforward (and documented). (I've not
looked yet, so I'm not assuming otherwise at this point.)

There are major changes in the engines used with .tex documents,
so I expect stability may be a few years away.   If you rely on TeX,
you should plan to spend some time checking that they work with
the newer engines (xetex and luatex) -- if there are problems it is
better to discover them now than at some time in the future when
older engines are no longer available.

If you install the CTAN version (as opposed to a version packaged
by your linux distro) and do not create symbolic links when you
install, then you can switch between TL2009 and TL2010 by
adjusting the PATH variable.   Given that disk is very cheap this
is worthwhile insurance in case some of your documents encounter
problems with the new version.

Sorry for being off-topic, I'm not sure which tug mailing list is proper
for such discussion, so I opted for the one I'm already subscribed to.

There are few TeX centered blogs, and blogs for people involved with TeX
related developments who occasionally blog about TeX. I was wondering if
it is a good idea to have a blog aggregator (AKA planet) to aggregate
TeX related blog posts, which people interested in such material can
subscribe to instead of hunting TeX blogs around the web.

Blogs are usually bit relaxed than formal documentations and release
announcements, and can give people more insights about the internal of
development and so.

What do you think?

Regards,
 Khaled

Howdy,

Ran tlmgr (via TeX Live Utility on the Mac)

Today logreq came over as a new install so biblatex works again. Thanks for the quick response.

I also got an update to fontspec but it turned out to still be 2.0b while the latest version on CTAN is 2.0c which fixes a problem with visible spaces in verbatim* environments.

Good Luck,

what mirror do you use as repository?

the tl fontspec update was on ctan 0200-ish (uk time) yesterday, and
even allowing for the delay getting to dante.ctan or tug.ctan, it really
ought to be on mirrors by now.

we tend to remove mirrors from the list, if they're consistently >1day

Howdy,

More information:

If I run

tlmgr show fontspec

I get

package:     fontspec
category:    Package
shortdesc:   Advanced font selection in XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.
longdesc:    Fontspec is a package for XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX. It provides an automatic and unified interface to feature-rich AAT and OpenType fonts through the NFSS in LaTeX running on XeTeX or LuaTeX engines.
installed:   Yes
revision:    19649
cat-version: v2.0c
cat-date:    2010-08-01 19:08:30 +0200
cat-license: lppl1.3
collection:  collection-xetex

so the database is showing the correct version but if I actually check the fontspec version directly I get 2.0b. Could tlmgr have actually not updated the files?

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

I'm in the same situation.  I tried "remove -force" and then "install":

$ tlmgr --repo http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
remove --force fontspec
tlmgr: fontspec is needed by collection-xetex unicode-math
tlmgr: removing it anyway, due to --force
remove fontspec
tlmgr: actually removed these packages: fontspec
tlmgr: package log updated at /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log

and still have 0.2b files with the databse showing 0.2c.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 2010 distribution bug?
Message-ID: <D029592F-6E67-4672-A171-E447F2486B36@verizon.net>

Hello,

I'm not really qualified to say if this is a bug or not (but it was certainly confusing to me) so I'll call it a story about my first experiences with TeXLive 2010.  :-)  After having used the 2009 distribution for several weeks, I saw the 2010 release was out. I downloaded and ran the Internet based installer for intel Cygwin systems. It installed just fine, but the FMT files were not generated properly, which prevented several commands, including xelatex from working. 

The errors generated were about being unable to find the following files:

loadhyph-hy.tex
hyph-hy.tex
loadhyph-en-us.tex
hyph-en-us.tex
loadhyph-lo.tex
hyph-lo.tex

I was able to correct the problem by downloading these files from CTAN and placing them in texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns and loadhyph.  I also had to run the command "texconfig rehash" and then "fmtutil-sys --all" to generate the FMT files. 

After these steps, my TeXLive distribution appeared to work fine.  It sort of smells like a distribution problem to me, and since the distro is pretty new, I though there was a chance it might not be my fault.  I hope this is enough information to investigate. I do not need a response, and if you're unable to reproduce the problem, it's probably something to do with my system, which already has two copies of the 2009 release. 

Along similar lines, my files that worked correctly under the 2009 distro now generate errors like:

LaTeX Error: Command \nobreakspace unavailable in encoding EU1.

Some earlier discussion on the list led me to believe that this was a reasonable workaround:

\renewcommand{\nobreakspace}{\nobreak\ }

But to be perfectly honest, I don't much understand either the error or the true implications of the workaround.  There seems to be debate about the width of the various Unicode spaces and how to map them into TeX. 

Again, I mention it mostly because I expect lots of folks to have LaTeX files with tildes in them, and I'm skeptical that the upgrade to the 2010 distro should break them. 

This message was intended to be useful to you and others rather than seeking assistance, so please respond (or not) accordingly. 

Cory

It seems that something went wrong with the last update of fontspec in
the TL repository.  There is still version 2.0b.

And these files havent been there in the first place?

Can you type
	tlmgr show hyph-utf8

and probably
	tlmgr check all
and send us the output?

I don't think anything went wrong, just didn't get to that update yet.

I updated fontspec just now, should start on its rounds tonight.

The reason I assumed that something went wrong is this:

$ tlmgr update --self --all
[....]
[13/60, 05:11/36:41] update: fontspec [2763k] (19458 -> 19649) ... done

and then:

$ tlmgr show fontspec
[....]
revision:    19649
cat-version: v2.0c
cat-date:    2010-08-01 19:08:30 +0200

Where does this come from if in the repo there is v2.0b, rev. 19458,
from 2010-07-15 ?

  Reinhard

Hello Norbert,

Sorry if this message breaks your threading on the list, I couldn't cut 
and paste the answers you needed into my iPhone, and my email 
environment is slightly dysfunctional right now.

While debugging this problem on my own, I ran both tlmgr check all, and 
a command to check my configuration.  I happen to have both of those 
output files from earlier, and I have attached them. I also issued the 
new command you requested:

$ tlmgr show hyph-utf8
package:     hyph-utf8
category:    Package
shortdesc:   Hyphenation patterns expressed in UTF-8.
longdesc:    Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need 
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems require 
hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font in use (such 
encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with names like OT1, T2A, 
TS1, OML, LY1, etc). The present package offers a collection of 
conversions of existing patterns to UTF- 8 format, together with 
converters for use with 8-bit fonts in older systems. Since hyphenation 
patterns for TeX are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the 
UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant the 
older patterns.
installed:   Yes
revision:    18895
cat-date:    2010-06-01 11:48:39 +0200

Hopefully this helps.

Cory

So you are installing TeX Live 2010 and running TeX Live 2009?

You probably did not adjust the path, or installed into a strange 
directory.

Please *READ* the install instructions before installing.

Where did you install TL2010 to (which directory)?

You have to adjust your PATH environment to run 2010!

No I'm using 2009, not 2010. The package is:

http://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-text/texlive-core

where the ebuild is:

http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/app-text/texlive-core/texlive-core-2009-r2.ebuild?view=markup

Texlive is installed into /usr/share/texmf and /usr/share/texmf-dist

The texmf.cnf contains these lines(with other lines not included here)

+TEXMFMAIN = /usr/share/texmf
+TEXMFDIST =/usr/share/texmf-dist
+TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf

Ok, forget my remark, I mixed it with a different request.

I have no idea why this font is missing, but I see that in Debian
we have these formats disabled.

Here someone from the cyrillic community should respond, I don't know
the details of that.

I see that several packages seem to have been mis-installed, but we
never had any report on that.

I would suggest doing
	tlmgr install --reinstall \
		hyph-utf8 eso-pic euenc dvipng overpic luatex mdframed \
		flashmovie expl3 pst-node
(these are all the packages with files mentioned in the output of
tlmgr check missing files)

These are probably from your own installation.

Why this happened is hard to say, low disk space? Windows stupidity?
No idea ...

Thanks for looking at this.  It sounds like it is something about my environment that is to blame.  My best guess is something related to the multiple installs of TeXLive 2009.

For a while (possibly during the 2010 install) had a weird configuration, including such stupidity as the native windows installation being in my path in Cygwin. Which sort of works, but not completely. 

Anyway, if you doubt that it is a bug in the distro, please don't worry about it anymore. I'll just reinstall those packages an move on. 

Thanks again,
Cory

since you don't say which repository you're using, or whether the
problem was resolved when you re-ran the update, it's not possible to
judge the significance of your report.

fwiw, my site injected an update of both into the ctan system during
last night.  which should not be read as a claim that i have the
slightest idea what goes on after that event.

I just did a fresh install in Cygwin a few days ago with no problem, so 
I don't think it's a bug in the distro.

    Here someone from the cyrillic community should respond, I don't know
    the details of that.

I think the bug report should be sent to Gentoo.  These are precisely
the areas in which distros modify the original TL in ways we know
nothing about.

For myself, running mktextfm lhr10 on an unmodified TL'10 install (the
original problem) works just fine.

Message-ID: <0F421F8F-54B2-4CBA-8514-DCC400F44CC4@mac.com>

Would it be possible for tlmgr list to work even if the package repository version does not match?  I thought there was a local copy of the database that was sufficient for this purpose.  The idea is that some actions (list, show) are useful even if you're not using the latest version of TL.  As it is, I need to tell TeX Live Utility users that the program is basically non-functional unless they install TL 2010, so I'm working on an update that will give users some less-cryptic feedback on the version mismatch.

$ tlmgr --version

It does, add
	--only-installed
as option and it will not load the remote database.

Yes, but by now the local copy has been replaced with the copy of TL2010 
so it will not work.

>  The idea is that some actions (list, show) are useful even if you're not using the latest version of TL.

Yes, for list we have --only-installed, as you cannot add packages anyway.

For show it already only accesses the remote db if you try to list a not 
installed package.

So to solve the problems I see only one way for now:
- for 2009 you should update TLU to use --only-installed
- for 2010 I can change tlmgr so that if loading the remote tlpdb in 
action_list fails, we fall back to --only-installed

WDYT?

Best

Installing from MacTeX image and  to another computer and then
updating first ONLY geometry did not bring any error, but updating
then ONLY pdftex-def brought it. So it is pdftex-def

It's fixed in 0.05b:
  ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/pdftex-def/pdftex.def
In the night it's mirrored to CTAN and then to TeX Live AFAIK.

Well, I'm an idiot for sure...I'm actually using that in my code when no network is available.  Maybe that's why it seems that we've had this conversation before :).

That fallback would be nifty, but --only-installed is exactly what I was looking for.  

Now I just have to make sure my repository version checking is robust enough and called in the right places, so I can disable the right parts of the UI.  I'm looking for a line like "depend release/2010" after 00texlive.config.

thanks!

Hello,

I get an error while using bibtex (bibtopic and gloss)
and makeindex.

D:\mydocs\tmp\document.1.blg: Forbidden to open for writing
I couldn't open file name `D:\mydocs\tmp\document.1.blg'

I get this error if  write18/shell-escape are enabled or not.

btw: with miktex I don't get this error, using the same
command-sequences as within Tex-Live 2010
And that error doesn't apperas with TeX-Live 2009
But can't remember if I made additional modifications
to kpathsea in TL 2009.

Do I have to set additional options to kpathsea?

btw: the resulting pdf seems to be ok, but the error message is new.

T.

Hi,

I just run "tlmgr update --all" on my pristine tl2010 installation with backups enabled:

  $ tlmgr option | grep backup
  Number of backups to keep (autobackup): 1
  Directory for backups (backupdir): tlpkg/backups

  $ tlmgr: package repository /media/TEXLIVE/2010/tug.org/texlive/tlnet
  tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/backups

  [4/127, 00:10/04:50] update: Type1fonts [516k] (15878 -> 19603) ... done
  ...

and now I notice that there are no backup files for antp and biblatex-chicago-notes-df :-(

  $ ll /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/backups/antp*
  ls: cannot access /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/backups/antp*: No such file or directory
  $ ll /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/backups/biblatex-chicago-notes-df*
  ls: cannot access /usr/local/texlive/2010/tlpkg/backups/biblatex-chicago-notes-df*: No such file or directory

IMHO the backup should contain those deleted packages too.

I remember seeing such errors from TeXnicCenter. Replacing in the
build profiles "%bm" with "%tm" for the bibtex/makeindex argument
fixed it i.e. just the filename instead of an absolute path.

Subject: [tex-live] TeX4ht does not work properly with default TeXLive
	Windows install (solved)
Message-ID: <A457AE0EC669934B985DC973A9B1B16D040E6D77@EVS3.aecl.ca>

UNRESTRICTED | ILLIMIT?

Summary of problem:

After installing TeXLive 2009 and running htlatex on a windows
system, TeX4ht did not generate any png files.

Solution:

After some debugging, the problem was that TeX4ht needed to use the
"convert" utility which is installed by default on most
linux/unix operating systems. On Windows systems, "convert"
means convert from fat32 to ntfs disc mount. A way of
correcting this is to install ImageMagic for Windows, and also
install a modern version of ghostscript that can convert ps to
png and also make sure that both are in the path. So, this is
one solution to this problem.

After more discussion it turns out that a hidden version of
ghostscript is installed with TeXLive that could be used by
TeX4ht to generate the png files. instead of ImageMagic + gs

It involved making a simple to TeX4ht.env

I added the new change to the TeXLive 2009 install on my
machine and tested it to death. Other than an occasional
hiccup while producing between 2500 and 10,000 sequential
png files, possibly due to an error condition generated
due to system load (?), everthing worked perfectly.

The change was made by Akira Kakuto, and Reinhard
Kotucha let me know about it. 

In fact, using gs to do the conversion produces png files
 that are often less than half the size of those produced
by ImageMagic! I asked about this, and Reinhard said
this is normal. In fact, it has been shown that gs
sometimes produces png files that are very much smaller than
ImageMagic.

The file that was changed was

C:\texlive\2009\texmf-dist\tex4ht\base\win32\tex4ht.env

I have included a copy.
In case it has not been doen already, can this be added
to the latest distribution please?

Thanks to all those who helped me resolve this problem.

Thomas

It's in TeX Live 2010 already.  But there is a tiny difference: Since
tex4ht is always invoked by wrappers on Windows, gswin32.exe is
already in %PATH%.  Thus, Akira replaced rungs by gswin32c again in
tex4ht.env.

It doesn't make any difference unless you launch tex4ht.exe directly.

Regards, and thanks for testing it thoroughly,
  Reinhard

ant is now obsolete (also on CTAN), and replaced by "poltawski", thus was
removed. biblatex-chicago-notes-df was replaced by 
"biblatex-chicago".

it's not about *why* those packages got removed/changed but how to 
revert to an older version for whatever reason... (I thought that's 
what a backup should be good for).

if for whatever reason someone depends on the old version of the 
Antykwa P??tawskiego fonts he can't just step back to the last backup now.

Howdy,

For TL-2010 tlmgr has autobackup set to 1 by default. I'm not sure if it was set to 0 or didn't even exist for TL-2009. Is error recovery from a bad download, or other problem, when installing an update to a package effected if I set autobackup to 0? With TL-2009 there were a few times when there was a faulty download and the old version was restored.

Hi Staszek,
weren't you the first one who asked Norbert to provide backups?  I
thought that the initial idea was to provide a mechanism which allows
to revert to an older version of a particular package if a newer
version is broken.  Thus, if you regard older versions as obsolete, we
don't need backups at all.

You said that "antp" was replaced by "poltawski" on CTAN.  But there
is no way to find this out automatically.  From tlmgr's viewpoint
"antp" was removed and "poltawski" is a new package.

Assuming that backups are useful at all, in the first place they
should be kept/created whenever packages are removed.  Some people are
concerned that packages can be removed due to license issues.

I'm not absolutely convinced that backups are useful at all, but if
they are supported, they should work as expected, at least.   

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thank you for your tip. That's the reason.
I could fix this by setting:

openout_any = r

in the top-level texmf.cnf file.

openout_any = a

schould work too. ;-)

But had no success to set the environment var like:

set TEXMFOUTPUT=%CD%\tmp;
or
set TEXMFOUTPUT=D:/mydoc/tmp;

and a relative path doesn't work either. E.g.
set TEXMFOUTPUT=./tmp;

Does anybody knows the right syntax?
Because I would prefer to set it in a script.

T.

there is, in principle, in the sense that the antp stuff now appears on
ctan:obsolete/, and its catalogue entry and poltawski's document what
happened.

such changes are sufficiently rare that we've not had pressure to
provide an package attribute in the catalogue, that records it.

we could, but these things take a *long* time, given our part-time style
of desultory discussion.  :-(

I understand and share the feelings of the author of the original
post: When package is removed the user feels hi/herself robbed,
deprived and cheated even if he/she never used, never intended to use
and had no slightest idea what this removed packaged had been for. "It
is my precious!" :-) The original author was hurt even more: he had as
he defined pristine distribution (just installed!) and then this
pristinness was brutally violated by TL team. It is the same feeling
as for the scratch on the new car or the fly on just painted and not
dried out wall :-)

Well, one can always run update with --no-auto-remove switch.

More serious case is if after update package becomes broken and it
happens even with the really used packages. But there is back-up for
this.

On windows, the restriction is chosen to be stronger than for Unix
because of several security reasons.
In the case of openout_any = p, a name with ':' is forbidden
irrespective of the value of TEXMFOUTPUT.
You can change temorarily the openout_any in your
batch script:
set OPENOUT_ANY=r
... ...

Thanks,
Akira

If `script' means `batchfile', does this what you want?

cd /d %~dp1\tmp
...
bibtex %~n1
...
cd ..

%~dp1 is drive and path from %1.
%~n1 is just the filename without drive, path or extension.

that's perfectly ok IMHO!

my *only* point was that tlmgr should keep backups for removed packages
(both if it gets removed for licence reasons or for renaming or whatever).

We still do temporary backups on updates as before independently of

Indeed, e.g. I am not reading MacOS mailing list, but texhax.

The example can be reduced to (beamer is way to complex):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

I have added sanity checks for some options that directly write
PDF code. For example:
  \usepackage[pdfborder=0 0 0]{hyperref}
would end up as "000" in the PDF file, because LaTeX
strips spaces. Also nothing stops from writing:
  \hypersetup{pdfborder={funny invalid stuff}}
The result would be invalid PDF files.

However I forgot a backslash in the pattern to escape "[".
Fixed now in hyperref 6.81o.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

    Does anyone know what happened to the bayer fonts on CTAN?  

I suspect I should replace TL's "bayer" with CTAN's "universa".
I'll look further into that.

"bayer" predates my involvement in TL, goes back to at least TL 3 in 1998,

Subject: [tex-live] Feature request : upgrading and fonts
Message-ID: <C4B8E976-B89C-4C9C-B67C-A9E0BE2B70D5@free.fr>

After upgrading from MacTex 2008 to 2009, then from 2009 to 2010, I happened to stumble upon the problem of re-enabling the fonts added in the previous installation. After each upgrade, I had to manually edit updmap.cfg, track the differences between the previous and the brand new file, add again all .map files I had previously installed, and rerun updmap-sys --syncwithtrees (in case some map file happen to be missing both texmf.local and the new texlive).

A recent message in news:fr.comp.text.tex <8b2bf7e5-f83f-40dd-9dd7-d57ea6de0fea at t7g2000vbj.googlegroups.com> shows how frustrating it proves for the average user to upgrade and find out that all previously added fonts have vanished.

I  think that automagically enabling all fonts added in a previous TexLive installation might be a worthwhile feature of TexLive (and/or MacTex); enabling easier transition from one version of TexLive to a new one.

Hi TL people

it seems that the memoir version in TL10 does not match the version on CTAN.

CTAN: 3.6f
TL10: 3.6e

(reported on ctt, I haven't gotten around to updating my TL10 yet)

Confirmed: on TL2010 memoir is 3.6e updated in the first after freeze
update Sep 10. However on CTAN

/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/memoir.dtx does not mention
3.6f (only 3.6e) either

that is one of the three sites, obviously not alan.

and that's alan.smcvt.edu; lars always upload there, for some reason.

cambridge has 3.6e, and tl sucks from cambridge, so that's the reason tl
has what it has.

so it's our fault.  i think i can see what happened, and i'll try to get
it right today, so it'll be right in tl by tomorrow.

sorry.

Hi all,

kpfonts.sty on CTAN is newer than in TL10:

TL10 : 2010/04/20 v3.3
CTAN : 2010/08/20 v3.31

kpfonts 3.31 provides commands \partialsl and \partialup for direct
access to both slanted and upright \partial, independend of the
[partialup] package option.

Reading the man page of tlmgr would help and explain how to achieve
exactely that.

In short, simply put all the maps into
	TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
and call *once* tlmgr generate.

That is all that has to be done.

Well, if one read
	tlmgr --help
or any other of the man yresources for the tlmgr man page.

In there the section about "generate" is the magic key ...

Enjoy ...

BTW: You said: "upgraded" ... neither MaCTeX nor TeXLive allows for
upgrades, but only new installations ...

What is the rationale behind the trailing period in the

In addition to Norbert's response:

If you have to install fonts which are supported by getnonfreefonts,
you should better use this program to install them.

   http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/

If you installed a newer TL release, all you have to do is to run

   getnonfreefonts-sys --refreshmap

Please note that getnonfreefonts doesn't use updmap-local.cfg because
it has the installation instructions already built-in.

This is one of the fonts (URW Classico/Optima) supported by
getnonfreefonts.  In principle it's possible to update the map files
even if fonts were installed manually.  But getnonfreefonts -r
re-generates map files only for the fonts which are actually
installed.  You can check with getnonfreefonts-sys --lsfonts before.

If a manually installed font is not recognized, then some files are
not installed where getnonfreefonts would install them.

  Reinhard

Maybe it could be mentioned in http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html
(section 4).  Currently the manual method is proposed there.

This page is already referenced in section 3.4.8 of the TeX Live
Guide.

Well spotted. Effect is the same (both start the same), but for
consistency I have changed the german version to --gui expert, too.

While technically true, this is irrelevant to any user like me who think that installing TL 2010 over TL 2009 _upgrades_ their TL distribution. After all, we never need to reinstall texmf.local Why should we _manually_ care about font maps when all .sty, .cls and the like installed in texmf.local work out of the box after installing a new TL ?

Running an automatic script during the installation process of TL 2011 (and later) should be an easy solution for people like myself.

It is not exactly true:

Installing TL2010 and modifying path accordingly "pushes out of the way"

/usr/local/texlive/2009

but leaves intact and relevant

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

and

~/texmf (~/Library/texmf on MacOSX)

BTW as getnonfreefonts installs into
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts fonts already installed this way
work. But I noticed now it adds more fonts so procedure may be worth
to be repeated

That is not entirely correct. It can happen that the CTAN main sites are 
out-of-sync, but it is a rare and always an exceptional situation.

Why the CTAN update didn't make it into TL, it is not for me to speculate.

I know.

As described, it is about Matlab support.  If you or anyone can confirm
that the Matlab stuff also works with GNU Octave, then I could install it.

Alternatively, if I had infinite time, I could tweak things to omit the
Matlab stuff and include the free stuff (which seems to be more or less
independent).  I don't have infinite time, so it was not a priority for me.

Are the non-matlab parts actually useful to you?  That would make it a
priority :).

We intentionally did not import updates from CTAN for a couple months
for testing the purportedly frozen release.  I'm still catching up with
the backlog from that.  When I think I am caught up, I will post a note.

In any case, I updated kpfonts and memoir for tonight.

Thanks!

The reason for my suggestion was that Norbert said that all people
have to do is to read the tlmgr manpage.  But section 3.4.8 of the TeX
Live Guide implied that TL doesn't support 3rd-party fonts in any way.
Well, it all depends on what people read first....

Bad idea to have a DNS A RR for ctan.org, IMNSHO.

ftp.ctan.org is a round-robin address; in this case Cambridge is out of date. 
I've triggered synchronization.

I just checked, and, unfortunately, universa isn't exactly the same as
universal (bayer).  See the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List for a
comparison.

Perhaps we should ask the CTAN maintainers to expand the bayer files
on CTAN?

quite how this is a tl matter, rather than a ctan matter, isn't clear to
me.

just as well there's a ctan person on this list, eh?

i've asked the ctan db manager to remove chemnitz, so it will stop being
served up by mirror.ctan.org soon

there are lots of mirrors in germany; it's probably best for the
original user to go back to mirror.ctan.org to get another
recommendation.  (for countries with multiple mirror sites, the script
serves them up at random, so the trick is to try again until it doesn't
serve up an inappropriate source.)

I guess you are not using a source based package deployment system, so
you need the archive to be available only when creating the binary
package you deploy to the users. But with a source based system (like
that of NetBSD, the pkgsrc) the archives must be available sometimes
even a year or later too. But what i have seen at the tex sites there is
no versioned archive available such as that of the linux, netbsd, or any
other at least minimally sane software archive (CTAN claims to be one
such). The netbsd pkgsrc, the freebsd ports, or even the gentoo portage
are doing packaging since more than 5 years, so stating how long have
you been doing something is a totally useless point in an argument,
especially as your practice is totally bad for the above mentioned,
older projects.

Welcome, G?bor!  TeX Live developers have plenty of time, what's still
needed are people who know everything better and tell them what to do.

BTW, TeX Live *is* under version control.

Of course. I always have to upload source and binary of a Debian package
to the Debian archive. Distributed to the Debian users are usually only
the binary packages, but every user can get the source by typing
	apt-get source texlive-base
for example. So yes, we do source/bin both.

The problem is that *YOU* BSD guys want to rely on *US* TeX Live guys
to keep an aribtrary history of TeX Live, which we cannot do,
or you provide us with server/network/space/time.

You BSD guys should have your own server, and upload the snapshot
you want to keep to that server.

In Debian I repackage the TeX Live into 5 different
	texlive-XXXX_2009.orig.tar.gz
and those are on the *DEBIAN* servers.

Please don't tell me how packaging should be done. If you want us
to keep a history then you have it already: Use the .iso image *ONLY*
or the released tarballss of the releases, and not intermediate
steps. We will not and cannot and have no intention (we = TL Team)
to save backlogs to arbitrary old.

Just bundle up what you need into one tar file and be gone, is it that hard?
THen use it from your or any BSD server to get the sources.

(TL hat on)
They are not sueless, as we use them to check the sanity and 
completeness of *our* packaging system.

What you wan tis to adapt *our* packaging system to what you need.
But this is not our business. Packagers have to adpat to upstream.

(Debian hat on)
You know how much time it took me to switch from the packaging of
TL 2007 to the one of 2009 in Debian. And the same will happen 
when switching to TL 2010 where I have to switch to the tlnet
distribution method. I know how to do it, I only miss the time
to program it.

> These packaging systems need a given, _tested_ version of the source
> archives. The sums could prove that a source is authentic, but how can

(TL hat on)
For what? As we are distributing TL since quite some time now, it
seems that somehow we managed without that,so why do you assume
that this is not possible? Maybe because the you don't want to 
invest time to program around what our distribution system is?

How hard is to:
- rsync any tlnet at a given date
- extract the timestamps or package revisions from the tlpdb
- rename the package.tar.xz to include the revision
- tar up all the stuff
? 

That is a perl script of about 30 lines? 

> one get an older version, that is _known to work_, as this a principle

There is *NO*NO*NO* *known to work* release. We try our best, we
test before releases, but even with the released verison of TL2010
there are bugs. So what you can do is select any day and use that.

Before syncing to CTAN we do several tests to ensure basic operationality.

Well, that can be fixed by using gpg  signing the relase file.
Maybe I implement that.

Ahem ... ever checed the doc directory in
	Master/tlpkg/doc
???

I assume you have an idea about that, right? All the perl modules are
pod documented. Read that.

Yes, but the problem is that *WE* are distributing already to
our users. We are not simple upstream package creators.

ALl what is written there is actually aplying to *US*versus*TeX package
writers*, they should keep a proper history.

WHen I read the recommendation in that article and I would try to 
follow there would be:
- no installation of TL over the network
- no live update over the network
- no testing of critical package before relaeaseing, ...

Please, try to see that you are dealing not with an upstream
like program foobar, but with an upstream that is also a distributor.

If you want some more traditional approach, why not pull the packages
directly from CTAN? There you have what you want, the files
directly from the authors.

So to come back to that...

which presents some very nice ideas for upstream, which in our case
would be the TeX packagers, we would happy to have ourself.
But as we are distributing, *we* are the packagers in the terminology
pf that article, this does not apply!

QUote
------------------
    * Avoid modifying published distfiles. Once you have made a distfile available, never modify it. Even if it includes a stupid bug, don't touch it; instead, publish a new version.

      Rationale: Many packaging systems store cryptographic digests of the distfiles they use in the source packages. This helps verify that no third party has modified the package since its creation. If you change a distfile, you will break the package because the digest test will fail. The maintainer has to check why the test fails, to ensure that there are no malicious changes--not an easy task.

The files and md5sums of the *published* TeX Live 2010 as distributed
inthe ISO image or release tar balls do not change. If it is that what
you need, it is fine.

    * Avoid moving published distfiles. Once you have published a distfile and distributed its URL, don't remove it from the server or move it around. If you must do it, it would be nice if you contacted all known package maintainers to let them know this issue.

      Rationale: Many source packages download distfiles from their original sites; if the file is moved or removed, the fetch process will fail and the package will be broken. This isn't difficult to fix, but it opens a time window during which people cannot download the package.


So that would mean that we should keep for *EVERY* day one copy of
the tlnet archive, which is 2Gb. Umpf. Even with hard links in very
short time every CTAN node will send us a nice letter: "Thanks for working
on TeX Live, but we cannot distribute it anymore".

This is not what we want, what anyone wnats.

If you want it, set up a cron job that rsyncs at any given time
after our sync and create your own history of tlnet per day, and store it
whereever you can.

    * Always use versioned distfiles. The distfile's name must always include a version string identifying it, whether a version number or a timestamp. If you want a static name that refers to the latest version, use a symbolic link on your sever pointing to the full name.

      Rationale: This is very similar to the modification of published distfiles described above. If you replace a distfile with one containing a new version, you implicitly break the cryptographic digests stored in source packages.

The only cryptographic digest that are reasonable are the one in the
texlive.tlpdb. Whatever you store on your BSD distribution ystem 
has to use a different approach. Or, as said already several times, 
repackage the original .tar.xz on a daily basis and put them on one
of your servers.

    * Do not include prebuilt files in your distfile. Be sure that your distfile does not contain prebuilt files that are OS- or architecture-specific. For example, it is erroneous to include a prebuilt object file, but correct to include a Lex-generated C source file.

      Rationale: When building on operating systems and/or architectures different from yours, those files will not be built again because the rebuild rules will not fire. They will cause strange errors later, as their format will be incorrect.


Also a nice idea, but only for package writers, but we are distributors,
so this does not apply to us. None of the many TeX Live users who
happily installed TL over the network want to run the installation
routines for each and every package (2000+) by hand themselves?

---------------------


So this article simply as as useful for us as .... I don't want to say.

I guess what I will do, that is the only positive input you provided,
to allow signed release files, so that the texlive.tlpdb, or the
texlive.tlpdb.md5 is signed with some (to be generated) gpg key.
I will discuss that internally, but I am not sure if others of the 
team actually see the need for it (I don't see it either).

So, I hope that slowly you get an impression about what you are dealing
with with TeX Live. If you have any question concerning our infrastructure,
the system, whatever, you are invited to come back, but please stop
trying to push your distribution ideas onto us, thanks.

Best wishes

Does this persist? It is a normal http lookup, is outgoing port 80
blocked on your system?

Well, I didn't explicitly open it and it used to be okay by the past,
for instance with TL 2009! I do not have any trouble to browse the
internet. BTW, my boxes are Mandriva 2010.1 Linux.

1. Either if I don't explicitly open it or if I explicitly open it, I
get (on another box):

# tlmgr update --self --all
cannot contact mirror.ctan.org, returning a backbone server!
tlmgr: package repository
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
Cannot load TeX Live database from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet
at /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/i386-linux/tlmgr line 4277.

2. If I manually specify a mirror:

# tlmgr
--repository=ftp://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet
update --self --all

the previous problem disappear.

3. If I don't manually specify a mirror but completely disable my
firewall, the problem in item 1 disappear but I don't like to do so,
even for few minutes when I update the TL.

Best wishes.

Subject: [tex-live] fontspec and xcolor incompatibility?
Message-ID: <F707D7B9-7F24-4979-952C-ABA15BA9CACF@inf.ethz.ch>

Hello all

I upgraded yesterday from TL 2010 pretest to the released version. Since then, text color is not applied any more when the font is selected using the fontspec package and color is specified using commands from the xcolor package.

Example document:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{fontspec}
%\usepackage{unicode-math}

% font selection
\setromanfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Cambria}
%\setmathfont{Cambria Math}

%\renewcommand{\color}[1]{\addfontfeature{Color=#1}}

\begin{document}

\large

{\addfontfeature{Color=violet}Test 1. Math: $1+1=2$}

{\color{violet}Test 2. Math: $1+1=2$}

\textcolor{violet}{Test 3. Math: $1+1=2$}

\end{document}


If I set the font color using "\addfontfeature", color is applied, but using "\color" or "\textcolor" has no effect. If I comment out "\setromanfont", color is applied, though.

The renewed color command is a temporary workaround (it doesn't work with math).

Best,
Markus

Message-ID: <000001cb5966$0bd29f00$2377dd00$@schweizer-informatik.ch>

Hi list

Yesterday I updated my TL installation and now coloured text won't work as
it used to:

% !TEX TS-program = xelatex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Arial}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\begin{document}
\textcolor{red}{coloured text?!} % works only if setmainfont is NOT used
{\addfontfeature{Color=red}coloured text?!} % works only if setmainfont IS
used
\end{document}

Other packages which use colours (e.g. listings) won't work as well.

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong? Thanks.

Regards, Raphael

That is strange. So what we basically do is:
	wget http://mirror.ctan.org
and analyze the output searching for "Location: ...".

If you do that on the command line, what do you get there?

I am really surprised what is configured in that firewall that wget is forbidden?

Exactly. They are repackaging an already "packaged" system, so all their
expectation don't apply, it is like repacking Redhat or Debian packages.
If this does not work for them, it is not TeXLive's fault, they still
have CTAN to pull packages from if they want.

Well it does work, we have distribution packges for REDHAT, SOME BSDS (AFAIR),
Debian of course, SUSE (I guess), etc etc ....

I am surprised about the BSD problem, since I remember that Ed Barrett (Name approx)
packaged for BSD, probably one more of the "My BSD is not Your BSD" (Free, Net,
Open, Foobar) fighting why they don't share.

This bug has been already fixed, wait for next update (or pull the

I don't know about BSD, but I used to run a Gentoo box, they basically
relay on upstream distributed sources downloaded and built on users
machines, there is no real packages (in Debian or Redhat sense) but
recipes that download, build and install the package, and they don't
upload original sources to their servers either, that why original
upstream packages need to be available at any certain point of time.
So I can see why it does not work for them, but I don't think any of
this is TeXLive's business.

No, as a wget option. It inserts random time intervals between queries
as if you clicked manually in your browsers. It's written in the wget
man page that some servers block automatic download by wget but allow
access from browsers, that's why this switch was implemented.

I didn't say there's something wrong with wget, just as you wrote
about the firewall problem this is the only thing I can imagine. I do
not know whether I am right, I just suggested to try. I do not know
whether it helps.

Subject: [tex-live] fontspec 2.1 and some font packages clash
Message-ID: <039c01cb5982$ef570830$ce051890$@gmail.com>

Hi all,

         When I updated fontspec to v2.1, I find it includes xunicode by
default. This makes an error "Command `\Finv' already defined." when using
amssymb (or some other font package) AFTER fontspec. I know it will be fine
if fontspec is loaded later. However, it makes classes for general purpose
using fontspec (for me, all ctex*.cls in ctex pkg.) clash, since it's
impossible to decide when and whether math packages are loaded. A simplified
example:

 

% foo.cls by Alice

\ProvidesClass{foo}

\RequirePackage{fontspec}

\endinput

 

% bar.tex by Bob

\documentclass{foo}

\usepackage{amssymb} % oops!

\begin{document}

Test only.

\end{document}

 

Is there any suggestions for this problem? I guess it would be OK if
fontspec provides an extra option that suppress xunicode for a future load.

Many thanks.

 

Leo

Hi Ross,

Not sure if you're on the TL mailing list at the moment; see below for a clash with xunicode and amssymb. Is there any reason in particular for xunicode to define the following maths characters?

\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x2132}{\Finv}
\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x2135}{\aleph}
\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x2136}{\beth}
\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x2137}{\gimel}
\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x2138}{\daleth}
\DeclareUTFcharacter[\UTFencname]{x2141}{\Game}

As far as I know these are the only excursions into maths territory that xunicode makes; I can't see the gain of providing them here.

Cheers,
Will

A bug, probably the use of \scantokens without \endlinechar=-1,
thus the space is the consequence of the uncommented endline character.

After an update of TL, the example breaks with lots of errors and warnings:

Hi all,

I've installed TL2010 on my Samba-Share using linux and win32 binaries.
Things are working on the linux-console.

On my win32-console I'm getting the following error:

C:/texlive is no longer present.

I had adapted my PATH on my windows maschine:

> H:\Documents>PATH

Any hints there my windows-maschine hat stored informations about
C:/texlive/texmf-var/web2c?

TIA

At the moment there seems to be no consistent behavior regarding the placement of recorder (*.fls) files. pdfTeX places them in the output directory, with "$progname$pid.fls" as file name, while XeTeX puts them in the current directory with "$jobname.fls" as file name. It would be great if these locations would be made consistent or at least documented.

Could you check whether TEXMFCNF is set in the environment?  It
shouldn't.

Subject: [tex-live] Strange feature with "Linux Libertine O" font and
	realscripts
Message-ID: <4C98D7B1.3020405@free.fr>

Hi again,

Loading a typewriter font with \setmonofont *after*
\setmainfont{Linux Libertine O} breaks \realsuperscript, I append a 
sample file and the corresponding .log and .pdf files.

Reversing the order of the \setmainfont and \setmonofont works fine, but 
it looks strange to me that the order matters.

Best wishes,

Hi all,

I can't print realsuperscripts with TL2010 (updated today) and the Iwona 
font, I append a sample file, the corresponding .log file.

The result showed by \showoutput is correct by no .pdf file is created.

This test file works fine  with TL2009 (just replacing 
\usepackage{fontspec} \usepackage{realscripts} by \usepackage{xltxtra}).

Did I miss something in the installation?

Hi list

I was wondering whether one should just use the equivs mentioned on 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html, to use the TUG TL10 in ubuntu, 
or if it need updating?

We have several students with ubuntu, and I'd rather like them to use 
the TUG TL10, than having to wait for it to arrive for Ubuntu.

This may seem like an odd question, but do you own a copy of the

Helvetica comes bundled with certain HP products, so it
is by no means unusual for someone to have a legitimate
copy of the real thing without ever having explicitly
purchased a copy of the same.

Yes, Helvetica is present in HP printers. It is possible to modify the
font maps so that phv* just maps to the font names of the Helvetica
family but does not load the file with the URW fonts of the Nimbus
family. Thus the resulting PS and/or PDF file will ask the RIP to use
Helvetica but the font will not be embedded. While this seems to be
nice, there is one danger. The truth is that Helvetica in device A
_IS_NOT_EQUAL_ to Helvetica in device B. What might look fine on your
printer will likely be rubbish if you give such a PS/PDF file to
someone else. I know what I am saying. I have such a bad (ane
expensive) experience with Times and Helvetica. What looked well in
Ghostscript and on my HP printer turned into garbage somewhere else,
interword spaces disappeared, almost all accented characters were
damaged. If you want to use real Helvetica and you want to give such
PS/PDF to someone else, it is mandatory to have the real Helvetica
font and embed it in the file. Good printing houses will not accept
PDF requiring Helvetica if the font is not embedded because they know
well that Helvetica != Helvetica and Times Roman != Times Roman.

Unfortunately I have no time to do any investigations myself.
However, the program updmap seems to support this already.  I see code
there like: 

###################################################################
# psADOBE()
#   transform fontnames from URW to Adobe
###################################################################
psADOBE()
{
  sed \
  [stuff omitted]
    -e 's/ NimbusSanL-Bold / Helvetica-Bold /' \
    -e 's/ NimbusSanL-BoldCond / Helvetica-Narrow-Bold /' \
    -e 's/ NimbusSanL-BoldItal / Helvetica-BoldOblique /' \
    -e 's/ NimbusSanL-BoldCondItal / Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique /' \
    -e 's/ NimbusSanL-Regu / Helvetica /' \

I suppose that you can enable "real Helvetica" with updmap --setoption
somehow.  Maybe the LW35 option is what you need, but I'm not sure.
Sorry, I've no time to provide more helpful information ATM, but I
hope that the hint is useful though.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That's right, I used it a few years ago when I was sure that th PS
file will go to my own HP LJ 4m printer and nowhere else. These
switches do exactly what I wrote in my previous post: the PS/PDF files
require Helvetica but the font is not embedded. You have to verify
thoroughly that you give the file to people who have the same version
of Helvetica as you have an that the metrics of the font (i.e. AFM
file) is the same as the metrics in the phv*.tfm files and that all
accented characters you need are really present in the font that will
be used for printing. Remember that even Adobe gives incompatible
versions of Times and Helvetica to different versions of Acrobat
Reader. After problems in versions 3, 4 and 5 I decided not to use
real Times and Helvetica any more and thus I did no font compatibility
checks in AR versions 6-9.

Yes, but are you sure that they have the same metrics as the phv*.tfm
files in TeX and that they really contain all accented characters that
are present in TeX encodings? For instance, OS/2 contains Helvetica
since version 3.0 that was released some 20 years ago but unlike
Nimbus fonts it has problems in encoding. Output in Czech and Slovak
will be useless due to bugs in characters \v{d}, \v{t}, \v{l} and \'l.
For some time I used tweaked font map for "real" Helvetica, Times etc.
The correct characters were present in the fomt but under wrong PS
names. Thus in my font maps I had to insert a modified phv*.enc
vectors and embed the files that came with OS/2. Fortunatelly after
inserting that *.enc files they matched the TFM files. What I want to
write is that it is dangerous to insert unknown font just because it
has some name. I once forgot to embed the real font (I gave the file
intended for my HP printer) to DTP for preparing the offset films and
unsusable films cost me a few houndred USD. I know a man who did
somethiong similar but unfortunatelly it was spot when everything was
printed and bound. The price of the books that have to be put to
garbage and printed again (500 misprints per page is really too many)
was about 30 thousand USD. Are you ready to undergo such a risk?

Sure.  It's preferred to embed all fonts (default in TeX Live).

I assumed that Mark was forced to use Helvetica.  Otherwise it doesn't
make any sense, especially because TeX Gyre Heros exists.

OK, there is a way how to do it temporarily if someone is forced. Look
at http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb27-1/ and read Font
installation the shallow way by Siep Kroonenberg. The trick is that
you make your own map file for Helvetica (or whatever) that will not
contain the file names, just the PS names. You then use \pdfmapfile
command in pdftex to read this file which will replace the map
installed in TL just temporarily for this document. You thus can
create PDF with true Helvetica without embeding it but do not spoil
TL.

But is your last para. not internally inconsistent ?  You start by
arguing that it is dangerous to embed an unknown font just because
it has the same name as your intended font, then cite a counter-
example where you accidentally /failed/ to embed the font, as a result
of which a catastrophe occurred.  It seems to me that embedding the
font is the /only/ sane choice : relying on local metrics (etc) to
exactly match those of the final printer is (IMHO) just a recipe
for disaster.

So in this particular case, my only reason for mentioning the HP
Helvetica fonts was that at least two people seemed to doubt whether
Mark London actually had Helvetica on his system; if he does have
(courtesy of an HP Scanner and I.R.I.S. OCR, for example), then
provided that he can (a) embed this font, and (b) that the
resulting PDF both looks and prints correctly locally, then (IMHO)
he should be able to forward said PDF to his printer with little
fear (on this score, at least) that problems may subsequently arise.

None of the preceding is intended to suggest that Mark should
ignore your reference to Siep Kroonenberg's "Font installation
the shallow way", but Siep's method does require that the user
has the desired font as a PFB.  The HP Helvetica fonts to which
I referred comes as TTFs, so are not amenable to this manipulation
as far as I can tell, but could be used directly by XeTeX.

NO! It is dangerous to use non-embedded font. If you embed a font and
test that the dokument is displayed/printed correctly then everything
is OK. The problem is that if you do not embed Helvetica, you can
never be sure that a person who gets your document will have the same
Helvetica with the same metrics and the same accented characters. By
insertion I mean using the PS name of a font without embedding it.

No, it doesn't require PFB. If the line in the map file does not
contain the PFB file name, the document will refer to the font by its
PS name but nothing will be embedded.

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for your feedback. I'm still looking into your other issue.

I can't reproduce this behaviour; the only change I made to the input file was 

\setmainfont{Iwona-Regular.otf}

instead to load the font from the texmf tree.
At the end of your log file is written:

> Error 256 (driver return code) generating output;

You can debug such problems by running XeTeX with the -no-pdf option, then convert the xdv with the -vv flag to see what's going wrong. I don't have much experience with this; perhaps the XeTeX mailing list will be able to provide more information from here.

Cheers,

Running `tlmgr list` shows many lines of 

  context.somearch: somearch files of context

but there is no

i context: shortdesc

line beforehand.  I use this in TeX Live Utility to determine a parent/child relationship in an outline view.  For example:

i amstex: American Mathematical Society plain TeX macros.
  amstex.alpha-linux: alpha-linux files of amstex
  amstex.amd64-freebsd: amd64-freebsd files of amstex

In this case, I construct a tree with amstex.arch lines as children of amstex.  Is the context case an oversight in the database, or should I try to come up with a workaround?

thanks,
Adam

After fixing a bug in my parsing code that was supposed to catch this case, I see there are a lot of them.  In that case, I'll just deal with it.

Hi everyone - Thanks for the info regarding Helvetica.  The need for 
Helvetica (or Arial), is due to some stupid US dept regulation, that 
requires that submitted proposals have to be in one of those fonts.  To 
make matters more complex, the person who is creating these documents in 
TeX, wants to be able to work on the documents on both his PC and MAC 
(using Textures).  Don't ask.  So I either had to make Helvetica work on 
the PC, or make Arial work on the MAC.  Considering the feedback 
regarding Helvectica, I think I'll put my effort into trying to make 
Arial work on the MAC first. :) - Mark

Yeah, I discovered that for myself after posting.  If you just use `tlmgr list` and scroll instead of using grep, the problem might be more obvious.  The problem is that I assumed too much in my parsing heuristics; there are a bunch of other packages listed between

i context: ...

and all of its associated architecture lines, whereas I'd assumed that the "parent" was always the line immediately before the architecture lines.  That assumption is wrong for quite a few packages, but I just never caught it until now :/.  Sorry for the false alarm.

thanks,
Adam

Then you could run:
 
 getnonfreefonts-sys arial-urw 

You have to install getnonfreefonts first. See:

hmm.  the possible issue is that tlmgr list ignores the context
shortdesc on the basis that it's silly.

  shortdesc The ConTeXt macro package.

which isn't exactly revealing, but comes directly from the ctan
catalogue "caption".

if you could supply a list of your "lot of them", we could address the
matter at its presumed source (tex catalogue).

i remember being worried about the context entry when i wrote it; it
ought to be possible to come up with something better, but the brain
failed back then.

Aha!

Thanks for reporting this, Daniel; it isolated a bug in the "programmer's interface" added to fontspec in version 2.0. The code was checking the last defined fontspec font rather than the currently selected document font. I've fixed this up in the code and I'll release a new version shortly.

The version of this at CTAN is T-114.  The version in texlive-2010 is T-103,
which is about 9 years out of date.

I've installed the most recent version of musixtex under
/home/rdt/texmf. I've texhashed that directory and the files appear in
/home/rdt/texmf/ls-R. But when I do kpsewhich musixtex.tex I get

/usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/musixtex/musixtex.tex

which is hopelessly out of date (already reported). Why do I not get the
musixtex.tex I installed?

Here is the relevant line from the CONF output of texconfig:

TEXMF={/home/rdt/.texlive2010/texmf-config,/home/rdt/.texlive2010/texmf-var,/home/rdt/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-config,!!/usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-var,!!/usr/local/share/texlive/texmf,!!/usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-local,!!/usr/local/share/texlive/texmf-dist}


Doesn't /home/rdt/texmf take priority over /usr/local/share/texlive/texmf?

You should not install the files under the wrote of your home texmf
tree, but rather under the same structure as the main tree (e.g.
~/texmf/tex/generic/musixtex/musixtex.tex)

I actually installed them in ~/texmf/tex/musixtex/ but I guess the
generic part is now critical.  It didn't used to be so fussy!

(fwiw, the miktex version is dated may 2003.)

i maintain it, but _i_ find the ctan directory macros/musixtex/taupin
confusing (and i've used the software in the distant past).

so generating a new version of musixtex for tex live is going to be
difficult, at the least.

reading the music/tex mailing list, i have the impression that no-one
nowadays uses musixtex other than through one of the front ends.  i've
never done that, and have no incentive any longer to try (i don't
arrange music any more).  if i'm right, and musixtex _needs_ a front
end, that adds masses more complications ... particularly since, aiui,
at least one such is written in fortran.

furthermore, i've just noticed (for the first time!) that there's a
licence statement in there.  the statement is pretty confused, but it
does say that the software is (in ctan catalogue terms) licence nosell.
in that case, it shouldn't be in tex live in the first place.

so what do we do?

if karl's willing to keep musixtex, despite its licence, then someone
should provide a coherent set of packages.  ctan doesn't hold duplicate
copies of stuff, and the directory on the wima is has multiple copies of
things.  i've omitted things according to my reading of what's going on,
but istm that some things have changed name, and i fear i may have
duplicated some things, and omitted others.

so a review is needed of what's on ctan, and preferably a prototype of
what a ctan package should look like.

if things are going to progress someone needs to do some work.  but we
need to think about that licence.

There are texlive packages available for Fedora systems that are up to
date and work well:

texlive-musixlyr
texlive-musixps
texlive-musixtex
texlive-musixflx
etc.

I use musixtex "raw".  I'm sure many others do and even if they use
a front-end, musixtex et al have to be there.

That dates from 2001. I recall that it was at some point re-licensed to
be GPL. That is the license in the Fedora package.

I've posted a similar plea to the icking-music-archive.org-tex-music

In the musixdoc.tex that's in musixtex-T112 (the last version distributed by
Daniel Taupin), there is the following comment:

%   MusiXTeX is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
%   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

So there is no license issue (except for cleaning up obsolete files like
license.txt at CTAN!)

Hi Bob,

Thanks for the report about musixtex.

Can you point us to a consistent release of musixtex which CTAN and TL
can hold?  ("Taupin's last release", wherever that may be?)  Or prepare
one, if there isn't one :)?  This would help move things along tremendously.

I concur that the GPL-ness of musixtex is fine, as far as licensing goes.

Thanks,
Karl

Since Daniel Taupin died, musixtex has been maintained by 

Don Simons <dsimons at roadrunner.com>
Jean-Pierre Coulon <coulon at obs-nice.fr>
Hiroaki MORIMOTO <CQX05646 at nifty.com>

The T-114 rev. 4 release is the most recent and is available here:

http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html

But why re-do what Jindrich Novy at Red Hat (jnovy at redhat.com) has
already done: package up musixtex and friends in tex-live-2010
compatible packages. I pointed him to the Icking site in April.

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TeXLive#Documentation

Unfortunately, the icking-music-archive.org-tex-music mail list
doesn't seem to be functioning, but I've alerted Don Simons to
this issue.

But why not clear up the mess on CTAN, remove all the packages
around there and upload the current one?

That would be definitely the best idea, not only for TeX Live users,
but in general?

Can you do that?

I agree.  I see from

http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=musixtex

that Olivier Vogel is supposed to be the maintainer but I don't know how
to reach him. I've asked Don Simons whether I should step in to be the
CTAN maintainer.

the same one on ctan?  i presume not.

> http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html

that's not a coherent bundle.  it's a mish-mash of things that may or
may not be necessary for a release, all inconsistently named.  what
fonts, for example?  what additional packages?

if there was an identifiable bundle, i would have it on ctan, and karl
wouldn't need to ask.

but jindrich only built musixflx for two architectures (ix86, x64).
would the 18 images that tl already has work with current musixtex suffice?

> Unfortunately, the icking-music-archive.org-tex-music mail list

and since i don't have a working means of mirroring the directory into
ctan, the only chance ctan has of keeping up _is_ via a mailing list.
(though i don't recognise the name of that one.)

my assumption has always been that no-one cares any longer about the
ctan copy, since werner died.  which is why tl is out of date (the ctan
directory is a mess) and why jindrich therefore had to package
separately.

perhaps it would be better to move all of the ctan musi* trees to
obsolete/, and for me to forget about it?

if that question is addressed at me, no.  i don't have the time to sort
out what of the mess on the web site is relevant; i have proposed that
those involved submit a replacement, but there's been no time for a
response to that.

i would recommend taking this discussion off the tex live list, since
most members are probably already thinking they wish we would go away.
musixtex is of minuscule interest to most tex users.

Thanks Will, adding ".otf" also works for me :-)

Following your hint:

> You can debug such problems by running XeTeX with the -no-pdf option, then convert the xdv with the -vv flag to see what's going wrong. I don't have much experience with this; perhaps the XeTeX mailing list will be able to provide more information from here.

I find out that the type1 file "iwonar.pfb" is used instead of
"Iwona-Regular.otf" :-(  I thought xdvipdfmx would search first for 
OpenType font, then for type1 fonts only if no OpenType font was 
found...  I'll add the .otf suffixe everytime to be sure of what happens.

But this way you have to also set italic, bold and other variants
manually, or else you will be getting upright for every thing.

It seems I got the same problem with MikTex (that was also updated). In my case
I came along the problem with the links generated with hyperref were not colored
anymore. 

As a quick and dirty solution I fixed it with redefining

\renewcommand{\textcolor}[2]{{\addfontfeature{Color=#1}#2}}
\renewcommand{\color}[1]{\addfontfeature{Color=#1}}

This solution is probably not really good but it works in my case (the links are
colored again).

Has there been a recent change in the recorder behavior? I've noticed that pdfTeX started writing to the current directory instead of the output directory.
All output files should be written to the output directory; it may be the case that the current directory isn't writable!
Currently, the filename used is the name of the file read first; that is the input file given on the command line, or a rather arbitrary file if the input comes from the terminal (e.g., the document class name in the case of LaTeX). I think the recorder should really follow the long-established conventions and use the output directory and the job name for its output file. Ideally, the recorder file name is just the log file name with extension changed.

Thanks. (Perhaps not the most user-friendly option, but I think that's not a real problem since adding architectures is a quite rare operation.)

What are you talking? I don't get it .... you asked for gettting the 
sources you didn't install in first place ... not about 
architecture changes?

Sorry if I missed something here.

Here
pdflatex --recorder --output-directory=e:/wk/uuu/vvv/www test
creates a recorder file pdflatex1064.fls, as well as all output
files, in the output-directory, not in the current directory.
I'm on windows, and using the same binary as that in TL2010.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <52FD295A-3EE4-4399-ADA3-7A0368676CBB@gmail.com>

Hi,

Looking into attaching files to XeTeX documents (? la attachfile(2).sty), I tried out the following recipe given by Jin-Hwan Cho (http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94cho.pdf):

\begin{filecontents*}{example.txt}
this is a text file to be embedded
\end{filecontents*}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
test
\special{pdf:fstream @myfile (example.txt)}%
\special{pdf:ann bbox 0 0 10 10 <<
  /Subtype /FileAttachment /FS << 
    /Type /Filespec /F (example.txt)
      /EF << /F @myfile >> >> 
  /Name /PushPin >>}
\end{document}

This works correctly for me in TeX Live 2009 (and the file is embedded in the PDF), but in TL2010 I get the following message:

** WARNING ** Could not open file: example.txt
** WARNING ** Interpreting special command fstream (pdf:) failed.
** WARNING ** >> at page="1" position="(168.14, 707.125)" (in PDF)
** WARNING ** >> xxx "pdf:fstream @myfile (example.txt)"
]
** WARNING ** Object @myfile used, but not defined. Replaced by null.

Is this a bug in (x)dvipdfmx in TL2010, or am I missing something? I'm using MacTeX in both 2009 and 2010 cases.

Thanks,
-- Will

P.S.  I previously posted this question on tex.stackexchange.com before realising that it was probably a bug in the driver. Sorry for the cross-posting for those who follow both groups.

Try the following (I don't know why):

\begin{filecontents*}{example.txt}
this is a text file to be embedded
\end{filecontents*}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
test
\special{pdf:fstream @myfile (./example.txt)}%
\special{pdf:ann bbox 0 0 10 10 <<

The current directory was removed from DVIPDFMXINPUTS
for a security reason in the latest TL2010.
Therefore use ./example.txt as I suggested previously,
or run as

DVIPDFMXINPUTS='.:' dvipdfmx dvifilename

Oh, of course -- I should have guessed this.
The relative filename works well for me, thanks.

(And if I've time I'll put together a patch for attachfile(2) to support dvipdfmx; if anyone's done it before or planning to do it themselves please let me know to save me the effort :) )

You missed nothing; I just wrote nonsense. In fact I did both: adding another architecture and activating the "install sources" options, and I seem to have confused the two...

Correct, but

pdflatex --recorder --output-directory=../b '\documentclass{minimal}\csname @@end\endcsname'

creates minimal.fls in the current directory, and minimal.log in the output directory. Similarly,

pdftex --recorder --output-directory=../b '\end'

creates texput.fls in the current directory. And the following input

/tmp/a $ pdftex --recorder --output-directory=../b
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11 (TeX Live 2010)
**^D
! End of file on the terminal... why?

creates pdftex<Process-ID>.fls in the output directory, and no log file at all.

On windows,
pdflatex --recorder --output-directory=../b \documentclass{minimal}\csname @@end\endcsname

creates ../b/minimal.log and ../b/pdflatex<proc-id>.fls.
Current directory is empty.

> pdftex --recorder --output-directory=../b '\end'

On windows
pdftex --recorder --output-directory=../b \end

creates ../b/texput.log and ../b/pdflatex<proc-id>.fls.
Current directory is empty.

On windows,
e:\send\kkk>pdflatex -recorder -output-directory=../b
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11 (Web2C 2010)
 restricted \write18 enabled.

This case is the same as your case.

../b/pdflatex<proc-id>.fls is a typo of ../b/pdftex<proc-id>.fls.

pdflatex or pdftex?

> Current directory is empty.

Interesting. I've tested my commands on both Mac OS X x86-64 and Linux x86-64, 
with the results as described. Seems as if at least some of the 64-bit engines 
on Unix contain the same bug (replacing "pdf" by "xe" doesn't change anything).

lualatex --recorder --output-directory=../b  '\documentclass{minimal}\csname 
@@end\endcsname'

also creates texput.fls in the current directory, in contradiction with the 
pdftex behavior.

recorder was rewritten in the latest LuaTeX.
lualatex --recorder --output-directory=../b \documentclass{minimal}\csname @@end\endcsname

creates ../b/minimal.log and ../b/lualatex<proc-id>.fls
and the current directory is empty in

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.63.0-2010092500 (Web2C 2010) (rev 3898)

The LuaTeX team is Hans Hagen, Hartmut Henkel, Taco Hoekwater.
LuaTeX merges and builds upon (parts of) the code from these projects:

OK, thanks. Is there any hope that the fixed version of LuaTeX will be included 
in TeX Live 2010?

Howdy,

Using the TeX Live Utility (TLU) on Mac with TL2010 and a fixed repository (utah). Today there was a ``critical'' update to tlmgr and there were 9 other updates. After the update to tlmgr it listed no available updates manually while running

sudo tlmgr update --all

and 9 packages were installed. So far it looks like it's a TLU problem but wait... TLU reports

2010-09-27 07:41:19 -0500 Notice -[TLMOperation main][8079]	Successfully executed `/usr/texbin/tlmgr --machine-readable --repository http://ctan.math.utah.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet update --list`
2010-09-27 07:41:19 -0500 Notice -[TLMOperation main][8079]	tlmgr update: please specify a list of packages, --all or --self.
2010-09-27 07:41:19 -0500 Notice -[TLMListUpdatesOperation packages][8079]	No data read from standard output stream.

So it's basically running tlmgr with `update --list'  and tlmgr doesn't seem to understand it. I can confirm that running

tlmgr update --list

seems to be broken.

Good Luck,

Sure terminal users can preview by

tlmgr update --all --dry-run

but TLU for mac and probably some other front ends rely upon --list

Subject: [tex-live] psfonts.map not found
Message-ID: <20100927150120.22bf33cd@netbook.chezmoi.fr>

Hello,

after a fresh install of TL 2010 on a Netbook (OS: Linux Mandriva
2010.1), I'm facing a strange trouble that I don't have with the same
file(s) on a similar desktop box.

On the desktop box:

$ locate psfonts.map
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/psfonts.map
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/psfonts.map
$ kpsewhich psfonts.map
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/psfonts.map
$

On the netbook:

$ locate psfonts.map
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/psfonts.map
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/psfonts.map
$ kpsewhich psfonts.map
$

This leads on the netbook, for some (and not all) files, to the error:

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+57/600 --dpi
657 rm-lmr10 gsftopk: fatal: map file `psfonts.map' not found.
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for rm-lmr10.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.
(see the transcript file for additional information)
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file rm-lmr10): Font rm-lmr10 at 657 not found
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

Thanks by anticipation for any hint.

Yes, it was done. I did it to be sure but I doesn't change anything.

Mmmmhhh, that is probably the point. On the netbook:

$ which kpsewhich
/usr/bin/kpsewhich

It is because I used the "create symlinks in standard directories"
option during the TL install process and that, on Mandriva Linux 2010.1:

$ echo $PATH
/usr/sbin/:/opt/kde4/bin/:.:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$HOME/bin

and kpsewhich, from texlive Mandriva's packages (due to
dependencies), was already installed.

By changing the order in the PATH, everything is OK, now: many thanks!

So, maybe Unix users should be warned that, with "create symlinks in
standard directories" option, it is sometimes necessary
for /usr/local/bin to stand before /usr/bin in the PATH.

i assume source3 will reappear tomorrow morning.

My apologies for this: it seems that one or two misplaced lines in the 
source caused the PDF production to fail. As Robin says this is 
corrected at the CTAN end and should propogate shortly.

At TeX macro level files can be found
according TEXINPUTS and a test can be written for testing
if the file does exists (e.g. LaTeX's \IfFileExists).
However files for embedding as streams can't be tested this way.
Also when using pdfTeX, it find many metadata (size, modification
date, even md5sum), but only for files in TEXINPUTS.

Of course, dvipdfmx is running *after* the TeX run. Thus there isn't
an easy way to fix this issue. Even the format of the TeX run
is unkown and TEXINPUTS might depend on the format.

Perhaps the ...INPUTS variable could be split into two
environment variables, one for configuration files, the second
one for other files (stream files, any other?). The the second
one could be set similar to TEXINPUTS without opening the
security hole for the configuration file.


* pdf:close is not working correctly:

\nopagenumbers
\null
\special{pdf:object @o <<>>}
\special{pdf:put @o <</a/b>>}
\special{pdf:close @o}
\special{pdf:put @o <</c/d>>}
\special{pdf:put @catalog <</oref @o>>}
\bye

After "dvipdfmx -V 4 test" The PDF file contains (dvipdfmx-20100328):
  4 0 obj
  <</a/b/c/d>>
  endobj

Instead of "/c/d" there should be an error or warning message
in the dvipdfmx run.


* Missing documentation for dvipdfmx.

Can the article tb94cho.pdf (see above) be provided in TeX Live
and found by "texdoc dvipdfmx", please?

Yours sincerely

Robin and Joseph have already answered about the real issue (updates are
in TL for tonight), but I wanted to mention one thing:

    cat-version: SVN 2047

Do not rely on the cat-version.  It may or may not be up to date wrt the
actual files that are installed.  There is no feasible way to make it
perfect, so just consider it "advisory".

If you want to know the real version for sure (e.g., for bug reports),
then check the sources, or use the *TL* version number.

    OK, thanks. Is there any hope that the fixed version of LuaTeX will
    be included in TeX Live 2010?

No.  TL 2010 was frozen months ago and the release already has been
made.  The main binaries will not be updated again until next year.

Next year, I hope you can test during the pretest time so there is a
hope of fixing such bugs before the release.

Wow, that was fast!
I've tested it under XeTeX and it's working perfectly -- the driver is automatically detected and files are embedded as expected.

I really appreciate the effort. The next version of asymptote.sty will support embedded asymptote graphics through XeTeX, now. (Actually I think it might "just work" automatically, already.)

Thanks again,

OK. Could you then please document what the actual behavior of the recorder is, for every platform and engine?

I took part in the pretest in both 2009 and 2010, but of course I don't find all errors ;-)

I have prepared a sample file that will use real Helvetica (in fact
real PS35 fonts) without spoiling your system. The file is that
simple:

\documentclass{article}
\pdfmapfile{=psnfss.map}
\usepackage{helvet}
\begin{document}\sf
This text \textbf{with the above map file} will be typeset using the
\textsl{real \textbf{Helvetica}
font} instead of the Nimbus fonts.
\end{document}

The document will triger a few errors because SlantFont and ExtendFont
may only be used with embedded fonts (if you mind them, create your
own copy of psnfss map under a different name and remove unnecessary
lines). Since I work in Linux and I do not have Helvetica fonts, you
can see that Acrobat Reader replaces them with AdobeSerif MM without
using boldface and oblique, so the result seems unusable to me.

Never mind, \pdfmapfile is pdftex primitive, it will work in plain pdf TeX
too.
