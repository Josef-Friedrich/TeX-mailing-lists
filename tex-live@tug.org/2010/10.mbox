Dear TeXnicians!

I've just installed the brand new TeX-Live system on my PC, and
have tried to install some more packages using tlmgr, but I got
the message

Updates for tlmgr itself are present.
===============================================================================
Please update the package manager first, via either

and so and I performed the update  command but immediately I got the 
answer

Have you checked file ownership and permissions? It seems to me that
you have installed TL as root but now run tlmgr as normal user.

That is very good news. How will it work technically? Is it a TL mirror, or an additional system?

It is going to be an additional system to be loaded with --repository,
and that repository will contain only non-tlnet packages and binary
updates.

An official announcement will follow in a week or two.

Howdy,

Someone on the Mac OS TeX list was trying to use the adforn package (ADF Ornamental Font) without success with a fully updated TL-2010. Someone else discovered that the problem is the naming of the .fd file associated with the package; the file uOrnementsADF.fd in /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/adforn/ should be called UOrnementsADF.fd (i.e., upper case U, not lower case u).

Good Luck,

istm this is a latex-on-mac bug rather than something of clea's.

some time back, in some contorted logic related to case-insensitive
file systems, it was decided that latex would accept fd files with the
coding name ("u" in this case) in either upper or lower case, with lower
case being the default.

is macos' file system case insensitive?  (i thought not, but i've no
easy way of testing.)

tracing what the file system is actually doing could well be useful
here.

Yes, it is and underlying UNIX is partially in a funny way. F.e. I
have a directory called SVN. Then
1) cd SVN 2) cd svn 3) cd Svn 4) cd S*N  work albeit 5) cd s*n returns
"No match"

I can reproduce the problem on Linux too with the following file:
----------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{adforn}
%\input uOrnementsADF.fd
\begin{document}
\adforn{21}\quad\adforn{11}\quad\adforn{49}

The warning is still there, it's obviuosly triggered by pifont.sty and
disappears if uOrnementsADF.fd is loaded before adforn.sty.

I remember that too, but there still seems to be an inconsistency in
LaTeX.  If you need a particular font encoding, you have to load it in
advance, like \usepackage[T5]{fontenc}.

The relevant piece of code in fontenc.sty is:
----------------------------------------
\DeclareOption*{%
   \let\encodingdefault\CurrentOption
   \edef\reserved at f{%
     \lowercase{\def\noexpand\reserved at f{\CurrentOption enc.def}}}%
   \reserved at f
   \InputIfFileExists\reserved at f
   [...stuff omitted...]
----------------------------------------
 
But there is no <encoding>enc.def file for U (unknown) encodings.
Thus, this piece of code is never executed here.

In pifont.sty we have:
----------------------------------------
\newcommand{\Pifont}[1]{\fontfamily{#1}\fontencoding{U}%
\fontseries{m}\fontshape{n}\selectfont}
\newcommand{\Pisymbol}[2]{{\Pifont{#1}\char#2}}
----------------------------------------

I suppose that \fontencoding{U} assumes an uppercase U when the name
of the the .fd file wasn't assembled by fontenc.sty already before.
And fontenc.sty isn't and can't be used here because there is no file
uenc.def.

Instead of renaming the file, I recommend to apply the following
patch:

----------------------------------------
--- adforn.sty-orig	2010-09-24 18:24:36.000000000 +0200
+++ adforn.sty	2010-10-04 11:59:46.000000000 +0200
@@ -1,5 +1,6 @@
 \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
 \ProvidesPackage{adforn}[2010/07/25 v1.0 adforn CFR]
+\InputIfFileExists{uOrnementsADF.fd}{}{}
 \RequirePackage{pifont}
 \Pifont{OrnementsADF}	
----------------------------------------

Then file name conventions will remain consistent.

AFAIK it's configurable, but it's case insensitive by default.  But I
assume that it's case-preserving at least, like NT-based Windows.

BTW, I wouldn't expect this problem on case-insensitive file systems
because there, "uOrnementsADF.fd" and "UOrnementsADF.fd" is supposed
to be one and the same file, isn't it?  You can't even have both files
in the same directory.  Since I can reproduce the problem on Linux, I
doubt that it's a file system issue at all.

Furthermore, I suppose that Clea tested it on a case-insensitive file
system and thus didn't encounter the problem.  Clea, can you confirm?
 
Regards,
  Reinhard

beat me to it (i have work to do as well as all this ;-)

there is a test that looks to see if
\lowercase{<encoding><familyname>.fd> exists.  this won't work with the
adforn fonts, so clea (i guess) needs to change the name of the .fd
files.

meanwhile, i'll raise a latex bug, so that this gets documented (if it
isn't already).  this may take a while; the bug (probably) won't get
fixed, since the chance of latex 2e being released again is pretty
small.  fixltx2e may pick up a work-around some time, and fntguide may
even mention it.

I think it is documented somewhere in the NFSS2 but I have not dealt
with it for a long time. AFAIK the file names of the *fd files were
changed to lowercase long time ago in order to make them work on case
insensitive file systems. And of couse, there is no uenc.def because U
means undefined and thus no \DeclareTextCommand and \DeclareTextAccent
commands make sense here.

Hi. I'm preparing CTAN distributions of two packages, hoping to get
them into texlive. The packages have Fortran and Pascal source files.
(I'm not the developer of either.) One can build the executables
either directly (using g77 or FreePascal, respectively), or indirectly
(using f2c or p2c, respectively, followed by gcc). Does texlive have a
preference? Or are both feasible/infeasible? Note that the f2c route for
Fortran would require the availability of libf2c at link time, even if
the translation were done a priori.

I cannot (and would not) speak for the TeX Live team,
but as a TeX Live user I would infinitely prefer something
in "real" Fortran or Pascal than something that requires
C in any shape or form.

Ideally, users wouldn't need to deal with any sources: they'd get
executables installed for them. And there's no difficulty distributing
both original *and* translated sources if the "ideal" isn't feasible. My
question had to do with making the ideal as feasible as possible.

Hi Bob,

I think it would be always much more usefull to compile the original
sources directly through g77 and FreePascal or some other compiler (I
don't know about the state of gpc).  I don't think that users should
care about the existence of libf2c, but you might link that statically.
If you are able to prepare the source code, though it might not be
yours, it would also be helpfull to prepare some autotools
configuration, if there are available modules for fortran and/or pascal.

Subject: [tex-live] Fortran and Pascal sources
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1286206492.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

On the subject of additional software for TeX Live in Fortran and C, I
offer these observations:

(1) Apple has never, to my knowledge, in 25+ years in business shipped
    a Fortran compiler on Mac OS (1, 2, ..., 9, X).  While Fortran
    compilers are commercially available, most Mac users are not
    capable of building GNU gfortran from source code.

    Apple does not even include a C compiler by default in Mac OS X;
    the separate XCode distribution is needed to get it, and recently,
    access to that package has been restricted to registered Apple
    developers.

    Binary distribution sources, like fink, may not be suitable at
    many sites, both because of unfamiliarity, and because they may
    interfere with locally installed software (we have had Macs since
    their introduction in 1984, and don't use fink at all).

(2) Pascal compilers are not available on most current Unix
    distributions.  While GNU Pascal is in principle available in
    source form, it is difficult to build.  I have it on SPARC
    Solaris, GNU/Linux (AMD64 and IA-32) and MirBSD IA-32, but it is
    absent from 20+ other platforms in my test lab.

The poor support of Pascal on Unix was why a manual Pascal-to-C
translation was first carried out in the mid-1980s by Pat Monardo at
Berkeley, and later, that work was automated by the development of the
Web(Pascal)-to-C translator used since then in the TeX world.
However, that translator handles only the subset of Pascal that the
Stanford TeX Project adopted for their work on TeX, Metafont, and
related utilities.

By contrast, C (for all of its many faults) is extremely well
supported on all modern platforms, and has become the default
implementation language for most of the world's free software.  In
addition, multiple compilers are available on some of the more popular
platforms: I have at least 8 such compilers on GNU/Linux AMD64
systems.

C++, Java, Fortran, and Ada, see much less application in the free
software area, and C++ in particular introduces significant
portability barriers (GNU groff (troff clone) and James Clark's sgmls
SGML parser are two significant packages written in C++, but I shudder
whenever I have to try to build and install new versions).

Outside of important mathematical libraries (e.g., LAPACK), Fortran's
only major use in the free software world seems to be in the R
statistical language, which uses both Fortran and C in the
implementation of its thousands of packages.  There too, portability
often suffers.

Therefore, please consider very carefully whether it is wise to
introduce into the TeX Live distribution any software written in
Pascal or Fortran that cannot be handled by the existing X-to-C
translation facilities.

I have builds running now of the latest Free Pascal compiler release
on all of my systems to find out whether its portability has improved
since I last tried it several years ago.

Ideally the linking with libf2c would be done by the texlive developers
*for each of the architectures* supported by texlive. But is that
realistic? Can I assume libf2c will be available for all those
architectures?

Before deciding on the case-sensitivity of the file system, make sure
that the shell isn't adjusting the case of filenames.

I would say, from pure guess, that libf2c is more portable than
gfortran, but I would still prefer direct compilation where possible!

I think gfortran is integral part of gcc-4.

Reinhard: PMX and M-Tx are preprocessors for musixtex, which is a
TeX-based music typesetting system. They provide users a simpler input
language than musixtex itself. I've submitted a revised musixtex package
to CTAN which should meet the texlive criteria. I'm now working on the
preprocessors (which are needed by most users of musixtex).

indeed, but what victor says _does_ bring back the memories i was
struggling for, earlier.

it seems to me (from analysing the code in latex, as well) that clea
needs to rename the .fd file to all-lower-case, and all will be well, on
all systems.

It's configurable in that you can reformat your drive to use the
case-sensitive variant of the file system and then
rebuild/restore/reinstall from scratch.

From use, the default filesystem preserves the case of filenames
such that if you copy files with varied case names to another
filesystem that is case-sensitive, you'll get the correct names
(e.g., foo, BaR, and baZ will show up as expected) but if you copy
files from a case-sensitive filesystem with the same names except
for case (e.g., foo, Foo, and FOO), you'll find that you'll only
have the first one, but that the contents will be the same as the
last file to have been copied (i.e., you'll have foo, but it
contain whatever FOO contained on the other machine).

(For added fun, some sloppily coded apps break if you switch to a
case-sensitive file system (e.g., Office, Adobe apps).)

Why am I not surprised?

<quote src="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#cite_note-note-35-76">
Although often believed to be case sensitive, HFS Plus normally is
not. The typical default installation is case-preserving only. From
Mac OS 10.3 on the command newfs_hfs -s  will create a case-sensitive
new file system. HFS Plus version 5 optionally supports
case-sensitivity. However, since case-sensitivity is fundamentally
different from case-insensitivity, a new signature was required so
existing HFS Plus utilities would not see case-sensitivity as a file
system error that needed to be corrected. Since the new signature is
'HX', it is often believed this is a new filesystem instead of a
simply an upgraded version of HFS Plus.

NeXTStep, which was BSD-derived, also used a version of UFS. In
Apple's Mac OS X, it is available as an alternative to HFS+, their

install Mac OS X "Leopard" on a UFS-formatted volume. In addition, one
cannot upgrade older versions of Mac OS X installed on UFS-formatted
volumes to Leopard; upgrading requires reformatting the startup
volume. Currently there is a 4GB file limit for disks formatted as
UFS in Mac OSX.

Thanks.  The reason I asked is that if programs are tiny, it's
probably better to re-write them in a scripting language.  However,
PMX and M-Tx look too complex in order to port them to another
language without much effort.

Regarding the TL build system, I fear that adding support for FORTRAN
and/or Pascal makes it more complex than it already is.  It also
imposes additional dependencies to those who are providing binaries
for the various platforms.

Converting the programs to C sounds more promising, at least if the
resulting C code is absolutely platform independent.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Bob,

Thanks for writing.

There is no question in my mind that compiling with C is the way to go.
Whether up-to-date systems provide usable Fortran and Pascal compilers
isn't really the point, because we intentionally compile TL on old
versions, so that the resulting binaries can work for the most possible
users.

So, from our pov, it would be best for the .c translations to be
included in the distributions, so we don't have to fiddle with *2c.

Furthermore, I don't have an answer for libf2c; it will not be available
natively and it would be asking a lot to make it available on every
build platform.  So it seems Fortran compilation is infeasible.  How
about "simply" rewriting the Fortran program in C :)?


On a separate front, to have any hope of being included in the TL build
at all, the programs must be built with a configure && make approach
that accepts the standard options, almost certainly with GNU Automake.
See the first paragraph of tug.org/texlive/pkcontrib.html#exec.


Thanks for all your work on musixtex.  Looking forward to the updated
release making its way to us.

Best,
Karl

Not to be taken too seriously, but ...

A "simple rewrite" for MusiXTeX preprocessor used to be called MPP /
Lilypond back in 1995/96:
    http://lilypond.org/download/old/MPP/Changes.0.46
    http://lilypond.org/download/old/MPP/FAQ
    http://lilypond.org/~janneke/software/mpp/
but then they abandoned first MusiXTeX and then TeX (while retaining
the high quality of typesetting the music).

Not feasible. The developer only knows Fortran and is constantly
improving the program. So I guess inclusion of a tarball is the best we
could hope for.

It doesn't help that parts of Apple's frameworks are case-sensitive
(NSBundle and CFBundle) even on case-insensitive file systems, and
others (e.g., NSFileManager) respect file system case-sensitivity.
As long as you don't hardcode paths or accept them as user input
directly, it's manageable; using FSRef objects instead of paths is
even better.

Sort-of-on-topic, this is an example of how things that work in the
shell on OS X might work differently in other languages or APIs, so
there are plenty of ways to shoot yourself in the foot.

If you speak Python and Cocoa, there's a short PyObjC example below
that demonstrates the NSFileManager end.  It should fail on a UFS
or HFSX volume.

#!/usr/bin/env python

from Foundation import NSFileManager, NSString
from Foundation import NSUTF8StringEncoding

import os

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    fm = NSFileManager.defaultManager()

    path = "/tmp/casetest"
    if os.path.exists(path):
        os.remove(path)
    
    fileExists, isDirectory = fm.fileExistsAtPath_isDirectory_(path, None)
    assert fileExists is False, "file exists"
    
    content = NSString.stringWithString_("junk").dataUsingEncoding_(NSUTF8StringEncoding)
    didCreate = fm.createFileAtPath_contents_attributes_(path, content, None)
    assert didCreate is True, "failed to create file"
    print "created file %s" % (path)
    print "Python API check:", os.path.abspath(path), os.path.exists(path)
    
    print ""
    
    path = "/tmp/CASEtest"
    fileExists, isDirectory = fm.fileExistsAtPath_isDirectory_(path, None)
    print "%s %s" % (path, "exists" if fileExists else "does not exist")
    print "display name of %s = %s" % (path, fm.displayNameAtPath_(path))
    
    print "Python API check:", os.path.abspath(path), os.path.exists(path)

FWIW, Xcode should still be included on the OS install DVD, although 
you may need a (free) ADC registration to get updates.

Seriously, *if* someone is willing and has the time to port it to
another language, then IMO texlua is by far the best choice.  Not only
because all the autoconf stuff can be avoided, but because the
pre-processing can be done within LuaTeX.  This means that people can
use the higher level notation directly in their TeX documents and
don't have to run the pre-processor explicitly.

And bugfix releases can be provided at any time, not only once a year.

  Reinhard

See the earlier reply, Reinhard : the program is an ongoing
work-in-progress, so any port could only freeze it at some
arbitrary point in its evolution.

Sure, but I only said that texlua is a better choice than C.  Given
that someone translates it manually to another language, it makes
sense to maintain the new code instead of the Fortran stuff.  However,
I think that the author is using Fortran because he's familiar with
it.  If one wants to convince a Fortran programmer to learn another
language, Lua is a better choice than C because it's much easier to
learn.

On the other hand, if the author continues maintaining the Fortran
code, the only way to get it into TL build system seems to convert it
to C automatically, but the problems of this approach had been
discussed already.

Though I doubt that anybody has enough time anyway, I wanted to
mention the advantages of texlua, at least.  Karl proposed C because
it's the only language supported by the TeX Live build system.  But
texlua scripts don't need the build system at all.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Despite these obstacles, there are many people using R on Mac OS X, and

Even if Pascal can be made to work, it doesn't have the large body of
high quality code that is available in Fortran.

If you are only thinking of one TeX Live package, then the effort needed to
support Fortran probably doesn't offer enough to offset the work needed.
If, however, you think of TeX as part of a larger open source software
ecosystem,
then Fortan can't be ignored.   Supporting Fortran for one project today
may eventually pay dividends when (lua)TeX programmers find uses for
routines available in the enormous body of Fortran code.

It is right in tex live. The powerdot.cls in TL is the

I tested it on Mac OS X with the default file system i.e. ~somewhat~
case-insensitive. What I did not do was install the files into the TL
system-wide tree and test that way. So it breaks for me now, too. If I
have the fd file in the same directory as my document, no problem. If I
have the fd file in my home texmf tree, also no problem. So I didn't
see the issue during testing - the documentation compiled fine etc.

Something like this came up for the arrows and bullets package, too. I
altered adfsymbols so that the fd files are entirely lower-case and
that seemed to work.

My instinct is therefore to rename the fd file to uornementsadf.fd.
However, I don't really understand what is going on here so this isn't
necessarily the best thing to do. It is complicated by the fact that in
the adfsymbols case, things which worked for me didn't work for a user
on a different system, so I can't just assume that if I fix it for OS
X, it will work generally.

fontinst seems to always use all lowercase for fd file names which
makes me think the solution should work generally. Is that correct?

Sorry for the delay - just as I disappear from email for a couple of
days, up crops a problem with something I'm responsible for!

Thanks,
Clea

latex sets up the name and then lowercases it.  *then* it loads the .fd
using the name it's created (after lowercase).

so i would have expected your mixed-case name to fail on *nix systems,
but not on macos (which i assumed to be no more than a case-preserving
system).  i was wrong about macos.  amusing post by claire (sp?)
yesterday about the weirdness of macos, but it's not relevant to this
case.

the rule is that .fd file names have to be *all in lower case*.  you can
call the font whatever you like, within the doc, just so long as the
file itself is all lower case.

and no, i don't know anywhere that the rule is documented.

Howdy,

I think the point is that on Mac OS X the (incorrect) mixed case of the name is carried into the ls-R file and then kpsewhich can't find.

Good Luck,

although it does make it interesting to fix because something like
 	mv uOrnementsADF.fd uornementsadf.fd
will fail since you cannot rename a file to its existing name!

even more confusingly, the rename "succeeds" according to the system
(exit 0) and no error message is produced. but no change is made to the
name either.

in contrast:
 	lowercase uOrnementsADF.fd
complains:
 	lowercase warning: new name for uOrnementsADF.fd already exists
and also makes no change to the name.

this is one of the few things which it is actually easier to do in
"Finder" than on the command line.

to do it on the command line, I basically use a script which appends an
'x' to the name first and then renames the file back... the need to do
this is, imnsho, crazy.

weirdly, when I went to change the copy I kept in case the fonts are
updated and I need to update the package, I found the file was already
named uornementsadf.fd. so I think I must have corrected that in the
light of the adfsymbols experience but never gotten around to uploading
a fixed archive to CTAN.

apologies for the confusion.

But why does it work if the fd file is in my home texmf directory?
(That is, under ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex.) I realise there is no ls-R
involved in this case but that doesn't explain (to me, anyway), why tex
uses the file without complaint in that case. Does tex use a different
search algorithm in that case which manipulates the case of the
filename differently? (And, if so, why?!)

The difference is that files in TEXMFHOME and the current directory
are found by searching the file system while in all other texmf trees
by searching the ls-R files.  Maybe this leads to different results on
your file system.

You can check with kpathsea debugging turned on, for example

  KPATHSEA_DEBUG=32 pdflatex testadforn.tex

Your home texmf does not use ls-R (it may be there but kpathsea does
not use it). Thus if the file system is not case sensitive, the file
is found. It is the same case in OS/2 because the HPFS file system is
case preserving but not case sensitive and renaming the file to
lowercase is a bit tricky.

Actually if it is there kpathsea will use it, else filesystem will be

TeX Live doesn't provide font packages any more which don't contain
the "real" fonts but only support files.

    Lilypond 

Off topic, but I would certainly recommend GNU Lilypond
(gnu.org/software/lilypond) to anyone who wants to typeset music, as
opposed to playing around with software :).  Even though they don't use
TeX any more.  Werner Lemberg discussed that a bit in his interview,
http://tug.org/interviews/lemberg.html.

I don't know if there are things musixtex can do that lilypond cannot,
but lilypond is *extremely* capable (and actively maintained).

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=w1OGv9+bwMEa=qP0LeJfvmHy5nGLry+We7o33@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern:

I've been using TexLive2010 for a few weeks but just now have noticed that
when I create a \label{asdf} and try to reference it later via \ref{asdf},
this does NOT work.

\pageref{asdf} does work though so I'm not sure what to make of this.

I'm using this inside an 'elsart' class file but have reproduced this error
in a default template in TeXshop of an 'article' class file as well. I'm
assuming this is a global bug affecting all of TexLive2010 and is not unique
to my system.

Please have a look at this bug. Thanks.

pretty off topic, but simple solution: call fortran libs functions
directly from C. This is dead simple, I did it in my first year
when doing numerical data analysis, because programming user interface
in Fortran 77 is impossible (clear screen is making 5000 wholes in a
punch card?). You simply have to pass pointer and read the rest from
the stack, as far as I remember.

I would suggest to let fortran rest in peace for the next 300 years. I
programmed a lot in f77 and f90, and besides being a PITA it was nothing.

Then what exactly is the status of <TeX-Root>\texmf-dist\vtex\config\lucidabr.ali ?
This appears to be a support file for (e.g.) hlcrf8a, which is not a part
of TeX Live 2010.

Yes, I completely agree.  Automatic array bounds checking
and integer overflow detection are clearly the work of
the Devil; just imagine if today's software had been
compiled using such techniques -- how on earth could
the virus-writing economy still be sustainable, and
worse still, how could we continue to get our beloved
"bus error" and "core dumped" messages ?

FORTRAN's tragic fate has been its wide acceptance, mentally chaining
thousands and thousands of programmers to our past mistakes.

When I used fortran last time, there was no array bounds checking. It
was the most frequent cause of ABEND crashes of my programs. And there
was no dynamic allocation, if I wanted to make the program general for
different purposes, the arrays had to be very large, sometimes the
program allocated 1000 times more memory that it was actually needed.
And no functions and subroutines for working with strings. That's why
I started to use PL/I, then Pascal, C, C++, Java, etc.

Do you have the GNU coreutils in your path?*  Seems like the
Apple/BSD tools work fine, but GNU mv gives you the error.

For fun (?), with the Apple/BSD tools, it seems like you can
manipulate a file using any mix of capitals and lowercase you
like, regardless of what the filename appears to be.  So

   % touch yabba
   % mv YABBA yaBBa
   % ls y*
   yaBBa

Yes. Actually GNU mv is gmv but in my normal shell environment mv is a
function which uses gmv. I hadn't thought to check that...

Weird. No less weird and no less confusing than the results with
coreutils though it would make renaming easier...

Subject: [tex-live] Is it a bug of amsldoc.pdf?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinoxzCAdJrjwrVUawXm0EFi1vQu86oToEmsZeGJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
  If we download amsldoc.pdf from
ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf,
we get a 40 pages pdf file. But the file in
http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/latex/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf,

or just using the command "texdoc amsmath", we get a 35 pages file.

They are  the  some version "1999-12-13 (revised 2002-02-25)" which
wrote in the first page of those files. But they are indeed different.
The main differences are:

1,  amsldoc.pdf in texlive may lose some pages (but I DO NOT know
whether it lose some contents).
2   amsldoc.pdf in texlive puts some contents in different place,
like a table in section 3.2, it put the table in page 27.
3,  amsldoc.pdf in texlive can use hyperlinks but there are no
hyperlinks in the file downloaded form ftp.ams.org.

I downloaded amsldoc.cls and amsldoc.tex in
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/,
and compiled the amsldoc.tex with latex or pdflatex or xelatex twice.
Then I got a file as the same as the file in ftp.ams.org, 40 pages and
no hyperlinks.


If there are some bugs in that file, please fix it.
Thank you.

Hey,

the seminar package (only in the slideonly mode) calls the xcomment package
and requests not only the xcomment.sty file but through it via include 
the xcomment.tex file

on my system
the console reports the xcomment.tex file as missing and the seminar 
package not to run with the slideonly option



the file is actually istalled:

/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/generic/xcomment/xcomment.tex

unsure how files are found, but the doc folder does not look like a good 
place to me

it would make more sense to have it where the xcomment.sty file is


well, I hope this is the right place to report this issue

nothing to do with tex live.  ams asked ctan to distribute a
non-standard amsmath bundle, and i started work on it, found problems,
but due to pressure of other work i forgot all about it.

the problem is that the amsmath bundle repeats stuff in the amscls
bundle, but without the relevant sources.  we don't like repeating
things in different packages.  repeating them inside a single (ctan)
bundle seems wanton.  i explained my concerns to my ams contact, who
said ths structure was due to a management edict.  i've not pursued the
dicussion.

i was told that there was no new technical material in the release; this
is of course not consistent with your finding that there are changes to
the documentation, but the update was certainly presented to me as
repackaging.

i'll spend some more time worrying about this issue, this evening after
i've eaten.

Subject: [tex-live] [TL 2010] metapost bug (or feature...)
Message-ID: <D94321F0-7A07-40FB-8116-D90B30B3532D@free.fr>

I stumbled on a new feature in metapost 2010, which resulted in compilation bugs that did not happen with TL 2009. Here's a minimal example :

verbatimtex
 %&latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
etex

beginfig(1);
label.lft(btex $ 0 $ etex, (0,0));
endfig;

\end

Note that I left a space before %& latex on line 2 : this causes a fatal bug with metapost 2010, which tries to use tex (not latex) to draw the labels :

This is MetaPost, version 1.211 (TeX Live 2010) (kpathsea version 6.0.0)
(./test.mpfatal: Command failed: etex --parse-first-line --interaction=nonstopmode mp0tGsM6.tex; see mpxerr.log
>> test.mp
>> test.mpx
! Unable to make mpx file.
l.9 label.lft(btex
                   $ 0 $ etex, (0,0));
Transcript written on test.log.
No output file generated.

Strangely enough, the same file compiles fine with texlive 2009.

Changing :
 %&latex
to 
%&latex
(without the extra space) solves the problem...

This does not qualify as a bug, since it happens only with bad coding practice, but it took me quite some time to understand what was going on :-)

Hi Claudia,

    /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/generic/xcomment/xcomment.tex

    unsure how files are found, but the doc folder does not look like a good

Very true.  Fixed for tonight's updates.

    well, I hope this is the right place to report this issue

It was.  Thanks for writing.

Hi Wang,

Thanks for the report, but I don't think there is any real problem here.

    3,  amsldoc.pdf in texlive can use hyperlinks but there are no
    hyperlinks in the file downloaded form ftp.ams.org.

Indeed.  Heiko Oberdiek puts in significant effort to rebuild the
documentation files with hyperlinks and other such things (while not
changing the content), as part of his latex-tds project.  Thus, it's
expected that the PDF files in TL will differ from the AMS's.

    http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/latex/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf,

In any event, that url points to the current TeX Live official release,
so it will not change until 2011 even if AMS files are updated in the
meantime.

Best,
Karl

This is a known problem (I don't mind if you call it a bug), that will
be fixed in the next metapost release.

Subject: [tex-live] Announcing TLContrib
Message-ID: <4CAF64B3.6020303@elvenkind.com>

Hello everybody,

Please allow me to introduce a new project: TLContrib.

TLContrib is a website + repository that hosts contributed packages
for TeX Live 2010. The packages on TLContrib are packages that are
not distributed inside TeX Live proper for one or another of following
reasons:

  * because it is not free software according to the Debian guidelines;
  * because it is a binary update;
  * because it is not available on CTAN;
  * because it is an intermediate release for testing.

In short, anything TeX-related that can not be on TeX Live but can
still legally be distributed over the Internet can have its place
on TLContrib.

The ultimate goal is to provide a companion to the core TeX Live
tlnet distribution in much the same way as Debian's non-free tree
is a companion to their normal, 100% free software distribution. The
goal is not to replace TeX Live: package and updates that can be part
of TeX Live itself should stay (or be added) there. TLContrib is simply
trying to fill in a gap in the current distribution system.


Quick start: to use TLContrib as a TeX Live repository, point the TeX
Live package manager to http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010/

For more detailed information, visit the website:

   http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/

The current version of the website is preliminary, and much can still
be improved. Even so, both the website and the repository are fully
functional and can be used for both the publication of packages and
as a repository source for the TeX Live package manager.

Currently included in the repository are:

   * context 2010.07.30
   * the context cow fonts
   * luatex 0.63.0 (but not yet for all architectures)
   * metapost 1.502 (also not for all architectures)

Currently, there are binary updates for  i386-linux, universal-darwin
win32, x86_64-darwin, and x86_64-linux. Mojca Miklavec and myself are
working hard on providing the missing architectures soon.


This announcement is also a call for more contributors: if you are the
maintainer of a package that you would like to see distributed but that
for one reason or another can not or should not be in the core TeX Live
distribution, please consider adding it to TLContrib. The website
explains the process, and it is of course possible to ask questions on
the mailing list:

   tlcontrib at ntg.nl

Incidentally, the mailing list's web page is:

   http://www.ntg.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tlcontrib

I hope you will like this new addition to the TeX community, and I also
want to take the opportunity to thank the TeX Live and ConTeXt minimals
teams for their encouragement and ongoing help in bringing this project
to life.

Best wishes,
Taco

The version in TeX Live is adapted for A4.  The increased
\textheight leads to less pages.  I doubt that something is missing.

Probably because tables are floating objects and where they appear
depends on layout parameters (like \textheight).

  Reinhard

One comment, two questions Taco :

C1: Great idea; this project has my wholehearted support.

Q1: When you write "In short, anything that cannot be on
TeX Live but can still legally be distributed over the
Internet can have a place on TLContrib.", does this not
open a hole rather wider than you intended.  Should there
not be a limitation to "anything that can ... and which
is relevant to TeX" ?

Q2: When you write "Quick start: to use this site as a
TeX Live repository, point the TeX Live package manager
to http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010. If you want to
know more details about using TLContrib, see the
using TLContrib page.", does this mean that I (and
others) can use /solely/ TLContrib henceforth, or
will it be necessary to re-point the TeX Live package
manager at a "normal" TL node for some purposes ?

Please note: TLContrib only contains a small set of packages that do
not fit in with the normal TeXLive distribution. It is not meant to
replace the tlnet repository, but only as an extra source of packages
and updates that can not be acquired via normal means.

Yes, I'd already seen and read the <quote>, Martin, but
it appears to conflict with the text that I cited :

"to use TLContrib as a TeX Live repository, point the TeX
Live package manager to http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010/"

Either it /can/ be used as a TeX Live repository or it
cannot, and the text I cited states that it can.

It can be used as a TeX Live repository in the sense that it will be
compatible with TL management tools and will provide additional
packages but it will not be a replacement for tlnet.

Will it be possible to filter out the testing releases? Many people
would only want to update to those package and binary versions that
are declared (reasonably) stable.

Great! I just tried (on a Mac)

tlmgr --repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010/ update --all --list

and it gave me a list of binaries to update (ConTeXt, LuaTeX, Metapost); then I checked my LuaTeX version: ``This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.60.2-2010071217 (TeX Live 2010) (rev 3736)'', and then

sudo tlmgr --repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010/ update luatex

The problem may be caused by that
I compiled the amsldoc.tex in an improper way.

In a mirror of CTAN, mirror.bjtu.edu.cn, I downloaded
the following files

amsmath.source.tar.xz
amsmath.doc.tar.xz

in /CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive directory.
Extract the compressed file, in the /source/latex/amsmath/ directory ,
I compiled the amsldoc.tex by

pdflatex amsldoc.tex

twicely, then I got the 40 pages file without hyperlinks.
Open the source file, amsldoc.tex, we can find some commands like

\cn  \cs

perhaps they could be use to generate index with hyperlinks.
But in the bottom of the file I found the "theindex"  enverionment.
And the pages, like

  \item \verb*+\xleftarrow+, 13
  \item \verb*+\xrightarrow+, 13

are different with the  35 pages amsldoc.pdf with hyperlinks which
has xleftarrow and xrightarrow commands in page 10.



Maybe there is a way to generate hyperlinks in the output file and  to
get a right index ignoring the theindex enverionment in the  original file.



Thank you for your replies and bearing my informal English.

Wang Zhiyong

I assume Philip's point is that what is not clear is how to set up two 
repositories at the same time. For example, with Ubuntu you can have 
more than one place to look for packages, so the system can try the main 
ones then additional ones. This makes it possible to keep the main 
system up to date while still adding additional items and without 
needing to keep altering the repository. I've got no idea if this is 
currently workable in TeX Live.

I suspect you might need to choose by hand. What counts as 'stable' is a 
good question. I'm thinking of sending some package updates there as 
pre-release, but that will be 'release candidate' stuff in the sense 
that I'll expect it to work but will not have sent it to CTAN. Does this 
count as 'stable' or not?

Sure, that is the intention. I do not think of the front
page or the announcement as a contract, but I have added
a 'related to TeX' to this phrase.

No. To make this a little clearer, I've added 'temporarily'
to the 'point the TLmgr' sentence.

Still not the clearest possible phrasing, but better. The
current multi-repository support in tlmgr is rudimentary,
and it needs extensions to make extra sites like tlcontrib
work in a natural way. We are already discussing such
extensions off list, but there is no time frame for
implementation yet.

I think you will have to look at the version information. There is
no clean way to handle this server-side except to create a secondary
TLContrib repository, and I am not eager to do that just yet.

AFAIK, tlmgr doesn't support it yet, so you are correct. Perhaps it
would be worth implementing.

Thank you for the clarification, Taco.  As far as
the phrase "to use this site as a TeX Live
repository, point the TeX Live package manager
to http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/201" is concerned,
perhaps "as a partial TLR", or perhaps "as an
adjunct TLR".

Less important : "point X at" is more idiomatic
than "point X to".

What's the upload procedure for package authors? Do I just send to the 
server my .tds.zip, or is there more to it than that. At the moment 
things are a bit sparse on the site :-)

Then tlmgr needs to know which package belongs to main repository and
which belongs to alt, so looking at alt and not finding some package
from main it would not remove it from the installation and v.v. Also
it should be smart enough to deal with the case when package is moved
from alt to main (and v.v.)

To make things more complicated both repositories are actually
collections of the mirrors synchronized albeit not instantly. May be I
am wrong, but it looks like a perfect opportunity to wreak a  havoc.

Too much text to place it there. In-line help is planned for the future
but not available yet.

PS From now on, I will be redirecting responses to explicit TLContrib
questions to tlcontrib at ntg.nl. I see no need to keep all of tex-live
and ntg-context in the CC all the time. If you want to keep informed,
add yourself to the tlcontrib mailing list:

It need not to be that complicated, it should just use the newer version
whatever the repository is (and this how other package management systems
that I've used work).

It need not to be that complicated, it should just use the newer version
whatever the repository is (and this how other package management systems
that I've used work).

Waiting for tlcontrib to have an update is the best approach. In fact,
right now there already is 20015 on tlcontrib.

I am afraid that auto-remove feature can cause problems. Currently it
sometimes causes problems if after updating from newer mirror one
updates again from the older one.

Howdy,

I know I brought this up with Karl at the last TUG conference but I can't find anything in the archives when I search for ``apropos'' so here goes. Feel free to completely shoot this down if it's a bad idea.

I really like texdoc for finding information about a known package but I've often wished for a list of all packages pertaining to a particular problem; e.g., ``table creation.''

Is it at all possible to put together a `texdoc -a' option to search for key words and return a list of packages that refer to those key words, i.e., apropos? Are keywords collected at any level now (I seem to remember something along that line on CTAN but my memory can be very faulty)?

I'm NOT a programmer so can't do this job unless you want the job to go past my lifetime. :-)

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Hi,

I generally use tex, pdftex etc. with encTex so I like to update the
fmtutil.cnf from texlive.  But I don't actually understand which files
are generated, might be updated and later taken into account by
fmtutil-sys or fmtutil-whatever.

So how would I modify these parts of texlive for my local needs?

Message-ID: <19632.47730.224112.835690@gargle.gargle.HOWL>

Hello,

the TeXlive 2010 Guide says in section 3.4.6 (ConTEXt Mark IV):

... "each MkIV user must run:
  luatools --generate
  context --make

The resulting files are stored under TEXMFVAR."

That's wrong.  I use TeXlive 2010 with OS X (the TeXlive distribution,
not MacTeX), and I've set TEXMFVAR to /Users/rjhb/var/texmf, and that
directory exists and is writable.  However, the two commands above
write their output under ~/.texlive2010/texmf-var.
~/.texlive2010 didn't exist before I ran the two commands.

Is there any way to persuade those commands to obey my environment?

Thanks, Rainer

Yes, the documenation is wrong. Context mkiv actually uses TEXMFCACHE.

I suggested your apropos idea to Manuel shortly after the conference.
(Although it seems I failed to give credit to you, sorry!)
http://tug.org/pipermail/texdoc/2010q3/000213.html

However, Manuel is busy with his thesis now so there is no timeframe for
implementation.  If some other texlua programmer is interested in adding
it to texdoc, I'm sure a clean patch would be welcome.

Looking at that mail now, I'm not sure that Jim's keywords need be the
only source.  The package summaries (<caption>s in Catalogue terms) also
seem like they could be used.

    And <TeX-Root>\texmf-dist\tex\context\fonts\lucida-math.lfg ?

I think the most important thing is to remove whole packages whose only
intent is to support proprietary work, rather than trying to eradicate
every possible proprietary reference.

Although in an ideal world that file would not be included in TL, this
is not an ideal world, and I don't think the amount of work required to
permanently remove it (considerable) is worth the benefit.  None of us
have infinite time available.

tlmgr search foobar

or tlmgr search --global foobar

It searches short and long descriptions, and package names
??

Please read the tlmgr manual (help page, web page) and there the
section on "generate". You can create a fmtutil-local.cnf and
disable default formats there and add your own.

Howdy,

Thanks for passing it on. I know that everyone involved has way too many other things to take care of so I certainly don't expect fast turnaround. Just hope it's a good idea and I'll bide my time.

Good Luck,

Not the <description>'s also?  Or do you folks cover those already?

Anyway, at the moment I do a nightly dump at
ftp://tug.ctan.org/ftpmaint/az/texcatalogue.xml that I think validates
agains the .dtd in that dir.  All experimental, so if someone wants to
write something, let me know.

Maybe because it searches long descriptions.  longdesc contains
arbitrary text, hence you get a lot of unrelated stuff:

  $ tlmgr search --global table | wc -l
  182
  $ tlmgr search --global the | wc -l
  1567

I fear that a dedicated list of reasonable keywords is unavoidable.
Too much output isn't helpful either.

  Reinhard

Can someone explain me how the
	keyword -> package
link is done? Is there a file that relates to that?

I could parse that into the tlpdb (like the catalogue version, etc)
and add support for tlmgr search --keywords ...

But I need some readable format for that.

Hi Norbert,

lets discuss this a bit, as I'm an long time user of tex and unix
systems:

I have done as you propose, but I don't think that I got things set up
right.

tlmgr generate will only read the fmtutil-local.cnf if given on the
command line.  Its not clear to me if/which fmtutil-local.cnf will be
read automatically.

If there is no automatic detection of fmtutil-local.cnf, there is
actually no real use of tlmgr generate, as far as I can see.

I managed to add some formats but I wasn't able to modify existing
formats through fmtutil-local.cnf.  I haven't tried to disable existing
formats.  All that seems to be done by `tlmgr generate --localcfg
fmtutil-local.cnf' is the merging of files, that could also be done by
`cat $P1/fmtutil.cnf $P2/fmtuil-local.cnf > $D/fmtutil.cnf' which is far
to few function for a tool that needs some manual page to be read.

As far as I can see now, tlmgr generate is ok for distribution.  Later
modifications can be done much faster and more reliable through:
`fmtutil --cnffile=$(kpsewhich
--var-value=TEXMFLOCAL)/web2c/fmtutil-local.cnf) --all)'

I tried #!format to disable formats.  Maybe this is a bug, but for me it
currently looks as a tool of big obfuscation and uselessness.

regards,
ingo

Don't misunderstand me, I wasn't advocating its removal; I was simply
trying to determine (by experiment, if necessary) exactly what the
TL policy is in this respect.  Initially you wrote :

>>     TeX Live doesn't provide font packages any more which don't contain
>>     the "real" fonts but only support files.

> Specifically, when the "real" fonts are nonfree.

and that, together with your more recent statement above, seems
a reasonably clear statement of policy in this respect.

So if, in the future, someone were to produce (say) a Lucida
OpenType maths font based on proprietary sources, am I correct
in thinking from the above that TeX Live policy would be that
a package specifically aimed at supporting such a font could
not be included in TeX Live ?

i suspect it's all in a database.  he seems to have derived the stuff
from all over, but i can't be sure (jim's offline for a few days).

it should be easy enough to suck the stuff from the db -- it'll probably
be postgres, which interworks well with pd scripting languages i assume.

one source was no doubt the "bytopic" file that we have in catalogue
distributions.  that is somewhat useful (i occasionally spot wrong or
missing attributions) but it's now too large to be a reasonable thing to
view as a web page (imho).  i reckon it's crying out for jim's
treatment, but i've not been watching jim's work as carefully as i
perhaps ought.

anyway: from files.byname:

2010/09/06 |     329893 | help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

not as huge as (obviously false) memory painted it, but not a rapid view
for all that.

Huuu? That would be a bug!

No, if fmtutil-local.cnf is in the right directory, the one
you mentioned below
	$(kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFLOCAL)/web2c/fmtutil-local.cnf
a call to
	tlmgr generate fmtutil
will include it automatically!

Please retry, if it is not working as advertised let me know.

Maybe it is simply a documentation issue, and I didn't explain
it clearly enough in the help page.

No, you *can* disable a format by putting a line
	#!pdflatex
into it, the pdflatex format as defined in the tlpdb will *NOT*
be included in the generated fmtutil.cnf file.

Why? There is currently no way to permanently disable a format
definition idirectly in the tlpdb, only in the fmutil-local.cnf

So if you want to replace pdflatex format with one of your own definitions,
then inlcude:
	#!pdflatex
	pdflatex myengine .....
and it will work.

The only explanation I see at the moment is either a misunderstanding
of the documentation on your side, or a misunderstanding of your
request on my side, or a bug in tlmgr.

Please let me know which you think is most appropriate.

Can we somehow integrate them into the .xml files for the
catalogue? Well, you probably don't want that I see.

No, I don't want to write a parser for html ;-)

If there is a way to get this as anything easily digestible for
perl (packagename;keyword1,keyword2,keyword3,...) that would be
phantastic, but I can write the convertor myself if I get an sql dump
owe can fetch from our cron job at tug.org.

I only wanted to add: the current repository will usually hold updated
luatex and metapost that are taken from ConTeXt Minimals, however we
don't support all the platforms that are present in TeX Live. The
following platforms are missing for example: alpha-linux, i386-cygwin
(due to some semi-serious problems), i386-netbsd, mips-irix,
powerpc-aix, sparc-linux, x86_64-solaris. The sparc-solaris is
hopefully on the way.

If anyone misses updated luatex for those platforms, let me know.
There is/will be an automated way to compile the binaries and submit
them to tlcontrib, we just had no ConTeXt users on the mentioned
platforms, so nobody has built those binaries so far.

Yes yes yes. I have proposed solutions to this and partly implemented
them (pinning for packages in combination with multi package support).
But this *is* a hairy matter, the code in tlmgr is already quite
complex to handle the auto-* plus updates, adding multi repos
support is not for the faint of heart.

Actually I have two slightly different implementations, all are in
the svn repository in Master/tlpkg/dev/dev.multi-source-support*
but they are far from actually useable. If someone wants to help
me here please let me know.

FWIW, I don't think we should necessarily try to support multiple repos
in tlmgr, because of all the implied new complexity to an
already-complex program.  

It seems to me that it would be feasible, if not necessarily ideal, for
people who want to use both repos to run
  tlmgr option repository http://whatever
as needed.  Perhaps as little wrapper/convenience scripts if desired.
In any event, that is what has to be done for the foreseeable future.
Let's let people get some real-life experience with two repos before you
dive (further) into tlmgr hacking.

So I figured :).

    So if, in the future, someone were to produce (say) a Lucida
    OpenType maths font based on proprietary sources, am I correct
    in thinking from the above that TeX Live policy would be that
    a package specifically aimed at supporting such a font could

Correct.

Subject: [tex-live] Manually unloading fonts preventing running out of memory
Message-ID: <7ff256b01cdb66225139dc33ce400f22.squirrel@mjopr.nl>

Hi all,

When using many different fonts, in e.g. XeLaTeX, the following error will
occur:

! Font ... at 10.0pt not loaded: Not enough room left.

Will Robertson, the author from fontspec, proposed the following for me to
test:

[[ begin quote ]]

Use a plain XeTeX document without fontspec and load lots of fonts with
commands like this:

\def\testfont#1#2{%
  \font#1="#2" at 12pt#1 A test of the font "#2"\par
}
\testfont\aaa{Palatino Linotype}
\testfont\bbb{Georgia}

You should see an increase in the memory numbers reported at the end of
the XeTeX run (in the log file if not on the console) the more fonts you
add.

If you then write

\let\aaa\relax
\let\bbb\relax
...

the fonts may or may not be unloaded and the memory results will change.
You could also experiment with putting the font loading calls inside
groups and see if that changes things as well.

If this does save us the memory, then I'll be able to add a feature in
fontspec along the lines of

\newfontfamily\abc{...}
...
\unloadfontfamily\abc

[[ end quote ]]

I, with my limited TeX knowledge, did not succeed in getting less memory
usage. Which TeX expert could please help us out?

Thanks,

Pander

It is too long since I looked inside TeX to be sure of this,
but it /may/ be that you will need to unload the fonts in
the reverse order that in which they were loaded in order
to regain all of the space allocated.

If such support is added, I'd like to know what it will look like sooner
rather than later, since TeX Live Utility does a lot of work with URLs
before passing them off to tlmgr.  I'd prefer that automagic aggregation 
require a new option, thus being off by default.  However, I think your suggestion of a wrapper script is the best way to go.

Maybe case folding is done too early in the program.  Both files get
the same score (4) because of "exact match".  Maybe case folding
should add penalties (maybe 0.5).

Another issue is "texdoc -s plnfss":

texdoc debug-score: Start scoring /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/plain/plnfss/LPPL.txt
texdoc debug-score: Name used: plnfss/lppl.txt
texdoc debug-score: Start heuristic scoring with pattern: plnfss
texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 1. Reason: subword match
texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: -1. Reason: bad extension
texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: -0.5. Reason: directory bonus
texdoc debug-score: Final heuristic score: -0.5

texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: 4. Reason: exact match
texdoc debug-score: New heuristic score: -1. Reason: bad extension

texdoc debug-score: Final heuristic score: -0.5

texdoc debug-score: Final score: -0.5
 1 /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/plain/plnfss/LPPL.txt
 2 /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/plain/plnfss/plnfss.txt

Though plnfss initially has a higher score than LPPL.txt, the final
score is the same for both files.  I would expect that the -1 from
"bad extension" is added to the initial score.

Anyway, Manuel's thesis has highest priority ATM.  But maybe this
report can be put on a TODO list.

Some sort of statistical analysis of false positives might perhaps be worthwhile;
in this case, weighting

	/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/amsfonts/euscript.pdf

higher than

	/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/latex/mathmode/images/EuScript.pdf

on the basis of "less complex path" would also achieve the desired end.

agreed: that would catch that problem.

again, would catch this situation, but both of these ad hoc rules could
easily cause problems elsewhere, with packages with different naming
conventions and/or directory structures.

the problem is the well known one of herding cats.

the earlier LPPL.txt looks entirely reasonable, except that (a) it's a
generic file, applicable to lots of things, (b) it's freezing the state
at the time the package was completed and lppl was still in development,
and (c) plnfss.txt doesn't even point to it, but rather to the latex
project web site copy.

so why did the file appear in the plnfss distribution? -- because it
seemed appropriate to the person who submitted to ctan, at the time the
package was submitted.  (gpl appears, irrelevantly, somewhat more often.)

and of course, statistical analysis of the problems would be a *good*
*thing*, but collecting the data to analyse would be a nightmare.

what's more, i suspect that the results of the analysis would provide
really rather little by way of "general rules".

Ah, but surely that is /why/ one does a statistical analysis;
to eliminate "suspicions" and replace them by facts :-)

you omit my other remark about collecting the data.

in a resource-poor organisation such as tl, i can't see it ever
happening.

One possibility would be to enhance TeXdoc itself by
adding a dialogue along the lines of the following :

"Did this display the document you were expecting ?"

"If not, please use the 'browse' option to locate the
  expected file, then press 'upload' so that we can use
  your comments to improve the search algorithm".

Yes, it would take work, but /might/ be worthwhile.

Very interesting.

I could compile you document only if I move font settings from where
they in your document to after fontspec package insertion. More simpler

\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setmainfont{PT Sans}
\setsansfont{PT Sans Caption}
\setmonofont{DejaVu Sans Mono}
\defaultfontfeatures{Scale=MatchLowercase, Mapping=tex-text}
\setdefaultlanguage[spelling=modern]{russian}
\setotherlanguage{english}

and don't set explicitly 'xetex' for hyperref. It should autodetect it.
And please note that with fontspec v2 the 'cm-default' option is obsolete.
(May be this is the reason of you problem, see below.)


== My understanding of the problem ==

As I undestand the cause of the problem is that xkeyval package exhausts
the available memory, and even increasing it wouldn't help.

Some investigation:
1. If the line '\defaultfontfeatures' would be commented then the
document compiles fine.
2. If the lines with language setting (default and other) are commented
the document compiles fine.
3. If one add font settings immediatly after the fontspec (or
polyglossia) package the the rest commands the document compiles fine.

I'm not sure what the reason why xkeyval enter into loop that fontspec
and polyglossia are used in that sequence.

@Will or Khaled: is it make sense to set font features _without_
explicitly setting the fonts? In other words: is fontspec set some
'default' font to which that features could be applied?

If for the first question the answer is NO then should fontspec issue a
warning or (better) error when font is not set?

According to Hans Hagen one does not want to do this for the following,
important, reason. In the glyph nodes of a saved box or part of a page
which has not been rendered yet, a reference can exist to a font. An
unload would have to be blocked if such references exist. This would be
complex, let alone that the unloading is even possible in the first place.

Alternatives for me, and all others running into this problem, is running
either luatex or splitting it all up in parts and concatenating the PDFs
later on.

Running TeXLive 2010 on a Debian 5 GNU/Linux system, x86_64.

When I try to pull up the documentation for lettrine.sty
using texdoc, I get the ConTeXt documentation, not Daniel
Flipo's lettrine.sty documentation.  In TeXLive 2009, I got
the LaTeX package documentation, as I expected.

Is this the expected behavior?

For me "TeXdoc Lettrine.sty" displays the file,
whilst "TeXdoc Lettrine" displays the
"Lettrines for ConTEXt" documentation.

This is ambiguous; sorry.  The command I run is "texdoc lettrine";
prior to installing TeXLive 2010, I got the documentation to Daniel
Flipo's lettrine.sty, but now I get "Lettrines for ConTeXt".  I'm a
LaTeX user and not particularly interested in the ConTeXt
documentation.

My questions are, is this behavior correct?  If so, is it possible to
easily change it without altering too much plumbing?

Well, that works both ways: as a ConTeXt user I am not
interested in LaTeX documentation either ;)

If ConTeXt is installed, you also get its documentation and this
behavior is absolutely correct.  Thus, if you are bothered by ConTeXt
docs, just uninstall ConTeXt.

The name of the program is "texdoc", not "latexdoc" and I don't think
that ConTeXt docs are less appropriate than LaTeX docs here.

But there is still the -s option which helps you to resolve such
ambiguities conveniently.

  Reinhard

Thanks.  I see there are also config files, so I'll read a bit and see
if I can't just insert a line into one that will make it automatically
select the file I want in this case.

Hi Donald and all,

It seems to me that "texdoc lettrine" should return lettrine.pdf in
preference to context-lettrine.pdf simply because the package name (and
file name, in this case) is a perfect match.  (Although it's
understandable that foo-doc.pdf would be preferred to foo.pdf.)  In any
case, this has nothing to do, specifically, with context vs. latex.

As far as any changes go, to date Manuel has been the only person
seriously working on texdoc, and he is busy with his thesis, so I doubt
any changes will be coming soon.

As far as your own setup goes, texdoc has an alias mechanism you can use
to do straightforward overrides like this.

Finally, I recommend posting texdoc-related questions and bugs on
texdoc at tug.org instead of here.  (No need to repeat this one, though.)

Thanks,
Karl

AFAIK, no. By default fontspec will load EU1 or EU2 font encoding which
will use Latin Modern fonts with a hard coded set of features; the
fonts are not loaded through fontspec and thus default font feature has no
effect at all.

Howdy,

This was originally brought up on the xetex list since it was related to a similar problem there which has been solved. It is really off topic for that list and, possibly, more on topic here.

Given the file abc&def.eps if you compile the file

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\includegraphics{abc&def}
\end{document}

using pdfltex WITH --shell-escape, i.e., full shell escape, you get an error implying a missing quote in the epstopdf.pl call:

**********
l.6 \includegraphics{abc&def}
                             
? epstopdf ($Id: epstopdf.pl 18319 2010-05-17 16:34:21Z karl $) 2.16
!!! Error: Cannot open abc: No such file or directory
**********

while the compile runs without error if you use the default restricted shell escape, i.e., you don't use the --shell-escape option.

I know Heiko knows about this from the xetex list (I had the shell escape backwards in my original comment there) but haven't heard any more.

I'm not trying to rush anything but just want an acknowledgement that it is a known problem.

(PS: someone else on the xetex list confirmed the problem.)

Good Luck,

& is a special character that is somehow intepreted by the shell. Its
exact meaning depends on the shell used, it's different in cmd.exe, in
bash etc.

so the shell is forking off a command in response to &

perhaps the assumption is that --shell-escape users know what they're
doing?

anyway, if you surround your zany & character with quotes --
abc"&"def.eps it works ok, but quoting the whole file name prevents
pdflatex from realising that the file needs conversion at all.

well, it plainly is, now.

the effect is not limited to xetex; it happens equally with pdftex

Naming a file
	abc&def
is a guarantee for problems, on all systems

Those who want to shoot themselves dead by these actions are free
to do so,but that is a similar good idea like naming a file
	echo;rm -rf $HOOME
literally. If youse you can do it, but you have to be sure to
never never use that file name in the wrong way ....

Simple advise and solution: Just don't do it. As much as 
Just don't format your harddrive without backup.

Your CTAN mirror is out of date, please check mirror.ctan.org

Can you tell us which mirror was used (that is written at the beginning

Subject: [tex-live] issue with input stack size
Message-ID: <4CB74241.3020805@web.de>

Hi there,

I'm composing a presentation and for some weird reason I get the 
following error when I mark a text with \textit{} (\textbf{} is not 
problematic, though):

     TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].

I added "stack_size = 10000" to /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf.cnf.

I generated all format files invoking "fmtutil-sys --all" and format 
file generation seemed to be OK.

But when I compile the presentation (either with LuaLaTeX or with 
XeLaTeX), I get the same error as above.

My question is how can I increase the input stack size? (What I did 
seems to be useless.)

Thanks for your help,


Pablo

Thanks, Zdenek, for your reply.

Yes, I'm sure they are (it works fine with bold).

I reported a bug at 
http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2010-October/018895.html and the issue 
seems to be a problem between fontspec and the slides document class.

But what I wondered is why editing the texmf.cnf file and generating 
format files again had not work.

Thanks for your help,

The location of texmf.cnf seems strange.
Please edit the texmf.cnf found by
kpsewhich texmf.cnf

Furthermore you said "added".
You have to "change" the existing value.
The first one may be effective if the same variable
appeares multiple times.

This may be unrelated but nevertheless, some time ago on this ML one
person (Alexander) posted example document which gives another error but
was related with fontspec _and_ polyglossia packages. Could you provide
minimal example that would help to track down the problem (imho, that
could be the one problem).

    The location of texmf.cnf seems strange.

Actually, that's the normal place to add local additions/overrides to
the distributed texmf.cnf.  We even recommend it (see the header
comments in the file itself).

    Furthermore you said "added".
    You have to "change" the existing value.

That is certainly true, but the version in 2010/texmf.cnf is intended to
win.

I can't say right now what is actually going on for Pablo.

Hi Vladimir,

many thanks for your reply.

The real issue here is a clash between fontspec and the slides document 
class, reported at http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2010-October/018895.html.

The minimal example contained there is the following:

\documentclass[12pt]{slides}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setsansfont{FreeSans}
\begin{document}
hi \emph{hello}
\end{document}

Thanks for your help,


Pablo

    http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2010-October/018895.html

What I can report is that modifying my /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf.cnf
and rebuilding lualatex.fmt (and pdflatex.fmt, didn't try others), did
indeed alter the maximum values of the parameters, as shown in the last
line of the log file.  That's what concerned me from the TL end :).

Now, the actual error I get is:

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].
remove at star #1*->
                 #1
l.5 hi \emph{hello}

which is almost surely an infinite loop, so the actual stack size is
irrelevant.

I hope you or someone can resolve the macro problem, whatever it is.
I don't have the energy to delve into that myself, sorry.

Good luck,
Karl

The source of that loop seems to have been found by ---guess who!--- Ulrike Fischer, in the XeTeX mailing list:

This is the minimal example I could find

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\defaultfontfeatures{Scale=MatchLowercase}
\setdefaultlanguage{greek}
\setmainfont{DejaVu Sans}
\begin{document}
Hello world!
\end{document}

It makes XeTeX goes into an?infinite loop for me. I know that :
- replacing the Scale=... font feature by Ligatures=TeX removes the
??infinite loop
- the infinite loop appears for greek and russian languages, but not english

The file gloss-greek.ldf has :
\PolyglossiaSetup{greek}{
??script=Greek,
??scripttag=grek,
??frenchspacing=true,
??indentfirst=true,
??fontsetup=true,
??%TODO localalph={greek at alph,greek at Alph}
}

If I comment in this file either the "script" line or the "scripttag" line,
everything becomes fine.

I think

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\defaultfontfeatures{Scale=MatchLowercase}
\setdefaultlanguage{greek}
\setmainfont{DejaVu Sans}
\begin{document}

It is true that using --repo helps, but OTOH it makes things less clean,
as the alternative repositories have to keep rev numbers in sync,
and I am not only thinking of tlcontrib, but there is at least one
other repository out there.

I really believe that the cleanest solution in the long term is to
support multiple repositories, together with pinning.

BUT: That doesn't mean I will implement it if the changes to the current
tlmgr code base are in no relation to the gain. I have to check and
see how deep into the guts one has to crawl.

If it is possible, then I would be fine with it.

Apart from being a bug, the most important aspect is that this
is a serious security hole. Basically calls of "system" that
involves the shell should be replaced by code that scans the
command line for quotation and space to detect the arguments and
then calls "exec" without shell. (Of course the "code" shouldn't
repeated every time, but be a function call of a commonly used
library.)

Both TeX engines and DVI drivers should be reviewed in this
manner.

Hi,

I'm using a gentoo linux and started out with texmf packages.  Then
someday I switched to texlive packages compiled by gentoo.  This year I
no started to use the binary texlive 2010 distribution and I'm quite
happy with it, as it keeps TeX completely seperated in a clear folder
structure, but of course I had to uninstall all texlive packages from
the gentoo distribution.

As those packages are source compiled, there was a libkpathsea.so.5
object used at least by the very good document viewer evince, as well as
by poppler or okular, at least when I enable the DVI viewer ability of
these general and usefull document viewers.

Is there some maintained source package for texlive 2010 or how can I
get a libkpathsea to compile these programs?

Hi.

Is it correct that TeX Live doesn't provide texworks for linux (both
i386 and x86_64)? I could only see texworks.win32
(http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/).

Is it intended?

As an experiment, I have added texworks.x86_64-linux (revision 670) to
tlcontrib.

The package contains almost all of the needed dynamic libraries, except
for the standard libraries from /lib64 (but libpcre.so.0 is included).
It puts those libraries in a subdir of the binaries directory, and
uses a short texlua script to launch the binary with an adjusted
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

NO data files for poppler or hunspell are included, just the binary
and dynamic libraries!

I am quite interested in hearing whether this approach works on other
machines than my own (where of course all the libs would be found
anyway).

Best wishes,
Taco

$ texworks

$

env isn't that normally in /usr/bin?

Changing that it started to work.

Maybe you should also include a texworks (without .ARCH) package?

Thanks!

Fixed that, the repository will be updated in half an hour.

I wanted to make sure the concept actually works first, this stuff
is somewhat tricky to get right because of .so-s depending on other
.so-s.

And I have some questions about the texlive texworks packages:

* what was the texworks version in texlive? The 0.2.3 release?

* 'texworks' contains only a readme file, but it also contains win32-
   specific postactions.

* 'texworks.win32' contains the binary, and some dlls + TeXWorks.exe
under tlpkg/texworks. Is that similar to the .so trick I used?

* 'texworks.win32' also contains a whole bunch of data files
for poppler as well as the manual/help, living under tlpkg/texworks.
Should I include those as well? If yes, would it not be better to
move those files to 'texworks' ?

Best wishes,
Taco

I will take a look into that, maybe we can move these files into
the common texworks package and let the .win32 only shipt the
binaries.

MOre answers later, I am on the run.

In my experience, a "generic" binary for TW (or any other big GUI app)
under GNU/Linux (especially, but other Unixes too) is simply impossible.
Distros make it impossible for any shared libs to work from one to
another because they change names and versions at will.  Static linking
fails because of kernel/libc incompatibilities.  So I see no real point
in changing anything.

I did not want to compile in all libraries statically, but the
package contains about two dozen megabytes of .so files (basically
everything except libdl, libc, libm, libz and libpthreads).
I had a similar setup to the tlcontrib package on a usb stick
some time ago, and that worked rather well: much more portable
than I expected. in fact.

But, as I wrote earlier, it is just an experiment.

    Is there some maintained source package for texlive 2010 or how can I
    get a libkpathsea to compile these programs?

As Zdenek said, the development source for kpathsea, web2c, tex, et al.,
is now the texlive svn repository.

I just wanted to add that kpathsea has never officially been released as
a standalone/installable shared library.  I know all the distros do it,
and the sources are set up to build it, we carefully maintain the
version number, etc., but ... no guarantees.  You might be better off
getting the sources not from upstream TL but from gentoo, so as to be
sure they match and include any gentoo-specific changes (that we have no
knowledge of).

Another approach would be to reinstall the gentoo packages and preserve
their libkpathsea before removing them again.

Another approach would be not to remove the system packages at all --
the system TeX and the TL TeX are completely independent (barring
personal environment variables), and which one you get is determined
simply by your path.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Thanks, but no luck.  I followed these instructions about replacing  
the path to tex4ht in the one file, but the results were the same.  I  
do not yet have an OpenOffice file.  I have TeXLive installed in the  
default location (c:\texlive) and am using 32-bit MS-Windows XPSP3  
Professional.

Thanks,

That's what I finally did. For anyone who might want to do the same or
similar:

	equery f app-text/texlive-core \
		| sed -ne 's/\/usr\/bin\/.\+/rm -f &/p' > cmd.sh
	source cmd.sh

should do the job (no warranties! check cmd.sh before executing it).
The command above helps removing all '/usr/bin/.\+' (regex) files that
has been installed by the package, to not interfere with texlive files
in the path.  I think the rest of the package won't interfere with the
system in any other way.

The problem isn't "poppler" or "okular", as I mentioned in the subject, but
"evince", that links its dvi rendering part against "libkpathsea.so".

You should need to remove Gentoo's TL, just don't create the symbolic links
when you install TL and adjust the PATH to put the TL bin/<arch> directory
before /usr/bin in the PATH.

Yes.  And if you use any non-std. fonts you have to install in parallel for
both Gentoo and CTAN versions of TL since they look for fonts and
put the generated .pk files in different locations.

The linux distros I have encountered have different organization for the
configuration files, and older kpathsea libraries that don't support the
current texmf.cnf's.   I'm not sure if the kpathsea inferfaces have changed --
it may just be a matter of creating a current shared library version and
replacing the distro version.

You are likely removing some tools needed for full function (e.g., kpse*,
mktexpk, etc.)

Hi Taco, hi all,

I assume, I cannot test it now, though.

> * 'texworks' contains only a readme file, but it also contains win32-
>   specific postactions.

Yes, postactions are alwas in the main package, since the split is done
after the texworks package has been created. There is no way to have
postactions only for one architecture.

But the shortcut/filetype/fileassoc postactions are anyway only
executed fro W32.

> * 'texworks.win32' contains the binary, and some dlls + TeXWorks.exe

Yes, exactely. All the libs necessary to get TW running on W32.

I guess it is better to move them. I will do that for tonight and we 
will see if that works out better.

I suspect something is missing in Windows.  Using "mk4ht oolatex sample2e"
in linux (Ubuntu 10.04 amd64) with TL2010 I get a sample2e.odt that opens
in oowriter.   There are some minor issues with the layout, but in general the
result is reasonable.

Under linux there are many lines with "System call: " using mkdir, mv,
cp, and java,
all indicating "System return: 0".

Under Windows (XP;SP3), the same command leads to an infinite

I guess that the data are necessary only for (?) the preview of
CJK characters. Probably Jonathan used a special method in order
to preview CJK in the WIN32 binary. Please don't forget to test that
CJK preview is ok, if you move the poppler data.

I meant "move from texworks.win32 to texworks package", not the physical
location on the disc. 

That way the unix binaries can use them - hopefully.

I have updated t4ht.exe and tex4ht.exe in the repository.
It will become available in a few days.

Here I have successfully sample2e.odt by "mk4ht oolatex sample2e" on
windows.

A user has to rewrite arguments for java in
.../texmf-dist/tex4ht/base/win32/tex4ht.env
because java does not know kpathsea.
Please change an argument of -classpath and an argument of -i only.

Hi Norbert,
Most of the mirrors are causing problems with the installer.
I tried the -repository option with these
http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/
http://mirror.math.ku.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/
The installer cycles through the mirrors that are present in the database. I
tried running the installer over and over again to check other repositories,
but i get the same problem of mismatch install files. Can i have a link to
the old installer linking to 2009 install files.
Thanks,

interestingly I just had a user reporting this. I know he is using TL09, 
and was trying to update it, then he got the

the installation media do not agree:

So a better setup might be needed such that the old tlmgr's would stop 
working more gracefully

I didn't try to test the original tex4ht.env before changing
the arguments for java.
It is quite possible that I am wrong.
Please try first without rewriting tex4ht.env.

Unfortunately it seems that I was right, according to my test.

Hi,

last weekend a heavy discussion took place at DANTE's memberlist which
was originated by an article about TL2010 in a german computer-magazin.

The main reason was a statement that the netinstaller need a lot of
preparations like cygwin aond so on. We now that this is not true ;-)

I suppose the autor might have taken the first link on
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html instead of the
Windows-Link one line later :-(

Maybe its a good idea to kill the first line and guide users to the
right link for their OS?

Hi,

we have the following issue with pdflatex (pdfetex).

We have the standard rpm package of tetex-3.0-33.8.el5_5.5 installed on our Red Hat EL5_64 systems. Here are the details:

(exporting $TTG  variable)

bash$ export TTG=/home/user

(then we run)

bash$ pdflatex file.tex

(here is what we get)

... some output

pdftex: define anchor at line 34: Doc-Start

! LaTeX Error: File `$TTG/doc/io.tex' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: tex)

The file /home/user/doc/io.tex does exist.

In the file.tex we have a section which is calling the io.tex file. Here it is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% LATEX CODE

\begin{document}

% Note: pdflatex expands environment variables automatically, but doxygen does
% not.
\input{$TTG/doc/io.tex}


\end{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In other words pdfetex does not interpret $TTG env. variable which was exported previously.

Do you know what can we do in this case other than hard coding the absolute path of the io.tex file in the file.tex ?


We have some Red Hat WS4_64 systems which have tetex-2.0.2-22.0.1.EL4.16 rpm package installed. The same problem does not happen on those systems. Pdflatex interprets the $TTG variable and the file runs through giving the output.

Thank You!

Use "pdflatex" instead of "latex".

`moderncv.cls' loads package `hyperref' with option `pdftex'.
The class shouldn't do that unless it *requires*
pdfTeX in PDF mode. Therefore I have CCed the class author.
There are other errors in the class file:
Settings of baseurl, pdfpagemode, pdfstartpage are too late
to have an effect.

Yours sincerely

Message-ID: <AANLkTikF8tuGgrBLZmujiJhEFRhOaPV8UT_6bDQdW6M4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Building TeXLive source on Mac OS X 10.6 will use x86_64 by default, but
several ATSUI APIs used by XeTeX is not available to x86_64 linking, so
the whole building process must be forced to use i386 architecture.
However, simply exporting CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS = "-arch i386" doesn't
work, because in src/libs/icu, the configure script will filter all these
flags, resulting icu still build as x86_64, which makes XeTeX can't link.
Any solution to this issue?

Karl,

My solution is to 

	./Build --disable-xetex  --disable-xdv2pdf --disable-xdvipdfmx

on Snow Leopard. Then I build regularly on Leopard (Leopard can also run
64 bit binaries, but the compiler by default produces 32 bit binaries),
and move the missing 32-bit binaries to the mix.

I suspect it is possible to tell Snow Leopard to build 32 bit binaries,
but I've never had to do it, so I didn't try.

Dick

PS: I can certainly build the latest sources for him in 32 bits if
he doesn't have access to Leopard.

Howdy,

Do you really have to build the binaries for Mac OS X? I thought they would be downloaded as part of the install process.

Thanks for the tip. The reason I want to build XeTeX from source is that
I want to experiment with an OpenType feature which hasn't been implemented
in XeTeX yet. So I'll have to compile it several times myself to see if my
code works.

Building inside libs/icu/icu-4.4 with CFLAGS="-arch i386", CXXFLAGS="-arch i386"
and LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -headerpad_max_install_names", configure with
--enable-static, then copy the resulting static libraries to libs/icu-build/lib
works. I wonder why such flags are removed in libs/icu/configure.ac and
libs/icu/Makefile.am, however.

In that case it might be both easier and faster to compile from

Message-ID: <AANLkTimB+rOyqtCuQ6HvvD82ANeYRtUzqAQNrhVAsmZF@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm trying to build a texlive package for asymptote that includes
updated binaries (especially for linux). I think I'm going to need
some expertise here.

What I wish and what I've done so far is summed up here

https://sourceforge.net/projects/asymptote/forums/forum/409349/topic/3915664

Any hints?

Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the updates to tex4ht and related suggestions.  I updated  
via TeX Live Manager and modified the <ooxtpipes> section of tex4ht.env.

I'm now seeing further processing and an additional directory, but I  
don't yet have the OpenOffice file (odt).  I get similar results with  
the minimal test file or with sample2e.tex.  I'm running Windows XP.

Now, I see a warning:

System call: cd    sxw-test.dir & zip -r -m  test.zip * & cd ..
'zip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
System return: 0
System call: move sxw-test.dir\test.zip test.odt
The system cannot find the file specified.
--- Warning --- System return: 1

---------------------

I checked in C:\texlive\2010\bin\win32
and there is no zip.exe on either of my two computers.

The directory now contains

Tlmgr shows the svn revision of the package, so checking the svn logs
might just tell what have changed:

It says

The package comprises the collection of CMap and PDF mapping files now
made available for distribution by Adobe systems incorporated.


It comes without any documentation accessible by texdoc but with
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/cmap/adobemapping/cmap-readme.txt
which ends by

"This page will soon include some tools, written in Perl, that are
useful for manipulating CMap resources."

In TL2010, these files are used, for example, by dvipdfmx and dvips
to typeset CJK characters.
