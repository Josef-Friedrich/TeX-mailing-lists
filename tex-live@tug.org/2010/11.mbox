Subject: [tex-live] apparent bug in detex
Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.00.1011010012000.12019@cyfrifiadurcfr.local>

There appears to be a bug in the version of detex distributed with TL
2010. At least, I see the problem and it has been confirmed by others
on the mactex list. Essentially, detex removes the contents of
footnotes included as \footnote{this is a footnote} when running in
LaTeX mode.

So if my test file contains the line:
 	Test\footnote{ a footnote}  \emph{it} quickly.
then detex gives:
 	Test  a footnote  it quickly.
but detex -l gives:
 	Test   it quickly.
And the same problem occurs if LaTeX mode is selected automatically
for a LaTeX document. Others on the mactex list were responsible for
pinpointing the issue. I just found it didn't work as I expected.

I noticed this because I was getting significantly lower word counts
for a paper than I thought I should be. (TeXShop's statistics function
uses detex.)

Abandoning TeXShop's GUI, I found the behaviour of the 2010 version
differed significantly from that of the 2008 and 2009 versions:
 	detex (TL 2010) + wc: 		209    3071   19119
 	detex (TL 2009) + wc:		193    3199   19970
 	detex (TL 2008) + wc:		193    3199   19970

The problem is with detex itself, I think. I downloaded and compiled
the sources and that version shows the same issue.
 	detex (2.8 sources) + wc:	209    3071   19119

Best,

Probably this is on purpose?

In TeX mode it does not know what \footnote does, so assumes it
creates more or less the text that is contained in the argument, like
	\it
or something.

In LaTeX mode it knows that \footnote creates something which
is out of the running text, so it removes the text, as it does *NOT*
belong to the running text.

I consider this behaviour correct.

Hi,
I think that detex is not a proper tool for calculating the amount of
the text. Imagine the following plain TeX document:

\def\word{word}
\newcount\num
\loop \word \space \ifnum\num<10000 \advance\num1 \repeat
\bye

This creates 10 full pages of text but detex + wc says 4 3 17

But then it ought also to neglect text included in a footnote
environment but it does not.

It works reasonably well for things like papers, though. I can't
imagine that sort of construction being a problem there. In any case,
it is currently what TeXShop uses and it is very handy to be able to
get statistics in TeXShop without having to change applications. I know
it is not entirely accurate at the best of times.

I would like to be able to get an accurate word count in some way. But
there doesn't seem to be a good way of doing this for (La)TeX documents.

If I can't get an accurate count, an overestimate is usually better
than an underestimate because I'm usually trying to get something
within a word limit. And footnotes need to be included in my counts.

I would also like to be able to get quick statistics in TeXShop.

Usually, I've relied on TeXShop's statistics and, thus, detex.  Right
now I'm using the 2009 version of detex although this is something of a
hack.

I just discovered texcount which can give me a more accurate result
although it isn't perfect either.

But, anyway, if it is regarded as a feature to count some footnotes but
not others, so be it. I think that's a strange feature, but who am I to
say?

Less drastic would be the use of macros like \HMQE{Her Majesty Queen
Elisabeth II}, inputs, includes, etc.

Probably the only way would be to produce final pdf, copy and paste it
and then count words.

In the search box there is now an additional checkbox
	Taxonomies
and if you double click a package you will see at the bottom
of the window Keywords, functionalities, etc.

But you need todays texlive.infra, it was shipped today.

Hi everyone,

today we pushed out a new version of the texlive.infra package
shipping the tlmgr. Changes as listed from
	http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr-news.html

tlmgr revision 20243 (released 1nov10):

    * try (again) not to load the remote tlpdb if tlmgr update is called without arguments.
    * fix bugs in autobackup/backupdir handling; unify error messages; on clean, also remove package backups for packages no longer present in tlpdb.
    * support keyword searching as provided by the beta CTAN characterizations at http://az.ctan.org/ (no Internet access needed for the search, though). tlmgr documentation has details. Support is also present in tlmgrgui. 

Best wishes

fwiw, i don't think that was the complaint: the complaint was the change
of spec.

you can slew the word count in less artificial ways, but i would agree
that detex is a pretty feeble way of counting words.  (i'll edit
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=wordcount -- written long
ago in a more innocent age ;-)

there is a slightly more reasonable use of detex, in creating things to
feed to a spell-checker that doesn't know (la)tex; that usage is also
thrown awry by the change.

however, norbert's argument that the change removes something that's not
body text, is good, and could be the basis of a suggestion to the
author.  (the man page says "Suggestions for improvements are (mildly)
encouraged" so one could reasonably suggest a -f switch.)

tbh, i was surprised that daniele trinkle was still around when his
changed version appeared.  i tend to think that people who were around
when tex first entered my consciousness are significantly older than me
(which works with don, who i first met when i was a mere sprig of a new
graduate...).

the best you can do for latex documents, i think, is wordcount, which
uses various trickery to make every latex line a single word (iirc),
which you then count the lines of.

hence my suggestion of a switch; i think norbert's "semantic" argument
is a rational one.

a suggestion from karl would carry more weight than most, but if no-one
else wants to try, i'll mail trinkle to suggest a -f switch.

This should work and provide better results than detex, especially
with own macros which detex isn't aware of:

   pdftotext -nopgbrk myfile.pdf - | wc

pdftotext is already part of TeX Live.  With the -layout option you
get more words because then hyphenation is kept intact.

BTW, pdftotext -layout yields amazingly good results.

Hi,

Each morning, tlcontrib synchronizes itself with tlnet. Since today,
it also stores are the found filenames in tlnet in a database so
that I can check that tlcontrib packages do not claim ownership
of the wrong files.

This database store starts with a sanity check of the internals of
tlnet, and it reported these duplicate files this morning:

Correct. I removed all of the musixlyr package as it is now 
completely integrated into musixtex.

Thanks for spotting that.

@Karl: That should have been caught by our checks, too? Did
you get some suspicious email tonight?

Hello!

Recently on the Mac OS X TeX list a discussion started why detex from  
TeX Live 2010 does not count the words in footnote texts when in LaTeX  
mode. I looked into texk/detex/detex-2.8/detex.l to find a possible  
explanation for this. Instead I found a few misspelling in that file:

   256	<Normal>"\\sunparagraph"{Z}			;
   457					ErrorExit("-e option requires and argument");
   576		    ErrorExit("The environtment list contains too many  
environments");

On line #256 a "subparagraph" is written as "sunparagraph," on line  
#457 the word "and" should be "an", and on line #576 the first  
"environtment" should be an "environment".

The patch files don't seem to correct these occurrences.


In any case, whether it's decided to count words in a \footnote{} text  
in LaTeX mode or not (could be made an option), couldn't the test.tex  
file become a \footnote{just for test use} to be alarmed when detex  
fails with footnotes?

Off-topic, but perhaps of some interest : in real life, one would
not use a control sequence to represent that string since her
gracious Majesty's full title would normally appear only once,
after which she would simply be referred to as "Her Majesty"
or even as "The Queen".

Hi, to make installation a lot faster when doing installation parties, 
it seems easier to simply copy tlnet to a USB disk and then install from 
there (or even copy it tlnet to HD and install from there)

But what is the best way to make a copy of tlnet? just doing a wget 
against our local mirror?

If so is is possile with wget to later on `update' this copy?

i would use rsync rather than wget in all circumstances (not just
updating).  wget purports to have a "mirror" mode, but it's never worked
for me

of course, i can't say if your server actually provides an rsync
interface, since you don't say which one it is.  (it ought to -- saves a
lot on bandwidth consumed; however, the largest proportion of users of
the cambridge node blindly use http -- total is >=10x the bandwidth of
ftp+rsync combined ... on a few occasions, >1 tbyte in a day).

Do we have a list of servers/mirrors offering rsync access?

Have you considered using a combination of packet shaping and
pro-active user education to encourage migration to Rsynch ?

README.mirrors on ctan lists all addresses that we (ctan) know mirrors
to respond to.

(surprising what people don't know about ctan.)

i've no way of contacting the user community in general.  (i can contact
small parts of it using comp.text.tex, but that's about it, i think.)

imo, it's good to have at least one core site whose traffic _isn't_
shaped.  both dante and tug have bandwidth restrictions (tug's is quite
draconian, since smcvt is a small college which is being *very* generous
as it is).  cambridge doesn't shape, since there's currently no need (we
could ship far more than we do, with 2gbit/s to the backbone).

what are the chances that your average ctan downloader would actually
notice that downloads are getting slower?  i would say pretty small: and
they would respond either by complaining, or simply by switching
mirrors.  on the off-chance that they complained somewhere appropriate
such as ctan at dante.de, we might be able to explain things, but...

in short, i doubt there's any future in education by shaping.  (after
all, a huge preponderance of uploads go to the least capable server,
with only a constant few using cam or dante.)

I know rsync works well for updating a mirror but I'm not sure about
using it to install a packages.   I assume the bulk of the traffic
is for "fresh" installs.   If you want to make a local mirror using rsync
you have a bit of work to select the architectures you want.  Maybe
a useful addition to the installer would be an option to either install
directly or to install after first creating a local mirror.

Many sites block rsync at the firewall, so you would have to teach users
how to deal with a larger set of failure modes.    Rsync is not normally
found on windows, so TL would have to provide a version of rsync.  Last
week I discovered that McAfee deletes netcat.exe when you install
ssvnc -- will rsync.exe or wget.exe be next?

As long as the performance using http is acceptable, few people will
be interested.   Maybe if a) rsync is available on the system, and b)
user chooses a mirror for which rsync works then tlmgr could suggest
rsync  (or provide a configuration option "use rsync if available").

The recovery section in <http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html> suggests
using an ftp URL with tlmgr and if that fails try rsync.  This will also fail
for many users (either rsync is not installed or it is blocked by a firewall).
If rsync works the user gets a local copy and then runs tlmgr against the
local files.

My rsync looks like:
	rsync -avz --delete \
		--exclude MacTeX-2009.mpkg.zip \
		--exclude mactex-2009*.mpkg.zip \
		rsync://SOME.RSYNC.MIRROR/texlive/tlnet/ \
		/var/www/norbert/tlnet/
and that works quite nicely.

http://tug.org/texlive/acquire-mirror.html discusses rsync.  Clearly it
would be better for you to rsync against your local mirror rather than a
remote host.

I did some investigating when I found the problem with detex and tried
to use wordcount but couldn't get it to work. I didn't pursue this in
any depth but the error messages vaguely suggested to me that it might
not work for documents designed for use with pdflatex. But I could be
quite wrong and this not be the source of the problem at all.

This would be good if it was able to treat both \footnote{} and

    pdftotext is already part of TeX Live.  

For Windows only.   (As with many other generic tools.)

    BTW, pdftotext -layout yields amazingly good results.

Yes :).

To put the bottom line at the top, Robin, please do write Dan about
this.  Thanks.  (BTW, Peter B wrote to Dan recently about the TL patches
to detex, but that is independent of this discussion.)

My comments, FWIW:

    cfr> So if my test file contains the line:
            Test\footnote{ a footnote}  \emph{it} quickly.
    then detex gives:
            Test  a footnote  it quickly.
    but detex -l gives:
            Test   it quickly.
  
    [...]
    I found the behaviour of the 2010 version [of detex]
    differed significantly from that of the 2008 and 2009 versions:
            detex (TL 2010) + wc: 		209    3071   19119
            detex (TL 2009) + wc:		193    3199   19970
            detex (TL 2008) + wc:		193    3199   19970

I surmise it is because of upgrading to detex 2.8.

It seems to me it would be best for the original author to go back to
including footnote words by default (for the sake of compatibility), and
have a switch not to count them (if desired).  But of course it's
ultimately his decision.


   pd> a few misspelling
       256	<Normal>"\\sunparagraph"{Z}			;
       457					ErrorExit("-e option requires and argument");
       576		    ErrorExit("The environtment list contains too many  
    environments");

    On line #256 a "subparagraph" is written as "sunparagraph," on line  
    #457 the word "and" should be "an", and on line #576 the first  
    "environtment" should be an "environment".

Indeed.

    The patch files don't seem to correct these occurrences.

We wouldn't correct typos in error messages in any case.  The
\\sunparagraph bug we wouldn't have had any reason to notice without
someone reporting it.  Anyway ...

Thanks,

Today I have discovered that the mirror I have been using all the time
(Wien) is currupted, so I wanted to try out rsync just for fun ...

The first mirror that I have tried (the only one listed under Germany,
rsync://ftp.fernuni-hagen.de/ctan/) doesn't work at all. Then I tried:

sudo tlmgr option repository
rsync://rsync.dante.ctan.org/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet

But using rsync that way apparently doesn't work, or at least it
doesn't work here.

So I have two question:

1.) Is there any list similar to
http://miktex.org/pkg/Repositories.aspx that would also check health
of repositories? The file http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites
apparently doesn't really help me since
a) it doesn't say anything about the health of repositories - the
first one that I have used for a long time is currupted, the second
(that I tried) doesn't work at all;
b) reading this:

I realized that rsync.dante.ctan.org (if that is the same dante server
that Robin is talking about) is not even listed on CTAN.sites; the
only listed German rsync server is broken.

2.) When talking about "educating users to use rsync" ... I consider
myself a "lover of rsync" (after all, the TeX installation that I
provide is completely and only rsync-based), but still I have no idea
how I could use rsync for updating TeX Live (provided that I don't
want a second copy of "the whole CTAN" on my local hard drive as an
intermediate repository). Can anyone explain me how to use rsync for
TeX Live?

I somehow have an impression that rsync servers are well-hidden in
comparison to http/ftp/svn (it always takes me some time to figure out
how to fetch files from TeX Live or from CTAN's most up-to-date
server).

The CTAN mirrors *should * be checked, otherwise they normally get
kicked.

There is no other way but rsyncing the whle of tlnet to local disc
and install from there. This is what I am doing.

rainer's already complained.  wouldn't hurt if you did so too -- we
don't have a record of email for a "manager" for the site, so rainer's
guessed.

(fwiw, rsync.dante.ctan.org == rsync.dante.de, and the README.mirrors
file only lists the latter.

the ctan mirrors *are* checked, but rather weakly.  mirrors.ctan.org
uses the results of that check, and doesn't use anything that seems out
of date.

the one in question claims it mirrored cambridge this morning; that's
good enough for mirrors.ctan.org, but it's entirely possible that it's
simply run out of space on the ctan partition, and hence the corruption.

i guess we could run a comparison test every so often, but comparing 20
gbytes of stuff on a rather large number of mirrors is a bit stressful,
and we typically only do it between the three main sites.

it's easier if you have a ctan (or, i suppose, mirror) on your lan.  i
can nfs-mount my archive (read only).

It is not easy to monitor the health of repositories and if nobody is
monitoring the site for problems then it is unlikely there will be
anyone to deal with the issue when it is discovered.   Maybe
there should be something like WOT for archive sites where you
could filter ratings by age, so you would look for site with recent high scores.

You do have to mirror a big chunk of the archive, but you can use
excludes to avoid copying architectures you don't want (in
particular, the large mactex package).  See Norbert's previous
post in this thread for an example.  Mine is similar but adds more
excludes for binaries I don't use.

At a given site, each protocol may different top-level directories
(and may be selective about the directories that are served), so
you need to look at the master list.

I do have pdftotext (though not from TeX Live, obviously) but whenever
I've tried to use it it has taken simply forever to produce any output
even for quite small documents. I would not like to try this method on
a paper of even 3,000 words - never mind 8,000 or more.

This would likely still be faster than a G4 (should be, anyway) but
when I say "slow" I mean really, really slow -
go off for coffee, get distracted and watch a movie, make dinner and
finally remember you left the computer doing something and pdftotext
likely still hasn't finished. Usually, I just lost patience and aborted
it. I think it did sometimes finish and seemed to extract the text OK
but it would usually be quicker to open the file and type out the words
into an editor, to be honest. And I never tried running it on an even
small-medium sized pdf. Maybe a few paragraphs at most.

Best,

Are the programs pdffonts and pdfinfo also slow?

You should report a bug in it, it is obviously improperly compiled. I
use it regularly even for books with 500+ pages.

My understanding is that the problem (painfully slow performance of
pdftotext and may be some other executables) is endemic to MacOSX arch
ppc and I also believe that it was compiled by Richard Koch. So, I am
forwarding it

As I mentioned on intel it was fast: on my MacPro conversion of 1800
pages took 35 sec.

I do not use Windows myself but when recommending pdftotext to my
friends a few years ago I tried it in very old Intel Pentium II 200
MHz with 128 MB RAM running Windows 2000 and it was quite fast. I used
it regularly on Celeron 333 MHz under OS/2 Warp 4.0.

Oops! /usr/local/bin/pdftotext

As discussion started from detex which is part of TL binaries I
extended this to pdftotext which is not

Sorry.

I already wrote "Oops" as Herb Schultz corrected me. My conjecture?is
that it came either from attempt to compile xpdf or from compilation
of poppler

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live installation tools
Message-ID: <4CD16A8A.2080608@imf.au.dk>

Hi, I think in earlier years there were some extra tools or ideas for 
scripts meant for special installations.

Do we still have those scripts somewhere?

For install parties it is a bit too slow to install from the net, or 
from USB.

So I wanted to simply take a given TL10 installation from a windows and 
transfer it to another.

As far as I know, one would then only have to add a script to integrate 
it into windows, (given that the location was the same on both computers).

Then the installation is down to the transfer time from a USB stick, 
which is a lot better.

(Yesterday we started a weekly LaTeX Lab here where I work, and at the 
beginning we will spend most of the time helping users to install TL, so 
the faster the better).

It's not.  We used to ship it as part of BibDesk, and it was fast 
on my 500 MHz G3 (a PowerPC).

It was not my complain - I simply reproduced it mistakenly thinking
that it was a part of TL distribution. And I just checked on my office
G4: fast

Sorry, I don't know anything about such tools but I wonder why you
borther about installation?

AFAIU, you could install TL on Windows machine and export (share) the
path with installed TL over the net or install TL on linux host with
several platforms and export using samba the TL for windows machines. Or
just copy the whole root (for example, if you install TL in C:\texlive,
so there are C:\texlive\2010, C:\texlive\texmf-local) to other windows
machine. The only thing left: you have to register (associate) the tex
extension with texworks (seems this is one of the actions that windows
installer do in contrast to linux one) manually.

On my work I installed TL on linux and binaries for Windows, then
"share" the installation root over the net (using samba) and tried them
on Windows (Windows 7). All work fine (actually I tried not all
binaries, only (pdf)latex, dvips, pdfinfo).

What would happen in these circumstances if, for example,
a DVI driver detected a missing PK and decided to build it
from the MF sources ?  Where would the resulting PK try
to go : somewhere on the local machine, or somewhere
on the server ?

Reading section 4 (Network Installations) at
http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-430004
suggests to me that you could install texlive on one machine in, say, 
C:\texlive and then copy that directory in its entirety to whatever 
machine you want.  So long as the directory containing binaries is in 
the path it should all work.

(caveat: I don't use windows, but this does work for Linux)

Of course, just copying the source folder doesn't install the start menu 
stuff, but I think that can be handled using the w32client installer 
mentioned at the above link (or directly from
http://tug.org/texlive/w32client.html)

I think PK files (and so on) are written to $TEXMFSYSVAR (somewhere in 
the texlive tree -- on the server) and if that is not writable, then to 
$TEXMFVAR (in the user's home directory)

as far as I understand it this takes care of adding stuff to menus, 
adding desktop icons and adding stuff to the registry.

On the local machine.  The old installer (older than TL-2008) had an
option to share generated pk fonts.  We dropped it for several
reasons.  Most important, a directory which is writable by everybody
might be a potential security risk.  At least people can abuse it in
order to circumvent quotas.  Also, I don't think the file permissions
used there are supported by Windows.

Nowadays bitmap fonts are used very rarely and computers are fast
enough to create them almost instantaneously when needed.  

If someone wants to share generated pk files, he can still edit
texmf.cnf, but I suppose that most administrators don't want.

Regards,
  Reinhard

OK, but the original scenario installed everything on
the server, so there would be no local equivalent of
TEXMF<whatever>, nor would the user have had any
say in where TEXMF<whatever> went, so might this
lead to said innocent user getting PKs installed
on his C: drive even though he/she otherwise
reserves C: solely for Windows and other official
Microsoft stuff, and would prefer to have his/her
PKs on D: or wherever ?

Reading the w32client2010 script would help ... I had to do it myself ;-)
And the same with the tlmgr man page

Adding the binary dir to the sarch path	
	tlmgr path add		(with optional --w32mode=user or admin)
Adding the shortcuts for several programs
	tlmgr postaction install shortcut dviout.win32 texworks texlive-en tlpsv.win32
(all with option --w32mode)

Adding file associations
	tlmgr postaction install fileassoc dviout.win32 tlpsv.win32 texworks.win32
with options --w32mode, --fileassocmode

Run xetex postaction script:
	tlmgr postaction install script xetex
(with optional ....)


That should get you going.

With the w32client2010 script you get in addition an entry in the
uninstall program section, and an additional shortcut with
TeX Live Prompt.

Reading the man page of tlmgr would give you also the options
	tlmgr path add
	tlmgr postaction install shortcut --all
	tlmgr postaction install fileassoc --all
	tlmgr postaction install script --all
which should do the same, more or less.

I think it has been there more or less from the start.

 From running tlmgr --help (on linux with perldoc installated)

         path [--w32mode=user|admin] [add|remove]

         On Unix adds or removes symlinks for binaries, man pages, and 
info pages in the directories specified by the respective options (see 
above).

         On Windows, the registry part where the binary directory is 
added or removed is determined in the following way:

         If the user has admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is not 
given, the setting w32_multi_user determines the location (i.e., if it 
is on then
         the system path, otherwise the user path is changed).

         If the user has admin rights, and the option "--w32mode" is 
given, this option determines the path to be adjusted.

         If the user does not have admin rights, and the option 
"--w32mode" is not given, and the setting w32_multi_user is off, the 
user path is changed,
         while if the setting w32_multi_user is on, a warning is issued 
that the caller does not have enough privileges.

         If the user does not have admin rights, and the option 
"--w32mode" is given, it must be user and the user path will be 
adjusted. If a user without
         admin rights uses the option "--w32mode admin" a warning is 
issued that the caller does not have enough provileges.

         postaction [--w32mode=user|admin] [--fileassocmode=1|2] [--all] 
[install|remove] [shortcut|fileassoc|script] [pkg]...

         Carry out the postaction "shortcut", "fileassoc", or "script" 
given as the second required argument in install or remove mode (which 
is the first
         required argument), for either the packages given on the 
command line, or for all if "--all" is given.

         The option "--w32mode" is "user" all actions will only carried 
out in the user accessible parts of the registry/filesystem, while the 
"admin" mode
         selects the system wide parts of the registry for the file 
associations.  Note that if you do not have enough permissions using 
"--w32mode=admin"
         will not succeed.

         For the postaction "fileassoc" the mode can be set with 
"--fileassocmode".  If it is set to 1, only new assocations are added, 
if it is set to 2,
         all associations are set to the TeX Live programs.

hmm, seems one need some steps to make this easier.

I'm just trying to copy C:/texlive to a USB stick, laptop tells me that 
will take it some 3 hours to complete, need to copy some 100k files).

Might be better to make a rar archive and provide unpacking tools on the 
USB sticks.

In that case I used a tar archive :). Really some time ago I had to
install TL on two platform (windows and linux) that temporary didn't
have access to the Internet, so I downloaded at home the whole TL
(sorry, actually I do rsync) make a tar archive copy it on USB stick and
copy from stick to the temp directory.

Of course I could do the same procedure with installed TL root, it would
only take a time to
 - make an archive
 - copy it on USB (very long but seems less than to copy each signle
   files)
 - copy archive from USB stick
 - untar (install or do postactions as Norbet said).

If the machines on which TL is installed have network access to 'master'
machine it would be much faster to copy over local net to that machines.

On that Windows machine in %USERPROFILE% was create .texlive2010
directory. Is it enough information? IMHO, may be ten-twenty years ago
the use of already generated PK fonts on server by clients were benefit
but now it is not.

The idea with that server was to have ONE place to store 'main' files
(and I wouldn't specify what I mean 'main', it is more or less clear),
binaries while user generated files (MF, TFM, PK) should be on they
machines.

Of course, if server already has MF/TFM/PK files then clients could only
benefit it (though it is job of sys admin to have that files but this is
details).

Files owned by users are installed under TEXMFHOME, TEXMFVAR, and
TEXMFCONFIG.  Where this is can be configured at install time.  By
default these directories are in %USERPROFILE% on Windows.

If you install TL one a local machine, you can instruct the installer
to create them on drive D:.  But if you install TL on a server, you
have to consider that drive D: is not necessarily a partition of a
hard disc on all client machines.  The default location must be a
directory which always exists and is writable by the user.  This is
usually $HOME on Unix and %USERPROFILE% on Windows.

Users still can set environment variables on local machines, though
IMO this is not advisable unless they exactly know what they are
doing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Very likely. But since it was compiled by me and I have no idea what to
do about it, complaining about its being improperly compiled while
potentially cathartic is unlikely to be productive.

Yes. It is simply easier to find the information in some other way.
Unless one does not mind waiting hours, perhaps. All three programmes
are essentially unusable for all practical purposes.

The version on my machine is from poppler 0.8.3. I compiled it from
source. This does not apply to any version on anybody else's machine.
But as far as any improper compilation of this particular version is
concerned, I am wholly responsible for my own predicament. (If it is a
bug in the source rather than improper compilation or a bug in OS X,
I'm not responsible for the problem though I am still responsible for
the compilation.) Any and all attempts to assign responsibility
elsewhere are misguided, however well intentioned.

Since the other programs are also slow, it's possible that the problem
is related to a shared library.  But I have no idea how to track it
down.

If you compile a program yourself using the commands proposed in the
INSTALL file (usually ./configure && make && make install), and it
doesn't work, there is nothing wrong to send a bug report.

However, your version of poppler seems to be quite old and it's very
unlikely that anybody fixes bugs in software which is already
released.  Thus it's better to try the latest development release.

Another thing you could try is to install xpdf.  If you don't need
xpdf itself, you can run

./configure --with-x=no

and then you get:

configure: WARNING: Couldn't find X
configure: WARNING: Couldn't find Motif
configure: WARNING: -- You will be able to compile pdftops, pdftotext,
        pdfinfo, pdffonts, and pdfimages, but not xpdf or pdftoppm

which is certainly ok for you.

Regards,
  Reinhard

You can add c:/mytexstuff// to TEXINPUTS.programname
in the texmf.cnf, like
TEXINPUTS.latex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//;c:/mytexstuff//

The easiest way may be to define an environment variable
TEXINPUTS=c:/mytexstuff//;
Don't forget the semicolon.

why can't we just add

TEXINPUTS=c:/mytexstuff//;

to texmf.cnf?

If this is so complicated, I'd recommend adding a better interface for
this to the tlmgr TODO list. This is one of the features I like in MikTeX.

We recommend TL to all our users because then we know they have exactly
the same tools (more or less)

the env stuff works, but I could not get adding anything to texmf.cnf to
work.

tlmgr conf texmf TEXINPUTS 'c:/mytexstuff//;'

As a mantra: reading the man page of tlmgr helps.

I think the current recommended best practice is not to touch TEXINPUTS
at all, there is already local texmf tree(s) where users can put their
stuff.

most users will not even know where to look for those, doesn't one need 
to refresh the filename database afterwards.

Again much more complicated than the MikTeX approach.

just tested this on Win7

it added the line

TEXINPUTS = 'c:/mytexstuff//;'

to texmf.cnf

starting a new dosprompt and searching for mypack.sty which is in 
c:/mytexstuff

did not give any results.

but using

tlmgr conf texmf TEXINPUTS c:/mytexstuff//;

did work

You can just drop stuff in ~/texmf and kpathsea will find it.

I don't know what MikTeX approach is, but I just read recently that
TEXINPUTS can break all sorts of things and should be left alone.

MikTeX has a simple an intuitive interface to add more 'TeX roots' to 
MikTeX, i.e. more places to look for files. I have no idea what it does 
at conf level, just that it is very easy to explain to users and for 
them to add extra stuff.

Why doesn't he simply copy his files where they belong?

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFHOME

This is documented already.

See chapter 3 in the documentation of kpathsea. Remember that you may
have several files of the same name in different directories and
kpathsea selects the proper one according to format and engine. That's
why you cannot just set the generic TEXINPUT in texmf.cnf while the
specific TEINPUT.something is defined. It is not necesary to start a
new dosprompt after modifying texmf.cnf.

no - maybe only at firts time then you create a new TeX-root

If you change the files inside any exisitng TeX-root you have to refresh

GUI for iteself is not a guarantee for not beeing confused! Word2007 has
a mighty GUI ;-)

Is this true ?  I thought that it emerged in an earlier
thread that files directly placed in <whatever>/texmf
are not found, and that they have to be placed in
some sub-directory thereof.

You are right, I was oversimplifying.

But does MikTeX ignore the directory structure?

Here you could find advice about TEXINPUTS:
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=tempinst
and here
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=privinst
is, may be, the awnser to your real question.

If have in mind only LaTeX:
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=installthings

Below is mine attempt to answer to your question.

First, you have to advice to use directory structure (you may use
different illustrations for this principle).

Assume that user use file 'worksA.tex' for plain TeX and wrote
his/her own package 'workB.sty' (may be just combining other
standard ones). Where he/she should put that files? The answer:
see TDS. But if very simple then we have following:
1. DON'T put all of them into
    C:\mytexstuff

2.1 Place plain TeX stuff in
    C:\mytexstuff\tex\plain
in the example
    C:\mytexstuff\tex\plain\works\workA.tex

2.2 Place LaTeX stuff in
    C:\mytexstuff\tex\latex
in the example
    C:\mytexstuff\tex\latex\works\workB.sty

Of course instead of 'works' user should use more
descriptive (for him/her) name.

2.3 If some files could be used in plain TeX and in LaTex
place them into
    C:\mystufftex\tex\generic

This is more or less the same as in FAQ.

Now how tex/latex will find them.

The most easy is to use TEXMFHOME.

Create in HOME or USERPROFILE directory 'texmf' (private!)
and put all stuff there (so in above change C:\mytexstuff to
TEXMFHOME, by default on linux TEXMFHOME=$HOME/texmf,
I assume that on Windows TEXMFHOME = %USERPROFILE%/texmf but I
didn't check!). That's all! You even don't need to run any
'hashing' procedure because tex will search TEXMFHOME every
time (in contrast to TEXMF, for which only 'database' file
is used, though this is configurable).

Okey, then where to put files that will be used for several
users?

Use TEXMFLOCAL. Of course you have to run 'texconfig-sys rehash'
(will rehash all trees).

If you still want to place 'all my stuff as is and I want that
tex find it' then shoot in your foot :) Really.
Begin organize your files, spend time for it.

So, remember, that you always have HOME/USERPROFILE, so you always
have TEXMFHOME, put stuff there but organize them!

(You could test moving your stuff into TEXMFHOME and if this works
leave them there but don't complain after that).

I have some doubts that adding something to TEXINPUTS is the
equivalent to the miktex interface. Miktex knows also TEXINPUTS but
it isn't meant to add a complete root. 

At my opinion you are looking for a way to add C:\mytexstuff (which
should be a TDS) as a new root to e.g. TEXMFLOCAL.

to me adding something like the miktex interface would be favorable what 
ever it is that it does.

useful for users to place some of their own common stuff.

Personally I don't like placing stuff inside the texlive tree, too easy 
to forget that it is there if one if switching to say miktex and want to 
just delete what ever texlive is on the system.

Many of the users I see today do not know much about computers, so 
telling them to set an environment variable is an almost impossible task.

Not only for this. The miktex interface is also useful to add
temporarly a package, e.g. a beta version of something: I simply
unpack the tds.zip, add it as a root and remove or move it down if
it is no longer needed. Currently microtype-beta is in such a root.

TEXMFHOME is not inside texlive tree, its location should be somewhere
in the user's home (or whatever Windows equivalent of it is).

You don't need to set any variables if you placed the files where
kpathsea expects them; TEXMFHOME is already set.

What I meant is that Lars would like to add an additional root to
TEXMFLOCAL. E.g. As miktex hadn't luatex until last month I used for
some time the luatex from w32tex.org in a minimal texmf. In the
texmf.cnf I had e.g. a setting

TEXMFLOCAL    =
I:/TeX-Roots/UFlocaltexmf,I:/TeX-Roots/winfonts,I:/TeX-Roots/biblatex-beta

(the actual roots varied, many of them where added only temporarly).

As I remember, Lars mentioned 'simply users'.

In the meantime, very special things were discussed.

Could we move back to the main problem? What sort of problem 'simply
users' are confronted with which could not be solved putting files in
localtexmf?

Presumably you mean texmfhome? Which has the advantage that no
filename database needs updating.

I advise very inept users just to keep extra stylefiles with the
documents which need them because I see no way to make them
understand the TDS.

Well no. Adding a complete texmf-tree is what the miktex interface
does and Lars was asking how this could be done. I did it by adding
the root to the variable TEXMFLOCAL

As an example: On http://xetex.tk/ there is a microtype.tds.zip with
a beta version of microtype. In miktex I simply unpackage the zip,
add the root folder as a new root
(http://docs.miktex.org/2.8/manual/localadditions.html#id574074) and
use it. When I no longer need it I remove the root. 

In similar way I (and other miktex users) have used
beta/cvs-versions of biblatex, pgf (big package), beamer (also big
package), koma-script and others.

You don't have to copy a lot of files if you want to add a package,
and you don't have to delete a lot of files if you want to remove
it.

wheres's the problem to use localtexmf?

Sorry, but I don't understand you :-(

    What I meant is that Lars would like to add an additional root to
    TEXMFLOCAL. 

This whole "root" thing is MikTeX terminology (which I have no real
understanding of, I just blindly include your text on my web pages,
Ulrike :).

In TeX Live (tetex, texk, web2c), TEXMFLOCAL is a directory.  One
directory.  You can't "add a root" to it.  Presumed to be arranged in a
TDS hierarchy.  Ditto TEXMFHOME -- it's one directory.

It would be possible to add and remove arbitrary directories to the TL
definition of TEXMF, which by default is:
TEXMF =
{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

I'm sure you'll understand that it is far from a simple thing to
arrange.

Even more complicated would be not requiring any particular subdirectory
structure in the directories.  That would mean changing every
definition in texmf.cnf.  Right now, for instance, we have:

TEXINPUTS.latex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//

Thus, adding anything to TEXMF is going to require latex input files to
be somewhere under a directory named "tex" in the "root" dir.  So, as
far as I can see, if we don't want to require the "tex/" subdir level,
this would mean definitions like:

TEXINPUTS.latex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//;$TEXMF_FLAT_DIR_ROOTS//

(I just made up the name off the top of my head, obviously.)
Something to ponder ...

    which normal LaTeX user know about texmfhome?

Can you please not quote 50 tangled lines for a one line question?

And, this argument is pointless.  If a LaTeX user does not know about
TEXMFHOME, they will not know about any other facilities we provide in
the future, either.  We cannot provide a telepathy mode, sorry.

Hi Lars,

    telling them to set an environment variable is an almost impossible task.

Yes, I understand.  They don't have to set an environment variable.  And
in fact we always recommend against setting (any) environment variables,
especially for new users.

What they have to do is use the predefined tree for this, which is
~/texmf, where ~ on Windows is $USERPROFILE, the usual place for such
things (as I understand it).

However, as I explained in my previous message, they do have to use
subdirectories, and I completely understand that that is a significant
barrier for these "naive" users.  All I can say is, perhaps it will be
supported in the future.  I hope my message was clear as to why it is
not trivial to do so.

Expecting to be able to use your own arbitrary directory to find
arbitrary things is already a nontrivial task, and if "naive" users
expect to be able to do so, well, sorry, their expectations are
unrealistic.

Normal LaTeX users coauthor papers with others, who may have their

the problem with using localtexmf is the tds.  we occasionally hear a
distressed person who's put foobar.sty in localtexmf, and latex doesn't
see it -- they've put it in localtexmf rather than
localtexmf/tex/latex/foobar ... and this is a common problem.

ulrike points out that the problem is solved by .tds.zip files, but
they're not particularly common.  (on ctan, 155 latex macro packages
exist as .tds.zip, of 1226 -- at the level of a crude scan.)

sure, it's great if a developer provides a .tds.zip of a beta version,
making life for miktex users really neat.  but it doesn't actually help
the tex live user, much: they've still to uninstall by surgery on a
tree.

some do -- if they've a sys-admin who's had to sort them out.

of course, texmfhome is a snare and a delusion for those of us whose
home directory is stored on an nfs server: people *keep* claiming that
you don't need an ls-r file for texmfhome -- which is tosh, in this
case.

*every* case of dire tex performance at my place of work has arisen from
a large localtexmf with no ls-r (really!)

not the only one -- i detect a good proportion before you're troubled

the problem with out-of-date ones would be caught automatically (and
dealt with by me) before you were bothered by them, if the arrangement
of the time zones were different.  mostly.

Hi,
people ask for new features again and again though they don't make
the slightest attempt to read the documentation in order to find out
what TeX Live provides already.

As far as I understand Lars, his problem is that he can't expect from
his users that they are aware of TEXMFHOME.  Then Norbert said that
tlmgr already provides facilities to add an extra texmf tree, but Lars
can't expect from his users to run tlmgr --help.  Sure, Norbert can
add new features to tlmgr and Lars will tell us that his users aren't
aware of them...

  ...\expandafter\recurse\fi

Is it reasonable then to add new features only because people aren't
aware of what already exists?  IMO new features should be added only
if things can't be done with the system as it is, and *not* because
people are unable/unwilling to read documentation.

It was mentioned how easy everything is with MikTeX.  Yes, everything
is easier indeed because it's a single-user system.  There is *one*
user and *one* configuration file.

TeX Live is a multi-user system and usually a mortal user can't modify
the system-wide texmf.cnf file.  I'm wondering why people mentioned
TEXMFLOCAL in this thread at all.  The appropriate directory for
per-user data is TEXMFHOME.

What I absolutely don't understand is the recommendation to set an
environment variable (adding a new texmf tree) instead of simply copy
the files to TEXMFHOME.  Sigh, I'm aware that many Windows users are
unable to copy files from one directory to another one, but on the
other hand I know how painful it is to explain someone how to set
environment variables on this ever so user-friendly operating system.

Ulrike mentioned an interesting problem: Someone installs a
TDS-compliant ZIP file and wants to remove it later.  I don't think
that an extra texmf tree is needed.  The ZIP file contains the
information where to put files, the same information can be used to
remove the files.

A few days ago I had exactly this problem in mind and wrote such an
uninstaller.  It was designed for .tar.gz files but it can be adapted
for ZIP files easily.  See the code below.  It's written in texlua, so
I'm sure it works under MikTeX as well.

  Reinhard

[...]
> which normal LaTeX user know about texmfhome?
So I suggest instead of 'Install ...' (parties) provide an excursion
to TeX Live eco-system (I really don't understand what 'eco-system'
means :). For example, try to explain briefly the directory structure,
why it so, how to put private files and most important WHERE.

If MikTeX has such feature it doesn't mean that average user know about
it or how to use it (I mean the purpose, advantages and disadvantages).
Also please note that MikTeX is NOT TDS complain TeX distribution!

(I have colleagues that came to MikTeX after emtex and they didn't think
that miktex has user-friendly interface, many new users even don't know
what "TeX roots" means, they're simply latex users, they want to typeset
documents but not to know about directory the strcture, if they need help
I always can help them but I always explain why they should in that way
not another).

What you want is already in TeX Live, (texmflocal and texmfhome). If an
user don't know about them they should read the manual (!) (Off-topic:
most modern techinal devices are very complicated so before use it an
user have to read MANUAL, do you read them? Then what's wrong with TeX
Live? Why one shouldn't read MANUAL? If something it not in manual or
one want something special the ML and CTT are good places to ask).

@Ulrike Fichser: your example is much more far from 'an average
user practice', IMO, but even for you purpose the TL is capable (after
reading the documentation).

Actually you example is very interesting. I don't try but I think that
anyone could define its own TEXMF tree (for example TEXMFLOCAL2, not the
TEXMF variable as in texmf.cnf) and add it to TEXMF _variable_ in
texmf.cnf.

P.S. For me this thread is good point and source for new topic in FAQ to
to expand existed topic in FAQ, if users read it.

Though I all for reading manual, I don't think this is going to change
any time soon; when I first used a computer (like 5 years ago or
something) people would usually be surprised that I actually read the
instructions written in dialogue boxes (we are not even talking about
manuals) and would sincerely advice me to just click next next next and
the magic would happen. So though I don't see much that texlive can do
to help here, apart from what it already offers, I sympathise with Lars
here.

Robin, I have to apologize.  Of course, there had to be an ls-R file
for TEXMFHOME as long as teTeX/TeX Live exists.  

I proposed to remove TEXMFHOME from TEXMFDBS some time ago in order to
circumvent a stupid bug in fmtutil.  This was just a quick and dirty
workaround, not meant as a solution.

Today everybody regards it as a feature but I'm convinced that it was
a big mistake.  If someone reports a similar bug in the future, I'll
definitely shut up.

And I have about 20 of these separate trees, which I graft or stash into texmflocal, and stash -d or graft -d to remove.

This problem has been solved about soooo many years ago, nobody needs to write anything new.

All asking for that please search for stash, graft or so.

miktex _is_ less easy to deal with, in a "raw" sort of way.  but if you
factor in what it does for you, you find it's better overall.  imo.

in both places, there are many people who'll tell you not even to try,
but to do what you want in a quite different (and often more elliptical,
though "standard") way.

it may be out of the ordinary, but it seems a neat trick for what she's
doing.

no need; assuming the person in question is happy with setting up an
environment variable for TEXMFHOME (or something).

i've had the idea in mind, and tbh, i'm not sure i've seen anything
useful i could add.  i would welcome any direct suggestion (indeed any
suggestion about anything).

(are there other people out there writing faqs?  i know there's a german
and a french one, but i never see announcements, so don't know if
they're under development.  i could subscribe to lists, but though i
read french quite fluently i really struggle with german and russian,
both of which i supposedly also "know".)

No. Since version 2.7 Miktex is a multiuser system -- or more
precisely: you can install it so (I have installed it as single
user).  Like in TeXLive the admin tools exist in "user mode" and
"admin mode". The equivalent of e.g. updmap-sys is initexmf --admin
--mkmaps.

Well "root" is simply the root folder of a TDS-compliant directory.

Well no. TEXMFLOCAL is a variable. Like TEXMF. The content of this
variable can be the path of the root of _one_ texmf-tree, but -- as
it is the case of TEXMF -- it can also point to more than one
texmf-tree. 

> One directory.  You can't "add a root" to it. 

Well certainly I can. I did it and it worked fine, my home made
luatex could used the various texmf-trees without problems.

But this is the interface miktex provides: In the GUI you see a list
of the actual texmf-trees. You can add a new one, move them up and
down (not every order is possible, the order of the trees installed
by miktex is fixed), and you can remove local roots. To use a Linux
wording: You can mount and unmount texmf-trees.

This is not asked for. miktex will complain if a directory is "not a
TDS-compliant root" is you try to "mount" an arbitrary folder. And
files will not be found if their are not in the correct
TDS-subfolder.

Well the last year I talk quite a lot of rather unexperienced TeX

It takes more time to install large packages when you have to copy
files and it's more error-prone. It's also more difficult to clean
up if all your local packages are in the same texmf-tree. Assume
that you have installed pgf 2.0 in your localtexmf and now 2.1 is
official and can be installed with tlgmr. How do you remove the 2.0?
How do tell the unexperienced TeX-user to uninstall it? 

I install such large packages simply in a texmf-tree "texmf-pgf20",
mount this tree and when I no longer need it, unmount. I don't need
to delete anything. If for a reason I need suddendly pgf 2.0 back I
can simply mount its tree again.

Also for me it is easy to transport local packages to another
miktex: I simply copy the trees to a stick and then mount the trees
as a whole. 

And the use of more than one localtexmf allows me to keep my real
"local" packages, my own packages apart.

I realize that we have different 'unexperienced users' in mind.

I'm teaching LaTeX for pupils at a german 'gymnasium' for years and
never things like whose you describe have to be solved. In my mind these

Robin, now I see that

http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=elsevier

it was removed from CTAN (not just from TL) and it looks to be
replaced(?) by elsarticle

However my question was not about this particular class. After Khaled
pointed out how one can access in svn changed classes/packages in TL
and realize what has been changed, the natural question is if there
are any resources showing removal of packages (except tlmgr.log on my
computer).

Any sysadmin would not be very happy to have a couple of users
screaming "bloody murder! what did you do with my favourite
package!!!!" without knowing the answer "Elsevier pulled it off and
replaced by elsarticle".

Use
  tlmgr update --list
first, and maybe then add 
  --no-auto-remove
?

Norbert, I know this (and actually preview updates). But let us look
for a sysadmin. --no-auto-remove will put the package in question on
the life support on his host. OK, no screaming users today. Then
sysadmin updates to TL2011 and a dozen (or more) of packages
disappears in one shot. Then he gets a BIG crowd.

TL generally follows the recommendation of package authors.  It would be a huge
task to provide a complete database of author-driven changes.   In my view the
priority should be to implement author-driven changes, but it is also
nice to give
notice of changes that may be "surprising".   When TL implements a change
from a major publisher that was announced some time ago, the people who use
the package (e.g., who publish in one of the affected journals) should not be
surprised.  The fact that many authors read the "instructions to
authors" no more
than once is not something TL can solve.

It is all to easy for TeX users to become overly reliant on packagers when they
should be reading the "instructions to authors" at publisher's sites.

Yes -- it comes with the job.   My first response in such cases is that
TL is usually reliable about tracking changes from upstream and look
to upstream for the changes that have become visible in TL.   In cases
where there is real need for the old package (e.g., article originally prepared
using the old package and undergoing minor revisions prior to publication)
I would suggest installing the package outside TL to reduce changes that
others may use it and encounter problems down the road.

Following up on my own thread

We have the following situation

a dir names, say d:/foo/bar which is the root of a TDS structure

if I do

tlmgr conf texmf TEXINPUTS d:/foo/bar//;

and then

kpsewhich myclass.cls

I get the reply

but if I try to compile

\documentclass{myclass}
\begin{document}

latex cannot find myclass.cls

WTF?! (pardon my language)

I was under the impression if kpsewhich can find a file, then latex can 
as well.

What is going on here?

For articles currently being written, the authors should obey the 
instructions to authors and use the journal's current package.  But there's 
a big backward compatibility issue.  E.g., there are many older papers on
arXiv.org.  When a widely used package is deleted from CTAN and TL, these
papers are no longer compilable without the source files being edited.

To see the scale of the problem, I googled for "elsart.cls" in
site:arxiv.org and got over 1900 hits.  (Elsart.cls is one of the class
files in the now-removed elsevier package.)

It seems to me that a good policy is that a widely used package should
normally remain on CTAN (and TL) even when obsolete.

"texdoc kpathsea" might lead you to try:

latex -kpathsea-debug=3  ...

Given a sufficiently large scrollback buffer you should find something like:

kdebug:hash_lookup(TEXINPUTS.latex) => .:$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//

That was OK back when you only had to worry about tex vs latex, but now you
have context, luatex, etc. so more risk of name clashes.

On a Mac, you would need something like (all one line):

$ tlmgr conf texmf TEXINPUTS.latex
'.:<somewhere>/foo/bar/tex/latex//:$TEXMF/tex/{latex,generic,}//'

No idea what quotes you need in Windows.

Thanks to all the people who provided suggestions regarding my unusably
slow copies of pdftotext, pdfinfo etc. I now have *two* versions of
these tools which work admirably quickly. (At least, pdftotext does.)

In case anybody is interested, one of these is installed from xpdf.
This compiled relatively easily. (I didn't want to use the binaries
because I would have lost xpdf itself.)

The second is from an updated compile of poppler. This is more
problematic both because I'm worried about what might be depending on
poppler and because compiling it turned out to be a considerable pain.
I suspect I may have broken gimp... More specifically, compiling the
recommended openjpeg turned out to be far from straight forward. But the
resulting pdftotext does seem to work. The trick, for anybody who reads
this and decides to experiment is to download the two patch files for
openjpeg provided by macports.  (You don't have to use macports to use
their patch files, fortunately.)

[I sometimes wonder why the amendments found necessary by the macports
people never seem to make it back upstream. This is especially true in
this case where one of the two files requiring a patch is specific to
mac os x/darwin. Neither of the patches have anything to do with
macports specifically. They are just what's needed to get it to compile
on os x. In any case, I wasted a lot of time before thinking to check
for macports patches.]

Having done all this, I'm not convinced this is the best way to get an
accurate word count. The output from the xpdf version of pdftotext is
strange and includes many non-ascii character codes. (For example, it
seems unable to deal with ligatures.) The output from the poppler
version is definitely more readable. Even so, it isn't that suitable
for word count purposes as it includes, for example, the header, footer
and page number from each page. Especially in a draft, I have quite a
lot of information in the footer so the repetition of this per page
would skew the word count considerably.

It also includes the references. I'm honestly not certain if these are
meant to be counted or not so I'm not sure whether to consider this a
feature or a bug.

I suspect texcount is giving me a more accurate count than any of the
other methods right now though it is hard to be certain about this.

Best,
cfr

see my point in as to how difficult this is? and how confusing this will 
be for users? or for people coming from MikTeX to TL

I mean TL is great, and I recommend it to all our users, but it might be 
a bit better some make some areas a bit more userfriendly.

Another example is the graphical tlmgr, the long list of packages and 
collections seem to confuse a lot of the new users we see at the moment. 
If possible, it might be an idea to look into a tab based design and 
then hide this list.

To many single user installations all the users need is a button 
equivalent to

tlmgr update --all

and perhaps one the might do

tlmgr update --all



BTW:

if I on win7 starts a new dosprompt, and then run

tlmgr --help

I get a long text, but the dosprompt will not let me scroll all the way 
back to the start of the text, so basically tlmgr --help is not quite 
helpful on win7 unless one knows | more

You mean

 tlmgr update  --self

Two "tlmgr update --all" buttons would cause "Buridan ass dilemma" and
mass confusion and may be even a flame war between left and right
buttoners :-)

Or unless one knows how to configure the properties of
the CMD window.  But in general I completely agree with you.

no actually I meant --list in the last case

Incidentally I just ran

tlmgr -gui

on my Ubuntu

Hit 'Update all installed'

it loaded the DB gave me a message that it needed to update itself and 
would I please press 'Update all installed' again.

Behind the list was reduced to the infra update, and then the graphical 
tlmgr crashed

luckily for me I started from a terminal, so I got the

Please update the package manager first, via either
   tlmgr update --self

message

(don't know if the infra update was to fix some of this...)

Isn't 'Update all installed' a misleading name? it does exactly the same 
as tlmgr update --all

but that include auto-removing packages, updating packages and 
installing new packages

not something I associate with the term 'Update all installed'

Though I do not currently have a better term for it.

Let's add many new features to tlmgr...

Suppose tlmgr pipes its output directly into more, how should your
users know how to get out of this program?

And maybe TeX, Metafont, Metapost, and all the other programs should
provide log files in HTML on Windows.

I came from emTeX in OS/2 through teTeX in OS/2 to TL in Linux. It was
quite easy because I read the manuals.

Message-ID: <186042F9-21CD-491A-AD86-B6112585989C@mac.com>

I've noticed that tlmgr is spawning wget processes on my system when downloading updates.  I'm using Mac OS X, 10.6.4, MacTeX 2010, latest tlmgr:

$ tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 20243 (2010-10-29 06:03:40 +0200)
tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2010

Here's the command I tried, with debug output enabled (I snipped the rest, which is basically a long list of packages).  In spite of passing --persistent-downloads explicitly, it ends up using wget.  I've noticed this on a couple of different systems, with multiple mirrors, so it seems fairly consistent.  Has something changed in this regard recently?

Hi,

> Behind the list was reduced to the infra update, and then the graphical tlmgr crashed

Was there any error message on the terminal *after* the onfo "...please run ..."?

After that, was an update to texlive.infra still available?

If not it seems that the update was success and the gui didn't crash, but terminated itself without giving an information msg, which is bad.

Please provide details if possible!

Hi Lars,

Are you sur Miktex allows dropping files into arbitrary dirs, also direct into the root of a texmf tree?

> I mean TL is great, and I recommend it to all our users, but it might be a bit better some make some areas a bit more userfriendly.

Of course, but this "some areas" is so as we say wishywashy.

What are the areas? Be specific with explanation of where miktex is friendly!

The example of adding additional roots is a good example and I will ponder upon it.

>  tlmgr, the long list of packages and collections seem to confuse a lot of the new users we see at the moment.

You moght switch from Expert mode to normal mode in the menu, which makes it less scary.

Other things might come, depending on my time.

BTW, in case --persistent-downloads doesn't work by design with --list (TLPDB.pm comments imply that wget is always used), note that it also isn't working with an actual update action, either:

$ sudo /usr/texbin/tlmgr -v --repository http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet/ --machine-readable --persistent-downloads update answers

The TLDownload seems to be created (new is called), but in TLUtils.pm

if (defined($::tldownload_server) && $::tldownload_server->enabled)

seems to be false the first time it's called, and there's no debug message in that case.  Skipping the condition, I get a message that it's retrying with wget, but I don't know enough perl to debug any of this properly :/.

No error message. The text in the terminal window was the same as I 
usually get when I use

tlmgr update --all

and there is an infra structure update.

I just ran tlmgr update --self in the terminal instead, finished just fine.

I do not have any information other than that

No, miktex doesn't allow this. If you mount a complete tds-tree and
you get another tds tree. All applications (latex, bibtex,
makeindex, ....) will find their files in this tree only if the
files are in the normal subfolders.

dear colleague I have a very strange problem developed with Texsho. Often the produced PDF file does not appear although in the windows panel it seems to exist. If I make a new document with new name then it may appear in the new document. If I do a "save as" it usually disappears.  I tried to repair the disk and similar actions to no avail. Any suggestions?

So then all the complains here boil down to the request:
	Please add a way to easily add another texmf tree to the 
	search path.
Right.

Well, as already said, that is something we might think about,
but it needs some internal discussion, of course.

Exactly. And did I got it right that TEXINPUTS is not the correct
variable for this? That Lars set you on the wrong track with its
initial question?

Right. There is already a way (easy?):
  tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFLOCAL '{/path/to/tree1;/path/to/tree2;...}'

The disadvantage here is that you have to have ls-R files (ie call
mktexlsr for all those trees) there.

But I just tried it now and it worked without a glitch.

So what is missing:
- more direct command line access to that
- a GUI
- a way to specify trees without ls-R searching (??? necessary?)

How is that handled in MikTeX?

Best wishes

;-) Well to quote my first answer to Lars: "At my opinion you are
looking for a way to add C:\mytexstuff (which should be a TDS) as a
new root to e.g. TEXMFLOCAL." For a non-TeXLive-user my guess wasn't
so bad.

> How is that handled in MikTeX?

When you add or remove a tree in miktex the FNDB's are regenerated.
In miktex every tree needs a FNDB. Also the FNDB's are not like in
texlive at the roots of the trees but alltogether in one tree.

I must say it would be an improvement if miktex would copy TeXLive
here and move the FNDB's to the trees they belong to, search (small
trees) without FNDB and allow to add a tree without having to
regenerate all FNDB's.

Howdy,

Could you substitute TEXMFHOME for TEXMFLOCAL above? Can that variable actually be a path or only a single directory.

In reality I think one shouldn't underestimate the ability of folks to learn a few things as long as you can make a short document that tells them something in a straight forward way; i.e., have a fixed TEXMFHOME and just tell them what directory structure they need to create.

Good Luck,

Hi Herbert,

> Could you substitute TEXMFHOME for TEXMFLOCAL above? Can that variable actually be a path or only a single directory.

Sure enough. But if you mess around then many things can break.

But if for example your users have their home directories in ~/texlib
(which we had in our department for long time), a simple
   tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME '~/texlive'
is enough.

And yes, TEXMFHOME can be any proper kpathsea path expression, like
   '~/{texmf,texlib}'
(just tried it and it works)

Thanks for the quick fix!  I noticed it while fixing some bugs of my
own in TLU :).  This also explains why a user was experiencing problems
due to a misconfigured ~/.wgetrc; it didn't seem reasonable that LWP
would read that file for proxy settings.

This is very strange, but I see that there seems to be an error in
the database wrt luainputenc, as we have this package but it is
not referenced in any collection, thus it was auto-removed.

But that seems to be  bug in svn rev 20372.

Karl, I re-added luainputenc to collection-luatex, if that was not
intended please revert that change.

Have you also thought about how the issues created by TLcontrib (or any other additional repository) could be solved? Imagine a network installation where one user wants the TLcontrib, but the other doesn't. Maybe we could have different roots for the users via user-specific texmf.cnf files, but I think at the moment we cannot have tlmgr download the files from the TLcontrib repo into a separate dist branch.

       purifyeps: No such file or directory (mpost.fmp)

The purifyeps man page says that mpost.fmp comes with pstoedit.
pstoedit is not included in TL and it hardly looks simple to do so.
Conceivably I could add mpost.fmp on its own, but that seems a bit scary
and hard to maintain.

So I guess purifyeps can't work in TL right now.  (I more or less just
blindly added it when it appeared.) 

Scott, any thoughts?

Providing per-user texmf.cnf files requires a change in kpathsea and
thus, all programs have to be re-compiled.

For binary packages as provided by TLcontrib it wouldn't work anyway,
and for scripts you need write permissions in the main tree in order
to create the required symlinks or wrappers.

I don't think we need solutions for problems which are constructed but
don't exist in practice.  Isn't the system already complex enough?

You said:

Imagine a network installation provides "scheme-full" and a particular
user wants "scheme-basic".

Isn't this the same "problem"?

That is not possible at the moment, but might be in future if I manage
to get tlmgr to be able to manage TEXMFHOME, too.

(BTW, if someone is interested in testing drop me a line)

No. tlcontrib has some beta testing packages before full release to TL,
so that is something not everyone wants.

user mode tlmgr is the answer.

mpost.fmp is necessary but not sufficient for purifyeps to run.
purifyeps really does rely on the complete pstoedit -- it's basically
not much more than a postprocessor for pstoedit's output.

I guess you have a few options:

   1) Remove purifyeps from TL.

   2) Include pstoedit in TL.  Why do you think it's not simple to do?
      It's GPLed and builds with a configure script (at least on
      Linux; I haven't tried it on any other platform).

   3) Keep purifyeps in TL but without pstoedit.  In this case I
      suppose I can tweak the code to first check for pstoedit and
      give a more user-friendly "Please install pstoedit" error
      message and pointer to www.pstoedit.net if it's not found.

Thank you for the explanation, but the problem still remains. On my 
Linux system "pstoedit" is installed, nevertheless I get the error

   purifyeps: No such file or directory (mpost.fmp)

The file "mpost.fmp" is in "/usr/share/pstoedit/". A directly call of 
"pstoedit" works:

   pstoedit -f "mpost" foo.eps  foo.mp

The version:

pstoedit -v
pstoedit: version 3.50 / DLL interface 108

What is wrong?

Or ability to install into $HOME/texmf. If someone want to use
'tlcontrib' (read: expreminental) one could use its $HOME/texmf (or
another 'temporary' texmf root/tree, as Ulrike suggested eariler) and
after testing remove them (of course this would be painful: a user have
to remember that he/she installs and where and a system administrator
should prepare to figure out problems with user installations and ML
take in mind that sittuation).

Anyway this is good idea, for testing, experimenting and if something is
broken (or urgent work in test period) one could switch off this tree
and use 'stable' TL.

That is what user-mode tlmgr is about. It manages TEXMFHOME, so you could
use
	tlmgr --user-mode --repo .... install testing-package
and it will be installed into your TEXMFHOME, and with remove it will be
removed.

As said, testers wanted.

Message-ID: <EA3FC38D-6052-4361-ACA6-D72E23CC4EA6@pnl.gov>

I've noticed a slight oddity in tlmgr's backup listing (Mac OS X, using tlmgr from today's tlcritical).  Available versions of some packages are listed multiple times.  For example, ltxmisc has

20188 (2010-11-08 17:57) 20088 (2010-10-25 14:01) 19964 (2010-10-25 08:12) 19851 (2010-10-25 08:12)

and repeats that 4 times.  In fact, there seems to be a pattern; if N backups are available, the list of 1-N is printed N times:

$ tlmgr restore ltxmisc
Available backups for ltxmisc: 20188 (2010-11-08 17:57) 20088 (2010-10-25 14:01) 19964 (2010-10-25 08:12) 19851 (2010-10-25 08:12) 20188 (2010-11-08 17:57) 20088 (2010-10-25 14:01) 19964 (2010-10-25 08:12) 19851 (2010-10-25 08:12) 20188 (2010-11-08 17:57) 20088 (2010-10-25 14:01) 19964 (2010-10-25 08:12) 19851 (2010-10-25 08:12) 20188 (2010-11-08 17:57) 20088 (2010-10-25 14:01) 19964 (2010-10-25 08:12) 19851 (2010-10-25 08:12)

       1) Remove purifyeps from TL.

That'd be ok by me.

       2) Include pstoedit in TL.  Why do you think it's not simple to do?

I realized later that "simple" wasn't the right word.  "Inappropriate"
is the right word :).  We (I) don't want to provide general-purpose
non-TeX-related binaries (except for a minimal set on Windows, not
relevant here); TL is not an operating system.  E.g., we don't want to
provide xpdf and its related utilities either.

   3) Keep purifyeps in TL but without pstoedit.  

I don't have any particular objection to that, either, if it can be made
to work -- see Rolf's follow-up that I just forwarded to you.

Thanks,
karl

Unfortunately, purifyeps doesn't know how to search your system to
find mpost.fmp.  Try telling it explicitly where to look:

    purifyeps --fontmap=/usr/share/pstoedit/mpost.fmp

Hi Karl,
I recently noticed that tex4ht depends on pstoedit already in order to
convert PostScript to SVG.  So I think that, as far as purifyeps is
concerned, it's best to keep it but issue an error message if pstoedit
isn't installed, just as Scott proposed.  On Linux it's quite easy to
install the pstoedit binary provided by the distribution.  Don't know
whether it's so easy on OS X too.

On Windows it would be nice to have a precompiled binary in TeX Live.  
But I suppose that it's not easy to provide one because it's linked
against some X11 libs and fontconfig.  So I'm not very optimistic.

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is the mailing list for TeX Live, a TeX distribution.
Your link points to a bug report for a LaTeX package `varioref'.
Why do you not address the author/maintainer of this package?

What do you think, a TeX distribution can do? Should it
remove the package in question, all buggy packages, LaTeX?

Yours sincerely

I compiled couple of days ago on two OSX 10.6.4 computers arch 64 and
arch 32. On the former was standard (but computer already had tons of
compiled libraries), on the latter I needed to recompile libiconv and
expat and copiy .la files from /usr/local/lib to /usr/lib (or one
could probably tackle it via source editing of pstoedit)

So, it may be straightforward but not necessarily.

Hi.

(First I decided to post a new message but thought that there were too
many posts on topic already.)

** Norbert Preining [2010-11-10 23:38:21 +0900]:

>>> user mode tlmgr is the answer.

I think there are three different request for feature.

1. Lars Madsen aksed how to add an user directory with tex files. The
  question raised because MikTeX (up to now?) don't provide any feature
  like TEXMFHOME that TL provides. So MikTeX user have to add _manually_
  that directory/ies in MikTex Options programm. Please note, this MikTeX
  "feature" is due to lack of MikTeX, TL always (AFAIR) provides was to
  use user directory.

  The answer fir Lars question is
  a) make sure that the directory is in TDS
  b) rename that directory to %USERPROFILE%/texmf (this is $HOME/texmf
  on Windows) or copy material to there.
  c) that's all

  Again: TL always advices to use TEXMFHOME for user files. THIS IS
  PREFERED WAY. MikTeX doesn't provide (up to now?) such possibility, SO
  USER HAVE TO ADD _MANUALLY_ THE DIRECTORY WITH THEY TEX FILES. This is
  important point. (Sorry for redundant upper case).

2. Ulrike Fischer requested absolutely another feature. She wants to
  have "temporary/experimental" texmf tree (root in mikTeX terminology)
  (is I right about that, Ulrike?) so user could add it for testing
  purpose/... and ability to disable it (remove from search path/DB, not
  from disk).
  IMHO, though TL already has such feature it don't provide
  "user-friendly" interface (user should either adjust TEXMFLOCAL or
  TEXMFHOME or add "custom" variable, say TEXMFUSER and add
  it to TEXMF in texmf.cnf).
  To summarize: for testing/experimenting/... it is good to have
  "user-friendly" interface to add user texmf directory [1].
  Ulrike already shown how to test: microtype package is in TDS and if
  one want to test package it is advisable to have separate directory
  (in TDS) and add itto search path (at beginning).

[1] Of course these "experimental" packages could go into TL in future
but before that there won't be TL package for them, even if there are
packages archive in TDS. This especially concerns if package not on CTAN
because it is very "experimental" but has TDS archive for it.

3. Norbert Preining riased another feature: suppose that there is
  multi-user installation and several users use it. Suppose user A want to
  use "stable"/"official" packages but user B want to
  test/experiment/... and want to install newer packages available, say in
  tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010. It is possible that some packages in
  tlcontrib could break "stable"/old ones (I mean gives errors or not
  desired result), so system-wide installation from tlcontrib (sorry,
  updating) is not advisable. The answer is user-mode tlmgr. User could
  install packages from tlcontrib in TEXMFHOME (and then should maintain
  this tree oneself, run tlmgr in user-mode again and remove
  "experimental" files then omes come into "official" TL).

There were presented three different request and I think that only last
two need changes in tlmgr (and only in it, because TL/web2c/kpathsea
already has such feature).

Sure, I should have parsed tex-live mailing list before posting.

and what if the user want to name $HOME/texmf differently or place it on 
a different partition?

Actually what I was refering to is much similar to Ulrikes, I think we 
used the miktex root feature for this particular user, who is now 
switched to TL and cannot access his own files.

so if d:/foo/bar contains a TDS tree, the request is an interface of 
some sorts to add this to this persons installation.

I would find this useful as well.

The 'context minimals' distribution has support for something similar
to this, btw: it supports a variable called TEXMFPROJECT that normally
points to a non-existent folder, but that can be set to a specific TDS
tree whenever needed.

So, for example, processing the NTG's Maps journal is done in a shell
that starts with

     $ export TEXMFPROJECT=~/maps/texmf

I find this a very useful feature, because it allows per-project TDS
trees, with (possibly) different package versions from my 'normal'
setup.

I know this is not exactly the same as the feature request in
this thread (for one, TEXMFPROJECT requires actual user interaction,
which seems to be too complex a task for the users of the miktex-style
TDS option ;-)) but I wanted to mention it nonetheless.


Best wishes,
Taco

Well no. Miktex generates "User-Trees" called USERDATA (which
contains files generated on-the-fly like FDNB, pk, map-files which
don't need a backup) and a USERCONFIG which is in the "roaming"
profiles of a user and contains configurations. If a user installs
(with the package manager) a package "as user" without the rights to
write in the main tree it also goes in this tree (I think - I don't
have  a multiuser setup). Packages that you want to install manually
can also go in one of this user trees (USERCONFIG would be the
senseful one) and so this tree can be seen as the equivalent to
TEXMFHOME. 

Nevertheless the advice is in general to generate a second local
tree. For the reasons why I generate even more than one additional
local tree: Because it is useful to have more than one. One for
automatically installed local packages, one for my own private
packages, one for testing something, one for a bunch of fonts and
packages needed for e.g. a latex seminar. Once you get used to more
than one local root you can't avoid to find them rather useful.

(One shouldn't overdue it. In the due of time I declared quite a lot
local roots and tumbled over the following problem: Each new root
adds two pathes to MIKTEX_GS_LIB. At some point MIKTEX_GS_LIB got
too long and mgs, the miktex ghostscript failed.)

Hi,

I'm looking for the source to the xy package in TL2010 and I can't seem to find it. In TL2009 it seemed to exist here:

    /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/source/generic/xypic/xy.doc

Has it gone missing in 2010?
(The doc/ tree still exists, which is really what I was after.)

I've ended up with

tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME e:/foo/bar//;

which seems to work, at least on my laptop

on single user systems absolutely fine.

on multi user all users share the same texmfhome.

in this case it is a single user system

might be useful to notice this in the interface if one will be added. 
That some of these variables are ok to change if you are the only use 
(say on a laptop), but require to thought if you are managing a 
multiuser system...

AFAIK, this feature appear only in MikTeX 2.8 (the last version that I used)
and in MikTeX 2.9. Prior them there was not such feature. E.g. does
making %USERPROFILE%/texmf and populating it with tex files (in TDS)
work with MikTeX _after_ installation? (i.e. install using default
configuration the MikTeX and create that directory). AFAIK prior verison
2.8 there was only administrator mode for MikTeX Options, so only user
with administrator rights could install/reinstall/upgrade the system.
Only after 2.8 user could install "user-specific" packages in mentioned
directory.

The feature exist there is no "user-friendly" interface for it.

But AFAIU context minimal already use the feature (I looked into
$CONTEXT_MINIMAL/tex/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf). One just need the "user"
interface.

Hi Norbert,
this is true, of course.  But I think it's more likely that an admin
rather than a "normal" user installs a beta test package.  In this
case it's very difficult for a user to get back to the latest official
release.

 > user mode tlmgr is the answer.

Sure.

No, the variable TEXMFHOME is ~/texmf by default, where ~ expands to
$HOME on Unix and to %USERPROFILE% on Windows.  Thus,

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFHOME

provides different results for different users.

If you install TL for a single user, you can change TEXMFHOME as you
like.  In a multi user environment a particular user can only change
TEXMFHOME by setting an environment variable.

  Reinhard

I'm not sure I understand. Default configuration of miktex already
creates the user trees. It is rather difficult to avoid it, you can
only create them in other locations.

You could also install packages in the user trees in the sense that
you could copy files in the tree and then use them. Only the package
manager couldn't install automatically in the user trees. But the
feature that you can generate a local tree and mount it didn't
change this, you only got a second tree "that can be filled
manually".

I was wondering, is it possible to repackage the stable TeXWorks that 
comes with TL for windows?

I find it a bit embarassing that whenever we help students to install 
TL, and tell them about the nice jumping feature in TeXWorks, then the 
first thing we have to do with texworks is to reconfigure it to use 
pdflatex as the default engine.

We had the samme problem in TL09 so it is a bit sad that this small 
issue has not been fixed yet.

Fixed?!!! I think people who prefer to use plain pdfTeX don't think there is anything to fix!

And repackaging instead of going to Preferences -> Typesetting -> Default and selecting your preferred engine-format?

And if I think that everybody should be using XeLaTeX, can I ask for a repackaging with XeLaTeX as the default engine-format?

On launching TLMGR today, and changing the repository to the default

Please select 'Update all installed' button below".  However, the
message occurs within a popup, within which there is no "Update
all installed" button, and therefore "below" is both inaccurate
and misleading.  Could this please be changed to read "Please
use the 'Update all installed' button in the main pane after

please keep your sarcasm to your self. We are trying to get more users 
to start using LaTeX (and friends) and exactly how many pdftex (engine) 
users are there compared to pdflatex users?

Seriously, someone who can not change (or learn how to change) a single
configuration option should not be allowed to touch a computer in the
first place. You don't need to spoon feed your users, they are either
welling to learn or should be looking somewhere else.

Your "average new user" is not the universal average new user, Lars.
Just because your institution is trying to get more users to start
using LaTeX does not mean that there are not other, equally significant,
institutions that may be trying to get their users to start using
TeX, LaTeX, PdfTeX, PdfLaTeX, XeTeX, XeLaTeX, Context MK II, Context
MK IV, or some other variant that does not immediately come to mind.
It is not reasonable to expect that TeXworks should come configured
to meet your institution's specific needs.  I do not know with which
engine TeXworks comes configured out of the box, as I have already
re-configured mine, but I find that making the first line of the
source file read

	%&PdfLaTeX

seems to be all that is required to cause PdfLaTeX to be used rather
than PdfTeX as mine is currently configured.

When was the last time you tought a course on a TeX related topic?

In the LaTeX course I give I have exactly the same problem, and I'd
also like to see the default in TeXworks changed. We are trying our
best to convince students that there are other solutions than
Microsoft Word, and IMHO for them LaTeX is the best alternative,
neither plain TeX nor ConTeXt or anything else. These folks simply are
not as eloquent with using software as all of you are, and it would
make things for us giving these courses a little bit easier and allow
us to explain more important topics, if we have one obstacle less to
handle.

Reconfiguration of TeXworks is aone-time action. If they use MS Word,
they have to define the template for the document and defining all the
headers etc. takes much more time and must be repeated almost for
every document. How can such students use Word if they are not able to
open a dialog and customize the settings?

I sympathise. But I try to solve such configuration issues at my end
with an installer script which configures everything in such a way
TeX and add-ons are really usable out of the box for `my' target
users.

Does e:/TeX/Live/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/expl3/l3fp.sty exist?
If so, remake the filename database.

If not, try updating from another mirror.  I see that l3fp.sty is
present in the master expl3.tar.xz on tug.  As I recall, there was a bug
in a previous LaTeX3 update which omitted that file.  (But that was a
while ago, so I am surprised.)

Yes, it does Karl; the file manager says it was
created yesterday at 16:47.

As it is now reporting a different problem following
a further "Update all installed" (see recent message),
should I still carry out this step ?

That is less simple than it sounds : I had thought (perhaps
naively) that when I perform a "TLMGR/Load other repository",
I would be presented with a list of repositories from which
to choose.  In fact, I am presented with a "Package repository"
input field, and apparently required to populate that field
by reference to other resources.  This seems a rather odd and
unfriendly way of doing things ...

It never hurts to remake the filename db.

I can't imagine why else the file would not be found, since it exists.
Perhaps those "unwind" errors you are seeing stopped the normal ls-R remake
from happening.

    That is less simple than it sounds : 

I know.  Sorry about that.  Happily, since you have the file, it's not
necessary.  So forget that.

First, pdfTeX *is* the engine, whether you use plain or LaTeX formats (plain or LaTeX macros).

Second, it seems to me you are doing a disservice to your students if you think it's a big problem for them to configure an application to their needs ---almost every application in every platform has a ``Preferences'' or ``Options'' menu for that purpose ---you know DEK's words: ``Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind'' (p. 9).

Really? Not reading *your* mind means they don't work out of the box?

----
[1] If you think MiKTeX ---granted, a wonderful distribution--- is so superior to TL, why don't you advise your students to use it? After all, you get the same binaries and, I think, the same packages.
    Personally, I find TL structure (texmf trees updated by tlmgr, texmf-local for year-independent system-wide additions, ~/texmf for personal additions and the working directory for very specific macros) more than enough for *my* work.
    Now ---if you have had the patience to read this far, let me recommend you the excellent multiplatform LaTeX editor TeXmaker:

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

    I've grown so accustomed to TeXShop, that I find TeXworks more appealing on Linux and Windows, but I think TeXmaker is really a wonderful GUI oriented editor.

You're mentioning add-ons, hence another thing comes to my mind.
TeXworks supports templates.  There is a menu entry

  File => New from template...

I think that this is an invaluable feature for LaTeX teachers.

BTW, I'm wondering why everybody thinks that the default engine should
be pdflatex.  Is there any good reason why newcomers should be
bothered with antique 8-bit font encodings?

  Reinhard

For me, this is owed to my own knowledge. Maybe LaTeX-teachers first
have to migrate oneselves. But it will cause an amount of time to reach
a point that I'm able to teach the new system as good as LaTeX.

Why trying to see fundamental logic in people's behaviour? If 
reconfiguring TeXWorks is an obstacle for most of them (and my 
experience tells me to agree with this assertion), even if it doesn't 
seem logical, why not changing the default?

On my side, I have to make people reconfigure TeXWorks to add a new 
engine (gregorio), etc. which shouldn't be difficult, but I have a 
failure rate of about 90%... that doesn't seem logical to me, because 
I'm a computer expert compared to them, but that's just like it.

For people not using LaTeX (my experience tells me they are much more 
advanced users), reconfiguring TeXWorks will be a one-time action...

Thank you,

The reason why I jumped in on the sarcasm earlier was the implied
assertion was that if something is not automatically configured for
pdflatex use, then that has to be a bug.

That is a special case of tunnel vision that has nothing to do with
the matter at hand, and I believe that was deserving of a sarcastic
reply or two.

But I agree that for a non-beginner (*any* non-beginner) changing the 
default should be a simple one-time action, so the default may as well
be some latex-y format to please the crowd (however, I would have
chosen xelatex in that case ...)

Best wishes,
Taco

This seems to me the same direction as Reinhard mentioned. As I'm only
familiar with LaTeX I could not assess the situation.

Maybe its a good idea for the usergroups to give a guideline 'from LaTeX
to ...' which could help users like me to go towords the 'new common
system' ...

Where are questions like 'whats about my old stuff' or 'have I to
re-write my private sty-files' and more ...

First, let me start by saying that, with the exception of literally a couple of letters done in XeLaTeX, everything, absolutely everything I've ever done in TeX & friends, has been with pdfLaTeX. So the first thing I did with TeXworks for Linux and Windows, was to configure it to use pdfLaTeX.

> Maybe its a good idea for the usergroups to give a guideline 'from LaTeX

First thing ---you don't have to put aside LaTeX at all: both XeTeX and LuaTeX have LaTeX formats (XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX), you just get some enhancements, like the option to use your system fonts. So you will still be using LaTeX, but with the xetex or luatex engines, instead of the pdftex engine. At your terminal or command prompt,

texdoc -s xetex (for a list of documents you already have in your distro)

texdoc luatex   (for the main reference)

Of course it will profit you to learn how to use packages specific to XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, like fontspec.

This is exactly the point : by no means "everyone" thinks that the default

Thank you very much for the info ---I'll take it to account for my recommendations. For me, as I said, my attachment to TeXShop (the first editor I used) makes me prefer TeXworks for Linux and Windows.

There is one thing, though ---TeXmaker already has synctex[1], whereas TeXmakerX doesn't seem to.

[1] It doesn't come preconfigured, nevertheless ---you have to do it your self or put at the beginning of your document (*before* \documentclass{...}) \synctex=1

On testing, I see that this is an over-simplication :
whilst %&PdfLaTeX is capable of re-mapping a default
of PdfTeX to PdfLaTeX, there appears to be no analogous
mechanism which can map it to (say) XeLaTeX.  This
is a pity.

IIRC, texworks supports its own magic comment to select engine and
format, I don't have texworks installed to look for it, but I guess it
is documented somewhere.

Why two? Was there something to be updated?

Strange. But it seems unwinding was successful.

Is your installation from ancient times?

There was long time in the testing phase a bug that packages were not
saved with the reloc bit removed, but that should not happen 
anymore, and furthermore upgrading should fix these, too.

That is really strange.

I can *ONLY* guess that something with the permissions below
	e:\texlive\2010
on your computer is completely hosed.

If the un-xzing *did* succeed (as we have seen) the un-tar *should* succeed
because the tar file for sure is fine.

And if the un-tarring failed then something *very* strange on your computer
is going on.

Did you play around with file/dir permissions, or whatever else?

But was it ?  If so, why could PdfLaTeX not find F=file `l3fp.sty' ?

Ha! I just tried it in Windows, and it uses TeXShop's syntax:

% !TEX TS-program = xelatex
% !TEX encoding = UTF-8

TS-program stands for TeXShop program! You can see it like this: choose File -> New from Template... and it will open a window with different templates; choose XeLaTeX documents -> article-fontspec.tex and the typesetting format will change automatically to XeLaTeX!

This is exactly the point: no-one, in your head, is "no-one with what I 
consider to be an average level in computer using", and quite a lot of 
people use a computer (even LaTeX!) without having what you consider to 
be an average level... maybe (maybe), they are even the majority...

Ouch, yes, tlmgr check does not work on windows, since its find

I never left the list, but the list sends the wrong

Yes, I know, that was the point about the "Reply-to" header
being wrong; one has to continually remember to use Reply/all :-(

C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0>update-tlmgr-latest.exe
'update-tlmgr-latest.exe' is not recognized as an internal or
external command, operable program or batch file.

Searching for update-tlmgr-latest.exe finds only a 2009
copy, at \TeX\Live\2009\Mirror.  Thus I suspect it is
not shipped as a standard part of TeX Live 2010.

I'm replying from my Windows box. I pasted your example in TeXworks and immediately he typesetting format changed from pdfLaTeX to XeLaTeX. The logs says
 
This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4 (Web2C 2010)

I?m using TeXworks version 0.2.3 (r446) as distributed for TL for Windows.
 
I don?t know what might be happening.

Are you joking????

Ever thought about that since the release of TL2010 there is no
tlpretest anymore???

How did you update texlive.infra *before* when running *pretest*
that does not exist anymore???

Please use 
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive/tlnet

Grrrrr... sometimes .... I wonder ....
a simple click on the above address would have revealed
the wonderful thing of a README starting with
	The pretest is over.  See you next year.

Yes, the behaviour seems to be time/context sensitive.
Repeating your tests replicates your experienced
behaviour, but if I then reset the engine to TeX,
it fails as before.  I think that my expectations
were not aligned with reality : I expected the %!TS
pragmats to have an effect when the green "Go" button
was pressed, not at any other time.

Yes, but the default is still saved in the tlpdb...

It never reverted to that, it keeps what it has been told in the beginning,
and that is saved in the local tlpdb.

So how does one update that through the GUI ?

I do not wish to be difficult, particularly because you are doing
your best to help, but if a program such as TLMGR has a GUI interface,
then "the average man on the top deck of a Number 53 Clapham Common
Omnibus" would expect to be able to do something as ?simple" as
change the default repository through the GUI, and I, in my innocence,
assumed that "Load default network repository" would do just that.

I read it : I reported it back to you because it was you
who recommended that I use that repository in the first place ...

Going into Options-General seems to be a quite common activity

It does, but only for *that* particular run.

Well you are *QUITE* out of date ;-)

tlmgr update --all should do the trick.

CORRIECRAVIE (n.)
To avert the horrors of corrievorrie (q.v.) corriecravie is usually
employed. This is the cowardly but highly skilled process by which
both protagonists continue to approach while keeping up the pretence
that they haven't noticed each other - by staring furiously at their
feet, grimacing into a notebook, or studying the walls closely as if
in a mood of deep irritation.

Well, maybe in the Unix world.  In the Windows world,
we look for such things under Edit/Preferences :-)

OK, that could usefully be clarified in the interface.  Also
the terminology is inconsistent : "Load default network repository"
v. (Edit/Preferences) "Default remote repository".

But isn't that the non-GUI version of what I have been doing
for the last 36 hours : "Update all installed" ???

Yes, but it seems that it does not work with the GUI.

So what about trying
	tlmgr -v update --all
and send the output if there were errors.

Huuu???? But you have

Something is *REALLY* fishy on your system.

Can you please send me your
	E:\TeX\Live\2010\tlpkg\texlive.tlpdb
it seems to be messed up completely.

No idea what you did.


Wait,
please run tlmgr-update-latest.exe once more, then
	tlmgr --version
(should still be as above)
and then tlmgr update --all

Does that still mention "updates for tlmgr itself are present"?

And if yes, please send the full list of packages being listed!

I don't recall ever seeing an application with Options menu either.

To be honest I find tlmgr gui one of the badly designed and confusing
gui apps I have ever used, but I'd do even worse myself (if I can do
anything that work in the first place), so I'm not complaining. I find
its cli much better.

Ok, that is something that is on your side. I cannot say anything
bout that, but you see that is has to do with permissions, as I 
conjured up from my non-existing crystal ball.

All really bad.

Please try (cmd line)
	tlmgr remove --force texworks
then check if bin/win32/texworks.exe is gone
also check that all of tlpkg/texworks directory is gone

Then run
	tlmgr install texworks

On Winblows, but in the rest of the world it is not uncommon.

And then, *READING* and *UNDERSTANDING* helps ;-) I gues sthe word
	Options
tells most people around the world, even with rudimentary
English knowledge like me.

Complex app, true.

Suggestions for improvement that are not "kick out all functionality"
are welcome.

My point is that 95% of the people using a computer shouldn't be allowed 
to do so due to their poor knowledge. So, sadly, we have to cope with it...

Could this be related to the fact that I have had TeXworks

OK, but if they can be taught to type

	\documentclass {book}
	 ...

then they can at the same time be taught to type

	%&PdfLaTeX
	\documentclass {book}
	 ...

		or

can they not ?  It is one extra line, infinitesimal in terms

I am now trying a TLMGR -v --update all and getting zillions
of "relocated bit" warnings; what is the syntax, please, for
TLMGR -v --update <all> ?

I do have problems with TeXworks, mainly because I cannot work
out what is the correct/recommended way of aborting a failed compilation.
Is this an FAQ, and if so, what is the answer, please ?

You can only 
	update --all
but there is no
	install --reinstall --all
you have to give them by hand.

I don't really think it's infinitesimal, because 99% of LaTeX users 
don't really understand what a "format" and an "engine" is, and if they 
want to understand the difference between "pdflatex" and "pdftex", they 
will have to get informations about formats and engines that are quite 
well hidden on the internet... so most of them will just report a bug 
saying "my LaTeX document doesn't compile!" or, more probably, just give 
up, and tell their friends that this TeX thing is definitely too 
complicated... Anyway, this wouldn't really be wrong.

But to be fair, most analogous utilities detected that an application
that needs to be updated is currently running, warns the user, and
either asks the user to shut down the offending application or offers
to do so on behalf of the user.  TLMGR does neither ...

The problem with writing something that becomes widely used is that you
see lots of problem reports.  Even if your software is bug free users will find
ways to break stuff.  The only answer is for other users to take on more of the
support tasks.

Many Windows installers still recommend closing all other applications.
The "application that needs to be updated is currently running" only
applies when the component being updated is tied to the application
so it is easy to detect the conflict.

TLMGR is cross-platform and open-ended.   Updating a currently running
application is common practice on other platforms.    With TeX Live it
would be difficult to know in advance which applications might be using
the files, so maybe the best that could be done is to remind windows users
to "close all other applications".

"In advance", yes, but not at the point of application.  There is
a well-defined interface, exploited (for example) by Sysinternal's
"Filemon" (now bundled into Process Monitor) which is quite capable
of disclosing which processes are referencing which files.  I do
not for one second claim that it would necessarily be easy to hook
into this interface : my only point was that a Windows user would
normally expect to be informed that a file was locked, and and told
which application was responsible, rather than being given an
obscure message concerning file protection/permissions.

I know, that was a typo on my part, my point has been mare also by 
others, as there are some many more (pdf)LaTeX users than plain TeX, 
XeLaTeX and ConTeXt users combined (my estimate), why not please the 
majority.

I do not agree, as mentioned elsewhere, new users have no idea what 
these things are.

I really like TL especially the net installer, there is nothing to think 
about, press next and then install and wait until it finishes. Job done.

Just one little thing extra, and we would have a killer app set for new 
users.

I do not think MT is superior, I've never used it professionally, just 
helped configure it for several students. And commented that some of 
ideas in their interfaces would also be a nice thing in TL.

I recommend TL for all our users for the sole reason that then al have 
the same distribution on Win, Linux and MAC. And the various tools work 
out of the box (e.g. makeglossaries)

And texdoc on TL is a lot better than the MT version (last I checked).

texmaker is a really good editor, the reason why we recommend TeXWorks 
is that is comes with TL (or MT) and because of the build in PDF viewer 
with forward and inverse search.

Also the spell checker is really good. We usually recommend even 
non-TeXWorks users to install TeXWorks in order to have an available 
editor with good spell checking.

I've never managed to get Danish spell checking to work correctly in the 
other popular editor TeXnicCenter. (haven;t tried it in TeXmaker)

In case of an error the Compile button (Ctrl-t) turns red to indicate 
and error. Just hit it again to make it stop the compilation and prepare 
for a new one.

As an experienced (imho) windows user I strongly disagree with the above statement, even Windows itself won't usually tell which process is preventing delete/move/overwrit-ing a file. (It'd really be great when trying to unmount an USB device.) [Yes, the sysinternals tools do, but thats irrelevant here.]

OK, my thanks to everyone for the pointer to the "red button",
but can anyone explain why E/Q/S/X/Ctrl-Z do not work as
expected ?  The behaviour is as follows :

	E (appears in lowest pane)
	<return> (E migrates to middle pane)
	2nd E
	<return> : "I cannot find emacs in the PATH."

	Q (appears in lowest pane)
	<return> (Q migrates to middle pane)
	2nd Q
	<return> : "OK, entering \batchmode"
	(but no indication that compilation has finished)

	S (appears in lowest pane)
	<return> (S migrates to middle pane)
	2nd S
	<return> : "OK, entering \scrollmode"
	(and a clear indication that compilation has finished)

	X (appears in lowest pane)
	<return> (X migrates to middle pane)
	2nd X
	<return> : "No pages of output.  Transcript written on ..."

	Ctrl-Z ("e" appears in lowest pane)
	<return> ("e" migrates to middle pane)
	2nd Ctrl-Z
	<return> : "No pages of output.  Transcript written on ..."

Users should at least know WHAT they are using and probably the best
way to do it is to have them configured the  frontend. Nanny approach
will hurt them in the future. Too many Mac LaTeX users who had
everything installed for them are truly sure that TeXShop is all what
they need and are REALLY surprised when learn that TeXShop is not a
TeX.

PS I am talking from my perspective as a mathematician and in
mathematics (pdf)LaTeX is the only game in the town so there is no
need to proselyte; on the contrary one needs to discourage students
from copying the preamble from their supervisor who most likely did
the same then added few packages and macros used by the coauthors
without even noticing that the same thing is defined by few different
macros and the best way to do this is to create some obstacles.

i thought (it's a long time since i needed to use it) that filemon
required admin privilege.

and suggesting that something written by mark russinovitch is that which
everyone should emulate seems a bit strong.  (i don't know how he makes
his living now, as part of m$, but when i last saw him he was making a
living by "knowing what goes on inside windows".)

i would suggest "close other applications..." would exonerate tl from
any stuck-ness...

A few days ago Manuel uploaded such guidelines for people who want to
switch to LuaLaTeX.

  texdoc lualatex-doc

For XeLaTeX you probably need much less, I suppose that the fontspec
documentation is a good starting point.  

You don't need inputenc.sty because both, XeTeX and LuaTeX, support
UTF-8 natively, and it's the default encoding in TeXworks anyway.
There are probably some issues with language dependent stuff, but I
assume that this is easier with the new engines.

You probably have to adapt macro packages if they rely on 8-bit
stuff.  But on a long-term basis I'm convinced that it's easier to
teach LaTeX on Unicode-aware engines.

And don't worry about *your* old stuff.  You can still compile it with
pdflatex.  The question is whether you want to bother newcomers with
internals like font encodings.

  Reinhard

installed some local cwebmac.tex in

	${HOME)/tex/local/askgeneral/cwebmac.tex

that leads to

	$ kpsewhich cwebmac.tex
	/home/ingo/texmf/tex/local/askgeneral/cwebmac.tex

which is what I expected.

When I now use luatex on some file, converted with cweave I get:

	$ luatex scan_portage_dir.tex | head
	This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.60.2-2010071218 (TeX Live 2010)
	(rev 3736)
	 restricted \write18 enabled.
	 (./scan_portage_dir.tex
	 (/usr/share/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex
	[...]

But this is no luatex problem, it seems a global installation problem:

	$ tex scan_portage_dir.tex | head
	This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (TeX Live 2010)
	 encTeX v. Jun. 2004, reencoding enabled.
	 (./scan_portage_dir.tex
	 (/usr/share/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex)
	[...]

Now I'm confused.  What's going wrong here?

Sorry, I removed myself from the TeXworks list when the thread
on scripting took over; if anyone has replied to my earlier message
(quoted by Karl, above) on the TeXworks list, I would be most
grateful if they could re-send directly to my e-mail address.

Plain TeX first looks in a directory tex/plain which is missing in
your local tree.

>From texmf.cnf:
------------------------------------------------------------------
% Plain TeX.  Have the command tex check all directories as a last
% resort, we may have plain-compatible stuff anywhere.
TEXINPUTS.tex           = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can see that at least a directory "tex" in the root of a texmf
tree is required.  I recommend to keep the same directory structure 
as in the main tree.

however, not what i would expect; i assumed your HOME variable was the
equivalent of "~"; it appears from this that it's "~/texmf"

so kpsewhich is assuming you're looking for a file to run "tex" on.

you're running plain (lua)tex, so it's looking in $TEXMF/tex/plain or
the like, for files, and your file isn't there.

in the tl distribution it's in texmf-dist/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex, so
i would assume ~/texmf/tex/plain/cweb/cwebmac.tex would be the place for
it.

I recommend
kpsewhich -progname=luatex cwebmac.tex
if you are going to run luatex.

That's true, its $HOME/texmf or ~/texmf

I assumed that it works just as TEXINPUTS variable, since

===== excerpt from texmf.cnf ====
% TEXINPUTS is for TeX input files -- i.e., anything to be found by \input
% or \openin, including .sty, .eps, etc.  We specify paths for all known
% formats, past or present.  Not all of them are built these days.

% Plain TeX.  Have the command tex check all directories as a last
% resort, we may have plain-compatible stuff anywhere.
TEXINPUTS.tex           = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//
=================================

suggests (having
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}
)

the rule that

	$TEXMF/tex/plain

gets precedence over any other

	$TEXMF/tex/*.

I also found the reason that kpsewhich cwebmac.tex does not find the
plain file, as the searchpath is tuned in by

kpsewhich -progname tex    or    kpsewhich -progname luatex 

which comes more clear using

kpsewhich -progname tex -show-path cwebmac.tex | tr ':' '\n'

that shows the whole path order how TEXINPUTS is constructed.  Actually
I think there should be no difference in 'looking for a file to run
"tex" on' and searching a file used in an \input statement within the
document source.  Both use cases should be affected by TEXINPUTS in the
same way and I think they are.

Thank you for your help in solving this problem.

we see that a lot too, get email explaining this and this problem "and

it takes users quite a long time to get used to the fact that the LaTeX

it has taken me about 6-8 years to get most of our researchers to 
produce nice LaTeX. For most of their teaching material I get to look it 
through before sending it of for publishing. It has become a lot better 
comepared to when I started.

We are also in the process of teaching students to document very package 
and every macro they add to their preambles, such that they themselfs 
know what they do, and such that if they give their preamble to someone 
else, they will also have an idea about what is what. I ti is a long 
process though.

kpsewhich (without a -progname option) actually uses the
bare TEXINPUTS, which is
   TEXINPUTS = .;$TEXMF/tex/{$progname,generic,}//
And, since tex/kpsewhich/ doesn't exist, it looks first
in tex/generic// and then tex//. Presumably, on your system,
this last search gets to tex/local before tex/plain
On the other hand, luatex uses TEXINPUTS.luatex, set to
   TEXINPUTS.luatex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{luatex,plain,generic,}//
which looks in three directories, including tex/plain//,
before it tries tex/local//

On my system, I found it useful to set TEXINPUTS.kpsewhich,
so that a plain kpsewhich file.tex will use it instead of
the not-so-useful TEXINPUTS.

Of course, if you want to know what luatex (or any particular
program) will find, you need to use the -progname option.

Subject: [tex-live] Feature requests tlmgr
Message-ID: <4CE13908.4080007@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

I would like to propose the following feature requests for TeX Live.

1) Can the installer ask if a cron job will be installed that will check 
twice a day if updates are available and will pop up tlmgr GUI? This is 
the same idea as Ubuntu's update manager.

2) Can the installer offer an option to enable e-mail notification when 
updates are available for server installation? This is the same idea as 
http://www.digipedia.pl/man/doc/view/apticron.1/

3) Also provide documentation to enable, disable and configure this 
after an installation has been done.

Apticron is scheduled for 13:00 and 19:00 hours. Perhaps 13:10 and 19:10 
would be conveniend times.

Best regards,

Pander

but where does the full uninstaller (the one to be found via Remove 
programmes) come from?

The uninstaller in w32client only removes some stuff from the desktop, 
the menus and from the PATH. It does not remove the TL, installation 
which of course it should not.

I would like to end up with a feature where one, after the TL 
transplant, will not be able to see the difference between the 
transplanted TL and a TL installed into the same location using the 
netinstaller.

in w32client we have

# create some shortcuts
unshift @ARGV, 'install', 'shortcut',
   'dviout.win32', 'texworks', 'texlive-en', 'tlpsv.win32';
action_postaction();

can I somehow ask it to install everything? more or less what 
do_tlpdb_postactions does in the net installer.

(so far I'm a bit reluctant to test anything on windows unless I 
actually know what is going on, as to not mess up say the registry)

I'm not sure if you've seen the reply from Stefan on the texworks
mailing list, but the development branch of TW already defaults to
pdflatex and this will eventually propagate to TL.

I added this to my TODO list, but I won't get around to it for at
least a couple of months (if at all; it's not that trivial with the
scripting tools we use and I don't see it as a real priority).

Just an idea: if you try to open tex.exe in the append mode and it
succeeds, you know that the file is not used and you can overwrite it.
you can immediatelly close it without writing anything. It may be good
to set the ctime to the old value. If opening fails, it means that the
file is in use. I do not know whether such an approach works but it
looks simple.

Well, it is certainly simple, and it is probably sufficient in 99.999%
of cases, but of course there is the theoretical possibility that
someone/thing might start to make use of tex.exe between the time that
you close it and the time you try to overwrite it.  I know next to
nothing about Windows programming, but in a more sophisticated
operating system such as VMS one would expect to have the ability
to take out an exclusive lock on the file which one would not
relinquish until the overwrite were complete.

Transactional file system operations have been available since Windows Vista, so that should be no problem in principle.

Errmmm ... Maybe not for "early adopters".  But Vista was
a heap of ****, and Windows 7, whilst considerably better
than Vista (not difficult !) seems to offer insufficient
advantages to make it sensible to upgrade from XP.  (Where,
for example, has "Repair this wireless connection" gone ?!).

So I really think that in planning changes to TLMGR and
similar we should bear in mind that the majority of
the Windows user base may be unable to take advantage of
anything that relies in transactional file system
operations that are not present in XP.

I have tried locks from Perl in Linux (even over NFS) and OS/2, not in Windows.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1011152243370.7752@hahepc1.hahe>

Hi,

here xpdf on a debian-stable amd64 PC gives an immediate segfault on any
(or least many) of the STIX*.otf.pdf files in directory

  texlive/2010/texmf-dist/doc/fonts/stix/Glyphs

On another, debian-testing amd64 PC it gives

  $ xpdf STIXGeneral.otf.pdf
  Error: Mismatch between font type and embedded font file
  Error: Embedded CID font has type Type1C; assuming CIDType0C
  Error: Mismatch between font type and embedded font file
  Error: Embedded CID font has type Type1C; assuming CIDType0C

but doesn't crash, and displays ok. Also acroread silently displays the
file. Is there anything bad with the PDF files, or is it an xpdf bug?

    1) Can the installer ask if a cron job will be installed 

Thanks for the suggestions, but I really don't want to try to have our
program interact with cron.  That would be a huge (and hugely
frustrating) effort, for, IMO, a very small return.  People who want to
use cron (or "scheduler") to do things should do it themselves.  We are
not an operating system.

Hi Hartmut,
the version of xpdf provided by Gentoo Linux (linked against poppler)
shows the same error messages as above.

I just compiled a native xpdf-3.02 (without applying the patches) and
it welcomed me with a core dump.

Are both of your versions linked against poppler?  I have the
impression that there is a problem with xpdf itself which had been
fixed by Linux distributors or poppler developers.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Tomek, nice to hear from you, but please don't waste your time.
I guess the best option is to simply tell users on Windows to
close all applications *EVERY* time a .ARCH package is updated (ie
something in bin/$arch/*). Then there is still the chance that
they are running a latex run at the same time that has some
.sty file open for reading, but well, shoot yourself if you want.

WDYT?

CRAIL (n. mineral)
Crail is a common kind of rock or gravel found widely across the
British Isles. Each individual stone (due to an as yet undiscovered
gravitational property) is charged with 'negative buoyancy'. This
means that no matter how much crail you remove from the garden, more
of it will rise to the surface. Crail is much employed by the Royal
Navy for making the paperweights and ashtrays used inside submarines.

Do you suggest to do that with *each*and*every* file before unpacking
the tar file? Puahahhhhhhhh that will take ages and kill Windows
for sure. 

Restricting it to .exe files *could* help, but also .dll, .bat, and
actually anything that can be opened by asome applicaton, so *every* file.

As already answered by Karl, no. We are not playing with cron jobs,
that is for the sysadmin to be done. Furthermore, cron is very different
on all the systems, nightmare.

I can just find it myself, at least I'll learn more about the inner 
workings of the installer and the other tools (might be handly later on)

I know, my point is just at it seems we are shipping the same TW as last 
year, so this issue has been known for quite some time.

Thanks, also Norbert for your replies.

Is it possible to build one myself? Can I ask tlmgr if updates are
available without upgrading immediately?

I have tried:
  tlmgr check
but that resulted in:
  ...
  diff
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/lfb/ligature.mf
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/source/public/wnri/ligature.mf
  # ot1.cmap
diff /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmap/ot1.cmap
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/mmap/ot1.cmap
  # t1.cmap
diff /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cmap/t1.cmap
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/mmap/t1.cmap
  tlmgr: exiting unsuccessfully (status 1).

This is probably checking how sane my installation is. Off topic, but
how can I fix this since I have only an out of the box installation...

Probably the best way would be:
  tlmgr update --dry-run --self
  tlmgr update --dry-run --all
or
  tlmgr update --list

For the latter command, only --list implies --list --all. Is it also
possible to run --list --self? It seems this is not supported because it
has the same output as --list --all. Should this be fixed?

Last question, is it possible to start tlmgr -gui and have it list only
the available updates?

Thanks,

Pander

I usually just run

tlmgr update --list

that way you can see if there are infra updates, and if there are you 
have to run

tlmgr update --self

This is one of the reasons why I do not what to run the updates via 
cron, even on Linux

I support Karls opinion that is should not be included in tlmgr, the 
various sysadmins should write their own cron scripts if they want to 
uoste through cron.

Ok, the net installer runs (from TeXLive::TLWinGoo)

    create_uninstaller($vars{'TEXDIR'}, $vars{'TEXDIRW'},
       $vars{'TEXMFSYSVAR'}, $vars{'TEXMFSYSCONFIG'});

and I assume we can do the same, if we know these four vars, of which I 
assume we can ask tlmgr

No, don't do that!  The uninstaller currently removes EVERYTHING!  You
would need to write your own versions of  create_uninstaller and
unregister_uninstaller for w32client.

but that is exactly want I want!

w32client already has a suitable uninstaller which only remove desktop 
icons, menu entries etc.

I'm trying to create a w32transplant script to speed up TL installation 
on windows for 'install-party' sessions such that we do not waste too 
much time installing in these sessions.

i.e. create a pristine TL installation on one Windows PC, ZIP it, move 
it to another PC, unpack it and run w32transplant and the result should 
be that one should not be able to see the difference between the 
transplanted TL and a TL installed via the net installer into the same 
location.

As far as I can see this is what I need to do

* add the same items to the menu that the install-tl script does (you 
already mentioned how this can be done)

* add items to the desktop

* add to PATH variable

* adjust TeXWorks (I haven't looked at how this is done yet)

I would also like to be able to do the following

Assume the donor TL is installed in C:/texlive/2010 and we zip from 
texlive and down

Then we would like to be able to transplant this to say

D:/foo

such that the new installation lives at

D:/foo/texlive/2010

Most of the work is already done in w32client, so I'll just copy some of 
that.

BTW: can we ask tlmgr (or other items in TeXLive perl bundle) for this 
information

  my $TEXDIR="$vars{'TEXDIR'}";
   my $TEXDIRW="$vars{'TEXDIRW'}";
   my $TEXMFSYSVAR="$vars{'TEXMFSYSVAR'}";
   my $TEXMFSYSCONFIG="$vars{'TEXMFSYSCONFIG'}";
   my $TEXMFVAR="$vars{'TEXMFVAR'}";
   my $TEXMFCONFIG="$vars{'TEXMFCONFIG'}";
   my $TEXMFLOCAL="$vars{'TEXMFLOCAL'}";

because the create_uninstaller needs it (btw, this is not documented in 
the perldoc info from TLWinGoo, I usually just read the source anyways)

Yes, I'm back :) but only virtually and with little time for real work
ATM apart from fixing critical bugs.  Detecting running apps is not
really critical, but I would be useful though (I forgot to close TW
before update a couple of times too!).

It would be annoying to have a pop-up every time you update regardless

I would say it should be enough to limit this to interactive apps only
(dviout, ps_view, texworks).  These are the most likely to cause
troubles like this.

It would not be safe to assume that the only applications that
one uses with TeX Live are those that come with TeX Live. Many
will be using third-party tools such as WinEDT, which is just
as likely as TeXworks to be hogging some vital file.

Don't use texlive.profile,

simply ask
	TEXMFSYSVAR ->	kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR
	etc
	TEXDIR -> kpsewhich -var-value SELFAUTOPARENT
...
	TEXDIRW is a problem, but I think this is not necessary
because it is only used for the portable installation setup.

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual mint, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

You answered your own question, 
	tlmgr update --list

update --list *IS* shows *ALL* updates, also those of texlive.infra
(more specifically those of the critical packages).

And if you want to automatize it I recommend reading the section
on MACHINE READABLE in the tlmgr manager, then you can easily parse
that and write a nice cron script, which you hopefully will send
back to the lsit here!

Not at the moment, but for that tlmgr gui is anyway overhead, you can 
write a very simple gtkdialog or whatever script that informs and then
calls tlmgr update --all --self!

Yep, all as in w32client.

You don't need to do anything special about TW (unless you want to
preconfigure it, which we don't do in TL).  TW autoconfigures itself
on the first start.  Configuration is stored by default under
$TEXMFCONFIG/texworks (can be changed, see TW_LIBPATH and TW_INIPATH
in texmf.cnf).

Or, once you loaded tlmgr in your w32transplant.pl:

my $TEXDIR = $Master;
my $TEXDIRW = $TEXDIR; # these differ only when installation is on
non-writable media
# default texmf trees locations, use kpsewhich if different
my $TEXMFSYSVAR = "$Master/texmf-var;
my $TEXMFSYSCONFIG = "$Master/texmf-config;

that was exactly was I was doing, though I went through init_local_db(); 
and $localtlmedia, seems $Master is much easier.

The full uninstaller, seems to be working just fine, though it did leave 
some of the texlive dirs and some scripts, but it did delete everything 
else.

What did not work well though as adding the TeXLive Manager to the menu, 
  it showed up, but kept on giving an error about not being able to find 
perl.exe

I'll do a bit more testing.

I would say to the files under bin/win32/*, no?

If there is some perl code we can easily execute for that, one could
in principle:
- collect the files that would be updated in bin/win32/* from the 
  list of updated/removed packages
- check all of them whether they are in use (that is the open problem)
- warn the user with a list if some of them are open

No.  See my earlier reply to Tomek, repeated below :

It would not be safe to assume that the only applications that
one uses with TeX Live are those that come with TeX Live. Many
will be using third-party tools such as WinEDT, which is just
as likely as TeXworks to be hogging some vital file.

What about *reading* what *I* wrote????

I said that it is *NOT* possible to check whether in the list of
84000+ files one or the other is open.

If you are so genius to find a good solution for that, please provide
it, otherwise please simply *trust* us to find a feasible solution.

Not in the message to which I was replying.

Nor am I suggesting that you should.  At any one time,
you are trying to update only one file.  That is the
only file that needs to be checked to see if it is
open.

I trust in God; everyone else pays cash.  Or to put it another
way, I prefer to work /with/ you, Tomek, Akira, Karl et al to
try to find the best solution rather than trusting you to do so
and then complaining afterwards that you failed.

Reasonable ?

No, we are unpacking a tar file which can contain quite a lot of 
files. Even checking every file that is going to be removed/updated
for bein in use seems to be like a PITA.

> Reasonable ?

Not reasonable in the sense that it seems that a full realization
of what you are asking is *much* more than any update program of
windows itself, microsoft prodcuts in general, and all other programs
are doing. And that from hobby programmers as their spare time
activity seems to be a quite unreasonable request for me.

no, it is "perl.exe has stopped working" I keep getting when trying to 
start "TeX Live Manager" from the menu.

But a Windows reboot helped, do I need some sort of environemnt 
broadcast somewhere for the manager to work immediately? (not sure if 
that is what the net installer is doing)

OK, unreasonable.  But still better than the alternative --
to contribute no ideas as this time, then complain bitterly
when TL 2011 is released that it is no better in this
respect than TL 2010.

Strange. Does it work when started from the explorer?

Shouldn't matter, but I can't tell for sure without some testing
(which I can't do now, because I'm on Linux but I can take look at
your script if you like).

I wrote a Python script to do this for the latest version of
TeX Live Utility.  The tlmgr part is platform-agnostic, so at
least shows how the parsing might be accomplished.  Watch out
for status; I only count additions or updates.

http://code.google.com/p/mactlmgr/source/browse/trunk/agent/update_check.py

One thing that's worth noting: if you use mirror.ctan.org to
count updates, launch tlmgr with the /actual/ host to perform
the update.  Mirror synchronization can make this really
confusing, otherwise.

There's a launchd property list and installer script also,
but those are Mac-specific.

Thaks but it still needs some extra installs:

$ ./update_check.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./update_check.py", line 4, in <module>
    from CoreFoundation import CFUserNotificationDisplayNotice,
CFUserNotificationDisplayAlert, CFBundleCreate, CFBundleCopyResourceURL,
CFPreferencesCopyAppValue
ImportError: No module named CoreFoundation

At the moment I'm writing a bash script for this too at the moment.

I prefer python too, but without special dependencies. does Ubuntu
support CoreFoundation?

Message-ID: <4083.95.49.154.140.1289856603.squirrel@webmail.cft.edu.pl>


It seems that "dvips -P pdf" fails to properly generate PK fonts on
Windows, leaving characters blank (tested on TeX Live 2010 and also 2009).
No such problem on Linux. The reason is probably that mktexpk ignores
--dpi and uses just the MF mode, resulting in a font generated at 600dpi
instead of 8000dpi. I see that mktexpk is an EXE file on Windows...

Thanks. Perhaps we can merge all into one python script that will do
dynamic imports so it support multiple platforms.

I have some code for server installations that will send email, in stead
of doing a popup.

So we have:
- Mac GUI
- Debian/Ubuntu GUI via zenity
- Debian/Ubuntu server via email
- Windows ???

-Ppdf really ought not to be necessary nowadays, anyway.  (i suspect the
faq doesn't agree: i'll review that tonight -- i've a new version of the
faq near to release.)

it has never (ime) worked for documents that required bitmap fonts --
since there has never been a metafont mode for a 8000dpi printer.

so what you observe is nothing directly to do with tl -- i first noticed
it with an early tetex, i think.

if your system is daft enough not to use outline fonts by default for
computer modern, etc., there are other ways to solve the problem.

OK, but then what is the purpose of config.pdf included in the 
distribution? Are the blank characters intentional?

dpdfezzz is used on Linux.

Right, the sames happens when using TeX installed with my Linux distro 
(CentOS 5.5). But the Windows version of mktexpk from TeX Live just 
silently ignores --dpi, which is not OK, I think.

The font is bbm (I doubt there is a PostScript ouline version).

config.pdf supports people who continue to use this mechanism.

not on ctan, anyway.  there aren't many blackboard bold fonts available
in outline format -- apart from the default msbm, there's only
doublestroke, i think.  istr doublestroke isn't well thought of: perhaps
the gust font people can be persuaded to convert bbm, too.

It says what fonts have to be used in outline form if it is not set as default.

MF mode says what resolution should be used. Remember that the glyph
size is limited. If you try to generate PK fonts at 8000 dpi, you
might exceed the limit. --dpi is used to transform the page. Some RIPs
have bugs in floating point arithmetics, thus dpi is used to convert
all calculation to integers, i.e. everything will be in pixels, not in
points. Are you sure that the resolution of your RIP is really 8000
dpi? If so, you have to design your own MF mode and set all parameters
required for proper hinting.

it seems some one has been installing Java on his PC and manually added

Does anyone know how to restore the windows PATH variable?

misunderstood what you were saying -- sorry.

you're saying that tex live dvips on widnoze doesn't get that? -- that
surely is a bug.  but for all that, i wouldn't use -Ppdf on a modern
system (except in really strange circumstances).

the normal windows path variable contains someting like %Systemroot% ... 
and he had deleted this

luckily a different student came by who was also using Win 7 64-bit so 
we simply copied the default PATH settings from the PC.

I noticed that the documentation for tapir is under latex. Should it
not be under fonts?

Also memdesign is under fonts which does not seem especially
appropriate.

The licence for nkarta seems questionable. It is public domain only
barring objection from the original author of karta who has evidently
proven uncontactable.

CTAN says that the licence of termcal is unknown. The comments in the
sty file refer the reader to copyright information in the dtx file but
I cannot find any such information in that file. However, the comments
do strongly suggest that the author intended the package to be released
under some sort of free licence. But it does not seem entirely clear.

Best,

exactly so.  nkarta itself is pretty old, though, and no comment from
the author of karta has arisen.  so who knows?

there are a painfully large number of packages on ctan, whose author is
uncontactable for a proper statement of licence.

but i don't (and afaik karl doesn't either) think one should assume
anything based on "hints".  it's sad -- but the possible consequences,
of making an incorrect assumption about something whose author turns out
to be litigious, are too ghastly for us to take chances.

Subject: [tex-live] w32transplant beta
Message-ID: <4CE2C9B1.7040700@imf.au.dk>

Hi list

my first version of w32transplant is available via

http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/tmp/w32transplant/

it seems to be able to integrate a TL installation copied from one PC to 
another. Please test it. For now I've tested it on Win 7.


There seems to be a slight issue with the general TL uninstaller, on 
several occasions it has left files and directories behind. (observed 
with both the uninstaller istalled by w32transplant and with the one 
installed by the net installer).

On at least two occasions said that texmf-dist/bibtex/bib as not empty, 
it was empty after closer inspection later on. And several more 
examples. There were more example of these non-empty folder messages.


BTW: in the command prompt where  w32transplant is running, what is the 
best methond to write a message to the user? I'd like to write something 
like

"Integrating transplanted TeX Live installation, this may take a little 
while, please wait"

BTW2: I assume the uninstaller is using the TLPDB to know which files to 
remove. How can we add files to this? Such that if for example one added 
w32transplat to TL before creating the donor ZIP, then one could get the 
uninstaller to remember to remove it if the user wanted to uninstall TL 
later on.

My code is under BSD license, so you're welcome to use it.
However, I'm not inclined to ship code for other platforms
in my program, simply because I don't have time to test or
maintain it.  I may refactor it a bit, though, so it would
be easier to extract the cross-platform parts.

If you choose to support Windows, you're opening a huge
can of worms, if you use a scripting language; you can't
guarantee Python or (ba)sh will be present.

I have made a very simple script suitable for cross platform but
supports Ubuntu/Debian the best. When tlmgr has updates again, I can
test it if finalise it and post it on this list. Perhaps it can call
your script in case it runs on a Mac. Well, we'll later after I have
published the code. Thanks so far.

What problem are you trying to solve?  Here, updates run quickly, and it is good
to see what is changing, so it isn't worth the bother to automate updates.  What
is worthwhile is having a local mirror if you aren't near enough to a
mirror site.

If you have a partial installation, the local mirror provide
convenient access to
packages you don't have installed.   If you have a complete install then you
need to download "everything", so if downloading is the bottleneck then a
local mirror is useful.

A couple years ago my systems ran 7/24 and were often running multi-day
builds.  Now the builds mostly run in under an hour, so the system are
turned on as needed.  Ubuntu and TL updates both use local mirrors.

I would like to have automated notification when updates are available
for my desktop (pop-up) and for my server (e-mail). So I don't have to
chekc manually if updates are there for all the different systems.

Adam Maxwell has a good script for Mac. I will contribute my code for
Debian/Ubuntu.

The download and upgrade processes itself work perfectly.

well it might actually make sense to place it there. On CTAN it lives in 
info/memdesign/, and there really isn't a good mapping of info in TL.

memdesign actually talk about several fonts.

it's more about typesetting in general.  any text on typesetting will
(almost inevitably) talk about several fonts.

which is not to say that there is an _obvious_ place to have the
document in tl.  to an extent it doesn't matter, but i agree with clea:
its present location has the potential for confusion.

    my point is just at it seems we are shipping the same TW as last year, 

Perhaps a new stable release of TW will be made before next year's TL.

sure, but I would leave it to the TL people to decide where to place it 
in TL. I do not know where it would obviously fit in TL, unless an 
doc/info folder is introduced (which might be handly)

MemoirChapStyles might fit better in doc/info as well, instead of doc/latex

The trouble is that many platforms/architectures seem to be missing
and not because the lack of the trying. F.e. AFAIK there is no binary
working in RHL Linix64

Taco pointed out to me a while ago that there are type1 fonts in the Y&Y
distribution for mathbb.
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/3523/mathbbz-is-not-displayed-correctly

Since the material created by Y&Y is now definitely free (owned by TUG),
there's no problem using them.  Perhaps someone would like to extract
those fonts and release them to CTAN?  Otherwise, I'll get to it
eventually ...

No idea why.  Did you have by any chance the explorer open on one of
these directories?

This is what I used in the batch script for infrastructure update:

  echo DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW! >con
  echo TeX Live infrastructure update in progress ... >con

Redirection to >con makes sure that the output will appear in the
console window even if you redirect the batch output.  You may

It doesn't, it just deletes main texmf trees one by one.  See for
details tlpkg/installer/uninst*.bat after creating the uninstaller.
If you put your scripts in TL root, they won't be removed
unfortunately (create_uninstaller in TLWinGoo.pm has a hardcoded list
of files/dirs to remove).

Would having distro packages for TL (so you can get update notifications

    I noticed that the documentation for tapir is under latex. Should it
    not be under fonts?

Fixed, thanks.

    Also memdesign is under fonts which does not seem especially
    appropriate.

I didn't care to create doc/typography, or some such, just for a couple
of documents.  If TL included more, then maybe.  fonts/ was the nearest
thing I had available.

(As for the comment about MemoirChapStyles: that document is about
memoir, and memoir is a latex class, so doc/latex seems entirely
appropriate to me.  Which is why I put it there. :)

Yes, but unfortunately Ubuntu is still shipping TeX Live 2009.
Meanwhile, I have gotten used to the frequent TeX Live updates which are
of high quality, so I like to keep using tlmgr.

Also, most GNU/Linux distributions are not really keen on volatile
packages so I do not expect that distributions can offer the same up to
date TeX Live as TeX Live can provide itself. For example Scribus is
also shipped as scribus-ng (development branch) in Ubuntu. Such an
initiative would be welcome for TeX Live too.

I hope, Ubuntu et al. will one day fix all this in a proper way so that
e.g. dependencies in font package are not conflicting anymore.

Fonts in TeX Live are much more up to date than the ttf-* packages. This
gives rise to all sorts of problems at the moment. I had to manually
delete the files in ttf-freefont because they were conflicting with the
newer files shipped by TeX Live and too many Ubuntu package dependencies
prevented me from deinstalling ttf-freefont the correct way.

I extracted the pfb files (with associated afm, pfm), wrote a map file
and it seems to work, but y&y fonts lack 17, 12, 9 and 8 points, so the
map file now looks like:

bbold17 BBOLD17 <bbold10.pfb
bbold12 BBOLD12 <bbold10.pfb
bbold10 BBOLD10 <bbold10.pfb
bbold9 BBOLD9 <bbold10.pfb
bbold8 BBOLD8 <bbold7.pfb
bbold7 BBOLD7 <bbold7.pfb
bbold5 BBOLD5 <bbold5.pfb

Is this right, or should I leave the missing sizes out so that bitmap
fonts are used there?
Also what license should I select when uploading to CTAN, the README
says it is a permissive license but does not specify any.

 Khaled

However, these fonts - in contrast with mathbbm - are sans-serif.

May I suggest adding a comment to the user in the uninstaller

something like

Uninstalling TeXLive, this may take a while please wait ...

at the moment it just starts a cmd.exe and says something.


It might also be an idea at the end to leave a message about the fact 
that there might be files left in TEXDIR.

I've updated mktexpk.exe to check the consistency between
mf-mode dpi and bdpi. If they are inconsistent, mf-mode is reset
and determined according to bdpi.
By using the new mktexpk.exe, necessary PK fonts are generated
in the case of "dvips -Ppdf ...".

Hi Khaled,
thanks for working on it.  However, it looks a bit odd to me.  As far
as I understand, a metric file always has to match the actual font.

If there is no actual font for 17 pt available, one would say in plain
TeX: 

  \font\x=bbold10 at 17 pt

In LaTeX you have to adapt the file 'Ubbold.fd' accordingly.  This is
described in the LaTeX2e font selection guide, chapter 4:

  texdoc fntguide

There are two things to consider:

 1. Since 'Ubbold.fd' already exists, you have to create one with an
    other name.  A dedicated .sty file is also needed.  It's not
    possible to provide a simple replacement.  A real 17pt font has
    other metrics than a 10pt font scaled to 17pt.

 2. The file  texmf-dist/tex/latex/bbold/Ubbold.fd  supports a limited
    set of font sizes only.  This is fine for bitmap fonts because you
    don't want metafont to create bitmaps for 10.3pt if requested by a
    user.  Instead, a 10pt font will be used.

    For Type 1 fonts this restriction isn't necessary.  Thus, instead
    of  

      <10> <10.95> <12> <14.4> <17.28> <20.74> <24.88> bbold10

    it's better to write:

      <10-> bbold10

    Then bbold10 will be used for any size equal or larger than 10pt.

For further questions I recommend

  http://mail.math.utah.edu/mailman/listinfo/tex-fonts

because there are the experts.

  Reinhard

But loading tex.pro and alt-rule.pro still makes sense even on modern
systems, doesn't it?

At least I see rendering of radical signs and fraction bars is much
better in AR when built with latex -> dvips -Ppdf -> ps2pdf.

Right, I didn't think about metrics issue, but I was sure this is a
wrong approach, that is why I asked.

I just wanted to do a single one time job to make these outline fonts
available since they already exist. So I think I'll just provide the
existing fonts as is, and it'll fallback to bitmap for the missing sizes
(which is not worse than current situation).

PS. I'd try to use mfpt1 to make type1 files for the 3 missing sizes,
though still not optimal is not worse than what we already have.

 Khaled

Subject: [tex-live]  bug: packaging of luasseq
Message-ID: <0LC100HWMU0BVHB5@mailhost.uark.edu>


Hi.

The location of files from luasseq needs some changing, at a
minimum luasseq.lua needs to be moved to the tex tree.

This relies on luasseq.lua, which now lies in doc/latex/luasseq/
The most basic loading of luasseq.sty:
   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage{luasseq}
   \begin{document}
   \end{document}
fails because file luasseq.lua cannot be found. Moving it
to the tex tree solves the problem.

Also, since luasseq.sty relies absolutely on lua, it
should probably be in {tex,doc,source}/lualatex/luasseq/ rather
than {tex,doc,source}/latex/luasseq/ where it now resides.

Regards,
Dan

P.S. (off topic) The failure of luasseq happens at the code
   \directlua0{dofile(kpse.find_file("luasseq.lua"))}
and tex seems to hang. Later I realized that I was seeing
a lua prompt. I was rather surprised that dofile wouldn't just
throw an error. Are the luatexbase utilities the recommended
way of dealing with this?

Interesting.  Does dvips *always* produce better results in AR, also
on different platforms, than pdftex?

I suppose that the problem is the implementation of TeX's primitive
\rule in pdftex.  There are two possible ways to implement it:

 1. draw a line with a particular length and width,

 2. draw a rectangle.

In both, PostScript and PDF, lines and rectangles are distinct
primitives.  Former versions of AR rendered them differently and AFAIR
pdftex uses either of of them, dependent on the aspect ratio.

Maybe it makes sense to investigate whether this workaround is still
needed today.

Regards,
  Reinhard

At present you are stuck with tlgmr, but taking  a longer view it becomes
a question of whether collective efforts are better spend improving tlmgr,
reducing the delays in release of distro packages, or some other solution.
TeX Live is hard to package -- it is big and depends on many 3rd party
tools and libraries.

Did you try adding ttf-freefont to the "provides" list in a dummy package?
You probably need to edit some config file to add the TL font dirs so other
apps can find them.

Meanwhile, libraries used in TL are sometimes older than the distro versions.

I tried it and found the same problem (and fix).

Also, on x86_32 linux systems, I get a segmentation fault.  After a
little debugging, I found that it's in pdf_place_glyph (pdfglyph.w:70).
The variable p is a null pointer.

This is on both a 32-bit current Debian system and a 32-bit Centos 4.8
system (but not on 64-bit Linux systems that I tested).  In all cases
I compiled TeXlive for my own weird setup.

Any advice?

You can use \let\luadirect\directlua before luainputenc. 

Perhaps the update announced today of all sort of lua-packages will
solve the problem.

Thanks for refactoring your script so my code can be included. For those
on a recent version of Ubuntu and some knowledge of Python, please test
attached script (at your own risk) before Adam can do an intake. Send
any improvement to me.

The script will prompt via zenity any new changes for TeX Live and can
continue directly to upgrading your installation.

Thanks also to some people on this list who already have tested it and
have provided useful feedback.

Best regards,

Pander

If it's in a *.w file, then it's a LuaTeX bug which should be reported at http://tracker.luatex.org/

Thanks for the advice. I updated as soon as it's been available with tlmgr, and everything works fine with the updated luainputenc.

Sorry, I was too quick in thinking everything is OK again. I must have checked before the update finished, since the same problem shows up again. I guess something changed in the latest LuaTex versions, which causes the new lua*** collection of packages(or part thereof) to be incompatible with the Luatex 0.60 as installed in TeX Live 2010.

There is no such primitive as \luadirect (and never has been in any
TeX Live version of luatex).

Upon further investigation, following Ulrike's remark that i could use

let\luadirect\directlua

before loading luainputenc, I finally found a fix for my problem by loading the luatextra package before luainputenc. The following example :

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luatextra}
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

compiles fine with the latest lua*** collection of packages (but doesn't when removing luatextra or loading luatextra _after_ luainputenc). However, I stumbled upon some annoying side effect of updating these packages. I happen to enjoy using the fouriernc package (combination of New Century Schoolbook text fonts and fourier math fonts). Compiling :

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luatextra}
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}
\usepackage{lipsum, fouriernc}
\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

stops upon loading the fonts, with the alert :

! LaTeX Error: Command `\hbar' already defined.

I found another workaround, with the savesym package :

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{luatextra, savesym}
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}
\savesymbol{hbar}
\usepackage{lipsum, fouriernc}
\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

\luadirect is a command defined by (currently) luacode.sty:

First, the exact syntax of |\directlua| has changed along version of
Lua\TeX, so this package provides a |\luadirect| command which is an
exact synonym of |\directlua| except that it doesn't have the funny,
changing parts of its syntax.\footnote{And also, it expands in two
steps instead of one. If you don't known what it means, then you
probably don't need to.}

I think the definition was previously somewhere else and probably
Manuel simply forget a \RequirePackage while rearranging the code.

(I can't test as miktex hasn't yet the updates).

Of course everyone respects your wish to remove the package from CTAN,
but I want to depose here that I consider this a bad move out of
many reasons:
- tlcontrib is not an official distribution channel of TeX Live, and
  it can and will probably  not provide binaries for all supported
  platforms, not speak of the fact to get them running on all platforms.
- CTAN still *IS* the main TeX related distribution channel, and not
  something like "TeX Live staging area". THere might be other people
  wanting to grab biber from there.
- Being out-of-date is the sole responsibility of people around biber.
  THose who are uploading and preparing packages for TLContrib could
  easily upload up to date sources and binaries to CTAN, too.

> it's a bit sad, since i was browing the code in spare moments... :-}

I agree with Robin here. For me is retracting from CTAN a very bad
sign to the whole TeX community. 

I hope that those preparing packages for TLcontrib can also contribute
to CTAN and the distribution of biber on CTAN, but of course as long
as you Philip are voting for removal, it will stay like that.

Speaking for myself, but from a TeX Live perspective
slightly disappointed

Remember there are other distributions e.g. MiKTeX. They certainly
take packaes from CTAN. I am afraid they will not take SW from
TLcontrib. Out-of-date is often better than nothing.

I myself am slightly disappointed by this decision also. I can
understand why as developer you do not want multiple distribution
channels, but it would be good if everything that can be on CTAN
stays available there: from the user-side of things, that is
still the canonical place for tex-related software. Definitely
tlcontrib is not meant to replace CTAN in any way whatsoever.

Best wishes,
Taco

while this is indeed true, i've seen no sign yet of miktex distribution
of biber.

i don't know if christian schenk reads the tex live list, but he
definitely does read ctan-ann, so he knows now to put any ambitions of
packaging on the back burner.  (he's got plenty to do, anyway.)

i'm pleased i'm not alone in being sad that the package has gone: i
often wonder whether my pleasure at the appearance of a new package is
nothing more than my old stamp-collecting instinct coming out...

that one is from 'lmextra'

this one from 'context'.

Hi,

  I tried to use the bibtex style:

  I put hep.bst into texmf-local/bibtex/bst/local/ and run texhash as 
well as mktexlsr. But when I use \bibliographystyle{hep} in my paper, it 
doesn't work. When I replace hep with plain or alpha, it works, but 
that's not what I want.

  Suggestions please. Thanks.

I sent a message to Manuel, who has been kind enough to answer very quickly. As a matter of fact, I happened to stumble upon a real bug, since Manuel had decided that luainputenc should not load luatextra anymore; but failed to check that luainputenc did not use any alias defined by luatextra. A revised version of luainputenc should be on its way to CTAN correcting the bug.

He also pointed out that the other bug I reported (\hbar being defined twice) was a side effect of loading luatextra, hence fontspec. Hopefully, with the new version of luainputenc, loading luatextra won't be necessary anymore and this second bug will automatically vanish. My first example shall compile again with my favourite choice of fonts :

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{luainputenc}
\usepackage{lipsum, fouriernc}
\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

Anyway, it's been quite instructive for me to read all your answers in and outside the list : thank you all for your patience and cooperation,

Well, I didn't realise that this would raise such issues. If you think it's a good idea, I can put it back but the issue for me was that we have moved pretty much to a binary distribution and almost nobody tries to use the perl install version any more. It's not clear to me how we can distribute this via CTAN. If you all think it's for the best to leave it on CTAN, I will upload a new version and make it part of my release procedure but very few people will ever use it in this way until it's part of the TL install and can be updated/fetched in binary format.

Thanks for putting it back.  Although it doesn't seem like it, working
on getting this into TL is actually high on my list.  Sorry for the
endless delay.

Howdy,

What is the full path you used? What system are you running on? Is your distribution owned by root? If so you need to run `sudo texhash` and give an admin password.

Good Luck,

    I have found a duplicate file

In my vanilla TL'10 install, and in the sources, there is only one file:
texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/hoekwater/lmextra/lmtypewriter10-regular.ttf

So I can't say where you got your other one.

In any case, two identical files in the runtime are not a bug.

This sounds reasonable.  They are metric compatible with the Metafont
version then.  If they are not optimal, maybe Jacko can be persuaded
to provide improved ones later.  Do you have FontForge installed?
Then mf2pt1 will autohint the fonts, which significantly improves
their quality.

The advantage of this approach is compatibility.  Only the missing
.pfb files and a map file is needed.

Ubbold.fd provided by Alan Jeffrey looks fine.  However, I fear that
files have to be renamed because metrics of scaled fonts are
different.  Hence I find Khaled's approach less cumbersome and LaTeX
users are not bothered with one more package.

Could it be that the log you posted was from an earlier run? Because

Indeed, the log file is old, thanks for the hint.

When I run the command manually, everything seems to work:

Also fmtutil-sys --byfmt metafun seems to work. Could this be related to the fact that I use TLcontrib? Maybe the versions of MetaFun and MetaPost don't match directly after updating from the main repository?

Ok, that explains it.

The 'metafun' format generation is actually controlled by the context
package. In the normal context package from texlive, this works fine
because metapost 1.211 still created mem files. But the metapost from
tlcontrib no longer does so, and  that is why fmtutil complains: it
is not the return value of the command but the fact that it does not
produce an actual metafun.mem file.

The context package in tlcontrib is changed to assume that metapost is
version 1.502 or up, and therefore does not have the line that forces
fmtutil to attempt to create metafun.mem, hence no error either.

You can either upgrade context from tlcontrib, or disable metafun.mem
using fmtutil.

Best wishes,
Taco

workaround should be to replace the x86_64 version with the i386 versiion:

GLIBC_2.0
GLIBC_2.1

Since I just did an update, it isn't obvious how to test the backups
without waiting for an update to appear.

Where exactly do you see the problem practically? I use CentOS on
x86_64 which is a RHEL based distro, glibc is 2.5.34 but tlmgr updates
TL without any problem, formats were rebuilt without any error. I have
only TL2010 pretest on my i386 notebook.

The problem is that tlmgr can't create the backups when xz.x86_64-linux
fails to run.  Do you have backups enabled "tlmgr config .."?   I don't know
if there are any other programs that need GLIBC_2.6 since I'm using i386
binaries.

Interesting.   Either your xz.x86_64-linux is different from mine or
tlmgr is finding some
other xz.   I assume tlmgr always uses
...tlpkg/installer/xz/xz.x86_64-linux.  I just ran
tlmgr-latest, and now:

$ strings xz.x86_64-linux | grep GLIBC
GLIBC_2.2
GLIBC_2.0
GLIBC_2.1
GLIBC_2.3

The old version was dated May 28th, while xz.i386_linux was dated
June.  I'm sure "tlmgr update --self" has been run many times -- maybe
that doesn't update the installer binaries.

Your version doesn't need any non-existent libraries.   After running
update-tlmgr-latest.sh  mine seems to be working, but I'll feel better
after a real update has succeeded in making backups.

Subject: [tex-live] w32transplant on 64-bit windows 7
Message-ID: <4CEBE7A3.4090203@imf.au.dk>

Hi, does any one know if the installation process is different on 
win7-64bit than on win7-32bit

My w32transplant seems to be working well on 32bit windows. But not 
particularly well on 64-bit windows. For example the items in the menu 
does not seem to get any icons and clicking on them fails to start any 
programs, so I guess something extra is needed on 64-bit windows.

The w32transplant script it based on the w32client2010 script. Has any 
one tried this with 64-bit win7?

I don't have any 64-bit win7 to test on at the moment, so I need a bit 
of help on this matter.

Seems harmless, but it asked me to report it:

I ran
   tlmgr update --all
all seemed to go well, except this

   [1/11] auto-remove: asciichart
   [2/11, ??:??/??:??] update: advdate [146k] (17048 -> 20538) ... done
   tlmgr: inconsistency on the server:
   tlmgr: tlp for package asciichart cannot be found, please report.

All went well after that. asciichart was in fact removed (and ascii-chart
installed later on). Package repository was

Hmm, strange, I didn't see this message ..., in my case asciichart was
removed and ascii-chart installed, without any warning.

Anyway... thanks for reporting.. although it puzzles me a bit. In the
code of tlmgr that leads up to the above error message there I have written:
      # we checked already that this package is present!
      # but our checks seem to be wrong, no idea why
      # ahhh, it seems that it can happen due to a stupid incident, a bug
      # on the server:
      # - remove a package from a collection
      # - at the same time increase its version number
      # then what happens is:
      # - first the package is removed (auto-remove!)
      # - then it is tried to be updated here, which is not working!
      # report that and ask for report
(I like to write my comments in a bit peculiar way)

But it does *NOT* explain why asciichart was tried to be updated...

Best wishes

I also got this message (in between the asciichart removal and the
ascii-chart auto-install) but it has disappeared today. OS is XP SP3.

I saw this on one machine, but not a 2nd machine that I updated from the
same server a few minutes later.  I assumed it was little issue with the
server (e.g., database and files momentarily not in sync), but funny that
one package seems to have a similar issue for many users and different
servers.

All fine, Karl told me what has happened and it was exactely the
situation described in the source code comments.

Thanks for reporting, it *was* an error on our side for one day
that was fixed the next day.

No harm done anyway ;-)

I?ve used tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010 to update my luatex. With Windows, this
was no problem, but now with Snow Leopard (MacOs X) Updating or installing
luatex  I found problems generating the formatfile

output:
fmtutil: fmtutil: unknown option `--no-error-if-no-format'. Try fmtutil
--help for help.


I tried also fmtutil-sys --missing without an effect, also 
mktexfmt lualatex.fmt

The problem is the same using --repository http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/2010

In /usr/texbin is no luatex, but a link lualatex -> luatex. If I copy luatex
to /usr/texbin i get fatal format file error. 

Any idea?

TIA,

Robert

Message-ID: <AANLkTinxd+p+qqT4rXt+NxBrebyVmVx6XoeB5+JmTArB@mail.gmail.com>

I had been quite happy using texlive 2007. I decided to upgrade and have
encountered problems that I cannt really find.


The first problem is any of the new software that came with texlive2010
doesn't work.

I get error

c:\texlive\2010\bin\win32\runscript.tlu:441 bad argument #1 to 'lower'
(string expected, got nil)


then when running LED I get error

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.11 (Web2C 2010)
 Source specials enabled.
---! Must increase the trie size
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)
25-11-2010 13:46:20: STOP

I had no problem with texlive 2007, everything worked great from the start.
ALso I don't know why te default is pdflatex. latex should be latex and
pdflatex should be pdflatex.


I have tried looking for these errors but when I finally do get to where
errors were reporting a seach windows always goes directly to google and the
entire world. I would have thought I could just search to messages fo the
erros to correct this. I will try to spend a couple more house on this but I
need the latex to work now and not wait for a response so I will hopefully
reset the system to an eariler state and hopefully texlive 2007 will bu
used.

Do you by chance have TL 2009 *AND* TL 2010 installed, and your preference
is set to use 2009?

What does 
	which fmtutil
say on the command line.

Umpf.

Can you please do the following:
- opena cmd.exe window

- type
	tlmgr --version
  and send us the output

- type
	tlmgr conf
  and send us the output

- check that you don't have any other environment variables set

- did you uninstall/remove TL2007 *completely*

Yes, now I have installed TL over the system, the updates are going
forward. Font database will be generated - now it looks fine.

That looks *VERY* fishy .... I don't think this is the right place.
How did that file end up there, I don't believe that any of TL,
MacTeXor TLContrib puts files there.

Maybe you did yourself copies at some point???

It looks like a MacPorts install of TeXLive. See question 3 here:

/usr/texbin/ is not a real directory, but a symlink to, in my machine,

/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin

Although everything seems fine already with your system, it might be good to read the FAQ above.

They are. pdfTeX is the *engine* for both LaTeX (output *.dvi) and pdfLaTeX (output *.pdf) ---and, obviously, for plain pdfTeX.

Even minimal example

\documentclass[article]
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
blah
\end{document}
returns this error (rather harmless if one just continues)

Thanks! Manual replacement at the single place (where it occurs) line 128 in
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/hyperref/hyperref.sty
saves the day - for those who does not want to wait for an update making its way

Robert,

As others have conjectured, the presence of /opt/local/bin/fmtutil says that you have
a MacPorts TeX distribution installed. The MacPorts people add /opt/local/bin
to the BEGINNING of your path, so this location is always found when you use
Terminal. 

The solution is to add /usr/texbin to the BEGINNING of your path in your
shell configuration script, after it has been modified by MacPorts. The
TeX Distribution panel should then recognize both the MacPorts version and
the TeX Live version and allow you to switch between them.

We have had some communication with the MacPorts people and will improve
the situation slightly in the future. But they tell me that it will still be necessary
to manually add /usr/texbin to the beginning of your PATH.

Hi Werner,
I get

$ TEXDOC_VIEWER_PDF=less texdoc texdoc
"/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/texdoc/texdoc.pdf" may be a binary file.  See it anyway? 

but I don't expect that this works everywhere else.  It depends on the
environment.  Please keep in mind that if you set PDFVIEWER=evince,
you don't tell texdoc to use evince as a PDF viewer.  You just add a
new variable to your environment.

Accoding to the manual, the variable "PDFVIEWER_texdoc" has highest
precedence.  I suppose that the variable "PDFVIEWER" has lowest
precedence because it's assumed to be a system default, i.e. not
texdoc related.

Do you have any texdoc-related variables already set in your environment?

 > Bug?

Maybe.  It makes sense to try to make programs work out-of-the-box.
It's required then to check whether a particular system default
exists.

What IMO doesn't make any sense at all is to support zillions of
ancient versions of texdoc, even the shell script from teTeX.  At a
first glance it's nice if people who switch from teTeX to TeX Live
still get the same PDF viewer as in teTeX.  But we are living in 2010
now and IMO backward compatibility with teTeX isn't needed anymore.
It adds extra complexity to the program and to the documentation.  

IMO it's better to drop backward compatibility (ignore environment
variables used by older versions of texdoc) in order to avoid
confusion.

Regards,
  Reinhard

tlmgr can do it. Anyway, I do not use them but rather change the PATH.
It allows me to have several TL versions and switch between them
easily. I have a Tcl/Tk script to do it easily.

RIght.

> How can I create the symlinks as root in Linux?

First check that
	tlmgr option sys_bin
	tlmgr option sys_man
	tlmgr option sys_info
has the values you want for the respective classes of files
(binaries, man pages, info pages),

then call
	tlmgr path add
(as root)

ALl documented in
	tlmgr help

Thanks for your help, Zdenek.

I guess that I only need one TL version, so tlmgr is the right way to do 
it for me.

Thanks for your help, Norbert.

I don't know whether reinstalling what it had been already installed 
makes any sense (besides updating packages).

Thanks again. It worked fine, but I get the following error:

tlmgr update --all
tlmgr: package repository

Sorry, I didn't knew that.

I have googled for this error and I found a thread 
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2008-December/019516.html and 
following your suggestions there, I'm afraid that I get the same result 
with "tlmgr -v update --list" and "tlmgr -v -v update --list":

D:W: texlive.infra is mentioned somewhere but not available, disabling
DD:post_select = texlive.infra

Fundamental package texlive.infra not present, uh oh, goodbyeSerious

Do I have to reinstall everything again?

Umpf ... did you move *ALL* files, esp tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb?
Did you *DO* start a new installation into the same dir? Then it might
be broken.

Where did you install to?

how does
	TEXROOT/2010/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
look like? (TEXROOT is probably /usr/local/texlive).

Hardly, it seems that you messed up the database ...
