Hi,

i just tried with Tex Live SVN, naively:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{libertine}
\begin{document}
\rmdefault
\input tufte
\end{document}

but it gives:

  (/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/libertine/fxb.inc))
  (./xx.aux)

  LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/fxl/m/n' undefined
  (Font)              using `OT1/cmr/m/n' instead on input line 3.

  (/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/context/sample/tufte.tex)
  [1{/usr/local
  /texlive/2009/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}] (./xx.aux)

  LaTeX Font Warning: Some font shapes were not available, defaults
  substituted.

so cmr is used instead. is it a problem with installation, or is simply
my test file wrong?

Regards, Hartmut

Subject: [tex-live] tlnet freeze coming soon
Message-ID: <201005022340.o42NeWXu015460@f7.net>

In hopes of finishing the software release substantially earlier this
year than previously, we expect to freeze tlnet updates for TL'09 in a
few days, so we can finalize the changes for TL'10.

We expect to still keep up with CTAN updates until we are building
candidate releases, so it's not urgent for package developers to make
immediate releases or anything.  More announcements when the time comes.

Best,
Karl

P.S. Since people ask about this every year: Although it's technically
conceivable to continue tlnet updates while working on the new version,
we simply don't have the time available to keep multiple trees up to
date; automatic merge tools don't suffice, unfortunately.  Maybe next
year ...

Subject: [tex-live]  bug report: dvisvgm cannot use TL
Message-ID: <201005031049.14578.axel.struebing@freenet.de>

Hi,

I tried dvisvgm on two linux distributions, OpenSUSE 11.1 x86_64, debian etch 
i386.
This program has to be compiled against libkpathsea, which TL does not provide 
and therefore had been installed from the distribution(s).

Using an adopted texmf.cnf to search in the TL-tree, dvisvgm is not able to 
complete and crashes after opening texfonts.map

The problem was having a 0x20 0x0A last line in texfonts.map leading to double 
free's later on.

I am not sure if this is a kpathsea bug in the distributors packages of 
libkpathsea or if the format of the fontmap file forbids the aforementioned 
last line. The kpathsea documentation just explicitely mentions 'blank 
lines'.
Having only line breaks (0x0A) at the end of texfonts.map is fine for me.

So I want to suggest to correct texfonts.map anyway. It would play nice - even 
if some external libkpathsea package should be slightly broken.

80 with http mirrors, 21 (and possibly others) with ftp mirrors (most likely to
be blocked). Default repo is a dispatching host which may redirect you to a ftp
mirror.

I suggest you explicitly select a http mirror, port 80 is very unlikely to be
blocked. Example:

tlmgr option repository http://ftp.oleane.net/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet

Complete list of mirrors at (for instance):

http://distrib-coffee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/pub/mirrors/ctan/CTAN.sites

You only need to append the systems/texlive/tlnet part.

AFAIK tlmgr uses wget for download. wget supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.
So the ports 21, 80, and 433 should be more than sufficient.

Hi Axel,

    I tried dvisvgm on two linux distributions, OpenSUSE 11.1 x86_64,
    debian etch ...

I'll get rid of the space in texfonts.map (which should be accepted, but
there's no sense insisting on it), but the bug in dvisvgm needs to be
reported to the program author and/or distro maintainers, depending on
where you got it.

Thanks,
Karl

I compiled libkpathsea.a from TL build and placed it to


/usr/lib/libkpathsea.a

(from  pathto/kpathsea_source/texk/kpathsea/.deps/ if I remember correctly)


So, I was able to compile dvisvgm on MacOSX 10.6. I am not sure in
details (it was in Nov 2009) but my impression was that getting not
complete TL source but only kpathsea was sufficient (at least on
another computer I copied ONLY kpathsea directory and compiled - and
this was a different architecture). May be the source of kpathsea as a
separate download could be provided?

I tracked this down.  A workaround is to comment out lines 1104 and 1105
in /Library/Perl/5.8.8/darwin-thread-multi-2level/Tk/Widget.pm, which read:

$mw->Tk::bind($class, '<MouseWheel>',
          [ sub { $_[0]->yview('scroll',-($_[1]/120)*3,'units') },
Tk::Ev("D")]);

On my system I still get scrolling (using a M$ wheelmouse), presumably from
the unix button mappings.

There is another way to get the same error
<http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=38746>
with some older versions of tk for people who have updated X11 but not tk:

"In x11proto-core 7.0.13, a new event (``GenericEvent'') was added at the
end of the list, after ``MappingNotify''. Since the Tk toolkit's event
management was poorly designed, older versions of the Tk toolkit and
current version of Perl-Tk fail at runtime with the message "no event
type or button # or keysym" when compiled against (or even run under ?)
an X11 server with the new event list."

The suggested (workaround) is a patch:

Several years ago this problem cropped up for pdftex-1.40 and changes
were made to libkpathsea.

I agree, but what you are doing is fragile and the result may only be
useful to you.

As  Victor Ivrii notes, it should be enough to get the kpathsea
sources, but in any case

ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/texlive/Source/texlive-20091011-source.tar.xz (28M)

should allow you to build a working libkpathsea.a and will also have
the necessary
header files.

Sorry that I haven't read the full thread, and switch in lately, it would be
nice anyway if you could provide a stable use case for dvisvgm, I mean how to
break it on your side, to check if I have the same problem here.

Maybe its a problem of the Suse distribution.  It seems that the gentoo
distribution doesn't have this problem (though TL-2009 is still marked beta there).

But I'm not very sure about that as I just do some first experiments with
dvisvgm, which worked quite nice, though I'm not that happy with my browsers SVG
Viewer, yet.

For anyone who likes using gentoo too I build a quick dvisvgm-9999.ebuild that
installs the latest dvisvgm from the mercurial repositories head.

On first sight this ebuild works compiled against the texlive-core-2009 gentoo
package, which installs a libkpathsea.so.5.0.0 .

Message-ID: <201005071012.12980.axel.struebing@freenet.de>

Hi Ingo,

I did produce a simple texfile containing just an equation (\pagestyle{empty}) 
and afterwards the dvi.
----
\begin{equation}
	A  \subsetneq B
\end{equation}
-----

I used following script for conversion and had an texmf.cnf in the working dir 
where $SELFAUTO...-variables from kpathsea were replaced by $TEXLIVEBASE
---------
#! /bin/bash

export TEXLIVEBASE=/usr/local/texlive/2008
export TEXMFCNF=.:/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/web2c/

/usr/local/bin/dvisvgm $@
---------

If you have the mentioned failure calling the script on the dvi with -n option 
you get a svg, that is empty on viewing (has no contained <path> element ).

Hope this helps
Axel

Hi all,

thank you for all the information. I already expected kpathsea to be the true 
reason. The dvisvgm code is correct in this aspect.
My original intention was to ask you to make live easier for TL users, what 
are you going to do (thank you Karl).
That is all I ever expected because the kpathsea used building TL obviously 
handles the texfonts.map right.

So thanks again and treat this topic as solved.

texinfo was updated recently, so it looks as if tug's mirror of
cambridge (i'm the portal for texlive stuff) failed.  jim will no doubt
rerun the mirror when he gets a moment (he's very busy just now) so,
pro tem, redo your update with www.tex.ac.uk as your repository.

don't use a n. american mirror just now, since most of them mirror from
tug...

don't hang on to www.tex.ac.uk as a general rule, either: while there's
ridiculously much x-atlantic bandwidth nowadays, it's not good general
practice.

(i've checked texinfo, logged in to the tug box itself.  probably the
other things suffered from the same problem, but i've not checked them.)

No, it didn't. I faithfully deleted a lot of files, texinfo being among them, 
both at tug.ctan.org and dante.ctan.org. 

I'm just now running both mirrors. Expect things to be in sync soon.

i do two extra mirror runs, against exactly this possibility (i saw the
deletions happening in my first mirror, now you mention it, but since
the files were all still there when i got to look, i guessed it must
have been a transient).

my jobs run at 0100 (part of main mirror run, typically doesn't pick
much up) and 0310 and 0710 (remirroring tl only).  all times local.

I suspect that you need to (re)install these for new albeit forcibly
removed packages. As I don't use TL Utility often I am not sure if it
provides such option

It does.  IIRC you can just choose the forcibly removed package(s) in the list and click the Install button.

I've looked around your website pretty thoroughly yesterday and today and I
have not been able to locate a list of what packages are included in each
collection.

I'm trying to install a TeX Live distribution that is relatively small in
size but I have need for a handful of specific packages.  I also need the
installation process to be simple, so I'd like to be able to figure out the
minimal number of collections I need to get the packages I want.  I presume
there must be a list somewhere of exactly which packages are included in
each collection, but have been unable to find it.  If you could point me to
that list I would appreciate it.


Thanks,
Brent

Message-ID: <hs1ib1$8v3$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hello,

I would like to pass some addittional paths to latex, pdflatex, xetex
or bibtex. For this purpose I can use in MiKTeX a commandline option
"--include-directory=dir", e.g.:

bibtex -include-directory=sty -include-directory=bib document.tex
or
latex -include-directory=sty -include-directory=bib document.tex

and the subdirectories "sty" and "bib" of the active path, where my
"document.tex" resides and where I call latex, pdflatex, xetex, bibtex, etc.
will be added to search for additional files like *.bib files or for my own
*.sty files

How can I achieve that within texlive? Btw: TL 2009, windows(7)

Have a look at:

http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb

Each paragraph starting with "collection <name>" defines a collection.

Or just make a minimal installation and add the rest with tlmgr
afterwards.  The GUI will let you browse and filter all
packages/collections/schemes and explore their content in a very easy
way.

    How can I achieve that within texlive? Btw: TL 2009, windows(7)

There is no command line option, unfortunately.  Maybe someday there
will be.  To date, you have to set environment variables.  In Windows
syntax (I think):

set TEXINPUTS=sty:
set BIBINPUTS=bib:

latex ...
bibtex ...

Putting the files in the TEXMFHOME tree is another possibility.  See the
TL/kpathsea documentation about that, and the file texmf.cnf.

Best,
Karl

Yes, I thought this will work, but it's a little bit strange. Because
if I don't define these vars, then I get the error that the bib data and
the style files cannot be found. ok. But if I set these vars as:

set BIBINPUTS=.;bib
set TEXINPUTS=.;tex\sty

then bibtex find my bib data but latex doesn't find the class book.cls ???
Strange. Isn't it?

btw: The setup-process of TeX-Live (tlmgr) doesn't set any var in the
systems or user environment. Even if I start tlmgr as an elevated
Adminstrator (which is similar to the root account on unix/linux)

I'm new to texlive and for me it looks like that the BIBINPUTS and
the TEXNPUTS overwrite some "defaults"

btw: The command "tlmgr conf" looks good and all seem to be right

See: http://tjung.lima-city.de/tex/texlive/tlmgr/conf/

No.  Expected.  Read the "default expansion" section of kpathsea.
When you define TEXINPUTS as .;tex\sty, you're telling TeX to look in
*only* those two directories.  A trailing semicolon, as in:
    set TEXINPUTS=.;tex\sty;
will tell TeX to look also in the "system" directories, which is what
you want.

    btw: The setup-process of TeX-Live (tlmgr) doesn't set any var in the
    systems or user environment. 

Completely intended.  The current state of things is for normal
operation to require *no* environment variable settings.  Such settings
have been the cause of much agony on everyone's parts over the years.

You have to set envvars only because you want to use special directories
that are (a) not the current directory and (b) not under TEXMFHOME.

    I'm new to texlive and for me it looks like that the BIBINPUTS and
    the TEXNPUTS overwrite some "defaults"

Not exactly.  See above.

Happy searching,
Karl

note, this is _not_ what karl recommended.

not at all.  your .;bib is a complete path, as is .;tex\sty

given a complete path, the program will use just that, whereas you want
it to use its built-in values *as* *well* *as* what you've told it.

this is what the trailing ";" in karl's suggestion was about: so you
want

set BIBINPUTS=bib;
set TEXINPUTS=tex\sty;

the programs replace that trailing empty path component with the
built-in values.

indeed not.  the programs "know" from the hash files where to look for
inputs, by default.  (this is the "built-in values" i mentioned above.)

I don't implement to understand TEXINPUTS=sty:
Please use
TEXINPUTS=sty: on Unix and
TEXINPUTS=sty; on Windows. sorry.

Message-ID: <4BE664DC.4010309@telecom-bretagne.eu>

Hello,

I have two versions of a file, one for LuaTeX and one for the other 
engines. My plan was to put the file for LuaTeX in texmf/tex/luatex and 
the other in texmf/tex/generic, so that the LuaTeX file would be found 
by luatex only, and would also be found first by luatex instead of the 
other file. The problem is that this doesn't seem to work at all:

eroux at norgz-laptop:~$ kpsewhich -all hyphen.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/generic/babel/hyphen.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/lambda/antomega/hyphen.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/hyphen.cfg

eroux at norgz-laptop:~$ kpsewhich -engine luatex -all hyphen.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/generic/babel/hyphen.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/lambda/antomega/hyphen.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/hyphen.cfg

eroux at norgz-laptop:~$ kpsewhich -engine luatex -all etex.src
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/etex.src
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/plain/etex/etex.src

eroux at norgz-laptop:~$ kpsewhich -all etex.src
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/etex.src
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/plain/etex/etex.src

You can see that the hyphen.cfg in generic/ is found first whatever the 
engine, and that etex.src in luatex/ is found first whatever the 
engine... Did I do something wrong with the options of kpse? I have a 
Debian TeXLive 2009, does this happen also on other TeXLive?

If these are bugs, I think they will need to be fixed in TeXLive 2010, 
as the situation I describe will really appear.

Thank you,

You can define the order of priority by
TEXINPUTS.programname
The suitable option in kpsewhich is --progname=programname:
kpsewhich --progname=lualatex ...

Thank you for your answer, sadly this does not fix the problem: I have 
the two following lines in texmf.cnf:

TEXINPUTS.luatex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{luatex,plain,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.tex = .;$TEXMF/tex/{plain,generic,}//

and I still have

eroux at norgz-laptop:~$ kpsewhich --progname=tex -all etex.src
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/etex.src
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/plain/etex/etex.src

IIRC if you set the --all option, the ordering is not
taken care of, since it is not important for the purpose.
Please try without the --all option.

You're right (as usual). It work here:

mpg at roth:~% kpsewhich -progname luatex hyphen.cfg
/home/mpg/texmf/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/hyphen.cfg
mpg at roth:~% kpsewhich -progname tex hyphen.cfg
/home/mpg/tl/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/hyphen.cfg
mpg at roth:~% kpsewhich -progname latex hyphen.cfg
/home/mpg/tl/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/hyphen.cfg
mpg at roth:~% kpsewhich -progname lualatex hyphen.cfg
/home/mpg/texmf/tex/luatex/hyph-utf8/hyphen.cfg

By the way, ?lie, I tested that two weeks ago and adapted TEXINPUTS.lualatex
precisely to make it work the right way (it was not working ok for lualatex before).

Also, I found that it is usually more reliable not to use kpsewhich to test this
sort of things, since we usually get the options wrong on the first try. Here it
is more reliable to rebuild the (lua)(la)tex formats using fmtutil and look at
the banners to check the right file was used.

We need to make sure that both lualatex and dvilualatex find the luatex
specific file first, IIRC, I'd to duplicate the file under both lualatex
and dvilualatex which is not good idea IMO.

I fixed the search paths for all luatex-based formats on 2010-04-27. There was
indeed a problem with dvilualatex until then. Now everything should be ok.

First of all this is wrong mailing list for your question. texhax is
more suitable one.

The advice strongly depends on context.

There are two different scenarios.

1. You have your own style and bibliography files and you use them
frequently in many (independent) documents.
Put them into $TEXMFHOME so after that you could use them in any document.

Suppose you have 'mystyle.sty' style file and 'mybiblio.bib'
bibliography file. Put them into
$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/myNAME
and
$TEXMFHOME/bibtex/bib/myNAME
respectively, regenerate filename database and use in your documents
...
\usepackage{mystyle}
...
\bibliography{mybiblio}
...
Processing a document will be simple
latex myDOCUMENT
bibtex myDOCUMENT

2. You work on document with its own style file and own bibliography
file (only this document needs them).
To organize your work you make on top level directories
sty/
bib/
and put any style files and bibliography files there.

I advise you to call files with they relative paths so there wouldn't
question about options. But if you choose another way... you have to
set up variables TEXINPUTS and BIBINPUTS.

I recommend you to write a batch wrappers that will set these
variables locally and call latex or bibtex.

Sorry, but I disagree here. How to set search paths for *tex (or where to place
files so that they are found) is completely distro-dependant.

texhax  	General TeX discussion and questions

I didn't work on Mac but I work with both TeX Live and MiKTeX. If
we're talking about TDS compliant distro (as I understand both TeX
Live and MiKTeX are TDS compliant)  then my first advice concerns both
so this should go in texhax mailing list. As for my second advice
then, yes, it is TeX Live specific question and should be ask here, of
course.

I mentioned advices in the order of preference (the first is most acceptable).

Without details it is hard to give another advice (I consider use of
command line options or environment variables as the worst way of
every day latex/bibtex practice).

Well, unless I'm mistaken, there's no TEXMFHOME on MikTeX, so even your first
advice was slightly distro-dependant (a more "portable" advice could be "put the
files in one of the TDS trees provided by your distro).

Now, I realise my previous reply wasn't so clear: IMO the question is
appropriate both on texhax and here, since the poster doesn't know a priori if
there is a distro-independent solution. (Unlike some other questions which
clearly doesn't belong here at all.)

Well, IMO they're fine if they are wrapped in a script or a Makefile.

Ok, I see. Great. Now it's working and running fine.
Thank you to all who gave me a reply.

But had to install two packages by myself. "floatflt" and "colortab".
This is no problem for me, but was wondering because everybody
said to me tex-live is the most complete distribution.
Is there a reason why this two packages are not in the "main" tree?
Btw: In MiKTeX these packages are in the "main" tree.

Anyway its working and seems to be much faster than MiKTeX

Finally I have an additional question about kpathsea
Is there a way to supress the message:

---snip---

kpathsea: Running mktextex document.out

The command name is C:\texlive\2009\bin\win32\mktextex

---snap---

I have to run latex and bibtex several times to build my document
and I redirect stdout of the most commands (except the last latex)
to the null device, but this message ist upcouming and disturbs me
a little, because it comes up over 12 or more times.

Licences. According to the catalogue:
- colortab: Free for use but distribution for profit only by arrangement
- floatflt: Other non-Debian licenses
(I didn't check further.)

According to <http://miktex.org/copying>:

which is almost exactly the licence policy of TeX Live too. But it's not the
first time I hear of something being in MikTeX while it's excluded from TeX Live
due to license issues. I don't understand why these things still are in MikTeX.

(straightforward no-sell licence.  definitely impossible to put this in
tex live, which can sometimes find itself being sold.)

"you may not modify" the source .dtx or .ins.  this is a stronger
requirement than knuth's (change name if modify), which tex live accepts
(rightly, i think, not that it's any of my business).

it's a bore, this sort of thing; but there are people who feel the need
to apply protection to their code, even if it makes life difficult for
their users.  remember, it's only with the advent of tex live and the
like that that installation has become a straightforward matter, for the
most part; when i got my first tex installation, it came on a 9-track
tape, and in those pre-ctan days, one had really to hunt for packages.
if you had to install a new package by hand, after all that.

but it was quite a while back, when things started to change.  when seb
rahtz started tex live, we agreed a uk tug grant of *several hundred
pounds* for a cd writer for him (we all had _readers_ by then, but a
_writer_...).

the last dvd writer i bought cost ?17...

It was my mistake, and it will be fixed next time.
For a workaround, please write a line in texmf.cnf:

MKTEXTEX = 0

Hi all,

Has anyone tried to contact the owners of those packages and explain the

Maybe the more people ask, the better.

Dear All,

I am using latex for my project purpose.

I am using xtabular(longtable) environment to generate tables in pdf. It 
is working fine but the problem i am facing tables with lengthy rows it is 
not able to split row across pages.

So the contents are going inside the footer. Is their any environment so 
that i cane split the row across pages.

Pradeep

just a final question about the order, because a ; or : at the beginning
works also.

If I set the env var to this TEXINPUTS=sty; then the subdiretory sty
and then the system path will be searched for style files and perhaps
my own styles will be overwritten. And if I set TEXINPUTS=;sty then
_first_ the tex system paths are searched for style files and then the sty
subdirectory will be searched for style files and perhaps existing
tex system styles will be overwritten by my styles?

Is that right ?

Thomas

Right.

Wrong. The first file found is used. Since your sty subdir is searched first,
your files will overwrite the system versions.

Right and wrong for the same reason :-)

Hi Pradeep,,

Couple of things:

1. This is not the right list for this kind of enquiry. You should  
post to texhax or similar.
2. About your question. Rows only split in MS Word that I have found  
over the years. So...
3. If you have rows you want shortened so that they continue on the  
next page, split it manually where you want it to break or shorten the  
content.

Cheers
Alan

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1005112151430.6211@hahepc1.hahe>

Hi,

just found by accident that when running "texconfig-sys init" within the
/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux directory, i get these two
failures:

This is a summary of all `failed' messages:
`pdftex -ini  -jobname=amstex -progname=amstex -translate-file=cp227.tcx *amstex.ini' failed
`pdftex -ini  -jobname=eplain -progname=eplain -translate-file=cp227.tcx *eplain.ini' failed

Both seem to have a similar cause. The 1st line fails, since in file
amstex.ini there is "\input amstex", and instead of file "amstex.tex"
actually the "amstex" binary is read, giving such an error:

! Text line contains an invalid character.
l.1 ^^?
       ELF^^B^^A^^A^^@^^@^^@^^@^^@^^@^^@^^@^^@^^B^^@>^^@^^A^^@^^@^^@P3@^^@^^...

But when running texconfig-sys outside the bin/x86_64-linux directory,
everything is fine, the file "amstex.tex" is used.

No idea if it's worthwile to fix this, but i also wonder that when there
is a file "foo" and a file "foo.tex" in some directory, and i do "\input
foo" in that directory, the file "foo.tex" is read, so in this case the
extension ".tex" is used. But not in the above case, where the binary
"amstex" has precendence over "amstex.tex".

No, the current directory, where asmtex is found, has precedence over the
directory where amstex.tex is found. This is easily verified by putting
amstex.tex in the current directory too: it will be used first.

search order:

(1) foo
    try foo.tex , next try foo

(2) foo.bar
if try_std_extension_first = y
    try foo.bar.tex , next try foo.bar
if try_std_extension_first = f
    try foo.bar , next try foo.bar.tex

Unfortunately, the search is done for each directory in order
not to lose efficiency.

As previously warned, TeX Live net updates (tlnet) are now frozen so we
can move ahead of TL 2010.

We'll continue to include CTAN updates in the live tree until
we have new binaries and are closer to the release.

    actually the "amstex" binary is read, giving such an error:

    l.1 ^^?

I asked AMS tech-support to add explicit extensions to amstex.ini, as we
have done with other .ini files.

I?m confused.  I guess this means that
<http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet> is frozen, but that there
is another ?live? tree that will be updated; is this ?live tree?
distinct from the TL 2010 testing?

I guess the "live tree" Karl was mentioning is our SVN repo, from which TL
2010-testing's tlnet as well as candidate DVD images will be derived.

Said otherwise, packages usually follow this way:

CTAN --(1)--> TL SVN --(2)--> tlnet

Arrow (2) is now blocked (and will soon be unblocked but with tlnet-testing as
its temporary new target). Arrow (1) will be blocked later, when TL 2010 is
nearly ready for its final release.

I hope it's clearer now.

It won't find any new update after today (or maybe in a few days depending on
propagation time to your local mirror). TL09 will never ever be updated again.
It is frozen for eternity from now on.

Yes it is.  I look forward to helping test TL 2010.

Not if you use the <http://mirror.ctan.org/?/tlnet> package repository,
but there will be (is?) a repository called
<http://mirror.ctan.org/?/tlnet-testing>? that will be updated.  Only
don?t expect things in tlnet-testing to be perfectly stable.

1: Or something like that; I guess it won?t be mirrored quite as heavily
as tlnet itself.

Don't expect this repository to be work with TL09 either :) This repository will
be useful only for installing a TL10 test version and update it. It can't be
used to update an existing TL09 installation.

Again, TL09 is over, it will never be updated again.

You're right. There will be a separate set of mirrors, see:

But no need to worry about that now: Karl will make announcements in due time.

tlmgr update --all probably will continue to work for a while (just
returning "no updates available" for normal people and even updating -
once - for Rip Van Winkles) as long as
http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2009 remains (which will be I
guess for a while), then

%/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr update --all

Cannot load TeX Live database from
http://ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/2008 at
/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr line 2553

and probably nobody will keep mirror after it will gone from CTAN.

But there are other functions like list, show, for tlmgr and for 2008
they still continue to work

This question can wait, but I was under the impression that the TL
2009 -> 2010 upgrade had been planned to be possible.

Evidently colortab was written by Timothy van Zandt, who, as far as I
know, is uncontactable.  So I see no hope for that.

According to Robin's catalogue entry, a possible answer is to use
colortbl or xcolor.

I asked Mats Dahlgren if he would be willing to relax his license.

note, i've never actually tried xcolor in this role, merely been told

i once did that, some time ago, i think.  mail from a less insignificant

I've been told \usepackage[table]{xcolor} is /the/ way to go for coloured
tabulars, and I've been using it myself, so I can at least confirm it is /a/

Maybe, but not with tlmgr, but you will have to run a separate
update program. After that tlmgr should restart working again.
Hopefully.

Subject: [tex-live] $TEXMFHOME not working right
Message-ID: <4BECC705.7000202@gmail.com>

I have a net install of TL ?09 on my Ubuntu machine, installed for the
whole machine (so I run tlmgr under sudo).  I?m trying to install some
packages in $TEXMFHOME, but they are not being found.  Running mktexlsr,
either as root or not, does not update that tree, so I tried doing it
explicitly:

chesky at derrial:~$ mktexlsr --verbose `kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFHOME'`
mktexlsr: Updating /home/chesky/texmf/ls-R...
mktexlsr: Done.

The ls-R file is created, but .sty files are still not found for
typesetting.

I looked for an option in tlmgr for $TEXMFHOME (I vaguely recall such an
option in the installer?) but could not find it.

Is there a configuration file to edit to fix this?

No need for that, or even counter-productive. TEXMFHOME is searched
for without ls-R files present.

It shoujld work.

Can you send the output of

What
$ kpsewhich YOURSTYLEFILE.sty
returns?

Please keep in mind that TeX Live is TDS compliant distro.

Suppose you have 'my-priv.sty' package. You should place it here:
$HOME/texmf/tex/latex/chesky/
                      ^^^^^^  
          (any sensible name is ok)

After that if you run
$ kpsewhich my-priv.sty
you should get
$HOME/texmf/tex/latex/chesky/my-priv.sty
($HOME will be expanded)

indeed.  however, if you access your home directory over nfs (as *all*
my users at work do) it has the potential to seriously slow things
down.  scanning directories over nfs this way is regularly the source of
support calls about "tex suddenly slow" (after loading something like pgf).

another possibility is non-tds layout in texmfhome.  i've had some of
those too.

The relevant lines are:

I?ve attached the full output in case I missed something pertinent.

(BTW, it complained of ?missing finding of XDvi, config!?.)

I?m trying to play with the development versions of fontspec &c., so I
installed fontspec.sty [2010/05/14 v2.0 ?] (and the .cfg & .lua) in
/home/chesky/texmf/tex/latex/fontspec.  I even get this result:

chesky at derrial:~$ kpsewhich -all fontspec.sty

chesky at derrial:~$ kpsewhich fontspec.sty
/home/chesky/texmf/tex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.sty

But when I try to typeset the documentation for the development version
of xltxtra, I get:

chesky at derrial:~/Downloads/wspr/xltxtra$ xelatex xltxtra.dtx

               `2008/08/09 v1.18 Advanced font selection for XeLaTeX'
               is available.
?

Why is the system not preferring my locally-installed version?

because it's looking at the tex/xelatex tree, and you've put it on
tex/latex

Because when running xelatex, the xelatex paths are searched first
(here I have duplicated your HOMETEXMF layout):

$ kpsewhich -all fontspec.sty
/Users/gwhite/Library/texmf/tex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.sty
$ kpsewhich fontspec.sty
/Users/gwhite/Library/texmf/tex/latex/fontspec/fontspec.sty

but, if you tell kpsewhich to search for xelatex thingies:

$ kpsewhich -progname=xelatex fontspec.sty
/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.sty

When adding updated versions of files that exist under texmf-dist, the
general rule is to copy the same directory structure, so you should
be using "/home/chesky/texmf/tex/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.sty".

By the way, it is in principle correct to install the newest version of fontspec
in tex/latex, since it works with both xelatex and lualatex. In my personal
setup, that's what I'm doing, and I made a symlink in tex/xelatex:

mpg at roth:~/texmf/tex/xelatex% ls -l fontspec
lrwxrwxrwx 1 mpg mpg 17 avril 10 14:30 fontspec -> ../latex/fontspec

to work around this problem.

Howdy,

Sorry to bother the list but there is some discussion going on on the Mac OS X TeX list about whether any binaries in TeX Live 2009 were updated via tlmgr. Some folks have noted that there have been some *.universal-darwin updates over the time period but it isn't clear to me that this means that binaries were actually updated.

I know that it is possible to update binaries via tlmgr but I'm wondering if it has ever happened and folks on this list would know and stop the speculating.

Good Luck,

My understanding that this happened between prerelease and an official
release TL2009 but not after release.

I am quite (say 94.6%) sure that the updates were only due to other
files changed in the package, not hte actual binary.

But why do you ask? Any *ANYONE* on the list can go to the svn web interface,
checkout the binaries and the last change date???

I will not do that, because I don't care.

You mean for update and install, right?

Ideally there are only very few files in TEXMFHOME because TeX Live is
very complete.  However, the situation might be different if users
want to use beta versions of huge packages.  And installing user
specific files locally is quite unfortunate if HOME is on a server.

What you can do is to add TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS.  This has no effect
and files are still searched in the file system, at least until a user
runs texhash.  Then he has to keep the ls-R file up-to-date or remove
it.

One can't assume that even without TEXMFHOME in TEXMFDBS there will
never be an ls-R file in TEXMFHOME.  There will always be one after
running getnonfreefonts.  This is not actually desired and I wasn't
even aware of until now.  The reason is that texhash ignores TEXMFDBS
if it's called with an argument.  I didn't even know that this works
at all:

  $ texhash /usr/local/share/emacs
  texhash: Updating /usr/local/share/emacs/ls-R... 
  texhash: Done.

getnonfreefonts[-sys] calls texhash with an argument in order to avoid
creating texmf-dist/ls-R each time because this consumes a lot of time
and getnonfreefonts[-sys] already knows where it installed the fonts.

The behaviour of texhash is a bit unfortunate.  It would be better to
obey TEXMFDBS always and add a --force option which allows for
creating ls-R files in arbitrary directories.

Anyway, TeX Live versions prior to TeX Live 2007 had:

  TEXMFDBS = $TEXMF

Every user had to run texhash after adding files and nobody
complained.  The setting of TEXMFDBS were changed due to a bug in
fmtutil.  BTW, this bug was reported by Donald Knuth himself.  We were
clueless but after I encountered the same problem, I proposed to
remove TEXMF[SYS]VAR from TEXMFDBS as a simple workaround.  The
problem was that fmtutil appended newly created format files to ls-R
files without scanning the whole directory tree.  This worked fine in
the past but with teTeX-3 it wasn't as reliable as before.

When I discussed the TEXMF[SYS]VAR issue with Karl, we also discussed
how to treat TEXMFHOME.  We couldn't set "TEXMFDBS = $TEXMF" anymore
because we had to treat TEXMF[SYS]VAR as an exception anyway.

Regarding TEXMFHOME, we assumed that there will be only a few files
and it's not worthwhile to create an ls-R file in this directory.
We thought that removing TEXMFHOME from TEXMFDBS makes life easier.

However, nowadays I think that this was not a good decision.  It seems
that creating a TDS compliant directory structure somtimes causes
problems but most users are aware of texhash already.

Therefore I wouldn't object if the old behaviour is restored.

Regards,
  Reinhard

If you mean
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/

there is no history as it just has been created for TL2010.

As Herbert noticed there was a discussion in  mactex list if tlmgr was
ever used to update binaries and I can recall it happened in TL2009
before prerelease and release. My proof is a bit indirect as I
installed TL prerelease in September while asy 1.88 has been
stabilized only in October.

Actually my question about logging the size was related of this
discussion (to distinguish between real and "fake" updates).

Also acrobat icons for .pdf files are lost. I hope it is an easy fix.

I certainly didn't complain, but it was a very frustrating experience
first time I started adding stuff to TEXMFHOME and tex still can not
find it, I'm very glad this have been "fixed".

??? The first commit in this repo was back in 2005... All history is here, the
current state of the distro is in trunk/Master.

If your question is whether it's technically possible or not to update the
binaries using tlmgr, the answer is yes.

To the best of my knowledge, the only binaries updates that happened this year
were bugfixes in windows binaries (the bug was specific to windows).

Since tlmgr doesn't use a rsync-like algorithm, but just plain old tar (and xz),
the siez would probably not be a good indication.

As Norbert said, the svn log is the definitive answer to this question.

Yes - right - after release. I am talking between prerelease and
release (not normal).

Right. That was not your question, but someone asked about that.

Of course binaries do change during prerelease. For example, the first
prerelease builds are being done, but almost no binaries are already updated to
their 2010 version.

Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm missing your point.

Just nitpicking: that tlmgr was used to update binaries in the prerelease period

Sure, this can happen.  But if you didn't know that you have to run
texhash, how did you know where exactly you have to put your files?
You certainly have to read documentation if you want to install files
in TEXMFHOME.  There is much more you can do wrong.

I don't think that a problem have been "fixed", as you said.  Please
note that the current behavior causes other problems, as Robin
reported.  If people have many files in TEXMFHOME the system slows
down significantly, especially because TEXMFHOME is the first tree to
be searched.  Please don't forget that even if a file resides in
another tree, TEXMFHOME is searched though on the disc.

With other words: Even if your TeX input file doesn't need anything
from TEXMFHOME, the file system is scanned each time.  This is quite
inefficient and IMO the idea of kpathsea is completely ignored.

Another issue is that if TEXMFHOME is treated as an exception, why not
treat TEXMFLOCAL as an exception too?  Then the system becomes even
less efficient.  But why should they be treated differently? 

My opinion is that kpathsea is a good thing and should be used by
default.  I dislike exceptions generally.  The problem is that every
exception needs extra explanations and and blows up documentation.
It's better to avoid exceptions.  The less we have have to explain,
the less people have to read.  You can't install files without reading
the documentation anyway.  It's a wrong conclusion that circumventing
kpathsea makes things easier.  You still have to be familiar with TDS,
otherwise your files are not found reliably.

What we have now solves a tiny problem for people who didn't read the
documentation.  They have to be in luck if their files are found at
all (if they didn't read any documentation), and the system is slow by
default.  Is this really what we want?

Well, the short answer is: kpathsea is there, it's a good thing, and
should be used by default.  No exceptions please, if avoidable.  Users
should simply read documentation if the trial-and-error method fails.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Questions:
- which installer did you use (wizard style, full GUI with all questons,
  text mode)?
- if you used full GUI with all questions: how did you set the

  It should be by default set to "Only new"

http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/bin/universal-darwin/

you can check the last change date.

BUt you also have to check if it is a binary file or not.

That does not make a difference. If tlmgr replaces one binary with 
the very same binary (no changes in the bits of the program), it 
still will download the whole package and the size will be shown.

It is not there on the wizard. It should not have reset the options, 
because the default is different.

BUT: Did you use the DVD or an up-to-date installer from the network?

The DVD installer had some problems in this respect (AFAIR).

Hello Manuel,

> (I didn't check further.)

According to that:
Today I recognized that the package "ltablex" is in TeX-Live, but
AFAIR in 2007 a read that this package is _not_ free and since
this time I use longtable,tabularx in conjunction with filecontenst and
ltxtable to have longtables with \textwidth, independent to the content.
How can it be that a non free package is included in TeX-Live?
Or is this a misstake of me? Changed the licence type of ltable?

Yes I used the DVD which I downloaded few months back but I calculated the
checksum before I
did any installation and found it matching the one given in texlive website.

Do you know if this problem was due to a change in windows registry by the
DVD installer?

Yes, that installer does have a problem AFAIR. Tomek can you confirm?

I think that you are running it anyway as normal user and not as
admin. You have to, also on WinXP, start a program as admin AFAIR.

I believe the problem is that now the changes are made in your User part
of the Registry, but I a not a Windows expert.

Because you heard about it from a colleague or an incomplete documentation?

As a matter of personal experience, a few years ago, when I first tried to
install something in my TEXMFHOME, I did two mistakes:
- not running mktexlsr (it was TL05)
- not putting tex input files in a "tex" subdirectory
and I remember it took me a long time to understand.

Now, there's one less standard mistake to make. That's a Good Thing IMO.

Well, it's slow only on nfs mounts with big texmfhome trees (which is not
exactly the most common case).

i only did the licence check 2008-12-13, by which time it was presumably
already in tex live.  i wonder if it crept into the first ever tl, and
no-one has since got around to reviewing it in light of its (non-)licence.

no doubt karl will explain all, some time.  (afaik, the start of tl in
the mid-90s was a uk-only operation, but there were several other
nationalities involved by the time of the release.  that was the
advantage of having sebastian involved: back then, he knew _everyone_.)

Hello,

I'm using MacTeX 2009. After today's self-update, I get the following message:

tlmgr: package repository http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/mirror/ctan//systems/texlive/tlnet
The supported release as specified by the repository (2009)

The wrong release number seems to have slipped through somehow.

Indeed, update-tlmgr-XXX.{sh,exe} is still updated for some reason (and it's
used by TLU by default. We'll look into that. Thanks for noticing and reporting.

I manually reinstalled an older version of those files (happilly my local copy
was lagging a few days behind), and fixed the problem in our nightly cron.

I hope everything will be ok now.

I changed line 55 in TLConfig.pm from "$ReleaseYear = 2010;" to "$ReleaseYear = 2009;", which seems to fix the problem.

Waiting for the older version to propagate back to your mirror and re-updating
with update-tlmgr-lastest should fix the problem too.

    no-one has since got around to reviewing it in light of its (non-)licence.

Right.

As I've written before, I have not attempted to systematically eliminate
all packages with license "unknown".  That seemed too drastic to me,
although some distros are doing it.  What should be done, in my view, is
to try to contact the authors instead of just deleting them wholesale
since it is certain that most/all authors would be fine with a free
license if asked, and just didn't even think about it back then.  It is
the price we pay for working with a system that predates the current
strict license interpretations by many years.

Anyway, I removed ltablex.  I'll try writing the addresses in the file,
but have little hope that they will work.

Well, you still can do the same mistake if you install in TEXMFLOCAL.
And this is what most people do on their own machines.

Sure, the size matters.  But the NFS issue Robin mentioned is by far
not the worst case.  NFS is a bit slower than a local file system
because each time you access a file it has to check whether the copy
in the cache of the client is up-to-date.  

Suppose that you have TEXMFHOME on a USB stick.  On Linux I usually
mount the stick manually.  Then all files are in the cache and I
actually don't notice that they are on a USB stick.  If people are
using an automounter, I suppose that the cache is cleared if the
timeout is reached.  Under Windows, files on a USB stick are not
cached at all.  It's horribly slow.

Nevertheless, having TEXMFHOME on a USB stick makes sense.

As I said, I noticed yesterday that texhash creates an ls-R file when
it's called with an argument, regardless of the value of TEXMFDBS.
People who used getnonfreefonts in the past *have* an ls-R file in
TEXMFHOME already.  BTW, I don't know how to solve this problem in
getnonfreefonts reasonably.  And I don't know whether it's reasonable
at all not to use an ls-R file in this case.

If you run getnonfreefonts --all, you'll have about 100 directories in
TEXMFHOME which will be scanned each time.  And in the near future
I'll add support for two new font packages which means that there will
be even much more directories soon.

Manuel, you said:

 > Now, there's one less standard mistake to make. [...]

You have to add the word "probably".

The current situation is:

  * You have to run texhash if you install in TEXMFLOCAL.

  * You don't have to run texhash if you install in TEXMFHOME, at
    least unless there is an ls-R file already.

This is *very* confusing, IMO.

TeX Live is a huge system and if we want to keep it manageable, we
have to make things as consistent as possible.  I'm convinced that
consistency is *much* more important than exceptions which make life a
little bit easier for people who didn't read the documentation.

And once there is an ls-R file in TEXMFHOME already, it's used by
kpathsea, but texhash won't update it because it's not in TEXMFDBS.
In order to update an existing ls-R file in TEXMFHOME you have to say

  texhash `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME`

Just running texhash without an argument isn't sufficient.

***PLEASE*** try to explain this to users.

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that removing
TEXMFHOME from TEXMFDBS was a *** VERY BAD *** idea.  It causes more
problems than it solves.

It's better to add TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS in texmf.cnf again.
Everything will be easier then.  Definitely.

Regards,
  Reinhard

finding the truth of that in a lyx document is an exercise left to

Hi Reinhard,

I'm sorry, but I still disagree, and I don't feel like engaging in a lengthy
discussion about that now.

By default, texdoc doesn't look for files with tex or xml extension (btw, how is
a normal human being supposed to find a xml file helpful as a user-level
documentation?). This can be changed by setting ext_list in your personal
configration file (see texdoc's documentation) if you want to do so.

the problem isn't file reading, it's searching for files.  nfs is *far*
slower to scan a directory than is a local disc; hence i only get the
reports when someone has loaded a large package into their ~/texmf

(in our environment, where everything on $HOME is agressively backed up
in our array of netapp filers, such behaviour is pretty undesirable,
since i already have ctan in the same array.  telling the users that is
mare difficult than you would believe.  they're _supposed_ to be
computer scientists...)

ouch.

of course.  note that i merely explain why _i_ recommend it for the
environment here.
 
and then there's the fun to be had, regularly, with the texmfhome copy
of a now-obsolete version of a package.

In this particular case xml and comment to sty are human readable (and
even not unfriendly). Probably one needs just to remember that there
may be documentation hidden in non-standard formats and even if texdoc
does not find to use locate to find suspicious files

Did you read my previous mail at all???????

Yeah, let's add TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS again.  This solves many
problems.  Do you think that *I'm* interested in endless discussions?

What we have now is wrong.  Definitely.  Period.

Subject: [tex-live] iso file
Message-ID: <1274053362.6298269@192.168.2.228>

I am trying to install TexLive on a linux machine that is behind a firewall, so I cannot use the install script. Also, I am not root so I cannot use the package installer (or mount an iso). I downloaded the iso and in an attempt to bypass writing it to a DVD, I simply used the linux archive to extract the iso. I found out that when you do that, it breaks all the sym links and they become just empty files (a name, with zero file size). I tried it in Windows with 7-zip and it did the same thing.

I know that this was my fault, but it might be helpful on the iso page (http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html) to state that you must either mount it or burn it - you cannot extract the files directly. I did not know that they were sym links so it took me a long time to figure this out (I simply thought the files were missing!) Apparently no one else has tried this because I spent many hours with google trying to figure it out and found nothing. 

Thanks

Subject: [tex-live] big troubles installing TL '09 on Windows 7 with 2 admins
Message-ID: <D1F59BDF-5FC4-492E-8422-D773BF1BCD78@free.fr>

Dear all,

I've had persistent problems trying to install TL 2009 on a Windows 7 machine. Here is the story : there are two user accounts on the machine, both have admin privileges, so let's call them "admin1" and "admin2". The Win OS (& other stuffs) were first installed by "admin1", hence the name ? as it will appear, this detail matters. I've tried quite numerous (& unsuccessful) installations, notably :

1. logged as "admin1", I first did what looked the most normal & simple : running install-tl with admin rights, setting "install to all users".
2. after complete uninstalling, logged as "admin2", same procedure.
3. after complete uninstalling, logged as "admin1", a "standard user" install (= -non-admin), and then another "standard user" install being logged as "admin2".
4. various other attempts, doing the same thing, doing various other things, then trying to install from the .iso image instead of CTAN, etc.

Every time, the situation ended up the same : the PATH was set ok, but I couldn't launch any of the binaries. At least for "admin2" (which is my "normal" account) ? I didn't try very extensively for "admin1", sometimes it seemed to be ok, sometimes not, but I'm not really sure anymore. Below is what I had (being "admin2") with my very minimal tests :


C:\Users\benjamin>tex --version
Tex 3.1415926 (Web2C 2009)
*BLA BLA BLA? [the usual normal stuff]*

C:\Users\benjamin>pdftex
(null): fatal: Can't get long name for C:\texlive.
.

C:\Users\benjamin>tlmgr
(null): fatal: Can't get long name for C:\texlive.
.
Can't locate TeXLive/TLConfig.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /texmf/scripts/texlive/tlpkg C:\texlive\2009\tlpkg\tlperl\lib C:/texlive/2009/tlpkg/tlperl/lib .) at C:\texlive\2009\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl line 78.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at C:\texlive\2009\texmf\scripts\texlive\tlmgr.pl line 78.


... So I turned crazy, I lost hours, even days trying to get things to work, I promised never to touch a windows machine anymore in my whole life etc. (I'm usually a ? very happy ? Mac user...)
Finally I did a last try "avec l'?nergie du d?sespoir" (as we say in french), uninstalled everything on the PC, reinstalled windows 7 and everything from scratch, and I did a normal admin install for all users, being logged as "admin2". But once again, it wasn't working for me, I couldn't even launch TexWorks, nor anything. At that moment, I logged myself as "admin1", and I was surprised to see that it was indeed working : I even had the pleasure of seeing that good old "sample2e.dvi" on my computer's screen ! Puzzled, I created a new "standard user" account : it was also working ! This is quite humiliating... : every account but mine ("admin2") has right to do some TeXing... 

My guess is that the install script isn't able to deal with the fact that there are two admins on the machine, or am I missing something ?

Can someone report a successful install in a similar situation (= Windows (7) with two admin accounts) ? Is it actually supposed to work ? 

What should I do ? I don't even think that decreasing the second admin's privileges to "standard user" just for the time of the install would do the trick (I tried once, maybe I'm gonna try once again, but well...), I have the impression that the second account must be created as "standard" and kept that way until the installation of TexLive, and I'm not sure that one can then raise the privileges to admin without ruining everything...

any help would be *very* appreciated !...
(& thanks anyway for reading this long story...)

benjamin

A discussion of much the same issue is
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/unetbootin/+bug/373089>

Your situation is not that unusual, and likely to become more common if
the current trend towards "security trumps all other concerns" continues.
My understanding is that there are a number of extensions to the basic
CDROM format that support links, long file names, etc.   Years ago I
SGI IRIX had the same sort of problem with data CD's until SGI
improved the support for extensions.   At the time there were ways
to get tables mapping the short filenames (which were often hashes)
to the "real" names, but I'm not sure if those were generated  by the
people who wrote the disk or could be recreated from information on
the CD's.  I don't have the tl .iso handy -- what do you get for the
symlinks from:  "isoinfo -lR -i <filename>.iso" (I assume the .iso
uses Rockridge extensions)?

You should be able to generate a table of the symbolic links in a
form that could be used (e.g., with a shell script) to repair a filesystem
created as you did by extracting a .iso, but maybe someone
else will suggest a tool that does the extraction properly without
additional steps.

It would re-introduce other problems. You probably think the problems it would
solve are greater than the problems it would introduce, apparently we don't
weight problems the same way.

Not at all, I never said that. Your points are interesting and would deserve a

I see no urging reason to change (or even discuss about changing) a setting that
has been there for 3 years without creating numerous complains, right now.

In this particular case, I agree. But in general I still think texdoc is right
not to look for xml files.

For tex files, it's harder to tell, since some authors provide documentation
only as an example tex file, which may be very readable, but otoh most of the
time, tex files are only the source for a compiled documentation. I'll add this
problem to my incubation list.

Right. texdoc's primary goal is to be right most of the time. Handling special
cases correctly while still keeping the system maintainable is no easy problem.

there's presumably something wrong with it, that it's not in tl, but
nobody's told us why.

No, rotfloat just hadn't made it to our update checking system. We (actually,
Karl alone currently) have to make sure each package works well with the system
before adding them to the list f checked packages, so it takes time.

It is in TL: package "a4wide", collection "latexextra". You should ask on a
Fedora specific channel.

exactly what is the firewall blocking?

Have you tried specifically choosing a mirror that provides TL over http?

Then you should not have any problem with firewalls and can use the 
install script.

port 80, www, is blocked??? Are you sure?

That is normal, yes.

What do you mean with "the linux archive" to extract it? There are many 
programs, you seem to have used a bad one.

Then you used a bad program. I just now extracted the  bin/i386-linux dir
which contains loads of symlinks with *isomaster* and it worked
without any problem, as normal user without mounting the image or so.

> I tried it in Windows with 7-zip and it did the same thing.

Of course, Windows, does not support symlinks.

Of course you can!!!!! Please do not spread that kind of wrong information,
thanks. Use the right tools.

Hi,

In short, I have no idea what's going wrong.  The only difference
between admin and non-admin install is which registry hive is used
(HKLM and HKCU, respectively) but this should have no bearing on
running binaries like pdftex.  All binaries are stored in one dir and
as long as this dir is accessible to all users, everything should just
work (TM).

The error message "Can't get long name for C:\texlive" looks odd.  I
suspect that some file permission magic might be at work.  Try to
install TL in another directory (preferably on another drive) and see
if that helps.

Cheers,

Tomek

If a particular program doesn't work as promised, please file a bug
report there.  It's not a TeX Live issue.

a4wide.sty is deprecated anyway.  If you are forced to produce crap,
wordlike.sty is what you need.

Run 

  texdoc wordlike

on the command line.  You don't need a4wide.sty anymore in order to
produce crap.

As the OP on this thread, may I weigh in with my $0.02?

I?d like a choice.  If I often add or change things in TEXMFHOME, having
to recreate ls-R every time becomes a pain.  If my home directory is
across the network, having ls-R becomes a tremendous time-saver.  So?
just tell me that.

On my home system, I?ll very gladly do without ls-R in TEXMFHOME.  On my
portable flash drive installation, and when I administer a network, I
now know to add TEXMFHOME to TEXMFDBS.  As for what the default should
be, perhaps ?all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient
end?.

TL can't be expected to solve every such problem, but it is
certainly useful to a small group of potential users to indicate
ways to install TL without root/admin privs and without
internet.

Many "locked-down" configurations use older releases of linux
with old versions of utilities -- the user is faced with either building
current versions of utilties (if not all of TL) from sources, assuming
configure doesn't reject the available platform, or finding ways to
work within the existing tools.   TL has always gone to extremes
to support "legacy" platforms and part of this includes working
with the tools that are found on such platforms.

That is something that makes me nervous. Unwinding and reinstalling
should not *remove* oberdiek. Something really bad happened there.

For now I would remove all the files in .../2009/temp and then
	tlmgr install oberdiek

You do have a choice (as for almost everything in TL, may I add). Just run
"mktexlsr ~/texmf" (assuming a standard location of TEXMFHOME) everytime you
change files in TEXMFHOME if you want a ls-R file here. Just don't do that (and
delete any ls-R mistakenly created) if don't want.

(Alternatively, if you want to have a ls-R here, set TEXMFDBS to include
TEXMFHOME in your local texmf.cnf, then running mktexlsr without argument will
include TEXMFHOME too.)

I read the section:

This is the right section. First when you install TL, you have to go
to selection of platforms and select all that you plan to use. For
unix-like systems you have to mount the texmf-* trees and set PATH
(and MANPATH if you need "man") to the correct directory. For
windows-like systems you need to map a network drive and then use the
script available from that very section to create shortcuts.

Well, sorry, actually I'm not an expert in network area: I just try to
help our computer technician to install TeX Live, not on all Windows
desktop, but just on the server, in order to make easier the
maintenance. So maybe my questions will seem very basic :)

1. The TL install will be done only on the (Linux) server, right?

2. Even Windows binary system may be installed on it?

Thanks!

Yes, it should not be a problem.

We have Linuix, 32 + 64 bit, windows and Mac on our Linux server.

The Macs get is over read-only NFS, and Windows can get it over Samba if 
needed. (which we do not).

As a matter of fact, TL does not need any special installation steps,
the files are just copied. After installation texmf-dist/bin will
contain subdirectories for all selected platforms. Unix-like systems
require just PATH to be set. Linux comes often with teTeX installed
and if you decide not to install teTeX when installing Linux, you
still get some part of it due to dependencies and it usually does not
work. I found a lot of various conflict between such traces of teTeX
and TL. The remedy is to put the correct TL bi directory to the
beginning of PATH. Windows users are accustomed to shortcuts and
menus, it would be too tedious to do it by hand, the script will help.
Some tools are written in perl but it is not available in Windows.
When installing TL on Linux you have to select Perl for Windows.
Anyway, if you forget anything, you can install it later by tlmgt.

If oyu select on linux to also install win32 binaries tlperl should

Setting the PATH is often a source of confusion.  It is important to
know that CTAN TeX Live (as opposed to a version that has been
packaged by some distribution) resides entirely inside the top-level
directory unless you explicitly request that it create links in the
standard (/usr/bin) directory.   Depending on how you use TeX,
different ways of adding the TL bin directory
(e.g., /usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/<arch>) to the PATH are not
all equivalent.   If you add it manually in a shell, e.g.,
PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/<arch>:$PATH" then the
new setting is only available in that shell, in particular,
if you start emacs from a system menu, it will use the
original PATH setting.   With a little care, it is easy to
have several different TeX systems (e.g. TL from previous
years along with the TeX system from the linux distro).

The other issue is preventing the dependencies in the
linux distro from pulling in the distro's TeX packages.
If you don't want this, you may be able to install a dummy
package, e.g.:

<http://texblog.net/latex-archive/linux/kile-texlive-2008-equivs/>

The OP is on a Mac.  These problems happen in our lab when user
runs updates at the console using the MacTeX GUI tools and then
tries to install a package using tlgmr at the command line without
"sudo" or resetting permissions using "chown -R" (I recommend
the latter -- root should not be used to do anything more complicated
than adjusting permissions).

"really bad" things can happen when the disk is full, the filesystem
is corrupt or has "bad" permissions, or some hardware is broken -- if this
were my machine and the permissions were OK I'd check for a full disk,
look at  the logs and smartctl output, and consider running disk and
hardware tests.

This just confirms that there are some things (other than papersize!) were any
choice of a "default" configuration will create problems for some users (or the
local "guru" who gets the complaints about TeX being slow for users with NFS
home directories or printers rejecting jobs for requesting a paper size not
found in any tray).

TL is  a large, complex system with very diverse users, so users need to
understand that some effort is often needed to tweak their configuration.
A few of the choices (paper size, symbolic links in /usr/bin) are so important
that they get special mention in the installation tool.   It might be
helpful to
have a short document on "commonly applied tweaks" (CAT) that can be done
without removing and installing the whole system (as if it was a
Windows package):

1.  conflicts with default output settings

    -- papersize settings other than the system default for one
document or project or user

    -- switching between CM and LM fonts

2.  performance tweaks:

    -- settings for NFS mounted home directories or large TEXMFHOME trees

3.  coexisting with package managers in linux

   -- dummy packages

4.  reversing install-time choices

  -- removing symbolic links: how to ensure that 3rd party tools can
     still find the programs

  -- changing ownership

This happened on package 13 when 56 needed updating, this was the only
package that failed. The remain installed without issue.

The filesystem is good, I just ran a complete filesystem check over
the weekend, and its not full:

$ df -h /usr/local
Filesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/disk0s2   70Gi   53Gi   17Gi    76%    /

Whenever tlmgr tried to pull updates from

the same problem, with a different mirror oberdiek installed without

Dear all,

I currently have a problem when running dvipdfmx from texlive-2009 on a
solaris 9 machine. I tracked it down to
the call of fscanf(file, "%%PDF-1.%hhu", &minor) in the function
check_for_pdf_version. Though this works on solaris10, it does not work
on solaris9 since the "%hhu" format specifier is not defined there. May
I suggest changing the format specifier to "%c"?

Best regards,

Ulrich

the mirror timestamp is admirably up-to-date.

i just looked at the .tar.xz: they seemed all right.

rechecking, i would guess they're exactly the same as i have, modulo
the dates being expressed in utah time.  md5sum of their oberdiek.tar.xz
is the same as the file here.

so i don't think we can explain this problem by _that_ sort of
misbehaviour from utah: otoh, i can't think of any other sort of
misbehaviour that might provoke this effect.

Can you check the md5sum of oberdiek.doc.tar.xz, the OP mentioned that
it started with a trunceated archive with the .doc.tar.xz

Thanks a lot!!!

(sorry, i had it my mind as i started wandering along with this that it
was the "base" .tar.xz)

same again.  of course, the .doc.tar.gz is pretty grossly bloated (19.7
mbytes) so if there's anything slightly dodgy about the net connection,
it's got plenty of time to manifest it during download.

Hmm, then I don't know what else to do. Yes, oberdiek .pdfs are big ;-)

Was oberdiek the largest of the packages being updated?

Did you check the permissions in the texlive tree or do "repair permissions"?
Maybe "ls -lR | grep ..." to see only lines with unexpected ownership.

Do you have antivirus running?

Can you manually download the package and test it with "xz -t"?

It works for me (in Canada) on a 10.5.8 Apple imac (but our network is working
today -- at times this download would take a day):

$ tlmgr --repository

All the files seem to have appropriate permissions, at least nothing
look s off - they are all owned by root:wheel

Larger files offer more opportunities for network problems, AV, and traffic
shaping to do their nasty work, but the backup and recovery mechanism
is intended to protect us from network problems.   Running as root:wheel
likely uses a trimmed down path and older versions of the standard tools
(tar, sed, etc.) so could be encountering a bug that doesn't appear when
used from a user command line.

Subject: [tex-live] texdoc feature idea: LaTeX package macros
Message-ID: <4BF34EDD.2030906@pakin.org>

I got an idea recently after someone asked on comp.text.tex for
documentation for LaTeX package macros: What if the texdoc database
were set up to map macro names to package documentation?  My
two-second proof of concept was to extract all \DescribeMacro
definitions from the TL2009 source tree and map the macro being
described to the corresponding package name (well, source file without
the extension -- this is a proof of concept, after all):

    $ egrep -r '\\DescribeMacro' /usr/local/stow/texlive-2009/texmf-dist/source/ | perl -ne '/([^:\/]+)\.dtx:\% \\DescribeMacro[{]?\\(\w+)/ && print "[\"\\\\$2\"] = {[\"$1\"]=true,},\n"' | sort -u > macro-map.lua

I then stuck the resulting macro-map.lua file into my cache-tlpdb.lua
file after the other name-to-package mappings.  This let me enter, for
example,

    $ texdoc '\dashgapcolor'

to bring up the arydshln package's documentation.  (Note that 80% of
the maps in macro-map.lua don't actually work; this is a *very* crude
test.)

This could be a handy feature to have, especially for new users who
receive a LaTeX document from a colleague and are baffled by all the
macros used in it.

What do you think?

Message-ID: <4BF4051B.3000906@mac.com>

Article I need to cite -

http://www.cnah.org/pdf_files/511.pdf

Due to an error in the article not caught by the authors or peer review 
before publish, there is a rather important corrigendum to the article.

http://www.cnah.org/pdf_files/599.pdf

How do I note the corrigendum to the article in the bibTeX file so that 
people looking at the reference know it exists? Is there a "proper" way 
to do it? I've not come across this before, but I'm guessing it isn't 
all that uncommon of an issue.

Some examples online when googled simply have them listed as a separate 
article, is that really correct?

Hello,

 

I'm trying to compile the texlive sources for hp-ux, but when i use Build Script, I have the following message:

 

checking for dlfcn.h... yes
configure: error: source directory already configured; run "make distclean" there first

Either after did make distclean, the same error.

 

And also try with ./configure command, I have been seen the message:

But I have the gmake command.

    What if the texdoc database
    were set up to map macro names to package documentation?  

We should probably discuss this on the texdoc list.

My initial reaction is that being able to look up by macro name would be
great, but perhaps it should be a different tool instead of integrated
into texdoc, especially for the sake of collisions.  I dunno.  Up to Manuel.

Subject: [tex-live] tlmgr ftp issues?
Message-ID: <7F271E89-B949-4213-B42B-CE02F278D5A8@tfeb.org>

Hi, apologies if this is a known problem or my diagnosis is wrong - I  
haven't been using TeX Live very long.

I have the 2009 distribution, and I wanted to see if I could use tlmgr  
to install updates.  I'm on a mac, which has both the mac application  
firewall turned on, and is also behind a router with firewall and  
NAT.  So "traditional" ftp does not work, it needs to use passive ftp.

I did an update of tlmgr itself ("sudo tlmgr update --self") which  
worked fine.

Now if I try, say "sudo tlmgr update --list" two things happen:

- I get an alert from the mac firewall saying do I want to let perl  
accept incoming network connections, to which I answer "no" (saying  
"yes" isn't going to help since there is another firewall in the way,  
but in any case I definitely do not want to let perl accept incoming  
connections);

- tlmgr sits there for a very long time (long enough for me to type  
this) before producing the list.

If I have a poke around with lsof / netstat I can see that it has a  
listening socket open on a high port number, as well as an outgoing  
socket to ftp.tex.ac.uk.

So, my guess (I have looked at the source, but only a bit), is that  
it's trying to do traditional ftp and failing, then falling back to  
something else (wget or curl?).  There has been a thread in in  
comp.text.tex where someone suggested using the -no-persistent- 
downloads option, which does indeed resolve the problem.

If that's a correct diagnosis, then I think tlmgr should be changed so  
it uses passive ftp by default (or at least has a configuration option  
to do so), since I suspect that traditional ftp (active ftp?) will  
work only in a vanishingly small number of cases nowadays.

Thanks

I didn't think a lot, but it seems to me that it's better to have it integrated
in texdoc, since essentially there would be a mapping macro -> package name,
then the existing part of texdoc would do the mapping package name -> actual
files. But I'm also afraid of collisions, so I was thinking of an option like
texdoc --macro '\foobar' (with a better option name).

Anyway, I'm sorry but I didn't plan to do major changes in texdoc in the next
few months (due to real-life occupation), but I'd be glad to discuss the idea
now, if you don't mind waiting a bit for the implementation :)

couldn't you just use a mirror that make use of HTTP instead of FTP

(why do firewalls keep people in, shouldn't it keep people out?)

non-passive ftp does involve separate back connections, which is why
it's so often targeted by firewalls.

(of course, the ensemble does keep my traffic down, so perhaps i
shouldn't complain...)

tim, can't you specify a specific server rather than letting mirror.ctan
choose it for you?  if you want to use tex.ac.uk, specify
http://www.tex.ac.uk; otherwise there are any number of other places you
could use.

Yes, your analysis seems right. By default tlmgr now tries to set
up a persisten connection using LWP, which in turn (AFAIR) uses
Net::FTP, so could you please try setting 
	FTP_PASSIVE=1
in the environment (and expoerting it) and retrying. If that works
we could make that an option to tlmgr, or just document that you
should set the env var if your firewall disables active ftp.

In addition, with the latest tlmgr you can disable this permanent
connection setup permanently by editing
	TEXMFCONFIG/tlmgr/config
and putting
	persisten-downloads = 0
into it.
(Needs to be documented anyway).

I disagree, it is a bit strange that the firewall disables all high ports
incoming, but well, policies differ.

If the FTP_PASSIVE=1 mode works, that should be an easy work around.

I seem to remember Karl told me that mirror.ctan.org had been modified to return
only http mirrors (precisely to avoid firewall issues). No I'm completely confused.

a firewall that allows anything unchecked is an open invitation to
hackers.  we're a significant institution for network research, and our
gateway operates a policy of "anything not explicitly permitted is
forbidden".

(note that ftp.tex.ac.uk is in the dmz, and so does allow active ftp.)

> If the FTP_PASSIVE=1 mode works, that should be an easy work around.

i agree.  but i do in fact agree with tim's suggestion.  and even more
so that mirror.ctan should *never* specify ftp when there's an http
connection available.

Why not just make it the default? What would be the problem with making passive
ftp the default?

My experience converges with Tim's: I'm not sure I ever encountered a
system/network allowing traditional ftp (on the client side). It seems to me
that passive FTP is kinda the standard now (or at least the more likely to work).

Manuel.

PS: according to wikipedia: "By default, most web browsers use passive (PASV)
mode, which more easily traverses end-user firewalls." Sure, tlmgr is not a web
browser, but it is in the same situation wrt end-user firewalls (and/or NAT boxes).

no, it hasn't.  i'm told that the database lists both addresses (and
hence protocols) for cambridge, but a recent test (just after reading
your message) gave me ftp.tex.ac.uk rather than www.tex.ac.uk

Yes, there will be collisions, e.g. \scalebox exists in two different
packages with slightly different syntax, \path exists in \url.sty and
\path.sty and is redefined in hyperref etc. It will have to be solved
somehow.

Yes, I can obviously make it work - just using -no-persistent- 
connections works (but probably means it will be slower and more  
expensive) or I can specify another server or protocol.

So I'm not at all worried about getting it to work for me, I just  
think it should be possible to fix tlmgr so it does not suffer from  
this kind of thing in the first instance.

Yes, this works fine: it's very quick then and it does not cause the  
OSX firewall to twitch.  I'd actually worked out in the meantime that  
it must be using Net::FTP and there are configuration options for that  
which control passive/non-passive ftp (see http://perldoc.perl.org/Net/FTP.html) 
.

Sorry, but that's just wrong. It is not strange at all that firewalls  
are configured so they do not allow in *anything* that is not  
explicitly required (not to mention you don't need a firewall to break  
traditional ftp - NAT is enough).

I was rather thinking about collisions with package names (as was Karl, I guess).

The kind of collision you mention could be handled simply be presenting the list
of matching packages to the user (just as texdoc -l does for packages with many
documentation files), I think.

Manuel.

PS: I think that the idea of moving the discussion to the texdoc list was to
avoid another long thread on texlive@, so it may be a good idea to reply only to
texdoc@ (with people cc'ed).

Aehmm yes, I know, one old project of mine ... send anything to me.
Now that I am living in Japan my time to work on Tibetan is a bit

We don't want tlmgr to ever use ftp.  Neither active nor passive ftp
can be relied on to work.  It's a waste of time for us to try to support
ftp at all.

I am sure this is a recent change somewhere, or we would have been
getting complaints since day 1 of using the multiplexer.  We will
rectify it somehow.

Thanks,

What's especially odd about this is that usually I get an error about a

there's a long pause. Once it uses wget, it seems to work fine, though.

Shouldn't this be fixed by now?  Multiple TLU users are reporting problems, and I can now reproduce this on my own system (Mac OS X).  Running update-tlmgr-latest.sh downloaded from either the unl.edu or dante.ctan.org mirror results in this message:

where are you "calling" from?

fwiw, randy's done work on the re-router, which did have a brief period
of "doing it right" for me, but on further adjustment ended up giving me
ftp.heanet.ie (or some such).  that was well before 0300 bst.

this morning (0730 bst, or so) it's back to giving me ftp.tex.ac.uk

It should be fixed, and would be if I wasn't stupid enough to switch the two
branches of an "if" in the update script. I fixed the script for real (fingers
crossed) so that there won't be any leakage from tlpretest to tlnet again.

I rebuild the updater to the version of 2010-05-12, uploaded and installed it in
tlnet. So, everything I stated 5 days ago should apply now :-)

Sorry for this, and thanks again for your report.

Manuel.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem Installin Emerald.sty
Message-ID: <ht58e5$jjk$1@dough.gmane.org>


I tried to manually install the emerald package.

I copied the fonts and fonts trees in texmf and texmf-dist and a I ran

updmap --enable emerlad.map
updmap-sys --enable emerlad.map

If I compile my latex file as superuser everything works but when I try to run
as normal user I get:

pdflatex file.tex

kpathsea:Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 0+480/600 --dpi 480 faumw8r
mktexpk:don't know how to create bitmap font for faumw8r.
kpathsea:Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.

Only as superuser I can get through the compilation.
All the user have read permission on the font files.

I use tex-live2009 on slackware13.

Any idea???

Thanks

you shouldn't run updmap and updmap-sys

I usually only run updmap-sys

Try renaming ~/.texlive2009

Almost everything went very smoothly!

The last remaining trouble is that I do use Evince as a .dvi, .ps
and .pdf viewer either on Linux and Windows boxes. And, trying to view
the .dvi file fails as Evince is looking for the texmf.cnf file in his
subdirectories. But I will investigate this a bit more...

Just for my personal information: when a .tex file on a Window box is
compiled with the Windows binary system (that is on the Linux server,
but shared with the Windows boxes), where does this compilation arise?

Thanks again.

Presumably on the harddisk on the Windows PC.

Basically it happens in the dir where you compile the file, the stuff on 
Samba is just read by Windows as if is was on a seperate harddrive

It's a problem also on Linux when you get Evince from your Linux distro and TeX
Live not from the distro, IIRC. If you manage to solve it, I'm curious to know
the solution.

On Linux it might be sufficient to (sym)link TL's texmf.cnf to the
directory where Evince expects it.

Please try

 updmap --enable-Map=emerlad.map

or

 updmap-sys --enable-Map=emerlad.map 

respectively.

I assume that you didn't install TeX Live as root.  Right?  (There is
nothing wrong installing TL as a non-privileged user.

It doesn't look like a file permission issue.  There seems to be
something wrong with pdftex.map.

I tried that a year or so ago, but couldn't make it work after a few
minutes.  My TL has several added texmf trees, so is not the
vanilla configuration.

I suspect similar kpathsea versions are needed.  Recent kpathsea has an
include mechanism that wasn't supported  when I last tried to use evince
with TL.   Maybe  it would be possible to write a custom texmf.cnf using
the values in TL's version, or maybe current evince uses a more
current library.

It should work though.  A user should always be able to install his
own fonts locally.  Suppose that you bought a font but the license
doesn't allow you to make it available to others.

Sure, this is the preferred way to install new fonts, whenever
possible.

This is certainly a reasonable workaround but it's better to find out
what went wrong.  IMO, at least.  I would run

  $EDITOR `kpsewhich pdftex.map`

and search for "faumw8r".  There should be a line beginning with this
string but according to the error message this line is missing.  If
this line is missing, updmap is the culprit.  The most likely reason
is that it was called with wrong arguments.

If the line is missing I would also run updmap again and examine the
messages written to screen carefully.  Does it process emerlad.map at
all?

  Reinhard

I do not know the emerald package but if faumw8r is expected, then the
key point is to use

updmap-sys --enable Map=emerald.map

Map says that you install PS fonts, the DVI drivers as well as pdftex
should search for PFB files, while MixedMap says that PK fonts may be
generated from MF sources.

Subject: [tex-live] XeLaTeX Not enough memory (part 2)
Message-ID: <4BF7CF07.9080504@users.sourceforge.net>

Hi all,

TeX Live 2009 has increased (doubled) the amount of memory which XeLaTeX 
can allocate. However, this still gets me into trouble.

I'm constructing a font catalogue with 210 different types, almost all 
in regular, bold, bold italic and italic. All OTF, TTF and type1 are 
accessed via \fontspec, sometimes with different settings for lining 
numerals, ligatures, etc. is being used via \addfontfeatures.

If I add one of two more types, I get the famous "not enough memory" 
error. The documentation tells me to increase font_mem_size. This is set 
to 3000000 and I could only raise it to 4000000 without it having any 
effect on the numbers at which it crashes.

I have discovered that using TTF takes up a whole lot more of memory as 
using type1. However the output file is still very small, 15 MB. For the 
file size, it is not an issue, only for the memory needed while 
processing the tex file.

Hence, I have the following questions:
- How can one configure in TeX Live the order of inclusion of font 
types? E.g. firstly use typ1, secondly user ttf, ... etc.
- Do I abuse fontspec in anyway for XeLaTeX to require so much memory or 
is fontspec not optimised in this regard?
- Could once again the default value of fonts_mem_size be doubled? Why 
is this limited anyway? While running XeLaTeX I never have memory 
problems on my 4GB 64-bit machine, whereas other applications are free 
to use as much as they like.

Regards,

Pander

Message-ID: <htbv51$t9g$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hello,

How can I change the suported languages with
an existing installation of TeX Live?

Whenn installing there was a dialog and I selected all
languages. But now bael load _all_ languages every time.

I only need english, german and related packages and
frensh, lating and greek.

I found a language.dat file (windows) in
"C:\texlive\2009\texmf\tex\generic\config" which seems
to be the right file to edt, but I don't know if I can just
edit that file.

What do I have to respect if I would like to change
that settings in TeX-Live?

But it would be good if the TL Update Manager will
update all languages when updating, not only the
selected ones.

Btw and to the developers:
It would be gould if a user can change the settings after
the installation and tlmgr sould be extended by such a dialog.

Thomas

Subject: [tex-live] enable etex from the commandline in TeX Live and a
	missing dvi file
Message-ID: <htbv52$t9i$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hello,

I would like to use the latex with the etex extensions from the
commandline and with MiKTeX and in the past I had it done
by defalult and by invoking latex with

latex -enable-etex [...other opts...] mydoc.tex

in TeX Live I tried to do that with:

latex -etex

but than I get the hint  "-etex only works with -ini"
If I add the -ini option I get the error:
./document.tex:14: I can't find file `{preamble}'.

Hmmm, looks interesting and I assume there must be an
additional *.ini file for etex formats

I searched the TeX-Live tree and found etex.ini which
includes etex.src

IMHO the final command should be something like

latex -etex -ini etex.ini

but this produces much output of additional etex messsages.
Would be good if there are only the "normal" latex messages.

And now there is an etex.fmt file in my project directory
but there is alread an format file located (windows) at:

C:\texlive\2009\texmf-var\web2c\pdftex\etex.fmt

The file in my project dir seems to be an exact copy of that file.

I also have now an additional etex.log file in my project directory.
How can I redirect/place that log file, eg. to a subdir "tmp" which
is my "working" folder, passed to latex using "-output-directory=tmp"

And how can I supress/reduce all the additional etex output?
Especially all the output of loaded words for a large number
of languages and how to supress the font infos, etc.

Usually I only need the output which are related to my
document and when there is something going wrong within
my document. At the end I would like to have an output
which is similar to that ouptut of miktex. This makes it
more easy to me to compare, etc.

btw: I already redirect the output to >/dev/null (>nul) but with
the last run of latex I would like to see the messages (expect
the additional etex messages) which are from the latex command.

Finaly:
Where can I find now the produced mydoc.dvi? ;-)
It seems there is no dvi with these "-etex -ini etex.ini" options.
Why? Do I have to use other switches/args to get latex running
with etex from the commandline?

Thomas

You should disable language with entries in

c:\texlive\texmf-local\tex\generic\config\language-local.dat

like

%!french
%!greek

assuming you want to disable french and greek. Then run

tlmgr --rebuild-sys generate language

to re-generate the file language.dat and the formats that depend on it.

    - How can one configure in TeX Live the order of inclusion of font 
    types? E.g. firstly use typ1, secondly user ttf, ... etc.

There is no general mechanism for ordering search of font types across
programs.  I don't know if XeTeX has some specific way to control it.  I
don't recall ever seeing such a thing.  But since you are making a huge
font catalogue it is not surprising to me that it takes a huge amount of
memory.

    - Do I abuse fontspec in anyway for XeLaTeX to require so much memory or 
    is fontspec not optimised in this regard?

I hope someone who knows about fontspec will answer.

    - Could once again the default value of fonts_mem_size be doubled?

The default value of font_mem_size is 3,000,000 and I don't especially
want to hugely increase it, since that memory is malloc-ed at startup as
far as I can tell.

However, the hard limit is defined by sup_font_mem_size in tex.ch.  I
increased that from 4,000,000 to 147,483,647, so you can change
font_mem_size in texmf.cnf yourself and remake your format.

I trust someone will correct me if I'm wrong -- it appears to me that
font_mem_size is simply an integer, so 2^31-1 should be the actual
maximum (on 32-bit architectures).  That would have been 2,147,483,647,
but I just didn't want to go that far, so I lopped off the 2 :).

    Why is this limited anyway?

Because nearly everything in TeX & derivatives (except for LuaTeX) is
allocated as a static limit.  That's how Knuth wrote it, and making them
dynamically increasable is not simple.

Perhaps you should consider making your font catalogue using LuaTeX.  (At
least, I think Taco has eradicated most of these hard limits by now?)

Just a note on that: Currently luatex is not particularly memory
efficient with fonts, i takes one or several hundreds of MBs for a few
opentype fonts, depending on the number of glyphs in them and such (I
think)...

Agreed, and with a current computer it does not hurt the loading time 
either, unless you feel the difference of a few milliseconds?

No that is definitely the wrong one. THe right one is in 
	texmf-var/tex/generic/config/language.*
but it will be rewritten by tlmgr update procedure.

That is documented in the documentation of tlmgr ... so you might
read through the section of "generate" acton of it.

If you disable the languages as described above tlmgr will still
update them,

And in addition, there is an easy way:
	tlmgr remove collection-lang-foobar
f you don't need it, why do you install it?

AFAICT, most luatex memory issues with fonts is related to kerning
tables, loading a handful of fonts with huge kerning tables can eat
gigabytes of memory.

Since the kerning tables especially take up much of the memory and I 
only use a certain font on a certain page, would it be possible to 
provide a command on the next page to free memory by manually forcing 
unloading of that font?

Please, step forward and dig through the web code to make all the malloc
dynamically. THat has been done as said for luatex, but not for all
engines.

of course.  tex is a 1970s program; the legend is that dynamic memory in
the pascal don started with was "unreliable", so he didn't use it.

i guess that the budget for developing xetex didn't run to dealing with
this.

a good proportion of that work was presumably done in the creation of
y&y tex, which did dynamic allocation.  the sources of y&y tex are now
in the public domain, and may seen (iirc) somewhere on the tug site.

Thanx for that tip and perhaps I found a small bug, because I get an error:

Oh, yeah, I remember fixing that one a few days ago. But the fixed won't be out
before TL 2010. I recommend you don't use the --rebuild-sys option, and manually
run fmtutils-sys --byfmt language.dat. It should work after that.

I'm not sure to what extent portability was a consideration (obviously  
some!) but if you wanted a chance of porting a significant Pascal  
program in the late 70s, you probably wanted not to do dynamic memory  
allocation, whether or not the original compiler could do it.

To play the Devil's advocate a bit: on a modern VM system it ought to  
be basically fine to say "just allocate me a huge amount of memory",  
so long as you don't use too much.  Sensible platforms which don't do  
memory overcommit may run out of swap allocation, but it shouldn't  
cause a performance issue.

(Of course the issue it will cause it people saying "Ew, TeX is using  
5GB of memory, whine whine" when what they mean is "has allocated 5GB  
of address space which it will not use and which has basically zero  
cost".  But I can see that preventing the whining might be a big  
reason not to do this.)

Message-ID: <201005250059.o4P0xuIo007068@f7.net>

I've updated http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html with information for
the 2010 pretest.  It is basically the same story as last year --
download/install from a special repository.  A few platforms have not
yet been updated: i386-netbsd, mips-irix, powerpc-aix, sparc-solaris;
they should be coming over the next week or so.  All the rest will be in
as of tonight's build, if I don't mess it up.

The documentation has not yet been touched since 2009.  The usual brief
summary of changes is on the pretest page.  Corrections/additions welcome.

Give it a try if you're willing.

Thanks,
k

It is not that simple. Many 'out of memory' errors come from bad macros
that fill up all available <whatever array>. Allocating huge arrays will
make TeX fail in a really annoying way in those cases. This is a problem
that is not yet solved in LuaTeX either.

Having fully dynamic allocation would likely make it fail in an even  
more annoying way (using up all the VM on the system unless there are  
resource constraints preventing this).  I'm not sure there is a non- 
annoying way for something which is leaking memory to fail.

And what about my other remark suggesting an alternative way of dealing 
with the current situation by manually unloading fonts by force from a 
certain page onward, when one is certain that the font will not be used 
in that portion of your document?

If that's possible that would be better.  I was really only commenting  
that the naive approach of "allocate a huge static array" which TeX  
does is actually not so bad on any recent virtual memory system.

pretest installs "worked" (e.g., a set of simple compiles worked using
multiple engines) for me on a couple linux systems:

1) 2 Ubuntu 10.4 amd64 boxes, scheme-medium
2) Ubuntu 9.10 i386, scheme-medium

Notes:

On both Ubuntu 10.4 installs (home+work) the network connection glitched
just after hyperref was installed, but the installer recovered gracefully.
I used a different mirror for the Ubuntu 9.10 install.

The suggestion to add <tlpath>/texmf/doc/man to the MANPATH may
cause problems for systems that use manpath(1) to generate a run-time
MANPATH.   For such systems, I prefer to create a symbolic link in
<tlpath>/bin to ../texmf/doc/man.

I just tried a network install of the context scheme. First, the
very good news: both context mkii and mkiv are close to perfect,
based on the tests I have done so far.

Nevertheless, some requests and remarks, in order of importance:

* it would be really nice if the tl installer could be made to run
   an initial
	luatools --generate
   in post-install because otherwise the 'context' command does
   not work out of the box.

* fmtutil does not want to generate the context mkii formats, even
   though they are defined in fmtutil.cfg. Maybe this is because there
   are two entries with the same name?

* it would be even nicer if fmtutil could be made to support mkiv
   formats as well. The creation command is:

   context --make [en|nl|fr|ro|de|it]

   [|] == alternate choices

   even just 'en' would be really nice to have.

* assuming the final version will keep shell_escape=p: can 'mpost'
   please be added to the list of acceptable commands? otherwise
   we will have to ask all context users to add shell_escape=t
   by themselves

* because $TEXMFCACHE is not set in texmf.cnf, the context luatex-cache
   folder ends up in my $TMP directory (but that's ok, it works)

* perhaps the pxfonts and txfonts packages can be added into
   scheme-context. context uses these for math in the default 'palatino'
   and 'times' typescripts.

Finally (but maybe that is just me):

* in tlmgr --gui, it was not at all obvious to me that you can click on
   the 'Loaded repository: none' to actually load a repository.

Best wishes,
Taco

An addition (but I think Karl is aware of that already) the targets of
the scripts 'rlxtools' and 'ctxtools' are not executable yet.

Hi Taco,

What about adding something to the context packages post action, so
that luatools --generate is called whenever context is updated/installed?

Is that new? WHat do you mean with "does not want to"? 
	fmtutil-sys --all
should create all formats. It is true that --byfmt does not work
because it does not distniguish between different engines.

But it doe snot fit into the way fmtutil is calling the engines, right?

Any other suggestion?

Have in mind that we are dealing with multi user installations, where
should the output of luatools --generate go to? Into a per user setting?

BTW; this is one of the open problems I posed I don't know years (well,
more or less ;-) ago, how to deal with multi user systems. Unfortunately
Hans was ignoring that completely as he is single user single windows
running, but it *is* a problem.

As long as the lua cache cannot be split into:
- system cache for the system files (texmf-*)
- user cache for ~/texmf or whatever
this is unfortunately a pain.

If you want so please add them there, or tell me and I do it, no problem.

Yes, it is only an additional feature, you can go to Menu->tlmgr and
load the repository form there. The rest is a trick I did to make my
own life easier ;-)

Sounds good, but I have no idea how to do that.

Except that it didn't. But then it dawned on me that this was
because there was no cont-en.ini file. Meanwhile I've added
suitable files to the repository.

Right. Using a horrible trick with os.execute I can get it to actually
build the format, but fmtutil keeps believing the generation failed.

I would be fine with $TEXMFCACHE=$TEXMFHOME, sure.

True and much like last year, this is unlikely to get fixed by Hans.

I realize this command line may have an issue with TEXMFCACHE not being
set yet, making it not so easy to implement. So perhaps better forget
about it. I am already quite happy that after a just a tiny manual
intervention mkiv actually worked.

Best wishes,
Taco

On linux, I don't have $TMP set, just $TMPDIR, and I ended up with
~/luatex-cache.   Since the cache depends on the contents of the
texmf trees, the cache should go to something like ~/.texlive2010
so as not to confuse TL2011 (I suppose we could leave TL2010
alone and remember to adjust TL2011).

I have been using "tlmgr --repository ... --gui", but if I run the new
tlmgr without setting --repository on a system with MacTeX (TL2009)
installed, the repository set for MacTeX is used.   Does this mean
the installer could get confused on systems with pre-existing
TL installs?   Where is the repository setting saved?

No. This is the single-user problem Norbert was talking about earlier.

This is not that important: the context luatex cache contains
an md5sum of the directory location of data it is cacheing, and
these directories already contain '2010' in them somewhere.

The problem is that because there is no separation between -sys
and non-sys, either everything of all users is shared, or nothing
at all is shared. The second seems the lesser evil to me.

I don't know the right variable to select the user's home scratch
space in texlive (I do not normally use texlive) even though I
know there is one. So my proposal was to add

   TEXMFCACHE=~/.texlive2010 % or whatever

It will result in multiple formats (one for each user on the harddisk)
but at least they will not get into eachother's way. Disk space is
cheap enough these days, I think.

Best wishes,
Taco

FWIW, I agree.

The consequence, concerning the installer and tlmgr, would be that we (TL) don't
need to do anything, and each user wanting to use MkIV would need to generate
her own cache herself. Is that ok for you?

~/.texlive2010 already contains two subdirectories: texmf-var and texmf-config.
IMO, TEXMFCACHE should either use its own subdirectory, like

TEXMFCACHE=~/.texlive2010/luatex-cache

or use an appropriate subdirectory of an existing tree (TEXMFVAR looks
appropriate to me), like

TEXMFCACHE=$TEXMFVAR/tex/luatex/cache

    her own cache herself. Is that ok for you?

It's what we've done before, and what I expected to do this year.
I'd rather not attempt to call luatools --generate as part of install-tl.

    ~/.texlive2010 already contains two subdirectories: texmf-var and texmf-config.

I propose $TEXMFVAR/texmf-var/luatex-cache.  I see no advantage to
proliferating directories under ~/.texliveYYYY.  And texmf-var is
already supposed to be only stuff that can be regenerated, which this is.

    pretest installs "worked"

Thanks for trying it.  Glad to hear it went ok.

    For such systems, I prefer to create a symbolic link in
    <tlpath>/bin to ../texmf/doc/man.

FWIW, we already include such a symlink for all non-Windows platforms.

I don't know whether this information is helpful regarding context,
but if there is a program "foo", it actually doesn't have to be aware
of "-sys".  It's sufficient to provide a wrapper script "foo-sys":

---------------------------------------------------
#! /bin/sh

TEXMFVAR=`kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFSYSVAR`
TEXMFCONFIG=`kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFSYSCONFIG`

export TEXMFVAR TEXMFCONFIG

exec foo

No, that wouldn't help. Context mkiv (to the best of my knowledge)
only uses a single location for the cache at run time.

This means setting TEXMFCACHE to $TEXMFVAR/texmf-var ; the
'luatex-cache' part is added automatically by luatools.

Then it should be $TEXMFVAR because it expands to
$HOME/.texliveYEAR/texmf-var
so
TEXMFCACHE=$TEXMFVAR
will be correct then.

In the olden days in England, you could be hung for stealing a sheep or a
loaf of bread.  However, if a sheep stole a loaf of bread and gave it to
you, you would only be tried for receiving, a crime punishable by forty
lashes with the cat or the dog, whichever was handy.  If you stole a dog
and were caught, you were punished with twelve rabbit punches, although it
was hard to find rabbits big enough or strong enough to punch you.

I added the following to texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf:

% TEXMFCACHE, where luatools (from context) stores cached data.
% The default setting gives each user a private copy of the
% cache.  For sharing data between all users:
%   TEXMFCACHE = $TEXMFSYSVAR
TEXMFCACHE = $TEXMFVAR

Dear Norbert,

it's somehow still readable, but nevertheless a bit weird. The
documentation of most TL scripts looks like the following in bash on

Hi Mojca,
this is caused by less(1) being invoked without the -R option.

Could you set the environment variable

   LESS='-R -M --shift 5'

and try again?

  Reinhard

"recognized" by default?

      if ($OS eq "darwin") {
        # We never want to guess x86_64-darwin even if config.guess
        # does, because Leopard can be 64-bit but our x86_64-darwin
        # binaries will only run on Snow Leopard.
        $CPU = "universal";
      } elsif ($CPU =~ /^i.86$/) {
        $CPU = "i386";  # 586, 686, whatever
      }

This is (though I admit it's ugly) code that we use in ConTeXt to
determine the platform:

# if running Snow Leopard or later
# better: /usr/bin/sw_vers -productVersion
if test `uname -r|cut -f1 -d"."` -ge 10 ; then
  # if working on 64-bit hardware
  if test `sysctl -n hw.cpu64bit_capable` = 1; then
    # snowleopard32=TRUE
    platform="osx-64"
  fi
fi

Hi list,

With the following example the placed text is "something" in the background (used viewer search to find it). Is there a way to get in the foreground?

Taco, something seems not to work properly. I tried an installation 
and my luatex-cache ended up in $HOME/ instead of $TEXMFCACHE

Are you sure that luatools evaluate TEXMFCACHE?

Hi all!

Installation on Windows2000

First stage failed downloading wallpaper

Recovery installation succeeded (as suggested using --profile

Unfortunately TeXworks does not support W2K.
It supports Windows XP or later ones.

Hi,

I am now running a new installation attempt on a different machine.
It is still running so I will get back to the ConTeXt stuff
later, but first, I have a few general problems to report:

* the tlpkg directory of ftp.ctex.org is empty this morning.

* on this machine (or in this install-tl version), the tk gui didn't
  work. It starts up ok, but when I press the install button, I get:

Tk::Error: no event type or button # or keysym at
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/Tk/Widget.pm

It appears that TEXMFCACHE has to be an actual environment variable
for the current luatools to work. I'll see whether I can patch
luatools and report back later on this.

Different question: I had made this changes to texmf.cnf and
another change to Master/texmf-dist/tex/context/user/cont-sys.rme ,
but neither of those appear to have made it into this night's
build (fetched from cstug an hour ago). Was I supposed to do
something besides the actual file edits?

Best wishes,
Taco

Windows? Unix?
It doesn't do that for me?

Do you have perldoc installed (which perldoc)?

Hmm, seems to have been a download problem, I can un-xz wallpaper.doc.tar.xz
without any problem.

I guess network corruption.

Message-ID: <4BFE39BB.5030806@imf.au.dk>

Hi, does anyone have an updated equivs file for ubuntu?

I use the TUG TeXLive, and is doing some tests with ubuntu. I've 
installed the debian vanilla equivs as mentioned on the texlive page. 
But it is not complete, at least not for Ubuntu.

trying to install kile, ubuntu wants to remove texlive-local and want to 
install loads of ubuntu texlive packages.

I have a full TL09 installation.

Message-ID: <0D78E4E8-67A5-41A6-B7C4-69D4EA71BADC@wideopenwest.com>

Howdy,

Now that I've got the MacTeX(TeX Live)-2010 pretest installed I've set up TeX Live Utility (a front end for tlmgr on Mac) to work with the pretest repository at math.utah.edu. My first use updated tlmgr 18496 (which supports persistent connection). When downloading all the packages I got multiple messages like

/usr/texbin/tlmgr: (make_container __BACKUP_context.universal-darwin.r16044.tar) bin/universal-darwin/mpstools does not exist

referring to mpstools, mptopdf, mtxtools, pdftools, pstopdf, runtools, texfont, textools, texutil, tfmtools, and xmltools. Then the context update times out and tlmgr retried with wget; I don't know if that succeeded or not. I got some messages similar to the one above concerning some doc files for moderncv. Finally I got the failure to generate the ptex plain format mentioned in other messages.

I'm not sure any of this is significant but wanted to pass this on.

Most items (and there were quite a few) seemed to update fine.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

However, on Debian testing, I still get problems with Kile. (Texworks and
texmaker are OK.) More precisely, dblatex is causing problems. I recommend
installing kile with

aptitude install -o 'APT::Install-Rcommends=0' kile

which should work (please report if it doesn't), and then manually installing
the desired packages from the recommends list, excluding the package that are
causing problems, like dblatex.

I fail to understand why dblatex insists on installing all those packages. Oh,
wait, I just had an idea. The Depends: line of dblatex reads:

Depends: python, python-support (>= 0.90.0), docbook-xml, xsltproc |
python-4suite-xml, python-apt (>= 0.7.91), texlive (>= 2009),
texlive-bibtex-extra (>= 2009), texlive-latex-extra (>= 2009),
texlive-math-extra (>= 2009), texlive-extra-utils (>= 2009)

Could it be that the versions are the culprit? Like, the dummy package build
with equivs lacks version information, so dblatex is not satisfied with it?

A Debianer, please ? Norbert ?

Thanks,
Manuel.

No, not at all.

This is definitively a bug, and a serious one indeed. Thanks for
pointing it out, I'll look into it.

What is the equivs package providing? Maybe try the following:
- give the equivs generated package a version 2009.1
- provide all the texlive packages

Maybe that helps

I guess that it is a problem with the depends, but I cannot change the
dblatex package.

You need to apply the following patch to file lib/xindy/modules/base/tex.xdy:

The patch also fixes a long-standing bug that leading blanks are not

Things look mainly so far here (Mac OS 10.6).

One thing: what is the situation with the 64 bit Mac binaries? 
Currently, you still have to grab these separately (they are not 
included in the standard MacTeX). Any plans to integrate them (I guess 
next year at best)? What about updates: does tlgmr "pick up" the 
presence of the binaries and do them as part of the usual run, or if not 
how do you update them?

Another point. Doing an update raises an error with building formats:

! I can't find file `ukrhyph-ptex.tex'.
<to be read again>
                    \relax
l.370   \repeat

Not a problem, but might worry some people.

Already fixed in the sources, should be in the next mactex update.

I'm discussing with Dick.  As far as TL goes, x86_64-darwin/ is just
another platform, a sibling to universal-darwin, i386-linux, etc.  The
separation is purely because of Apple installer issues, was my first
impression.  I'm sure there will be more about this on the mactex list.

    What about updates: does tlgmr "pick up" the presence of the
    binaries and do them as part of the usual run, or if not how do you
    update them?

Any updates on the server are made to all installed platforms, yes.

    is there a reason why they are not "recognized" by default?

Dick strongly encouraged (more like "told me in no uncertain terms" :)
me to just always default to universal-darwin and leave any select of
the 64-bit binaries to the user.

Further questions to Dick :).

Thank you. He answered me already that he did that on purpose. Locally
I installed 64-bit binaries and have set up the path to point to
those, so that's still fine.

At least until OS X 10.7 is out, defaulting to universal binaries
should work fine, so that's OK. (I wouldn't be surprised if one would
have to install a compatibility module to get the 32-bit binaries
working on 10.7, but by that time TL 2011 should be out already.)

(The most important member of ConTeXt community would like to run the
binaries on iPad, but since none of them work on it, it's pretty
irrelevant which ones are chosen by default :) :) :) :)

I installed last night TL2010 to x86_64-linux. It was extremely smooth
(albeit pretty lengthy, 5h)
so far no updates.


However I would like to have few things clarified:

1) /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/ is almost twice larger than
/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux/ and I see a lots of new binaries


< bibtexu
< chktex
< chkweb
< deweb
< dvisvgm
< makejvf
< mendex
< pbibtex
< pdvitype
< platex
< ppltotf
< ptex
< ptftopl
< repstopdf

and some binaries have gone.

> mpstools
> mptopdf
> mtxtools
> pdftools
> pstopdf

> texfont
> textools

While none of the latter seem to be of great importance it would be
worth to know which of them will reemerge later, which are replaced
and which are gone (on multiuser system there will be always someone
who uses the least important and obsolete tool and opens mouth wilely
if it disappears :-(

2) I thought that texworks will be included in TL2010, Is there hope
that they will come to final?

Thank you. Victor

No, it is not that, the correct tlp is used. 

I have no idea where it might come from.

Herbert: does this happen on all packages or only on some, and does i
happen *always* or did it happen only once?

Please check the next days what you experience and report back, thanks.

Well, it's usefull indeed, esp in combination with rlxtools but i wonder 
if it's used outside the context community.

This has always been part of context, despite its utilitarian/general

    2) I thought that texworks will be included in TL2010, Is there hope
    that they will come to final?

TW was included in TL'09, for Windows.  Whether we have a new version in
TL'10 depends (says Jonathan) on getting past some Windows bug.

As far as I can imagine, we will never include TW for Unix platforms, if
that's what you were asking, because the vast shared library
dependencies would make it impossible to distribute binaries that have
any chance of working on even a few versions.  Better for people to get
it in other ways so what they get actually stands a chance of working.

I'm sometimes using it though I'm not (yet?) a context user (I only attended a
context user meeting as a tourist). I seem to remember getting better results
than with eps2pdf from the GS distribution in some cases (though I have no
actual example nor exact memories about it).

I also use it sometimes although I also can't give an example right now
of what for. I don't use context, though. (Actually, I once played with
it very briefly but doubt I would even qualify as a tourist.)

Sometimes ps floating on Internet files are really borked. I found
that in some cases pkfix helps, but distiller does not, in others
cases distiller works but  pkfix fails, and so on. So probably any
general purpose utility has its place and it would be pity to drop it.

So far TW binaries are offered to Ubuntu, Mac and Windows. Yes, I
understand the problems of compiling TW for various Unix platforms and
it is exactly why I think that just source distribution is not enough.
Probably I will address TW mailing list.

Hi,

Now that the STIX fonts are released, is there any chance of them making it into TeX Live 2010? What would the procedure be to get them onto CTAN? (They are distributed under the SIL Open Font License.) I'm happy to "maintain" a CTAN STIX fonts package (i.e., just send in the fonts) if that's necessary.

I'm about to release a package for XeTeX (and LuaTeX sooner or later) for using unicode maths fonts in LaTeX, and it would be great to be able to use these fonts by default.

Upload them simply to CTAN, in some directory structure that might
make sense ;-)

OK, I'll make sure it comes back (I never realized it was a context

it has some heuristics built in (and some cleanup of eps crap) as well 
as is some features that make it possible to use it in workflows where 
several quality veriants are needed

All right, I've tried my best.

Nothing in the package except a readme and a TDS folder of the fonts with their documentation & licence.

Wasn't sure if they should go in opentype/public/stix or opentype/stipub/stix. I went for the latter on a coin flip.

Subject: [tex-live] fontspec for LuaTeX
Message-ID: <D8F41A0D-214E-41C0-AA05-6CC6A0D81405@gmail.com>

Dear all,

Now that luaotfload and fontspec have been uploaded to CTAN, the next test release of TeX Live / MacTeX 2010 will contain support for using system fonts in LuaTeX. (Apologies to those who get this email twice.)

Previous users of fontspec will be familiar with the process, but there are some changes in fontspec for LuaTeX compared to its XeTeX counterpart. I've written about the biggest changes here: <http://latex-alive.tumblr.com/post/643148677/fontspec-for-luatex>

To date, there has been very little testing of the new version of fontspec, especially with OpenType font loading in LuaTeX. Any testing you could perform would be greatly appreciated, especially running the mkluatexfontdb script in the luaotfload package and then attempting to access system fonts in LuaLaTeX with fontspec. 

(E.g., \usepackage{fontspec}...\setmainfont{Georgia} )

Note however that Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) contains a bug with its .ttc fonts, so none of these types of fonts can be loaded through LuaTeX. (E.g., system-distributed Cochin, Hoefler Text, Optima, etc.) This is a shame but there's nothing we can do about it.

Any recompilation of any old XeLaTeX documents that use fontspec would also be invaluable to me in knowing if I've accidentally broken anything in my recent updates.

Many thanks,
-- Will

One friendly expert suggested that there was a confusion between
pstopdf as a general utility which actually is not part of TL (but in
MacOSX part of OS) and pstopdf a part of TL/context. Definitely my
remark applies to the former albeit it does not deem the latter
useless.

add a README or something.  assuming there are no caveats on the sil

2) With the same PATH

 returns exactly the same errors (with 2010)

setenv PATH "/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux:${PATH}"


3) If however
setenv PATH "/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux:${PATH}"

both %asy
i.e. %/usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux/asy

and

/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/asy

do not not return any errors.

 Looks strange as is not /usr/local/texlive/2009/bin/x86_64-linux/asy
load 2009  files despite path?

Message-ID: <4C00DF3C.3050100@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

I just read in the documentation that tlmgr was supposed to have a menu 
bar. Mine doesn't :(

The lack of a menu bar could be related to this message during startup:

[taco at ntg images]$ ~/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr --gui
Loading local TeX Live Database
This may take some time, please wait!
Use of uninitialized value $i in numeric le (<=) at 
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Tk/Menu.pm 
line 1041.
Completed.

Is my perl/Tk too old? (too new?)

   perl-base-5.10.0-25.1mdv2009.0
   perl-Tk-804.028-9mdv2009.0

This is bad-ish, because I wanted to look at that Options tab that was
promised :-/


Best wishes,
Taco

Probably too new:

This is perl, v5.8.8 built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi (Tk-804.028)
there are menus (from TL2009) (tlmgr Options Actions Help)

Umpff .. aehmmmm.... what?

I have never seen that.

Is that line mentioned above:
	for (my $i = $src->cget('-tearoff'); $i <= $last; $i++)

> Is my perl/Tk too old? (too new?)

I would say neither nor. That is perl/tk and that has not been changed
since ages (well in fact 1 week ago after 3 years or so ;-)

The same with TL2009 and TL2010 prerelease.

http://dir.filewatcher.com/d/TeX-CTAN/language/hebrew/hebtex/unix/new/hebfonts.tar.gz.308893.html

One can really find them on some CTAN mirrors but on CTAN itself they
seem to be renamed

ftp://ftp.ctan.org//pub/tex-archive/language/hebrew/hebtex/unix/new/hebfonts.tar.gz
(and other files in this directory)

Sorry - I made a mistake (probably wondered to the wrong directory).

Is there any reason for these fonts not to be in TL? Definitely
including in TL will not help to those who uses TL2009 leave alone
TL2008

I've been staring at the perl code for an hour now and trying semi-
informed changes to see if it helps any. So far, to no avail. Unless
someone else reports the same problem, I'll write it off as a local
mis-configuration of perl/Tk.

none of hebtex has a coherent licence statement, but when i examined it,
the impression i got was mostly "nonfree", and i catalogued it ass such.

nonfree theings don't get into tex live.  in this case, the distribution
is such a shambles that hebtex isn't even in miktex (that often holds
things catalogued as non-free).

Which means that those who want them should get and install them by themselves.

I wonder why hebcal is installed into babel directory while hebtex is
installed into arabtex. Is the some inconsistency?

Buggy -- see: <https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=40359>, but marked
as fixed.  The bug report used /usr/bin/widget:

forcing perl with this directory launches the script, with some warnings:
$ perl -I/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Tk/demos/widget_lib
/usr/bin/widget
Use of uninitialized value $i in numeric le (<=) at
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.10.0/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Tk/Menu.pm
line 1041.

It seems to be an issue for the linux vendor.   If the "widget"
example fails then
tlmgr hasn't a hope of working.

Wild guess: Can you edit
	.../texmf/scripts/texlive/tlmgrgui.pl
and replace *every* occurrentce of
	->Menu()
with
	->Menu(-tearoff => 1)

No idea if that helps ....

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual mint, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

You must specify a repository as described on the pretest page (http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html):

"In the case of the installer package, the pretest repository location to install from must be specified:
install-tl -repository http://somehost/some/path ..."

there's a gna project of that name, with sole contributor yannis
haralambous.  of course, it's empty.

there has been a post to c.t.t recently, which i can't find, and there's
a mention in a thread titled

  wszystkie pola w bibtexu
	
in 2005.

the one i can't find (i think) gave a download site, and was complaining
it wasn't in tl.

of course, there's no sign of an upload to ctan, but tl doesn't mind
installing non-ctan binaries (witness xetex, for example).

pity about biblatex-biber, but that's too complicated (vide this list,
passim).  :-(

Message-ID: <AANLkTinfahcQBK6IqXGwJ4X7QRHIWS-I6obhD9tFHA4l@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Karl,

ptex formats fail to work.

In this file:
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/ptexgeneric/ukrhyph/ukrhyph-ptex.tex?revision=18509&view=markup

The following line
\def\t{t2a}\ifx\t\Encoding\input hypht2 \fi

should read hypht2-ptex. I have fixed the TL sources. If anyone
disagrees, feel free to undo my change. It's quite possible that
nobody has noticed that due to the fact that the other file is present
in full install, while in minimal install as mine it was not.

    I gather this is what used to be bibtex8 in former years?

No, it is an independent project.  bibtex8 still exists (and is still in
TL).  In fact, Peter put in yeoman efforts to update bibtex, bibtex8,
bibtexu so that they had more or less the same behavior wrt memory
allocation, etc.

bibtexu is/was a project by Yannis (and a student or two) to use the ICU
library with BibTeX.  Peter also put in the massive efforts needed to
make this work in the TL build system and have bibtexu and xetex use the
same ICU library

I have never seen any documentation or other details about bibtexu.  I
asked Yannis about it a couple days ago; no response as of yet.

In my test on windows, mkluatexfontdb failed at

It seems that "ptex's version of babel" doesn't properly handle
language synonyms. But I may just as well be wrong. After renaming
slovene.sty into slovenian.sty (and some more fixes inside that file)
or after switching slovene and slovenian in language.ptx it all
started working just fine.

I don't say that you need to fix language.ptx (I do not expect any
Slovenian to run ptex, so you may ignore my observation), but it might
make sense to look into the issue of synonym handling. It doesn't need
to be done straight away though.

Mojca

PS: I have just realized that the default hyphenmin values are not set
in slovene.ldf, so the values 2/3 are used by default, but they should
be 2/2.

Yes, ptex does not use hyph-utf8, but its own shipped hyphen
files. It is a pain, and in the long run we want to get rid of
that, but currently the test for utf8 capable does not work
with ptex.

If we *could* get that sorted out before release that would
be phantastic.

(Akira posted some other answer that has probably not been approved
yet). I'll send an answer to that in a few minutes.

But that's a different issue from the one that I'm reporting here.
This one has to do with synonyms in language.ptx and is unrelated to
the need for the second version of patterns.

I'm ready to fix that, but I would need Akira's (or someone else's) directions.

Subject: [tex-live] Behaviour of texdoc script
Message-ID: <4761A800-AD25-4900-879F-C616076A7810@Freenet.DE>

Hello!

At some time in TeX Live 2009 the texdoc script lost its ability to  
start its search for documentation in the current working directory. I  
therefore preferred TL '08 a lot, because texdoc was set up in AUCTeX  
for my Emacsen as viewer for all *TeX output.

Could that splendid behaviour from TL '08 be re-introduced for TeX  
Live 2010? The work one puts into configuring texdoc could then easily  
be recycled in TeX related software.

I wasn't aware texdoc was used this way.

The change was intentional, since I tend to think of texdoc more as a
documentation locator than a documentation viewer in general, and from a
searching POV, looking in ./ is not very interesting (plus, there was a
complaint about something related to this).

It just so happens, I recently introduced the (for now undocumented, but I'll
change that since it seems to be useful) option --just-view that does just that:
open the given file (full name (or even path) expected) in the viewer used by
texdoc, precisely for that purpose (sharing viewer settings between texdoctk and
texdoc).

I hope it fulfils your needs.

Maybe it was only me who recommended in TeX or Emacs related lists the  
use of texdoc since years... It's really very useful!

Yes, thank you, it does! Few tests with updated setups for AUCTeX  
worked fine for PDF and DVI output files.

Peter, you are definitely not the only one (but probably the only one
using it *this way*).  I'm advertising texdoc too, though on the
texhax mailing list I often don't know whether people are using TeX
Live or MikTeX and whether mthelp and texdoc provide the same result.
Then I often have to provide links to the PDF files on CTAN though it
would be more sensible to point people to the doc browsers.

At BachoTeX 2010 there was a guy from Zurich who is using LaTeX only
casually.  I pointed him to texdoc and he was quite excited.  He
played the whole evening with this tool.

BTW, this guy held an amazingly interesting talk.  Have you ever seen
aligned paragraphs with proper hyphenation in HTML files?  He ported
TeX's (Franklin Liang's) hyphenation algorithm to JavaScript.  Yes,
your web browser is using the same hyphenation patterns then as TeX,
and of course, the script evaluates the HTML language tags properly.

When I was back home I installed the impressive example he presented
at the conference on my server:

  http://ms25.ath.cx

The button at the top allows you to switch hyphenation on and off.  If
it doesn't work, JavaScript is disabled in your web browser.  

See also:

  http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator

I mentioned this here, though it's a bit off-topic, because we are
talking about advertising already... :)

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've seen references to JS stuff in the texhyphen repo, but I didn't take the

No ? and I want it the "traditional way"!

Actually I read about it and found it hard to believe. It would really

Yes, Mathias is in contact with the texhyphen developers and he is
even involved in the development of the new German hyphenation
patterns.  It's nice that there is someone from Switzerland in the
team who takes care about Swiss German.  This is very important
because nobody in Germany knows what's going on in Switzerland.
German and Austrian are very similar but in Swiss German is quite
different.  For example, there is no '?' in Swiss German, which has a
severe impact on hyphenation.

And it was Mojca again who convinced Mathias to come to BachoTeX...
Any reminders, Manuel?  :)

Regards,
  Reinhard

PS.: When I said that nobody in Germany knows what's going on in
     Switzerland, I mean that Switzerland is mentioned quite rarely in
     German TV news.  Even if the Swiss elect a communist government,
     I'm not sure whether German TV stations think it's worthwhile to
     mention it.

Subject: [tex-live] minor tlmgr -gui issues
Message-ID: <4C037B5A.1060605@elvenkind.com>

Hi,

Two small things:

* If there is an infra update, tlmgr quits itself after installing it.
This works fine, but the last thing the operating system reports to
me is a segfault:

Executing action update texlive.infra
[1/1, ??:??/??:??] update: texlive.infra [215k] (18585 -> 18612) ... done
running mktexlsr ...
done running mktexlsr.
Completed.
Segmentation fault

It is harmless in the sense that tlmgr has completed all tasks already,
but the segfault is a bit ugly. Somehow I keep forgetting to
run gdb to see where it crashes, so no extra information.

* A purely cosmetic thing: after a context update, I get this report

regenerating fmtutil.cnf in /home/taco/texlive/2010/texmf-var
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-fr ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-fr.
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-ro ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-ro.
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-it ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-it.
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-nl ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-nl.
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt metafun ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt metafun.
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-en ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-en.
running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-de ...
done running fmtutil-sys --byfmt cont-de.
Completed.

This also lists the formats that are disabled in fmtutil.cnf, so the
messages are mildly misleading: they imply that the cont-fr etc.
formats are actually generated. I have no idea whether this is
easy to change, but it would be nice if it could print 'disabled' or
something like that for the formats that actually are disabled.

Best wishes,
Taco

But to end with very good news: after initial TL installation
is finished

   $ texexec hello
   $ texexec --xetex hello
   $ context hello
   $ luatools cont-en.tex
   $ mtxrun --script fonts --list --pattern=iwona\*
   $ pstopdf test.ps

All work out of the box (with suitable test files, of course), no
manual user configuration needed at all.

Also, the 'metafun' command is deleted (as it should be), 'context'
writes the luatex cache in ./.texlive2010/texmf-var/luatex-cache (like
it should), and 'texexec' no longer tries to call mpost via \write18
but instead runs mpost in between run (like it should).

Signing happily,
Taco

Dear list,

I attached the Japanese translation for install-tl and tlmgr. If
translation for Japanese is still unavailable, could you use these
files for it?

If there are other files to be translated to use with these programs,
please point them out.

Thank you in advance,

Hmmm, you are right ... very strange. I see the same on my unix box, with
	perl[20157]: segfault at 7ff53e07c72d ip 00007ff5a2b60588 sp 00007fff2f1f8dc8 error 4 in Tk.so[7ff5a2afc000+e0000]
I think I have to convince TL to finish decently the Tk module.

Currently the tlmgrgui.pl code jumps into tlmgr.pl:finish and that
calls simply 
	exit
and I expected that by that all the Tk stuff is shut down properly. 
But it looks it doesn't. Maybe I have to add a
	$::mainwindow->destroy;
before that. I will play around. Thanks for metnioninig it.

You mean "install-tl", not tlmgr, right.

Which GUI? perltk or wizard?

"after" script -- -no idea what that might be. The code is simply:
	$::sww->destroy; 
	$mainwindow->destroy;
	do_cleanup(); 
	exit(1); 
So I have no idea what that might again be ....

Please contact tldoc at tug.org, there are several more files to be 
translated, especially the guide, but that is a lenghty process, and of
course we would be very grateful if you could help us there.

That did the trick ($mw->destroy; just before finish(0) in tlmgrgui.pl)

At least on my unix there is no segfault anymore.

Please test with tomorrows tlmgr (if there was an update), or edit it by
hand:

Hello Vladimir,

 

There is a missing library libsicudata.a, i was supposing when I disabled the xetex option, it did not build.



libtool: link: g++ -g -O2 -o bibtexu bibtex-1.o bibtex-2.o bibtex-3.o bibtex-4.o bibtex.o utils.o  /home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/texk/kpathsea/.libs/libkpathsea.a /home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/libs/icu/icu-build/lib/libsicuio.a /home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/libs/icu/icu-build/lib/libsicui18n.a /home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/libs/icu/icu-build/lib/libsicuuc.a /home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/libs/icu/icu-build/lib/libsicudata.a -lm
g++: /home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/libs/icu/icu-build/lib/libsicudata.a: No such file or directory
make[4]: *** [bibtexu] Error 1
make[4]: Leaving directory `/home/huber/texlive/src/trunk/Build/source/Work/texk/bibtexu'


I have been installed fontconfig package, but I dont known how can i setup the path for the libraries and includes, Is there a flag or enviroment varible?

[and bibtexu build failed as a result]

apparently it's a bug in the build infrastructure - both xetex and
bibtexu are using the same ICU libraries, but --disable-xetex
incorrectly disables the build of ICU (when bibtexu is enabled).
Hopefully Peter will fix it.

you can pass configure options --with-fontconfig-includes and
--with-fontconfig-libdir to specify non-standard location of fontconfig
files.

(or if you have pkg-config binary which is aware of fontconfig, you can
put it into the PATH, - then configure will automatically find out
fontconfig's locations from there).

Best,
v.
