Hi all,

I have installed texlive1-20020427.iso (the Bachotek release ;-)
on a Linux machine. 
Everything ran fine for me, except the following small glitches: 

1) there is a texmf/fonts/type/public/yhmath directory which should be
              texmf/fonts/type1/public/yhmath  (typo?)

2) In texmf/doc/latex/eurofont, there are 2 files
   eurofont.dtx  and  eurofont.ins which should be in 
   texmf/source/latex/eurofont/; probably eurofont.dvi should be extracted
   from the .dtx file and put in texmf/doc/latex/eurofont.

3) The installation process complains about missing
   texmf/doc/latex/lettrine/demo.ps   and
   texmf/doc/latex/lettrine/demo.tex.
   These files are required in lettrine.tpm but are not available on the CD.

4) The array size in texmf.cnf are still not the same for 
   latex and hugelatex (one spurious '0' in lines marked '<='?).

% redundant. all LaTeX should be huge
main_memory.hugelatex = 1500000
param_size.hugelatex = 1500
stack_size.hugelatex = 1500
hash_extra.hugelatex = 15000
string_vacancies.hugelatex = 45000
pool_free.hugelatex = 47500
nest_size.hugelatex = 500
save_size.hugelatex = 5000
pool_size.hugelatex = 1250000
max_strings.hugelatex = 55000
font_mem_size.hugelatex= 400000

% standard LaTeX is itself huge

main_memory.latex = 1500000
param_size.latex = 15000          <=
stack_size.latex = 15000          <=
hash_extra.latex = 150000         <=
string_vacancies.latex = 450000   <=
pool_free.latex = 475000          <=
nest_size.latex = 5000            <=
save_size.latex = 50000           <=
pool_size.latex = 1250000
max_strings.latex = 550000        <=
font_mem_size.latex= 4000000      <=

5) Two dependencies problems:

   5a) aeguill.tpm  requires texmf/tex/latex/platex/ot4cmr.fd
       (this one is correctly installed), but the "plfonts" 
       texmf/fonts/tfm/pl/pl*.tfm and  texmf/fonts/type/pl/pl*.pfb
       are not installed.

   5b) tex-context.tpm requires  tex-etex, but this one is (still)
       not installed automatically. You have to select tex-etex too,
       when you select the tex-context collection.

That all for me!

./configure --prefix=../Binaries --datadir=../Binaries  --enable-multiplatform

does not work. Should I use:

./configure --prefix=../Binaries --datadir=../source --enable-multiplatform

instead?

I am still having problems compiling the extras. After a

I run
	make extras

this goes well, until it wants to do something in po and then the 
configure script fails because it cannot find libkpathsea.a (which has 
been installed fine)

I looked at the Makefile and at least it seems to me that

is strange because include and lib are not subdirectories of share, but 
of the main dir. I hacked a separate Makefile but that did not solve my 
problem. freetype config.status tells me what happened when I hacked the 
Makefile

Which looks fine.

Which is fine too.

I looked at freetype/contrib/ttf2pk/configure and it looks to me it 
might be the culprit  and it might depend on having an installed 
kpathsea somewhere in a more traditional location like /usr/local, 
instead of just the one in ...tex-prefix.../lib which would then succeed 
on those systems, but that is just a guess.

Anyway, make extras fails on Mac OS X when configuring ttf2pk and I 
suspect ttf2pk's configure is broken and I'd like to get this solved but 
I am currently fresh out of ideas.

Subject: [tex-live] Found?
Message-ID: <81043118-5DFC-11D6-A7C5-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

One problem found, probably *the* problem.

make extras does an install for kpathsea (because it needs it). The 
install for kpathsea however needs another ranlib on Mac OS X, because 
on Mac OS X (and some other systems) when the toc of the .a file is 
older than the file date, the linker will complain and abort. For that 
reason, I currently run that ranlib bny hand after doing a make install 
on my system. But that does not work if make extras does a make install 
on kpathsea.

The best solution is that 'make install' in TeX/texk/kpathsea is fixed 
so that it will perform a ranlib on the installed library. A temporary 
fix would be to remove the make install on kpathsea from the extras 
stuff. After all, the 'extras' are supposed to be run after an install 
has taken place anyway.

The current situation will not work on Mac OS X.

Subject: [tex-live] One problem located with ttf2pk configure (in fact with kpathsea install) on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <A44E8258-5DFE-11D6-A7C5-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

I have located one problem with ttf2pk configuration when running make 
extras on Mac OS X. On Mac OS X (and some other systems) the linker will 
not accept a library file that has a table of contents that is older 
than the file date. This means that the default 'make install' in 
kpathsea (which uses /usr/bin/install -c to create a copy of 
libkpathsea.a in the install directory) is not correct for Mac OS X. 
There are two solutions:
	1. Either run a ranlib after having copied it
	2. Use /usr/bin/install -p -c
Both may not be 100% portable as not all systems have ranlib and maybe 
not all systems have the -p flag for install (which preserves 
modification times).

The problem (apart from that make install produces a libkpathsea.a that 
is not usable) has been corrected so far by me by running a ranlib 
myself before packaging my binaries, which is of course not the best 
solution.

And the way 'make extras' is implemented defeats that approach, because 
there a 'make install' is *forced* in kpathsea, thus producing, in the 
current situation, an unusable libkpathsea.a in the install location 
after which configure of ttf2pk fails. I tested by adding the -p flag to 
the Makefile of kpathsea and this solved this particular problem. (There 
might be another problem still, as I have symlinked a bit on my system 
to make sure the library is found and I have to revert that still and 
test, a test which is now underway).

So, in short there are three solutions:
a. remove the 'make install on kpathsea from the make extras'. This is a 
dirty fix, because the original problem is still there, but it enables 
me to circumvent it more easily.
b. make sure 'make install' in kpathsea produces a library with a table 
of contents of a later date than the file modification date, either by 
running another ranlib or by using /usr/bin/install -c.

Maybe the latter one is easiest. When
	/usr/bin/install -p -c
is used on Mac OS X (this can be a generic setting) it should all work 
out.

Definitely not. Should I choose any scheme and ask to change the
package selection :
* if tex-context is selected, then tex-etex too
* if tex-context is not selected and I select it, then tex-etex becomes
selected too ...

Daniel, what do you mean exactly ? Any log file to send me ?

This has nothing to do with schemes: I have no log file, 
but to demonstrate the bug, just do this:
add the context collection to the basic selection and nothing else.
Run the installation, at the end the context formats cannot be built
because etex is not installed (context formats rely on pdfetex)

A syntax fault in the .tpm file maybe? my understanding of RDF is too low
to know :-( the tex-context.tpm file seems to require tex-etex, but
the etex collection fails to be installed.

Btw: kind of the same problem occurs with the aeguill package that 
requires (see aeguill.tpm) plfonts, which are not installed actually.

I'm puzzled, I just did it and it is working ok. Cont-* formats have
been rebuild.

By the recent image I mean the one which served as the basis for the
beta CD distributed at BachoTeX.

Also there has been significant improved, the font-locking still does
not work in LateX mode, probably because some AUC TeX compilation
problem (the simplest workaround is to remove *.elc files).

I understand Sebastian solved already this problem for TEI-Emacs, so
please include his fix on TL7.

Was it with 21.2 version ? I'm using it right now and font-locking
seems ok.

(emacs-version)
"GNU Emacs 21.2.1 (i386-msvc-nt5.1.2600)
 of 2002-03-27 on NEVERYON"

I have also upgraded AUC-TeX to version 11.11, which can make a
difference, and I don't think you had this version in BachoTeX.
It is on the latest iso image.

I am not sure what I did, thats the problem. I'll see if I can take
apart the TL setup and replicate my TEI setup

Unfortunately I am not able to test the latest image before Thursday.

Subject: [tex-live] After EuroBachoTeX
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205060829490.21167-100000@chronos.ipipan.gda.pl>

I'd like to clean up all that mess concerning the EuroBachoTeX release.
As I wrote before, it was considered as very beta, so thanks to Martin
(and, of course, Sebastian and Fabrice, as they participated perfectly
on-line ;-) I produced only 12 copies containg (compared to the iso
from 20020427):
1. corrected tex-langczechslovak.tpm
2. changed install-cd.sh
3. changed startup scripts for NTEmacs

That's all. As we have iso from 20020504, which contains the above
changes (and some more), all references to 20020427 can be forgotten.
The iso image `release' should be removed.
The experience from Bachotek was really important, believe me.

The main problem discussed here was: how to keep track on changes
in the main documentation (live.tex) for translations to other
languages. As for me, I always try to check the original file on
http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/Build/cdbuid/tldocsource/english/
but it is annoying, so I'd propose to inform about any change to the
members of that mailing list. Unfortunatelly, not all people making
translations read that list!
For those having access to tug I can provide the old live.tex
as it was on 2001.07.16, see /home/staw/live1607.tex (on request
I can send it directly). I hope that comparing it against the current
live.tex can help.

The other problem is that for many packages we have empty description
fields in tpm files. Last year I filled up ~30 descriptions, but it seems
to be so heavy to my poor English ;-) I found one volunteer who started
working with on `A' alphabetically. As I can imagine, such missing
descriptions should go first to Graham Williams (Catalogue), then
parsed to tpm files. Any idea and help would be welcome. I hope that
after filling such missing descriptions we can have at least an index
what is on the TL CD.

One idea was to have a web page with a list of packages lacking
descriptions and a form/submission address for new descriptions
on it to allow volunteers (which exist) to add the _missing_
descriptions.

Perhaps you have switched also RefTeX on? It should be, and it was not
enabled on the Bachotek image.

I will look at it as soon as possible.

If anyone is feeling strong and helpful, they could

correct for TeX Live. this is not a trivial matter!

it would be easy enough to list the places where the

A year ago, I altered slightly texdoctk and revised the data 
for use at our site.

The alterations included removal of 'Non-standard document styles'
and addition of four categories: 
 - Slides (prosper, seminar, two-up print)
 - TeX on the Web (for packages and converters - not quite finished)
 - Extended TeX projects (latex3, e-tex, omega)
 - ConTeXt

Perhaps we could take this version as a start point?

Sorry, but you really need to specify exactly what is broken, and what needs
to be fixed. I have no idea what "work as they should" means in this context:-}

I haven't yet had a look at the TeXLive7-2. Are the two images to
be considered as two independent CDs, with binary sets being the 
only difference? Or can the second image be regarded as a supplement
providing extra binaries and extra space for the documentation?

Hi,

my question concerning the 7th May release: is the English documentation
uptodate? Can I use it as base for the German version?

Concerning CD production: I talked to Lehmanns yesterday about TeXLive 7.
Chr. Kaeder decided to produce a CD set with two CDs in a digifile package
(= cardboard box). Costs for the user groups max 1.50 Euro per set. Definite
prices mid of next week.

Unfortunately, not yet for the windows part. I changed things in
TeXLive.exe and TeXSetup.exe . I expect to work on documentation
starting this evening.

As far as I could see, most changes are related to the obsolete 
'styles' directory. I've had these. However, porting my data in 
texdoc-local.dat to TeXLive will need some parsing, to ensure 
that only the docs from the Master tree are used (I tend to add 
lots of documentation to texmf-local) .

Btw, the texdoctk manual page says:

  The documentation is grouped into 17  categories;  the  18th
  button of the main panel is inactive by default.

while my version has 21 categories, all active. Is this a problem?

if you have good docs in texmf-local, why dont we have them on TL?

Subject: [tex-live] texdoctk, win32
Message-ID: <znzbimtf.fsf@supelec.fr>

I have spent a few time trying to make it work cleanly under
windows. My point is that the new autorun app (TeXLive.exe) will let
users run texdoctk even before installing something.

Currently :
- texdoctk can run windvi to view dvi files
- texdoctk can launch .ps or .pdf files through their associatied applications
- configuration parameters are fixed for win32
- I _could_ let people print files though associations if the
application is smart enough to do it (e.g. : windvi is flakey in this
area) but does it mean something to allow people to print documents directly 
from texdoctk under windows, because any windows app will let the user
do it if that's what he wants? My point is that it would be safer to
forbid 'print' under windows.
- many files referenced in the .dat db are not found, others are in
dvi format where we have pdf or ps ones, so how to build
(automatically ?) a .dat file for the texlive ?
- many .ps files are in fact .ps.gz files and might need to be uncompressed
(does gswin32 handles compressed files ?). Also there is the problem
that gsview is not free and it not so easy to view .ps files under
windows. 
- I wonder if it could be easy to mark files (with an icon ?)
depending on their format, so that the user knows before clicking what
kind of file he is trying to display, even disabling them if the
viewer is not available.

What do you think ? Any input is welcome,

MacOSX subsection is also missing (at least 2-3 paragraphs, I guess).
On EuroBachoTeX we failed to install on macs not reading README.MAC
and using special /MacOSX/ stuff ;-)

Moreover we need a new screenshot for figure 4. (``Welcome to TeXLive''
window). Volker, you can have uptodate other things waiting for win
and mac sections updates. I'd again suggest keeping older versions
as reference of chanches, OK?
What about Slovak and Russian?

TL7 from 20020507.
When installing context collection, but *not* installing, e.g.,
german, czechslovak and dutch, I have broken formats on win32.
I think making cont-de cont-nl and cont-cs cont-uk should be ignored
because of missing hyphenation patterns.

After corrections in fmtutil.cnf I have good cont-en.efmt.

Running simple example `con-en d-en-002.tex' uses so many swap memory
not making it free immediatelly. The worse thing when
`texexec[.exe] d-en-002.tex'. Can somebody check it on, e.g., notebook
without many free gigabytes on disk?

Hans, any news in context for me?

All the best,

I said 'lots' :-) Most of it we do have on TL. I guess docs in 
texmf-local can be (roughly) divided into 3 categories:
- important updates and new packages from CTAN since TL6. these are on 
TL7 already.
- documentation produced from .dtx files, for packages which are not
documented otherwise. this could, in principle, go to TL, provided
there is free space and enough time.
- licensed local stuff, which can't be distributed.

 > I have never used texdoctk before today :-}

I think texdoctk is a very nice tool. For example, if one runs texdoc 
to look for, say, wonderful 'Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List', not much 
is found. texdoctk, however - when properly initialized - will display
symbols-a4.pdf or symbols-letter.pdf.

I looked at the makeimage script (for making the CD images)

that install-cd-1.sh is used for making both CD-1 and CD-2.
Isn't it a bug?

Using TL 6 on WinXP the *.pfb files for the pazo fonts (fplmr, ...,
fplmbb) are notwhere to be found on my CD (I've just downdoaded them from
CTAN and I'm going to test them when I get home).

I would just like to know is this have been fixed in TL 7? The *.tfm and
*.vf files are there but not the *.pfb (that are needed in the psfonts.map
file).

In this way dvips have no chance to actually use the Mathpazo font.

Or am I wrong about something

Message-ID: <874rhhi6hf.fsf@mimuw.edu.pl>

I like very much the new look of Windows installer, but it does not
work for me :-(.

Experiment 1:

I choose <Explore CD-Rom> <Run TeX off CD-Rom>. A window for opening
files pops up pointing to "Program Files"; when I cancel it, I get the
message "You need to state what editor you want use". Now I am in a loop
with no way out except killing the installer with task manager.

Anyway, the situation is confusing and the message
misleading. Something like "Please point to the location of your
favourite editor" seems better.

Experiment 2:

I choose <Explore CD-Rom> <Browse CD-Rom> and nothing happens.

Experiment 3:

I choose <Documentation> <Run TeXDocTK>. A window opens for a fraction
of second.

Experiment 4:

I choose <Install> <Editors> <ntemacs>. I get the message

        Unable to run this process:
        E:\bin\win32\TeXSetup --quick --add-package=ntemacs

The experiments has been made on Polish Windows 2000.

BTW, the AUC TeX on this image is still 10.0g.

Best regards

Janusz

The latest version can be always found on tug:

As Sebastian wrote, deadline would be on May, 19. :(
I wonder if that deadline can be still acceptable, since I see many

no!
Production will start when the CD is ready (with decent documentation).
Yesterday I got the prices from Lehmanns:
    2 CD set in digifile package
       1.50 Euro + VAT and shipping for Euro zone countries
       1.40 $ for non Euro zone countries

I don't know. Having in mind last years stepwise refinement of documentation
it took longer than one week. At least, we (DANTE) are not under presure of
producing the CDs immediatelly for distribution. Anyone is??

We've been given a price of $1.14 for a 2 CD set (inserted in to a dual CD 
paper window ~ not a digifile).

We are not under pressure to produce the CD's *immediately*

I let you know when everything will stabilized. The new look required
a few changes inside texsetup.exe. I have posted the programs mainly
for one reason : if I withdraw them, Sebastian will get back the disk
space to put something else ;-) (just joking).

I just finished grabbing texlive7-1-20020508.iso.bz2 for a look.

This first thing I noticed is that, when mounted on a rockridge aware
os, several of the files which should not be +x are.  Most of the
russian readme and html files in the root directory, all of the
regular files under Books/lgc, etc.

Try a:

        find $MOUNT_POINT -type f -perm +111 -ls

Those files should be audited to ensure only executabes and scripts
are +x.

If desired, I can send a list of those that need to loose their
execute bits or, if prefered, those that should retain theirs.

you are right, I am shocked at how many files there are with
spurious +x

I have run a job to zap the ones which are clearly at fault.

I tried to run TL7 under Linux directly from the 20020508 CD image on
a computer which was incidentally missing ghostscript. It appears that
without separately installed ghostscript, and gsftopk in particular,
TL7 is almost unusable. Is it intentional?

If you install cm-super, this must of course happen. Under the
new scheme, the cm-super names wont appear in the font map
unless cm-super is installed.

I don't see any way around this.

We should be looking at closing TeX Live very soon. New images
for 2002/05/13 are building now, and I invite to look for their
favourite problem and see if it is solved.

One thing that is *not* working under Unix/Linux is the
implementation of installation schemes. I should get this
working tomorrow. You'll see it there on the menus, but it has
no effect.

As I see, we have nice finish, except of up-to-date documentation
and (one?) problem already mentioned by someone on that list: there
are many stations with Linux RH 6.x and Xdvi cannot run on such systems
because of missing shared libraries: libXaw.so.7
Cannot be cured like pdfTeX, etc. ??

Let's look at the libraries that xdvi uses on a SuSE 7.2 system:

$ ldd /usr/local/bin/xdvi.bin 
        libXaw.so.7 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.7 (0x4001e000)
        libXmu.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXmu.so.6 (0x40075000)
        libXt.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.so.6 (0x4008c000)
        libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6 (0x400da000)
        libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6 (0x400e4000)
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x400fc000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x401de000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x401fd000)
        libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6 (0x4031a000)
        libXpm.so.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4 (0x40328000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

I think that every lib except that libXaw.so.7 exists even on RH 4.2.
So, yes, I think that linking libXaw statically would dramatically
improve the portability of the binary.

Still, I don't think that this should be automated via configure /
Makefile. Some handish linking should do. One needs, however, to have
a static version of that library (i.e. libXaw.a). I don't have it on my
system... :-(

Sorry, this is too technical for me.

I am now totally confused what is supposed to work `live' directly

ah, in that case you get *all* the packages, which includes cm-super.
That package includes Type1 versions of the EC fonts, so it tries
to use GS. I need to see how to force PK bitmaps

I am glad to say that the Unix/Linux installer now
follows the "installation schemes" already in use by the
Windows installer. You can choose from 6 schemes, which
are defined in terms of a set of collections and packages.
The collection list (but not the package list) can then
be customized as before.

I hope it works. revised CD images shortly, after some other cleanups

Well, (a current version of) Xdvi shouldn't generate bitmaps for
Type1 fonts in the first place; If configured correctly, it
should be able use the .pfb files directly, and generate PK fonts
only as a fallback.

To debug this, check the output of
   xdvi -debug 65536 file.dvi
for lines like
   T1 version of font xyz not found, trying pk

As for correct configuration - I don't know how this is set up in
TeXLive, but in teTeX-beta xdvi.cfg contains the line:

dvipsmap ps2pk.map

and ps2pk.map lists the existing .pfbs.

Best,
Stefan

it looks like xdvi on TL7 has a more complex xdvi.cfg.

this may be a mess. I never use xdvi, so I seldom
catch these things,

can anyone volunteer to test a variety of things with xdvi
and tell me how to proceed? preferably before tomorrow

FWIW, here's the full xdvi.cfg from teTeX-beta as a starting point:

---------- xdvi.cfg begin
% Comments may only start in the first column in xdvi cfg files.
%
% Nicolai Langfeldt 2001.6.5
% Changes by Thomas Esser for teTeX, Sat Nov  3 23:33:54 CET 2001.

% Here we enumerate all the encodings we want xdvi to recognize as 
% an "implied" encoding.  Which means that ptmr8r will be recognized as
% ptmr 8r encoded and ptmr8y is ptmr encoded with 8y.  If the font file
% we want to 8r encode is named ptmr8a then we need a map file entry.

% NOTE: the enc files used by xdvi, like the .map files can be much
% like the ones dvips uses (this is new, the syntax used to be
% restricted, this is also why there is no .enc files enclosed in the
% xdvik distribution anymore).  xdvi _cannot_ really parse postscript
% though, so % the vectors must under no circumstances need postscript
% execution.

%       Postfix Encoding name           Defined by this file
enc     8r      TeXBase1Encoding        8r.enc
enc     8c      CorkEncoding            cork.enc
enc     8y      TeXnANSIEncoding        texnansi.enc

% ps2pk as well as xdvik has no "build-in" fonts. We can reuse the map file.
dvipsmap ps2pk.map
---------- xdvi.cfg end

the problem is that TeXLive is too configurable. there are 75 separate
packages which have map files, and these are added to pdftex.cfg and config.ps
at install time. I don't have the expertise to work out what
xdvi wants as equivalent - can I just add lines of the form
 dvipsmap musixtex.map
when, eg, musixtex is installed?

AFAIK that ought to work (but someone please try - I don't have
TeXLive available at the moment), given that the following
conditions hould:

- the encodings used need to be listed in the xdvi.cfg file as well

- the .enc files should contain only simple encoding vectors,
  no advanced Postscript stuff (most .enc files seem to satisfy
  this - but I think you're the expert on this ;). Xdvi will
  exit(1) if the t1lib function used to parse the encoding
  file fails (it ought to fall back on PK, but this can't be fixed
  right now).

- the .map files should contain references to .pfbs, i.e. all lines
  should end with something like:
     <xyz.pfb
  (but it's not fatal if some lines don't, it will fall back on
  a PK version of that font in this case)

Best,
Stefan

I think that mktexpk can (and should) be changed to create PKs from
METAFONT files when the MF font exists.

Currently, mktexpk seems to first check for:

  gsftopk or ps2pk
  ttf2pk
  hbf2gf
  (if the map files contain that font)

and only as a last resort it runs METAFONT.

Thomas, is there any rationale not to change the default to try to
call METAFONT from mktexpk first (i.e. check for the presence of
file.mf first), and only call gsftopk, ps2pk, ttf2pk, hbf2gf if there
is no MF file?

I think that in case there are both MF and PFB (or TTF) files, the MF
files are the primary source, and PFBs (TTFs) were generated from
them, so calling METAFONT to create PK files will be better.

Best,
v.

Well, the easiest fix is propably to set up gsftopk to avoid the
cm+friends fonts. Just set up a config.gsftopk which is like
  p /dev/null
  p +/first/file.map
  p +/other/fileB.map

The documentation says that gsftopk supports the same map file entries as
"dvips -Pgsftopk", but fortunately(!?) this is not the case.

Unlike dvips, gsftopk forgets all map entries when it encounters a
"p file" entry in a config file.

Sure. This will be handled by the configuration which is output by updmap
in teTeX...

i think fixing mktexpk is more general (does not rely that map files
are correctly generated by updmap, and always prefers to produce PK
files from MF when possible), and is very easy as well:

if kpsewhich $NAME.mf >/dev/null 2>&1 || mktexmf $NAME >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  [move here the section which calls METAFONT]
fi

[sections which call gsftopk, ps2pk, ttf2pk, hbf2gf]

Number 1 was in February 2000, so we are running at

Hi,
I've quickly finished updating the German documentation.

Due to the new "Scheme selection Page" I've introduced
a new graphic (actually two: scheme-selection and tpu-progress,
because I didn't want to rearrange everything).

So now I got several file:
     examples.zip with the new and updated .eps files
     graphics.zip with the new and updated .gif/.jpg/.png files
     live-de.zip with the new German version of live.tex
Where should I send it to??

Attached I have some remarks/questions on the English version.
Regards,
     Volker

Now building. It contains the new release of ConTeXt,
so anyone who uses ConTeXt is urged to test it and report
any problems immediately.

The handling of map files, discussed on the pdftex
list recently, will change at some point to conform with teTeX,
but it should broadly work as set up now.

I am off for 24 hours, so don't ask me to make any last minute fixes!

another, final, release on Sunday, I hope.

Nothing in your version,  I intend to   enable installation of  remote
win32 support packages only with a recent  version of IE. Depending on
it, AutoDial will occur  if  no connection  is reported and  the menus
item will be enabled.

Thanks everybody for the doc !

Anybody interested in windows can try the whole suite now. I do not
claim for extensive tests yet, but here is a rough account of the
latest changes:

- kpathsea has been modified to allow for redirection of stderr to
stdout, could be handy for win users. Just set KPATHSEA_DEBUG_OUTPUT
to 'con:'. Also the redirection has been fixed and nested process can
write in the same file (previously resulted in garbage).
- kpathsea shares all its hash tables in memory and no program is
using the standard system()/popen() C calls, but instead a rewrite of
them bypassing the usage of the command interpretor whenever possible.
- TeXSetup.exe: should allow to install even for normal user, but only
in a location where it has rights to do so. Still untested. Privileges
required to install site-wide have been lowered to 'power users' for
NT and above. Installation has been tested against W98.
Config files using .map files lines are edited automatically.
- TeXLive.exe: has its final shape, except that the toggling of
'Internet Access' menu should result in checking for an Internet
connection (left blank for the moment).

Yes, it works, but this circumvents the problem instead of solving
it. Please note the kpsewhich output:

bash-2.05$ kpsewhich --show-path=bib
.:/home/jsbien/texmf/bibtex/bib//:!!/var/tmp/tl7/texmf-var/bibtex/bib//:/texlive-cd/texmf-local/bibtex/bib//:!!/texlive-cd/texmf/bibtex/bib//:/home/jsbien/texmf/bibtex///:!!/var/tmp/tl7/texmf-var/bibtex///:/texlive-cd/texmf-local/bibtex///:!!/texlive-cd/texmf/bibtex///


/home/jsbien/texmf/bibtex/bib is not (and shouldn't be) preceded by
exclamation marks, so it should be searched without the use of the
hash table.

Correction: with support for the French language by Hans Hagen!
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I have not written a single line of code, just told Hans what
is needed for French  and did some testing on Hans' code 
(You know, Sebastian, those bloody « guillemets » you joked about 
at EuroTeX'98 in Saint-Malo, and many other « French specials » ;-)

I have noticed a (last) weird problem when testing. Hope to understand
it better today (spending my day on it if necessary) so 
ConTeXt should be ready before the end of the week,
fingers crossed...

Fabrice is updating the French documentation for Windows, he will
push the file to me, to proof-read it and add what is to be updated for
Unix. This too should be ready by the end of this week.

Yes, some package (ttf2pk ???) needs it and both versions are incompatible.

These are missing in Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/englisch/examples;
a make pdf in Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/deutsch fails. But they

tex-live.sty still uses aett instead of cmtt when producing pdf
which would allow the use of cm-super. Is this intended? The pdfs
become larger (800k -> 964k for german), though.

I just sent the zip files with "graphics/*.jpg,*.png" and "examples/*.eps",
paths according to my tex-sources to Sebastian. I didn't check where he 
unpacked it to (it was well after 0:00).

no special reason. Vladimir has updated freetype in the source
development tree, but I don't want to fly with that for the
release of TL 7. as soon as this May release is out of the way,
and Thanh approves Martin S's pdftex changes, we can switch to
a new source

Unless my memory is deeply flawed, TeX Live 6 carried version 
1.23? and this is the first time anyone has mentioned the problem!

with respect, I suggest that using Omega for mission-critical

Omega has always been unstable and experimental, hasn't it?

reverting to 1.15 is *hard* for me. it would mean mismatches
in which binary sets have Omega, I'd have to rejig the source
and I would *very likely* screw up.

If someone else wants to take responsibility to putting TeX Live
back to 1.15, that's fine by me, but I do not have the time to do
it myself.

Sorry to be negative, but waiting until the very day I want to finish
TeX Live to bring up a problem which has been there for 6 months
is not very sensible.

We have 5 choices
 1 someone else takes on the task of putting TL back to 1.15
   and does all the necessary work in Perforce.
 2 we delay TL indefinitely until I find any time to work on it
 3 we remove Omega from TL entirely
 4 we delay TL until Omega 2
 5 we say "sorry" and dont change anything

what do people request? I will be bound by the decision of the
majority of people who vote in the next 2 days

option
 6 Sebastian retrofits 1.15 onto TL7 tonight
is NOT up for choice!

Unfortunately your memory *is* deeply flawed (but only in this instance, of
course). TeXLive 6 carried version 1.15.

I have compiled TeXLive 6b on a Solaris x86 box and here is what I get:

And so is pdfTeX, e-TeX, and so on, but that's not the point, right?

Since it is not easy to find people to do the hard work this is
a reasonable option for the moment...

As Fabrice has noted, freetype2 is not compatible with freetype1
(it lacks support for GSUP and GPOS)

freetype1 is needed for ttf2pk (and ttf2pfb).

so for the time being we do need to have freetype1...

nothing else in texlive source needs freetype (xpdf does, but only
when it is used to display glyphs, but we use xpdf library for pdftex)

Best,
v.

eh ... etex was always tested pretty well before being published, and 
pdftex was never that unstable, actually, pdfetex (watch the e) is a pretty 
stable replacement of tex today; far more important: bugs in pdftex were 
fixed pretty fast and even more important: versins that went on tex live 
(or on sites) were really torture tested.

so, as a learning experience: how come that 1.23 ended up on public servers 
and in distributions; i think that future omega releases should have beta 
versions alongside less-beta versions

and, curious, what happened to version 1.16-1.22?

an option, only if you want to rebuild the image; instead of omega binaries 
on texlive, there could be a small substitute binary (or readme) telling 
the user where to fetch a binary; this would permit john cum suis to set up 
a web place with all relevant versions

rather valid option, since the omega community is small and organized 
enough to

i vote for 3 with a binary that displays a message "fetch the latest 
version from www.somewhere.org"

(an alternative is to put the old tl6 binaries there, would probably work 
ok for windows)

also, i can understand that you prefer 5

TeXLive6 carried 1.15. 

Also, This is _not_ the first time this has been mentioned. I specifically and publically asked John about this
http://omega.cse.unsw.edu.au/pipermail/omega/2002-January/000047.html
on behalf of all packagers back in January and John  was quite specific:

"But this [1.23] is not a stable version" I thought then that everyone got the hint and would stick with 1.15 till 1.25 was out. Boy was I wrong...

>with respect, I suggest that using Omega for mission-critical
>work is a very dangerous game to play....

1.15 works quite reasonably, was released to stabilize the 1.1x series, and for what I need to get done it's the only game in town...

>Sorry to be negative, but waiting until the very day I want to finish
>TeX Live to bring up a problem which has been there for 6 months
>is not very sensible.

As I said, TeXLive6 has 1.15, and how r we supposed to know that TeXLive7 was going to carry 1.23??? I found out almost by accident (Hans installed it from the 
latest fptex binaries and reported problems to me).

>We have 5 choices

What about
6. Revert to the TeXLive6 version. This is my vote. I truly hope everyone will agree and vote for this:-)

I most truly and sincerely apologize to Sebastian for any trouble in this matter.

Best wishes
Idris

John also said "currently the official version is 1.23 ". clearly
you read that differently to me! I took as a license to distribute
1.23, you took it as "stick with 1.15".

you know more about this than me, I can see :-}

and no-one is forcing you to upgrade. if you don't want Omega 1.23 from
TL7, don't install it! its very easy to deselect it.

agreed, you couldnt.

> 6. Revert to the TeXLive6 version. This is my vote. 
> I truly hope everyone will agree and vote for this:-)

um, you miss the point. yes, revert to the TL6 version, but its not
as simple as reverting one binary. I have to do it for all
architectures, and some architectures don't have 1.15 binaries. I have
to revert the source tree too, and then we have to check that the
architectures all still compile. I do NOT want to have binaries on the
CD which are not built from the source on the CD!

then there are the fixes to dvips made since last year - do we
distribute an odvips without them? ditto oxdvik. and we have to look
at the Omega font programs. and support files, to check they are
the same.

yes, all these things are trivial to do, but it's not something
one wants to hurry, in case it screws up more important things
in some way. 

I entirely take the point that it was probably me who screwed up
in reading John's mail in January as meaning that I should use 1.23.

How about someone installs all the binaries and support files for 1.15
from TL6 on the Omega web site, so that anyone can download them?

etex is an odd thing, which was *heavily* tested, and is not
remotely unstable. 

pdftex was stabilized and developed by peer group pressure and work,
in a way that I think we all hope Omega will be. but the two are
at very different stages in their development cycle, so far as I can
see. apart from anything else, John does not claim backward
compatibility or stability in the way that the others do (and quite
right too, IMHO. John should not be pressurized into stability).

we have an English saying about "the tail wagging the dog". to
delay the release of the CD because of Omega would be fairly
odd. maybe when your book comes out, people will start looking at it,
but are there seriously more than a dozen people making any use of it?
many many thousands of people *have* it, of course, and many many
people *want* it to succeed, but can anyone apart from Apostolos,
Idris and Gregg claim to use in "production"? maybe Yannis does?

I have used it in production and I have helped at least 2 other people in
not on this list use it for production, but am currently discouraged with
its status and am not using it for real work at the minute.

I don't mind 1.23 being on the CD though since I'm planning to keep my 1.15
installation until I see from this list that it is stable, has easier ways
to use my TrueType fonts and hopefully has more pdftex features.

But that's what we are actually trying to do: to make people aware of
Omega and its capabilities. And of course people that use English or
any other language that uses the  Latin alphabet are quite happy with
TeX but we  (the majority?) who do not use the Latin alphabet
we are not so happy with TeX. Try to type Cherokee, Greek and Russian
with TeX and you will see what I mean. So we want to encourage the
non-english speaking people to adopt a real solution to their
multilingual typesetting business.

But if they don't try it or don't learn its features, how on earth it will
ever succeed?

I think I see a moral here - people should keep their copy

yes, its a worthy aim. but does it help or hinder its 
takeup if you encourage people to use in production what is
really an alpha-state bit of research software?

Omega isn't a real solution yet, is it?

It will succeed when someone picks it up and "sells" it; maybe your
book will be the catalyst. TeX Live 7 won't be, I know that much.
What you need to do is a put a reliable version on the CD in the back
of your book. Is that possible? Can we make a special TL for your book?

Not really but they should use it for a number of ordinary tasks

Well, I never use Microcraps:-) But it is true that many Greeks to
use them and I am actually struggling to convince them to learn to
use TeX and Omega. But it is a rather encouraging fact that after
I published my first book on LaTeX in Greek a substantial number of
books have been typeset with LaTeX and even the Bulletin of the Greek
Mathematical Society is being typeset with LaTeX.

Well, it is a solution. At least two books here in Greece have been typeset
with Omega. That Omega needs improvement is another fact and indeed
Yannis in his foreword to our book writes about such improvements.

One reviewer of our book actually suggested this idea and the publisher
was in favor of it. So we can really go on with the idea once I will
get the okay from the publisher.

several books have been typeset with PassiveTeX, but I don't

in that case, doesn't this solve our problem? TL7 can go ahead with the
unstable, but current, Omega, as it always has; separately, we get
a CD into your book with a variant TL containing an Omega which
is guarenteed to run all the examples in the book.

Which version of Omega do you use to write the book?

You are even not allowed to as Omega is GPL and so you have to
distribute the _right_ source along with it (or offer it...).

Strangely, I had the same feeling as Sebastian had.
But it is true that 1.23 occured on 24/10/2001 in the TL source tree,
so after EuroTeX2001 in Kerkrade.

Again about documentation...
How can we clean the mess in tldocsource/ with pictures/ going
to CD/texmf/doc/tldoc/ (used only by html) and local ./examples
used only for making pdf docs + ready made html (text files)?
I think that after moving .eps files from pictures/ to the local
(working) ./examples would fried some mb of CD space.
Moreover tug.org/.../tldosource/pictures/ doesn't contain the same
files as Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/ .
I found, e.g., that texmf/doc/tldoc/deutch/ contains now ~1.6mb of gif 
files... It is just wasting of CD ROM space as we all can live with
German (or Polish :) buttons displayed. After all changes made by 
Fabrice, some screenshots should be changed anyway. Any volunteers?

Some notes about MacOSX would be also welcome in tldoc, I think. 
I've never used Mac (exept failed try to install TL on Kaveh's Mac
at EuroBachoTeX ;-)

Looking for "omega win32" on 
http://www.alltheweb.com/
I got 49 answers about fptex/standalone/omega-1.15-win32.zip .

Thes binaries should work on windows independently of any other tex
related dll or whatever.

Subject: [tex-live] Err in tldoc-english.tpm and missing url.sty in basic scheme
Message-ID: <3CE37EE1.903.1B6654@localhost>

Hi all,

I installed from image 20020515 on Win98 the basic scheme
without any additional packages. I obtained the following error message:

"L:\texmf\tpm\packages/tldoc-english.tpm:4:3 not well-formed 
(invalid token)"

However the instalation continued. 

Then I and tried pdflatex with \usepackage[pdftex]{hyperref}.
I obtained error message:  file "url.sty" not found.

The package hyperref (in collection tex-latex) contains 
\RequirePackage{url}.  The file url.sty is contained in package ltxmisc
which is a part of collection tex-latexextra, but it is not installed in 
basic scheme. IMHO the same oroblem may appear on UNIXes.

I understand that it may be difficult to make the basic scheme such that 
it does not call anything from outside. On the other hand, for average 
user it is difficult to find what package contains the missing file.

I see two solutions: either add package ltxmisc to the basic collection
or move url.sty from ltxmisc to some package in collection tex-latex.

Best regards

I fixed this at least once on the p4 server. But your image might be
older.

Thanks for the report. And yes, it is very difficult to track
dependencies between packages...

Yes. At least John asks for a paper describing the virtue of
generating pdf in one pass (i.e. pdfTeX) against two passes (i.e.
TeX -> dvipdfm). I will do that one day (the paper).

I produced new pictures for each screen and send them to Sebastian.
My set consisted of 
   examples/*.eps      14.278.241 bytes
   graphics/*.gif         621,130 bytes
   graphics/*.jpg         417.076 bytes
   graphics/*.gif         748.442 bytes
each with 11 objects

For producing my versions of doc I always have to copy all
the file into /english/example, /german/example, /english/graphics, ...

As long as we are using the same screen shots for all (?)
languages, we should change the subdirectory setting to 
save space.

well, if the directory you nominated is not writeable
by the person running the installer, I am stuck.....

even "run off the CD" makes some local directories for maintenance

I have never addressed this properly, I am afraid, and I do
not have a solution. If anyone can fix the shell scripts
to copy all output to a LOG file, please feel free to add
the changes.

You are right, but the question is: why TL7 creates the ls-R file in
/home/jsbien/texmf without my knowledge and against my will? TL6
didn't do this, I think it was a better default.

No such thing there. Will look again.

Aargh ! The makefile copies only .elc files, not .el ones, so:

site-lisp\auctex\tex.el:;; Version: 10.0g
site-lisp\auctex\tex.elc:(defconst AUC-TeX-version "11.11"

Will fix it. But submit only tomorrow (too huge from home).

A few things have changed wrt the support packages. Some of them
like perl, ntemacs, gnu-utils, netpbm will install in "c:\Program
Files" and not under the TeXLive directory (in fact, in a sibling of
the TeXLive directory).

Have a look on tug.org/home/tlprod/Build/cdbuild/tldocsouce/pictures/
(many .eps, .gif, etc. not up-to-date)
and compare with Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/

I'm puzzled, which one to use for building live.pdf|html ?

oh, right, I see. I have made some updates

html links to the one in Master/texmf/doc/tldoc. PDF
pulls it on the spot.

I am afraid I have not been even looking at the results
of these documentation runs.....

I am building a new set of images now, with hopeful fixes
for all the problems I have on my list (eg txfonts, skhyph,
install-cd-2.sh). 

The most worrying problem is a report that xdvi crashes on vanilla
recent Redhat Linux systems. Can anyone else confirm this?

As expected, pdf files have current screen shots, but html
versions have old ones ;-}

Oops, to clean all that mess it should be *during* preparation
(.../Build/cdbuild/):

.../tldocsource/pictures/*.gif (or .png, but we'd better stick with
                                just .gif used for html)

*exactly* the same directory should go to Master/texmf/tldoc/
as html files refer to ../pictures/
At the moment we use *only* .gif for html files so .jpg files are just
wasting space on the CD.

.../tldocsource/english/examples/ all .eps, .jpg, *.tex used for
producing pdf version (and .ps if somebody from the team wants it),
as well html version which includes *.tex files verbatim.

.../tldocsource/deutsch (slovak, polish, etc.) have link to
  ../english/examples
which should be converted to the subdirectory
deutsch/examples/ etc. when somebody prepares it on Windows.
That's all.

sorry Sebastian for wasting your time.
That statement was in the German version I got last year, never changed that,
but will now!

     made them all.

I just submitted updated binaries for solaris2.7,
irix6.5 and redhat 7.2. Programs are based on
the current Build/source tree in Perforce server.

Later today I'll submit also an updated database for 
texdoctk. Nothing fancy, but at least all addresses will 
be checked against the documents in the Master tree.

I would like to include faq from uktug in the database.
Where is the faq now in the Master tree? It used to be
in the usergrps directory; cstug, gtf, ntg and tug
are still there, but uktug is gone?

/FAQ/english. can texdoctk see that? if not, we could consider
moving it.

Please consider moving all faqs in FAQ directory under texmf tree.

no, texdoctk uses texmf and texmf-local trees.

texmf/doc/... would be a nice location for all FAQs.

texdoctk database in Master tree is grouped into 17 categories.
I'd suggest 21 categories, so that we'd have, say (do comment!):

   Fundamentals/general references 
   Administration
   Macro programming
   Accessory programs
   Fonts / Metafont
   Languages/national specials
   General layout
   Floating objects/captions
   Graphics
   Slides
   Tables, arrays and lists
   ToC, index and glossary
   Bibliography
   Mathematics                
   Special text elements
   Verbatim and code printing
   Auxiliary tools
   XXXX
   Extended TeX projects
   ConTeXt
   Miscellaneous

There are at least two candidates for XXXX : 'FAQs', for visiblity.
Or 'TeX on the Web' - but what would people want to go there? 
If there are suitable docs, my personal preference would be
'TeX on Web', in which case FAQs could be included in 
'Fundamentals/general references'.

Comments?

Why do you suggest unwriteable directories as defaults? :-)

I set VARTEXMF=/var/tmp/tl7/texmf-var (this seems to be the right
default for an unpriviliged user), but forgot to change TEXMFLOCAL.

The only change I noticed in the image 20020516 is that now I can
leave the loop. Perhaps there is no time now for it, but Explore
CD-Rom -> Choose an editor should have a submenu:
        NT Emacs
        ...
        other

If NT Emacs is not in a path, its installation should be offered to
the user.

Works better, but not fully correct. Almost always I get the message
like this:

Requested documentation not found in a specified place,
check e:\texmf/texdoctk/texdoc-local.dat.
Looking for lshort.dvi elsewhere
in e:\tex,f/doc..

If the file looked for has an ambiguous name, like index.html for
English FAQ, a wrong file is displayed.

I got the message 

not found, cancelling:

for the following files:

essential.dvi
latex2e.dvi
guide.dvi
symbols.dvi
faq.dvi
dante-faw.html

Then I stopped testing.

What about the documentation files, ChangeLog etc.?

Installing NT Emacs in "Program Files" seems to me a step backwards:
what about a non-priviliged user on W2K? If you don't want Emacs Live
on CD, you should provide for him another option.

Last but not least, installation of NT Emacs seems to hang on the call
to addpm.

Hi Sebastian! Hi List!

How do I create my own CD images? I have everything on my linux pc

Thanks a lot for the infos.

here is a the shell script I use to make the CD images.
obviously, check the directory paths. that makes you

Hmm.  That script puts i386-linux in disc 2, but in the 0508 images
i386-linux is in disc 1.  Did you change that for the latest images?

No, -m "./bin/i386-linux" means exclusion from the 2nd CD.

Something I really do not understand there : in _my TeXLive.exe_, here
is what I get :

- Menu Explore CD-Rom
       item Browse CD-Rom (functional)
       item Select a text editor (functional)
       item Run TeX off CD-Rom (disabled)
       item Cleanup CD-Rom (disabled)

There is not any more 'Chose an editor'. Selecting a text-editor
offers a standrad OpenFile dialog box into "c:\Program Files" and
enabling the selection of some .exe file.

If you select an existing .exe file, then the disabled menus are
enabled. You can run TeX. Obviously I have no way to :
- guess if your .exe is actually an editor (should I hardwire the list
of known editors and reject any .exe that does not match ?),
- guess for all of
WinEdt/WinShell/Emacs/XEmacs/PFE/WinTeXShell/... where the user could
have installed them.

_Do you get this kind of behaviour on your cdrom ? If not, there is
something wrong there and we need to find out why._

The user can install any of the support packages from the Install
menu. Some subitems are enabled if the 'Enable Internet access'
subitem has been successfully checked.

Same conclusion here. My opinion : 
- integrate the needed information into the tpm files
- make texdoctk parse them

We will have much more info available this way. The problem is to
maintain this.

Priviliges have been taken into account:
- for power users and administrators (members of), it is offered to
install into "c:\Program Files", the 'install for all users' options
is checked, and menus, file association and so on are made available
to everybody
- if no such privileges are found for the user running TeXSetup.exe,
it is offered to install in "c:\\" (but the user will have to have
write access to this location!) and every menu, file association etc
is made available to himself only.

This one I had in earlier versions, but not recently, neither on XP
nor on W98SE ...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205172130400.25563-100000@chronos.ipipan.gda.pl>

I've again compared what's on www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/:
Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/pictres/  old ones
Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/    the same as aboove, but only 
                                    .gif and .jpg 
Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/english/examples/ contains new updates
 (all graphics files + *.tex files).

Let's see how graphic are used in live.tex:
\begin{figure*}
 \begin{center}
  \ifnum \Status=1
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{examples/Welcome-to-TeXLive}
  \else
    \ifnum \Status=2
\includegraphics[bb=20 20 575 432]{../pictures/Welcome-to-TeXLive.gif}
    \else
        \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{examples/Welcome-to-TeXLive}
    \fi
  \fi
... etc.

So to conclude, in Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/:
1. rm ./pictures/*
2. mv english/examples/*.gif pictures/
3. remove from Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/*
4. copy here .gif files from tldocsource/pictures/
5. texhash

Definitely fixed this time. 

[for the record: addpm is using DDE messages to communicate with the
shell explorer, but DDE messages are disabled while displaying modal
dialog boxes like the ones the TeXSetup wizard are made. So
interblocking between both processes, each one waiting for the
other. ]

I think you must be misreading the script. the -m lines *exclude*
things.

I got texlive7-1-20020515.iso and I tried to install it on MacOSX (10.1.4).

The install-cd.sh script didn't work, seems to exit after

  trap 'cd /; rm -rf $work_dir $TEXDIR/texmf/.tmp_testfile.$$;trap '' 0;

In fact, I finally got the script to work by removing this line...

A better idea ?

I have done some clearing up, and I hope I have it right.
If the wrong versions of some pictures have come out
on top, please forgive me! maybe someone can do a quick check.

the situation as I see it now is as follows

 1. {language}/live.tex should
     reference examples/xxxx.tex for non-graphic stuff
 2. {language}/live.tex should reference
     a) ../pictures/xxx for pdftex mode
     b) ../pictures/xxxx.gif for HTML mode
 3. pictures/* should contain .gif and .png pictures
 4. pictures/*gif should be copied to /texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures
    if they change

EPS files are not needed at all. Use JPEG if you want
but dont chop and change.

does that make sense? german and english versions are
now working in this way. (Martin/Volker, if you are
changing things, take care when you submit or sync so that
we dont lose anything)

Subject: [tex-live] The Plan
Message-ID: <20020518152904.GC958@spqr-dell>

Staszek and Fabrice both urgently suggest to me that we need
to enter endgame with TeX Live 7. I agree, so I propose this plan:

 a) You have 24 hours to make suggestions for change,
     submit last minute package updates, etc, based
     on todays ISO images
 b) tomorrow evening I will make final candidate release ISO images
 c) you have 6 days to test them
 d) next weekend I will review reports and make changes
    which are unequivocally necessary
 e) the images go public on Monday 27th, and TL7 is frozen

Over the coming week, those preparing documentation
should continue to submit material to Perforce, working
in //depot/Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/ as needed. I hope
that Kaja will also put in a revised texdoctk.dat during
the week.

If you find a problem during testing, please don't 
just say "it doesn't work"; if you possibly can, 
send a precise recommendation of what to fix, and exactly how.

I hope everyone is happy to proceed on this basis! Personally,
I think we are doing well with testing this year (especially
Staszek's heroic efforts....), and we look set to deliver
a stable system.

By the way, the question of TL7b came up. Just to put

this year. However, I do intend two Special Editions, for

 a) Apostolos' Omega book, with whatever is need to make
    all his examples run
 b) TUG 2002 in India, probably with some XML tools

any more special requests?

this does not look to me like the same error?
if you run it with -x, can you see exactly which line it is on?

you might prefer to look at MacOSX/TeX-thin.dmg, however.

But I love to see bugfix editions. But that's hard to define, I guess.

I was thinking what some Open Source projects have as an stable branch, 
something like Mozilla's 1.0.x series:

Sure, I could branch off the TeX Live //depot/Master tree.
I am a little reluctant to impose on Dante, mind you, 
to extent of occupying another gigabye of their disk.

the *source* is branched already, of course.

the Open Source people usually have it easy, as they just
deal with source files, and not the HUGE burden of the texmf
tree.....

Well, I had the same error with the old script... In fact when launched, the
script does not detect any platform and I must use the P command to select
one.

If I immediately type I, I obtain (sorry for not pointing that)

Enter command: I
Preparing destination directories... Done preparing.
prepare_dirs: parse error: condition expected: = [42]
[localhost:/Volumes/TeXLive-7-20020515] mbova%


If I select the platform, I get this error when typing C, but mac platform
is actually selected, and the script exits after the prepare_dirs procedure
(except if I remove the trap line from the script).

There are many blank lines in my last mail, but if you go at the end you
will see :

Enter command: I
Preparing destination directories... Done preparing.

TeX Live can be used on multiple systems
as a separate subdirectory is used for each
installed binary package in /usr/TeX/bin.

do you mean install-cd.sh -x ? (sorry like many mac users I am a bit new to
unix)

Yes, of course... But I must present tex distribs on OSX at the next
GUTenberg conference. Of course I will present Gerben's teTeX, and as
Fabrice and Daniel will present tl7 installation on win and linux, I hope be
able to do the same for OSX...

the TeXshop-thin thing is supposed to install TeXlive from the CD. Consult
Gerben about this - he has done lots of work for TeX Live and OSX

ok, I've had these already.

Some of the documentation is unavailable in .dvi, .pdf or .ps format.
I miss documentation for docstrip, inputenc, wasysym, stmaryrd,
babel (from doc/generic/babel), setspace, float and endfloat.
Is there room for adding these? 

Fabrice mentioned documents in .ps.gz format. Unfortunately, texdoctk 
complains about these with 'ERROR gz: not a known document format'. 
Two of these are currently in the .dat file: amsguide.ps.gz and 
epslatex.ps.gz. Maybe uncompress or replace with .dvi or .pdf for TL7?

A list of what I have so far is attached below. Note changed names

  will be binaries for Solaris 2.8 on Intel platform included in the
TL7? It seems
that it's out of both iso-images. Or did I miss something?

We are talking about `Run TeX off CD-ROM' setup, *not* installation
which works well and adds map files. I've tried that several times and
$VARTEXMF/dvips/config/config.ps contains only predefined set
of maps. If I want to try an example using antp, I have to add
p +antp.map by hand (in such situation I found the problem with file
ending).

> anyone can run makeimage who has an account on www.tug.org

Account on www.tug.org is the same as my account on tug.org ?
TeXLive.jpg

so html files still read the *old* Welcome-to-TeXLive.gif :(
.jpg file is not referenced, so obsolete here.

As I wrote, let's do again the previous scheme:
  \ifnum \Status=1 % this is for PDF embeded graphics
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{examples/Welcome-to-TeXLive}
  \else
    \ifnum \Status=2 % this is for HTML
\includegraphics[bb=20 20 575 432]{../pictures/Welcome-to-TeXLive.gif}
    \else            % this is for PS
        \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{examples/Welcome-to-TeXLive}
% etc...

So again to conclude, in Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/:
1. rm ./pictures/*
2. cp english/examples/*.gif pictures/
3. rm /home/tlprod/Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/*
4. copy here .gif files from tldocsource/pictures/
5. texhash

Of course examples/ can contain all intermediate files like .eps, .gif,
etc.

Well, not related to the question of this subject, but related to the
deadline of TL7 production: all mail which was send to me between 1 and 23
hours ago will either be lost, or I'll get them with a few days of delay.

So, if there was something urgent, prease resend. I see that the perforce
tree does not have the latest version of updmap which I send to Sebastian,
yesterday...

In principle, yes, but I think this is a bad idea.
It makes a lot of sense to me to have  *one* version of current/final
TL image on tug.org. Besides, if several people use 'makeimage',  we'll
end up with a confetti  of images in the Images area.
Then there is another problem: even though TUG server provides ample
disk space, the fact is that if all people suddenly decide to make their own
image it will probably crash the server...

There are licensing questions related to the use of .gif images.
May I ask why are we having .gif images on TeXLive CD at all?
Surely .png and .jpg could do the job?

Using gif files are not licensed at all. The rumour was about
programming using LZW, but now it is allowed since some years.
The whole communinity of open source/free programs didn't noticed
that after hot discussion some years ago ;-)

Yes they do, IIRC. BTW, none of the version 4 browsers are supported
anymore by their vendors. Neither Microsoft nor Netscape provide security 
patches for the 4.x series, for example.

But that doesn't invalidate the first argument that they do support PNG.

It works in netscape 4.78, at least, I just tried it.

However, I still think it would be better to use jpg.  Why not?
Then it will definitely be supported by all browsers, including netscape
3, etc.

    Using gif files are not licensed at all. The rumour was about
    programming using LZW, but now it is allowed since some years.

As far as I know Unisys granted an exception for gif files only, and for
strictly noncommercial purposes only.
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html

Has Unisys done something else since?

That does not include "free" software by the definition of the DFSG
which covers a lot of what is on TeX Live.  And TL itself is "sold"
(lawyers could argue) by user groups.

I think it's best to just use jpg and avoid the whole issue.

I have the following message from Polish testers:
uname -a
"Darwin Kernel Version 5.4: Wed Apr 10 09:27:47 PDT 2002; 
root:xnu/xnu-201.19.3.obj~1/RELEASE_PPC  Power Macintosh powerpc"

MacOS 10.1.4, bash (installed from the net) 2.0.5.
but install-cd.sh didn't detected such system (it was 2 weeks ago,
perhaps newer script works better).

As concerned bash, some Macs have already bash, or can take it easilly
from the net.

I've heard about installer TexLive for MacOS X:
ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/volumes/TeX-fat.dmg (+ TeXLive)
ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/volumes/TeX-thin.dmg (only installer)

"shell":
http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/monge/j.laurens/iTeXMac/

To conclude: 
1. at least one paragraph to tldoc would be welcome (Gerben?)
2. readme file located on the CD/ should better explain things 
   concerning MacOSX.

All the best,

I asked to Sebastian to add

    'Power Macintosh':Darwin:*:*)
    echo powerpc_darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}
    exit 0 ;;

in the case statement of config.guess. I think it is done.

I think Sebastian also added the bash executable archive in MACOSX
directory.

TeX-fat.dmg is too... fat for texlive cd...

> ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/volumes/TeX-thin.dmg (only installer)

it is arlready in MACOSX directory. (and seems to be incompatible -- Gerben
do you confirm that? -- with cd install so the user must choose between :

1 install-cd.sh : no need of internet, big texmf tree if needed, darwin5.3
binaries

2 TeX-thin.dmg : download teTeX from Internet, darwin5.4, upgrade ability,
but of course more little texmf tree.

I will submit a readme.mac file explaining that.

Gerben, should it be possible to release 5.4 binaries from TeXlive source ?

> http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/monge/j.laurens/iTeXMac/

A good alternative to TeXshop (already on the cd) But it is 2Mbytes...

The stock config.guess/sub from the net should work fine it contains 
everything for Mac OS X.

darwin 5.3 binaries are the same as darwin 5.4 binaries, they just were 
produced with the same compiler setup on a different os version.

If people install from the CD in /usr/local/teTeX they will be able to 
use i-Installer to update the program side of TeX (not the texmf side) 
safely.

I vehemently disagreee. A Mac user is not your average unix user and has 
a) no idea how to do this and b) has by default *no* compiler on his 
system. TeX Live should work *as is* on Mac OS X *as is*. And there is 
only one script (the recently updated updmap system) that does not work.

Not exactly because your teTeX texmf location is
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.

So 

1 - fmtutil --all won't be run
2 - new pool files (if any) will be placed in
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/web2c/ and had to be transferred in
/usr/local/teTeX/texmf/web2c

well, updating with i-installer remains possible, but is not mac-user
friendly (afaik).

So, updating all config.guess/sub files with the latest version from
the net is a much much smarter solution. One can just use the files from
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/config/

OK. But it will not work as it, I think.

In install-cd.sh there is

platform_guess()
{
  sys=`(cd ${TMP-/tmp}; sh ${OVERRIDE_GUESS-$CDDIR}/config.guess)`
  system=`echo $sys | sed 's/-[^-]*-/-/'`
  case $system in
    powerpc_darwin5*)   usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var
;Sys=powerpc_darwin53;;
    *86-linux*)        usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=i386_linux;;
  esac
  this_system=$Sys
}


So the script expects powerpc_darwin to be echoed by config.guess.

And in gnu/config.guess there is

*:Darwin:*:*)
    echo `uname -p`-apple-darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}
    exit 0 ;;

so powerpc-apple-darwin5.4 will be echoed...

(BTW the binary directory name is powerpc-darwin5.3 also)

Sure, you are right about this.

> In install-cd.sh there is

So, this platform_guess has to be adjusted, too, but that's no big deal.

I really dislike to put some hacky code into config.guess/sub. One always
has to keep that modification in mind and one must never loose it if
updating to a new version from "the net".

Since the official scripts now support darwin, I suggest to use it
and adjust the rest (i.e. install-cd.sh) to comply with it.

I do not understand where this issue comes from. TeX Live has had darwin 
aware config.sub and guess scripts (standard ones even) now for a very 
long time.

I don't find any mention of Darwin in TeXLive-7-20020515/config.guess and
any config.sub file at all...

Seems to be the best solution *provided* the texlive config.guess had mot
been already modified for another platform. Are we sure of that?

Only Sebastian can know... Anyway, I think that TeX Live should switch
to the latest official versions of these scripts, otherwise, they will
become unmaintainable.

I am not sure, however, if this can be done for TeX Live 7.

I suggest to Sebastian to put bash-osx.tar.gz in MACOSX directory. No need
of a compiler.

just launch terminal and type

sudo tar xvzf <path>/bash-osx.tar.gz

and bash will be installed (I know that some mac users dislike terminal, but
in fact, macOSX is not presently usable without terminal, and bash
installation procedure may be easily documented).

Yes, but sh seems to be unable to run the cd-install script. If it is a
zsh-sh emulation problem, it will not be easy to get the script to work
without bash.

You are right. I was mistaken.

I agree with Thomas, though. It is not the best solution to maintain 
your own config.guess/sub.

For most users of my TeX distribution and a front end like TeXShop.app, 
the use of Terminal is completely unnecessary. That is the whole idea 
behind it.

Probably not, so bash binaries could be shipped with the system. Maybe 
even better, I could provide a bash-installer (no need to go to 
Terminal.app at all).

And presently MacOSX platform is recognized (by a non standard config.guess,
yes...)

So you have to convince Sebastian that installing the "net" config.guess,
modifying install-cd.sh and install-pkg.sh, and then testing *all* texlive
platforms recognition is "unequivocally necessary" :-)

Anyway it should be done for next texlive release...

Ooops, I do not understand. I think that it *can* be done for *this* TL.
Just to avoid complaints and many mails from users in disaster.
We have this week for serious checking.
I can only confirm that texlive7-1-20020520 contains in config.guess

    'Power Macintosh':Darwin:*:*)
       echo powerpc_darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}
        exit 0 ;;

  424769 May 19 22:05 bash-2.0.5-osx.tgz

so perhaps everything is OK. But please, do some checking
(especially install-cd.sh).

I think that most important thing to be resolved before the final

I'm afraid that missing libXaw.so.7 can also occur on other not so
enough fresh Linux distributions, like Debian, etc., so any help or hint
would be appreciated urgently.

Find a system with a static version of libXaw, then we can use that
system to build a binary which no longer depends on the shared libXaw.

Hi!

Please build and include shared libraries of libkpathsea into TeX live.

Why?:
$ ldd /usr/bin/ctangle
        libkpathsea.so.3 => not found
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40023000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
$

This is debian 3.0 woody with the ctangle/cweave package. Unfortunately
these packages are build with shared libs of libkpathsea.


Best wishes

I build it here on my debian 3.0 box as follows:
I changed the compile-call from (taken from Thomas change of in pdftex build)
..... -lXaw ....
to
....  -Wl,-Bstatic -lXaw -Wl,-Bdynamic -lXpm ....

(yes, the -lXpm is necessary, otherwise I get a a undef reference in
Xpm.a).
The xdvi.bin size increases from
        xdvi.bin in Master:  742040
to
        xdvi.bin Xaw static: 981492

Please tell me if I should upload this binary to Master/bin/i386-linux?

Yes, I suggest Sebastian to add these lines in texlive config.guess (as in
20020515 release) and he do it. It works at my home...

Everything is OK (from an install point of view...), I hope, except that
installation requires Terminal (but MacOSX is UNIX, is it ?).

The remaining problem is that the most recent "net" config.guess (which is
*not* the texlive one) is able to handle macOSX, *provided* install-cd and
install-pkg were modified (and strongly tested).
What I suggest is that we don't try to use this standard "net" config.guess
immediately.

does this ctangle/cweave package come with debuan, or from TeX Live?
if it comes with debian, then they must provide the libkpathsea.so.3
library, but not TeX Live!

TeX Live is built with static kpathsea, and no programs built with TeX
Live require shared kpathsea.

Yes, no, yes, yes ;-)

Yes this is a debian package.
No it is not from TeXlive (is ctangle/cweave in TeXlive, didn't see it)
Yes they provide libkpathsea.so.3
Yes it is not TeX live.

I deleted all stuff concerning kpathsea.so which is not a good idea
as I see now. I thought I use the texlive stuff everywhere, but alas,
this doesn't work ;-)

Are there any kpathsea-fied cweave/ctangle sources floating around ? I
intended to add them to the TL7 release, and actually I started to add
kpathsea support. However,  I was  not yet happy   enough with what  I
did. So any input welcome.

I am not sure about the abilities of the debian cweb package, but at 
least ctangle and cweave want to load libkpathsea.

If I use xdvi without -not1lib option, the wrong fonts are used for
display. This seems to be the same problem which I reported a year
ago.

I run TL7 on Debian Woody directly from the recent image. I don't know
whether it is relevant, but there is no ghostscript on this computer.

I guess Norbert has already dealt with this, but FWIW, tug.org has
libXaw.a.  I didn't check if it's version 6 or version 7, though.

In general, tug.org should have "everything", that is, all packages that
come with red hat, including static x libraries.

    Another question concerning texinfo:
    Is it really necessary to have automake-1.6 installed? 

I made the texinfo 4.2 distribution with the latest versions of gettext,
automake, and autoconf at the time.  It may or may not be easily
possible to build it with older versions.  I doubt it, since there are
so many interdependencies between them.

    NO packages for automake-1.6.

It's been out for quite a while.

I guess you tried to install in "c:\program files" and you do not have
the rights to do so. I'll check this evening what happens. On a virgin
machine, it should have proposed c:\ if you are a non privileged user,
but you might even not be allowed to write on c:\ .

It is a fact that under W2K/XP, non privileged users are not allowed
to install anything (I can point you to the MS docs stating
this). That does not mean you can't do it, but it is the default
behaviour.

I strongly recommend against this.

Binaries linked against shared libraries somehow need to be told where
the libraries are unless the library is exactly where the build-time
path specifies. Problems:

  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH env. var is a monster that should be avoided whenever
    possible
  - we want that TeX Live can be installed without superuser privileges,
    so we can't either install the libs at standard places nor modify
    some global file like /etc/ld.so.conf

So, a shared libkpathsea is a "no" for the binaries we want to distribute.
Let alone the problems we get when running from CD.

So that's a problem of your debian package, not of TeX Live.

Not too late, only that Sebastian wanted to review any change before

Hmmm... On MacOSX, even IE5 seems not understand png (could somebody

/usergrps/TUG/tmp.23849.57027 was a residue in my local work

.mkisofs should be excluded from the cd then by the building

OK, you are right.

 ie5 displays the png image correctly when I open this url, but if I
download only the image on my hard disk, and try to open it, it ask for a
plug-in...

Sorry, but I don't know how to try them.

I used a brute force approach trying to burn a new CD with the files
replaced, but I cannot create the image:

Using RR_MO000 for  /rr_moved (rr_moved)
Using INSTA000.SH;1 for  /install-pkg.sh (install-cd.sh)
mkisofs: Error: (NULL POINTER) and /home/zasoby/tl7temp/cdrom/rr_moved have the same Rock Ridge name
mkisofs: Unable to sort directory 

This is my call to mkisofs:

mkisofs -o plyta.raw -J -R /home/zasoby/tl7temp/cdrom/

TeXSetup can be run from the hard disk, e.g.:
c:\zzz\texsetup.exe --local-source-directory=e:\
where e: is CD-ROM drive letter, see: texsetup --help

Great! So it can be even installed on other hard disk, I hope.
Many people still keep boot drive (c:) as small as possible because
it is easier to repair it after windows crashes ;-)

Will try TeXSetup you've attached in some while. Thanks,

Easier to work from a fake cdrom, aka some partition on your hd or
network where you have a copy of the cdrom. Possibly use a share with
read only permissions.

Workaround for testing texlive.exe: unpacking the whole CD
on another partition, changing files, etc. (or waiting for the next
.iso ;-)

TeXSetup from May, 22nd works well on win98. Fabrice, thanks for
repairing shell links preparation on w95 and w98.
NTEmacs installs in c:\NTEmacs so I guess that selecting another
directory works only from TeXLive menu, right?

No, it should install in "c:\Program Files\NTEmacs" if your TeXLive
directory is "c:\Program Files\TeXLive".

Can you confirm that c:\NTEmacs is actually a sibling of the directory
where you put TeX (ie: TeX in c:\TeX for example) ??? Else, send me
the log file please.

I'm not fond of making let the user chose the location of Emacs
installation because :
- the default is in "c:\program files', and that is the Windows way
- I will have to handle the unattended mode (--quick) and it is
annoying.

Hope we can live this way,

Feel free to make no impact changes like this. one to one replacements

for stuff like this.

The reason is that the map files are not generated by my updmap script. My
updmap approach assumes everything in one map file for each application
(at least as far as the system-wide configuration is concerned). The map
files should only be known to updmap and not listed in the configuration
of each application (dvips, pdftex, xdvi, gsftopk).

But currently, we have on TeX Live:

In config.ps:
  % A minimal psfonts.map. all others are added at install time
  p psfonts.map
  p +aifonts.map
  p +antp.map
  p +antt.map
  p +ascii.map
  ...

In pdftex.cfg:
  map pdftex.map
  map +aifonts.map
  map +antp.map
  map +antt.map
  map +ascii.map

So, one has to make sure that either ps2pk.map and psfonts_pk.map have
everything that xdvi / gsftopk need or add the additional map files to
  xdvi/xdvi.cfg
and
  dvips/config/config.gsftopk

IMHO, the right thing would be to
  - add all the map "modules" to updmap.cfg (as Map or MixedMap resp.)
  - recreate psfonts.map, pdftex.map, ps2pk.map be running updmap
  - remove all "p" and "p +" lines from config.ps
  - remve all "map +" lines from pdftex.cfg

updmap ? I'll try to finish it this evening.

I don't know what you mean. The map files for the CD can well be generated
by my script (on tug.org or any other unix system). I consider updmap
an important part of teTeX and I don't want to be dependend on perl for

The reason is that the map files are not generated by my updmap script. My
updmap approach assumes everything in one map file for each application
(at least as far as the system-wide configuration is concerned). The map
files should only be known to updmap and not listed in the configuration
of each application (dvips, pdftex, xdvi, gsftopk).

But currently, we have on TeX Live:

In config.ps:
  % A minimal psfonts.map. all others are added at install time
  p psfonts.map
  p +aifonts.map
  p +antp.map
  p +antt.map
  p +ascii.map
  ...

In pdftex.cfg:
  map pdftex.map
  map +aifonts.map
  map +antp.map
  map +antt.map
  map +ascii.map

So, one has to make sure that either ps2pk.map and psfonts_pk.map have
everything that xdvi / gsftopk need or add the additional map files to
  xdvi/xdvi.cfg
and
  dvips/config/config.gsftopk

IMHO, the right thing would be to
  - add all the map "modules" to updmap.cfg (as Map or MixedMap resp.)
  - recreate psfonts.map, pdftex.map, ps2pk.map be running updmap
  - remove all "p" and "p +" lines from config.ps
  - remve all "map +" lines from pdftex.cfg

I mean that TeXSetup could run updmap. That does not mean what you

I won't depend on it either since I have the ActiveState Perl compiler
;-) User will get an updmap.exe .

Yes, but Sebastian (and I) started with the other approach not so long
ago. It is also possible to edit the various config file each time a
new package holding some .map file is installed. However your approach
might be more flexible.

Ah! Good. :-) So you want that perl-thing for windows only. Well,
the minimum is that the installer sets up an updmap.cfg and that
your updmap.exe is able to generate the map files at the end of the
installation.

My updmap script will offer a lot more (e.g. it offers a commandline
interface for everything that can be set in updmap.cnf, including enabling
/ disabling map lines).

Does your reaction mean that we can do what I have proposed, i.e.
creating "big" map files for the CD and altering dvips / pdftex setup?

Who shall do this (me)? Can I update the updmap script in TeX Live (the
existing version has the basic functionality, but not all the goodies
of the new version; plus: the new version works on OS/X)?

If you have no more basic functionality in the new version, then I
think yes we can, because I won't be able to hack much more than the
current version. I'm off up to Firday afternoon.

No, the basic functionality is the same. Still only two config variables
(LW35 and dvipsPreferOutline) and the two variants for map lines Map
and MixedMap.

So, I'll update the script and leave the decision about the rest (changing
map files on CD, altering config of dvips / pdftex) to Sebastian.

1. Good news: I can install now NT Emacs in a chosen location and run
   TL directly from CD. I still think that selecting the editor is
   confusing but that is another matter.

2. When I try to view a *.dvi file, I got the lot of messages of the form

        windvi: special "src:23sample2e.tex" not implemented

3. When copying CD I noticed that the directory

        \texmf\doc\fonts\devanagr\
   contains both `readme' and `Readne'.

I did not like that idea at first, but I finally agree that this is
the right thing to do. I had to rearrange several lines of mktexpk,
but this was a good opportunity to clean up a few details, too.

I append my revised version of mktexpk. It's up to Sebastian to decide
whether or not this can go into TeX Live 7 and up to Olaf's decision
to use it for web2c or not...

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.30.0205222344590.29303-100000@sun2.ruf.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

I have tried the TeX Live image of 2002/05/20.
Version of dvips: 5.86g

Positiv is that now the PostScript fonts are
used with dvips. Then I wanted to test the
automatically pk font generation and used:
  dvips -Ppk -otest.ps test
But here the PostScript font versions of
cm and cm-super are included.
  config.pk: "p psfonts_pk.map" without "+"
  psfonts_pk.map does not include
    the PostScript fonts of cm or cm-super.
What happens? How to get the pk versions of
the fonts?

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek@uni-freiburg.de>

Since all today's discussion concerning xdvi.bin for Linux
went in a smaller group, I'd like to inform that we have new
compilation linked statically on
tug.org/tlprod/Master/bin/i386-linux/ (or Perforce server)
Thomas, thanks for uploading that.

Yet another reason to push the updmap configuration. "p +" map files
cannot be unloaded, so we have to get rid of them in dvips's config.ps.

It will work as soon as dvips loads only psfonts_t1.map or psfonts_pk.map
(and psfonts.map is a symlink to either of them).

Subject: [tex-live] xdvik-22.40i segfaults with large .map files
Message-ID: <200205222226.g4MMQwA14833@www.elexir.de>

Hi,

Daniel Flipo (thanks again) has just detected a malloc bug with
xdvik-22.40i, i.e. the version currently used in TL7, and `large'
.map files (with more than 31 encodings or more than 3071 fonts -
yes, it's an off-by-one-error) that will cause to a segmentation
fault while reading the .map file(s) at startup time, independent
of the current DVI file.

I've just uploaded a patched version xdvik-22.40k to ftp.tug.org
(soon to be mirrored on CTAN:dviware/xdvik/), along with 2 diffs
for 40i/40j and 40j/40k, but I gather that it might be difficult
to build new binaries for all the platforms before the deadline
for TL7 (on Sunday?).  Maybe one of the following alternatives
would be more realistic:

- update only the i386 version

- disable/limit the use of t1 fonts for this version, by not
  adding new fonts to ps2pk map (possibly also by setting the
  xdvi.t1lib X resource to false in some X app-defaults file)

- do nothing, and hope that only few users run into the bug

I guess the second alternative would be easiest to implement,
and cause least hassle for all ... sorry for the really
bad timing with this.

Best,
Stefan

Argh... I think that I could update the source this evening (i.e. in
about 16 hours), provided that other people can rebuild the binary
in time (hey, that's almost 3 days until Sunday, then :-)

We could provide a ps2pk-small.map with the limits and put some
  dvipsmap ps2pk-small.map
into xdvi.cfg together with a comment for the reason.

> - do nothing, and hope that only few users run into the bug

That's too bad, I think.

Are you referring to the thread
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2001-October/001164.html
? To my knowledge, that scaling bug had been fixed in 22.40f;
if it's a different problem, please give more details on
what's going wrong.

No, that shouldn't matter.

OK, it is quite clear now, but who has enough rights removing
all obsolete and missleading files from english/examples/
*except* .tex files still needed and included verbatim ?

Timestamps in examples/ still changes, so I'm again puzzled.
I do not mention unsolved problem: which files from
Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/pictures/
should go to Main/texmf/doc/tlc/pictures/ and then to the CD-ROM.
While comparing 20020520 image and the contents of tldocsouce/pictures,
I got a headache...

Some days ago I proposed the following scheme:
1. all files used during preparation and embeded in .pdf (as well
   as .html, like .tex copied verbatim) can be kept in
   tldocsource/english/examples/
   (links from <language>/ -> ../english/examples/ are enough clear).
2. all files *only* needed for .html files should go to
   tldocsource/pictures/ and then safe and sound mirrored in
   Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/

I'm not so conservative, so after important changes made by Fabrice
(I really appreciate his effort!) I'd like to propose for now:
1. cleaning up tldocsource/english/examples/ *except* .tex files
2. mirroring tldocsource/pictures/ -> Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/
   only *.gif files really needed for .html version which goes to the 
   CD-ROM (which, in fact, are only used *now*) and please, stop that 
   discussion about gif, png or whatever.
   FP>includegraphics commands are in ../pictures/, not in examples/.
   Since pictures/ contains all sort of files (~17mb)
   it is now somehow complicated.

Anyone involved in tldoc preparation/translation can help? I think
that Fabrice is overloaded so perhaps Kaja can clean that, please!

FRANT (n.)

Measure. The legal minimum distance between two trains on the District

less than 122 chains (or 8 leagues) long, is not connected in any way
with the adjective 'frantic' which comes to us by a completely
different route (as indeed do the trains).

I could provide new binaries for sparc solaris, redhat and irix 
tomorrow; or on Saturday, if any problems (I cannot work on TL today).

Hi,

I am back home now and can work on updating xdvi to the latest version now.
Nobody has disagreed about the update of the sources, so I suggest the
following:

- I start updating xdvik in my teTeX sources and see if all goes well
  (from the diff, I have seen that the autoconf stuff has slightly
  changed, so this needs some testing / integration)
- as soon as everything works, I check mail and see if anybody disagrees
  about the update
- I'll check in the new stuff into the perforce tree if nobody has
  disagreed so far

How can we get new binaries for xdvik after the sources are changed? I
doubt that all people who have contributed binaries are on this list...

What do we do if we can't get a new xdvik on all platforms? I guess,
we should distribute the old binary and keep the old sources somewhere
(-> GPL requires this).

Thomas

So, we now need new xdvi.bin / oxdvi.bin binaries. Staszek (for the
i386-linux binaries with static libXaw) should do the following after
a full make:

  rm texk/xdvik/xdvi.bin; (cd texk/xdvik; make xdvi.bin x_tool_libs="-Wl,-Bstatic -lXaw -Wl,-Bdynamic -lXpm -lXmu -lXt")
  rm texk/oxdvik/oxdvi.bin; (cd texk/oxdvik; make oxdvi.bin x_tool_libs="-Wl,-Bstatic -lXaw -Wl,-Bdynamic -lXpm -lXmu -lXt")

Is there anybody who can inform the other people who have submitted
binaries?

Good question, what about putting in a `reverse patch` from the distributed
version to the one with old binaries.

Ok, you don't need the full make. The following should do:
  (cd texk/kpathsea; make)
  (cd texk/xdvik; make xdvi.bin)
  (cd texk/oxdvik; make oxdvi.bin)

Indeed - IANAL, but wouldn't it be sufficient to distribute the
2 diffs:

These don't apply cleanly, due to slightly different autoconf stuff. I
have just created the "right" diff and added it to perforce.

Hi!

I found that the same is the case with the sprac-solaris2.7 binaries,
NO difference given by cmp. 

In my sources I didn't find anything like -DOmega in Makefile.in or
so. Hmmmmmm.

Oops... I just have fixed that (-DOmega was missing). I guess that I
have messed it up in teTeX-beta and Sebastian has copied from me...

We need new xdvi.bin / oxdvi.bin binaries anyway. Everybody who
submits new binaries should make sure that -DOmega is set in
texk/oxdvik/Makefile.in (change #2101 add this).

Thanks for spotting this!

I found that live.tex was changed on May, 23rd. We have now MacOSX
section, great! I can add small corrections (please add history notes
after any  change, OK?). Kaja, can you change the original live.tex?
I hope that today I can start updating the Polish translation ;-))
What about German, Slovak and Russian?

New binaries (235 programs each) for sparc solaris 2.7, irix 6.5 
and linux redhat 7.2 look pretty and are ready for submission.

I checked linux xdvi.bin and oxdvi.bin, redhat 7.2, for libraries; 
both use libXaw.so.7 (see below). Thomas, should your hack be applied,
or can these two be submitted to the Master tree as is?

Good. Still, I think that only (o)xdvi.bin should be submitted.

I already have submitted new (o)xdvi.bin binaries from Staszek, so I
don't see any need to update the i386-linux binaries again.

here it is. I would suggest please use the static build mode
or let Stasek check in his binaries. Is there a need for updated
binaries in i386-linux? Only xdvi.bin and oxdvi.bin have changed!

I could try, if the original live.tex compiles; it seems that
one of the examples is missing:

  ~/texlive/Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/english> latex live.tex
  [...]
  ! FancyVerb Error:

where is ex1.tex?

Why do we have that i686-pc-linux-gnu in addition to i386-linux? Can't
we just drop that?

I think this is just the build  directory in Build/source/bin/....
On alpha here I get also some `strange' names (ev...).

This is how my build host identifies itself; RedHat binaries for TeXLive 6
were made in the same environment. Ask Sebastian...

If we need i386 binaries and someone already is doing it,  I'm all for it...

Thanks. I synchronized without using -f option;  is -f really 
necessary for retrieving the files
not present on the client?

Ah, I was just confused about Build/Binaries/bin vs. Master/bin. The
install script has some hard-coded systems it knows about. And for linux
on *86, it will use files from i386-linux, nothing else.

So, a i686-pc-linux-gnu in Master/bin would not be useful. But, it is
somewhere else, so all is good...

   doc/fonts/devanagr/readme

Beware: there is also read.me (shouldn't be touched ;-)

   Fabrice, perhaps here is the problem with copying the first file.
   
3. doc/musixtex/   
   178kb of .toc, .idx, .ilg, .ind, .lgi, .olg, .slg

this is where I now am. It just needs Fabrice

It's not me, who made this;-) I found it using Linux. Perhaps windows
users will be happy having just copies according to my list (instead of
links). Fortunatelly, the files are small and index.html is OK for that.

I am confused, as I'm also running TeXLive from the CD image. My image
is texlive7-1-20000520.iso. Do you use an earlier or later image?

The path is /tl7/texmf/dvips/config/ps2pk.map and the file *does not*
contain the line.

Same: texlive7-1-20020520.iso (I guess `2000' was a typo)

It seems to me that in TeXLive, not all type1 fonts are
configured by default for use with xdvi, since ps2pk map doesn't
contain the lines for the plr* fonts, and updmap.cfg is pretty
empty as well. Is there some separate step needed to `install'/
activate these fonts? I couldn't find anything on that in the
TeXLive documentation; maybe someone who knows TeXLive better can
comment on that?


So, to sum up your problem (for the list, and for Nicolai): The
reason why you see wrong characters in your DVI file is that in
TeXLive, fonts like plr10.pfb are in a non-standard encoding, but
ps2pk.map doesn't contain the lines (which are only present in
dvips/pl/pl.map) like:

plr10 PLRoman10-Regular "encplrm ReEncodeFont" <plrm.enc <plr10.pfb

The reason why I couldn't reproduce your problem initially with
teTeX is that there, fonts like plr10.pfb are named and encoded
differently, and the .map entry (in psfonts.map in that case)
doesn't require any re-encoding:

plr10 PLR10 <plr10.pfb


Now, xdvi (in find_T1_font()) first tries to find a font in the
map file, and if this doesn't work it tries to find the font by
its name on disk. The second succeeds in the case of plr10.pfb,
but of course no re-encoding is done in this case, so the wrong
characters are displayed with TeXLive.

Could you please put a copy of ps2pk.map that additionally
contains all lines from dvips/pl/pl.map into a place where xdvi
finds it, e.g.  do:
   export TEXINPUTS=".:"
and put the copy of ps2pk.map into the current working directory.
Is your DVI file rendered correctly now?


Nicolai: Maybe this problem shows that the raw fontname (the
`second' case in find_T1_font()) shouldn't be used as a fallback
(or not always, but only if it's a `known' fontname/encoding such
as cmr)? What cases was it supposed to cover originally?

Best,
Stefan

Fixed since Sebastian has switched to my updmap tool:

$ grep plr10 ps2pk.map 
plr10    PLRoman10-Regular            "encplrm ReEncodeFont"  <plrm.enc  <plr10.pfb

Good - just to make sure: Is this the ps2pk.map on the CD image,
or is it created in the `local' user directories
(/usr/TeX/texmf-var/dvips/config seems to be the default) when
the user selects `R' (run from CD-ROM) in install-cd.sh? It
seems that in my case the problem was also that no appropriate
local files had been installed by that step:

$ pwd
/usr/TeX/texmf-var
$ ls -lR dvips/ xdvi/
dvips/:
total 4
drwxrwxrwx    2 root     root         4096 May 24 15:24 config/

Subject: [tex-live] CM-Super font package v0.3.3 released
Message-ID: <eyelg0thut.fsf@video.uic.vsu.ru>

Hi!

i've released the CM-Super font package v0.3.3

major changes:

* Added Computer Modern Bright super-fonts: 19 *.pfb and *.afm.gz
  files, and corresponding entries in the MAP files.

* Generated precise (non-integer) widths for Concrete fonts.
  (which were forgotten in previous version)

see ChangeLog for other changes.

So, now CM-Super package supports the following TeX fonts:

* all EC fonts (T1 encoding)
* all TC fonts (TS1 encoding)
* all EC/TC Concrete fonts (T1/TS1 encodings)
* all EC/TC Bright fonts (T1/TS1 encodings)
* LH fonts matching font families of EC fonts (T2A/T2B/T2C/X2 encodings)
* LH fonts for Concrete font families (T2A/T2B/T2C/X2 encodings)
* LH fonts for CM-Bright font families (T2A/T2B/T2C/X2 encodings)

There are 434 Type 1 outline fonts (*.pfb) in the CM-Super font set,
and they cover 2536 TeX fonts!
[however, currently 25 Type 1 fonts are still missing]

changes in PFB files: 14 files for Concrete fonts were changed, and 19
new files for Bright fonts were added. All other files did not change.

The CM-Super font package should be mirrored tomorrow to
CTAN:fonts/ps-type1/cm-super

Best,
v.

This is the file on the CD image. As far as the installation to disk is
concerned, the installer makes sure that the locally created map files
reflect the set of installed fonts.

So, it all sounds perfect to me now!

Hello Fabrice,

I do not know, whether the mktexfmt.exe is synchronized
with mktexfmt. So I repeat the bug report I have send
to Thomas:

The environment variable VARTEXMF points to an
empty directory. Then a pdftex run fails, because
a format cannot be generated. The cause for this is,
that the directory %VARTEXMF%\web2c does not exists.

Thomas has fixed this problem for the unix script
by generating web2c if it is not exist.

Yours sincerely

I have just fixed the install so that the "R" option
installs stuff in the selected VARTEXMF and runs updmap
on the local copy of updmap.cfg. So you get complete
.map files created on your local disk space.

I am very happy with this new setup based on updmap.
It seems clean and efficient.

Great (I take it this is the file
ftp.tug.org:/home/tlprod/Master/install-cd-1.sh
? Just downloaded and tested it, and it works now :-)

BTW, while testing this I found a small glitch in updmap:
When the line

egrep '^(Mixed|)Map' /usr/TeX/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg

returns no results (which was the case with the old updmap.cfg
from texlive7-1-20020520.iso), the script will hang until
interrupted with `Ctrl-C' with a `missing argument' error
from kpsewhich; here's the output of updmap with `set -x':

++ locateMaps '^(Mixed|)Map'
+++ egrep '^(Mixed|)Map' /usr/TeX/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
+++ awk '{ for (i=2; i <= NF; ++i) {print $i} }'
+++ sed 's@#.*@@'
+++ sort
+++ uniq
++ locateDvipsCfg
++ kpsewhich '--format=dvips config'
Missing argument. Try `kpsewhich --help' for more information.

I have now gone through most of my email, and I hope
I have made all the changes possible. these include
new fmtutil and mktexpk from Thomas, which affected
the source.

I have updated some macros, done lots of small cleaning
things, and rebuilt English, French and German documentation.

I have not done anything about the long MacOSX or xdvi arguments;
I trust that those involved sorted it all out. I am making
alpha osf replacement binaries, as my sole contribution...

If anyone is expecting me to do have done something,
and I have not explicitly said I have done it, shout now.

Applied at least to my source tree and binaries.

This raises the more general question of Perl script. I was happy to
be able to provide .exe files thanks to the Perl compiler, because :
- Perl is not needed on windows
- scripts can be run off the cdrom
but :
- people can't upgrade the scripts

It is likely that other problems will surface. To get some ideas :
- gswin32c.exe is not on the user's PATH. Should I clobber the user's
PATH with this, given the fact that gsdll32.dll (hence gswin32c.exe)
can be found using the registry ?
- TEMP areas : there is a system call to get the TEMP dir under WIn32
(not a C library one, a Win32 one, GetTempPath()) and it should be
used instead all of the checkings about some env var or hardwired /tmp
directory.
- signals
- texfind does not work because it is using the FindBin.pm module and
I'm not sure to be able to fix it in time.

On the other hand, texshow, texexec, texdoctk and most others seem to
work.

I have updated thumbpdf to version 3.1 and put it
into the /incoming directory of ftp.dante.de.

* I am using now "unless $^O =~ /win/i". So the cygwin
  port is machted, too. (I know nothing about the
  availability of SIGHUP in cygwin or Windows NT/2000.

* Version 3.1 does contain some other bug fixes, so
  it should replace 3.0 at any case.

Perhaps a wrapper in TeXLive's bin/win32 directory:
* If gswin32c.exe is in the PATH before TeXLive's
  bin directory, so Ghostscript's gswin32c is found
  and used.
* If gswin32c.exe is in the PATH after TeXLive's
  bin directory, the wrapper should search the
  PATH for gswin32c.exe and call the first found
  gswin32c, excluding itself.
* If Ghostscript's gswin32c.exe is not found in the PATH,
  then the registry can be asked for the location of
  gswin32c.exe.

config.guess is used together with patterns in "case" constructs to set
the current platform which is later used in various places in the script.
So, changes to config.guess need to match the patterns.

In the following, take care about "-" vs. "_"...

Your hand-modified config.guess sets
  sys=powerpc_darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}
  system=powerpc_darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}
whereas the net-version sets
  sys=powerpc-apple-darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}
  sys=powerpc-darwin${UNAME_RELEASE}

So, you just need to replace in the following "case":
  powerpc_darwin5*)   usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=powerpc_darwin53;;
by
  powerpc-darwin5*)   usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=powerpc_darwin53;;
  
That's it about the MacOS/X issue.

The next thing to make sure, is that the new config.guess also works
with the other patterns used in install-cd-[12].sh:

    *86-linux*)         usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=i386_linux;;
#    hppa1.[01]-hpux*)  usrprefix=/opt ;varprefix=/usr/local ;Sys=hppa20_hpux1020;;
    mips-irix6.*)       usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=mips_irix65;;
    rs6000-aix4.[123]*) usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=powerpc_aix4330;;
    powerpc-aix4.[123]*) usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=powerpc_aix4330;;
    sparc-solaris2.[5678]*)  usrprefix=/opt ;varprefix=/usr/local ;Sys=sparc_solaris27;;
    alphaev5*-osf4*)    usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=alphaev5_osf40d;;
    alpha*-linux*)      usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=alphaev5_linux;;
    *86-solaris*)               usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=i386_solaris;;

I think that these pattern seem to work with the usual 'net versions
of onfig.guess, but as a general advice; I think that less restrictive
pattern hardly hurt. Since you only have one version for sparc-solaris,
you could make the pattern
  sparc-solaris*

If someone comes with a sparc-solaris2.4 system, the installer will try
the only set which might work. This is better than not trying anything at
all. The documentation should list the tested systems, but the installer
should allow anything that *might* work.

I'd make the pattern the following way:

    *86-linux*)     usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=i386_linux;;
#    hppa1.*-hpux*)  usrprefix=/opt ;varprefix=/usr/local ;Sys=hppa20_hpux1020;;
    mips-irix*)     usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=mips_irix65;;
    rs6000-aix*)    usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=powerpc_aix4330;;
    powerpc-aix*)   usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=powerpc_aix4330;;
    sparc-solaris*) usrprefix=/opt ;varprefix=/usr/local ;Sys=sparc_solaris27;;
    alphaev*-osf*)  usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=alphaev5_osf40d;;
    alpha*-linux*)  usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=alphaev5_linux;;
    *86-solaris*)   usrprefix=/usr ;varprefix=/var ;Sys=i386_solaris;;

I am quite sure that the 'net version of config.guess will work fine
with these patterns...

I have put up the fixes for xdvi into the source. Most platforms
have fixed binaries:

$ for i in */*xdvi.bin; do grep 22.40k $i >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "good: $i" || echo "bad: $i"; done | sort

good: mips-irix6.5/xdvi.bin
good: sparc-solaris2.7/oxdvi.bin
good: sparc-solaris2.7/xdvi.bin

Is there anybody who can contribute new binaries for i386-solaris2.8 /
powerpc-aix4.3.3.0?

Sebastian, can you try to trigger this?

I guess that any unfixed xdvi will immediately crash now (at least when
running from CD against the full set of configured type1 fonts):

    $ wc ps2pk.map 
       3867   21349  261081 ps2pk.map

    xdvik-22.40i, i.e. the version currently used in TL7, and `large'
     .map files (with more than 31 encodings or more than 3071 fonts -
    yes, it's an off-by-one-error) that will cause to a segmentation
    fault while reading the .map file(s) at startup time, independent
    of the current DVI file.

That does not look like my latest version of updmap. Can you please try
with my latest version?

The right version looks like this:

$ ls -l /t/texlive/Master/bin/i386-linux/updmap
-r-xr-xr-x    1 te       te          25585 May 25 01:58 /t/texlive/Master/bin/i386-linux/updmap

There is that problem that -G1 produces wrong output and we decided that
we either need to patch dvips or remove "G" from config.pdf.

Tomas has checked in his changes into source.development and they never
ended up in source. So, the dvips binaries that we have are still broken
and we should remove that G option from config.pdf.

Too bad...

Thanks, I have uploaded version 3.2 that detects

You're right: I was still running the script from the 20020520
image; it works with the new version. Sorry for the false
alarm.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.30.0205261406080.15347-100000@sun2.ruf.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

the variable settings in texmf.cnf are very inconsistent,
for example pool_size. It seems the value should now
be increased by factor ten, most pool_size entries
contain 1 250 000.

The result of "grep pool_size texmf.cnf":

pool_size =           125 000
pool_size.hugetex = 1 250 000
pool_size =         1 250 000
pool_size.mpost =     500 000
pool_size.context = 1 250 000
pool_size.metafun = 1 000 000
pool_size....     = 1 250 000 (all following entries)

So pool_size without program name occurs two times,
  kpsewhich --expand-var \$pool_size
shows "125 000", so the first entry is choosen
with the lowest value.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek@uni-freiburg.de>

so the first one is bad, but the others are consistent.

The first match wins, so you have to put any pool_size.progname *before*
pool_size. Any pool_size.progname setting after the unqualified pool_size
setting will be ignored.

So, the first line should go away and the third has to be moved after the
others.

yikes, is this true??? I had not realized that the order
mattered. I had assumed that "pool_size.progname" always won
over pool_size

I'll move all unqualified ones to the end

It is the general kpathsea rule: first match wins. Same for search paths.

but how can it ever have worked, then? texmf.cnf has

Now I am puzzled:

$ grep pool_size /media/texlive7/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
pool_size =                     125000
% 25000 less than pool_size, but doesn't need to be nearly that large.
pool_size.hugetex =                     1250000
pool_size =                             1250000
pool_size.mpost =                       500000

pool_size.cslatex =                     1250000
pool_size.hugelatex =                   1250000
pool_size.latex =                       1250000
pool_size.jadetex =                     1250000
pool_size.pdfjadetex =                  1250000
pool_size.xmltex =                      1250000
pool_size.pdfxmltex =                   1250000
pool_size.pdflatex =                    1250000
pool_size.pdfelatex =                   1250000
pool_size.pdfetex        =              1250000

$ /media/texlive7/bin/i386-linux/kpsewhich -expand-var \$pool_size
125000

$ /media/texlive7/bin/i386-linux/kpsewhich -progname=pdfetex \
  -expand-var \$pool_size
1250000

$ /media/texlive7/bin/i386-linux/kpsewhich -progname=mpost \

Perhaps I am too tired for detecting the different
ones? (I have compared the numbers with your
grep log and I am using the image of 2002/05/20.)

But the exact numbers are less important than
that the matching rules should be added to
the comments, especially that FOO.PROGRAM
always wins over FOO (,if this is true).
And double entries should be removed.

I agree with your tests. having the unqualified values
first does NOT seem to matter after all.

I will soon look at the ChangeLog and/or sources of kpathsea. I am sure
that the "first match wins" rule used to be true.

Maybe, Olaf has improved kpathsea (and sure, the rule about "qualified
value wins over unqualified" is a better rule).

> sure that is technically or legally possible?

:-)

The source is always right ... :-)

Gosh! Man, am I suprised:

Fri Aug 25 14:01:24 1995  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

        * cnf.c (kpse_cnf_get): Look for NAME.PROGRAM before NAME.
        (do_line): Save NAME.PROGRAM separately from NAME.

I think that I started looking at the kpathsea/web2c sources in late 1993
or 1994 (so my "rule" was true at that time), but I am really suprised
that this change was made *that long time* ago...

Where they will be available? 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/binaries/  ???? or some other place?
We should inform people about that, at least in README files on the CD

Hello,

I have tried to use "windvi" without installing the
CD-ROM under Windows 98. I have set environment
variable VARTEXMF to a local existing directory on the
hard drive and adjusted PATH to include the
TeX-Live binary directory for win32.

The document contains CM and EC fonts. But the
font generation hangs. It works if I create the
directory "fonts" in the VARTEXMF tree.

Because lack of time I have not tested xdvi under
Linux, so that it should be checked, if pk font
generation works with missing "fonts" directory.

Yours sincerely
  Heiko <oberdiek@uni-freiburg.de>

I just did this under XP and it plains work.
Should I start W98 to test it ?

However, I have found a 'bug' in mktexpk related to some complex regex
with fonts starting in wn, this regex has been augmented with a 'd'
(don't know when) in mktexpk (shell script). So I'm uploading new
mktex.dll .

I did this on a user request some weeks ago. The script was mktexmf,
however.

I can confirm that it works from W98 also. I don't know why Heiko got
a problem with this. At best, it vanished with the latest fixes.

Good to know. Back to the wn* regex: I have changed it in mktexnam and
mktexmf. Just in case that it matters...

Subject: [tex-live] How to maintain Omega
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205270238470.31883-100000@gilas.bamdad.org>

Just recently, after John gave me write access to Omega's CVS, I found
that how much hard it is to maintain a CVS for Omega. Already, many parts
of the tree are outdated simply because TeXLive is going on full throttle
these days. Having someone update these, will be a huge burden, also since 
there is not always only a single copy of a file in the three.

So I was thinking about keeping just a small tree, and somehow defining
which are the parts that Omega people should maintain and the parts that
TeXLive people should. And it will be the responsiblity of developers to 
fetch each part from each source. They should also send some of the 
patches to TeXLive repository and the others to Omega repository.

This is just the general idea. I would appreciate any ideas that would 
lead to easing the pain of maintainance, to let people develop.

You are right, the not existing fonts directory is not
the problem. I have deleted the fonts directory and
tested with a small test file. It worked.

Then however I have deleted the fonts directory
again and used a larger document. Then the
font generation hangs, if it reaches "cmr10".
After dismiss, the second call of windvi hangs
again, so I have deleted the log and mktexpk
programs in the task manager. Then the font
generation completes.

Perhaps these problems are caused by deleting
the fonts directory, if the "daemon feature"
is active and thought that the cmr10 file
has to be exist because of the previous
small test file.

But I do not have an explanation, why the
font generation failed the very first
time on a larger document and I cannot
reproduce this behaviour.

Yours sincerely

I don't see that Omega needs to maintain anything except
  texmf/omega
  texmf/fonts/*/public/omega
 
 and (in source)
  texk/web2c/omegadir

I'd strongly suggest the rest of the texmf tree in the CVS be wiped.
UNLESS anyone is prepared to maintain TeX Live from the Omega
site, which is a possibility. But that would be a big deal for 
someone to take on. I am afraid that I do not much fancy switching
from the Perforce-based system in Europe, just for the sake of Omega.

This is not the first time we have had this discussion, about
a common site to maintain The Master TeX source and texmf trees in.
As it stands, we have (at least):

 - TeX Live (inf fpTeX) and teTeX; broadly in sync, but maintained separately.
    currently this works because Thomas communicates with people doing
    TeXlive in an exceptionally civilised way.
 
 - web2c. Olaf maintains this master source of part of the system
    at a slower pace, quite rightly, and does not get involved
    in packaging TeX systems
 
 - Omega. a mysterious place.....

 - MikTeX. I don't know how Christian keeps himself up to date.
    I have never had any communication with him
 
 - the commercial folk. so far as one can tell, they don't ever
    update their TeX systems these days, and they have commercial
    closed-source drivers anyway
 
 - the semi-commercial Mac folk (CMacTeX and OzTeX). I don't
    know the extent to which they keep up

 - CTAN. its own world, doing a different job from useable texmf trees

I do not see anyone with the strength of will and the resources
to rescue the situation, but I am willing to believe that it
can be done.

does this correspond with other people's assessment?

To be exact, that should also include:
    texk/web2c/omegafonts
               omegaware
               otps
and
    texmf/doc/omega

But there are also some files in other places, like:

Will TeXLive keep these?

I completely agree with you, specially since Omega is TeXLive oriented.

Sure. The only things I have against Perforce is that I need to learn it,
and that our network people have not yet agreed to give me access to port
1666!

As TeX Live draws to a close for this year, here are the
TLOscars for 2002:

 * late submission prize: although Fabrice made a valiant
     effort, submitting new win32 binaries up until this
     evening, Staszek beat him to it by still doing
     Polish docs even as I write

 * honourable mention for late submission: Thomas
     made an unusual entry into the race this year, by
     getting me to zap some entire packages at the last minute.
     but he was disqualified, as in fact he didnt *tell*
     me to follow his lead in teTeX, I just did anyway
 
 * fattest late change: Vladimir has to win this one,
     for updating cm-super yesterday, making one of
     the biggest packages around
 
 * hard work prize: I don't think anyone will 
     be surprised to hear that Fabrice won this, as usual,
     for exceptional amounts of late night bug fixing
  
 * hardest-to-please tester: Janusz gets a medal
     for his efforts in trying to break the system


If Hans, Gerben, Martin, Kaja, Volker and Norbert don't get any prizes,
it is just because they were simply very helpful.....

if Omega has started to use texk/web2c/omega* for system-independent

Given the changes, a sync, compile, upload cycle for new binaries is 
probably what you want, is it not? After all, you do not want different 
versions of programs for different OSs.

which changes? the only thing that has happened is changes to xdvi, which
does not affect the MacOSX binaries. the other changes are all scripts,
which I have updated.

It seems that the html-code contains 8-bit characters (for ligatures at 
least) in some enconding (probably will work fine on Windows or probably 
is some sort of iso-latin-1). Anyway, it displays configure as conøgure 
for instance on Mac OS X.

Are there ligature-commands in HTML?

Ahemm, well, you might be right.

This was a side effect of putting kpathsea hash-tables in shared
memory. The fact is that kpathsea is far from being reentrant. But for
the main usage, all hash-tables (ls-R, cnf variables, aliases) can be
considered constant over a batch of runs : you won't change texmf.cnf
in the middle of tex->mpost->tex . However, sometimes, you need
kludges : if mktexpk is called, you need to call mktexupd, but also to
insert dynamically the new file in the global shared table (the point
of all this is to no reread ls-R files).

Now, when it comes to mktexpk, I wrote it at first as a single program
: if mktexpk need to call mktextfm or mktexmf, it should call the
function doing the job inside, and not issue a system() call. However,
it is also a fact that the interfaces are not clean enough to allow
this in every place. And there comes the real problem. Mktex.c is
using a bunch of variables equivalent to the ones in the mktex shell
scripts, and stores them in a ... hash-table. So if you issue a
system() call, you do not have any more a separate name space for the
'variables' of both mktex processes. So there is a clash. The net
result was a total mixup of the variables, cm files ending up in pl/
subdirectory and so on. 

The fix : differentiate name spaces for variables by suffixing them
with a unique suffix. Only a couple of lines to add to
contrib/variables.c :-)

Subject: [tex-live] final TL7
Message-ID: <200205271252.OAA06174@lps.univ-lille1.fr>

I have just installed the latest TL7 (20020527) on a Linux machine, 
and tested it on rather large files in dvi and pdf with a variety 
of (public) fonts.

Installation runs flawlessly, handling of fonts is *much* better 
than in TL6b (xdvi uses the T1-fonts out of the box, great!).

I'd like to mention two details:

1) the installation process reports a missing 'beton.dvi' file
   (should be installed by tex-latexextra), not really annoying.

2) something that puzzles me: some time ago I had reported that
   the French hyphenation patterns were not uptodate, Sebastian
   fixed the problem, and in the latest version the old version
   (v. 2.9  1999/11/04) come up again instead of 
    v. 2.11 2002/01/16. The difference is not so important,
   but I wonder how this is possible (CTAN only has v. 2.11). 
   Perhaps the same happened with other file, this is the main 
   reason for me to report about this.

It is my fault anyway, the wrong version of frhyph was already in
the 2002/05/20 edition, which I did not check carefully enough to
report the problem in due time. Sorry for this.

Daniel.

Sure! It must serve for many German users.
English doc has also many bugs. 
Missing file-copy.gif in doc/tldoc/pictures/.

Sebastian, if you want some more space on the CD, do grep ".jpg" *.html
files, then delete 0.5mb from tldoc/pictures/ :-}.

Will finish Polish tldoc within 2-3 hours. SORRY!

It's probably missing the encoding-header. Try to run it through

Great! I've just uploaded Polish doc (nightmare with `Kpathsea
file types' table in .html, see also French livese7.html;-).

It is here 7:48, so we spent quite nice night, Volker? ;-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205280841190.24626-100000@newton.feld.cvut.cz>

Hello,

I have tried the CSTeX functionality (for Czech and Slovak users) on
the image texlive-1-20020527.iso and it seems that all works correclty.

OK, thank you everybody.

It is not so self-evident, because you changed a lot of things in texmf
tree and I have a experiences that something was not working (the csplain
and cslatex was not chmoded to executable scripts in TL6, for example :-).

I have tried only the raw cdrom mounted on /cdrom directory in my Linux
box _without_ any installation. I have only set:

export PATH=/cdrom/bin/i386-linux
export VARTEXMF=/tmp/texmf

and tried: csplain, cslatex, pdfcsplain, pdfcslatex, xdvi, dvips
on many documents...

I noticed that you change the psfonts.map to all fonts used as
Type1 fonts (no Metafont->pk) including CSfonts. The xdvi uses the Type1
fonts too, great!

It is extremly needed to include into documentation the
possibility of "dvips -Ppk" in order to switch the dvips to the old
behaviour. I will ask Janka Chlebikova, why the README.CZS and
czech_sk.html is one year old and if she will prepare the
new version of these files. If not, I will send
these files a little actualised during tomorrow.
Two links from czech_sk.html to file:/cdrom/usergrps/cstug/...
don't work, for example.

Thank you

Petr Olsak

While we're at it. What is the schedule now? Are you still accepting 
small fixes, like for documentation (I noticed the faq contains some 
errors)?

Or are we done (in which case I can go upgrading my machine with the new 
developer environment, which I did put on hold until TL7 is done).

it is getting a bit late to change the documentation,
but something on the texlive web page would help

But I will need another machine to use perforce from, no? I'm actually
doing this from the Omega machine in Australia, although one can assume
that I am in Europe, when he considers Internet geography (we have
connections to Netherlands and France). This Iran to Australia to Germany

It is ok. Note, Sebastian, that this is "texk" not "texmf".

I now get this message for `Expanded Plain TeX' (I quote the item from
memory, forgot to write it down and I am now on Linux).

For `KOMA Scipt user's Guide (german)' I get a lot of messages

        special not handled papersize...

For all PDF files I got a strange behaviour: at the first click of
`View' the Acrobat window is visible just for a fraction of second, at
the second click is is displayed correctly.

For `Context command' I get a message suggesting that setup-en.pdf is
corrupted.

BTW, I used the the same CD which didn't on Polish NT.

Best regards

Janusz

yes, please!
(I'm wondering why on http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/
  German/English and French is dated 29th May, but Polish is 26th?)

I get this also for 
        docstrip documentation (forgot the exact file name)
        dsdoc.dvi
which are nevertheless displayed.

The following files are not found at all: 
        datenumber.dvi, 
        beton.dvi,
        yfonts.dvi.

For `CTAN sites" I get 
        sites: not a known document format

Acrobat reader report errors for 
        dvips.pdf.

Nothing is displayed for 
        Belleek fonts, 
        CM-Super font package
        lucidabr, 
        Math Time fonts, 
        Scalable type 1 CM fonts, 
        Greek fonts (cbgreek), 
        crop marks (crop)

Nothing is displayed but the message: 
        Trying to extract information out of .sty file...
is produced for
        Double line spacing, 
        Shaped paragraphs

Now a few words about NTEmacs.

Why RefTeX is not switched on by default for (La)TeX files?

On the other hand, there is an attempt to switch on by default the
BibCite mode, which is not available for loading, hence an error:

File mode specification error: (void-function turn-on-bib-cite)

Only small thing: *.gif files used to build tldoc are *not* updated in 
Master/texmf/doc/tldoc/pictures/
Those marked with `!' should be replaced, some other to zap.
I hope that I will be the final correction. Uffff!

Omega 1.15, so that Apostolos book examples will run.

and probably throw off some obscure TeX stuff in favour of some
XML material.

(former gives an error message before beeing found).

datenumber and yfonts shouldn't give errors. beton leads turbulent 
life, first in both tree and database, then zapped (I think) from 
the tree, now back in the tree but no longer in the database :) 
I added it back to texdoc-local and submitted...

I have downgraded the source tree, but I did not check if the texmf tree
needs to be adjusted for the older Omega release. Does anybody know?

Thomas,

I just learned perforce enough to sync my tree to the latest revision
before Thomas backup to Omega 1.15. But would you please consider doing
this 1.15 thing on a branch and leave the Perforce equivalent of the trunk
to be 1.23?

I'm drafting a method for Omega development, and without TeXLive being 
the latest thing, I'm in hell (together with others who have just been 
given CVS commit access to Omega).

Sorry for the continuous spam, but my head is spinning in circles.

Would someone please explain the exact game going in TeXLive repository?
What is '/Build/source' and what is '/Build/source.development'? Which one is

The old stuff is available in Build/source, I have checked in the 1.15 stuff
into Build/source.development. What I did is the following:

I have copied omegadir omegafonts omegaware and otps from TeX Live 6
and then made it work with web2c-7.3.7 (only small adjustments).

I really don't mind. Sebastian is the master of the perforce tree and
he should decide. We did not loose any files, so there is no reason
to panic...

which is entirely right. the default source tree is //depot/Build/source/,
which is Omega 1.23. //depot/Build/source.development is a branch
for playing around, and the current game is to revert to Omega 1.15

so 1.15 *is* in a branch

I promise, the defaullt TeX Live *is* the latest thing...

Sebastian, I really need your opinion of what to do exactly with Omega
development. Omega is becoming different from the years before (at least
from my point of view).

The panic was really because all the nice picture in my mind dissolved at 
a moment. I was finalizing a draft for Omega development, and suddenly I 
found that I cannot expect certain things.

 /Build/source.development
    is for experimenting (or breaking) things. once it appears stable, 
    the files are copied to /Build/source

 /Build/source
    are stable sources used for making TeXLive.

 /Master
    is the actual contents of everything for TeXLive (covers both CDs).

source.development has a bug fix to dvips, a later unstable pdftex,
omega 1.15, and a rearranged layout

I think you are doing the right thing, concentrating the 
Omega CVS on stuff that is Omega specific. that should merge
into a TeX Live setup with no problems at all.

ignore the talk of source.development. that is a texlive
play area. look at the main texmf tree, and the //depot/Build/source
tree. that is currently the latest of everything (except
dvips and pdftex).

Build/source is what is on the current CD. source.development is
what will be on the next CD. at some point in the cycle,
source is updated from source.development, when the next CD
is stabilizing.

But that's a little problematic and may become a pain in the ass for Omega
developers who will be hacking C or Web code.

Let's see the guidelines for someone who just wants to start development:

1. Checkout: a) Setup cvs, b) Checkout from 'omega.cse.unsw.edu.au',
   c) Setup p4, d) Sync with 'texlive.dante.de', e) Copy sources from 
   TeXLive tree to Omega tree?!

2. Update: a) Sync with 'texlive.dante.de', b) update with 
   'omega.cse.unsw.edu.au', c) What then? Resolve conflicts?

3. Commit: a) If you've edited any file not currently in the Omega tree, 
   use 'cvs add'. From now on, it is your responsiblity updating it with
   TeXLive, and making sure you won't break anything else. b) commit to 
   'omega.cse...', and make sure you don't accidentally add anything not
   edited.

4. Release: a) If you've changed anything owned by TeXLive since the last 
   release, make sure you send it to TeXLive developers. b) Sync
   Omega files to TeXLive repository. c) Sync your TeXLive tree and make 
   sure all tests are passed.

Any better idea?

Just FYI: minimal changes to make omega 1.15 work with web2c-7.3.7
have been:

  usagelong (0, FOO, nil);        -> usagehelp (FOO);
  usage_long (0, FOO, nil);       -> usage_help (FOO);
  usage (1, 'foo');               -> usage (foo);
  xmalloc (size + 1)              -> xmalloc_array (type, size)
  xmalloc_array (ptr, size)       -> ptr = xmalloc_array (type, size)
  output_c_style_error_messages_p -> file_line_error_style_p

After these changes, it compiled and omega started without
crashing. "lambda sample2e" also works...

I have not yet tested anything else.

Subject: [tex-live] Draft Proposal for Omega
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205291653340.30708-100000@gilas.bamdad.org>

This is a draft proposal for Omega development, Version 1. Please send
your comments to me or the Omega list. Note that we also need to settle on
some mechanism for giving CVS commit access to people.

I'll clean up the CVS tree and post exact instructions for checking out
the latest sources after we came to some consensus on the rules.

These are the guides that have been used to set up the rules:

  1. Thou shall minimize the headache.
  2. Thou shall depend on TeXLive.
  3. Thou shall not delay development.

These are the rules:

  1. Things not directly related to Omega, like the files who need not to be
     changed from the official TeXLive version to continue Omega
     development, do not belong to the Omega tree, but the TeXLive tree. 
     Omega developers should use the latest official version from the stable
     branch of Perforce repository at 'texlive.dante.de' which is called
     '//depot/Build/source' there.

  2. The following are the directories and files that belong to Omega. The 
     latest official version will be the STABLE branch of the Omega tree.
     These are the ones from the 'texmf' tree:

	texmf/doc/omega/*
	texmf/dvips/omega/*
	texmf/fonts/*/public/omega/*
	texmf/omega/*

     These are the ones from the 'source' tree:

	source/TeX/texk/odvipsk/*
	source/TeX/texk/owindvi/*
	source/TeX/texk/oxdvik/*
	source/TeX/texk/web2c/omegadir/*
	source/TeX/texk/web2c/omegafonts/*
	source/TeX/texk/web2c/omegaware/*
	source/TeX/texk/web2c/otps/*
	source/TeX/texk/web2c/man/omega.man

  3. In some cases, a change to some other file, with an owner outside Omega
     developers, will need to happen. In such a case, the developer should
     sync his TeXLive tree with the Perforce repository of TeXLive, to make
     sure he's using the latest version. He can then 'add' the file to
     Omega's CVS Repository, but will be the only soul responsible for
     keeping the file in sync with TeXLive. A list of these should be kept
     somewhere in the repository, and the individual files should be removed
     as soon as they are submitted to TeXLive and accepted in the stable
     branch there.

Basically, we only have a different Makefile.in which defines -DOmega
for the compiler. Most other files are just symlinks to the "non-o"
version. So, I guess that if someone changes something here, it should
be done in coordination with the maintainer of the "non-o" version.

In simple terms, these are not owned by Omega, and the same procedures as
changing other files should be undertaken with these. Am I right?

Are the contacts listed in README files in the according directories, or
an owner list somewhere? I want to keep duplicate documentation at the
minimum.

Yes. Although, I think that the mainstream maintainer would accept any
omega related changes inside the
  #ifdef Omega
  ...
  #endif
parts.

I hope we can catch that in time. Will things like this be announced on

I'm trying to put it in some way it won't sound like a pain. I've not 
CC-ed the Omega list, you know ;)

Last time I commited to Gnome, it was very easy. I just checkout out the
module, fixed it, and sent the patch to someone who had commit access. He
committed it. I don't know how it happened for him, but definitely there
was not multiple repositories. Everything related to Gnome is being kept
in a single server.

That really depends on John, you know. I don't want to lose any 
opportunity to help TeX and Unicode come together, and I want to take 
things one by one.

BTW, I think for a thing as broken and unstable as Omega, and as far from
its ultimate goal, we need a more rapid development model, many branches,
everything like the common Open Source model. Also, the way John hacks
code, things are usually broken. I want him not to worry about his code
breaking stablity or anything, but just checkin the code so others will be
able to fix it. This will be possible in a Omega-only repository, but not
in a repository under sharp eyes, like TeXLive.

I appreciate any kind of comments, as always.

well, they were discussed already, weren't they? I didnt think

its OK, in the short term, to run multiple repositories, with a
few people doing hand work in the middle.  but in our TeX world we tend to let
short-term things last for 10 years or more. 

we _already_ have 3 repositories doing slightly different, but 
essentially the same, things (teTeX, web2c, and TeX Live), 
as well as the Omega one. it's not healthy,
at all. we really should combine all our efforts into a single place.
but we have so much inertia and history....

you are joking, I hope....

I quite see where you are coming from, and I wish you every success.
I am very glad that you have the time to do this pushing.

Speaking for myself, I have a limited amount of time to spend
on TeX, and I find it hard to know what to devote it too. In many ways,
I have compounded the problems by establishing the TeX Live effort,
but I know it was and is needed as a focal point. If I could hand
it over as a smoothly running operation to the Omega effort, I would.
But would anyone honestly advise me to do this? I don't think John
or Yannis are at all interested in making user-level distributions.....

As I say, I really do appreciate the work you have started here,
Roozbeh, and I wish I had a Plan that we would all work towards.
But it just isn't clear which way to go.

http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/Images/ will shortly have
the two final compressed ISO CD images for TeX Live 7.
No more changes will be entertained, and disk producers
are welcome to take these images and burn CDs.

Please pass this on to anyone in LUGs or publishers
who might want to take advantage of the work. Please
note that I am not involved in any production work.

This years release has been the result of unparalled

In the previous way of doing things, definitely no. In the way I'm trying 
to put, a little stability at the beginning is great, so I can make sure 
everything is in place.

If you cannot unite those on TeX Live, how can I push John or Omega? The
first time I asked for an open repository of Omega with commit access was
long long ago. (I asked Yannis how can I have an OTP for an Iranian
National Standard in the distribution, and he told me just to put it on
CTAN.) It is just a few days since I have CVS access. (Yes, I could branch
an OpenOmega, but I don't have the energy or the expertise to maintain it,
so I needed a shared effort.)

> I am very glad that you have the time to do this pushing.

No, I don't. I'm much more than busy, and I already lead a team of
developers which I need to micromanage (see www.farsiweb.info). I'm
cutting time from being with my girlfriend and also some sleeping.

I am just hoping, and I feel a little responsiblity, since I am a Unicode
insider. There are only a few Unicode insiders still interested in
TeXities, and they are three times busier than me.

No. You are doing it exactly fine.

No, they're not. I even can't understand why they are continuing Omega in
such a way. Why they are releasing it.

I don't plan. I just do small things. I dream something like typesetting a
Persian Unicode XML document using XSL-FO with a TeX-based engine (let's
call that Omega). And that's what I really need, what my colleagues in the
adjacent office need for their report generation.

I then head there by fixing obvious things that are obviously broken. The
Arabic character classes in OTPs have problems, I can fix it. Omega
development model is broken, I can also fix it.

If that starts to use a lot of resources without any apparent output, I
will stop, and head somewhere else. And these are as divergent as hinting
outlines with FontLab, organizing a local Linux Users Group, writing
proposals for Unicode characters needed for proper encoding of Koran,
reporting bugs to Microsoft for their problematic Persian support in
Internet Explorer, or attending a meeting on Internationalized Domain
Names.

I feel a lot of sympathy here, those twin notions of

 a) No-one else seems interested in TeX
 b) I feel responsible for persuading at least some of them

let's not forget that that you need a macro package to do the FO work
as well. My hopes are now pinned on ConTeXt. I despair of PassiveTeX
(and I am allowed to, cos I maintain it)

I'm not sure I get you.

But I need a capable Unicode aware engine somewhere, to stick the FO thing 
to it. Fortunately, other people are interested on the FO thing. When 
everything got ready, we will think of sticking them together. I can wait, 
since we measure ping times in seconds here, not microseconds. ;)

I get the joke, but the sobering fact is "No, they need much more than a
starting push". I love dropping things to see others continue it, but that 
doesn't happen much in this part of the world.

you could try making PassiveTeX work with Omega?

sadly they won't make it to ctan tonight.  i do have enough disc space
but it's not in the right places (today's been completely frantic,
with deliveries turning up late on 25-tonner artics, and so on, and
the reconfig of the archive somehow didn't quite happen).

so tomorrow night.

the changes i made were: 

* moved freetype from top level dir to TeX/libs/freetype/

* updated freetype source to a newer version

* removed contrib dir from freetype to avoid duplication
  with ttf2pk, ttf2pfb which are in TeX/texk/

* updated ttf2pk to a newer version

* added TeX/utils/mminstance/ (which build mmafm, mmpfb for unix --
  windows has these programs too but there was no source in TeXlive)

i'll add also some truetype to type42 converters which are useful.

also, it would be great to have xindy included into TeX live -- if
noone has objections, i can add it too.

it does, and building xindy will require having the clisp included
into TeX Live sources (however, that will only increase the source
tree, but the xindy binaries are quite small)

This will be fixed on the next image.

Other files on your list are identified correctly by the current 
database and the preview or print are working for me (on Unix).

Petr Olsak has raised the issue of  tex on TeX Live  not passing the trip test
if -src is used.

I am considering pulling the plug on TeX Live for this reason.

If you are considering pressing a CD, PLEASE inform me of your plans
straightaway!

I don't think that this option needs to be removed. As long as the banner
and the log don't say "This is TeX", we are on the safe side. Removing
that option is not a good idea as this option *is* useful (the macro
package is not as good as support for src specials inside the TeX engine).

Someone has to write the code that chages the banner if source specials
are active, however. And we need a name...

Well, last time (xdvi fix) it took about 2 working-days. We could use
this, to fix dvips and upgrade libxpdf, so TeX Live would be at the same
level as teTeX.

Can we use the same trick as MLTeX did ? 

Quoted from tex.ch :

ML\TeX{} will add new primitives changing the behaviour of \TeX.  The
|banner| string has to be changed.  We do not change the |banner|
string, but will output an additional line to make clear that this is
a modified \TeX{} version.

...

@x [29.534] l.10293 - MLTeX: add MLTeX banner after loading fmt file
@<Print the banner line, including the date and time@>;
@y
@<Print the banner line, including the date and time@>;
if mltex_enabled_p then
  begin wlog_cr; wlog('MLTeX v2.2 enabled');

I guess so. The situation is very similar. Knuth is using teTeX-1.0 on
Linux and this has this ML stuff.

    Can we use the same trick as MLTeX did ? 

Doesn't mltex pass trip?  At least when I worked on it, it did, as far
as I remember.  Merely adding features is one thing.  Changing the
behavior of existing features is something else altogether.

What is this src_specials thing anyway?  Just curious.

If you decide that (o)xdvi should be also recompiled for Linux,
I will do that (but don't think it is needed).

I was afraid of that ;-)

So, please find a new name or make this one official for this :

D:\Source\fptex\texk\web2c>static\tex
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.3.7)
**^C
D:\Source\fptex\texk\web2c>static\tex --src
This is src-special-TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.3.7)
**

By the way, I totally agree with Frank proposition that every single
active feature be displayed with the banner, but do we have time
currently to fix all of them ?

> What is this src_specials thing anyway?  Just curious.

It will add special{src:filename:line} everywhere in you dvi file, in
a quite crude way. Your viewer will then be able to pass
filename/line# to your editor when you click on the dvi file displayed.
XDvi(k) is making use of this now.

In fact, here are 2 proposals. One changes the banner, the other adds

The same changes need to be propagated to other affected engines.

Message-ID: <200205311534.g4VFYLu31220@f7.net>

    By the way, I totally agree with Frank proposition that every single
    active feature be displayed with the banner, but do we have time
    currently to fix all of them ?

Not in my opinion.  It would take some thinking about which features
should be mentioned and which shouldn't.  I don't think most users would
appreciate several thousand characters being added to the banner if
`every single feature' is taken literally.

    It will add special{src:filename:line} everywhere in you dvi file, 

I see.  This has the potential for doing bad things with page breaks and
line breaks. I'm sure we've all spent many many hours debugging where
whatsits are generated in our documents.  I don't think it would be
right to say `This is TeX' with such a feature turned on.  Whether we
did it last year is pretty much immaterial, seems to me.

So, I think calling it src-special-TeX (or TeX+src-specials, since
surely the `TeX' part is still more important than the `src-specials'
part) and recompiling is the way to go.  TL7 will be out there for a
year (longer really), it's worth it to fix it, now that we know about it.

Just my opinion.  Easy for me to say, I'm not doing any of the work :).

Both Dante and TUG, who are planning to press next week, can
wait a few days for a new image. So I suggest we try to do it.
I'll send out an email when a patched source is available later today.
At that point, could binary makers create new copies
of tex, etex, omega, pdftex, pdfetex, and dvips. The latter,
we might as well get the patch to 5.90.

Under the circumstances, I'm very much tempted to use

        This isn't TeX, Version 3.14159

as the banner -- this should probably be on whenever we're "plain" TeX
with anything out of the oridnary enabled: tcx files, src-specials,
MLTeX (which violates the spirit, if perhaps not the letter, of the
license).

Among them, only tcx does not violate spirit, letter or license.

I must have missed that.  For my edification, do you recall where DEK

You are correct in that it looks like a (bad) joke, and that this
isn't a good idea.

For what it's worth, if we just print another line indicating source
specials are enabled, we may need to change one (1) omega source file.
In total, the change I'd prefer then touches:
        texk/web2c/tex.ch
        texk/web2c/lib/texmfmp.c
        texk/web2c/omegadir/comsrcspec.ch

If we try to change the banner, it looks like we'll need to make
changes to get etex and pdftex to compile again, because their change
files mess with the banner string as well.  Probably we'll have to add
additional change files to the setup.  That is, I cannot figure out
right now how to avoid changing
        ./tie -c etex.ch etex.web ./tex.ch ./etexdir/tex.ech
into
        ./tie -c etex.ch etex.web ./etexdir/tex.pch ./tex.ch ./etexdir/tex.ech
and similar for pdf(e)tex.

This is weird. I made tex, etex and omega compile, but not pdftex.
The problem is :
- tex has 'banner' -> tex.web and tex.ch are tied ok
- etex has 'eTeX_banner' -> tex.web, etex.ch, tex.ch, tex.ech
                            you need to postpone changes in tex.ech to make
                            them tie, but it is ok
- omega has 'banner' -> lots of .ch but no problem
- pdftex has 'banner' -> the trick to postpone changes in tex.pch
                         can't work because the variable is called 'banner',
                         is changed in tex.web + pdftex.ch
                         and then matched with tex.ch

Evidently I haven't tried hard enough to get the changefiles 'tie'd up.

Still, on account of the extent of the necessary changes, I'd really
like to avoid messing with the first banner line and just print the
additional line, perhaps as:
        source specials enabled (incompatible with TeX)
or something like that.

Dear Karl,

Attached is a Perforce diff file for 'dvipsk' to make it compile with C++
(which was done based on the version of dvipsk available in the TeX Live
repository). It is merely additional typecasts and sometimes explicit
definitions to stop C++ from nagging. It is done by John Plaice and me.

BTW, I still can't make 'emspecial.c' work with both C and C++. Perhaps
you can help a little, by explaining what is the purpose of the typecast
in lines 1373 and 1388. They are trying to typecast a 'char *' to a
'kpse_format_file_type' which is actually an 'enum'!!

Regards,

Roozbeh Pournader,
for the Omega project.

The fonts seem to be present.

well, yes, since no-one has provided any replacement.

Points to note:

- The message I implemented is 'source specials enabled'.
  We may want to do something different, or capitalize it, or
  whatever.

- In the long run, I think we should be able to properly get away with
  this message here rather than banner changes if we manage to get the
  source-specials to be transparent for a TeX run.

And another change that you may want to consider.

    Fabrice, I think we should follow Olaf's suggestions.

I appreciate how much more painful it is to change the banner, but the
whole point here is to fix the problem, which is a binary that isn't TeX
claims to be TeX.  I don't think an additional line fixes it, because it
still says "This is TeX ...".

Hi Roozbeh -- I haven't worked on dvipsk in years.  Could you resend your
patch to tex-k@tug.org and rokicki@cs.stanford.edu?

I don't know the answer about emspecial.c.  The cast wasn't there when I
gave up maintainership :).

Best,
karl

Well, it will have to fix it because :
- this option is not active by default; I run regularly the trip test,
it never came to my mind to run it with this option active
- this option is useful when you are writing the document (however, it
is not meant to be active for compiling the final .dvi file)
- tex engines are distributed for years now with it
- it seems very difficult to change the banner lines without changing
eTeX files that are copyrighted.

If anybody has a better solution, please speak up.

Let's count:
- introducing three additional change files,
- modifying tex.ech and tex.pch
- modifying etex.mk, pdftex.mk, pdfetex.mk
I can now do

$ ./pdfetex -src --progname=pdfelatex small2e
This is eupdfeTeX, Version 3.14159-1.00a-pretest-20011114-ojmw-2.1 (Web2C 7.3.7)
Source specials enabled.
