Subject: CD TeX Live bug report
Message-ID: <200201081522.QAA12982@gemini.fav.zcu.cz>


Hello,

I have a few bug reports concerning the TeX Live 6 CD:

1) in install-cd.sh I selected "Support for Czech/Slovak"; after the
   installation procedure completes, the file
   texmf/tex/generic/config/language.cz.dat is present, but skhyph.tex
   mentioned within this file is missing.

   The creation of latex.fmt etc. then fails; the following message
   appears in texmf-var/texconfig.log:

   ! I can't find file `skhyph.tex'.

   To copy the file skhyph.tex from the CD ROM solves the problem.

2) I tried to install the TeX Live 6 on my Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 system
   (kernel version 2.0.34) and found that most of the binaries fail
   with a SEGFAULT. TeX Live versions 4 and 5 run OK on the same
   system and TeX Live 6 runs OK on Debian 2.2.

   Since the binaries are compiled without debugging info, I could not
   trace them. I guess that the problem is a mismatch of the shared
   library interface.

   It would be helpful if prerequisites for running the TeX Live on
   Linux were listed in a readme. 

3) It would be also nice to note that a c++ compiler & libraries are
   necessary to compile the sources (or better, the configure script
   should warn that no c++ compiler was found and disable compiling
   pdftex and friends).

Your sincerely

Dear TeX users:

I need to add the LaTeX package of Elsevier  to TeX Live 6 software 
installed on my computer (PC/Windows2000). I have found the package on the 
TeX catalog online website but I need to know where to download it on my 
hard drive and whether I need to do anything in addition (like updating 
some information on the disk, etc.). I would be grateful if anybody can 
help me with this problem.

Thank you,

I recently attempted to install the TL6 on hpux 11.00. When we attempt to
use latex, it gives the following error message:
fatal: memory exhausted (xmalloc of 648256 bytes).
Error: `tex -ini -fmt=latex -progname=latex latex.ini' failed

fmtutil: Error! Not all formats have been built successfully.

This is a summary of all `failed' messages:
`tex -ini -fmt=latex -progname=latex latex.ini' failed
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.3.1)
**q
I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!

I'm somewhat confused since we have ~2GB of memory on this processor. (The
machine is an 4 CPU N-class box.)

I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to circumvent the problem. I tried
using hugetex and received the same error.
I installed and performed this last test as root.


Thanks.

Best idea would be NOT to put it into the texlive tree which may be erases
by an update, but to put it into a private place or local place.

On unix like systems put it into 
	<whereeveryouinstalledtexlivethereisa..>texmf.local/tex/
and call mktexlsr. On windows - there must be something similar.

If you get a .sty/.tex file then copy those files straight to the
subdir, if you get .dtx/.ins then call tex on the .ins file which 
should produce .sty/.tex etc files. Read the install instructions.

Best wishes

Dear Simon:

Thank you for your email. At this point I was able to solve the problem 
with kind assistance of Cheryl Ponchin from AMS. I have used the installer 
and the solution was just to ignore the error messages and keep going with 
the "Next" buton. In the meantime I have another problem, this time with 
'windvi'. For some reason, the resolution of the image of the page on the 
screen is much worse than it used to be with the previous LaTeX package 
I've used earlier. When I print out the paper, the resolution is OK, 
although the fonts look somewhat different and not so neat as, again, they 
used to be. This problem is certainly unrelated to the Elsevier package but 
if you have any suggestions for me, I would be very grateful.

With best wishes,

Eugene

As, Eugene guessed correctly, it is more of a TeXLive problem than an

Before I start, a comment on the version of the Elsevier LaTeX
package: The current version is always on Elsevier's web site,
www.elsevier.com/locate/latex. I have not checked whether the TeXLive
repository has this latest version. I do know that CTAN is up to date.

There may be two ways to do it:

1. The user friendly way: Use the TeXLive installer, as you tried. I
    am not familiar with it, so I cannot comment on why it failed. I
    cannot even comment on whether it is able to add packages, but I
    assume it is.

2. The hard way: Move it to the right place and update the TeX file
    database. That is what I will try to describe here.

Try to find the root of the TeX installation. It may be at
C:\TeXLive\texmf, or similar. If not, you may search your disks for a
directory called texmf. Or you may go to the command line (sometimes
called a DOS box, although in Windows2000 all DOS has disappeared from
it), and give the command:

	kpsewhich --expand-var \$TEXMFMAIN

When you have found that, go to it, go into the subdirectory tex, then
latex, then make a directory elsevier, and put the files there. Then
go up again to the texmf directory, and give the command

	  mktexlsr .

or go to the TeXLive installer and try to find an option 'update
filename databases' and activate it.

Some people will argue that it is not wise to install additional
packages in this place, which is the system tree. Indeed, it would be
better to install it in the local tree, which can be found with the
command

	kpsewhich --expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL

if it exists. But if you find that too complicated, the above is good
enough.

Please, send further questions to my office address
s.pepping@elsevier.nl.

Message-ID: <20020129164717.GV15050@spqr.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

The time has come to start TeX Live 7. I propose as
follows, but I am very open to suggestions:

TIMETABLE:
 January/February: work in Perforce source.development tree
                   to get source compilable on all platforms
 late February:    semi-freeze and transfer to Perforce source tree
 early March:      assemble all binaries and scripts
 March:            complete update of all texmf packages
 April 1st:        alpha releases of CD
 May:              maybe release

RELEASE CONDITIONS:
 * Omega must be new release, and stable
 * source must be in sync with teTeX, or better
 * Mac OSX must work
 * dvips must be stable

WORK:
I shall do the texmf tree and coordinate the release, but
I do not have time to work on any of:

 * getting source clean and compilable
 * updating install scripts
 * anything with documentation
 * rationalizing packages
 * any new facilities
 * liaising with anyone who wants to distribute the CD

so we need people who want to help with any of the above. For
anyone unused to my rude behaviour, please note that I cannot
realistically respond to anything along the lines of:

 * why don't you do X
 * I can do Y if you show me how
 * Z is broken please fix it

as I simply have no time available. what I *can* do is incorporate
other people's work.....

hey ho, here we go

John announced that a release should be in February, hope that THIS
time it will hold ;-) Are the current changes in the omega cvs
already in the tex-live perforce tree? John did the last changes
AFAIS some time ago?

>  * getting source clean and compilable

I can check:
i386/linux with glibc-2.1 (suse 6.4 updated)
i386/linux with glibc-2.2 (debian woody))
(alpha/linux with glibc-2.1 (redhat))
alpha/linux with glibc-2.2 (debian woody)

For all but the redhat I can produce binaries.

They need to be added to the PKGS variable in configure.in.

texdoctk will become part of teTeX (beginning with the next beta).

I'll try to get a stable teTeX out. We need a stable web2c release before
that, however.

In addition to taking care of teTeX, I can try to help in case of big
trouble...

And of course I'll try to do my part.  My main constraint would be to
make sure dvips gets enough testing through alpha/beta releases, and
for that, I'd be happy to freeze dvips at any point.  There remain
about four things I think are fairly important to look at in dvips,
none of them super important, and I'll do what I can to get them
looked at as quickly as possible, but if anyone plans a test release
and wants to put in the latest dvips, please let me know your

teTeX is currently in beta status and I'd put in almost any experimental
stuff that you give me :-)

I havent checked for a month or so, but yes, the TeXLive

excellent! I think we can start the checking process quite
soon, but if we have a set of people who can run compiles
quickly and regularly, it helps a lot.

note the lack of that in my preconditions. for good or bad,
TeXLive has a history of being slightly less stable than teTeX
and web2c, primarily because it has deadlines which you and Olaf
don't have to deal with.

so while I want the TL7 source to be good, I have to be pragmatic
and go ahead with as good as we can get in March....

One of the things that makes me happy is seeing this renewed
interest in fixes for dvips. I think many many people will be
very happy to find the work going in here!

The renewed interest in fixes for dvips is 100% enabled by your
support of the perforce tree, so much of the credit goes to you.
I cannot express how thankful I am for this.

A major reason I slacked off so much is that I had no good way
to develop, debug, and distribute dvips patches for all the
various distributions.  So Sebastian, take a large bow.

Tom Kacvinsky has also provided the lion's share of the effort
by understanding the issues better than I do, organizing tests
and discussing possible fixes using AIM.  He gets a case of beer
too.

Not to slight anyone else, of course, such as those who submit
patches and discuss things by email, but these two are major
heros and deserve all the recognition in the world.

feeling in a good mode (I had a sauna), I just
put the Perforce TeXlive source tree in sync with
the development tree, put new Linux binaries in place,
and updated pool and fmt files. Any of you keeping
up to date with Perforce should do a sync.

Anyone doing source changes themselves should keep
working in source.development, I'll do the 
integrating of source.

next, the 50 packages waiting to texmf-ed.

the TL7 sources in Perforce are now almost entirely
in sync with teTeX current beta, and I intend to keep it that way
if I can. 

NOTES
 - dvips is being changed by Tom R now, so I have obviously left that alone
 - hopefully, any problems can now be reported to Thomas for
    resolution, rather than this release of TeXlive diverging
    again
 - TL has many/some programs which teTeX doesnt, so we have
    to debug those separately (the MacOSX issues with dvipdfm, for instance)
 - pdftex is being updated by Fabrice Popineau, and by Martin Schroeder,
    so we can expect these to change soon. Olaf and Thomas will
    likely follow this quickly anyway
 - I haven't tested that this now works :-}

Btw: I just noticed that USE_CROPBOX was 0 in pdftoepdf.cc (and
fixed that), meaning that all recent versions of pdftex only use
/MediaBox when including pdfs. Didn't anybody read the comment
before that? :-)
