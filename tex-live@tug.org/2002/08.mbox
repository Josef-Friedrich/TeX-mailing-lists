Subject: [tex-live] HPUX binary?
Message-ID: <68055DB0C669D511818600805FBBDCAD2C6B18@POP-EXCHANGE>

Is it likely that an HPUX binary will be available for TeXLive 7?  I have
been using the TeXLive 5 binary for 10.20 without any problems, but was
hoping to upgrade. ( I am still using HPUX 10.20.)

I asked this this question a week ago and the answer I got was that HPUX
binaries isn't on TL 7 anymore. But you should be able to compile it
yourself. Haven't tried it though

sorry, unless someone comes forward and gives me an HP binary,
I have no plans to go and buy an HP box myself.

installing packages under Solaris is 100% identical
to installing them under Linux

I found a very helpful web page via google:

Following its advice and deleting the system environment
variable TEXMFCNF and the bogus config file
c:\TeX\texmf-var\web2c\texmf.cnf seems to have TeX back on
its feet again,from both the DOS prompt and the cygwin
prompt.

Do you mean the one installed by the TeXLive installer ? In this case
I'm afraid you deleted the wrong one. The problem with cygwin is that
it comes with its own version of teTeX (afaik) and there is a
conflict.

Cygwin does indeed come with its own tex, but I don't think
that was the issue. The TeXlive installer installed at least
two texmf.cnf files, one in texmf/web2c and one in
texmf-var/web2c. They are wildly different (at least, diff
decided the simplest explanation of their differences was to
quote the whole files). Renaming the one in texmf-var to
something safe left me with a working installation. (Indeed,
perhaps I have two now!)

But it occurs to me now that when I was trying things out, I
wasn't aware that cygwin had installed its own tex. I may
indeed have jumped to the wrong conclusion.  Would it be
useful to you if I tried to investigate the problem further,
or are you not interested in supporting tetex with cygwin?

Probably  because one of them  was in binary  mode while the other one
was  in  text mode. Only   the first  few variables  (TEXMFMAIN, etc.) 
should be  different. The problem of working  with the texmf/  tree is
that you can't upgrade  easily. Any modification will  be lost  in the
future. Setting a copy of the config files in the VARTEXMF tree is the
easiest way to ensure your modifications will  be kept. Also, by using
a dedicated  texmf.cnf file in VARTEXMF,  I can make sure your various
texmf  trees (TEXMFMAIN, TEXMFLOCAL,   VARTEXMF)  point to  the  right
directories.

I can't support tetex with cygwin mainly because tetex should compile
out of the box under cygwin, or at least, such is the goal of
cygwin. The main problems I see with cygwin :
- complex to administrate (path, quoting, drives), not Windows
oriented and very unfriendly to Windows users
- much more weird, it tries to emulate Unix calls, but sometimes at
the price of slowness; it is the case especially for the stat() call, 
which is heavily used by kpathsea. 

This latter reason alone would refrain me to use cygwin and make me
prefer to switch to some native version of the programs.

Even if you put things in texmf-local?

THat's true, but it is also somewhat intentional, I guess:
it is designed to be friendly to unix users, hence
necessarily will be unfriendly to windows users.

I'm using the TeXLive binaries from a cygwin
shell. Presumably I am not suffering from cygwin's stat()
when I do so? (I hope!)

I was talking about texmf/web2c/*.cnf configuration files which are
not in texmf-local/ .

If you are certain to use TeXLive .exe files, that's ok. There is a
remaining issue : I wonder how texlive win32 binaries will handle the
strange way cygwin has (or had ?) to specify paths with drives.

As long as you mount the cygwin drives so the absolute paths are
the same as under windows, fptex (texlive6, not tried 7 yet) works very
nicely under cygwin. 

the one thing I've missed (if it could be added easily) is that
texlive's tex doesn't follow cygwin symbolic links which isn't a
surprise but it would be nice if it could be done, I think they
end up looking like a windows "shortcut" to a native windows app.

Still is strange, but I make it not an issue by keeping all
my personal files in "My Documents" anyway. It is easier to
make that my cygwin home directory than to make all windows
apps hunt around in an odd cygwin location.

Interesting point. I agree that it could be nice if kpathsea was aware
of such thing. By the way, NTFS supports hard links, but there is no
command to create them :-)

I always seems to get into trouble with pdflatex and including pictures.

the stack size always seems to be too small

Isn't there some kind of option that manually alters the stack size or
pool size or what ever it called.


tex, latex, pdflatex and pdftex all hands out the same help message.

I'm using TeXLive 7

I think I'd be suspicious of the source of this.  
when I see

 \@lduseb@x #1->\@lduseb@x {#1

it looks to me like recursion....

"input stack size" isnt one of the changeable things at present.

Subject: [tex-live] L2H for texlive
Message-ID: <1y993x9m.fsf@supelec.fr>

I have put a standalone version of the current latex2html version
here:

ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/0.6/support/latex2html-2K.1-win32.zip

Installation is simple: 
1 - unzip it at the root of your TeXLive installation,
2 - make sure you have both gswin32c.exe and netpbm in your PATH
3 - use it.

I'd like to hear about it. I have successfully converted a few
documents. 

I have encountered an old problem: if for some reason, an
image fails to be converted, then it seems that images can be
referenced in a random way (they do not occur at their right
place). Is this a known problem ?

As soon as I have some report about it, yes. It should even work without
perl : I have compiled texexpand, pstoimg and latex2html thanks to the
ActiveState perl compiler. I'll try to make further tests.

Excellent.
Is it sufficiently stable that I should put a link to it
on the LaTeX2HTML mailing list site ?

Yes.
This happens when one image is too large (vertically) for
the page size used when making images using LaTeX etc.
TeX gives you a blank page then puts the large image on the next
page. All subsequent pages are then out by one,
causing the images to be wrongly placed.

One solution is to use a larger $PAPERSIZE setting.


All the best

Nevertheless I would like to get the image (or the original CD). How
can I obtain them, apart from waiting for TeX Live 8?

The search path for pool files is determined the following way:
  1) neither TEXPOOL nor TEXMFINI are set, thus using
       TEXPOOL=$TEXFORMATS
     from texmf.cnf
  2) TEXFORMATS envvar overwrites texmf.cnf setting thus expands
     to ~/newfmt:

The problematic thing is this
  TEXPOOL = $TEXFORMATS
in texmf.cnf. Make it
  TEXPOOL = .;$TEXMF/web2c
and the problem will disappear.

This should be fixed in TeX Live. Sebastian?

Hello.

Just a short note to tell you that every README*html (and localized versions) 
is unreadable on  CD2 (Unix) of TeX Live 7 distribution, because of missing 
"usergrps" directory (which fortunately exists on CD1).

This directory includes the stylesheet of these README which, consequently, 
are not displayed by netscape 4.x (but they are with NS6 and Mozilla).

Regards and thank you for this job.

For pdflatex, convert your figures to .pdf using eps2pdf
script (it uses ghostscript, so you have to have it installed
and properly configured). There is a possibility to
convert (not use directly) .eps graphics on the fly, too.

Do not specify extensions in the file, macros will use
appropriate version.

Maybe too old RH libraries, try using ldd /path/to/xdvi.bin
I do CC: to experts on texlive list.

As a bug-fix, here two files which should replace the files of the
same name in the TeX-Live tree.

When is the deadline for the next TeXLive CD?  I will then send a
complete update of the CJK stuff (especially documentation files).

I am copying your message to the TeX Live email list, to which you
should definitely subscribe.

All of the information about TeX Live ISO images, face art, and so on
are discussed here.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 7 installation on WinXP
Message-ID: <Pine.HPP.3.95.1020821141345.29381A-100000@aragorn.imf.au.dk>

Did anyone get the new TeXLive 7 installed on a WinXP system? 

I did it succesfully on a linux system (my best LaTeX system ever) but now
I'm installing it on WinXP for a friend and here we have some problems.

We just chose the generic full installation, but now when we run latex
fil.tex it says it can't find the latex.fmt file.

Usually when I want the ls-R database updated I just use texhash but that
resolves also in some problems, it says some $TEXMFCONF (or something like
that) wasn't pointing to correct dir.

Any ideas on how to solve this.


I think for the time being I'll just install TL 6 instead I know that one
works well on WinXP

Hoye,

When Itry to mount the TexLive CD I get this error:

# Aug 21 18:24:18 blade hsfs: NOTICE: hsfs: Warning: file system mounted
on /cdrom/new
Aug 21 18:24:18 blade does not conform to the ISO-9660 specification:

Subject: [tex-live] L2H / win32 / TeXLive
Message-ID: <4rdl6yh9.fsf@supelec.fr>

I'm uploading a ready to run version of LaTeX2HTML 2002-2 for
TeXLive/Windows users. All you need to do is :

- get 
ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/0.6/support/netpbm-10.8-win32.zip
ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/0.6/support/latex2html-2002-2-win32.zip
- unzip netpbm somewhere and add netpbm\bin to your PATH
- unzip latex2html _at the root_ of your texlive installation
(c:\TeXLive or whatever)
- ensure ghostscript gswin32c.exe is on your PATH
- that's all. You can run 'latex2html <option> foo.tex'.

Perl is not needed  to run this version  of latex2html, because it has
been compiled   into .exe  programs  thanks  to the   ActiveState Perl
compiler.

Note: that will work only with a TeXLive/fpTeX setup. It is using
kpsewhich.exe to automagically locate various files. 

Please report any problem and suggestions,

Greetings,

I'm a TUG member and I received TEX Live 7.  My operating system is
Sun's Solaris 2.8.
Will Disk 2 work under  2.8. Years ago I installed Web2c on an other Sun
under Solaris 2.6.
If Disk 2 won't work , what should I do?

Yes it will. I am running Solaris 2.7 binaries from CD-2 
under Solaris 2.8 myself.

Sure, but let me know where they have put the documentation
files. Either I am blind or they have disappeared from the
distribution ...

Subject: [tex-live] A bug in the fonts
Message-ID: <vg0elcevjwj.fsf@frodo.imf.au.dk>

Well, it is probably not a real bug but it annoys me nonetheless.

First a quote from Donald Knuth himself
(http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cm.html):

  Many characters were improved in 1992, notably the arrows, which now
  are darker and have larger arrowheads, so that they don't disappear so
  easily after xeroxing. But most of the changes are rather subtle
  compared to the dramatic improvement in the lowercase delta. In fact,
  the old delta was so ugly, I couldn't stand to write papers using that
  symbol; now I can't stand to read papers that still do use it.

The arrows of the Computer Modern fonts in the TeX Live 7 distribution
seem to be the old, thin, and ugly ones from before 1992.

Here is some TeX code.

  % The delta is right, but the arrow is wrong. Compare with "Computers
  % and Typesetting", "Computer Modern Typefaces" pp. 148 and 464. (My
  % book is from the Millennium Boxed Set and has ISBN 0-201-13446-2).

  $\delta\rightarrow$

  \end

When I have run the code through pdfeTeX, the log file contains

  This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.14159-1.00b-pretest-20020211-2.1 
  (Web2C 7.3.7x) (format=pdfetex 2002.7.31)  31 AUG 2002 22:38
  entering extended mode
  **ah.tex
  (./ah.tex{/home/TeX/texmf-var/pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg} [1{/home/TeX/texmf-var/
  dvips/config/pdftex.map}] )</home/TeX/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/cmr10.pfb></

  luesky/cm/cmmi10.pfb>
  Output written on ah.pdf (1 page, 7385 bytes).

You can find the generated pdf file at

  http://home.imf.au.dk/emil/ah.pdf

I get the same delta and the same arrow if I run the code through TeX
as I do with pdfeTeX. I hope this is just a customization problem, and
I hope also that you can help me.

Emil Hedevang Lohse

I have noticed that there is a disadvantage of this version compared to
netpbm-9 that comes with TeXLive 7: it does not bring documention in DVI
and HTML form.

You're right, they are not at the distribuition. You'll find the HTML
files at:

http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/
