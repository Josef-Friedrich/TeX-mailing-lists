booktabs does not have a suitable license for inclusion 
on TeX Live, I am afraid.

is there no way around this problem?? A lot of people would be missing
that file.

I know that the author has vanished, say if he's dead than the booktabs
package just have to be forgotten or what??

sorry, its too late for TeX Live. anyone who wants packages with non-free
licenses has to obtain them individually.

well, actually, he has now finally been contacted, and the package
can reappear. but yes, if he died the package would be frozen
with the copyright statement he left in it, I guess. 

I know this all sounds ridiculous, but this is the rule we chose
to play by several years ago. TeX Live claims to conform to the
Debian free software guidelines, and I have to follow that
once a problem has been found. Of course, all of TeX Live has NOT
been checked properly, and I am sure you can find a bad package
quite quickly, but in the case of booktabs the problem was caught
in teTeX, so I had to act.

If you choose the wrong or no license: Yes. Apparently booktabs
is neither GPL nor LPPL. :-(

good enough, we'll just have to remember telling people what to do when
they complain about the package not being there

but ofcourse we should be going towards the free software guidelines
perhaps some people should be looking into the other packages in order to
tjeck whether or not they have the right license

A lot of helpful work has been done for teTeX already, which
obviously we follow.  The problem hopefully gets smaller each year...

Robin has succeeded in contacting the author a few days ago. He (the
author) promissed to rerelease booktabs with a suitable license.

So I suppose that, if I were able to write a perl script that could find
all bad packages, and brought the result to your attention, the texlive
team could be in serious trouble?

I must have said something wrong!! I have not the faintest plan in that
direction, I just wanted to say that if you remove everything not
satisfying the rule, you might end up with a texlive that could be a lot
less interesting than it is now.
And if you then would like to continue anyway, there would be lots of
work to do to reach the original authors and apply their license
corrections. Hence my use of the term "serious trouble".

Its hard to tell how many packages are iffy. We have been doing
this over the last few years, and the campaign to clean up
licensing has resulted in many many changes.  I am more
optimistic than not.

Message-ID: <F309hV9ysMg5awg8UMT0000ce24@hotmail.com>

Hi, 

I am just starting using winshell. I am having trouble understanding the role of projects and how exactly, step-by-step to work with them, without getting complaints from winshell, like "there are no files in the project", "cannot be loaded". Their behavior seems somewhat random to me. Sometimes, I am not sure under which conditions, I have to restart winshell to make it run. Can you help me understand this?
In your readme file, you say: "Much of the documentation can be viewed online (before the TeX system is actually installed)." Somehow, I missed that during the installation. Can I see a detailed guide without going through the installation process again? Can I see the complete documentation anywhere?

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,

Iosif Pinelis

Dear TeX Live Team,

my name is Ado Haarer, I am the TeX coordinator at the Leibniz-
Rechenzentrum in Munich/Germany, which is the computing center
for the universities of Munich.

I am very interested in redistributing the TeX Live CDs to
the departments and students of these universities, but I am
not absolutely sure whether I am allowed to do this. The
"Copying conditions for TeX Live7" (www.tug.org/license.html)
say that "all the material contained on the CD may be freely
used and copied". But am I also allowed to copy and redistribute
the complete CDs?

I am looking forward to your answer!

Best regards,

Yes, you are. But I would suggest that you try instead
to go through the German TeX Users Group (Dante), as they
already press lots of copies, and we strongly encourage people
who get the CD to support these groups.

Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.20020711123641.00ef7f20@multipop.t-online.de>

Hallo,

for text with Sanskrit diacritical marks I need to print an i with macron
(bar) on top, but without the dot on the i.

The TeX command is

\={\i} 

which works fine with CM-fonts. It also works with Postscript-fonts

* with latex in other distributions than TeXLive (I tried 6b and 7),
  i.e. it works fine in MikTeX an teTeX, which I tried
* with pdflatex in TeXLive

In TeXLive, using PS-fonts and latex (not pdflatex) gives just the macron
on top, but the basic i is missing! The command \=i works, but it prints
the i with the dot, which is typographically wrong.

Maybe someone could try it out and verify ... Sebastian was so kind to
compile a test file, but I think he only used pdflatex and not latex -> dvi.

Thanks
Christof

I just compiled a test file with \={\i}, converted it to ps
using dvips and it is ok. I suspect that your dvips is failing to map
the correct glyph. Send me your dvi file, and also try to run:

dvips -d 64 foo -o

to list all the files read and report about it.

This looks like a problem with the t1mapper in xdvi. I can't see
another reason.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0207111328310.21345-100000@valen.cc.utexas.edu>

Neither the texmf/doc/tldoc documentation (live.pdf) nor the README files, 
nor the internal documentation mention the fact that the install script 
makes assumptions about the umask in the environment from which it is run, 
and invoked with a umask of, say, 077, install-cd.sh does not make 
necessary corrections when copying files so that the directories will have 
the execute bit set, which later causes problems when setting up the fonts 
and everything.

Either inserting the line 'umask 22' at the top of install-cd.sh or 
mentioning the issue of file permissions in the install instructions would 
probably save some headaches and confusion somewhere down the line.

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 7 received, kudos!
Message-ID: <3D335896.DA854007@teleport.com>

I am pleased to note the arrival of the TeX Live 7 CD-ROM set in the
post today. I expect that TUG members will have received theirs soon.
Those LUGs who have ordered TeX Live shortly will have received theirs
as well.

This is the first 2002 TUG member benefit to be delivered, and I trust
that TUG members will find it useful.

I am pleased to see the appearance of support for Macintosh computers,
and note with approval the inclusion of a TeX Friendly Zone card showing
the TUG office address and incorporating a suggestion to pass the CD
along to a friend.

My great thanks to the TeX Live team for their work in creating the TeX
Live 7 CD-ROM set, and to Robin Laakso for arranging its manufacture and
distribution. Congratulations and praise to all for a job well done!

It is interesting that
$>kpsewhich psfonts.map
gives, e.g.:
g:/TeX/texmf-var/dvips/config/psfonts.map
but
$>kpsewhich pdftex.map
cannot find the file pdftex.map in the same directory
kpsewhich --format=map pdftex.map gives the same.

  kpsewhich --format='dvips config' pdftex.map

The .map stuff is for the fontname maps, I think, e.g.
  kpsewhich adobe.map

Yup.

Like psfonts.map, we could hard-code pdftex.map in kpsewhich.

I consider pdftex.cfg even more important. While pdftex.cfg is hard-coded
into pdftex, pdftex.map is not. It is just a common configuration to
have pdftex.map configured for pdftex.

My suggestion is to add special cases for both: pdftex.map and pdftex.cfg.

pdftex.map would need aa special case (as far as the format is
concerned).

pdftex.cfg does not need a special case: .cfg is not a known suffix,
so we default to the kpse_tex_format anyway.  You "just" have to
remember that unless you use --progname=pdftex, the file will not be
in the search path.

Message-ID: <3D30A924.5040108@worldnet.att.net>




Hello:



Thank you for sending the TeXLive 7 CD.  Unfortunately, I was unable to get
the installation to work with my computer.   I found that I could run programs
from the

CD, but not from the HD install.  


The error dialog indicates a problem with the tex.dll file.

Even when attempting to run the latex.exe executable from the command
line,

the program would only produce this system error.  


     "no entry point found at ... <hex addr>... in tex.dll".


Another error I noticed in the log file had to do with kpsewhich,
which was

not to be found on the filesystem after installation.



Any hints to make TeXLive run from the hard drive?



regards,

   Charles Clark

Do you have other tex.dll on your system ? From a different texlive
version or from something else ?

If you ran the installer, then it should have created a file called
setup-*.log in "c:\Program files\texlive\texmf-var\web2c". Send me
this file please, and I can help a little bit more.

we don't have HP binaries any more, I am afraid. it should
be easy enough to compile yourself, though.

Subject: [tex-live] TeXLive 7 with cygwin
Message-ID: <200207231757.SAA09725@abacus.comlab>

Hello, folks. I've been trying to install TeXLive 7 on my
new laptop (running WinXP). The installation works fine; I
can use everything from the command prompt and from within
emacs. However, my cygwin isn't picking up the texmf
hierarchy. Does this sound familiar, or am I doing something
daft?

More detail: TeXLive 6 works fine with cygwin on my older
laptop (W2K), and I've tried to mirror the setup with the
new one. I haven't tried reverting to TeXLive 6 on my new
machine (or upgrading to TL7 on the old one).

>From the cygwin shell, I can "kpsewhich texmf.cnf" and I get
the right config file. However, I can't kpsewhich any of the
usual format files, and indeed running TeX etc fails because
the format file can't be found. 

One difference between my old and new config files is that
the new one uses SELFAUTOPARENT, but the old one
doesn't. However, hardwiring the root doesn't solve the
problem.

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Jeremy

I am afraid ArabTeX is not freely redistributable, so we cannot
include it on TeX Live. We only include packages which meet 
the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

try setting KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 and reading the voluminous output
to track what it is up to.

but the best answer is to throw away that Windows XP and use a real
operating system :-}

can you elucidate? what are the $FORMAT.ini-files you refer to

but you right, there should be an entry in texmf/aliases,

Dear TeXLive developers,

first of all I would like to send you many, many and many more
thanks. It is an amazing distribution.

Unfortunately, I found some problems:
- the documentation of my piechartmp package is
  installed at texmf/doc/latex/piechartmp. Since
  it is a MetaPost package, the doc-directory
  should be texmf/doc/metapost/piechartmp.

  The same applies to the source directory:
  texmf/source/latex/piechartmp/examples/ -->
  texmf/source/metapost/piechartmp/examples/

  But i would prefer when the examples directory
  is a sub-directory of the doc directory, i.e.
  texmf/doc/metapost/piechartmp/examples.

- the map files (pdftex.map, psfonts.map) do
  not include an entry for "logod10". Since
  all other logo-fonts are  included, it seems
  to be a bug for me.

- there seems to be a bug in the cm-super fonts.
  The font sfss0500 gives an ugly result. Compare
  cm-super and the ae alternative in the following
  LaTeX file:
%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document}
\tiny\sffamily This is a short sentence in cm-super.
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{aess}\sffamily
This is a short sentence using ae-fonts.
\end{document}
%

- not a bug more a suggestion: I would prefer when the
  texlive doc-dir texmf/doc/tldoc is named
  texmf/doc/texlive. This is more intuitive.

Regards,
  Jens

The installation was done from cd (I hope so). And I hope you are
still sane... :-))

If you can't reproduce it (try installing uk-english), forget it.

What you describe is not a bug, (but...) :

ae (virtual) fonts use cmr-7bits at driver level, and in ss family,
cmr-7bits does not exist at 500-design size, so 800 is used...

ec fonts 0500 design-size exists and is used in sffamily (tfm, mf, and/or
cm-super type1).

What may be compared is \tiny\sffamily with cm-super and with ec-family mf
fonts (suppress or comment the entry in the map for testing) : it will be
the same (and may be ugly, yes...).

You could also try this (just for a test, if you want it for a constant
usage, better to define a new family) :

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{cmss}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{cmss}{m}{n}{
   <-9> ecss0800
   <9-10> ecss0900
   <10-12> ecss1000
   <12-17> ecss1200
   <17-> ecss1728
}{}
\begin{document}
\tiny\sffamily This is a short sentence in cm-super.
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{aess}\sffamily
This is a short sentence using ae-fonts.
\end{document}

ahh. okay, now i see.

hmm, i agree that the ec fonts a similar to the cm-super. Thus i see
that it is not a bug. but still i cannot understand that sfss0600 and
sfss0500 should be fonts from the same font family. but here it not
the place to discuss this.

Thanks.

Well, if you restrict "special case" to setting the default format,
you are right. If you extend the meaning of "special case" also to the
default progname, you are not.

I am used to pass options to kpsewhich, so I am not the right person
to ask. But, maybe, it would make sense to set progname for some special
filenames, too.

Point taken -- but this does make the default behaviour more and more
special-cased and complicated.  Most TeX-like, I suppose.

I'm beginning to appreciate that, but do you have a better
solution? I don't think putting a "proper" OS on the laptop
is an option - it's a new Sony, complete with onboard video
camera etc, and I bet there aren't any linux drivers
yet. Besides, the last two times I tried installing linux, I
promised myself I'd never do it again on a recent machine. 

However, I also don't want to dispense with the shell (I can
run latex and close friends from within emacs, but what
about metapost, makeindex, psnup, etc etc), and nor do I
want to have to suffer under the MS command prompt.

And of course it is extremely useful to have grep and the

sorry, I cannot reproduce the problem. perhaps the CD pressing
went bad? a "bzip2 -t" on my original gives no errors.

you can grab the source.tar.bz2 from any CTAN host. thats
probably the fastest way to proceed.

I fear to change an established name, though I agree it is not good.
perhaps later.

This may be a repeated message.

I have been using TeX-Live 7 for several weeks and all seems fine; 
I installed it from the cdrom I received from TUG.  

Today, when reading Heiko Oberdiek's proposed upgrade to pdfTeX map
file manipulation (07/30/02), I decided to look at the source evidently
in source/TeX/texk/web2c/pdftexdir.  However, I cannot succeed with the
bunzip2 program on the source.tar.bz2 file.  I have copied the file to 
two different linux file systems with the same result.   The recovery
program indicates that several files are faulty.   

I would like to read the original mapfile.c; which file is it in 
within source.tar.bz2?   Second, how can I secure a non-faulty 
copy of TeX-Live-7?   

Many thanks in advance.
