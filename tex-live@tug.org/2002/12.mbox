CJKTeX from the 20021117 image seems to work, thanks.
I will do some more testing later.

As a temporary measure, what about making available some tools to
convert a TeXLive package into a Debian one? I understand you have
such a tool ready (I don't remember the source of this information,
perhaps Fabrice in Bachotek).

This is especially important for CJKTeX, because the Japanese support
in the Debian package is broken, probably from the very beginning, as
the maintainer seems to be interested only in Chinese.

This is also quite urgent for me, because a student of mine is just
finishing his work on a Knoppix/Debian CD, and such a tools would
allow him to include easily a working CJKTeX and other goodies not
available as Debian packages.

Best regards

I used to have a partial tool, but I lost it. I wish
I could reconstruct it. The theory is OK, but the practice is not.

if anyone listening knows more about making Debian packages than me,
I'd love to hear from them

I have bought the book by Christian Rolland "Latex par la pratique",
éditions O'Reilly. Inside is a CD containing Texlive 6b (09/2001).

After having installed Latex, I cannot compile a file and get the following
messages :

Files : fancybox.sty  minitoc.sty picins.sty pstricks.sty pst-node.sty
pst-plot.sty pst-text.sty subfigure.sty not found.

These files seem not to be in your Latex distribution. Where are they ? And
how to dowload and install them ?

I have now a last question : how to get Foiltex ?

I apologize for my bad english.

Thank you for your answer.

Start->Programs->TeXLive->Maintenance->Add Package
should do it, provided your cdrom is available.
The package to add is PSTricks in the tex-pictures (?) collection.

It's a pity.

Unfortunately, I know less than you :-(.

I intend to experiment with checkinstall (unstable), which is supposed
to create a package by watching the changes done during an
installation, but I am too busy for it now.

I am afraid that I no longer remember anything about emTeX
or prthplj, and DOS is not one of the systems we support
with TeX Live.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10212070906450.11231-100000@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I am the TeX editor for an online journal.  The editor-in-chief has a
problem with TL7 that he has not been able to extirpate.  It seems (after
quite a bit of activity on the comp.text.tex news group) that the problem
is something called
Source specials enabled.
(Line from his log files.)  The effect is that the definition
\def\subsection{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}{-3.2ex plus -1ex minus
 -.2ex}{-1em plus -1em minus -.4em}{\normalfont\normalsize\scshape}}
produces indented subsections.  Changing the third parameter from \z@ to
-\parindent cures the problem, but it forces him and me to have different
versions of our class file, which will cause endless problems.  

Between initex, Windedit, the configuration file, and the calling program,
something is invariably turning on these source specials and we have not
been able to figure out how to turn it off.  Also it is clearly buggy
since it should not be changing the subsection indentation in any case.
BTW, the \section definition is not affected.  Our definition is
\def\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{-4ex plus -1ex minus
-.2ex}{1.75ex plus .2ex}{\large}}

Please respond directly to me because I am not a subscriber to this list.

It can be turned on by default in either of these locations :

- texmf.cnf (find the right one, probably in $VARTEMXF/web2c)

% Allow TeX, eTeX, Omega to include `src:' specials in the dvi file.
% These specials are used by viewers to jump from the viewer into
% the editor at the right page/lineno.
% Possible values : none auto cr display hbox math par parend vbox
src_specials.pdftex = none
src_specials = auto

and comment both lines above.

- Look into your WinEdt configuration, unfotunately I'm of not help here
except that I have grep'ed among all WinEdt files (in c:\Program
Files\WinEdt Team\WinEdt\) and found a couple of occurences of the
'--src' string.

There doesn't seem to be a clean way to implement these specials. This
side effect will be removed with the next version.

Make that "release".  There's a lot of Windows work to do, so we'll
have to go to 7.4.1 at least.

I bumped the kpathsea version number to alert any shared-library users
to incompatibilties in the ABI.  And (bad habit) the kpathsea and
web2c version numbers are otherwise in sync.

I do have a request: a make clean that produces a true clean setup. The 
current setup may break if you do

	p4 sync
	make
	make clean
	p4 sync with earlier date
	make

because some of the generated stuff (the *extra files at least) are not 
removed by a make clean. At least it is dangerous because you are 
invisibly matching versions.

If you don't need the cjkutils, you can just do
  p4 sync
  (rm -rf /else/where; mkdir -p /else/where; cd /else/where;
  /texlive/Build/source.development/configure; make)
  p4 sync with earlier date
  (rm -rf /else/where; mkdir -p /else/where; cd /else/where;
  /texlive/Build/source.development/configure; make)

Once I have cleaned up the cjkutils part, the whole TeX Live can be build
outside the source tree.

pdftex 1.10a is ready whenever you are (and I think we should
couple the release with the new web2c). Nobody has reported any
serious problems with -RC1.

its a good request.... but its waiting on someone
willing to do the work! Nelson pointed the way
to find the scope of the problem.

So it seems for me that the last reported problem is considered as not
so serious? It means that pdftex goes far from the Than's work,
when it can crash on a simplest example using just pdftex's primitives.
Or, I'm wrong, and it is already corrected (in such case pdftex cannot be
called 1.10a-RC1).

Message-ID: <Pine.HPX.4.50.0212171039580.14103-100000@aragorn.imf.au.dk>

I noticed that there aren't that many documentation files in the /doc dir
in TeXLive 7. Anyway I have had to run LaTeX on several .dtx filen form
the source dir, in order to get the documentation/information I needed.

I was just woundering if there existed some form of tool that would
actually do this for every .dtx file in the /source dir and place the .dvi
files in the /doc structure.

It's also because the casual user doesn't know anything about .dtx files.
And whenever he or she wants some information they'll go to the /doc
directory and in a lot of cases there aren't any information there. They
need to latex the sources themselfs.

This is not a very good solution. I know there is limited room on the CD,
but I think it would be nice if such a tool was present, to be used by
those who install on their harddisk.

As it is now texdoc (on my system, maybe I did something wrong) usually
just gives me the HTML version (from CTAN) which is of no practical use.

ideas?

I used to run .dtx files to .dvi, but I ran out of space

it doesn't need a tool. just

cd $WHEREVER/texmf/doc
for i in `find . -name "*.dtx"`
do
 latex $i
 latex $i
done


I appreciate your point; but unless I made the installation
do the above, I am not sure what to do.

casual users might well find latex'ed .dtx files forbidding anyway

I recommend texdoctk, by the way, instead of texdoc

texdoc{tk} could generate the documentation on-the-fly if it
doesn't exist yet. Of course this should be optional as it might
confuse the casual user.

    I do have a request: a make clean that produces a true clean setup. 

This is what make distclean is for, is it not?  Didn't we just have this
discussion?

	p4 sync
	make
	make clean
	p4 sync with earlier date

make clean isn't intended to work in this situation.  make clean is
intended to just remove the stuff done by a normal make, not including
configuration.  Since the configuration stuff is certainly likely to be
different between one date and another ...

So I don't think the *extra.c files are the only problem.  Whether those
should be deleted at clean or distclean is arguable; I chose distclean
long ago, but if you feel like moving them to clean, it's a trivial
change.  I don't have the current source, but it would be something like:

Old:
distclean::
	test ! -r lib/Makefile \
	  || for d in $(all_subdirs); do (cd $$d && $(MAKE) $@); done
	rm -f *.pool *extra.c *.fm

New:
	rm -f *extra.c
distclean::
	test ! -r lib/Makefile \
	  || for d in $(all_subdirs); do (cd $$d && $(MAKE) $@); done
	rm -f *.pool *.fm

But I doubt this is enough, because what about tangleboot, not to
mention the .p files, etc., etc.

The *extra.c files are removed with "make clean" these days.

By the way, Akira Kakuto was kind enough to poiint out some bugs in my
new code (too much haste...)  You'll want to apply these changes in
any case.

I just have submitted the changes for web2c-7.4.1 into the perforce tree.

In the announce of Olaf's new release, he wrote:
  Also, John Plaice has given me what should be the "final" omega 1.23.2
  sources to bundle.
So, I also have updated a few omega related files in the perforce tree
to get it "in sync" with the other sources (Olaf's and mine).

With this release, we are close to the next stable system, I think.

Message-ID: <20021221062906.A7346@verso.st.jyu.fi>

It is possible to create CD-ROM, that has both Rock Ridge- and
Joliet-extensions. So why don't you do so when creating TeX Live?

AFAIK, the TeX Live CDROMs have both rockridge and joliet extensions.
(i.e. both -r and -J options of mkisofs are used)

Why do you think that it doesn't use these extensions?

Best,

Subject: [tex-live] texinfo problems (again)
Message-ID: <0DEEEE1D-153A-11D7-AD68-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

I ran a p4 sync -f even to try to solve this, but so far no luck. I  
cannot compile TeX Live anymore. See below. I do not havem, nor do I  
intend to mess with auto* stuff on my system, so I depend on correct  
file dates in the perforce repository.

Since I have run a 'make distclean' once, I am in trouble. Whatever I  
do, I get stuck compiling in texinfo. Previously, Sebastian modified  
the stamps again in perforce and it was all OK.

It should be sufficient. If I take the original texinfo-4.3a distrib
and untar it locally, then I can build it without any auto* trouble.

I have no idea why this gets messed up every time and I hope that my
attempt to fix it really cured the problem.

What I did was the following:

  cd /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo
  p4 edit `find . -type f`
  for i in `find . -type f`; do
    touch -r /t/src/teTeX-src-beta/utils/texinfo/$i $i
  done
  p4 submit

My first test with
  rm -rf /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo
  p4 sync -f /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo/...
showed no problem to compile TL's texinfo.

Yes.

It has been fixed again.

BTW, I noticed that TL source.development is not at Web2C 7.4.1 while 
teTeX is. Is there any reason for that? I would like to distribute 
7.4.1 for testing in the Mac OS X community.

Hi Sebastian, hi list!

Should we/I start again building binaries for different architectures
(in my case linux-alpha) and putting them into Master/bin/... for TL8?

Not yet. At least wait for pdfTeX 1.10a

as Martin says, not yet. as soon as pdftex leaves RC status...

By the way, I am off to Portugal now for Christmas, back on January 3rd.
Be sure you all have a good holiday (if it fits your
local culture).

With many thanks to all those hardy folk who have done
so much for the TeX Live project during 2002.

I just have submitted change #2616 which changes the configure/make
stuff for cjkutils. Now, cjkutils are no longer build by "make extras".
Instead, these utils are build by the normal "./configure; make;
make install".

This change now allows us to compile all of TeX Live outside the source
directory (assuming that we use a make utility with a proper vpath
implementation such as GNU make). The "extras" target no longer builds
anything now (it just runs "strip").

I hope that I didn't break the functionality of the cjkutils (I have
no idea how to use/test them). All I have checked is that everything
compiles/installs fine on my system.

I updated, reconfigured, compiled and installed. The following now 
fails (and was ok previously in web2c 7.4.1):

fmtutil: attempting to create localized format using pool=pdftex-pl and 
tcx=il2-pl.
running `pdftex -ini  -translate-file=il2-pl -jobname=pdfmex-pl 
-progname=pdfmex-pl pdfmex.ini' ...
! I can't read pdftex.pool; bad path?

This is also true for all the other localized formats. The normal 
formats are generated OK.

Something must be wrong with your setup. In my configuration, fmtutil
properly finds pdftex-pl.pool and later fails because this localized
pool file is outdated.

My error message (which you should get, too) is:
  ! pdftex.pool doesn't match; tangle me again (or fix the path).

Of course, I'll update the localized pool files asap.

Yes, I noticed this, but what I do is pretty straightforward. I install 
with a PREFIX set to another directory. In the share/texmf/web2c 
directory there I find (after running install from my TL stuff):

-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  30638 Oct 24 02:28 etex-pl.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  28056 Dec 22 16:40 etex.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  22179 Dec 22 16:41 mf.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  24672 Dec 22 16:42 mp.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  30128 Dec 22 16:43 omega.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  37441 Oct 24 02:28 pdfetex-pl.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  34890 Dec 22 16:46 pdfetex.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  35515 Oct 24 02:28 pdftex-pl.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  33067 Dec 22 16:45 pdftex.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  28712 Oct 24 02:28 tex-pl.pool
-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  26233 Dec 22 16:47 tex.pool

As you can see, the translated pool files are pretty old. Note: I use 
the TL repository so if they are not updated there, they are not 
updated here. Note also that the pool files are found:

[dumbledore:share/texmf/web2c] gerben% kpsewhich --format='web2c files' 
pdftex.pool
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/web2c/pdftex.pool
[dumbledore:share/texmf/web2c] gerben% kpsewhich --format='web2c files' 
pdftex-pl.pool
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/web2c/pdftex-pl.pool

So, my guess was that the error message was misleading. Note that my 
PREFIX at install differs from the location where the files are when I 
actually run it:

At build-install time they go to 
/usr/local/Build/TeXLive.development/share/texmf/web2c

but when I use it they have been copied to

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/web2c

but since both locations do exist, I do not think a hard coded path 
might play a role here.

In other words, I am stymied ;-)

> Of course, I'll update the localized pool files asap.

Oh well, we'll see to this later. Just give me a sign when TL has been 
updated.

Frohe Weinachten und viel Spaß dauernd Sylvester,

you need to create FD files, e.g. t1mgs.fd and ot1mgs.fd which will
make the fonts known to latex. also note that you described the fonts
in the map file as having T1 encoding, while you tried to use them in
your latex file in OT1 encoding. so either you have to create
(virtual) fonts for OT1 encoding too, or use the fonts only with
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Best,
v.

This worked.

How does one create these virtual fonts?

then, ot1mgs.fd doesn't contain \DeclareFontShape{OT1}{mgs}{m}{n}
definition, and LaTeX falls back to the default font shape.

these don't have to be virtual fonts - they may be either plain TFM
files, or virtual fonts (TFM+VF). The latter are required only if your
type1 fonts do not contain all needed glyphs in one font file needed
to represent all glyphs in TeX font encoding (e.g. OT1 or T1).

you can make TFM (or virtual) fonts out of AFM files (which can be
created from truetype fonts e.g. by ttf2afm) with the help of afm2tfm,
and a more powerful approach is to use fontinst...

Best,
