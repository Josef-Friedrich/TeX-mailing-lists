As the correspondence below indicates, Martin needs to pick up the EPS
files for the TeX Live face, but the links that once worked no longer do
so. Could someone please help here?

Kaja, you are list admin: would you please subscribe Martin to the list;
obviously he should be a participant since he appears to be in charge of
CsTUG's manufacturing efforts.

    files for the TeX Live face, but the links that once worked no longer do
    so. Could someone please help here?

Did we really have / do we really want the entire tl tree available
under http?  I don't mind either way.
Anyway, I made these url's work (no /tlprod/ in them):

http://www.tug.org/texlive/packaging/TL7_disk1.eps
http://www.tug.org/texlive/packaging/TL7_disk2.eps
http://www.tug.org/texlive/packaging/TL7_lion.eps

    Kaja, you are list admin: would you please subscribe Martin to the list;
    obviously he should be a participant since he appears to be in charge of
    CsTUG's manufacturing efforts.

I'd be happy to add Martin if he wants, but 90+% of the traffic on
texlive is people asking for help and/or the workers discussing
technical issues, not anything related to manufacturing, so I'm not sure
it's really a good idea.  Presumably all the manuf.'s care about is one
msg per year saying "here's the iso image and here are the cover images"?

Subject: [tex-live] Problems with mathbbol/bbold14
Message-ID: <20020903095400.GA25236@phya33.Physik.Uni-Bielefeld.DE>

Hello!

I have installed a full TeX live 7 distribution on a network
consisting of Compaq Tru64 Alpha workstations.

I've got massive problems when I try to latex the attached file
"test.tex", that uses the package "mathbbol". I'm not very deep into
the matter of fonts, but the source of the problems seems to be the
command

	mktextfm  bbold14

I've attached the (clipped) output of this command in the file
"bbold14.log".

The above example does work with teTeX 1.0, so it seems to me that
this is a bug somewhere deep in TeX live 7.

Any hints?

negative, or zero. So this comparison test won't be `true'.

Message-ID: <18d.d79d329.2aa76b6f@aol.com>

I have installed TeXLive6b (09/2001) on my hard disk. First I tried TeXLive7 
(6/2002) which did not work.My editor is WinEdt5. The system works fine well 
but I ave two small problems you could possibly help me to solve:

1. I would like to customize the LaTeX error function for WinEdt but I cannot 
find the file miktex.ini in which some changes should be made: 
Editor=WinEdt.exe"[Open(|%f|);SelPar(%l,7)]"

2. I would like to run WinEdt in the Background Execution Mode which works 
only with MikTeX2. Is TeXLive6b based on MikTeX2?

I was just wondering. Why it it that the texdoc script uses netscape by
standard if it has to preview .html files.

Causes a problem for me since I don't have Netscape installed, and it
would have been nicer if there was an option so that one could change the
html viewer manually (ofcourse I could just shange the script manually
...)

If you look at texdoc, you'll find the following comment:
  # Viewing programs, according to filename extension.  (You can
  # override or add to them by setting environment variables).
and later:
  : ${TEXDOCVIEW_html='netscape -remote openURL'"'(%s)'"' 2>/dev/null || netscape %s &'}

So, all you need to do is to set the environment variable TEXDOCVIEW_html
to whatever you need before starting texdoc.

Message-ID: <8E054E42-C16E-11D6-A70F-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

This question was asked on the Mac OS X TeX list. As I see it, this 
person runs against a 256 open files limit. Which is strange because I 
would guess that inlcuded files release their handles when they are 
included. His pdftex version will be

Is this a known possible problem? Have the source and/or 
source.development directories of TeX Live been updated since the 
release of TeX Live 7?

Thanks,

Known problem due to an 'optimisation' added in pdftex at some
point. I have removed it for the win32 version.

// Called when an image has been written and it's resources in
// image_tab are freed.  We cannot deallocate the PdfDocument yet, as
// future pages of the same document may be embedded. As an
// optimization, we do delete it if it's a one-page document.
void epdf_delete()
{

    // Akira Kakuto has suggested to make epdf_delete empty, so
#if 1
    PdfDocument *pdf_doc = (PdfDocument *) epdf_doc;
    xref = pdf_doc->xref;
    if (pdf_doc->doc->getCatalog()->getNumPages() == 1)
	delete_document(pdf_doc);
#endif
}

Change the '#if 0' to '#if 1' or remove the matchine #if/#endif pair.

No, it is based on fpTeX ...

By the way, TeXLive 7 should work on Windows XP (since I'm using it
myself). What kind of errors did you get ?

Given that this optimization results in a broken pdfTeX (some artificial 
limit on the number of pdf images you can include), I would suggest 
making this optimization not default.

Message-ID: <3BDD2390-C240-11D6-9380-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

My omega/lambda can create formats, but when I try to typeset a file it 
fails. I get an endless display on screen of [][][][][][]:

and I have to close the Terminal window to kill the process.

Support for omega/lambda is beyond my capabilities. I know others have 
been able to run it (other versions), but I just follow the official 
release from TeX Live. I have seen quite a bit of mail on different 
versions (1.15 vs 1.23 mostly) but as I am not even a user my means to 
solve this are pretty limited.

There is a test file I got from someone at 
ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/lamtest.tex (contains unicode)

Can somebody tell me what needs to be done to get this working?

Thanks,

G

PS. From some discussions I get the idea that omega/lambda is dead. Is 
that correct?

Ok, that makes sense, but it was not mentioned in the comments (or
maybe I read them to quickly).

However we do need a better fix.

Well, I currently run Omega 1.15 (from TeX Live 7, Indian Edition), and it 
works fine with your example. I'll try it with 1.23 and tell you.

Sebastian, do you have ISO images of the Indian edition available 
somewhere online?

Well, that's based on how you define dead. But no, there are more
interested people in omega that may let it die. We just (some volunteers)
had a meeting in Trivandrum with John Plaice and Chris Rowley, and we're
sorting mechanisms to (finally?) make Omega open, and stable, and
documented, and standard compliant, and ...

John has promised to post some white paper on Omega 1.\infty requirements
in a very short time. Let's see what comes out of it.

Sorry. A crash in

\pdfximage height 6cm {img.pdf}\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage

epdf_delete() was killed (that was a fault) in order to avoid a core dump
for
\pdfximage height 4cm {img.pdf}\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage
\pdfximage height 6cm {img.pdf}\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage
(the same pdf image file twice or more on a page).
But this is an exceptional case, and can be avoided by \immediate.

Sebastian, is TL7 back to Omega 1.15?? Is the source tree back at that

I have never heard of this error report before,
and I do not feel competent to comment. Does anyone
else understand it? the CD is ISO-966o + Rock Ridge,
which I thought Solaris understood.

I am afraid the texlive list is intended primarily
for discussions of this particular distribution,
not about standard operations. Have a look around on http://www.tug.org/ for some of the introductory manuals
online.

I am afraid you have simply found a problem in the font source,
which you need to take up with the author. It is not
a TeX Live problem per se

to be honest, I have not given TL8 much thought. And it needs a lot.
I am reluctant to simply carry on as we are, I think we need to rethink
the whole thing. For instance, I'd like to make TeX Live a Debian
setup, so that Debian people could get use apt-get to keep up to date.
I am not sure what the Windows equivalent would be. I'd also like
a scheme whereby a CD could be created to order at any time to fit
the needs of any user group which wants to make a distribution.

Nothing before early 2003, anyway.

we do have binaries for Irix 6.5,  and it should work

Message-ID: <8642ABEE-C718-11D6-AD85-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

Take the following latex file:

====================================================
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{times}

\title{Brief Article}
\author{The Author}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

Here is some text.

Uncomment \textsl{this\/} line to see my problem.

Here is the last bit of text.


  \end{document}
  \end
====================================================

When I compile this using pdflatex everything is fine. But when I 
compile this using latex+dvips+ghostscript the PDF output is all 
garbage. The results can be seen at

	ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/showproblem.altpdflatex.pdf 
(garbage)
	ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/showproblem.pdflatex.pdf (ok)
	ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/showproblem.ps (the output of dvips)

Since I am using a combined setup of TeXLive for the binaries (source 
tree as of Sep 10, 2002) and teTeX for the texmf tree (beta as of Sep 6 
2002) I have posted this question on both tetex and texlive lists.

It looks like either dvips of the distiller process (from ghostscript) 
is to blame. There are no obvious clues in the log of the processes. A 
test with a different distiller (PStill) has been inconclusive as it 
seems not to make entire garbage, but it also cannot find the font (and 
it is thus using courier instead). The PStill test does suggest, though, 
that it is a distiller issue. However, I would like to be sure.

I would like people to have a look at above files and to try to 
reproduce this problem so I can be sure it is not dvips that is to blame.

I use texlive7 (from the cd) with OSX10.1.5

I reprodure the problem (exactly).

Here is what i find

altpdflatex --keep-psfile yoursample.tex

produces au ps file who shows the same problem : it is a dvips problem, not
a ps2pdf problem (right ?)

if I try

latex yoursample.tex
dvips yoursample.dvi
ps2pdf yoursample.ps

i get a pdffile that is perfect.

So the problem is probably a dvips options problem in altpdflatex.

Hope this help.

a .ps file with dropped characters.

I've run the test on a local system with LaTeX2e <2000/06/01>, dvips 5.60.1,
and gs 7.21, and got correct output.

Gerben, can you put your .dvi file on your ftp site as well?  Then we
can find out whether the fault is in your dvips, or in your LaTeX setup.

The problems seems in how I call dvips. By default I call dvips with the 
following flags:

	-u +psfonts.map -u +pdftex.map

when I want maximum use of type1 fonts and

	-u psfonts.map

when I want minimum use of type 1 fonts.

With the latter, I get correct output, with the former (which normally 
works, I never encountered this problem before) I get this problem. I am 
unsure if this is the result of the recent changes Thomas made to the 
updmap system (and I wonder now at all if with the new updmap system I 
can still do a dynamic choice between two ways of running dvips and 
how). Is that at all possible? Thomas?

Not exactly, Gerben used altpdflatex which is a shell script that calls

1 latex
2 dvips -R -u +psfonts.map -u +pdftex.map
3 ps2pdf

If you try this, you will probably get a corrupted psfile after step 2...

Btw I don't know exactly what is the -u option (not referenced in man
dvips).

I haven't tracked it down yet, but it seems to be a combination of:

1.  Using partial font downloading, with
2.  Using both Nimbus and Times-Roman in the same document.

Could it be a UniqueID or name clash of some sort?

Some data points:

1.  If you remove the partially downloaded ptmr8o from the generated
PostScript file, the result looks fine (except for the removed font).
So the PostScript code that is selecting the characters from TimesRoman
is still fine.

2.  If you use -j0 it looks fine.

3.  If you omit -u +pdftex.map it looks fine (presumably because then
Nimbus is not included).

I'll keep looking at this . . .

Okay, something *very* strange is going on.

If I take the partial Nimbus font out of that document (everything
from %%BeginFont to %%EndFont), and then build a new PostScript
document by just including that font and adding

72 72 moveto
/Times-Roman findfont 20 scalefont setfont
(This is just a big old test.) show
showpage

to the end (so I never even *use* Nimbus), well, the Times-Roman
stuff doesn't show up correctly---in GhostScript.

I think the reason is because the partial font downloading is
redefining Nimbus (as it is allowed to).  But GhostScript is
probably using Nimbus *as* its Times-Roman, so redefining Nimbus
is breaking GhostScript's Times-Roman.

When I print either this testone.ps, or the supposedly buggy dvips
output from the original file, to a real Adobe PostScript printer,
it works fine.

So, I'm not sure there's anything dvips can do differently, if the
culprit is indeed that redefining the Nimbus font breaks
Times-Roman for GhostScript.

Thoughts?  Should we bring Peter in on this?

One more data point.  If I decode the font, replace Nimbus everywhere
with Nxmbus, reencode the font, and use *that*, everything works fine.

So the only change I made was to the embedded font name, and that
"fixes" it.

This seems to show, pretty clearly, that by downloading the partial
font for Nimbus, we are breaking the underlying "Times" font.

Thoughts?

One more note (sorry to overwhelm the list).  For me, actually, the slant
font never shows up correctly where it *should*, since for me, the
PostScript name in the map file is listed as ptmro8r, but the actual
*font's* font name is NimbusRomNo9L-Regu.  So perhaps my particular
copy of the map file is broken (since it should give the PostScript name
of the font as NimbusRomNo9L-Regu instead of ptmro8r).

Ah, right. Now that you say it:

By invoking gs rather than gv:

For this min/max type 1 font stuff, the lastet teTeX-beta has config
files and map file that simply allow:
  dvips -Poutline ...   # max. type 1
  dvips -Ppk ...        # type1 only for stuff not available as bitmap

To download the standard (lw35) fonts, add -Pdownload35 (the opposite
is -Pbuildin35).

pdftex.map has
  ptmro8r ".167 SlantFont TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <utmr8a.pfb

The PS-Name in the map-file is omitted to work around a bug in pdftex.
Thus, pdftex.map is not a valid map file for dvips (and it was never
ment to be used with dvips).

So, I repeat myself: teTeX-beta users should use the switches
  -Poutline / -Ppk / -Pdownload35 / -Pbuildin35
to control which level of type1 fonts to use / download.

  -u +pdftex.map
should never be used for dvips.

Works OK for me with TexLive7, dvips(k) 5.90a, and gnu-ghostscript 7.05.

Could you show us the font map line(s) for the faked slanted font ptmro?

I just went through a possibly similar problem installing some lucidabr fonts.  
Turns out I had incorrectly entered a map line of

(wrong) hlhro8r LucidaBright-Oblique ".167 SlantFont TeXBase1Encoding 
ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <hlhr8a.pfb

(right) hlhro8r LucidaBright ".167 SlantFont TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " 
<8r.enc <hlhr8a.pfb

The "Oblique" doesn't belong there.  Had me pulling my hair out for 2 days...

Personally I think the formally correct thing here is that
a) ghostscript needs a bug fix
b) pdftex needs a bug fix as the map file that is incompatible with 
dvips is so because it is a workaround for a pdftex bug and when that is 
fixed, the map file can be good-for-both again.

As it is now, we have a map file that is good for pdftex (as it 
circumvents a bug in pdftex) and not good for dvips, but the way map 
files are used and with different config files, there is a good 
workaround, so both fixes above are not necessarily required i nthe 
short term.

But I think both gs and pdftex maintainers should be made aware of this 
(if they not already are).

Yes, it does by default, the 35 standard fonts are provided under GPL
by URW.  But if you have the Adobe fonts, you can play with
ghostscript's Fontmap
(/usr/local/share/ghostscript/7.30/lib/Fontmap.GS).

Thanks for the info, but given that there's not much dvips can do
about this (in general, unless we tie in GhostScript-specific
knowledge), I'm tempted to forward all of this to L. Peter Deutsch
and let him resolve it.

Unless someone thinks there is something dvips should do differently.

Realize there are two problems here.  The first is the GhostScript
problem, where overriding Nimbus kills Times-Roman (which it
shouldn't).  The second is that that map file is broken, in any
case, since the PostScript name is not provided correctly in it,
so dvips thinks the *PostScript* name is ptmro or whatever.  So
whoever built that map file should take another look at it.

Hello,

During installation of TeXLive 7 using install-cd.sh, I see a lot
of the same files which are being installed. I'm running on Solaris 8.

Let me explain:

After I selected some extra collections and changed the language collection
and give the install command I see a strange behaviour:
the *.list files in /tmp/.tmp_inst.XXXX have a multiple entries of the
same filename. For example the file tex-latex.list contains 5 entries
named bin/sparc-solaris2.7/latex.

Because of this I get a lot of 'errors' from gtar during the installation 
about permissions, this is because the file is already installed.

It looks like the .list files are 'cat' which a previous one with the same
name. 

Has someone seen this before? Can it be fixed?

I observe the same behaviour when running the install-cd.sh script under 
my user name (my site installation was run as root and gave no problems).

Whether the multiple entries in the .list files are intended, I don't know.
But I think it would make sense to make the files on the CD image
owner-writable.

Short english answer:
It is very cheap: free!
Look at http://tug.org/texlive

(Sorry, no portuges answer)

More complete spanish answer:
Es bastante barato: gratis!


Lo puedes conseguir de dos maneras:
1. Si tienes una conexión de alta velocidad a Internet te lo puedes bajar
de
http://ftp.tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/Images/
Sólo necesitas el fichero que se llama texlive7-20020604-cd1.iso.bz2
Es una imagen de CD comprimida, que se descomprime con bzip2.Puedes
encontrar la utilidad para descomprimirlo en
ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/bzip2/v100/
(la versión para windows es bzip2-100-x86-win32.exe).
A continuación has de crear el CD usando una copiadora.

2. Puedes conseguirlo a través d'algun grupo de usuarios. Que yo sepa,
no lo hay en Brasil... aquí encontrarás toda la información:
http://www.tug.org

Message-ID: <DF63F416-D2BF-11D6-A210-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

The class g-brief.sty includes certain files only if they are found:

\ifx \eurofontname\eurofontnone
\IfFileExists{marvosym.sty}
   {\RequirePackage{marvosym}}
   {\ClassError{g-brief}
     {Can't load package marvosym.sty !!!}}
   \def\Telefon#1{\def\telefon{#1}} \def\telefon{}
\fi
\ifx \eurofontname\eurofontnone
\IfFileExists{europs.sty}
   {\RequirePackage{europs}}
   {\ClassError{g-brief}
     {Can't load package europs.sty !!!}}
\fi
\ifx \eurofontname\eurofontnone
\IfFileExists{eurosym.sty}
   {\RequirePackage{eurosym}}
   {\ClassError{g-brief}
     {Can't load package eurosym.sty !!!}}
\fi

Now, on my system where I run a setup based on teTeX's texmf tree, 
europs.sty and eurosym.sty are not available, but marvosym.sty is. When 
I use g-brief in for instance this file (reported to me):

and I run pdflatex or latex on it, I get:

?

The same happens when I remove marvosym.sty and run texhash, it will 
complain about not being able to load marvosym. The file is definitely 
not there, but I get an error because g-brief is trying to load it 
anyway. \IfFileExists seems not to work here.

Is this a problem with Mac OS X only? Or does it show up at other sites 
also? Can people test this by making sure europs.sty is temporarily 
unavailable and see what happens when the file above is compiled?

Thanks,

G

You obtain

It is absolutely normal : \ClassError generates ... an error.

So I think the problem is with the g-brief class which sould use
\ClassWarning instead of \ClassError (I think...) at least for europs and
marvosym.

Note that there is an error in g-brief anyway because \ClassError needs a
third argument which is the error message...

I think you are missing the point. europs.sty does *not* exist on my 
system, so why is ClassError ever called? I also think th ecode in 
g-brief is OK, after all it only tries to load europs.sty when it has 
ascertained that europs.sty does exist.

Are you sure? On my system, europs.sty does *not* exist. So the 
ClassError should never be called if \IfFileExists works properly.

This is beside my more simple and fundamenal problem: europs.sty does 
*not* exist on my system but \IfFileExists claims it does.

I would really like for someone to remove europs.sty from his system 
temporarily and then try to typeset the tex file.

it's a latex error if it's actually tried to load the file.  a g-brief
error arises only if the file isn't there (as detected by
\iffileexists)

so \if...ts _is_ working.  mind you, i don't see how one could claim
that the code is ... surely loading marvosym (which defines a euro
symbol) ought to change \eurofontname?  and it plainly isn't (or you
wouldn't have seen the europs error, would you?).

It turns out that a) there is an eror in g-brief.cls and b) I did not 
understand \ClassError (thanks Michel Bovani). I have reported the error 
in g-brief.cls to the author.

\IfFileExists has 2 arguments - the first is executed when the file
exists, and the second argument is executed when the file does not
exist.

\IfFileExists{marvosym.sty}
   {\RequirePackage{marvosym}} % this is executed if marvosym.sty exists
   {\ClassError{g-brief}{Can't load package marvosym.sty !!!}} % this is executed if marvosym.sty does not exist

i hope that explains your misunderstandings.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0209291907330.14123-100000@gilas>

Dear all,

Following is a delayed patch for Omega related parts of dvips, which was
most probably forgotten to be sent to Olaf when Omega 1.23 release were
done, and has been the source of many confusions. The patch is done
against the dvipsk sources in TeX Live 7 (5.90a?), but I can redo it if it
cannot be incorporated in the current dvips.

All changes are #ifdef-ed for Omega, or are otherwise clearly
Omega-related. The only exception is a change to 'texps.lpro' which I
don't understand since I don't understand other than it is related to
PostScript Type 0 fonts.

It would be great if this gets incorporated into dvips, web2c, etc. Please
contact me in case of any problems. (And finally sorry for CC-ing the
world, since I'm still in full confusion about who is responsible for
what.)
