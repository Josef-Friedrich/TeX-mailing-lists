Message-ID: <20021001163634.A3716542@aisa.fi.muni.cz>

	Hello,

I have collected updates of Czech/Slovak support and documentation for
TL prepared by CSTUG board members.

Please, can you make the changes to the distribution? Could you point me
to the resulting CD image to make it available to our members to test?

The files are at
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/TL/

Changes:

Documentation:
* README.CZS in the root of the CD updated (by Janka Chlebikova)
* czech_sk.html in the root of the CD updated (by Janka Chlebikova)
* removed all the content of texmf/doc/tldoc/slovak (html documentation)
  and replaced with updated version of live.pdf (Slovak translation of the
  documentation by Janka Chlebikova) as Janka had problems to create the
  html version
All of files above are in documentation.tgz. Moreover, source.zip
contains the sources of updated documentation.

CS(La)TeX:
Czech, Slovak updated with files
ftp://math.feld.cvut.cz/pub/cstex/web2c/csplain.tar.gz
ftp://math.feld.cvut.cz/pub/cstex/web2c/cslatex.tar.gz
by Petr Olsak (as of 29. 8. 2002), also at the web site above.
* csplain.tar.gz
  - texmf/doc/cstex ignored (contains only parpozn.tex in addition, not
    needed)
  - texmf/tex/csplain replaced all the files that differ, namely
    csplain.ini
    czech.sty
    dcfonts.tex
    ecfonts.tex
    hyphen.lan
    il2code.tex
    plaina4.tex
    slovak.sty
    t1code.tex
    ttimes.tex
  - texmf/tex/enctex ignored
* cslatex.tar.gz
  - texmf/doc/cstex is the same, ignored
  - texmf/tex/cslatex/src contains only the files that generate all the
    stuff in cslatex/ except cslatex.ini, ignored
  - texmf/tex/cslatex replaced files
    fonttext.cfg
    hyphen.cfg
    il2cmdh.fd
    il2cmfib.fd
    il2cmfr.fd
    il2cmr.fd
    il2cmss.fd
    il2cmtt.fd
    il2cmvtt.fd
    il2enc.def
    il2lcmss.fd
    il2lcmtt.fd
    (file cslatex.ini is the same)
    note: the source files also generate czech.sty and slovak.sty, both the
    files are in csplain directory for historical reasons (by the
    decision that `common' things should be in `plain')

because of a slow system, I've copied every thing from  the cds onto the

My question is whether or not is possible (under HP-UX 10.20) to just
install the base tree (texmf) without having to go over /tmp/..... ?

because it takes a very long time :-)

BTW I had it install the support tree overnight, and it gave me a lot of
 error messages like this:

gtar: Cannot add file usergrps/cstug/pdftex/index.html: No such file or
directory
gtar: Cannot add file usergrps/cstug/people_related/index.html: No such

I can't go further up up to see if there's something wrong, but does this

hopefully not, though I am surprised

you *can* just drag the whole texmf tree from CD to your disk. if that
takes more than 10 minutes, you have a very defective CD reader.....

On my laptop it took approx 20 min from the CD

I don't read it from cd, we mounted it on a linux mashine and then I
copied the entire cd on to the file system, otherwise I couldn't get to it
for out UNIX mashines. I'm trying to create a better LaTeX installation
for our system (HP-UX (10.20 + 11) and Linux) so I need to compile it on
HP-UX 10. So I'm just doing a complete installation, just for testing.

But our file system is a bit slow, the last time when I installed a local
copi for used with Linux it took 3 hours and 45 mins.

At the moment I have to move to another disk because the two cds and the
new installation just filled up the other one, so now installation were
made, I'll tri again later.

The question above should just be ignored.

I think this might be rewritten as "language 0 should always be
US-english." But I don't know of any TeXnical reason for that.

Sebastian,

That was guessable.

> To be honest, I regard it as a bit of a joke on his part....

Then why not ask him to remove it? If it remains there, whoever wants to
borrow some code from it (I wanted to do so) must include the phrase as
part of the license (since it talks about derived products). Theoretically
speaking, the whole TL or teTeX may be considered a derived product, and
thus can be considered nonfree.

I personally consider the phrase offensive, although I don't know anything
about the cause. Do you have any plan to do something about it, or you
consider such *jokes* permissible? (Of course everyone has some enemies,
and the list can grow ...)

I personally have been lazy about it, and hoped it
would go away. I suppose I had now better remove it from TeX Live,
since you have pointed it out.

Apostolos, I have to follow the rules on this; I'll remove
the file from TeX Live now. but of course I will put it back 
if you change the license.

Sebastian, you cannot just remove greek.dtx from babel, since the lppl
dous not allow you to distribute babel without it.

I don't think that any of the core component of LaTeX is the right place
to play any copyright "jokes". So please, Apostolos, rerelease greek.dtx
without that restriction.

So that practically makes the whole current babel nonfree software. :(

Unfortunately, it is a bit more complicated that that - I cannot
unliterally take greek out of Babel; which means I must omit
Babel altogether; and Babel is a required component of LaTeX, so I have
to omit LaTeX.  The same argument will no doubt be followed by Thomas
for teTeX, so your small addition to the licensing of greek might take
the LaTeX base distribution entirely out of two of the commonest TeX
distributions.....

good news for ConTeXt, perhaps?

Well, the way to do it may be asking Johannes to drop greek, or the LaTeX
team to drop babel temporarily until the license gets fixed or an
alternate solution is found...

It's not me, we're talking about a certain definition. Almost all Free
Software/Open Source guidelines in the world consider such a licensing
nonfree. There are very honorable people who like to use such licenses,
but that would create problems for many others who want to use TeX Live.
Should I check the license of each individual package on the TeX Live CD I
want to *use*, to make sure no one has listed me or my employer somewhere
in a comment in a header? If we allow a software with a *restriction on
usage* (please note that we are not even talking redistribution) on TeX
Live, we should announce it properly and explicitly, and also that we
allow such licenses.

It would be great if you consider changing the license, so your
well-written package can be included in TeX Live, Debian GNU/Linux, ...,
and also people like me can use some of your source code without a need to
restrict that certain publisher to use their software.

(And believe me, if debian people become aware of the fact, they may
remove the entire teTeX from debian!)

I agree, but we should stick to some definition of free. For TeX Live,
DFSG (Debian Free Software Guidelines) was chosen, which is a famous base
and is a very simple test. They call a software free if it meets certain
criteria. You can find about it at:

	http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines

In short, they are: possiblity of free redistribution, availablity of
source code, allowing derived works, no discrimination against persons or
groups, no discrimination against fields of endeavor, not being specific
to the distribution, and not contaminating other software.

Sorry Apostolos, it's not me, and I hope you're not taking any offense.  
It's a sharp guideline established by TeX Live and teTeX maintainers (and
if I recall correctly, even CTAN, in placing the software somewhere). They
may be able to bend it for you or babel or ..., but their entire software
may be then considered nonfree software by people in the higher level
(users, redistributors, ...)

I heard a talk the other day from a Sun engineer about Open Office,
in which he explained how it had taken a large team an entire year to 
go through the source code and locate anything which might prevent them
releasing OO as open source. Now suppose Sun wanted to distribute
TeX as a standard component of something - if they suspected that
license restrictions like the Babel greek one existed, don't you think
they'd drop the idea like a stone? it's a legal nightmare!

teTeX, CTAN and TeX Live have gone through much pain over the last few
years trying to establish TeX as "free software". It would be very
dispiriting to lose eg the Debian approval at this late stage - and if
they found that thing about the Cretan publisher, you can be very sure
they'd have a fit!

Well, I just checked things, and as far as I can tell, there is no mention
in the CTAN's LaTeX base package that babel must be included with LaTeX,
and even it is mentioned specifically in 'legal.txt' that:

   The use of LaTeX is unrestricted.

So there is no need to remove LaTeX entirely, and that brings us back to
babel, simplifying the problem a lot. These are the options I can think
of:

   1. Apostolos agrees to change the license.
   2. Johannes agrees to remove greek from babel.
   3. We remove babel from TeX Live.

There may or may not be other options of:

   4. We replace the greek files with files giving warning messages about
      the licensing problem, and a pointer to where one can download them.
      We probably won't be breaking LPPL since the files will not be a
      derivative work or a modified file. It will be a new file, done from
      scratch. (I'm not sure if this is legal, since babel may be
      considered a whole Program in LPPL terms, and it even contains a 
      manifest file.)

   5. Sebastian tells that a license like babel's greek is OK for
      TeX Live. That will render it off-topic here, and will take us to 
      teTeX, debian, or some other mailing list.

   6. We forget the thing altogether, waiting for the day some other guy 
      raises the issue.

so you say now. what about your heirs? if you are run over by a bus
tomorrow, perhaps your family will find this possible source
of revenue and start issuing lawsuits...

more to the point, if this stays in, what if I change my own copyright
to say  "no-one with the surname Patel can use it"? do you want that
restriction to be distributed?

I am afraid my aim is to get TeX Live into Debian so I am not likely
to take that route...

If you consider it nonfree, then it is nonfree. I have my own reasons
for disallowing this particular publisher to use things that I have
(partly) created. And of course there are many things on this planet 
that are free but far less free than this "nonfree" software.

Oh! That explains why Sun had postponed Solaris 9 x86: they were busy

My restriction does not prevent Sun from including the files in
a distribution and if the Cretan people would buy a Solaris and would make
commercial use of the software, then I would not lawsuit Sun. After all,
the Cretan people are quite aware of this restriction from the very
beggining.

Well, you are wrong because last Friday Sun announced their new plans...
Linux is not a big priority for Sun, after all there is always

I would say: no problem! After all, you are the one who makes this CD
and you are entitled to have any license you like. You don't want to
give to Patels or even to Greeks, just do it. Big publishers around
the world respect the work many TeX people have done and they have
shown that in various ways, but that particular publisher is
too arrogant! But, since you people don't understand this I will remove
the restriction.

there is a .md5 file as well.

hmm, that looks like our mistake, passing -Bstatic to a compiler than
cant handle it.

I dont suppose you have GCC installed?

The Perforce change number 2418 (sync with teTeX) removes Omega from the

removing Omega from TeX Live also.

Should I revert these?

no! those files are teTeX documentation files. TeX Live contains those
as is, not tailored for TeX Live.

Omega will come back to teTeX if the Omega community can agree on a
stable release.

Unfortunately, CJK TeX is completely broken. There are only some
binaries but no other files.

Due to some technical and other problems I was unable to have a look
at TUG 2002 version earlier. Now I have done it and noticed that CJK
TeX was already broken on this edition.

Sebastian has already agreed to use the Build/source.development tree
to get every bits right there. So we have a single place acessible to
all of us to see what is happening.

I'll sync teTeX agains that and I can offer to put the new web2c there
and hope to get matching pdftex and omega back (and etex if there are
adjustments). That's my idea about how it might work best...

Yes and this is most likely a problem with the make program that you use.
You can try to change in TeX/texk/web2c/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.mk the two
rules (caution: use a tab, not spaces):

$(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.h: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.h
	cp -f $< $@

$(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.defines: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.defines
	cp -f $< $@

to:

$(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.h: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.h
	cp -f $< $(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.h

$(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.defines: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.defines
	cp -f $< $(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.defines

or try GNU make.

Well, this just gives a warning, no error message... make breaks on
expanding

gcc can make use of GNU binutils, but on non-linux systems, most
people use gcc together with the linker of the operating system.

I don't have doubts...

Using a gcc compiled for hpux10.20 on a HP-UX 11 system sounds like
asking for trouble... If you really want to use gcc on HP-UX 11, why
don't you compile gcc on that system?

yes it is a a bit wierd

But the plan is in the end to compile it on a HP-UX 10.20 system, tehn it
should be runable on HP-UX 11 as well.

But so far I haven't been able to. But I think it's because of the system,
it is not that good and well maintained :-(

Then, please go to a 10.20 system. Never use gcc on a system that it
is not made for. gcc will do wrong assumptions about header files in
/usr/include.

It is possible to build a cross compiler, but this is much more
complicated than a native compiler...

configure compiles a trivial program and tries to execute that. If this
fails, it assumes that you are using a cross compiler. Given the fact, that
  a) you want to use TeX on hp-ux 11, too
and
  b) web2c does not work well with cross compilers since it bootstaps
     e.g. tangle
I still claim that you should better use a 10.20 system...

I know, but I think that the ggc compiler on out HP-UX 10.20 is a cross
compiler :-(

I'll try again tomorrow. I've given myself another 3 weeks to get this
working.

And if I don't then I give up. Then the people here will have to life with
their poor LaTeX installation, or have to live with the fact the it's not
the same system on our Linux and UNIX servers

I see two troublespots (condensed):

	./../klibtool link c++ -o pdftex ...
              -nodefaultlibs -Wl,-Bstatic -lstdc++ -Wl,-Bdynamic -lgcc -lc

The use of static, dynamic around libstdc++ suggests you enabled the
cxx hack.  It also suggests that the implementation of this hack only
works if you're using gcc _and_ GNU ld.

This part is a worse puzzle:

	cp -f  ./pdfetexdir/pdfetex.defines
Usage:	cp [-f|-i] [-p] [-S] [-e warn|force|ignore] source_file target_file
	cp [-f|-i] [-p] [-S] [-e warn|force|ignore] source_file ... target_directory
	cp [-f|-i] [-p] [-S] -R|-r [-e warn|force|ignore] source_directory ... target_directory



The rule that generates the cp is

$(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.defines: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.defines
        cp -f $< $@

It is clear that the $< is there, but the target $@ somehow got
omitted.  Yet there are a number of rules in the Makefiles that would
also fail if $@ couldn't be used at all.  Perhaps replacing this with
        cp -f $(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.defined $@
will work.  If so, you'll need to make a similar change a few lines
earlier.


Right now I'd recommend:

Do NOT specify --with-cxx-runtime-hack when configuring.  If you
didn't do this before, then DO specify --without-cxx-runtime-hack.

If the changes to the Makefile don't work, use GNU make.

    $(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.h: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.h
            cp -f $< $@

I thought that many non-gnu makes do not expand $< and $@ except in
implicit or pattern rules.  In this particular case, it's just an
abbreviation, so this could be changed:

    $(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.h: $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.h
            cp -f $(srcdir)/pdftexdir/pdftex.h $(srcdir)/pdfetexdir/pdfetex.h

And it might work.  It would do no harm, anyway.  However, probably the
whole thing is hopeless without gnu make because I doubt this is the
only place there is such a dependency.

    > hmm, that looks like our mistake, passing -Bstatic to a compiler than

If gcc is being used, it's better to use -static than -Bstatic, because
gcc can then change the -static to whatever options are needed on the
current system.

As for the HP-UX 10 vs 11 thing, at one point I was compiling ok with a
setup like this (hpux 8 vs 9, I think).  Problems would manifest as
failed compiles because of include file mismatches, as Thomas said.

Good luck.

Well, the implementation is done in such a way that the hack is only
enabled if a test program can be linked and run successfully. The hack
does not work (i.e. the c++ runtime lib will not be linked statically)
in this case, but it also does no harm.

I am sure that pdftex will run (even though the linker has issued a
few warnings).

That's also my opinion. And I don't think that there are too many of
such examples around, so chances are that we can fix that.

My hack tries to link just the c++ runtime lib statically (if this is
possible, not all systems have a libc++.a). By using -static, all
libraries would be linked statically.

I am surprised that klibtool is still being used.

libtool itself has grown tremendously and I would guess is much more
reliable on a wider variety systems than the little klibtool script I
wrote could ever hope to be.  I don't know if it supports the particular
case of wanting to link one library (c++) statically, but it might.

Also, rather than (or as an alternative to) linking statically, it might
be more desirable, and work on more systems, to add the dynamic lib dir
into the binary with -R or the equivalent.  I wish gcc did this
automatically, since no c++ program will run without it, but they have
rejected the suggestion more than once.

Hmm which kind of other secret options is there for the configuring script

--without-cxx-runtime-hack isn't on the ./configure --help list, but I

I only have TeXLive from June 2002, and this works just fine on my

Looking at the source-tree of TeX Live (Build/source):

$ ls -l configure
-r-xr-xr-x    1 te       te          96059 Jul  4  2001 configure

$ ls -l TeX/texk/web2c/withenable.ac 
-r--r--r--    1 te       te           4005 Mar  9  2002 TeX/texk/web2c/withenable.ac

So, the reason is that the configure script needs to be updated by
running autoconf.

the compilation complained about somemissing X stuff that's why I didn't

As noted in your docs. If one installs the provided binaries as oppose
to compiling from source,
one needs to tell the binaries where texmf.cnf is. by setting TEXMFCNF
. I was
wondering if  install-cd.sh could specifically ask for the value of this
parameter. In my
case I'm moving the whole package to a completely diifferent directory
/software/tex-texlive-7/data/texmf.

I realize that it could be done in some standard file under /etc so that
everyone's shell would get this
value but it seems it would be more elegant to have install-cd.sh do it
somehow.... one could do some kind
of subsitution via sed?


Are the format files architecture independent? I notice that one has to
generate them via texconfig....
they're not installed by running install-cd.sh

Ok. I realized a way.... I could have a generic cover script to which I could
have softlinks whose names correspond to all the binaries....it would then set
the environment variable..

I don't think it would be very sensible for our install-cd.sh
to try and tinker with settings in /etc/XXXX. It is not advanced

My opinion is that one does not need to set any environment variable if
the relative position between binary and texmf.cnf file is kept intact.

And yes, I agree that the manipulation of global environment variables is
dangerous. Even if someone installs TeX Live to some system one cannot
know for sure that this is the only TeX installation that is to be used
there. I thing that global environment variables should be under control
of the system administrator only.

But, I migth have a too old fashioned view of UNIX systems; being used
with lots of different software and lots of different users. People
thinking of their private linux installation on their own PC might have
a different view...

well, yes, Thomas is right. Put TeX Live where you like,
but preserver the relationship and all is well.

first of all do I need to update the configure script using autoconf, and
if so how do I do that.

I tried testing the HPUX installation today, but I wasn't pleased with it.
Latex (and others) seems to stop for a little while before starting
causing longer runtime.

Dvips complained about some dvips: 

Bad syntax in included font usage table 3d:8 

etc. But worked, at least until I (by accident) runned updmap, then
it started using mf font where it should by standard (it does on my linux
version) be using PS fonts.

Also shouldn't texconfig also create all the format files, it didn't look
like it did, I used fmtutil --all instead.

Right now I'm compiling a new version, I'm trying not to use the
--without-cnxx-runtime-hack (I think that was what is was called) and no
xdvi stuff.

I think that some of my dvips problems might be caused by the fact that I
have another TeXLive installation further down my path. Beacuse now that
dvips complains about 

Bad syntax in included font usage table 3d:8

I have no idea on how to recover from this

If you are using Perforce, and build in source.development, it shouldn't
be necessary.

indeed, i can reproduce this. the reason is that the czhyph.tex
patterns are not suited to be used with plain TeX, but only with LaTeX
(and more specifically, with T1 font encoding).

when these patterns are loaded by LaTeX, all macros like \' are
expanded to produce characters in T1 encoding, and \accent commands
are not produced in the expansion; that's why this works in LaTeX,
and does not work in Plain TeX.

the cyrplain package contains some additional support for such things
(font encoding/input encoding stuff for plain tex), and i think that
this can be done with the help of cyrplain.

if you need a plain tex format (pdftex) with czhyph patterns, i think
i can try to explain what needs to be done (how to use cyrplain for
that).

note that you will have to use T1-encoded fonts in plain tex documents
to get proper hyphenation for Czech language (when you use czhyph).

Best,
v.

Please take it from CTAN/systems/texlive/Source

(to be exact I have such stuff from tug repositories:

The user switched on the czech hyphens in the babel package
and he run to make all formats. The pdfTeX format fails.
The consequence: the TeXlive is unusable for Czech TeX user.

IMHO this is the principial bug of names convention very closelly
connected to the DEK's Copyright. The pdftex.ini file have not to call the
babel macros! This file was OK in previous versions of the TeXlive.
We suppose the same output from the "tex document" command as from
the "pdftex document" command, only the format of output isn't dvi
but PDF. We don't suppose that the totally different macro package
will be used when format is generated.

I remember that in 1996 (?? may be) Frank Mittelbach have patched
the plain macros for TeX in order to include another hyphen patterns
automatically. DEK explicitly says that this patch not conform to his
Copyright and this patch was removed immediatelly. Now, we have the
similar situation, but in little bit another name space: not TeX and
plain, but pdfTeX and pdfplain. These names are not the subject of
DEK's Copyright, of course. But I strongly vote to respect in this
name space the same principles.

Now, the technical information: the czhyph.tex patterns are dessigned to
include many times in different encodings. First, the macros define
the expansion of \', \v etc. to choosen font encoding and then the
czhyph.tex is included. Afterward the macros define expansion of \',
\v etc. to another encoding and _the same_ czhyph.tex is included
secondly with another \language register. This principle works in
cslatex and csplain formats since 1992. We need not babelised plain
because we are using csplain. In 1999, I have added some lines of
macros to czhyph.tex in order to it may be included in babelised
LaTeX too. I am not supporting babelised plain, because the csplain
is sufficient.

The CSTeX (namelly the formats csplain and cslatex) is not responsible
to this bug, but the TeX live with this bug is unusable for Czech
users. So, I am asking the author of the change in pdftex.ini file:

please, correct this bug.

Thank you

That's your opinion, ok. You have a special format (csplain) for your
users, but that's not true for most other TeX users. And users of other
languages benefit from an easy way to set up hyphenation.

So, I prefer to solve the technical problem which is to avoid loading
czhyphen.tex for plain-based formats instead of going into the "you
must do that, you must not do that" discussion. I am not going into this
discussion, because (in contrast to TeX) there is no legal basis for this.

So, for the technical solution:

1) putting czhyphen.tex somewhere below texmf/tex/generic is wrong if
   this file is not really generic. Files in generic should always be
   compatible with plain (at least). If it works with csplain / cslatex,
   I suggest to put it into texmf/tex/csplain. If it works with latex /
   cslatex, I suggest to put it into texmf/tex/latex/misc.

2) I suggest to put a new language.dat into texmf/tex/plain/config

The language.dat file in 2) will be used for all plain-based format
files which do not have their own language.dat file (e.g. frtex). And,
this language.dat fill not have a commented or uncommented line for
czech.

No. pdftex is not TeX.

What is this czhyph.tex you are talking about? I cannot find it on CTAN
and I cannot find it in the .tar.gz archives I found on the cstex server.

Sure, I see this as a TeX Live bug (and teTeX has the same bug,
too). I suggest a fix based on having a special language.dat in
texmf/tex/plain/config:

$ fmtutil --showhyphen pdftex
/software/oss/Text/teTeX-1.0/share/texmf/tex/plain/config/language.dat

$ fmtutil --showhyphen latex
/software/oss/Text/teTeX-1.0/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat

texconfig is smart enough to edit the right file, e.g. when running
  texconfig hyphen pdftex

I agree with Petr. The problem is that pdftex.ini inputs now bplain.tex
instead of just plain.tex and such change was introduced in TL7 for CSTUG
(and teTeX-beta). I'd rather suggest adding pdfbplain.ini
and one more line to fmtutil.cnf:
#!pdfbplain      pdftex          language.dat    pdfbplain.ini

For the same reason as Petr described we use in Poland pdfmex format.

The plain format has a some different philosophy than latex: latex
users need a instant macro package for every new goal---but plain user
write his own home-made macros. These macros have to work with exactly
the same result in any future versions of plain. This is a reason why
it was the very good idea from DEK that plain is frozen. The plain is
only the good starting point to writing such home-made macros, it is
not the ready to use system (as the LaTeX is, for example).

For the same reason, the csplain + pdfcsplain is frozen too. On the
other hand the babel is developed macro with new and new versions and
features. If the plain is infected by such macro, the stability of
plain is not guarranted.

Please, name your babelised plain babplain (for example) and start to
try to find some users for this macro. The babelised plain in pdfTeX
may by named pdfbabplain (for example). Don't use the long-time used
names (pdftex for this situation) for a new experimental macros.
This is unfair.

> So, I prefer to solve the technical problem which is to avoid loading

Yes, I am ready to help with the solvig of the technical problems, but
we will solve the problems for babplain and not for pdftex.

Yes, I included the czhyphen.tex into babel package only for babelised
LaTeX. I did not assume that this file will be used in babelised
plain. This was my mistake.

Before 1999:
czhyphen.tex was the Czech hyphenation patterns by Pavel Sevecek
             implemented by \v, \' etc. sequences and used by
             csplain, cslatex (+ pdfcsplain, pdfcslatex).
czhyph.tex   was the Czech hyphenation patterns by Lada Lhotka
             implemented in 8-bit T1 encoding and used in babelised
             LaTeX. The quality of this pattern was not so good as
             of the Sevecek's patterns.

After 1999:
czhyphen.tex is the same as before. Used by csplain and cslatex.
czhyph.tex   is the copy of czhyphen.tex with three lines added
             by me in order to this \v \' based patterns can be
             used in babelised LaTeX. Now, the users of babelised LaTeX
             have the Czech patterns with the same quality as in
	     csplain and cslatex. The Lhotka's patterns was
             removed.

It is possible to leave only the czhyphen.tex file for all formats.

The similar situation is for skhyphen.tex (Slovak hyphenation patterns,
which are the part of CSTeX too).

This time I tried the source file currently found at CTAN. No such luck.
configure wouldn't come through.

a log file can be found at

http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/conf-gandalf-101002-1335.log

But with the source from CD2 I have been able to compile the TeXLive
binaries. 

But I did a few things wrong with my test file, so I thought that it
didn't work (some metapost files that hadn't been compiled from scratch
after I started testing).

One odd thing though. When I did test it, there seemed to be a small idle
period before latex started giving any output. Any idea why this happens?
It might have something to do with the wierd option someone gave me

Slow CPU, slow IO (network, slow disk), inefficient OS ...

I'll test it tomorrow, I'm compiling a new version, using the source fra
CD2 and the texmf tree from CD1 (alongside with a Linux installation)
we'll se how it goes.

The compilation should be over in 4 - 6 hours

Mein erster Versuch TexLive7 zu installieren hat geklappt. Autorun lief los und 
auch alles andere wie beschrieben. Meine alten Tex-Dateien wurden aber nur mit 
großem Gemecker compiliert und ich habe mich deshalb zunächst nach einem neuen 
Editor umgesehen. Jetzt habe ich den WinEdt-30 Tage Editor erst einmal auf mein 
System Win2000 installiert und bekam Probleme (zu dumm bin ich 
offensichtlich).Meine Frage bezieht sich jetzt auf folgenden Tatbestand:
Ich habe meine bei Boysen + Maasch gekaufte TexLive7 wieder in das Laufwerk 
geschoben und erwartete, dass diese CD losläuft - nichts geschah. Ich schau in 
ein Verzeichnis um zu erfahren, wie ich nochmals die Installation wiederholen 
kann: Nur install.exe aufrufen. Ich suche auf der CD nach install.exe - nicht 
da!! Wo ist diese Datei geblieben? 
Ich wollte das System neu installieren, weil ich einiges furchtbar durcheinander 
gebracht hatte (für einen 56-jährigen ist das einfacher, als die Ordnung auf 
andere Weise wieder herzustellen).

Helfen Sie mir bitte

You could try --debug=-1 (or some such).  It might be doing some
heavy-duty disk searching, depending on how things are (mis)configured.

The first idea about the technical solution can't be the best.

I am ready to add the one line macro code into czhyphen.tex, skhyphen.tex
in order to these files can be included from everywhere: from babelised
LaTeX, from csplain, cslatex and from babelised plain. We leave these
files in its historical place: texmf/tex/csplain and remove its
duplicates: czhyph.tex and skhyph.tex. Only the following change in
the babel's language.dat should be done:

czhyph.tex -> czhyphen.tex
skhyph.tex -> skhyphen.tex

I will add this one line macro code after the pdfTeX base format
downgrades to its historical original meaning. I am waiting for removing
the path from pdftex.ini, it means to removing babel from pdftex format.
You can name the babelised plain by another name.

	Hello,

please, please, the political discussion about correct Czech support is
interesting, nevertheless we are in a hurry a bit, as we'll have to send
the CD to CSTUG members and we have a firm to make the CD.

Could you be so kind and prepare a `CS' edition havig pdftex.ini just in
the same state as about two years ago, not calling bplain but plain?

Or is it enough to change the file and use `mkisofs -rJ'? (I'm afraid
the tpm files would go wrong.)

Thank you very much!

Ok, so this "hurry" is independend of teTeX (and limited to TeX Live).
I don't have a very strong opinion about plain vs. bplain (in fact,
I don't know many plain TeX users), but I'll take some time to think
about it.

> Or is it enough to change the file and use `mkisofs -rJ'? (I'm afraid

I don't know about the tpm file. You have to change pdftex.ini and
texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf. The entry for pdftex should be changed from
  pdftex	pdftex	language.dat	pdftex.ini
to
  pdftex	pdftex	-	pdftex.ini
to reflect the fact that there is no way to set up hyphenation.

A similar problem exists for eplain (change ini file and fmtutil entry).
For omega, the ini file has plain, so the fmtutil entry should be
adjusted.

What about quitting the political debate, and take it to somewhere it
really belongs, like a user area like comp.text.tex?

I'll say let's stay with whatever we have now, and just change settings
minimally without breaking anyone's copyright. What about Thomas's
original idea (with a little difference in pathes): moving 'czhyph.tex'
and 'skhyph.tex' to '/tex/latex/hyphen', removing their mention from
'/tex/generic/config/language.dat', and adding a new 'language.dat' (a
copy of current '/tex/generic/config/language.dat') to
'/tex/latex/config'?

Nobody loses anything, since we are not removing any feature, and we are
fixing a bug. We will only be moving the hyphenation patterns to the right
place. We will then talk about it again either when it was decided to
change pdftex's default to plain or when {cz,sk}hyph.tex gets fixed for
plain/bplain TeX.

It would be easier for you to copy the whoel CD, change the .ini 
files, and produce the new iso. e.g.:

mkisofs -pad -J -dir-mode 0755 -r -v -o /tmp/texlive7-20021011-cd1.iso .

Ps. What about tldoc/slovak/*.html files? /czech_sk.html has many links

I just found that TeX Live doesn't include the Luxi font family, and CTAN
only has the Mono Type1 version of them (it's available in
{Serif,Sans,Mono} x {Medium,Bold} x {Normal,Oblique} x {TTF,Type1}). It
isn't free software, but it's freely redistributable. I was wondering if
the license (follows) is OK for their inclusion in TL, so I can pack it
for TL and CTAN (it's already distributed with XFree86).

Please observe that all hyphenation patterns are in 
texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/ and every file use the short name convention 
(bghyph, plhyph, ukhyph, etc.), so leaving here czhyph.tex would be OK.
The same convention is used in language.dat.

In my opinion czhyph.tex and skhyph.tex (at current state) can be also 
used for csplain, cslatex, its variants for pdftex, as well for latex+babel. 
Am I right? 
(I've just changed 2 lines in hyphen.lan and have proper formats...)
So the whole problem is not concerned with cz[sk]hyph.tex 
vs. cz[sk]hyphen.tex.

By the way, I found texmf/tex/enctex/ with 3 files. In texmf.cnf we have:
TEXINPUTS.cslatex = .;$TEXMF//tex/{cslatex,csplain,latex,generic,}//
TEXINPUTS.csplain = .;$TEXMF/tex/{csplain,plain,generic,}//

so I'd suggest moving those 3 files to texmf/tex/csplain/ as auxiliary 
files and both csplain and cslatex can find them in more convenient 
way. texmf/tex/ tree will be also less complicated...

Even Thomas' idea of plain/language.dat is somehow interesting,
I'd still vote for tex/pdftex/etex loading generic plain.tex
I remember TL5 with corrupted format files because of a bug in babel,
so we need some stable base for testing, developing own macros, etc.
Introducing pdfbplain would be the solution.

All the best,

The debian people will likely tell you that this license isn't

Hi,
I don't know if this has been corrected already:
- cmssdc10.tfm is included in ai and cmextra, but not in cm
- cmssdc10.mf is included in cm
So when only cm is installed, you have cmssdc10.mf but not
cmssdc10.tfm. Try "texdoc l2kurz" then. :-{

Yes, you are right.

I suggested to remove cz[sk]hyph.tex because I have tried to solve the
second problem of cz/sk hyphen patterns: its duplicity in two files
cz[sk]hyphen.tex versus cz[sk]hyph.tex.

The cz[sk]hyphen.tex can't be removed because the csplain is frozen
with all names of used files. There exist many home-made macros which
uses this names.

The solution of this duplicity can be following: leave cz[sk]hyph.tex
files in babel system with only one line inside:

\input czhyphen    or   \input skhyphen .

I don't see the better solution of this problem if you persists on the
short names in babel system. I persist on long names in csplain :-).

Warning: don't replace the cz[sk]hyph.tex files by these one-line
alternatives immediatelly! If you do it, the error in babelised latex
occurs. I will release the new csplain.tar with the corrected
cz[sk]hyphen.tex files which will accept the babelised formats (plain
and latex). You can change cz[sk]hyph.tex files _after_ the new
release of csplain.tar will be included into teTeX. I will plan the
new release during one-two weeks and I will report to Thomas Esser
about it.

> By the way, I found texmf/tex/enctex/ with 3 files.

Oops, I leave these files in my csplain.tar. This is my mistake.
Remove these files (can be done immediatelly). The enctex is only
an optional package, not required by CSTeX. If there exists another way
of re-encoding on TeX input preprocessor level (--transalte-file
option in web2c based TeX distributions, for example), you need not
enctex. I will remove these files in the new release of csplain.tar.

Yes. The actual problem with czhyph.tex is the next example of the
unstability of the babel.

I believe the licensing terms were usually treated differently when
dealing with fonts. I remember RMS/FSF saying something like that about
fonts, that fonts can be treated like data, and not software, and that
sometimes redistributablity is enough (but I couldn't find it after
spending a little time with google).

But I just searched debian mailing lists archives and found that they have
removed Luxi fonts from debian's XFree86 4.2.0, after they had not
received any reply from B&H about a possibility to change the license. See:

	http://lists.debian.org/debian-x/2002/debian-x-200208/msg00134.html
	http://lists.debian.org/debian-x/2002/debian-x-200208/msg00135.html

With further investigation, I found that debian is also considering IBM
Courier (which is distributed with TeX Live) and Adobe Utopia (which is in
both teTeX and TeX Live) non-free:

	http://packages.debian.org/stable/x11/xfonts-scalable-nonfree.html

What do you think about these two? Should they be removed from TL and
teTeX, or should the licensing rules be relaxed a bit for fonts?

I think whatever Debian does, we should follow, since we say that TL
follows DFSG.  Anything else seems intolerably confusing to me.

My memories of what rms has said about font licensing is that public
domain is ok, they don't need to be gpl'd (I forget exactly why this
came up).  But not that redistributability-only is ok.  But regardless
of what rms said or didn't say, I'd feel bound to follow Debian here.

Meanwhile, I doubt anyone will miss Utopia terribly, and since we have
URW Courier, we don't need IBM Courier.  So I don't think it will make
much practical difference.

If there's agreement ... can we ask the ctan folks to move those fonts
to nonfree, as well dumping them from tetex/tl?

Definitely no! CTAN's nonfree means restrictions in use or redistribution,
but not modification. See <http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/#licence>:

  Note that distributions whose licences are the non-`Debian'-free 
  category nosource is not moved to the nonfree/ tree; CTAN is concerned 
  with distributability, rather than the broader modifiability, etc., 
  that the free software movement seeks.

If it was me, I'd say DFSG with case by case exceptions for 3 (derived
works). We are targetting end users with TL, and they usually want
features and redistribution freedom, not development freedom.

Once we have a single exception, stating the licensing policy becomes
much more complicated.  Also, Debian or GNU could not take TeX Live and
redistribute it themselves (for instance).

I agree that most users will never take advantage of their freedom to

I was under the impression that TL tries to be Debian-compatible

I just have released a new teTeX pretest with the new web2c-7.3.8
prerelease. I have had a few changed to Olaf's release (nothing really
impressing, just a few minor things). These have been send to Olaf,
but I think that we should update the perforce tree as soon as possible.

The only problem that I see with putting my stuff into the perforce tree
is that some win32 related changes might get lost (since I have some
updated libs: libwww, ncurses). So, how do we proceed? Shall I just update
the perforce tree and let Fabrice recover his changes? Or shall Fabrice
first fix my changes and then update the perforce tree? Or any other idea?

BTW: Omaga is now back to teTeX-beta. Someone should have a look at it;
I don't have mnhyph.tex, so I had to disable mongolian in language.dat.

They can redistribute it. They can't modify some parts. The proper term is

It's not part of official Omega (just contrib stuff), so that's no
problem. Official Omega only has US, French, and Greek hyphenation
currently.

Hey, it is your work that made it possible. It is you who deserves all
the credit!

Be assured, however, that I'll verify that the old problems are actually
solved. I will take the sources to a SUN and try to compile with the
system tools (including lex :-) I'll tell you, if this fails... (but I
don't think so).

Ok, good to know. I am quite unsure about the texmf tree. I just have
copied from TeX Live, but I see funny things in there.  E.g. a ltpatch.ltx
in a funny place (texmf/omega/lambda/omegabook seems quite an "inofficial"
place for a LaTeX patch).

I'd love to receive bug reports: I'm starving for some clearly defined
work in Omega. :)

TL's texmf Omega is currently my semi-official Omega plus Apostolos's
Omega contributions. In short, /omega/lambda/{ocherokee,oinuit,omegabook}
and /omega/{otp,ocp}/{ethiop,ocherokee,otibet} (and some fonts in the
/fonts subtree) are his. I can't take any responsiblity for them or their
organization before I understand them.

No, this is only a temporary solution, because I am ready to patch the
{cz,sk}hyph in order you can input them from babelised plain too.
This patch will be released after TeXlive for CSTUG is fixed because
I need not any experiment in this version of TeXlive.

I need not the experiment with complicated paths suggested by Thomas too.
I need to downgrade the pdftex.ini to its contents from may 2002 in
order to we can start to burn out the CDs for CSTUG members.

Sebastian, please, can you downgrade this file (and the fmtutil.cnf) even
though it is not done in teTeX? We are waiting for iso image for CSTUG
membres.

Words like "exceptions" and "usually" fill me with horror. I personally
am only interested in a TeX Live which has no exceptions, and no
assumptions about its users.

OK, point taken. So to avoid a mess with changes in language.dat, etc.,
I'd suggest puting in texmf/tex/generic/hyphen/czhyph.tex and 
skhyph.tex as just *copies* of texmf/tex/csplain/czhyphen.tex and 
skhyphen.tex (after changes you intend to make in those files). 
Please consider the mess in all available distributions like 
teTeX, fpTeX, TeXLive, MIKTeX. Some of them have installation programs 
like TeXSetup.exe or mo.exe.

All current TeX distributions use now --translate-file, even not web2c
based MiKTeX. But information about that is missing in csplain
and cslatex docs...
By the way. It would be nice having some resume in English in csplain 
and cslatex docs.

I don't think so. I'd only want to find any consens and good solution
for all.

=====
I found in TL7 for CSTUG: texmf/pdftex/csfonts/csfont-e.map
(missing in teTeX-beta). This map file uses some .enc files not needed
for dvips. Do we really need such map file for the current pdftex?
Please observe that updmap script ignores csfont-e.map, so pdftex.map
contains only standard csfonts mapping.

Kind regards,

The csfont-e.map is obsolete and not used in current versions
of TeX distributions.

The csfont-e.map uses enc files because the old version of pdfTeX
(cca 1988) has worked bad with the map files where enc was not explicitly
written. This bug was fixed in cca 1998.

Now, the enc files are not needed in pdfTeX nor dvips because the default
encodings of Type1 csfonts are the same as in enc files.

Thus the lines of type:

csr10    csr10    <csr10.pfb

in pdftex.map and psfonts.map files are sufficient.

No, I have a better idea. Remove the files {cz|sk}hyph.tex and replace
them by files with the following contents:

I need not do any changes in the current CSTeX. That is very important for
me. You can use these files immediatelly and you cannot wait to the new
release of the CSTeX.

To Johannes L. Braams: please, adpot these files into Babel package.
I don't know the procedure to install these files in all common TeX
distributions. Moreower this is not my bussiness because this is
a Babel problem.

These files requires the csplain version Feb 2000 or newer, because the
t1code.tex file is inputted and this file occurs in csplain Feb 2000.
The teTeX and TeXlive includes this version of csplain from September
2002.

beware that if you take the debian project's interpretation of the DFSG,
insisting on DFSG may well end up with you removing the cm fonts (and
tex and latex) from tex live as well.

See the somewhat depressing threads  on debian-legal such as this one
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/debian-legal-200209/msg00086.html
seriously suggesting to re-implement from scratch some "free"
replacements for cm.


Having said that I agree with Sebastian that having individual
exceptions makes managing the CD as a whole unworkable, I just wonder if
DFSG is an acceptable baseline if they decide latex isn't free.

There is some point here which I had not thought about before: there is a
little difference between DFSG and debian-legal people. Which are we
talking about? For example, if they suddenly decide LaTeX, CMR, ... are
not DFSG-compliant, should we follow? Of course if the goal is TL's 
inclusion in debian, this point is nonsense.

pdfcslatex in TL7 contains

I'll look twice, better three times next time. Sorry, my mistake.

    For example, if they suddenly decide LaTeX, CMR, ... are
    not DFSG-compliant, should we follow?

Obviously it would be useless to produce a TeX CD without LaTeX and CM.
So if they did this, we'd have to revisit our decision.

However, if they did this, then they also couldn't include TeX or LaTeX
in Debian.  And that means Texinfo (among other packages) would stop
working.  I rather doubt this is going to happen.

It seems mostly debian-legal decides if a license complies with the DFSG.

If they decide TeX et.al are non-free, we should _demand_ that TL
is moved to non-free also and forget about debian.

But I still hope that there is some discussion going on in
private circles which will eventually solve this IMHO silly
situation.

In the case of latex, yes there is (slowly:-) but while we might
reword lppl slightly to make debian-legal happier I can't see the
the licences on the cm fonts and tex changing after all this time.

I guess an auto-upload from your side to CTAN would be great, then we can
auto-download them to TL. I guess Sebastian already has some scripts for

TL has no automation at present. My system is that I 
get mail whenever something is uploaded to CTAN or is mirrored there;
I store away all that mail and then process it when I have a moment
free. Although I have a script to automate "ctan to texlive", there
are sufficiently many weirdly-packaged things that I still need to
check the results each time

I remember about aliases, but it means that we have to install csplain
stuff even if we want just latex with czech or slovak patterns (and babel).

It means that generic/hyphen contents will be *incomplete* without

Sure, nobody wanted to do any change in CSTeX.

I don't see that's babel problem. We need generic and complete
hyphenation patterns library also for ConTeXt, Omega, etc., as well
for latex users. Moreover babel package *does not* contain hyphenation
stuff. On CTAN it is language/hyphenation/ and it seems that Johannes
is not responsible for that.

I'm still trying to consider all that problem in the context of all
distributions, like teTeX, TeX Live, fpTeX, MiKTeX (also Linux
distibutions with TeX stuff). Some of them have installation program
and allow selecting packages. So I can imagine somebody wanting latex
with, e.g., spain and czech + T1 ec (or cm-super) fonts.
To conclude:
texmf/generic/hyphen/[cz|sk]hyph.tex (independent and complete files)
 would work with latex+babel and other
texmf/csplain/[cz|sk]hyphen.tex
 would work with untouched CSTeX (csplain, cslatex).

Having files with different names doesn't mess anybody...

OK. Who is responsible to "generic hyphen patterns library"?

I did mean that the dependency is not problem. If somebody choose the
Czech language in Babel without the CSTeX package (the official
Czech+Slovak support), then he cannot be wonder that the Czech language
does not work. We have dependencies in CSTeX sub-packages too:
CSplain depends on CSfonts + CM fonts + plain + TeX core.
CSlatex depends on CSplain + latex.

But you have right and I accept your arguments.

The disadvantage of your suggestion is that if we improve the Slovak
hyphen patterns in CSTeX, the change will be not applied in the "generic
hyphen patterns library" automatically. I remember the similar
situation: we have improved the Czech hyphen patterns in 1995 but
this improved version was released only in 1999 in "generic hyphen
patterns library".

The maintainer of the "generic hyphen patterns library" can take the
czhyphen.tex, skhyphen.tex, rename it and do anything with these files.
For example he can re-encode them to 8bit convention.
You can see from comments that the software in these files is GPL like.
If the maintainer of the "generic hyphen patterns library" does not accept
my one-line solution which makes the cz|sh patterns depend to csplain, he
can do another solution. He can take some macros from my t1code.tex too.

Who do it?

Message-ID: <Pine.HPP.3.95.1021016110302.608C-100000@elrond.imf.au.dk>

I have almost succesfully build TL 7 on HPUX 10.20. My only problem now is
xdvik.

It compiles fine (and seems to works fine, is there any sort of
interactive way of testing the system to check whether the compiled
programs works as they should??) when I use the options

--without-xdvik --without-oxdvik

for the configuration.

This last night I tried using  the following

sh -c "./configure
--prefix=/net/smaug/raid/gondor/lost+found/daleif/source/TeXLive7
--enable-multiplatform --x-includes=/usr/contrib/X11R6/include
--x-libraries=/usr/contrib/X11R6/lib > conf-gandalf-151002-1635 2>&1"

Which afterwards crashed while running gmake

log files can be found at

and

http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/world-gandalf-151002-1825.log

Ofcourse we could just use the version og xdvi that already are on our
UNIX system, but it is a bit old and I would like the LaTeX installation
to use the exact same program versions on both UNIX and Linux.

I used the source from CD 2 for this compilation.

As mentions above, without the xdvi stuff everything works fine.

Any ideas?

The following configure message:

checking where the main texmf tree is located... not found
configure: warning: The main texmf tree was not found.
  Specify the location of its parent directory with the --datadir option.
  If you do not have the files, you can retrieve a minimal set from
  ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/texklib.tar.gz, which is mirrored on CTAN hosts
  in systems/web2c.  Winging it by using the default location
  /net/smaug/raid/gondor/lost+found/daleif/source/TeXLive7/share/texmf.

is almost always a bad sign, and you should try to get rid of it.
(Is there in fact a share/texmf tree in
/net/smaug/raid/gondor/lost+found/daleif/source/TeXLive7/
which you have specified as --prefix?)

I don't see how this error is related to xdvik - it seems to be
a compilation error with libtiff (which is not needed for xdvik)?

FWIW, Thomas Esser reported that the latest release of xdvik,
22.40n, compiles OK on HP-UX-(can't remember the exact version).
Could you try to upgrade to that version, using e.g. the
procedure described in item (b) on
http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/cvs-upgrade.html
?

I think that there is no single "point of responsibility" for this.
There is a directory on CTAN and whoever wants can submit files to it.

I have put your solution into teTeX-beta (until someone has something
"better"). Thanks.

Wait for an updated TeX Live or teTeX-beta. Unless you know what you
are doing, you should not run autoconf.

- compare the sizes of the format files
- compare the debug output from running latex with KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1
  (could be that some searching goes mad)

I have no idea about that and suggest that you write a bug report:
  "Email bug reports to tex-k@mail.tug.org."

updmap has a config file where things can be set up. You can read this
configuration file, the screen output of the program (check for any
"map file not found" message) and the output files. Please look up
these details.

If you use TeX Live, no formats will be build when tunning a "make
install". That's different in teTeX-beta.

As I have written earlier, this is completely irrelevant for you.

I guess this is was related to bitmap fonts, because these connot be
copyrighted in the US. Things are different for programs and type1 fonts
(and metafont source files) are considered to be programs as far as
copyright law is concerned (but I am not a lawyer and might be wrong;
that's just my understanding of these things).

I just zapped Adobe Utopia and the metrics. One has to be careful not

Fortunatelly there is no `Central Commitee' or like... ;-)
I think that best patterns for Czech and Slovak can be prepared only by
CSTUG members and uploaded to CTAN, e.g., ftp://ftp.dante.de/incoming
followed by a short message sent to ctan@dante.de (Cc: ctan-ann@dante.de).
CTAN guys are enough competent and kind to put it immediately into
language/hyphenation (or, if you wish, to language/czech with a link to
language/hyphenation/).

See above. If you send it to CTAN, all TeX developers would be informed.
It is good time to check what's on CTAN concerning Czech and Slovak.

Nobody will touch it. It only depends on you (CSTUG), so please, do 
not hesitate. For me it's quite natural and OK that you have freedom 
for special treatment of csplain and cslatex, so I can only make
suggestion to clean the stuff dedicated for all other people (e.g. those
using latex+babel, even if I do not use that ;-). Please observe that
the problem was reported by Roozbeh Pournader <roozbeh@sharif.edu> on

I'm sorry if this is the wrong list. But if it is a bug it should interest
us all.

I have a ps file one page, that we convert into pdf using epstopdf. But
something goes terribly wrong, depending on the versions

Files:

prefix: http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/

gs550epstopdf27.pdf
gs651epstopdf25.pdf
original-ps.ps

In the file names I've included the versions used.

It works ok with gs 5.50 and epstopdf 2.7 and goes wrong with gs 6.51 and
epstopdf 2.5.

Does anyone know what goes wrong here?

Message-ID: <Pine.HPP.3.95.1021017130652.22284D-100000@smaug.imf.au.dk>

I was just woundering if special care has to be taken when preparing a
multiplatform LaTeX installation (Linux + HPUX) with shared texmf tree.

It is more in the lines of the format files. Since the configuration under
linux runs smoothly I'm just use those under UNIX as well. 

So I was just woundering if there might be a problem with that?

BTW: As some might have noticed I'm compiling the source for HPUX and have
been succesfull using the source from TL7 CD2 but without the (o)xdvi
stuff. It seems to run just fine, but haven't tested that extensively.

It has some difficulties when compiling with xdvi stuff, right now it is
trying the newest source from CTAN. What are the differences (besides the
xdvi stuff)?

BTW2: It might be a good idea to have the bugs and updates page at
tug.org updated, since the source file is newer that the images. 


BTW3: What is the easiest way to install/update packages using TL 7 on
UNIX/linux? There has come quite a few interesting stuff after the release
of Tl 7.

I am talking a little perpendicular to that, that although the law
considers some fonts to be computer programs, they are not generally like
other pieces of software, and you may not need the freedoms that are 
usual with free software that much, and that a definition of "Free Fonts" 
may be a little broader than "Free Software". That freely redistributable 
but non-modifiable fonts are not as bad as freely redistributable but 
non-modifiable software, even in RMS's mind set.

and asks about the bad output in gs651epstopdf25.pdf.

I've been a ghostscript beta tester for several years, and have gotten
used to this sort of thing.  I keep 40+ versions of ghostscript around
to test just this sort of thing.
	
It does indeed seem to be a bug in gs-6.51.  

I made a simple wrapper script that tried each of these 6.x and 7.x
Aladdin ghostscript versions:

	6.01 6.0 6.20 6.21 6.22 6.23 6.30 6.31 6.32 6.50 6.61 6.62
	6.63 6.64 7.00 7.02 7.03 7.04 7.20 7.21 7.22 7.30
	
I skipped the earlier 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x versions.  I got correct
output from all of them, but notice that 6.51 is not among them.

Version 6.51 is absent from all of my architectures; my build-log
history shows that I jumped from 6.50 to 6.61.  Those builds are
from 5-dec-2000 and 24-Feb-2001.

Digging further, I found that version 6.51 is a GNU release, which
I've normally not built.  I got its distribution from

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ghostscript/ghostscript-6.51.tar.gz

but found it broken: it is missing Makefiles and configure script.

I suggest that you upgrade to the latest stable GNU version:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ghostscript/ghostscript-7.05.tar.gz

or if you are adventurous, try the latest:

	ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/test/ghostscript-7.22.tar.bz2

if you can get a connection (I cannot at the moment.)

Actually the wierd thing is that the combination of 

epstopdf version 2.7 2001/03/05

combined with

GNU Ghostscript 6.51 (2001-03-28)

works just fine (on Linux).

I'm not able to update the GS versions since I don't have root access.
Our GS installation (on Linux, our UNIX machines are also running GNU GS
6.51) comes with the RedHat dist.


The epstopdf version is just the one distributed with TeXLive 7.

If you used the HP compiler, try giving it the +u option.  Disabling
all optimizations may or may not make a difference as well.

In the meantime, I have received the following from Staszek Wawrykiewicz:

  While testing dvips(k) 5.92a from teTeX-beta-20021013 I found that dvips
  is fragile on included graphics with CRLF EOLs, e.g., made in Windows:

  dvips: Bad syntax in included font usage table etc.

  The following is a small example, made in Win mpost.

Staszek has already send his report to Tomas Rokicki, so we don't need
to do this.

Message-ID: <Pine.HPP.3.95.1021018140333.1760E-100000@elrond.imf.au.dk>

Using the newest source from CTAN (6 aug 2002) I haven't been able to
compile TL 7 with (o)xdvi

(BTW: what is oxdvi?)

using

time sh -c "./configure
--prefix=/net/smaug/raid/gondor/lost+found/daleif/TeXLive7
--enable-multiplatform --x-includes=/usr/contrib/X11R6/include
--x-libraries=/usr/contrib/X11R6/lib > conf-gandalf-181002-1015.log 2>&1"

for configuring

We get som problems while compiling.

Log files are (prefix http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/)

conf-gandalf-181002-1015.log
world-gandalf-181002-1035.log

A snip from the world log:

Might suggest that there is a problem in the Xaw or Xmu files. But at
least the two XShape* words above does apear as text inside some of the
files in  the libXaw.a and libXmu.a files. 


Is is a problem with our X stuff??

Alternativly what would happen if we used the xdvi that are already on our
system together with the format files set in the shared texmf tree?

It's the omega variant of xdvi. I guess you won't need it.

try adding
-lXext
to the linker flags and see if this fixes things ... I'm not sure
who's to blame here: If Xaw needs the shape extension, does xdvik
need to have a configure check for it, and add it to the linker
flags?

That should work, provided that the original xdvi finds the fonts
etc. in your shared texmf tree.

Stefan

Message-ID: <200210181521.g9IFLgx11916@f7.net>

    who's to blame here: If Xaw needs the shape extension, does xdvik
    need to have a configure check for it, and add it to the linker
    flags?

Looking at the the last configure.in for xdvik that I worked on, I see this:

# -lXext may not be present, and that may be ok.  Link with it only if it is.
if test -z "$x_ext_lib"; then # allow envvar override
  AC_CHECK_LIB(Xext, XextCreateExtension,
               x_ext_lib=-lXext, :, -lX11 $X_EXTRA_LIBS)
fi
AC_SUBST(x_ext_lib)

So I conclude that different X distributions do this differently -- and
that there is no -lXext on the system at hand.

I guess more complex test would be needed -- one that tries to actually
use whatever function it is in xdvik that results in needing the XShape*
functions.

Ugh.

Well, I think in that case we're lost: xdvi(k) itself doesn't use
the XShape* functions at all; it's probably Xaw that uses them.

(FWIW, Paul's configure in non-k xdvi just uses -lXext always
when -lXaw is used, which might be the right thing to do.)

So I guess that if we were to support a missing -lXext, we'd
need to disable the toolkit altogether. However compiling without
toolkit support isn't actively maintained in xdvik any more,
and we're actually planning to remove it altogether ...

So Lars, are you really missing a libXext.{so,a} on that system?
In that case there indeed appears to be a mismatch between libXaw
and the rest of your X installation.

BTW, another remark on
http://home.imf.au.dk/daleif/conf-gandalf-181002-1015.log
- you've still got these
   checking where the main texmf tree is located... not found
   configure: warning: The main texmf tree was not found.
warnings in there ...?

Stefan

*Don't panic!* :-)

It's just my --with-cxx-runtime-hack (which is enabled by default in
TeX Live) that messes up the -lXext check.

This was recently reported on the texlive list and fixed by me.

So, the current TeX Live source should be ok. BTW: I have merged the
latest xdvik stuff into TeX Live yesterday.

Message-ID: <20021018140910.A5451978@aisa.fi.muni.cz>

	Hello,

I was reported a small problem with -translate-file in cs* scripts on
win platforms. All the (pdf)cslatex/plain.bat use -translate-file. If
they used -default-translate-file, this switch could be overriden with
command line and/or file setting.

I consulted the problem with CSTUG board members and we consider this a
bug (voting 6:0 :-). Can you please change all -translate-file options
in those scripts into -default-translate-file?

Thank you,
D.A.

Oh ;-) I wouldn't have thought of that possibility ...

Thanks, that's great! It's good to know that xdvik is kept in
sync between teTeX and TeXLive in this way.

But wasn't there a plan for keeping all free packages explained in the

Can you send the list of packag sizes, or some script to compute it?

It is an impressive example of the TeX power, it would be a pity to
let it go.

that was a plan, yes, but I don't think its such an important

interesting. I didnt know about Icking's untimely death, thats sad.

the trouble is, all packages are used by *someone*,
so its hard to sort out. I am torn between the contrasting claims of

 * the CJK fonts. hard to deny a place for something with so many 
   potential users

Not a fast solution, but what about automatic gunzipping feature in
web2c/kpathsea? Is anybody working on this?

I guess cm-super makes some other font packages redundant, perhaps `ai'

        The purpose of the AI font distribution is to improve the
        final conversion to Postscript and PDF formats of TeX
        documents which use the standard Computer Modern and AMS
        fonts.

and others, but it is difficult to make sure quickly.

Are the *.tfm files really needed in packages such as eco

        This is a set of font metric files and virtual fonts for using
        the ec fonts with oldstyle numerals.

Anyway the package seems too large relative to its practical value.

Last but not least, I would not hesitate to remove all the packages
related to specific journals, such as

        IEEEtran.cls provides LaTeX formatting for authors of the
        Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
        Transactions Journals.


Regards

Janusz

P.S. Does anybody try to keep track of the total number of copies of
TL7 published by TUG and national groups?

Currently texmf/source is larger than 60Mb. Maybe you can put a
bzipped tarball of the texmf/source dir when building cdrom.
That will save more than 20Mb (maybe even more than 30Mb).

    What software uses AFM files at runtime these days? 

I don't remember anything (in core texmf) ever using afm files at
runtime.  Just afm2tfm and fontinst?

    Can I compress them all as a matter of principle?

If you can compress them, can you compress the source files
(individually) too :)?  Seems like this is the single easiest way to
reclaim a lot of space.

I think source is a bit different. casual browsing of the source
tree seems to me a little more common than reading AFM files.

I am now down to 649Mbytes, so I am ok for a few days :-}

    casual browsing of the source

Anyone who uses emacs will get decompression automatically, and I bet a
lot of the people who would be interested in the source use emacs.

And for people who don't use emacs, is typing zmore/zgrep/etc any harder
than typing more/grep/etc?

The need for space seems much more important to me than keeping the
sources uncompressed.

true. I agree, that should be the next thing to attack when I

There is qxcm! (since TeX Live 5 and 2000 ;-) It only needs some .fd and
.sty files... (perhaps also some .enc files)

thats odd. my strategy is to grab the package and do a du -s -k on the
resulting tree, then delete it

    Something strang with counting algorithm... Some examples

Maybe I'm missing something, but it sounds like the difference between
actual disk blocks consumed (which is what du counts) and byte sizes.
If there are lots of small files, there will be many more disk blocks
used than the byte count would indicate.

texfont.pl by Hans, with  ConTeXt. In principle, it  can be adapted to
uncompress them. However,  as usual, the ones  that are annoying (from
the disk space point of view)  are not the  vast majority of them, but
mainly the cm-super ones (remove them and you will understand).

also, ps2pk may use AFM files, if i remember correctly.

yes, cm-super AFM files are not needed for TeX & friends - they are
only useful if one wants to install the fonts in other apps (e.g. for
ATM). so cm-super AFM files could be removed from TeX Live - that will
save 8Mb.

And on ISO-format CDs the block size is 2048 bytes (IIRC) which means
on average 1024 bytes of space wasted per file.

Install any kind of type1 font for ConTeXt (with different naming
scheme than usuall NFSS/kb naming).

Yes, but anyway they are quite huge with regard to the whole set of
afm files.

I don't know if this have been mantioned before but.....

acording to the installation guidelines from the psnfss 9 the file 8r.enc,
must only occure once in the TeX system. But there is one both in

texmf/dvips/base
and
texmf/dvips/psnfss

kpsewhich choooses the first one. But the two files are not the same.

Again acording to the guidelines in the 00readme.txt file from the updated
psnfss 9.0a it should on a TDS based system reside in the later directory.
And there should only be one.

Should I remove the one inside texmf/dvips/base (it is the newest)?

How are the packages for the TeXLive distribution choosen?

I was just woundering quite a bit about the fact that the version of the
geometry package is 2.3 from 2000?!

This was fixed in TeX Live (perforce tree) after TL7 was made.

We can fix texfont.pl to accomodate gzipped files. Or even fix pathsea
to accomodate gzip files.

Message-ID: <0EFA8A2E-E666-11D6-85A6-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

Since my update to Mac OS X 10.2 I could not compile TeX Live anymore. 
Running a compile ends when compiling xpdf:

c++ -g -O2 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -I.. -I./../goo -I. -I. -DPDF_PARSER_ONLY 
-c FontFile.cc
FontFile.h:27: storage size of `_ZTI8FontFile' isn't known

FontFile.h:144: storage size of `_ZTI16TrueTypeFontFile' isn't known
make[3]: *** [FontFile.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [libs/xpdf/xpdf/libxpdf.a] Error 2

When I compile the same sources with g++2, there is no problem.

So, I have reverted to the use of gcc2 (which they luckily ship also), 
but I am curious if others could corroborate that gcc 3.1 cannot 
compile TeX Live. I am using

c++ (GCC) 3.1 20020420 (prerelease)

Subject: [tex-live] Make extras fails
Message-ID: <8799B389-E681-11D6-85A6-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

LS,

I am unable to get TeX Live to compile and install here. The reason is  
the 'make extras' in the main Makefile. The problem here is that the  
extras 'build' phases includes install and configure phases which do  
not work properly. This is on a system where /usr/local/TeX does *not*  
exist and where I run my own configure statement (because the Build  
script does not contain the --without-x11 flag for configure). Besides,  
I need to override CC and CXX for the compile to function at all on Mac  
OS X 10.2.

Here is a part of my makefile that lives 2 levels above the TeX Live  
Build directory. One can see that there is nothing special here.

TARGET=source.development

MYCC=gcc2
MYCXX=g++2

configure-tex:
	(cd TeXLive/Build/${TARGET}; \
          CC=${MYCC} CXX=${MYCXX} ./configure --enable-multiplatform  
--without-x11 --prefix=`pwd` --datadir=`pwd` )

compile-tex:
	(cd TeXLive/Build/${TARGET}; CC=${MYCC} CXX=${MYCXX} make)

install-tex:
	(cd TeXLive/Build/${TARGET}; CC=${MYCC} CXX=${MYCXX} make install)
	(cd TeXLive/Build/${TARGET}; CC=${MYCC} CXX=${MYCXX} make extras)


And this is what happen in this very default situation:

(cd TeXLive/Build/source.development; CC=gcc2 CXX=g++2 make extras)
Makefile:137: warning: overriding commands for target `uninstall'
Makefile:98: warning: ignoring old commands for target `uninstall'
(cd TeX/texk/kpathsea; make all install)
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.

Subject: [tex-live] Problem with klibtool and/or kpathsea install on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <8F84048F-E684-11D6-85A6-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

When klibtool installs libkpathsea in its libdir destination, the 
timestamp on the library file gets newer than the ranlib table of 
contents. As a result, a non-functional (linking against it will fail) 
libkpathsea.a is installed. As a result, a 'make extras' on TeX Live 
will always fail because this includes a kpathsea install and a 
reconfigure of ttf2pk, which checks for kpathsea (this while procedure 
is confused in itself, but let's not get into that)

The kpathsea makefile sets the RANLIB variable, but this seems not to 
effect klibtool.

To be able to install TeX Live on systems where the ranlib table of 
contents is checked against the file date, this needs to be fixed. 
Could anyone please do this (it is beyond my capabilities) and sync it 
with the TeX Live source.development repository? My TeX distribution 
and support for TeX on Mac OS X is stalled as long as this has not been 
fixed.

Thanks,

G

Message-ID: <Pine.HPP.3.95.1021023145332.6678H-100000@smaug.imf.au.dk>

I have to agree with who ever it was that stated that the source was
broken.

For me compilation of TL 7 on HP-UX 10.20 works fine, when ever I choose
not to make (o)xdvi.

I have a shared installation, so I just went to sourgeforgem got the exact
same version as there is in the Linux binaries. Compiled it with the exact
same options (to the configure script) as I did with TL 7.

No problem at all, 40 mins later I had what seems to be a functioning xdvi
for HPUX 10.20 (and 11).

Just move the xdvi.bin into the bin/hp.. and stole the xdvi script from
the linux dist.

Works fine :-)


So I think I'll do my installation this way.

BTW: in an earlier mail someone mentionen that the texmf tree have been
updated (after the release og TL 7) and some versions fixed. Can I get a
hold of that texmf tree, and is it fully functionally?

That way I don't need to do so much package updating, whivh is quite a
pain in the behind. Isn't there an easier way of updating the texmf tree.
Someone told me that the MikTeX dist for windows had some kind of "update
packages" functionality. And I think the windows version of TL 7 has
something similar. How about the Linux version?

Message-ID: <200210231322.g9NDMBFI000705@gauss.informatik.uni-hannover.de>

Hi,

yesterday, I have merged Olaf's just-released web2c-7.3.9 into TeX Live
(change #2466). Olaf's original announcement of web2c 7.3.9 was:

    I've put web2c 7.3.9 sources up on tug.org in ~ftp/tex.  Thus they'll
    appear on CTAN in due course.

    The sources contain preliminary versions of pdftex and omega.  Omega
    has been hacked to use a different extension for its format files:
     .oft instead of .fmt, as the latter clashes with TeX's default.  I'd
    much prefer to use .ofmt, but am not convinced that would be a good
    idea, as truncating that extension gives .ofm, which is already
    in use.  On the other hand, feel free to convince me otherwise.

    These sources are especially meant to allow Thomas and Fabrice and
    me to sync up with each other, and may be of limited interest to
    anyone else (though they should be fully functional).  Expect this
    release to be superceded "soon".

So, the main purpose of that release is to have a point to sync on the
way to the next web2c release. Yesterday's teTeX-beta is exactly at the
same level now.

I'd say, resync and check if everything works for you. This release now
uses -jobname instead of -fmt for creating formats, so that change might
cause further adjustments (texexec comes into my mind which also creates
format files).

depends what you mean by "start a file". if you have a TeX file
called "test.tex", get a command line
and type
 tex test.tex
etc

I am not sure what level of TeX use you are at,

Message-ID: <2764E8F8-E74C-11D6-85A6-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

On my system there are currently two TeX installations: /usr/local/TeX  
and /usr/local/teTeX. They are more or less identical. Important for my  
problem is the fact that both have a top-level texmf.cnf, which starts  
like this:

% Our directory setup as explained in  
$SELFAUTOPARENT/share/README.macosx
% TEXMFMAIN contains the main TEXMF tree
TEXMFMAIN = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf
% TEXMFOS contains Mac OS specific defaults and additions
TEXMFOS = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.os
% TEXMFLOCAL contains any local system TeXadmin overrides
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.local
% $VARTEXMF is where texconfig writes its local settings
VARTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL
% User texmf trees can be catered for like this...
HOMETEXMF = $HOME/Library/texmf

I have a small perl file whith the following commands:

system( "which kpsewhich");
system( "kpsewhich --format='web2c files' updmap.cfg");

Here is my problem. When the path is (never mind the reason why this  
path is like it is):

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/../../bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current:/ 
usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Network/Users/gerben

I get

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/../../bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current/ 
kpsewhich
/usr/local/TeX/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg

The second line is wrong (in fact what /usr/local/TeX is, is the prefix  
with which kpathsea has been compiled, it is the compiled-in fallback).  
It should be:

/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current/kpsewhich
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/web2c/updmap.cfg

which is what I get when the path is

/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/ 
sbin:/sbin:/Network/Users/gerben

In other words: does SELFAUTO... not work when I have stuff like ../..  
in my PATH?

Yes, that's broken.

A shorter example:

$ export PATH=/software/oss/Text/teTeX-1.0/share/texmf/../../bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu:$PATH
$ kpsewhich -expand-var=\$SELFAUTOLOC
/software/oss/Text/teTeX-1.0/share/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu

That "share" should not be there...

Very weird, as these types should be generated by the compiler.  Is
this the very first file the C++ compiler tries to compile?

I tried with "g++-3.2 (GCC) 3.2.1 20020924 (Debian prerelease)" which
didn't choke.

It surely looks to me like this particular _pre_release of g++ is
broken.

One of LilyPond (http://www.lilypond.org) folks wants to compile
a new version. If he uses 'standard' RedHat TeX setup, everything is 
fine. However, if he uses the setup at my department (which he would 
prefer) and which is based on TeXLive, the compilation fails with:

ERROR: Please install required programs:  kpathsea (libkpathsea-dev or
kpathsea-devel package) Else, please specify the location of your kpathsea
using --with-kpathea-include and --with-kpathsea-lib options. You should
install kpathsea; see INSTALL.txt. Rerun ./configure --without-kpathsea only if
kpathsea is not available for your platform.

The compilation was done with the current Master/bin/i386-linux.

Any helpful hints for a shortcut how to make it work?

TeX Live has static kpathsea compiled in, so the dynamic libraries
are not available. Lilypond expects to find them, so it fails.

The answer is to install teTeX *as well* as TeX Live, I am afraid.

No, I cannot easily fix this in TeX Live, because TL does not do

Well, TeX Live has everything you need. Just do an normal installation,
then unpack the sources and do
  cd TeX/texk/kpathsea
  ./configure; make; make install

TeX Live cannot provide the necessary files. The headers depend on the
compiler you use.

It improves matters, though there is still at least one case that the
code doesn't handle correctly (example /foo/../bar).

TeX Live is all free software. The only cost is for production of the
CD. Contact the TUG office (office@tug.org) and tell them
how many CDs you need.

The best way to proceed is to set up a Mauritian TeX Users Group
and make copies of the CD for local distribution. You are more than
welcome to pull the CD image down and make copies.

Message-ID: <52AEDC7A-E861-11D6-85A6-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

As I currently (due to hardware problems) only have a Mac SO X 10.2 
installation, I configure and compile on Mac OS X 10.2. But many people 
use my binary distribution for Mac OS X also on a previous version: 
10.1.5.

As it turns out, on 10.2 the function mkstmeps() is available on 10.2 
but not on 10.1. As a result, running the binary on 10.1 fails:

"running `pdftex -ini   -jobname=pdflatex -progname=pdflatex 
pdflatex.ini' ...
dyld: pdftex Undefined symbols:
pdftex undefined reference to _mkstemps expected to be defined in 
/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
Error: `pdftex -ini  -jobname=pdflatex -progname=pdflatex pdflatex.ini' 
failed
"

Is there a way for me during the configure stage on 10.2 to tell 
configure on te command line that mkstemps() should not be used? This 
happens in the xpdf library.

Thanks,

G

Set
  ac_cv_func_mkstemps=no
in your environment before running configure.

Or, edit
  libs/xpdf/aconf.h
after running configure and remove the line
  #define HAVE_MKSTEMPS 1

mkstemps?  I've heard of mkstemp but not mkstemps.

I don't know if it will help, but there's a replacement function

for mktemp, need these files (including adding to EXTRA_DIST):

$GNULIBSRC/m4/prereq.m4		m4

Since this is a problem with xpdf and there is a new version of
xpdf in beta testing (which will be integrated into pdfTeX when
it's released), it might be worthwile to contact it's author and
try to compile the beta version.

xpdf is perfectly ok, in my opinion. Gerben wants to do some non-standard
thing (compile on platform version x and run the binaries on platform
version x-1), so my suggested work-around (make GNU autoconf think that
the function is not available) seems adequate.

Message-ID: <Pine.HPP.3.95.1021027125044.19321B-100000@elrond.imf.au.dk>

Since the geometry package in TL 7 is from 2000 and the newest version is
from ealier this year, I was woundering if it's possible to access a more
recent or updated version of the texmf tree usable for a TL 7
installation? That way I don't have to update various packages by hand.

Another thing. Walter Schmidt says in the readme for psnfss the the file
8r.enc should only exist once in the texmf tree (in /dvips/psnfss). In the
standard texmf tree for TL 7 I think I found 3. And kpsewhich returns the
one in dvips/base. Isn't this a problem, especially when I update psnfss
to version 9.0a?


BTW: The source IS broken (compiling on HPUX 10.20). The linking
conserning (o)xdvi isn't right, or
something like that compiles fine without (o)xdvi.
Now I just installed xdvi seperately with the exact same configure options
used for TL 7 compilation. It works fine.

Though I now don't have oxdvi, but I don't know anyone here using omega,
so that might not be a problem.

Which CD you install depends on what your operating system is.  Here is a 
summary:

CD1 supports:

Intel Linux
Mac OS X
Windows 9X/ME/NT/2K/XP (Win32)

CD2 supports:

Compaq Alpha-Linux
Compaq Alpha-OSF
Irix
Solaris
AIX

Normally a card is inserted with the CD's prior to mailing, indicating the 
above.  I apologize if you did not receive it.

>I am assuming that I must use an editor to write the code but after that I

Yes.  WinEdt is a popular choice.  Please see: http://winedt.com

>Where besides the Book by Donald Knuth I find  how to code the typeset 
>codes for a Math manuscript. Any help in this subject will be appreciated.

Here are a couple of URL's that may help:

http://silmaril.ie/downloads/ --  click on "The LaTeX Brochure"

http://www.tug.org.in/tutorials.html

The newsgroup "comp.text.tex" is a very good resource as well.

I do hope this helps.

This is all about TeX Live 7.

1)

Acording to Walter Schmidt's README inside the 9.0a update of psnfss there
should one be one incidence og the 8r.enc encoding file, and it should be
in texmf/dvips/psnfss (TDS based).

Doing a simple find . -name 8r.enc (On a linux box) result in this

./texmf/dvips/base/8r.enc
./texmf/dvips/psnfss/8r.enc
./texmf/xdvi/8r.enc
./texmf/vtex/enc/8r.enc

And kpsewhich returns the first one. This means that when I update the
psnfss system, it updates ./texmf/dvips/psnfss/8r.enc, but that will noget
change any thing since the system uses ./texmf/dvips/base/8r.enc.

What should I do here. Should I erase some of these?

2)
I'm woundering about the permissions set by the installation. On our
multiuser system, the sys admins (I'm note one of them) doesn't like the
fact that there are dirs with writing permissions for everyone. No problem
actually, since the user created fonts are placed in $HOME/texmf/fonts.

But here is what I'm woundering about.

texmf/fonts/tfm

why are the permissions on the dirs and subdirs here set to be

drwxrwxrwt

Surely the normal users shouldn't be allowed to mess with these.

Could it cause any trouble removing the write permissions here?


3)
Is there a newer version of the texmf tree (updated packages) avaliable
somewhere?
There were a few problems with the one distributed with TL 7.

no offence, but that doesn't help me much. I also posted the message that
the above was a reply to.

I don't know where I get (access to) the perforce tree. So I'd rather want
to know which of the files I have to remove.

Sorry if I sound a bit rude, it wasn't my intention.

hmm. you can certainly take off that w and g write permission. its
probably deternind by the default umask of the person installing the
files.

I don't think that is a good idea; otherwise, the tex-live list,
currently for developers, will reduce to a forum for newbies asking
how to mount a CD, or asking what is TeX good for?

I don't know if there is a better solution, however, except possibly a
separate maildrop at tug.org that would be vetted by a human staffer.

With GNU mailman, one can have subscription requests held for
moderator approval; perhaps that is the way to go.

The contact address for newbies at tug.org is tug-support@tug.org
(lately also office@tug.org). They are advertised on the home page.
Both are active and responsive. I agree that giving the tex-live 
as yet another contact address, as suggested by Art, is not a good idea.

It's not always obvious whether a subscription request comes from 
a newbie or not (unless one asks explicitly, which I'd like to avoid).

You should also tell that people will feel very welcome here after they 
join. That was definitely the case with me and I guess many others.

Subject: [tex-live] Free software and software licenses
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1035994473.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

This note, cross-posted to several lists, is to draw your attention to
the recent article ``Open Source is good for America - US military
advised'', by Andrew Orlowski, available at

	http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/27822.html

It in turn points to the 160-page report ``Use of Free and Open-Source
Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense: Version: 1.2'',
prepared by the MITRE Corporation for the U.S. Defense Information
Systems Agency, available at

	http://www.egovos.org/pdf/dodfoss.pdf

That report tabulates scores of open source software projects,
including emacs, gawk, ghostscript and LaTeX (but curiously, omits
TeX), and in particular, includes about 100 pages of software licenses
that accompany these packages.

By this posting, I do not wish to reopen debates on software licenses,
but rather, I felt that the collection of so many of them in one place
would be a very helpful reference for those of you who sometime might
have to be involved in software licensing questions.

And it has the LaTeX license wrong: It lists it as GPL. :-(

Best regards

PS: I'm quite sure they also use pdfTeX :-}
