Hi, whenever I use the package mathpazo I get these warnings from LaTeX,
this did not happen in TeXLive 6...
Any help resolving the problem would be be greatly apperciated.

Below I have pasted the messages I get when running (PDF/)LaTex. Line 51

I don't remember if Don Knuth has accept the tcx, but I remember that
my alternative solution (so called encTeX, year 1998) was not accepted
by web2c team. My solution is more more flexible: it manages with
xord/xchr+"printable_set" by new primitives and the setting is stored
into format by \dump. I have added only the second line after banner
about encTeX extension because pdfTeX has another banner than TeX (the
similar trick as in MLTeX).

The encTeX was rejected by web2c team and eTeX team for the TeX
license reasons.

tcx tables seems to be not violate the TeX license because the
xord/xchr+"printable_set" initialising is in system dependent part of
tex.web. Author of TeX menas that these values are set depending on
used system. The tcx tables do only this work. The only difference is
that this work is done on the run-time and not on the compile-time.
This is comparable with TeX-memory parameterers. In the old days, it
would be possible to change these parameters only at compile-time
but in new web2cTeX we can change them on run-time.

Absolutely. Please let's do the fix and do this too.

I am very much in favour of spending a short time extra to get things

I think it is a very bad idea to divert from normal behaviour. It starts 
small but in fact you are creatingh a new TeX standard. Anyway, if that 
is what happens, why not just use this banner:

This is TeXLive, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.3.7)

June 8 is my wedding party (and after that I'm a week on honeymonn so 
any recompile should happen before or after that unless I find a ssh 
client on our honeymoon site which is not very likely).

As you know, I have spent some time on TeX for Mac OS X and TeX Live the 
last year. I have a request for all of you as a surprise for my wife. 
Send a "thank you" card to my wife Renée (who had to put up with all the

PS. I originally just put this request on the TeX for Mac OS X mailing 
list but decided it would be nice if there really were a lot of cards...

   banner
 * Fabrice will commit source changes today
 * we aim to get a recompile of tex, etex, and pdftex by Sunday 2300 GMT
 * the update to also include dvips 5.90

well, not so much of a proposal as a statement :-}

Yet Another Mistake by me. by the luck of the gods, the src-special
catastrophe will let it be corrected as a by product.

I may have a fix for the \special issue that avoids the problems that
arise with redefining \special.

I'm at the point where redefining \special doesn't affect source
specials.

The second problem is that source specials can be "captured" into
arguments and such, because they're (mostly, but not exclusively)
ordinary specials inserted into the token stream.  It seems the
"\everypar" example can be made to work by postponing the creation of
the source special for that paragraph until after the everypar
processing has been done.

Would this be good enough for now?

For what it's worth, here are the changes I came up with, and with
which I'm currently most comfortable: no change in the first banner
line (sorry), an additional banner line if source specials are
enabled, and some trickery to prevent redefinition and the known case
of accidental capture (\everypar).

 # Tests...

The other .mk files seems ok from this point of view.

Anyway, we should also  integrate Olaf's patch for the special
mechanism. And also make pdftex pdf backend quite about the specials.

This raises the question of banners : should we stick with one line
addition or change them ? The main problem I see with changing banners
is that we will need to change them in several places each new release
of pdftex.

Are you really convinced that someone will not find another occasion
like the \everypar one in which you'll get a funny result? I'm not!
I'd be much happier to stick with the banner change.

Neither am I.  However ...

... these changes are localized and comparatively simple.  While I got
the banner change to work, the way in which I did so promises to be
comparatively hard to maintain.

Given the amount of time it took for even this case to be discovered,
I really prefer to make just these simple fixes now and use more time
(e.g., TL 8) to make definitive ones.

I used 'euTeX' in my tests, but not because 'eu' means 'not' (it
doesn't, and it doesn't stand for European Union either).

Is there a way I can see those changes on the web or so?  I haven't
checked out a copy of the 'source' tree, only 'source.development'.

I think I've screwed up etex, though.,,,,

I have submitted the patch that Olaf and Fabrice have suggested.
That fixes it and not it all compiles cleanly.

You would definitely prefer the banner change *not* to be made,
because you feel it would raise expectations about the way web2c
is going? I don't want to do that at all. On the other hand,
I don't want anyone to point at me and say "you broke the rules". Can
you imagine what Jonathan Fine will say when he reads this lot?

Sorry for that.  BTW, would it still be possible to submit a newer
version?

Try

  KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1 xdvi CJKbabel.dvi &> xdvi.log

and check the search paths.  Note that mktextfm has to be called to
generate the la* files (this is from the Cyrillic LH fonts in T2A
encoding).

Subject: [tex-live] pdftex collection incomplete?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206020355320.15087-100000@chronos.ipipan.gda.pl>

I found on TUG changed `Basic TeX' scheme (texlive-basic.tpm)
with added context and etex collections. It seems to me that people
no more can have really *basic* installation (tex, latex, pdftex,
metapost) ;-))
All that mess is because pdftex needs 2 files to work, borrowed from
ConTeXt. Last year (TL6) `pdftex collection' contained
those macros and I think the standalone pdftex still has them.

As ConTeXt depends on installing also eTeX, the `basic' (???)
installation contains now:
 texmf/tex/contex/ ~5.2mb
 texmf/tex/latex/  ~4.8mb ;-)
not counting additional binaries, etex macros, doc files, etc.
[it is nothing against ConTeXt, I really appreciate Hans' work!
And I use ConTeXt from time to time. I'd only like to find any
consent for all, maily beginners.]
What can happen if the user will tune only needed `basic' scheme,
e.g. removing context (at the moment of installation he/she knows
quite nothing about that)?
Please, consider the simplest LaTeX example without *full* context
(and etex) installed:
\begin{figure}
\hbox to\textwidth{\hss\includegraphics{foo.mps}\hss}
\end{figure}

You'll get:
! Undefined control sequence.
\Ginclude@mps ...y \fi \fi \hbox {\convertMPtoPDF 
because of missing 2 files: supp-mis.tex and supp.pdf.tex.

So the main question (mostly to Hans): are those 2 files still can
belong to *standard* pdftex stuff (as well to ConTeXt)?
If so, can tex-pdftex.tpm contain 2 more lines:
 texmf/tex/context/base/supp-mis.tex
 texmf/tex/context/base/supp-pdf.tex
to make happy LaTeX users? [I'm not LaTeX user ;-)]

Thanks,

Well, for one thing you're right that people might get funny ideas.

For another, strictly speaking we've already changed the banner, and
did so long ago: spot the alteration in 'This is TeX, Version 3.14159
(Web2C 7.3.6)'.  It is not as if the implementation in question is
hard to identify in case of trouble.

A more interesting question to pose Knuth would be what kind of banner
change would satisfy him, under the circumstances:

        This is derived from TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)
        This is extended TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)
        This is almost-compatible-with-TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)
        This is web2c-TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)
        This is TeX++, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)
        This is TeX/extended, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)

I'm in the process of submitting further patches...for example, for
e-TeX the log files would get a TeX banner written to them rather than
an e-TeX banner.

I've finished committing these changes, and as far as I can tell
they're clean.  Note that they did shift some stuff pertaining to
banners around.  Finally, I'd still like something better-looking than
'derived from', but am out of ideas for now, as well as out of time.

./pdfetex --src --shell-escape

Actually the bug is not critical, the missing tfm files are correctly
generated by tex when typesetting the source. However a novice user
may be confused when trying to have a look at the available dvi files.

It seems that the mktextfm script isn't run properly -- on the
TeXLive 6 CD, there isn't a single TFM font for the the LH fonts,
only the sources.

I guess that you need to do a "make distclean" in texk/web2c and then
configure again.

I, personally, never compile in the source tree. My sources are in
  /t/texlive/Build/source
and I usually do
  rm -rf /build/X; mkdir /build/X; cd /build/X
  /t/texlive/Build/source/configure; make

I.e. I can remove safely and completely everything that a previous
configure / make / whatever has created in the build area.

This does not work with all versions of "make", but can use this
"feature" with GNU make.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0206021523001.22593-100000@gilas.bamdad.org>

Ok, I found (or I guess I found) why some people think Omega 1.23 is
broken. That's simply because the thing they are using are only half Omega
1.23. They probably use some old 'odvips' and 'oxdvi', which was not
updated with Omega versions of these. That should also be the reason why 
some others can't reproduce the bugs.

I will be updating TeX Live copies of these with changes in the Omega
repository.

I would love to see exact bug reports to see how much correct I am. Please
send them to me personally.

I thought that xdvi also generates tfm files, but it seems that I'm
mistaken...  This would be a nice feature IMHO.

Sebastian, would you like to add those two metric files to TeXLive?
Or do you see an alternative how CJKbabel.dvi can be looked at with
xdvi?

I guess it's too late, but how about

  This is TeX with extensions, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)

That seems like the most accurate statement -- TeX is still present, but
other things are present too.  Except for the -src-specials madness
which actually is not TeX.

My second favorite is:

        This is web2c-TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)

Which also is at least descriptive of the situation and tells the user
what they're getting (although it's redundant :).

Additional information is great, but I'm sure no one will nag if it writes
either 'This is Omega', 'This claims to be Omega', 'This may or may not be
Omega', 'This tries to be Omega', 'It is none of your business if this is
Omega'! ;)

Whether it does that depends on the value of the MKTEXTFM
environment variable, the default of which is set in texmf.cnf.
Janusz, could you please try:

env MKTEXTFM=1 xdvi texmf/doc/latex/CJK/examples/dvi/CJKbabel.dvi

to see if that fixes it?

Yes, sorry about that.

omega crashes with what seems to be a wild pointer reference while 
building the omega / lambda formats.

Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001)
Codes:      KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE (0x0002) at 0x00000008

It leaves a 0-byte sized omega.fmt lambda.fmt and fmtutil reports 
success (!) at building the format.

Removing omega.fmt and lambda.fmt and running fmtutil --missing results 
in (just the tail)

===========================================

so it seems omega crashes.

Note however, that I am using a texmf tree other than from TeX Live, 
this is the teTeX texmf tree from the end of January. omega should of 
course not crash, but given its reported instability I might be able to 
solve this by updating my texmf tree wrt omega.

 This is SNOT (SNOT is Not Ordinary TeX)

"This program is almost compatible with TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)"

no. all these interdependencies and fancy systems means that

the only reason I didn't do that is because I don't trust
my own install scripts, and I  know the cruder solution
works.

The best news for me in all this is that the pool files have not
changed. This means that if I don't get a new binary for platform X
in time, it will still run, with the old banners. I hope
you all agree that we can live with this?

Many, many, thanks to Olaf for taking over the change file baton
today and bringing it to stability!!

Well, I think that this
  \write18 enabled
message is very useful from the security point of view (independed of
what any license allow). So, even though we won't get this into TL7,
I'd like to see this added.

Information about other extensions (line-error, tcx) would be
useful, too (after TL7).

ah, ok. but I think we can live without that for today...

does anyone have an RS6000 with AIX 4.3.3 to do a compile

How did it go again: "This program is almost, but not quite,
completely unlike TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7)"?

Other options: wTeX (the w from Web2C, of course).  Or more Knuthian
FTeX, where the F is not an "ef", but our representation of the old
greek 'digamma' or "wau" (so again 'w').  Of course you get ungainly
constructs like pdfwTeX or pdfFTeX in that case, but that quickly
becomes unavoidable.

Message-ID: <D7573520-766F-11D6-80D5-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

Ok, here it goes. I have been able to get a omega in place that does not 
crash on bus error when trying to create the omega or lambda format.

When I do a normal install ftom TeX Live, I get an omega that crashes 
(seemingly at the moment) when it starts to dump.

When I then install the omega binary by hand (assume "which" is doing 
the right thing, I checked),

	/usr/bin/install -c -p TeXLive/Build/source/bin/powerpc-apple-
darwin5.4/omega `which omega`
	strip `which omega`

I get an omega that does not crash and produces the fmt.

Now, I am completely baffled. Because what else does a TeX Live install 
do except run /usr/bin/install and a strip? When I look at the result of 
the TeX Live install and the install-by-hand I notice that the latter 
produces an omega file that is 4 bytes shorter. How is this possible?

So, to solve this riddle, I need to know what web2c install does that 
might influence the outcome of an install.

it doesnt do a "strip", for one thing. 

what the TeXlive install does is get a list of files
and do something like

 tar cf - `cat $FILELIST` | (cd $newdir; tar xf - )

ie it tars and then untars the files. so the only thing I can
guess at is a strange behaviour of tar. can you try that by
hand and see if the size changes?

I meant a 'make install' in the source tree, not a install of the TL CD. 
And make install does a strip.

In the meantime, I found the source of my confusion. The stuff in 
Build/source/bin was old and was not remade because I changed the flags 
for configure wrt datadir and prefix again because stuff ended up being 
installed in strange places. Hence, I was comparing a new omega (that 
crashes with a bus error) with an old one (that does not).

Now, the only thing *I* can do is remove the latest Developer tools 
(April) and go back to the December ones, because that was what I used 
before. I upgraded after TL was done (or so I thought... )

Downgrading the tools however is giving me some problems. I'll work as 
fast as I can, but I can't work miracles. And I do have to sleep.

Yes, it works.

As before, I've tested it on the 20020527 image reinstalled from the
scratch.

BTW, I noticed the following warnings:

/tl7/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Could not map source abbreviation v for vnbx12.
/tl7/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Need to update /tl7/texmf/fontname/special.map?

/tl7/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Could not map source abbreviation v for vnr12.
/tl7/texmf/web2c/mktexnam: Need to update /tl7/texmf/fontname/special.map?

Also:

Hmm, I'm afraid someone who knows mktexnam (or the CJK fonts)
better than me will need to dig into that ...

This usually indicates that either the PK file is obsolete, or
(more likely in this case) that the DVI file has been created
with a different version of that font.  The only fix would be to
re-create the DVI file. I understand that Werner has submitted a
new version of these files?

I was ready to submit the binaries for Irix/Sparc Solaris/RedHat
but after reading Gerben's letter, I decided to try omega and lambda
formats. Argh, omega crashes under Solaris and RedHat as well...

I am now in doubt what to do next. The error messages are below, 
hope someone can offer a patch...

I am glad to hear this. Really. Downgrading to previous Developer Tools 
is a nightmare. This message means that I can safely assume that the 
problem is not with the upgraded Developer Tools on Mac OS X.

I guess we must return to omega 1.15 if we want to finish TL7 soon, 
unless somebody finds out within a very short timeframe what is wrong 
with omega 1.23. Given that it also crashes on Solaris and RedHat there 
must be someone in the know who can debug this...

Please, Sebastain, do not freeze TL7 until this problem has been solved.

(1) it is a bad idea to have multiple copies of those files, esp since i 
hate to answer mails regarding out of sync files
(2) some more files that come with context can be used in latex; for 
instance the ppchtex macros (has more latex than context users), these 
depend on a few more context files
(3) when one wants to use texexec (for instance in order to manipulate pdf 
files produced by latex) one needs a full context anyway

actually, in that case context has the advantage that it need one format 
for dvi/pdf/etc, so that lessens ths pain

why not make a fake latex style that fakes supp-pdf, something

no, since then we get conflicts in versions; imagine that the old copies 
are located by kpse before the real ones

as long as the files go to the context/base path it's ok for me

[i always wondered why on linux, when i choose context, i get latex as well

[since then i just copy the whole tex live cd to disk]

Strange. I do not have these problems. Omega is able to dump its
format file. Could that be an optimizer problem ?

I checked with the previous developer tools and the problem (omega 
crashing while creating a format) is the same. In other words, omega 
1.23 as is in TeX Live Build/source as of yesterday does noet work on 
Mac OS X, period.

I would not like to have the previous Mac OS X binaries on the CD, 
because that would mean that dvips is not up to date.

Back to omega 1.15?

In case anyone has a chance to have a closer look at 
Omega 1.23 problem: the binary sets for Sparc Solaris 
and Redhat can be fetched with anonymous ftp from 

  ftp.daimi.au.dk/pub/kaja/binaries-june3.tgz

I agree that, unless the problem is solved, we should consider
reverting to the older version of Omega...

Agreed. If this can not be fixed and Omega only crashes, it
should be removed.

Does not look like it. I recompiled omega without optimazation and the 
crash is still there. My compiler is gcc 2.95.2.

No. I hardly know how gdb works (I hate debuggers and almost never use 
one). Though, if you can tell me what to do step by step, I am willing 
to do it. I assume I must create a non-stripped binary and run that 
under gdb. Probably start gdb, set the directory where the sources are, 
load the binary, set the arguments and run (I know that much, but not 
how to do it and I have precious little time).

If you can give me all those, I will do it.

how about the Omega binary before the src-special changes? is that OK?
we can revert to that, easily. it would mean the source did not
match the binary, but that would not be the end of the world.

now that we know it fails on all platforms, we can do the debugging
elsewhere, so don't worry about it for now, Gerben. lets just hope
we can find a source change and recompile today.

It is not omega 1.23 that is at fault. I installed the binaries from my 
installer that were made with the source tree synced on May 20 or May 22 
in case I forgot to update the stamp. This one works and it is omega 
1.23.

DATETIME=@2002/05/20:13:30:00

(maybe DATETIME=@2002/05/22:23:55:00)

So somehow the diffs between May 20 and now broke omega. Maybe something 
with the new banners (web2c 7.3.7x vs 7.3.7)?

Message-ID: <BF1D20CC-770A-11D6-90FA-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

Omega crashed. But since fmtutil reported a succesful creation of 
omega.fmt and lambda.fmt, nobody noticed, also because almost nobody 
uses omega. But on Mac OS X, there is a little program called 
CrashReporter and when you have the Console.app running in the 
background, any crash is displayed for 20 seconds or so in a separate 
window for each crashing program that pops up. Very smooth, it hides 
itself again after a configurable amount of time.

So, while everything seemed to go smooth and it was hard to notice from 
the output of running texconfig init or fmtutil runs, on my machine on 
every dump run of omega, I got that nasty crash window coming up telling 
me omega had crashed.

Message-ID: <67F40440-771A-11D6-90FA-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

Somewhere over the last few months, the output of tex programs has 
changed wrt to what stream it goes to. It used to be that if I ran a 
fmtutil to create a format, the output of tex (omega, pdftex, whatever) 
went to stdout, while the message of fmtutil  about success and failure 
went to stderr.

Nowadays, when I run a "fmtutil --byfmt omega" for example, I get 
everything on stderr.

Is there a reason for this?

Maybe the cbgreek fonts have changed since the creation of the DVI

fmtutil can now be called as mktexfmt where it is supposed to be called
from tex/mf/mpost etc. to create the format file. For this functionality,
it is important, that only the generated filename is send to stdout and
nothing else.

It fails for me. Not only with 7.05, but also with 7.04, 7.03 and 7.01.

ghostscript 6.53 works for "gsftopk fmvr8x 720". I'll write a report

The reason is (as I see it) a mismatch in font names:
there is fmvr8x.tfm, but no fmvr8x.pfb; this one seems
to have been renamed to marvosym.pfb, don't ask me why ;-)

Not sure. Using gsftopk with kpathsea debug trace, marvosym.pfb is
opened, thanks to the .map files.

The bug has already been reported by Paul Vojta to the Ghostscript
people (there is a list of open probles on Paul's page about gsftopk).

Seems like you have replaced all binaries for i386-linux. Did you take
care of libXaw? I have just sync'ed and I find:

And as an added bonus, you can pronounce is "wow-TeX".  This in
contrast to what would happen if I followed the lead of people who're
using their initials: owTeX just doesn't sound right.

Or, more conservatively, we could use this 'TeX-k' or 'TeXk', bearing
in mind that the web2c bug reporting address is tex-k@tug.org.

I don't believe that. It works with gs6.53. It works if I convert the
pfb file to pfa and change the map file accordingly (with gs7.xx). Mote

Hello,

I tried the TeX Live 7, 2002/06/04 and get:

isnt it bad enough for our football team to do so badly
without TeX Live leaping out from behind bushes at me
to bite my leg constantly?

of course, you won't meet this unless you run off the CD,
as a normal install generates new format files, but still.

right. anyone who burns 5000 CDs with a .iso file dated before 2200 BST
will not get the right result....

I don't know. I like the image of TeX being something

This Saturday I have a presentation before the president of the company

just to see how can you *each* me a glass of beer in Trivandrum! :)))

hmm, I wonder what "eaching" is. whatever did I have in mind?

If we get to Trivandrum. If the subcontinent isn't a nuclear

By the way, the error I'm thinking of isn't the missing files, rather
the argument number mismatch with read_image.

Better one small bite than thousands of big bites after the
burning ;-)

I think the big advantage is that the CD does not need
installation except setting of PATH and VARTEXMF
(at least tried with Linux or Win98, with Win 95 the
the auto-location feature does not work).

And it's 7.05, right? The above only applies to "ghostscript
before 6.53". TL6, anyone?

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.30.0206051519110.3168-100000@sun2.ruf.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

hyperref.cfg of TeX Live contains:

\ProvidesFile{hyperref.cfg}%
  [2001/06/04 v1.0 hyperref configuration of TeXLive]
\@ifundefined{pdfoutput}{\ExecuteOptions{dvips}}{\ExecuteOptions{pdftex}}
\endinput

A good idea to switch the default from "hypertex" to
"dvips" if pdfTeX is not running.

This check for pdfTeX, however, is problematic:
* After \@ifundefined{pdfoutput} \pdfoutput will

Subject: [tex-live] TeX Live 7 available for ordering
Message-ID: <200206061503.g56F3NP05930@tug.org>


TeX Live 7 (2-CD set) is almost ready! CD-1 has a runnable system 
for Linux (Intel platforms), Mac OS X, and Windows 32 (Windows NT, 
95, 98, 2000, XP) systems.  GNU Ghostscript 7.05 and Gnu Emacs for
Windows included, along with many other useful utilities. CD-2 has 
a runnable system for Alpha Linux, Irix, AIX, Solaris, and Alpha OSF.

The TeX Users Group has once again arranged with Sebastian Rahtz,
the editor of the TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as a distributor of TeX Live 7,
the 2002 release of TeX Live. In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian
and many others' efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal
cost to TeX users worldwide.

Great care has been taken to ensure that the TeX Live 7 CD contains
only software without restrictions on usage or redistribution.
Specifically, all of TeX Live is compliant with the "Debian Free Software
Guidelines" (http://www.debian.org/intro/free), to the best of our
knowledge. TeX Live 7 contains full sources for all programs and packages
for those who wish to see how it was put together or experiment with
modifications.

The manufacturing date for TL7 is June, 2002. As always, we will mail
the CD's to you immediately after pressing. We can offer TeX Live 7 to
your user group for US $1.00 per set.  Due to the higher cost of
duplicating two CD's this year, TUG will absorb the shipping cost, up to
an order of 1000 sets. If the price is infeasible for your group, or if
you wish to order more than 1000 sets, please contact us and we'll make
a mutually agreeable arrangement with you on a case-by-case basis.

Please respond to office@tug.org as soon as possible with your desired
quantity, even if that quantity is zero.

Thanks, and, happy TeX'ing!

TeX Users Group

Hi all, hi Sebastian!

As ar as I see TL7 is finally finished. Congratulation. I just
returned from a trip to Barcelona and then a week of holidays
diving in egypt.

What about the src thingy now? Is recompiling irrelevant for now?
Will the binaries be updated somewhere? Anything still left
over to do for me?

Best wishes

Subject: [tex-live] aifont in TL7
Message-ID: <1023404353.16748.33.camel@collibf1.jhuapl.edu>

I just downloaded the 20020604 images from ctan. After installing, I
noticed that the aifont package is included. Aifont is intended to allow
pdftex/dvips to produce "better" pdf/ps, i.e. output that avoids acrobat
reader bugs and can also be imported into drawing programs such as Adobe
Illustrator. It works by using the higher slots for doubly encoded
characters in Type 1 cm/ams fonts. Some platforms (windows/mac/etc.)
don't like to display glyphs in the "control-character" range 0-31.
Acrobat Reader normally avoids this problem. But Illustrator and other
drawing programs, which depend on platform font support, do not. Aifont
is a much better option than using dvips -G, for example, to accomplish
the same thing. (By the way, I hope that the dvips -G option is turned
off by default.)

Unfortunately, the latest version of TeXLive is missing a critical set
of files that are necessary for aifont to work: the virtual fonts that
do the remapping. I suggest either removing aifont altogether, or
putting all the necessary files in place so the package can be used as
intended. Unfortunately, aifont does not fit neatly into the TDS. If the
aifont virtual fonts, cmr10.vf etc., were installed under
texmf/fonts/vf, pdftex, dvips, etc., would always find them and use
them. This is not what most people would want most of the time. I
deliberately placed the ai virtual fonts in the TDS non-compliant
directory texmf/ai/vf. Then I used shell scripts to set appropriate
systems variables to point to the correct places. So the script aipdftex
looks like:
#!/bin/sh
export VFFONTS='$TEXMF/ai/vf:'
export TEXPSHEADERS='$TEXMF/ai/config:'
export TEXINPUTS='$TEXMF/ai/config:'
pdftex ${1+"$@"}

A better way would be to modify texmf.cnf to point to the correct
locations whenever aipdftex, aipdflatex, aidvips, etc., were invoked. I
would be happy to help make any changes to get aifont working right in
the latest TeXLive. But I am afraid I am too late for the 2002 release.

Thanks,
Skip Collins

they are there, in source/fonts/ai; as you say, I could not allow
them the main fonts/vf tree. the scripts are there too, but
are not installed. sorry about that, I tend to install packages
mechanistically, and anything odd goes in source....

its too late to change the CD now, I am afraid

So, as I suggested before, additional binary sets can be
available from the net.

alpha-linux, and sparc-86, stuff we have, but no freebsd or hpux.
does anyone have either of those to compile on? we also need
an updated set for AIX when Vladimir gets back.

is there anyone with access to tug.org who'd like to work

Dear Sebastian,
I do not think that it should be done by yourself, so I've just
sent it to all other involved in TL production. Unfortunatelly I have
no rights for changing web pages...

It seems that the newest convert (from ImageMagick 5.4.4)
no more accepts -transparency as an alias to -transparent color,
so the line in tex4ht.env:
Gconvert -crop 0x0 -density 110x110 -transparency '#FFFFFF' tex4ht.ps %%3
should be changed to:
Gconvert -crop 0x0 -density 110x110 -transparent '#FFFFFF' tex4ht.ps %%3

It works also with older versions of convert (checked on 4.2.0 ;-)
The above can also be added to tl bugs, if someone wish doing that.

Saying "Windows 9X/ME/NT/2K/XP" simply enumerates the Windows systems
that are synonymous with Win32.

Query: why not just say "Win32" as in the past? 

I'll leave it at "Win32" unless someone speaks up.

Note that, in the past, we specify which Web2c version (last one said 7.3.3.1).

I'll leave it at 7.3.3.1 unless someone speaks up.

The artwork files for TL7 have been posted:

As with the ISO images themselves, these files are publicly available,
but they are not for the clueless.

All files are in Adobe Illustrator 8 EPS format, which means that they
are useable as is as well as being editable with an appropriate application.

TL7_disk1.eps - The black plate for Disk 1 (contains all type and only type).

TL7_disk2.eps - The black plate for Disk 2 (contains all type and only type).

TL7_lion.eps - The color plate for both Disks 1 and 2. The Bibby TeX
Live Lion appears as a placed object, anamorphically scaled to fit the CD.

texlive-lion.eps - The TeX Live Lion converted (by Martin Schroeder) to
outlines; used in TL7_lion.eps.

Robin: The only files you need to send to the CD house will be the first
three: TL7_disk1.eps, TL7_disk2.eps, and TL7_lion.eps. The latter is the
color plate common to both CD faces.

No problem for me, just that people keep asking if it is compatible
with XP or whatever version.

Well, changes in the sources called for recompilations. In the
multi-developer environment, where source sometimes changes on 
a daily basis, it is not always transparent which programs 
(at the moment, 235 per binary set) are, or are not, affected 
by the changes, and the safest course to make it all consistent 
is - in my opinion - to recompile *all* programs. 

For (o)xdvi, special care was taken to make an extra compilation 
which included patches provided on this list. This said, I am truly 
sorry that it didn't work.

If TeX Live is to support Red Hat 6+, I think we also need someone 
who has a machine to compile it on. I can't ensure that RH7+ binaries 
will work under RH6+ without having an earthly chance to test it out.

Many thanks! The http://www.tug.org/texlive/index.html and

according to your suggestions, with small modifications 
(for example, unsupported systems are commented out, and the

I think i386/Solaris2.8 is the only combination currently available 
in the Master tree but not included on the CD's. To facilitate this 
and future downloads, I added 'Extra binary sets' section with a link 
to i386/Solaris2.8. Please do not get attached to the value of 
the link as it will probably change.

For a start, how about copying webmaster@tug.org with additions 
and corrections to these web pages. If it works well, fine, if not, 
we'll think of something better. Does it sound OK to everyone?

Am I blind or is there NO link from index.html to bugs.html, this
would hide it quite good ;-)

One more idea for the bugs section: I suggest that we put in 
after the date a tag for arch/os so that it is obious for who 
the bug is relevant:

We would have 
<li><date> | i386/linux: 

or

<li> <date> | all platforms:

I would put a tar.gz or similar there otherwise it is very laborious
to download all the stuff.

Message-ID: <a05111712b927c1c0f398@[158.152.22.22]>

As you know, India has been in the news recently, and some western
governments have recommended that their citizens leave the country. This
has an obvious effect on the TUG2002 conference scheduled for September.
Arguably, Kerala is the safest place in India, being in the Southern tip.
Nevertheless, we cannot go against recommendations of governments.

The situation is changing daily and we are hoping that things will settle
in time for us to meet.

We have therefore decided to wait until the end of June and then make a
decision about the conference. We very much hope we can still get together

This might be difficult, but not impossible, provided someone has

Good idea; current setup for accessing extra binary sets on tug.org
is temporary, to keep people who need them now happy.

Actually, maybe it would be a good thing to have a texlive/updates 
directory on CTAN in the future...

Just for your information:

In GNU Emacs sources (and documentation?) all occurences of `win32'
has been replaced some time ago by `w32' because of the (too) positive
connotations of the word `win'.

Sure, and sorry but imho, it leads to nothing except confusion.

It won't change the way M$ write their  docs and the  way it is called
by the press.  All the FSF gained in  doing this was some bugs or user
annoyances during the transition win32->w32 .

it's good enough for the time being.  i imagine the tex live people

from the days when i was involved[only ever documentation], i recall
there had to be a machine for doing builds available, at all times.
it's simply not enough to pick up someone else's copy.  find a machine
that the team can log in to at will, to do the work, and you stand a
chance :-)

this endeavour)

Message-ID: <000201c2111a$5faadbd0$7f4d18d4@Laptop>

I have been using the basic installation from TeX Live 3 for several years
on my Windows95 system to produce ps files of maths papers.

I tried the same installation on my new WindowsXP computer, but the output
of dvips for most documents is a zero length ps file, using the hard drive
tree, although the output is correct if I run off the CDROM.

Can you suggest anything, please?

why not just use a newer version of TeXLive. I use TL 6 in my WinXP and it
works fine. Then you'll also have newer version of the packages. Note that
the TL 7 is now avaliable

source.tar.bz2  16282880 May 27 06:28 (still seen on some mirrors)
and it *was* wrong. Today is OK:
source.tar.bz2  17601199 Jun 04

no he's not.  "it's wrong", when "it" is a very large file provokes
thoughts of "this guy wants me to guess which file in the tar set is
corrupt".

today, _one_ person, of the many you addressed, thought to check ctan
times vs. tug box times.

and then i noticed that i had made a mistake in mirroring parameters;
i corrected it and ran our mirror again.  i've now pushed the entire
directory to the other ctan nodes, but mirrors will pick the new stuff
up in their own good time.

Great! Robin, many thanks for doing that.
I wrote my notes only to avoid a mess, sigh.

Message-ID: <3D08D2E0.55571D0A@ux1.eiu>

Although I am a TUG member and will eventually get an official TeX Live
7 CD, I am wondering if the image on CTAN has now become the stable,
official release.  I'm a bit impatient and I would like to do a fresh
TeX installation for a new computer.  I can, of course, wait for the
official CD to arrive, but if the downloaded ISO image is the same I can
get started now.   The file I downloaded is texlive7-20020604-cd1.iso.

Thanks.

Subject: [tex-live] TL7: MonTeX problems on Linux
Message-ID: <878z5iie7b.fsf@mimuw.edu.pl>

As usual, I set up TL7 to run directly from CD (image). I use Debian
Woody.

Problem 1:

MonTeX from TexLive7 (image texlive7-20020604-cd1) does not work. When
I tried to view

        texmf/doc/latex/montex/montex.dvi

I got the following log

--------------------------------------------------------

[...]

(/tl7b/texmf/fonts/source/public/manjutex/mbparmb.mf)
>> LR
>> true
! Equation cannot be performed (numeric=boolean).

[...]

! Emergency stop.
<*> ... mag:=1+264/600; nonstopmode; input bicighm

[...]

xdvi.bin: Not all pixel files were found

--------------------------------------------------------

Problem 2:

MonTeX (Implementation Level IIa, 02.03 dated February 1999) on
TeXLive 7 is obsolete, the current release available on CTAN CDs is
Implementation Level IV dated December 2001.

Problem 3:

The obvious solution to the previous problems is to place the recent
version earlier in the search path, so I have unpacked the recent
version as shown in the enclosed ls-R file. Although kpsewhich located
the new files correctly, elatex and pdfelatex ignore them. Here are
the exhibits:

----------------------------------------------------------------
texlive@galicja:~/montex-tl7/doc$ kpsewhich --show-path=tex
.:/home/texlive/texmf/tex/generic//:!!/var/tmp/tl7b/texmf-var/tex/generic//:/tl7b/texmf-local/tex/generic//:!!/tl7b/texmf/tex/generic//:/home/texlive/texmf/tex///:!!/var/tmp/tl7b/texmf-var/tex///:/tl7b/texmf-local/tex///:!!/tl7b/texmf/tex///

[...]

texlive@galicja:~/montex-tl7/doc$ kpsewhich mlstrans.tex

) (/home/texlive/texmf/tex/generic/montex/mtdocmac.tex

This happen independently whether there is the ls-R file in

thats not a problem of TeX Live. Thats a problem for the font 
owner....

oh dear, I am sorry about that.
I am surprised, as I track CTAN uploads quite carefully.
I don't know how montex didn't get noticed. drat.

Begin forwarded message:

Dear TeX users,

Thank you all very much for the cards and letters from all over the world
you sent me for our wedding party at De Beukenhof on June 8. It was a big
-and very nice- surprise when Gerben (Wierda) gave them to me that day. 
We
took all cards and letters on our honeymoon and I enjoyed reading them 
very
much. We had a lovely wedding day.

Some of you asked me if I would let Gerben continue to spend time on his

duties....,
just maybe.

Thank you very much again,

Message-ID: <876607sxzz.fsf@mimuw.edu.pl>

Tex Live 7 is missing the Linux binaries for `devnag' preprocessor
needed by the devanagari package.

Although the package contains quite recent Postscript version of
devanagari fonts (`readme' by Anshuman Pandey
<apandey@u.washington.edu> dated 20 March 2002), the package itself
seems to be version 1.2 of 1991 (with some changes in 1994-1995) while
on CTAN there is version 2.0 dated 23 January 2000.

Best regards

Janusz

Yes, I am afraid it was always going to be like that. Since
I know nothing about indic languages and the software,
I am entirely dependent on someone else to set up indic
components of TeX Live. Unless/until someone packages
up devnag so that it fits in the TeX Live source tree,
we won't get binaries.

does anyone like the idea of regularly compiling something
which says

/tmp/ccD8tQ3j.o(.text+0x1e3f): the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.

by the way?

yes. if I don't have a directory that responds to 
 configure
 make
 make install
 make clean
 make realclean
etc, then I cannot easily deal with it.

it would not take long. but surely better if it could be
packaged up with other similar programs? like all the CJK ones,
for instance.

The devnag preprocessor is up-to-date on CTAN in 
language/devanagari/distrib/ (devnag.c and binary version devnag.exe)

I don't understand this!! I don't get any warning nor error messages 
doing this:

g++ devnag.c -o devnag

(gcc version 2.96 20000731)

All this for a simple ANSI C program? If this is the requirement for inclusion in the TeXlive distribution, I suppose we could put something together.

I suggest to take an existing Makefile.in / configure.in and modify it.
For a start, I suggest the stuff from utils/dialog (in TeX Live).

in theory, yes, but as TeX Live is set up now it doesnt
work like that. it needs a complete overhaul.

Its too late for TL7, but this devnag will be on the CD 
distributed at TUG2002

Is it this kind of package, here attached, that you want? Or do you need 
also a full installation of devnag fonts and other TeX/LaTeX files?

What about upgrading also MonTeX and correcting CJK TeX?

Best regards

Subject: [tex-live] TUG 2002 conference status [Please distribute]
Message-ID: <a05111742b93f8c945f9c@[192.168.1.66]>

I wrote an email to you on the 8th of this month regarding the status of
our conference.

The political tension between India and Pakistan has stabilized
considerably. For example, Indian naval ships have withdrawn from the
vicinity of Pakistani waters, and India has nominated her high commissioner
to Pakistan.

Unfortunately the official advice to travellers from Western governments
still seems to be against travel, but we are confident this will change
soon.

I am writing this mail from Kerala, and I am very happy to confirm that
TUG2002 will go ahead as planned. We have already had several registrations
from Europe, US, Asia and Australia, and we are confident the list will
grow.

Please come along and join this great TUG event in one of the most
interesting countries on earth!

Subject: [tex-live] [tug-support] Installation Errors
Message-ID: <000801c22075$0db9d460$0f11bc93@htrtttt>

I had some serious errors installing TeXLive, it failed to create any fmt files.
The log file is included for reference.  Also, the following errors were shown:

1) The instruction at "0x0024671a" referenced memory at "0x02960000". 
    The memory could not be "written".

2) mktexupd.exe has generated errors and will be closed

3) mktexlsr.exe has generated errors and will be closed

The last two errors occurred repeatedly.

Regards

AM
