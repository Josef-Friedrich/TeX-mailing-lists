Since we just hit #2500, TL8 might well be >#3000. :-)

Lars,

When compiling for a new architecture, I think it's a big plus to have
an access to the current perforce tree. To get it, you'll need to:

- download a P4 for HP-UX - 'p4' is a binary program which you can 
  fetch from http://perforce.com/perforce/downloads/hpux11.html
- point your P4 to the master perforce sources (at dante.de)
- create your own client with p4.

After the last step, you will be able to download all or parts of the
tree (make sure you have plenty of disk space).

There are two excellent introductory pages on how to start:

   Ten Minute Demo  at http://perforce.com/perforce/demo/unix.html
   Ten Minute Pitch at http://perforce.com/pitch/page01.html

If you decide to use perforce and encounter problems, let me know
and I'll try to help (I've been there too :-)

That may mean we have become less careful. Many changes are just fixes to

um, any time. I just need to make an image and put it somewhere.
unless someone else can do it, I cannot do anything for a week

Message-ID: <3DC5E9D3.6BB1344F@ktug.or.kr>

Dear the TeX Live team,

At first I really appreciate your great work, TeXLive.

I'm Jin-Hwan Cho, a member of TUG and a member of KTUG(Korean TeX
Users Group; http://www.ktug.or.kr) too.

In these days there was a discussion in KTUG to make KTUGLive, like
like TeXLive, containing some additional packages for Korean TeX Users.

The best way for this work might be to modify the current TeXLive7.
To do so we need to modify the installer program, TeXSetup.exe.
Could you tell me what the license of TeXSetup is? And, is there no
license problem to modify TeXLive7 and to change the name to KTUGLive,
for example?

Furthermore, it would be nice if you give some comment on making TPM
files easily.

Best, ChoF.

what would you take out? the CD is full. In general,
I would rather roll things needed for KTUG into the main CD
if at all possible.

what about the Unix installer?

What I do is make a tiny tree which contains all of a package
ready in place under texmf/, and then then I run a Perl script which
writes a .tpm catalogue. My script is awful, but you should
be able to write something similar quite easily

Dear TeX-Live-team,

to provide our university with a central customized TeX-System 
for serveral operating systems (win32, solaris, aix and linux 
with only one common texmf-tree) I use the TeX Live CD since 1998.

With TeX Live 7 I encountered the following problem:
The binaries for nearly all operating systems are compiled with 
Web2C 7.3.7x. Only the powerpc-aix4.3.3.0 (and alpha-linux) binaries 
are compiled with Web2C 7.3.7 (without "x") and therefore they need 
a different set of FMT files.

Are there "aix-7.3.7x-binaries" meanwhile?

Best wishes
Wolfgang Kaspar

I was making AIX binaries for TL7, and can remake them if needed.
Shall i use source or source.development for build?

the AIX binaries which are currently in perforce Master tree are based
on Web2C 7.3.7x.

$ ./tex 
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.7x)

Question: Our printer is a Canon IR 3300 Laserprinter, which choice is the
best for this one (in texconfig)?


All of a sudden my newly created TL 7 behaves wierd after having latexed a
file and dvips'ed it I use ps2pdf (GNU gs version 6.51) no errors but when
I preview it on screen acroread complains about some fonts it don't know
and it doesn't display anything at all.

The wierd thing is that if I use pdflatex, there is no problem.

It have worked fine before I started updating the packages and fonts and I
think something might have gone wrong there somewhere.

I installed the update for psnfss and doublestroke, and did a 
updmap --enable Map dstroke.map for installing the doublestroke font, it
has word fine before. There shouldn't be anything done for psnfss.

But some where something goes wrong. I just wanna know it there is anyone
else that have had similar problems, regarding this last bit.

sorry about all this. The only correct images to get are

 http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/Images/texlive7-20020604-cd1.iso.bz2

which is the official release of TL7, and

http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlprod/Images/snapshot-texlive7-20021112-cd1.iso.bz2

where 20021112 is the date of whenever I make a snapshot (as I am now
doing).

this snapshot has a revised texmf tree, including CJK, but the program
sources and binaries  are from June.

My plan is to make a new snapshot next month, and hopefully to have
a new set of sources and binaries. This is if the current round of
web2c/teTeX testing reveals no more problems.

the texmf tree in todays image is about 2 weeks old (ie I have a CTAN
backlog to process)

Are the access rights to the directories correct? I get `Not found' error.

Message-ID: <200211141439.gAEEdB2x141670760@nslocum.cs.bell-labs.com>

I have fixed a bug the setrange command whereby nonzero lower bounds
and upper bounds greater than about 10000 caused the lower bounds to
get messed up.  For example, a command like this can often cause the problem:
  setrange(110,110,"22000","22000");

I have updated the master copy of graph.mp in
    http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/research/metapost.tar.Z
and this should show up automatically in CTAN and various other places
as metapost.tar.gz (or something like that).
Since this is just a change in the macros, it does not really count as a new
version of MetaPost.

I do *not* recommend that casual users go to these master distributions.
They are hard to install and serve mainly as a place for maintainers of
TeX/LaTeX/METAFONT/MetaPost distrubtions to get their raw material.
If you want to try it right away, just give the following macro
redefinition after   input graph

I think there is some confusion as to what is (or should be) available
and where. Let me recapitulate: since last May, and after discussing
it thouroghly with Sebastian and Karl, the binaries, CD images and source 
from TeXLive repository have been available for ftp from tug.org at:

   ftp.tug.org:/texlive/Bin
   ftp.tug.org:/texlive/Images
   ftp.tug.org:/texlive/Source

These are loopback mounts from tlprod/bin, tlprod/Images and tlprod/source, 
meaning that any changes there will immediately be seen by ftp.

I checked these directories today and noticed that the Bin and Source
were empty, so two of the mounts apparently failed. They are now recovered.

The issue of accessing tlprod via http has come up on more than one
occasion. Why not use ftp? And if you need an access to the Master tree, 
it's already available at the master server at dante.de via Perforce
(or maybe even http).

Afaik, the texlive/Source directory at dante.de is actually a mirrored 
copy of ftp.tug.org:/texlive/Source.

Which info and link are missing?

This symlink doesn't hurt, but refering just to ftp.tug.org:/texlive/Images
would help people to remember where the stuff is...

In other words, CJK TeX is still buggy :-(.

Please upgrade CJK TeX from CTAN as soon as possible.

Because FTP has is not network friendly. It puts unnecessary network load
on the network, the server, and the client. This is specially important
for very large files. (The possiblity of a security breach of the server
because of a bad implementation is also higher, compared to solid http
servers like Apache.)

sorry, can you be more explicit, please? I genuinely do
not understand much about this CJK stuff, and I need detailed
instructions...

What about applying the patches sent to you by Werner on 19 August and
8 October? For your convenience I enclose below Werner's letters.

I cannot let this misinformation pass unchallenged.

(1) ftp in fact puts less load on the network for smaller transfers,
    since, unlike http, it is not stateless, and requires fewer round
    trips for communication.

    For transfers of large amounts of data, both are comparable, since
    essentially the same bytes are sent in one direction; this can be
    readily confirmed by timing the grabbing of large files with
    ncftpget and wget.

(2) The security-breach point is a red herring.  Security problems
    have been found in both Web and FTP daemons, from all vendors.
    For example, a search at http://www.cert.org/ selecting categories
    of

	* Advisories
	* Incident Notes
	* Security Improvement Modules
	* Vulnerability Notes

    found 230 reports for Apache, and 80 for wu-ftpd (one of the more
    widely-used FTP daemons, and the one that we have run for more
    than a decade on ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu ==
    ftp://ctan.math.utah.edu).

    Statistics in a report that I prepared a few days ago showed that
    we transfer about ten times as many files by http than by ftp, but
    we transfer ten times the amount of data by ftp than by http.  By
    ftp, we transfer an average of 56GB/day (ranging from 14GB/day to
    185GB/day), with some weeks having over a terabyte of traffic.

(3) Many ftp sites, including ours, support batch archive retrievals
    of directory trees, something that is not usually possible with
    http: it has to rely on hypertext links to find files, since the
    protocol does not provide a directory-listing service if an index
    file is present. Thus a recursive wget invocation is NOT
    equivalent to an ftp archive get.

    By contrast, with ftp, I can do this:

	% ncftp ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu
	ncftp> cd /pub
	ncftp> get bibnet.tar.gz

    to retrieve the BibNet Project bibliography archive; the .tar.gz
    file is created on-the-fly, and I could have instead asked for
    .jar, .tar, .tar.Z, .tar.bz2, .trz, .tgz, .zip, or .zoo formats.

(4) With ftp, clients can do a directory listing and get time stamps
    and file sizes.  This is not usually possible with Web
    connections, because that information is hidden from the user.
    Good ftp clients preserve the time stamps, which is critically
    important for filesystem mirroring.

(5) Many ftp servers support the "quote site index" command to locate
    files.  Here is an example:

	% ncftp ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/
	ncftp / > quote site index bibclean
	index bibclean
	NOTE. This index shows at most 20 lines. for a full list of files,
	retrieve /pub/archive/FILES.byname
	1997/02/27 |      18375 | biblio/bibtex/utils/bibclean/bibclean-2.11.3.tar-lst
	1997/02/27 |    1464494 | biblio/bibtex/utils/bibclean/bibclean-2.11.3.tar.gz
	 (end of 'index bibclean')

    The same sort of thing works at ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/,  but
    alas, not at ftp://ftp.tug.org/.  [Can someone get this working?
    I can provide guidance if needed.]

I stand corrected. It's good that I don't need to apologize, since I guess
my bad misunderstanding has helped some people (myself included) acquire
some great knowledge. Instead, I should thank. Thank you very much Nelson!

Message-ID: <wunbudaq.fsf@supelec.fr>

I will submit a bunch of patches I'm using to compile the texlive
tree. I have split it in 4 parts :

1.1 - kpathsea changes related to path handling,
1.2 - kpathsea changes related to hash tables,
2   - web2c changes,
3   - everything else

I will commit part 3 in source.development, and send you directly part
1.1,  1.2 and part 2 to  decide what can be  integrated  into the main
source tree.

This happens not during the configure stage but during the make world  
stage, strangely enough. The configure stage finishes without errors.

Mac OS X comes with autoconf 2.52. I do not want to change this (bad  
experiences with changing the default system). Which files do I have to  
touch to make this work?

This might be answered elsewhere but I haven't found it.

On our UNIX system we have xdvik version 22.40k

But we're having some problems concerning the colors. If the xterm
wherefrom xdvi was started has a blue background, the so will the xdvi.

How and where do I do a system wiede configuration, so say, the xdvi gets
 white backround(s) and black text.

I can control some of them with the commandline options, but how do I
change it system wide all at once?

The manpage for X(7x) has quite some useful information on
application resources etc.

That's not the default behaviour in X - maybe your window manager
(AKA `desktop environment') is doing something strange here.

To the application defaults file XDvi (usually in $TEXMF/xdvi/),
add the following lines:

XDvi*background: white
XDvi*foreground: black

I guess you should also put a notice somewhere that people should set 
their p4 client to use 'modtime'. The default is 'nomodtime'.

Fabrice, you seem to have changed the line endings in a lot of files
in mminstance package to DOSish line endings (CR LF).

I think it's not good. Please correct that.

No it  is not good,  but I wonder how can  I do that  using Perforce ?
The trick is that I use patch.exe to apply patches, and patch.exe will
produce text files. On the other hand, if I turn on the crlf option of
perforce as I did in the past,  it will translate files that shouldn't
be  touch   (the ones  in  /Master).   So I  don't  know   how  to  do
it... Moreover editing source files with XEmacs makes this line ending
problem transparent, so difficult to notice. Any idea ?

you can keep all your sources with UNIX line endings, then Emacs will
not change the line endings. Also, patch.exe for win32 seems to have a
command line option to use "binary mode". That way, even if you use
the "preserve line endings" option in perforce, all your source files
will be commited with UNIX line endings.

Or, if your patch.exe doesn't support "binary mode", you can
post-process your files with perl -p -i.bak -e 's,\r\n,\n,' files
before submitting them to perforce...

Best,
v.

I'll check for this but first time  I hear about  that. The problem is
not easy, because patch is not alone. Diff  files are usually produced
by redirection  on the command line, which  means text mode diff files
(unless a patched  diff !). Text mode  diff files with binary files to
be patched usually does not mix happily.

                                                  ^^^^^^^^^
does not seem to work that way. But a perl script could do it yes.

uh... maybe you can pre-process diff files then before running patch
to get rid of CR... such a messy windows world :-)

it works fine on unix, but on windows you might need to add
binmode STDIN; or something like that...

I wanted to fix this myself by changing the type of  
makefullnamestring() to match the declaration (strnumber, which is a  
unsigned short and not an int), but when I try to tell p4 I want to  
edit the file I get:

[dumbledore:TeX/texk/web2c] root# p4 edit etexextra.c
etexextra.c - file(s) not on client.

Which is weird, as the file is obviously there.

So, someone else has to do that.

My log file (from Build process) shows that 'etexextra.c' 
is a generated file:

   sed s/TEX-OR-MF-OR-MP/etex/ ./lib/texmfmp.c >etexextra.c

So, you would have to edit TeX/texk/web2c/lib/texmfmp.c.

Message-ID: <002001c29099$7b85d680$9f3be186@BROOKLYN>

I've installed Tex Live 7 from the CD onto a PC running Windows 2000. I
think I have found a bug in the installation procedure that results in a
faulty search path for fonts with pdflatex.

If I exercise the option in the installation procedure to install to my
choice of directory then the installation appears to succeed but
pdflatex fails to find the installed Type-1 fonts and uses bitmap fonts
instead. This generates warnings in the pdflatex log and produces a PDF
file that neither Acrobat 5 nor GhostView can display (they both
complain about missing fonts). However, the Type-1 fonts are
(apparently) installed; kpsewhich can find them.

If I install into the default directory, everything works fine.

This looks like a bug to me (but if you think that it might be caused by
something strange in my Windows configuration, please let me know your
suggestions).

That could be something related to the previous problem, with some file

Hi,

i'm curious why was the freetype2 library recently included into
source.development tree? afaik, freetype2 is not used by any
TeX-related apps: e.g. ttf2pk uses freetype1, and xpdf library does
not need freetype2 either - it's only used for rendering truetype
fonts, which is not used by pdftex.

Best,
v.

_getjobname should come from _mfextra.o.  Remove mf, mfextra.o, and
mfextra.c, then run make again.

It should look like this in texmfmp.c:

strnumber
makefullnamestring()
{
  return maketexstring(fullnameoffile);
}

If it doesn't your sources are either old, or worse, a mixture of new
and old.

Again, that did the trick. But weird, because why didn't make clean 
remove it on my system? Might it be because I have been switching 
between a perforce dump of 'now' versus 'a few days back'?

The same is true for pdftexextra.c and pdfetexextra.c.

And as an explanation, since the above files are *generated*, their 
timestamp is almost always newer than the source from which it is 
drawn. So, to be correct, make clean *should* remove these generated 
files.

It looks like make clean just doesn't remove *extra.c, while distclean
does.  The difference is that with the introduction of cweb there are
now .c files that shouldn't be removed by a make clean, so rm -f *.c
cannot be used anymore.

Yes, maybe.

I would say that make distclean should do a make clean + removal of 
anything that has been created by the configure stage. Make clean 
should remove enough to force a complete rebuild from basic sources 
without reconfiguring. But maybe others would think otherwise.

Two ways:

	p4 sync somedate
	reconfigure
	make clean
	make install
	p4 sync someotherdate
	reconfigure
	make clean
	make install

and

	p4 sync somedate
	make distclean
	reconfigure
	make install
	p4 sync someotherdate
	make distclean (*)
	reconfigure
	make install

The first has the advantage that it is certain there is a Makefile and 
also that it is the *current* Makefile that decides what needs to be 
removed, not the Makefile of the previous unrelated configure (*).

I can live with the second one, but my personal preference would be 
that make distclean would be make clean + rmeove configure stuff (a 
clear separation of configuration and compilation is preferred, IMO, 
'make extras' is for instance 'broken' in that respect as it is a make 
that entails configuration)

I'd do
 p4 sync somedate
 configure
 make XXX
 rm -rf *
 p4 sync -f someotherdate
 configure
 make XXX

in my simple-minded way....

One test that should definitely be done for any software distribution,
including the TeXLive one, is that the final "make distclean" does
indeed remove everything that was created by make.

Just do

	touch /tmp/TIMESTAMP
	./configure && make all check
	make distclean
	find . -newer /tmp/TIMESTAMP

If the find command reports even one file, then the Makefiles need to
be fixed so that "make distclean" removes them.

This is easier and faster than doing a recursive diff between the tree
after a "make distclean" and another freshly-unpacked tree: in either
case, the tree after "make distclean" should be indistinguishable from
a just-unpacked one.

The "dircmp -s" command is also useful: it will catch cases where
"make distclean" incorrectly removed files that came with the original
distribution.

For the case of generated .c and .h files, consider using the
intermediate GNU-standard target `mostlyclean': the dependency list
should look like this:

	clean:
		-$(RM) ...

	mostlyclean:	clean
		-$(RM) ...

	distclean:	mostlyclean
		-$(RM) ...

	maintainer-clean: distclean
		@echo "This command is intended for maintainers to use;"
		@echo "it deletes files that may require special tools to rebuild."
		-$(RM) ...

Hello people,

I have been trying to get TeX4ht to work on my system, but so far 
without success. I must have installed something badly. Here is a test 
file:

============================ gwtest.tex =============================
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[]{tex4ht}
\begin{document}
Text text and a piece of $A^{b^y}$

And more text with a
\[
G^2 = 2 \sum_{ij\ldots k} x_{ij\ldots k} \ln \left(\frac{x_{ij\ldots 
k}}{e_{ij\ldots k}}\right)
\label{eq:g^2}
\]

\end{document}
============================ gwtest.tex =============================

When I run this through htlatex, I get the first paragraph with 
formula, but not the second. The second formula should be transformed 
into a picture, but the picture is not generated and thus not found. If 
I run dvips on the dvi file, I get these telltale signs of which 
especially

/usr/local/TeX.development/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current/dvips: 
Could not find figure file t4ht++gwtest0x.gif; continuing

is probably a sign of the trouble I am in. Can someone point me in th 
edirection to get this working?

Well, one thing I did discover is that I did not have a valid 
tex4ht.env in my system. I installed tex4ht my copying the stuff from 
TL's Master tree to my personal TeX tree. But TL's Master tree contains 
a zero-sized tex4ht.env.

I have now received a working tex4ht.env for Mac OS X from Bruno Voisin.

I am for the third way. I build outside the source dir and just do

  p4 sync somedate # texlive -> /t/texlive
  mkdir /build/XY
  cd /build/XY
  /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/configure

  rm -rf /build/XY # optional

  mkdir /build/XYZ
  cd /build/XYZ
  /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/configure

  make install

That "build outside the source dir" might only work with GNU make.
And the "extra" stuff will not yet work completely, too (that's why my
example only configures the TeX directory, not the "real" top-level of
TeX Live).

I have another point with the build process of TL. A 'make extras' 
entails a configure stage (which has played havoc with me in the past) 
and that is also mixing two levels of 'building'. I would prefer

	configure --with-extras

or

	configure --without-extras

and a simple make.

Right now the web2c parts are somewhat broken in this regard.

given that he uses

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.8)

and given that I have seen discussions about this issue (but I haven't 
followed the discussions), has this to do with a more recent web2c 
version?
