Sebastian and Kaja,

here are a few comments on texlive-20000413.iso:

First of all, it installed smoothly and without any problems on my new 
Linux box. I installed it as root and now run it as normal user.

o a minor point: The texmf-var/fonts area is write-protected, such that xdvi
cannot write its pk files there

o the same is true for the file texmf-var/ls-R, such that the scripts cannot
update this file

o a minor remark on the directory layout: 
  What is the rationale to have both texmf/doc/fonts and texmf/source/fonts
  on the CD? The latter directory does not hold the sources (they are in
  texmf/fonts/source instead) but additional documentation, too. I suggest
  to unify texmf/doc/fonts and texmf/source/fonts in texmf/doc/fonts.
  If you do not want to unify the directories, I think, that at least
  the stuff in texmf/source/fonts/fc and texmf/source/fonts/ec should be moved
  to texmf/doc/fonts/fc and texmf/doc/fonts/ec respectively.

hmm, I had better check the install file

conceptually, source/fonts has the equivalent of .dtx files

i'll look at it, thanks for pointing it out

Hi,

I just wanted to tell you, that the TeX Live Installation doesn't work
with Windows 95. It says that it wants to install about 250 MB, but it
doesn't even install 20 MB when I try to install the Custom-Version. It
is the same for the recommended Version. There must be something wrong
with the Wizard.

Could you tell me how to fix that?

Greetings, Philipp.

The setup has been tested several times against w95. Could you send me
the log file ? It should be found either in \windows\temp or in
\tex\config . Are you getting some error ?

Message-ID: <01JP8FUO2KME0000P4@ALPHA.NTP.SPRINGER.DE>

Sebastian and Kaja,

this is a rather serious request:

Please keep the macro package text1 out of the distribution.

It is a rarely used and rather dead macro package. It comes with
additional fonts named "cm*" (eg. cmr11) which are buggy (The design
size claimed by the METAFONT sources is inconsistent with the x_height
of the fonts, instead of "14pt" it should be "14.4pt" etc.). The
text1 cm fonts have caused much of confusion in the past and they will
continue to do so.

Note, that the Sauter package can generate fonts with the same names,
but different metrics than the text1 package does.

Yours,

J"org Knappen

The fonts do occasionally cause confusion (also at our site!), but they 
are not buggy. Last year, I asked Barbara Beeton about the design size 
adopted for text1 fonts and she answered that

 | the design sizes of the text1
 | fonts are intentional.  knuth *recommended*, but didn't *require*
 | that the magstep progression be used.  the tex group at washington
 | state university developed the text1 collection, using "real" rather

 > Note, that the Sauter package can generate fonts with the same names,

True, yet the text1 font names appear perfectly legal (according to the 
documentation, the author asked Knuth for permission to use cm* names). 

So, my suggestion is to make a comment on the text1 design sizes somewhere
where it would be easily seen (Catalogue?) and thus avoid the confusion.

Kaja

  In the end of the instalation, the instalation script should 
add into variable PATH, the path for new binaries (or at least to write, how to do it
or that it it suitable to do)

 When the instalation finished, the directory /usr/TeX/texmf-var/fonts
has the following setting  drwxr-xr-t. 
With this setting only root can do something and xdvi is sad:-) 																																																																																																																																																								
The correction is trivial. If it is design (maybe from the secutiry), I

Sebastian and Kaja,

I just stumbled over the fact, that with a "recommended" installation
on the i386-linux architecture
several texware and mfware programms are missing from texlive5, namely:

gftodvi gftopk gftype mft pktogf pktype pltotf pooltype tangle tftopl 
vftovp vptovf weave

I think, this list is complete. My strong feeling is, that all these programmes
are at least 'recommended', if not basic.

mft and gftopk are essential because mf font generation won't work
without them.

vptovf is essential for installing PS fonts.

The others are probably recommended.

Note, it is "mft", not "mf". mft is a pretty-printer for mf source code, and
a rather rare animal. Boguslaw is one of the few active users of mft, he 
documents his fonts using it. However, mft belongs to the Knuthian TeX 
distribution which gives it a prominent place and makes it recommended IMHO.

gftopk is indeed installed (oops, wrong alarm for this one and only this one)

My judgement was that none of these programs (except gftopk, which is
level 1) are ever used by `normal' users. I do not count "installing
fonts as" `normal'.  

By the way, I do not use "written by Knuth" as a criterion for
inclusion in "recommended".

The install script says

"I will now create the filename database,
add $bindir to your PATH, and run
   texconfig init
to initialize your system and create 
format files. The log of this will be placed in
$TEXDIR/texconfig.log

You should make sure that $bindir
is added to your PATH for future sessions."

I don't really see what else I can do. I certainly dont propose to try 
and edit your .login/.profile/.bashrc/.cshrc/.kshrc file....

Indeed it isn't. But texware and mfware are part of the TeX system. A TeX
system without them (at least as options) is just incomplete.

The weekest case is mft which is nowhere documented except in its own source
code and noone except Knuth and Boguslaw uses it. Several TeX implementations
lived well without it.

My personal ratings are:

1 Basic: tftopl/pltotf (it is referenced in one of TeX's error messages and can 
       help fix corrupted tfm files)
       vptovf/vftovp (one popular way to make virtual fonts)
       gftodvi and gftype (proofing tools for METAFONT)

2 Recommended: weave, tangle, pooltype,
       pktype and pktogf

3 Optional
       mft and mft support files (Note: The CD still contains the mft 
       support files like plain.mft, cm.mft and e.mft. Boguslaw's polish
       fonts hide another mft 'style file')

we must read different news groups! I have never met a metafont user

Boguslaw

Have more than half a dozen people ever run gftodvi in the last 10 years?

Sure, not many people know about the existence of the texware/mfware
programs, but those that do, would probably really miss them.  And they
are essential for system debugging.

How much space do you really save by omitting these basic programs?

Subject: pdflatex from texlive5b fails
Message-ID: <200005170138.LAA01194@hera.mpce.mq.edu.au>


After downloading the TeXLive5b disk image,
2 problems emerged from running the installation
(solaris 2.7) :

1.

  A.  creating formats for CyrTeX failed due to
      missing fonts or metrics;

  B.  the installation stopped completely due to this error,
      and the formats already built were not copied/renamed
      to the intended final destination.

  C.  it was very difficult to find the file that controlled
      which formats to build; documentation on this point
      was poor --- found it eventually using  grep .

  D.  after commenting out the cyrtex line, all other formats
      were built and moved/renamed successfully.


pdfTeX works fine now, but ...


2.  pdflatex  fails on any document with the following message:

 Error: pdftex: zlib: deflateInit() failed

e.g.

This document has nothing on page 1, and just the page-number on page 2.

(It has nothing to do with concrete.sty --- that was just a test to
see if the cm-fonts were somehow causing the error.)


Is there something about this TeXLive5b that is unsuitable for
normal English/American use ? 
Perhaps a local  libz.a  is bad ?

Is the only solution to recompile pdfTeX from sources ?
Why does it fail as pdflatex but not as pdftex ?


Can anyone help ?

this is awful. I am gutted, honestly. I cannot think how I failed to test for
it. I have edited fmtutil.cnf so that "cyrtex" is not a candidate for
building

this is really scary.....

Kaja, do the Solaris binaries work for you??

not knowingly

yes. and then compare the binaries with the Solaris ones that Kaja
generated

 > Why does it fail as pdflatex but not as pdftex ?

probably because there is a .cfg file which turns on PDF compression,
whereas it is off by default

Yes, a test file (similar to Ross's) works just fine - see the output below.

Ross, perhaps it's has something to do with your version of zlib?
It's 'unbundled'. I used zlib v. 1.1.3.

Um, I got confused, it's been a tough day.

There were no changes: binaries are compiled with the tl zlib. I checked 
the relevant lines in the log file and can't see any anomalies:

Any ideas where else to look?

There is a command   (can't remember the  name)  to check with   which
dynamic libraries (if any) your program is linked.

Ensure that you are using the same \pdfcompresslevel by specifying it
directly into the test file.

So the explanation must be that the zlib compiled into Kaja's binaries
does not run properly on Ross' computer. Can you expound on your
configuration, Ross? what version of the OS do you have?

zlib is compiled into binaries... The only dynamic libraries are

 ldd /users/kaja/texlive/bin/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/pdftex
        libm.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libm.so.1
        libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1

Could someone (who is not Ross or Kaja) try it out under solaris 2.7 too?

Well, it's not *my* computer; it's the main Unix installation
at CalTech, to which I am just a visitor.
I've forwarded this request to Eric Schneider,
who is in charge of doing the installation.
He is attempting to rebuild the binaries, and may reply.

Here is a little more information.

If I set the line in  pdftex.cfg to read:
  compress_level 0
then pdflatex works OK, as expected.


For what it's worth, my LaTeX source is as follows:

\documentclass{article}
%\usepackage{concrete}
\begin{document}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\vglue.2bp
\vfill 
\eject
\vglue.2bp
\thispagestyle{empty}
\vfill 
\end{document}

The only *ink* is due to the page-numbers.
pdfTeX fails on the first page with a printed number.
 


However, there is a different problem when uncommenting the line:
 \usepackage{concrete}

Now, even with 0 compression, it gives a different error:

OK, ccr fonts are only available in bitmaps.
Indeed this error occurred on a completely fresh installation
where no ccr bitmaps had yet been generated.

So the document can never be fully made by pdfTeX, 
but surely it should not produce a fatal error like this.

After processing first with latex + dvips to generate bitmaps,
the document worked fine (still only with  compresslevel=0 ).


All the best,

No, the letter has not been sent.  I did send an email inquiry last week
(same one I sent to you) to:

Dante - says they are thinking about production done in Europe due to
dollar exchange rate
(they ordered 2000 CD's last year)
Apostolos Syropoulos - says he will order 50
Kaja - not going to order xtra copies this year
Kaveh Bazargan - no response
GUTenberg - no response
Richard Kinch - no response
Jonathan Fine - no response
Peter Abbott - no response
Ondrej Vacha - no response
M. Gelderman - by snail mail
Mikkel Damsgaard - by snail mail

I realize I am missing many LUG's but as I wrote, initially I thought I'd
query by invoices in last years TL4 file.  6500 may be too high..... (that
number was ordered last year and we have about 500 left, however, we have
200+ new members w/ 4-6 new members per week, so barring other significant
changes, I thought that number was a pretty good one...but with Dante
possibly not ordering from TUG, and perhaps others, I dunno)

	>They are getting a bit importunate....

I know what you mean.  I receive many inquiries daily asking "Where's the CD"?

The next step is to send a letter to the LUG's (a month ago?)
This is what I have (per you, Karl w/ some editing).
Please let me know when these are ready to send...if something has changed
(other than costs w/ shipping, which I have included) I need help including
that info.
Thanks.

Btw do you want to refer to the CD as TeX Live 5 or TeX Live 5c?

Subject: TeX Live 5 available for ordering

TeX Live 5 is almost ready!  It has a runnable system for major Unix
variants (SGI, Sun, IBM, Compaq, HP), Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows 32
(Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000) systems.  It also has an archive of emTeX
(for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), but no Macintosh version (due to
licensing restrictions). Gnu Ghostscript 5.50 and Gnu Emacs are
included, along with many other useful utilities.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 5, the 2000
release of TeX Live.  In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's
heroic efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to
TeX users worldwide.

First, about copying conditions.  TUG's intention in the terms for
further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM is to give the donors of
the software contained therein the assurance that the licensing
requirements they have made are properly observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different packages on
the CD, TUG strongly recommends that you simply pass the CD on to your
members as a benefit of membership and allow TUG to handle requests for
further redistribution of the CD.  TUG will be distributing TeX Live to
its own members as a benefit of membership in TUG.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
publications, such as books or journals, those things be freely
copyable.  A model for this is TUGboat; please see the sample notice
below.  This is relevant if you plan on distributing the CD with your
newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in including the CD with a non-redistributable
offering of any kind should contact TUG directly.  This is not allowed
by default!  Likewise, charging anything more than a nominal fee (to
recover costs) is also not allowed by default -- and it is far better to
charge nothing at all for the CD itself, but to provide it as a free
benefit of membership, as TUG does.  (These conditions, like the others,
are set by some of the software on the CD, not by TUG.)

There will be a file on the CD that explains the copying conditions
further, as well as an announcement in TUGboat, on tug's web site, etc.
If you have concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your members,
please contact us right away at tex-live@tug.org.

Second, production details: expected manufacturing date of TL5 is June/July
2000.  
We expect to mail the CD to you shortly thereafter.

We expect to be able to offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of
US $1.00 per copy, plus the cost of shipping.  This is slightly more than
cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go towards subsidizing the
cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with weaker
economies; TUG itself will not benefit.  If this cost presents a burden
for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.  

We cannot determine exact shipping costs until we know the quantity each
group or individual orders.  Our research indicates that DHL is very
competitive
and specializes in international shipping.  On request, the office will
provide
you with the appropriate bill number so you can track the shipment on the 
appropriate website.

Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero.  Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year.  Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in reserve.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,
tex-live@tug.org

 TUG can offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of US$0.58 per copy,
 and will absorb the shipping cost.  If this price is infeasible for your
 group, please contact us to work out an arrangement.

Yes, as I mentioned before, (happily) something major has changed -- the
distribution conditions.  All the software can now be freely
redistributed without restrictions, so the weird tap-dancing about
`condition of membership' can be removed.

Can anyone change the text appropriately?

    Btw do you want to refer to the CD as TeX Live 5 or TeX Live 5c?

`5c' might avoid some confusion?  It will also cause some, though.

Sebastian,

if no one else has already noted this one (can one view reported and 'known'
bugs somewhere?):

There is an error in the configuration file concerning language.dat:

For german hyphenation, dehyphn.tex and dehypht.tex exist, 
but language.dat calls for
                        dehyphen.tex 

which does not exist. Note that there is a difference between the 
two hyphenation files: The "n" version is for the new, reformed spelling
(which also reformed the hyphenation rules) of german, while the "t" version
goes with the traditional spelling.

This is an appeal for help with the TeX Live LUG email solicitation.
Most parts of that email can be taken over from last year, but because
TL5's copying conditions are so different from TL4, the "copying
conditions" portion needs to be rewritten.

The draft letter as it applied to TL4:

I suggest we change this to read:

<quote>
TeX Live 5 is copyable under the terms of the Debian Free license. In
this, it differs from TeX Live 4, which had several pieces of software
that were distributed under a more restrictive license.

As in years past, TUG will distribute TeX Live as a benefit of
membership; it is expected that LUGs will do likewise. However, it is
not in violation of the license for someone to reproduce the CD-ROM, or
even sell copies.

There is a file on the CD-ROM that explains the copying conditions further.
</quote>

1. How does this language suit the actual terms of the TeX Live 5 CD-ROM?

2. I need a way of saying where that file will be on the CD-ROM. On TeX
Live 4, it was something like /LICENSE.TL4  What is it now?

3. It would be nice to have a URL for the Debian license, since it is
referred to.

Help?

How about the following changes to Art's text:

  Great care has been taken to ensure that the TeX Live 5 CD contains
  only software without restrictions on usage or redistribution.
  Specifically we have followed the "Debian Free Software Guidelines"
  (aka "Open Source").  Thus TeX Live 5 may, unlike TeX Live 4, be
  freely copied and distributed, and the full sources are available for
  all parts of the system for those who wish to see how it was put
  together or experiment with modifications.

The above paragraph fits the actual terms better.

There is no "Debian License" only the "Debian Free Software
Guidelines".  Good links include the pedagocical

this would imply that it was *not* true for TL4. in fact, the contents
are almost identical. certainly no new material, like sources, have
been added.

Indeed.  So how about the simple

  contain any files that prevent it from being freely copied and
  distributed.

In addition I would really like if we could add somewhere that

because that is an important point of the DFSG.

But I cannot think of a single thing where the source is on CTAN but not on
the CD. *everthing* has a source, or I am a chinaman.

I've received several messages that Linux binaries from TL5b cannot work
on many installations, even e.g. on SuSE with glibc 2.1 (??).
As I know, compiling with glibc2.0 should work also with glibc2.1.
Am I wrong?
Sebastian, which version of lib was used? What to do?
Many users are happy with their Linux installations, so using the newest
libraries is perhaps not fine idea.

The binaries for teTeX show the following:

$ ldd pdftex
        /lib/libNoVersion.so.1 => /lib/libNoVersion.so.1 (0x40015000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x40021000)

        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)

For each system in use (libc5 / libc6 type), I always use the oldest
system for building that I can get.

Builing on new systems and running on old ones sometimes fails. The
reverse (building on old systems and running on new systems) usually
works.

      Specifically we have followed the "Debian Free Software Guidelines"
      (aka "Open Source").  

I like the final proposed wording from Sebastian & Kris, with one small
proviso: I don't think we need to say `(aka "Open Source")', and I
suggest we leave it out.  Open Source and DFSG are not the same thing.

Right.

$ ldd pdftex
never says which glibc: 2.0 or 2.1 was in use when building binaries
(both load libc.so.6, etc.).
The problems i've heard was mostly with Debian and SuSE and with all
binaries, not only pdftex.
Perhaps for TL5c it would be wise using glibc2.0 which should work
with 2.1?

Right. And, try to use the system with the oldest glibc2.0 that you

Binaries were build with glibc-2.1. We have a single linux box
with glibc-2.0, so in principle they could be redone.

Subject: TeX Live 5c available for ordering

TeX Live 5c is almost ready! It has a runnable system for major Unix
variants (SGI, Sun, IBM, Compaq, HP), Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows 32
(Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000) systems. It also has an archive of emTeX
(for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), but no Macintosh version (due to
licensing restrictions). Gnu Ghostscript 5.50 and Gnu Emacs are
included, along with many other useful utilities.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 5c, the 2000
release of TeX Live. In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's
heroic efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to
TeX users worldwide.

****************************** IS THIS OKAY??

Great care has been taken to ensure that the TeX Live 5c CD contains only
software without restrictions on usage or redistribution.  Specifically we have
followed the "Debian Free Software Guidelines" 
(http://www.debian.org/intro/free),
and have included license information on the CD-ROM in a file labeled 
LICENSE/TL5.
TeX Live 5c contains full sources for all programs and packages for those who
wish to see how it was put together or experiment with modifications.

*****************************

The manufacturing date of TL5c will be June/July 2000.  We expect to mail
the CD to you shortly thereafter.  We expect to be able to offer TeX Live
to your user group at a cost of US $1.00 per copy, plus the cost of shipping.
This is slightly more than cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go 
towards
subsidizing the cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with 
weaker
economies; TUG itself will not benefit. If this cost presents a burden
for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.

We cannot determine exact shipping costs until we know the quantity each
group or individual orders. Our research indicates that DHL is very
competitive and specializes in international shipping. On request, the 
office will
provide you with the appropriate bill number so you can track the shipment 
on the
appropriate website.

Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero. Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year. Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in reserve.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,
tex-live@tug.org

RIGHT?

TUG can offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of US$0.58 per copy,
and will absorb the shipping cost. If this price is infeasible for your
group, please contact us to work out an arrangement.
