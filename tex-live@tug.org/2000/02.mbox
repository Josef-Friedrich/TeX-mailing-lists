I grabbed /texlive/Build/source two days ago and build everything
on Solaris 7 machine. The only problem I encountered was a spurious
space in the source/teTeX-1.0/texinfo/doc/texinfo.txi file :-)

The binaries are uploaded to sun2.dante.de, files: 
  /home/texlive/kaja/sparc-sun-solaris2.7.tar.gz   (5Mb)
and 
  /home/texlive/kaja/sparc-sun-solaris2.7.LOG.gz   (400Kb)

Is anyone already working with HP and SGI? If not, I could proceed 
with HP-UX 10.20 and IRIX 6.5.

I have now set up a Perforce change management system to control the
program sources for the TeX Live CD (not the texmf support tree yet
:-}). Since we are developing free software, the license is free.

If you want to work with this system, get yourself a client program
(for Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac or whatever) from
http://www.perforce.com, and point at sun2.dante.de:1666 as the
server.

Perforce have quite a good "10 minute intro" on their site; an even
shorter summary (for the command-line program, p4) would be

$ export P4PORT=sun2.dante.de:1666
$ p4 client thisisme       # create a new client called thisisme
                           # edit root point to be where you work
$ export P4CLIENT=thisisme
$ p4 sync //depot/Build/source/...  # suck current version of source files
$ p4 edit Build/source/teTeX-1.0/texk/dvipsk/afm2tfm.c # tag file for edit
$ vi  Build/source/teTeX-1.0/texk/dvipsk/afm2tfm.c  # edit it
$ p4 submit        # check it back in

Perforce will worry about what happens if other people also edit the
file. It does not do exclusive locking by default.

As it stands, the system is open. You all have write access. I shall
cut this down in due course.

If any or all of you are willing to give this a try, I'd be very happy.
If/when it settles down, we can get stuck into release branches, and
have www.tug.org synchronize with those.

I'll do my best to help explain any problems, but the Perforce
documentation is pretty sensible.

Subject: why the adobe.map is present in font aliases?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.1000209134613.25341K-100000@newton.feld.cvut.cz>


Hello,

I was found some special problem with font aliasing in aour actual (and
all pre) version of TeXlive.

There is a font alias algorithm described in kpathsea documentation.
This aliasing is configured via texmf/fontname/texfonts.map.
The historical reason is clear: the lcircle10<->circle10 alias has his
significance. But why the adobe.map file is included?

I prepared some example in sun2:/texlive/whyfontname.
There is a virtual font AHelvetica.vf used in test.dvi.
This virtual font points to font Helvetica (sure, this name).
The psfonts.map includes one line: "Helvetica Helvetica".
Thus the dvips works OK:
1. AHelvetica points to Helvetica
2. Helvetica is in psfonts.map, so the Helvetica PSfont is
   used but not downloaded.

On the other hand, the xdvi works very bad:
1. AHelvetica points to Helvetica
2. Helvetica*.pk is not found, the aliases are used.
3. Aliases in adobe.map say: this is the phvr8a font!
4. The phvr8a.*pk is not found, so the mktexpk is run.
5. mktexpk does not found the phvr8a in psfonts.map, so Metafont is run
6. Metafont crashes.

I mean that the problem has to be solved.

Petr Olsak

PS: now, the "tex -ini plain.tex" on sun2 says:
! tex.pool doesn't match; tangle me again (or fix the path).
I belive that this is only temporary problem.

Hello Petr,

I agree that the current situation is not good.

> 2. Helvetica*.pk is not found, the aliases are used.
> 3. Aliases in adobe.map say: this is the phvr8a font!
> 4. The phvr8a.*pk is not found, so the mktexpk is run.

Possible solutions:
1) remove the postscript fonts from texfonts.map
2) add lines to psfonts.map (e.g. for ptmr8a etc.) and add additional
   metrics (e.g. ptmr8a.tfm)
3) change kpathsea to call mktexpk for the *original* name,
   not the texfonts alias

I see the situation as follows: the idea of texfonts.map is to allow
people to say \font\foo=Helvetica, but the alias we provide (phvr8a)
does not point to a font that the system can handle. So, the alias
should be removed or the missing support (for phvr8a) should be added.

Removing the lines from texfonts.map seems to be the cleanest thing.
People can use the fonts by their Berry names. If they want other names,
they have to provide the metrics and the mapping.

"Solution" 3 would be an attempt to make a broken configuration less
broken (but still not a good configuration).

Since you live in Denmark, perhaps you can get a copy through DK-TUG.
I'm not sure if they have any left (or had any to start with).
Otherwise, the easiest way is to become a member of TUG, really.

Due to restrictions of some of the software included, it's not possible
to make the whole CD freely available or redistributable.  We hope that
the next edition will be.

Yes, you can get a copy of TeXlive4 CD in Denmark; Arne JÃ¸rgensen from 
DK-TUG has still a few CDs left. Please contact him at arne@daimi.au.dk

Of course, if you become a member of DK-TUG (http://www.sunsite.auc.dk/dk-tug),

For the moment, texsetup is intended to install programs on your
machine with the following configuration _by default_ :

root dir :
c:/Program Files/TeX
(maybe we should stick to c:/TeX ?)

Modify environment :
TEXLIVE=c:/Program Files/TeX
TEXMFCNF=%TEXLIVE%/texmf.local
PATH=%TEXLIVE%/bin/i586-win32;%PATH%

Build a texmf.local tree in %TEXLIVE%/texmf.local

Copy/edit texmf.cnf to texmf.local/web2c/texmf.cnf
TEXMF={!!TEXMFLOCAL,!!TEXMFMAIN}
HOMETEXMF will be added if HOME is set or under NT (but frankly, I'd
prefer not to deal with HOMETEXMF under Windows !)
TEXMFLOCAL=$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.local
VARTEXFONTS=$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts
TEXMFDBS = $TEXMF

mktex.cnf will be edited to reflect the mfmode and bdpi of the
default printer, and the use of varfonts.

Copy (maybe edit) various configuration files : dvips/config/config.ps,
pdftex/config/pdftex.cfg, tex4ht configuration file to $TEXMFLOCAL

These are the default values, but you can customize various locations.

My goal is that anything in $TEXMFMAIN can be removed/updated from
scratch without loosing the user configuration.

Any other suggestion welcome.

No, it's documentatiom from the TeX file, should go to texmf/doc/dvips/.
Since we have afm2tfm.html, doc/manpages/afm2tfm.dvi can be removed.
Just for cleaning up the tree. ;-)

c:/TeX would be better as default, I think. And many users will install 
on the another disk.

We have still problems with variables TEXMFCNF and VARTEXMF
(as seen from the point of view of BLU and documenting it)
If you like, it should be TEXMFCNF=%TEXLIVE%/texmf.local/web2c
or (better) VARTEXMF=%TEXLIVE%/texmf.local

> Copy (maybe edit) various configuration files : dvips/config/config.ps,

Certainly yes. And also texmf.cnf. But please be carefully $TEXMFLOCAL
or $VARTEXMF?

Great.

> Any other suggestion welcome.
What about windvi.cnf? Where it will be placed/searched?
Since I have HOME, the actual windvi uses it. But most win9x users
ignore it. By the way, windvi works quite fine with GS 6.0. Thanks.

I found that some of binaries (as well as docs) are missing in
fptex-0.4alpha3, e.g. tex4ht

look at the doc/html/manpages/cont-en.html
                              cont-de.html
                              cont-nl.html
All are pdftex, pdflatex manpages. ;-)

VARTEXMF and TEXMFLOCAL mostly have the same role. The only difference
is under Unix where you can expect /usr/local/... to hold static files
and /var/... to allow creation/removal of files. There is no such
difference under windows. So my intention was to use TEXMFLOCAL for
all local configuration and make VARTEXFONTS point to
$TEXMFLOCAL/fonts . There is no use for VARTEXMF under windows. Maybe
for completeness, VARTEXMF should point to $TEXMFLOCAL.

Thanks for any other comment,

Having CD TeX Live in mind... 
I think that seting TEXMFCNF to some directory (as Fabrice proposed) can be 
optimal only on Windows, provided that we have here also texmf.cnf copy 
with some modifications. The actual installations and texconfig (teTeX) use 
only the $MAINTEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf; it means that even if the local tree 
for configuration files was made automatically by texconfig (not _by hand_), 
we still use the same main texmf.cnf with all consequences. The texmf.cnf 
contains, e.g., a line:
  VARTEXMF=$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var
and changing it was ignored during installation (many cases).
On the other hand, the windows installer proposes something like 
.../texmf.local for the local tree (also often ignored!, but look at the 
different names), so even we set TEXMFCNF to that directory, nothing 
will work without manual changes in the main texmf.cnf, or without
seting VARTEXMF in the system environment. What more else has to be set?
The installation and the whole stuff is enough complicate...
Please remember all mails on mailing lists or private mailbox, additional 
explanations, and so on.

So we have to decide what is more important in the multiplatform 
installations as TeX Live.
My goal is to have homogenous installations on all systems, without 
specialities: ``this is for Windows'', ``this is for Linux''.

Assume such situation:
1. The admin installed TeX Live somewhere on the server and didn't touch
   the main texmf.cnf. Evebody has access to the binaries and TEMFMAIN 
   tree (RO).
2. In most cases, he doesn't know all nuances of TeX installation (he was 
   only asked to make the installation as it was prepared and he has no 
   more time to be absorbed). Somehow real, isn't it? :-(

Last time I proposed something like this for the default texmf.cnf:
HOMETEXMF=$HOME/texmf  % already set
VARTEXMF=$HOMETEXMF    % it is only set by experienced users ;-)
TEXMFMAIN={$VARTEXMF,$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}

(TEXMFLOCAL can be set as it was decided during installation, it is enough
stressed by the installation scripts, so we can ignore it here).

In such a case the normal user on Unix/Linux can just start texconfig 
(_without_ seting any more variables in the environment), which, in turn, 
will build the local tree (_not manualy_; it is not so easy for the BLU), 
and then can start his/her adventure with TeX.
Please also consider that, in many cases, the user can have more knowledge 
about TeX than sysadmin!
As I've  already wrote (and Kaja also has agreed), the main disandvantage
is that texconfig rebuilds all formats declared in the main fmtutil.cnf
--hardly acceptable by the sysadmin and also by the user (I always consider 
TeX Live).
Fabrice reminded also that on Windows we can have problems with $HOME, 
since it is rather rarely set and used ;-)

So to conclude and make live easier:
1. we can leave texmf.cnf on the CD TeX Live `as it is', but have to adapt 
   installation programs (both install-cd.sh and setup.exe for Win32) 
   to reflect the same defaults to the proposed during installation 
   additional directories (if we have, e.g., in texmf.cnf
   TEXMFLOCAL=$SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-local, the Windows setup would propose 
   `texmf-local', not `texmf.local', OK?)
2. we can stick that the user has only to set VARTEXMF, if he wants his 
   local configuration and automagically build tree (at the moment it works 
   on Unix, but I think it can be also Windows).
   Can texconfig be changed to not start with remaking all formats?
   I would propose adding `make all formats' item in the menu. 
   What do think, Thomas?
3. we can stress in the documentations (and even during instalations)
   that seting VARTEXMF is the most important (by now, it is somehow not 
   well interpreted).
4. we can have quite the same strategy for both worlds (Unix and Windows).

texconfig handles VARTEXMF (if set) in a special way. The VARTEXMF
is used for all files modified and created instead of TEXMFMAIN.

TEXMFLOCAL is just an additional texmf tree. VARTEXMF is an additional
texmf tree *with special meaning for texconfig*.

Yes and given that there is no /var tree on windows, I think I should
make $VARTEXMF point to $TEXMFLOCAL . This would minimize
documentation variants.

Another thing that is important to me : users should be able to wipe
out $TEXMFMAIN and unpack a new teTeX-texmf tree without loosing
anything. At most, they might have to upgrade their locally modified
.cnf files.

Well, just uncomment two lines:
  fmtutil --missing
  texlinks ${SILENT_TEXLINKS+-s}
(several lines below the "end: initialisation" marker).

Ok.

I don't have the time to contribute this code, however.

[Forwarding a set of questions on TeXLive4 on IBM pc. / Kaja]

Kaja:
    I have an IBM pc. I purchased TEX Live 4 with 3 other cd's =
(TEX/LATEX) from Tug a week ago. I'm having trouble getting it running. =
I installed TEX Live 4 and ran the TEX Shell from Windows 98. I did the =
following from the Shell options:

File/New
Templates/Document

I got the Latex setup then entered a line of plain text

File/Save As
Tex/Compile
Preview

at this point, nothing happened. There was no preview. The original =
window with the Latex commands stayed on the screen. I checked the Log =
and a dvi file was set up. My questions are:

(1) how do I get a preview?

(2)how do I print a dvi file. I have an HP laserjet printer. There are =
no print commands on the shell.

I have some other more general questions:

(3)What version of Latex is used by TEX Live 4.

(4)When I try running it from DOS, it says TEX, not Latex. Which is it?

Thanks for your help

First, please remember that TeXshell is an _additional_ (free!) program,
and should be somehow configured and explored by the user.
Reading the program help and configuring TeXShell would be recomended.
As concerned `Previev' option of TeXshell, please check
Options->Program Calls->DVI previewer. It should something like:
 windvi "%P%F.dvi"
Remove -i option, if it exists (it was simple mistake when preparing
TL4, sorry).

On TL4 there are dvijl*.exe for printing a dvi file. If you use TeXshell,
you should adding your own menu item for the proper printer (there are 
several programs for different HP laser jet printer models, see 
.../texmf/doc/html/manpages/dvilj.html). 
As you can, perhaps, include some graphics in your file, the best advice 
would be using GSview and previewing and printing from this program.

Check your .log file. It will display the version of LaTeX used.
Since LaTeX is changed every half a year, TeX Live 4 uses the last version
available when preparing the CD. 

> (4)When I try running it from DOS, it says TEX, not Latex. Which is it?
??? You mean running from DOS box under Windows9x/NT, or something else...
Please consider that your DOS box under Windows9x/NT means that you have
something like `the command line' for the 32-bit system, and thanks for
it (hopefuly) you can: 
1. change the local directory to do something; 
2. run programs with some parameters
The Dos box (windowed or full screen) works (again hopefuly ;-) similar
as xterm on the most `normal' systems like Unix or Linux.

Some words to the TeX Live team (excuse Bernard): we have such questions
rather frequent, so we have to stress in documentations all the subtleties
concerned Win32.

In order to avoid confusion, the windows binaries will stay in the
"bin/win32" directory.

This should make Staszek Happy :-)
