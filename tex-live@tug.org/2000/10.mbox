Tried to raise Sebastian on 'phone but no answer,
so will try here :

Using TeX Live 5d, and the attached plain TeX
document, DVIPS (invoked via WinEdt) tells me
about seven missing figures; DviType + Grep
confirm that there are no specials in the DVI
file, so what is leading DVIPS to believe that 
there should be figures?

\opening Dear Ms Moon ---

With reference to your letter (HED/1520878) of 13th September,
and previous correspondence from Mr R M E Westcott, I am confused
by the apparent contradiction in correspondence received from
Redwings.  In Mr Westecott's first letter, I was informed that it
would be necessary to confirm Jingo's place on the HED register
at annual intervals, commencing December 1998.  This I did, and
the second letter of confirmation was sent on 8th December 1999
(a copy is enclosed).  I received a very nice letter from your
Chief Equine Welfare Officer, assuring me that Jingo's place on
the register was assured and that I would \stress {not} need to
confirm his place in the future.  Now I have received a further
letter from Redwings, dated 13th September 2000 (less than twelve
months after my last letter of confirmation, and only nine months
after the letter from your Chief Equine Welfare Officer), telling
me once again that I must yet again confirm Jingo's place on the
HED register.

Whilst I am extremely grateful that Jingo \stress {is} assured a
place on the HED, I am more than a little confused by the
contradictory letters which come from your office.  I would be
very grateful if you could review the correspondence which has
passed between your office and myself over the last two years and
let me know exactly what the current situation is.

\closing Yours sincerely,
\signature Philip Taylor

This:

> (invoked via WinEdt)

I think you'll find that your editor is sneaking some code in at the
front of the tex file (check your log) that inserts source specials
that allow jumping back to the source line from the preview.

"Couldn't find figure file" is just the dvips spelling of
"unknown special" due to dvips's fallback behaviour of trying to load
a graphic file if it can't think of anything better to do with the
special.

Isn't there any way to make dvips shut up, much like xdvi ?
If no, I will need to add one.

Alternatively, remove the -src option in the call to latex in winedt.

Dear Fabrice --

None that I know of, but I'm more concerned about the
fact that it _thinks_ I have images when I know d@mned
well I do not than I am about the noise it makes...

> Alternatively, remove the -src option in the call to latex in winedt.

I am more confused than ever; it seems that WinEdt, out of the box,
uses MikTeX in preference to fpTeX, and I saw no installation
option to ask it to use fpTeX.  However, on checking the conf'n,
I see that it launches TeX.Bat, which contains :

	@ECHO OFF
	TEX.EXE %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
	pause

Thus there _is_ no -src option specified, and the DviType/Grep
combination appears to confirm that there are no specials in 
the DVI file.  So what the h@ll is persuading DVIPS that I have
images?!

Ok, this is definitely an option to add to dvips : silently ignore the
src: specials.

Out of the box, yes it is using the MiKTeX configuration. However, if
you installed WinEdt from the TeXLive 5, it should have installed a
bunched of configuration files to handle fpTeX.

I'm not that much a WinEdt user, but WinEdt 5 adds the '-src' option
when calling latex.bat -- as well as the option '-c-style-errors' if
checked in the appropriate box.

Are you sure you dvityped the file as compiled by WinEdt ? Because
I can't see much more explanations to your observations...

I concur, and I would cast the option in the following terms: silently
ignore unimplemented syntax. This approach to \special s was one of the
cornerstones of the DVI standards committee's Level 0 standard, and Tom
Rokicki has told me (1994) that he thought it would be a good idea. For
all I know have already implemented it.

Subject: config for ps fonts
Message-ID: <200010111613.RAA10324@imbolc.ucc.ie>

I must be missing something (brain cells?)

When I add a new PS font from a CD-ROM (eg BitStream), I do the usual
afm2tfm and move the files to the relevant subdirectories under
texmf/fonts, then create a .fd file and a .sty file so I can use them
in LaTeX in the normal way, then add a line per fontfile to (eg)
bitstrea.map and make sure config.ps references it. This has worked
fine for years.

Suddenly under TL5d neither dvips nor windvi can display anything
because mktexpk is trying to run metafont! Something is obviously
missing somewhere: where does mktexpk look to see if it needs to run
gsftopk or metafont? dvips fails also, which is equally puzzling,
as in the past it has been the presence of the font line in the .map
file which says "I'm a PostScript font not a Metafont font".

Only one way to know for sure what's happening : make a small tex
file using your font, then run dvips  or windvi with the usual debug
variables set:
set KPATHSEA_DEBUG=-1
set KPATHSEA_DEBUG_OUTPUT=err.log
dvips foo -o

and send me the log file together with the files that were referenced
in it (ie : check that the .map and other files used are the ones you
want).

The lines in psfonts.map are matched using regular expressions to find
out if gsftopk or mktexpk should be called.

sounds mildly plausible

it reads config.ps, doesnt it?

are you sure its reading the same config.ps file which you expect? thats
the likeliest explanation

You tell me :-) I have always assumed that it did.

I hope so. There ought to be only one of them installed by TL5...in
texmf/dvips/base I hope...

Subject: Support for Mac OS Server and Mac OS X
Message-ID: <39E750C1.29694110@teleport.com>

I am working with some other developers to generate binaries for Mac OS
X Server and Mac OS X and expect to have scripts debugged for install
(install-cd.sh and install-pkg.sh) and build (source/configure) at some
point. 

My hope is that there is room on the TL6 CD for this additional set of
binaries and that users groups can make some hay from Apple's new
operating system (which is, underneath all, BSD UNIX). I have confirmed
that a TeX Live 5d-based installation works fine (albeit I had to use
binaries generated by others), and there is a Cocoa (native) GUI for TeX.

I have installed TL5d on a number of machines, one of them Linux 6.1 on
i86 as a reference platform. 

I can say at this point that install-cd.sh and install-pkg.sh do not
appear to work properly under Mac OS X Public Beta, and that
source/configure does not appear to yield satisfactory results. I hope I
can get some help from this list as I attempt to debug these scripts.

I think I will get some help from Stephen Peters in working out the
build scripts, since he has successfully built the web2c binaries for
this platform. He has sent me his notes.

they need a complete replacement anyway, if you are feeling strong

I am quite surprised, however. Thomas Esser wrote them, and he writes
seriously solid shell scripts. 

On the other hand, if it cheers you up, I have another message today
confirming that SGI, like IBM, manage to ship a /bin/sh which is a
broken Korn shell.

Note:

Please Please Please if you are going to work on this, use the change
management system (Perforce) to keep up to date with the current
source tree. Otherwise you'll end up sending us patches to old source,
which is a pain to work. Much better if you commit changes to the
source tree yourself, in a controlled way.

TL6's source tree is already considerably changed from TL5d; not least
because Fabrice rearranged directories.

OK.

Ja freilich. Auf der TeX Live CD steht dasselbe Programmpaar
GhostScript/GSview fuer Windows genauso wie fuer Linux. Wenn
Sie in setup32 schauen, finden Sie gsv27550.exe

Dafuer muss Ihre Professor jedenfalls natuerlich zuerst ein PS-Datei
mit dvips machen, dann kann er mit GSview leicht auf fast jedem
nicht-PS-Drucker drucken.

Sorry, I should have appended that. He asked if there was something
under Win which would print on a non-PS printer and I pointed him
at Ghostscript/GSview.

Then in this case, windvi is able to print too on a non-ps printer, at
least for short documents (huge spool files sometimes), and it can
print bmp and wmf/emf image files together with ps image files, colors
and so on. I don't know how much reliable it is, but it has worked for
me on my epson photo 750.

I have updated all the fptex-0.4 distribution thanks to Sebastian's

on too. TeXSetup should be ok on windows ME, but I need reports about
it (problem with environment variables).

Message-ID: <000001c03f89$28288ef0$4b92ed82@george.anchem.su.se>

Dear TeX support

I have great problems when installing TeX Live 4 March 1999. The machine
used is an Toshiba Satelite PRO CDT410, a Pentium 166Mhz or 200MHz. The disk
is 800Mb and the only software installed is  a minimum Windows 95 (approx
130 Mb. Directly after installation of recomended TeX the system starts to
delete all files in the \TeX directory and the procedure stops when all
TeX-files and TeX-direcories are erased. Have you experienced this before?
Can you give me some advice?

I had some problem reading \texmf\web2c\texmf.cnf and
\texmf\ttf2pk\unicode.sfd but I do not think this is the origin of my
problem.

I intend to write my Ph.D. thesis on LaTeX2e so I have to solve this
problem.

Sincerely
George Robertsson

I have not seen this sort of report before.

But whatever else you do, get the TeX Live 5 CD-ROM. The installation
is much improved.

Hi:

I would like to install TeX Live and currently have version 4 from my 1999
membership but notice that version 5 is now out. I have been running
bare-bones emTeX and would like the larger system that evidently comes with
the CD. So my question is: when do you think the first volume of TugBoat
will be out with this CD? Should I wait a bit before installing TeX Live 4?

Thanks!
