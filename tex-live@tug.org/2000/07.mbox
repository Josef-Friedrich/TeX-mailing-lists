Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0007041643390.10439-100000@cdfpc24.in2p3.fr>

hi,
Is there somewhere a document describing the main improvements on
the TeX Live 4 cd with respect to the previous one?
Same question question for the TeX Live 5 to come.

If the answer is "nowhere", it would be a good idea to write this document,
at least for the main features.

Best regards,

I agree, it would be nice. Each version of the documentation says a
little about it, but not in great detail.

But the answer is always the same. the changes are

 - keeping up to date with releases of font and macro packages
    (literally hundreds of them change each year)
 - finding and fixing errors
 - keeping up with the current sources of the TeX family of programs
 - improving the install programs

Subject: TeX Live 4 installation on Win95
Date: Wed, 05 Jul 2000 14:14:20 -0500

Hi,

I ran \systems\msdos\emtex\install.exe from the TeX Live 4 CD, and it
seemed to go ok until I got a message saying to reboot and after that
run the <install_dir>\emtex\install\install program to complete
installation.  When I did that and tried to create a format file for
latex2e (latex.fmt), I got a Windows error "General Protection
Exception".  I rebooted and tried again and the same thing happened.  I
checked autoexec.bat and it had been updated to set the environment
correctly.  (On WinNT, I had to set the environment myself.)  I also
tried running makefmt from a dos window and also got a "General
Protection Exception".  (I tried the same makefmt command that worked on
NT.)  What is this error, and what should I do about it?

Thanks,
Karen

Subject: `TeXnicCenter' for TeX Live
Message-ID: <396DAD0C.42E218C9@ptb.de>


It would be useful for windows user if the TeX Live CD contains the
`TeXnicCenter'.

>From the README
===============================================================
1. WHAT IS TEXNICCENTER?
------------------------
TeXnicCenter is an integrated development environment (IDE) for
developing LaTeX-documents on windows (Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT 4.0).

The term 'integrated development environment' originally comes from the
software development and means, that you have one application, in which
you can write your code, start the compiler and test the results. I am
using this term for TeXnicCenter, because it provides the same
functionality, instead of, that it was made for developing
LaTeX-documents, and not source code.

2. WHAT DOES TEXNICCENTER COST?
-------------------------------
TeXnicCenter is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL) and is therefore available for free.
===============================================================

`TeXnicCenter' is located at CTAN: 
`tex-archive/systems/win32/TeXnicCenter/' or at

==> http://neptune.spaceports.com/~wiegand/texniccenter/


Thanks for your very good work,

Message-ID: <200007131246.NAA05783@imbolc.ucc.ie>

I was trying to get the TL4 running from the CD-ROM on a user's very
small system the other day. Not hard to set the path and get WinEdt
execute tex, latex, dvips and windvi, but I ran into a problem with
dvips/windvi trying to run mktexpk of course, as they had nowhere to
do the work and nowhere to install the pk files afterwards. Obviously
there is an environment variable to be set for these, but I was unable
to identify it: any pointers?

The user will now go and buy a nice new machine and dualboot linux
and win98 for other reasons, so I can install TL5 later. But the
paths presumably would hold true for trying to run the system direct
from the TL5 CD-ROM as well...it's a nice selling-point for people
that you don't have to interfere too much with their hard disks just
to demo the system, but getting it to auto-generate a few bitmaps
would be nice.

Is PDFlatex still unable to use Metafont-made (pk) bitmaps? Despite
their drawbacks in rendering, it would be nice to be able to create
PDF files with a \texteuro in them.

In texmf.cnf :

VARTEXMF = c:/vartexmf
VARTEXFONTS = c:/vartexmf/fonts

in mktex.cnf:
: ${MT_FEATURES=appendonlydir:varfonts:fontmaps}
: ${MODE=ljfour}
: ${BDPI=600}

TL5 has an option to be installed so that it will run of the cd.

Isn't there a pfb for this one ? 
Else, yes pdftex is able to use pk files, but will not call mktexpk by
itself (as far as I know).

i fear Nelson is right. if it says just Linux on it, Richard Stallman

Hi Art,
On-Line Copy says the artwork is too large for the CD.  Needs to fit their 
specifications (which they say you have)....they can't adjust the size due 
to type of file rec'd.  Will you please send them another file?  They need 
to receive it today to stay on schedule (mail CD's by this Friday).
Thought I'd send this note in case you don't get my phone message...
If it's easy to change the color, purple was suggested (green has been 
used)...thought maybe you misunderstood this.  No sweat though.
Thank-you,
Robin
