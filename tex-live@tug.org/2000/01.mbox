Dear Tom,

Thanks for your note. I agree that the value of the CDs is high compared to
the cost of membership, and hope that we can continue to increase the value
to our members every year. I am copying your note to the TeXLive committee
for consideration. Thanks for the suggestion.

Have a great year, and thanks for your support of TUG!

Dear Mimi,

Many thanks for your email dated 6 January. I have just renewed by email,
isn't life convenient!

The TeX Live CD-ROM alone is worth the money.
For a little while I had a mysterious printout error until I realized that
it was set for European size paper. Perhaps a more prominent notice to this
effect would help. (Or even, gilding the lily, make it and option at
installation time.)

I find the CTAN CD-ROMS to be useful, more convenient than navigating
through the Web sites.

All the best,

Tom Barton

Dear Sir,
I have installed Texlive from CD-Rom (the newest one)into my PC, under Windows 98 including WinEditor program. Everything was going well, except that I could not view dvi file inside Texshell (I could run Tex succesfully) as well as inside Winedt. 
1) After running Tex, I click into Preview icon, windvi opened and closed immediately, although Windvi can run well independently (means outside Texshell or Winedt). Looked at Programs Call, everything fixed well.
2) Inside Winedt, after runing tex successfully, I clicked into the "Dvi Preview" line in the Accessories menu, nothing happended.
Then I clicked  "Dvi Search", it said that the program "yap.exe" could not be found. I went into the files Winedt.ini in the Winedt directory and changed the lines contating those programs. Namely, I changed "yap.exe "into "windvi.exe" and "YAP" into "WINDVI".
Then, running Winedt again, but Dvi Preview  still did not work. This time, when I clicked into "Dvi Search", the error line did not appear, but Windvi opened and closed immediately ( it looked as the same  problem as Texshell). I do not know how to solve this.
Could you please be so kind to help me to correct this problem?
If anything is still not clear, please let me explain more.
Thank you very much in advance.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.1000118091123.4456L-100000@newton.feld.cvut.cz>


Hello,

I have roughly looked into TeX implementation on sun2.dante.de, may be the
prototype of the future TeXlive 5 distribution. I am surprising that CSTeX
is missing here because I assumed that the new distribution is derived
from TeXlive 4, where CSTeX is present and working well. 

Only the lines TEXINPUTS.* from CSTeX are presnet in web2c/texmf.cnf.

If we need a new re-implementation of CSTeX into sun2, it is possible to
do following: Get the 

csplain.tar.gz
csfonts.tar.gz
cspsfonts.tar.gz
csfonts-t1.tar.gz
cslatex.tar.gz

from ftp://math.feld.cvut.cz/pub/cstex/web2c/
and untar these archives to texmf tree. That is all.

I will not do this work because I heared that the changes on texmf tree
have to be done by the more difficult way in order the all changes in
texmf tree will be logged something.

I will test the result of this implementation of CSTeX immediately.
May be some little configuration changes will be needed.

Thank you

Petr Olsak

TL5-alpha3, Jan 18 2000
=======================

remove /ERRATA
move /doc/kpathsea.ps to /texmf/doc/kpathsea/ and remove /doc/
remove /systems/os2/emtexTDS
move /systems/msdos/emtexTDS.zip to /systems/os2/
(it contains somehow more actual stuff than this just removed from
/systems/os2/).

--------------
/setupw32/texshell32/   should be updated from CTAN.
texshell.ini should be corrected:

old> Preview=windvi -1 "%P%F.dvi"
new> Preview=windvi -single "%P%F.dvi"

--------------
/texmf/doc/guides/epslatex/
epslatex.pdf is worth of adding here

--------------
/texmf/doc/html/guides/texcnven.html
               ========= ??
I'm always curious why this file occupy directory with such a name ;-)

--------------
/texmf/doc/html/index.html
link to nonexistent ../../../../FAQ/english/english/texfaq_toc.html
link to nonexistent catalogue/ctfull.html
  (should be catalogue/catalogue.html)
link to nonexistent latex2html/index.html
link to nonexistent auctex/auc-tex_toc.html
missing (very important, I think) links to:
manpages/index.html (worth of making it),
etex/etex.html
fptex/fptex.html
tetex/tetex.html (not exist anymore?)

--------------
/texmf/doc/generic/babel/  empty

--------------
It not clear what is in /texmf/doc/lwc/
There is no global readme. I can imagine there are LaTeX Web Companion
examples, but many of them are from LaTeX Graphics Companion (?).
Some interesting stuff but from the user point: where to start and what
can be done with it?

--------------
Using frequently TL CD on win32 gives always the same problem: most users
do complain that while inserting the CD, the setup is always started.
Can we consider removing autorun.exe and starting setup only when desired?
It is not problem for me, by please think about most simply users
and such idiotic bahaviour of M$ Windows.

--------------
Starting setup on windows failed; there is no:
bin\win32\einitex.exe
   ======
texmf\doc\html\catalogue\tar.gif
so such setup, based on exact list of files is too fragile.
I know, Fabrice is working on it, so I still keep crossed fingers...

--------------
I know that bin/i586-win32/ is more informative, but I prefer just
bin/win32/ . Fabrice, can you reconsider it? In Win making, e.g.,
`cd i586-win32' from the command line is not so straightforward as
on Unix ;-)

Long standing bug. I'll correct.

The autorun I used was advertised with a feature that would prevent it
to run if the program was already installed. Obviously I just believed
the statement and didn't test it actually :-( Next time, I'll check.

yes, you are  probably right. This   was to state  that those programs
won't run (?) on something less than an i586. And now that Thanh wants
to put mingw32 support, we will have a problem. The Gnu standard would
be to use something like i586-pc-win32. The  Thomas Esser standard was
a bit shorter. I agree that win32 is easier, but leaves less
opportunities for variants.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0001210602120.26118-100000@chronos.ipipan.gda.pl>

I. Basic installation on Linux:
-------------------------------
fmtutil: `pdfetex -ini -efmt=cont-de -progname=context cont-de.ini' failed.
install_link failed for /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/latex. File already exists.
install_link failed for /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/hugetex. File already exists.
install_link failed for /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/hugelatex. File already exists.
install_link failed for /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/texinfo. File already exists.

After installation, fmtutil.cnf in $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/ and even in 
$VARTEXMF/web2c/ has most of formats unblocked (but we have BASIC
installation!), so the first run of texconfig tries to build all that
formats. (???)
Again:
install_link failed for /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/latex. File already exists.

I've already proposed not to regenerate all formats when starting texconfig.
It is evident that we start texconfig to do something and it would be more
natural when closing it if some formats declared in fmtutil.cnf
are not ready.

lists/free/texlive1/texlive contains context ini files, but installed 
files are out of use when doing basic installation. This part should go to
lists/free/formats2/context

---------
Well, all was more clear when I started 
II. Recommended installation 
----------------------------

The first run of texconfig only simulates generating all formats; nothing 
new was added to $VARTEXMF/web2c/ or $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/ , even after
changes in fmtutil.cnf (all needed formats were already in $TEXMFMAIN/web2c/).
It is only pity that now $VARTEXMF/web2c/ does not contain a copy of
texmf.cnf. 

I always think what to do with VARTEXMF and HOMETEXMF issues...
As I wrote some times ago, the only way texconfig builds automagically 
a small local tree is setting VARTEXMF (setting HOMETEXMF or LOCALTEXMF
do nothing from the user's point of view; even more, in most cases, in 
standalone installations it is rather redundant). If VARTEXMF is not set
(most cases, because it is not stressed in the documentations or even
during install!), the user (or admin) has to build his local tree _by hand_ 
(or use existing one, if any). 
Now we have such situation: the admin installs the whole stuff on the server.
He has to know perfectly  what more can be done with configuration 
(_rare_ case, believe me). 
If some user wants to try and work with TeX, he _must_ use the global 
configuration (printer, etc.), or he has to learn enought, build his local 
tree _by hand_, copy and modify some files from the global configuration, 
etc. All that rather frustrating, according my mail box.
Conclusion: perhaps it would be wise to set, by default, in texmf.cnf 
someting like:
HOMETEXMF = $HOME/texmf
VARTEXMF = $HOMETEXMF
thus allowing the user starting `texconfing init' on demand.
Believe me, most people do ignore an option of setting VARTEXMF during 
install ;-) More exposed is VARTEXMF.
I would be nice that `texconfig init' will copy also texmf.cnf, what do 
you think, Thomas?

III. AMSFONTS
-------------
In basic installation we have all bsr Type1 files (euler, cyrillic, symbols),
by we haven't tfm files for them.
Perhaps this fonts can be added to lists/free/fonts2/amsfonts
(with all accompanying afm etc. files).
By the way, 
 texmf/fonts/afm/bluesky/euler
 texmf/fonts/afm/bluesky/cyrillic
 texmf/fonts/afm/bluesky/symbol
are missing on TL CD (we have only afm/ams/cmextra/ and afm/ams/cyrillic/)
Well, it is the best time to clean up all that mess.
1. all such fonts are copyrighted (and blessed) by AMS
   please look at, e.g., fonts/afm/bluesky/cm/cmb10.afm  ;-)
                                  =========
2. a part of work was done by Y&Y and a consortium of scientific publishers;
3. now all fonts are freely available for general use, as stated in READ.ME;
4. all fonts reside in fonts/amsfonts/ area on CTAN;
5. I hope that we can do the following:
   texmf/fonts/afm/ams/cmextra/
   texmf/fonts/afm/ams/cyrillic/
   texmf/fonts/afm/ams/euler/
   texmf/fonts/afm/ams/symbol/

   texmf/fonts/pfm/ams/cmextra/
   texmf/fonts/pfm/ams/cyrillic/
   texmf/fonts/pfm/ams/euler/
   texmf/fonts/pfm/ams/symbol/

   texmf/fonts/tfm/ams/cmextra/
   texmf/fonts/tfm/ams/cyrillic/
   texmf/fonts/tfm/ams/euler/
   texmf/fonts/tfm/ams/symbol/

   texmf/fonts/type1/ams/cmextra/
   texmf/fonts/type1/ams/cyrillic/
   texmf/fonts/type1/ams/euler/
   texmf/fonts/type1/ams/symbol/
and we will have finally a consistent tree. 
I know well that this means a little revolution (also in distributions), 
but it is worth of it!
Freezing the actual situation is worse, I mean.
Nevertheless, we have to add to, say, texmf/doc/fonts/amsfonts/type1/
another information about Type1 fonts and their history and copyright  
(CTAN//fonts/amsfonts/ps-type1/READ.ME).

Now, what to do with CM Type1?
a) asking BSR for agreement in such positioning in TDS tree:
   texmf/fonts/afm/public/cm/
   texmf/fonts/pfm/public/cm/
   texmf/fonts/type1/public/cm/
in that case we have consistent tree with fonts/sources/  and fonts/tfm/
(may I ask somebody to pass this problem to Blue Sky Research? I believe
that they will agree. Many thanks in advance.)

b) leaving `as it is':  
   texmf/fonts/afm/bluesky/cm/
   texmf/fonts/pfm/bluesky/cm/ (missing on the last TL)
   texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/
somehow inconsistent and artificial. 

We can leave all stuff for dvips as is.

---------
I'd also propose: 
 mv texmf/lists/free/latex2/mflogo texmf/lists/free/fonts1/
and change 1 line in it.
I think mflogo are more important then e.g. fonts1/mfmisc.

---------
texmf/dvips/gsftopk/render.ps should be changed to 1.18

---------

That's enouht, I'm a little tired...

thanks to staszek for pointing out some problems with the amsfonts
on the tex live cd.

ams is handling the copyright and permission matters for the blue sky
fonts.  i will pursue your question and report whether we have any
concerns about where these are included in the tree.  (i don't think
we do, as long as there is proper attribution somewhere in the
documentation.)

i would like to point out, though, that the type 1 collection does
not include all the sizes for which metafonts were initially created.
thus, there are tfm files on ctan for which no type 1 fonts exist.
i can provide a list for reference; it would be counterproductive
to have tfm files without the usable shapes, and i'm not convinced
that mixing type 1 and bitmap shapes is a good idea either.

may i also point out that the mflogo fonts in the ams/bluesky type 1
collection don't have the "P" and "S" needed for "metapost".  this
can cause unpleasant surprises.  i would recommend that if some other
type 1 implementation of the mflogo fonts is available, that it be
used instead of the faulty one.  (we are trying to get this sorted
out and fixed, but the wheels of bureaucracies grind *very* slowly!)

It is possible to fill the gaps with map file entries for dvips / pdftex:
  eurm9 EURM10 <eurm10.pfb
  ...
This is what I do in teTeX. Most people don't even notice anything about
the missing type1 fonts.

For teTeX, I use Taco's versions of these fonts. He has changed the
fontnames (uppercase vs. lowercase) in his fonts, so they can be used
as drop-in replacements for the ams/bluesky fonts.

In teTeX, the ams/bluesky type 1 fonts are insubdirectories of "bluesky".
I can change that to ams if this is what everyone agrees on.

i was finally able to provide code to force the desired result,

Sure, it does. I have used dvips and pdftex and compared the output of
bitmap fonts vs. scaled type 1 (map file trick mentioned above). No
difference in size.

I don't really understand why it works, but it does. :-) Maybe, we should
ask Tomas or Thanh.

If you use the same tfms the difference between a real 9pt font and a
scaled 10pt are hardly going to be noticeable are they?

If you use the 10pt tfm, scaled the metrics match the font more exactly
but could produce different line breaks which would be noticeable.

You can in principle make the scaled 10pt  match the 9pt metrics
exactly by wrapping it in a vf file, rather than just using scaling in
the map file.

That isn't a bug, that's the above feature. the psamsfonts does not
switch between type 1 and pk it switches between using 9pt fonts and
using 10pt fonts at 90%, whether you are using pk or type1 for rendering
isn't known to tex. But it will affect the line breaks.

    scaled 10pt are hardly going to be noticeable are they?

between 9pt and scaled 10pt, no, but it becomes more obvious in
the smaller sizes, especially if used as text strings (the wncy*
fonts in the amspsfonts have only 10pt files).  between 8pt and
7pt, the relative widths of anything based on cm start to increase,
and this becomes even more marked at 6pt and 5pt.

    If you use the 10pt tfm, scaled the metrics match the font more exactly
    but could produce different line breaks which would be noticeable.

    You can in principle make the scaled 10pt  match the 9pt metrics
    exactly by wrapping it in a vf file, rather than just using scaling in
    the map file.

but providing the vf file is, like, work!  not really likely to
happen from ams, i don't think.

definitely a feature.

    ... the psamsfonts does not
    switch between type 1 and pk it switches between using 9pt fonts and
    using 10pt fonts at 90%, whether you are using pk or type1 for rendering
    isn't known to tex. But it will affect the line breaks.

i will float the notion of providing vf files for the most common
cases, but don't offer much hope that it will be adopted.

Ahemm ... I have setup the cvs server on my ftp server.
You can try to connect :

cvs -d :pserver:texlive@ftp.ese-metz.fr:/local/texlive/Build login
[password is Knuth]
cvs -d :pserver:texlive@ftp.ese-metz.fr:/local/texlive/Build checkout texlive
cvs -d :pserver:texlive@ftp.ese-metz.fr:/local/texlive/Build logout

I'm new to this so you can test it. I intend to have a reader only
mode and a reader/writer mode. For the moment, you should be able to
commit changes.

I was not clear enough : I don't want to maintain this at this
location (except if people ask me to do so). It is merely an attempt
at trying locally what is needed. Once it is clear enough, we could
try to do that on sun2.dante.de . There are several issues :
- how works ssh authentication (does it work for windows ?)
- what modules are needed (doc, tetex, texmf-source ...)

Opinions ?

Dvips uses also tmf files and is enought smart to do the scalling.
Quite the same result can be obtained in a way:
cmbsy7 CMBSY10 ".7 EntendFont" <cmbsy10.pfb
but, e.g.,
cmbsy6 CMBSY7 <cmbsy.pfb
is just scaled with more accuracy ;-)

Yes, but only making `good' vf files edited `by hand' and precisely
defining the positioning has some sense.

The only `legal' and 100\% clean way is using \font\X zzzz atYpt
in the TeX file (it needs checking some packages). It can cure the problem
of line breaks, etc.
Other substitutions (in map file or in vf) are somehow artifficial
and always can give impredictable results (e.g. some fonts can have 
different set of glyphs, look at cmr5 and cmr7 ;-)

For the moment, the approximation provided by bsr-missing-interpolated.map
is better than nothing, and, again, making more stuff like new set of 
vf fonts would make live harder. It would be better making some changes
in style files since making ps and pdf files are more and more frequent 
and expected.

But it is another question...

oops!  that should have been either

so the facilities *are* there already if amsfonts.sty is present.

    Yes, but only making `good' vf files edited `by hand' and precisely
    defining the positioning has some sense.

this is the only way we do make vf files.  a *lot* of handwork in
some cases!  (many years ago, we implemented such files to be able
to use autologic times fonts in math.  determining the proper
metrics and building the files took a whole person-month, spread
over several months elapsed.  a *lot* of handwork ...  we were
never able to distribute these metrics because of a contractual
agreement with autologic; on the other hand we *do* have a real
appreciation of what is involved.)

    The only `legal' and 100\% clean way is using \font\X zzzz atYpt
    in the TeX file (it needs checking some packages). It can cure the problem
    of line breaks, etc.

this is what the psamsfonts option does -- but for people who really
want the metrics of a "designed" 9pt font, using, e.g.,
    wncyr10 at 8pt
isn't going to be happy.  fortunately, all the cm fonts *do* have
all the requisite sizes, and glyphs from math and symbol fonts are
usually used only one at a time.

    Other substitutions (in map file or in vf) are somehow artifficial
    and always can give impredictable results (e.g. some fonts can have 
    different set of glyphs, look at cmr5 and cmr7 ;-)

    For the moment, the approximation provided by bsr-missing-interpolated.map
    is better than nothing, and, again, making more stuff like new set of 
    vf fonts would make live harder. It would be better making some changes
    in style files since making ps and pdf files are more and more frequent 
    and expected.

i've just discovered a probable cause of problems ...
the "bundled" type 1 amsfonts collection on the ams server has *all*
the tfm files in it, not just the ones for the fonts that have type 1
renditions.  i will take that up internally; i think it should be
changed.  (but i don't always win these discussions.)

    But it is another question...

indeed.

Well, I don't have the time to work on teTeX now, so please find a
solution for TL5 without my help. I might pick that up later (when I have
time again).  I think that "texlinks" could be changed to provide wrapper
scripts (to build the formats as needed). Maybe, fmtuil.cnf should gat
another column which controls whether format files are build by fmtutil
-all or not (which means: later, "on demand").
