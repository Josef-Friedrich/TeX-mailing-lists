TL5b is now at 649/650mbytes, which makes me nervous.

I'd be grateful for ideas on what to throw out. When can I throw away
emTeX?

Now. If there are DOS users out there, perhaps someone could undertake
to burn half a dozen copies of emTeX onto CD-ROM and stockpile them.

I just started to download the iso image from texlive.dante.de but
it's stalled. Is there a copy closer to me?

Hmmm... difficult decission and somehow politically incorrect.
There are still many DOS, win3.x and OS/2 users.
TeX Live is considered friendly even for them and they can find on the
same CD the additional stuff.

Just for emTeX?? Who can do it and for what?

Sorry, perhaps it is my fault. I gziped texlive.iso for faster download.
In the meanwhile Sebastian prepared next revision... ;-)
I've already asked him to gzip the iso image immediatelly.

now you seem to have gzipped it!

the problem is that the disk is full at sun.dante.de, so I cannot
maintain both .iso and .iso.gz. Perforce history is taking more than I 
anticipated.

Perhaps it is time for TUG to pony up for a bigger disk for this
computer. What do you say?

I speculate we are talking aboutm say, $300 for a 9Gb SCSI disk. I
believe an expense of this magnitude would pass the TUG ExComm or Board.

I don't think it's anything to do with the file size.
I'm trying to download http://sun2.dante.de/Images/texlive.iso

===================================
It seems that everything works fine, as well from admin as from BLU point
of view. Many thanks for Sebastian at all!
Some compromise we've made will be welcomed by the normal user, i hope...

Only some small corrections:

1.
Typo error in install-cd.sh:
VARTEXTEXMF (Directory for local config)    : /usr/TeX/texmf-var
   ======
--------   
2. 
basic install made mllatex.fmt and mltex.fmt ??
Do you know anybody using ml[la]tex? It is OK for `recommended' install.
   
--------
3.
`Recommended instal.' After some messages: 
  I will now create the filename database,
  add /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux to your PATH, and run
     texconfig init
  to initialize your system and create

  You should make sure that /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux

the user have to wait long time without any message like:

I don't know what TUG are going to do, but
sun2.dante.de/Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/labels/label.tex is what I
used for Addison Wesley, in lieu of anything else. The lion pictures
from TL4 are there too. If you can make up a new label, using the 
running lion, processable using TeX, I'd be very happy. TL4 label was
made by Art using some silly software like Illustrator or Photoshop:-}

MAKE SURE ANY LABEL SAYS 5b, not 5a!!!

I fetched the CD image, it took about 1 hour, and placed it in our ftp area: 
  host: ftp.daimi.au.dk
  users: anonymous
  file: /pub/kaja/texlive-20000406.iso.bz2
Maybe downloading would be faster from here?

I finally got the iso image downloaded and burned onto cd-rom.

But when I open it, double-clicking on autorun.exe doesn't do anything
(i have autostart turned off, so i need to double-click some
executable to start something running). Any ideas?

I've observed that texlive-20000413.iso.bz2 is already present on CTAN 
servers. Since Fabrice corrected TeXsetup on April 14th (ntemacs install)
and, perhaps, he has something more updated (e.g. fptex docs), I'd suggest
recreating the iso image for TeX Live5b. 
It will bring less messages from the users, I hope ;-)
Sebastian, you hear me? If not, I could do it just after Fabrice
will accept all his changes.

I can't update docs right now, probably only this week-end. However,
yes please update the image with the very last setup program.

Subject: task list for manufacturing and distributing TeX Live
Message-ID: <39015368.1B47ABC7@teleport.com>

At the recent ExComm meeting I promised to post a list of the tasks
involved with the manufacturing and distribution of TeX Live. These
tasks were carried out for TL4 by Patricia Monohon and me. Mimi Jett has
expressed her preference for the office to handle these tasks for TL5.

1. Determine the publication date of TUGboat 20.1. This issue will carry
TeX Live 5, and if the timing is appropriate, possibly CTAN (3-CD set)
as well. It has to be sufficiently thick (in page count) to  provide
sufficient protection for the CDs that would be inserted.

2. Obtain bids for the pressing of the TL5 CDs, based on the volume of
CDs produced last year, with adjustments to anticipate changes in the
ordering levels between last year and this. The specifications for the
CD-ROM should include: one CD-ROM, approximate quantity, 2-color label,
paper sleeve.

3. Determine TUG's order size. This entails in effect doing a count of
current members and making a prediction of how many units will be
required over and above this amount to cover additional orders received
up to the point where TL6 replaces TL5.

4. Determine pricing. TL4 was sold using a 2-tier pricing scheme such
that the larger user groups, such as TUG, Dante, UKTuG, NTG, and
GUTenberg paid a somewhat higher price (including shipping at cost), and
smaller groups such as CSTug, etc. paid cost (with free shipping).
Commercial entities pay at the higher rate.

5. Draft solicitation letter and submit to texlive@tug.org for feedback.
This is the letter that is sent (via email) to past customers and to
anyone else who should be interested in quantity purchases of TL.

6. Send out solicitation letter; follow up with each recipient. Last
year, GUTenberg's letter went into a black hole, so we should learn the
lesson: if you don't get a response, follow up.

7. Obtain and test gold master.

8. Generate artwork for CD label. Should be in the form of pre-separated
EPS, with alignment targets.

9. Submit order for pressing of the CDs. The manufacturer should drop
ship to the larger recipients. They will recharge us for the shipping costs.

10. Invoice recipients.

11. Prepare report, including quantity, contact, date, amount charged
for each recipient.

Anyone see any holes here, please let me know so I can revise this task list.

Cheers,
Arthur Ogawa

Thanks for the bringing up the point and for making your suggestion.

Actually, these bear on marketing to individuals rather than bulk sales
to LUGs or others, so it does not fall under my discussion. However they
do require addressing.

My position is to tell such people that they are welcome to purchase the
product. It costs $65 and consists of TeX Live, the CTAN CD set, and
four issues of TUGboat along with, incidently, a TUG membership for
2000. This is to say that TUG has one product, regardless of how it is packaged.

This means that people who want to buy TeX Live alone for cheap are out
of luck. But I think that it is outside of what TUG is able to provide
at this time. We do not do retail sales to my knowledge, and if we did
it is not clear that TUG would be doing it at breakeven, not to speak of
at a profit.

Most often when people want to buy the CD alone, they are not aware of
what TUG is or what it is doing, and they do not realize that TeX Live
is being manufactured by TUG specifically as a benefit to the various
TeX user groups and their members. Once they learn this, they are
usually quite happy to pay the $65. (You can't find a product to compete
with this: the four CDs cost you $65, total!)

If someone contacts you about TL and finds our offer
(http://www.tug.org/texlive) unsatisfactory, please send them on to me.
I would certainly like to become acquainted with the market segment
whose needs we are currently not addressing. Nelson, about how many such
requests do you see?

Message-ID: <200004222251.SAA09611@freefriends.org>

Here is the letter we sent out last year to the big guys, followed by
the diffs for the small guys.  I've also created a directory
~tug/live/1999/ with these two files (and an empty directory
~tug/live/2000 for whatever we create this year).

This letter needs changing.

- dates and such
- the copying conditions for TL5 are quite different (and vastly
  simpler).  This is a big change.
- Sebastian, please check over the first paragraph especially and let us
  know what systems are being supported.

I probably won't have time to come up with a draft revision for 5 or 6
days, so if anyone else can give it a shot, that would be great.

Subject: TeX Live 4 available for ordering

TeX Live 4 is almost ready!  It will have a runnable system for all
major Unix variants (including both Linux libc5 and libc6) and Windows
32 (Windows NT, 95, and 98) systems.  It also will include archives of
CMacTeX (for Mac users), emTeX (for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), and
djgpptex (alternative for Windows 3.1 or earlier).  Aladdin Ghostscript
5.50, imagemagick, and winedt are included.  Support for FreeBSD, NeXT,
and Amiga, as well as the MikTeX distribution, is not included due
solely to lack of space.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 4, the 1999
release of TeX Live.  In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's
heroic efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to
TeX users worldwide.


First, about copying conditions.  TUG's intention in the terms for
further redistribution of the TeX Live CD-ROM is to give the donors of
the software contained therein the assurance that the licensing
requirements they have made are properly observed.

Because these requirements vary so much between different packages on
the CD, TUG strongly recommends that you simply pass the CD on to your
members as a benefit of membership and allow TUG to handle requests for
further redistribution of the CD.  TUG will be distributing TeX Live to
its own members as a benefit of membership in TUG.

Some of the software requires that, if it is packaged with other
publications, such as books or journals, those things be freely
copyable.  A model for this is TUGboat; please see the sample notice
below.  This is relevant if you plan on distributing the CD with your
newsletter or journal.

Anyone interested in including the CD with a non-redistributable
offering of any kind should contact TUG directly.  This is not allowed
by default!  Likewise, charging anything more than a nominal fee (to
recover costs) is also not allowed by default -- and it is far better to
charge nothing at all for the CD itself, but to provide it as a free
benefit of membership, as TUG does.  (These conditions, like the others,
are set by some of the software on the CD, not by TUG.)

There will be a file on the CD that explains the copying conditions
further, as well as an announcement in TUGboat, on tug's web site, etc.
If you have concerns in distributing the TeX Live CD to your members,
please contact us right away at tex-live@tug.org.


Second, production details: expected manufacturing date of TL4 is early-
to mid-April 1999.  We expect to mail the CD's to you shortly thereafter.

We expect to be able to offer TeX Live to your user group at a cost of
US$0.90 per copy, plus the cost of shipping.  This is slightly more than
cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go towards subsidizing the
cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with weaker
economies; TUG itself will not benefit.  If this cost presents a burden
for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.  In any
case, this cost may decrease slightly (depending on how many orders we
receive), but will not increase.

Although we cannot determine exact shipping costs at this time, it will
not exceed US$7.20/pound + $0.58 per box, using the TNT delivery
service.  One pound is (at best) 30 CD's.  We are still hoping to find
cheaper shipping rates.


Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero.  Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year.  Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in reserve.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,
tex-live@tug.org

They need time to debate, discuss, and dither.  (So do we on all the

I suggest the same pricing as last year.

I've added `office' (hi Robin) to the texlive list so all the ensuing

TeX Live 5 is almost ready!  It has a runnable system for major Unix
variants (SGI, Sun, IBM, Compaq, HP), Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows 32
(Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000) systems.  It also has an archive of emTeX
(for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), but no Macintosh version (due to
licensing restrictions). Gnu Ghostscript 5.50 and Gnu Emacs are
included, along with many other useful utilities.

And what will TUG do when eg Walnut Creek offer to sell TeX Live 5 for 
$2, as is?

With this I agree. I think the "cheap TL CD" option is really for
people who *do* know what they are doing, and what they want. eg
people who want to give it to students en masse, etc

of course, the CTAN CDs are almost complete useless unless you are
already considerably knowledgeable about TeX and CTAN :-}

what do you mean by "test"? you mean minimally check it is not a duff
master CD, or actually use it? if the latter, the sooner the
better... we suffer badly from insufficient testing, despite the

     printed in the issue of TUB

?

PLEASE can everyone keep in mind that  that the version of TeX Live
for TUG etc will be _different_ from that made for Addison Wesley, and 
for GUST. The TUG Office, in particular, will need to bear this in
mind if and when they get complaints. They are going to sell and
support TL5c, not 5b (refer to GUST) or 5a (refer to Addison Wesley or 
me).

When shall we start arguing over who is going to work on TeX Live 6 :-}

true.

have you seen a slick commercial TeX like the Mac Textures? it can be
done.

latex sample2e
dvips sample2e -o
windvi sample2e
pdflatex sample2e

but i take the point. a better samples directory

you do not have to stop using it. one of the many many things that
need documenting

a perfectly reasonable aim; it can be achieved, if people put the work 
into the interface. sadly, most of us are too close to TeX...

I have only just managed to get a PC to test the one I downloaded
with.  Brilliant! It has a one-shot install. Problem is, I left the
office to get a cup of coffee while it did its stuff, and when I came
back it had obviously finished, but there is no trace anywhere of any
TeX system having been installed. Where does it put it? I'll have to
do it again and watch it...

Is there some reason for this rather odd choice of directory?
Users will expect c:\Program Files\TeX or (at worst) C:\TeX.

I already had a directory called c:\Local (nothing to do with TeX, and
of course most users probably won't have this :-) so I never saw it...

Is TeX Live going to change the default installation directory every
version?

I can change it if people agree too. The (undocumented) scheme I
intend is :

c:\Local\bin
        \gstools
        \perl
        \TeX

I could have put TeX in "c:\Program Files\", but TeX and many friends
are not exactly windows applications. Even if tex.exe can deal with
spaces in directories names, I'm a bit afraid ofo people trying (or
forgetting) to quote arguments on the command line.

What was the previous one ?

No, I don't have a problem with the concept, just I didn't expect it
to change from the previous C:\TeX (my problem for not following the
discussion more closely). The problem is really only small: the use of
C:\Local is not an established MS-Win practice and just leaves us
exposed to yet more criticism of TeX being non-standard.

I think it's too late to change now anyway; so long as I can document
it, it's OK.

Yes, this is a problem. How does MikTeX solve it?

c:\TeX.

It is not too late. It is really easy to switch it to something
else. I'd just like to have a general agreement on what to do.

> Yes, this is a problem. How does MikTeX solve it?

It installs in c:\texmf by default afaik.
