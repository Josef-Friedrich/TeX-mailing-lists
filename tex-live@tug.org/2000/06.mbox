Right.

There are only two mailings.  One to the well-off user groups, who get
charged US$1 plus shipping, and one to the less-well-off user groups,
who get charged $0.58 and no shipping.


I suggest creating two separate and complete files with the two letters,
including all the BCC's, so you can see exactly what it is.  I hope your

the tug.org machine.

Fwiw, I compiled a new set yesterday, using Red Hat 5.2 /glibc-2.0, for pdftex:

 ldd ~/texlive/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu/pdftex
        libstdc++.so.2.8 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.2.8 (0x40003000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x40044000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4005f000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00000000)

Staszek, if this set solves the problems that you've heard of, it can easily
be uploaded to sun2.dante.de. otherwise, someone else has to look into it...

Binaries were build with glibc-2.1. We have a single linux box
with glibc-2.0, so in principle they could be redone.

Subject: TeX Live 5c available for ordering

TeX Live 5c is almost ready! It has a runnable system for major Unix
variants (SGI, Sun, IBM, Compaq, HP), Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows 32
(Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000) systems. It also has an archive of emTeX
(for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), but no Macintosh version (due to
licensing restrictions). GNU Ghostscript 5.50 and Gnu Emacs are
included, along with many other useful utilities.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 5c, the 2000
release of TeX Live. In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's
heroic efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to
TeX users worldwide.

Great care has been taken to ensure that the TeX Live 5c CD contains only
software without restrictions on usage or redistribution.  Specifically we have
followed the "Debian Free Software Guidelines" 
(http://www.debian.org/intro/free),
and have included license information on the CD-ROM in a file labeled 
LICENSE.TL5.
TeX Live 5c contains full sources for all programs and packages for those who
wish to see how it was put together or experiment with modifications.

The manufacturing date of TL5c will be June/July 2000.  We expect to mail
the CD to you shortly thereafter.  We expect to be able to offer TeX Live
to your user group at a cost of US $1.00 per copy, plus the cost of shipping.
This is slightly more than cost of reproduction; that extra cost will go 
towards
subsidizing the cost of TeX Live for other user groups in countries with 
weaker
economies; TUG itself will not benefit. If this cost presents a burden
for your group, please contact us to acquire the CD at cost.

We cannot determine exact shipping costs until we know the quantity each
group or individual orders. Our research indicates that DHL is very
competitive and specializes in international shipping. On request, the 
office will
provide you with the appropriate bill number so you can track the shipment 
on the
appropriate website.

Finally, your response is requested: please respond to tex-live@tug.org
as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even if that quantity is
zero. Please also inform us if your country requires any special
customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier service, or other
such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year. Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in reserve.

Thanks, and happy TeX'ing,

Here's a look at the final(?) copy.  Any comments?
My only comment is that if Dante doesn't order 2000 (like last year) and 
others decide
to manufacture elsewhere, the cost per copy goes up.  .58 is based on an 
order of 5000-9999 copies.
Last years order = 6500.  Next rate is .69 (2500-4999 copies).  FYI - this 
may not be an issue.
Just thought you should know.

Looks good.  Minor thing -- the line breaks are a little off.  I'd
reformat the individual paragraphs.  Just make sure that they don't end
up on one long line.  (You could try sending it as a test message, just
bcc-ing me and you ...)

    .58 is based on an order of 5000-9999 copies.  Last years order = 6500.
    Next rate is .69 (2500-4999 copies).

We'll just have to see what the response from the lugs is.
Hopefully we'll be able to reasonably order at least 5000 copies.

Dear Mr. Schaa,

We have completed the final edit of two letters to be sent to various lugs 
(copied below),
which I had hoped to mail today.   After reading the message (directly 
below) from Sebastian
I am sufficiently confused and wonder how we might coordinate this 
effort?  Are you sending
a letter to the lugs as well?  How many CD's are you thinking of ordering 
and at what cost?
Would you like to handle the entire copy process and send CD's to TUG as 
Sebastian suggests?
I am happy to work with you however you advise, but know there is a 
pressing concern to get
the word out to lugs, thus receiving order information so that we may 
proceed in whatever
method seems the most logical.
At this point I guess I will standby until I hear otherwise?
Thank-you.
Sincerely,
Robin Laakso
TUG Office Manager

dear Robin,
I replied to your mail "TeXLive5 Order" on May, 15th with

I hope you got this mail?!

  In the meantime the dollar has come down a bit :), so the
price wouldn't be such a problem, but as I learned from our
editor, the next issue of 'Die TeXnische Komoedie' is due.
And we have to send out the TL5 CD with issue 2/2000 (3/2000
gets the 3 CTAN-CDs in a digi file cover and will be sent out
in September -- that's too late and postage is too expensive
putting an additional CD in).
  We are now considering to press just the needed 2100 (-/+ 100)
copies for us.

  In general it would be possible to press *all* TL5 CDs in Europe
(might be even cheeper for all $-countries) and ship them to the LUGs,
but the schedule for us is quite tight. And collecting orders takes
its time... and at the moment we are not prepared to ship loads of
CDs somewhere due to the holiday season starting last week in June
(and there will be nobody in the DANTE bureau). So I have no idea
how to prevent pressing two different sets. Do you??

  Sebastian's idea about saving money by reusing the glass masters
is (nearly) impossible as I was told, because they seldom fit in other
machines. And, I won't get the glass master. I asked three companies
here and they refused to give them away. And they told me, if you
order 3000 CDs or more the glass master is always free of charge.

This may be the most relevant point. If there is no serious cost
reduction between, say, 3000 copies and 1000 copies, the two 
separate pressings do not matter. So we might as well just do that.

Volker, I hope you can wait a week? I am expecting the exercises from
Kopka and Daly to be put on the CD, which your members might find useful.[1]

I'll plan on sending the letter to the LUG's this afternoon unless I hear 
otherwise today.
Sounds like two pressings is the way to go this year.  I'll be in touch 
about the artwork, Art.
Thanks for the help,

TeX Live 5c is almost ready! It has a runnable system for major Unix variants
(SGI, Sun, IBM, Compaq, HP), Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows 32
(Windows NT, 95, 98, 2000) systems. It also has an archive of emTeX
(for Windows 3.1 or OS/2 users), but no Macintosh version (due to licensing
restrictions). GNU Ghostscript 5.50 and Gnu Emacs are included, along with
many other useful utilities.

The TeX Users Group has arranged with Sebastian Rahtz, the editor of the
TeX Live CD-ROM, to act as the distributor of TeX Live 5c, the 2000
release of TeX Live. In doing so, TUG aims to support Sebastian's heroic
efforts in creating this CD and to provide it at nominal cost to TeX
users worldwide.

Great care has been taken to ensure that the TeX Live 5c CD contains
only software without restrictions on usage or redistribution.
Specifically all of TeX Live is compliant with the "Debian Free Software
Guidelines" (http://www.debian.org/intro/free), to the best of our
knowledge. License information is on the CD-ROM in the file LICENSE.TL5.
TeX Live 5c contains full sources for all programs and packages for
those who wish to see how it was put together or experiment with
modifications.

The manufacturing date of TL5c will be June/July 2000. We expect to
mail the CD to you shortly thereafter. We expect to be able to offer
TeX Live to your user group at a cost of US $1.00 per copy, plus the
cost of shipping. This is slightly more than cost of reproduction; that
extra cost will go towards subsidizing the cost of TeX Live for other
user groups in countries with weaker economies; TUG itself will not
benefit. If this cost presents a burden for your group, please contact
us to acquire the CD at cost.

We cannot determine exact shipping costs until we know the quantity each
group or individual orders. Our research indicates that DHL is very
competitive and specializes in international shipping. On request, the
office will provide you with the appropriate bill number so you can
track the shipment on the appropriate website.

Finally and most importantly, your response is requested: please respond
to tex-live@tug.org as soon as possible with your desired quantity, even
if that quantity is zero. Please also inform us if your country requires
any special customs arrangements, if you have a preferred courier
service, or other such shipping arrangements.

TUG may be able to fulfill repeat orders if you run out, but please
don't count on this: order as many as you think you will need for the
entire year. Unfortunately we can't afford to hold a large stock in
reserve.

Ghostscript should have been 6.01 which came out before the burning

Ghostscript 6.01 is not available under the Debian license that we
want to stick to. If we had GS6, no-one would be able to put the CD in
the back of a book, or sell it. Believe we, this has been argued about
a lot!

Emacs has an excellent GUI and is stable. I am also constrained by the
noisy Richard Stallman :-}

I presume you are collating the orders, Robin?

Hello!

need to account for all user groups.
Also, I sent a TL5 order query to a few groups several weeks ago for budget 
purposes to which many thankfully replied.  Just to make sure I have 
everyone accounted for, please respond a second time per the recent 
"official" letter sent last week.
Thank-you to those who have responded already.  I look forward to receiving 
order information from everyone else.

This is missing rom the documentation, but there should be (on the
TL5c final version) a redistribuable component from Microsoft that
will install this dll on systems where it is lacking.
Run setupw32\wintdist.exe, follow the instructions and then you will
be able to autorun the CD.

Sebastian, can you add this information to the texlive5 web pages ?

Hmm... I have no wintdist.exe, but 50ComUpd.exe on my CD. This
contains some "Common updates", but not the missing DLL. May be, I
have a too early version? (The README is from march 2000)

I think this was just a mistake in texlive4. it is present in texlive

Message-ID: <200006281003.MAA10332@zikova.cvut.cz>

dear developers,

 First I would like to thank you for a great job, TeX-LIVE is really an 
excellent package!

But I think I've found two small bugs.

This applies to TeX-LIVE 5, image texlive-20000602, Win32 port:

 1) if I install the distribution to the directory, whose name contains 
space(s) (e.g. "C:\Program Files\TeX"), distribution does not work 
properly. E.g. typing "kpsewhich latex.fmt" does not report any occurence 
of such a file. If I use MS-DOS equivalent name (e.g. "C:\Progra~1\TeX"), 
it works OK.

You may consider to warn user not to use path with spaces during setup, or 
convert user's path to MS-DOS equivalent name (using Win32 API function 
GetShortPathName), or just make a small note in the manual (maybe it is 
already there ? ;-)

 2) some batch files in $(TEX)\bin\win32 (e.g. amstex.bat) use UNIX line 
breaks (line feeds only). This is OK under NTs, but 98s (and maybe 95s too) 
cannot run such batchfiles. If I fix these files manually, they work OK.


 with best regards,

  Michal Sevcenko

I thought that this was documented somewhere? its a well-known problem

Subject: Fixing TeX_Live n post facto
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.962201835.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

Preparation of TeX_Live-n CD ROM releases is a huge job, for which we
all owe a very large debt of gratitude to all of the folks who
contributed to making it work.

Inevitably, however, there will be a few problems that only get
discovered after thousands of CDs are distributed.

This suggests that it could be helpful to maintain at TeX archive
sites (CTAN, plus {ftp,www}.tug.org, plus other TeX User Group sites)
a mirrored tree that contains updates to each official TeX_Live-n CD.
These should not be
	updates-because-we-have-a-new-improved-version,
but only
	updates-because-the-CD-ROM-file-really-does-have-an-installation-problem.

Are there plans to do something like this?  Such a tree would be quite
small, and easily downloaded via FTP, HTTP, or encoded in an email
message.

well, we do have the bugs page, which has links to files which have
vital changes.  that would easily be also on CTAN.

the real problem, to my mind, is explaining to people *how* to patch
their setups. replacing a duff mpost.exe with a correct one is OK, but
saying "this file that was in texmf/source was really needed in
texmf/tex" is harder

my priority is to get the bugs page right, of course; lets see how
full that gets over the next 6 months.

I don't remember where it's documented (although I warn against it in
our local install docs for TL4). I raised this last year, I think FP
wanted to know how MikTeX gets around this, which it does) but I don't
think anyone found an answer.

What is important for the user is (a) NEVER install fpTeX into a
directory containing spaces in the name, and (b) NEVER save document
files into such directories either, as they will not be processable
from within (eg) WinEdt.

Spaces in file/dir names are evil anyway, they make your teeth fall
out and cause premature baldness, senile decay, and they perpetuate
the disease by creating an uncontrollable desire to include spaces in
every file and directory name on the system.

It's getting harder to catch these things now that Emacs and PFE both
silently elide the differences...

Where is the final final ISO image now? I'd like to start rewriting
the local install docs...

Yes indeed. I don't know how they get more than 24 hours out of each
day to do this. It's an incredibly hard task very well performed.

If it's worth anything, I aim to update my local doc on how to
install TL{4,5} which is currently at
ftp://ftp.ucc.ie/pub/tex/texlive4.{pdf,ps}.gz

This is a painfully detailed mouseclick-by-mouseclick guide which the
seasoned user will rightly ignore, but which has solved our
install-support problem so we don't have to visit every user's lab or
office.

Similarly to what you suggest (as-is, not as-updated) this will
therefore obviously be a snapshot to parallel the distributed CD-ROM,
not an evolving document (except in the sense that I would redo it for
TL6, TL7, etc).

I am de-UCC'ing it for TL5 so it becomes a generic public document
which I would probably send out with any of our (ITALIC) copies of 
the CD-ROM. Or upload to CTAN if anyone thinks it worthwhile.

I have written somewhere that 'even if TeX and friends can process
files such that their pathname contain spaces -- not the file name,
but the directory name -- it is unwise to install in such a directory
because not all of the tools have been tested against this'.

Now, I'll do my best to check under Win95. Once again, this is ok
under NT/2000, at least last time I checked.

Yes, you can starting with TL5. Except that I won't say anything about
Win9x and tools other than the various engines.

This one has been reported and fixed.

There was definitely a bug in kpathsea preventing this to work under
W9x. I still need to test against it in case there are other traps. 

But let me explain my intended layout :

D:\marc>dir d:\Local
 Volume in drive D has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is ECE6-7035

 Directory of d:\Local

20/06/2000  10:38       <DIR>          .
20/06/2000  10:38       <DIR>          ..
01/05/2000  16:46       <DIR>          Gnu
13/04/2000  10:02       <DIR>          GsTools
13/04/2000  09:58       <DIR>          ImageMagick
13/04/2000  09:58       <DIR>          Mayura
31/05/2000  13:40       <DIR>          NetPBM
10/04/2000  11:05       <DIR>          NTEmacs
01/05/2000  16:32       <DIR>          Perl
20/06/2000  10:38       <DIR>          Tcl
29/06/2000  10:40       <DIR>          TeXLive
24/08/1999  01:20       <DIR>          WinCvs
25/05/2000  10:16       <DIR>          XEmacs

Everything is in d:\Local because none of these apps are 'true'
windows app, even if some do behave quite well.

So, now imagine all this stuff mixed inside this one :

 Directory of c:\program files

21/06/2000  23:23       <DIR>          .
21/06/2000  23:23       <DIR>          ..

21/06/2000  23:23       <DIR>          XML Notepad

I wonder if it is a good idea. You can notice that most of the directories in
d:\Local need to be cited in your PATH, but none of "c:\Program Files".

Any opinions ?

Subject: TeXlive 5 and kluwer.cls
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.962303592.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

A colleague just reported to me a difference between the kluwer.cls
file that he just downloaded from the publisher's Web site, and the
version installed on our TeX tree.

I did a locate on all instances of that file in our system, and found
these versions:

-r--r--r--   1 mirror    4668 Feb 11  1998 ...tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/kluwer/kluwer.cls

-r--r--r--   1 beebe     4576 May 30  1997 ...latex2e.old/contrib/supported/kluwer/kluwer.cls

-rw-rw-r--   1 beebe     4668 Feb 11  1998 latex2e/contrib/supported/kluwer/kluwer.cls

The current version looks like this:

-rw-r--r--   1 bluser   97215 Apr 29 08:19 kluwer.cls

Could someone please check whether this is in the TeXLive-5 tree, and
if so, make sure that the latest version of it, and related files, are
put there BEFORE the CDs are mastered (if that hasn't happened yet).
The much larger file says version 1.3; the others are 1.1.

I'll update our copy

but if Kluwer dont keep CTAN up to date, there is not much we can to
track their work
