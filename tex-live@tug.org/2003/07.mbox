Subject: [tex-live] what book is Books/ltt.tgz?
Message-ID: <200307011935.h61JZgd21633@tug.org>

I created ./Master/Books/README with a reference to each of the books
that has stuff in Books.  However, I couldn't figure out what book `ltt'
referred to.  Maybe someone knows, or can someone who reads German help?
I'll append the buch.tex file from the tarball.

I poked around on google etc., but couldn't find anything definitive.

If anyone notices other discrepancies in Books/README, let me know.

Thanks,
karl

1 - Please note that the texlive cd is only usable/installable on macc 
which run macosX.
On older systems, the Joliet extension will permit to *see* the content 
of the cd (and to copy it on the hard disk), but not to use/install the 
cd. As nearly all the stuff on the cd is now zipped, I think it is 
better to say

"Older mac systems (up to MacOS 9.x included): texlive is *not* usable 
on these systems, sorry ! If you want to *see* the content of the cd 
you need to install a System Extension which lets the Mac see the 
Joliet extended filesystem
on this CD. You can get this from http://www.tempel.org/joliet.  (We 
cannot include it in the distribution since it is not free software.)"

2 - Foreign stuff on the cd:
- Gerben's i-installer (MacOSX/tex-thin.dmg): it have been updated (and 
probably renamed). Best to replace this old version by the last one 
II2.dmg which can be found here
http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

- iTeXmac (Jer?me Laurens): MacOSX/iTM-1.1.1.dmg should be replace by 
the lates version which can be found here
http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/

- TeXShop (Richard Koch): MacOSX/texshop.dmg should be replaced by the 
latest version which can be found here
http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html
Note that a new release will come soon.

Message-ID: <200307062243.h66MhXV09428@f7.net>

    Will TL8 be also available as CD isos or only as DVD iso. 

I had the impression that an ISO is an ISO, and if the ISO is small
enough, it can be burned on CD.  The scripts just run mkisofs (with a
zillion options).

    I still don't have a dvd burner, so I'll like to know.

We intend to make three distributions of TeX Live in 2003:

1) `demo' - fits on cd, can be run live (or installed), missing a few packages.
2) `inst' - fits on cd, must be installed to disk (cannot be run live),
   complete.
3) `live' - must have dvd (does not fit on cd), can be run live (or
   installed), complete.

So the answer is that dvd will not be required for TeX Live 2003.

Thanks,
k

Thanks for the info.

    texlive is *not* usable on these systems, sorry ! 

Do the Mac binaries work on pre-MacOSX?  If so, then it's potentially
useful (e.g., by copying files by hand), even if the normal installation
does not work.  If not, then clearly TL is pretty much useless on those
systems.

    2 - Foreign stuff on the cd:

Please, can you, or Gerben, or someone Macish update the necessary
files?  I don't feel like I should do it since I have no way of knowing
if it really works, if more files are needed, etc.

You are right ! Unfortunately I don't know how I can update the disk 
images. If Gerben have no time to do it and if somebody could explain 
me the good way, I'll do it.

the only description of what it means can be found in the German
TL7 doc. ttl stands for "LaTeX, Tricks und Tipps" by Ingo Kl?ckl,
dpunkt Verlag, there is now a second edition (2002). See

The TL doc introduction mentions a file texmf/doc/pdftex/samplepdf.tex
showing `all features of pdftex'.  This file no longer exists on CTAN
(the whole systems/pdftex has been moved to obsolete/systems/pdftex
since its original source was no longer being maintained), nor in TeX
Live.  http://tug.org/applications/pdftex/ doesn't mention it either.

Any advice from the pdftex folks out there?

(And perhaps we could establish some new authoritative ftp site so
pdftex can be mirrored onto ctan again?)

Hello!

What about omega  support in TL8?
Will antomega package be included?

I had problems (missing fd or something like
that) installing antomega in TL7.
Hope they will be fixed in TL8.

In fact, I _need_ omega and antomega
by 1 September 2003. :)
Antomega is the _only_ package with
Latvian language support. Thanks to
Alexey Kryukov. I have _no right_ to

Hi,
pdftex would need access to functions for computing an md5sum.

The texlive repository has them at three places:
- TeX/libs/md5
  openssl md5 code
  Where is this used?
- TeX/libs/libwww/
  original RSA code
- TeX/texk/dvipdfmx/crypto/
  openssl md5 code

I'd like for pdfTeX to incorporate the libmd5-rfc
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc/). 
Where shall I put it?

Best regards
        Martin

Hmmm  ... possibly  useless.   I looked for an   md5  lib when  I  added
dvipdfmx, and I guess that was one of my  attempts. I ended up by taking
out the few   files  needed  out  of   openssl and putting  them   under
texk/dvipdmfx/crypto.

I removed libs/md5.

So maybe Martin could install the new libmd5-rfc again into
libs/md5? Seems to be an appropriate place for a generic
library. FWIW, libwww will eventually disappear since only
xdvik was using it, and won't in the new version.

By the way, it seems the pdftex version for MacOSX is still out of
date (v1.10a). This is a problem at least because of an incompatible
pool file (1.10a v 1.10b). Is Gerben listening ?

For "Gerben's TeX" read TeX Live / teTeX because I use the standard

Is that a strategy used more? Because IMO it would be better to include 
OpenSSL (like it is done with other support stuff like ncurses) so it 
can be updated simply if necessary. OTOH MD5 is pretty stable, so for 
this item it is not a big deal.

Yes.

My pdftex is

pdfTeX (Web2C 7.4.5) 3.14159-1.10b

and that is what I currently distribute through the i-Installer  
mechanism. Sebastian normally takes stuff directly from my distribution  
so if the binaries in the distribution are still out of date, this is  
easy to fix.

At all times, the binaries (+ support like include, lib, etc) I compile  
and distribute are in

ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/i-packages/texbinaries.ii2/ 
texbinaries.tar.bz2

I regularly update from TeX Live source and update, and I also do it  
when Sebastian asks it from me.

"To be or not to be, that is the question" -- Parmenides

PS. I would still like for teTeX and TeX Live to use the same main  
texmf structur, so either both with or both without the share  
subdirectory. The reason is that it then becomes possible for TeX Live  
(CD) users to update their TeX Live installation with the i-Packages I  
diustribute and which are updated on a more regular basis.

PPS. IMO it would be nice to have a basic texmf structure also in TeX  
Live like this (makes it easier to manage subdistributions etc):

.../bin
.../share/texmf.local
.../share/texmf
.../share/texmf.texlive
.../share/texmf.tetex
.../share/texmf.foo
.../share/texmf.bar

etc. (I prefer the (share) subdir because it so clearly separates the  
texmf stuff from the rest).

in .../texmf.cnf one then sets which tree is the main tree, which is  
the var tree etc. My version looks like this:

% Our directory setup as explained in $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/README.gwtex
% TEXMFMAIN contains the TEXMF tree installed by make install of the  
programs
TEXMFMAIN = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf
% TEXMFTE contains the main TEXMF tree from teTeX
TEXMFTE = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.tetex
% TEXMFGW contains GW specific defaults and additions
TEXMFGW = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.gwtex
% TEXMFLOCAL contains any local system TeXadmin overrides
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.local
% $VARTEXMF is where texconfig writes its local settings
VARTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL
% User texmf trees can be catered for like this...
HOMETEXMF = $HOME/Library/texmf

% Our complete search path, the last three are searched through
% ls-R exclusively, which means that you have to run texhash
% after you have added, moved or deleted files in the tree
TEXMF={$HOMETEXMF,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFGW,!!$TEXMFTE,!!$TEXMFMAIN}

% If you want to disable the HOME trees, use this:
% TEXMF=!!{$TEXMFLOCAL,$TEXMFGW,$TEXMFTE,$TEXMFMAIN}

% The system trees.  These are the trees that are shared by all the  
users.
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFGW;$TEXMFTE;$TEXMFMAIN

% Where generated fonts may be written.  This tree is used when the  
sources
% were found in a system tree and either that tree wasn't writable, or  
the
% varfonts feature was enabled in MT_FEATURES in mktex.cnf.
VARTEXFONTS = /var/tmp/texfonts

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
% This is default set to TEXMF+VARTEXFONTS but without HOMETEXMF
TEXMFDBS = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFGW;$TEXMFTE;$TEXMFMAIN;$VARTEXFONTS

The format file has both "american" and "british" patterns loaded. Without
babel, the pattern for "american" are used. With the above babel line,
the "english" patterns are used and "english" is an alias for either
"american" or "british" depending on language.dat.

In this case, "english" is an alias for "british" which explains the
difference.

Try this test document. It shows that \language is set to "1" by the
options english and british and to 0 by the option american (which
is also the default if no babel is used):

  \documentclass{minimal}
  \usepackage[american,british,english]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  \makeatletter
  \scrollmode
  \selectlanguage{english}  \showthe\language \showhyphens{mechanism}
  \selectlanguage{american} \showthe\language \showhyphens{mechanism}
  \selectlanguage{british}  \showthe\language \showhyphens{mechanism}
  \end{document}

> >- if the Babel package is not used, all patterns are used

No, if babel is not loaded and \language is not changed, the patterns for
\language0 are used (which are in your case the american patterns).

> >- if the Babel package is used, it selects the one hyphenation pattern  
> >used.

In TeX, hyphenation for a paragraph is done depending on the value of
\language which is active at the end of a paragraph. babel gives you a
way to manipulate \language without having to know the precise numbers
of the language to use. Your confusion comes from the fact that "english"
is defined as an alias for british.

For not breaking compatibility with documents that don't load babel,
\language0 should use Knuth's patterns (i.e. the american ones). If your
hyphenation should be compatible with other people's who don't use babel,
you should stop using the alias "english" and use "american" instead.

web2c's texk/kpathsea/texmf.in has
  TEXMFLOCAL = @texmf@-local
  %   VARTEXMF = @texmf@-var
  TEXMFCNF = {$SELFAUTOLOC,$SELFAUTODIR,$SELFAUTOPARENT}{,{/share,}/texmf{-local,}/web2c};$TETEXDIR;$TEXMF/web2c;@web2c@
so I suggest to use a hyphen as a separator instead of the dot.

That way, a local admin can benefit from .../share/texmf-local/web2c
being searched for a texmf.cnf file, so that place can be used to override
other settings.

Well, only 3 or  4 files were needed out   of a big tarball. Openssl  is
large, and the programs   are not related  to  TeX. Moreover, I  need to
_port_  them to win32,  which means  writing  makefiles and patching the
code from place to place.

I suggest not including OpenSSL; the license has a very obnoxious
advertising clause.

I have checked in a substantial revision of the TeX Live documentation
to the TL perforce repository.  I added sections on testing, getting
help, and MacOSX, and revised almost everything -- except the Windows
chapter, where I merely tinkered with formatting and such.  I hope
someone else can do a real update of it.  For one thing, the figures
still refer to TeX Live 7.

Except for that (the Windows figures/updates), I think the other changes
for this year's version are done, although of course a multitude of
potential improvements remain.

I'd appreciate any bug reports, suggestions, or
how-could-you-be-so-stupid remarks :).  I've been staring at the text so
long I've got blinders on at this point.

For anyone who does not have a checked-out perforce tree, you can see
the new doc (pdf, html, source) at http://tug.org/~karl/tldoc.


Two questions about the HTML generation with tex4ht:

1) \textsf{texconfig} results in texcon\oslash g in HTML (I mean the
actual character `ø', not \, o, s, etc.).  You can see this in the
title and contents of section 4.1.  Any ideas?

2) The HTML output uses gif files for various things.  Any possibility
   of using jpg or png instead?

Thanks,

You need to put it in the options :

\Preamble{2,xhtml,png}   \begin{document}   \EndPreamble

and possibly make sure your tex4ht.env generates png instead of gif
files. But Eitan could probably say more about this ;-)

The 'fi' has been picked up as a ligature, but the font used for \sf
probably doesn't support this, or has the composite character in a
wrong place for fonts used to show \sf style.

In fact, there is no such ligature support in the latin-1 encoding plane
of characters that are usually used with HTML.
So it could be that the HTML has an interesting character code which
your browser doesn't understand, and chooses to display an oslash.

If this was happening in a TeX/LaTeX document (for .dvi or .pdf output)
I would say that the argument 'texconfig' had been tokenised, before
it was known that the ligature would be unavailable with \sf .
Therefore, you would need to do something like:

{\sffamily
 \gdef\sftexconfig{texconfig}
}

and use this as: e.g.
     \subsection*{\sftexconfig}


But I don't know how TeX4ht works with ligatures:
 at which point does it decide what is destined for HTML output,
 and in what character encoding ?

Certainly I've faced similar questions with LaTeX2HTML, where the
expansion-order is quite different to that in TeX, for these and
other reasons.


Hope this helps,

Hi friends!

Another bunch of comments, this time on install-tl.sh:

       [ ] create symlinks in standard directories
       [ ] do not install macro/font doc tree
       [X] do not install macro/font source tree
pressing `O' I cannot select "do not install macro/font doc tree", if I
press `S' in the next menu I only get "do not install macro/font source
tree".

- running install:
install-tl.sh: line 948: /mnt/tpm/lists/lib-expat: file or directory not found

lots of: .caution: excluded filename not matched:  texmf/source\*

at the end there is *NO* bin directory, nothing executable!

then there are in INSTPATH/texmf-local/*...*/local directories with

I can confirm that. And even macro/font source tree is selected for not 
installing, some source/ files *are* installed.
BTW. I'd suggest to deselect it by default in install scripts.
As for "demo CD", all files from texmf/source/ tree are gziped,
so if anybody tries to install files (why not? it works well), she/he
has many annoying warnings.

some .tpm and lists files are broken now (e.g. fontinst)

It seems that install-tl.sh (a copy of install-compr.sh from p4 depot)
still try to find binaries in bin/ not in tpm/binary/

I'm also not so sure if it is really needed ;-) And many asked me
why we have empty texmf-local structure installed by default.
Who knows?

Having quite the same troubles as Norbert, I've slightly modified
MakeImages.sh (#3352), e.g, for $makedemo section:
tpm/scheme/* copied (win setup needs that)
removing texlive-full.tpm and lists/texlive-full.scheme
to prevent selecting it when someone runs installation programs.

As for "demo CD" we have to consider the main problem: there are no
specific stuff for windows on that CD (xemtex etc.). Fabrice told me that
it is runable directly from the CD, but we have no place. Anyway, without
TeX editor and gs, demo cd is hardly usable for windows users. 

So again the question: what to zap for "demo"? The main candidate is
cm-super (of course, still available on DVD and installable from cd-inst).
I'll have lm fonts with full support for ec+tc today or tomorrow, so for
most it would be good alternative. 
Any opinions?

The bad thing a propos "demo CD" is that it doesn't provide lib-geturl,
(tl80geturl.dll) so even tex cannot run on windows :-(
Having dependancy in bin-kpathsea.tpm doesn't cure it, since the layout
is made according to the contents of lists/* files where all those
<TPM:Required> are ignored. Will check more...

I don't see why. you can use any editor, and use pdftex instead of
tex...

if it was doable, I'd suggest that a demo CD should have no MF, no
dvips, no windvi, no TeX, no Omega etc etc. Just the "pdfetex" binary.
otherwise we simply provide a time capsule demo of what life was like in
the 1980s...

the big packages are as follows:

9236    koma-script
9368    musixtex
10592   ltxbase
13432   catalogue
14912   tex4htk
17252   cjk
18632   context
21068   texlive-source
69820   cm-super
87568   cb

I suggest that musixtex should certainly go, probably along with the
sadly bloated "cb"

I have fixed this, the images are rebuilding now. I am afraid it was
caused by Staszek being over enthusiastic in rewriting the script :-}
anyway I have rewritten the install script to work in a different way.

sort of. It was looking in bin to get a seed list of binary sets
available. you had zapped all those :-}

On unix at least (or any system that supports fifo) you can compile  
this in. It means that the DVI output is written to a file and the  
display system can get signals through the pipe every time a new page  
is ready. It can start displaying before the file is completely typeset.

This would be difficult with pdf: You would need an adapted pdf
viewer and pdfTeX would need to write linearized pdf.

I prominently mention and recommend texmf-local in the revised
documentation.

Having an empty tree for it means that users or tools don't have to
create directories, and can more easily see where to put files.

So I think it's a help, and I don't see that it causes any harm?

    Demo CD is for demonstration purposes only, isn't it? 

And for running live off CD.  (As opposed to DVD.)  So it will be nice
to include as much as possible.

    If something must go, I rather agree with Sebastian's suggestion
    (musixtex and cb).

I agree too, assuming that's enough to get things to fit.

BTW, when it's finalized, the documentation will have to be updated,
since I state in there now that -CJK is the only difference.  (I wish I
could autogenerate the difference, but turning the diff of live.scheme
and full.scheme into usable text defeated me.)

We could have meaningful diffs if schemes/*.tpm files used the same line 
breaking mechanism (preferably unix way, like in the current live.scheme).

And for many it can be also installable... as it works well on U*x and 
Win. Agrred to zap cb and musixtex

I'll upload that to CTAN at the same time as to p4 depot.

No, it is still here. At least 30min ago (= 8:30pm, 16.7.2003) I made a

If we remove cb from "demo CD", we have to remove also tex-langgreek
collection :-( 
On the other hand, removing cm-super means tex-psfonts collection
to zap. What to do? Any idea?

Hi friends!


Here a list of problems I came across:

Build source.development:
=========================

well, omegafonts do not build.


==================================================================

MakeImages:

bash MakeImages.sh --nodemo --nolive --work=/usr/local/norb --target=/usr/local/norb 


Still various tpm errors. Here an excerpt from the lines:
!!!Error: non-existent texmf/dvips/allrunes/allrunes.map
	and many more concerning allrunes

In total not so bad.

If someone wants the full list I can sent it.

---------------------------------------------

The problem is the call to install-live.sh at the end, where
S
E
...
is feed into it. The problem is that there are WRONG answers to the
systems question: There are not enough Y or N and *no* R for returning
to the main menu. What systems should there be installed? If you tell me
I will fix the MakeImages.sh script.


====================================================================0

install-tl.sh from the above iso image:

Looks good, but again:

caution: excluded filename not matched:  texmf/source\*

This comes from 
	filters="$filters texmf/source\*"
which is used in
	unzip -o -qq $CDDIR/tpm/package/$f -x $filters
no idea what unzip should say here. Maybe this is in any case ok, since
there are *no* source files and zip just mentions this.


Still there is the other error I send in another email (sorry) about not 
possible to deselect source/doc.

Here is a patch that fixes this:
--- common.sh.orig      2003-07-16 21:55:07.000000000 +0200

So it looks really much better now!

Remove less important packages: musictex,
omega (although it is necessary for me),
context. Maybe it's only me, but I don't
know any person who use context or musictex.

Almost everybody use cm-super.
A whole country (Greece) uses tex-langgreek.

I know more people who use ConTeXt than I know greeks :-}

debateable. I suspect many who do would be better off using lm now. I
certainly intend to, for the rare work I do using CM.

why do they need 90 megabytes of fonts for a simple language like
greek....

Message-ID: <1058441609.24440.43.camel@spqr-dell>

I have corrected the scripts which build ISO images, and the install
script, hopefully fixing all the problems Norbert found.

I have also killed the collection tex-psfonts and created a new
tex-fontsrecommended. From the old tex-psfonts I have moved cm-super and
a few others to tex-fontsextra, and the latter is excluded from the demo
CD.

With these changes, the difference between the demo version and the full
version is that the collections
 tex-fontsextra
 tex-music
 tex-langcjk
are excluded.

according to my test, this gives a demo CD of 620 megabytes, and the
source tree is _not_ compressed any more.

I suggest that interested parties review tex-fontsextra and decide
whether anything there is really of widespread interest. If so, move it
back to tex-fontsrecommended. If there is no interest in any of them
moving, we can reinstate the music collection.

This *does* mean that cm-super is excluded. My own view is that the new
lmfont setup should be widely publicized, and people should be
encouraged to switch to it.

Message-ID: <1058445689.24439.119.camel@spqr-dell>

I think the situation for the release of TeXLive 2003 as follows:

 1. delivery and installation: stable. needs more testing, but should be
feature- and interface-frozen

 2. documentation: updated in English only, and needs user-testing.
Karl, you really need to put your name on it in place of mine, if you
are to be the primary maintainer. 

 3. texmf tree: stable, but waiting for LaTeX release. no major packages
waiting to be updated that I know of

 4. binary tree: stable for 12 architectures, but not at the release we
want. ideally we want a complete round of recompilations very soon, 
as soon as Martin releases pdftex, using what is now source.development.
but that remains contentious?

 5. source: as binary


Does this sound right? what bothers me is the binary version. I'd really
get to get a clean new source recompiled everywhere, but it is not right
at the moment, since at least two of us cannot compile cleanly even
under Linux. 

Sebastian

Nor could I under Solaris, today (compilation was done in source/). 
The error looks weird (I haven't yet had time to look into it):

 srcdir=. /bin/sh ./web2c/convert tangleboot
 ',rse error: Last token = 288 ( ), error buffer = `
         last id = `optiontable' (variable).
 ./web2c/convert: conversion of tangleboot.p failed, moving dregs:
 ./web2c/convert:   mv tangleboot.c tangleboot.h /tmp
 make[4]: *** [tangleboot.c] Error 1

The time-frame for TeX Live 8/2003 has been early August - which is
two or so weeks from now. So it's about time to start compilations?

I just fixed two flex-related problems. thanks to Thomas for pointing me

flex 2.5.31 breaks POSIX compatibility. The problem will be fixed. Until
then, I recommend that flex 2.5.4 is used instead of 2.5.31.

Another possible work-around is to patch the Makefile and add -l:
  LEX = flex -l

I think we have a feature freeze and the only changes will be
cosmetic (and improving the build).

By the way, a clean build of source.development should now create 240
entries in the bin directory, of which 55 are symlinks.

Anyone feel like a quick hack of integrate dvipng into the TeX Live
tree?

That can't be the only criteria though.  A lot more than *one* country
uses cjk.

Package size has to be an important factor, for practical reasons.
I think even the Greeks would rather have one package missing than a
couple dozen smaller ones.

Anyway, I guess our fearless & peerless leader has solved this one ...

Unknown.  Volker is going to check with Frank one more time and see if
he has any more firm date -- if it's not going to be in the next couple
weeks, we can't wait for it.  I think it's unlikely that it will happen,
have to be next year.

Well, I was hoping that I wouldn't have to be the primary maintainer
*forever* :).  I did go around changing everything that said
sebastian.rahtz@... to tex-live@tug.org, at least ...

   4. binary tree: stable for 12 architectures, 

The number of binaries for the different architectures varies quite a bit.

I just talked to Frank, and he told me that
  a) till end of August there will be a beta version,
  b) a stable, tested version can be out by mid September.

 From the production side (TeXCollection: TeXLive and CTAN
by Lehmanns) that's not a real problem. But I do not know
which promises have been given by user groups...

Cheers, Volker

This worked.

I cd to the omfonts directory and called 
	flex -l ./pl.l
which fixed the problem for omfonts.

Then I got a similar error in detex:

I think we have to start producing .iso files for people to use, Pearson
in Germany are waiting patiently, for instance, and Addison Wesley USA.
I don't think it is right to wait until the end of September (which is
what it would be)

I don't like it very much, but to help automatic builds of TeX Live,
I have added
  test "x$LEX" = xflex && LEX='flex -l'
to texk/web2c/configure.in.

This means, that flex will be replaced by "flex -l". This does work with
new amd old versions of flex and should not affect any version of lex.

Message-ID: <20030717190921.GA6125@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Installed the new source.development build and texhash sends out strange
stuff:

[~] texhash

In the texhash file I found this:
    # Use same permissions as parent directory, minus x,s, or t bits.
    chmod `kpsestat -xst "$db_dir"` "$db_file"
  elif test "x`sed '1s/

It seems that the sed '1s/

is incorrect. But maybe I am wrong with this.

You are not wrong.

    $ p4 changes mktexlsr
    Change 3206 on 2003/06/23 by rahtz@spqr-dell 'lets dump some more ^Ms '
    ...

I think that mktexlsr *intentionally* had some ^M characters in it...
That cleanup has broken this script.

tex/latex/ly1/ly1enc.def has:
  \DeclareErrorFont{LY1}{ptm}{m}{n}{10}
  \DeclareFontSubstitution{LY1}{ptm}{m}{n}

That's why ly1ptm is loaded. That file, however, looks very outdated to me.
teTeX's version loads ptmr8y, not tir ...

The reason was the old existing pdfjadetex.efmt it seems. One of teh 
flags made pdfeTeX try to load the format it was supposed to be 
creating?

Removing pdfjadetex.efmt and rerunning created the format fine. This 
seems to be a problem. After all, when I am going to *create* the 
format, I do not want to be blocked by the existing non-compatible 
format. Weird though, because it did not happen with jadetex, only with 
pdfjadetex.

Compilation in source.development (as of Jul 17, 15:42 :-) was fine,
both under Solaris 8 and Irix 6.5 (240 programs, incl. 55 symlinks,
each)! I submitted Irix binaries.

My simplistic approach is to use what is now in source.development, for
good or bad.

Well, if some format is based on latex.efmt, there might be an implicit
invocation of mktexfmt which has to write to stderr (because stdout is
used for interaction with the calling program).

Maybe, this can be solved by rearranging the order of lines in
fmtutil.cnf?

Subject: [tex-live] status report on TL? (LaTeX release)
Message-ID: <200307190022.h6J0MXf25657@f7.net>

      a) till end of August there will be a beta version,
      b) a stable, tested version can be out by mid September.

     From the production side (TeXCollection: TeXLive and CTAN
    by Lehmanns) that's not a real problem. But I do not know
    which promises have been given by user groups...

Well, TUG has not made an absolute promise to its members, although we
have said all along that we expected to ship late July/early August,
since that's what we've discussed here.  But that's not the main issue
in my mind.

The main issue to me is that it's only mid-July now.  Mid-September is
two months away, the beta isn't out yet (is it?), and it all seems like
a lot of potential for slippage.  What happens if mid-September becomes
early October, and it still hasn't been released?  I mean, every user
group promised TeX Live *sometime* in 2003 :).  Or, here's another
nightmare scenario -- final version does get released in mid-September,
we go to press, and there's a serious bug on the CD because we all
rushed it.  (Volker, you and I had talked about accepting a delay of two
or three weeks.  This is a delay of at least six, and more likely 8-10
weeks.)

So, I am not sure what to do.  On the one hand, it's obviously bad to
put out a TL which will become instantly obsolete when the new latex is
released.  On the other hand, it seems even worse to not really know
when the new TL is coming out at all ...

I guess my inclination is be conservative and release with the old latex
asap.  As annoying as that is, it also will give everyone breathing room
to test the new latex, see if any major packages need to be updated as
well, etc., etc.  But I guess I could be convinced to wait if that's the
consensus from everyone else ... ?

Perhaps we can shoot for releasing TL 2004 in May or early June,
depending on everyone's schedule.  And if Thomas releases a tetex with
the new latex shortly after its stable release, that will also help get
it out there. 

Reactions?

I support your idea. LaTeX is stable enough without the new version, and
those who *really* need the new code are able to install it by
themselves. Waiting and hoping for a fast release without testing is
more dangerous.

The replacement of mminstance at least seems simple enough.

Can someone explain this to me?

I tried updating mminstance in source.development from 1.18 to 1.23 
after testing compilation of mminstance separately. I tried this

	p4 delete mminstance/...
	p4 submit
	rm -rf mminstance
	gnutar zxvf mminstance-1.23.tar.gz
	mv mminstance-1.23 mminstance
	p4 add mminstance/*
	p4 add mminstance/*/*
	p4 add mminstance/*/*/*
	p4 add mminstance/*/*/*/*
	p4 submit

all this worked fine, or so it seemed. But then when I try a p4 sync, 
the old version is reinstalled on my client. What am I doing wrong?

I don't know, but did you check the changes that have been made from
Fabrice to the version in TL against the version from lcdf?

There was a thread (started by me) about this and inclusion of Fabrice's
patches into default mminstance!

Thanks, it did the work, but without recounting the total size

There were no answer to that...

Should it be possible to make temf structure in tetex and texlive more 
compatible ?

Thomas and I have indeed collaborated on that over the last year. it is
better than it was!

at the Dante-sponsored meeting in the spring, we tried to invent a
scheme for interchangeable packaging. I am not as sanguine as I was at
the time that it would be implemented :-}

source.development compiled well on old linux (rh6.2) and on rh9.0.
Altogether 240 files with symlinks.
Some binaries are missing now:
ht, htlatex, httex, httexi, mfw
and symlinks: 
pdfeinitex, pdfevirtex, pdfinitex, pdftosrc, pdfvirtex
Is that OK? I'm not so sure about those missing symbolic links.

Anyway, I deleted all old binaries and submited new stuff (#3406).
What about other platforms?

Foir htlatex and friends: the interface has changed and there is now 
one driver command (mk4ht) instead of many independent commands, which 
so far were not all in TL because if the clutter that resulted from it.

  option1:  mk4ht #1 "#2" "#3" "#4" "#5"

     #1:  htlatex, mzlatex, oolatex, dblatex, dbmlatex,
          teilatex, teimlatex, xhlatex, xhmlatex

          also 'tex' and 'texi' instead of 'latex'

     #2: file name
     #3: optional arguments for latex/tex/texi
     #4: optional arguments for tex4ht.c
     #5: optional arguments for t4ht.c

  option2:  mk4ht ht #2 #3 "#4" "#5"

     #1: ht
     #2: latex, tex
     #3: file name
     #4: optional arguments for tex4ht.c
     #5: optional arguments for t4ht.c

Message-ID: <200307221251.h6MCp0cO023360@reserv1.univ-lille1.fr>


Hi all!

I have noticed strange things in the pdftex.map file for TL8:

1) What are the funny encodings (f7b6d320.enc,10037936.enc, etc.)
   found in texmf/dvips/tetex for? Could Thomas explain why they are
   used now for the CM fonts and what these funny names mean?

   Why is cmr5 reencoded why a different encoding (0ef0afca.enc) while
   all other cmr* use f7b6d320.enc?

2) It seems to me that the updmap script does not do a proper job, see
   for instance what happens to cmbsy* fonts:

In TL8, I get this:
cmbsy10 CMBSY10 " TeX10037936Encoding ReEncodeFont " 
                  <10037936.enc <cmbsy10.pfb
cmbsy5 CMBSY5 <cmbsy5.pfb
cmbsy7 CMBSY7 <cmbsy7.pfb

In TL7, I had this:
cmbsy10 CMBSY10 <cmbsy10.pfb
cmbsy5 CMBSY5 <cmbsy5.pfb
cmbsy6 CMBSY7 <cmbsy7.pfb
cmbsy7 CMBSY7 <cmbsy7.pfb
cmbsy8 CMBSY7 <cmbsy7.pfb
cmbsy9 CMBSY10 <cmbsy10.pfb

a) the reencoding should apply to all or none of these, but not
   just to cmbsy10...
b) three lines are missing for cmbsy6, cmbsy8 and cmbsy9 (precisely
   the sizes using a different .pfb file (cmbsy6 uses cmbsy7.pfb).

I fear that this kind of thing might affect other fonts, a carefull
overall check seems to be needed. Another example:

In TL8:
cmmib10 CMMIB10 " TeXaae443f0Encoding ReEncodeFont " <aae443f0.enc
<cmmib10.pfb
cmmib5 CMMIB5 <cmmib5.pfb
cmmib7 CMMIB7 <cmmib7.pfb

In TL7:
cmmib10 CMMIB10 <cmmib10.pfb
cmmib5 CMMIB5 <cmmib5.pfb
cmmib6 CMMIB7 <cmmib7.pfb
cmmib7 CMMIB7 <cmmib7.pfb
cmmib8 CMMIB7 <cmmib7.pfb
cmmib9 CMMIB10 <cmmib10.pfb

Again cmmib6, cmmib8 and cmmib9 are missing... probably the same bug.

3) the following lines are missing too:
cmex7 CMEX10 <cmex10.pfb
cmex8 CMEX10 <cmex10.pfb
cmex9 CMEX10 <cmex10.pfb

Same bug again?

4) Two maps are not included: charter and uag.map (in urw.map), while
   PFB files for charter and AvantGarde are on TL8.

I won't comment on utopia, which has (sadly) been withdrawn for
obscure
copyright reasons...

Hi again,

With last year's TL7, 8-bit characters were printed correctly (I am on
Linux)
in the log files (? instead of ^^e9).

Playing with TL8 (2003/07/21), this is no longer true...
even worse: the environments like `example' used in lshort
(`example' displays the LaTeX code and the output side by side)
now print 8-bit characters as hexadecimal strings
instead of readable characters :-( I know, it is normal,
the text being copied in an external file...)

I also know that, adding -translate-file=cp8bit.tcx, or a '%& command'
in the first line of the document solves the problem, but I wonder
if it would be possible to silently  use cp8bit.tcx by default
when no other `translate-file' command is present,
just to recover the TL7 (much more user-friendly) behaviour.

A last one for today ;-)

The subfigure package puts a config file for ltxdoc in
texmf/tex/latex/subfigure/ltxdoc.cfg

The file ltxdoc.cfg should stay in the source sub-tree, otherwise
it is seen by LaTeX everytime you compile any .dtx file.

(This is new to TL8).

I think I killed those ini and vir links, as they are just

As I understand, it's better to put encoding vector explicitly into
resulting ps or pdf file (instead of extracting that from pfb).

Because cmr5 and cmr10 have different character set. Don't ask me why ;-)

cmbsy5 and 7 belong to different "cmextra" set of fonts, and as
rarelly used, they were just ignored.
The same with cmmib5 and 7.

It is just hack that shouldn't be recommended. The user can include
bsr-interpolated.map on demand.

As for charter, are those fonts legal? On teTeX charter.map
belongs to psnfss; on TL depot it is missing.
uag.map shouldn't be installed by default, as urw have to work
as substitution for standard lw35. I'm going to separate afm/pfb
files from other stuff like .tfm, .vf, .map files for urw, as explained 
some weeks ago.

It was compiled on rh6.2 and as I know, it works well on other distros.
(o)xdvi.bin is compiled separatelly statically.
At the moment you can grab it from p4 depot or from 
tug.org/texlive/Images/ when Sebastian remakes iso images.

Hmmm... no idea about dietlibc, but I think that binaries should be
compiled using standard gnu c libs.

Because there is no need of fi fl ff ffi ffl ligs at 5pt : so we have 
less greater arrowup arrowdonw instead. (it is true at tfm level, not

Ich habe zwar Suse-Linux 7.3 auf meinem Rechner und da ist eigentlich LATEX
auf den CD's, aber ich habe mir die CD's nur geliehen gehabt und da komme ich
nicht mehr dran.

Nun konnte ich zwar die install Datei starten, aber LATEX kann ich nicht

Ist das eine Version, die unter SuSE-Linux laufen m?sste ?

Vielen Dank f?r die hoffentliche sagt

Sorry, the way I wrote my report, probably makes you
think I have just compared the files pdftex.map from TL7 and TL8
and complain about differences I noticed...

What I am reporting is a _real_ bug. I stumbled upon it when trying
to recompile the French version of `lshort'. The cmex9 and cmmib9
fonts _are_ used in that document and the chapter about `Maths'
can no longer be displayed nor printed in PDF, because those fonts
are not available (missing entries in pdftex.map)!

-- TFM files for 
cmex7, cmex8, cmex9, and cmex10 
cmmib5, cmmib6, cmmib7, cmmib8, cmmib9, cmmib10
are present and LaTeX's .fd files (omxcmex.fd and omlcmm.fd)
make use of them, so they _are_ usable fonts.

-- PFB fonts should be available for them, either in each size
(as bakoma type1 fonts) or scaled from BlueSky fonts.

As I wrote before, I fear that there might be more entries
missing in pdftex.map, so I recommend a careful check of
the way this file is built.

As .pfb are available on TL8 for charter fonts, I guess
they are legal... anyway, on TL8 we should have 
-- either .pfb files AND entries for them in the psfonts.map
-- or no .pfb files (and no entries).

You are right. Those fonts are available, but not added to updmap.cfg
by installation scripts.
I will correct cmex.tpm and bluesky.tpm by adding proper
<TPM:Execute function="addMap"... (ttcmex.map and bsr-interpolated.map)

Right.

We have to do more checks in .tpm files.

charter.map is missing in texmf/dvips/psnfss/
Will add it.

I don't recall the terms under which Bitstream originally donated

Unless we can get this changed, seems like we have to remove it.

texmf/doc/fonts/charter/readme.charter
is sufficient, I guess. By the way we can read here:

 TeX metrics, virtual fonts and LaTeX font definition files can be found
 in the archive CTAN:fonts/metrics/freenfss.zip

which cannot be found on CTAN (see below 1. for the source of that file).

Walter? It is perhaps your turn, as it as well concerned psnfss.
As I found, we have still a mess with charter:
1. CTAN:/fonts/charter/
2. CTAN:/fonts/psfonts/bitstrea/charter/
3. CTAN:/fonts/psfonts/corelpack/charter/
(perhaps some more)
4. CTAN:/macros/latex/required/psnfss/

On TL:
a. fonts/afm/bit/charter/        (from 1., I've just removed it!)
b. fonts/afm/bitstrea/charter/   (from 2.)
c. fonts/type1/bitstrea/charter/ (from 1.)
d. latex support files (tfm, vf fd, sty) - nobody knows from where
e. dvips/psnfss/charter.map  (just added to p4 depot from 4.)

some stuff belongs to the charter package (afm and pfb), the rest to 
the psnfss package. I've corrected tpm files for charter, psnfss 
and psafm (?), including proper actions like adding map files to 
updmap.cfg, etc. I think that for future the charter fonts status,
corrections made in the font files, etc., etc. should be made
once forever, but in the first place on CTAN. The good example
is urw on CTAN (but I'm still working on it for TL ;-).

Spending many hours on repackaging urw fonts for TL, I have the following
conclusions (perhaps interesting for CTAN people and implementors):
1. "urwstd" has gone (#3414)
2. introduced "urw" package: base35 fonts which can serve as substitution
   of standard Adobe 35 fonts (only afm+pfb) + Antiqua + Grotesk (full 
   support: afm, pfb, tfm, fd)
   It can be seen somehow inconsequent, but I hope that it would be more
   easy to add such a package eg. to teTeX ;-)
   Anyway, I'm open to the suggestions, eg. separating Antiqua and Grotesq
   in some other packages
3. introduced "urw35vf" (#3416) which contains all (historical?) stuff
   for those using urw fonts directly (.vf, .tfm, .fd, .sty files).

As usual, after such reparation some screws are left, namely nimbus.
I don't know what to do, making separate package or to zap.

Speaking for myself, I can't do it. I'll be back home on the 6th of
August, and I won't have any access to my office before the 18th of
August.

There are still a couple of issues I'm working on and I would like to
sort out. So if we can delay this up to August, 25th or something like
that, it is more realistic for me.

I'll ask Volker what he thinks.

Frrom a purely technical aspect, it seems to be reasonable for me to wait
until people from hawaii are back to business, essp. since Fabrice has a
few things to change/cleanup.

The next thing that comes to my mind is that we could have more than just
one version of TL8.

That's to reduce the suprise of mf users who might expect to see "windowing"
support in "mf".

The mktex* scripts are changed so that they'll try to run mf-nowin if
available.

I don't think that's a good idea. I'd suggest having good, stable
product for all and avoid a mess with many versions.
This year we do not master CDs for GUST just for the above reasons.

Oh, these GUST versions that have existed for previous versions of TL
was what I had in mind. Obviously, you know better than me whether this
was good or bad.

We can put as many versions as we want on the web, but it's not
economically feasible to press more than one set of discs.

For example, we could put a beta .iso with the new latex (as soon as
it's released) on the web for the sake of anyone who might like to try
it that way.

I see.  Well, there's certainly no way to produce it before you're happy
with the Windows stuff, so I guess we're now talking end of August for
production and early September before mailing.  Ok, August 25th it is,
unless Volker feels strongly that we should delay.

pdfTeX is stable and just awaiting some review from Thomas. But
then we need new binaries.

I'm so sorry, but I repackaged cb fonts:
mf+tfm -> cb (still installed by default for tex-langgreek collection)
pfb and other files -> cbtype1 (tex-fontsextra collection)

Now we can build "demo" which can fit on 700mb cd and also avoid
installing unwanted 80mb of cb fonts in type1. Anyway, those fonts can
be always installed from "inst" cd or dvd.

If any objections, please let me know. It's very easy to revert
to the previous state as it concerns only tpm files. The last resort
would be removing tex-langgreek from "demo" cd. :-(

I support Karl's proposal. Aug 25th seems a bit late, but it's 
still cose to the max 2-3 weeks of acceptable delay (per Volker 
and Karl's discussion). Also, my department (people and machines) 
will be moving to new buildings, beginning late August. I'd like 
to have the production of TL8 on tug.org finalized by then!

Unless there are other greek fonts on the demo CD, that would make
demonstration of TeX for Greek language cumbersome.

I think we should aim for supporting as many languages on a demo CD 
as we can. If we're in megabyte trouble (again), isn't it possible
to trim big packages to a minimum needed for demonstration purposes?

some lines below your quoted text, permission is granted to distribute this
file. Still, this does not make it free software. The file disallows any

Is there anybody in the mood of contacting the author or uk-tug? I think
that they'd be very suprised to see TL8 without "their" patterns.

    some lines below your quoted text, permission is granted to distribute this
    file. Still, this does not make it free software. The file disallows any
    modifications and this violates our rules.

The same is true for hyphen.tex.  hyphen.tex starts with:
% The Plain TeX hyphenation tables [NOT TO BE CHANGED IN ANY WAY!]

It doesn't even have the `This file of hyphenation patterns may be
freely distributed.' statement which ukhyph.tex does.

I interpret this as being under the same rules as plain.tex, tex.web,
and other files.  You're actually allowed to copy it to a new name and
make changes, you just can't edit it "in place" and distribute the
result with the same name.  This is obviously ok, or rms would never
have accepted TeX as free software in the first place.

My guess is that there are many other files with the same sort of
non-copyright.

Admittedly it would be better to spell it all out, but isn't it more
important that DEK work on volume 4?

In the same way that the "modification is allowed if you rename this file"
was added to plain.tex, it was added to hyphen.tex, as well:

  % The Plain TeX hyphenation tables [NOT TO BE CHANGED IN ANY WAY!]
  % Unlimited copying and redistribution of this file are permitted as long
  % as this file is not modified. Modifications are permitted, but only if
  % the resulting file is not named hyphen.tex.

rms has accepted the unmodifyable tex.web due to the changefile mechanism
that we have. hyphen.tex was known as a problem to him and we are all
glad that this was just recently resolved.

I checked many packages and finally started cleaning
texmf/source/ tree
1. many files belong rather to texmf/doc/latex or texmf/doc/fonts
   as they are needed to produce documentations, or just are the only
   available README files (under many sometimes strange names)
2. some files moved from source/latex/ to source/fonts/
3. cleaned some garbage (e.g. source/latex/minitoc/ )

That kind of protection is a different part of copyright law, which 
here in The Netherlands is called "fathership protection". It means 
that the author is protected against any adapted work being paraded as 
his own. This is also a right which you cannot waive by principle.

He might not have read every ile...

It is also in the Berne convention I think. It's a non-transferable. It 
also holds for any file that is under the LaTeX license.

BTW, there are differences in copyright between countries. For example, 
in The Netherlands you do not need to 'claim' copyright by adding a 
copyright statement, you have it (and fathership's rights) 
automatically.

It is an intereasting legal question if the file name itself is 
copyright-protected. Otherwise, we would be able to rename ukhyph.tex 
to ukhyph-org.tex and have a new ukhyph.tex with a different license 
with no effect on existing installations. My guess about the 
copyrightable filename is that this would be silly to fall under the 
copyright. If a filename (even in combination with content) could be 
copyrighted we would have a lot of problems.

I would like to repeat my original proposal:

1. Image = CD = published version, major number (i.e. TL7 TL8). The 
image does *not* change until there is a next major release. Image 
comes from source at a certain moment and from Master.
2. source tree. Updated once a while when fixes and improvements have 
matured in source.development. Could carry a minor number (e.g. 8.1 8.2 
but maybe that is not a good idea because you want to be able to 
incidentally fix nasty bugs in source before source.development has 
matured). Sebastian decides on the update of source.
3. source.development tree. Current development status.

The question is of course Master, which is not split in a stable and a 
development tree. Probably this should happen as well. It is probably 
not a good idea to have a second image. The reason is pyschological. If 
you move to a second image which is updated more often, the pressure to 
keep *the* image fault free and 'done' diminishes.

This claims copyright on the file name which in my view goes beyond

LPPL licence claims :

   3. You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the
      original file.

Do you mean that LaTeX should be removed from texlive (well : plenty of 
free room for the demo cd -)

Not at all. I just think that this claim might not be enforcable in 
court. Though in terms of establishing 'fathership's rights' it might 
be.

I do not know for certain. The only thing I do know is that dropping 
this claim in LPPL (as well as in other TeX sources) does not affect 
fathership's rights nor does it really harm TeX, LaTeX or anyone. And 
the claim as is forces upon us that certain parts need to be renamed if 
they are to become 'improvable'. That is holding back innovation, or at 
least it implies a administrative hurdle, because it claims room in the 
filename namespace. If I want to improve ukhyph.tex I can do so by 
shipping an alternative with a different name. A lot of administrative 
actions follow before people can use it. If I coul dsilently slip in an 
improved/different version under the same name, and the contents of 
that file point to me as the author, it woul dbe easier to improve.

In other words, this 'file namespace' claim is a hurdle for innovators. 
I would like to see it go. I also do not see a very good reason why 
this draconic measure is in place. After all, the filename itself does 
not point directly to an author, so nobody gets hurt when the same 
filename is used for an alternative or even something completely 
different.

I think the current situation, where we have last year's release

source.development simply causes confusion and should be excised.  But
it's not up to me.

I strongly disagree. Stable situations during TeX development and 
maintenance occur far more often than a CD release. For me this has 
been essential in providing a 'living but stable' TeX to the Mac OS X 
community. If I would have to draw these regular but important updates 
(e.g. a new stable version of pdfTeX appears) from the 
source.development tree I would have to cope with a lot of 
instabilities.

Over the last years, source has been updated once in Aa while from 
source.development when source.development was in a stable state (the 
end of a change-test cycle)

The image could be seen as a frozen state of the source tree.

Why not? The fact is that the web offers a smaller range (not the 
entire Master tree) but it can keep people up to date with important 
changes when they have stabilized. What is against using the web as a 
companion of the CD? Why restrict?

If the we would only have a source tree, my whole 'service' would break 
down. I will not distribute as my main redistribution anything based on 
a development tree.

> Meanwhile, let's concentrate on getting this year's release done :).

Of course. But this issue is of vital importance to my work. Without a 
regular update of source from source.development my work becomes rather 
undoable.

we cannot really start a final compile until Martin thinks pdftex is

demo image size we can fix easily; but translations will take a lot
longer

I am fairly happy that the texmf tree is OK, after recent testing and
fixes. of course, it is never perfect,  but the current round of
fontmap-related stuff looks good.

personally, given the amount of volunteer time available, I am not in
favour of complicated solutions which make the demo cd different from
the others. the idea that you get more files if you install package foo
from inst as opposed to demo is fairly horrifying...

1.11a is feature-frozen and it seems we have killed all known bugs.

But we are planning some organisational changes and it would be
appropriate to announce them together with a new release.

It is just that the frequency of TL is a bit less than the frequency of 
important updates. If somebody updates mminstance, it shoul d not take 
1.5 years to range the general public. If pdfTeX gets improved (and 
that happened quite a lot) the general public should profit and not 
have to wait for more than a year. Often the improvements and fixes are 
important enough and I certainly have many users who have no idea about 
compiling your own binaries, libraries and programs.

The way I have been doing this is by following Build/source which has 
been updated with major new releases (when stable) and bugfixes. So it 
has been practice over the last years that Build/source contains a 
"release candidate", something that is stable enough for release. Let's 
say that happens something like once every 3-4 months, but only when 
there is a good reason (important bugfixes/imprvements)

Regularly, when Build/source.development was in a state deemed to be 
stable, Sebastian has updated Build/source. And that enables people 
like me to offer a very up-to-date but also stable update for users.

So, I think a clean setup would be:
	1. Image: what has been released as TL2003, created from Build.source 
at a certain point in time
	2. Build/source: what has "release candidate" status, created from 
Build/source.development at a certain point in time
	3. Build/development: playground

TeX Live has always been used as the basis of a CD release. But these 
days may users also use TeX Live (through me) as the basis of an 
internet-based release. Programs only of course (Master is too big), 
but still rather useful. A well thought-out procedure is good for 
supporting both results out of TeX Live.

If I understand the whole discussion, we need the _same_ source/
(not source.development/) for including on CDs/DVD and for remaking
all binaries. Otherwise, we cannot distribute old source/ tarball
which is completelly different from the current state.

BTW, current win32 tex is Web2c 7.4.5 but for Linux it is 7.5.2

I hope that after last changes to pdftex source.development can
be promoted to source, then binaries for all platforms should be
rebuit again _from_ source/ for the release of TL mastered by Lehmans.

It was very interesting but before I had occasion to check it more,

I found that faq-english.tmp contains something strange:
texmf/doc/html/faq/FAQ-ps@empty.html

----
install-tl.sh option for demo/live 
<R> do not install files, set up to run off CD or DVD
doesn't work at all. For install-compr.sh this option is obsolete.

I added to MakeImages.sh, "demo" section:
cp install-pkg-live.sh install-pkg.sh
(just for completeness ;-)

"inst" section:
exclude bin/win32 after copying TeXsetup.exe to /tpm

As for "demo", we should copy just all win32 binaries since
xemtex tree is not enough.

I would say that the CD/DVD/image should contain the snapshot of source 
from when the binaries were created. But source woul dnot need to be 
fixed at what is on the image (hasn't been for the last years anyway).

You're right that we have to distribute the actual source with any given
release, not anything older (or newer).  And Gerben is also right that
this does not mean the source should be "frozen", in fact it can't be.

    BTW, current win32 tex is Web2c 7.4.5 but for Linux it is 7.5.2

Perhaps this is one of the things Fabrice was going to deal with when he
gets back to work.

Very strange. install-tl.sh installs in /usr/TeX by default. Even if 
you've changed the default TEXDIR to eg. /usr/local/share/, you do not 
need seting VARTEXMF. Did you have any TeX specific environment variables
set _before_ running install-tl.sh? Which platform?

Unfortunatelly no. We still keep pdf(e)tex.pool for pdftex 1.10b 
(web2c 7.4.5) because not all binaries sets were remade (win32) and 
pdftex is still changing. I can send you proper .pool files

Kind regards,

At work we are SGI Irix, so I only have linux on a P-90 laptop with a tiny
hard disk (to provide Xprint).  I have to run from the iso image that
resides on an NFS filesystem.  Install-tl.sh did not work as advertised,
the "R" option to run from the mounted image didn't do anything.

Fyi, sun.dante.de perforce site is alive, but refuses connections:

  p4 sync //depot/Build/source/...
  Perforce client error:
          Connect to server failed; check $P4PORT.
          TCP connect to sun.dante.de:1666 failed.
          connect: sun.dante.de:1666: Connection refused
  echo $P4PORT
  sun.dante.de:1666

Do I need to change the P4PORT variable?

Subject: [tex-live] TeX file preamble proposal
Message-ID: <B64D1E76-BDBB-11D7-9A60-000A95901A7E@rna.nl>

I encounter different programs which may react to the first line of a 
TeX file. Some front ends write something there. texexec can react to 
something in that line. TeX itself can. All want that first line and 
all have a different idea of the structure.

I would like to propose the following:

1. The initial comment block in a TeX file may contain information for 
external programs
2. Information for external programs will be preceded by %!, if % is 
not followed by ! it is deemed to be a plain comment
3. The first alphanumerical word after %! is the name of the program 
the rest of the line is meant for, this word is followed by an = sign. 
Whitespace around the = sign and around the word is ignored.
4. The word `program' is reserved. A line "%! program = foo" will set 
the file to be executed by foo only.

Example:

%% This is file foo.tex, part of the bar project
%! texexec = --pdf --mode=screen
%! TeXShop = root:../bar.tex engine=ConTeXt

Another example:

%! program=pdflatex
%! pdflatex = --interaction batchmode

This structure (a better one could be designed) should replace also the 
'parse first line' in TeX.

The first thing to do would be to add a 'parse-preamble-comment' option 
to TeX itself. In time, this comment could replace the working of 
parse-first-line but that one needs to remain in place for backward 
compatibility.

When TeX puts this in place in a standardized way, all frontends would 
probably adapt to it and using multiple frontends would become a 
possibility improving the portability and flexibility of TeX.

I know TeX does not need to change for this per se (drivers and front 
ends other than TeX could just forget about the first line), but I 
think a standardisation from TeX would be followed easily by outside 
programs and it would work as a solution for existing conflicts.

What is you reaction to the general idea?

I assume this (or something like it) is a real example?  The general
idea seems sensible enough to me, although of course it's really Olaf
and the others whose opinions we need :).

Is a leading %% line really ok, though?  I wonder about having it stop
reading as soon as it hits a non-%! line?  It seems cleaner, and more like
shell script #! parsing.

Also, %! may not be the best sequence, since that's the magic number for
PostScript?  I'm not sure if it would cause any confusion in practice,
but ... maybe (off the top of my head) %%! or %* or %\ ...

Hi friends!

I have the following problem compiling texlive on alpha:

rm -f libt1lib.a
ar cru libt1lib.a t1cs.o t1interp.o t1item.o t1font.o t1mm.o t1rw.o t1unparser.o psres.o 
ar: libt1lib.a: Input/output error

The problem is in the mminstance, which was updated -- but I am not sure
wether correct.

I also think that it might be a problem with g++ and mminstance, i.e.
that mminstance requires a more recent compiler (here we have
gcc-2.95.4).

Do you have any ideas?



Best wishes

i'll look at the docu later this year; with regards to adjusting: this 
needs a closer look since there is a discrepancy between than's thesis and 
pdftex itself, as well as that thanh wants to clean up that code.

I've recompiled binaries for solaris in source and source.development,
with different results. source.development went fine. in source,
configuration broke down in tex4ht:

 make[4]: Entering directory `/tmp/Build/source/TeX/texk/tex4htk'
 /bin/sh config.status --recheck
 ...

It just kept looping there :(

Subject: [tex-live] Huge latex/ pdflatex suggestion
Message-ID: <20030728224517.E111022710@mole.bio.cam.ac.uk>

Hi,

We've been trying to extend latex / pdflatex compile time limits to
generate reports consisting of large tables which include a very large
number of images.  Considering that the memory available on typical
systems now is so much larger than it was when TeX was developed we
wonder if it would be possible for you to distribute huge latex and
pdflatex configurations on the ready-to-run texlive compilation.  It
is likely that many of our colleagues in the gene expression
microarray field will be interested in using our report generation
code but will not have the expertise to extend TeX.

We notice that you have changed the max_halfword in the newest sources
and we hope that in line with this you may increase other compile time
limits that we have not hit yet.

We had to change pdf_mem_size in pdftex.ch as follows:

<   setup_bound_var (65536)('pdf_mem_size')(pdf_mem_size);
---
>   setup_bound_var (500000)('pdf_mem_size')(pdf_mem_size);


Changing texmf.cnf limits is less of an issue as recompilation is of
course not necessary.

We hope these are useful suggestions.

Best wishes,

Gos

Subject: [tex-live] htlatex for i386-linux, address
Message-ID: <20030729131140.GA4450@linux.vpn.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

image: beta-live.iso 2003/07/27

1. htlatex for i386-linux
   ----------------------
I am missing "htlatex" in "bin/i386-linux". Other directories
contain it:

$ find /media/texlive8/bin -name htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/alphaev5-osf4.0d/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/alpha-linux/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/i386-freebsd5.0/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/i386-openbsd3.0/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/i386-solaris2.8/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/powerpc-aix4.3.3.0/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/powerpc-darwin6.3/htlatex
/media/texlive8/bin/sparc64-linux/htlatex

2. Correct address?
   ----------------

README.EN or texmf/doc/tldoc/english/live.pdf: tex-live@tug.org
README.DE: texlive@tug.org
texmf/doc/tldoc/deutsch/live.pdf, section 10: rahtz@tug.org
Anyway, this German version is not uptodate (current version
is here texlive7 from Mai 2002 (eg. last paragraph of section 9).

Best regards
