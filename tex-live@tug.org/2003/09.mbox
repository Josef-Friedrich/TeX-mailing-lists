Hi Staszek,
while reading the tldoc and testing the new TeXLive a bit I found funny characters in
the display of packages. It looks like a macro converting "&" into what ever went berserk.

And why is the root-node in the package tree named "unknown"?

Cheers, Volker

I also observed that, it seems that xml tools converts "" into 
&amp; so for those files touched by me I tried to avoid using ""
(I used ' ' instead). SPQR and Fabrice could say more.

> And why is the root-node in the package tree named "unknown"?

You mean TeXSetup 'selecting package'? Strange, some days it was TeXLive.
Fabrice?

I fixed that several times in the past. Will look again.

> And why is the root-node in the package tree named "unknown"?

If you see unknown, then something wrong happened. Namely, TeXSetup was
unable to read the whole set of tpm files. The root node is
collection/texlive.tpm and has a specific attribute to say so.

Sorry, solaris 7 no longer compiles on my client:

[...]
checking size of void *... configure: error: cannot compute sizeof (void *), 77
See `config.log' for more details.

I recall mminstance was discussed at some point. Any hints?

Hi all,

thanks to Sebastian and his big crew of very helpful people, the TeXLive
2003 is ready. But this year we are going to have the "TeX Collection
2003", this is a combination of three different TeXLive distributions
and the complete CTAN snapshot. The TeXLive distributions are

 live  a complete, runnable system on DVD; too large for a CD-ROM (more
       than 1GB!). The DVD also includes the CTAN snapshot completely
       independent of TeXLive.

 inst  a complete system on CD; to make it fit on one CD, everything was
       compressed. Therefore, it is not possible to run TeX directly from
       the *inst*allable CD.

 demo  a live system runnable directly from CD; this fit on a CD, because
       CJK language support, typesetting music, and some less-commonly
       used fonts have been dropped, and executables only for Linux,
       MacOSX, and Windows systems are on this CD.

DANTE is going to produce this version of the new TeX Collection together
with Lehmanns Bookshops. The set of one DVD and two CDs is packaged in a
digifile cover (= cardboard box with two flaps, sizes are
        125.5 mm x 140 mm x 9 mm folded, or
        125.5 mm x 279 mm x 6 mm one flap folded or
        125.5 mm x 429 mm x 3 mm unfolded)

The price for one set is
       1.90 Euro + VAT and shipping
                   VAT-free if VAT registration number is given

For those user groups ordering the TeX Collection there is the possibility
to order in addition set of CTAN CDs (four CDs in paper envelopes) for the
price of 0.80 Euros per set + VAT (no VAT for USA).

Interested user groups are invited to participate in this production,
please send an email to cdrom@dante.de with
    - number of TeX Collection sets
                CTAN CDs sets
    - mailing address
    - billing address

Greetings,
      Volker

I have it for Solaris now (Irix is compiling, it takes *hours*). 
Funny, omega and eomega have different versions:

  ./eomega --version
  e-Omega (Web2C 7.5.2) 3.141592--1.15--2.1--RC1
  [...]
  
  ./omega --version
  Omega (Web2C 7.5.2) 3.141592-1.23.2.2
  [...]

Note: an attempt to build the entire 'world' directly from the current
source may fail.

There are also pesky line endings in source/TeX/utils/mminstance/
(Makefile.am, maybe more).

That seems to be intended; eOmega ist probably based on the
stable Omega (i.e. actually usable) while Omega is the latest
Omega.

    can someone bring me up to date with where we are? are we frozen yet?

More or less.  Fabrice has been continue to make a few Windows tweaks to
fix problems Staszek has found.  eomega binaries have been getting
remade so that they are all the same version and thus use the same pool
file.  Other than that, no changes have been made since you went away, I
believe.

On the doc side, Fabrice and Staszek are hoping to have the French and
Polish translations done by Friday.  Petr said he's trying for Monday
for Czech.  I haven't heard a date from Volker for German, but I know
he's started, he sent a bunch of good corrections for the first few pages.
Have heard nothing about Russian, guess that will have to wait until
next year.

On the A-W front, Patrick Daly is still contemplating exactly what to
do.  He wants to use the demo cd, but their production needs to stick to
a standard CD, not 700MB.  I made a special version for him that omits
all language support (at his request), and he's deciding what he wants
to do.  Partly that's because I couldn't see any good way of omitting
*just* the tldoc translations without skipping the entire language,
seems like I'd have to edit all the tpm files (obviously without
checking them in), etc.

I wrote to Karnikowski about the German A-W book on Monday, telling him
things were delayed due to the doc, haven't heard back.

I don't know exactly where CTAN stands or who's doing it or when it'll
be ready, but from what Volker has sent, I gather it's in process.

Anything else?

OK, makes sense. I have just updated some LaTeX packages in the texmf
tree (well, why not, since I saw them come in....)

much too complicated. cant we just omit another package?

Karl already explained most things.
I'd suggest only:
1. updating Catalogue
2. finishing tldoc translations
3. remaking pictures/front.jpg (some strange look, eg. lost characters:
   D+DVD instead of CD+DVD as on .pdf)
4. refreshing fontmaps
5. refreshing ls-R
Finis!

Volker said the cover was preliminary anyway, so I didn't worry about
details.  (For one thing, the list of user groups needs adjusting, one
way or another.)

I made the jpg by running pdf2ps, then pstopnm, then pnmtojpg.  Perhaps
there's a cleaner way? The pdftopbm that's part of xpdf came out with a
black image (author says it'll fixed at some point ...).

I just use "convert". eg
 pdftops foo.pdf foo.ps
 convert foo.ps foo.png

Dear fellow tldoc writers and testers,

at the moment I'm lost and need some help. While translating
Karl's version of tldoc, I started to run the TeXLive demo image
on my XP notebook to test and compare. 
First I had it installed on drive f: and everything seemed ok. 
Several days ago, I decided to throw away my old TL7 installation
on c:, and put a new one ontop of it. 
To get rid of TL alltogether, I first deinstalled TL8 from f:, 
than started to install new on c: over the old TeXLive/texmf tree. 
I've tried it now several times (9 to be exact), and every time 
installation starts ok, and after 70--80% of the installation 
I get a blue screen. *E*V*E*R*Y* TIME!!
In the meantime I'm a bit more cautious, so I'm saving all my 
changes in tldoc before starting to install and reboot. 
But I've lost quite some work and several hours.

Has anybody experienced something similar, when installing *over*
an old installation? Any advice??

Helpless, Volker


PS: I was a bit surprised, that it's not possible anymore to select
    one's favorite editor. No winshell anymore for people who want
    to test a simple windows environment?
Surprise2: that *all* binaries of gs, perl, imagemagick etc. go 
    into texlive/bin/win32.

I have made some changes to the setup, so the demo CD comes in at
exactly 650 mbytes. I did this by losing some more fonts, so no
documenation changes needed

feel free to disagree with my dropped fonts, but dont put them back
without finding an alternative to drop....

Well, my diagnose: TL8 from f:\ _wasn't_ uninstalled. Fabrice cured
it some days ago (removing RO attributes after new installation and so)
I'm afraid you have mess in registry: old installation on C:
and those on F: not cleaned well. Open regedit, find texlive
and clean all keys found, then install from the _current_ image
over your old installation on c:

I've just installed TL7 on clean machine, then started new TeXSetup  
and installed TL8(2003) over an TL7 installation in the same directory.
Things went smoothly, even old config files were backup.

It was too complicated to maintain all sort of the software. 
support/WinShell or support/vim are on all CDs/DVD and you can install 
it by just clicking on exe file.

Those binaries are integrated as XEmTeX bundle, but GS, Perl, etc.
can be installed separatedly without installing Xemacs.
Go to 'Packages Selection' -> tex-xemtex
All libs files are also installed in TeXlive tree, but the advantage
is that TeXSetup now sets proper environment variables.
It is not the case when you install GS from the standard distribution,
when eg. GS_LIB is not set, but is needed by many batch programs
(like epstopdf).

Hi Gerben,

I believe I have met most of the people on this list (or have known
them for years via email), but I do not know you.  Still, I extend
my warmest wishes to you and your family.  Congratulations on the
newest addition to the family!

Perhaps we will meet one of these days at a EuroTeX conference.

Regards,

Tom

That won't cure anything.  A blue screen under XP means either a
hardware problem (triggered by accessing some memory address for
example) or a bad driver. No user application can trigger such a problem
directly. The application would be killed.

I didn't want to maintain setup of foreign programs.

At some point, to install Winshell, I had to run their installer,
waiting for it to finish, then try to find some strange key in the
registry to locate it and unzip the patch on top of it. Then to support
WinEdt installation, I had to run the setup.exe program in some
different context because it is (was ?) a 16bit application, and use
some dirty trick to know that WinEdt setup was finished, and then again
apply a patch in a different way.

Sorry, but in the long term, I found it stupid. People may install
whatever editor they want. The only one(s) I know supported for years
are (X)Emacs, and they are free. So I chose to stick with that.

Problem : adding too many paths to environment may fail, especially
long ones. Not only environment size is limited (you can raise the
limit, but up to 2k or 4k under W95), but also the value of and
environment variable can't be more than 256 chars under W9X (well, have
to check, but I remember that after some limit, the path list was
truncated).

The trick is that those Perl, GS and ImageMagick are not meant to be
used outside of TeXLive.

yes, that's true. I've cleaned the registry manually -> doesn't help. Then
I deleted all system/user variables (or changed them): TEXMFCNF, PATH,
etc.
That helped!
I've now installed several times without any problem.

*BUT*,
I'm now running a full installation with everything from the *demo* CD,
and cannot compile live.tex anymore. It was a bit late this morning (~5 am)
and I had no chance to check what's wrong, so I've some lines from live.log
to this mail. 
Which TL version do you (Karl, Staszek) when writing the documentation?

acceptable to me. we just have to document the differences to last year's
version.

that's ok too.

I'm without mail today till late (maintenance of mail server, etc).

I just installed from the "demo" image, using all defaults (under
Linux), and the texlive documentation more or less ran immediately. It
fell over when it wanted TeX4ht, as that is not part of the recommended
installation

certainly no problems about ptmr7t.tfm

cm-super is not on the demo CD, of course.

maybe TeX Live docs should switch to use lm? just needs a
\usepackage{lmodern}.

Did you install the demo CD ? Or ran tex from the demo cd ? Actually,
the demo CD is not runnable under windows because the .map files are
symbolic links to their counterparts. Imho, updmap should copy the
files, not make symbolic links, to be truly portable. Actually,
updmap.exe makes copies of the files, but the ones on the repository
have been generated using Unix.

Alternatively, for purposes of TL production, we could have

I'm inclined to the former, so that in general Unix systems can export

    Which TL version do you (Karl, Staszek) when writing the documentation?

I have been using TL7 :).  Although I tested TL2003 installation many
times, my actual TeX runs on tldoc have been with the TL7 installed
either on tug.org or my home (Linux) machine.

I'm baffled as to why your fresh installation could not find ptmr7t.
Just a wild guess, some of those nasty environment variables that have
been plaguing you are still causing trouble.

I prefer to use symlinks to make it easy for users to see which files
are the same. For TeX Live, there are ways around this problem, e.g.
as Karl has suggested.

I'm using the current stuff ;-) And I strongly suggest switching
to it.
 
> I'm baffled as to why your fresh installation could not find ptmr7t.

all CDs/DVD have ptmr7t ptmr8t and those tfm files are _always_
installed as part of psnfss package in tex-latex collection

As for "demo" or any other distribution: tex4ht is not installed
in 'recommended' scheme but can be added during installation or later.

"demo" cd doesn't contain huge cm-super, but at the moment
tldoc for English, French and German needs them for producing
.ps and .pdf version. :( 

I don't understand well all those tricky font substitutions behind the
scene, so could somebody check only that part and switch to lm fonts? 
I think that is something near altt.sty loaded in tex-live.sty.
Thanks in advance.

Map files on "demo" and other: on Windows running updmap 
makes good hard copies. For "run off cd-rom" it copies ready made
map files to temporary directory also as hard copies and now it 
works well (Fabrice, do you remember, it was corrected some days ago).

Thanks,

Well, when I said "not runnable", I meant not runnable without running
updmap.exe so that .map files be created in some temp texmf tree. What I
actually do when xemacs is started.

Anyway, I don't think it is a good idea to keep symlinks on a "portable"
cdrom. Those links are translated to a simple text file containing the
target path on windows, so are not usable.

So  yes, that would   be something sensible to  do,  except in the  bin/
subdirectory, just to prevent any other problem in the future.

It was easier then expected, just changing in tex-live.sty
\def\ttdefault{cmtt}
to
\def\ttdefault{lmtt}

(we cannot \usepackage{lmodern} since the document uses pslatex)

"demo" cd is enough for compiling tldoc! Just install 'recommended'
scheme + tex-htmlxml collection and... do not try to make PS file
(we doesn't have good front.eps, pdftops cannot make it).

Will upload shortly all changed stuff.

Hi,

> Well, this seems a fairly serious problem :).
I had installed the *whole* demo cd on my notebook with xemtex
and everything selected. When I checked the map files, I had 
  \texlive\texmf\fonts\map\dvips\updmap\dvips.map and
  \texlive\texmf\fonts\map\pdftex\updmap\pdftex.map, etc. 
with 0 bytes.

Some of the problems I reported last time were solved,
when I renamed the whole texlive tree, and began to install
to a new one. Finally I found that in the old (renamed) one,
several files had the attribute "r" (readonly), so they
were not overwritten and the (re)install script reported them
with error 5 and stopped on that package. I do not know how 
an readonly setting can happen, when installed over and over 
again. But, my fault, I never really checked in depth the log 
files where this was written.

Now I have a new system, I've made the map files manually. 
Now with the fix to tex-live.sty by Stazek (\def\ttdefault{lmtt}).
I have a system, which runs (on live.tex) or to be precise:
it can compile the documentation again, sigh...

But I've tried "texexec" and I'm getting:
  irun: no perl.exe script
  of name c:\Progra~1\TeXlive\texmf\context\perltk\texexec.pl can be found.
  Aborting.
  irun: CreateProcess 3
How does it now about an very old installation, deleted more than two weeks
ago? Where is that stored? 
The new one is on d:\tl8\texmf\context\perltk\texexec.pl.

Now I'm trying to download the new demo image, and try that. But slowly I'm 
nerved, having fiddled around with the system for days and not written a page
of the documentation (but lost some when I had the blue screens).

I have fixed that today. Sorry, only half the perl files were okay (the
context ones were not).

About the read-only thing: yes that's a bad effect of the cdrom I can't
simulate easily. I had to explicitly reset the read-only attribute when
unzipping files.

There is a problem with this RO thing under NT/2K/XP. A file can have
the RO attribute and have permissions associated with it if under
NTFS. NTFS permissions work with access lists and a file my be writable
by someone and only readable by someone else. But the RO attribute still
exists for compatibility with FAT/FAT32 and W9X. If a file is RO under
NT, it is RO for everybody, even the administrator. And you have to
manually use the 'attrib' command to reset it before being able to
overwrite the file.

There is no clever conversion from Unix permissions to Windows
permissions. So under Windows, the best I can do is to harm people as
less as possible and reset this RO attribute that is much annoying.

I'll check for the demo and live cdroms what happens.

If someone has a better solution, please speak up.

Dear friends,

after the DANTE meeting this week I can give you some information regarding

Manfred Lotz, who is doing the snapshot and compilation, is working on it.
I make the cover.  We found a schedule that is realistic, but challenging,
with the result that I want to be ready with the cover next week, Manfred
wants to be ready with the images last Friday in September, and the production
should be done until October 2nd (as Oct. 3 is a bank holiday in Germany).
In this schedule Manfred would expect the final TeX Live images
to be ready around September 22nd to do the final merge of CTAN
and TeX Live. (You see, burning is faster than printing)
But be aware it is the first DVD we ever produced, so we will be careful and
only send the images to the duplication company when we think they are
working and tested, as we will only merge the TeX Live DVD when the
TeX Live team says it is ok. With other words, we want to reach quality,
not a fixed date, and would like to reach both (and Manfred does a fine work, 
so I am more optimistic than I use to be normally).

The plan for merging is:
The directory structure of TeX Live DVD will remain as is, there will only
a directory called 'ctan' occur, which contains the ctan snapshot.
So we hope there shouldn't occur problems with setup and documentation.
(BTW: We assume it is better to keep the symbolic links in TL?)

I made some changes in the front cover compared to the first draft.
I replaced 'Edition 2003' with 'Edition 9/2003', the names of editors
(Sebastian and Manfred) are now in the bottom bar, while the list of
LUGs is removed. As in the last years CTAN snapshots, *any* LUG
I know to exist will be listed in the inner part of the cover, no matter
wether it will order the collection or not. The draft is available from
http://lbdb01.gsi.de/cover/front.pdf or
http://lbdb01.gsi.de/cover/front.jpg

There will neither be a copyright remark on the cover nor on the CD/DVD 
labels, as I don't regard the attitude of some publishers as fair, to include 
(maybe modified) TeX Live CDs into their books and print a copyright on
them (like the TeX Live CD in 'LaTeX fuer Dummies' is marked as
(c) MITP and - up to my knowledge, at least Volker claimed it - similar
for the one in Springer's book about digitial typography) .

Regarding the license text of  TeX Live I see a problem for the merged TeX 
Live and CTAN DVD. It states that to best knowledge there is only Free 
Software on it. This is definitely wrong for the things in the nonfree part 
of CTAN, and I doubt the CTAN-Team would say that up to their best
knowledge there is nothing nonfree remaining in the other parts of CTAN.
So I would like to propose a slightly different LICENSE.DVD instead of the 
LICENSE.TL (for the CDs nothing would be changed), clarifying that
TeX Live only contains free software while the things in the ctan directory 
tree can have different licenses.

My proposal is:
-----------
Copying conditions for TeX Collection (TeX Live and CTAN snapshot).

You may copy, modify, or redistribute software from this distribution
only if you comply with the requirements placed thereon by the owners of
the respective software packages.  To learn these requirements, please
check Graham Williams' TeX Catalogue at:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(or any CTAN mirror, of course).
The Catalogue is also included in TeX Live at
./texmf/doc/html/catalogue/catalogue.html, but the online version will
have updates.

If you make any changes to any package or the TeX Live distribution
itself, of course you should prominently mention such changes in your
modified distribution so that users do not take your work for ours, and
know to contact you, not us, in case of questions or problems.

We recommend using an existing free software license, such as the LaTeX
Project Public License, the GNU Public License, the Lesser GNU Public
License, the X Window System license, the modified BSD license, etc.
Please see http://www.debian.org/intro/free for more discussion of this.

To the best of our knowledge, all software in the TeX Live part of the
distribution (these are the TeX Live demo and installation CD-ROMs and
the DVD without the directory "ctan") is freely redistributable (libre,
that is, not necessarily gratis), within the Debian Free Software
Guidelines (see the url above).  If you find any problematic files
included in the TeX Live part of the distribution, or if you have other
questions or comments regarding TeX Live, email us at tex-live@tug.org.

The directory "ctan" on the DVD contains a snapshot of CTAN, the
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (please refer to ./ctan/README.HTML
for details). The software packages in this directory tree have
various license conditions, both free licenses like LPPL or GPL and
restricted licenses (this is definitely the case for the packages in
./ctan/nonfree). If you find any problematic files included in the
CTAN part of the distribution, or if you have other questions or comments
regarding the CTAN snapshot, email us at cdrom@dante.de.

Thanks for your interest in TeX.

Message-ID: <200309102341.h8ANfev02475@f7.net>

Hi Klaus,

Thanks for the information.

    In this schedule Manfred would expect the final TeX Live images
    to be ready around September 22nd 

Well, there should be no problem with that, assuming Volker can get the
German translation done by then (seems like plenty of time).  The TL
images have been essentially ready for a couple weeks already, per the
original deadline.  As long as we can resist introducing tons of new
changes and packages :), it should be fine.

    and the production should be done until October 2nd

Does this mean the production will *start* on Oct 2, or be *complete* on
Oct 2?  Just asking for information.

And do these dates include the CTAN CD set?

    (BTW: We assume it is better to keep the symbolic links in TL?)

Yes, the symlinks must be kept.

    http://lbdb01.gsi.de/cover/front.jpg

Looks ok to me, FWIW.

    *any* LUG I know to exist will be listed in the inner part of the cover,

Fair enough.  Can we see a draft when you have one available, please?

    There will neither be a copyright remark on the cover nor on the
    CD/DVD labels

Good.

    include (maybe modified) TeX Live CDs into their books and print a
    copyright on them (like the TeX Live CD in 'LaTeX fuer Dummies' is
    marked as (c) MITP and - up to my knowledge, at least Volker claimed
    it - similar for the one in Springer's book about digitial
    typography) .

Any such copyright statement is invalid and illegal.  Not that I think
we should sue them over it :).

FYI, Addison-Wesley and Patrick Daly specifically asked me about a
copyright statement for the label for the TL they are including with the
forthcoming edition of the Guide to LaTeX.  I told them they should not
include one.  So hopefully that, at least, will be done correctly.

    So I would like to propose a slightly different LICENSE.DVD instead of the 

Your changes are reasonable as far as they go, but I'm concerned about
the proposal in general.  TL exists separately from CTAN, and CTAN
exists separately from TL.

So, instead of making ctan/ a subdirectory within the existing TL top
level, how about having a new top level, with ctan/, texlive/, and a
README?  This makes the distinction much clearer, IMHO.  Are there
technical reasons why another directory level would not work?

If ctan/ must be within the TL top level, then I will write a separate
README and LICENSE (based on yours) specifically for the DVD.  The TL
files need to stay as they are, because the TL CD's, after all, will not
have ctan included.

Thanks,
karl

What about translated notes as it was last year for CTAN collection?
Can you send me all the text from the inner part?

Not technical, but practical. I'm sorry but I'm against that as it needs
changing the documentation, etc. As you know, that's the hardest point.

What?  It's exactly *because* I don't want to change the documentation
that I suggested ctan/ and texlive/ be siblings.

Did you mention something about this ctan/ directory somewhere in the

See chapter 2 in the original tldoc about the layout.
It is already a note that DVD contains CTAN snapshot.

Sure.  But that says nothing about directory structures.
(I deliberately wrote it that way, in fact.)

ctan/ and texlive/ can be siblings and that statement in tldoc would
still be correct.  And making them siblings will make the separation
clear.

 \subsection{Top level directories}

 Here is a brief listing and description of the top level directories in
 the \TeXLive{} distribution.

Not that I love discussing, but:
1. we need changed MakeImages.sh, autorun.ini for Windows, etc.
2. install parts for Unix, MacOSX and Windows refer to the top level
   directories (after mounting DVD the user cannot find eg. install-tl.sh
   or (later) install-pkg.sh). All such changes should be explained in 
   tldoc.
3. nobody knows other traps...

Karl, sorry

the sad thing is that this discussion could have happened
6 months ago :-}

I have to agree with Staszek that all the
documentation and past experience is that TeX Live is at the
root of the CD or DVD. I am reluctant to assume that all scripts
and programs will have been written correctly to allow
for other arrangements, not to mention things like notes in Kopka's
book.

Although Karl is right, that it makes a real mess, the
"ctan" subdirectory is easier to deal with (by clear documentation) than
the alternative, isn't it?

Hello friends!

Now that we have eomega in texlive, it would be nice to have a elambda,
too. I just did it myself with inieomega (or was it einiomega, or
iniomegae ;-). 

Advantage: It works, contrary to the current omega which has a lot of
bugs! I can process a big (500p) document without "Capacity exceeded".

THere should be an adaption of the searchpathes (einiomega does not find
lambda.ini/.tex), and maybe more I do not know off.

Best wishes

It should be completed. Normally, they need 10--14 days for printing
the cover (that's why my time schedule is narrower) and 3--5 days
for burning.

I will mail a pointer to the complete cover when it is ready.
In general, I will follow the scheme from CTAN covers, so there
will be a German and English text on the back, one page with the
LUG list, three pages filled half with the list of Lehmanns'
shops. I will have to think about what to put on the other halfs of
these three pages. In past, there where some questions and answers
about the CTAN snapshot in German and English, last year also in
French and Polish. I will try to find something similar, like
"Where is the setup program?" or "What documentation shall I read?".
So I am still open to ideas.

> And do these dates include the CTAN CD set?

Not yet. That shall start after the DVD is ready and will take at
least one or two weeks. Manfred told me that the snapshot is now
5 GB (1 GB more than last year), so it will be more challenging than
last year to shrink it to CD.
Was the CD set meant as an addition to TeX Live demo and installation
CDs? In this case 900 MB fptex and tetex could be removed -- as it shall be
the case for the DVD since it is allready part of TeX Live.

Let's hope the best :-)
Fortunately (not only because of copyright, it was a perfect candidate
for the "Worst LaTeX book ever" award, too), the Dummies book was removed
from the German book list and is now sold at discounters for
remainders of out-of-print books only. Somehow surprising, as it was
published less than one year ago, but there were rumours about
another bookauthor claiming plagiarism.

That was Manfred's first idea, but keeping the original file structure
from TL DVD image and just adding a ctan directory seemed to be easier 
in my opinion, as it should prevent from fixing autorun things for
Windows or change of documentation (that would have to distinguish
between a DVD someone burned from the TL DVD image on TUG server and a
TeX Collection DVD, right?), and the probability for something getting
broken should be smaller when only adding something than changing the
directory structure.

Ok, good to know that too.  Thanks.

    5 GB (1 GB more than last year), so it will be more challenging than
    last year to shrink it to CD.

Perhaps need to have an additional CD.  (I realize that would make the
price higher, but ... whatever has to be done.)

    Was the CD set meant as an addition to TeX Live demo and
    installation CDs? 

No, people could potentially order only CTAN and no TL, so I think it'd
be good to leave tetex/fptex on there.  Sorry.

    keeping the original file structure
    from TL DVD image and just adding a ctan directory seemed to be easier 

Ok, agreed.  I will create the additional top-level README & LICENSE
files for the DVD (only) shortly.

OK, I cannot provide a full package since I do not know what we need.
But I have seen that in win32 there is already an elambda, so I made the
following (diffs are attached):

* lambda AND eomega all occur in the omega.tpm and bin-omega.tpm, so
  I added elambda to the binaries in bin-omega.tpm. Interestingly
  for win32 there is already a elambda.exe!!!
	bin-omega.tpm.diff
	omega.tpm.diff
* added search path in texmf.cnf
	texmf.cnf.diff
* added line to fmtutil.cnf
	fmtutil.cnf.diff

What is missing:
* links in all the binary directories
	i can do this
* More important: An adaption of source{.development}/.../Makefile.in
  or ../eomega/eomega.mk (or whatever) that the links and the dumps
  are done automatically. All the stuff is already in the Makefiles,
  it only has to be entered into one of the install targets. But I
  don't know where. Maybe Fabrice or someone else can do this.

PLease can one of you:
* check the diffs -- not much work, they are straight forward!
and if you accept:
* make the changes to the makefiles
* tell me that I make the links


I tested texmf.cnf and fmtutil here on alpha-linux and called
	fmtutil --byname elambda
which worked and also called elambda (to see that everything is found).

I hope this will help to get it into texlive.

Best wishes

I think that Norbert has good arguments for including elambda, so 
just small corrections to his .diff files:
for fmtutil.cnf
<elambda		eomega		language.dat	*lambda.ini
>elambda		eomega		language.dat	*elambda.ini

texmf/eomega/lambda/config/elambda.ini 
should be the copy of lambda.ini

if you just borrow lambda.ini, your change to texmf.cnf could be
inappropriate
TEXINPUTS.elambda = .;$TEXMF/{eomega,omega,tex}/{lambda,latex,generic,}//
since making elambda will find nothing in $TEXMF/eomega/

Can you make all those changes? Including soft links in bin/<arch>
tpm and lists/ files.
Changes to source is another problem...

I hope that all that mess with many directories, formats, texmf.cnf
entries should be cured for next TL/teTeX following Thomas Esser 
suggestions from 7 Aug 2003.

The others are OK? Especially the change in omega.tpm with
	<TPM:Execute function="BuildFormat" parameter="elambda"/>
is completely pure c&p.

Why? That line would expand to:
	... $TEXMF/eomega/// ...
since there is a
	,}//
at the end. Am I wrong here? In fact it was just a copy/merge of lambda
and eomega lines.

Ahh, I forgot the lists/omega, here we have now the elambda.ini file
added. And the 
	!BuildFormat elambda

BTW: WHY is there no
	BuildFormat line for eomega
in lists/omega and tpm/packages/omega.tpm?

Best wishes

Not so important because the format can be built during the first run
of elambda

As we have now something to search for in $TEXMF/eomega, this line makes
sense ;-}

Subject: [tex-live] Acrobat reader on DVD???
Message-ID: <200309121928.26885.manfred.lotz@web.de>

Hi folks,

This week Hans Hagen suggested to put Acrobat Reader on DVD, i.e. for Linux, 
Win and Mac. Hans also suggested to include version 5 and 6 for Windows as 
well as some asian versions (what is needed?).

Subject: [tex-live] ConTeXt and embedded spaces with 5 Sept. TeXLive rc
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.95.iB1.0.1030912143545.14073B-100000@halifax.chebucto.ns.ca>

A couple issues with the handling of embedded spaces on Win32 systems
should be noted.  One looks like a real bug, the other boils down to the
way context handles embedded spaces in filenames.  

On Win32, the following (from texexec.pl) sometimes fails
to find texexec.ini (all on one line):

C:> kpsewhich -progname=context -format="other text files"
texexec.ini 

This seems to happen on Win98 when the current directory has an embedded
space in the last component.

A second oddity to trip the unwary:

ConTeXt texexec sets a variable to $ENV{"HOME"} in filename.tmp:

$ cat try.tex
\starttext
\input story
\stoptext
$ texexec try
$ cat try.tmp
% try.top 
\unprotect
\setupsystem[\c!gebied={/user/gwhite/}]
\setupsystem[\c!n=1] 
\setupsystem[inputfile=try.tex] 
\protect

On Win32, executables manufactured from perl scripts using irun appear to
get a HOME variable, even if none is set in the environment, and which
will typically contain embedded spaces.  ConTeXt will add a little gift at
the end of your document: "X//cont-err", where X is the part after the
embedded space.  This is really a ConTeXt problem, but may come as a
surprise to someone who has been using context with an external perl
and/or on unix.

    This week Hans Hagen suggested to put Acrobat Reader on DVD, i.e. for Linux,

    well as some asian versions (what is needed?).

Their license agreement also has other conditions which seem
unacceptable to me, for instance, the "new versions" section says we
have to cease distributing version x within 6 months after version x+1
comes out.  We could not stop distributing TL2003 just because Adobe
comes out with a new version.

(I personally also find the "no reverse engineering" clause very
obnoxious, forcing us to give up our rights in advance.)

So for those reasons, I don't think we should do this.  Annoying as it

One other thing, item #13 in the license says Adobe can audit you,
including inspecting your books.  And you're supposed to keep track of
how many copies you distribute.

I don't think that is plausible at all, in our case.

It is about locale environment and tcx map file. Several people tried to
warn about it, but they do not seem to have been heard (comprised by myself).

It is unacceptable to distribute the tex binaries the way they work for
the moment. What will happen in all countries using some
iso-latin-something 8bits alphabet: typein the following simple document

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document

\tableofcontents

\section{L'?dition}
Bla bla bla ...
\end{document}

You will end up with a
^^e9 instead of a ? in the .toc file, and that's what French users will get in
their documents.

_It is stated nowhere that you need to run TeX with
-translate-file=cp8bit _

Moreover, you can't ask people to change their .tex files to add the
option in the first comment line of the file to be processed correctly.

We have to find an acceptable solution so that people can continue
typeset their documents as they were able to do it with previous
versions of the TeXLive.

Last remark about this : it is true that by adding some first line like :

%! translate-file=cp8bit

to the document, you will be able to process it correctly. But I
personally  find it a bit cumbersome to have to specify twice that you
are using an iso-latin1 encoding.

Second problem is the copyright problem.

As far as I understand there are a couple of books that are waiting to
include texlive 2003. 

I have seen a copy of 'Digital Typography Using LaTeX' which includes a
TeXLive cd-rom (special edition prepared for the book).

The copyright text inside the book states that you are not
permitted to copy or distribute the cdrom. Neither the text in the book
or the copyright says that the cdrom is a free product. There is no mention of
TUG or LUGs existence and the fact this product is the result of the
work of many people and that it would be welcome for the reader of the
book to join one of the user groups. Worse, people buying the book are
even complaining that they have bought the cdrom and that we should help
them using it. Some of them thought they had to buy the book  to get the
cdrom.

[ By the way, Apostolos Syropoulos is one of the book authors and is in
charge of organising TUG2004. I wonder what are his interests in
organising such a conference when he is even not ready to advertise TUG
when he is publishing a book about TeX but that's another story.]

I have been told there are at least 3 other books (Addison-Wesley, MIT Press)
which have been published with the TL cdrom and such copyright notices.

I find it _unacceptable_. So my opinion is that:

- I'm writing a message to RMS explaining what the problem is and asking
if the FSF can help us (or at least me and the ones willing to be
involved in it) in dealing with this past situation (suing editors ? or
at least threatening them).

- I don't want to put any Windows version of the programs on TL2003 if
nothing is done to _prevent people to steal the copyright this way_.

You can expect me to make as much noise as possible about this
situation.

Hmm, I get in the toc file:

Does not change anything here.

But in fact I thought there will be ? in the toc file and not \'e

Ok, I was right assuming it would be the same under LaTeX and under
ConTeXt/Plain TeX, because inputenc seems to change the way accented
characters are handled.

But try this foo.tex :

% Langue et codage
%-----------------
\useencoding[ffr]
\mainlanguage[fr]
\enableregime[il1]  % idem inputenc=latin1


\starttext
\startbuffer[foo]
Essayons des accents : ??????????
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[foo]
\stoptext

and do 'texexec --pdf foo'

The fact is that characters that are written to file by TeX are using
the ^^ notation, because they are not affected by the locale anymore.

indeed, inputenc writes 8-bit characters to files in
encoding-independent form (LICR - LaTeX Internal Character
Representation), which is independent of any locale, which is the only
portable way to deal with this: font encoding might be often different
from input encoding, and there may be several font encodings used in a
document (as well as several input encodings too).

does this create serious problems for these formats (Plain/ConTeXt)?
i.e. when they read characters in ^^ notation, are the results
different from reading the corresponding 8-bit characters? BTW, the ^^
notation has been the default in TeX for the 8-bit characters for a
long time. so if someone wishes to change to non-standard way TeX
writes 8-bit chars to files, why not use the non-standard option like
--translate-file ?

Best,

For the moment and for ConTeXt, I would say yes.

My point is:

- we have a texlive 8 whose behaviour is different for the texlive 7 is
this aspect, that should be at least stated

- if tex pretends to be eight bits compatible, I  don't see any point in
keeping this ^^ notation. If it reads 0xe9 in a file,  it should be able
to write it too.

Patrick Gundlach and Daniel Flipo at least had problems with that issue (or
that's what I have been told). Maybe they can comment about it.

I am entirely in agreement with Fabrice about the unacceptableness of
this. I am less clear what we can do about it at this stage. Plainly we
_want_ people to copy the CD _ad lib_, and indeed we cannot stop them
doing so. The LICENSE file can contain more and more loud warnings,
but in the end, all we can do is take people who violate the copyright
to court.

I will write to the people I know who are involved in this area.

It appears that some books have been published with a copy of TeX Live
included (for instance, last year's "Digital Typography Using LaTeX"),
and that the publishers have placed a standard copyright statement on
the CD saying that copying and redistribution is not permitted.

Can I ask those of you about to publish books to check your designs, and
make sure that it is stated very clearly that the CD contains free/open
source software, and that NO CONDITIONS CAN BE PLACED ON COPYING OR
REDISTRIBUTION? Ideally the labelling would actively mention the TeX
User Groups which have produced the CD.

I am not sure what to do about "Digital Typography using LaTeX". Maybe
we should be looking at taking the publisher to court on this.
Apostolos, could you let me know the name of your contact at the
publishing company?

One of the TeX Live developers proposes that we should simply halt
production of the CD/DVD entirely, if we cannot be sure that people will
follow the copyright.

No.  That would make it non-free.

We cannot stop ignorant and/or unethical companies from making invalid
or illegal statements in advance.  Nor do I think that this is a reason
to penalize all the honest companies, not to mention individuals, not to
mention user groups, by not producing or not working on TeX Live any
more.

By analogy, the GPL has been infringed many times, usually through
ignorance or misunderstanding.  When rms find out, he talks to them
about it and gets them to correct it (so far, without having to go to
court).  He doesn't stop working on the GNU project.

    You will end up with a
    ^^e9 instead of a é in the .toc file, and that's what French users will get in
    their documents.

So, in past versions of TL, the 0xe9 single character was written to the toc
using these options instead of the four ASCII characters ^^e9?

    - we have a texlive 8 whose behaviour is different for the texlive 7 is
    this aspect, that should be at least stated

I must be missing something.  I just tried it (on Linux), and the
resulting .toc file for *both* TL7 and the current TL2003 contains is
this:

\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}L'\'edition}{1}

That is, the pre-accented e has been changed into the \' accent control
sequence.

I did not use any options when running latex, and used the file exactly
as you sent it (except I added the missing } on the \begin{document :).
(It's /tmp/testfr.tex on tug.org.)

?

    - if tex pretends to be eight bits compatible, I don't see any point
    in keeping this ^^ notation. If it reads 0xe9 in a file, it should
    be able to write it too.

It should be able to, but it seems to me it should not do so by
default; that would invalidate the TeXbook, not to mention fail the trip
test.  Doing so with a cmdline option specified or a package loaded
seems ok.

However, in terms of TL2003 production at this late date, the crucial
question is not what the ideal behavior should be, but what has changed
wrt 2003.

Hi all,

Yes, I warned on the tcx files problem in LaTeX on this list
some time ago (I 'll get the exact message on Monday 
at the Uni, I can't from home).  I remember, I suggested then
that the option '-translate-file=cpx8bit.tcx' should  somehow be
included by default when calling LaTeX for TL2003 to behave
as TL7.

The problem occurs in LaTeX --- not in .toc files as Fabrice
wrongly said --- but when 8bit chars are written to a file 
(? is written as ^^e9) and input back verbatim.
This is ---for instance ---- what the 'example' 
environment from the lshort files does. I append a short 
test file.  With TL2003, you get  ^^e9 printed instead of '?',
with TL7 you got '?' printed as expected.

Hans Hagen also told me that he has problems with tocs
in ConTeXt, I'll let him or Patrick comment on that as I am
a beginner in ConTeXt.

    So what? Lots of software available for free have a different license
    scheme (Aladdin, Apache, whatever). I don't think it penalizes anybody.

Sure, of course there are many free software licenses, most of which are
represented on TL :).  However, the implications for each license have
to be taken individually.

The kind of license you proposed, not allowing certain entities (such as
for-profit companies) to redistribute, is not compatible with the GPL or
the LPPL (or any other Debian-compatible license).  So I don't see how
we could possibly use it.

The "Aladdin Free Public License" is not a free software license,
because it prohibits charging for distribution, among other issues.
So I hope we are using GNU Ghostscript (last release 7.07), not Aladdin
Ghostscript (8.11) on TL!

Apache is a free software license but incompatible with the GPL.  So I
hope that, for example, none of the Web2c binaries are linked with any
Apache-covered code, because that would not be legal.  (As far as I
know, there is no Apache-covered code in TeX Live.)

One good source for license compatibility information is
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html

    I'm not the one who suggested stopping working on TeXLive.

I'm glad to hear that!

    at least without a decent acknowledgement of what is involved, and
    an advertisement that this is a _free_ product.

According to the general principles of the free software licenses, no
one may put their own proprietary copyright on the whole of TL.  That is
illegal.  So any publisher who has done that needs to be contacted and
some sort of settlement worked out.

However, the other things you've mentioned, such as donating to the user
groups, or even simply acknowledging the user groups, are not legal
requirements.  They would certainly be desirable and courteous actions,
but they cannot be made requirements of free software.

    NO CONDITIONS CAN BE PLACED ON COPYING OR REDISTRIBUTION? 

Sebastian, I hate to say it, but that is not exactly the correct
statement to make.  There *are* conditions (in GPL cases among others),
namely that the software remains free.

If you feel the need to make any statement at all, perhaps something
like this:
  TeX Live contains only free software, meaning in general that you may
  copy, modify, and redistribute the software therein without explicit
  permission or payment.  However, the exact details differ for each
  software package, so please consider each individually when making
  changes or redistributing.

One thing that is definitely *not* permitted is to claim your own
copyright on TeX Live as a whole, and disallow modification and
redistribution.

Of course you can use any license you want for your own work that is
completely independent of what is on TL, but if the license is not
Debian-compatible, please do not call the result simply "TeX Live"; that
leads to horrible confuson.

There is no single entity which holds the copyright on the TeX Live
compilation.  It is comprised of hundreds of individual works.
Therefore, as a practical matter, the only reasonable thing to do is
omit any copyright statement of TL as a whole.  

    I am not sure what to do about "Digital Typography using LaTeX". Maybe
    we should be looking at taking the publisher to court on this.

Before doing something as drastic as going to court, of course we should
attempt to settle the situation amicably.  In all likelihood (based on
what I know of GPL infringements in the past), it was an innocent
mistake, albeit a very serious one.

Sure. 

Apart from 'Digital Typography Using LaTeX', there has been a German

At the very minimum. But that needs some thinking.

Is the lmodern package crucial to this test?  I do not have lmodern

When I comment out \usepackage{lmodern} and run your test8bit.tex with
my TL7 latex (with no cmdline options) under linux, the resulting

Do you mean cp8bit.tcx in particular?  I don't see cpx8bit.tcx nor any

I could imagine programming a default of cp8bit.tcx easily enough,
but won't that cause incompatibilities in other ways?  I mean, how about
a simple plain TeX:
\immediate\openout1 = foo.exa
\write1{L'été est fini.}

Does that write ^^ notation for you?  It does for me, in both TL7 and

happen.

In  a  sense,  I see this  business   as doomed then.  As  soon  as your
development   cost  will raise  and  reach  some   amount  of  money (no
indication of the amount), you won't  be able to steal resources anymore
(time, bandwidth etc.)  from the group and you will fail to go on. 

I won't go for a philosophical discussion about it, we need a practical
solution. What I would like to hear is the opinion of as many LUG members as
possible of what to do in the future.

Hi Apostolos,

    Exactly! Production people put the same label on every CD that
    comes with a book. 

I figured as much.  However, that does not alter the fact that such a
copyright statement is illegal and cannot be allowed to stand.  We need
some sort of remedy, a statement that TL is free software and not
copyrighted by Springer, that anyone getting the CD has the usual
permissions, etc.  The exact wording will obviously take some time to
construct.

Such a statement could presumably easily be put on the web pages for the
book (I mean the ones that are under yours and/or Springer's control).

As well, I don't know if it's practical to put a sticker over the
existing CD labels.  If so, that would be ideal.  If not, then a sticker
on any unsold books is the next best thing I can think of.

What do you think?

indeed, that should happen by default. in TL7, however, if i'm
correct, the behavior was dependent on the current locale, and Fabrice
may have got another result if he run tex in a locale in which sone
8-bit characters are declared as printable. under the "C" locale,
TL7's TeX behaved as described in the TeXbook.

I hope that TeX in TL2003 is no more dependent on locale (which would
be nonsense from the document portability point of view), and by
default uses the ^^ notation to output 8-bit chars, allowing to change
this with the (non-standard) --translate-file option.

Best,

TL7 won't give you this result if your locale is set to FR_fr (or
whatever syntax you should use). It will write an '?' in the file.

I agree that it is wrong from the TeXbook point of view, but there are a
couple of LaTeX packages that write and input  files verbatim like the
ones based on 'comment', some of them for example to typeset exams
with/without the answers and stuff like this.

At the minimum, this change is not (yet) documented.

Ah, thanks (to you too, Vladimir, for pointing this out).  Now I can
reproduce the problem, by setting LC_ALL=french.

    At the minimum, this change is not (yet) documented.

We can certainly document the change.

But the real question is, is the new behavior (and the resulting broken
packages) acceptable in practice?  From what you and Daniel reported, it
sounded like the problem was more widespread than a couple of verbatim
environments.

If it is, perhaps we need to go back to the TL7 behavior, one way or
another, and fix the various packages and programs for next year, and
reinstate the change then.  (Always assuming there is a next year.)

It does seem to me, as Vladimir said, that document processing depending
on the locale setting is bad for portability, and so the change is good
from that point of view.  But this is not my area of expertise, so I am
not sure of all the ramifications.

The ^^ notation may spoil tables of contents, indexes (as well as confuse 
sorting programs) and other multi-pass solutions, as well as (in the case 
of context) buffering, content reuse, indirect verbatim, and (when 8 but is 
used) javascript and metapost support as well.

I can live with ^^ to the terminal (screen) and log file (although it will 
make tex look quite rediculous and backward in some cases), but with 
regards to writing to file ... 8 bit == 8 bit; if users want ^^ in there 
writes as well, they could always use a filter (i.e. why bother the 
majority of 8 bit tex users with the need to specify a translate filter for 
the benefit of a small group of ^^ users)

how about something along these lines:

(1) publishers may include tex live but only as-is; since it's a packaged 
product, this means: the cdrom as it looks now, so no special 
publisher/book specific cover

(2) if they want a special version with a one liner mentioning their name, 
they can ask the tex live group for a master of a cd as well as the 
inprint; since they are quite accustomed to paying for services, they can 
be asked to pay a nominal fee for this

(3) they may in no way claim any copyrights, and should mention explicitly 
where one can get / download a cd i.e. the latest version etc. (this text 
can replace the copyright text they put there now); i can imagine that the 
tl team / user groups prescribe the text

(4) i can even imagine that they 'buy' the cd's for an acceptable price 
since that makes them aware of the fact that efforts like this need support 
(it especially makes sense since these publishers are not that willing to 
respond positively to requests for sponsoring tex conferences).

In all, it would make a real difference if it was the tex live as it is now 
(with the running lion) instead of some vague cover (which much have cost 
them money to make) without any mentioning of tex live and its authors.

I think that we can make a distiction. As far as i know, it has been free 
software people pushing the tl people to the limits in ensuring everything 
to be free. I'm pretty sure that all those linux vendors who demands the 
tex things to be free, don't permit users to copy and sell their 
cdroms/dvd's. So, there is a difference between the product (software) 
being free and copying the whole thing as is and selling it.

I think that it's pretty legal in the sense of free software to put some 
demands in the perspective of protecting users. For instance: the DTUL 
cdrom has a pre tex live 7 version so what kind of support are user groups 
expected to give? Demands could be: the cd as it is (with lion and inprint) 
and a written statement about its origin, authors and permissions. Many of 
our users are not experts in repackeging (read: sebastians, thomasses and 
fabrices), but depend on those people who spent time doing this. User 
groups should safeguard proper usage and publishers should listen to them.

So, maybe distributing tex live should be closely connected to how it is 
distributed in order to function in the arena of user groups.

there is no clear next year fix except from the filter (well, i can 
probably hack texexec and context to handle things by preprocessing the 
source code) but i think that if we go that way, 8 bit offsprings of tex 
will going to be used; we're living in an 8 bit world (actually unicode 
world, but taht's another station).

i wonder what triggered the chance; if it's really true that writing to a 
file is influences by locale settings, then the user should get rid of that 
setting or patch his OS; imagine that perl's file writes would depend on 
locales this way ...

i assume that it's not our intention to send a team of helpers around the 
world to help people add some fuzzy first line or do worse things; at least 
i'm not willing to do that;

(btw, i wonder if all the tcx files were adapted to the change)

I don't understand this: 8-bit-in equals 8-bit-out, that's quite portable 
if there is *no* translation; in my opinion any translation makes the 
document unportable; locales are an OS-thing and it's the OS that makes the 
document unportable, not tex!

Maybe the tex binary could just disable locales for file writes (aren't 
file writes supposed to be binary?)

still, the publisher should know that he's pretty wrong, so if we write the 
others there is no reason not to copy the LFD one; we should treat all

I think that we (you) should somehow come up with a budget, even if it's 
imaginary. It's as with the internet servers, user groups happen to get 
bandwidth for free, but actually it should be in their budgets.

If we know (at least can visualize) that a tex live version costs say 
150.000 euro per year, and that by chance we seem to get people's time for 
free, at least we have a number to mention to third parties. It would be 
easier then to ask publishers who put the cd in their book for some 
compensation (keep in mind that they budget books, so for them it would 
simply mean another budget item in a long list of items for a book).

Also, it would permit us to seek funding for those whose employer wants 
compensation (currently tl-win is on borrowed time from the xemtex project) 
and i dunny in what bends sebastian has to twist in order to get things 
done. In any case we could then at least recognize the work and send some 
thank you letters to the organizations involved.

(also, users (groups) should be aware that the few euros is just for 
production)

This is where I do not agree. TeX being 8-bit 'clean', it should allow
to read/write unsigned chars. 

And there is   an  easy fix  to achieve    this.  If  you look at    the
setupcharset  function in  texmfmp.c, we could just say that if no
translate_filename has been specified, we use cp8bit.tcx .

The second part has been disabled on purpose, because it initialized the
isprintable[] array on the locale basis (which is wrong).

in my opinion, macro packages should write to files in encoding
independent form (e.g. like the LaTeX does) - that's really portable.

if you write as 8-bit chars, TeX will write FONT ENCODING character
which may be quite different from input encoding, so reading back
those 8-bit characters is useless.

but if you still need to write 8-bit chars - you're free to use the
--translate-file option.

the ^^-notation is standard *default* of TeX behavior as defined by
Don Knuth.

what i was saying that TeX run should not depend on locale: it should

locales...

locales and ^^-notation are not the same thing... i agree that TeX's
behavior should not depend on locale. if one needs to use binary
output to files, you can use TCX...

Sorry, it doesn't change anything that you decide to write ^^E9 (4
bytes) or 0XE9 (1 byte) in the file, providing it has been opened in
binary mode. There is no font encoding there, and no locales either. It
is only a matter of what you initialize the is_printable[] array with.

    the ^^-notation is standard *default* of TeX behavior as defined by
    Don Knuth.

Vladimir, I thought this too.  But it seems not to be the case.  I just
looked up all the index entries for ^^ in my copy of the TeXbook (21st
printing, 1992).  The most relevant one is on p.370, at the end of
Appendix C, and the text there says:
  
    (6)~There is a special convention for representing characters 0--255
    in the hexadecimal forms |^^00|--|^^ff|, explained in
    Chapter~8. This convention is always acceptable as input, when |^|
    is any character of catcode~7. Text output is produced with this
    convention only when representing characters of code $\ge128$ that a
    \TeX\ installer has chosen not to output directly.

Note that last line, "installer has chosen".

So it seems that it is ok with DEK to choose to output all codes >= 128 
as-is.  And it seems that this is the best thing to do in practice, too,
for the reasons Hans and Fabrice have been talking about.

This still implies a change from TL7: with no locale setting, TL7 output
8-bit chars with ^^; TL2003, will output them as-is.  I doubt this will
hurt anything, since any documents that worked with 8-bit chars from the
main input will work with 8-bit chars from an auxiliary file.

Of course it would be possible to construct documents that worked with
TL7 but failed before, but it seems merely theoretical, as opposed to
the present TL2003, which outputs ^^ unless -translate-file is
specified, which will definitely break a number of real existing documents.

What do you think?

(Of course we should still document the change, whichever change we end
up making.)

i'm inclined to agree. the corresponding section 49 from tex.web is:

=========================
@ The first 128 strings will contain 95 standard ASCII characters, and the
other 33 characters will be printed in three-symbol form like `\.{\^\^A}'
unless a system-dependent change is made here. Installations that have
an extended character set, where for example |xchr[@'32]=@t\.{\'^^Z\'}@>|,
would like string @'32 to be the single character @'32 instead of the
three characters @'136, @'136, @'132 (\.{\^\^Z}). On the other hand,
even people with an extended character set will want to represent string
@'15 by \.{\^\^M}, since @'15 is |carriage_return|; the idea is to
produce visible strings instead of tabs or line-feeds or carriage-returns
or bell-rings or characters that are treated anomalously in text files.
                                                                                                   
Unprintable characters of codes 128--255 are, similarly, rendered
\.{\^\^80}--\.{\^\^ff}.
                                                                                                   
The boolean expression defined here should be |true| unless \TeX\
internal code number~|k| corresponds to a non-troublesome visible
symbol in the local character set.  An appropriate formula for the
extended character set recommended in {\sl The \TeX book\/} would, for
example, be `|k in [0,@'10..@'12,@'14,@'15,@'33,@'177..@'377]|'.
If character |k| cannot be printed, and |k<@'200|, then character |k+@'100| or
|k-@'100| must be printable; moreover, ASCII codes |[@'41..@'46,
@'60..@'71, @'141..@'146, @'160..@'171]| must be printable.
Thus, at least 80 printable characters are needed.

=========================

perhaps it would be good to be able to make TeX behave according to
this default specified by Knuth, as well as the suggested
"full-8-bit-output".

maybe this can be done via texmf.cnf as a system-wide setting, - then
it will be possible to get whatever behavior one wants by default -
either the one suggested in the TeXbook, or the "full-8-bit-output".
maybe TeX should read some TCX file, say, default.tcx which will be
either cp8bit or will make only the chars in the range 32-126
printable (but it should not be acceptable to use non-ID maps which
contain nontrivial maps as system-wide setting)...

Best,

As the simplest solution for this release, reading the file default.tcx
seems sensible to me, instead of introducing configuration file changes.
But either way.

And I agree with having something like a 7bit.tcx to get the default ^^
behavior, since it's presumably easy to do and provides a fallback for
any documents out there that might be depending on that behavior.

The crucial point is that, one way or another, cp8bit.tcx will end up
being used by default.  And the system locale settings (LC_ALL and the
like) do not influence TeX's behavior.  Right?

so, something:

write_mode = 0  % 0-255        as is
write_mode = 1  % 0-31         in ^^ notation
write_mode = 2  % 0-31 128-255 in ^^ notation
write_mode = 3  % whatever the locale wants

with write_mode = 0 being the default

say that (in context) one says:

   \startbuffer
   abcd\eacute <8bitchar representing \eacute> ^^ef
   \stopbuffer

(the buffer is written to file) and then later on:

   \typebuffer

(which reads the file) now, what is supposed to end up typeset? The literal 
code between \startbuffer and stopbuffer, so \eacute (as string) the o bit 
char, and ^^ef (literal). if the <8bitchar> was expanded to \eacute or ^^ef 
then that would be typeset verbatim since there is no way (unless one 
starts adding additional code to trigger things in which case some kind of 
escape character would be needed). This in itself would present other 
problems, think of:

\startbuffer
<tag>some text including 8 bit chars</tag>
\stopbuffer

here context can handle the buffer as verbatim text, tex text, xml ... or 
think of

\startMPcode
draw btex whatever kind of french accented text you want etex ;
\stopMPcode

or

\startJScode
   str = "something in pdfdoc encoding with 8 but chars"
\stopJScode

so, control over what gets 'expanded' or 'translated' is up to the 
application (macro package) and it really depends on what one is dealing 
with (internally context uses named glyphs for typeset material) and for 
this purpose 8 bit in is 8 bit out. Otherwise we would force all other (non 
tex) applications to think like tex when reading data (with ^^'s) which i 
think is no real option -)

The key words here are that it is a ``special edition prepared for the 
book.'' It is normal procedure for publishing companies to place 
copyright restrictions on specific imprints of publications. In this 
sense a CD containing a computer program is an imprint belonging to the 
publisher, and therefore comes under their copyright. The copyright 
laws of most countries vary to some degree, so it is necessary to 
determine which country produced the book, first.

In New Zealand the law is based on precedents established in England, 
Australia and to a lesser extent, the US. The law in this context 
identifies that copyright can be exercised on a specific imprint of a 
publication if the content belongs to the public domain, i.e. the 
copyright has passed from the author after the requisite period of 
time, or the publisher owns the copyright in that it was transferred 
from the author, i.e. the publisher bought the rights to copy from the 
author.

It may be that in this case the publisher will contend that the content 
exists in the public domain and is theirs to do with as they will. You 
therefore need to argue that it is not in the public domain and the 
copyright exists for specific named people or organisations. when you 
have sufficiently argued the case then you may sue for `loss of 
earnings' as a percentage of the income the publisher has derived from 
including the CD with the book -- of course you will need to 
demonstrate that the CD added a certain amount of value to the 
publication, it is this difference you can claim on.

This is a courtesy issue, on the part of the publisher. They are not 
presently obligated to do this, so why not make the necessary changes 
to the distribution rights contained with the CD that such `offers' 
must accompany any mass distribution of the content.

In this case, direct those people back to the publisher. If they wish 
to maintain copyright over the imprint they have distributed then they 
should also maintain customer concerns related to that same imprint.

Good on Apostolos for putting himself out and earning an income from 
something he has clearly invested a lot in. But he is not responsible 
for what the publisher does with their distribution channels. Anyone 
who has been involved with publishers will know they can be awful 
entities to deal with and will exercise their own concerns before 
giving authors the time of day.

If TeX is to grow in popularity and expand its user base then it is 
better to find ways to work with these people, not to alienate them. 
Editors do not publish books, publishers do.

Whacking off the nose will not make the face more appealing. Rather it 
will turn away those people who expect to see a nose there. What about 
TUG members who expect to get a CD with their membership and that use 
MS Windows, why penalise them?

Just a few thoughts on the matter.

Alan, thank you for writing.  I agree with almost everything you say.
But this statement:

    It is normal procedure for publishing companies to place 
    copyright restrictions on specific imprints of publications.

That is true, but in the case at hand, I really do not believe that
publishers get to put their copyright restrictions on others' work
simply because they included it on a CD in their book.

Of course, if the authors and/or publisher actually developed material
that is included on the CD, they can use any copyright they wish, under
the "mere aggregation" clause in the various free licenses.

But that is a completely different matter than putting their copyright
on the whole collection, comprised of free software which they
themselves did not develop.  The only reason they have permission to
redistribute it at all is because of the free licenses (otherwise it's
"all rights reserved"), and those licenses clearly prohibit claiming it
proprietary.

This is a fundamental tenet of the free licenses.  If it could be
overthrown by something as simple as putting a CD inside a book, free
software would not exist.

k

P.S. I'd once again like to plead that we postpone all this
licensing stuff until after the release.

    m pretty sure that all those linux vendors who demands the 
    tex things to be free, don't permit users to copy and sell their 
    cdroms/dvd's. 

Yes they do.

Sometimes Linux vendors add proprietary software to their distributions,
and resellers have to remove the proprietary portions.  But the basic
GNU/Linux system, covered by the GPL and other free software licenses,
may be resold by anyone for any price under any packaging.

    so what kind of support are user groups expected to give? 

No warranty or support is implied or promised for *any* version of TL by
*any* user group or individual, as far as I know.  That's what the
licenses say, anyway.

    how about something along these lines:

The additional *requirements* you propose in (1), (2), and (4) are
incompatible with DFSG, e.g., the GPL and LPPL.  Impossible.

We can (and should, and do) request such common courtesy and common
sense from the publishers, but we cannot legally require it.  As for (3):

    (3) they may in no way claim any copyrights, 

Absolutely correct.  And we must defend our copyright against anyone who
erroneously does that.  

    and should mention explicitly where one can get / download a cd
    i.e. the latest version etc. (this text can replace the copyright
    text they put there now); i can imagine that the tl team / user
    groups prescribe the text

As a "should" sort of thing, I agree; but it cannot be a legal requirement.

    still, the publisher should know that he's pretty wrong, so if we
    write the others there is no reason not to copy the LFD one; we
    should treat all publishers in an uniform way

Agreed.

    just curious: may people copy debian cd's and sell them under their
    own name?

Yes.  There are companies which do this, and ones that resell Red Hat
too, and most likely all the major distributions.

This doesn't mean that they get to claim they wrote it, or remove any
authorship files, or to claim copyright on anything they didn't actually
develop themselves.  They absolutely do *not* get to do any of that.

However, a cd label or the overall collection name are not part of the
software, so there is no way to impose particular legal requirements.
That's part of what free software implies.  For instance, rms cannot
*require* everyone to call the-most-widely-used-free-os "GNU/Linux"; he
can only request.

I will attempt to reply to this thread at some leisure.
It is of great interest to me in my role of an Open Source
Advisory Service.

One thing I must say, though, is that the TeX community
in general, and TeX Live, must decide whether or not
it really subscribes to the Free/Open Source philosophy.
It is an absolutely central tenet of this that we may NOT
place restrictions, conditions etc on anyone using the
software, for any purpose. So we write a program, and
some publisher makes millions from our work - that's
the way it goes!  Open source developers don't make
their money from selling software, or expect to
be recompensed directly for the time and resources.
Sound's harsh, and it is, but it's at the very core
of the free software movement!

Hi Karl,

It is so easy for the rights of the author to be snuffed. Publishers 
have practised this art for for the past three centuries.

The issue I mentioned was that the publisher has likely made the 
erroneous assumption that since the content is included on a CD that is 
itself published for free distribution, then the publisher can impose 
their own copyright restrictions upon that particular imprint. Their 
copyright would not extend to other imprints, but the onus is now on 
the community to extend its own rights upon the publisher, and to 
protect itself from such events in the future, make the necessary 
changes to distribution agreements so that the author community get 
appropriate recognition for their work and the cause of the community 
is advanced by way of promoting user groups, participation, etc.

I don't  think it will be hard to prove that the content
is not in the public domain. As I understand the law,
things only get in the public domain if the copyright holder
explicit puts it there, which is rather rare, or when the
copyright expires.

one could demand that the book be withdrawn
from sale, and warehouse copies be destroyed?
It is an interesting matter to speculate what
exactly one would ask for if it ever got to court!

Professionally speaking, I'd like to hear about legal
cases where the GPL or some other F/OSS license has been
upheld. Does anyone know of a good test case,
preferably in a UK or European court?

One last point before I go to bed and read a good book 
(not about TeX) - Karl is right that this issue
should not affect the release of TL2003 in any way,
apart from possibly making the top-level files
more explicit. 

as regards the "technical showstopper", I simply
confess that I don't understand the issue, and
probably never have in the past either. I leave
it to cleverer people than me to decide what to do.

There has never been a court case that has gone all the way to decision
involving the GPL or any other F/OSS license, anywhere in the world, as
far as I know.  I may be wrong, of course, but I think I would have
heard.  Eben Moglen, FSF counsel, mentioned once in an essay that
perhaps he would intentionally go to trial at some point, just to prove
that the GPL is enforceable once and for all, but this has not happened.

And I sincerely hope we do not have to go to court here, either.
(And I doubt we will.)
I do not want to spend my life that way, and furthermore, Springer
certainly has much deeper pockets than we do.

 HH> say that (in context) one says:

 HH>    \startbuffer
 HH>    abcd\eacute <8bitchar representing \eacute> ^^ef
 HH>    \stopbuffer

 HH> (the buffer is written to file) and then later on:

 HH> additional code to trigger things in which case some kind of
 HH> escape character would be needed).

exactly - verbatim environments are a special case compared to
"regular" writes which are supposed to be read back by TeX and by
writes supposed to be read by third-party applications.

in the above example, the portable way to write to file would be:

abcd\textbackslash eacute \'e \textasciicircum \textasciicircum ef

where \textbackslash typesets the `\' character and \textasciicircum
typesets the `^' character. when this is read back by TeX, it will
typeset verbatim what was between the \startbuffer and \stopbuffer.
and it is not hard to do that at the macro level...
(yes, here we use one escape character - `\').

and this is portable since it's independent on any input and font
encodings which might be arbitrary...

 HH> This in itself would present other problems, think of:

 HH> \startbuffer <tag>some text including 8 bit chars</tag>
 HH> \stopbuffer

 HH> here context can handle the buffer as verbatim text, tex text,
 HH> xml ...

writing files which are intended to be read by "3-rd party programs"
(not by TeX) is another case which could also be programmed at the
macro level - it's possible to make all characters expand "as is" for
such applications (then it will depend on cp8bit TCX to be able to
output raw 8-bit chars)... i.e., there are two kinds of writes - the
ones which are supposed to be read back by TeX (which should use
"portable" representation), and ones for "3-rd party programs" which
may/should use the 1-to-1 representation.

 HH> or think of

 HH> \startMPcode draw btex whatever kind of french accented text you
 HH> want etex ; \stopMPcode

well, btex ... etex is supposed to be processed by TeX, so the
"portable" encoding as in the first example should work just fine.

 HH> or

 HH> \startJScode str = "something in pdfdoc encoding with 8 but
 HH> chars" \stopJScode

thus us again something for 3rd party apps; actually, hyperref package
for LaTeX contains very good code which converts any string from LICR
to pdfdoc encoding.

 HH> so, control over what gets 'expanded' or 'translated' is up to
 HH> the application (macro package) and it really depends on what one
 HH> is dealing with

sure.

 HH> (internally context uses named glyphs for typeset material) and
 HH> for this purpose 8 bit in is 8 bit out. Otherwise we would force
 HH> all other (non tex) applications to think like tex when reading
 HH> data (with ^^'s) which i think is no real option -)

e.g. xindy can deal with the LICR... :)

Subject: [tex-live] copyright of texlive
Message-ID: <200309132315.h8DNFRH00671@f7.net>

    A LICENSE file is included in the CD. This file explains the
    whole situation.

Sure, but the whole point here is that Springer put on its own invalid
proprietary copyright.  We cannot let it stand unchallenged.

BTW, could someone scan the CD label and put it on the web somewhere?
The exact text would be useful to see.

    We can put this information on the book's Web page. I hope this is
    fine.

It is fine, and good, as far as it goes.  Thank you.
There is also Springer's web page:
http://www.springer.de/cgi/svcat/search_book.pl?isbn=0-387-95217-9&currency=Euro&language=English&lastResult=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.de%2Fsearch97cgi%2Fs97_cgi%3F%26fulltextQuery%3Ddigital%2Btypography%26fulltextOperator%3D%253C%2523AND%253E%26umlaute%3Don%26waehrung%3DEuro%26sortspec%3DErscheinungsjahr%2Bdesc%26action%3Dsearch%26collection%3Dcatalog_addition%26collection%3Dcatalog_metadata%26language%3Den%26queryText%3D%2528digital%253C%2523and%253Etypography%2529%26resultTemplate%3Dcatalog.result.hts%26sourceQueryText%3D&lastSearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.de%2Fsearch97cgi%2Fs97_cgi%3Faction%3Dformgen%26template%3Dcatalog.search.hts%26fulltextQuery%3Ddigital%2Btypography%26fulltextOperator%3D%253C%2523AND%253E%26umlaute%3Don%26waehrung%3DEuro%26sortspec%3DErscheinungsjahr%2Bdesc&newSearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.de%2Fsearch97cgi%2Fs97_cgi%3Faction%3Dformgen%26template%3Dcatalog.search.hts%26language%3Den&verity=true&cookie=done

But we also need some kind of action to be taken in regard to the
physical books, as I suggested before.  Otherwise, anyone who buys it
will, at first glance, believe TL is proprietary software.

I find it easy to believe that it was a "standard" imposed by Springer
production out of ignorance, and not out of malice.  However, that does
not relieve them (and you, as the principal author) from having to make
some remedy.  I know this is a huge hassle, but is that not reasonable?

Do we already have gs8, gv, gsview and xpdf on the dvd? If we
can't distribute AR, we should at least include the free
alternatives.

Martin,

We have all of them (gs8, gv, gsview and xpdf) on CTAN and I planned to have 
all of them on our DVD.

I had a look at http://www.artifex.com/licensing/index.htm and I have to admit 
I'm not quite sure what to make out of it.

I have written to the Springer editor about Apostolos' book, let's see
what they say.

If I keep my brain clean, I should remember to scan the CD cover
tomorrow and make it available. The CD itself does say straightforwardly
"(c) 2003 Springer-Verlag".

let's be clear that Springer were/are under no obligation to acknowledge
or advertise the TeX user groups in their book. Taking the TeX Live CD,
adding some more files, and putting it out with their own label etc is
all perfectly OK. But they must not claim copyright, or attempt to
inhibit other's licenses, as they have done.

I'd be extremely surprised if Springer do anything except say "whoops
very sorry won't happen again"; and equally surprised if any of us
take it further.

I'd have extreme difficulty getting my institution to foot my legal
bill, since they have not agreed to open source my work :-} (luckily I
have not claimed copyright on anything on TL in the last few years)

Whether it can be used in the main TeX Live and whether it can be
included in the ctan/ subdir are two different things, since the ctan/
subdir is a "mere aggregation" of unrelated software.  It certainly
can't be used in TL proper, because of its many restrictions; that's all
I was saying before.

So, let's examine the license in light of including it in ctan/.

http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/cvs/Public.htm says, in 2a:

    Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a
    commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment
    is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly ...
    or indirectly  ...

Lehmann's (just for example) is a commercial organization.  Payment is
being made.  Therefore, AFPL Ghostscript cannot be included in any form,
even in the ctan/ directory.

A little bit later, distributing it on a cd with a book is also
explicitly disallowed, so including AFPL GS would cause trouble in that
regard as well.

    gs8, gv, gsview and xpdf

Gsview is also distributed under the AFPL now, at least the current
versions.  (I seem to recall Fabrice mentioning that Russell changed the
licensing terms fairly recently.)  So no gsview either.

gv and xpdf are ok, as far as I know.

I remember a discussion on Monday evening where someone reported
that LPD had been asked for a clarification and o.k.ed it. 

Seems like someone has to ask Artifex. Shall I?

Manfred and me are just starting to talk about whether being able
(or wanting) to include the AFPL things, so we are open to opinions.
In past, it was included in CTAN snapshots, as my interpretation of
AFPL point 2(a)(ii) is that it is ok, to put it on a CD that is sold alone
(the Lehmanns case) or it must not be sold as part of a journal
or book (what was the case with the users groups that send it out
with their jounals -- I asked Peter Deutsch if the membership fees
would be regarded as payment, but he said he wouldn't).
But as far as I see it was never intended to include 3 or 4 CTAN
CDs into a book or journal.

Definitely.

GSView would be the only thing I would be really sorry about to throw
away. We should find out wether there is a distributable version.
Regarding letting out AFPL GS I don't see a problem, as GNU GS does
everything I need. When I did the first snapshots, there was still
a difference in quality (like AFPL GS being able to embed Type1
fonts into pdf and GNU GS not).

publishers have (and are in many cases) lawyers and know pretty well what 
they are doing, so i don't believe in ignoreance (nor malice); it's the way 
they act esp when there is not that close a relationship with the authors 
(i think that educational publishers are far more careful since they have a 
more close relationship with authors i.e. groups of authors); to some 
extent, it's the author's responsibility as well to keep an eye on it; 
maybe there should be some 'instruction for authors of tex books' on the 
tug/lugs home pages; i would not be surprised if the publishers answer 
would be: 'we asked the author and he/she said that it was okay'

The simplest way would be to write them a letter along the lines:

"We've noticed that in ... you claim copyrights for ... as well as you 
forbid your buyers to make copies of it ... . Since we consider this 
unacceptable, before seeking legal counsel, we would like to hear your 
opinion on this as well as a to receive a proposal on how to correct this 
in current publications and prevent similar things in future publications."

so, let's see how willing they are to compensate

Hans

i'm not going to explain that to authors -) when they (someplace) in their 
document define their input encoding, it should be enough for them to work 
according to that;

actually, the whole tcx thing can be pretty unportable: when i implemented 
support for some languages, and ended up in constant misundertandings about 
what code to attach to what character it proved to be that those that i 
communicated with were using --translate things (so, not in the doc, but at 
the command line) without even knowing what it did and so without telling 
me about it; even when i asked if some translation took place (which was 
what i suspected) they didn't tell/notice, so for me the main thing is 
"let's make live comfortable for users" (how many users know about 
locales's? esp now that linux is going gui in quite fuzzy ways);

(either we aim at programmers and low level code hackers, or we aim at 
users, and it's my impression that tex live aims at users)

hm, this would be ok if tex has a flexible mechanism for changing the 
mappings on the fly (i've played with these things a lot so ...) and 
whenever discussions about such mechanisms / extensions pop up, they slowly 
fade aways due to all kind of objections; so, i wanna stick to 8-in 8-out -)

sure, but it happens that there is no way to feed back the --translate into 
the mp subsystem, so one depends on 8 bit plus macro based input encoding 
directives; also, the --translate does not work well for documents with 
mixed encodings (think of a german - french - chinese document where the 8 
bit char may depends on the language as well, i would not like to see utf 
codes to be translated into ^^'s)

hm, i probably had that kind of support (and beyond) in context before 
hyperref did -)

it crossed my mind after sending the mail, but then we at least should add 
a good documentation part to the file (and clear names of tcx files);

also, i wonder if it's possible to chain tcx files, say, one main one and 
an extra one, which can overload entries in the main one ( i dunno if a tcx 
can contain gaps)

We can specify a default tcx file with --default-translate-file which
is used if no -translate-file option is given.

True.  So as long as no AFPL stuff ends up on the inst or demo cd's,

I think it makes a difference: If the image was made by you,
there is no way they can claim any copyright. If they did at
least something, they have some copyright. But we are splitting
hairs...

i'm not that sure if we can expect users to do that out of the blue (i.e. 
add command line args); i could add it to texexec, but that would not help 
non context users; so handling it via texmf.cnf is a better approach

btw, how sensitive are old binaries for --whatever=something switches that 
are not yet supported in that binary, i.e. do they abort? or what happens 
if no cp8bit is present

(somehow i got the feeling that things become quite messy that way; tex is 
already hard to explain)

I was not talking about how we can make things better than they are at
the moment. With "We can ..." I was describing the current situation.
That --default-translate-file already exists (even though --help does
not list it).

In fact, I have no idea how this issue should be adressed correctly.

Yes, an unknown option causes an immediate abort.

Nothing, I guess. But, I am not sure.

let we have the text:

^ ^ef

Vladimir suggests to convert it to:

\textasciicircum  \textasciicircum ef

(note two spaces after first \textasciicircum).
There is no way to typeset this text correctly with
the default \catcode of the space.

It seems as unreal example. The more realistic example is:

,,quoted text`` next text.  (the ,, and `` note single chars in this example)

can be converted to:

\leftczechqq quoted text\rightczechqq  next text.

and the space is lost during the .toc reading because the
\catcode of space has the value 10 in this situation.

Please, stop saying about LICR. IMHO, this is bad idea.

If I am working with 8-bit, I need to save in 8-bit in \write files.
If I am working with UTF-8, I need to save in UTF-8 in \write files.
If I am designing my own verbatim macro which reads back the \write
files, I need the simplicity.

The simplicity is very important argument.

Does anybody know why the encTeX is not included in TL8?

yes, it would be more general, but we should not allow TeX to use
non-1-to-1 mappings by default (without explicit specification of TCX
file), as it would be weird.

TCX has two effects:

1) it allows to map input characters to characters with the same or
   other codes (re-encoding of the input stream)

2) for all remapped characters, it changes the ^^-notation to the
   8-bit notation.

what we want to use (what is acceptable in the default TeX behavior,
as described in the TeXbook and in tex.web) is only the 2nd feature
(make certain chars outside of the 32-126 range printable too), and we
shall not allow any non-1-to-1 mapping for a single char.

therefore, i think that it might be better to avoid using TCX by
default (when no --translate-file is given), as it allows mappings
and we do not want to rely on TCX to not contain non-trivial maps.

so what Hans suggested looks better to me, except we shall perhaps
remove the write_mode=3 which may make the documents non-portable.

The most simple solution up to now is to add 2 lines in texmfmp.c to say
that if no .tcx file has been specified, then we use cp8bit.tcx
(possibly renamed to default.tcx). And yes, we need to recompile
everything in texk/web2c/.

This is the nice example of user confusion if TeX stay dependent on
system settings (locales). The change from TeX dependency of locales to
its independency (from TL7 to TL8) was debated in tex-implementors@ams.org
in January 2003 in the thread:

TeX and the UNIX locale

The result of this (big) discussion was to make TeX independent on
locales. The change was done in web2c TeX sources. The result of this
change is the Fabrice's problem.

Sorry, my notice is only "historical" notice, not the constructive
soulution.

no - it was only a simplified example. if you had looked at how LaTeX

i don't know why we need encTeX when we have omega which is much more
powerful in handling UTF-8.

what we were talking about is EXPLICITLY the question whether to
output some characters in 8-bit form instead of ^^-notation. we were
NOT talking about any re-encoding like encTeX or TCX does.

that's not a question to me...

however, there are no problems... see how LaTeX works and solves all
this at the MACRO level without any non-standard hacks like
encTeX. 8-bit texts which are written to files (e.g. AUX) are saved in
portable and robust LICR notation which is independent on any font and
input and font encodings.

to me it looks like this is not a showstopper as the behavior which
was present in TL7 can be achieved by specifying the --translate-file
option if needed. the change in the behavior will hardly be noticed by
anyone...

Hi. I will take a look at this. One question: Since I have put elambda
into TeXlive depot and caring a bit for this kind of stuff. Would it be
possible/useful to put these files into TeXlive too?

I would suggest the directories:
	eomega/
		lambda
		otp
		ocp
as where to put it. That would allow lambda (normal) to use its files
and eomega/lambda these files. Currently the search pathes for
omega/lambda are
	.../{omega,tex}/...
and eomega/elambda are
	.../{eomega,omega,tex}/...
(cum grano salis)

What do you think about this?

I am very sorry that my email is now not concerned to the primary subject
of this thread. But I can't leave the sentence: "encTeX is non-standard
hack" without my answer because there is a danger that many tex-live@
readers can reject the encTeX without getting more information about it.

IMHO, encTeX is the natural extension of TeX. I mean that if Knuth were
managed and developed his TeX more long time then he would be adopted the
similar extension as encTeX into his program.

On the opposite hand: the LaTeX is good example of the hack because many
things are solved on the boundary of the possibility and unpossibility.
There exists LaTeX developer(s), who agrees that LaTeX is a hack. The
simplicity is lost: this is very big problem of this macro package.

No. As long as someone will try to recompile some document like the one
Daniel has posted, he will notice the difference.

If you deliver the programs this way, you are bound to have to answer
hundreds or thousands of times to the same question (ie: state that
using the tcx file will help).

My opinion is that you mix up the whole thing. If you look at the
_Pascal source code_, it is only a matter of knowing if you decide to
write a byte as-is (which I advocate) or using some silly ^^ notation.
There is no encoding problem neither locale problem in this.

If you want to do some translation before writing or after reading, this
is your problem, but the process shouldn't be made more messy than
needed.

It will be incompatible insofar as the change is concerned.  Which is to
say, if the binaries are not recompiled, they will \write ^^ into output
files for 8-bit characters (by default).  Enough documents depend on
this that it will be noticed.

    Anyway. I can rebuild alpha-linux and i386-linux up to 25. Speptember,
    after this I am gone.

I hope that we will make the change in the source (whatever it turns out
to be) today or tomorrow at the latest, so we are still ready with the
image on 9/22 for production.

yes, it is a non-standard hack. non-standard is because it's an
incompatible extension to TeX, and hack because it's of very limited
usage; something which is not necessary.

what makes you believe in this? :-)

with encTeX, you put the input encoding into the format file. so the
TeX engine is only able to process documents in ONE FIXED INPUT
ENCODING without regeneration of the format file. do you find it
elegant and useful? i don't. in my opinion, encTeX is totally useless,
and moreover a harmful extension which only complicates matters but
not simplifies them...

LaTeX may be a hack is some sense because of limitations of the TeX
engine (which it may overcome by using eTeX). But encTeX is not going
to simplify anything for LaTeX - eTeX and Omega do.

    I am not getting a feeling of consensus on this issue. If Vladimir, Petr
    and Fabrice cannot agree on a solution, what is to be done?

I had the impression there *was* consensus.
1) make tex \write 8-bit characters by default, in one way or another.
2) provide a way to get the 7-bit ^^ behavior.

If we don't do #1, as Fabrice and Hans (among others) have said, we will
be getting numerous complaints from users, whom we will have to explain
tcx files (ugh).

#2 is less important, but it seems important to me to provide a
relatively easy way to get the original ^^ behavior as described in the
TeXbook.  (The TeXbook/Knuth does not prohibit #1, however, as we've
discussed.)

Here is my new proposed change in texmfmp.c to accomplish this:

  if (!translate_filename)
    translate_filename = "cp8bit.tcx";
  read_char_translation_file ();

This way, users won't be tempted to change the "default" coding system
to a non-trivial mapping.  But users who must have the 7-bit behavior
can rename cp8bit.tcx.

When the tcx file does not exist, TeX just gives a warning.  It doesn't
abort.  (tex --translate-file=foobar story)

We do something cleaner next year.

Ok?  Can everyone agree on this?  I don't claim it is the cleanest or
most efficient, but it seems the simplest/least risk to me while still
getting the job done.

We should also fix the patgen-failing-to-close-files problem that Petr
mentioned.  It is also next-to-zero risk.

The question was also to the author, if it is ok for him. I usually ask
people before putting there stuff into TeXlive. 

Concerning tpm: After TL2003 we should start splitting
omega/lambda/eomega/elambda out. ATM it is all ONE package (omega.tpm).
I guess at least omega/lambda and eomega/elambda should be different
packages. But -- all after TL2003.

I would suggest loading default.tcx instead of cp8bit.tcx. This way
people can adapt permanently to their preferred way, without using cmd

    I would suggest loading default.tcx instead of cp8bit.tcx. 

That was my first suggestion.  But it has the disadvantage of implicitly
inviting users to change default.tcx to some other tcx file, which could
actually remap bytes from one value to another.  As Vladimir said, that
opens another whole can of worms.

Fabrice, can you make the changes in texmfmp.c and patgen.ch?
I would do it, but I am not set up to recompile, so couldn't test.

I will add an item to the change history in the doc shortly (and send

This is not true! Please, if you are argumenting against encTeX, do not
write nonsenses. Macro packages (like inputenc) can read the encoding and
is_printable setting everytime via encTeX primitives and they can set

encTeX solves the is_printable reading/setting too.
This was a reason, why I mentioned it in this thread.

On the other hand I know that there is no time to do a big changes in TeX
sources before TL8 release. I accept the Karl's suggestion about a little
change in texmfmp.c source only.

Not completely correct. I have put into TeXlive depot elambda which is
elambda.ini (in turn ATM a copy of lambda.ini) through eomega. So the
current texlive is prepared for the split. Also the search pathes are
already separated (all this will already be on TL 2003).

So we have elambda already in. And the search pathes allow that elambda
search FIRST through the eomega subtree and then through the omega
subtree. Therefore there should be no confusion.

OK, that was the reason I asked.

So do you think that you will change/extend etc these approach? I
suppose some high level approach for this is definitely needed for
elambda. On the contrary, for eomega this is not necessary. Those
working with eomega should be able to do everything by themselves ;-)

teTeX since version 2.0 (released early in Feb. 2003) has the changed
behaviour:

  \newwrite\x
  \immediate\openout\x = xfoo.out
  \immediate\write\x{hello????}
  \immediate\closeout\x
  \bye

This puts
  hello^^e4^^f6^^fc^^df
into xfoo.out, independent from the locale. Nobody has complained about
it so far...

Hi,

I've just started reading my mail (with a back log from nearly a week),
and thought you should know about an license example which seems to be ok 
(after some not so good ones :-).

MiKTeX also adopted using tcx files, so is compatible with web2c
in that matter.

And if somebody puts in the first line (or give it in the command line):
%& --translate-file=il1-t1

xfoo.out will have: hello????

I'm quite sure that we have consent that (at least) relying on
locale was bad idea.

Again, this is one of the best examples for using il1-t1.tcx
instead of inputenc hacks. Your test8bit.exa will contain
  L'?t? est fini.
and can be immadiatelly read.
Of course, you can use cp8bit.tcx and inputenc package, if you prefer, 
but what about your index files? Hope that they are also okay for
sorting.

I do not have time for writing more at the moment, just to recapitulate:
1. the problem of reencoding returns like boomerang every time just
   before the release of TL. Why not more early? :-(
2. tcx can work with any format (plain, context, texinfo, etc. for every
   engine), as well as with MetaFont and MetaPost
3. tcx doesn't break DEK's ideas found in The TeXBook
4. tcx idea *is* documented in the web2c manual (though not perfectly)
5. everybody knows that the main disadvantage of using tcx is that
   one cannot change input and/or font encoding in the same file,
   so only latex (and perhaps context ?) have some tricky support
   for that. For all programs we doesn't have yet better solution
   without changing TeX itself
6. Petr's enctex should be reconsidered carefully by more people;
   I strongly suggest doing that in more friendly manner, but not 
   at this hot moment, please!

I agree that including cp8bit.tcx by default is OK to make people 
more happy, provided that such change doesn't break 
possibility of using other files from the command line,
or (preferably) in the first line %& construct.

All the best,

right, and -as maintainer of a quite big macro package and supporter of a

(i rally wonder why tex cannot be 8-bit like all those other byte based 
programs; the problem is in operating systems doing locale things with file

it was in some beta (windows) some time ago; since it is disabled by

not all verbatim tex is coded in backslashed (macrobased) tex, at least not 
on my machine; also, when processing xml (utf-8) (which is not that 
uncommon nowadays) i really want the eight bitter in the toc file -)

hm, i see nothing wrong in enctex (would even like to see it have more 
mapping features, since in combined tex/ps/js/pdf/whatever docs quite some 
mapping has to be done which is not always trivial to do with macros)

(btw, omega is curently no solution: no pdf backend, not stable, too slow, 
etc; also, nobody forces you to use the enctex extensions)

sorry, i got this impression after reading your manual (enctex-e.pdf):

from reading that, i've got the impression that all reencoding is
stored in the format file and cannot be changed. so, all enctex's
primitives work in normal (non-ini) run too, and it's possible to
redefine all mappings on the fly?

TCX solves it too, and is already in the web2c/tex live. so why do we
need enctex for that?

being able to write 8-bit chars into files and being dependent on
locale in that are different things. if TeX's behavior will depend on
locale (which may be different even on the same machine), then it will
not be portable: the data written to files will be different
(depending on locale, it may end up either as 8-bit char or as ^^),
and it is very possible that this may lead to different typesetting
results.

as we've read from the TeXbook, it is acceptable to be able to
influence on printability of characters; by setting that dependable on
locale may make it quite "unpredictable" (i.e. TeX's behavior will be
different without changing TeX-specific configuration files or command
line options).

also, making printability dependent on locale is WRONG because it
assumes that you process documents in the input encoding which is the
same as your UNIX console encoding. such assumptions are very untrue
if you process a greek document in french locale or similar things.
The encoding of the TeX document should be specified in the document
itself (like in XML) - e.g. as an option to the inputenc package.

well, what i was saying that it IS possible to implement verbatim
typesetting (via temporary files) using only MACROS, and with 7-bit
portable temporary output files, answering to your argument:

sure - if it's XML file, it should be possible to write 8-bit chars to
it (but if this toc file is for TeX-only reading, then it's OK to have
it in LICR-type encoding).

the reason i'm against enctex is that i don't see anything useful in

another non-standard extension to TeX.

Thanks, Olaf.

I don't know how far system rebuilds have proceeded.  We (i.e., you :)

as far as i understood, enctex can do one to many mappings, which means 
that in principle one can map ( onto \( which is needed in ps/pdf/js code 
(unfortunately there is no mechanism for multiple mapping vectors)

THROCKING (participial vb.)
The action of continually pushing down the lever on a pop-up toaster
in the hope that you will thereby get it to understand that you want
it to toast something. Also: a style of drum-playing favoured by Nigel
Olsson of the Elton John Band, reminiscent of the sound of someone
slapping a frankfurter against a bucket. An excellent example of this
is to be heard on 'Someone Save My Life Tonight' from the album
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.

Ok, got it. Anyway, according to what you wrote me I think it is not a
good idea to put the package into wide use ATM. Maybe we can -- within
the course of eomega/elambda development -- come up with something
better, which I can then include.

Hi,

with a lot of support from Karl to get the English texts right,
I made a pre-final version of the cover and labels.
I hope that I will just have to add the French and Polish questions
and answers where the German and English Q&As now appear twice, when
Daniel and Staszek are ready with the translations, and to correct
the typos you might find.

You can see them at http://lbdb01.gsi.de/cover/
(prefer to click on the pdfs, they are smaller, but better)

Regards,
  Klaus

Looks great!

Minor quibble: You list "Solaris 2.9" for i386 and 
"Sun Solaris 2.7" on Sparc. So the Solaris 2.9 is not from Sun? :-)
Scrap the Sun from "Sun Solaris 2.7".

Also: 9/2003? Wouldn't 10/2003 be safer?

After looking again it seems that adding Sun to "Solaris 2.9"
would be more consistent. And "MacOS X" should then be 
"Apple Mac OS X" (yes, Apple has two spaces in "Mac OS X").

Mac OS X is the name of the OS (including the gui, etc.), Darwin is the 
name of the core foundation

  ??Beneath the appealing, easy-to-use interface of Mac OS X is a 
rock-solid foundation that is engineered for stability, reliability, 
and performance. This foundation is a core operating system commonly 
known as Darwin. Darwin integrates a number of technologies, most 
importantly Mach 3.0, operating-system services based on 4.4BSD 
(Berkeley Software Distribution), high-performance networking 
facilities, and support for multiple integrated file systems. ?

That's the way it is also typeset on the cover, I think it looks
better than a full space in between.

The Sun is added for the i386-Solaris.

Regarding the date I used to be conservative and took the date when
the snapshot was made or the timestamp of TL image on TUG server,
not the date the production was completed. So I think 09/2003 is
OK.

Regards
Klaus

PS: Karl and me were wondering wether the CDs should be labeled TL
instead of TC, as there is only TL on them, no CTAN, or that would
confuse people.
Volker said, it would be confusing, if they were labeled different
from the title on the cover, so I used TC.

in the DVD distribution only (starting with tonight's build, if all goes
well).

2) I've greatly expanded the text in LICENSE.TL to mention the items

They're checked in to the depot, and I'll include them below FYI.

Any comments or suggestions welcome.

$Id: //depot/Master/LICENSE.CTAN#1 $  $Date: 2003/09/17 $  $Author: karl $

COPYING CONDITIONS FOR CTAN SNAPSHOT:

A snapshot of the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) holdings is
taken from time to time and distributed on physical media.  It may be
bundled with the TeX Live system, or distributed separately.

In any case, the licensing conditions of the packages in the CTAN
snapshot vary widely.  In particular (and in contrast to TeX Live), not
all the software meets free software/open source criteria: some are
available only as binaries, others have restrictions on commercial
resale, and so on.

Furthermore, the creators of the CTAN snapshot have explicitly received
permission from some authors of software in the nonfree/ area of CTAN to
include their material in our distribution.  This permission does not
extend to any redistributors; you yourself must also contact the authors
with regards to your own distribution, or refrain from including such
software.

Thus, when redistributing the CTAN snapshot, you must be very careful
that you are not violating any license conditions.  Since each situation
is different, we cannot offer any general advice.

To learn redistribution requirements, we suggest checking the TeX
Catalogue: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(or any CTAN mirror).  The Catalogue is also included in the CTAN
snapshot in help/Catalogue, but the online version will have updates.
Of course the licensing files within the packages themselves are the
final authority.

If you believe any files have been included erroneously, please contact
us (references are given below).

If you have any questions or comments, please contact us.  
Thanks for your interest in TeX.

$Id: //depot/Master/LICENSE.TL#5 $  $Date: 2003/09/17 $  $Author: karl $

COPYING CONDITIONS FOR TeX Live:

To the best of our knowledge, all software in this distribution is
freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis), within
the Free Software Foundation's definition and Debian Free Software
Guidelines.  If you find any non-free files included, please contact us
(references given below).

That said, TeX Live has neither a single copyright holder nor a single
license covering its entire contents, since it is a collection of many
disparate packages.  Therefore, you may copy, modify, and/or
redistribute software from TeX Live only if you comply with the
requirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective packages.

To most easily learn these requirements, we suggest checking the TeX
Catalogue at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/catalogue.html
(or any CTAN mirror).  The Catalogue is also included in TeX Live at
./texmf/doc/html/catalogue/catalogue.html, but the online version will
have updates.  Of course the licensing files within the packages
themselves are the final authority.

In some cases, TeX Live is distributed with a snapshot of the CTAN
archive, which is entirely independent of and separable from TeX Live
itself.  (The "live" DVD in the TeX Collection is one example of this.)
Please be aware that the CTAN snapshot contains many files which are
*not* freely redistributable; see LICENSE.CTAN for more information.


GUIDELINES FOR REDISTRIBUTION:

In general, you may redistribute TeX Live, with or without modification,
for profit or not, according to the usual free software tenets.  Here
are some general guidelines for doing this:

- If you make any changes to the TeX Live distribution or any
package it contains, besides complying with any licensing requirements,
you must prominently mention such changes in your modified distribution
so that users do not take your work for ours, and know to contact you,
not us, in case of questions or problems.  A new top-level
README.<yourwork> file is a good place to describe the general situation.

- Especially (but not necessarily) if changes or additions are made, we
recommend a title such as "TeX Live YYYY, for <your work>", where YYYY
is the year of TeX Live you are publishing.  This credits both our work
and yours.

- You absolutely may *not* place your own copyright on the entire
distribution, since it is not your work (as stated above, TeX Live is
not created by any single person or entity).  Statements such as "all
rights reserved" and "may not be reproduced" are especially
reprehensible, since they are anthithetical to the free software
principles under which TeX Live is produced.

- You may use any cover or media label designs that you wish.  Such
packaging and marketing details are not covered by any TeX Live license.

- Finally, we make the following requests (not legal requirements):
a) Acknowledging that TeX Live is developed as a joint effort by all TeX
   user groups, and encouraging the user/reader joining any user group
   of choice.
   
   The web page http://www.tug.org/usergroups.html may be referenced as
   a list of TeX user groups.  We also appreciate your explicitly
   listing all the user groups given on that page, space permitting.

b) Referencing the TeX Live home page: http://www.tug.org/tex-live/.

c) Crediting the editor of TeX Live: Sebastian Rahtz.

Such credits may be placed on the label of your media, your cover,
and/or in accompanying text (for instance, in the acknowledgements
section of a book).

If you have any questions or comments, *please* contact us.  In general,
we appreciate being given the chance to review any TeX Live-related
material in advance of publication, simply to avoid mistakes.  It is
much easier to correct text on a CD label or in a book before thousands
of copies are made!

We are also happy to keep anyone planning a publication informed as to
our deadlines and progress.  Just let us know.  However, you should be
be aware that TeX Live is produced entirely by volunteers, and no dates
can be guaranteed.


LICENSING FOR NEW PACKAGES:

Finally, we are often asked what license to use for new work.  To be
considered for inclusion on TeX Live, a package must use a free software
license, such as the LaTeX Project Public License, the GNU Public
License, the X Window System license, the modified BSD license, etc., or
be put into the public domain.  Please see the url's below for more
discussion.

Thanks for your interest in TeX.

Message-ID: <200309162229.h8GMTLY00650@f7.net>

Dear system rebuilders,

Forgive me, but I just feel the obsessive need to check which rebuilds
will be possible in the next couple of days?  (For information more than
anything else.)

Here's what I gleaned about who rebuilds what from the archives, please
let me know if incorrect ...

(done) alpha-linux - norbert
       i386-freebsd - sebastian
(done) i386-linux - staszek
       i386-openbsd - ?
       i386-solaris - martin
(done) mips-irix - kaja
       powerpc-aix - vladimir
       powerpc-darwin - gerben
       sparc-linux - staszek
(done) sparc-solaris - kaja
(in process) win32 - fabrice


The bottom line, if you didn't plow through every single message :), is
that it's not a disaster if a system is not rebuilt; pool files didn't
change, so the present binaries will still function.  But there will be
an incompatibility in 8-bit character handling, so the more we can do,
the better.  (I'll be adding a paragraph about this to the
documentation.)

(There was also a bugfix to patgen, but that's not critical.)


Thanks,
karl

... definitely, it is us, but that was precisely the reason why:
- the banner advertises the engine is _TeXk_
- 'source specials enabled' message is output

I guess there is no simple way to workaround this. Source specials are
only a convenience for people doing 'regular' latex.

I'm so sorry, but the last ad hoc changes to tex and co cannot work

(perhaps because of that faulty playing with locales still left?)

The typeset output is OK.

2. the above with --translate-file given _only_ on the command line
gives the same result. 

For current Windows binaries (from Sep 06, before not yet included
default cp8bit), the result is different: only Aogonek is represented
as ^^81 in the message and log file, other characters are well;
the typeset output is also OK.

3. now, as the world is latex oriented, and you can feel bored
by such exotic examples as above, please try the attached

Then remove the first line and unpercent

so the default cp8bit.tcx could now work and you can see what was written
to \jobname.ttc.

Please try also removing texmf/web2c/cp8bit.tcx for both latex tests.

What strange results ? The chars output to terminal are printed
according to your current locale. If I do a "chcp 1252" under Windows,
the result is ok for me. I can see in both the terminal and the ttc file
the same list of chars.

this still permits publishers to make a verbatim copy, make their own 
cover, publish it and not mention tex live at all;

(1) Is tex live as a bundle copyrighted? (with all freedoms of using / 
copying / adapting you mention), if so, you may request that it's mentioned 
visible
(2) In order to be able to help users, if the image is used, a cd cover 
should mention (1) the name tex live, (2) the version number, (3) the 
editor, (4) url OR on te covert point to a readme where the user can find 
this info (he/she should be aware of it) OR have a proper pop up mentioning 
it.

even if we cannot demand it, i would make the suggestion much more stronger 
(keep the 'requests', omit the 'not legal req.'); if some publisher has 
doubts, he will definitely contact the team -)

So, get me right, I have no problems with copies of tex live in a book, but 
it should be recognized as such (just as a linux cdrom mentions that it is 
some brand of linux and runs on some kind of platform, what kernel is 
used); same for tex live. Actually, one may wonder when one may use the 
name TeX Live, i.e. after what changed / additions the name is no longer 
valid

Maybe TeX Live should be a trademark.

Well, I received your mail in different encodings, so I could only save
parts and then include the above using linux pine ;-) 

1. all tests was done using iso8859-2 (don't know what is cp 1252? we use
here cp1250 on win; but I'm using exactly what I want in dos/cmd window,
not relaying on emacs or other programs which can change what I'm really
viewieng behind the scene). So I can test and see the terminal messages on
both machines running Win and Linux staing in the _same_ I/O encoding.

2. I hope that the latex example attached to my mail (in latin1 cp8859-1)
will explain more. Please just run latex on it and play as I suggested.

OK, attached 4 files from linux:
1) iso1-t1.lo1 and iso1-t1.tt1
   from the latex run when
     %& --translate-file=il1-t1
     ...
     %\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

2) iso1-t1.lo2 and iso1-t1.tt2
     the first line was removed and
     \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
   is used 

as you can see in the log files, 2) reads cp8bit (by default), but
only run 1) seems to be OK.

No. Both are OK and it is expected that \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
converts all accented chars into LaTeX internal encoding, which does not
use any 8-bit chars afterwards.

I know it's non-trivial. The latest MiKTeX has the exact same problem, but 
unlike web2c it doesn't say anything about being another TeX:

This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (MiKTeX 2.3) (preloaded format=latex 
2000.11.28)  17 SEP 2003 13:50

The problem has been re-reported to the maintainer of MiKTeX as well. But 
as you say this is not a crucial bug as source specials aren't needed for 
the final version of a document.

To give some more details:
With the demo CD (AFAIK yesterday downloaded) I wasn't able to compile
any LaTeX file as it failed to create the latex.efmt.
After running fmtutil manually I found out it failed since it
wanted to include Mongolian hyphenation patterns (mnhyph) that
aren't there, and after making a copy of language.dat to HD, and
removing the line with mnhyph, I could create the formats and
run LaTeX, but that's not ready-to-run demo ;-)
(of course it wasn't the only format that failed, but all that
rely on language.dat)

  Klaus

hmm. I removed the Mongolian stuff some time ago
from demo, I am surprised this didnt come up before. 
the Mongolian *should* have been removed during build of the demo
setup.

Pardon, but I'm still messed. For what reason reading cp8bit by default
was included? Only for messages and log? For \write it doesn't work
for most latex users.
So to conclude:

It is not true when using inputenc.

2. Daniel Flipo reported the problem with french lshort, but it is still

It is true : \TeX{} by itself does output 8-bit chars. The problem you
see when using inputenc is that you don't have any 8-bit chars to output
anymore, they have been converted to sequences.

It definitely solves Daniel problem, and also solves the problem for
ConTeXt users.

for non-LaTeX users ;-)
in LaTeX, there is NO problem with 8-bit chars, as it does it properly
and in a portable way.

in LaTeX, one doesn't need TCX nor enctex nor even 8-bit output to
files. other macro packages are not as advanced as latex and use
non-portable solutions (which are not really multilingual, BTW).

the problem with lshort (actually, fancyvrb) can be solved purely in
macro level, as i did to help compile the russian translation some
time ago.

LaTeX users does not need to read the overfull \hbox messages (in log and
in terminal) in his own language? Texts in these messages are not
readable if ^^af sequences are used here.

If terminal is able to show 8-bit letters in choosen language then it is
more usable to configure TeX with 8-bit output.

i'm not against allowing 8-bit output to terminal, log and files,
because it is not contradicting the TeX specification by Knuth.

however, one should understand that such 8-bit text is not always
useful, because of the difference in input encoding of the document
and font encoding used (which is what the overfull \hbox messages
appear in). in many cases this 8-bit text will look like unreadable
8-bit garbage, no more better than ^^af sequences.

i suppose that you're joking -)

it has to with decisions on how/what to expand when writing to files; in 
context this is under user control; sometimes you want to expand, sometimes 
you definitely don't; i'm not that sure if other macropackages give you 
that much control, anyhow, it's off topic

Sorry, Staszek, inputenc is the *standard* latex way of inputing
8-bit chars (documented in every book about LaTeX!), using il1-t1.tcx
is NOT documented! 
Will *you* explain every LaTeX user he/she has to change this?

*I* know how to compile lshort with the result I want, I just
report that the way has changed from TL7, and that we should be ready

 HH> i suppose that you're joking -)

it was not a pure joke :) several times i looked at context, i was
founding that it was not possible to process even cyrillic file
flawlessly.

i just tested with context included into current TeX Live depot, and
tried to process the file samle.tex which was included into teTeX2.0
(but is absent in current TeX Live), and it produced an error about
undefined control sequence \cyrillicK (i've attached that file).

will context work right if the document will consist of parts written
in different 8-bit encodings (when there will be auxiliary files
written too)?

Best,
v.

hm, will look into it (or actually, i depend on russian context users for 
that since they defined the lists); thanks for noticing

depends if you set expansion on, since internally named glyphs are used; 
(on my agenda is an additional system which keeps track of more info in 
auxiliary files, since encoding is just one issue; language and other 
attributes are another one and this is quite associated to structure. 
(implementing chinese and alike is much more complicated)

with regards to cyrillic, i cannot test that myself (cannot see if things 
come out right) but there are russian users out there so it must be 
possible -) one problem i found out is that it's quite hard to communicate 
with users when each of them uses a different encoding and when tcx 
translations and other input translations take place; in many cases users 
who come from latex or other systems are not aware of such mechanisms. 
Anyhow, not a topic for the tex live list.

you forgot to load support for the cyrillic encoding vectors as well as to 
select a fotn that supports cyrillic; once i feel confident that cyr is 
implemented ok, i'll add the regime and encoding by default (as with 
others); users can of course preload them in their local initialization file.

\useregime[cyr]        % load input regime vectors
\useencoding[cyr]      % load encoding vectors

\enableregime[cp1251]  % enables input regime
\setupbodyfont[cyr]    % selects font that has proper characters

this produces something on my machine that looks cyrillic

The texmf.cnf created by make install holds no clues wrt what to 
change. A while back also pdftex changed wrt search directories if I 
recall correctly. Can someone summarize the changes for me?

Thank you. A remark: 'make install' in TL's Build tree also installs a 
texmf.cnf file in .../texmf/web2c. This one differs strongly from what 
is in Master. Given that I use the programs from TL with a foundation 
that is small enough to be downloadable (99% based on Thomas' teTeX 
texmf tree) I run into this. Shouldn't the texmf.cnf that is installed 
by 'make install' not also be updated?

please do.  Building for Solaris 8 is better than Solaris 9 anyway, as
more people will be able to use it.  (Assuming upward compatibility.)

We can't explain the ins and outs of every situation in the release
history.  It should be explained in the real documentation (which isn't
going to happen).

How about if we add the phrase "by default", something like:

  \item \TeX{}, \MF{}, and \MP{} now, by default, output 8-bit input
  characters as themselves in output (e.g., \verb|\write|) files,

Is that any better?

In any case, we can say whatever we can think of in the manual to
explain the situation; I'm not wedded to my text, in fact I was asking
for comments on it.  The important thing is that the behavior of the new
binaries isn't "surprising".  That's exactly what we were trying to fix.

This is not exactly true. The overfull messages (and all others messages)
are converted by xchr vector (this vector can be set by TCX or enctex).
It means: dvi encoding can be different from terminal font encoding.
If the xord/xchr is set properly, you can read overfull messages without
problems.

Because xord vector has to be set as inversion of xchr, you can see
that the reencoding only by inputenc at expand processor level need
not be the best choice.

No many cases, only rare cases... This problem can be occur in 7bit TeX
as well: \hbox to 0pt{text $\varrho$ text} prints the percent character in
overfull message. Important: this problem does not interfere with
legibility of the normal (non math) text.

I'm not an shell expert either. However, could it be that variable expansion 
is shut off by using single quotes. e.g.:

TARPROG=tar
echo  "$TARPROG"
echo '$TARPROG'

shows it.

Please apologize if my comment reveals that I hadn't understood anything.

TCX is global for processing of TeX document, but the document may

but it's still better than changing xord/xchr since it relies only on
standard TeX features (thus is portable), and allows processing of
multilingual documents which is impossible with TCX. (also, TCX is
limited in that it only allows char to char translation, but sometimes
a character shall be expanded to some token sequence, e.g. some accent
command plus base character).

here is a typical setup: i process LaTeX documents in koi8-r input
encoding, use the fonts in T2A font encoding, and have utf-8 terminal
encoding (i edit the documents in Emacs). it is impossible to make
the output to terminal readable in this case.

i even think that this is impossible with enctex :) because both input
and font encodings are single-byte encodings, and terminal encoding is
multibyte encoding.

The outer shell dous not expand $TARPROG, because of the single
quotes. The inner shell can not expand $TARPROG properly, because it
does not get the right value for it. Passing TARPROG via environment
is a solution. The same solution could be used to avoid breaking the
singlequotes for TEXDIR.

I suggest:
  (
    cd "$CDDIR"
    TARPROG=$TARPROG TEXDIR=$TEXDIR $XARGS \
      sh -c '$TARPROG cf - "$@" | (cd "$TEXDIR"; umask 0; $TARPROG xf -)' sh

I should have explicitly said: inst has always been around that size.
It includes everything (all Unix binaries, all packages).  It is small

As for demo, Seb dropped Mongolian and a few other uncommonly used font

i wonder, how? anyway, for TeX it is impossible to know the terminal
encoding to make this work; in some cases it is simply impossible to
do this: e.g. when terminal is cyrillic, and the document is french;
and the whole business of readable out of the box log files is not
that important to make changes to TeX engine...

    this still permits publishers to make a verbatim copy, make their own

I'll ask rms about where the limits lie, in his opinion.

    (1) Is tex live as a bundle copyrighted?

Not in my opinion, anyway.  The very concept of "compilation copyright"
seems legally (and ethically) doubtful to me.

    (2) In order to be able to help users, if the image is used, a cd
    cover should mention (1) the name tex live, (2) the version number,

You'll be happy to know that the editors of both the forthcoming books
have sent me text exactly like this.  They have no interest in somehow
making TL invisible.

No, the life is more complicated ;-) We have omega 1.23.2.3
so lambda still uses that engine. eomega is 1.15 so we also need
elambda as a link. It was discussed a week ago or so.

Ps. Thanks for rebuilding AIX binaries.

Thanks for noticing that. The production company will burn what we

I've added elambda link to aix to complete. Still don't know what to do
with alt*, as Vladimir already wrote. For darwin we have soft links to
altpdftex, for other U*x: 4 hard copies of altpdftex (somehow not
up-to-date). Gerben?

I've just tested installations on win and linux, and compilations of 
tldoc (things goes well for pdf and html). So I'm rather optimist
(thought something wrong crept into tex and co. concerning reencodings).
Anyway, for the final release, the most important is to have
.tpm and lists/ files in sync, and all the above pending translations.

Subject: [tex-live] locale dependent writing to log/terminal is *broken*
Message-ID: <20030920104241.GA4358@dbs.uni-hannover.de>

Hi,

as Staszek has pointed out several times, there is still a problem. All
writes to terminal and log are not done according to the is_printable
array (which is filled correctly when using tcx), but only according to
the locale dependend isprint() function.

This in itself was Olaf's intention, but the bug comes now. When using
non-trivial mappings with tcx files, isprint() is given the wrong
character to check.

For me, it is easier to read the output of web2c, which is:

  if ( ( ( selector <= 16 ) && ( ! isprintable [k ]) ) || ( ( selector > 16
  ) && ( ! isprint ( k ) ) ) )

That means, that if selector > 16 (output to terminal or log) then it
is checked if "k" is considered printable by the locale. Depending on
this check, either
  printvisiblechar ( s )
is called (then, we get the 8bit output that we want) or we'll see some
^^ representation. But, if we look what printvisiblechar, we see that
it does not print its argument directly, but first applies Xchr to it.

That means, that not the caracter to be printed is checked, but something
else. That's wrong and that explains Staszek's gerbage.

As an example, the Aogonek (0xa1) is printable in the polish locale
on Linux. It's tcx-translation (char 0x81) is not printable in that
locale. So, tex outputs ^^81 instead of the Aogonek to terminal and log.

For a test, just try

%& -translate-file=il2-pl.tcx
\foo ? %

    As an example, the Aogonek (0xa1) is printable in the polish locale
    on Linux. It's tcx-translation (char 0x81) is not printable in that
    locale. So, tex outputs ^^81 instead of the Aogonek to terminal and log.

I'm sorry, but I'm confused by your example.  If one uses a tcx file
that maps 0xa1 to 0x81, then why shouldn't TeX output ^^81?  Isn't that
exactly what it was told to do?

Or are you saying that 0x81 should be "printable"?  I don't see how the
printability of 0xa1 enters into it.

    > That means, that not the caracter to be printed is checked, but something

Was this bug in previous versions, or did we introduce it?

If it's in previous versions, I must say, I'm inclined just to let it
stand, annoying as that is.

Aside from Yet Another round of rebuilds (difficult to complete by 9/22,
I would hazard to guess), what worries me is that we will find some
other interaction with the TeX "printable" system and that we've made
things worse ...

If TeX would not consider all the locale stuff, it would finally call
putc (Xchr (c)).  Olaf's intention was to make this depend on the locale,
so that only those characters come to the terminal, that are printable.

Obviously, the character to check is Xchr (c) and not c itself. That's all that
I want to say. Simplifying the code, one could write the buggy stuff as

  if isprint(c)
    printf (Xchr (c))
  else
    "print c with ^^ notation"

> Or are you saying that 0x81 should be "printable"?  I don't see how the

No, I want to say that 0xa1 should be checked for printability, not
0x81. It does not make sense to check "code a" for printability when
the character to pass to putc is some other character.

> Was this bug in previous versions, or did we introduce it?

TeX Live 7 is ok. The bug was introduced after TL7, but not from the
recent change which just made cp8bit the default tcx file.

I think that this bug makes error messages for e.g. our polish friends
unusable. The code still depends on locales, but in a broken way. Fixing
this bug is the lest that we should do.

It is a matter of consistency. You should print what you test as
printable, else you are introduce problem. As Thomas says, it is much
easier to look at the Pascal/C code to understand what's happening
there: xchr[k] is printed, so xchr[k] should be tested for printability.

Patch submitted to perforce repository.

By the way, source.development holds the current version of encTeX, so
this patch does not apply there. (Let's see for TL2004 if encTeX solves
all those problems ;-) ).

We do have today and tomorrow, at least, for anyone who happens to be
working this weekend.  And if we slip one more day, it'd be worth it if
we could get more arches redone.  But this depends on the grace of the
system rebuilders, of course ...

BTW, Seb, freebsd is the only arch that didn't get recompiled yet with
the last change?

I sure hope it works out.

BTW, nowadays it's not uncommon to have utf-8 (multibyte) encoding on
the terminal. i wonder, if this per-byte printability checking is a
correct way to do. If not, maybe it's better to just output 8-bit
chars to terminal and log independently on locale?

Best,

I forgot to submit 2.15, sorry.

Furthermore, there is only one script, altpdftex, which changes 
behaviour depending on how it is called when it runs. So the rest are 
symbolic links in my setup.

The 'make install' does not do this in TL. Actually, probably the best 
should be if texlinks should make the links for altpdftex. But 
thatwould require for TL to really adopt altpdftex. Currently, 
altpdftex has a bit of a limbo status in TL (but it is used extensively 
on Mac OS X where the PDF output format is very important, also for 
older projects which need dvips and such)

I recompiled & submitted the binaries for irix6.5 and solaris2.7.

Compilation for solaris was done without mminstance (for which
the configure is broken); is that important wrt to the patch?
I don't have much time to investigate this...

Something seriously goes wrong here with the newly created programs  
(source Sep 20, 21:30). There is a problem with POOLSIZE in pdftex and  
pattern memory as well (note: nothing changed in my variables and  
texmf.cnf!) and suddenly fmtutil -all starts doing an endless loop of  
trying to create stuff in vain. This is because latex.eftm failed and  
when it tries to create jadetex it needs latex.efmt and it starts all  
over again ad infinitum.

Hm... Can you please retry to build just one format, e.g. latex and
set KPATHSEA_DEBUG=4 and see if some wrong texmf.cnf file is used?
Or is some essential file is not found?

E.g. trie_size should be 262000 in the first texmf.cnf file that sets it.

The texmf.cnf that is installed by 'make install' is severely limited 
it turns out.

The only variables for sizes it has are:

Apparently, this has changed recently. I know Sebastian was planning to 
update the texmf.cnf that was installed by make install, but this seems 
a downgrading more than an upgrading ;-)

I can work around this, but I think the texmf.cnf installed by 'make 
install' should have decent values (in fact, I think the one installed 
by 'make install' should be the only one.

Yes, Build/source/TeX/texk/kpathsea/texmf.in looks broken. The change
in question is #3959, I think. E.g. it removes
  trie_size = 262000
from that file (and it removes a lot more, too).

Perhaps not of much help, but...

- I pointed my tree to Master/bin/sparc-solaris
- removed everything in my Master/texmf-var
- run fmtutils --all   : it generated all formats (logs available)
- run pdftex on  \immediate\write16{hello} \end
  and encountered no problems

I guess that the difference is that Gerben uses "make install" into
the real texmf tree whereas most (all?) others just use the binaries
from "make install" and not the data files.

I (speaking with the teTeX maintainer hat) don't plan to add this support
to texlinks, but if someone else decides that TeX Live should have this
support in texlinks, he is welcome to adopt texlinks...

On the other hand, if the integration is done in a clean way so that
it does not mess up the code and texlinks still works if altpdftex does
not exist, I might add that change to teTeX...

Message-ID: <200309202359.h8KNxtM31837@tug.org>

I noticed there is a top-level README (leesmij) file for Dutch in TeX
Live, but it looks like few changes have been made since last year.

It's obviously not crucial, but if any Dutch speakers out there would
like to do a quick (very quick, i.e., by Monday) translation ...

I'll attach the current Dutch and English files.

Thanks,

Close. I use what make install produces next to other texmf trees 
(amongst others teTeX's texmf tree which is then in texmf.tetex). 
Besides, I think everybody will use some data files (like the .pool 
files which are closely related to the binaries after all).

The reason is that I need to be able to update binaries (and support 
for binaries) and foundation (texmf) separately.

Done, change #4014. The file that I checked in is in sync with the copy

Subject: [tex-live] TEXINPUTS, pdfTeX and texmf.cnf
Message-ID: <8E889D6A-EC6E-11D7-B19B-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

Recently, pdfTeX has started relying on TEXINPUTS to find pdftex.cfg. 
Given that pdfTeX not works unless pdftex.cfg is found, and given that 
the default TEXINPUTS is

TEXINPUTS =                     .;$TEXMF/tex/{generic,}//

it has become necessary to create a TEXINPUTS.pdffoo for every 
pdf-version of a format. Currently, for instance, there is no 
TEXINPUTS.pdfamstex in texmf.cnf. As a result, fmtutil --byfmt 
pdfamstex fails.

In other words, just adding a format to fmtutil.cnf is not enough 
anymore for pdftex (it is for tex), for pdftex-formats you also need to 
edit texmf.cnf and create a TEXINPUTS for that format.

Personally, I think this is not a good situation. There are two ways I 
can see a fix:

1. Change the catch-all TEXINPUTS into

TEXINPUTS =                     .;$TEXMF/{tex,pdftex}/{generic,}//

Given that for non-pdf formats like tex, latex, etc special TEXINPUTS 
versions exist in texmf.cnf and given that pdfTeX has become an equal 
citizen of sorts, that would be defendable I guess. From "not find 
pdftex.cfg unless there is a specific TEXINPUTS variable" for pdftex 
stuff we go to "search the pdftex hierarchy also unless expicitely 
turned off" for tex-based stuff

2. Restore the 'known' position for someting crucial as pdftex.cfg is. 
maybe even: put it in the web2c subdirectory together with stuff like 
texmf.cnf and friends.

I agree with Seb that we shouldn't make the change now.

I agree with Gerben that the change is desirable -- I'll put it on the
wishlist I'm keeping for next year.  Actually, I think suggestion #2,
changing pdftex to not use TEXINPUTS to find pdftex.cfg, makes even more
sense.

It has always used TEXINPUTS to find that files afaik. Recently, pdftex
started to read pdftex.cfg also when dumping formats.

I think that the real fix is to decouple pdftex.cfg from TEXINPUTS.
That file is not "tex syntax" and belongs to a pdftex specific
directory in the texmf tree. A new search path should be used for
this.

I think, for now, we should just add missing TEXINPUTS.progname instead
extending the default TEXINPUTS searchpath more. That would give the
wrong sign.

Who wants to edit texmf.in in source and texmf.cnf in Master? I don't
(will now go to bed).

Ok, so we (three) agree here.

I also agree not to use TEXINPUTS. I don't agree to move the file out of
texmf/pdftex. In my opinion, the solution is to use a new search path,
not to abuse yet another existing search path.

I dont think there is a missing one. Gerben gave the example of
"pdfamstex", but that's not in fmtutil.cnf either

I don't know about the rest, but elambda is the version build from
e-Omega with the lambda.ini, in fact elambda.ini. 
	elambda should be a link to eomega and it is NOT ATM installed
by make world in source. I asked for this some time ago (when I
installed the package) but nobody found time and I have no idea how to
change the Makefile.in currectly.

I know that Volker had it at least partly done some weeks ago, and I
sent him the latest files at his request a couple days ago.  But I don't

For that matter, I believe Volker also needs to put in the actual order

So I just copy altpdftex for other platforms and make links,
but only for: altpdfamstex, altpdfcontext, altpdfetex and altpdflatex
so they replace already existing files (to avoid a mess with tpm 
and lists/ OK?

The problem I would really want to have solved (and *not* wait another 
year for a problem that has caused and will probably cause me some 
support trouble) is that for TeX-based formats, an additional line in 
fmtutil.cnf is enough, but for pdfTeX-based one needs also to create 
another entry in texmf.cnf (for TEXINPUTS so pdftex.cfg can be found).

Even without fmtutil.cnf, if I run it in a directory of my own. 
creating foo.fmt requires different things than creating pdffoo.fmt.

looking at the contents of texmf/pdftex, adding pdftex to the default
TEXINPUTS would seem to have no possibility of disaster, actually. if
someone else wants to action this, they can. I don't dare, an hour or
two before I leave the country....

any change to TEXINPUTS is tricky since it may lead to unexpected files 
being loaded; (actually, here i always set TEXINPUTS to nothing

i agree with sebastian that changes to texmf.cnf are not something for the 
last minute; also, why only pdftex then

   .;$TEXMF/{tex,etex,pdftex,pdfetex,omega,eomega,nts}/{generic,}//

kind of tricky

I mean, that the is_printable vector have to be concerned to the internal
TeX encoding. In this case the function "isprint" from code above simply
asks if the "c" has positive value in is_printable vector.

The similar thinks are implemented in encTeX where is_printable vector is
named xprn vector. The relationship of this vector to the internal TeX
encoding (not to the input or output TeX encoding) is documented in
encTeX exactly. The reason is: one may set the xord/xchr vectors not
inverse each to other (for very special situations---this is possible
in encTeX) and the only fixed point is the TeX internal encoding
in such situations.

I mean that the bug was in TCX settings of is_printable vector, not in
interpretting of it. Moreower, the bug was that the TCX setting of
is_printable was not documented yet. My suggestion is of this
documateation is:

if
<input_code>  <tex_internal_code>
line occurs in TCX table then is_printable of <tex_internal_code>
is set to positive value.

This documentation will be harmony of the encTeX documentation and we will
not have an aditional incompatibility problem when encTeX will be
introduced.

no problem. 
But technically (and financially) there are no differences between 660(650) 
and 700, so I do not understand why there was a downgrade to 660. Because
it caused work and brought errors.

yes, I'm late...

I've done now every night till ~4 to 5am, getting up again at 7am. But to make 
things worst, while testing the installation, I've shredded a whole part of the 
main thingy. Now (Sunday/Monday night at 3:50) I'm back where I was some time ago.

I've added small notes to "ctan" directory (is on DVD main directories and 
should be documented). There is a ctan/texmf-extra tree where the new Fourier
fonts with the old Utopia now reside, plus Hans' uncompressed .afm files, aso.

I'll try to speed up, more in some minutes from my ever growing log to Karl,
Fabrice, and Staszek (anybody else interested from the translators list?).

Cheers, Volker

PS: Manfred and I spent at least 6 hours yesterday to copy and test the DVD
    iso images on a windows machine.

Hi,

I now included the last corrections and requests into the cover.
I expect that I may send them to the production company today.

They are as usual under http://lbdb01.gsi.de/cover/
where the only larger change is that I have put again a list of all
groups onto the front upon request. I found out that the best way to
do this is to put them in the black bottom bar. So the editors moved
up to the red part again -- it looks much better than putting the
group list in the red part.

So it should be sufficient to have a look an the front.

A-W asked for it, so there must be a difference.  And we have never

Anyway, it doesn't matter at this point, it's done now.

     for pdfTeX-based one needs also to create 
    another entry in texmf.cnf (for TEXINPUTS so pdftex.cfg can be found).

Gerben, as Seb asked, which formats, specifically, are causing you
support problems?

I had the impression that everything relevant was already included in
texmf.cnf.  Are people really making up their own new formats?  Surely
anyone capable of doing that is capable of adding a line to texmf.cnf?

Certainly it should be fixed, but ... now?

That said, like Seb, I don't see any files under texmf/tex/pdftex that
would cause a conflict.  So if this is really causing a great deal of
trouble for you, I guess we could try adding it to TEXINPUTS.

(BTW, I don't know who created pdftexinfo.tex but it's really ancient
history ...)

pdfamstex, but that one is only in the fmtuil.cnf I ship. I used to be 
able to change the fmtutil.cnf without having to mess with the default 
texmf.cnf. Then suddenly I got reports of problems from people and I am 
not that deep into TeX internals that I immediately knew what was going 
on.

Well, what happens is that people have learned a recipe for creating a 
new format (say something floating around on their institution) and 
they do that (script kiddie level). And suddenly this stops working 
after they have upgraded their installation through i-Installer and 
then logically they contact me.

> Certainly it should be fixed, but ... now?

I would like it to be. I' d rather had the TEXINPUTS default to be 
"find everything unless specifically forbidden" it is a friendlier 
default.

I cannot gauge the risks better than you can, but given that the most 
important formats have their own TEXINPUTS variant, I guess the risk is 
pretty low.

it's ok for me (although esthetically it would be better to have the 
editors in the red area and no user groups at the cover, unless one wants 
to prove that tex can have funny interlinespacing and typeset small font 
sizes; let's hope that next year either some user groups are obsolete or 
that cd's have grown to lp-size; i fear the moment that we are able to put 
tex live on a mini cd; it's also a nice showcase of funny logos and i hope 
that no customer of lehmans will consider all those lowered and raised 
capitals to be typo's  -)

    pdfamstex, but that one is only in the fmtuil.cnf I ship. 

So let's just add a TEXINPUTS.pdfamstex for now.  What should it be?
And, I am not sure how many texmf.cnf's have to change (with either
change) given the recent confusion, so can you or someone else check it in?

That seems definitely lower risk than changing the default TEXINPUTS.  I
take your point that the important formats all have their own TEXINPUTS
anyway, but still ...

    "find everything unless specifically forbidden" it is a friendlier 
    default.

I agree in theory, but in this particular case, I would say "more
dangerous" rather than "friendlier" :).

I have fixed that pdfamstex in my distribution, but what I was thinking 
of is the people creating local special formats which used to work and 
stopped working.

At least what would be helpful is informational. pdfTeX could give an 
error message that is more informative on a probable cause of the 
problem.

The bug is not related to the is_printable vector at all. All output
to terminal and log is not done according to the is_printable vector,
but according to the isprint() function. 

isprint() is a standard library function of the locale subsystem, not
related to TeX's is_printable vector at all.

The is_printable vector is considered for \write to filedescriptors <= 16.
And, yes, if the tcx file has
  <input_code>  <tex_internal_code>
then the tcx code in web2c sets
  is_printable[<tex_internal_code>] := 1;

So, to sum it up:
  1) \writes to filedesc <= 16: printability check done against the
     is_printable vector. This has been ok (only problem: documentation
     is not explicit about this)

  2) \writes to filedesc > 16: have been checked with isprint(), but
     the argument of the check was not the character that would be output.
     This was wrong, and my fix has fixed this.

Didn't sound good to me, so I decided to test the DVD under Solaris.

Since I have no DVD burner nor reader, I fetched and mounted the DVD image,
and run the install-tl.sh script. The installation was smooth (I went for
all collections); no problems encountered! After that (and fmtutil --all),
I processed a test file with latex, pdflatex and lambda: it worked like a charm. 

Some technical notes:
- the only format generated on the fly was tex.fmt, I think. I didn't expect
to have to run fmtutil by hand.
- install creates 10 'local' subdirectories in texmf-var. Unnecessary,
but it doesn't hurt anything.
- I used 'lofiadm' before mounting the iso image. This command is available 
under Solaris 8 and 9, but not 7. Just wondering, does anyone have a working
suggestion how to mount this image under Solaris 7?

I just did the same under XP and it worked. I installed the full
stuff. I also tried it out of the cdrom (dvd image) before installing
and it worked too.

So : what happened ? :-)

The problem wasn't TeXLive or CTAN related. 

Because the final DVD iso-image is around 6 GB I had to split the first draft 
iso image into 4 files. I spread those files over 2 DVDs.

The problem was that the HD Volker used for copying the iso image parts onto 
was an external HD connected with USB2. His Win XP (service pack free) didn't 
support USB2... It had a FAT32 which had to be upgraded to NTFS because FAT32 
can only hold files up to 4GB. 3 hours later after having enjoyed Win XP blue 
screens and crashes we gave up. I took his HD home using my PC. I have a 
Windows 2K for testing purposes (yes, it is paid) , also service  pack free. 
The copy action took now almost 2 hours. In the meanwhile I discovered that 
for Win2k or Win XP to support USB2.0 service packs are required.  Having 
finished the copy of the iso image to the external HD I installed service 
pack 4 for Win2K and a new copy of the iso image took only around 12 minutes 
or so.

Hope this detailed explanation helps to relax :-) 


BTW: The DVD iso image itself is in a good shape. Installation of TeXLive was 
fine and teh CTAN tree looks good as well.

It is not the case for "inst" which in turn generates all formats.
(for "full" scheme it is 55MB! I hate that). I told Sebastian many 
times that, but... 
Anyway, you do not need to use fmtutil, just run latex foo and
format should be made on the fly (or any format available in fmtutil.cnf).

We know that's texmf-local, as you wrote later. Windows installer provides 
the way to reject that on demand if not needed. For  install-tl.sh
I don't know how I can do that using <D> <2> options. Some people
persuaded that making a skeleton for users' local files would be handy.
(I keep my local files in texmf-var because it is more flexible,
Thomas knows what I'm talking about ;-)

Starting from today the DVD iso image is build automatically on a daily basis. 
It seems we are getting closer to the finish.

I remade tldoc for czech&slovak, russian and polish
and submited also preliminary version of tldoc/deutsch/

I spent many hours to help Volker, but cannot find what's
wrong when producing html version (pdf is OK):
1. tex4ht somehow does't like \toprule \midrule \bottomrule in tables,
   so I changed all to \hline (only Volker used that).
2. "warningbox" environment failed only for german version, so for a 
   moment I simply removed it for html version. I'm too tired now.

Can anybody try Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/deutsch/live.tex
Perhaps warningbox should be somehow redefined just for german version...
We should finish right now and there is no time for changing tex4ht.
Please help.

It seems that there are unprotected active chars. I'm not familiar with
ngerman so I can't comment much about it.

Maybe the simplest thing to do for this version would be to introduce a
\ConfigureEnv{warningbox} in case of html in the German live.tex.

Interesting distinction. Maybe required formats could be determined 
on the basis of chosen collections. Nothing to do with this TL, though.

Sure, if you are a single PC user. But when I test a set up, I also 
look at this with the site maintainer's eyes; for a site with hundreds 
of machines, 3 architectures and lots of users, all formats must 
be made beforehand, so it's important to make a mental note that 
CD vs DVD installations are different in this respect.

 > We know that's texmf-local, as you wrote later. 

The point was that texmf-local is local by name :-) So throwing
empty 'local' directories into texmf-local seems unnecessary.
No big deal though.

I can understand that. We recommend $HOME/texmf for users' own styles, 
fonts etc. Having texmf-local as an example of how to structure 
$HOME/texmf is a big help for them.

 > (I keep my local files in texmf-var because it is more flexible,

I've used texmf-local for years (and before it was introduced on
TL under this name). It's a perfect placeholder for truly local stuff - 
proprietary fonts, local uni classes and docs, while texmf-var is 
used for dynamically generated stuff and anything else that can just 
go away at the next upgrade.

can you mail that to me, because I got error reports and want to make 
the final German doc version till this evening. 

Have you seen (in my tldoc) that the root directories on DVD have
- ctan
- texmf-extra (the comments on this tree are missing from the tldoc-de)

Just as a bynote: I just talked to Frank Mittelbach about the LaTeX 
pre-release. It's not ready to distribute, so we drop the proposed 
directory "ctan/macros/latex/pre-release" from the DVD.

Additional directories you will find on DVD (but not on CTAN) are
- ctan/sites/context/www.pragma-ade.nl  with all manuals, context stuff, etc.
- ctan/sites/winedt/www.winedt.org      macros and additions for winedt
- ctan/sites/jp/                        japanese fonts, programs, etc.

please led the cron job running, if somebody else want to add to tldoc
by last minute. Btw, no harm is done by letting it run, or?
Is there a difference in cron job build images to hand built ones?

Manfred has a cron job to get all the stuff (DVD, CDs, CTAN, etc), so
every day there is a new "master" version ready for pressing the finals.
At the moment we have some time left, because the cover is in print and 
needs 4-5 day more than the DVD/CD.

Cheers, Volker

Ok, I'll let it run tonight at least, since you're still fixing.

    Is there a difference in cron job build images to hand built ones?

There is no difference technically.  Psychologically, though, I don't
want to let it keep running when we are done.  That just invites
disaster, some seemingly-minor checkin messing things up.  If we're
done, we're done.  We can test against something that is not planned to
change again, Manfred can build the final images, etc.

Also, it would be ideal for Patrick and Boris to have exactly the same
image that we distribute.  Patrick, at least, cannot wait five more days.

have been premature, but ok, let's be optimistic :).

Manfred, I expect you'll have to change your script accordingly.  Sorry
for the late notice.

We should not bzip2 the images until we are really sure they are the
final ones, as that is what will trigger the CTAN mirroring (as I
understand it; I'm writing to them now).  Seb removed the tl7 images.

I'm not so happy changing the stuff for someone. Not so sure about 
epstopdf, perhaps OSX needs such strange preamble, so I leave that.
As for fmtutil I'm quite sure that Gerben didn't noticed the last
correction made by Thomas, so I will replace it for Mac OSX.

Last year I have written to the people who maintain this and they told 
me they would provide an update (which never came). I think my version 
is better an what is there, amongst others it is more end-of-line style 
proof. On Mac OS X, that is essential. Given the improvements, it is 
probably better that other architectures use my version.

I would not know why this should be different, and I suspect this is 
not the case with the just released new compile.

Oh, apologies.

In the past, I sent Sebastian a link to a .tar.bz2 which contained 
*everything* from a 'make install'. He took from that what he needed, 
but I never knew which part from the archive he took. My production 
system now creates split archives for different parts of TeX, hence the 
'set'

If someone tells me where in the Depot this should go, I could even do 
this myself, given that Sebastian is away.

I suspect only the bin (and maybe the lib) directory as these are 
architecture-dependent.

2. replaced pictures prepared by Volker (in texmf/doc/tldoc

3. all doc/tldoc/ versions remade with new pictures
   (they doesn't need tpm changes, though are somehow bigger ;-)
4. german doc source installed, russian corrected, czech makefile touched.

That's all! Sebastian, would you please remake images and

(no time myself now)

(actually, the first dutch user who complains will kindly be asked to 
translate manuals -)

lib is not needed in TeX Live since these are static libs.
includes are not needed as well since they are architecture-dependent.

yes, sometimes. but that doesnt need making ad hoc new formats. the
context formats are part of the standard setup

    That's all! 

I made the top-level liesmich changes, and updated the doc one more time
with a picture dimension per volker.

    Sebastian, would you please remake images and
    announce the official finis (you are the chief!).

He is the chief :), but I'm not sure if he'll be online soon.

So I've started the image rebuild, fingers crossed.  It usually takes
about an hour to do all three.

There is something weird going on here.

[dumbledore:Build/i-packages/tex.ii2] gerben% bzcat tex.9.tar.bz2 | 
gnutar tvf - | grep elatex

turns up empty here. So how is it possible you have these when I do not 
ship them? Are we certain that you have actually installed what I have 
prepared???

Furthermore:

[dumbledore:Build/i-packages/tex.ii2] gerben% bzcat tex.9.tar.bz2 | 
gnutar tvf - | grep lambda
lrwxr-xr-x unknown/unknown       0 2003-09-23 21:54

lrwxr-xr-x unknown/unknown       0 2003-09-23 21:54 
./bin/powerpc-apple-darwin6.6/altpdflambda -> altpdftex

So no elambda in my stuff. But I run just a make install. Why does my 
make install not produce a elambda if it should?

Perhaps the directory mf was trying to output to was not writable?
I was able to generate larm1000 in my tl2003 install.

We really should get the actual output filename and errno into that

it's writeable, in fact there was no lh/lh-t2a in /opt/tex/texmf-var/fonts/tfm/,

i didn't check it, but is the cm super cmr part still there (some of it can 
go because of lm)

also not sure, but are mf sources of cmr still needed for the live system

A known bug. teTeX's PROBLEMS file has:

- Solaris 8/9 with gcc-3.2 and gcc-3.2.1: "gftopk: fatal: putbyte(255)
  failed." Solution: recompile gftopk without optimization, e.g.
    (cd texk/web2c; rm -f gftopk.o; make gftopk CFLAGS=)
  Using the SUN compilers is another possible way around this bug.

    - Solaris 8/9 with gcc-3.2 and gcc-3.2.1: "gftopk: fatal: putbyte(255)

I guess you can add 7 to the list.

How unfortunate.  Kaja, are you there?  Or maybe we can get the gftopk
from tl7 for sparc; I doubt anything else about it has changed.  Hmm.

Maksym, you didn't say which Solaris version you ran gftopk on.
Does gftopk itself fail, if you simply run it by hand?

I just tried the *current* gftopk on the larm1000.600gf that is at
http://tug.org/~karl/larm1000.600gf on both sparc-solaris2.7 and
sparc-solaris2.8 machines, and it *succeeded* both times.  Does it
succeed for you?

So, I surmise something else is going on.

It would take me a long time to download the whole ISO and install it on
Sparc.  So unless someone else can reproduce this, I suggest we simply
move ahead.  If there is a bug, we can always put a patch on the web page.

I generated the larm* pk fonts myself under Linux, at least -- russian
tldoc needed them.

I would like to declare TeX Live 2003 well and firmly CLOSED. I don't
_care_ if there are bugs left or some oddities. It is time we lifted up
our heads and howled "finished" at the moon. The final .isos will be
ready in about an hour.

In traditional fashion, here are this year's awards, the Toscars:

 * for last-minute brinkmanship, the winner is (again!) Hans, who wanted
a ConTeXt upgrade seconds before the bell went; commiserations to
Volker, who fought hard for the award with his late translations

 * for Services to Checking, as usual, Staszek, without whom a million
bugs would still be alive today

 * for Panicking, Fabrice, who wanted to change the Texlive licensing at
the last minute 

 * for Laziness, Sebastian, for doing less and less work while still
claiming credit

 * for Persistence, Gerben, who _still_ didn't get the changes he needed
into the source to make it civilised for his users

 * for Surprisingly Proper Behaviour, Addison Wesley, who understood the
issue about copyright

 * for Being Bad, Springer Verlag, who are on the verge of receiving a
"cease and desist" letter from a lawyer unless we hear from them soon

Lastly,

* for Cheerful and Patient Leadership of a Very Long Process, Karl. I
cannot thank him enough for the work he has put in this year, which I
believe has saved the project.

and of course, thanks!!! to the ever increasing, both in number and
reliability, of people who put their share of hard work in to get this
release finished.

they will scream anyway since tex is now etex and next time pdfetex -)

when i am bored i'll have a look at the file list once the cd is on my desk;

(fabrice, isn't it possible to make the win binaries leaner by removing 
some tables from them; i remember something about info being in win exe's 
that is not needed)

For Spirit, again Sebastian, who -even if he has lost faith in backslashes- 
keeps going in this weird world of texies. Without you the tex world would 
be a less interesting environment. I envy your energy and am grateful for

I think a good project for someone next year is to specify the REAL
minimum TeX toolkit for the person who does not have any historical
associations. So no dvi support at all, no metafont, no Computer Modern
at all (latin modern instead), etc. pdfetex only. no omega (sorry, guys,
until its stable and does PDF....). metapost, OK. bibtex, ok. no ps
utilities.

A real minimal pdfeTeX live? Sounds nice and should be doable on
a credit card. :-)

There is NO code to create the elambda automatically for now. I created
the links manually. Someone should add code to Makefile.in, but I cannot
do this (no idea from auto* stuff)

for context this is some 50 MEG (fonts take up space -); i have a batch 
file that generates subset of tex live (so that i can make small snapshots 
with updated contexts and keep them in archives); the coming year i'll put 
it somewhere for 'external' users to pick up and play with so i expect that 
for the next tex live i can provide you with the scripts to 'collect' what 
is needed for context (+plain). Only pdf (i have dvips on it just for the 
sake of generating outlines using pstoedit). [dvi is still needed for cjk 
users who want to use dvipdfmx, but that's only one extra binary)

It is certainly time to abandon dvi and get on with other things like XML, 
i18n, and getting the bugs out of 3rd party tools (gs, the xpdf
toolkit, etc.) to make pdf do everything we need.  For a long time people
have seen TeX as operating outside the realm of mainstream document processing.
People with a strong background in PDF workflows find dvips rather quaint, 
although they like the way TeX lays out a page.  And, for a group that depends
on very limited resources, it is important that TeX Live efforts leverage
"mainstream" tools and formats (fonts, PDF, XML, ...).

Hans: Can you generate outlines using a pdf-->ps tool?  In principle you can
get outlines directly from PDF using "gs -dNOCACHE" and the epswrite 
device.  In the past there were bugs in gs pdf support, but now that my
list of long-standing gs bugs (how many new bugs have been
introduced in recent versions?) is down to handling gradient fills from 
OpenOffice.org, it is time to revisit tasks that involve dvips.  This
isn't just so we can take "dvi" out of TeX Live 2003, it is because dvips
is resolution dependent and the workarounds aren't always adequate (e.g.,
when you need extreme scaling).

hm, one reason for me for abandoning dvi is the fact that i cannot show all 
(type1) fonts and graphics, and acrobat is not that slow

>Contrary to pdf it IS device independent, while pdf (version 4 version 5
>version 6 subversions, version linux, version windows, viewing problems,
>argggg) is just pain in the ...

hm, i know of problems, but not so much with tex docs; esp since the pdf 
produced by pdftex is quite simple; most problems are related to fonts, and 
tex users do nasty things with fonts (dvi-ps suffers from that as well); it 
maybe that the mac/linux viewers lack behind, but GS is pretty good 
nowadays, we only need someone to make that more widget aware.

dvi is pretty system dependent: one needs a tex system comparable to the 
one used by the author, as well as files in the same encoding, in order to 
view the files; also, one has to distribute graphics; if we want to draw 
new users to tex, dvi is no option, esp nowadays when people publish on the 
web, use color, nice fonts, special features etc.

also, tex live is not so much meant for user swith their own setup who can 
manage all their fonts and resources etc, but (from the user groups 
perspective) meant for tjose who depend on others for their installation; 
fo rthem, pdf is the way to go (unless the tex community comes up with 
dvi++ with embedded fonts, graphics, accompanied bij viewers that can 
handle color, transparency, shading, interactive features, forms, etc

maybe true. but sometimes we have to accept that the world is not doing
the right thing, and we have to decide whether to join in, or fight.
There are so many battles like this, is dvi the thing you'll go to the
scaffold for?

I think anyone who read that long discussion about tcx, enctex, etc
would conclude that TeX has serious i18n problems :-}

I think that killing it is not what is proposed. it is simply making
decisions about what goes into a genuinely minimal TeX

vi, with no fonts, no picture inclusion, no standard
color/linking/graphics is simply not competing with PDF. it does
something different. I, for one, don't want _both_.

I didn't mean that I think dvi is the format which is best for all
purposes, but it IS good for many purposes, that's the reason why I do
NOT want to get rid of it.

On the contrary, I really enjoy the ability to produce pdfs directly and
send them, using all my expensively bought fonts.

I do not want to play out one against the other, but nothing beats xdvi
in viewing speed, source specials, jump into editor location, (and xdvi
CAN do type1 fonts, and graphics!).

PDF is good for distribution purposes. Also important. Yes

But anyway, I am gone to Malaysia, see you in 2 weeks.

Best wishes

Norbert

Hi,

I just copied the tl texmf-tree over my curren tone, and saw that it has 
some 33303 files, if i'd known i could have smuggle some extra 30 files in 
there.

Anyway, i wonder if there's any bigger system around. (i don't know how 
many file entries fit on a cd).

Hi,

Karl asked to look at the tex live page ...

I browsed the tree (there is apointer on the page) and noticed that the 
binaries have old dates (maybe this is rightm but i thought that they were 
regenerated); take for instance:

   http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/Contents/live/bin/win32-static/

dated august 27 (or it must be that ie-ftp view messes things up)

They weren't regenerated after last changes ;-)
Anyway that's not so serious problem as they are only on dvd
and are not installed by texsetup.

Subject: [tex-live] Need some help with utopia mapping/locations(?) problem
	(updmap)
Message-ID: <8DFEFE98-F1B8-11D7-AF03-000A95901A7E@rna.nl>

Hello,

since the new TL and recent changes in updmap and locations of map  
files I am experiencing the following problem. When I use utopia.sty  
and I have added utopia.map via updmap, still mktexpk is being called  
to generate a pk font. As this used in the previous setup with updmap  
and locations, I suspect this is a settings/location issue. Here are  
the tex file and the output, what causes this?

  I suspect that something might have changed in the encoding? putb8r  
and stuff is what is in my utopia.map, while ot1put.fd contains other  
names. However, adding usepackage[T1]{fontenc} does not help. On the  
other hand, this used to work before the updmap locations change, so it  
might not be this.

Can someone help me?

So it is a texmf.cnf settings problem. But as far as I know, I have set 
all the right settings. So I am missing one. Which one? I use the 
standard texmf.cnf from TL2003 with some overrides by myself which 
afaik have nothing to do with this:

% Our directory setup as explained in $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/README.gwtex
% TEXMFMAIN contains the TEXMF tree installed by make install of the

% TEXMFGW contains GW specific defaults and additions
TEXMFGW = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.gwtex
% TEXMFLOCAL contains any local system TeXadmin overrides
TEXMFLOCAL = $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.local

VARTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL
% User texmf trees can be catered for like this...

Hi,

I've just downloaded texlive2003-inst iso file and install it on my win98 
machine. Instalation was ok, but when I run csplain.bat it only writes OFF to 
the command line. I look into it, I've found the problem. Lines are separated 
byt #10, not #13#10 and windows shell can't execute such kind of file, it 
thinks, that it is one command. Almost every cs* bat file is damaged and some 
of others too. 

Second bug is, that in csplain.bat is wrong argument passed to tex.exe, there 
is -default=translate-file=cp1250cs and should be 
-default-translate-file=cp1250cs. tex always say "can't find file 
"translate-file=cp1250cs.tcx"

I hope, images should be changed, or write this somewhere on the page, 
especially cstug should mention this on the page. 

Tibor

In teTeX's ChangeLog, I have:
        * Adobe Utopia fonts + support files removed; the fonts are not
        free software

I think that in TL, utopia was removed, too. Maybe, the metrics are
still there, but without the actual fonts, they are quite useless.
The change of locations of map files is completely irrelevant, I think.

I know this. I have them separately on my system (outside teTeX / TL).

Please have a look at the second message I sent out on this one.

Which search PATH is that (for pdfTeX and dvips)? Hmm can it be that 
old psfonts.map entries are found before the new ones in the new 
locations?

TEXPSHEADERS = 
.;$TEXMF/{{dvips,fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,}},pdftex,tex,fonts/type1}//

I think so. So what happens is that updmap has begun writing in a new 
location, but that existing files in previous locations (dvips) will be 
found first. Am I correct? Yes I am, and the funny thing is that what 
it finds is the one in the distributed main tree and not in 
texmf.local:

hermione-a:~/tmp gerben$ kpsewhich pdftex.map
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/dvips/config/pdftex.map
hermione-a:~/tmp gerben$ updmap >&/dev/null
hermione-a:~/tmp gerben$ kpsewhich pdftex.map
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/dvips/config/pdftex.map

Ugh. Can we/I change TEXPSHEADERS so that the new locations in font are 
found before the ones in TEXMFMAIN etc?

BTW, texconfig localsetup also complains about the new variable:

hermione-a:~/tmp gerben$ sudo texconfig localsetup

texconfig has found the following environment variables set:

  TEXPSHEADERS = 
.;/{{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,}},dvips,pdftex,tex,fonts/type1}//

This path prohibits a default expansion. as it contains no : at either
end, nor :: somewhere in the middle.  Please make sure, that these paths
are ok, and otherwise change or unset them.  If you continue with wrong
values for the above variables, texconfig might run into trouble when
locating files on the disk.

Note that you can refer to the default path by giving an "empty" path
component (i.e. a colon in front or in the end, or a doubled colon
somewhere in the middle).

If you set TEXINPUTS, e.g. to :~/TeX/macros, (La)TeX will search along
the default path and then in ~/TeX/macros.

For more information, see the Kpathsea and the teTeX manual.

I don't believe there is enough time for Manfred to download new images.
Besides, there have been a number of other changes checked in, so it
would be quite an unknown quantity.  That does not seem good.

If someone can send Manfred the corrected .bat files, perhaps he could
stick them into place and remake at least the live image locally, since
that's just running mkisofs.  I don't think there's an easy way he can
remake the demo and inst images.

We can put the patch on the web page, anyway.

Maybe next year we can start serious testing *before* the deadline.

Aghrr... I checked .bat files several times, but from time to time
some of them returned again to depot having LF instead of CRLF:
cs*.bat
pdf*.bat
platex-pl.bat
fontinst.bat

All other .bat are OK.

Hi Fabrice,

As Karl pointed out there is not enough time for downloading a new image. 

I suggest to fix it for the dvd iso image as follows:

a) I change the  '-default=translate-file' into i '-default-translate-file' in 
cslatexk.bat  and csplain.bat

b) For all *.bat files which are reported to be ' MS-DOS batch file text' 
instead of 'ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators' I change the line 
terminators.

I didn't check how it looks like for demo and inst cd. Howcer at this stage I 
wouldn' like to touch demo and inst CDs.


What do you think?

Then email the zip file and I could just put it into the dvd iso image. :-)

PS   If it is in inst and demo as well? There would be enough time to build a 
new image. I just have to download it and burn it on CD.....I don't know if 
Sebastian find this a good idea?

Aside from time, the other problem is that there have been other
checkins since we made the "final" images, and no particular testing, so
we could be going backwards.  Thus, I don't think we should risk it.  I
know it is very unfortunate, but ...

Sebastian,

I got the corrections from Staszeck (thanks Staszek).

We have two possibilities:

1) I fix the dvd iso image and you provide two new images for inst and demo.

2) I fix inst and demo as well. In this case I would go to the production 
company two days later because I want Klaus to check this the same intensity 
as he would have done this evening.


Whatever you like is fine for me :-)

The old are in the current teTeX-texmf which I use as a basis, so  
removal is not my first option. I rather not mess around with your  
stuff.

I would like to suggest a change for TeX Live & teTeX. Give the new  
location a precedence higher than the old. This is common sense. What  
is available in an old location is than a fall back for the absence of  
something that has been created in the new location. But if it is  
created in the new location this takes precedence. The current setting  
means that old has a higher precedence than new, and that is the wrong  
way around. The new setup should supercede the old if it is available.

Apart from that, I have been wrestling with this to get it working at  
all. But it does not help when I change it to

TEXPSHEADERS  
=.;$TEXMF/{{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,}},dvips,pdftex,tex,fonts/type1}//

The pdftex.map in /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/map is still  
not found first

hermione-a:~ gerben$ kpsewhich pdftex.map
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/dvips/config/pdftex.map
hermione-a:~ gerben$ ls  
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map

hermione-a:~/tmp gerben$ kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXPSHEADERS'

texmf.tetex,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf}/{{fonts/{map,enc}/ 
{dvips,}},dvips,pdftex,tex,fonts/type1}//

I keep getting the same problem. There must be something I am missing  
here.

Why so sad? ;-) I've just checked both "inst" and "demo" on win xp
and everything installed well (for "demo" - live scheme, for "inst"
- full scheme).
I know well that the last changes were made in a hurry and as for me
I also don't like such a pressure, but I'd say that the whole team
made their best. So again, thank you all.

if i remember right, there are tools that let you edit an image; if these 
cost money, this should not be a limitation, so i'd say, if needed, go 
ahead and buy them (you can charge the user groups)

Subject: [tex-live] The fonts/{map,enc} location problem (updmap)
Message-ID: <4662280E-F25F-11D7-8EA7-000A95901A7E@rna.nl>

Summary of what went before:

updmap now writes in TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map and TEXCONFIG and other  
variables have been changed to include those directories. Sadly,  
though, the new variables search the old subdirectory location before  
the new one, so you can run updmap until you die, but as long as stuff  
is (still) available in older subdirectories, it will not be used. This  
is problematic in my situation as my distribution is used to update  
existing setups (with old updmap results in temf.local) as well because  
my distribution is based on teTeX's texmf tree (which contains older  
updmap results in the dvips subdirectory).

Solution:

I have changed the following variables in my texmf.cnf to repair this  
buglet.

TEXPSHEADERS            =  
.;$TEXMF/{{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,},dvips},pdftex,tex,fonts/type1}//
TEXCONFIG               = $TEXMF/{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,},dvips}//
TEXPSHEADERS.gsftopk    =  
.;$TEXMF/{{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,},dvips},pdftex,tex,fonts/ 
{type1,truetype}}//
DVIPDFMINPUTS           =  
.;$TEXMF/{dvipdfm,{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,},dvips}}//
XDVIINPUTS              =  
.;$TEXMF/{xdvi,{fonts/{map,enc}/{dvips,},dvips}}//

And now indeed the stuff in the new fonts/map locations generated by  
updmap is found before the old stuff in the dvips/config location.

I would like to propose a similar change in TeX Live, the current  
situation is not robust.

Some discussions on what to do with each of the ones above might still  
be a good idea (TEXCONFIG seems to be enough for this problem, but  
maybe similar 'update' problems exist for the other variables)

Hi,

In the early times of context i distributed the patterns in separate files. 
Then i was strongly advised to use the existing one. This went ok till now. 
When I generate a  the czech/slovak format (for the czech interface) i get:

! This file can be used only in babelised formats!.
l.9 ...ile can be used only in babelised formats!}

for the cz and sk pattern files. Now, context is pretty multi lingual but 
not babelised at all.

I really think that we should look into patterns:

- proper filename convention
- consistent internals
- no package dependent internals

The current situation forces me to start distributing my own instances of 
pattern files again. I agree with the distributers (and tex liv ebuilders) 
that we should minimize the number of duplicate files, but it seems that 
there is no clean way to make sure that independent (generic) files stay 
independent.

(A similar problems occurs with the tfm/afm files for urw fonts: they are 
missing because they are 'similar' (but not the same) as their adobe 
counterarts. This may be true for latex users but ...)

Concerning the cz/sk patterns:

i think that skhyph.tex and czhyph.tex should be moved out of

   /tex/generic/hyphen

and into

   /tex/latex/hyphen

the czech file loads "czhyphen.tex" and surprise, this one is in

   /tex/texmf/tex/csplain/czhyphen.tex

so it's not generic, which leaves us with *no* generic patterns for cz and sk!

(if i remember right, the czech patterns were dual coded ec/il files, and i 
remember sitting next to petr sojka when we figured this out -)

i'll probably add the old files to the context distribution

[there should be a kind of standard for coding hyphenation files]

It seems sensible to me, but I guess that Thomas and Olaf are the ones

BTW, those paths seem incredibly complex.  I cannot mentally compute the
expansions.  Triple braces, double dvips's ... it's too bad.  It seems
we've constructed a whole lot of complication for ourselves.  Sigh.

then this is (again) a good moment to start thinking about using the same 
library for pdftex and dvips for accessing the same map files, whicm means 
that the format of that file needs to be redefined in a more proper 
database syntax (maybe xml, but it may be to slow on such big files).

Subject: [tex-live] tug.org service interruption Tuesday, Sep 30
Message-ID: <16248.18191.52015.437878@sparkle.daimi.au.dk>



Dear all,

Due to moving key servers into a new, permanent server room
at the Computer Science Dept, a major service interruption 
is scheduled  for tomorrow:

    Tuesday Sep 30th, between 07:00 - 10:00 MET. 

In particular:

07.00 - 08.30 MET   Most of the network out of service
08.30 - 10.00 MET   Servers out of service during periods

Efforts will be taken to minimize the downtime, but do expect 
significant disturbances of web, mail etc services on tug.org
during this time.

Regards
Kaja

I don't mind changing the paths like this for now.

The whole reason for putting enc / map files to their proper place
was to make things simpler. And, indeed, as soon as kpathsea starts
to support a few new formats and as soon as we have ported our
applications to these new formats, we can simplify the search paths
again.

TEXPSHEADERS is a good example. As soon as we have fixed all applications
to use the T1FONTS path for type1 fonts, we can remove fonts/type1 from
that search path.  pdftex// and tex// are used to find some map files
(e.g. contex's). As soon as these map files are in fonts/map, these path
elements can be removed, too.

In the end, TEXPSHEADERS should just be
  TEXPSHEADERS = .;$TEXMF/dvips//

It would have been helpful, if we had support for the new search paths
in kpathsea right now. That would have given everyone a good basis for
adjustments of drivers. Unfortunately, Olaf did not have the time to
check in these changes in time.

I just have finnished thinking about this and I still believe that the
search path library in itself is a good thing.

We could use it for example to make that map file change without touching
a line of code in any application. Just by changing a few search paths.

Sure, you are right that we have to make sure that search paths don't
get abused. I think that cleaning this up is something that we have to
put on our list for the next TeX Live.

Thomas
