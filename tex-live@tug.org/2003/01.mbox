Message-ID: <Pine.HPX.4.50.0301021344100.5854-100000@smaug.imf.au.dk>

If it's not already possible I have a small request regarding the
following problem (Linux version)):

When installing new fonts on our system I use the `updmap' script for
including the .map file.

The problem is that when this is done, the updated files in texmf-var is
now only readable for me (I own the installation), but it should be
readable for everyone. I forget to manually change the permissions.

Wouldn't it be better (for TeX Live 8) that the updmap script (or what
ever script causes this) sets the files to be readable for everyone?

Thanks. I just have submitted change #2620:
  add umask 022 to updmap; generated files are now always world-readable

Subject: [tex-live] Question about importing images into TeX/LaTeX documents...
Message-ID: <1041547706.11982.12.camel@gonzo.agamura.com>

Hi folks,

I'm quite a newbie in the TeX/LaTeX arena...
but i find it very exciting!

Well, I read some books, and now I'm able
to write TeX documents and generate PDF or
PS output.

I use to produce graphics in PNG format, and
I need to generate PDF as well as PS output.
To accomplish that, I have to keep the same
image twice: one in PNG format and another one
in EPS format.

I would like to know if there is a way to keep
the image just in PNG or PS format and be able to
generate either PDF output or PS output.

I know, it would be possible to keep the image
just in EPS format, generate a DVI file, and
then from the DVI file generate either the PDF
or PS output. The problem by doing so, is that
the quality of the PDF output is really poor!
I tried to load the 'times.sty' package: well,
the result was better, but not so good as PDF
output generated via pdflatex.

Does anybody know how could I solve this problem?

Thanks in advance for your support!

Nice to hear :).

    I would like to know if there is a way to keep
    the image just in PNG or PS format and be able to
    generate either PDF output or PS output.

It is possible to convert between all of these, in fact there are
several programs which do so.

To go from png to ps, you can run pngtopnm | pnmtops.
To go from png to pdf, you can add | ps2pdf to the pipeline.
To go from ps to png, you can run pstopnm | pnmtopng.

ps2pdf is part of Ghostscript (www.ghostscript.com).
The others are part of the netpbm tools (netpbm.sourceforge.net).

There is also a program called convert, part of imagemagick
(www.imagemagick.org), which can at least handle ps/pnm, not sure about
the others.

All of these are included in most GNU/Linux distributions, to my
knowledge (e.g., red hat 8.0).  On other platforms, you'll have to
install them.

With some images, I've had better luck converting into jpeg with cjpeg
and then using various jpgto* programs to convert back out.

Hope this helps,

Yes.  This is a well-known problem: for a discussion and visual
comparison, see

	http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/outline-vs-bitmap-fonts.html

The fix is fortunately easy, but depends on your local TeX DVI driver
configuration: essentially, you need to get the DVI driver to use
outline, rather than bitmap, fonts.

On Giuseppe's problem of maintaining both .eps and .png files for use
with TeX and PDFTeX, why not use make to keep them in sync, with the
(presumably resolution-independent) PostScript figure file as the
master from which the bitmap PNG file is generated.

Even better, avoid using bitmap figures when better alternatives are
available: here is an example (golfer.ps is widely available, and
included in ghostscript distributions and installations: it is also on
the TeXLive 7 CD as texmf/doc/latex/overpic/golfer.ps.gz):

% distill golfer.ps 	# make golfer.pdf (could use ps2pdf if distill is not available)

% cat pdf.ltx
\documentclass[]{article}

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

\begin{document}

This is a PDF figure:

\centerline{\includegraphics[clip=true,scale=0.1]{golfer.pdf}}

\centerline{\includegraphics[clip=true,scale=0.2]{golfer.pdf}}

\centerline{\includegraphics[clip=true,scale=0.4]{golfer.pdf}}

\end{document}

% pdflatex pdf.ltx

This produces pdf.pdf with three images of increasing size, and the
images retain their quality even under gv's maximum 64x magnification.

well, TTF file is not really just a header file :)
afaik, dvips, cannot directly use (embed) truetype fonts.

 GW> But not for gsftopk as it uses (if I understand matters well)

it might be better to convert TTF files to type42 fonts, which could
be included into dvips - it will think of them as if it were type1
fonts - but you should disable partial font downloading for them.

this is better since type42 fonts are equivalent to TTF: they remain
vector fonts and do not loose quality (e.g. truetype hinting). using
tools like ttf2pfb will give poor results on some good truetype fonts,
as they drop truetype hinting while converting; but type42 is
equivalent to ttf and does not loose any features.

if you use gsftopk, you get even worse results: bitmap fonts.

you can convert TTF fonts to type42 with e.g. ttftot42 or ttfps:
http://ftp.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42
http://starship.python.net/crew/da/fonts/ttfps.tar.gz

do not forget to disable partial embedding for these fonts in dvips
map file (use << instead of <).

pdftex needs ANSI C++ and C compilers. Just look at libs/xpdf/README:

    Compatibility
    -------------
    ...
    much any system which runs X11 and has Unix-like libraries.  You'll
    need ANSI C++ and C compilers to compile it.

And I think that many other parts in TeX Live just won't compile if you
don't use an ANSI C compatible compiler.

So, I don't think that we'd loose much if you'd drop support for pre-ANSI
compilers.

My main argument pro ANSI-C is T1lib, which is used by both xdvik
and xpdf in the default builds and uses all these features;
e.g. in t1base.h:
void T1_PrintLog( char *func_ident, char *msg_txt, int level, ...);

In xdvik-22.40o (released 2002-10-16), we've effectively disabled
all K&R compatibility macros and decided to go for ANSI C only,
and we've had no complaints so far.

Best,
Stefan

    Does anyone know whether it would be feasible to assume that all the
    compilers used to compile TeX-live are ANSI C?  

FWIW, I agree with the other replies that this would be ok.  Many common
GNU packages require ANSI C now.

The most common non-ANSI compiler was SunOS 4.x's cc, and since Sun has
completely dropped support for that, it's turning out to be ok that
things don't compile with it anymore.  (And anyone who still has it
and is using it almost certainly has gcc anyway.)

Well, could you tell me how can I get my DVI driver to use outline
fonts (e.g. Bluesky)? If I've well understood, I should modify the
psfont.map file, isn't it? Eventually, where can I find more info?

Till now, I've bought the following two books:
The TeXbook, by Donald E. Knuth
A Guide to LaTeX, by Helmut Kopka & Patrick W. Daly

Are there other sources of interest?

Please call it Standard C, not ANSI C; the ISO Standard has replaced
the ANSI one, and the C Standards committee recommends ``Standard C''
as the informal designation of ``International ISO/IEC Standard
9899:1999(E),  Programming languages -- C''.

I routinely build and test code with more than 60 C and C++ compilers
on up to 16 different UNIX platforms.  Today, the ONLY system that I
have access to that lacks a C89 compiler is HP-UX 10.01; the vendor
has one, but it costs extra, and the local management chose not to pay
for it.  I cannot build gcc successfully on that particular system, so
I've pretty much given up on using it for code development.

I have made a decision in my own coding projects to make all new
projects C89 (and C++98 and C99) conformant.  However, I will not
remove K&R support from older code, since this would take time that I
lack, and would serve no useful purpose.  Function prototypes in such
code look like this:

	extern void do_ISBN_file ARGS((const char *pathlist_,const
	char *name_));

and function declarations look like this:

	#if defined(HAVE_STDC)
	void
	do_ISBN_file(const char *pathlist, const char *name)
	#else /* K&R style */
	void
	do_ISBN_file(pathlist,name)
	const char *pathlist;
	const char *name;
	#endif
	{
	...
	}

Under pure C89, they would look like this:

	extern void do_ISBN_file (const char *pathlist_,const char *name_);

	void
	do_ISBN_file(const char *pathlist, const char *name)
	{
	...
	}

A lot of the Web2c code already has similar wrappers on function
declarations and definitions.

However, if a decision is made to move TeXlive coding to Standard C,
then the code should be made strictly C89 conformant, including correct
prototypes of all user-defined functions, explicit declaration of all
variables and functions (i.e., no assumed int types), proper
conversion casts in function returns (e.g., malloc()), and avoidance
of C++ keywords as user-defined entities.   It will then be possible
to compile it with C++ compilers too.  In every project where I've
done this, C++ compilations have turned up insidious errors that C
compilers on many different platforms, including non-UNIX ones like MS
DOS, DEC TOPS-20, and DEC VAX VMS, never caught, so the effort has
always been worthwhile.

The easiest way to check this is to compile the code under a strict
C++ compiler (g++ is by default NOT strict, although it has objects to
make it pickier).  The best one that I've found is SGI's CC.

As an experiment, I made a copy of the web2c-7.3.7 build tree on a
local SGI system, and tried compilation with "make CC=CC -i".  Here is
a sampling of the kind of errors reported:

CC -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  -I. -I. -I.. -I./..   -g  -c tie.c
cc-1312 CC: ERROR File = ../kpathsea/getopt.h, Line = 125
  More than one instance of overloaded function "getopt" has "C" linkage.

  extern KPSEDLL int getopt ();
                     ^
CC -g  -c ./alloca.c
cc-1020 CC: ERROR File = ./alloca.c, Line = 171
  The identifier "size" is undefined.

  alloca (size)
          ^

cc-1129 CC: ERROR File = ./alloca.c, Line = 172
  A left brace ("{") is expected at this point.

       unsigned size;
       ^

cc-1020 CC: ERROR File = ./alloca.c, Line = 198
  The identifier "free" is undefined.

          free ((pointer) hp);  /* Collect garbage.  */
          ^

cc-1020 CC: ERROR File = ./alloca.c, Line = 212
  The identifier "size" is undefined.

    if (size == 0)
        ^

cc-1136 CC: ERROR File = ./alloca.c, Line = 218
  Too many arguments in function call.

      register pointer newm = malloc (sizeof (header) + size);
                                      ^

cc-1020 CC: ERROR File = ./alloca.c, Line = 222
  The identifier "abort" is undefined.

        abort();
        ^

This is not horribly bad: Perhaps only a few hours, or a day or two,
would be needed to clean up the entire Web2C tree.  Tools like cproto
and gcc's protoize can be used to help automate this job.

Some background: I'm working on kpathsea, trying to clean up bits and
pieces, and looking at the code in general.

One thing I'd like to have is a situation where the published
interface for kpathsea does not depend on configure macros.  This
makes kpathsea's and web2c's configure scripts independent of each
other, which in turn makes it easier to turn kpathsea into its own
package.

The prototypes-or-not bits and pieces are an obvious roadbump here.

It's an easy mistake to make.  In fact, I'm quite willing to tolerate
substandard C as long as I can have (revised list):

- prototypes
- const
- void
- stddef.h
- stdarg.h

stddef.h is of interest as it is the "cheapest" header which defines
size_t and NULL.  But I could do without if needed.

[...]

But I'like want to avoid using those wrappers in the "new" public
kpathsea headers.

Agreed.

Agreed, implicit int turned out to be an abomination.

That's not a C conformance issue.  (While C++ wants it, it can be
argued that this is bad C style, as it can hide errors.)

Assuming we know what those keywords are today.  :^)

The Omega project did this for web2c/kpathsea.  I don't recall if they
were able to turn up true errors this way, what I recall was the C++
keywords and (in C) lack of redundant casts issue.  Those bits should
be fixed now...

I've access to that one.  (The Omega people I believe used g++.)

That's a painful header...

And that file is a known problem...for one thing it doesn't use the
"wrappers" at all...for another I'm not sure it is really required, so
perhaps it can be dropped in its entirety.

Yes, of course you can convert the final pdf file (produced by pdftex)
to ps using either acroread or pstoeps (which comes with xpdf).

It is also possible to generate a dvi file first and then convert it
to ps using dvips and to pdf using dvipdfm.  But I suppose that
dvipdfm is not in texlive yet.

The first way is the easiest.  Just forget everything about ps until
your document is ready.

If you want to use pdftex for pdf and dvips for ps you have to provide
two files for each picture, but this is usually no problem.

If you are using the LaTeX graphicx package, it is important that you
specify the filename without any extension,
i.e. \includegraphics{name_without_extension}. 

LaTeX will then find the proper file automatically.

Though pdftex is able to include png files directly, inclusion of pdf
files is much faster.  So it's not a bad idea to provide pdf files.

A very good tool to convert bitmap graphics is the convert utility
from ImageMagick.  See http://www.imagemagick.org .

The conversion can be done automatically, for instance under UNIX:

#!/bin/sh
for file in *.png ; do
    convert $file.png $file.eps
    convert $file.png $file.pdf
done

I don't know which fonts are used by the latest texlive, but the next
version will certainly use scalable fonts always by default.

You can avoid all this trouble if you use pdftex and create the ps
file from the final pdf file as explained above.

  Reinhard

I have used Fondu succesfully to convert Apple fonts to separate TTF 
files. Given that I need to convert them using a batch process (by hand 
is not an option as I want to ship a script that does all the work to 
all the other Mac OS X TeX users, there are basically 3 options after 
that.

1. Use ttf2tex. This produces the means to use the TTF files from 
pdfTeX, but only partly as slanted TTF fonts are not supported in 
pdfTeX. dvips and dvipdfm are only supported through bitmaps (using 
gsftopk to bitmap render the ttf font). This will also mean that dvips 
and pdfTeX cannot share map files, which increases maintenance 
complexity. ttf2tex has support for TeX's font selection mechanism and 
produces the correct map, fd and encoding files on the fly. ttf2tex 
produces T1 encoding. T1 encoding means that for most intent and 
purposes, the user will also have to use CM-Super to prevent the use of 
bitmaps for fonts other than the Apple fonts.

2. TTF can be converted to Type1 using ttf2pt1. However, since TTF 
hinting is lost, quality loss may occur. I haven't seen the reults yet. 
Having type1 is of course best from the TeX perspective, as all TeX 
renderers (dvipdfm, dvips, pdfTeX) can handle type1. Possible quality 
loss is worrying me, though. I do not know yet what kind of encoding 
ttf2pt1 produces.

3. TTF can be converted to Type42. This happens without quality loss. 
It remains to be seen if all renderers on the TeX side can handle these 
fonts. This does not work yet here, because the program (ttfps) 
produces invalid font names in the output file.

Any light that can be shed on this by anyone is very welcome.

Subject: [tex-live] Font encoding/conversion help desperately needed
Message-ID: <D233BCEA-210C-11D7-BC35-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

I am trying to create an automatic conversion of TrueType fonts on my 
Mac OS X system to something usable by TeX. I have decided that ttf2tex 
is not an option, as it only produces a way to embed TTF in pdfTeX (and 
pdfTeX also does not supports slanted TTF, so it is incomplete too), 
but ttf2tex is not compatible with dvips and I want to support that 
too. Besides, ttf2tex only supports T1 encoding and it would be nice to 
support both T1 and OT1. So, I need another route.

I have used fondu to convert Apple's fonts to separate ttf files. I 
have followed ttf2tex's naming convention, e.g. for GillSans:

         GillSansLight.ttf       ,       mgsl16.ttf
         GillSansLightItalic.ttf ,       mgsli16.ttf
         GillSans.ttf            ,       mgsr16.ttf
         GillSansItalic.ttf      ,       mgsri16.ttf
         GillSansBold.ttf        ,       mgsb16.ttf
         GillSansBoldItalic.ttf  ,       mgsbi16.ttf

I am now looking at using ttf2pt1 to convert TTF to Type1. The results 
seem pretty good (at one point I was able to look at the results, I 
forget what I hacked to get that working). But now I need to automate a 
lot of work (map files for use with pdftex and dvips, fd files for 
LaTeX, encodings?).

fontinst looked promising. But when I run ttf2afm on my ttf files, they 
seem not to have an encoding (all numbers are -1). Fontinst seems to 
expect something like mgsb8a but ttf2tex says the TTF stuff should be 
renamed to mgsb16. 8a is Adobe standard, 16 seems to be Unicode. How 
should I handle my afm files so that fontinst produces all the fd, tfm, 
etc?

ttf2pt1 can also produce an AFM file as well from the TTF. This one 
says the encoding is FontSpecific but that is all. And something like 
dotlessi is missing for instance. Besides, the AFMs produced by ttf2afm 
and ttf2pt1 differ substantially.

I am lost. I am so lost I do not even know what to ask and how to 
describe my situation properly.

Can some guru help me get one TTF font converted to type1 and installed 
for TeX & LaTeX (both OT1 and T1)?

Thanks,

G

Subject: [tex-live] Encoding clashes with TeXLive 7
Message-ID: <3E1BF302.8020805@tuwien.ac.at>

Hello,
I have reported this problem already in the newsgroup comp.text.tex; so 
if you followed that thread, just skip to the end of the message.

When I included an eps-figure using fonts from the LucidaBright font 
family, the letters disappeared in the (dvips generated) ps-file. (See 
the attached test examples)
 From the answer in the newsgroup I conclude that the problem is caused 
by partial font downloading. Using the -j0 option for dvips solved the 
problem.

I think that I really should use partial font downloading, especially 
with the commercial fonts. Therefore I would suggest to alter the 
algorithm in dvips concerning the encoding: In the current version the 
encoding vector is zeroed out at the beginning.

I actually don't know who is the right person to decide about the 
implementation; but I think that the maintainers of TeXLive have some 
authority.

Best regards and thanks for the _extremely_ useful distribution!
Alois

Apple has released an Apple-supported X11 environment for Mac OS X so I 
have decided to try to compile TeX Live with X11 support. But this 
fails because the include files are not found. Are there environment

You need to have the header files. Without them, you cannot compile
a new X11 application. Are the headers available somewhere? If yes, where?

The default location /usr/X11R6/include of course. I think it was clear 
that I had installed X11. It is just that the TeX configuration does 
not detect it and I wonder why. I even tried explicitely setting 
--with-x for configure.

Do other simpler X programs compile OK? It seems to 
me like a question for Apple, not us....

Simpler programs will probably compile fine. The problem I am 
encountering is that TL *configure* does noot turn on X11-specific 
compile and link flags.

OOPS. It turns out Apple ships X11 without the headers. Sigh.

Sorry people, that is so stupid that I never expected it.

1) Try configure --x-includes=/usr/X11R6/include
   --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib to explicitly get the location.

2) Look at config.log afterwards to see why it failed.  My wild guess
   would be that some special libraries need to be included.

Message-ID: <1042751454.1183.38.camel@spqr-dell>

I have just updated the Perforce tree in //depot/Build/source/... with
what should now
be a stable source. The same thing should appear
shortly as a teTeX release. It includes web2c 7.4.4,
pdftex 1.10a, and omega 1.23.2

Fingers crossed, we are now at a stage where web2c,
teTeX and TeXLive are all at the same point, which
is really excellent news. 

Could I ask everyone who has compiled binaries for TeX Live
before to gird up their loins, download the source,
and try again? Either send me the binaries, or
put them in Perforce yourself. Watch yourself,
as there are more programs, and many programs which
were small scripts before are now symbolic links.

The next event, all being well, will be the integration
of Knuth's new release; there may also be a changed
dvips if a discussion about security on another list
goes somewhere; and we can probably expect more Omega
in due course.

Hi!

I just realized that there is something strange going on with dvips: If
I dvips a file which should include pfb fonts, but the fonts can not be
found, AND -j1 (partial download), there is NO error. Only with -j0 an
error is reported.

Best wishes

Yes it is! My (TeXLive) dream of recent years is coming true.
Many thanks to Olaf, Thomas, you and others who are making
it happen.

I tried the compilation on irix and failed:

- a problem with permisions - could you add 'chmod -R u+w .' back to Build?

 make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/tex/TeX/utils/texinfo'
 cd . && /bin/sh /usr/local/tex/TeX/utils/texinfo/missing --run aclocal-1.6 -I m4

- the old nightmare with autoconf version. Could someone please remind me
how to get around it?

   /bin/sh /usr/local/tex/TeX/utils/texinfo/missing --run automake-1.6 --gnu  Makefile

I recall there was a hassle with the libraries for xdvik
last year. The cure provided by Thomas (I think) was to
replace, in xdvik/configure,

  x_tool_libs="-lXaw -lXmu -lXt"
with
  x_tool_libs="-Wl,-Bstatic -lXaw -Wl,-Bdynamic -lXpm -lXmu -lXt"

This change has not propagated to the current source.
Or am I mixing things?

Might be. If I do a Build on Linux, pdfTeX is static enough:

We are upgrading autoconf on our site ... We've been using v. 2.53, 
required: >= 2.54, the last gnu version: v. 2.57. Definitely despair 
and scream ;-)

    - the old nightmare with autoconf version. Could someone please remind me

       /bin/sh /usr/local/tex/TeX/utils/texinfo/missing --run automake-1.6 --gnu  Makefile

       configure.ac:12: error: Autoconf version 2.54 or higher is required

This is a true statement, Texinfo does need autoconf 2.54 or higher.
Actually 2.57.

The question is, why is autoconf getting rerun at all.  All I can
surmise is the file timestamps are wrong in perforce.  It never happens
for me when I just unpack the original texinfo distribution and say
configure && make.

I also don't understand why this happens with texinfo and not with
anything else.  I am not doing anything special in the texinfo distribution.

This isn't my bailiwick any more, but ... those options cannot just be
hardwired in.
1) Neither -Wl, nor -Bstatic/dynamic are the right syntax for all linkers.
2) -lXpm does not exist on some systems.
3) linking Xaw statically seems wrong to me anyway.

I'm sure none of this is news.

What is the actual error?

Maybe Kaja does not have "modtime" set in her Perforce client? that

the time stamps look OK

None yet ;) I'm waiting for new autoconf to proceed with compilations.
But I recall that dynamic libraries in (o)xdvik for linux gave Staszek 
problems last year and caused much email exchange. I'd like to avoid 
it this time.

My options tell me that I have "nomodtime". Should I change it to
"modtime"?

Staszek was able to compile the best compatible linux binaries, I think.
He used to have a system where my gcc hack works (it no longer works
with gcc3) and he did have the static libXaw, so he can link xdvik /
oxdvik with
  x_tool_libs="-Wl,-Bstatic -lXaw -Wl,-Bdynamic -lXpm -lXmu -lXt"

Karl, you are absolutely right. That's why this has never found its
way into the Makefile. Still, this is of some use if done "by hand"
on systems where it makes sense.

I guess that it was the transition of XFree86 version 3 to version 4
where all libraries have kept their version number except libXaw. Linking
that one lib statically helps to improve the compatibility of the
binary. On Linux, it used to run on much more systems if linked that way.

My suggestion was not intended to be for general use, but for use by
*one* person who provides the linux binaries for TeX Live.

In libs/xpdf/libxpdf.ac we use "needs_libxpf" as a variable, but in
the top-level configure.in we test "needs_xpdf".  This means that the
detection whether xpdf has to be built is broken.

Oops. Thanks!

I suggest to keep needs_libxpdf (not needs_libxpf) and to replace
needs_xpdf. That's a little more work, but looks better.

Sure, since many people still use old linux boxes and TL binaries are
considered to be ready-to-run on many Linux versions.

I still keep that system, and... compile with success every new teTeX-beta;-)
So I can do by best and compile bin/i386-linux binaries (or just (o)xdvik??).

In teTeX-beta, I have got an update for xdvik-22.40u on Saturday. Shall
I submit to TL? If yes, to source or source.development?

Sebastian, when doing the dvipdfm integration, I have done it from a
clean dvipdfm distribution without using the customization of TeX Live.
My result differs in a few point from yours. Do you want to switch to
my version?

yes, please. to source.development. lets keep source as it is
for the moment, to see what other problems are reported
in compilation. after all, this isn't TeX Live 8 yet, its just
a waypoint.

if you have it working cleanly, I'm happy to switch to what you have.
I never was very happy with my dvipdfm hacks

Ok, new dvipdfm + xdvik are submitted.

I hope that my version is not worse. Though I have done it carefully,
your version was propably tested by more people. My version does not
have such a long history.

Anyway, we'll see how it works...

Message-ID: <200301190950.h0J9okMR029883@gauss.dbs.uni-hannover.de>

I just have changed source.development/TeX/texk/tex4htk/tex4ht.c and
fixed a bug in the "improper command line" error message. Maybe, this
should propagate into the "source" tree in perforce.

I use

"some long line\n"
"more text",

for one long string instead of

"some long line\n\
more text"

That \ at the end of the line was not detected as "continue in the next
line", maybe, because of the CR/LF coding of the file. Using the feature
that a standard compiler must automatically concatenate subsequent string
constants, we should have a more robust solution now (independend of the
OS line end convention and the lineends of the source code).

Eitan Gurari, do you agree with that change? The program has a funny
license, but I hope that we don't need to change the name of the program
or its signature?

Thanks.

I was not aware of the same problem in t4ht.c. That file (in the texlive
repository) had no dos'ish line ends, so that the compiler did the right
thing. Still, I have followed with the same change.

Perhaps the problem is that we use for TL some mix from the official
release from CTAN and from the bugfixes. We have now (in bugfixes), e.g.
completelly new stuff for htfonts and tex/generic/tex4ht/ as compared to
CTAN. Some of those changes are in the texlive repository.

As I can remember from the last year discussion, the texk version of
tex4ht completely ignores some settings in tex4ht.env, like
t@texmf@/fonts/tfm/!
i@texmf@/ht-fonts/iso8859/2/!
i@texmf@/ht-fonts/alias/!
or similar, with `/' for Windows. Instead, it uses kpathsea and/or time 
compile settings, so cannot be modified by the user in tex4ht.env
(the last resort it to set, eg., TEX4HTFONTS in the environement).

I hope also that for convert -transparent (instead of -transparency)
can be finally fixed for TL's tex4ht.env. As I see, some config files
are still different from those accepted in texmf tree.

Subject: [tex-live] announce: 2nd version of encTeX -- UTF-8 support
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0301200825040.25737-100000@newton.feld.cvut.cz>

Dear TeXlive and web2c implementors,

I released the second version of my encTeX -- the extension of TeX for
input re-encoding. This version is available on

   ftp://math.feld.cvut.cz/pub/olsak/enctex/

including my pseudo English documentation on

   ftp://math.feld.cvut.cz/pub/olsak/enctex/encdoc-e.pdf

This version supports the full UTF-8 encoding of input files and
\write files in 8bit TeX, pdfTeX and eTeX.

I want to say a word of thanks to David Necas (Yeti) who has made a
encTeX's UTF-8 tables from UNICODE NamesList.

More information follows.

--------------------------------------------------------

The UTF-8 encoding keeps the standard ASCII characters unchanged and
encodes the accented letters of our alphabets in two bytes. The
standard 8bit TeX is not ready for the UTF-8 input because it have to
manage the single character as two tokens. It means you cannot set the
\catcode, \uccode, etc. to these single characters and you cannot do
\futurelet of the next character in normal sense. The second version
of my encTeX solves these problems.

The encTeX package is a little extension of TeX. You can install
it from source files of TeX by changing the "tex.ch" file in your
distribution. The patch to "tex.ch" file for web2c distribution is
included.

The encTeX is full backward compatible with the original TeX.
It adds eight new primitives by which you can set or read the conversion
tables used by input processor of TeX or used during output to the
terminal, log and \write files. If you don't use these primitives, the
program behaves 100% the same as the standard TeX.

The first version of the encTeX was released in 1997. This version
was able to do only byte per byte conversion using xord and xchr
vectors. The second version was designed in December 2002 and released
in January 2003. It gives possibility to convert the multi-byte
sequences to one byte or to arbitrary control sequence. You can implement
up to 256 UTF8 codes as one byte and unlimited number of other
UTF-8 codes as control sequences. All internals in 8bit TeX (macros etc.)
are working in the same way as if "normal one byte encoding" of input
files is used.

I think that the UTF-8 encoding will be used more and more common. In such
situation, there is no another way than to modify the input processor
of TeX otherwise the 8bit TeX will dead in short time.

---------------------------

I am ready to help you with the implementation of encTeX to the common
TeX distributions. The current state is that the encTeX is initialized
every times if the patch on tex.ch was used. The second line is added
to the banner of TeX, pdfTeX or eTeX, which informs you about encTeX
extension.

It is possible to implement encTeX such way that it is initialized
only if the -enc command line option was used. This is not done in
current version because the encTeX is implemented only at the WEB
language level independent on system specific subjects. The scanning of
the command line options is system specific part thus it is not
implemented now. But I am ready to cooperate with TeX implementors
to introduce the -enc option and to solve the TCX tables conflict.

Please, implement the encTeX into your TeX distributions. I would like
to the encTeX becomes a standard extension of TeX used in many TeX
distributions.

Thank you

Petr Olsak

thats probably true. I dont think CTAN mirrors TeX4ht, does it?

yes, kpathsea is used for everything

the current .env has -transparent

It is unsafe to download to TL only part of the bugfixes
distribution. (I intended to revise the main distribution in the home
web page, as well as update ctan, sometimes in February.)

Is `@texmf@' literally used that way anywhere?

Instead of `@texmf@', one can put `~' or `~~' or a full path. (I don't
recall how old this feature is, but I see it in the distribution of
Feb 2002.)

   t~~/fonts/tfm/!
   i~~/ht-fonts/iso8859/2/!
   i~~/ht-fonts/alias/!

A `~' takes a base path from an environment variable named HOME. A
`~~' takes a base path provided through an environment variable named
TEX4HTHTF. Can TEX4HTHTF be assigned the path of `@texmf@'?  If not,
any suggestion on how to incorporate @texmf@ into tex4ht.c?

Similarly, can TEX4HTENV be assigned a base path, for a relative path
to tex4ht.env?  

   tex4ht -e~~/.../tex4ht.env  ....
   t4ht -e~~/.../tex4ht-foo.env  ....

Is there a problem for windows?

That is correct, it doesn't. CTAN used to mirror tex4ht, but that got
lost when my department stopped supporting ftp accounts.  At that
time, I was told CTAN can't mirror through http channels.

A support for UTF-8 is already provided by ucs.sty available from
CTAN. I think it should be included on the next CD.

As for encTeX, I think it can have some future if you make it an
upward-compatible extension of TCX tables. Then you should try to
persuade e-TeX authors to merge encTeX and e-TeX together.

NO!!

The UTF-8 support cannot be 100% perfect, if you realise it only at macro
level. I have made my own macros for UTF-8 support before my second
version of encTeX and I know very deep all problems connected with thist
task.

Please, don't assume that all UTF-8 codes on input side and on
the output to \write files can be implemented by macros.

People are using his own macros with \catcodes, \uccodes etc. set to
idividual letters and they do the \futurelet of the next character.
If you don't use encTeX, you are not able to do these tasks in normal
sense.

The upward-compatibility of TCX tables are possible. The TCX tables are
not the standard TeX internals thus the current version of encTeX
does not solves this problem. But I have changed one's mind about it and I
am ready to help TeX implementors to implement encTeX which is
upward-compatible of TCX tables.

if we are talking about LaTeX, then properly done writes to files
(AUX, etc) - those using standard LaTeX commands to do writes - will
save the characters properly in LaTeX internal character
representation (LICR) form, even when you are using UTF-8 input
encoding, e.g. if Á (in UTF-8 encoded document) will be written to a
file, it will be represented in the encoding-independent form: \'A

the characters in AUX and other files written by TeX should be
encoding-independent, as the document can use several input encodings,
so writing UTF-8 to files is not a good idea.

these "dirty tricks" are not permitted in LaTeX (even for

uc/lccodes are fixed.

if one uses proper interfaces (e.g. protected writes in LaTeX) then

I am not talking about LaTeX. My encTeX is a solution for all macros, not
only LaTeX.

The \write files are commonly processed by another programs than TeX. If
these programs understand UTF-8 then you need to be able to output this
encoding by \write command.

But these "dirty tricks" are commonly used outside LaTeX. My encTex is
suggested not only for LaTeX users.

The LaTeX is not "proper interface" for many peoples including me.

LaTeX is a macro package (i.e. it works purely with standard TeX
features), thus it shows that it is possible to use similar robust
approach in other macro packages too.

there exist packages which add inputenc capabilities to plain tex
(e.g. cyrplain on CTAN)

i.e., it is possible to solve such problems at the level of standard
TeX, without extensions to TeX-the-program.

encTeX doesn't provide a universal solution to handling utf-8, as e.g.
omega does, and such a solution (even cleaner) is possible within
standard TeX framework.

The LaTeX approach is not robust. This is a reason why I developed my
encTeX.

I cite from ucs.sty documentation:

  UTF-8 characters are interpreted by TeX as a sequence of
  commands, so don't use calls like \macro ä instead of
  \macro{ä}.

It means that I don't completelly switch all my old documents to UTF-8
because problems can occur! On the other hand, the encTeX is really robust
solution.

The second example: You have written that \write files includes only \'A
notation of characters in LaTeX. Do you know a documents where you have to
re-read the \write files in verbatim mode? I know these documents. What
happens in LaTeX in such situation?

Please, don't disseminate that UTF-8 solution in LaTeX is robust. This is
not true.

Best regards

with encTeX, expansion of a multibyte UTF-8 character can also be not
a single letter, but a sequence of several tokens (e.g. a call to
macro), - so encTeX suffers from exactly the same "problem": you can't
be sure that one UTF-8 character in the input file will be one token,
so you cannot use \macro ä in encTeX too, unless you are sure that ä
will expand to some single character but not to, say, \"a.

nothing bad - it is very well possible to write to files in LaTeX
using the ASCII LICR representation, and then read the files back:
you'll need to translate \ into, say, \textbackslash, and characters
like Á to \'A (which is a native representation in LaTeX); then, when
you read the file back, all will be correct:
* Á will be written as \'A, and read back as Á
* \'A will be written as \textbackslash 'A, and read back as \'A
so verbatim representation will be preserved.
(fancyvrb package contains a lot of such framework)

LaTeX is robust, - you only need to use it consistently.

The "\textbacklash dance" will help you if the native verbatim environment
is used. But if you first set all \catcodes to 12 (including backslash)
and second you \input the external file, no \textbacklash will help you.

Sorry, I am not a TeX novice, I _know_ what I am saying. The LaTeX
solution of UTF-8 encoding is not robust.

 PO> NO! Please, read the encTeX manual before this discussion.

OK, sorry, - i didn't read it carefully enough...
nevertheless, i still see a problem:

  encTeX cannot define all possible UTF-8 characters (due to very big
  number of characters), so some valid UTF-8 character in input file
  will not be translated in any way, thus \macro ä MAY still be
  processed incorrectly by encTeX if a multibyte UTF-8 sequence for ä
  was not defined in encTeX, and a bad behavior of \macro will occur.
  i.e. \macro ä will get the first byte of UTF-8 representation of ä
  instead of the whole character (just the same effect as mentioned in
  the ucs package).

  while with UCS package (purely TeX solution) you can at least
  generate sensible warnings for undefined UTF-8 characters which may
  occur in imput files without defining all 2^31 characters, it is not
  achievable with encTeX - characters which were left undefined and
  which will appear in input files will horribly fail in encTeX
  without any warning.

also, as far as i understand, encTeX is a very limited solution: it
mostly assumes that one uses a single text font encoding (e.g. T1)
throughout the document (just like TCX), and thus it does not provide
solution for really multilingual UTF-8 documents.

if i'm wrong, please correct me - give an example of how one can use
encTeX to support e.g. T1 and T2A font encodings (for e.g. french and
cyrillic) in the same document. i think that there will be problems
because the same slot numbers in T1 and T2A encodings contain
completely different glyphs, and reverse mappings will not work
correctly.

purely (La)TeX solution works just fine, - e.g. ucs package or my
small utf-8 input encoding support at
CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/t2/etc/utf-8
(see e.g. multilingual example file in that directory)

sorry, i don't understand your reasoning... are you saying that it is
impossible to achieve some effect with writing to files and verbatim
reading of files from TeX, using purely TeX machinery?

if so, could you describe what is it? you are not forced to redefine
the backslash's catcode to 12 when reading or writing files, - nothing
prevents you to preserve the original catcode when reading.

i.e., what encTeX buys us WRT verbatim which could not be achieved
without any extensions to TeX? could you give a small example?

Best,

Hi all of you!

Here are the problems I encountered while compiling TeXlive on
Debian/Woody on an alpha machine:

It is mostly connected with odvips, the Makefile seems to be just plain
wrong AFAIS. program = afm2tfm dvips, squeeze is not build, ...
but in the Makefile.in it is there. So WHY is it not generated?

Another thing: Why are all the files in odvipsk NOT links but
files which contain the link name. They are not marked as links in the
directory. I just made a
	rm -f Build/source/TeX/texk/odvipsk/*
	p4 sync -f Build/source/TeX/texk/odvipsk/*
	./configure --prefix=`pwd` --datadir=`pwd` --enable-multiplatform
	make world
and still the same problem. 

Can someone explain me why this happens? Are some settings from my p4
client wrong?

Best wishes

Yes, but all characters _supported_ in encTeX table behaves in macro level
as a single token. On the other hand, all characters (supported or no) in
ucs.sty behaves as multi token.

Warnings are possible, see the section 3.5 in encTeX documentation, the
\warntwobytes example. You can define the \warnthreebytes similar and you
can declare all unsupported UTF-8 codes by inserting these control
sequences in encTeX conversion table by simple \loop in \loop.

Yes, this is limitation of 8bit TeX itself. You cannot switch to the more
font encodings in one paragraph because of \lccodes are used in hyphen
algorithm only at the end of the paragraph. This is a reason why I did not
implement the multi-tables in encTeX.

You can declare unilimited UTF-8 codes as a control-sequences in encTeX.
The russians can declare UTF-8 code of Ya as a \ruYa (for example) and
they can define \chardef\ruYa="code (or as a macro). You can switch the
font and do russian typpesetting from UTF-8 ecoding. The reverse mapping
to \write files are kept for all characters and control sequences
stored in encTeX.

It is possible but you cannot \write the \'A sequences into such files.
If you are working with more than 256 codes, then it is not possible in
purely 8bit TeX but it is possible in encTeX.

I am forced to redefine the backslash's catcode when (for example) I am
writting a TeX manual and some examples are shown in two versions:
typeset version and the input file version. This examples are written only
once in the source of this manual. I need to all Czech characters are
shown in this manual in the native form.

The problem is that web2c/kpathsea compiled versions completely ignores
such notation, as well as @texmf@. Giving full path works only on Linux
(compilation from the the current source.development touched by Thomas),
but not on Win32 (I still use TL7 binaries).

It would be nice having configurable `i' entries in tex4ht.env, using

(as well as TEX4HTENV, mn39.html), we have instead in TL's texmf.cnf:

T4HTINPUTS=.;$TEXMF/tex4ht/base//

TEX4HTFONTSET, giving, e.g., `alias,win1251' or `alias,iso8859/2', etc.

Would a code similar to the following within tex4ht.c work?

  system("TEX4HTFONTSET={alias,iso8859/2}; export TEX4HTFONTSET");
  htfname= kpse_find_file (name, kpse_program_text_format, 0);    

If so, tex4ht.c can be ammended to retrieve the content of the system
command from the `i' records. For instance,

  iset TEX4HTFONTSET={iso8859/1,alias}                         MS windows
  iTEX4HTFONTSET={iso8859/1,alias}; export TEX4HTFONTSET       unix

They should not be the same. Their underlying content can
be seen at

  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/win95/htlatex.tab (MS windows)
  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/share/            (unix)


I wonder whether I can help compiling tex4ht.c for kpathsea on my 
unix account. I tried the command line

  gcc -o tex4ht tex4ht.c -DKPATHSEA -I/usr/local/teTeX/include
                                    -L/usr/local/teTeX/lib
                                    -L/usr/local/teTeX/include/kpathsea 

at a private directory, and got complains of the form

    config.h: No such file or directory
   c-errno.h: No such file or directory

The files are at /usr/local/teTeX/include/kpathsea.

They are the same .exe files, just using the usual trick that the
behaviour differ given the name by which you call the program. I'll look
why it is failing with ht.exe.

They are documented in the kpathsea manual. Every kpathseafied program
called foo can use FOOINPUTS to look for its own input files. This
feature is used in tex4ht:

tex4ht.c around line 40:
  if( !dot_file )
    dot_file = kpse_open_file ("tex4ht.env", kpse_program_text_format);

but enctex cannot support all characters (due to very big number of
characters in UTF-8: 2^31), so still some uses of \macro ä MAY still
be processed incorrectly by encTeX, and will fail in exactly the same
way as in ucs.sty

 PO> On the other hand, all characters (supported or no) in ucs.sty

that is, in my opinion, not a major limitation (one can always use
braces to delimit macro arguments). also, in encTeX, the "dirty
tricks" with e.g. \catcode will not always work: when some UCS
character is defined as a \macro, \catcode will produce an error.
so compatibility with old documents is not preserved in all cases.

e.g., if i use
\chardef\ruYa="code
\mubyte \ruYa ....\endmubyte
and then the input file contains:
\catcode`\<ruYa>=11
then encTeX will fail badly, as it will translate it to
\catcode`\\ruYa=11
am i wrong?

so, with standard TeX some old package which was using
\catcode`\<ruYa>=11 (where <ruYa> is 8-bit character) works, and with
encTeX (where the text is recoded to UTF-8 and <ruYa> is a multibyte
character) it will fail, so no compatibility is preserved.

you are saying that encTeX is capable of storing a table of
\warn...byte definitions for 2^31 characters in memory? :)

with UCS package, it is possible to produce a warning without defining
all possible characters; and also UCS package can load definitions for
Unicode ranges on demand, when they are used in the document, and thus
does not need to store huge set of macros in memory (but encTeX has to
load all definitions in a format file).

that's not what i'm arguing about: T1 and T2A (and other standard
LaTeX T* encodings) all have compatible settings for uc/lccode and do
not require their changes, thus texts in T1 and T2A can coexist in one
paragraph without breaking hyphenation.

as far as i understand (see above), encTeX does not provide full
compatibility with old macros; more important, this functionality is
already available in Omega: you can use

\ocp\someOCP=sometranslation
\InputTranslation currentfile \someOCP

and put all necessary translation rules into sometranslation.otp,
and this will provide the same functionality as encTeX does
(there are also \OutputTranslation for writing to files).

e.g. i've just made a small proof of concept OTP to process the file
math-example.tex with Omega and got all characters right (using just
ordinary TeX fonts).

so why use yet another non-standard TeX extension instead of existing
(and more powerful) Omega?

you are wrong... LaTeX + UCS packags perfectly provides such

french czech etc characters and writing to files will correctly
convert all these characters to in variant internal representation
(\'A, \CYRYA, etc). would you like me to make a sample file?

i see no problem either. there's no need for TeX extension to

If your old document uses \catcode`Ya=11 then it maps the cyrrilic
characters to one of the 256 internal slots in TeX. You can do the same by
encTeX but you cannot map to these slots more than 256 UTF-codes without
information loss. Our old document did not map more than 256 codes too.
Where is the incompatibility?

Note, that my suggestion about \chardef\ruYa="code was inspired by another
our question: how to manage more than 256 codes. This is not a problem
of a compatibility with a old documents.

Yes. The memory needs are optimized.

You are wrong. You has asked me to another thing (how to manage more
than 256 codes) and following my answer you decided something about
incomaptibility. This is not fair. You can set the encTeX table in order
to 100% backward compatibility is provided.

If you needs to manage more than 256 UTF-8 codes (on input and on
\write output) and you are using only 8-bit fonts (the 16-bit metrics
are not available, for example) then you need to map some UTF-8 codes
to control sequences and solve the typesetting realisation of them as
a macro (which does a composite, switches temporary to the another font
etc.).

The encTeX serves the mapping of UTF-8 codes to control sequences on
the input and reverse mapping of control sequences to UTF-8 codes.
It means that the output of encTeX's input processor is a mix of bytes
and tokens (tokenized as a control sequences) and that the encTeX's
output processor in \write arguments can convert the selected
control sequences to UTF-8 codes without expansion.

I know too little about Omega but I know that OTP is a state automaton
which manages only with the bytes but which don't cooperates with
token processor and which is not able to output the mix of bytes and
tokenized control sequeces. It means that the verbatim mode is not
possible to implemet with more than 256 UTF-8 codes and 8-bit internal
fonts in Omega. The OTP cannot suppress the expansion of control sequences
on the write arguments. My question is: how can be solved the problem of
more than 256 UTF-8 codes with 8-bit fonts in Omega?

Of course, Omega can inpire by encTeX idea in its future versions :-).

You are wrong. This is not so perfect concept because of:

1. \write files can be processed by another programs which uderstands only
   UTF-8 encoding.
2. The \write file can be re-input in verbatim mode in TeX.

I only repeat my arguments because it seems that you are not noted them.

    Dear Sir,

    I am looking for an implementation of LaTeX for AmigaOS v3.x.
    I could not find a ready-to-use install of LaTeX for Amiga v3.x so far,
so I would like to install TeX and then LaTeX (and eventually package all
this to make it easier for other people). On the page
http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free it says that the TeX-Live CD-ROM
contains a version of TeX for the Amiga. However, when I browsed the
contents of the CD-ROM for supported systems
(http://www.tug.org/tex-live.html#systems) I could not find an Amiga
version, is it still available?

    Thank you very much in advance!
    Best regards,
    Yann-Gaël

I removed this statement from interest.html, thanks for mentioning it.

Hopefully one of the other folks will know where you can find tex for

No: the system(3) call is executed in a "subshell" which means that
changes to environment variables in the subshell are not propagated
back to the parent.

What _may_ work is

        xputenv("TEX4HTFONTSET", "{alias,iso8859/2}");

which puts the definition into the environment of the current process.
(xputenv() is a variant of putenv(3) included in kpathsea.)

I think that due to the caching done by kpathsea, you'd have to put
these values into the environment before the first call to
kpse_find_file() or kpse_open_file().

It might make sense to have tex4ht set the "client_path" of the
kpse_format_info structures it uses before initializing them.  (I'm
open for suggestions for a better -- that is, explainable --
interface.)

You may want to retrieve

        http://www.xs4all.nl/~infovore/tex4htk.tgz

which is a cut-down version of the current TeX Live development source
tree: it contains just kpathsea and tex4ht, with enough supporting
files that you should be able to do "./configure" and "make" to
compile it.  This may make experimentation easier.

Olaf,

Thanks a lot for the input!

The distribution at http://www.xs4all.nl/~infovore/tex4htk.tgz works
beautifully on my platform under "./configure" and "make". 

In the presence of kpathsea, there is no reason for the explicit
t-records in tex4ht.env.  All tex4ht needs is just the information
available to latex about the tfm files, and kpathsea already embeds
it.

If the values for xputenv("TEX4HTFONTSET", "..."); are to come from
the environment file, it is not possible to use this command before
the first call to kpse_find_file() or kpse_open_file().  On the other
hand, tex4ht has its own search engine, and it seems to be
successfully used for the i-records that are provided in the
environment file.

The only issue needing resolution is with regard to the i-records that
provide directions to the htf files:

     i@texmf@\tex4ht\ht-fonts\!

To my understanding, the value of @texmf@ is known to kpathsea within
some variable (TEXMF?). The value of that variable can be accessed by
tex4ht through kpse_var_value( "TEXMF" ).  So i-records similar to the
following ones may provide to tex4ht the information needed to locate
the files.

  ikpatsea{TEXMF}\tex4ht\ht-fonts\
  ikpatsea{.....}\tex4ht\ht-fonts\

Of course, I rather have texht request kpathsea to perform the search,
but I don't know how to request it through a command similar to the
following one.

     extended_kpse_find_file(filename, var, path, ...)
                                       ^^^
                                     "TEXMF"
                                            ^^^^^
                                           "\tex4ht\ht-fonts\"

I don't yet follow the details of "client_path" but I suspect it might
provide support for instructions similar to the above.

I doubt that the whitespace is the problem. I think that some ancient

Many scripts do this (in fact, some people believe it is more portable
than #!/bin/sh), and have done so for decades, so hopefully this isn't
the problem.

Perhaps /bin/sh is not executable, or configure isn't executable, or the
line ending is wrong?

    I think that some ancient

Unless you have actual experience to the contrary, I think this is an
urban myth, propagated/perpetrated by Greg Woods in the 1980's.

The only real-life system I remember being mentioned about this was
Sequent DYNIX, and (a) I sincerely doubt any Sequent is still powered
on, and (b) the Sequent system I had access once upon a time actually
understood `#! /bin/sh' just fine.

That is perfectly okay, and standardly accepted, and recommended,
practice in Unix shell scripts.  It is more likely that the script
itself lacked execute permission.

Here is what the GNU autoconf documentation says about that space:

Yes, it's just what I asked for. As my knowledge is no so deep in the
source's nuances, I'll try to recapitulate:
1. web2c/kpathsea version uses texmf.cnf with the following:

TEX4HTFONTSET=alias,iso8859
TEX4HTINPUTS=.;$TEXMF/tex4ht/base//;$TEXMF/tex4ht/ht-fonts/{$TEX4HTFONTSET}//
T4HTINPUTS=.;$TEXMF/tex4ht/base//

which seems to be OK as default.

2. .;$TEXMF/tex4ht/base// contains specific for tex4ht stuff 
tex4ht.env configuration file, which can/should be configurable by the user 
and can be found a) in the working directory, then b) in the subdirectories 
tex4ht/base/ existing in (expanded) $TEXMF, but (as for kpathsea)
only first hit matches.

3. the only problem left is how to set i-records in tex4ht.env
to be configurable by the user and really read by tex4ht.
@texmf@/, kpatsea{TEXMF}/, ~~/ or some other notation should be adopted
and used in a consistent way in tex4ht.in (sources) and ready tex4ht.env.

Ps. Olaf, many thanks for extracting tex4htk for testing.

apologies. I screwed up that source tree bad.

I have just integrated all pending changes from 
source.development to source. So far as I am concerned,
they should not be identical.

source.tar.bz2 regenerated.

I suggest that you all remake binaries, as there have been
some bug fixes in eg pdftosrc and dvips.

Message-ID: <15928.3070.719017.773045@sparkle.daimi.au.dk>


I made a test compilation on solaris8 sparc (for speed - 
my current solaris 7 buildhost is somewhat slow) and found 
no problems... Compilation produced 243 binaries/scripts.

The log file shows a number of warnings. Among them, one which 
I haven't seen before:

/usr/local/include/c++/3.1.1/backward/backward_warning.h:32:2: 
 warning: #warning
 This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated header. 
 Please consider using one of the 32 headers found in section 
 17.4.1.2 of the C++ standard. Examples include substituting 
 the <X> header for the <X.h> header for C++ includes, or <sstream> 
 instead of the deprecated header <strstream.h>. To disable this 
 warning use -Wno-deprecated.

Is this something to worry about?

I ran a make distclean and reconfigured and compiled:

I get a lot of

and that is not strange since the function looks like:

BTW, the previous problems were not solved by a ranlib (I did not 
expect it but ried anyway). It seems that source.development form Jan 
25 compiles and runs but source from today does not. I do not know when 
it was the last time I ran a make distclean and a reconfigure on 
source.development.

libs/ncurses/ncurses/lib_gen.c is generated by running
libs/ncurses/ncurses/base/MKlib_gen.sh. Maybe, this does no longer work
for some reason?

My lines for addch look like this:

#undef addch
NCURSES_EXPORT(int) addch (const chtype z)
{
        T((T_CALLED("addch(%s)"), _tracechtype2(0,z))); returnCode(waddch(stdscr, z));

I plan to make that teTeX-2.0 release this weekend. I already have a
few changes in my queue, i.e. a few fixes that I just have in my tree
and not yet in source.development (sorry, for not being 100% in sync,
but I am really working hard on teTeX at the moment).

I also expect a new web2c, texinfo and xdvik just in time for teTeX-2.0,
so it might be worth waiting a few days before goining into yet another
round of making new binaries.

teTeX is a moving target until the final version is ready, but I have
just sync'ed everything that was in my queue, so TeX Live and teTeX are
in sync again (changes #2745-#2751).

The updmap problems (reported to me in private mail) which I just fixed
have been a real suprise. On Ultrix, no parameters could be passed down
to the script (they got lost inside the script) and the produced dvipdfm
maps have been broken on ULTRIX V4.5, SUN Solaris 7, Digital UNIX V4.0E
and AIX 3.2.5 since I had used unportable regular expressions.

I know this is messy at the moment, but since Thomas
is moving fast to a release, it makes sense for TL
source to track that and then stop.

I just posted the following to the tex-pretest list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've put web2c 7.4.5 sources up on tug.org in ~ftp/tex.  Thus they'll
appear on CTAN in due course(?)

The sources contain pdftex 1.10a, Omega 1.23.2, and e-TeX 2.1.

The difference with 7.4.4 are minimal.

What is NOT in this release: as you may have heard, Knuth has sent out
an update to TeX and MF (and some smaller fry) for beta test.  This
isn't incorporated in this release -- it looks like the update is not
trivial for both omega and e-TeX; we prefer to hold off Knuths new
files until after teTeX 2.0 releases, so we can integrate them at our
leisure.

We should be good (enough) for release at this point.

If, for some reason, you want the sources NOW and cannot log into
tug.org, use the following links.

There are quite a few nits that can be picked at this point, but I
don't know of any showstoppers (yet?).

Release notes for Web2C 7.4.5 / kpathsea 3.4.5.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Important notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed defaults.

Note that some default settings of "tex, the Web2C implementation of
TeX" have changed.  We determined that some extensions were in fact in
conflict with the strict definition of TeX as laid down by Knuth.

The most notable change is that parsing of '%&' constructs in the
first line of an input file is now disabled by default -- it can be
enabled in texmf.cnf if you desire this.  In that case, tex will
announce itself as TeXk and print an additional banner line saying
that %&-line parsing is enabled.

We may encounter more places where the default behaviour is not what
it should be, and proceed to make this optional (and by default off)
in future versions of Web2C.

* New programs.

We've added ctangle and cweave to the programs bundled in the Web2C
distribution.  The sources are the Levy and Knuth sources, with
additional change files to make them fit in with the other Web2C
programs.

* Building libkpathsea as a shared library.

On some platforms libkpathsea can be built as a shared library, though
I cannot at present recommend that you do so.  But if you did so in
the past, note that a program linked against a 3.3.x version of
libkpathsea cannot use the 3.4.x version.  If you need to keep both
3.3.x and 3.4.x versions around, you're on your own as to how to get
this to work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting and compiling the sources
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* TeX, METAFONT, MetaPost, supporting programs.

To compile the basic programs, you need the WEB sources and the Web2C
tarball:
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web2c.tar.gz
Both of these must be unpacked in the same directory, as they
complement each other.

  * Note that due to a problem in the top-level configure script, running
  * make in the top-level directory will fail due to unmet dependencies
  * on pdftex.  Go one level deeper.

To get a working system you also need a texmf tree.  A barebones
version sufficient for compilating can be found here
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/texmf.tar.gz
You're strongly encouraged to obtain a pre-prepared tree that is more
full-featured, for example the texmf tree used by the teTeX
distribution.  The texmf tree must be unpacked in a location where
you'd store shared program data files, like /usr/local/share.

Note that installation will want to write files in the "web2c"
directory of the texmf tree.

Out of the box, the sources will work well with a texmf tree but not
with the older style of storing the data files which didn't bundle
directories like that.  In such a case edit texk/kpathsea/texmf.in to
be correct for your site before building.


* Adding e-TeX

To add e-TeX, you need to add the following to the sources
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web2c-etex.tar.gz
It adds the e-TeX sources to the web2c source tree.  Unpack it in the
same directory in which you unpacked web.tar.gz and web2c.tar.gz.
This must be done before you run configure.

Also add the following to the texmf tree:
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/etexlib.tar.gz

This tarball adds e-TeX documentation the texmf tree:
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/etexdoc.tar.gz


* Adding Omega

To add Omega, you need to add the following to the sources
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web2c-omega.tar.gz
It adds the Omega sources to the web2c source tree.  Unpack it in the
same directory in which you unpacked web.tar.gz and web2c.tar.gz.
This must be done before you run configure.

Also add the following to the texmf tree:
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/omegalib.tar.gz
  * Beware: this set of files is outdated.

This tarball adds Omega documentation the texmf tree:
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/omegadoc.tar.gz
  * Beware: this set of files is outdated.


* Adding pdfTeX

To add pdfTeX, you need to add the following to the sources
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web2c-pdftex.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/web2c-pdftexlibs.tar.gz
The first tarball adds the pdfTeX sources, the second adds the sources
for libraries that pdfTeX requires, including a version of xpdf set up
to compile into a library.  Unpack them in the same directory in which
you unpacked web.tar.gz and web2c.tar.gz.  This must be done before
you run configure.

Also add the following to the texmf tree:
        ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/pdftexlib.tar.gz
  * Beware: this set of files is outdated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why the sources are organized this way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Why so many tarballs?

This is partly for historical reasons, partly due to the way the
various pieces came together.  Web2C, e-TeX, Omega, and pdfTeX all
have different groups of maintainers, and change at different speeds.
This setup made it easier to replace one version of a program with
another when doing development.

In a similar vein, the texmf tree parts for the different programs
have different maintainers and should be updated by different groups.

That, at least, is the theory.  This has by now largely broken down,
as should be evident from the fact that some of the library tarballs
are badly outdated.

* Why not a single tarball?

Combining the sources above into a single tarball was done for a
while.  To this were also added kpathsea-enabled versions of dvilj,
dvips and xdvi.  These add three more packages that have yet more
maintainers.  A reason to want to put them all together into a single
tarball is that libkpathsea is needed by all of them, and doesn't work
all that gracefully as a separately-installed library.

The pattern was that the texk distribution acquired even more programs
over time.  In this it began to approach a considerable subset of the
teTeX distribution.  This was a considerable waste of effort, so I
briefly tried to make it a genuine subset of teTeX.  But in that case,
what's the point anyway?  So I decided to stop with texk as a separate
distribution, and instead concentrate on just the core Web2C parts,
plus helping with the integration of e-TeX, Omega, and pdfTeX into
Web2C.

* The current situation.

Currently web2c with its extensions and kpathsea are embedded in
teTeX.  The teTeX distribution is itself embedded in TeX Live.  I do
Web2C development on my own machine, with my own CVS repository, and
make updates available to Thomas Esser (teTeX), Sebastian Rahtz (TeX
Live), Fabrice Popineau (fpTeX), and whoever else happens to be
interested and willing to endure the hassle (the Omega developers
spring to mind).  Usually, Thomas updates teTeX with my release, and
then pushes the new teTeX into TeX Live.  If changes had to be made by
him one of the others, they are often copied into Web2C from TeX Live,
completing the circle.

* There's a huge jump in version numbers, what happened?

For me, the main reason to use version numbers is that when I get a
bug report, I can tell which version of the sources it belongs to.

For a while I used version numbers of the form X.Y.ZbetaN to indicate
releases that for one reason or another I did not consider ready for
prime time.  But this is too much of a bother if you're only doing it
to keep version numbers from changing too fast.

So I've switched back to the X.Y.Z numbering scheme.  The "missing"
numbers belong largely to versions that went out with teTeX beta
releases.  And a number of X.Y.Z versions were released as part of TeX
Live released, but sometimes with a little appended x to indicate that
the TeX Live sources were based on but not identical to that version.

* Future directions: short term.

Don Knuth has made some (small) updates to several WEB source files.
We're already working on integrating them, but knew that work couldn't
be finished in time for this release.

The Omega sources are currently nested inside the Web2C source tree.
In future versions they will be a separate source tree, though one
that still uses the build infrastructure provided by the Web2C
sources.  This tree would typically be a sibling of the web2c tree.

* Future directions: long term.

As I've noted above, kpathsea is not exactly graceful as a library.
I'm working on changing it to a well-behaved (shared) library.  This
does have consequences for the programming interface (API) as well as
the binary interface (ABI).

The configuration scripts and other parts of the build infrastructure
are old -- they work well enough that we've never been forced to
upgrade, but we're getting to the point where it makes sense to do so
nevertheless.  The "new" kpathsea (when it is ready) will prompt that
upgrade.

The same with i386-linux (with staticaly linked libs for *xdvi.bin).

etc.

I have the same warnings for teTeX 2.0 RC1.
Thomas suggested waiting for a new set of sources, so I do not send my
compilation.

    I have the same warnings for teTeX 2.0 RC1.

I won't be fixing these const warnings in the texinfo source for this
release.  (Eventually I'll switch all the sources to using ANSI C, but
not now.)

FWIW, they don't happen for me, for some reason, maybe a different
installed gettext?  I'm using the latest, 0.11.5.

Anyway, they are harmless.

(etc)

Those symbols are all either:

- from libxpdf.a
- from libGoo.a
- C++ builtins.

Are these libraries ok?

Is the c++ used for linking identical to the c++ used to compile?
