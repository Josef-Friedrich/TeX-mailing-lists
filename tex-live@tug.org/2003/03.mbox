I have updated the TeX Live source tree and the source.tar.bz2
bundle. If people can recompile, it would be good. Its
necessary, as the pool files have changed due a new pdftex.

does anyone own a Sharp Zaurus? its a PDA running Linux,
and it looks to me like it should be able to run TeX. I'd
be curious to hear if anyone has experience with the thing.
Sadly, I am not allowed to buy one for myself, as we are having work

I do have one, it is a cute little handheld which can do a lot. I can
easily ssh to zaurus from my notebook, has gcc, java compiler and JVM,
opera browser, a mail client, console, apart from the usual goodies
like address book, etc. Has all sorts of connectivity -- modem,
ethernet, wireless, infrared, usb. Over 700 applications are available
for zaurus in the net.

I would love to have TeX installed in a flash card, if that is
possible.

presumably one can run a cross-compilation on an ordinary

the idea of ssh-ing to a PDA is weird :-}

if you think its a good idea, go ahead.

the key thing is that all files in a package must
be listed in the sections of a tpm file. dont worry
about sizes, that can be fixed later

Hi Sebastian, hi friends!

Here are my problems when I try to compile source.development:
$ make clean

$ rm `find . -name config.cache`
$ ./configure --prefix=`pwd` --datadir=`pwd` --enable-multiplatform

in line 61 of Build/source.development/TeX/Makefile there is:

61: @FMU@
62: @FMU@texmf-setup:
        $(srcdir)/selfautofix "$(bindir)" "$(texmf)/web2c"

Same with TeX/texk/web2c/Makefile:

What please should this @FMU@ be?

I am using debian/sid.

That should come e.g. from TeX/texk/web2c/configure.in. Doing a "p4
changes TeX/texk/web2c/configure.in" in source.development, I find:

  Change 2937 on 2003/03/01 by rahtz@spqr-dell
          promote new pdftex to source, and some other small fixes
          from teTeX 2.0.2

That is strange, since teTeX 2.0.2 is based on the older web2c-7.4.X
whareas source.development already had web2c-7.5.X. That's why we have
lost changes here...

Yes, I guess it is possible. Let me give a try.

Sure.

True, but this helps to repair the software setup easily rather than
muddling with the tiny keyboard.

Subject: [tex-live] Separating texmf trees. Problem with hard coded(?) path.
Message-ID: <1A8A0651-4D91-11D7-BBFC-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

I am using a very recent perforce source build.

There is some weird hard-coding problem in KPSE, it seems.

I have rearranged my texmf tree setup so that everything created by a  
make install of the programs is in a separate tree from the normal  
macros and stuff. My texmf.cnf now says:

> % Our directory setup as explained in  
> $SELFAUTOPARENT/share/README.gwtex

I am now experiencing weird behaviour from kpsewhich. If I want to  
locate fmtutil.cnf, I type:

	kpsewhich --format='web2c files' fmtutil.cnf

But nothing is found (it *is* available in texmf.bin/web2c and it is  
mentioned in texmf.bin/ls-R. It is also available in texmf.local/web2c)

When I move (TEXMFMAIN) share/texmf.bin to share/texmf, adapt the  
settings above for TEXMFMAIN to reflect that (so that fmtutil.cnf is  
found in share/texmf) and run texhash, it works, I get the one in  
texmf.local.

Another strange thing is that I cannot find the value of the WEB2C  
variable with kpsewhich when I use texmf.bin instead of texmf

> [dumbledore:/usr/local/teTeX] root# kpsewhich --expand-var '$TEXMF'
> {/Network/Users/gerben/Library/texmf,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/ 
> texmf.local,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.gwtex,!!/usr/local/teTeX/ 
> share/texmf.tetex,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.bin}
> [dumbledore:/usr/local/teTeX] root# kpsewhich --expand-var '$WEB2C'

The last comes up empty (which is probably the cause of the problem I  
am experiencing).

Now, suppose I do *not* edit /usr/local/teTeX/texmf.cnf and change  
texmf.bin in texmf there but I *do* move texmf.bin to texmf. Then  
suddenly I can expand WEB2C:

> [dumbledore:/usr/local/teTeX] root# kpsewhich --expand-var '$WEB2C'
> {/Network/Users/gerben/Library/texmf,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/ 
> texmf.local,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.gwtex,!!/usr/local/teTeX/ 
> share/texmf.tetex,!!/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.bin}/web2c

It looks like the name texmf is hard-coded somewhere in kpse. This  
seems to be the case, because when I move texmf.bin to texmf,  
texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf is read and variables are expanded, while with  
texmf.bin they are not (see below fo rkpsewhich --debug 2 output).

(Note: my make install *does* install web2c stuff in share/texmf.bin,  
not that it should matter)

Thanks,

G

I'll include the output of a kpsewhich --debug 2 run for finding  
fmtutil.cnf:

OF COURSE!!! The texmf.cnf file cannot find itself without a hard coded
path! The path of texmf.cnf IS hardcoded as
	SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
or something similar. Setting TEXMFCNF in this file is just funny, but
useless. Now if you do not have the above it uses the hard coded built
in stuff, otherwise the settings from
SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.

Not too fast.  Also hardcoded is the fact that KPSE finds a texmf.cnf  
as SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf and it finds this *first*. And *that* file  
is where I have set my new locations.

So it is in principle possible that KPSE would first find  
SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf and find the other texmf.cnf locations there.  
Or it could first read SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf and then use TEXMFMAIN  
to find the basic texmf.cnf.

In other words, while there is a need for SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf  
there is not by definition a need for  
SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

In my texmf.cnf in the source directory tree, it says:

texmf.cnf:TEXMFCNF =  
{$SELFAUTOLOC,$SELFAUTODIR,$SELFAUTOPARENT}{,{/share,}/texmf{-local,}/ 
web2c};$TETEXDIR;/usr/local/Build/TeXLive.stable/share/texmf/web2c;/ 
usr/local/Build/TeXLive.stable/share/texmf/web2c

which is the actual compiled-in path. And thus it *can* find  
SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf but not  
SELFAUTOPARENT/share/texmf.bin/web2c/texmf.cnf.

I tried setting TEXMFCNF in SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf.cnf but that is  
ignored.

So, what shoukd I do to change the compiled-in path (preferable at  
configure time)?

Subject: [tex-live] updmap question
Message-ID: <20030305073300.GA31022@gamma.logic.tuwien.ac.at>

Hi friends!

How is updmap supposed to be configured?

I have
/usr/TeX/texmf		my local texmf path, WITH my texmf.cnf
/usr/TeX/texmf-var	variable data, mostly pool from
			source.development and fmt/log files from
			texconfig init
/src/p4-base/Master/texmf	you know this

in the texmf.cnf = /usr/TeX/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf I set
TEXMFMAIN =                     /src/p4-base/Master/texmf
TEXMFLOCAL =                    $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf
VARTEXMF =                      $SELFAUTOPARENT/texmf-var
...

Now I want to have my adapted updmap.cfg: I put it into
	/usr/TeX/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
but it is not used. Putting it into
	/usr/TeX/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
erases it when calling updmap. bash -x shows me:
...
+ rm -f /usr/TeX/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
+ cp /src/p4-base/Master/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg /usr/TeX/texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
...
Is this supposed to be done like this?

I thought updmap.cfg could be tailored to my needs. Or is it a problem
with my TEXMF{MAIN,LOCAL} setting?

BTW: I am using the above setup in several places, but unfortunately it
seems to generate some problems, although it looks to me not like
complete nonsense - any comments?


Best wishes

Very lovely it is too. We use it for teaching here,
it's a godsend. Highly recommended for carrying
around with you in your briefcase, to guarantee a
decent system wherever you find yourself....

cleaning up texmf tree 
1. I removed
texmf/dvipdfm/base/*
obsolete, not referenced, we use teTeX's approach, change 2953
 
2. added ready made by updmap texmf/dvips/config/*.map files, (#2954)
   I think that such files should be always regenerated on Master
by the way, I hope that for csfonts such notation in dvipdfm.map
can also work:
csb10
csbx10
...etc.

3. texmf/tpm/packages/texlive.tpm changed, following 2953 and 2954 (#2955)

this is not such a good idea; those map files
should really be in VARTEXMF, ie local. Even if you
run off the CD, you should still run a local setup
and create VARTEXMF for .fmt, .map etc

I cannot agree. Those map files cannot hurt in TEXMFMAIN, even
if somebody uses VARTEXMF for run off the CD. But... TL can be also
runable without VARTEXMF ;-)

Example for linux user:
export PATH=/mnt/cdrom/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
export TEXMFCNF=/mnt/cdrom/texmf/web2c
export TEXMF=/mnt/cdrom/texmf
[pdf]tex -ini [pdf]latex.ini

and you can compile your file in the current directory. That's all
needed for a quick test, presentation and so on.
Having ready psfonts.map file, etc. is important!

For win32 I use very simple batch file, which also works:

@echo off
:: Run: tlcd e latex
:: where %1 - CD ROM drive letter; %2 - format to be made
set PATH=%1:\BIN\WIN32;%PATH%
set TEXMFCNF=%1:/texmf/web2c
:: we use only one TeX tree
set TEXMF=!!%1:/texmf
@echo Variable check
kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMF
kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMFCNF
kpsewhich texmf.cnf
@echo Now we'll make the local format file: %2
@echo Press any key, or Ctrl-C to abort
pause >nul
tex -ini %2.ini
:: or
REM pdftex -ini %2.ini
@echo READY! Happy TeX-ing!

For win32 users we have now 3 ways for running off the CD:
1. Fabrice's texlive.exe menu item which installs winshell TeX editor, 
   temporary VARTEXMF, etc., but working only within winshell session (BLU);
2. my mkloctex.bat which makes VARTEXMF and asks the user for making
   some changes in the environment (BLU+).
3. the above (BLU++ turbo ;-)

Why not giving the users such freedom...

That is specific to fpTeX. TeXlive has no EncTeX and still the
old TeX.

I have *not* heard that web2c 7.4.5 implemented enctex by default.
On the other hand, patches for this version are present in my
ftp directory.

I've heard that Olaf will try to implement encTeX in version
web2c 7.5.3. I have sent my patches to him including patches for
{tex | pdftex | etex | pdfetex} --help
and for manual pages of these programs.

Hi,

I'm hoping you're the right people to be contacting ... if not, I apologise.

I used LaTeX and emacs (?) when I was doing maths at uni about 9 years ago.  

I haven't used anything similar since, but am now needing to produce accurate maths/science material in large print for visually impaired kids.  It's really important that the work we produce is accurate - using a typewriter or ordinary word-processing package and trying to line things up just isn't good enough.

We have Microsoft Word on Windows 95 and Windows 98, along with the usual packages you get with Microsoft computers these days.

It struck me that the system we used at uni would be perfect for our needs (it wasn't a WYSIWYG system but it produced excellent results), but I don't have a clue how to go about installing that system, or even if it's possible at all.  At uni we used Sun computers.  Is Windows compatible with LaTeX and emacs?  How can we obtain and install it?

I would really welcome any advice you could give me.

Thanks very much.
Hazel.

Message-ID: <permail-2003031116305221170-kaspar@uni-muenster.de>


It seems to me that there are the following bug in texsetup.exe 
of TeX Live 7 (06/2002):

The files listed under <TPM:RunFiles ...> in a tpm file are not installed
(except the tpm file), when the tpm file contains only RunFiles and no
DocFiles or SourceFiles.

Example setspace.tpm (<TPM:Date>2001/09/07 16:36:26</TPM:Date>):
    <TPM:RunFiles size="22826">
    texmf/tex/latex/setspace/setspace.sty     is _not_ installed
    texmf/tpm/packages/setspace.tpm           is installed
    </TPM:RunFiles>

After adding the lines 
    <TPM:SourceFiles size="0">
    texmf/tex/latex/setspace/setspace.sty
    </TPM:SourceFiles>
everything is ok.

Some other packages, which caused the same behavior, are eqname, upquote,
uhrzeit, patch, sprite, numline, barcodes and tracking.

I had noticed that setspace.sty did not get installed (didn't notice
the others), but I couldn't figure out what the problem was.
Thanks for the information! Now hopefully TL8 can have these things
fixed.

Yes, TeX Live CD contains LaTeX and much more and NTEmacs Windows port.
I thing you can obtain the CD from TUG or any local users group.
Quite exactly the same stuff for windows can be also dowloaded
from CTAN, e.g.
ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/current/

Dear Hazel,

As Staszek wrote moments ago, the TeX Live CD/set contains LaTeX and is 
compatible with several different systems.  Please 
see:  http://www.tug.org/texlive/ for more information.  You can get the CD 
by joining TUG and getting last year's CD (2003 - TeX Live 8 is not out 
yet.)  The cost is $65 plus $5 for last year's CD -- though we would be 
happy to make an exception and provide the CD only @ $5?  For information 
about other user group see:  http://www.tug.org/lugs.html. Also, as Staszek 
said the program can be downloaded at no cost.  To refresh your memory 
about LaTeX: http://www.tug.org/begin.html might help.

Hope this helps a bit...

Sincerely,
Robin Laakso
TUG Office Manager

You will have no problem running LaTeX and emacs
on your Windows box. You can get everything you need by
installing the TeX Live CD, or MikTeX. Look at http://www.tug.org for
instructions on download. If
you know how to burn CDs from an ISO image, 
you can download a CD image and get it all working
in an hour or two.

Your application does sound very suited to TeX.

In an attempt to convince Apple Computer that TeX under Mac OS X is 
making a difference in their "Switch" campaign (and also because we are 
just plain curious), we (some people involved with TUG 2003) are trying 
to get some testimonials from, and a count of, people who have made the 
switch from either Windows and/or some flavor of UNIX/Linux to Mac OS 
X, primarily because of the elegance of TeX under Mac OS X (beautiful 
GUI seamlessly integrated with powerful command line). If you are 
someone who is in this group, please write to me 
<mailto:gray@engr.psu.edu> and tell us as much as you can about your 
switch. If you know of someone who has made the switch because of TeX, 
please ask that person if it is OK for me contact him or her regarding 
their switch.

When contacting us, please let us know if it is OK to use your name and 
position when we talk to Apple. If it is not, be assured that we will 
not do so.

If you wish to post to the entire list (or if you do so 
unintentionally), feel free to do so as it may generate some 
interesting discussion and I will simply include your response from 
there.

Finally, I apologize to those of you who are on both lists and receive

Thank you for your time.

Ladies & Gentlemen,

I would like to get your attention for the following. In preparation of 
the 25th TeX anniversary conference in Hawaii this summer, I have had 
the idea to create a TeX showcase, a web page dedicated to shining 
examples of what you can do with TeX. I am looking for documents that 
are small (a few pages mostly, and preferably also small in kB size), 
that source and PDF-output (web showcase after all). Things I could use:
	- Music (musixtex?)
	- Linguistics
	- Math (of course)
	- Literature/poetry (Three pages Shakespeare anyone?)
	- Layout (ConTeXt? Metapost?)
	- Dynamic pages (i.e. texpower-based presentation in PDF)
	- Combination with other packages (i.e. Apple Keynote presentation 
exported to PDF with TeX-output embedded)
	- PS and PDF tricks
	- Fun (whatever you can think off, e.g.what about a Poster sized PDF 
with "Alles Lookenspeepers"?)

If you think you can create something that shows the excellence of TeX, 
please send it to me. Send at least TeX source and PDF output.

Please send your replies to tex-showcase@rna.nl.

Thanks in advance,

Gerben Wierda

Ladies & Gentlemen,

Many of you have heard the stories. Somebody (maybe it was you) tried 
to do hhis thesis in Word. 200 pages with formulas or some other 
combination of heavy word processing/typesetting. And beyond 20 pages 
Word became unstable, the program crashed, the work was lost and after 
having moved to TeX, the situation was heaven in comparison.

I am looking for true stories, examples why people have ditched Word 
(an other programs like it) and moved to TeX. What they like and 
dislike about the move.

These stories I would like to collect in preparation of the 25th 
anniversary of TeX.

Please send your replies to tex-showcase@rna.nl.

Thanks in advance,

I suppose these data don't support your hypothesis, but I've actually
written a 600 page book in Word -- though I must admit each chapter
was a separate file ;)

I did it too in '92 for my wife's thesis (550 pages approx.) . But I
must admit it was challenging. I wouldn't try to do that again. On the
other hand I helped a few people to switch to LaTeX from their MSWord
documents. Let me see if and how some of them would relate that.

I would take on of the examples from the musixtex package. They are
quite elaborate, and there are a LOT of them.

What about asking in the omega mailing list where there should be a lot

Yannis Haralambous <yannis@fluxus-virus.com> also has a lot examples
which should be really nice.

Further suggestions:
	- Chemistry
	- Some Diagramm Stuff
	- Left-to-right, right-to-left, up--to-down etc stuff,

Are you sure that I can read what you wrote without causing Word to
crash?  I'm in doubt.

A few hours ago I tried to load a Word file someone else had written
at work.  Word crashed (invalid memory page access in MSWORD.EXE).  

The system became unstable, i.e. when I tried to attach a file to a
mail message, it was not possible to move into the directory where the
file was.  Fortunately that worked after rebooting the system.

Obviously, you had been in luck.  Congratulations!

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello people,

On the message below I have gotten a lot of enthousiastic replies. 
Thank you! However, most are pointers, and most pointers are not even 
URL's let alone to PDF files or PDF files which are usable as simple 
showcase documents on a simple Web page.

I have had enthousiastic and helpful answers, but those answers are 
only useful for me if i had far more time to research the leads. What I 
need to be able to do this is results, not leads, not even if they seem 
pretty straightforward. I should have made that more clear.

My request is for you to do part of the work involved. Find or compile 
that document you were thinking of and send me the result, a PDF 
attachment and a (TeX) source. If there is a simple URL, go to that 
URL, fetch the documents you were thinking of, put them in an e-mail 
and send them to me. Do not send me URL's e-mail addresses, etc. Send 
me files.

Thanks in advance,

G

PS. Do not send PS documents. They do not all compile easily into PDF. 
Create a PDF out of it and check it and then send it to me. If this 
balloons out of proportion that every e-mail I get on this subject is 
more work for me, I will not be able to do this project.

It's builtin windows and called the Index Service. All searchable
documents are indexed in background (provided you don't forbid it).

Then you have to click Search in the Shell Explorer, don't even need to
type 'grep' ;-)

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0303151029210.26503-100000@re86.internetdsl.tpnet.pl>

I would like to know which decission was really accepted for the TL8 release:
1. DVD (full, unpacked TL+CTAN);
2. one TL CD ROM with all things compressed;
3. both 1. and 2. distributed in one cover.

I investigated personally many people and also GUST mailing list,
and the resulting opinions was:
1. DVD equiped machines are very rare yet;
2. CD as only instalable medium is hardly acceptable as `live' release:
  a) running directly off the CD is quite impossible (we forgot the fact,
     that TL CD can be also mounted and sourced temporarily for the
     already existing installation),
  b) finding/browsing particular macro file or documentation is heavy.
     Many users liked that feature.
I cannot ignore such opinions, and as I always try to see BLU's view,
instead of the Vizzard's one, I'd like to know the opinions from other
LUG members. Have they also been investigated in that regard?

Of course, I can prepare the special release for Polish users, according
to their wishes, but I'd heartly like to avoid doing something different
to the rest of the world.

Just a question: beeing under stress to make the CD `unpacked'
and really `live',  I can only leave win32 and linux binaries as the most
frequent systems here (there are only few mac osx users ;-(). 
Can the rest fit for 1 CD? How can I count/test the whole stuff to fit 
on 1 CD? 

The worst variant is to zap texmf/source/ which, in fact, is much bigger
then working texmf/tex/ :-} Would it be acceptable from `political 
correctness' point of view? I know that such big change needs remaking
tpm and list files.

My plan is to make it _possible_ to produce a compressed CD
and an uncompressed distribution, presumably on DVD. However,
since I don't manage the distribution myself, I am not telling
anyone how they should manage it. On the Unix/Linux/MacOSX side,
I propose to maintain the install scripts for both compressed
and uncompressed form; whether Fabrice can manage that too is
another matter. He and I are both concentrating on making the
"install from compressed" install working.

depends on the place. agreed, they are not normal

These are sound reasons for having an uncompressed CD available.
But they do not convince me that uncompressed is what the majority
will use.

yours is the only report, I believe.

in Poland, maybe. elsewhere it is widely used! so you'd be making
a special CD anyway....

you use the TPM files to extract each package into a temporary tree
and measure its size.

no, thats completely unacceptable. The use of the source tree is not
precise enough. for packages where the only documenatation is the .dtx
file, you lose vital information. why dont I made PDF files from .dtx,
you ask? - because there isn't enough space on the CD!

Fabrice suggests removing cm-super. but a) the replacement isn't
available yet (if it is, send it to me!), and b) that would not make
enough difference. There are so many packages these days. texmf itself
is now over 700 megabytes!


this is not an easily solvable problem. TeX is too big for a CD!

How many chapters, 600? Any pages with text? ;)

More seriously, what really counts here is large scale manageability (pages x
complexity per file/session).

Not to belabour the point, but I did actually work with (at least) six
other people, who were all able to opne my files without problem.

Again: I used Word because the publisher required me to do so, but it
did not present significant problems, other than having to "unlearn"
various shortcuts from vi and emacs ;)

That hasn't happened to me for years, I think -- though it did quite
often back when I used Windows 98 and Office 98 (or whatever they
called it).

Or perhaps using the most recent version (XP) really does have

OK -- you've got me on the cross-references. Yes, I did use styles and
tables (although the tables were reformatted by the publisher, in some
page layout program; they didn't actually use Word for the final
layout :)

This is actually a very good argument in favour of LaTeX (which is, as
I keep mentioning, what I *prefer* to use ;). I had to split and merge
some chapter as I went along, and all references to chapter numbers
and the like then had to be updated manually -- this required quite a
bit of proofreading.

As far as I know, it *is* possible to use automatic references in Word
as well (i believe I have done so myself at one time), so perhaps this
is only an argument against the document template used by the
publisher... :]

Oddly enough, version control was the main argument for using MS Word,
as it has version control built-in -- no reason to use CVS and the
like.

Yes, it may be more limited, but seeing the changes made by different
people highlighted in different colours etc. was quite practical --
and Word *does* make it easier to cooperate with people who don't know
that much about computers (not a reference to the people I worked with
on my book, certainly).

But, yes, I do use CVS with LaTeX.

Indeed.

Word is also scriptable. I've even scripted it with Python... :)

True.

Not that I've done so, but I would think this should be possible in
Word as well, if you use the right MS tools.

Yes -- good point. Opening old Word files can easily be quite
unpleasant.

What's the schedule anyway? Are we aiming at BachoTeX or EuroTeX?

Whoever wants to make CDs can comment better. I want
to get it ready in the next month if I can. I'd like
to take a beta release to Bremen at the start of April.

EuroTeX is more likely!

Sebastian, Fabrice, Staszek shouldn't we talk about this in Bremen?

Lehmanns offers:
   1. DVD (full, unpacked TL+CTAN)
   2. 1 TeXLive CD
      Live!! whatever live means in the moment, runable from (un/compressed?) CD
   3. 1 CD with everything compressed
So 1 DVD + 2 CDs in one cover for 1.90 Euro/~2 $ pp.

Hi friends!

One (off topic) question: What reasonable alternatives fro serious math
type setting to the cm fonts exist? Are there any freely available? I
would like to use Lucida Bright and Math, but 200+ USD for getting them
from Y&Y is to much for a student. Are there any other combinations,
including old-style numerals and small caps.

Thanks a lot for any information!

Best wishes

I did an "opinion poll" in our email-list of Czech and Slovak users.
The results are approximately the same as your results:
DVD device is rare, "Live" part of TeXlive is usable for many users
(but not for all).

"useable", or "used"? not the same thing.

This looks perfect to me. A DVD for those who can take advantage,
a compressed CD which everyone *can* use, and a demo CD which
you can carry around for emergencies or fun. 

For the demo CD, I'd suggest it omit all the source, support, Books, etc
material, and really just have bin (win32, MacOSX, Linux i386)
and texmf on, with
a minimal setup system. ie installing would consist of just
dragging the thing to your hard disk.

I need to see if I can automatically generate the demo CD easily.

I think we should devote an hour to discussing all this at Bremen.

I strongly advise against leaving out the source. It's only 20MB
and leaving it out creates too many legal problems.

    The worst variant is to zap texmf/source/ which, in fact, is much bigger
    then working texmf/tex/ :-}

It can't be zapped without legal ramifications -- you'd have to keep
those exact sources available online for several years.  Seems like the
LaTeX files could be compressed though, at the usual cost of compression
(can't directly inspect, etc.).  That's 90+% of what's in source/

Actually, I don't see the real sources (tex.web for instance) in
source/, what's in source/ now looks like fonts and dtx files and so on.

Shouldn't the real sources get installed, at least under the "all
packages" option?  (Which is what I used.)  I don't think it's 100%
necessary according to the letter of the law, but that would definitely
be in keeping with the spirit.  Sorry if I'm missing something obvious.

hmm. you are probably right. I'll make a new package called
texlive-source which will be installed _in extremis_

OK. I only hope that sorce.tar.bz2 will be still kept in /source/

The link is:

This may move somewhere else in the future, so do not publish links to

Enjoy. Comments welcome. More exciting examples too. As prevously 
requested: send PDF (or MPG or whatever is readily usable on the web) 
and some demonstration source. Send no links or URLs, send e-mail 
attachments. I got some interesting links, but they are in my maybe

Hi Sebastian, hi list!

I make a temporary tree for the package and then use

just choose a name. no restrictions

I'd be more than happy for you to do it.

after making the package, you need to add it to a collection .tpm
file, otherwise it will never get seen

I will do it, but can you be a bit more specific:
Would it look like this:
mkdir -p /tmp/texmf/omega/otp/odevnag
mkdip -p /tmp/texmf/omega/lambda/odevnag
cp *.otp /tmp/texmf/omega/otp/odevnag/
cp *.sty /tmp/texmf/omega/lambda/odevnag/
# change paths/names in `place'
# set $newpackage=1 in `place'
./place ... ??? ...

AFAIS place should be called with the package name as only argument, but
how to find the files? Do I have to add the files to 
	@Docfiles, @Sourcefiles, @Runfiles
in `place'?

Can the length of the package name be longer than 8 characters? I would
like to have odevanagari but I am not sure if this will work (DOS??)

consider the shell script below. it takes a series of zip files
and should, for each one,
 * unzip everything except binaries
 * unzip selected binaries according to what is in $all_systems.

but it does not work. the "-x $filters" just produces

  caution: excluded filename not matched:  bin\*

why? what am I doing wrong? how do I persuade unzip to
ignore everything under bin? remembering that the bin
directories do exist, and may have files in them, so wildcards
will get expanded by the shell if it gets a chance

----------------------
echo "Now copying selected packages from the lists in $work_dir... " >&2
  filters="bin\* "
  
  for f in `cat $work_dir/*.*list | sort | uniq`
  do
  if test -f $CDDIR/tpm/$f
  then

Shouldn't that be
    filters="bin/*"
instead?  At first I thought you had been overzeaulous in protecting
the * from the shell by escaping it with a backslash, but then I
realized you must have been thinking like a Windows user instead.
Well, if you really were thinking of escaping it, maybe you were
thinking like a csh user.  But the Bourne shell does not expand
wildcards in variables the way csh does.

FWIW, the version of unzip that I have does not support this exclusion
option.  The manual page for the unzip I have here says

       -x  extract files in archive (default)

So, unless you distribute your own version of unzip, I doubt there is
a portable way to achieve what you want to do.  The usual solution on
Unix systems is to use compressed tar files instead.

Do an "unzip --help". v5.40 has

Strange, I have enough old unzip on SunOS
UnZip 5.40 of 28 November 1998, by Info-ZIP. which
-x  exclude files that follow (in xlist)  
Anyway I think that unzip for every platform can be added to TL
for installation purpose.

GNU tar supports exclude lists (among a zillion other things).  So does
Solaris tar, in a more limited way as I recall.

Ok, sorry that was not the feature that is not supported by Gnu tar. the
feature I wanted is th -o option of zip which allows to set the date of
the archive to the date of the most recent file in it. Apparently no
equivalent with tar. Maybe lots of options with tar, but have a look at
'zip' ones : they are quite different.

Thanks Harald and Karl. I wish I could say "oh, of course, now
it works", but I am afraid I still cannot find
any combination which works. so I have reverted to a strategy
of explicitly extracting what I want, instead of excluding. 

Thanks for the scripting hints, Karl. I suspect you
could do an awful lot of tidy-up in install-cd.sh
if you had another 30 minutes to spare....

True enough, there's no option for that.  It would be pretty un-unixy.
Doesn't make sense with output to stdout, either.

Anyway, it can always be done after the fact (SIAK):
1) find the newest file (need GNU find):
latest=`find "$@" -type f -printf "%T@ %p\n" \
        | sort -nr | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`

2) change the archive to have the times of that file:
touch -r $latest whatever.tar.gz

    have a look at 'zip' ones : they are quite different.

Very true.

Er, yeah, it turns out I had an obsolete manual page, for a version of

I'd better do some housecleaning; it's that time of year anyway.

I see that the argument to -x is supposed to be a list of things

     (cd $TEXDIR; unzip -o -q $CDDIR/tpm/$f -x "$filters")

in case a later incarnation of the script wants to use this feature.

Hi Sebastian!

Does "Pandora is out" mean that all pandora fonts are erased or not? In
pandora.tpm there is still all the mf code in .../pandora/ mentioned,
but these files are not existent anymore.

Hi!

One question for font experts: If I have a font in opentype format from
Adobe, can I use it with TeX? I.E:
* Can I convert them to type1?
* Can I use them directly?
* Can I use them with fontinst directly or via type1 export?
* Can I access all the included glyphs (old style figures, sc, ...)

Thanks a lot and best wishes

OK, it is like this. I am pretty sure that in a previous version my
texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cnf file was overwritten. But anyway, now it's
working, thanks... BUT:

Which is the order the updmap.cnf is searched for: Only in texmf-var or
also in other pathes. Is it searched in a path set in texmf.cnf or is
the path hard wired to updmap?

It is searched using kpsewhich in $TEXMF/web2c in whatever order you
have in $TEXMF.

Well, to be more precise, it is searched by
  kpsewhich --format='web2c files'
so what really counts is the search path defined by $WEB2C.

I found that when upgrading some packages for TL, we should take
more care. The good example is minitoc (#2992). As minitoc
is not distributed in .dtx, we doesn't need texmf/source/latex/minitoc
at all (not counting the mess of intermediare files found here).
Instead it's enough:
texmf/tex/latex/minitoc/*.sty and *.mld files
texmf/doc/latex/minitoc/  all other files + making minitoc.dvi

all those 'other' files are just examples left for the user, etc.

Sebastian, can I make such cleaning (and for similar packages)?
I know that it can be annoying, and cannot be automated, but believe me 
that source/ is completelly unusable for packages like minitoc.
Thomas, the same is in teTeX2.0.2.

Well, I can use that directory for
  make -f Makefile.tetex update
  make -f Makefile.tetex doc
  make -f Makefile.tetex install
  make -f Makefile.tetex clean

That saves me a lot of time. I could, in theory, have a script for
packaging tetex-texmfsrc and I could have an exception list, but
currently, I only tar up my directory. This is so simple and convenient.

>One question for font experts: If I have a font in opentype format from
>Adobe, can I use it with TeX? I.E:

Very good question, and I have some very good answers:

Currently two students of mine are working on integration of OpenType
(and TrueType) fonts into Omega. The first one has already enhanced
odvips so that I can read a special kind of tables and produce (partial)
type 1 fonts in the PS code.

Our plan is the following:

(1) of the odvips level
when the user asks for a True/OpenType font to be used, a script called
makepfc
creates a file called PFC, which contains CharString glyph descriptions
of all glyphs in that font and stores that file on disk. Then odvips
takes the CharStrings it needs from that file and creates mini-type 1
fonts which are included in the PostScript output.

The PFC file has a TrueType file structure with tables. Another solution
for the user is to "enhance" his/her TrueType/OpenType font by adding
these tables to the font itself. In fact odvips looks first into the
True/OpenType file to see if the tables are present. If yes, then no PFC
file is created/sought.

(2) on the omega level
in the next few months my other student will work on the direct use of
OpenType fonts by omega. We have to investigate where and how the metric
information of TFM/OFM files can be included, and inversely how to obtain
as much information as possible from standard OpenType fonts.

The most interesting part will be how to use BASE, GPOS and GSUB tables
with omega (by converting them into OTPs or micro-engines, etc.).

Once these two steps are done, we only need to convert existing type 1 CM
and omega serif fonts into OpenType (with extra tables so that no
information is lost) and we will have an omega system without the need of
TFM/OFM/VF/OVF anymore.

BTW, I hope to see you all at EuroTeX 2003 where these issues (and much
more) will be thoroughly discussed : <http://omega.enstb.org/eurotex2003>

cheers

The binaries listed on the pdftex page are mirrored from 
the TeX Live Master tree. Is there a problem with binaries
or formats in the Master tree?

I'm wondering about latex as well:

 $ /home/tlprod/Master/bin/i386-linux/latex
 This is e-TeXk, Version 3.14159-2.1 (Web2C 7.4.5)
 %&-line parsing enabled.

why is latex symlinked to etex?

Ok, I understand now. 

Binaries in question point to the programs in Master tree which 
is supposed to be stable - is there need for extra formats?

I intend to submit a bunch of things to the texlive depot in a few days.
My goal is to reach a closed set of things to build documents. So that
means:
- an editor, namely xemacs + some packages
- ghostscript
- graphics tools

I  don't mean   that these packages   will  be mandatory, but a  default
configuration will  be offered  with  them.  I  don't   want to rely  on
external packages anymore, so it is easier to  package all this stuff at
once and let xemacs support the configuration.

The problem is that everyone syncing with the repository will get a copy
of  this stuff, which means x10Mb.  So I wonder if  it  is reasonable to
submit    it    in the  main   branch,  especially     given  it  is not

Sebastian,  wouldn't it be better  to create  a new branch for
windows and merge the changes when they will stabilise?

Can I put lucold into texlive? It is under GPL and on CTAN. I fixed the

I know this is messy at the moment, but since Thomas
is moving fast to a release, it makes sense for TL
source to track that and then stop.

apologies. I screwed up that source tree bad.

I have just integrated all pending changes from

they should not be identical.

source.tar.bz2 regenerated.

I suggest that you all remake binaries, as there have been
some bug fixes in eg pdftosrc and dvips.

Dear Sir, Madame

windvi.exe. The program refuses printing command and shuts down regularly.
The same behaviour when a ps file in incorporated in the TeX file (although
in that case, it depends on the file).

If you have any idea on the origin of the problem (or, better, a solution) I
would be grateful if you pointed it out to me.
Thanking you in advance,

prefer using Kile, a nice GUI for generating latex documents.

Did you upgrade to ghostscript 8.00 ? In that case, you need to use a
newer windvi available at :

ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/standalone/

Unzip it under "c:\Program Files\TeXLive".

If it does not solve the problem, please contact me.

Subject: [tex-live] bruno@clisp.org: relocatable packages
Message-ID: <200303301756.h2UHuZU17061@f7.net>

Bruno has just developed a general system for making packages
relocatable, see his detailed messages below.

Since we've expended a lot of effort on making the TeX system
relocatable (for TeX Live), I thought it would be worth forwarding.  It
would be nice if we could all use the same system at some point.

My only comment is that all this infrastructure is very nice, but it
would still not necessarily be obvious to me how to relocate a package,
because I don't know all the files that comprise it.

That is, say I installed a package in /usr/local on my machine (thus it
is intermixed with zillions of others), and then want to copy it to my
home directory on a shared machine.  If the package is relocatable, then
I can do this -- if I can find all the files.  But how do I know what
the files are?

For that matter, I've often wanted the file list for other reasons, too
-- for instance, to remove an old package.

Perhaps make install could write a manifest to $pkgdatadir/something?

Subject: [Bug-gnulib] relocatable packages

Hi all,

It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time that
packages are not relocatable. It means a user cannot copy a program,
installed by another user on the same machine, to his home directory,
and have it work correctly (including i18n). So many users need to go
through "configure; make; make install" with all its dependencies,
options and hurdles.

rpms and similar package systems solve the "ease of installation"
problem but have a drawback: they hardwire path names, usually to /usr
or /usr/local, with the consequences that
  - Users need root privileges to install a binary package,
  - It is impossible to have two different versions of the same
    package installed (which makes Unix not better than Woe32 in this
    aspect).

So I've now made GNU gettext relocatable. Thanks to automake and
gnulib, it is foreseeable that other GNU packages, like GNU tar, GNU
coreutils, GNU libiconv etc., could support --enable-relocatable
without much maintainer effort. With some support in automake the
effort will be even less than it is now.

Here is a writeup:
  - how I came to the current implementation in
    http://www.haible.de/bruno/gnu/gettext-0.12-pre2.tar.gz
  - how the user/installer sees relocatability
  - what the maintainer has to do in order to provide --enable-relocatable.

All kinds of comments are welcome.


How to make GNU packages relocatable?
=====================================

Issues:
  I) explicit references to data file (in $pkgdatadir), to executables
     (in $pkglibdir) etc.
  II) shared libraries linked to executables or referenced by other shared
      libraries

Solutions:
  I) Pathname hacking based on one of
     1) A package dependent environment variable.
     2) Symlink from /var/installprefix/<package> to where the package is.
        (Not Woe32.)
     3) An explicit way to get the executable's pathname
        - Linux: readlink /proc/self/exe
        - Woe32: GetModuleFileName(NULL,...)
        - other Unixes (except BeOS): analyze argv[0], using PATH and
          realpath.
  II) Influence shared library runtime path:
      1) A package dependent environment variable (only Linux, Solaris, OSF/1).
      2) Symlink from /var/installprefix/<package> to where the package is.
         (Not Woe32.)
      4) Use a wrapper program around each program that sets the
         variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (most Unixes, or LIBPATH on AIX, or
         SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX, or LIBRARY_PATH on BeOS, or
         DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on MacOS X, or PATH on Woe32).
      5) Force sysadmin to modify /etc/ld.so.conf (not all Unixes).
      6) Put all shared libraries into $bindir. (Only Woe32.)

Evaluation/Drawbacks:
  1) usability problem
  2) Installation requires root privilege.
  3) ok
  4) expensive at runtime but easy to use
  5) Installation requires root privilege.
  6) ok

Optimal solution:
  Linux: I.3 + II.4
  Woe32: I.3 + II.6

Relocatability of libraries:
  Scenario:
    1) Install library L,
    2) Move it to a new prefix,
    3) Install package P that uses L,
    4) Move L and P to new locations.
  Does P still work? There are three cases:
    4a) Move P but keep L where it is.
    4b) Move P and L independently (assumes they were installed in different
        prefixes in step 3).
    4c) Move P and L together to a new location (assumes they were installed
        in the same prefix in step 3).
  Evaluation if L is a shared library:
    4b) will never work because P will not know where to find L - issue II -
        except if the user sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar. Not important.
    4c) should work. Issue II is already done because is is the same as if
        step 2 had been omitted. But for issue I, we see that the data
        references of L and of P have to be relocated differently: For L,
        it must take into account the installation directory of step 1,
        while for P, it must take into account the installation directory of
        step 3. Still, the new location of P can be used to compute the new
        relocation rules for L.
    4a) should work. Issue II can be solved by hardwiring library pathnames,
        as is done usually with --enable-rpath. Issue I requires that data
        references of L and P are relocated differently, as for case 4c),
        but also that L must find its new location without referring to
        P's new location. Only works on Linux (via /proc/self/maps) and
        Woe32 (via GetModuleFileName in DllMain).
  Evaluation if L is a normal ar library:
    4a) will never work.
    4b) will never work.
    4c) should work.
  So we implement a solution for 4c) on all platforms and for 4a) on
  Linux, Woe32.

configure arguments:
  --enable-relocatable


User's, installer's view:
=========================

  --enable-relocatable makes the entire installed packages relocatable.
  This means, it can be moved or copied to a different location on the
  filesystem.
  It is possible to make symlinks to the installed and moved programs,
  and invoke them through the symlink. It is possible to do the same thing
  with a hard link _only_ if the hard linked file is in the same directory
  as the real program.

  For reliability it is best to give together with --enable-relocatable a
  --prefix option pointing to an otherwise unused (and never used again)
  directory, for example, --prefix=/tmp/inst$$. This is recommended
  because on some OSes the executables remember the location of shared
  libraries (and prefer them over LD_LIBRARY_PATH !), therefore such an
  executable will look for its shared libraries first in the original
  installation directory and only then in the current installation directory.

  Installation with --enable-relocatable will not work for setuid / setgid
  executables. (This is because such an executable kills its LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  variable when it is launched.)

  The runtime penalty and size penalty are nearly zero on Linux (just one
  system call more when an executable is launched), and small on other
  systems (the wrapper program just sets an environment variable and execs
  the real program).


Maintainer's view:
==================

  How to add relocatable support to a package?

  I assume you use automake. (Without automake the Makefile.in changes
  get so big that I'd recommend to switch to automake first.)

  I assume you have a lib/ directory in which you have auxiliary modules,
  from gnulib and others.

  * config.libpath
  * reloc-ldflags
  * install-reloc
    Add these scripts to your aux directory (AC_AUX_DIR argument), or to
    the top level directory if you have none.
  - config.libpath is used during autoconfiguration to determine the handling
    of shared library search paths by your system. It is a separate script so
    support for new systems can be added to it without the need to regenerate
    all configure files.
  - reloc-ldflags is invoked by the Makefiles to determine some additional
    flags to be used when linking, for systems supporting this method of
    relocatability.
  - install-reloc is invoked by the Makefiles to install a program in a
    relocatable way.

  * lib/ sources
    You need to add the following source files:

    + For use by your programs:

      - relocatable.h, relocatable.c
        Provides the function relocate() that transforms an installation-time
        pathname to a run-time pathname.

      - progname.h, progname.c
        Provides the function set_program_name() that you must call. It
        performs the preparations for relocate() to work later.

      - xreadlink.h, xreadlink.c
        Part of set_program_name()'s job is to determine the full pathname
        of the program at run time. On Linux, it does this by reading the
        symlink /proc/self/exe provided by the kernel. The xreadlink()
        function is a safe variant of readlink(), for this purpose.

      - canonicalize.h, canonicalize.c
        Part of set_program_name()'s job is to determine the full pathname
        of the program at run time. On other platforms than Linux, this is
        done by looking at argv[0]. But argv[0] can be a symlink, which must
        be resolved first. If we're unlucky enough that this symlink contains
        "../" components, simple string operations are not enough for
        resolving it; we need the full power of realpath() or
        canonicalize_file_name().

      - xmalloc.h, xmalloc.c, xstrdup.c
        Failsafe memory allocation. The modules above need it.

      - error.h, error.c
        Pretty error signalling routine. xmalloc needs it.

      - pathmax.h
        Usual pathname size, needed by canonicalize.c.

      - alloca_.h, alloca.c
        Memory allocation on the stack, needed by canonicalize.c.

      - memmove.c
        Needed by canonicalize.c.

      - stdbool.h.in
        Needed by progname.c.

    + For the wrapper programs:

      - relocwrapper.c
        This is the wrapper itself. Its purpose is to find out where
        the real program is, and invoke it.

      - setenv.h, setenv.c, unsetenv.c
        The wrapper program needs to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable (or
        another, similar variable depending on the OS) to ensure that the
        real program will find its shared libraries after it has moved
        (together with its shared libraries).

      - strerror.c
        The wrapper program needs to print an error message when it cannot
        execute the real program. It needs strerror().

  * lib/Makefile.am

    Assuming that your Makefile gathers all modules in a libfoo.a, you'll
    have to add:
    - to libfoo_a_SOURCES
        error.h error.c
        pathmax.h
        progname.h progname.c
        xmalloc.h xmalloc.c xstrdup.c
        xreadlink.h xreadlink.c
    - to libfoo_a_LIBADD
        @ALLOCA@ @LIBOBJS@
        (or @LTALLOCA@ @LTLIBOBJS@ if you link libfoo with libtool)
    - to EXTRA_DIST
        alloca_.h alloca.c
        canonicalize.h canonicalize.c
        memmove.c
        relocatable.h relocatable.c
        relocwrapper.c
        setenv.h setenv.c unsetenv.c
        strerror.c
    - the rules for creating alloca.h if necessary
    - the rules for creating stdbool.h if necessary

  * m4/ macros

    Add these files:
      m4/alloca.m4
      m4/canonicalize.m4
      m4/error.m4
      m4/lib-ld.m4
      m4/onceonly.m4
      m4/pathmax.m4
      m4/relocatable.m4
      m4/setenv.m4
      m4/stdbool.m4
      m4/strerror.m4
      m4/xalloc.m4
      m4/xreadlink.m4

  * m4/Makefile.am

    Add the added files to EXTRA_DIST.

  * configure.ac

    Ensure it has the following invocations:
      AC_RELOCATABLE
      gl_FUNC_ALLOCA
      gl_CANONICALIZE
      gt_FUNC_ERROR_AT_LINE
      AC_REPLACE_FUNCS([memmove])
      gl_PATHMAX
      gt_FUNC_SETENV
      gt_STDBOOL_H
      gl_FUNC_STRERROR
      gl_XALLOC
      gl_XREADLINK

  * Your sources

    1) In every program, add to main() as the first statement (even before
       setting the locale or doing anthing related to libintl):

         set_program_name (argv[0]);

    2) Everywhere where you use a constant pathname from installation-time,
       wrap it in relocate() so it gets translated to the run-time situation.
       Example:

         bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR);

       becomes:

         bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, relocate (LOCALEDIR));

    3) In every shell script, add near the beginning the "Support for
       relocatability" section from gettextize.in. You can take the two
       functions without modifications; only the following need to be
       adapted:

       if test "@RELOCATABLE@" = yes; then
         exec_prefix="@exec_prefix@"
         bindir="@bindir@"
         orig_installdir="$bindir" # see Makefile.am's *_SCRIPTS variables
         func_find_curr_installdir # determine curr_installdir
         func_find_prefixes
         # Relocate the directory variables that we use.
         gettext_dir=`echo "$gettext_dir/" | sed -e "s%^${orig_installprefix}/%${curr_installprefix}/%" | sed -e 's,/$,,'`
       fi

       Here you adapt the definition of orig_installdir, depending on where
       the script gets installed. And at the end, instead of gettext_dir you
       transform those variables that you need.

  * Your Makefile.am

    For every program foo, that gets installed in, say, $(bindir), you add

      foo_CFLAGS = -DINSTALLDIR=\"$(bindir)\"
      if RELOCATABLE_VIA_LD
      foo_LDFLAGS = `$(RELOCATABLE_LDFLAGS) $(bindir)`
      endif

    And the following also also necessary, once per Makefile.am that installs
    a program:

      # Support for relocatability.
      RELOCATABLE_LIBRARY_PATH = $(libdir)
      RELOCATABLE_SRC_DIR = $(top_srcdir)/lib
      RELOCATABLE_BUILD_DIR = ../lib
      RELOCATABLE_CONFIG_H_DIR = ..
      @SET_RELOCATABLE@

    Here RELOCATABLE_LIBRARY_PATH denotes the directories in which your
    package (or any package you rely on, for example, gettext-runtime)
    has installed libraries. It is a colon separated list.

    RELOCATABLE_SRC_DIR denotes where to find relocwrapper.c and the related
    sources, so you need them only once in your package, even if you have
    multiple directories which install programs.

    RELOCATABLE_CONFIG_H_DIR denotes where to find the config.h which defines
    the various HAVE_* macros that relocwrapper.c and the related sources
    need.

    @SET_RELOCATABLE@ is some black magic that is filled in by the
    AC_RELOCATABLE macro.

Hi Alexandre,

    Some time ago I was a user of GNU Stow.  I don't recall why I
    stopped, but ISTR Stow would address that kind of issue.

Well, not everyone wants to use stow or similar sysems.  And if I
install the package in its own prefix then the whole thing is a moot
point.  But this is not the standard way to install things (for good
reason, IMHO), so ...

    plus I'm not sure this sort of administravia falls into `make
    install''s job.

Hmm, seems to me that nothing else has the necessary information.
Automake (autoconf?) is what knows what files are getting installed,
because it's creating the install targets.  Is there any harm in having
it create a manifest file?

Anyway ...

Similarly someone recently suggested on the automake list that
`make install' creates an `uninstall.sh' script (the problem
with `make uninstall' is that you need to keep the source tree).
There are many issues related to user's install/unstall rules,
plus I'm not sure this sort of administravia falls into `make
install''s job.

Actually that suggestion is many years old.  That's why the
PRE_INSTALL and POST_INSTALL fuss was introduced, so that you could
filter out the "make" verbiage when running "make -n uninstall
>uninstall.sh".
