Looks like there is something in the TeX output before begin{document}

Using fontenc T1 gets rid of the first error message, but the second

Can someone enlighten me what went wrong in TeX live at the moment?

On a different system with tetex (debian woody) it works without any
problems, mainly because is does not use lefrench, but babel files:

1) Many users get confused by the "french" option of babel,
which is ambiguous: it loads
-- frenchle.ldf (freeware from Bernard gaulle) or
   frenchpro.ldf (shareware from Bernard gaulle) if present
   on the system (in the path),
-- or frenchb.ldf otherwise.

The "official" .ldf file for French (integrated in babel) 
is frenchb.ldf *not* 'frenchle', *nor* 'frenchpro'.

To be sure to get 'frenchb' loaded, you should code
\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}
or
\usepackage[francais]{babel}

2) If you use diacritics ('?' in the above file)
   you should uncomment \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
   and add \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} or
   \usepackage{aeguill} or ... if you want correct
   hyphenation for words with diacritics.

   The above file compiled with \usepackage[frenchb]{babel}
   would produce no error, but would *not* print
   the '?' (this is normal!).

Do we really need all that stuff with .vf, .tfm and .sty files?
URW fonts (with KB names) are finally corrected on CTAN and they
serve as replacements of standard Adobe fonts (see download35.map).
Now we have for TL urwstd package:
1. urw/base35 as on CTAN (but missing README.base35)
2. urw/antiqua as on CTAN
3. urw/grotesq as on CTAN
4. other stuff (vf, tfm, sty, fd, map and config files, but only for 
   base35) ~3 MB
Perhaps it would be more clear making for 4. another package,
say urw35vf (like urwvn) which requires installing urwstd.

----
About .pfm files: they are sometimes in 
1. texmf/fonts/pfm/<supplier>/<family>/  or in
2. texmf/fonts/type1/<supplier>/<family>/ (together with .pfb files)

Variant 1. is unusable at all when installing a font in Windows (and 
OS/2, and ?), e.g. for other applications. I think that's just a mistake 
in TDS layout putting .pfm "somewhere", without rethinking usability ;-).
Variant 2. is OK, and since .pfm files are rather small, I'd suggest
moving all .pfm files (not so many) to fonts/type1/<supplier>/<family>/

Any objections?

I didnt realize that. I usually think of fonts/pfm/<supplier>/<font>,
but clearly I was wrong.

Can you adjust all these or shall I?

Sure, you can join just about any TeX user group and get the TeX Live CD
as a benefit of membership.  Since you're in Canada, the most likely
would be TUG (http://tug.org/join.html), but see
http://tug.org/usergroups.html for a list of other user groups if you're
interested.

You can also download the cd image and/or the individual software over
the Internet, if you have the time and bandwidth.  It's all on CTAN.

If it makes a difference to you, the new version of TeX Live is
scheduled for release in early August (no guarantees, though).

Thanks,
karl

For TeX and friends .pfm files can be considered as auxiliary for .pfb,
not real metrics.
All .pfm files on TL take less then 1.7MB (.pfb files ~192 MB)
Having .pfm and .pfb together means also that we'll remove
fonts/pfm tree and the whole structure (and ls-R ;-) will be smaller.

usability vs. stricte guidelines... I think that TDS standard
could follow that idea.

Why not. If they have Adobe Type Menager ("light" version is free,
Win 2000 and XP even doesn't need it), they can use Type 1 fonts in
all graphics applications and produce .eps files included in TeX files,
having the same fonts in labels, math symbols, etc., as used in 
the text.

I did a recompile from source a few days ago and compared to the
binaries I produced some time ago, the one which are current in Master.
I found that only a few files are different (using cmp), namely:
altpdfamstex
altpdfcontext
altpdfetex
altpdflatex
altpdftex
dt2dv
epstopdf
mft
mmafm
mmpfb
pdftosrc
tex4ht
Some of them are scripts, so no problem with them.

But the situation may be different for other archs.

Other questions: Are there any fixes in source.development which
will/should go to source before `final' texlive2003 ?

Best wishes

yes. pdftex is the big issue. I guess Martin needs to advise us on

    I need to ask what we think we are doing about a release of TeX Live.
    In particular:

     a) can anyone update the documentation?

Just today, I received a few updates for the Windows part of the install
from our one volunteer.  I haven't looked at them yet.

I still intend to review it all myself, although of course if anyone
else has time and inclination, that would be great.

I wonder, can we just build the cd images nightly?  (Obviously not
saving them!)  That way, it'll be easy for me and anyone else to look at
and test the current thing "as if" we were releasing at any given time.

     b) shall we use the current set of binaries, or compile a new set from
    source.development?

For one thing, I think we pretty much have to wait for the new version
of LaTeX.  Frank said it will have a new license, and many fixes and
enhancements.  I don't have an ETA.

Yes, I think so, if we install some extra software on the TUG box. Can
you get a current libxslt on there?

hm... it's generally better to use PFB+AFM+INF for installing the
type1 fonts under windows, rather than PFB+PFM, since PFM is just the
cut version of AFM+INF, and PFM doesn't contain any information about
glyphs not present in the default encoding. From AFM+INF, it is
possible to generate the PFM for any system locale.

So it seems that having AFM+INF files on CD is better than PFM files:
the latter are of limited usage.

Then, would we move AFM and INF to the same directories as PFB? i
guess, no...

Well, we can give him a month or so.  If it hasn't materialized by then
or at least have a firm (and early) date, we'll have no choice but to go

It is not so clear for me how source.development/ is promoted
to source/. Apart from changes in pdftex (Martin writes about that),
we have some changes in dvips: Tomas and Fabrice cleaned up some annoying 
bugs (thanks!), so I think that the version number 5.92b should be also
changed at least to 5.92c (or 5.93) - to have a reference to the 
behaviour. Tomas?

I'd suggest remaking (as usual) all platform dependent binaries, which 
are put on he depot, only from source/. Right? 
Will do that for Linux.

You are right, but... for average windows user it is too complicated ;-}
Any advanced user should know that (and *have* proper tools).

Quite of all Type1 fonts distributed on CTAN and TL doesn't have .inf 
files at all. Only very few.

Still compromise: *usability* in the TeX environment. AFM files are
sometimes needed for TeX related programs (afm2tfm, ps2pk, etc.)

Well, afaik, the differences between source / source.development are
(resp. should be):
  - libtool (in source.development) instead of klibtool (in source)
  - new tex.web in source.development

I am unsure about the status of e-TeX and Omega with regard to the
new tex.web changes. Peter wanted to make a new e-TeX release, but
I have not yet seen this. And Omega ... I have no idea what should
be done about it.

That libtool vs. klibtool stuff causes a lot of differences in all
drivers' Makefiles etc. Maybe, source should follow source.development,
except for the new tex.web? I know that e.g. Karl would very much prefer
the new tex.web for TL8, but I think that breaking e-TeX and Omega is
not worth it...

I have made (in my source tree) all the changes to accomodate the new
tex.web file. But I can't guarantee anything about the result, apart
that the usual tests do run. I even added encTeX to web2c 7.5.2, on top
of TeX 3.141592. If you want the change files, I can upload them to
source.development.

plus the fact that this strange thing eomega does not compile  at all at
present (change file error).

my inclination is to promote only the changes to cjkutils, dvips and
pdftex from source.development to source, and hope that this can be done
faily painlessly. 

The libtool upgrade is a Good Thing, if we can easily promote that as
well?

I share Thomas' reluctance to promote the unconfirmed changes to etex
and omega, just to get the tex.web in.

I am starting a process to push new CD inages to

I make significant changes or on request.

The images that will be there later today (prefixed "beta-") 
contain a revised Unix/Linux install script which I believe
functions correctly, and a revised TeXsetup.exe which may even
work with the layout I built - but be warned that Fabrice and I
are still refining the precise layout on the compressed CD.

Installing from the "live" CD is still an unknown, and I don't
really imagine I will have any time to work on it.

Unfortunatelly, it cannot work on win (cannot find tpm files),
so please remove that. I'll noticed many changes in tpm, lists
and win binaries after making .iso.
Since the final layout of the CD differs from what we have in the depot,
I'd suggest just making another directory at the same level as
Master and Build for the contents of CD1, CD2 (DVD?). It can avoid
uploading the whole .iso and burning the CD (at least for win users,
since on unix/linux we can just mount the image ;-)
Those involved in testing on win (hey, are there somebody else?)
could just mount the proper directory from the local depot.
Unix/Linux dames and gentelmen can deselect syncing that directory.
Would you please consider that? (maybe I'm wrong).

I cannot do any changes until the weekend; hopefully by then
Fabrice will have been able to check TeXSetup

Yes, I could do that, if we have space. the DVD is simply Master, of course.
I could make that part of Perforce only store the current revision

    Since the final layout of the CD differs from what we have in the depot,
    I'd suggest just making another directory at the same level as
    Master and Build for the contents of CD1, CD2 (DVD?). It can avoid

Why are we making the DVD and the CD different?  Trying to keep them in
sync sounds painful.  Why not just put the compressed files on the dvd as
well, so they can be the same?  How many people will really care about
running TL live from the DVD?  Seems vanishingly small to me.  (The
number of people who can use the dvd in the first place is already tiny.)

For that matter, I've always wondered why Master exists at all, and
isn't just created by running make in Build.

This is what the person who volunteered sent me, a few days ago.

Since it's regarding the Windows part of the documentation -- Fabrice and
Staszek, maybe you'd like to look at it?  I have not checked to see what
changes he's actually suggesting.

If it's good, we should at least send him a free cd :).

Karl,

I have read the section `Installation and use under Windows' and used it
for the first time.

Attached you will find a suggested modification of the text. Some
English errors have been corrected (new ones introduced?). I have tried
to make the speak more direct and even removed some small things.

Since the file could not run (no figures, no \acro and other macros,
fonts missing) I first stripped it , modified, TeXed, and finally
restored by hand to what I think is correct.

Hopefully something could be of use.

\section{Installation and use under Windows}
\label{sec:wintex}
The Win32 \TeX{} system applies to computers that
 run Windows 9x,  ,  \acro{ME},
 \acro{NT},  \acro{2K} or  \acro{XP}.
It includes the \textsf{Windvi} previewer, whose
documentation is found in \OnCD{texmf/doc/html/windvi/windvi.html}.

You use the  Win32 \TeX{} system either from your harddisk
or from the \CD{} as a ready-to-run system. In the former case you first
install it onto your harddisk and this is done by means of the
\texttt{TeXLive.exe} program.

In order to use it ready-to-run, your Windows system must be so set up,
that it uses the
Microsoft Joliet extensions for reading \CD s; simply look at the
\CD{} in Explorer and see whether it shows long, mixed-case, file
names. If it does not then you have to install the system onto your hard
disk.


\subsection[The TeXLive.exe program]{The \texttt{TeXLive.exe} program}

The \texttt{TeXLive.exe} program offers an integrated environment from
which you can perform various tasks such as to install
 the Win32 \TeX{} system onto your hard disk or run the system directly
 from the \CD{}. The program either auto-runs, when the \CD{} is inserted
 into the reader, or you have to start it by double clicking on
 \path|bin/win32/TeXLive.exe|
 on the \CD{} from
the Explorer window. From the tool-bar of \texttt{TeXLive.exe} you
select:%

\begin{itemize}
\item Install \TeX{} on your hard disk,
\item Install TeX-oriented editors on your hard disk,
\item Install support packages on your hard disk (Ghostscript, NetPBM,
  \ldots)
\item Do some maintenance on you \TeX{} system,
\item Remove the \TeX{} system,
\item Use \TeX{} off the CD{},
\item Cleanup the temporary files created on your hard disk when using
  \TeX{} off the CD{},
\item Update some of the DLLs on your system,
\item Browse some documentation: TeXLive{} documentation, TUG web
  pages, fpTeX web pages,
\item Run the cmdname{TeXdocTK} application to find specific documentation.
\end{itemize}


\subsection[Running \protect\TeXLive{} from the CD-ROM]{Running from
the \protect\CD{}}

You can run all the \TeX{} programs directly off the \CD.
This gives you
access to all macros and fonts immediately, but the \TeX{} system runs
slower than if you first install it onto the hard disk.
In order to work effectively, the system  needs to modify
environment variables and to create some small auxiliary directories
onto your hard disk.  These directories will contain necessary
configuration files which
allow you to modify program settings and to generate a necessary
`format file'. Automatically generated font files
will be stored in these directories as well.

When you run \TeX{} from the \CD, then you do as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
\item from the menu, chose \verb|Explore CD-Rom|, then
  \verb|Select a text editor|, a dialog box will open to select some
  path|.exe|
  program.

  This program needs to be a \TeX{}-oriented editor. It must be able
  to run the \TeX{} compiler, previewer and any other needed tool. If
  you don't have one already installed on your system, you can install
  one from the \CD{}; for  details see section~{\ref{sec:texlive-install}}.

  \emph{There is no way  we can guess if the program you will
    select is actually a text editor, so please be careful}.

  Here is a list of frequently used \TeX{} editors:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}[ht]{ll}
    GNU Emacs & path|c:/Program Files/NTEmacs/bin/runemacs.exe| \\
    XEmacs & path|c:/Program Files/XEmacs/XEmacs-21.2/i586-pc-win32/xemacs.exe| \\
    WinShell & path|c:/Program Files/WinShell/WinShell.exe| \\
    WinEdt & path|c:/Program Files/WinEdt Team/WinEdt/WinEdt.exe|\\
    TeXnicCenter & path|c:/Program Files/TeXnicCenter/TEXCNTR.exe|
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
 The editor
  selected will be memorized and used in future runs.

\item from the menu, chose \verb|Explore CD-Rom|, then
  \verb|Run TeX off CD-Rom|. The environment will be modified, a small
  temporary directory created and some configuration files copied
  there. Thereafter the selected editor starts, and you
  will be able to type in some text, let \TeX{} typeset it and finally
  view  or print your text.

  If Ghostscript is not detected on your machine, then
  you will be warned
  that the system might fail to render your DVI files.
  Notice that you can install Ghostscript from
  the path|Install|, path|Support| menu item. Refer to
  section~\ref{sec:texlive-install} for details.

\item you can select a different text editor any time you want.

\item if you chose \verb|Cleanup CD-Rom setup|, everything \TeX{}
  installed on your disk will be removed; even
  the selection of your text
  editor.  However, any one of the extra packages that you may have
  installed, e.g. \cmdname{WinShell} or \cmdname{NTEmacs},
    will not be removed.
\end{enumerate}


\smallskip {\small\noindent \textbf{[For advanced users:]} You can
  also use the small batch file \path|mkloctex.bat| which is called from
  \path|setupw32| of the \CD.  From the Start menu select
  `Run', then browse the \CD drive and select \path|mkloctex.bat|. The
  batch procedure requires two command-line parameters : the
  letter of your \CD drive and the letter of the hard disk where you
  want to install the \TeX\ directory, e.g. \verb+d:\setupw32\mkloctex.bat d c+.
  When the installation is
  complete, then please read carefully the on-screen information. If you
  run Windows 9x/\acro{ME}, then you will have to restart Windows in order
  to complete.

  \chgbigx{Readers comment: It is not explained for what the procedure {\tt mkloctex} is good
  } }

\smallskip {\small\noindent \textbf{[For very advanced users:]}
The editor runs inside a modified environment. A temporary
TDS-compliant
texmf-tree is built in the temporary area created on your disk.
Here files that may be built on the fly, like pk font
files or format files, are stored.
Configuration files are copied from the \CD{}
to this texmf tree, so that you can edit them should need be.
The \path|ls-R| database for this texmf-tree is computed .
Then  the \texttt{PATH} and \texttt{TEXMFCNF} environment
variables are set locally, and the  editor is run in
this local environment. From within your editor\footnote{Actually, you can
  state any other program than a text editor, and select your command
  processor for example. You will then get a console with the right
  settings to use \TeX{} from the \CD{}.}, you have access to a full
\TeXLive{} environment so that all files that are referenced will be
found on the \CD{}.}


\subsection{Installing editors or support packages to your hard disk}
\label{sec:texlive-install}

You may use the \path|TeXSetup.exe| program to install a
non-\TeX{} package. This may be an editor
such as \cmdname{WinShell} or \cmdname{NTEmacs},
or a support package like \cmdname{NetPBM}
(graphics formats conversion) or \cmdname{Ghostscript}.

Some of the packages are not free, or not with the
same meaning {\bf  What does this mean?} as for
the rest of the \CD{}. These packages can be installed through
the Internet. You need to enable an Internet connection in order to
install them. If you choose the \path|Enable Internet access| then
your system will be searched for an active Internet connection,
or start one if if none is found.
 \emph{If your computer is not connected to the Internet,
  then the timeout might be long, 30s or more}.

Do not request this option unless you know that your Internet access works.

At present only the most important
auxiliary
packages are available from the \CD{}.  These are
the editors \cmdname{NTEmacs} and \cmdname{WinShell}
and the general support programs \cmdname{Ghostscript} and
\cmdname{NetPBM}. It is \TeX{}4ht that requires \cmdname{NetPBM}.

The downloadable packages are sometimes huge: \cmdname{Perl} is 10Mb,
\cmdname{XEmacs} is 50Mb, so be warned that it can take a lot of time
to download. The program \path|TeXSetup.exe| does not yet provide an
estimate of the time needed to complete the download.

When you install these packages, \path|TeXSetup| works in
unattended mode. However, programs that have their own installer,
e.g. WinEdt or Ghostscript, will require your interaction.

Packages without an installer will be unpacked and configured
for your system. You will be required to specify the directory where
they will be installed. This directory must be the root
directory of the whole installation. {\bf Here I cannot understand
what is meant by `the whole installation'} Assume that you wish to install
\cmdname{NTEmacs} into the directory \path/c:/Local/,
then that is the directory
that you shall specify.


\subsection{Installing the Win32 \TeX{}to your hard disk}

Insert the \TeXLive{} \CD, and wait for it to autostart. Then select
\verb|Install| from the menu that appears, then the subitem
\verb|TeXLive|. This invokes the
\path/TeXSetup.exe/\footnote{If the \CD{} does not autostart,
then run \path/TeXSetup.exe/ from the \OnCD{path/bin/win32/} directory.}
 which
is a Windows wizard that will display several pages while running.



\begin{description}
\item[Welcome Page]
  You can choose a \emph{quick} installation from
  here.  In this case, the installation will run without any human
  assistance from beginning to end, with all the default settings.
    (Figure~\ref{graph:setup-src},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the left%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the top%
  \else
  on the left%
  \fi\fi
  )
   However, if you choose to install any support program that has its
  own installer like \cmdname{WinEdt} or \cmdname{Ghostscript}, your intervention might be required.
  If you have enough privileges  then you can decide
  to install the \TeXLive{} for all users or for yourself only by
  checking the appropriate box.

    \fi
  \fi
 \caption{The \TeXLive{} setup wizard}\label{graph:setup-src}
 \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\item[Source Page]
  This page is a bit complex. It allows you to select two source
  directories for your \TeXLive{} system
  (Figure~\ref{graph:setup-src},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the right%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the bottom%
  \else
  on the right%
  \fi\fi
  ).
  You will need a \emph{local source directory} and
  possibly a \emph{remote source directory}.

  Why do we need both these directories? All files of the
  \TeXLive{} system are on the \CD{}, but some other  useful packages
  are not. The reason for that is
  either because space is too small or
  their license is not compatible with the \TeXLive{}'s one.
  You need to enable Internet downloading if you want to install these
  other packages.

  However, don't panic: the default parameters of the setup will allow
  you to install a full system using the \CD{} only. Simply, you won't
  have \file{WinEdt} for example, but you will be able to install it
  later.

  This leaves you with the following sources of files:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the \CD{} or any similar flat tree of files, available through
    some standard directory (this means the \CD{} can be mounted on
    some remote machine and be made available through network    sharing),
  \item a set of  \file{.zip} files (this is the case when you are
    installing the
    \fpTeX{} distribution),
  \item the Internet, in which case the program \texttt{TeXLive.exe}
  downloads the \file{.zip}- files it needs for you.
  \end{itemize}
  This option is available only if you enable Internet file
  downloading in the right part of the page. You also need to
  configure this Internet access by selecting to connect either using
  Internet Explorer~5 \file{wininet.dll}, or using a direct connection (\texttt{ftp},
   \texttt{http}).
% or using a proxy server.
%   Last, you can be assisted in defining the \emph{local source
%     directory} and \emph{remote source directory} which will be used
%   to copy the files onto your hard disk. The \texttt{browse} buttons
%   allow to select a directory for the former, and an url among a list
%   of mirrors for the latter.
\item[Root Page]
  On this page, you will tell where you want the files to be
  installed (Figure~\ref{graph:root-schm},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the left%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the top%
  \else
  on the left%
  \fi\fi
  ) .  Only the root directory really matters; the other ones
  are set according to the root one. You may want to make
  \path|$TEXMFEXTRA| point to some TDS compliant directory with other
  \TeX}{} files or assign a different value to
  \path|$HOMETEXMF|, which is set by default to whatever Windows think
  is your `HOME' location.

 \end{center}
\end{figure*}
\item[Get TPM Page]
  This page does not require any manual intervention. The \file{.tpm}
  files which describe collections and packages are retrieved
  (possibly from the Internet), unzipped if needed and parsed.
\item[Schemes Page]
  On this page, you will select the global `scheme' of your
  installation (Figure~\ref{graph:root-schm},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the right%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the bottom%
  \else
  on the right%
  \fi\fi
  ).  A `scheme' is a large set of files targeted at some kind
  of usage. There are 3 generic schemes for basic, recommended and
  full installation. The other ones are devoted to LUGs (what GUST or
  GUTenberg propose for their members) or applications (XML and
  \TeX{}).
  When a scheme is selected, it is still possible to refine the
  selection by checking the appropriate box. If doing so, you will be
  presented the packages-page to change your selection, else you will
  jump to the review page.
\item[Packages Page]
  Collections and packages are presented in a tree form
  (Figure~\ref{graph:win32-support},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the left%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the top%
  \else
  on the left%
  \fi\fi
  ). The links
  in the tree are dependency links. Collections \emph{depend on}
  packages and maybe other collections, and it is the same for each
  package. You can select any package or collection individually, but
  your request will be granted only if the object is not requested by
  another one which is selected. For example, you can't deselect
  \texttt{tex-basic} without deselecting all the collections that
  request it.

  The \texttt{win32-support} collection displayed on the picture is Win32 specific. It
  holds a number of bonus packages (Figure~\ref{graph:win32-support},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the right%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the bottom%
  \else
  on the right%
  \fi\fi
  )   which can be installed
  automatically and individually: \cmdname{Ghostscript}, the
  \cmdname{PostScript}
  interpreter, \TeX{} oriented editors, tools like \cmdname{Perl},
  \LaTeX{}2HTML, etc. \emph{None of these packages are selected by
    default}. Some of them have an Internet Explorer icon on their
  right, which means that they are not on the \CD{} and that they will be
  available only if you previously enabled  Internet
  downloading. \emph{This collection cannot be selected entirely at
    once: you need to select the packages individually}. This is to
  avoid unwanted downloads of huge files.

  On this page, you also have the information about disk space
  needed: for each object, and for the set of those who are selected,
  and also the disk space available on the partition selected for the
  installation. Last, you can choose to install or not the
  documentation files and source files associated with each package.
\item[Review Page]
  You will find there a summary of your choices
  (Figure~\ref{graph:review},
  \ifnum \Status = 1

  \else\ifnum \Status=2

  ). All the files not
  yet available on your local disk are first downloaded from the
  remote source directory on the Internet. Then every package is
  unpacked (if \path|.zip| files), or copied from the \CD{}.
\item[Configuration Page]  Several  packages  need some  configuration
  step to  make them usable (Figure~\ref{graph:configuration},
  \ifnum \Status = 1
  on the left%
  \else\ifnum \Status=2
  at the top%
  \else
  on the left%
  \fi\fi
  ). Also the  \TeXLive{} system  needs some post-processing  step
  (format  files generation,  ls-R   databases generation, environment
  variables, etc.). All these operations are  done there,
  and some of them   can be lengthy.

Please be aware that the choice of cluster size on DOS disk
partitions can radically affect the size of your \TeX\
installation. The support tree has hundreds of small files, and it is
not unusual for a complete installation to take up to 4 times the
amount of space used on the \CD.

I must admit that the 'live' thing is not as much interesting as it used
to be due to the dvd thing. However, I may have a usable subset of the
current TL which fits on a cdrom and that could be used on both linux
and win32.

At least for Windows, that wouldn't work. And there are many things you
can't just 'make' in Master/ (even if that would be desirable).

Yes, we definitely want to have a live (demo/subset) cd, as we
discussed.  That's what we've been promising.

However, that's a different issue from whether the dvd is live, or just
a copy of the installable cd.  For simplicity, my suggestion was to make
it the same as the installable.

So I guess we're going to need at least two "runtime" directories.  I'm
not sure what Master corresponds to right now -- I don't see anything
compressed there ... Help?

no! the DVD is to be live! its simply a copy of the entire Master
tree. it has its own installer for unix, install-dvd.sh

read Master/Tools/MakeCD.sh to see how I propose to  build
both compressed installable CD, and the live demo CD. we might
use Fabrice's method instead, but the logic should be clear
(at least to you, since you can grok sh :-})

there is no sync; there are all products built from a master source

I am building that automatically, by installing the "texlive-live"
scheme. it would be a good idea if we both worked on that same spec...

... and this install-dvd.sh can also work as installer for "small-live"
CD on Linux. It just uses available list files.

Only small notes when installing on Linux from mounted .iso:
  1 out of 57, disk space required:   2901 kB (??? for recommended?)

Counting required disk space somehow doesn't work.

  This is a summary of all `failed' messages and warnings:
  install_link failed for /usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/mf. File already exists.

Not so dangerous.

I will propose a new set of sources next week - basically, everything

there was a new version of mminstance (1.21) recently which addressed
the problems with gcc-3.3, so we need to update mminstance on
perforce: the latest version is at
http://www.lcdf.org/type/mminstance-1.21.tar.gz

but as far as i remember, the version at perforce is not "official"
one, but with some changes made by Fabrice, which are not in the
official version.

so, it would be good if Fabrice can submit his changes to Eddie Kohler
(maintainer of mminstance).

Best,
v.

I did that long ago for all the patches (many parts  of the source tree)
I  had  to  apply  to compile    cleanly on win32.   Unfortunately  (and
expectedly !) I got few feed back. Anyway, the patches are not very
large, I can maintain them separately.

*inst* still cannot install on Windows. Please move TeXSetup.exe
to /tpm/

>  .*demo.*: ready to run cut-down CD

As I see, the only difference between *demo* (texlive-live.scheme)
and *full* is tex-langcjk, not counting /support tree, etc.
As for *demo*, /source/ is not needed, I think. So we have 20MB 
to spare. 
Fabrice, is source/source-win32-patch.tar.bz2 still needed ?

Conclusion: for all those people not equiped with DVD, *demo*
can serve as *live*: runnable from the CD, browseable and...
instalable for most cases. Additional (huge) packages can be installed
from the second disk.
If you put all install* + config* scripts and tpm/lists/ all 
*.scheme (without only texlive-full.scheme), all things will work
on Unix/Linux. Even "recommended" scheme can be left as default.
I checked that, howgh!

Using *demo* (I'd suggest *lite* vs. *full*) on Unix/Linux directly from
the CD:
1. as before, we can install texmf-var, copy some files to and set some 
   variables, than can configure, generate format(s), etc.;
2. we can also use the CD in really demo mode, setting
some variables and making the only needed format in the current 
directory, e.g. for bash tlcd.sh (just a skeleton):

#!/bin/sh
export PATH=/mnt/cdrom/bin/i386-linux:$PATH
export TEXMFCNF=/mnt/cdrom/texmf/web2c
export TEXMF=/mnt/cdrom/texmf
etex -ini latex.ini

then sourcing: ". tlcd.sh" 
 
Almost the same can be done in Windows. This is a strategy for bold
people ;-):
open command/cmd window
md test
cd test

@echo off
:: Run: tlcd e latex
:: where %1 - CD ROM drive letter; %2 - format to be made
rem observe case of the following ;-):
set Path=%1:\BIN\WIN32;%PATH%
set TEXMFCNF=%1:/texmf/web2c
:: we use only one TeX tree
set TEXMF=!!%1:/texmf
@echo Variable check
kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMF
kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMFCNF
kpsewhich texmf.cnf
@echo Now we'll generate the local format file: %2
@echo Press any key, or Ctrl-C to abort
pause >nul
etex -ini %2.ini
:: or
REM pdeftex -ini %2.ini
@echo READY! Happy TeX-ing!

One can ask: what about the editor for Win32? The answer is: every windows
system has simple "edit" text editor working in the command line, even win
xp ;-)) It can load without problems big files having unix line endings,
like texbook.tex. So it is quite OK for a quick demo... 

The another approach for running TL off the CD on win32 was already done
on TL7. Perhaps Fabrice can show us xemacs running from the CD, but for
average user such miracle could be too heavy.

The above are only examples what we can do with TL.
Just to consider.

Ps. I think that dvips on TL should be configured to output to a file
by default. Having "o |lpr" in config.ps always gives a problem on win32.
As most users want to preview .ps files (gsviev, gv), or convert it
to pdf with pstopdf, or use dvips in batch mode (tex4ht, etc., etc.),
or...

It just works. Run TeXLive.exe and chose 'Run TeX off cdrom' like with
TL7.

I hope the CD/DVD .iso image files will be updated nightly from now on
at ftp://www.tug.org/texlive/Images

I am now very interested in reports of wrong behaviour of the Unix/Linux

    OK. I will remove that /source/ and add some extra files to the top
    level

I fear that /source/ is needed.  Well, at least it would be simpler if
it was included.  If it's not included, then we have to keep the exact
sources used around for three years (at least), and add another README
about where to get the sources electronically or on CD -- and that would
be different for the cd's distributed by Dante vs. TUG, since obviously
no one group can be responsible for distributing "source" cd's to everyone.
Complications ...

It does seem perverse, though, to make a 3 disk set, to have to put
the source on all of them. the README could say "this CD is intended to
be distributed alongside the main TeX Live CD/DVD, which contain the
full sources". this demo CD is a snapshot derived from the main CD, not
a product in its own right

For those of you watching the TeX Live perforce repository, the script
in //depot/Master/Tools/MakeImages.sh is what I use to create the 3 .iso
images. You can safely run this at home to make your own copies,
assuming you have xsltproc, zip and mkisofs installed. The zip-making
will probably be replaced by calls to Fabrice's Perl library shortly, so
you'll need a decent Perl/XML setup too.

all in the cause of lessening the mysteries...

by the way, anyone making packages or changing them should also look at
Fabrice's TPM-munging library in Master/Tools.

    It does seem perverse, though, to make a 3 disk set, to have to put
    the source on all of them. 

It does, doesn't it?  But it seems to me that the demo cd is a "product"
in its own right, as far as distribution goes.  I mean, someone could
decide to only copy/redistribute that cd.

If there was only one tar file or iso image, it would be a different
story.  Or if you had to have them all in order for the software to
work, it would again be a different story.  But we are making three
clearly separated distributions.  Each can be installed and used
separately from the others.

I really think we should put the source on it.  If we don't,
complications will ensue.

    Using *demo* (I'd suggest *lite* vs. *full*) 

I guess since the only difference is tex-langcjk, that would be ok --
except I find `lite' to be an ugly marketing-speak non-word :).  Nothing
else comes to mind, though.

So then we'd have lite (cd), full (dvd), and inst (cd).

in which case *all* the package owners would complain, as I have omitted
the texmf/source tree.

we have two choices:

 a) put back source and texmf/source, and find another 50-100 mbytes of
packages to remove in addition to lang-cjk

 b) somehow make the demo CD *not* redistributable under its own right

a) is better, but who would like to choose which packages to remove?

     a) put back source and texmf/source, and find another 50-100 mbytes of
    packages to remove in addition to lang-cjk

Is that compressed or uncompressed?  The sources can/should be
compressed, I think.  It would be a shame to have to remove more real
packages for this.

     b) somehow make the demo CD *not* redistributable under its own right

That's not a choice, as far as I can see.  The software is freely
redistributable, we can't alter that (and don't want to).


The other choice b) is to deal with the complications, by making a
"written offer good for at least three years", etc., etc.  Actually, I
don't know what all the non-gpl conditions are to omit source, but I
hope/assume they're similar.  LPPL is.

I guess that since in practice it's highly unlikely there will be
thousands of requests for a physical copy of the source (more likely
one, at most :), and since the installable cd satisfies the requirement,
we could just write a README.DEMO-SOURCE that says TUG will make the
offer.  That file should only be included on the demo cd.

If we go this route, I can write such a file, but I'll need information
about where to check it in and what files to change so that it only ends
up on the demo cd.

compressing the source tree after installing would be possible, I guess.

c) put the downloadable sources somewhere on the net (and update
   the READMEs to point to the URL) and include a written offer
   (by TUG and DANTE) according to GPL 3b. 
   AFAIK knoppix does it this way and has nearly no requests

On the net is no problem, since they will be available from ctan (or at
least tug.org, if we update the versions on ctan after building the
final images, which hopefully we won't :).

However, we also have to offer to do it on a physical medium.  But I
don't think this is a problem either.

   AFAIK knoppix does it this way and has nearly no requests

Right.  So if compressing the sources doesn't make it all fit, I guess
we'll do this.

No! We are talking about only /source/source.tar.bz2 not /texmf/source/
source.tar.bz2 if not needed on demo|lite|small CD. If needed
to recompile binaries, everybody can take it from DVD or inst-CD

That's exactly the point under discussion.

In my view, all the sources need to either be distributed or an explicit
offer made for each distribution we make.  Saying "they're on this other
cd" isn't good enough, because they could be distributed separately.

As Fabrice just pointed out in private email, any changes for Windows
and Mac binaries need to be included as well.  Fabrice is dealing with
the Windows changes.  Not sure if the Mac changes are already there.

Fabrice, I know that for most users your xemtex idea would be perfect.
But why not giving people some alternatives, which not need to be 
covered by TeXLive.exe or TeXSetup.exe, just mentioned in the 
documentation?
Many users already have their belowed text editor on windows, even
working in dos/cmd box (Hans, Jacko and many other ;-) Many people
prefer using gvim, which has already some good support for TeX programs.
So after many discussions, mails and (many!) installations on very 
strange different windows versions, just my 5 eurocents in that matter.
I've checked several times on linux and windows that for a *quick*
demo I do not need even local texmf tree.

problem fixed, back at ftp://www.tug.org/texlive/Images/

the "demo" CD weighs in at 675 Mbytes, with source put back and
texmf/source compressed (which will stop the install from working....)

anyone for mandating a 700 mbyte CD?

By the way, I am rapidly running out of time here for TeXLive.
Can I leave this issue of how to structure the demo CD with someone
else? Who will volunteer to take it over, and maintain the script
which generates the images?

I am also stuck with the source tree, because source.development does
not compile (eomega nonsense, for a start). Can someone else
have a go at this, and propose how we can get most (maybe all) of
source.development into a useable state? My inclination is to live
dangerously, as usual, and put it all in if in doubt.

Sorry if I seem to be not doing much - if you look closely at my
.signature, you'll see I have just started work on a new service here,
which has to be set up at very short notice, and I am overwhelmed.

I don' understand. Have a look at the current TeXSetup version: you can
install TeX the usual way. You get all the program. Then add your TeX
editor and configure it.

Only if you check the box on the first page, you will get xemacs
preconfigured (plus a bunch of tools). But you are by no mean obliged
to do so.

no problem from the production side. Last year I asked for prices
and possible problems with sizes >650 (700, 750, ...). The answer
was, absolutely no problems as long as you stay with standards
(700Mb), they will put anything on a CD you come up with (~900).
But you will loose customers, because "normal" drives (not too old)
will read <=750, only very new ones more. Prices for the number of
CDs we are producing (>5.000) are the same.

I am still not clear then - 700 Mbytes is OK?

Dear TeXLive folks, will some of you attend EuroTeX2003 in Brest?
If so: see you on Tuesday! How about meeting there one evening, 
after talks, and discuss what we can do (and let Sebastian have

I have a life already. Sadly, next week it is going to spent in Oxford,
not Brest.

spend next Tuesday evening test the current images and seeing why
source.development does not compile, is my advice

Where does it fail to compile ? I shall try it. What from
source.development do you want to push onto source ? 

And I'll be in Brest starting from Tuesday. See you soon, Kaja ;-)

everything, if I can. 

if you can incorporate what you have to make as good a

Same for me. I won't be at Brest, but I might well meet some people which
travel with the EuroTeX bus from the east side through Hannover on Sunday.

I tried compiling source.development on solaris8 and found 
two problems so far; I was able to fix the first.

- in eomega compilation failed with:
  ! Change file entry did not match (file ./eomegadir/omega.ch2, l.11).

  (Pardon me, but I think I spotted something wrong..)

the patterns in omega.ch2 were ok, except they had ^M in line
endings. I edited the file, submitted to perforce and recompiled;
hopefully eomega is fine now.

- massive errors while trying to compile in ttf2pk/ttflib.c:
  gcc -c -g -O2  -DHAVE_LIBM=1  ttflib.c
  ttflib.c:18:22: freetype.h: No such file or directory
  ttflib.c:25:28: extend/ftxpost.h: No such file or directory
  ttflib.c:26:28: extend/ftxopen.h: No such file or directory
  ...
It seems that the library path is not set properly (it should
include ../../libs/libttf/, which has freetype.h). config.log
is not illuminating in this respect. Help?

Hi developers,

I noticed that there's documentation for almost all packages
on the CD, but not for mine. Is this, because I'm not uploading
any to the CTAN servers? I haven't done so, because everybody
can easily create the pdf's himself, and because this makes
downloading the package a lot faster and cheaper (for dial-up
connections). I don't want my packages to end up like the KOMA
directory, with several megabytes of redundant documentation. :->

Should I upload documentation files to CTAN to have them
included on the CD?

I confirm: I have a script that removes those infamous ^M for a list of
extensions among which .hc, but I overlooked .ch<something>. Fixed.

I may have fixed this and broken lots of other things while uploading a
bunch of updates to both source/ and source.development/ . Another
round?

the fix helped with the change file,  but another problem has surfaced:

  (./eomegadir/omega.ch2)
  [...]
  Done.
  1295 strings written to string pool file.
  (No errors were found.)
  srcdir=. /bin/sh ./web2c/convert eomega

Subject: [tex-live] opinion requested about Perl
Message-ID: <4r2hmdpl.fsf@esemetz.ese-metz.fr>


There are various Perl scripts in the TeXLive distribution, and Perl is
not something found very often on Windows machines. As far as possible,
I would like to provide some standalone distribution, not relying on the
installation of external tools. As long as Perl is concerned, I have 2
options:
- compile the scripts with ActiveState Perl compiler into .exe files,
this proved to be safe and was used on TL7 (however the compiler is
US$195 by itself, thanks to Hans Hagen for providing access to it but I
need to upgrade it)
- put some Perl version in the distribution, which is quite easy, since
I compiled regular Perl 5.8.0 + a bunch of goodies (win32 support, XML,
Tk, etc). The package is quite large: 40Mb and I don't know of any easy
way to limit it to what is required by the Perl scripts from TeXLive.

Any idea on what is the most convenient solution ?

when I put up a package, I try to run the documentation files to .dvi;
that is, if I can work out which the documentation files are by
automated means (I tend not to have time to read the notes unless I am
feeling exceptionally patient).

tell me which your packages are, and I'll trace the build through to see
why you have no docs.

That's true, even if the perl58.dll file is shared across all of
them. They are between 200k and more than 1Mb each (and they  are
compressed).

The deal is :

Perl/win32 on TeXLive:
- you can upgrade the scripts
- you can't run them out of the Live cd (texexec and co)
- you have the real Perl (say for new scripts)

Perlapp compiled exe on the cdrom:
- you can run any program out of the Live cd
- it is reliable (ie: it won't complain for unforeseen reason)
- you can't upgrade the scripts by yourself
- you can't add new scripts.

Plus the 'ideological' reason : I have always been more confident in
using the standard sources.

Do you think we can include either the fix to the gcc33 problem or the
mminstance-1.21 which fixes this problem into TeXlive? From a quick look
through the files I seems that the structure of mminstance has changed
a bit with the versions (1.19: Adapt to newer Automake and LCDF and
Efont libraries.)

Can you sent me the patches from the old mminstance to the TeXlive
version?

I would like to have a compile-able TeXlive again for gcc-33 (which is
what I am using here, debian sid).

Best wishes

I will upgrade to 1.21 and also add lcdf tools (by Eddie Kohler). But
I'm leaving for EuroTeX in a few hours. More on this later. In the mean
time, apply the fixes that help you to compile (Anyone: do I need to install
gcc33 to make tests ?)

This is really good news! Great. The installation of otf fonts with the
lcdf fonts was really easy and quick. And soon you got Minion and
friends in otf format working with TeX...

Hmm, I inquired to the EuroTeX people about:
* bus
* accomodation
* registration
etc and didn't get ONE answer in 4 weeks. Great thanks. Originally I
planned to go there too.

2) I changed the text and formatting of the new README.MAC a little,

3) I notice there is a file LISEZMOI-MAC-OSX.  It is not ending up in

   instead of proliferating top-level files?

Subject: [tex-live] top-level README files
Message-ID: <200306240101.h5O11kG18827@tug.org>

I messed around with some other of the top-level files:

- LICENSE.TL8: renamed to LICENSE.TL, and added a paragraph stating that
to the best of our knowledge, all the software included is free (libre).
I think this is true :).

- README.EN: I made some substantial revisions.  For one thing, I
dropped all the assorted random version numbers.  For another, I
attempted to describe our three-distribution scheme this year, mentioned
the install-dvd.sh script, etc.  Sebastian (and anyone else), please
read through it to make sure I didn't say anything wrong.

Since I am a stupid monolingual American :), I did not attempt to edit
any of the other README.* files.  Can whoever is responsible for them
please update them so as not to call this `TeX Live 8', etc.?


- Questions:

1) I think we have to include some file in each image indicating what
it is.  In the new README.EN, I made up the convention of 00<type>.TL, thus:
00INST.TL
00LIVE.TL
00DEMO.TL

I'm open to a better convention.  Unless there are objections, I'll
create these new top-level files (they won't say much) and see if I can
adjust MakeImages.sh to do the right thing.


2) If we're going to name the demo cd something other than demo, now is
   the time to decide.  I am not crazy about the name `demo', but I fear
   I am even less enthralled by `lite'.  Maybe `mini'?  I don't have any
   good ideas.
   
   Staszek, I'm not sure that we'll be able to maintain the distinction
   that demo = full - cjk only, depending on the outcome of this perl stuff.


3) Do we really need the README.EURO file?  Can't we just say this in
   the main `live' documentation?  Seems to me similar random comments
   could be made about many packages.
   
   However, if the consensus is that we absolutely have to bother new
   installers with the fact that you have to buy the Euro font from
   Adobe to use europs, I'd rather add it to README.EN than have another
   top-level file.

Thanks,

so ideally the setup for the demo CD is different :-}

I feel agnostic. Mildly prefer the "perl on CD option"

FYI, I just renamed
  install-cd.sh  -> install-compr.sh
  install-dvd.sh -> install-live.sh
(I'm also updating README.EN, MakeImages.sh, etc.).

So if you have any automatic scripts that run them, they'll need to
change.  Sorry about that.

It was just too confusing to rename install-dvd.sh to install-cd.sh for
the demo cd.

In fact, with Seb's ok, I'm also changing things so that the correct
install script ends up in each distribution as install-tl.sh.  That way
there's only one name for users to contend with.

As for install-pkg-cd.sh, which is for installing packages from the
compressed (inst) distribution, Seb says it doesn't work yet.  If anyone
has time to work on it, that would be great.  Updating the documentation
is going to keep me busy for quite a while yet.

I don't want to break things now, but shouldn't some packages be split
along different lines. As an example, take fonts and .fd files. Shouldnt
.fd files belong to the font package ? When typesetting French, you need
to take guillemets out of some font, and we may need ot4cmr.fd + polish
font, but ot4cmr.fd belongs to platex, where it should probably belong
to some font , and this font being required by platex. There are
probably other examples.

FYI, I removed usergrps/TUG from the depot, since I saw no point in
propagating a stale version of some of the TUG web site, it would be
very painful to keep up to date, and it wouldn't look right anyway.

If others agree with this reasoning, we could remove the rest of
usergrps as well (the only others there are cstug, gtf, ntg) and save

How about replacing it with file that has a pointer to the TUG Web
site page that points to other user groups; that way, recipients of
the CD-ROM will still be able to find them, and we have a better
chance of the information being up-to-date.

As any Lisp programmer knows, pointers to pointers are often more
useful than pointers to data, since they facilitate compaction and
rearrangement.

The PDP-10 (on which TeX was developed) had a hardware instruction to
follow a pointer chain in one step.

In fact the content of this file
1) is already in the texlive documentation. It was important last year 
to have a specific MacOSX doc at top level because tl7 provided a macos 
support for the first time. I think it could be removed this year, 
provided the notes about frontends and editors are reported in readme.fr

2) is not up to date. With macosX 10.1, sh was emulated by zsh and was 
unable to execute correctly the installation script (why?). With macOSX 
10.2, sh is emulated by bash, and the standard unix install process is 
usable provided one use sudo (the root account is not activated on 
macosX).
I suppose (no way to test it all my computers use 10.2) that 
README-MAC-OSX and LISEZMOI-MAC-OSX are still usable for 10.1, but not 
for 10.2

Dear folks,

I'm bombarded by a spam from known addressees, like Art Ogawa,
Graham Williams, etc., as well as receiving so many mail delivery
rejections that I'm sending something wrong from OutlookExpress
(I've never used such bete! Moreover I do not use windows for sending
or receiving mails at all!). Is that only my case?

I would say that someone you know, or someone who has your email 
address, has a virus and has spoofed your email address. I read 
recently that a virus (can't remember its name, there are so many) uses 
Outlook to send spam messages around to other recipients in that 
address book.

This has happened to me before on three occasions. I too do not use 
Windows for email, and have never used Outlook or Outlook Express.

I looked at the header, traced the origin to a known IP address and 
advised the sys admin of system abuse. They soon stopped.

Regards
Alan

Some viruses/spammers fake the sender adress. So, it is more then likely
that Art Ogawa etc. did not send these mails to you.

On the other hand, if someone uses your adress as sender, then you'll
get all the bounces.

That's how email works these days :-(

I just try an installation on mac OSX with 
beta-texlive2003-inst-20030627.iso

I see that binaries are *not* installed. More, I try to install two 
sets of binaries (macosx darwin and i386-linux) : I got linux binaries 
correctly installed, but not, macosx binaries...

Could somebody try to install macosx bins (powerpc-darwin6.3) on any 
platform : I suspect something wrong in install-tl.sh.

Staszek Wawrykiewicz <staw@gust.org.pl> asks on Sun, 29 Jun 2003
06:00:57 +0200 (CEST) about spam that arrives with legitimate
addresses of list members in the From: line.

This has been a growing problem over the last couple of years:
spammers are using addresses from their pool of destinations in 
the From: line, instead of putting bogus addresses there.  The only
line in the headers that is reliable is the first Received: line;
everything else can be forged.

All that you can do is learn to recognize the trash from legitimate
mail, and carry on, sigh...

Lots of people are working on the spam problem, and partial solutions
will gradually be put in place.

Two problems when installing texlive-inst-20030627 on macosX

1 - No binaries were installed (platformrecognition is ok). I fixed it 
by copying the image in a directory and moving file names like

tpm/binary/bin-*-powerpc-darwin6.3.zip

to

tpm/binary/bin-*-powerpc-darwin63.zip  (6.3 -> 63)

Note that it should *not* be macosX specific : all binaries sets whith 
period in their names should be concerned 
(bin-amstex-powerpc-aix4.3.3.0.zip eg).

Of course it should probably be better to fix it at install script 
level.

2 - With this fix the installation is ok excepted that pdf(e)tex 
formats are not generated. In fact pdftex/pdfetex aren't up to date and 
the pool files does not match. I fixed it by replacing these binaries 
by most recent versions stolen to a recent gerben's tetex distrib and 
running fmtutil.

I'm not using Outlook or OutlookExpress either. All y email messages go
through XEmacs+Gnus, even if I'm working with Windows. And I'm sur I get
as many spam messages as you do. There is actually a virus floating
around and faking adresses.

Just to be clear on this point in case someone would wonder about who on
this list could use Windows ;-)

Many thanks for all explanations. Live is hard and full of traps...
I do not think I feel better having know that's not only my case.
We can finish that thread. Otherwise... it became
something like spam, OK?  ;-)

Hi Michel,

    provided the notes about frontends and editors are reported in readme.fr

I had incorporated the README-MAC-OSX information into README.MAC.

I also just changed README.MAC to more clearly distinguish the 10.2/10.1
cases, based on what you said.

If all this info is in the documentation as well, then I agree we should
just remove it so we only have to maintain it in one place.  That's my
goal for this week, to review the main documentation.

Meanwhile, can you (or anyone) please review the current README.MAC and
fix anything that needs fixing, or at least tell me if anything's wrong?
I don't use Macs myself.

Thanks,
karl
