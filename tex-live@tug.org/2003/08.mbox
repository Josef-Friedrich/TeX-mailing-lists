When recompiling I have somehow different info files:
dir, dvips, info-stnd.info, info.info, kpathsea.info, web2c.info-1
Also man files differ. Should I update the depot?

Investigating why resulting .map files after full installation are
different from those on Master I've corrected tpm/lists for cjk
and context packages (btw removed redundant 
texmf/dvips/config/context.map). See change #3505
Something left to do: uag.map references to never existent on TL (and

I have promoted source.development to source,  remade the source.tar.bz2
file, and am remaking the CD images as I speak.

Could anyone who "owns" a particular platform get a clean source tree
and compile, please? submit the binaries back to Perforce, or to me

If you  have problems, fix in source.development again, and let everyone
know.

i386-linux binaries seems plausible, works even on old RH6.2 (including 
xdvi).
The only question: there are 
232 binaries for i386-linux, 
240 for alpha-linux 
233 for i386-freebsd5.0
I compiled well on sparc64-linux also 240, but after testing I lost
the connection so will upload binaries later after waking up the machine 
:(

Hmm, I made a compile from clean source (freshly fetched) and got these
240 files, could someone check what is the `right' or expected number of
files?

I think there is a strange issue here...

I made an installation yesterday with the last inst image.

mbova% /usr/TeX/bin/powerpc-darwin6.3/pdftex --version
pdfTeX (Web2C 7.4.5) 3.14159-1.10a
kpathsea version 3.4.5

No format files, of course...

I compiled and submitted to Perforce binaries for Solaris 7 and Irix 6.5.

Btw, several people recommended (off the list) to stay with 
Solaris 7 for the time being. Thanks for the feedback!

My compilation of binary sets for Solaris 7 and Irix 6.5
produced 240 files each too. I am enclosing the list of files.

TL does not have the share directory due to limitations of the iso
filesystem. I have looked how deep the structure below texmf is and here
are the "winners":

7 subdirectories:
source/latex/kuvio/doc-src/macros/carrot/misc/biblio.cd

source/latex/marvosym/mac/oztex/dvips/inputs/fmv.map
source/latex/marvosym/mac/oztex/tex-font/misc/fmvr8x.tfm

8 subdirectories:
source/latex/kuvio/doc-src/macros/carrot/sfss/fs/bbold.fs
source/latex/kuvio/doc-src/macros/carrot/sfss/fs/cm.fs
source/latex/kuvio/doc-src/macros/carrot/sfss/fs/rsfs.fs
source/latex/kuvio/doc-src/macros/carrot/sfss/fs/bbm.fs
source/latex/kuvio/doc-src/macros/carrot/sfss/fs/arrsy.fs

I don't know about the exact limitations of the iso filesystem, but maybe,
a small cleanup would allow us to
  mv texmf share/texmf

Submited sparc64-linux binaries, 240 files as for Kaja and Norbert.
i386-linux set by SPQR has missing links:
inieomega, inipdfetex, olatex, pdfelatex, vireomega, virpdfetex,

I've just promoted the version number of pdfTeX to 1.11a proper.
The only change from the version is source is the version number,
so only the binaries for pdfTeX and pdfeTeX have to be compiled
again (when Sebastian has integrated the sources again). 

I'll do an official release announcement on Monday.

The problem is that texmf/pdftex is not in the standard TEXINPUTS
path. mptopdf.pl calls
  pdfetex -progname=context
and so should fmtutil do.

In the past, this bug was hidden by the fact that in -ini mode, pdf*tex
did not read pdftex.cfg. But, it is of course a problem to use different
progname settings for the normal run and the -ini run, since memory
settings could be different.

Change #3533 (for source.development) fixes this. Now, we have:

  $ fmtutil --byfmt mptopdf
  running `pdfetex -ini   -jobname=mptopdf -progname=context mptopdf.tex' ...
  ...
  fmtutil: /software/oss/Text/teTeX-2.0/share/texmf/web2c/mptopdf.efmt installed.

Message-ID: <200308031359.h73DxbB25954@f7.net>

    I am missing "htlatex" in "bin/i386-linux". Other directories

I removed the htlatex binary (and others) from the tpm file a couple
weeks ago (and sent mail to the list), because in fact the binary is not
getting created by a build any more.  (Personally, losing this
executable names seems like a fairly severe backward incompatibility to
me that will cause untold annoyance...)  The architectures you list as
having it must not have had clean rebuilds yet.

I also removed {ini,vir}[e]{blah,blah} because they weren't getting
created either, and Sebastian said he had intentionally dumped them.

I hope I didn't screw anything up.  I just removed the files from the
tpm's that the build process was complaining didn't exist.

    2. Correct address?

tex-live@tug.org is the "best" address, but texlive@tug.org will work too.
rahtz@tug.org -- well, I was changing things to use the list address to
(in a small way) lessen the burden on Sebastian.  As Staszek said, the
non-English documentation has not been updated yet.

Well, one point that I have not mentioned earlier: while teTeX uses that
share subdirectory by default, it is not mandatory. If you put your texmf
tarball into $prefix/texmf, the sources will detect and use that if you
specify the correct prefix:
  $ mkdir -p /tmp/foo/texmf
  $ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/foo  2>&1 | grep texmf
  checking where the main texmf tree is located... ${prefix}/texmf
  checking where the main texmf tree is located... ${prefix}/texmf
  ...

So, if Gerben sets up his teTeX package that way, this will be compatible
with TeX Live then...

The real file is <CTAN:macros/latex/required/psnfss/freenfss.zip>,
which should be mirrored in the CTAN directory fonts/psfonts.
This directory is also known as font/metrics.

Yes, I do intend to improve the Charter metrics,

Huh?

These are the real Type1 fonts; that's why they reside in the
CTAN direcrory fonts/.  They are in no way TeX-specific.

I'm sorry; this should have been deleted already.
I will soon take care of it soon.

Indeed, I consider this as obsolete and not needed.
I dont' know who made the "corelpack", but it is definitely not my

Yes, here are the TeX-specific support files.

The physical fonts and the TeX-specific metrics, VFs, map files etc. 
are two different things.  It's up to the TL team to put *both* on 
the CD.

I don't quite understand your suggestions.  The only correction
to be made are the kerning pairs (not only L-quoteright !), but 
that may raise compatibility problems, because the line and page
breaks of existing documents may change.  

The PSNFSS bundle relies on many different fonts, even on the CM 
fonts.  That's why it is not a good idea to make one single bundle, 
which comprises both the physical fonts _and_ the support files.
I think that the installation instructions of the PSNFSS bundle
are sufficiently clear, as far as the required fonts are concerned.

I got everything from Karl before going to Hawai'i, it's in the

Here is my view of where we are

1) install programs. more or less OK, though Staszek wants a change to
the demo <R> setup

2) binaries. 

the following platforms are "live", in that people
are compiling them regularly

 alpha-linux 
 i386-freebsd5.0
 i386-linux
 sparc-solaris2.7
 sparc64-linux
 mips-irix6.5

win32 and macosx need Fabrice and Gerben to do their stuff.

the following look a bit orphaned:

 alphaev5-osf4.0d
 i386-openbsd3.0
 i386-solaris2.8
 powerpc-aix4.3.3.0

who is able to compile on those?

3) documentation. waiting for translations, and fixes for MacOSX

4) texmf tree. seems to be stable, apart from waiting fixes for lm

Is there still interest in this? The binaries for pdfTeX had been

to be honest, its easier to put new binaries up than remove all
references to it in scripts and documentation... (if you can rebuild
easily, that is)

I have resubmitted all the binaries, just to confuse you. they are now
set to only store the latest revision of each file, not a history. no
sense in wasting space :-}

there are also a set of symbolic links in the bin directory, so you can
refer to i386-freebsd with no version if you prefer

So I've changed MakeImages.sh, since we have also another layout
of Master/bin/ and building "demo" failed here (#3571).
I also added copying tex-xemtex.tmp to collection/ for Fabrice.

Yes, please! I don't know how to do that ;-)
In short: "demo" cd contains already texmf-var/web2c with good updmap.cfg
(it was made while preparing the .iso image), but <R> setup builds
texmf-var from scratch and copies updmap.cfg from the main texmf/
and tries to rebuild map files with some warnings (some map files
are missing).
I'd suggest just to make copy ready made texmf-var/ from the cd.

As for new binaries:
i386-solaris2.8 - missing:
info
infokey
install-info
makeinfo
texi2dvi
texindex

Sebastian, please remake lists/ for binaries, as ht* scripts and
some links are still missing so cannot be found on the cds.

Many thanks,

Dear translators -- I made a few small changes to
Build/cdbuild/tldocsource/english/live.tex to reflect some of the recent
changes (latin modern, bin links, demo dist inclusions).  Also
incorporated some changes from Gerben in the MacOSX section (thanks, Gerben).

I regenerated the html and pdf files, they're available in
http://tug.org/~karl/tldoc/.  Any corrections/suggestions are welcome,
of course.

Here are the diffs from the previous version, in case they help.

Sebastian,

Something strange, I have here on both client depots:
Master/bin/i386-freebsd5.0/ containg only 1 file mfw which wasn't deleted
when syncing. mfw has proper attributes -r-xr-xr-x. As you can expect,
making demo iso get failed because of different NNNY... etc.
in MakeImages.sh.
Should I zap i386-freebsd5.0 or keep it for somebody will remake
binaries for that platform?

"demo" cd works well, thanks for making changes. <R> setup can
even work for the user without root privileges. He has only
to change directories in <D> menu.
And... for many the "demo" cd can serve for installing stuff
(as it was expected ;-))

Binaries: not all were copied to the cd:
altpdfelatex, eomega, ht 
and links: 
inieomega, inipdftex, inipdfetex,
olatex, pdfelatex, vireomega, virpdfetex

install-pkg.sh works OK for collections and packages.

Has anybody more comments concerning the current layout of the CDs?
Thanks,

Thanks. I'm trying to switch to the translation into Polish. :-)
As reference of all changes I've submited last (?) version of 
live.tex for TL7 (#3588):
Build/cdbuild/tldocsouce/english/live-tl7.tex.

Dear All,

I am facing problem while processing the \special{color push}\special{color 
pop} command through dvips. It is showing me an error "You've mistakenly 
made a global color change to rgb 0 0 1 within nested color", but the same 
macro is working fine when I am using dvipsone driver of Y&Y TeX.

Please suggest.

With best regards,
Sanjay

I've finally changed 247 tpm files #3589 (some more later)
including corrections to <TPM:Title> and/or <TPM:Description>
fields.
What was done:
1. filling up empty Title and/or Description
2. changing "no caption" or "XYZ package" (which says nothing) 
   to something more descriptive.

All those changes were checked against the current Catalogue so will
be also sent to Graham. I have always in mind as good as possible
(and complete!) information about packages for Catalogue-TL-CTAN.

To do: packages begining with k-o (on work) and r-z (?, any help needed)

Sebastian,

I *think* we still have a alpha-osf box around here.  I will ask
out IT group if it is still in comission and if I could use it for
compiling TeX Live binaries.

sounds ok to me, but why not also implement $ENGINE as variable to be set 
by the engine (one never knows when this will come in handy)

another related problem:

-  pdftex differs from dvips which is why the texmf/pdftex path cannot go
-  pdftex.cfg is now common for all macropackages, while i would like a 
package dependent one

with regards to the cfg file: context has one format that deals with dvi 
and pdf output; therefore i don't like the idea that pdf output is 
hardcoded in the cfg file; (ok, i can handle it at the macro level)

since pdftex is 100% dvi compatible, why is there still latex/pdflatex, 
tex/pdftex, etc ; we could have much less formats (and generation) when the 
relevant macro packages should simply set \pdfoutput=1 which they have to 
do anyway; users have to load pdf specific functionality and that is the 
moment the macro package can set the flag; removing the dupplication would 
also make it more easy to explain to users what is going on.

currently there is no control from within the macro package where files are 
looked for, apart from hard coded paths . .. and combinations; maybe the 
core file handler can be extended so that we can say things like

   \input {$texmf-local,$texmf}/somefile

or \input [::texmf-local,::texmf]/somefile if we want to get rid of 
potential clashes with catcodes

Hello,

1) I'm a director of study programs at the university of Tunis.

2) We are planning to generalise the use of new educational technologies by
our teachers and students in master degrees (more than 300 persons will be
present).

3) In this context, we will organise this year different schools (Winter,
Spring, Summer schools)

4) In this context, would you please send me a copy of the CD TexLive.

5) Also, we sollicitate TUG to participate with us in the definition of
these schools and their implementation.

Best regards

Perhaps you would like to join TUG (or another user group) and receive a

(See http://tug.org/usergroups.html for a list of other user groups.)

In any case, for your purposes, we'll be happy to send you a CD gratis,
to help your effort.  Robin, could you please get one on its way to Tunisia?

    5) Also, we sollicitate TUG to participate with us in the definition of
    these schools and their implementation.

We'd be happy to (other user groups might also be interested) as much as
we are able ... But I'm not sure from your letter what the relationship
is between your project and TeX.  Are more details available somewhere?
How can we help?

All the best,
Karl (TUG president)

These help dvipdfm for text extraction / searching in pdf.

The names are funny (in fact most bytes of the filename come from some
md5sum of the encoding file itself), because I did not know any better
names. I have extracted the encoding from the pfb files of the bsr fonts
and grouped fonts with identical encoding together.

I have taken the encoding of the pfb file which is the same as Knuth's
design.

For non-text fonts, it does not really matter...

Sebastian does not only want to provide a useful TeX system, but he also
wants to provide a collection of free software which gives some minimum
level of freedom to the users. The utopia fonts must not be changed,
so you can't fix a bug in it or add some accents that you need.

Sure, the "free software" decision means to omit some stuff. On the other
hand, that decision has helped the whole license issue in the TeX world
a lot.

In fact you can change anything you want in utpopia by making a new 
font and using it with utopia through a virtual font mechanism. I 
already did it in order to complete a full T1 encoding (eng, dotlessj

What is sure is that to have plenty of licence designs for texlive 
stuff is painful.

But to have only one for such different things that

?

Does on of you have an idea? Thanks a lot for any hint on this!

One more question: How can I trace opened groups/closed groups, because
I get:
### simple group (level 1) entered at line 23 ({)
### bottom level 
and have NO idea why. It *may* be connected with the above error.

Hi Norbert,

Yes.  You have:

Do not redefine \egroup :).  That's defined in plain.tex as an implicit
begingroup character.

    One more question: How can I trace opened groups/closed groups, because

I tried \tracingall\tracingonline=0 and running with elatex, which gives
the maximum tracing I know of, but even that does not really describe
the group nesting, as far as I can see.  Too bad.

I just found it out. HOW stupid I am! I generated this from a mysql
table and, yes, the field is called `egroup'. WHat a pity.

Thanks a lot in any case!

Yes yes. This solved all the problems.

Hi Baden,

    Are the beta ISO's available via ftp from tug.org fully functional ?

They're supposed to be!  That's what we're going to send to production
after all.  They're created reasonably simply, with mkisofs.

One potential problem -- the demo ISO is currently 659.5MB, so that may
overflow some cd formats.  And the live ISO is ~1.1GB, so of course it
will only fit on DVD.

    none of them seem to result in a usable CD ... also tried multiple
    different CDROM burning software. 

They get updated every night at 1am Denmark time.  (I'm not sure how
that translates into Australia time. :) Another potential problem -- I
wonder if you're getting hit by this and the file is changing from under
you, resulting in corruption.

    Can someone post an MD5SUM or similar so I can check my ISOs ?

Good idea, we should change the script to do that.  Meanwhile, I've
copied the current inst iso to
ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images/test-20030813inst.iso (so it won't change
when the script runs again 9 hours or so from now), and written the
md5sum to test-20030813inst.iso.md5:
3df1b28d9b56bd77c246269c7db49060  test-20030813inst.iso

Please let us know if problems persist.

What's the benefit of having these *vir* and *ini* symlinks? I mean,

Fine for me. I don't see any point in having them since there is the
-ini option to the tex engines.

well, yes, I agree. Let's sweep them all aside in one go,

Dear TeXLive people,

First of all thank you very much for this very nice package which is 
incredibly useful!

I am about to create a new hard disk image to install on all computers in our 
student lab for the next academic year. Of course we use TeXLive. My question 
is whether there will soon be a new release of TeXLive. If the answer is yes, 
before September, then I'll postpone the making of the image till then.

Thank you very much,

the planned date for TeX Live 2003 is August 25th. Definitely by the end
of the month.

I have zapped references alpha osf and to aix, since there is no sign
of being able to make binaries for them, and Fabrice has uploaded new
Windows binaries, so the only remaining hole is new Mac OSX binaries.

I am accordingly remaking the .iso files with a prefix of "rc" instead
of "beta"

Quick notes on the current iso images (Monday afternoon)
"demo" and "inst" works well for Linux.
Only for "inst" and recommended or full setup:
... lists/lcdftypetools is misssing
(it is referenced in tex-fontbin.vlist)

and (full setup):
Do postinstall setup jobs
install-tl.sh: line 321:/usr/TeX/texmf-var/dvips/config/config.ps
no such file or directory

but good config.ps is already here.

Full setup doesn't install:
info/info* and texinfo* files
man/man1/ams* cont* eplain.1 info.1 install-info.1 latex.1 makeinfo.1
rubibtex.1 rumakeindex.1 slitex.1 texexe.1 texi* texutil.1

Those files _are_ on inst-cd.

---
Windows:
1. pool files doesn't match (except for mf and mpost)
2. "demo" cd doesn't contain texmf/ispell/* (in fact .hash.gz
   files are used (needed?) only in Windows; I've slightly changed 
   MakeImages.sh #3623)
3. some more installation errors (log files sent to Fabrice).

Again quick notes after changes from 19 Aug.

Still cannot catch why full scheme doesn't install some files
from "inst" CD. They are available however on the CD.
Eg. info/30 files installed vs. 51 oncd
man/man1/140 vs. 162
bin/i386-linux/210 vs.244

the same full scheme from "inst" generates all formats, but from
"live"  only tex.fmt (?)

-----
Windows notes after 19.08.2003:
1. "demo" cd, running from the cd started well xemacs, but
   when trying command->latex I have an error:
   Running latex ....
   File not found: .\etex.exe
   latex: can't find the target .\etex.exe  (???)
   
   for tex run that's OK

2. mk4ht.exe (made from mk4ht.pl) is missing.
3. I found that we have now a small perl library, but without perl.exe
   (as I understand, perl58.dll serves only for precompiled .pl scripts).
4. format generation for pdflatex and context failed (comme toujours
   log fichers sont envoy\'e \`a Fabrice).

These are the only up-to-date documentation for pdfTeX and must

texmf/doc/pdftex/ seems like the best place. I could just put

For the moment, there is a binary/bin-pdftex.tpm and a
package/pdftex.tpm . I suspect that part of the (doc) files of the
package should go to the binary tpm.

Could we arrange this so that texmf/doc/pdftex/base holds the
documentation for the binary tpm and that the files for the rest (plain
pdftex, etc.) be put in some sibling node ?

Yes -- if we can decide what goes where. :-)

Currently we have
1. the manual (pdftex/pdftex-*.pdf)
2. the FAQ (pdftex/pdfTeX-FAQ.*)
3. a presentation from Hans about pdfTeX (pdftex/pre-hz.pdf)
4. some examples (numerous files unter pdftex/base/)
5. the syntax (pdftex/base/pdftex-syntax.txt)
6. the README and NEWS (currently missing)
7. the keys inserted (pdftex/base/pdftex-pdfkeys/)

I suggest:
pdftex/base holds 5, 6 and 7
pdftex/manual holds 1
pdftex/examples holds 4
pdftex/misc holds 2 and 3

pdftex/base goes into binary/bin-pdftex.tpm; the rest into
package/pdftex.tpm

This is due to a bug I have introduced in irun.exe . I have uploaded a
new set of fixed binaries. I urge people to test installation and run
things like pdflatex.exe in various (win32) environments.

There is one problem with eomega : the unix version is 1.23, whereas
Giuseppe would like us to distribute the 1.15 version. I have fixed the
source tree but I fear that it is too late.

Ok, I can fix that but my runht.exe provides a couple of other
interesting options ;-)

All the files seems to be available at least on the latest demo image.

Because of first error.

this is now fixed, so far as I can see. I have also made quite an
important change by putting in a new updmap and texmf.cnf, and changing
the location of map files for pdftex, dvipdfm, pdftex, and ps2pk; this
follows on from the TDS revision. So far as I can tell, this has not
caused any problems.

I am remaking images now

We agreed to complete TeX Live 2003 by August 25th. Coincidentally, I am
leaving on holiday for 10 days on 23rd, so I will have to ask someone
else to make last minute changes on 23rd and 24th.

There are two show-stoppers:

a) we have no uptodate MacOSX binaries; I think only Gerben knows how to
create these? has anyone else tried?

b) the source archive is not in sync with the source tree; the latter no
longer compiles under Linux since Fabrice tidied up (a small eomega
puzzle). so when the source tree is OK again,
//depot/Master/source/source.tar.bz2 must be rebuilt.

It will also be necessary for someone to revise the public web pages to
reflect the new release.

I will keep checking and fixing until the morning of 23rd, but
will be totally out of email contact after that until September 2nd.

Hi all,

If you get me build instructions, I can try to compile on my MacOS X
box here.  I have the Appple Developer tools installed.  If the build
requires Metrowerks, I suppose I could ask TUG to buy me that suite
of tools...

Regards,

Tom

Until now, the binaries have been on darwin6.3, as far as I can see.

1) The other map and enc files from texmf/dvips could be mv'ed, too.
2) And the files from pdftex/config/context could be mv'ed if TEXINPUTS.context
is extended to look at the "new" place for map files, too:
  TEXINPUTS.context = .;$TEXMF/{{pdfetex,pdftex,etex,tex}/{context,plain,generic,},fonts/map/{pdftex,}}//

These ugly search paths can go away next year (if we get the new kpathsea
search paths until then).

3) What about the texmf/etex -> texmf/tex and texmf/pdftex -> texmf/tex
move?

I've built AIX binaries... If you want to install them into TeX Live,
you can grab them from http://www.vsu.ru/~vvv/tl2003-aix.tgz
(i didn't submit them into perforce directly, since they were zapped
from there, and i forgot the directory name to use...)

Hi friends!

Furthermore, there is still utils/mminstance in ESUBDIR after normal

I can build real Mac OS binaries (for Jaguar at least) but not until
Monday since I'm away from my Mac at the moment ... if there's a need
I'll do this on Monday morning Aus time.

I have added enctex to source.development tree. It might be responsible
for this. I'll have a look tomorrow.

mminstance has been merged into lcdf-typetools by Eddie, so some
autoconf stuff needs to be adapted.

I made all images after #3682 (fix Omega tpm file) and it seems that
things goes well with all kind of installations (at least on Linux;
I didn't have time to check Win32, sorry Fabrice, will switch to that 
after some sleep)

I see some things to be done:
1. remaking all binaries from the *current* source (not 
   source.development!!!) to have it finally complete and in sync with
   distributed source.tar.bz2
   a) I can do that for i386-linux and sparc64-linux
   b) MacOSX - which version: 5.5, 6.3 ?
   c) AIX from Vladimir: can we put it again?. If so, I can change
      MakeImages.sh (Vladimir, please remake it from the current "source"
      and upload to Depot/Master/bin/rs6000-aix?.?.? )
   d) b) and c) should be noted in tldoc (Karl?)
2. some more testing for Win32 is urgently needed (as usual ;-)
3. the new strategy with fonts/map is completelly undocumented
   (in fact, I was surprised by such change in the last moment ;-)
4. uhmm... tldoc seems not finished (Win32 section, all those pictures,
   editors, etc.; btw I've just uploaded to support/vim/ the stuff
   for Vim followers, and Gvim for win32 integrated with latexSuite
   can be also considered as an alternative and mentioned in tldoc)
5. all tldoc translations are not yet ready!

As I feel, we can freeze texmf tree, do the above without Sebastian
and bless him for holidays, am I right?

As for Grand Finale and mastering, can we fix that to, say, 
September 6th? 
Volker?

Thanks Vladimir and Gerben!

I am putting in the AIX and MacOSX binaries now, and will update the
relevant scripts. Sorry, Karl, but could you reinstate AIX in the docs?

New ConTeXt release also going in now, probably the last texmf tree
change, unless I feel strong enough to do all the .map fixes

I have put in the AIX and MacOSX stuff, and done the requisite cleaning
up. I strongly suggest that the texmf tree now be left unchanged unless
someone spots a real bad error (I exempt Kaja doing texdoctk, and Karl
doing documentation, from this suggestion)

> I see some things to be done:

that is an optional extra. the changes from the source of a few weeks
are really only Win32 cleanups; and (unfortunately) a change in eomega.
If all the binaries for eomega are remade, the pool file will need
changing too.

Personally, I don't think it's worth doing. too much change of a mistake

at some point you have to call a halt. you cannot go on refining

Sorry to have missed this, but what new strategy is this?
Will users notice?  If so, I should be documenting something :).

I would rather do it earlier.  We have delayed already.  Our users are
very anxious.

Also, it would be helpful for A-W if we have the final image on sep1.
So I'd *really* like to be done by then.  No, it won't be perfect, and
it never will be.

    I would advise sticking to 25th August, but I think you should elect

Under Debian/VMware, I had to rely on --with-system-ncurses, couldn't
build the provided ncurses either. I have never looked at this autoconf

Excellent!

In that case, I suggest we concentrate on updating the documentation and
testing, and not make any more changes except to fix serious bugs; I can
document non-serious bugs if need be, just let me know what they are.

And so, we try to stick to August 25 for the final master.

How does that sound to everyone?  Staszek, can you live with that?
I know more testing time can always be used, but we have to cut it off
somewhere ...

Volker, how long after the final images are ready will it take for
production?  And I wonder, would it make sense to start making the CTAN
images now?  And, are you still ok with making the CTAN-on-CD images
that we need, as we discussed?

Thanks,

you could try to upgrade autoconf (current version: 2.57,

Yes. Nevertheless this is not detected by configure but by make
(which means about 15 minutes too late on this machine). :-(

Sorry to have missed this, but what new strategy is this?
Will users notice?  If so, I should be documenting something :).

I would rather do it earlier.  We have delayed already.  Our users are
very anxious.

Also, it would be helpful for A-W if we have the final image on sep1.
So I'd *really* like to be done by then.  No, it won't be perfect, and
it never will be.

    I would advise sticking to 25th August, but I think you should elect
    Karl as chairperson here, and let him make the decision

As far as I'm concerned, it's up to Fabrice, because everything else is
ready, right?  Fabrice, how is your work going?

Thanks,
k

Ok, the problem is the tex-latex-recommended collection which is not
required itself.

I have added it to collection/texlive.tpm .

If it doesn't go there, TeXSetup.exe might not present it. It tries to build
a tree with the tpm files.

Hi Karl,

The auto* run was done by make when it hit the texinfo directory. Why,
I do not know...

Anyway, I found the problem.  I am using ac 2.5.7 and am 1.7.6.  The
problem is in aclocal.m4, line 1083:

AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE(fcntl.h sys/time.h unistd.h)

Looks like the definition of AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE is screwed up, or
the invocation of it is screwed up.  Are the arguments supposed to be
comma delimited?  If I comment that line out, the automake/autoconf
runs go w/o a hitch.

Enjoying this hot, humid New England weather?  Its steamy down here
in Providence.

Tom

How frustrating.  Perhaps the timestamps were wrong when it was imported
into TL.  That seems to happen often.  Hopefully we don't have to try to
fix this for this year.

    AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE(fcntl.h sys/time.h unistd.h)

I'm afraid that's correct.  The space separators are conventional for
auto*.  The invocation us the same on my system, and it works.  I can't
say why it's failing there :(.

Ah, I can believe it. I lived in Providence (Cranston actually) for a
year, and it was HUMID.  We spent most of the summer in our basement :).

Interestingly enough, If I change that to:

AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE(fcntl.h)
AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE(sys/time.h)
AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE(unistd.h)

then things work.  So it must be an m4 issue, at least with what I
have here...  I will double check to see which m4 was used for the
ac/am builds.

Thanks for the feedback.

I introduced a bug in the irun.exe tool that helps in creating
symlinks. This should be fixed by now.

This tool is able to create a link, for example :

irun ./etex.exe "c:/program files/texlive/bin/win32/latex.exe

will link the target to the program etex.exe in the same directory.
Using relative paths is allowed. Absolute paths are flagged because non
portable. The latex.exe is a modified copy of the irun.exe program itself.

irun texexec.pl "c:/program files/texlive/bin/win32/texexec.exe"

will use kpathsea to retrieve the perl script texexec.pl from the
PERLINPUTS environment variable, then perl will be invoked with the perl
script and any other argument provided.

irun pp4p.jar c:/program files/texlive/bin/win32/ppower4.exe de.tu_darmstadt.sp.pp4.PPower4

will link ppower4.exe to the jar file, and when the link is invoked,
java.exe is run with the jar file as the class path, the entry point
class and any other argument provided.

I am uploading new files and will try to run tests tomorrow.

it is implementing the agreed change to the TDS about .map and .enc
files being under fonts/map, instead of eg dvips/config. But since the
texmf.cnf handles both, no-one should notice any change unless they read
paths.

Message-ID: <200308232251.h7NMpJA23448@tug.org>

As far as the schedule goes, I'd like to suggest that we work along on
the documentation and any bugs tomorrow and Monday.  Then on Tuesday
(the 26th) we'll stop the nightly builds, and do a couple of days of
testing on that (purportedly final) ISO image.

If there are true stoppers, we can rebuild, but I don't think we should
do it for anything less.

Then Volker and A-W can have the final image on, let's say, Thursday the
28th.

Does this sound feasible?  Staszek, Fabrice?  You're the main workers at
this point ...

Thanks,
k

This bundle is meant to work from within xemacs. XEmacs takes care of
setting a few things.

Yes, that sounds good. I'll try to amend the documentation and run a
couple of installations. Unfortunately, I can't download the isos from
home, so I will have to wait on Monday for that. So I'll try to work on
the documentation in the mean time and fix anything I can from Staszek
reports.

I tried that (exactly) and also substituting '"f:" where you have 
""c:/program files" and still get irun complaining about not finding 
texexec.pl on **drive C:** -- it's on drive F: with the rest of the 
texlive tree.

Tried a little with xemacs and there is another problem: (I have Acrobat 
6.0 (not Reader))
1) xemacs tlatex.tex , edit and save file
2) Menu/Command/PDFLatex (on master file) --creates tlatex.pdf
3) edit file some more and save
4) Menu/PDFLatex again:  Fails:  it *opens* (Acrobat) the old tlatex.pdf 
and then cannot write on it.

pdflatex commands from the minibuffer work fine, of course.  it's the 
pdfclose part that is a problem.

Also I note the following possible difficulty:  I've got Active State 
Perl on my system already.  The rc distribution installation will shadow 
it by putting its own perl.exe up front in the path....Or is it planned 
to use only compiled perl modules and include only the perl58(?).dll in 
the final release?

I'm going to reinstall without the xemtex  and just the recommended pkgs...

I have tested it too just right before. Do you have another texlive
installation in c:\program files\texlive ? Or any enviroment variable
pointing to this location (TEXMF*, ...). If your environment is clean,
you should get this report:

C:\tmp>kpsewhich --expand-var $PERLINPUTS --progname=perl
.;{C:\Documents and Settings\popineau\My Documents/texmf,
   !!c:/Source/TeXLive/Master/texmf-var,

I have removed it. These pdfopen and pdfclose could be useful in this
context, but I have to change somewhat the way auctex calls programs.

It will shadow it only when you are using texlive xemacs. It is
difficult to provide the tool to people who don't have it and not to
those who have it or any alternate version. So this option : install a
version that will shadow any other version only when you are using
texlive's editor (ie: xemacs currently).

I do not have privileges to do that on p4 depot but it seems that
iso images are built automatically every night about 1 o'clock.
I've just built them here on my local depot and start testing.

I need 2-3 days for making the Polish translation of tldoc.
FAbrice, will you touch the original live.tex (Win part) ?
What about German, French etc. translations?

Yes I would like to change the windows part to reflect more exactly what
is distributed. I don't know how far I can come with this.

I'm afraid the French translation will stay out of date.

Yes, 01:05 am Denmark time (CEST).  About an hour ago.

    I need 2-3 days for making the Polish translation of tldoc.

Ok, let's try to make the really absolutely final image by Friday at the

Sebastian made it. But i386-freebsd5.0 should be zaped with that mfw.
only i386-freebsd -> i386-freebsd4.8
should be left.

Stange. I have 2 copies of the depot in sync and I don't see 
sparc64-linux/mfw. I compiled it on Aug 4th.

I agree with Volker. And we still do not have Slovak and Russian
versions. Is there any chance?
Since we have some old and new documentation, I left pictures/ 
with all those .gif and .jpg files and only remade tpm and list files.

Karl, live13.html and live14.html are referenced in livese7.html,
live11.html in livese6.html. Why we have live12.html?

Ps. I touched MakeImages.sh -- we doesn't need Tools/ and setupw32/ (now 
empty) on the final product.

Hi Fabrice,

There is no log file in C:\TeXLive\texmf-var\.  Is that a good sign

My mistake, there are log files in

I didn't see anything extremely unusual, but the eomega format did

Well, maybe not "hurry", exactly, but it does seem at least a bit urgent to me.
We promised it to Addison-Wesley.  It would be good to fulfill our
promise -- well, we already missed August 25, but if we can make it happen
next week, that won't be any huge problem, I'm sure.  We all agreed ...

This is the sort of indeterminate delay is worrisome to me.  Is there
anyone else who can be asked to get it done?  Or do you believe it will
get straightened out shortly?

    VS> more harm by unsufficient documentation than by late delivery.

Up to a point, I agree.  Another few days to work on the documentation
is beneficial at the moment.

    Karl, live13.html and live14.html are referenced in livese7.html,
    live11.html in livese6.html. Why we have live12.html?

It appears to be a footnote.  I don't know how tex4ht decides what to
put into what output files.  Personally, I'd rather have it all be one
html file, the whole manual is not that big, but I never looked into it.

Thanks,
karl

Foudn the problem (after being distracted for quite some time):

running `omega -ini  -jobname=omega -progname=omega omega.ini <nul' ...
! eomega.pool doesn't match; otangle me again (or fix the path).
running `eomega -ini  -jobname=eomega -progname=eomega *eomega.ini <nul' ...
This is Omegak, Version 3.141592--1.23.2.2 (Web2c 7.5.2) (INIOMEGA)

Fabrice, I think this is yours...

As Fabrice pointed out eomega should be 1.15-2.1-RC1
I recompiled it and checked on sparc64-linux and i386-linux
and submited to p4 depot.
Martin will do that for i386-solaris
Would you please checking it for other platforms?
Kaja, Norbert, Gerben, ...?

BTW I corrected line ends in source/TeX/utils/t1utils/mkinstalldirs
and rebuilt source.tar.bz2
Hope that's really last change to source/

Many thanks,

But PLEASE do NOT submit a glibc-2.3 binary when all the others are
glibc-2.2. You kill debian woody (and maybe many others too!).

$ ./tex
This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.2)
$ ./eomega 
./eomega: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3' not found (required by ./eomega)

Best wishes
