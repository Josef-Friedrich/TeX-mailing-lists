Subject: [tex-live] Build problem
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0302011958170.21303-100000@gilas>

I just noticed a merge error in texk/web2c/Makefile.in. Please,
get that file again (change #2771). A simple "make" should recreate
texk/web2c/Makefile, then.

I hope that this fixes your problem.

I have just done the following:

cp -a /t/texlive/Build/source.development /build/s.d
chmod -R +w /build/s.d
cd /build/s.d
touch x
./configure; cd TeX/texk/web2c; make; make distclean
find TeX/texk/web2c -newer x

and it displayed TeX/texk/web2c/cwebboot.c. Then, I touched TeX/texk/web2c/cwebboot.c and retried:

rm -rf /build/XX
mkdir /build/XX; cd /build/XX
/t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/configure
cd texk/web2c; make

Then, it worked.

Seems like the timestamp of cwebboot.c is important. Change #2772 touches the file.

Ok,  thanks   to Giuseppe,  I   manage   to compile   an e-Omega  1.23.2
(web2c/win32)  which dumps ConTeXt   and runs  some of  the  Omega  book
examples. I'll upload  the change files in  their  current state to  the
texlive  depot  (source.development    branch). The binaries     will be
available shortly, I have had problems  (firewalls !) to upload files to
ftp.dante.de recently but that's solved by  now (at least from work, not
yet from home).

If there is demand, maybe we can try to work out a 1.15 version too.

Can I ask everyone who can do binaries to prepare a

Done for alpha-linux build on debian/woody. 
Now there are 239 bins/scripts, is this correct?

I don't know exactly why, but it appears that the Omega banner has
changed recently from 1.23.2 to 1.23.2.1 . Check that the omega.pool you
are using is the one resulting from your compilation.

Message-ID: <of5tfj0u.fsf@esemetz.ese-metz.fr>


I have uploaded a packed set of new binaries for win32 (they might even
hold the current e-Omega if anybody is interested in it).

They are available at :

ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/standalone/binaries-latest-win32.zip

To use them, rename your current bin/win32 directory to bin/win32-old, texmf/web2c
to texmf/web2c-old, unzip the archive, rebuild your formats.

I expect that updmap.exe may be the source of problems (not well tested
for the moment).

Reports are welcome,

I uploaded irix 6.5 and solaris 2.7 sets to tug.org (239 programs each); 
the files:

  tlprod/mips-irix6.5.tgz
and
  tlprod/sparc-solaris2.7.tgz

My earlier attempts at committing the binaries to Perforce failed;
once the change description was entered, the editor would hang forever. 
Is the direct submission to the Master tree no longer possible?

Staszek,

Tex4ht apparently had a broken code for reseting TEX4HTFONTSET, with
the help of xputenv, based on the information provided in the
i-records.  I placed a revised version of tex4ht.c at

   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes.html

I wonder whether that will suffice to solve the interaction problems
of tex4ht with kpathsea.

Do you have an e-Omega based on 1.23.x series? If that's the case, I would 
love to see the sources in TeX Live's tree. Honestly, even a 1.15 based 
e-Omega would be great.

Yes, there is an e-Omega 1.23 in this set. I will upload the change

 SR> sorry, I meant "cyrlatex"

actually, what's the reason for creating a "cyrlatex" format?
(e.g., it doesn't exist in teTeX).

the existance of such format suggests that it has some custom
non-standard macros preloaded into format (like e.g. cslatex),
but in fact it is not so: cyrlatex simply loads latex.ltx
and dumps a format.

so i suggest to remove cyrlatex from fmtutil.cnf
cyrillic support in latex doesn't require to run a special format.

Best,
v.

I am (reluctantly :-}) starting to think about TeX Live 8,
with a tentative date of mid March for a source and feature
freeze. so no new packages after that, just documentation,
making binaries, installation checking. Of course, things
*will* change after mid March, but its a good deadline
to work towards

So, is there anything people think *must* be done for TL8?

If it haven't been done already:

getting the package tree updated with the newest verions avaliable on CTAN
(and other sources??)

so that we don't get the problem of including old package versions where
new are avaliable.

Are we going somewhere in the case of license? More in the line of the
Booktabs problem, should more packages be checked for whether or not they
have some kind of acceptable license?

ideally, yes. in practice, we have to rely on reports. for instance,

another thing might be the texdoc system.

texdoc file

looks for file.dvi, ps or pdf otherwise starts netscape on the description
from CTAN.

The problem are the authors that provides theur manuals using nonstandard
names. Casual users might not know this.

for example

texdoc geometry

doesn't give any result because the manual is actually geometry-a4. On our
system I just created a soft link to it named geometry, which is a bit not
intuitive.

So my proposal is that whenever people find a package with user
documentation of a non standard name, thatn setup some sort of soft link
to it so people can better find it using texdoc.

I know there's the texdoctk program but on our system it doesn't work
since we need some Perl module :-(

Works fine on my laptop at home.

Really?  It's been in tex distributions forever.  It was included on the
tapes from UW, for instance.  And it's on CTAN.  Why shouldn't it be on TL?

I don't see that the copyright precludes unchanged distribution.

Doesn't sound bad to me.

One other thought -- this may be heretical, but does anyone actually use
the "live" part of TL?  I know that I at least have always simply copied
the whole thing to my disk.  CD is too slow and inconvenient.

If we had only an installable system, everything could be compressed and

Sebastian asks ``is there anything people think *must* be done for TL8?''

What about getting Don's latest fixes incorporated in the
distribution?  It would be a shame to delay them for another 1.5 years
(until fall 2004, when TL9 CDs might be in hand).

I agree with Karl Berry: the TeXbook and Metafontbook sources
(texman.tex and mfman.tex) should be retained in the TeXLive
distribution.

Don spoke at a TUG meeting long ago about his desire to have them
available for inspection, even though the publisher was reticent.  I'm
certainly glad that he prevailed, and I seriously doubt that the
publisher has lost any significant amount of revenue.  I use them for
benchmarking, and for answering the `how did he do that?'  questions
that pop up from time to time.  It is also fun to turn up comments
like this one from Shaw at the end of Chapter 21 of the TeXbook that
didn't make it into the book:

	% "Even dashes, cherished as they are by authors who cannot punctuate,
	% spoil a page. They are generally merely ignorant substitutes for colons."

or the comment after this remark from Chapter 26:

	\answer Radix 10 notation is used for numeric constants and for the output
	of numeric data. The first 10 |\count| registers are displayed at each
	|\shipout|, and their values are recorded on the |dvi| file at such times.
	% Also, TeX was first implemented on a DEC-10.
	% The \catcode for <space> is 10.
	% My birthday is January 10.

aaargh. IFFFFFFF we had a portable installation system,

so yes, in theory. just don't say that it means everyone

I agree.  I doubt the changes are at all problematic to include.


By the way, I have one other heretical idea: now that the numbers are
getting so big, start using years instead to label the distribution --
TL 2003, TL 2004.  The different versions can be distinguished 
just as easily either way.

sorry,  but that is the sort of thing I cannot undertake.
packages changes on CTAN at a rate of 2 or 3 a day, and
I can barely cope with the process of grabbing them
and updating TL (sounds simple; it isn't :-}). I
at least dont have the resources to understand which
is the primary documentation. Especially since, as you
note, the texdoctk database already does the work.

    IFFFFFFF we had a portable installation system,

Sure we do.  install-cd.sh.  (Windows is a completely separate case
anyway.)

    Yes, we have all had this conversation a thousand times, 

We have?  Not on the list I guess, or maybe I wasn't paying attention.

    so yes, in theory. just don't say that it means everyone
    has to use .rpm/.deb/.tar.gz/.zip/.cab.....

Sorry, I don't understand the problem.  Users don't need to know or care
what install-cd.sh uses or how the cd is organized.  They don't know
now.  At least I don't -- I've just been a user :).

I'm not saying it's trivial to do, of course, but it may be worthwhile.

(Oh, and bzip2 should be used for the actual compression, it is better
than anything else.)

pdftex/etex/omega in time. But I don't want to make that a showstopper -
the changes are, after all, highly obscure

At the risk of beeing even more heretic - let me remind you my own
favourite candidate: two (2) CDs. One with all binaries and a small
selfcontained texmf tree (and thus live). The second with everything 
else. Upon the completion of the installation of the first CD, 
a message appears in the dialogue screen (or maybe a melodic voice) 
saying 'Now please insert CD#2' after which the rest of the installation 
is done.

This is a good question. I tried to make it really live and usable under Windows for
demonstration purposes. You can typeset a complete document without
prior installation of anything. That means some minimal setup occurs
locally and it is dismissed whenever you want. WinShell is run and
documents can be typed in, compiled and viewed. I think it is good for
advertising TeX.

Not that I want to stand up too much for the live part, because the disk
space problem is annoying too. Just to remind people that TeX deserves
(and needs) to be advertised.

I wonder if a dvd makes more
sense than grabbing the extra packages from the internet. Or rather both
solutions  are of equal practicability:  you may have  a dvd reader, you
may have an internet access, you certainly have a cd-rom. Extra packages
should be available from CTAN, ready to install.

(Yeah right, release every 6 months, dream on. :)

    or every 2 years?

2003, 2005, ...

It's not the high number per se.  It's that the number increments every
year.  (TUB volume/issue numbers are even worse, don't get me started.)
Emacs 18 was releaseed in the mid 1980's, so it's only gone up by 3 in
18 years ...

I'm not saying it's a major issue, but it does confuse me from time to
time.  In fact I installed TL 7 as /usr/local/texlive8 on my system
because I couldn't remember the number at the time :).

IF Fabrice was able to switch his setup program to read foo.tar.bz2
from CD instead of reading foo.tpm and getting a list of files,
then the install-sh.cf program could do the same. so the CD
would contain

 tpm/*
 packages/*

and documentation.

downsides:

 * we lose the use Fabrice describes of a demo CD (but we could
   have the DVD for that)
 * the end user has to have bzip2 under Unix (or we ship it)
 * you cant browse the CD
 * it would better to have the metadata in the package file (like rpm 
   or deb)
 * it would break our existing system, and so mean more testing

the good news is that I could get this working from the existing
install-cd.sh in a few hours.

so
 a) do people want this?
 b) Fabrice, how much would would it be to switch your setup
    to read a bzip'ed tar file instead of a list of files?

That's a whole separate discussion.  Making a completely different
installation program would be nice, but it's not needed in order to have
an installable-only system (and thus compressed sources).  Your
proposal below is exactly what I had in mind.

    IF Fabrice was able to switch his setup program to read foo.tar.bz2
    from CD instead of reading foo.tpm and getting a list of files,

You could just bzip2 the packages (.tpm.bz2) and all you have to change
is pipe them through bunzip2.

   have the DVD for that)

See my next message.

 * the end user has to have bzip2 under Unix (or we ship it)

We ship it, definitely.  It is a small program, free software, simple to
install, runs on everything (including windows).

 * you cant browse the CD

True enough, not directly.  But we could have a toc file listing
everything there.

 * it would better to have the metadata in the package file (like rpm 
   or deb)

One step at a time.

 * it would break our existing system, and so mean more testing

yes, you are. Windows reads the live file system

a tpm is just metadata, though. the real files have to be packaged
somehow. or sorry, did you just mean bzip2 the filesin situ? ah, 
maybe thats  a choice too.

    demonstration purposes.

That's a good point.

Following on Kaja's idea, let me throw this into the ring: what if we
don't try to combine the "live" system and the "installable" system into
one.  Instead, we work on the installable system.  Then, separately,
someone can use the installable system to produce a demo system (i.e.,
fits on a cd), and is cut separately.  Thus, the demo cd image would be
available, but it would have nothing to do with the main distribution.

Separation of tasks and all that.

(For TUG's purposes, I think I would propose that we distribute only the
installable system as a "standard" benefit, and let people buy the
demo/live cd separately, based on my hunch that almost everyone just
does an install to disk.)


If we do go this route (bzip2'ing everything), do we still need the dvd or
will everything fit on a cd (or two) again?

Not that much, it is already able to read .zip  instead of a set of flat
files. I'm fine with this as  long as you  do not clutter the texmf tree
with symlinks :-) (and well, I could always duplicate the files)

mkisofs is very feature-full, and can handle this gracefully (if the
proper options are used): it can export jolliet filenames for symlinks
as plain filenames (aliases); it can store "hard links" on cd, without
duplicating file contents, etc.

e.g., it's possible to write the make-texlive-iso script in such a way
that it will make all symlinks visible in jolliet extensions (for
windows) as regular files.

How expensive/hard would it be to get file input to silently uncompress
files so that \input foo.tex would input foo.tex.bz (if it was there, or
if some flag in texmf.cnf specified that part of the search tree was
compressed, or something)
Then you could compress the files but still keep the thing "Live".

provide the desired support.


Why @imbindir@ is placed on convert, but not on dvips. As far as
tex4ht is concerned, the G-records are passed literally to a system
call function.

    system("dvips -mode ibmvga ....")
    system("@imbindir@\convert -crop 0x0 -density  ....")


Instead of having multiple environment files such as
tex4t-imagick-win32.env and tex4ht-netpbm-win32.env, a single
environment file similar to the following one may be used.

  % tex4t-win32.env 
  .....
  <imagick>
  .....
  </imagick>
  .....
  <netpbm>
  .....
  </netpbm>
  .....

Such a file allows selective loading of tagged segments, requested
through -c switches of t4ht.c.  For instance

    t4ht foo -cimagick -cwhatever  ...

sorry for responding so late (my meeting took toooo long).
Just 3.5 hours ago I sent a mail to Sebastian about new
plans for the TeXLive and CTAN CD production. I've attached
my mail so anybody will know...

Hi Sebastian,

I just read that work for TL8 starts.

I had a meeting with Christian Kaeder from Lehmanns about the
CD production this year (TL8 and CTAN). The number of CTAN2002
copies sold to the public dropped again (drastically -- till begin
of January ~80 compared to some 800 in 1998/9), the number TUG/LUGs
are ordering is more or less stable.

So this year we are trying a different approach. The offer (by
Lehmanns) is to produce a set consisting of

  2 CDs -- standard TeXLive like last year's edition,
  1 DVD -- TeXLive with all binaries/source/etc., maybe/if possible
                   with an extended texmf-tree (additional stuff,
                   that doesn't fit on the above CDs)
        -- CTAN as it is
[packaging: digifile package in colour,
  price:     for the LUGs this set will be 2$ or 1.95 Euro]

So there is a total of 2 x 700 MB + 4.3 GB of space.
CTAN last year took 2.6 GB, so TeXLive can use 1.7 GB.

The reason for a second TeXLive CD in this set is just psychological
(Kaeder: people without DVD player buying this set have a better
feeling if they get 2 CDs, even if they only could use one of them).

What do you think about this idea?
And, do you think it's feasible to have an extended version of TL8
material on DVD, or should we keep this idea for post-Bremen/next
year's TeXLive?

    Then you could compress the files but still keep the thing "Live".

That would help for the input files, but not the binaries, which are a
big chunk.

Also, although it would be relatively easy to change tex/mf themselves
to input compressed files, I think it would be much more difficult to
change all the drivers and other tools.  And until they all do it, you
couldn't compress the fonts, which I think are another big chunk.

What would solve all of that is a underlying filesystem that does
(de)compressions, but somehow I don't think we're going to put a whole
os onto the cd :).

Also, there's the small matter that foo.tex.bz2 isn't a valid filename
on Windows, right?  (That's also a problem with in situ compression even
just for installation purposes.)

afaik, it's not a problem for windows (starting with windows 95).
it's a problem for dos - but tex live doesn't run on pure 16-bit dos
anyway.

      2 CDs -- standard TeXLive like last year's edition,

If we adopt compression, perhaps it will fit on one cd again.

      1 DVD -- TeXLive with all binaries/source/etc., maybe/if possible
                       with an extended texmf-tree (additional stuff,

Having a dvd for ctan + tl sounds good to me.

So, if TeX Live wants to be free software, these files can not be part
of it.

I'm sorry, but the debian people will move TeX to non-free anyway
(see the debian-legal archives from 2002-07 and 2002-08)
eventually and the recent clarifications by DEK make the reasons
even more clear. So either we get an encyclica from RMS ex
cathedra declaring TeX to be "free" even in view of these
clarifications or I think we should stop caring about some
peoples view of the "free"ness of TeX.

Best regards

    peoples view of the "free"ness of TeX.

Whether TeX is "free" is one thing.  I see no purpose in debating that
here, we know the story.

But texbook.tex and mfbook.tex are definitely not free, as they can't
legally be modified.  So I agree with te now, I don't think they should
be included in TL.

I am a counterexample. I used it directly from CD for a long time,
because I didn't had enough disk space to make the full install, and I
wanted to explore easily also the less known to me packets.

I think there are still many potential TeX users who cannot afford the
full install and who don't have enought expertise to decide at the
partial install phase what they really need.

So I think that ,,live'' version is very important.

Another question is what should be a "standard benefit" for TUG, GUST
etc. members. I think that the only fair way to decide is to ask them.

You are wrong. The CSTUG is a contra-example.
We discussed the offer of 2CD set of TL7 from Lehmanns
in our CSTUG-board in 2002 and we decided that the second CD is totally
unusable for 99% of our members. The rest 1% members are able to get the
CD image from Internet. Lehmanns rejected our request of sending only the
first CD. Our decision was: we did not order the 2CD sets from Lehmanns
but we did burn the first CD ourself and we sent only this first CD to our
members.

as it stands today, the 2 CDs come out as:

350432 extents written (684 Mb)

so we have a pretty big problem

I am increasingly attracted by the notion of
1 CD full of bzipped tar archives which the install
program will extract, 1 DVD with the expanded tree,
and a new project to build
a demo CD for TeX from that base. Fabrice's XEmTeX
work seems to be the right basis.

Janusz makes a case for the current setup; Fabrice
wants a demo CD (but has his separate project). are
there any other votes?

can those of who work for user groups consult your
committees on this subject?

By the way, I would not propose to change the Perforce setup
at this stage. I'd reckon to build the packages CD
automatically from it.

What are the chances of this TeX live to fit on a mini-CD? Or

Actually, XEmTeX will not be a demo cd, but rather a big archive
(200~300 Mb unpacked) from which will be extracted (pdfe)tex, xemacs, a
mid texmf tree (only type1 fonts, no metafont and pk) and a

I don't think we should ever change it. Even if the perforce repository
can serve as a basis for a new ctan (the one which will allow to
download updates or ready-to-install packages), the expanded form is the
most easy to work with.

    Janusz makes a case for the current setup; 

Um, I don't think it was so much a case for the "current setup" as for
having a live cd (which I agree with), whether or not there is also an
installable cd.  Is that right, Janusz?

So as long as we bring that to fruition, I think everyone will be happy.

    1 DVD with the expanded tree,

Should the dvd really have the expanded tree?  I think it would be
better to have the compressed version.  Otherwise, by your own count,
you have already filled it up (1.3gb is how much Volker said was
available after ctan).

    can those of who work for user groups consult your
    committees on this subject?

Ok.

    By the way, I would not propose to change the Perforce setup
    at this stage.

I certainly agree that perforce should not include compressed tar files :).

the 2CD version duplicates the whole texmf tree on both CDs (differing
only in binaries), and 1DVD version will of course not duplicate texmf
tree, so we still have a lot of space on DVD.

Well, changing that is what's under discussion right now.

    and 1DVD version will of course not duplicate texmf tree, 

Seb just said he was thinking it would?  At least that's how I read it.
Like I said, personally I'd rather have the compressed version on the dvd.

    so we still have a lot of space on DVD.

Not if ctan is there as well.  Volker said there was about 1.3gb
available for TL, and that was the expanded total that Seb gave.

Hmm, my instructions were passed down by my forebears, during some cold

Subject: [tex-live] explicit calls to fmtutil
Message-ID: <ey8ywt9w4c.fsf@video.uic.vsu.ru>

Hi,

it's a good news that now mostly all 2-line scripts whihc call
(pdfe)tex with different formats were replaced with symlinks.

still, 4 such scripts remain: cslatex, csplain, pdfcslatex,
pdfcsplain.

i have two proposals:

1) remove unneeded explicit calls to fmtutil, i.e. these lines:

cslatex:test -f "`kpsewhich cslatex.fmt`" || fmtutil --byfmt cslatex
csplain:test -f "`kpsewhich csplain.fmt`" || fmtutil --byfmt csplain
pdfcslatex:test -f "`kpsewhich pdfcslatex.fmt`" || fmtutil --byfmt pdfcslatex
pdfcsplain:test -f "`kpsewhich pdfcsplain.fmt`" || fmtutil --byfmt pdfcsplain

   since format will be generated on the fly anyway - tex will call
   mktexfmt is the fmt is not found.

   this can be done immediately, and everything will work fine.

2) provide a possibility to pass command-line parameters to
   tex&friends by default (via texmf.cnf or fmtutil.cnf), so that e.g.
   -default-translate-file=il2-cs could be passed to tex of the
   progname is cslatex.

   then, the remaining 4 scripts could be replaced with symlinks too.

Best,
v.

I think it's doable if you leave out the documentation. Just some
selected binaries (tex, etex, pdftex, pdfetex, dvips and a
viewer), plain, LaTeX and the BSR-CM fonts. This should be
possible for i386-linux, win32 and OSX. And if we somehow add
a ramdisk we could even use Metafont.

Best regards

You need to install ghostscript. It should be available on the cdrom,
and installation offered from the menu of the "texlive" application.

Subject: [tex-live] New win32 binaries
Message-ID: <smv0gi3j.fsf@esemetz.ese-metz.fr>


I have uploaded new binaries to :
- the perforce depot for texlive
- ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/standalone/binaries-latest-win32.zip

News :
- switched the version to 8.0 for the dlls
- eomega 1.23
- quoted file names for the tex engines (more on this later)
- fixed ht.exe (unfortunately, not yet the very latest tex4ht.c/t4ht.c
files by Eitan)
- fixed various perl scripts : epstopdf, updmap


Things still needed :
- testing the quoted filenames, this is specifically for windows users
who are allowed and used to use spaces in filenames. This practice is
not TeX friendly, but I still think that it is up to TeX to adapt to the
environment. So you are allowed to do something like this :

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}
\input{"sub dir/c d"}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{"e f"}
\include{"g\space h"}
\end{document}

And that will run ok either with latex or pdflatex. Now the problem is :
are there any really harmful side effects ?

- checking that the files produced by updmap are the same as on Unix

Any report welcome,

That means that those people on debian-legal have a different view about
free software than the fsf which considers TeX to be free software.

I am sure that RMS will tell you that TeX is free software if you ask him.

hoekwater.map, pxfonts.map, txfonts.map are in other locations in your
tree. I think that hoekwater.map is a collection of several fonts that
Taco has made and pxfonts.map, txfonts.map are in tetex, because I have
changed them from the original (to use 8r.enc instead of something else
for the same content).

These lucidabr-o.map / lumath-o.map are a nice addition to Walter's
maps. They provide the Y&Y names which people still get if they use the
macros provided by Y&Y (e.g. for plain tex). This only makes sense,
however, if you also add the aliases for the tfm files (see teTeX's
aliases file).

Barbara raises a good point.  Please, whatever else happens (in re the
meeting at Bremen), let's make sure that there continues to be a TL
distribution which is entirely free software.  Ok?

(Well, if dfsg starts excluding tex we'll have to come up with some
other definition, but you know what I mean :)

i'm quite pleased that there will be a discussion at the dante
meeting concerning the content and creation of the tex live and
ctan disks.

one thing that has been omitted from the discussion in these
messages, however, is the fact that ctan is not "free software",
while there has been a very serious, and successful, effort to
make tex live entirely free according to the fsf guidelines.
(i'm a lurker on the tex-live list.)

how that affects the ability to (re)distribute tex live should
really be taken into account.  i don't have time to get involved
in this discussion, but hope that karl, perhaps, will bring up
this question in the relevant forum.

I can work with this (unless someone else is already doing so!).

Where is the database for teTeX?

maybe. the files like pdftex.map and psfonts.map are created
by "updmap", which (by default) writes in $VARTEXMF. I decided
they did not belong in the TeX Live tree, as a user should
always make his/her own updmap run. the install procedure does this,
of course.

however, it looks like you have an old pdftex config file somewhere,
as things like rawfonts.map and csfontd.mapfile are now all gone
(well rawfonts *should* have gone :-}).

moral:

 * find and destroy (or amend) local pdftex.cfg
 * run updmap

Using Fabrice's organization of the tree, I created web2c 7.4.6 which
has an 1.23.2.1 based e-Omega.

Note that this is not a fished work, and should the entire release
should be considered suitable for testing purposes only.

Use these links to get it:

Ok, I understand. So I zapped all my texmf-var, have
TEXMFMAIN=texlive/Master/texmf, and run texconfig init and updmap, 
now this is working. 
BUT:
Using times.sty in latex and dvips it:
[~/tex/goedel/ismvl03] dvips ismvl03 
This is dvips(k) 5.92b Copyright 2002 Radical Eye Software (www.radicaleye.com)
' TeX output 2003.02.10:2323' -> ismvl03.ps
dvips: ! Couldn't find header file 8r.enc

Grr:
[~/tex/goedel/ismvl03] find /src/p4-base/Master -name 8r.enc
/src/p4-base/Master/texmf/fontname/8r.enc
/src/p4-base/Master/texmf/vtex/enc/8r.enc

So why this now? This shouldn't happen, or?

Anyway, thanks a lot for your help!

Best wishes

Norbert

In web2c/fmtutil.cnf we have:
# Change "tex -> etex" and "latex.ini -> *latex.ini" to get an

# and use elatex which is just the same.
latex           tex             language.dat    latex.ini
etex            etex            language.def    *etex.ini
elatex          etex            language.dat    *elatex.ini

but latex is now a link to etex (even on Win32, last binaries from
Fabrice). Can somebody guess the consequence? ;-)
fmtutil produces latex.fmt, but running latex tries to generate
the format, then gives an error.
What about existing local copies of fmtutil.cnf when upgrading
to TL8?

Switching latex to etex should be made more carefully.

With this I get a clean make, but even with
--with-cxx-runtime-hack pdfTeX is dynamically linked to
libstdc++.so.2.8.1 -- I know this causes problems on Linux, is it
the same on Solaris?

You can't. Users who just call fmtutil will get an error. Running
texlinks after fmtutil is required (that texlinks will set the
symlinks according to the engine in fmtutil.cnf).

BTW: running texlinks is disabled in texconfig if version='TeX Live',
so please reconsider that.

Not a problem unless you take the binary to a different machine.  As for
gcc3, I suggest to build it with --disable-shared if you want to use it
for producing binaries for other machines...

Subject: [tex-live] cleanup
Message-ID: <m3fzqufiox.fsf@vvv.vsu.ru>

Hi,

i have some proposals to clean up:

1) remove the following line from fmtutil.cnf:

cyrlatex        tex             language.ru     cyrlatex.ini

   since:
    * there's no need for cyrlatex format - it's the same as latex format
    * the above line is incorrect - there's no language.ru file, and
      even if there was one, it would never define patterns for this
      format (because language.dat will be used anyway).

2) remove the file tex/latex/cyrillic/cyrlatex.ini
   (see above - it's the same as latex.ini; it also doesn't belong to
   the cyrillic bundle)

3) remove the following files from tex/generic/config:

language.cy.dat language.cz.dat language.de.dat language.dk.dat
language.es.dat language.et.dat language.fi.dat language.fr.dat
language.gb.dat language.gr.dat language.hr.dat language.hu.dat
language.it.dat language.la.dat language.mn.dat language.ne.dat
language.no.dat language.pl.dat language.pt.dat language.ro.dat
language.ru.dat language.sh.dat language.si.dat language.sw.dat
language.us

   since:
    * they are not used anywhere. they just waste space.
    * all their contents is present in language.dat anyway.

4) remove the file tex/generic/hyphen/ruhyph.tex
   since:
    * it's a duplication of tex/generic/ruhyphen/ruhyphen.tex
      (and it's a source of maintenance errors)
    * it cannot be used stand-alone - it's part of the ruhyphen package
    * aliases already contains the line "ruhyphen.tex ruhyph.tex"

Best,
v.

Hi Sebastian!

Would it be possible to include musixlyr into texlive. It is GPL and
available from
http://icking-music-archive.sunsite.dk/software/indexmt6.html or more
detailed from
http://icking-music-archive.sunsite.dk/software/musixtex/add-ons/musixlyr20c.tgz

In fact it is only one file musixlyr.tex and a bit of documentation:
COPYING  mxlyrdoc.dvi  mxlyrdoc.tex  README

Best wishes

Not so fast, please ;-). We use that files during installation: when
the user selects any language package, $VARTEXMF/tex/generic/config/
will contain language.dat built on-the-fly and (some) format files 
will be then ready to use, according to the selection.
Of course, language.ru.dat has to be touched:

ruhyph.tex -> ruhyphen.tex

as you suggested:

Ooops, I can recall the discussion with Petr Olsak. ;-)
Anyway, it's pity that we can't have all patterns in one place (even
multiple variants) on TL and on CTAN.

So why it is not on CTAN? 
It can go to:
texmf/tex/generic/musixlyr/musixlyr.tex
texmf/doc/generic/musixlyr/mxlyrdoc.tex|dvi README
(perhaps without COPYING; we have it everywhere).

it's on CTAN:macros/musixtex/taupin/add-ons/musixlyr20c.tgz

it would be nice to add also some binaries needed to typeset music:
musixflx, pmxab... sources for all of them are available on
CTAN:macros/musixtex/taupin

i can add them to source.development, if there are no objections.

yes, ruhyphen and ukrhyph packages contain a number of files, and they
better fit in their own directories under tex/generic.

so, please remove tex/generic/hyphen/ruhyph.tex :)

This time it was working. Maybe it is because of various firewalls
between the end points filtering out ftp-data on unusual areas. My idea:
If you have linux-2.4 stateful firewall, the ftp netfilter module only
checks the connections on ftp and not on 6666, so that the reverse stuff
is not working because the connection is not acceptet as related.

My simple experience. If you want more testing, I will take a look into
our firewall log files.

At my site, I find that

	ncftpget ftp://sun.dante.de:6666/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

hangs for a very long time, then starts to get a connection

Data connection timed out.

but never transfers anything.

If I use ordinary ftp, then I can get the file easily:

	ftp sun.dante.de 6666

	Name (sun.dante.de:beebe): anonymous
	...
	cd /Master/texmf/web2c/
	...
	get texmf.cnf

	21823 bytes received in 0.45 seconds (47.16 Kbytes/s)

If I use wget, the file comes over quickly, but the connection
does not break.

It looks like the issue with the perforce repository is that it needs
a regular, rather than passive, ftp connection.  

The difference has to do with which end assigns the communications
port: the FTP protocol has PORT and PASV commands for the two cases.

	wget --passive-ftp ftp://sun.dante.de:6666/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
	[hang...]

	wget ftp://sun.dante.de:6666/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

	ncftpget ftp://sun.dante.de:6666/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

	ncftpget -F ftp://sun.dante.de:6666/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
	[hang...]

	ncftpget -E ftp://sun.dante.de:6666/Master/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
	[works...]

wget by default uses regular mode, while ncftpget by default uses
passive mode.

It does not work from here using wget under Windows. See the wget log
attached.

I can even connect using telnet :

you must use port 6666 to access the Perforce thing.
there is no anonymous FTP to TeX Live on sun.dante.de,
as there is no copy of the files (only the compressed
form)

Yes, I can reproduce this. my wget has passive-ftp turned
on by default. If I change that, the retrieval works.

I'll ask Perforce support about this

Perforce Technical support replied to me as follows. I think it does
make sense.

Anyway, the bottom line is that you can have full anonymous FTP access
to the Perforce repository at sun.dante.de:1666, as long as you
use active ftp or tweak your firewalling.

Do we want to advertise this?

The testing done here a little while ago confirms this:
- initially, none of suggested connections worked
- when we logged onto a machine in another dept. where the firewall 
hasn't been set up yet, 'wget' worked perfectly. 
- finally, we did a bit of 'tweaking' at our site and wget works now.

Sebastian can have ~5GB for TeXLive on DVD!

After talking to Lehmanns and the CD/DVD company, for approx 0.15 Euro
we can have an 8GB DVD.

Please merge with the development tree.

Changes compared to 7.4.6:

- libtool

Not sure whether it still works:

- The omega 1.23.4 tree

Next up:

- either encTeX or DEK's new stuff -- the latter needs an e-TeX update.

Mostly. pdftex.mk needs an added dependency of tangle (#2876).

This has all the packages in compressed tar archives,
and a suitably changed install-cd.sh script. 

Comments on whether the install works gratefully received.

The only gotchas I *know* will upset people are
 a) you need bzip2 installed
 b) if you choose to exclude source and/or documentation,
  the script uses GNU extensions to tar to achieve do the job

If anyone wants to rewrite install-pkg.sh in the same way,
I'd be delighted.

the original install is at install-dvd.sh, under the assumption
that we'll ship an uncompressed tree on DVD.

The texmf tree should be clean and up to date (as of
last Tuesday or so), and more or less in sync with teTeX 2.0.1

Obviously, the documentation is unchanged

Web2C 7.5.1 -- "aiming for instability"

Changes compared to 7.5.0:

- new sources from DEK (to merge with e-TeX, I effectively had to back
  out DEK's leaders fix).
- little fixes

Fairly certain it doesn't work anymore:

- The omega 1.23.4 tree

Next up:

- probably encTeX

yes, sure, but that means doing the work in the source
tree, and I can't face that at the moment. volunteers very

alpha osf and ibm aix are definitely old. all others should
be rerun sometime, but not yet. we can hope for more goodies

texinfo in the repository is again not compilable (modtime is set) on 
systems without the autoconf texinfo wants you to have. Something with 
timestamps on the files. I cannot recall what it was (if I ever knew it 
in the first place). I think change 2611 did this once in the past, but 
the log does not explain it.

So, the ******** texinfo problem is back *again*. Can someone help me 
and tell me what files to touch in what order to make sure texinfo just 
configures and compiles?

Thanks,

The problem is that I just upload the changed files. But, I think that
I have found a systematic way to fix this kind of problems:

mkdir -p /build/X
rm -rf /build/X/*
cd /build/X
rm -rf /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo
p4 sync -f /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo/...
touch x
/t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo/configure
make # add write permissiond with p4 edit if autoconf cannot write some
     # file and retry
find /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo -type f -newer x \
  | xargs p4 edit
p4 submit

This assumes that the right auto-tools are in PATH, so only people who
have these tools can try such a fix. I think that I have correctly
adjusted the timestamps now.

1) What I don't understand is why texinfo and only texinfo keeps
   breaking for this.  What is so special about it?  I don't do anything

2) Texinfo is almost completely separate from TeX; I mean, general TeX

   have little interest in TeX.  So, you might consider simply dropping
   Texinfo from teTeX, and then these problems will go away forever :).

Hi Karl,

>    breaking for this.  What is so special about it?  I don't do anything

Please, don't take this matter personally. texinfo is 100% ok. It is
the perforce server and the way we (or only me?) submit files that
is not ok.

E.g. in my update for texinfo (the one that broke it again), I have
replaced all changed files in my local repository (I needed to open the
files for edit to be able to do so). Then, I have done a local compile
to make sure that I get the timestamps right. Then, I have submitted my
changes to perforce.

That was incomplete, because autoconf/automake have changed the
timestamps of some files locally, but these files have not been
open for edit, to the "submit" did not push them to the perforce
tree.

I think that if we take care of changed timestamps and submit these files,
too (in addition to changed files), there should no longer be any problem.

Why it is only texinfo: it is too good. Other parts don't use automake...

I just recalled, I *am* working with source and not source.development. 
My first priority is to get a compilation of the stable TeX release. 
You did update source too?

Where do you sync from? I have only changed source.development. For me,
it works:
  rm -rf /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo; p4 sync -f /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo/...
  cd /build/X
  /t/texlive/Build/source.development/TeX/utils/texinfo/configure ; make

No invocation of autoconf / automake.

Uhhmm... I do not think that tar.bz2 is the best choice for TL CD.
1. browsing the CD is now lost;
2. running from the CD is rather impossible now (but worked quite
   perfectly, even on win32, for quick presentation, etc.); even having 
   a look at ls-R on the CD could help finding something urgently needed; 
   so we have now rather '\TeX{} $<$ Live'; 
3. if we stay with the CD as only installation medium, why not using just zip:
   a) bzip2 is _slow_ (extremelly on Win32, and on not so fast machines),
   b) uncompressing needs 2 programs: bzip2 and tar,
   c) zip _can_ contain soft links, and of course the whole tree, and can
      be uncompressed in just one pass;
   d) it would be much easier for Fabrice to implement;
   e) browsing the contents of a package, and the contents of specified file
      is easier (windows users have several programs to do it, the same
      can be done on linux and I hope also on other *ix);
   f) zip/unzip is free and much more popular on every platform than bzip2.

snapshot from Feb 17 is about 500MB, but it contains some 43MB garbage
in /source/ so using zip can also fit on 700MB CD.
By the way, it took for me ~40' to grab .iso.bz2 from the net, but bzip2
uncompressed it in ~20'!

bzip2 is the politically correct choice, I thought? I just follow
others advice that bzip2 is the most efficient. its much more natural
to me than zip, which is why I did it.

the same applies to .tar.bz2, surely?

its true, we could use zip. I dont mind either way

It seems that an independent creation and installl of just the binaries 
is not possible anymore. Why is this? Why should I at this point in 
time (install) have to recreate the formats?

My setup (for Mac OS X distribution) is such that I produce a separate 
texmf and binaries distribution, updated separately. Creating formats 
is then only possible when both are installed in the same location. 
Until now, I could do this with TeX Live, as it just (as it should) 
installed the binaries and libraries and left the creation of formats 
for me to do at a time of my choosing.

This link now seems to make that clean independence impossible.

I think Staszek is right about speed. It is awfully slow, much slower
than unzip. I would like to know how we lose between .tar.bz2 and .zip
for all those packages (my guess : much less than we would lose by
zipping the iso image instead of bzip2'ing it, because of the small
packages).

That's true I can deal with .tar.bz2 files too, but that's true people
will find them really strange under Windows (no known tool to unpack them).

Finally, as I already mailed you, there are  a lot of goodies in infozip
options, like  the ability to set  the  timestamp of the  archive to the
timestamp of the most recent file in the archive (which you could
achieve by running a separate script, agreed).

But on the other hand, what is the status of infozip wrt to Free
Software ? Is it free enough ?

It is not just perforce, there is also a problem with texinfo as it is 
set up. The texinfo maintainers have added maintainer-specific 
dependencies to the Makefile. As a result, there is a circular 
dependency (Makefile -> configure -> Makefile). This is doable in 
principle, but the system becomes 'brittle' because it is easy for the 
Makefile to conclude that configure has to be remade (which requires 
autoconf) and re-run. Requiring autoconf on the 'user' side is against 
the whole 'auto*' philosophy. Auto* stuff is for the maintainer only, 
the user should not need it. They will agree, but they have made that 
independence depend on timestamps instead of setup.

I think this is a mistake. Making configure depend on Makefile produces 
a less robust setup (as we see now). Suddenly, the *source* setup 
becomes dependent on time stamps (normally, only *results* are 
dependent on time stamps. And there is a lot that can go wrong with 
timestamps.

So, do not blame perforce. Blame the texinfio maintainers who have gone 
one step to far in trying to automate their maintenance work, thereby 
making texinfo brittle for users.

It's BSDish but not OSI certified and the FSF has no public

I don't know if debian has it in free or non-free.

I have made a CD using zip files instead of .tar.bz2,
and it uses hardly any more space (still around the 500 mbyte mark).
so unless someone has a good technical or legal reason not
to use zip, lets stick with that.

Fabrice, can you make your setup work with that?

does anyone want a test CD to try under Unix/Linux?

one of the benefits of all this, of course, is that
it makes it a lot easier to put replacements for
particular packages (as fpTeX already does)

yes. I let something escape from source.development.

Hey, that's not some anonymous group of random people, it's me :).

    have added maintainer-specific 
    dependencies to the Makefile. 

I do use the automake conditional feature in doc/Makefile.am
so that installers don't have to have help2man installed.
Is that what you're talking about?  I don't see the problem with it,
though, since of course configure does not depend on the man pages.

    As a result, there is a circular 
    dependency (Makefile -> configure -> Makefile). 

I don't see it.  Where?  Please be specific, so I can fix it.

    Requiring autoconf on the 'user' side is against 
    the whole 'auto*' philosophy.

Obviously I agree.

    So, do not blame perforce. Blame the texinfio maintainers who have
    gone one step to far

As far as I know all I'm doing is using automake in a completely
standard way.  I don't think that's "going too far".

    in trying to automate their maintenance work,
    thereby making texinfo brittle for users.

I have never received a bug report about this problem from anyone who's
installed Texinfo normally -- only you-all who have copied it into
perforce :).

Does any other program in TL use automake?  It seems to me that any
distribution that uses automake would have the same problems.

Hm... klibtool was replaced by libtool. It should not be called at
all. Did I miss something in source.development?

Web2C 7.5.2 -- "critical fixes"

Changes compared to 7.5.1:

- fix bug in kpathsea that caused coredumps during file search.
- picking nits in the confgure stuff
- picking nits in the makefiles _and_ in the *dir/*.mk makefile
  fragments.

Fairly certain it doesn't work anymore:

- The omega 1.23.4 tree

Next up:

- probably encTeX, but not before the weekend.

Let's see if can get the links correct in one try this time:

Message-ID: <03022016422908.32342@volker.Informatik.Uni-Tuebingen.De>

	
Hello together,

I use pdfLaTeX and include a lot of pdf-graphics which I generate in the 
following way: GIF -> (XFIG + XV) -> EPS -> (epstopdf) -> PDF

Until now no problem. Recently however I upgraded ghostscript from 5.x to 7.x 
and realized that pdf-files generated in the above way got look quite ugly 
now. The problem is that apparently the default settings for the pdfwriter 
device in ghostscript have changed such that images are by default 
JPG-encoded (AutoFilterColorImages, ColorImageFilter, EncodeColorImages, ..). 
Of course this looks ugly for screenshots.

I could solve the problem by executing ghostscript with the right parameters, 
however there is no chance to hand over these parameters through epstopdf. So 
I hacked a new version of epstopdf (2.8) which gives the user the opportunity 
to specify these paramters if he wants. 

Unfortunately, I don't exactly now where to post the new version since I 
found no offical epstopdf home page (the version on CTAN is QUITE old, still 
version 2.5, TeXLive comes with the newest version I'm aware of: 2.7). 

I hope the new version can be usfull to others as well an that you guys know 
how to put it to the right place.

Any comments are always welcome.

Sincerely,

Volker Simonis

Your users need to know the PATH for the binaries (I think they are in
/usr/TeX/bin/i386-linux/

Just place it as the first thing in your PATH settings (usually set in
your .cshrc or .bashrc)

When I did some test installations I used this in my .cshrc (csh syntax)

setenv PATH /home/daleif/TeXLive7/linux/bin/i386-linux:$PATH

Then it works fine.

Dear all,

I have some trouble installing xemacs on win32 from texlive.
The download fails, as it trys to get

xemacs-21.5b9-win32.zip.

Can this be fixed in some way?

Subject: [tex-live] xdvi and postscript fonts question
Message-ID: <BCB0620F-452D-11D7-ACF4-0003930AD8A4@rna.nl>

I would like to support X11 on Mac OS X with my TeX redistribution. 
This seems to work except for Postscript fonts. Can someone explain to 
me what is going on here and how I should go about fixing this? It 
looks like some mapping problem.

Here is the info:

When I add \usepackage{times} to sample2e.tex it compiles well, but 
opening it in xdvi gives the following error message:

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+264/600 
--dpi 864 ptmb7t
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for ptmb7t.
xdvi: Can't find font ptmb7t; using Type1 version of cmr10 instead.

and a lot more like this one. Running the DVi file through dvicopy 
first fixes this. Dvicopy reports:

have you done tracing to see what map files xdvi is reading?

My first thought was that you should rather use:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{times}
because texmf/xdvi/xdvi.cfg lists only 8r.enc, and such reencoding files
are already listed in ps2pk.map (used by xdvi) and other map files. But...
> for font 6 = ptmr7t scaled 1728.
> VF: font 0 = ptmr8r scaled 1728.
so the real name for the driver's map file is now ptmr8r.

Times family fonts for dvips, pdftex and dvipdfm can be downloaded (embeded)
to the resulting output, but since they are rather standard for the "devices"
(PS printers, GhostScript viewing/printing, or AcrobatReader), 
we have only references like TeX's tfm/vf names -> real PostScript 
names in the _default_ map files for the those drivers (to say briefly).
Xdvi with T1lib rendering machinery uses in our case ps2pk.map,
which should contain not only name maping, but also PS font program
to render (pfb file installed).
So you have to install urwstd package which contains 35 standard PS
fonts in Type1 (pfb) format.

>and a lot more like this one. Running the DVi file through dvicopy 
>first fixes this. Dvicopy reports:

Irrelevant, since dvicopy lists calls to fonts according
to the TeX's names (tfm files). How it is used by device drivers like 
dvips, xdvi, etc., depends on map files.

Not needed if you have installed urwstd package. GS Fontmap lists
the same fonts we have in urwstd (but with different file names).
I know well that it can be some redundance, but as GS is for me a general
purpose program, I'd prefer having clean and running TeX sofware not
only for me, but also for BLU.
As for the above t1mapper, you should perhaps changing in web2c/updmap.cnf
LW35 URWkb
to
LW35 URW
but I didn't checked it ;-)

Ps. Sebastian, when installing urwstd package we have also directives
for updmap run. Do we really need it in the case that standard scheme used
in updmap.cfg is:
#   URW:     URW fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. n019064l.pfb)
#   URWkb:   URW fonts with "berry" filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
LW35 URWkb

Would installing that not create a conflict with the alreadyinstalled 
type1 pfb's? After all, When I use pdftex or dvips+ghostscript to 
produce a PDF I have no font trouble at all.

How can I recignize if I already have urwstd i my system?

I agree that a separate solution is to be preferred.

Again, would that not give a conflict with the existing setup which 
works fine for dvips and pdftex? The man page for updmap says it does 
create the support for xdvi. Maybe I just have to change the map files 
xdvi is configured to use? It now uses ps2pk.map.

So, what I am actually asking is this: how to create/configure type1 
support for xdvi *without* influencing the working dvips/pdftex setup.

This should not be necessary. For me, the map files provided by teTeX just
work fine for xdvi. Anyway, if xdvi has a problem with ptmb7t (rather than
ptmb8r), then it is an issue of virtual fonts, not of map files.

ptmr7t -> ptmr8r is done by virtual fonts, not by \usepackage[...]{fontenc}

No. These fonts are included in teTeX's texmf tree which Gerben uses.
He does not need to install additional font packages.

No, teTeX includes the urw fonts with "Berry" names.

It looks like it. Some variable in texmf.cnf maybe? Because dvicopy

Please, remove all FOO.xdvi settings from your texmf.cnf file.

Actually, this is probably the reason. A long while back someone asked 
me to put this into my distributed texmf.cnf so that xdvi would work:

% files for xdvi. TeXGSInstaller does not support X, but I have been 
told that
% the following lines make it possible for people to use my distribution
PKFONTS.XDvi    = .:$TEXMF/%s:$VARTEXFONTS/pk/{%m,modeless}//
VFFONTS.XDvi    = .:$TEXMF/%s
PSHEADERS.XDvi  = .:$TEXMF/%q{dvips,fonts/type1}//
PSFIGURES.XDvi  = .:$TEXMF/%q{dvips,tex}//
PKFONTS.xdvi    = .:$TEXMF/%s:$VARTEXFONTS/pk/{%m,modeless}//
VFFONTS.xdvi    = .:$TEXMF/%s
PSHEADERS.xdvi  = .:$TEXMF/%q{dvips,fonts/type1}//
PSFIGURES.xdvi  = .:$TEXMF/%q{dvips,tex}//

But it seems to break things.

I probably need no changes at all.

This was bad timing ;-) I planned to email you to remove the
*.xdvi settings since they break xdvik[1], which was reported to
me by an OS X user. Before that I decided to ask Thomas Esser
whether it would make sense to put the *.XDvi settings into
texmf.cnf by default (as recommended by the INSTALL file of
xdvi[2]). But he had observed that they seemed to be no longer
needed with current xdvi[2] (and it also worked for me without
them). It seems that this change was introduced in xdvi-22.65;
http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/xdvi.html says:

   22.65 [23 October 2002] ... Changed some environment variable
      names for compatibility with Kpathsea.

Paul, can you confirm this? Should the corresponding paragraph
from xdvi's INSTALL be removed?

This would mean that all the settings listed above should be
removed, so that only the default entries from teTeX's texmf.cnf
remain:

PKFONTS = .;{$TEXMF/fonts,$VARTEXFONTS}/pk/{$MAKETEX_MODE,modeless}//
GFFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/gf/$MAKETEX_MODE//
GLYPHFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts
MISCFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/misc//
T1FONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/type1//
AFMFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/afm//
VFFONTS = .;$TEXMF/fonts/vf//
TFMFONTS = .;{$TEXMF/fonts,$VARTEXFONTS}/tfm//

[1] xdvi + kpathsea extensions
[2] Paul Vojta's original xdvi without kpathsea

Best,
Stefan

These are to support the non-k xdvi, but they might be unnecessary.

These have to go away, because they break compatibility with xdvik.

Subject: [tex-live] images in PS output
Message-ID: <1045823819.1510.13.camel@gonzo>

Hi folks,

I've a small problem with images when generating PS output
from DVI files...

Preamble: in my documentation projects, I store images
as EPS and generate DVI files with latex. Then, I use
dvips to generate PS/PDF output.

Well, when I generate PDF output with the command

  dvips -q -f -Ppdf -G0 myfile.dvi | gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH \
  -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=myfile.pdf -c .setpdfwrite -

I get good quality images, while when I generate PS output with
the command

  dvips -q -Pcmz -Pamz myfile.dvi -o myfile.ps

I get really poor quality images.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Have you tried
  dvips -q -Ppdf -G0 myfile.dvi

-Ppdf activates more type1 fonts than -Pcmz -Pamz. These cmz and amz
printer definitions are just included for compatibility reasons.

If you create your pdf file, dvips first creates a ps file. And you
include the same images, because you use dvips in both cases. It must be a
problem of your previewing program. What happens if you pring these files?

.
Yes, but I don't have problems with fonts (the fonts activated by -Pamz
and -Pcmz are OK and the rendered text is perfect). The problem arises
with images only. Images in PDF output are of good quality, while
images in PS output are of poor quality (it looks like as if it were
less resolution).

Ach... You are right! I'm using ggv as viewer and images are rendered
poorly... I tried to print the same document in PDF format as well as
PS format the the result is the same.

There is a bug somewhere if you install with all defaults: it not

to install any binaries.

it should do. This will happen if it failed to detect your system
properly. what sort of box was it?

it seems unlikely that, if this was a normal happening,
someone would not have reported it in the last 9 months?

OK, this problem was solved... but now I have something else...

I usually generate PDF and PS output starting from the same DVI
file... well, the page size of the generated PS documents is
correct (A4), while the page size of the generated PDF documents
is wrong (215 x 279.4 mm).

Any idea?

Try
  dvips ... -t a4 ...
and/or
  gs ... sPAPERSIZE=a4 ...

For me, any of these two solves this problem.

Thomas,

Thanks, this solves the problem... but I don't
understand why it doesn't work without one of
these options since the preamble of my tex
file starts with

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
...

I've the same problem when I use LaTeX to
transform a *.fo file into a *.dvi -> *.pdf
file (I use this to generate PDF/PS output
from DocBook files).

dvips puts only very little information about a4 paper into the ps output.
The default papersize definition in config.ps is:

  @ A4size 210mm 297mm
  @+ %%PaperSize: A4

This is to give the best possible compatibility for the ps output that is
generated.

By passing -t a4, you get the following definition:
  @ a4 210mm 297mm
  @+ ! %%DocumentPaperSizes: a4
  @+ %%BeginPaperSize: a4
  @+ a4
  @+ %%EndPaperSize

This way, dvips puts enough information into the output, so that gs can
get the ps->pdf conversion right. You can make this a4 definition the
default, by rearranging the order in dvips's config.ps (or by executing
the command "texconfig dvips paper a4").

I does not matter much what you say in your (La)TeX file. Maybe, there
are possibilities to pass things to dvips via \special commands, but
the papersize definitions are the usual way to do this.

The change in 22.65 changed only the environment variable names, not
the semantics.  teTeX's current settings will work, but you will lose
the benefit of ls-R since %q is missing.

Sorry, my fault. Unfortunately I'm stuck with other tasks for the moment
and I can't easily fix it. I think you  can safely download the file, un
pack it to either "c:\Program Files" or "c:\Local" and set a shortcut on
your desktop to "XEmacs\XEmacs-21.5\i586-pc-win32\xemacs.exe"

I have been caught by enctex and dumping/undumping things for a moment. 
There is this piece of code in texmfmp.h :

/* `dump_int' is called with constant integers, so we put them into a
   variable first.  */
#define	dumpint(x)							\
  do									\
    {									\
      integer x_val = (x);						\
      generic_dump (x_val);						\
    }									\
  while (0)

/* web2c/regfix puts variables in the format file loading into
   registers.  Some compilers aren't willing to take addresses of such
   variables.  So we must kludge.  */
#ifdef REGFIX
#define undumpint(x)							\
  do									\
    {									\
      integer x_val;							\
      generic_undump (x_val);						\
      x = x_val;							\
    }									\
  while (0)
#else
#define	undumpint generic_undump
#endif


I find it very strange that both aren't exactly symetric. EncTeX is
dumping a boolean and it was dumped as an int and undumped as a boolean
(different sizes). So be warned. I had to define REGFIX.

Don't ever dump booleans directly.
Where is encTeX doing this?

I mean to be exactly symetric, REGFIX should always be defined.

>> EncTeX is dumping a boolean and it was dumped as an int and undumped
>> as a boolean (different sizes). So be warned. I had to define REGFIX.

> Don't ever dump booleans directly.  Where is encTeX doing this?

in enc-option.patch-to-7.5 :

+dump_int(enc_option);
+if enc_option then
+begin
+  dump_things(xord[0], 256);
+  dump_things(xchr[0], 256);
+  dump_things(xprn[0], 256);
+  dump_things(mubyte_read[0], 256);
+  dump_things(mubyte_write[0], 256);
+  dump_things(mubyte_cswrite[0], 128);
+  print (" encTeX data dumped");
+end

If you dump a boolean using dump_int, it will be cast to an int. If you
undump it without REGFIX defined, then it will be undumped as a boolean,
at least on my machine/compiler.

Speed, I think.  It's old code.

You shouldn't dump booleans at all because on different machines you
can end up with different sizes: note how mltex_p is handled.

There's some other stuff that seems off in the patch: web2c's
'dump_int(hyph_prime)' gets turned into 'dump_int(hyph_size)'; I'm not
convinced that is a good idea.

I may also end up suggesting somewhat different messages.

Message-ID: <200302221824.h1MIOpj16888@tug.org>

I just did some general editing on http://tug.org/texlive/.  I was
inspired to do this because Robin (Laakso, the TUG office mgr) has been
contacting assorted publishers to see if they'd like to distribute TL
with TeX books that they publish.  (TUG would provide the cd's at cost
if desired.)  There has been some decent interest, and I thought going
over the home page would be helpful.  I tried to make it a little less
of an advertisement for TUG :).

I also put in a warning about TL maybe not being "live" on cd for this
year, just to see if anyone notices.


One question - the second paragraph (now) says:

  TeX Live has been developed since 1996 by collaboration between the TeX
  Users Group and the TeX user groups of the Czech Republic, France,
  Germany, India, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and the UK.

Would it be fair to say instead:
  
  TeX Live has been developed since 1996 by collaboration between
  virtually all <a href="/lugs.html">TeX user groups</a>.

instead of trying to list them all individually?  If people prefer to
write them all out explicitly, it's ok with me.  I'm just worried some
are missing.


Another question - any reason not to make the live sources
(/home/tlprod/Master) available for reading?  (That is, anon ftp/http.)
Heck, or just /home/tlprod in general, why bother singling out subdirs?


Thanks,
karl

so you really need to edit it using Perforce,
or your updates get zapped next time :-}

anyway, I have updated in Perforce so all is well

Kaja had feelings about this. I cannot remember what I think myself :-}
I certainly have no objections if you and Kaja want to do it; that is
to say, nothing on there is or should be secret.

It might well make even *more* sense to stick up the compressed packages
from TL8, if thats the way we go.

use-this-path and make-these-directories and run-these-commands to be
able to do tl development?

    Kaja had feelings about this.

Yes, she wrote me, I'll discuss it with her.

    It might well make even *more* sense to stick up the compressed packages
    from TL8, if thats the way we go.

Oh, isn't that decided :)?  I think it's the only way to go.  If Fabrice
or someone makes a live cd, we'll probably distribute that too, if not,
well ... Yikes.

Want to change the name to TeX Live 2003 also, as we discussed?  (Not
sure that version number is embedded anywhere or if it's just a
difference in the "advertising".)

Thanks,
karl

Quick and dirty:

mkdir /src/texlive
cd /src/texlive
export P4PORT=sun.dante.de:1666
export P4USER=yourusername
# create user
p4 user
# ..edit fields...
export P4CLIENT=..yourclientid...
# userid identifies you as user
# clientid identifies/dIstinguishes several instances for the same user

#
# create client
p4 client
# ...edit fields, or leave them as they are...
#
# now get the stuff andsome food ,-)
p4 sync


editing:
=======
p4 edit filename
# eg cd /src/texlive/p4-base/web/texlive; p4 edit index.html
# or p4 edit /src/texlive/p4-base/web/texlive/index.html
# or cd /src/texlive/p4-base ; p4 edit web/texlive/index.html
# or ... ;-)
#
# now the file is writeable for you, edit it
#
# after editing submit it, give explanation
p4 submit

Norbert's recipes also looked right to me. Though note
that by default you cannnot change things - you need to get

yes, my assumption is that this is "TL2003" until proved otherwise

Doubts rather than feelings :-) The purpose with /home/tlprod has been 
to ease the TeXLive production process (thus the name tlprod) - which 
essentially means building the CD images. Apart from that, tlprod is
a perforce client. And with perforce, the developers get current
software from the main depot (which is not located at tug.org).
I also thought that the entire Master tree was available for http 
from texlive.dante.de, so setting it up on tug.org didn't make sense
to me.

But: I checked texlive.dante.de today and couldn't find the master tree.
Has this been changed or did I think wrong?
 
Anyway, it changes the picture. 

Making /home/tlprod/Master mirror available to non-developers via ftp
will, I suppose, send a signal that this is a stable and tested 
environment. I am not sure this is the true picture - isn't there lots 
of ongoing work in the Master tree? On the other hand, people will have
an access to the latest stuff. So, let's do it (and hope it won't kill 
the server:)

 > nothing on there is or should be secret.

Nor has there ever been! The binaries, zipped sources and CD images 
have been available at ftp.tug.org for quite a time (sources and images 
are also mirrored by CTAN).

If it is or should be available on texlive.dante.de, I agree, we don't
need to do it on tug.org too.  (Although there'd be no harm in doing so.)

I see the master depot (I guess) at http://texlive.dante.de/perforce/,
but not any checked-out tree.

    Making /home/tlprod/Master mirror available to non-developers via ftp
    will, I suppose, send a signal that this is a stable and tested

I think it'll be ok, because we will say "these are the current

familiar with this concept from savannah and sourceforge, etc.  It's
only so outsiders have a chance to see what's current.

it isnt on texlive.dante.de any more. there is no
synced copy of it there (just the master), so its better if
tug.org has it

yes. the stable release is the CD image. anything else is subject to
change at any time... ie I would not want people relying on Master/texmf
is a production tree. I *could* maintain a complete parallel
development texmf tree, and leave the main one as stable, but I am
not altgether convinced its worth the hassle.

No, let's not do that.  Anyone who wants the stable source can get it,

I'm going to shoot someone. I used the only CD2 in my box of CD1s
(we bought 100 of them). Someone must have used the CDs to install
a Sun or something and put the disk back in the wrong box.  Grrr.

Sorry for wasting your time. Works perfectly -- as I would have

Subject: [tex-live] texmf trees directory layout
Message-ID: <9B4761B4-48BD-11D7-B286-000393D15FD8@rna.nl>

Currently, TL just has a texmf directory in the main TeX directory. 
teTeX has share/texmf for the same. I do not use TL here, but I assume 
TL has texmf-local for the local admin stuff as teTeX has 
share/texmf-local.

Now, I have been working for my Mac OS X redistribution (TL for 
binariesm teTeX for the basic texmf tree) to make a setup where the 
'programs' part is completely separated directory-wise from the 
'foundation' tree, to make separet updates possible.

My current setup is:
	share/texmf		- Whatever is installed by 'make install' in TL source
	share/texmf.tetex	- Contents of Thomas' latest teTeX foundation
	share/texmf.gwtex	- Additional packages I redistribute which are not 
in teTeX
	share/texmf.local	- Local admin stuff

Updating binaries replaces TeX/bin, TeX/lib etc and TeX/share/texmf
Updating foundation replaces TeX/share/texmf.tetex and 
TeX/share/texmf.gwtex

This separation works very well. Reinstalling or upgrading first 
removes the part for that install (i.e. updating TeX Porgrams first 
removes TeX/bin, etc and TeX/share/texmf), the same holds for TeX 
Foundation.

But I would like to give people the opportunity to keep a TeX Live 
setup up-to-date (program wise) with my TeX Program distribution using 
i-Installer. TL, however, does not separate the 'program support' part 
(like .pool files) from the 'foundation' part.

I would like to propose for TL to follow my example and separate the 
texmf trees that result from Master (foundation) and Build (program 
support). E.g.:

	texmf-bin			- For the program support part that results from make 
install in Build
	texmf-foundation	- For the Master part
and of course
	texmf-local		- For the local sysdamin part.

This independence is IMO good for structured maintenance. What do 
people think?

I have a similar problem: I want to use the texlive master tree, but
read only used from thex. Then local installed packages (mainly stuff
which is not allowed to enter texlive due to license problems), and then
those files which are automatically installed from texconfig init and
similar, this could also be the place of pool files etc.

I have it solved at the moment like this:
* /usr/TeX/bin/<arch>/*
	binaries compiled from source.development or source
* /usr/TeX/texmf
	only my texmf.cnf, nothing else, really NOTHING
	This texmf.cnf gives
		/src/p4-base/Master/texmf
		/usr/TeX/texmf-var
		/usr/TeX/texmf-local
	as paths
* /usr/TeX/texmf-var
	here all the stuff from texconfig is installed, I also put 
	pool files from the source.development binaries here
* /usr/TeX/texmf-local
	my stuff as explained above.

/usr/TeX/texmf and /usr/TeX/texmf-local can be merged of course!

Good point. Shared libraries should not be used if the binaries are
to be run from everywhere. People would have either to put the shared
libraries at a certain place in the filesystem (where the dynamic linker
looks by default or to a directory specified at compile-time) or fiddle
around with env-variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For the binaries that are distributed with TL, the shared libkpathsea
should not be used.

    libraries at a certain place in the filesystem (where the dynamic linker
    looks by default or to a directory specified at compile-time) or fiddle
    around with env-variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Does -R../lib work?  Or does it get translated into an absolute path
anyway?  Just a stray thought.  I definitely agree it will be much more
reliable not to use shared libraries in TL.  They are a monster.

        LDFLAGS="-R../lib";
leads to
        libtool: link: only absolute run-paths are allowed

Are these files needed in the repository? They are regenerated by
the makefile anyway.

sorry, if I am still named anywhere, it is purely
historical! I have not used fontinst for *years*....

Relative RPATH doesn't work on all platforms that support shared
libraries.

For TL, you shoudl configure with --disable-shared.

This can be made a default, I suppose...

Yes, they're needed for the bootstrap of ctangle.

Will you make it the default for kpathsea? Otherwise, I can put
  : ${enable_shared=no}
  export enable_shared
into tetex.ac.

[resending /kaja]
I am trying to install these programs with no success. I have followed the 
documantation to the letter.  Is there some sequence that should be followed?
TexLive says it loaded sucessfully, but under programs no icons or 
applications are available only the application box (blu & white.)  I hope you 
can help.  Thanks.

Just try a "make install" and see which files are installed.  It is much
than just the pool files. For teTeX, I have:
