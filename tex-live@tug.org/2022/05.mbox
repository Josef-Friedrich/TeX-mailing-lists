Subject: lacheck is confused when curly brackets are inside a \newcommand
In-Reply-To: <CABF6iw1LQX++whcEa1f=RjRO0EF9r+3F59np062uZB=8fCSogA@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <202204302218.23UMISKl030241@freefriends.org>

Hi Michael - thanks again for the report.

    \newcommand{\boldx}[1]{{\bf #1}}
    \newcommand{\ibx}[1]{\textbf{\textit{#1}}}
    ...
    "foo.tex", line 1: <- unmatched "}"

The immediate problem was that the { that starts the definition was
swallowed up by the pattern that started the definition. Hence the {
vs. } count mismatch. That is easy enough to fix, by incrementing the
count an extra time at the beginning.

Then there was a second problem that if a } was missing, no error was
reported. That is, if the def_group variable counting braces wasn't zero
at the end of the file. So I added:
<<EOF>> { 
	  if (def_count != 0)
	  {
	  	printf("\"%s\", line %d: %d missing right brace(s).\n",  
			file_name, line_count, def_count);
	  }

Then I noticed that the pattern matching \newcommand etc. did not try to
handle the * form of definitions, or the [N] argument count, or the
[dflt] optional argument default. Foolishly, I tried to add all that.
The regular expression is now pretty much a monster. (Unfortunately
[f]lex does not support "readable" regexps as in Perl's /x, as far as I
know.)

I feel almost certain that I introduced bugs somewhere in all that.
Here is what the regexp looks like now, together with a sort-of "human
translation" of the pieces I wrote for myself.

"\\"(provide|(re)?newcommand)[ \t\n]*(\*[ \t\n]*)?(\{\\[^}]+\}|\\([a-zA-Z]+|.))[ \t\n]*(\[[0-9]\](\[[^]]*\])?)?[ \t\n]*[^{]*\{	{ ++def_count; BEGIN(DEF); }

  /*                          ws     optional*    ({\cs}      |\cs)                     [N]?      [dflt]?             .*     {defn}
  ... */

I committed the changes in TL r63190, and bumped the lacheck version to 1.30.

I don't want to commit a new binary, but I made one for x86_64-linux and
put it at http://tug.org/~karl/lacheck-220501.gz for anyone who'd like
to give it a try. It doesn't depend on kpathsea or anything else, so
should be ok to just download and run from wherever.

Thanks,
Karl

P.S. If anyone wants to really take over lacheck maintenance, that
would be most excellent.

Hi Werner,

thanks a lot to you and the "digger" for the reports.

Sounds bad, and a reason to be removed.

Is this also for arabtex?

Hmm, that is tricky. In cc.cls there is no printed output, so this text
is nowhere shown, and the interpretation
	"a macro stating some license conditions is occurring in a
	document forces the document to this license"
is quite absurd to me. I guess there is an independent license statement
for the package itself.

Indeed, the docs have to go. Not the only ones that had to go in TL.

Thanks again.

(But sorry, leaving for camping right now ..)

Seems so as this is from arabtex.doc/doc/latex/arabtex/arabtex.faq from 1993
... don't know who has added lppt.txt afterwards

or a reason to talk with the author first ?!

Klaus Lagally is still around and quite active,
visiting the (now for a long time virtual-only( Stuttgart TeX "stammtisch" ("pub meeting") every month.

shall I ask him at our next meeting (every 2nd Tuesday in month, so next time May 10),
or do you have a "standardised process" before kicking out packages ?


thanks,

Harald

All the more as arabtex is a *very* important, fundamental package.
In my opinion a way should be found for everything, documentation
included, to stay.

Hello, Harald,

This is not about the license of arabtex, but a request to please say
hello to Klaus for me, and give him my best wishes.  Someday I hope to
be able to travel again, and may be able to get somewhere to say hello
for myself.

Thanks, and happy spring.

The author (Lagally), I believe. My understanding is that the package is
under the LPPL and that stray statement in the FAQ is obsolete.
I wrote Prof. Lagally to confirm/deny this.

The font files (hcaption.mf hcbase.mf hclassic.mf) were evidently
created by one Joel M. Hoffman in Rye, New York, circa 1991. I haven't
found a way to contact him yet. If anyone else has any luck searching,
please let me know. Anyway, I'll remove those files if too much time goes
by without any success, lacking any other course of action :(.

This looks like a false positiv as the license digger does not speak
TeX not LaTeX but the code is

 \newenvironment{acknowledge}{%
   \section*{\ccacknowledgementsname}%
   \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\ccacknowledgementsname}%
 }{%
   \noacknowledge
 }
 \newcommand{\noacknowledge}{%
   \ifKV at ccsps@openaccess\if at ccack\else%
   \noindent{\small\@octxt\par}%
   \fi\fi%

 \openchoicetext{This article is distributed under the terms of the
   Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any
   noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,
   provided the original author(s) and source are credited.}%

and the README of computational-complexity simply states LPPL as
license.  In other words, only the author can marks his/her article
with CC-by-NC-A by using the environment `acknowledge' and even
the author can overwrite the used text.

Hi,

due to missed texexample.sty in computational-complexity.doc it is not
possible to create ccquickref.pdf out of ccquickref.tex.   After
running `latex cc.ins` all required files to create ccquickref.pdf
are there.

Well I saw the question but there is no minimal example and so I
couldn't test. But from the error message the first thing I would
check is if the xindy modules are in

C:\texlive\2022\texmf-dist\xindy\modules

and if not to (re)install xindy.

OK, I'll ask her to provide a MCE.

IIRC, such modules were in this directory.

She already reinstalled completely the TeX Live (2022).

Possibly the GNU LGPL was intended; that's how CTAN classified it, and
my web searches turn up no other instances of "Limited General Product

Anyway ... the package author is Nicholas Setzer, who was at umd.edu,

https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-setzer-42b04296
(linkedin sometimes bounces me out, other times lets me in ...)

but I can't find a working email address for him with some basic
searches (all three of the above bounced).  If anyone else can delve
further and find another address to try, please let me know.  Else I
guess I'll have to remove the package. -k

Message-ID: <783f24c8-ef75-978d-37c0-f37a8f0a45a3@latex-project.org>

Hi folks,

reviewing the index for TLC3 (which is rather large) gave me a small 
heart attack it came out rather scrambled after upgrading to TL22

I gut it down the a reasonable size:

input:

\indexentry {foo}{I-13}
\indexentry {foo}{I-15}
\indexentry {foo}{I-16}
\indexentry {foo}{I-17}
\indexentry {foo}{II-10}
\indexentry {foo}{II-20}

with darwin-universal/makexindex (no options no style no nothing) from 
TL22 I get

   \item foo, II-10, II-20, I-13, I-15--I-17

upmendex does it correctly and so does makeindex in TL21 and TL20, all 
giving

   \item foo, I-13, I-15--I-17, II-10, II-20

as expected

---------

Ulrike confirmed that it is also a problem on windows and with miktex, 
so not a question of MacOS

cheers
frank

Hi Frank,

Thank you for your report.
I guess my commit r60547 made the degrade.
https://tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=60547

For workaround,
it seems fixed by explicit definition of page_precedence in *.ist.

pp1.ist :

page_precedence "nR"

or

pp2.ist :

page_precedence "Rn"

I will study the issue of page_precedence again.

Best,
Takuji

Hi

First a word about this year's TeX Conference (online 22-24 July, and
free). There's renewed interest in the TeX/LaTeX community in
accessibility, with 6 important talks on it last year (including my own).
This year I'll be talking about "Access and Accessibility". It's based on a
comment by Jonathan Godfrey (a blind lecturer in statistics), that sighted
people not having easy access to tools that generate accessible content is
a major obstacle.

Today's TeX Hour is about Access to TeX and related tools. In particular,
it's about allowing a working environment on one machine to be accurately
(even exactly) reproduced on another machine. The focus tomorrow is on
fonts and TeX macros, but the methods apply much more widely.

Here's the link for tomorrow's TeX Hour: Thursday 12 April, 6:30 to 7:30pm
UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Note: Both the UK and USA are on Summer Time. UK Time Now:
https://time.is/UK.

Back to tools for accurately reproducing an environment. I hope in time
these methods will help visually impaired users share their software
situation and configuration with others. In particular, an easy method of
creating a truly reproducible problem, fault and bug reports. And
reproducible solutions.

If you're interested in this, or would like to contribute to the TeX
Conference please do get in touch. By the way, one of the keynote speakers
is an expert in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture, which
is widely used for technical documention.
https://www.routledge.com/Creating-Intelligent-Content-with-Lightweight-DITA/Evia/p/book/9780815393825
https://tug.org/tug2022/

Now for the technical stuff about tomorrow's TeX Hour. After a long battle
between my stubborness and my stupidity, I've made a sideways move that
greatly takes me forward. Briefly, I've created a folder
/git-alt-obj/texlive on my PC that contains all the non-binary files in the
TeX Live installations from 2010 to 2022. At present it occupies 33G, but
once duplicates are removed I expect it will be less than 8G.

Because it uses git pack files subsets and minor variations in the content
will be inexpensive. In git, branches are cheap, because only the
differences are recorded. Proceeding in this way for TeX/LaTeX, Python,
Pandoc and other tools it will I hope be rather easier to create and share
software environments for creating accessible documents, and to report and
reproduce problems when they arise.

Here's the tool I wrote and used to turn a folder into a git pack file
https://github.com/jfine2358/scratch/blob/y2022p008/pack_dir.sh

And here's a description of how I use it's output. I'll talk about that,
and how to remove duplicates and how to subset and distribute the nearly
approximately 1,850,000 files in /git-alt-obj/texlive/pack.

wishing you happy, safe and reproducible TeXing

Jonathan

PS. Do get in touch with me if you're interested in this year's TeX
conference, as participant or even as a contributor. Perhaps we could have
an accessibility panel. I'd like that.

Subject: Support request for providing the TeX Live Docker images
Message-ID: <acc400c7-f65a-80a6-699a-6bc9d04d9c79@gmail.com>

Hi list,

For a few years, we have been providing the more or less official TL 
docker images at https://hub.docker.com/r/texlive/texlive (repository at 
https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive). This especially includes 
the latest TeX Live from net installer (in four flavors: no src/no doc 
tree, with src/no doc tree, no src/with doc tree, with src/with doc 
tree) and historic images (i.e. from previous years' final ISO images).

Up to now, all these images and flavors have been built using GitLab CI 
which was very easy to set up and use for us. However, as of this year, 
TL has grown to a size where the GitLab provided capacities does not 
allow us to build the latest TL image with src/with doc tree anymore. 
And for historic images it even fails to build the barebones ones even 
for as small ones as TL 2014.

There are two properties of the GitLab runners that fail here:

- The CI runners have a job timeout of 3 hours. Especially with historic 
images where only few mirrors are available we regularly get timeouts.

- The CI runners are limited to approx. 20 GB of space. With all the 
Docker setup this starts to fail when images reach approx. 5 GiB of 
space which the `latest-doc-src` image (and actually the images with 
documentation and sources of previous years) are reaching.

So here we are looking for alternatives to continue providing these 
images. Our Dockerfiles are fully functional, so it is really only a 
matter of build capacity. We are open to all alternatives. The essential 
two alternatives we have thought of:

- setting up an own GitLab CI runner on some hardware (which hardware?)
- build somewhere else (some server or GitHub actions or something that 
copes with the large images).

Essentially, what we need either way is longer job timeouts and more 
available disk space (approx. 30?40 GB of free space for building). RAM 
and network bandwidth are actually not a bottleneck because in this kind 
of setup, we are mostly limited by the mirrors and TL installation is 
primarily disk I/O-heavy.

For both options outlined above we lack capacities. So we are looking 
for help on that or advise on other options.

Just to have it mentioned somewhere: Until we have found some kind of 
replacement, we cannot continue providing all image flavors.

If anyone has ideas how we can continue providing all Docker images or 
would be willing to help us implement a new build infrastructure, we are 
eagerly waiting for ideas.

Greetings from the island!

Cheerio,

Paulo

Hi Paulo,

first of all: Thank you!

In case if it would be enough to offer a host for the runners I probably 
can help with that.

Best,

Hi Paulo - does anyone actually use +src/-doc and -src/+doc, that is,
only one or the other? I would expect people to either want "everything"
(+src/+doc) or "as little as possible" (-src/-doc). (Also, src is tiny
compared to doc, and thus presumably relatively unimportant wrt building.)

I'm glad other people have come forward to discuss options. --best, karl.

I can think of texdoc.org, which uses -src/+doc. :)

As we speak, we are testing some options. Thanks so much to everyone who 
offered help via mailing list and offline. I promise to write a follow 
up once we have done a couple of experiments. :)

Dear TeX Live developers,

we got a report [1] about typos in manual pages in TL 2018. According to 
my research they still apply in 2022. Please be so kind to fix them.

Further the lintian report [2] complains about further typos in TL 
binaries and manual pages. Look for "typo-in-manual-page" & 
"spelling-error-in-binary" on that web page. I did not check if all of 
them still apply, but most should. Please be so kind to check them too.

If you need patches, let me know.

Hi Hilmar,

    [1] https://bugs.debian.org/991944

I don't remember seeing that one before. Sure, will fix.

    [2] https://lintian.debian.org/sources/texlive-bin

Egad, what a disheartening list.

    If you need patches, let me know.

Yes please, that would be most appreciated. Also, a few of those
reports need to go upstream from TL -- for example, pmxab, scorprt,
xml2pmx are maintained by Bob Tennent <rdt at cs.queensu.ca>.

By the way, the no-manual-page list seems somehow incorrect.
For example, upbibtex.1 does exist in TL, with a single line:
.so man1/pbibtex.1
I believe a number of the others (not all) are handled in the same way.

Thanks,
Karl

Let me know if you can take over some patch hunks or if they are not 
useful at all.

Thanks for the pointer. I'll have a look at this. As you noticed the 
report is quite old and things improved in the meantime.

Taking a look, it should be no problem to apply this, although it will
be some time before I have the chance to actually do so. Thanks Hilmar!

The one thing that comes to mindthat would also help is ChangeLog

Hi,

I'm using TeXLive 2022 on MacOS (thru TeXShop/MacTeX).
A program that was runing with TeXLive2021 does not succeed with TeXLive 2022.
This program get a list of all available fonts for luaotfload and comes from 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14162/how-do-i-get-a-list-of-all-available-fonts-for-luaotfload (version 2015).

Today I get the followong error:

This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.15.0 (TeX Live 2022)  (format=lualatex 2022.4.6)  18 MAY 2022 21:32
...
cannot open /Users/jacquesandre/Library/texlive/2022/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/luaotfload-names.luc

Looking at this place, I find a file named luaotfload-names.luc.zip
If I decompress it (at this place), my program works.

Probably an error when making the TeXLive file ?

Thanks,

Jacques Andr?

I would be *very* surprised if that's really the name of the file. More
likely it's a .gz file and not a .zip.

No, your script just isn't compatible with the new version. Newer
luaotfload version always compress the font name database to save disk
space and improve performance on systems with slow drives.

You can look at the manpage of luaotfload.conf(5) if you want to turn
off compression.

Marcel

Issue
-----
Both `pdflatex` and `lualatex` executables come from TL 2022: 

  ?????
  ? $ which pdflatex 
  ? /home/bitouze/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/pdflatex
  ? $ which lualatex 
  ? /home/bitouze/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/lualatex
  ?????

but, for the `letgut` class I'm working on, the `letgut.cls` file taken
in account is the one in:

- TEXMFHOME with `pdflatex`,
- TEXMFDIST with `lualatex`.

Indeed, the `.log` file deriving from the compilation of the following
MCE:

  ?????
  ? \documentclass{letgut}
  ? \begin{document}
  ? Foo
  ? \end{document}
  ?????

contains:

- with `pdflatex`:
  ?????
  ? /home/bitouze/texmf/tex/latex/letgut/letgut.cls
  ?????
- with `lualatex`:
  ?????
  ? /home/bitouze/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/lualatex/letgut/letgut.cls
  ?????

Weird, isn't it?

No, it is not. The search path, shown by
	kpsewhich -progname lualatex -show-path .cls
prefers TEXMF/tex/lualatex over TEXMF/tex/latex. But for pdflatex, the lualatex path is not in the
search path. Thus, lualatex finds a different file.

OK, found: in my TEXMFHOME, the `letgut` directory should in `lualatex`
and not in `latex`. Sorry for the noise.

Hi Karl

Yes, you are running dvips from /usr/bin it seems, which is the gentoo
install I guess.

You have to update the PATH so that 
	/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/ARCH/
is put in front of /usr/bin.

Thanks for the hint to what to look for.

And to Norbert, yes, I put the texlive bin dir. later in the PATH,
soo I can hopefully identify lingering packages, not all are named
*tex*, and some needed are called tex-something.

The problem is that TeX from the linux distros is often incomplete and
not all binaries are included. It can thus happen that sometimes a
binary from the linux distro is used, sometimes the one from TL.
That's why TL should be at the beginning of the PATH, otherwise in the
best case the results are inconsistent, but quite often you use a
strange mixture of incompatible files which leads to strange errors. I
saw a lot of errors caused by mixing the linux distro and TL TeX.

Hence I wanted texlive, and I didn't need to change the build.

But I kindof wanted to get rid of unneeded packages...

You can make a list of the files in the CTAN texlive bin directory and
then either search for the files with same name in /usr/bin or  use
"type" on each name:

>From years of experience with a range of tex systems and OS's, I can
report that stray programs with names that clash with TeX Live are an
all too common source of weird errors.  Some users learn from the
internet to cure "program not found" by copying "program" to
the directory with their document and putting "." in the PATH.

Something like:

 for f in $('ls' -1 /usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux|head) ; do
   type $(basename $f)
 done | grep -Fv 'not found'

with the texlive directory removed from the PATH should generate a
list of name clashes with stuff found elsewhere on your PATH.

Do you want tools such as this in the texlive dist ?

Since I have texlive in the end part of PATH, I don't have to change
PATH.

Good starting point, but that one also finds data files and directories,
so the one below works better.

///
find /usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/x86_64-linux/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -executable |
while read a; do which `basename $a`; done |
egrep '^(/usr|/usr/local)?/bin' > list
///
cat list |
while read a; do grep -l $a /var/db/pkg/*/*/CONTENTS; done |
sort -u |
sed -e 's/^\/var\/db\/pkg\///; s/\/CONTENTS$//' > list2
///
 list2:
app-crypt/rhash-1.4.2
app-forensics/magicrescue-1.1.10
app-text/dvipng-1.17
app-text/dvisvgm-2.12
app-text/lcdf-typetools-2.108-r1
app-text/ps2eps-1.68
app-text/ps2pkm-1.8_p20210325-r1
app-text/psutils-1.17-r3
app-text/t1utils-1.42
app-text/teckit-2.5.10
app-text/ttf2pk2-2.0_p20210325
app-text/xdvik-22.87.03-r3
media-gfx/imagemagick-7.1.0.13

I get a list of 34 binaries from 13 packages on gentoo, and on devuan:

cat list |
while read a; do grep -l $a /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list; done |
cut -f1 -d: |
sort -u |
sed -e 's/^\/var\/lib\/dpkg\/info\///; s/\.list$//'

Dear texlive maintainers,

Would it maybe be possible to exceptionally update dvisvgm to the current version of 2.13.4 during the year?

Currently, TL includes version 2.13.4, which is no longer compatible with the current version of ghostscript, see this issue https://github.com/mgieseki/dvisvgm/issues/183

Or could anybody give me pointers where to find `kpathsea.h` which seems to be necessary to build dvisvgm from source? I can't find it anywhere in my texlive installation. 

Cheers,
Sam

kpathsea.h is a generated header, which is written during kpathsea
build.

Sorry I was out of mail for a few days?
Here what I got:
 
MacBook-Air-de-Jacques:~ jacquesandre$ luafindfont -n "*"
We are using Lua 5.3
Looking for font "*"
Check for file /Users/jacquesandre/Library/texlive/2022/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/luaotfload-names
 No. Fontname  Path


Note that a colleague of mine has exactly the same problem (actually he has shown me first this problem, then I tried myself).

Futhermore, in the log file of the quoted program, I have (before LuaLaTeX stops) the following lines (that quotes the .gz file I mentioned (as .zip by error) in my previous mail):
(/usr/local/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls

Thanks for help.

It looks like an empty font list files#

run

luaotfload-tool --cache=purge --force --update

and then try again to run your example.

Message-ID: <202205222135.24MLZHZc005118@freefriends.org>

    Would it maybe be possible to exceptionally update dvisvgm to the
    current version of 2.13.4 during the year?

Akira has already updated the Windows binary.
Maybe that is enough?

Or, on
    https://github.com/mgieseki/dvisvgm/issues/183

MartinG suggested another workaround by setting an envvar.

  yes, it should be possible to [un]set `NEWPDF` via environment variable
  [`GS_OPTIONS`]
  (https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.56.1/Use.htm#Environment_variables),
  e.g. with `export GS_OPTIONS=-dNEWPDF=false`. Both the GS executable
  and the GS library consider this variable, so it should work in
  conjunction with dvisvgm as well.

I am not enthused about rebuilding now, but dvisvgm would be easier than
most, so ... not impossible. -k

May be I should re-install TeXLive 2022?

Hi Karl,

Thank you for bringing up the idea to do this via environment variables! This is a viable workaround for me on mac os. 

Cheers,

Hi Frank, all,

I have committed patches of makeindex r63361, r63365
in order to improve heuristic detection of page numbers between roman number and alphabet.
The new algorism will fix issues caused by ambiguous inputs.
The new test cases are included in Build/sources/texk/makeindexk/tests/
https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/makeindexk/tests/
It is still heuristic and not perfect,
but will correctly detect roman number and alphabet in most realistic cases.

I think makeindex in TL20 or earlier will fail to detect roman number in the following input.
I do not think TL21 is worse than TL20 or earlier.

input:

\indexentry {foo}{i-13}
\indexentry {foo}{i-15}
\indexentry {foo}{i-16}
\indexentry {foo}{i-17}
\indexentry {foo}{ii-10}
\indexentry {foo}{ii-20}

Best,
Takuji

Better to do some further investigation first so you don't just get the
same issue.

Have you previously installed other TeX software?   Try:

1. Use "type luaoftload-tool" to check for the install path.  For macTeX
you should see:

 % type luaotfload-tool

luaotfload-tool is /Library/TeX/texbin/luaotfload-tool

1. make a note of the size and timestamps of files in
"~/Library/texlive/2022/texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/".
The files should be owned by you.

2. repeat the "luaotfload-tool --cache=purge --force --update" but using
the full
path for "luaoftload-tool", e.g. for macTeX, use:

/Library/TeX/texbin/luaotfload-tool --cache=purge --force --update

This should take some time to run.  Compare file sizes and timestamps.

Indeed I get
$ type luaotfload-tool
luaotfload-tool is /Library/TeX/texbin/luaotfload-tool

Sorry I just forgot to make point 1. I made (twice?)

For information, from terminal I have:

luaotfload-lookup-cache.lua	luaotfload-names.luc.gz

And if unzip the luaotfload-names.luc.gz file, my TeX program works fine.

Subject: Biber version in win64
Message-ID: <e08edb06-826c-53d0-77ad-2fc4980a92be@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the 64-bit windows binaries from Akira Kakuto 
(https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/win32/TLW64) in parallel with the 
regular binaries, and noticed that

with

C:\texlive\2022\bin\win32>biber --version
biber version: 2.17

everything is fine, but with

C:\texlive\2022\bin\win64>biber --version
biber version: 2.16

I get

"This means that your biber (2.16) and biblatex (3.17) versions are 
incompatible."

Would it be possible to upgrade the biber binary in win64?

Thanks,

Pedro Carneiro

(My apologies but my mail client is misbehaving.  This should be
proper plain text)

We?ve recently encountered a build failure while building TeXLive from
source in Hombrew.  The root cause appears to be that
https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/commit/0b14c16fc71723576a31b0164f1580785af867ee
added the file ?texk/web2c/mfluadir/potrace/config.h? which shares its
name with ?texk/web2c/w2c/config.h?.

The ordering of the CPPFLAGS in ?texk/web2c/Makefile.in? is
?$(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(libmfluapotrace_a_CPPFLAGS)? which
resolves to ?-I. -I./w2c -I./mfluadir/potrace?, which unfortunately
will pick up ?w2c/config.h? before ?mfluadir/potrace/config.h?.

I believe this is the wrong file, and ?w2c/config.h? includes
?kpathsea/config.h? which is not in the ?web2c? directory and causes
the build to fail.

We circumvented this problem in Homebrew by changing
?$(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(libmfluapotrace_a_CPPFLAGS)? to
?$(libmfluapotrace_a_CPPFLAGS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES)? in the
Makefile.in so that ?mfluadir/potrace/config.h? is found before
?w2c/config.h?.  However I think a better solution here would be to
just rename ?mfluadir/potrace/config.h? to something like
?mfluadir/potrace/potrace_config.h?.  I am happy to send out a patch
that changes this along with the relevant include statements in the
other files in ?mfluadir/potrace?, but I wanted to get some idea of
whether this makes sense to do.  It?s possible that this has not
caused failures in other systems because the inclusion of config.h by
files in ?mfluadir/potrace? is conditional on ?HAVE_CONFIG_H? being
defined, which does happen for us in Homebrew but may not occur in
other environments.

Hi

The subject for tonight's TeX Hour is Technical Debt. I'm particularly
interested in small problems that can be easily solved, and in hard
problems that cause catastrophic risk. All contributions are welcome,
particularly those related to TeX, accessibility and technical
documentation.

Here's the details: Thursday 26 May, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

And here's some definitions. According to Wikipedia

In software development, technical debt (also known as design debt or code
> debt) is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy
> (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take
> longer.


 In open source software, postponing sending local changes to the upstream
> project is a form of technical debt.


Also according to Wikipeda

"You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI) is a principle which arose from extreme
> programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality
> until deemed necessary.
>


> XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: "Always implement things when you
> actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."

Finally, Blaise Pascal in 1657 apologised for sending a long letter because
he didn't have sufficient time to write a short one. See

Hi Daniel - thanks for the report and all the details. I think
HAVE_CONFIG_H is pretty universally defined, since it's a consequence of
TL using automake, so I'm not sure why this is not failing for everyone.

Be that as it may, it seems to me that potrace/config.h should not be
committed at all. Its two non-admin lines are
#define VERSION "1.16"
#define HAVE_INTTYPES_H 1

Leaving VERSION aside, HAVE_INTTYPES_H is only known at configure time,
and varies depends on the local system.  So it is just wrong to have
that defined in the source tree.

Instead, it should be generated by configure and written into the build
tree, like Work/texk/web2c/web2c/w2c/config.h and plenty more. Then it
will be found first, via the "-I.", I believe.

Luigi?

FWIW, regarding w2c/config.h, looking at it now, it would be cleaner for
everything that includes it to explicitly say #include <w2c/config.h>,
as there are config.h files everywhere.  Unfortunately I don't know when
I'll have the energy to look into that.

Also, regarding Makefile.in, of course it is generated from Makefile.am,
so it can't be edited (in TL). As it happens, there was some recent
discussion on the automake list related to the ordering of CPPFLAGS, but
I don't know what the outcome of that will be.

Thanks again for the report,
Karl

Whilst the contents of "perl5.30.1.exe" are reasonably predictable, 
those of "Makefile.PL" are not.? I would therefore suggest that you 
re-post, this time including the contents of "Makefile.PL".

Hello Roman,

 > for Tk extension to perl Thank you.

Perl version 5.30.1 is older than the version provided by TeX Live
(5.34.0).  If the version of Perl you installed yourself breaks
anything in TeX Live you could try to type

   tlmgr conf texmf TEXLIVE_WINDOWS_TRY_EXTERNAL_PERL 0

on the command line.  Regarding the last argument: 0 means 'false' and
1 means 'true'.  Perl scripts shipped with TeX Live will then use the
Perl provided by TeX Live.  The drawback is that scripts requiring
non-standard Perl modules will not work.

A better solution is to remove your local Perl installation, install
version 5.34.0, and try again.  But please check whether the new Perl
works with TeX Live before you try to install additional modules.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Roman, apparently you have TL 2020 installed. Since we are not equipped
to support or debug old versions, I advise you to replace your
installation with the current one, 2022, and try again.

Also: the included perl is intended just to support the TL
infrastructure. For other uses, you are on your own.

By the way: tlshell is a Tcl/Tk script, serving as a front end to
the Perl script tlmgr.

Although tlmgr has a GUI mode of its own, using Perl/Tk, the Perl/Tk
module is not part of the included Perl for Windows anymore.
