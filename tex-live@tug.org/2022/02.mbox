Hi everyone - now that we're here in February, wanted to send a note to
encourage package and program releases sooner rather than later. This
year's TeX Live pretest is planned to start Feb 25
(https://tug.org/texlive), although we may push that a few days earlier.
The basic sources look to be in pretty good shape already.

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: TeX Hour tonight: The context for TeX // next week: Case study on
 accessibility of CLI

Hi

Reminder: TeX Hour tonight, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

The topic will be Basics: The social, economic and technical context for
TeX: Past, present and future.

The past will start the release on 1 May 1840 of the Penny Black, the
world's first postage stamp. It was part of changes as revolutionary then
as email was in the 1970s. The bank note printer Perkins Bacon produced the
Penny Black, and they were sold at the Post Office. Today many of us pay
electronically for a barcode label which we print ourselves.

In modern language, each Penny Black was a fungible token, and the barcode
label a non-fungible token.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Black
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token

The future will conclude with two definitions.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography*: *Typography is the art and
technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and
appealing when displayed.

Me, last week: Modern Typography for the Blind is the art and technique of
audible, tactile and interaction conventions that make written language
legible, readable and appealing when rendered for a blind person.

Reminder: TeX Hour tonight, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Looking forward, next week the TeX Hour will be a case study of a paper on
"Accessibility of Command Line Interfaces" by Sampath, Merrick and Macvean
(all at Google, Seattle).

HTML & PDF: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445544
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b_dlMBUAw8

In part we will follow McLuhan, that
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message.

Of particular interest to LaTeX users is that some of the CLI examples are
inaccessible in PDF, and in HTML rendered as an image together with a
no-display paragraph giving a figure description.

Of interest to all is that screen shots seem to be the lingua franca
(bridge language) for sharing CLI interactions on a web page.

wishing you Happy TeXing

Jonathan

Ah, I regret that I have no experience of the portable version. Probably 
best to re-send your request for help to the TeX Live list (cc'd), where 
the /real e/xperts reside.

Hello.

I?m having trouble uninstalling TeX Live 2021 because there is no ?uninst.bat? file in installation directory, nor control panel entry for TeX Live.

I installed TeX Live 2021 via ISO image (double-clicking ?install-tl-windows.bat? file in it) on Windows 10. On the installer, the only thing I did is I changed the installation directory, toggled "Portable setup" on installer, which made options "Adjust searchpath" and "Desktop integration" grey, and then clicked install. After checking that installation had succeeded, I found TeX Live was not added in control panel and environment PATH. Now I want to uninstall the whole TeX Live 2021 and re-install it, but I couldn?t find the uninst.bat file in ?<texlive_root>\tlpkg\installer? directory.

So do you know how to get my TeX Live uninstalled under such condition (and hopefully without side effects?)

Best Regards,

Olivier

Hi,?
I am trying to install TeX Live 2021 on my windows 10 computer (x64).
I have downloaded the install-tl.zip archive from https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html
I unzipped it and then ran install-tl-windows.bat as administrator.
After running the standard installation, it fails because I have decompression errors on the packages whose name contains *.win32.*,??but not only.

Here is an overview of the logs (for information "Le chemin d'acc?s sp?cifi? est introuvable" = "The specified access path cannot be found."):

As far as I know, a portable setup does not require any modifications on 
your computer so you can simply delete the installation directory.

Installation failures may be due to 'version skew', i.e. the
repository is being updated during the installation, and may no
longer match the local file database. Just try again, preferably
with selecting a smaller scheme after clicking the advanced button.

Subject: tlmgr and installation of binaries
Message-ID: <20220209080521.419eafb5@cervin>

Hi All,
     I have recently installed TL 2021 with the DVD. Everything has worked flawlessly
but the binaries for some less common architectures are not provided on the DVD.

I plan to install the binaries for Linux musl and Netbsd. By passing the
command "tlmgr info" these binaries are shown and are marked as not installed
(which is what is expected).

My question is now how to install all the binaries with one command, since
the display of the "tlmgr info" command shows all the packages for the binary programs
individually (and there is a lot of package to install).

Thanks for your help,

Best regards

Hi Pierre,

> My question is now how to install all the binaries with one command, since

Reading the man page of tlmgr, the output of tlmgr help, or the web
page, will give you
	tlmgr platform add x86_64-linuxmusl
for example. But for this you need to use the CTAN mirror (which you
probably do anyway since the installer by default switches the
installation source to CTAN).

Hope that helps

Will that not add just /one/ binary with one command, Norbert (the 
binary for "linuxmusl") ?? Pierre says that he is looking for a command 
that will install /all/ the binaries with one command.

Hi Norbert,
    Thanks it works. I have missed this command when I have read
the documentation.

The binary which I explicitly mentioned in my message, and which you 
have for some inexplicable reason removed from the quoted part of the 
reply :? ? (the binary for "linuxmusl").? As I said in my earlier 
message, this is just /one/ binary, whereas Pierre quite clearly writes 
that he wants to install "all the binaries with one command".? I know 
that English is not your first language, Norbert, but even you must be 
able to see the difference between a command that will install just one 
binary and a command that will install /all/ the binaries.

Hello,
I would like to help to calm down the discussion:
As I understood the (third paragraph of the) initial post, Pierre asked 
how to install the binaries for all architectures at once. If that was 
the question, it would of course be quite cumbersome to call the command 
for all provided architectures individually. So the "educated guess" 
would be something like "all available binaries". Could of course be 
quite many.
With kind wishes
Alois

The second paragraph said 

"I plan to install the binaries for Linux musl and Netbsd"

These are only two architectures and so Norberts answer was quite
suitable.

Well, Ulrike, if you believe that installing */two /*binaries with */two 
/*commands is "quite suitable" for someone who asks "how to install 
*/all /*the binaries with */one /*command", then you and I must have 
very different views on suitability.? OK, it will result in two binaries 
being installed, but it is hardly an answer to Pierre's question.? If 
Pierre had asked how to poach an egg, and Norbert had told him how to 
fry one, would you have also felt that that was a "quite suitable" reply ?

I have over 500 binaries in my bin folder and that is only for one
architecture (windows). So Pierre will get over 1000 with two
commands which imho is what he wanted (as he already confirmed).

OK, so now you are suggesting that when Pierre wrote "My question is now 
how to install all the binaries with one command", he was implying "all 
the binaries /for one specific architecture/". That is a possible 
interpretation, I agree, but that was certainly not how I interpreted 
Pierre in the first place.

Philip,

since you really really really really try hard to NOT understand, let me
spell it out for you one by one ...

x86_64-linuxmusl is a *platform*, like *win32*. That means, it
incorporates *all* (400+) binaries of that very platform.

This is something *different* the *binary*.

Pierre asked about how to install *all* binaries of *one* platform, and
I gave him the correct answer.

And to make it even easier for you, since obviously there is some
deficit:

Platforms are 

aarch64-linux/  amd64-netbsd/  i386-cygwin/   i386-linux/   i386-solaris/      win32/          x86_64-darwinlegacy/  x86_64-linuxmusl/
amd64-freebsd/  armhf-linux/   i386-freebsd/  i386-netbsd/  universal-darwin/  x86_64-cygwin/  x86_64-linux/         x86_64-solaris/

Binaries are:

pdftex etex dvips xetex ....


The command I sent is
	tlmgr platform add ...
which adds a **platform**, not a single binary.


Hope now it is a bit clearer to you. Everyone else already grasped it,
though.

All the best

Norbert

That is a possible interpretation, as I have already said in my reply to 
Ulrike, but it is not the interpretation which I placed on Pierre's 
words :? to me, he appeared to be asking how to install "/all///the 
binaries for /all/ the platforms".

Hi,

to be even more specific, as the help says tlmgr platfor add accepts a
list of platforms which means that you can just type (or copy&paste)
identifiers of the platforms. And if you know the shell and have the
list of platforms elsewhere, you can type (in bash) export
PLATFORMS=... (add the identifiers of platforms) and then use  tlmgr
platform add $PLATFORMS. Or if you have the list of platforms in a
file, you can use xargs. Thus Norbert's answer says how to add
binaries for all platforms by a single command.

To install just the binaries for 2 architectures, there wouldn't be "a 
lot of package to install".

(To me it seems a quite unnecessary discussion between a native British 
and an Austrian to correctly interpret the question by a French. There 
can always appear some unclear formulations.)

The answer by Zdenek seems to solve the problem, but one needs a (long) 
list of available packages.

Peace to all our friends!

I would suggest that you do what the OP did. Run

  tlmgr info win32 
or 
  tlmgr info linuxmusl

to get a list of all packages you need to install for the win32 or
the linuxmusl architecture. And then come back and tell if this are
a lot or not.

Both tlmgr -gui and tlshell let you select platforms from a list
once the repository is loaded.

Ok, that helps; thank you very much for the explanation.

I got it now, that there is an intermediate level (packages) between the 
individual binaries and the architectures. I misunderstood the OP, 
thinking that he asked for all architectures (he really asked only for 2 
of these; but in my wrong understanding packages and architectures were 
the same level.)

With kind wishes

Alois

Message-ID: <CA+6hu7ee_xhhuR_4o=V3mhxnRMJQN1O7dLPYfdB3rVGeO=r7Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

when I run `tlmgr update --list --self` on Windows with recent tlmgr, a
`nul` file appears in the working directory, which is very annoying as it
is not removable in Windows Explorer and really does not play nicely with
git (which bothers me most).

After some deep digging, I think I have found the place where the issue
originates:
https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/blob/fc5589360e8051b3c578d09ad6afdc212d375267/texk/tests/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm#L4164.
Note that if I provide a concrete repository, everything runs as expected.
Seems like the issue indeed appears only if tlmgr tries to resolve the
mirror when you use the default repository, i.e., `ctan`.

Many thanks for looking into this!

Best regards
Jan Net?k

Good sleuthing! I installed the following change, which tells wget to
use stdout for its log output, instead of using the "null device"
directly as the value for -O, which is presumably what is creating the
"nul" file you're seeing. Then redirect stdout to the null device, just
as we already redirect stderr.

I may rue the decision, but I'm pushing this out tonight, along with
(unrelated) workarounds for Mac cert woes. Fingers crossed. --thanks, karl.

Interesting ... I thought we have used this since ages and
	-O nul
works on Windows ...

Siep, anyone on Windows, can you confirm that a "nul" file is generated
when calling wget -O nul ... ?

Very peculiar, but since it is Windows, nothing new.

Best

Norbert

Not here, not under Windows 7.  But I believe that the "null" device
should actually be specified as "nul:", not just "nul".  As in "con:".
etc. Maybe try adding the colon.

Interestingly, under Windows 11, when I run `wget ctan.org -O nul` in CMD
with wget.exe shipped with texlive, I got no nul file. JN

As Philip wrote, the null device should be nul: with a colon, it is
consistent with drive letters. It probably used to work without the
colon in previous versions and has been changed recently. I have only
Windows XP and Windows 7 thus I cannot check whether -O nul: helps.

I have some news. Found out that in the standard PowerShell or CMD in
Windows, there is no problem at all. I use tlmgr from R or RStudio terminal
pane (which should use cmd.exe). If you have R installed, try to run tlmgr
command in system2(). Furthermore, I tweaked the TLUtils.pm a bit to see
what is going on step by step, with a few sleep():

 In system shell, URL reads proper mirror URL, in RStudio or with system2
it reads %url_effective. Pretty interesting.

Hi

Tonight's TeX Hour is based on the paper "Accessibility of Command Line
Interfaces" by Sampath, Merrick and Macvean (all at Google, Seattle). I'm
delighted that Alice Merrick will be joining us. You can read the paper and
watch a short presentation on it at:

HTML & PDF: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445544
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b_dlMBUAw8 # 5 minutes

The TeX hour is from 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time. The UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The zoom URL is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

If you've time to read only one thing, look at the paper's recommendations,
which are:

1. Ensure that a HTML version of all documentation is available.
2. Provide a way to translate long outputs into another accessible format.
3. Document the output structure for each command.
4. Provide a way to translate tables in CLI output into another
accessible format.
5. Ensure that all commands provide status and progress indication.
6. Ensure that all status and progress indicators used are screen
reader friendly.
7. Ensure that error messages are understandable when read aloud.

Next week I'll focus on Community and Communication. In particular, I'll
explain why I think our community would benefit from a monthly newsletter,
and what I'm doing in response to that need.

Once again, Accessibility of Command Line Interfaces tonight, 6:30 to
7:30pm.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

with best wishes

Jonathan

OK, I have the final solution. First, we should really write to "nul:"
(with single or double quotes and a colon), as Philip wrote and Zden?k
confirmed. Second, line (
https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLUtils.pm?revision=61960&view=markup#l4083
)

my $warg = (win32() ? "-w %{url_effective} " : "-w '%{url_effective}' ");


*should have quotes* also around the first %{url_effective} (it works fine
without them with recent curl shipped with Windows, but may fail with
various curl versions, e.g. that shipped with R/rtools40, in my case). The
thing is %url_effective is returned as $url, not any mirror. Maybe the
ifelse is not necessary after all?

Best,
Jan

Subject: tlp for luatexja not found

Dear list,

My apologies if this is not the right place to report this, but `tlmgr 
update` now returns an error message:

```

tlmgr: inconsistency on (one of) the server(s): 
https://mirror.mwt.me/ctan/systems/texlive/tlnet

tlmgr: tlp for package luatexja cannot be found, please report.

```

What should one usually do in this case? I note that the package was 
updated three days ago on CTAN.

Thanks and best wishes,
Josh

I just checked that mirror, and it has correct data and also a tlp for
luatexja.

Please retry, you probably hit the window when the server synced with
upstream.

Hi Norbert,

Retrying gives the same error, and trying with `--repository ctan` gives 
me a different mirror but the same error. Is this a "wait for the 
mirrors to sync" situation, then?

Thanks,
Josh

Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to use TeX Live in a commercial project to generate test protocols. Therefore I checked all licenses and found that there are some files licensed under the Aladdin Free Public License (AFPL). According to
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html
Aladdin is not a free software license. It forbids commercial use. The affected files are:

In ghostscript-9.53.3
gdevmd2k.c
gdevalps.c

In avantgar.r31835
uagb8a.afm
uagbi8a.afm
uagr8a.afm
uagri8a.afm

Ghostscript should be AGPL licensed. Were the two files simply forgotten during the license switch from AFPL to AGPL? In texlive.tlpdb the license for avantgar is stated with GPL.

May I assume that the package license is the valid one if nothing else is explicitly mentioned in e.g. a Readme file?

Kind regards
Roland Hohler

Is the license header in these files explicit about AFPL referring to
Aladdin Free Public License? I'm asking because F is right next to G on
the keyboard so a typo in AGPL making it AFPL is not too far out of the
question.

FYI, the current version is 9.55.0.

1) Please report this to Ghostscript. We don't maintain gs.
https://bugs.ghostscript.com/

2) It appears that these are contributed printer drivers that are not
normally compiled. Thus, unless you actually need support for the "ALPS
MD" printer (guessing not :), you (and we) could/should just remove
those files. They don't affect the license of anything else ("mere
aggregation").

    In avantgar.r31835
    uagb8a.afm uagbi8a.afm uagr8a.afm uagri8a.afm

Oops. Ok, I updated those stale license statements to say the GPL, like
the other afms from URW. In fact they long ago gave permission for their
versions of the 35 basic PS fonts under both the GPL and LPPL, but not
going to bother delving into that.

    May I assume that the package license is the valid one if nothing
    else is explicitly mentioned in e.g. a Readme file?

It's not my place to say what licensing assumptions you should or should
not make.  TeX Live is a compilation of work by thousands of people over
several decades. I'm just one of the volunteers who help put it
together.

We do our best to ensure that everything in it is free software, but
we're only human, and as you've seen, things slip through, especially
from, e.g., 30 years ago when people weren't especially careful about
such things. When we hear about problems, we do our best to address them.

So ... ultimately, although the package license indicated (at CTAN
upload time, normally) is presumably what the author intended, it's up
to you whether to take that as sufficient. Clearly it would be
best/safest to write package authors when there is no explicit license
statement.  --best, karl.

Very strange. Can you send the output of
	tlmgr update --list -v -v
?

Dear TeX Live team,

Greetings! I am new to LaTeX and am thrilled to use TeX Live. But I encountered a problem the first time I try to open LeX Live Manager, which gives me the following error:

[cid:88aa5f6a-f905-43b4-befe-71a40482bb79]

I googled this, and updated all my packages (including tlmgr itself) by tlmgr command line tool, but the problem still exists:

[cid:215c8ebe-cc7d-4f55-8244-16be5c6c5b1e]

I also tried to execute the command "tlmgr print-platform" in the error message, but did not get any error:

[cid:b54e3d97-3261-4b31-8711-5e037fff1db2]

And my environment is:
OS: Windows 10 21H2
TeX Live: 2021

Do you have any suggestions? Looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,
Alex

As far as I know, a portable setup does not require any modifications on 
your computer so you can simply delete the installation directory.

Dear Karl Berry,

thank you for the quick and detailed reply.

I've taken the software versions from TeX Live 2021. Also in the current Ghostscript version the license issue still exists. Therefore I'm going to create a bug ticket in Ghostscript Bugzilla.

Kind regards

No idea. I cannot reproduce it. A couple of questions:

- How did you invoke tlshell?
- Does your organization impose any restrictions on what you can and
  cannot do on your system?

I had the same problem. The binary of biber available in the zip
.../texlive/2021/texmf-dist/source/bibtex/biber/biblatex-biber.tar.gz
was not copied into the binary directory of texlive.

Neither of you say what platform you're running on.

All biber binaries provided with the new version are (and have been) in
TL, and the old binaries were removed. I did this in r61867, February 4.
So I don't understand why you are still getting 2.16.

Subject: Package "envlab"
Message-ID: <CAMtQ4xYyGeqT20OdMUAR=z=3OY10SLSk04TaOb=30K5-B-BHJA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I am using TexLive on openSUSE Linux platform, both versions 15.2 and 15.3.
The "envlab" package works fine in TexLive2020, but some of its
functionality is broken in TexLive2021. I have sent a separate email to the
author of envlab, but I suspect there is a broken functionality within the
TexLive upgrade process from version 2020 to version 2021.

I would appreciate your attention to this problem.

Thanks and have a great day,

The current version of biber is _not_ replaced by the update.
I can delete biber in /.../texlive/bin/x86_64-darwin/
and then run

tlmgr install --reinstall biber

which should copy a new into the bin dir.
But I get only the updated source files, but _not_ the binary in the bin 
dir of TL

TL2021, macOS (BigSur)

Maybe a OSX problem. With linux I have:

$ biber --version
biber version: 2.17
$ which biber
/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/biber

Which functionality is broken? Can you show a minimal example working with TeX
Live 2020 but not working with TeX Live 2021?

I'm using envlab, e.g., for an example file and do not have problems with an
up-to-date Vanilla TeX Live 2021. I've also tested with current version of
pdflatex-dev without problems.

BTW: AFAIK envlab is the oldest package without updates I'm using. It is
unchanged from 1997 and still working.

I have not updated TeX Live for a long time, so I did it now. Before
update I had version 2.16; tlmgr shows

[ 26/368, 00:41/09:37] update: biber.x86_64-linux [22990k] (57273 ->
61867) ... done
[ 27/368, 00:52/08:00] update: biber [1202k] (57273 -> 61867) ... done

I can confirm that I have 2.17 after update.

This maybe the problem ...

My error, when I tested the biber from texstudio I didnot recognize that 
the program has not been updated to the 64bit version. When I started 
the win64 version, everything was ok. Sorry for the noice.

That's very odd, in two respects:

- The actual path should be /usr/local/texlive/<year>/bin/<arch>/biber.

- The year in question should be 2021, and the arch (for 2021) universal-darwin.

MacTeX-2021 or -2020 do not create a /usr/local/texlive/bin/x86_64-darwin: the former creates /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/universal-darwin, and the latter (AFAIR) /usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-darwin. You must have installed differently. Did you install via install-tl?

Or maybe the above is a typo, the year is indeed in the path, and the problem is that you have both TL2021 and TL2020 (say) installed, and for some reason your setup mistakenly uses the binaries from 2020.

What does

	% ls -l /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents  

give? Here with MacTeX-2021 I get

	% ls -l /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents                
	lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  32 Jan 28 20:15 /Library/TeX/Distributions/.DefaultTeX/Contents -> ../TeXLive-2021.texdist/Contents

Notice the "-2021" in the target.

The actual /usr/local/texbin/ in PATH is, for historical reasons mostly, a complicated chain of relative symlinks, pointing to /usr/local/texlive/<year>/bin/<arch>/ eventually.

Possible remedies are:

- Launch the TeX Live Utility app, and use the menu item Configure > Change Default TeX Live Version.

- Download

	https://tug.org/mactex/TeXDist-2021.pkg

and install it.

Hopefully that should fix things.

no, I never use the year!? Can be changed in the config file before 
installation

yes, the default TeXLive, not macTeX

I know. I have it already on another mashine, but for this one I need 
for some test
the default TeXLive installation.

Based on what Norbert Preining wrote in another thread earlier this month, it might simply be a matter of

	sudo tlmgr platform add universal-darwin
	sudo tlmgr platform set universal-darwin

In this way you'll get the Mac binaries for 2021, and use them. All are universal binaries (= x86_64 + arm64) compiled by Dick Koch, hence the directory name, except biber precisely which was compiled by its author for x86_64 I think then sent to Dick for inclusion in TeX Live.

Afterwards you can also run

	sudo tlmgr platform remove x86_64-darwin

if you want, to remove the unused binaries.

All without guarantee: I'm not very familiar with using tlmgr on the command-line, and its different actions and options.

Here (on a setup installed with MacTeX-2021)

% tlmgr platform list
tlmgr: package repository https://texlive.mycozy.space/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)

Already installed platforms are marked with (i)
You can add new platforms with: tlmgr platform add PLAT1 PLAT2...
You can remove platforms with: tlmgr platform remove PLAT1 PLAT2...
You can set the active platform with: tlmgr platform set PLAT

Hope this helps,

A dummy update forced due to changes in the TeX Catalogue.
The last real update was in 2008.

That is not the problem! The problem is why I have with macTeX
a correct setting:

iMac:Intro4 voss$ tlmgr platform list
tlmgr: package repository 
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/tex/CTAN/systems/texlive/tlnet (verified)
Available platforms:
[...]
(i) universal-darwin
[...]

but on another machine (also BiGSur) with the installation of texlive not??
There is no (i) in the output. I'll try to reinstall TeXLive and see 
what happens.

I have TL2021 running since it was published, but never realized this 
problem,
because binaries are updated not so often.

I'll stop here because I am not sure I am actually helping.

But regarding just the above: my impression is that you installed first with install-tl at a time (ie 2020 or before) when the platform name on the Mac was x86_64-darwin. Then, I don't know how exactly that happened, you end up now having support files for TeX Live 2021 in /usr/local/texlive/2021, but binaries in /usr/local/texlive/bin/x86_64-darwin using a platform name that ceased to exist in 2021, when the name switched from x86_64-darwin to universal-darwin.

I strongly suspect the 2021 binaries were never installed, and you have been using the 2020 binaries all along.

That's also why there is no (i) in the output on your second machine: the platform name on it, x86_64-darwin, is no longer within the list of available platform names.

Hopefully using "tlmgr platform add universal-darwin" would set things back on track, by adding the 2021 binaries with a platform name that TeX Live knows about. Reinstall TeX Live from scratch is another solution.

Of course, I may be wrong and the problem may be entirely different.

\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}

There are no issues with TeX Live 2018 under Debian 10 buster.
The author of the full .tex file uses a macOS machine, so I assume
that there are no issues there either (but I don't know which
TeX distribution it is).

You have to use $e_{\textnormal{m}}$ because the _ character expect a
token and wothiut braces it is \textnormal. When it is expanded, it
finds that an argument is missing, it does not see {m}. That's why you
have to use the outer braces because _ then takse a balanced text,
i.e. \textnormal{m} will be used as the underscore.

Hi Zdenek

Thank you for your prompt response. I don't doubt that this solves the
problem for new documents. But the sample Vincent provided works correctly
in earlier versions of TeX Live. It may be that his concern is the
unexpected failure of backwards compatibility. I certainly have that
concern.

I've not yet installed TL 2021 so I can't yet investigate this for myself.
Do you have any ideas about what's happened, Zdenek?

with best regards

Jonathan

The behaviour changed with the commit https://github.com/josephwright/beamer/commit/87f1646bd2307010701991129e5a900019b1d48c

You can make your old document work again with this workaround:

\documentclass{beamer}

\renewcommand{\textnormal}{\beameroriginal{\textnormal}}

\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
$e_\textnormal{m}$
\end{frame} s
\end{document}

The syntax $e_\textnormal{m}$ has never been supported and
if it works is just by accident. The proper syntax is to
brace _any_ subscript (or superscript), but there?s usually 
no problem when there is just a _single_ token.

However, try $A_\notin$ and you?ll learn that $A_{\notin}$
is much better.

Ciao

If you look at the subdirectory

(easier on your actual filesystem, if you have access to the machine,
which I'm guessing you might) and the files
  biber.*
there, you will see biber.universal-darwin and no biber.x86_64-darwin.

Do you have a bin/universal-darwin/ subdir in your TL installation?
I'm guessing yes. That's what the TL21 installer would have created.
I surmise your x86_64-darwin is left over from 2019.

Question in my mind is, do you just install each year over your previous
/usr/local/texlive? As opposed to moving the previous year aside before
doing the new install.

Installing in the same dir doesn't seem like it should work at all. You
would end up with many inconsistencies, as packages get renamed, not to
mention files getting moved around even when the package name stays the
same.

I can't recall offhand if we give any warnings when installing to an
existing directory ... --best, karl.

I have just tried to install TeX Live 2021 to an existing directory on
Linux and there is no warning. It even offered me to import the
settings from already installed TL 2021. Of course, I have just "cp
--rec" /usr/local/texlive/2021 to /usr/local/texlive/XXXX and tried to
install to the latter in order not to break my running version.

It was my first package...  Sweet memories...

By the way, it really should be rewritten, at least for the US post.
The zip code encoding it used was retired by USPS a decade ago.
The new system is more complex, and its implementation is not easy :(

Any reason why this has been broken?

Even though the behavior was not officially supported, there were
no errors without the additional braces and this was simpler and
more easily readable, so that it was probably used in practice.
I can see that in many of my old .tex files (not all using beamer).

Unfortunately, this makes pdflatex fail with TeX Live 2018.
With .tex files shared among several users, this must work
will all the TeX Live versions around.

I added additional braces. Fortunately, only 2 changes in the file
were sufficient.

In practice, people just see whether this works, without necessarily
thinking of other possibilities. Then the real issue is the change of
behavior by new versions.

I'm wondering... I can see, for instance:

texmf-dist/tex/latex/dvgloss/dvgloss.sty:\makeglshortcut[{[$_\textrm{\footnotesize#1}$\thinspace}
texmf-dist/tex/latex/nwejm/nwejmart.cls:    $_\mathsf{\arabic*}$
texmf-dist/tex/latex/unifith/unifith.cls:  \providecommand*{\rb}[1]{\ensuremath{_\mathrm{#1}}}

Isn't that similar?

This is a bit unfortunate. But I suppose that if this has never
worked, people would have added braces after seeing a failure.
This is not a big issue compared to incompatibilities introduced
in new TeX Live versions, potentially breaking many files.

Well, you should read carefully The TeXbook and understand how TeX
reads the input, what is a token, when and how different types of
expansion occur (in the mouth or in the stomach) and how the math
lists are built. In addition, you must know the definitions of control
sequences used in the fileds of math atoms. If you do not know them
well, it is better to be at the safer side.

Yes. There was an issue with the behaviour of font switches not 
respecting the beamer 'action' concept. Fixing that means altering the 
definition of \text... such that it no longer allows TeX to expand to 
find an open-group token before hitting something non-expandable.

Lamport's book is entirely clear on the supported syntax for sub- and 
superscripts.

As I have said before, it is a great pity that Leslie Lamport did not create an entirely different syntax for LaTeX, such that a na?ve user could not possibly confuse the syntax rules for TeX with those for LaTeX.

The code was improved to make the font commands overlay aware. Previously, only a couple of them, like `\textbf`, were overlay aware, now they are all consistent. The advantage is that the user can now control on which overlays a particular command should come into effect, e.g. 

\documentclass{beamer}

\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
$e_{\textnormal<2->{m}}$
\end{frame} 
\end{document}

That really isn't an issue here though, there is no reason to suppose this
hypothetical naive latex user should know plain tex syntax at all and
especially not have read the texbook in such detail as to understand the
parsing differences between macro arguments and subscripts, such that
\fbox\textnormal{x}  parses as \fbox{\textnormal}{x} and is an error but
e_\textnormal{x} parses as e_{\undocumentedinternalmacros{x}}  so makes a
valid subscript

Actually it is not clear at all. From the table of contents, I can see
that this is Section 3.3.1 page 40, and there, braces are always used,
but Lamport does not say that they are mandatory. This is not clear
because when one tries $x_1$, this works as wanted.

One-digit subscripts and superscripts occur very often, and I'm
wondering how many users put braces, e.g. $x_{1}$, in these cases.

Are there really such people, David ?  I find it hard to believe that anyone who uses (any dialect of) TeX seriously would not have read the TeXbook from cover to cover many times.  LaTeX is based on TeX, and therefore I would have thought.that one needs a sound knowledge of TeX if one is to be able to use LaTeX effectively.

and especially not have read the texbook in such detail as to understand the parsing differences between macro arguments and subscripts,

The difference between macro parameters and sub- or supercripts is surely so fundamental to the TeX paradigm that no TeX user could possible be unaware of the difference.  Again IMHO, of course.

Lamport's book does not explain what a token is so braces are used in
places where they are not needed. Many users write
\newcommand{\something}{definition...} while \something does not
require braces. And users do not understand why \newcommand* with the
asterisk is better. Of course, x_1 works but x_12 will not put 12 into
the supscript. And you can also try:

$$\frac1x-\frac ab+\frac7{a+b}$$

Hi

Joseph's defence of the change to Beamer seems to be based on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out.

It seems to me that it's getting harder to add features to LaTeX
without breaking existing documents. Further evidence for this is in the
revisions being made to support the production of tagged PDF output.

In my opinion, many of these problems arise from there not being a formal
syntax for valid LaTeX input documents. I believe a piece of software that
can at least partially validate LaTeX input documents would be helpful.

Sorry, but your mail message was misleading as you did not use ">"
for quoted text, so that the text appeared to be from you. The ">"
is standard for quoted text in mail messages.

Personally I regard terminating a control word with anything other than a space or a newline (as in, for example, \textbf1) no better than letter-spacing lower-case text ? a man who would do either would almost certainly steal sheep.

The point is readability. I find x_1 to be more readable than x_{1}
(especially if there are other braces around), while "\textbf1" or
"\textbf a" are less readable / more confusing than their version
with braces.

There are other sources that are much less clear, like

  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Powers_and_indices

It currently says that \sfrac needs curly braces:

  $x^{\sfrac{1}{2}}$ % no error

but that using \frac without them is fine:

  $x^\frac{1}{2}$ % no error

I don't think that this is an issue if one has the guarantee that
there will never be a breakage. Otherwise, if this may be like
beamer and \textnormal, curly braces should be recommended.

There is a reason I referenced Lamport's book: it is the official manual 
for LaTeX. The Wikibook has some oddities.

I've looked at the page and not found any oddities that are relevant to
this discussion. Please would you provide some examples of such Wikibook
oddities.

It does contain many examples such as

> \cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta

which I think is what most LaTeX authors would write.

Just to be precise, the information that x^\frac{a}{b} does not need
braces is based upon a wrong assumption. The official manual says what
\frac is supposed to yield in the printed output but does not say how
it should be implemented. This means that in the future the LaTeX
developers may freely change the definition and it will need braces as
\sfrac needs. It is not a good habit to rely on undocumented features
while \textbf1 and \frac1x are based on features documented in The
TeXbook.

Perhaps it is time for the LaTeX-3 team to produce a van W?ngaarden 
grammar 2-level grammar for LaTeX.

Well, the wikibook has advantages, e.g. errors can be corrected at
any time. At least one has the history. For the reference:

https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Mathematics&oldid=4026030#Fractions_and_Binomials

FYI, I've started a discussion about this "oddity":

Yes there are! I am using LaTeX since the late eighties, I own the 
texbook, but I do not understand it mostly, since I am not a programmer, 
only in interested in writing scietific texts for a variety of purposes. 
The programming with TeX und Latex is beyond my reach.

Yes there are! I am using LaTeX since the late eighties, I own the texbook, but I do not understand it mostly, since I am not a programmer, only in interested in writing scietific texts for a variety of purposes. The programming with TeX und Latex is beyond my reach.

Fair enough, I did not intend to appear dismissive of people such as yourself.  But I suspect that the issue is not dissimilar to that of (say) driving a car ? there are undoubtedly (?many?) people who drive a car yet have no idea how an engine, gearbox or clutch work; but I cannot help but feel that those who do understand how such things work are more likely to (e.g.,) endeavour to match engine speed to road speed before engaging the clutch after a gear change than those who do not.

In the same way, those who understand how TeX works "under the bonnet" are more likely to write custom macros ("\newcommand" s) that are specifically targetted at their universe of discourse rather then use only those macros ("commands") that LaTeX offers out of the box.

Subject: font weight issue with beamer and the newtxtt package
Message-ID: <20220218155451.GL44193@zira.vinc17.org>

Consider the following

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{newtxtt}
\beamertemplatenavigationsymbolsempty
\newcommand{\tst}{$2^{e_{\textnormal{min}}}$}
\begin{document}
\tst \\
\begin{footnotesize}\tst\end{footnotesize}
\end{document}

The newtxtt package makes the second "min" bolder than the first one.
So this looks incorrect.

Moreover, this package is described as follows:
"Enhancement of typewriter fonts from newtx".

But "min" is not in a typewriter font, thus should not be affected
by this package.

I've attached
  * newtxtt-1.pdf - result without \usepackage{newtxtt} (correct)
  * newtxtt-2.pdf - result with \usepackage{newtxtt}

Is this a bug in beamer or newtxtt?

You shouldn't ask such questions on the texlive mailing list. This
is about problems with texlive as distribuation. 

For general questions about LaTeX use texhax, or comp.text.tex or a
site like tex.stackexchange.com.

Message-ID: <6210C223.06B40E.16823@bjtu.edu.cn>

Dear tex-live official
I am a student who barely understand computer science, and my computer get into trouble by texlive, so can you help me.
Things happens when I installed texlive yesterday, I ran it directly and forgetted to install as the  administrator, so I installed it into C:, and C: is almost got full which I can barely use other big software, so I uninstall from the root document, this time, when I run the uninstall program, I just remembered I should run as administrator, so I shut the program down, when it is still on. I want to rerun is as administrator, but it can not work. I do not know how to do, so, I delete all the document named texlive.
The question is, how can I delete the other remained files and data beyond the document texlive, to get more space in C:. It is really important to me, because it really delays my speed to do my staffs with study and influence the process of the rest people in my team .
Forgive my awful English and thanks for reading. If you help me, you are saving my computer and I will be very, very, very, appreciate, thank you 3 thousands.
Sincerely
A girl who is very, very, very, sad

Which mirror? Note https://mirror.ctan.org is a generic URL that is 
automatically redirected to a mirror (near to you). I've tested three times, 
got three different mirrors and all three work.

Maybe you caught a mirror at a bad moment, e.g. during updating. For
me, the link worked fine.

I am re-directed to https://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe, which timed out at the first attempt but connected at the second.

Why do you need to install as administrator at all?

For a user install under windows, the uninstaller is an item in the
TeX Live menu. For an admin install, the uninstaller is under
Settings / Apps.

If you reinstall in the same mode, then everything that is not in
the TeX Live directory itself will get recreated, and then you can
uninstall properly.

If you click on the advanced button, then you can select a smaller
scheme, e.g. small or basic, which makes a LOT of difference in
required disk space. With TeX Live Manager you can install missing
items later.

You can install on another drive. The dialog for selecting an
installation root consists of three components, e.g.

1. D:\, 2: texlive, and 3: 2021

The first component must already exist, and you can select it in the
normal way, by browsing to it. You can most likely leave the second
and third components as they are.

Hope this helps.

Several years ago I measured disk space occupied by several parts of
TeX Live and found that considerable space is required for
documentation. If you have good access to internet, you can deselect
documentation and read the manuals on the web.

Hi,

I?m the maintainer of some packages like ? tkz-euclide ?. I just noticed a problem with compiling my documentations.
I use my own class ?  tkt-doc.cls ?  and a package ? tkzexample.sty ? and these two files seem to be in the wrong place.
 I just realized that the path of tkz-doc.cls is: /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/latex/tkz-doc/latex/doc.cls.
It would be better if the documents of tkz-doc folder should be here: 2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tkz-doc with the other tkz packages.

Hi Alain - thanks for the note. 

    It would be better if the documents of tkz-doc folder should be
    here: 2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tkz-doc with the other tkz packages.

In that case, can you please rename couverture.tex to tkz-couverture.tex
or tkz-doc-couverture.tex? Or can that one file stay in the doc tree?

Also, "tkzexample.sty" would be better as tkz-doc-example.sty (or some
such), as well. Yours are not the only packages providing t(i)kz
examples, or that reduce "tikz" to "tkz".

Such generic names are fine in the doc tree, but in the runtime tree, we
have to be more careful. --thanks, karl.

Subject: more resilient TL installation
Message-ID: <202202222308.21MN8Q5n000770@freefriends.org>

Norbert found the time to implement an oft-requested feature for
install-tl: for network installations only, if the download or
installation of a single package fails, it can now continue, instead of
aborting right away.  (Apart from the handful of core infrastructure
packages -- same as scheme-infraonly -- which are installed first.)

Then it retries once at the end, in case the error was transient.  If
failure persists, at a later time you can run tlmgr to install the
packages that had problems.

For now, you have to invoke
  install-tl --continue
to get the new behavior. We hoped there might be a few people who
might like to test in other environments than ours before we make this
default, which we hope/expect to do by the end of the week.

I guess the best way to test would be to start a full installation and
then disable the network connection. We haven't done that, though.
Instead, given a mirror of tlnet, we've tested this way:

1) in $TLNET/archive/, mv some .tar.xz files to simulate the broken
download. E.g., mv dvips* /tmp.

2) run:
  $TLNET/install-tl --continue --debug-fakenet --profile /tmp/TL.pro
where
1) --debug-fakenet makes install-tl think it is doing a network
install, for our testing purposes.

2) /tmp/TLmin.pro is the profile file below. Just saves the hassle of
setting all the directory variables interactively, since we don't want
to change any real directories. Adjust options to suit, of course.  This
installs the "minimal" scheme, just plain TeX, into /tmp/ki.

You should then observe install-tl failing to install the packages that
have been moved aside, retrying at the end and failing again, and then
outputting a message saying that you can get them by running:
  tlmgr update --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed
(in the newly-installed tree). Because by default the repo in the
newly-installed tree will be switched to CTAN, this will work
without having to move the packages back.

Sorry it's complicated, but that's life. Maybe this email will be
documentation if nothing else :). --thanks, karl.

P.S. One more complication: for format rebuilding, some dependencies are
awry, e.g., dehyph-exptl. This should be repaired tonight.

Hi all,

It seems that the latest hyph-utf8 package doesn't contain all the files
needed:

$ tlmgr info --list hyph-utf8
package:     hyph-utf8
category:    Package
shortdesc:   Hyphenation patterns expressed in UTF-8
longdesc:    Modern native UTF-8 engines such as XeTeX and LuaTeX need
hyphenation patterns in UTF-8 format, whereas older systems require
hyphenation patterns in the 8-bit encoding of the font in use (such
encodings are codified in the LaTeX scheme with names like OT1, T2A, TS1,
OML, LY1, etc). The present package offers a collection of conversions of
existing patterns to UTF-8 format, together with converters for use with
8-bit fonts in older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style
TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the UTF-8
patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant the older
patterns.

There should be some more pattern files (e.g. hyph-de-1901.ec.tex).

The original issue is from
https://github.com/stone-zeng/fduthesis/issues/241 (in Chinese), while you
may reproduce it by installing a vanilla texlive and then installing hyph-utf8
and uplatex.

Thank you!

hyph-utf8 is the loader. You need to install the respective

Maybe wget needs to be installed (`pkg install wget`) (though I thought
it would fall back to curl if not found), or perhaps download of

Hi

Tonight's TeX hour is from 6:30 to 7:30pm UK (and UTC) time. The UK time
now: https://time.is/UK.
The zoom URL is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Last week I attended a "needs discovery" meeting organised by Daniele
Procida, who I've met several times at UK Python conferences. Daniele is
now one of several Directors of Engineering at Canonical, the  developers
of Ubuntu Linux, where he has special responsibility for improving both
documentation and the process by which it is created.

Daniele is also a current Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute.
The meeting last week was to discover needs for a workshop he's holding
next month, to help Research Software Engineers improve their
documentation. There were over 20 people there.

I hope that at tonight's TeX Hour we will share our experience of writing,
rendering and using technical documentation, particularly  for software.
Daniele's approach is focussed on a quadrant of user needs.

The quadrant is

Top left: Tutorials (focussed on learning).
Top right: How-to guides (focussed on tasks).
Bottom left:  Explanation (focussed on understanding).
Bottom right: Reference (focussed on information).

The up-down axis is practice and theory. The left-right axis is study and
work.

Subject: Latest babel breaks with lualatex and amsmath
Message-ID: <63fbd027-e571-2df7-6fd4-5ce9db264293@gmail.com>

Hi,

It looks like the latest babel breaks compilation with lualatex on 
documents using amsmath (see https://github.com/latex3/babel/issues/175).

Babel and amsmath are such important pieces of infrastructure that in 
case a proper fix cannot land very soon in babel proper, it can be quite 
important for users to be able to revert to 3.71.

I have some questions in this regard:

- Is it possible to download a package and keep it around for 
installation as one would do, say, for a `deb` or `rpm`. In other words, 
would it be possible to download something like babel.r62007.tar.lz4 
package from somewhere for later install from command line?

- To make sure that babel.r62007.tar.lz4 that I currently have in the 
backups does not get accidentally deleted or autodeleted, I am copying 
it somewhere else. In case it gets deleted is it enough to drop it back 
to the backup directory or must there also be some reference to it in a 
database?

Thanks

Sergio

You can install a package via tlmgr install --from-file afair.
Also, your can always pull older versions from the tlnet archive at texlive info

Maybe also a possible quick fix for users: I have no problem if I load
amsmath *after* babel.

Hi

bit more specific now

tlmgr install --file babel.r62007.tar.lz4

> - To make sure that babel.r62007.tar.lz4 that I currently have in the

Yes it is enough. Files are removed depending on your backup setting. By
default only the last version is kept.

And, as said, https://texlive.info/tlnet-archive/ keeps daily archives
back for many years.

Best

I reported an error for luaotfload.   lua-uni-algos is installed on my
systems (full TeX Live 2021), but under the luatex directory, not in
scripts/lua.

Subject: pretest 2022 begin
Message-ID: <202202270246.21R2kRn5009866@freefriends.org>

Hi everyone.  I think the pretest area is populated with the first build
for TL 2022. See https://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html as usual for
details of how to install (unchanged from previous years), and the list
of notable changes that I've got so far. Additions or corrections to the
news are greatly appreciated.

The binaries for some of the platforms have not yet been updated (coming
soon), but the basic sets (x86_64-linux, Windows, Mac current & legacy)
are there.  Dick Koch is creating the separate MacTeX/BasicTeX packages
and they should also be available soon.

As with last year, tlnet will continue to be updated during this pretest
period. That is, regular package updates sent to CTAN will normally end
up in both tlnet and tlpretest. If a package update should only be in
the pretest, and you haven't already told me, please say so in the CTAN
upload notes.

Please don't avoid the pretest just because tlnet is being updated.
Better for everyone to test now than wait for breakage in the official
release. TL has no dedicated testers or QA department, so it's all up to
us collectively as volunteers.

Hope it flies,
Karl

If I use
tlmgr info hitex
the message ends with

tlmgr: cannot find depending packagehitex.x86_64-cygwin

Not surprised that the cygwin binaries are not available yet (or ever) but
I thought I'd report the missing space after "package" in the message.

Hi George,

thanks for the report. The bug should be fixed with the latest update
(v3.20)

By the way, it would be great if you could report such issues on the
GitHub issue tracker for luaotfload in the future, there we are more likely
to see it and it will be tracked together with other reports. (The link
is given in the --version message you showed below).

Best regards,
Marcel

That should be ok. This is not a script but input lua-files loaded
e.g. by luaotfload (that is under luatex too).

Same here. All fine on Windows 10. Smooth (but lengthy, ~5hrs) install
yesterday. Binaries updated today.

Same here on Devuan 4.0.  Thanks to all those who invested their time
to make this possible.

Subject: Problem with microtype and pdftricks

Howdy,

Typesetting the following source with pdflatex -shell-escape

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdftricks}
\usepackage{microtype} 
\begin{psinputs}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\end{psinputs}
\begin{document}
\begin{pdfpic} 
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(3,3)
\pscircle[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=yellow](1.5,1.5){1.5}
\pscircle[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black](1.0,2.0){0.15}
\pscircle[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black](2.0,2.0){0.15}
\pscircle[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black](1.5,1.3){0.1}
\psarc{(-)}(1.5,1.5){1}{235}{305}
\end{pspicture}
\end{pdfpic} 
\end{document}

gives the error

! Use of \MT at prot@group doesn't match its definition.
<recently read> \bgroup 
                        
l.17 \end{pdfpic}
                 
? 

Pressing Return gives

! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
\reserved at a ...\PDFTfigname }\fi \fi \fi }\egroup 
                                                  \end {center}\global \@pdf...
l.17 \end{pdfpic}
                 
? 

Pressing Return again completes processing with a valid pdf.

If you comment out the loading of microtype it typesets without problems.

Good Luck,
