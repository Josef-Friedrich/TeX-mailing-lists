tlmgr repository add https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlcontrib tlcontrib
tlmgr pinning add tlcontrib "*"
tlmgr install siam

See: https://contrib.texlive.info/

I just added siam there, the CTAN mirrors might need a day to pick it
up, though.

As one of the people involved in the process I can tell you, that we 
produce the DVDs in close cooperation with all TeX user groups. All 
other user groups pay a little bit more than the production costs to 
give us some buffer for expensive "disasters" like failures due to wrong 
master DVD etc. Fortunately this does not happen too often, but it did 
in the past. Therefore I think this is still legitimate and no "selling".

Lehmanns Media used to sell the DVD, but this is no longer valid. At 
least I am not aware of a recent order from their side.

So it remains a rather academic discussion. From my point of view there 
is no business model involved at all.

Best regards,
Martin

One may redistribute TeX Live, with or without modification, for profit or not,
according to the Free Software tenets defined by the Free Software Foundation.
That said, I disapprove with much of the ideas and work of the TeX User Groups
Committee Members, particularly those in the UK. 

Whilst they ask us for discussions, assistance and help, their invitations
are most commonly dishonest as they are not really interested in what we say
but only in propagating their point of view and way of doing things.

Which of these are in the UK ?? Or are you referring to the UK TeX User 
Group Committee ?? If so, the UK TeX User Group folded some months ago ?

No wonder it folded, there was no future in it, mostly because of the bad ideas  
of passed over individuals that got way too old to be of any use.? Yourself,
for instance, brought much disagreement, and saw no point in lifting a finger
with regard to the UK TeX User Group.

There need to be fresh attitudes and abilities to follow directions and act
accordingly.  Only then would I be in a position to reconsider.  Funnily,
Jonathan Fine is one I will not deal with anymore.

You must have a remarkable memory, Christopher, given that I resigned as 
a member of UK-TuG in 2006 ? perhaps you could remind me, as your memory 
is clearly far better than mine, in what way I "brought much 
disagreement, and saw no point in lifting a finger with regard to the UK 
TeX User Group".

May I remind you of the rant of how you called us amateurs simply because our work is not done within the 
framework of some well known corporation.  It would have been very easy for those reading, to read those
sentences as implying that we are inexperienced or unskilled in a our activities.  Totally untrue.  

Although it is not something that cannot be fixed among ourselves.  Would you agree?

Hi Christopher,

I would kindly remind you of keeping a proper etiquette, your postings
are rather inflammatory, unfair, full of unbased accusation.

Despite agreeing with you on you attitude towards certain members,
I ask you to refrain from writing those emails, even more if you pose
as FSF or GNU related associate.

To be very clear: your emails are not welcome here. If you have
constructive criticism, bring it forth, either directly to the TUG
board, or the TeX Live team, but stop spamming this list.

There was no "rant", Christopher, simply a statement of fact.? I am an 
amateur photographer, because I am not paid for my work ? this is no way 
a pejorative statement, nor would anyone interpret it as such, and it 
does not act as a barrier to being asked to act as duty photographer at 
various events ? see, for example, 
http://small-acres.trezaise.uk/photography/bodmin bowls club/50th 
anniversary/ 
<http://small-acres.trezaise.uk/photography/bodmin%20bowls%20club/50th%20anniversary/>

In just the same way, those who programme as a hobby rather than as paid 
employment are amateur programmers ? neither more, nor less.? This in no 
way devalues their work, which may well be as good as, or even better 
than, professional work.

Stop preaching on what not to do.  If you want to start exchanging insults

Have understood long ago that I am unwelcome.  I do nothing unsolicited,
so if you want anything constructive, there should be some goodwill involved
as I have not seen much of it.  At least that has been my experience.
You can deny it, but I can discuss a list of individuals.  If they had not 
actually been members of TUG Committees, I would not have griped.

Thank you so very much

Subject: TeX Live 2022 binaries now available for OpenBSD 7.2 AMD64
Message-ID: <CMM.0.96.0.1667402921.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

TTeX Live 2022 binaries are now available for OpenBSD 7.2 AMD64.
Details are at

	https://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/#openbsd-7.2-amd64
	https://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/bin/amd64-openbsd72.tar.xz

The O/S was officially released on 20 October 2022, and new binaries
are needed because OpenBSD does not guarantee ABI compatibility across
minor releases, such as 7.0 to 7.1 to 7.2.

The OpenBSD 7.2 binary package system has TeX Live 2021 split across 8
packages.

Christopher, as the President of TeX Users Group I am very sorry to
hear this.  I do not remeber an input from you, but if I missed it
somehow, I apologize.  I am sure all Board members are very receptive
to the voice of the community, and would be glad to hear any ideas,

Subject: Would this list benefit from having a code of conduct?
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf_ARibgL+XCnPpneLrw_JV62JWsuiuiAsF0mxPmtATKVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Perhaps this list would benefit from having a code of conduct. Based on my
own experience, both here and elsewhere, my answer that is that it is worth
trying. What do you think?

If you want, we can discuss this tonight at the TeX Hour (see
https://texhour.github.io/).  It starts 3.5 hours from NOW.

Here are some links you might find helpful:
https://www.debian.org/code_of_conduct
https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html

The previous item, the Linux code of conduct, is based on the work of:
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/

Perhaps Contributor Covenant, which I've not seen before, would be a good
place to start.

with kind regards

Jonathan

Jonathan,I think there's already a code of conduct, and it's been perfectly adequate for the years I've been on this list (to support users of TeX Live Utility, and keep abreast of changes to TeX Live Manager): namely, people should only post items related to TeX Live, per the guidelines at?https://tug.org/texlive/lists.html, quoted here for convenience:tex-live at tug.org - bug reports, package requests and packaging problems, license issues, and general TeX Live discussion of any kind. Reports about specific packages should go to the package maintainers.Adherence to basic netiquette such as not cross-posting to texhax and other lists is nice, too, but most people don't need that reminder.regards,AdamOn Nov 3, 2022, at 8:06 AM, Jonathan Fine <jfine2358 at gmail.com> wrote:HiPerhaps this list would benefit from having a code of conduct.

Well personally I don't have problems with the list. But are you
sure that you want to impose stricter rules? 
The list is for "tex-live -- TeX Live development and testing." and
your various invitations and advertisements are clearly off-topic.

Felicitations Boris,

I understand that, at the present time, there are a large number of people who are
living in the expanding boundary of free software use and redistribution that we 
have all been talking about.  Our movement is not the only one suffering from anger
at the moment.  But some of my dear friends have come to the conclusion that we're
on a jihad for free software.

Thusly, I have to draw some factual conclusions to your attention 

Firstly, that what matters is the industrial use of free software.  What both sides
of our communities of software makers have to understand, is that scale is what matters.

Secondly, when multinational information technology companies first began coming to free
software, we did not criticise them for not being non-profit virtuous enough.  We did not
say "we are suspicious of you," let alone threaten them to sue them out of existence.  
Everything else that we wanted to do would have become impossible immediately.

We act on behalf of the great projects that we all love, and welcome everybody with 
open arms and make clear that the commercial use of the software is our hope not our
fear.  Otherwise, we will achieve absolutely nothing that really matters about freedom.

What is left is thanks.  Thanks for TeX Live Maintainers agreeing on the general
principles of Free Software, for all software to meet the requirements of the
Free Software Foundation's definition of free software.  And that in cases of 
conflict, you follow the FSF recommendations. 

An important topic that emerged from this year's GNU Hackers' Meeting, is 
the need for communication between different groups.  Because many projects
function within isolated and restricted environments. I have experienced 
such environment, for instance, within the GCC development community.  There
also had been talk not to do the GHM in Turkey but we did that anyway.  And 
whilst others have decided to suspend a significant part of their operations
in Russia (in light of the ongoing military aggression against Ukraine and 
the changed political and economic environment), I continue to assist people
in Kamchatka where there is limited access to technology and where things 
might be a little too high-tech for them - all this notwithstanding community
consternation about doing so.

The organisational difficulties encountered in practice require effort and determination. 
There's no kind of gratitude like the gratitude of knowing you got a partner who's got 
your back.  I thus relay a positive message for substantive and conscious approaches in
our executions.  

Would you entertain the idea of engaging together purposively to the point where 
everyone engaged in leading the task of making free software moves forward long-term?

Besides, it will be some time before you exhaust your entitlement to free help from me.  

Incidentally, I have recently beheld the capability of implementing a number of 
Epidemiological Models (including network based preferential model), as free software.  
If this could possibly excite you, possibilities can be entertained between us.

Thank you so very much
Christopher

I am not sure TeXLive list is the proper place to discuss this - maybe
we should move the discussion to another place.  Anyway, long term
survival of free software is our goal.  TUG is a relatively small
organization, but we do provide grants to TeX developers, with the
requirement that the software developed is free, see
https://tug.org/tc/devfund/.

Let me put on another hat: in my day job I work for Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative.  Our Open Science program is aimed to promote the
universal and immediate open sharing of all scientific knowledge,
processes, and outputs.  As a part of this, we do fund open software
for science and strive to provide long term viability for it. See
https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/ and the list of funded projects in
https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/.  By the way, at least one
of the projects is TeX related.  Recently my colleagues and I released
a dataset of the software mentions in scientific papers
(https://medium.com/czi-technology/new-data-reveals-the-hidden-impact-of-open-source-in-science-11cc4a16fea2),
and we are going to use it to help to determine the funding
opportunities.  Of course scientific software is just a part of the
software world, but you must start somewhere.

This looks interesting.

Message-ID: <8735ayld3f.fsf@example.com>

Hi,

Context:

- Mageia 8 GNU/Linux box,
- Vanilla TeX Live installation,
- zsh as a Unix shell.

Is there any reason for the command line completion to behave
differently in one hand for `pdflatex` and `xelatex` and in the other
hand for `lualatex`. Namely, for a (single) `test.tex` file (with
several `test.*` auxiliary files) in the current directory:

1. `pdflatex tes + TAB` is completed into `pdflatex test.tex`,
2. `xelatex tes + TAB` is completed into `xelatex test.tex`
3. `lualatex tes + TAB` is completed into `lualatex test.`,
   and
   `lualatex test. + TAB` proposes all the `test.*` files present in the
   current directory.

Thanks.

Hi Denis,

I am running Slackware64 15.0, and I see the same problem (except I
use tex, not latex).

In my case, the file /usr/share/zsh/5.8/functions/_tex starts with
        #compdef tex latex slitex pdftex pdflatex jadetex pdfjadetex xetex=tex xelatex=latex latexmk

and I notice that if I remove the '=tex' from 'xetex=tex' and start up
a new zsh, all is good.

I think this is a zsh issue/bug, not a texlive issue.

Cheers.
                                Jim

I think it is not a TeX Live issue, look for instance here

It contains links to other resources.

[Texdoc 3.4.1 (2022-03-19), without personal configuration file]


How is language-specific documentation selected?  For example, the
default language environment settings on my GNU/Linux box are

```
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=de
```

Doing one of the following

```
texdoc impnattypo
LANGUAGE=en texdoc impnattypo
```

however, displays `impnattypo-fr.pdf`.  I have to say

```
LANG= texdoc impnattypo
```

to eventually get `impnattypo.pdf`.

This behaviour doesn't look right to me.  Why is the `LANGUAGE`
setting ignored?  And, more severe: Why is `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` ignored?

Hi,

we noticed that our locale setting detection from ENV vars is somewhat incomplete, and working on fixing it: https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/issues/77

At the moment, writing an explicit locale setting (lang) in your texdoc.cnf is the most stable way to tell which language you prefer for the program.

Best,
Takuto

Hi,

good to know, Can you implement in texdoc.cnf something similar to
Accept-Language as used on the web? For instance, my mother tongue is
Czech and I can easily read the documentation in Slovak, English,
Russian, Hindi, Danish, Norwegian (bokm?l prefered to nynorsk),
Swedish but not in German, French, Spanish, Greek. Everybody has
different preferences.

I suggest that texdoc uses the standard POSIX mechanism for that:

```
LANGUAGE=sk:en:ru:hi:da:nb:nn:sv
```

I've found that texdoc now only seems to recognise LC_ALL. Previously it 
picked up the localisation setting correctly without LC_ALL set. I have 
LANG=en_GB.utf8 and LANGUAGE=en which used to be sufficient to select 
English documentation. (There was a thread about it a few months ago.)

In the end I created ~/texmf/texdoc/texdoc.cnf and put the following 
line in it:

lang = en

Nice! The drawback is that such a modification would be erased by an
update of the `zsh` package of the GNU/Linux distribution. Do you know
if it is possible to have a local version of this configuration file?

OK. In such a case, sorry for the noise.

I have to correct myself.  The `LANGUAGE` environment variable is not
POSIX but the standard behaviour of GNU gettext; see

  https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html
  https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/The-LANGUAGE-variable.html

Not sure whether it is possible to build texdoc on all platforms with
gettext...

I do not know, many configuration files to many tools can be added to
"something.d" directories which survive update or can also be
overriden in user's home. In addition, redhat based distros can detect
that a configuration files has user modification and the update will
not overwrite it but will be put to something.conf.new and the admin
has to choose what to do with it. Anyway, you should contact the
maintainers f your distro as well as zsh maintainers because other
users will have the same problem unless it is reported by someone and
fixed.

I tried moving the edited file to my ~/.zsh-functions (which is one of
the directories in my fpath variable) and restoring the original
/usr/share/zsh/5.8/functions/_tex file.  This would stay with you over
zsh system upgrades, but that might not be a good thing, since you
might miss out on updates to zsh's _tex file.

[[ As was mentioned, the right thing to do (if the problem persists, see
below) is to file a bug report with the zsh people. ]]

After the file moving above, I started up a new shell, which recreated
~/.zcompdump.

After this, xetex (and xelatex (?!)) did The Right Thing.  I then
deleted the file from my ~/.zsh-functions directory, deleted
~/.zcompdump, and started a new shell, which recreated the .zcompdump
file.

Things still work now.  I have no explanation for this, other than the
fact that possibly my older .zcompdump had something wrong in it.
Unfortunately, that is a file I don't back up, so I can't look and see
what was there.

Good luck.

Message-ID: <1667852176451.2962644283.3275290078@mokraemer.de>

Hi,
I'm the packager of texlive for mageia. 
I'm wondering if we can clearify the scripts folder some bit. By default 
there are many files which inside which are executeable but should not be 
(e.g. README, jar-files, yaml, ...)
Additionally we have scripts here which are or should be exposed via 
/usr/bin. I assume many maintainers have lists what to link and some 
symlinks like (euptex -> uplatex, texdef -> latexdef). But I was wondering 
if everybody needs to make the same effort. Can't we just have a folder 
with scripts to expose and their name? In my build process I have a bunch 
of find with excludes and symlinks etc. I find this error prone and it is 
hard to maintain.

I'd suggest to have a folder (e.g. export-scripts) with symlinks to the 
real files, which can be installed/symlinked by any maintainer.

What do you think?

Marc

Message-ID: <9e52aaf181350275acbc@heytings.org>


Hi,

I use Debian's distribution of TeX Live.  The path of the texmf.cnf file 
is /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf, and it says:

If you modify this original file, YOUR CHANGES WILL BE LOST when it is 
updated.  Instead, put your changes -- and only your changes, not an 
entire copy! -- in ../../texmf.cnf.

However, creating a /usr/share/texlive/texmf.cnf file with the following 
content:

openout_any = a

seems to have no effect: the default setting (openout_any = p) from the 
main texmf.cnf file is still used.

Am I doing something wrong?  Or is this some (possibly Debian-specific) 
bug?

Thanks.

(Would be better on tldistro, but anyway ...)

    there are many files which inside which are executeable but should not be 
    (e.g. README, jar-files, yaml, ...)

If you can make a list of the bogus exec files, I'll change them to be
non-exec. I imagine they were exec on CTAN and I didn't notice when
installing in TL.

    symlinks like (euptex -> uplatex, texdef -> latexdef). 

I admit I've never entirely (or need to) understand how distros handle
this. Maybe any distro maintainers here could chime in.

The format symlinks are created by the texlinks script.
It is run via the run-texlinks target, defined in
Build/source/texk/texlive/tl_support/Makefile.am.

The "extra" links like latexdef are defined by the bin_links variable in
Build/source/texk/texlive/linked_scripts/Makefile.am.

There is a file
Build/source/texk/texlive/linked_scripts/scripts.lst
which defines all the scripts that are the targets of symlinks in the
bin directories. I could easily add the bin_links definition to that
file, which I guess would theoretically provide enough information to
reconstruct the links.

    I'd suggest to have a folder (e.g. export-scripts) with symlinks to
    the real files, which can be installed/symlinked by any maintainer.

I could construct a directory of symlinks by extracting them from the
result of "make install" (what ends up in, e.g.,
Build/source/inst/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu). But that would not
necessarily be in sync with anything but the development source, which
doesn't seem especially helpful.

If you want the symlinks corresponding to what is currently being
distributed to users, you can get that from any checkout or installation
of the source, in the bin directories.

It occurs to me that maybe your real question is one step back from all
that. My assumption has been that everything in the TL bin directories
may be included in /usr/bin by distros if they so choose.  (I complain
to authors when they use too-short/too-generic names.)  If you want to
skip some of them, that's fine too, but I can't know which ones those
are ... what would be useful? --thanks, karl.

I'm not on Debian, so my comment may be off.  TLGuide says[1]:

  All texmf.cnf files in the search path will be read and definitions in
  earlier files override those in later files. For example, with a
  search path of .:$TEXMF, values from ./texmf.cnf override those from
  $TEXMF/texmf.cnf

Try the following in a shell:

  kpsewhich -a texmf.cnf

to see the order.  HTH.

Thanks a lot, it does help!  This was the missing piece, I did know about 
kpsewhich but did not know that it was used for config files, too.  FTR, 
on Debian local modifications to texmf.cnf are in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/, and 
update-texmf generates a /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf file.

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "arXiv access and the TeX Macro Store". It has two
related topics.

First up is Shamsi Brinn. She will give a brief presentation on arXiv?s
goal, and user research collected so far, around making the scientific
research papers they host (90% of which come in as LaTeX) accessible to all
regardless of disability. arXiv is the world?s first and largest preprint
server, making STEM research available to everyone without paywalls. Shamsi
is the UX Manager at arXiv and is leading the user research that will guide
their accessibility efforts.

Second up is Jonathan Fine. The LaTeX submissions to the arXiv depend on
author and publisher (the arXiv) having sufficiently identical LaTeX
installations. It would of course be most helpful if authors and the arXiv
had sufficiently identical LaTeX to accessible output (such as XML/HTML)
installations. This of course relates to modernising CTAN and TeXLive
infrastructure. There's no need for curation to change.

Jonathan will give us a sneak preview of recent work in this area. The
technical details are at:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/11/10/arxiv-access-and-tex-macro-store/

There's also a Git repository, which on Github is opaque (as its use of Git
is unusual):
https://github.com/jfine2358/tex-macro-store.

Hi Marc

sorry for being late in the game. Debian packager here.
Everything below is how we do it in Debian, which was the first
dist that properly packaged TL ;-)

>     symlinks like (euptex -> uplatex, texdef -> latexdef). 

manually maintained. Don't change that often. One could use 
> Build/source/texk/texlive/tl_support/Makefile.am.

as Karl mentioned.

For the scripts, in Debian we use:
> Build/source/texk/texlive/linked_scripts/scripts.lst

There still remains considerable hacking - at least in Debian - to
conform to Debian standards and de-duplication of package data etc
etc. If you are interested, the packaging is on github.
	debian-tex/texlive-nonbin
	debian-tex/texlive-bin

Message-ID: <07e069ba-56c1-f327-2829-f6abe107a966@howhill.com>

Hello,

I run TeXLive on Linux Mint, but I've been unable to update or install 
new TeXLive packages for quite some time because tlmgr is outdated. I 
would use update-tlgmr-latest, but it is common on Ubuntu for the 
kpsewhich command the script runs to return filesystem root, which 
doesn't seem very helpful.

There are instructions for this eventuality, involving adding a TeXLive 
path to $PATH, but I am unsure about which path is needed. I think the 
Ubuntu package fiddles with where things are installed a bit, which 
doesn't make the answer obvious.

I hope someone here can help me out.

Best wishes,
	Willow

update-tlmgr-latest does not work with the Debian/Ubuntu/Mint packages.

Your best bet is to install TeX Live from TUG directly, and at the same
time install an equivs package so that you don't have two copies.
(Or, just have two copies if you are not low on disk space).

See https://tug.org/texlive/debian.html under
	"Integrating vanilla TeX Live with Debian"

All the best

Hi Willow,

since many years I work with the ubuntu installation of TeXLive. This for the reason that you need a proper packages system like apt to keep an installation running for years on many PCs, notebooks and all the other devices.
Since ubuntu uses the debian texlive packages I have a debian testing in parallel in a virtual machine, just to see if the debian testing people solved problems meanwhile that still occur within the ubuntu installation. And I use the bug tracking system for debian testing to document the bugs.
And third I use a portable installation of TeXLive within my account, just to make sure, that the TeXLive People does not have the errors anymore, which are still within debian and ubuntu. Only this installation is up to date to the TeXLive System and will be hold in this status.
So, you see, sometimes it is hard to find the right way. If you would like or need to work with tlmgr a local (portable) installation within your account is the most effective. If you have to administrate an armada of devices, a local installation could be too much time consuming therefore.


Greetings -- Harald

Subject: Generate all significant recent states of TeX Live
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf800Y2W22GMpEChFafPj6z4nUW9c88gRSStmo0AAdiTyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

My present project is to systematically generate all recent significant
states of TeX Live, as experienced by users who regularly update their
systems.

My starting point is the 2022 TeXLive ISO, for which:
$ ls texlive/archive | head -5
12many.doc.r15878.tar.xz
12many.r15878.tar.xz
12many.source.r15878.tar.xz
2up.doc.r55076.tar.xz
2up.r55076.tar.xz

My first task is texmf-dist/tex/latex. I assume (or hope) that the LaTeX
packages in this archive are systematically generated from the SVN
repository by some script, or if not are at least logged somewhere.

I have found Norbert's most helpful pages:
https://www.texlive.info/
https://texlive.info/tlnet-archive/
https://texlive.info/tlnet-archive/2022/11/10/tlnet/archive/ # Sample
listing

What I am at present a bit short of is documentation about how the
texlive/archive directory of packages is created. I was hoping there might
be a script in the (enormous) SVN repository. However, my initial poking
around hasn't turned up much. Places I've looked include:

https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html
https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html

If anyone here can help with some pointers, links or advice it would be
much appreciated. And I am grateful to Norbert for the information and
resources provided on texlive.info.

As Neils Bohr didn't say: Archives are difficult, particularly when they
record the past.

[Neils Bohr is supposed to have said: Prediction is difficult, particularly
when it involves the future.]

The last two TeX Hour videos give motivation for and some detail about this
archiving project of mine:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/10/27/fun-games-git-fossil/
https://texhour.github.io/2022/11/10/arxiv-access-and-tex-macro-store/

---

In case you're interested, the rest of this message is about tomorrow's TeX
Hour. The topic is "Less is more ? micropublishing".

The term ?micropublishing? has several meanings. An old use is microfilm
(and for spies the microdot). Today we use it to mean rapidly published
short research communications. Typically, it places new findings directly
into information discovery spaces.

We?re pleased to have Kaveh Bazargan as a special guest. Kaveh runs River
Valley Technologies, who provide technical services and innovation to STEM
publishers.

For most purposes most importantly these two:

https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-tlpdb
https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-containers

If you want to regenerate all of TeX Live you might need other scripts,
too.

Hi

I suggest being a bit more specific in the questions you are asking, it
is hard to guess what you want to know. And sorry, no, I have no
intention to read your mind, that would probably make me sleepless for a
few months.

> What I am at present a bit short of is documentation about how the

	mkdir ?

This is how directories are created on Unix.

If you ask how the contents of these directories are created:

	rsync of the master tlnet running via cron every day once.

If you ask how the original packages (.tar.xz) are created:

	Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-tlpdb
	Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-containers

are the basic scripts. You can look at the script I used to update the
tlcontrib repository to see how it is done:

	https://github.com/TeX-Live/tlcontrib/blob/master/update.sh

But above all ... you could have read the document that I have written
that explains everything ...

Subject: Packaging of a standalone program (Digestif)
Message-ID: <87sfihwqeh.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to distribute a standalone Lua program through TeXLive:
Digestif, a language server for TeX (available at
https://github.com/astoff/digestif).  It's written in Lua and has no
dependencies other than the texlua interpreter, which should make
packaging relatively straightforward.

Following the CTAN submission instructions, I would simply put all
relevant files in a zip archive following the directory structure of my
Git repo.  But then TeXLive would still have to decide where to place
the files in its own directory structure and make sure the executable
script works as intended in all platforms.

Therefore I'm writing to ask how I should organize my CTAN submission to
make sure everything works smoothly.  In case that helps, the program is
already available on LuaRocks and I can provide a rockspec file.

Or perhaps you are able to pull the code directly from LuaRocks, so that
I don't need to submit the program to CTAN?

Thanks,
Augusto

Hi Augusto,

    https://github.com/astoff/digestif

Interesting. Apart from all else, would you like to write an article for
TUGboat about it? (Info: https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html)

    Therefore I'm writing to ask how I should organize my CTAN submission to
    make sure everything works smoothly.  

Usually nothing special is required, but your package is unusual, so
thanks for asking.

    then TeXLive would still have to decide where to place the files in
    its own directory structure 

Indeed. And in your case, that is not obvious to me.
Are the contents of all the subdirectories required at runtime?
Are the subdirectories themselves required?

Is bin/digestif the only thing that needs to wind up in TL's bin/* dirs?
I hope so.

Maybe the best would be for you to tell me what the installed structure
should be.  (Offline is fine, no need to burden the list with every
detail.)

Also, looking at the repo, I see one stopper right away: the files are
named generically, such as "config.lua" and "bibtex.lua". All files that
end up in TL's runtime must be uniquely named, typically with some
version of the package name as a prefix. For example, "dgsf-config.lua"
and "dgsf-bibtex.lua". Hope that won't be a problem for you.

    and make sure the executable script
    works as intended in all platforms.

FYI, I don't typically test anything myself (utterly infeasible :).
I install things to the best of my abilities and if I mess up,
authors/users usually inform me pretty quickly.

    Or perhaps you are able to pull the code directly from LuaRocks, so
    that I don't need to submit the program to CTAN?

Reasonable idea, but I have no infrastructure to work with LuaRocks.
Must go through CTAN. --thanks again, karl.

Hi,

It looks like the dvisvgm binary distributed with texlive can only deal 
with ghostscript versions up to 9.? Because some linux distros have 
already moved to ghostscript 10, the dvisvgm binary in texlive has 
reduced functionality there.

Thanks for considering this issue,

Hi,

unfortunately, a plain rebuild is not sufficient to solve the issue 
because GS 10 introduced changes regarding the visibility of some 
symbols provided by the library. Also, the dvisvgm code must be updated 
to look for the new GS library.

Here are the two patches that are required to fix this:

https://github.com/mgieseki/dvisvgm/commit/9bf81fd0b6e7876e5079e917ed7e12163b9e7f7f

They do not appear particularly scary. Can it be expected that the dvisvgm package in texlive
is updated with them? Or will it be necessary to wait for a new official release of dvisvgm
to be accepted in texlive?

Hi

TeX-Live readers may have a special interest in next week's meeting. It
makes a case for an at most 100MB distribution of TeX-Live whose target is
WASM and the web browser:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/12/01/less-more-make-tex-small/

The rest of this message is general interest TeX Hour matters.

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is a Thanksgiving Social. The special STEM access
meeting has been rescheduled to 19 January 2023. Here are the URLs:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/11/24/thanksgiving/
https://texhour.github.io/2023/01/19/stem-access-author-reader/

Next week (was STEM access) I'll talk about my wish to make TeX small again
(as less is sometimes more):
https://texhour.github.io/2022/12/01/less-more-make-tex-small/

As usual, the TeX Hour is 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time (currently GMT), with the
zoom URL at:
https://texhour.github.io/about/

The video for last week (Less is more --- micropublishing) is at:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/11/17/less-more-micropublish/

You'll find a list of all planned future meetings, and links to videos of
recent past meetings at:
https://texhour.github.io/

All are welcome, even if you don't use TeX. There are gaps in the schedule.
Please suggest topics and speakers, or even just volunteer yourself. We
have special interests in accessibility, communication, open source,
technology and publishing.

with best regards

Jonathan

I don't plan to ask for any rebuild of dvisvgm or anything else before
TL23. The work (by all the builders) is not worth the benefit, IMHO.
The users for whom it is critical can either install an older
ghostscript, or install a newer dvisvgm, outside of TL. Admittedly it's
not ideal, but I did not create this drastically gratuitous
incompatibility and am not so interested in spending extra time dealing
with it. Sorry. --best, karl.

Hi Augusto,

I've also written a Lua project <https://github.com/zepinglee/citeproc-lua> and
it works in TeX Live.  I hope the following helps.

The path finding scheme in LuaTeX with TDS is different from standard Lua.
Besides the file name issue mentioned by Karl, the code related to path finding
may also need adaption for TDS. In general, `kpse.set_program_name("luatex")`
is required in the main executable script to load Lua modules from the TDS (see
also section 4.2.2 in the LuaTeX manual).  It replaces `package.searchers[2]`
with the kpse loader which, unlike in standard Lua, looks for Lua modules by
only their basenames.  This means
`TEXMF/scripts/digestif/digestif-langserver.lua` can be loaded via
`require("digestif-langserver")` (provided it's prepended with`digestif-`).
The `.tags` files can be put in `TEXMF/tex/generic/digestif/`and they are
accessed via `kpse.find_file("digestif-primitives.tags")` .

BTW, you can install the files to `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME` to test the
TDS structure.

Understandable...

unfortunately, installing an older ghostscript is not very 
strightforward, at least on linux. First, the very ghostcript site 
*loudly* advertises version 10 as the current one and even has a large 
"Please update ghostscript" sign with a scary "!" in a triangular alert 
sign. Older releases are now hidden behind a small bottom line "Old 
releases available here". Secondly, the binaries provided on the site do 
not appear to split out "libgs" as needed by the TL dvisvgm.

The matter is similarly not so nice with dvisvgm. The software is so 
tied up with the specialized dvi format that finding binaries is not 
really very easy (e.g. in arch/manjaro it is not even available in the 
huge "aur" repo). Some distros only ship it as part of their TeX offer, 
which unfortunately should not be installed if you want to use the TL 
distro. Upstream does not provide binaries for linux.

All this basically mean that users in distros shipping gs 10 will need 
to install from source (either gs 9 or dvisvgm 2.1.4 or the pre-release 
of version 3).

It is clear that trying to fix this in TL 2022 might look inefficient. 
To avoid similar issues in the future, maybe TL could include its own 
libgs (e.g. as part of the very dvisvgm package, assuming that this is 
the only package needing it). As it is today, the situation is using 
your own words not ideal, because TL is expected to be compatible with 
many flavors of Unix and unfortunately the functionality is somehow 
reduced on a few Linuxes including some that are rather mainstream 
(arch, manjaro, debian sid, KaOS, OpenMandriva Rolling, with OpenSuse 
Tumbleweed expected to join shortly).

Best,

Sergio

Hi Sergio,
if compiling the sources is the problem I suggest that for the time
being people who are able to compile dvisvgm put their binaries
somewhere where others can download them.  In order to find out where
to put these binaries

   kpsewhich -var-value SELFAUTOLOC

is quite helpful.

We probably don't get binaries for all platforms supported by TeX Live
this way but I think that this is a reasonable workaround until
TL-2023 is released.

As far as Linux distributors are concerned I think that if they ship
the latest version of Ghostscript they should also ship the latest
version of dvisvgm.  I'm sure that they'll do, assumed that they are
aware of the problem.  It's just one dependeny among many others.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Actually on the Mac there's another Ghostscript-related patch

https://github.com/mgieseki/dvisvgm/commit/91fc7f5bec8d734d0d40443627f30ebeb8824269

The problem is caused by changes in macOS, and arises on macOS 13 Ventura (from a month ago) and possibly the latest versions of macOS 12 Monterey earlier this year.

dlopen(), used by dvisvgm to find libgs, no longer searches /usr/local/lib when used in a hardened runtime such as distributed by MacTeX. It only searches /usr/lib (which cannot be modified even by root), not /usr/local/lib (which can). For everywhere outside /usr/lib, a full path is required.

So libgs isn't found, even though MacTeX installs it as an optional extra.

I agree with karl though: there's no need for a binary rebuild before TL 2023, the problem is easily taken care of using --libgs or exporting LIBGS.

Subject: PFA format not usable with XeTeX
Message-ID: <3C2D5D00-BC00-4325-9CB5-F29C4CA0E597@gmail.com>

At least one font, namely pigpen, can't be used with XeTeX, because its
Type1 version is stored as a PFA file.

I made an experiment and converting to a PFB file but keeping the
extension .pfa avoids the problem of xdvipdfmx not allowing PFA fonts:
the file is found by the kpse library and read in correctly.

The solution should be simple: convert the file to a PFB and fix the
entry in the map file ?pigpen.map?.

Possibly Oliver Corff might be convinced to push an update himself.

Source of the problem: https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/666699/4427

It works on windows by converting the font with mktexpk to a bitmap
as one can see if one zooms in. In linux systems the mktexpk call
seems to fail. In any case using a proper vector font is better
anyway, so it would be good if texlive would add a pfb and a
suitable map entry.

Why do you keep the pfa extension after conversion to PFB? The
extension should be changed. In addition, fontforge should also be
able to convert it to OpenType.

I didn't. Enrico tested that, mainly to avoid to have to adapt the
map-file too. Naturally it is better to use the correct extension.

Sergio - lacking any other solution, maybe the simplest way for you to
be able to proceed with your work is to build a patched dvisvgm from the
TL source.  https://tug.org/texinfohtml/tlbuild.html#Build-one-package

Patch the dvisvgm source as needed after downloading, before doing the
build, naturally. -k

P.S. There's a typo "buil" in a comment on that web page, which will be

Hi Hannes,

    not defined.e scheme-basic        <------------ this here
    on-langpolish 0

The output is being mangled, so there's no way to know what it is that's
"not defined". Maybe you can separate stdout/stderr/whatever else.
I doubt scheme-basic (or collection-langpolish) are the problem.
More likely some kind of obscure Perl error (just a wild guess).

Also, I don't understand why it's repeating the profile in the output,
which is apparently what's causing the mangling. That's not
something install-tl does. Maybe it's somehow writing the "output"
profile to the terminal output in your environment?

FWIW, I get no error with install-tl --profile /your/pro/file
with current TL. --best regards, karl.

Cool project!  I'd venture say this is the right way to do
bibliographies: besides tapping into a huge style collection, there's no
need for intermediate programs.

The issue is that I don't want to rename the files, because I want to
retain the usual hierarchical module system that distinguishes
require("digestif.util") from require("other_program.util") from
require("util").

In any case, after talking with Karl I figured out a way to avoid
renaming anything by teaching the Lua module loader to look into zip
files.  I'll make this available when I get the time to finish working
out the details.

Yes.  You can also just place the files in the current directory since

     $ kpsewhich -var-brace-value TEXINPUTS | awk -F: '{print $1}'
     .

which in my view is a potential security issue in LuaTeX.  For instance,
if someone sends you a directory containing a file citeproc.so and a tex
file that eventually calls require("citeproc"), then they can get your
machine to execute arbitrary code from citeproc.so if kpathsearch
doesn't find a file citeproc.lua somewhere else (e.g. if you haven't
installed citeproc-lua yet).

I think it should be a goal of LuaTeX to be safe to run it on a
directory containing evil files.  This is especially true if scripts
with the "#!/usr/bin/env texlua" shebang become common.  (Of course one
should always assume TEXMFHOME and the system TeX directories only
contain trusted code, otherwise you can't get anywhere.)

That's exactly the reason why loading .so files is only enabled if
`--shell-escape` is enabled. If you use shell escape compiling untrusted
documents can lead to arbitrary code execution anyway, without shell escape
LuaTeX will not load citeproc.so.

Thanks Karl,

I managed finally to get it to work by totally redoing all the involved
files from the original pandoc source and re-adding the required
customization changes carefully. Don't know what happened there either, but
the error appeared consistently at the same location.

Ah, good.  This detail is not mentioned in the manual.

But the issue I described still applies to scripts with the

     #!/usr/bin/env texlua

shebang, as provided by citeproc-lua and certainly a number of other
packages.  Unless every package author remembers to say

   os.setenv("TEXMFDOTDIR", "/lets/be/safe")

or use

    #!/usr/bin/env -S TEXMFDOTDIR=/dev/null texlua

or similar, a certain level of vulnerability is present.  (Note also
that this solution is not completely portable among OS.  What is a
directory name that's more or less guaranteed not to exist on Windows?)

Thanks for the link, looks promising!

I have tried to go through the documentation and I still miss a few 
pieces. From the steps described in that document, I understand that the 
build process will give me a /tree/ (the tree in the build directory).

- Is it possible to `make install` a single package?

- How will `tlmgr` deal with something installed in this way? Can this 
lead to trouble in the long time?

- Is it possible to make a standard TeX Live package file (with 
contained tlpobj file) that I can pass to other people and that can be 
installed via `tlmgr install --file`?

Thanks for any further pointer,

Tried to get a binary and then to make a tar.xz package with it, by 
downloading the standard tar.gz package for the file and substituting 
the patched executable `dvisvgm`.

This works, however:

- tlmgr gives a weird warning: TeXLive::TLUtils::check_file_and_remove: 
neither checksum nor checksize available for 
/tmp/VjScgU1jD8/ujEJh0D00m/dvisvgm.x86_64-linux.t
ar.xz, cannot check integrity

- seems strange there is not an automatized tool to built the tar.xz package

For those who might want to try it, package is here 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tf0q2TxXIlrg02BYRXmfWC26X6ASkvZN/view?usp=sharing

Any clue?

Hi Sergio - well, you already did the work, but since I already wrote
this reply, I'll send it anyway.

    - Is it possible to `make install` a single package?

I suppose it's possible, but more complex, and not needed here.
The "make install" writes to a destination directory under the build
tree, so there's no harm in installing everything, and lots more work to
avoid doing so.

In the case of dvisvgm, all you need is the single binary file,
which you can copy from the build directory Work/texk/dvisvgm/
(unstripped), or the Work/inst/... installed tree (stripped).

    - How will `tlmgr` deal with something installed in this way? 

It won't. You can "install" the binary by doing, for example:

cp .../bin/x86_64-linux/dvisvgm{,.dist}  # save old
cp .../Work/texk/dvisvgm/dvisvgm .../bin/x86_64-linux/dvisvgm
cp .../Work/texk/dvisvgm/dvisvgm .../bin/x86_64-linux/dvisvgm.new # second copy

    Can this lead to trouble in the long time?

No. tlmgr will not notice that this has been done.

I don't expect the dvisvgm package to be updated before TL23, but if it
is, you can just overwrite the reinstalled binary again from the "second
copy".

    - Is it possible to make a standard TeX Live package file (with 
    contained tlpobj file) that I can pass to other people and that can be 
    installed via `tlmgr install --file`?

I guess it's theoretically possible, but I wouldn't advise it. It would
be a lot simpler and more reliable to simply send your friends the
new binary.

I would also suggest asking Martin G about the current status of his
gs10 support before doing all this. Maybe he has more patches by
now. Also, once he makes a release, we can update the TL sources (not
binaries), which would simplify that much.

Sorry for the extra work, but it seems the best way available at the
moment, in this bad situation inflicted on us by others. --best, karl.

P.S. I don't suppose
  export GS_OPTIONS=-dNEWPDF=false
suffices for gs10?

Yes, because the checksums come from the tlpdb, and you are installing
directly from tar.gz. I guess the warning should be silenced in this
case ;-)

There is of course
	Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-update-containers
but all is tweaked to building from a standard layout. The container
itself is trivial and as you found, just a tar.xz, plus the .tlpobj
file.

On what?

Or put
	update-exclude = dvisvgm.x86_64-linux
into your tlmgr.conf file.

You did install it, right? It works.

Thanks Norbert, Karl you have been extremely helpful!? Sorry Karl for 
having wasted some of your time by asking you a question and then 
finding out how to build the package while you were answering...

My package appears to work, so I think that the gs10 I have still has 
the old pdf interpreter and dvisvgm is able to use it. Because dvisvgm 
directly plugs into libgs, it can probably get to the old interpreter 
without the need to set any environment variable (like 
`GS_OPTIONS=-dNEWPDF=false`).

In case I find some misbehavior, I'll write to the list and if needed to 
the dvisvgm author.

Some final notes about the experience, in case someone finds them useful:

1. The reason why I need gs support in dvisvgm is that I use it to 
convert pdfs made with lualatex to svg, for import in Libreoffice 
(reusing pieces of articles for slides, for example). In principle 
Libreoffice should be able to import PDFs but the way in which it does 
it is still very broken IMHO (a solid white background is introduced, 
PDF is transformed into a bitmap for rendering with a fixed and not very 
good resolution, etc.). Incidentally, having a good pdf->svg path 
working out of the box in texlive (regardless of the distro choices) 
could in principle enable the excellent texmaths add on for Libreoffice 
(that let you write math via a latex engine) to add support the lualatex 
engine in addition to xelatex and latex, permitting the use of packages 
that use lua.

2. For TL23 we should be fine (probably by that time dvisvgm 3 will also 
be released). Also ghostscript will stay at version 10 for some time. 
However, an issue similar to the present one may re-surface when gs 11 
is released. Even if dvisvgm is moving to a different pdf interpreter, I 
think libgs will still be needed for dvi files with postscript specials. 
I wonder if TL or TLcontrib should not include a ghostscript or a libgs 
package providing its own libgs for cases where the system libgs is 
unaligned with the requirements.

3. Even if for the dvisvgm case (where you basically have a single 
binary) trying to build a package for tlmgr may appear an overkill 
(given that you can merely copy the file in the appropriate place), I 
still see value in it. On one hand, for unexperienced users it is way 
easier to `tlmgr install --file` than to `cp` getting the destination 
right. On the other hand, a similar necessity may occur for packages 
including more than a single file in the future. For this reason 
learning something about the process was interesting to me. In 
perspective, I think that having a sort of `aur` or `ppa` for texlive 
would be nice.

Thanks again,

Sergio

Hi Sergio,

thanks for the many useful comments, I will digest them in time.
Just one thing:

> interesting to me. In perspective, I think that having a sort of `aur` or
> `ppa` for texlive would be nice.

Already here, everyone can set up their own repos
	https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/doc/repository-setup.txt?view=markup
in fact there are a few
- tlcontrib (by me)
- tltexjp (by the Japanese TeX Dev Team, me)
- AFAIR koma-script has some testing repo
maybe others.

tlcontrib has scripts that show how to use a git repo for building
custom repos:
	https://github.com/TeX-Live/tlcontrib
the update.sh should show what is needed.

Best

TL22 reverted back to GS 9.56.1. Is this not necessary then and TL could
get back to GS 10?

Not sure what you mean by either (revert back to GS 9.56.1 or get back to GS 10).

MacTeX 2022 <https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html> includes GS 9.55, and separate packages for GS 9.56.1 and 10.00 are available from Dick Koch's page <https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/> (Dick being the person who builds MacTeX).

Using GS 9.55 or 9.56.1 solves the issue of TL22's dvisvgm requiring GS 9.

But the other issue, specific to macOS 13 Ventura and the latest versions of macOS 12 Monterey (I don't know when exactly dlopen changed its behaviour, the man page describing the new behaviour is dated January 20, 2022), is not a matter of GS 9 vs. 10. It's a matter of /usr/local/lib no longer being in the default search path for libgs (when the dvisvgm runtime is hardened, as is required for distribution inside a package such as MacTeX).

You need to use either of

dvisvgm --libgs=/usr/local/lib/libgs.dylib
env LIBGS=/usr/local/lib/libgs.dylib dvisvgm

(or put an "export LIBGS=/usr/local/lib/libgs.dylib" in your ~/.zprofile).

I just tested on my setup (MacTeX 2022, Ghostscript 10.00, Ventura 13.1 Beta), to be sure. Without:

This doesn't solve, though, the third issue mentioned by Martin Gieseking, about the GS changes regarding the visibility of some symbols. For these, it's likely you need to rebuild. As Karl wrote in a message, this is reasonably simple. On the Mac, you need Xcode or the Command Line Tools (installed with "xcode-select --install").

What I did is based on the instructions at <https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html#Build-one-package> with one change (rsync is blocked by my university's firewall, and macOS no longer includes svn):

- Get the TeX Live 2022 sources (68 MB) from one of the mirrors listed at <https://tug.org/historic/>, for example

https://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2022/texlive-20220321-source.tar.xz

- Unpack, apply the three patches

Hi,

somewhat off topic but is there a reason why you go through PDF instead
of generating DVI from LuaLaTeX and then converting that with dvisvgm?

Are you using something which breaks in dvilualatex?

Best,
Marcel

Hi

I'm very pleased to see the progress made on this list, regarding the
rebuild of dvisvgm to support Ghostscript 10. I'm sure many are grateful to
all who contributed. As a friend says, working together we can make things
better.

By good chance, tomorrow's TeX Hour "Make TeX Small Again" is relevant to
this thread. Sergio Callegari, the original poster, has told us that his
use case is importing already typeset material into LibreOffice (for use in
slides, for example).

In the following post from 2019 to tex.sx the use case is creating
standalone SVG by using tikz, and the failure is improved security in
GhostScript (as is the present failure).
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/521351/dvisvgm-dvi-to-svg-issue

Here are two elements of the relevance of "Make TeX Small". The first is
that TikZ is a lovely fairly small TeX application, that can be used
standalone for technical illustration in both PDF and (with for example
dvisvgm) SVG. I think many people who don't know TeX would use TikZ as an
illustration package, particularly if it were packaged as a small
stand-alone app (say 50MB if possible).

The second is for testing compatibility of dvisvgm with new versions of
Ghostscript. If a packaged TikZ app were only 50MB, then it becomes much
more practical to incorporate this testing into a continuous integration
environment.

The third (an off-by-one error) is that a small stand-alone app for TikZ
would make it much easier for people to share, edit and reprocess  the
source for TikZ graphics.

If you're interested in the TeX Hour tomorrow all are welcome. Details are
here:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/12/01/less-more-make-tex-small/

By the way, if you use TikZ you might also be interested in the approach
taken by:
https://vega.github.io/vega/
https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/
https://altair-viz.github.io

Also by the way, I've just found this related question

Hi,

besides the already mentioned issues with GS 10.0, the upcoming GS 10.1 
will completely break dvisvgm's PDF functionality because Artifex is 
finally going to remove the old PostScript-based PDF interpreter from 
GS. Unfortunately, the new C-based one doesn't allow for overriding PS 
operators which is required for dvisvgm to interact with the interpreter 
during the conversion process.

In order to keep the PDF functionality available, I've added an 
alternative PDF handler that uses mutool (part of mupdf) as a helper 
utility. As long as a GS version < 10.1 is present, the current 
mechanism is used, though. The new additions will be part of dvisvgm 3. 
It also comes with a newly implemented font writer module replacing the 
outdated, bundled FontForge library.

Regards,
Martin
