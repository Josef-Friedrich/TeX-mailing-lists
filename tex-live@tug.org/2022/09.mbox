Hi

There's now one fewer major project using subversion. "The project [WebKit]
will now adopt the Git tool for version tracking and the GitHub service as
host for its source code. It previously used Apache's source code
management system, Subversion (aka svn)."

Here's the story https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/01/webkit_migrates/.

with best regards

Jonathan

Subject: TeX Hour: Thu 9 Sep - Jekyll + LaTeX compared. Thu 29 Sep - Rethink
 TeX in STEM
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf88EgZRp9T2X0p-xz0uU8rAS1yR-DUtvkLKevd7A+KrKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

The TeX Hour now has a website https://texhour.github.io/ and full details
of future meetings will be posted there. The Zoom and YouTube details are
at https://texhour.github.io/about/.

Date: Thursday 8 September, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Title: Publish with Jekyll and LaTeX compared.
This TeX Hour is about publishing. It compares the process with LaTeX (for
PDF) and with Jekyll (for HTML). This includes installation, authoring and
publication.
URL: https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/08/publish-jekyll-and-latex-compared/

Date: Thursday 29 September,  6:30 to 8:30 BST (UK time).
Title: Rethinking TeX in STEM.
This special meeting of the TeX Hour is fortunate to have three special
guests. Peter Williams will speak about Tectonic. Martin Ruckert will speak
about HINT. Dennis M?ller will speak about sTeX.

The 29 September TeX Hour has  two parts. The first hour will be
presentations followed by a panel discussion, with audience questions and
contributions. The second hour, which is optional, will be more like a
workshop. If numbers require we will break into small groups of about 8. It
would help if you could register in advance.
URL: https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/
Register: https://forms.gle/j5opJ7bjkjDJFYJ98

wishing you happy authoring, publishing and reading

Jonathan

You should probably explain you question a bit more.

Noto is available in texlive.

 From my point of view TeX Live (and also CTAN) is not meant as a font 
repository. As long as fonts are publicly available, there is no need to 
add an exact copy in TeX Live. However, there are packages to ease usage 
for a variety of fonts, e.g. for noto (https://ctan.org/pkg/noto).

Best regards,
Martin

    why community dont enter gnu unifont and noto in texlive?

As Martin replied, TL (and CTAN) cannot provide every font in the world.
Although "basic" Noto and Noto Math are in TL, all of Noto (that is, all
the variants for all the scripts / Unicode blocks) would more or less
double the size of TL. That is not feasible.

As for GNU Unifont, it is (by design) low-res bitmaps and only intended
as a final fallback font, not anything one would normally want to
typeset documents with. It also would consume a huge amount of
space. Not worth it IMHO.
 
BTW, the collection-fontsextra is already the single largest (by far)
collection in TL, over 2GB, approximately 25% of the entire
distribution. --best, karl.

Subject: August 30 update of pstricks installs outdated files (from September
 2021),
 triggering incompatibility with XeTeX and Ghostscript transparency
Message-ID: <74F4E77E-458E-4B75-A2B8-8A6BDD8C84D2@icloud.com>

The two attached files test the compatibility of Ghostscript's transparency and pstricks. They typeset fine with latex + dvips + ps2pdf.

Using xelatex-unsafe, they used to typeset fine before the latest update (August 30) of pstricks. With this update, they both give

Error: /typecheck in --restore--
Operand stack:
   --dict:13/22(ro)(L)--   --dict:13/22(ro)(L)--
Execution stack:
   %interp_exit   .runexec2   --nostringval--   restore   --nostringval--   2   %stopped_push   --nostringval--   restore   restore   false   1   %stopped_push   1974   1   3   %oparray_pop   1973   1   3   %oparray_pop   1961   1   3   %oparray_pop   1817   1   3   %oparray_pop   --nostringval--   %errorexec_pop   .runexec2   --nostringval--   restore   --nostringval--   2   %stopped_push   --nostringval--   1878   1   3   %oparray_pop   restore   1859   1   3   %oparray_pop   restore

Looking closer, it seems the pstricks update actually installs outdated versions of pstricks.pro and ps-dots.pro, among others. For pstricks.pro, before the update

	% $Id: pstricks.pro 317 2021-11-16 20:47:25Z herbert $
	%
	%% PostScript prologue for pstricks.tex.
	%% Version 1.41, 2021/11/16

and after it

	% $Id: pstricks.pro 269 2021-09-25 13:47:26Z herbert $
	%
	%% PostScript prologue for pstricks.tex.
	%% Version 1.40, 2021/09/25

For pst-dots.pro, before the update

	% $Id: pst-dots.pro 291 2021-10-01 09:22:45Z herbert $
	%
	%% PostScript prologue for pstricks.tex.
	%% Version 0.02,  2021/10/01

and after it

	% $Id: pst-dots.pro 4 2020-06-09 08:32:19Z herbert $
	%
	%% PostScript prologue for pstricks.tex.
	%% Version 2.02,  2009/06/16

Specifically, here, the above error message vanishes once the ante-penultimate line of pst-dots.pro

	/PSTricksDotFont exch definefont

is commented out.

The problem seems present on CTAN too: for example, the files at <https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/base/dvips> date back to September 2021 and do not include the later updates.

I noticed the problem while testing RC2 of the next Ghostscript, 10.00.0, but finally realized the problem was with pstricks.

This solves the matter indeed. Both test files typeset fine using xelatex-unsafe.

Thanks,

Is anyone having the same issue? Any suggestion is highly appreciated. :)

Hi friends,

Not exactly a good advice, but I made a backup of bin/x86_64-linux/man, 
removed it and then re-ran the update. Everything worked as expected, 
and bin/x86_64-linux/man and its files were regenerated successfully.

Thanks!

Paulo

Not reproducible here on my MacOS MacBook.

Thanks for checking, Norbert. I could not reproduce either in my other 
two machines (Linux), so it was probably a local hiccup. Apologies for 
the noise.

We have recently released a new package "ppt-slides" to CTAN. Could you
please mark its files as "required" for installation:

ppt-templates/*
ppt-schemes/*

They are needed at runtime and must be placed into
"/texmf-dist/tex/latex/". Thanks in advance!

Next week (Thu 22 Sep) I'll present my recent progress on using git as an
archiving and distribution system for the TeX Live distribution. So this
week it's over to you, if you wish.

On Thu 29 Sep (6:30 to 8:30 BST) we have a special TWO HOUR long TeX Hour
focussed on Rethinking TeX in STEM, and with THREE special guests (with
workshops in the second hour).

   - Peter Williams will speak about Tectonic
   - Martin Ruckert will speak about HINT
   - Dennis M?ller will speak about sTeX

https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/

with best regards

Jonathan

Message-ID: <237086d7-6a67-f166-a709-e470cde28f14@uni-klu.ac.at>

When changing from LuaLaTeX, This is LuaTeX Version 1.10.0 (TeX Live 2019/Debian) to This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.14.0 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian) no ligatures are set in \chapter. Also a -- (double minus) is not rendered as a ? (dash). Are there any new options I have to set?? Within the running text and the ToC everything is fine.

This is, when using
\setmainfont[Ligatures={Common,Rare},Numbers=OldStyle,RawFeature={+ss06}]{EB Garamond}

Other fonts seem to work as expected. Is there a way to repair this?

Assuming that this is a fontspec/luaotfload issue, adding "TeX" to the
ligatures list:

   \setmainfont[Ligatures={Common,Rare,TeX},Numbers=OldStyle,RawFeature={+ss06}]{EB Garamond}
   
should (hopefully) fix the dash issue. Adding "Required" or "Contextual"
to the same ligatures list might solve the ligatures issue. 

You can also try adding "Renderer = Node" as a font option, although
that shouldn't (in theory) affect anything here.

More likely this is an issue caused by some unrelated package/class, so
preparing a minimal and complete example would help solve the issue.

if it is only happening for the font of a chapter (ie the bold face) it 
sounds more to me like a font issue. I think I saw a recent EB Garamond 
update, maybe something got wrong there?

I don't think that it's a font issue (or a luaotfload/fontspec issue for
that matter). This minimal example:

   \documentclass{article}
   
   \usepackage{fontspec}
   
   \parindent=0pt
   
   \def\test#1{
       \leavevmode
       \setmainfont[
           Ligatures = {Common, Rare},
           Numbers = OldStyle,
           RawFeature = {+ss06},
       ]{EBGaramond-#1}
       %
       \llap{(#1)}\quad - -- --- fi fl ffi ffl
       \par
   }
   
   \begin{document}
   
   \test{Regular}
   \test{Italic}
   
   \ExplSyntaxOn
   
   \seq_set_from_clist:Nn \l_tmpa_seq {
       Bold,
       ExtraBold,
       Medium,
       SemiBold,
   }
   
   \seq_map_inline:Nn \l_tmpa_seq {
       \test{#1}
       \test{#1Italic}
   }
   
   \ExplSyntaxOff
   
   \end{document}
   
behaves as expected for me with an up-to-date TeX Live 2022. So I suspect
that there's something weird going on elsewhere in your document.

guess my guess was wrong then, I just based it on \chapter normally 
using bold, but if that all works out of the box then it really needs a 
full sample to see what happens in Harald's \chapter definition.

I have a book with 16 included chapters which gives about 800 pages. the
error is not due a special file but is random when I choose different
chapters to compile. Therefore I want to increase the texcapacity in
tex.conf as I used to do it some years ago. While the old tex.conf files
were deleted when new texlive distribution came forward, I no longer
know how to proceed. Looking for "texlive tex.conf" didnot reveal a
single straightforward entry while googling. Thats why I ask here. Where
is the manual to make a tex.conf file?

Hi Harald,

> I posted today an example of what happened

it comes out fine at my end (if you mean the em dash in the title, not 
checked for other differences). But both LaTeX and luaotfload and 
probably also the font files are newer than what you have in your log. 
Is this a Debian native package or is this simply TeX Live you are using?

In any case I think you have to update

Frank

That's the reason for not to overwrite the texmf.cnf of the distribution but 
use a local or user file. See also `texdoc texlive`  and `texdoc kpathsea`.

You can find all currently used texmf.cnf files using

    kpsewhich -a texmf.cnf

Usually the one in ?/texmf-dist/web2c contain also a lot of documentation and 
also the lines:

| % If you modify this original file, YOUR CHANGES WILL BE LOST when it is
| % updated.  Instead, put your changes -- and only your changes, not an
| % entire copy! -- in ../../texmf.cnf.  That is, if this file is
| % installed in /some/path/to/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf,
| % put your custom settings in /some/path/to/texlive/2022/texmf.cnf.
| % (Below, we use YYYY in place of the specific year.)

BTW: 16 chapter and 600 pages are usually not a problem (e.g., the KOMA-Script 
book hat more chapters and more pages). Problems are often memory leaks 
because of mistakes in the document code. So increasing TeX capacities is 
often just poking around the symptoms instead of eliminating the causes.

I should have said that all the EBGaramond warnings from microtype are 
also gone in my log, so  the is is most certainly some missing update 
either of the font (which had a recent update the other day) or one of 
the packages used

I agree with Markus that this is not a large book, I typeset such
books quite often. What I suspect is an endless loop caused probably
by a fragile macro in a caption or a sectioning command. Examine your
.toc, .lot, .lof files or possibly files used by hyperref or other
packages.

well, doesn't mean there aren't any that need fixing (LaTeX for example 
is at patch-level 5 not 1 we we do not put out patches unnecessary) but 
I think it just happened that the Garamond version was wrong in the 
release you had. All we can say it it works with a current TL.

Don't know the ubuntu setup, but I would assume you can make updates to 
TL via tlmgr there too, either for individual packages or for all and 
everything.

try

      man tlmgr

or   tlmgr --help

I do not know if it changed in 22.04, but no --- you can't use tlmgr in 
Ubuntu. TeXLive is packaged in apt, and you have to stick to what they 
decide is going into the upgrades? or add things to your local texmf 
tree. Updates are rare, they stick to a strict "fixes only and only if 
you have a regression test suite" policy normally; 20.04 had a TeXLive 
2019 setup I think till last month.

I am not sure 100% because I switched to install a basic TeXLive with 
apt (to avoid dependency problems) and using a portable TeXLive in my 
home directory.

Dear Frank,

yes, indeed. It seems, that there is something wrong with the installation of the EB Garamond within This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.14.0 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian).
I put a minimal example on
https://wwwu.aau.at/hjele/eb_garamond_example/20220916_eb_garamond.zip
If you change the font from
\setmainfont[Ligatures={Common,Rare},Numbers=OldStyle,RawFeature={+ss06}]{EB Garamond}
to
\setmainfont[Ligatures={Common,Rare},Numbers=OldStyle,RawFeature={+ss06}]{Doulos SIL}
every seems to be ok.

See the delivered wut.log for the font problem. Hope one could fix this :-)


Thanks -- Harald

if it is only happening for the font of a chapter (ie the bold face) it
sounds more to me like a font issue. I think I saw a recent EB Garamond
update, maybe something got wrong there?

guess my guess was wrong then, I just based it on \chapter normally
using bold, but if that all works out of the box then it really needs a
full sample to see what happens in Harald's \chapter definition.

it is what with ubuntu 22.04 LTS comes out of the box:
This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.14.0 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian) format=lualatex 2022.5.13
I hope someone posts what to do.

Hi Harald,

> I posted today an example of what happened

it comes out fine at my end (if you mean the em dash in the title, not
checked for other differences). But both LaTeX and luaotfload and
probably also the font files are newer than what you have in your log.
Is this a Debian native package or is this simply TeX Live you are using?

In any case I think you have to update

Well I can't reproduce it. But microtype reports that your bold font
is missing \textendash:

Package microtype Info: Character `textendash ' is missing
(microtype)             in font `TU/EBGaramond(0)/b/n/17.28'.

According to your log you use the following garamond fonts:

/home/admunix/.local/share/fonts/otf/EBGaramond08-Regular.otf
/home/admunix/.local/share/fonts/otf/1EBGaramond08-Italic.otf
/usr/share/fonts/opentype/ebgaramond/EBGaramond12-Bold.otf
/home/admunix/.local/share/fonts/otf/EBGaramond12-Regular.otf
/home/admunix/.local/share/fonts/otf/EBGaramond12-Italic.otf


This means you are not using the texlive fonts. On my texlive only
these fonts are used:

c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Bold.otf
c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Regular.otf
c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Italic.otf>

You could try to force the use of the texlive fonts by using file
names instead of font names in the font declaration.

Dear Markus and Denek

after increasing the memory the code compiles without error, the many
warnings in the log help me to find the faults with references and
crossreferences. I am well aware of lost braces, but if the error is
stochastic and dependent on the number of included chapters it was not
braces lacking what caused the error.

with respect to other faults in the code I can wait at the moment.

Dear Ulrike,

thanks for checking this.

On each fresh Ubuntu 22.04 system you could easily proof this. But c:\ does not seem to be such one.

Since Frank's Email we know that the "This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.14.0 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian)" has a problem at least with the installation of the EB Garamond Bold font.
So I tried, if the local installation of the font works fine, but there was no difference. The lualatex fontloader did not take the bold font from the home directory of the user, but by the hell exactly the one which came with the TeX Live installation. So this did not help.
I know that I could force the fontloader to take the EBGaramond12-Bold.otf by addressing this with the file name, but I never discovered how to tell the fontsystem, that there is a EBGaramond12-Bold.otf to be taken for the bigger fonts and a EBGaramond08-Bold.otf for the smaller ones :-( 


But I always learn a lot from the crowd -- Harald

This means you are not using the texlive fonts. On my texlive only
these fonts are used:

c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Bold.otf
c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Regular.otf
c:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/ebgaramond/EBGaramond-Italic.otf>

You could try to force the use of the texlive fonts by using file
names instead of font names in the font declaration.

You didn't get my point: Your log file shows that you are using
local fonts that you installed manually and not the one from texlive
and these fonts seem to be broken. The texlive list is the wrong
place to ask for this. Remove the local fonts and try without them.
Or try e.g. on overleaf where your local fonts can't interfere.

Well according to your log EBGaramond12-Bold.otf and
EBGaramond08-Bold.otf was used and that seems to be the problem.
Apart from this: the fontspec documentation describes how to select
optical sized fonts.

I'm afraid texdoc textcsc seems not to work properly. It should open
textcsc-documentation.pdf instead of textcsc.pdf. I'd be happy if you

Many thanks in advance.

Hi Juergen,

yeah, you are right. I noticed this and thinking how to fix it . We might want to fix this not only for the textcsc package, but prefer any PKG-documentation.EXT over just PKG.EXT. Anywy, we?ll address this .

Best,

Message-ID: <CAFVhNZMxD8_D0pY+-+Y4=yc8BfpAPk0JAXUK9bX5hfA-RZNu2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Adobe announced (very quietly) a few weeks ago that they will phase out
Type 1 fonts from all PDF tools, this January 2023, including Adobe Reader:


https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/kb/postscript-type-1-fonts-end-of-support.html

It is expected that files will be read, but no annotations of PDF pre-press
will work.

There are more than 7K Type1 files in TeXLive distributed over 33 packages.
The conversion with FontForge and other scripted tools is not very hard,
and the layout as an Unicode font simplifies file support a  lot ... and OT
itself opens the door to quite a bit of innovation.

Could these authors/maintainers get a prop-up from TL managers? It is quite
likely none of them have heard of this.

you know that about acrobat reader or you assume that?

The announcement says "no changes to Acrobat handling Type 1" which may 
or may not include Acrobat Reader but I would have expected that it does 
and Reader is *not* affected.

Sorry but where do you see that? Editing in Illustrator will no
work, but annotations made with adobe reader are quite unrelated to
fonts and nothing on the page suggests that this will break in the
near future.

Well we want to go away from type1 the main problem is not providing
open type fonts as alternative--we already have plenty in texlive.
The problem is that pdflatex can't use them as it can't subset them. 
E.g. 

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\pdfmapline{=cmr12 cm < lmroman12-regular.otf} 
\begin{document}
abc
\end{document}

will give a fatal error:

!pdfTeX error: pdflatex.exe (file lmroman12-regular.otf): OTF fonts
must be inc
luded entirely

Embedding the full font is not really an option both for size and
legal reasons.

Is that a pdflatex problem (/qua/ pdflatex) or a pdftex problem ?

Is there any chance to change this in the near future, so
that OTF fonts could be included partially, too?

Or are there difficult technicel reasons why that's not possible?

If it /could/ be done, but is a matter of available people who
have time to do it, I might be able to contribute as a
programmer, if that helps?

Cheers

Just wondering, might we be able to use an external tool
for subsetting OTF fonts before they are included by pdf[la]tex?

There is this tool, I have no diea how solid it is, never tried:

https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subset/index.html

| pyftsubset is an OpenType font subsetter and
| optimizer, based on fontTools. It accepts any TT- or
| CFF-flavored OpenType (.otf or .ttf) or WOFF (.woff) font file.
| The subsetted glyph set is based on the specified glyphs or
| characters, and specified OpenType layout features.

Might that be a way?

Actually it turned out there is NO urgent need for finding a solution. 
:)

Just found this advise, given in another reply in this thread:

That article shows there are no near or middle term problems
to be expected for Type 1 fonts that embedded(!) in the PFDs.

So there is no need to find a solution by the end of this year. :)

With this you can easily sort the text into pages and lines.
We can also identify that this is has a left/right page header.

Page header starts on y-pos 71, left edge is 108,
right edge is 575+232 = 792+15 = 807
The header has two parts:
. a constant text "TUGboat ..."
. a number

I call headers like this for a page invariant and you can detect
theese invariants due to their same position and content.

After the inveriants are detected, you can find the variant text
and possible find that in a latex source.

///

Example code:
 http://aspodata.se/git/openhw/pdftosym/pdfextr.pl

I have used that code to extract
. tables in ic datasheets to find pin name and labels
. extracting contents from pdf invoices

Unfortunately, since pdf's doesn't contain much semantic hints, you
have to add a subroutine for each specific group of cases.

///

There might be a better tool to extract things from pdf, but I forgot
its name. It could give me data on lines used in the pdf file, which
could make the prediction on table cells contents better. Also missing
from pdftohtml is text direction.

I am far less concerned about some commercial tool I don't plan to use
nor have used.

Maybe that is a good reason for many users to ditch these rubbish
products and move to better open source alternatives?

Hello, Mister Karl Berry. I have been obtaining software packages which
probably originated in some versions of Te? Live via the openSUSE or
OpenSUSE distribution of a Linux operating system since at least December
of the year 2013 when I began using Oracle VM (Virtual Machine) VirtualBox
in a Windows operating system on a then-new, 64-bit notebook computer and
having my openSUSE operating system as a VM in VirtualBox. And in recent
years I have been upgrading my openSUSE Leap distribution of a Linux
operating system about once a year with updates to texlive-? software
packages subsequently installed from openSUSE, Leap, online software
repositories. After upgrading Leap, version 15.3 to Leap, version 15.4 in
June of the year 2022 I found that I had the following list of texlive-?
software packages which were categorized as ?orphaned,? meaning that
software packages with the following names were no longer being supplied
through any openSUSE, Leap-15.4, online repository. Notice that the
?orphaned? texlive-? software packages below are labeled with probably the
year 2017. For example, texlive-mychemistry was installed in July of the
year 2021. So I probably obtained that version of texlive-chemistry, which
I supposed may have originated as a part of Te? Live 2017, via an openSUSE
online repository while I had Leap 15.3 installed in VirtualBox. Since on
September 9, 2022, for example, no newer version of texlive-mychemistry was
offered for installation from an openSUSE online repository for Leap 15.4,
I guess that the software package texlive-mychemistry might have been
discontinued beginning with some version of Te? Live during the interval of
years 2018-2021. In contrast in my present, Leap-15.4 installation most of
my installed texlive... software packages appear to have come from Te? Live
2021.


*Questions: *Despite the problems with the coronavirus in the world, were Te?
Live 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 all produced? If not, which versions of Te?
Live during the years 2018-2021 were not produced?


*A question:* If Te? Live 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 were all produced, can
you refer me to, for example, some so-called ?changelogs? for Te? Live
2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 which would list the Te? Live software packages
which would be discontinued from the previously issued version of Te? Live?


I have probably many texlive... software packages installed in my Leap-15.4
installation which I have not been using in Leap-15.4 or even in some
earlier versions of openSUSE. It is even conceivable that some Te? Live
2017 software packages obtained via some earlier version of openSUSE might
still work in my Leap-15.4 installation and therefore should not be removed
due to being non-functional. Of course I would prefer to avoid problems
caused by removing software packages; yet when such a removal would not
cause problems for the rest of my installed computer software, I would be
in favor of such a removal to avoid wasteful storage of computer software
and to eliminate software which might even be unusable in my Leap-15.4
installation. On September 13, 2022 below were my results for ?orphaned,?
just texlive-? software packages in my Leap 15.4 installation when I was
probably using the Linux kernel version 5.14.21-150400.24.18-default (I
removed all of the other ?orphaned? software packages from my Leap-15.4
installation.).

I would like to know whether any of above, ?orphaned,? texlive-? software
packages would be functional in my Leap-15.4 installation or not. Possibly
relating to this question, I found indications from
*https://www.educba.com/linux-distributions/
<https://www.educba.com/linux-distributions/>* and
*https://www.texdev.net/2011/10/29/tex-live-in-linux-distributions/
<https://www.texdev.net/2011/10/29/tex-live-in-linux-distributions/>* on
the Internet that a version of a texlive-? software package provided via a
distributor of a Linux operating system might possibly be kernel dependent.
Then in Yet another Software Tool (YaST) Software for the package named
?texlive? I saw that its version number included both ?2021? for probably
the year of Te? Live and ?150400?, which was part of my then-running Linux
kernel version of probably ?5.14.21-150400.24.18-default?! And that same
number of ?150400? appears in numerous other texlive-? software package
version numbers which also include the number ?2021? in them. So I suppose
that many texlive-? software packages in my Leap-15.4 installation with
both ?2021? and ?150400? in their version numbers may be dependent on at
least the current series of Linux kernels which include ?150400? in their
version numbers. Similarly among a large number of the ?orphaned,?
texlive-? software packages in my Leap-15.4 installation I found that their
version numbers include both ?2017? and ?5.18? in their version numbers.
And among them, for example texlive-knuth and texlive-tabulars-e, were
installed in my Leap-15.4 installation on July 13, 2021 when I was using
Leap 15.3. And in my former Leap-15.3 installation I was usually, if not
always using Linux kernels with ?5.3.18? in their version numbers. So I
suppose that all members of that set of ?orphaned,? texlive-? software
packages were kernel dependent. For the remaining 10, ?orphaned? texlive-?
sofware packages which all have ?2017? in their version numbers, but not
?5.18? in their version numbers, all ten of them were installed on July 13,
2021 in my then, Leap-15.3 installation.


So here is what I suppose or speculate that openSUSE developers might have
been doing concerning texlive-... software packages: a) obtaining them in
primitive forms, perhaps as source-code files from Te? Live from the Te?
Users Group (TUG) or perhaps the Comprehensive Te? Archive Network (CTAN),
b) perhaps modifying them in ways to make them usable in the latest version
of openSUSE with its Linux kernels, possibly backporting some
kernel-appropriate computer code; and c) providing such a modified software
package in an openSUSE, online repository. In anticipation of the types of
content to be used in Linux kernels in Leap 15.4 perhaps those so-produced,
texlive-? software packages did not need to be compiled at the time of
their installations, but instead might have been released from an online
openSUSE repository having already been compiled. In an openSUSE online
forum as of September 19 or 20, 2022 no one had confirmed or denied my
speculations in this paragraph. *Possibly help me here.*--You may correct
me if you know that any of my thinking in this paragraph and my previous
paragraph is incorrect.


Some relevance of part of my previous discussion to deciding whether or not
to remove ?orphaned,? texlive-? software packages is that it is conceivable
that such texlive-? packages produced for use in one set of Linux kernels
used in my Leap-15.3 installation might not work in the Linux kernels in
and to be used in my Leap-15.4 installation; and if those ?orphaned?
texlive-? software packages would turn out to not work in my Leap-15.4
installation, I should remove them from my Leap-15.4 installation.


There is a possibility that the function of an old texlive-? software
package from Te? Live 2017 could have been replaced by a texlive-? software
package with a different name in a year-2018, 2019, 2020, or 2021 version
of Te? Live; and if such a replacement of function was indeed made, the
old, ?orphaned,? texlive-? software package should be removed from my
Leap-15.4 installation; and in that case in order to continue to have the
function of the old texlive-? software package in its replacement texlive-?
software package, I should install that replacing texlive-? software
package in my Leap-15.4 installation, assuming that a Leap-15.4, online,
software repository would supply it. An imaginable way that such a
possibility might be checked might be to scan the so-called ?changelogs?
for the year-2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 versions of Te? Live, if they were
all thoroughly produced and can be found somewhere online.


*A question:* If so, can you refer me to any online, complete ?changelogs?
for Te? Live 2018, 2019, 2020, and/or 2021 which will enable me to
determine whether the function of my ?orphaned? texlive-? software packages
has been replaced by any texlive-? software packages with new or different
names than my installed, ?orphaned,? texlive-... software packages?


To somehow learn how to work with each of 35, relatively old,?orphaned,?
texlive-? software packages and afterward to test each of them, one at a
time, in a LaTe?, .tex file using one or both of the computer programs
pdflatex and/or bibtex might take a large amount of time!


*A question:* So instead is there a way I may determine en masse, or in a
group, whether each of the installed ?orphaned? texlive-... packages will
be functional or not in my Leap-15.4 installation, perhaps in a short .tex
file which would include a \usepackage{?} statement and between those
braces have all of the ?orphaned? texlive-... package names minus
?texlive-? in each case and separated by commas?

But isn?t the point that you may want to reach the maximum number of
readers? Many have Acrobat Reader and wouldn?t have a clue where to find an
open source alternative.

Sure, but for them the only part of the announcement linked at the start of
this thread that matters is:


> No changes are being made to Acrobat. Acrobat will continue handling PDFs
in the same manner it has been for more than 20 years:

PDFs with embedded fonts will display as intended.

Message-ID: <CALD=Yf_46TSvwzXePQ208spG5EwK=NXy861VYP4t0NGRrYpvcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "Using Git to subset TeX Live".

Date: Thursday 22 September, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Zoom and YouTube details are at https://texhour.github.io/about/

Famously, Don Knuth?s TeX produces identical outputs from identical inputs.
It is reproducible computing, across space time and platform. It provides
archival quality digital documents. This talk is about ensuring identical
inputs from TeX Live in a quick and economical way. For more see:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/22/git-subset-tex-live/

On Thu 29 Sep (6:30 to 8:30 BST) we have a special TWO HOUR long TeX Hour
focussed on Rethinking TeX in STEM, and with THREE special guests (with
workshops in the second hour).

    Peter Williams will speak about Tectonic
    Martin Ruckert will speak about HINT
    Dennis M?ller will speak about sTeX

https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/

wishing you happy TeXing

Some more food for thought.  What about scientific publishers who use TeX
and friends
for publishing, but often find themselves in the position of having to
clean up poorly made
graphics in Illustrator or Photoshop?  Will each of these programs continue
to use Type 1
fonts?  I don't think so.

Note well, what I am about to say is incendiary, but keep in mind I am
totally open source at
heart, I just recognize there are certain things where open source is not
viable.

I do not want to hear about open source offerings that do graphics with
Type 1 fonts, be it
bitmap or vector graphics - graphic artists generally are going to be more
adept at Adobe's
offerings than they are open source offerings as they tend to use macOS or
Windows.  Sure,
there are ports of GIMP to macOS and presumably Windows, but try getting
graphic artists
to switch over.  Have fun with that!

I am thinking about the people who invested a lot in proprietary fonts
in Type 1 format and Adobe line of tools.  A good font library may
cost many thousands of dollars - and there are no OTF substitutes for
some house fonts.  These investments became a pile of dry leaves.

Of course they may now invest into OTF fonts, but nobody guarantees
their fonts do not become obsolete in several years.  Actually the
opposite is as good as guaranteed.  They may want to keep old tools
and old version of operating system, and set up quarantined computer
networks to deal with security issues, but this becomes more and more
expensive with the time.

Proprietary tools seem to have many hidden costs.

Hi Lawrence - I'm afraid I cannot really parse all of your message, but
I'll try to answer what I can.

First, I know nothing about any version of suse, or any distro
repackaging of TeX Live. You'd need to contact distro maintainers about
distro issues.

Second, yes, the "original" TeX Live has had a release every year.
You can get old releases from https://tug.org/historic/ if you wish.
However, since I see nothing to be gained by installing the intervening
releases, I advise simply installing TL22:
  https://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html
This won't interfere with any existing TeX releases.

Third, it is highly unlikely that the Linux kernel version has any
relevance to TL binaries (certainly not to packages). The binaries in
our original release are intentionally compiled on old systems so as to
have the widest usage.

Fourth, there is no magic recipe for determining changes or
compatibility.  It is entirely up to each package maintainer about how
much ChangeLog-type information they provide. Usually, not much.

My own change notes for each TL release are (linked from) here:
  https://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html
but this is at a high level and concerning TL itself, not individual
packages.
  
Overleaf provides some package-level information for each release.
Here is their page for 2022:
  https://www.overleaf.com/blog/tex-live-2022-now-available
It is not feasible for anyone to provide a comprehensive list
of all changes, however.

In any case, your idea of making test documents, or running your
existing documents, would be the best way of determining the reality of
whether there are compatibility issues. If there are, you need to report
them to the package maintainers. TeX Live redistributes packages as they
arereleased to CTAN, and does not make additional changes.

Hope this helps,
Karl

    Is there any chance to change this in the near future, so
    that OTF fonts could be included partially, too?
    Or are there difficult technicel reasons why that's not possible?

It is difficult, yes.  Encodings are a major question.  I don't believe
Thanh or any other long-time pdftex developer has any time to work on it.

Thanh wrote an article about using TrueType with current pdftex some
time ago: https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94thanh.pdf
(Basically, choose an 8-bit encoding and run ttf2afm.) It will give the
flavor of the problems, at least.

Related: the VTeX developers implemented OpenType support in dvips.
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-2/tb119tolusis.pdf
Again, encodings are a principal issue.  Their method requires
dvilua(la)tex, as I understand it.

Happy hacking,
Karl

Fortunately updmap is set up to embed all Type 1 fonts by default for
about two decades.

But doesn't the PDF specification explicitly allow not to embed fonts?
Adobe provided at least the LW35 fonts along with their products in
the past and offered font packages for other languages (CJK for
example) to be downloaded free of charge. 

Though IMO a document which has not all resources embedded cannot be
called "portable", it seems that Adobe violates the PDF specification
here.  

There are many documents out there which have not all fonts embedded.
Most annoying are documents produced by Adobe itself which look ugly
on Linux because fonts are substituted by "similar" fonts with
obviously different metrics.

IMO it was a big mistake to allow not to embed all fonts but it's also
a mistake to deliberately break documents which were created according
to this unfortunate specification. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes. But it also notes explicitly

===========
The most predictable and dependable results are produced when all
font programs used to show text are embedded in the PDF file. See
9.9, "Embedded font programs" for the precise description of how to
do so. If a PDF file refers to font programs that are not embedded,
the results depend on the availability of fonts in the PDF
processor?s environment. See 9.8, "Font descriptors" for some
conventions for referring to external font programs. However, some
details of font naming, font substitution, and glyph selection are
implementation-dependent and can vary among different PDF processors
and operating system environments.
==========

pdf/A, the standard for "long term PDF", explicitly requires to
embed all fonts and all other resources.

You don't know yet if such documents will really break. Acrobat can
for the display do what it already does on linux: use a substitute.

As an example: hyperref declares as font for form text field
helvetica: /BaseFont/Helvetica. But Acrobat ignores that since quite
some time. If you look closely at the font in such a textfield you
can see that arial is used (on windows at least).

Frank, the text is extremely misleading. It literally says:


   *No changes are being made to Acrobat. Acrobat will continue handling PDFs*

*   in the same manner it has been for more than 20 years.*


and then goes on to describe how it will display PDFs. The problem is Acrobat

does a lot more than just DISPLAY. You can sign, annotate, collect, share ...


I am pretty sure the display will stay the same, after all PDF is now an ISO

standard, but it will be pretty nasty to loose all other operations. Open Source

does cover the display area, but it is pretty spotty on the other items.


We will suffer more on pre-press. None of the solutions posted here are able

to perform pre-press on a PDF file in any meaningful way. Pre-press is already

a problem for TeX production, it will become a larger one. To give you a simple

example -- there are NO open source tools that can determine the color space(s)

of a PDF file -- ImageMagick says it does and makes a mess out of it.

     For most production needs, it is easy to stay out of Type 1, for
some few, it will

not be easy. Incentivizing a change to Open Type will open more
possibilities, no

doubt.

Not to mention that some of these alternatives plain -- do not exist -- or

try sign or annotate a PDF file on Android or iOS.

And try to scan a series of pages to PDF and optimize it so that the
backround is no longer a bitmap but a rectangle containig many small
bitmaps, the compression is 20:1 with quality even ioncreased. I do
not know a better tool than Adob Acrobat Professional 9. That's why I
stil keep Windows XP in a VM.

I did read it Volker (not previously, only after you pointed it to me), but
the text only deals of issue of DISPLAY
which is not really much of a concern, other issues are.

Hi Lawrence,

IMHO this does not belong to tex-live at tug.org.  And yes there *are* changes
between TeXLive packages from 2017 from SLE-15/Leap15 trees and 2022 as
found on https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Publishing:/TeXLive/openSUSE_Leap_15.4/
for Leap 15.4. And herein packages had disapeared, renamed, splitted, or replaced.
For SLE-15.4 as well as Leap 15.4 I've taken TeXLive 2021 as this was the last
stable and well known, as well as known working without poppler as well as with
python3 and the version 2022 was fresh out and not tested well on opensuse platforms.
At least I had no feedback up to the time of doing the required update for
SLE-15.4 (and 15.4).

All those questions should belong to a mailing list here at opensuse.org

Sure it would be nasty. But again: nothing of this has to do with
the fonts of the pdf. So why do think that Acrobat would suddenly
refuse to add an annotation to the pdf if it contains a type1 font?

If you really think that this will no longer work in january, then
your only option is to switch to lualatex + unicode-math now. There
is no chance that pdftex will be able to handle open type fonts in
the near future.

Isn't it possible to do pre-press with PostScript ?

But Boris, a PDF file can have all Color Spaces present without

having a single image included.

Generally, PDF/X is required but anyway, do you know a tool which can
check the font size, font embedding, line width, color space,
resolution of bitmap images, black overprint and optionally convert
the color spaces using ICC profiles in postscript?

It?s a long time since I?ve had to manage printing and the technologies have shifted dramatically in those 20+ years, but prepress these days is pretty much exclusively based on a PDF workflow. In the olden days, I would provide monochrome PDFs to a service bureau to get film which I?d ship to the printer and I was responsible for all color separation/management. There were a lot of potential traps in those old workflows?it was not uncommon for a tyro designer to inadvertently spec a file with some large number of spot colors that would color separate out into, say 15 press runs for each color instead of being correctly indicated as CMYK mixes. These days, a lot of short press runs (<1000 copies) will be done with direct digital imaging onto the press right out of a provided PDF file.

That said, TeX?s idiosyncratic font management has been a growing time bomb since (at least) the 90s. pdf(La)TeX wanting to pull in type 1 (and bitmaps) out of its own installation rather than using fonts installed via standard system mechanisms make it an outlier in many ways, not least of which is the fact that you end up with mutually exclusive islands of TeX fonts and everything else fonts. At least the XeTeX and LuaTeX engines can use system-installed fonts, which really should be the standard for any application in 2022.

Hear hear.? I do not remember the last time that I used anything other 
than a system-installed font, and I even install (for example) the TeX 
Gyre fonts as system fonts so that I can access all fonts using a 
consistent syntax and a consistent access mechanism.

Have you used Adobe Acrobat in conjunction with PDF, Karl, and which utility{|ies}/program{s} do you use in conjunction with Postscript for pre-press checks and conversions ?

Hi Uri

> First try practically always fails like above. Retries consistently work (so far ;).

Do you do your "first try" always around the same time?
Mirrors are synced during a specific time once a day. If you hit that
during sync, you will get errors.

At least that is what your statement that retries consistently work is
pointing at.

Another explanation would be proxies that need to be opened first ..

Not on my own systems.

I borrowed a computer once to printout a pdf via acrobat and I
couln't make it print without it automatically scaling down,
where the corresponding ps just came out right.

I don't know much about pre-press (that is why I asked) and I
cannot judge colour aspects, I have to ask someone else for that.

I print out things like http://aspodata.se/choir/osthammar/mozart/
and I care about high contrast between black and white, I'd prefer
matte blacks (because in music performances the light is dim with
spotlights which give reflections in the blacks if they are glossy)
if I can get it, which is not available on modern lasers, high end
inkjets are close, but thoose I have looked at have blacks where
there is small white dots (in a grid) in the black, their blacks
doesn't cover the area.

Looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepress, I don't do
point 7, 9-11.

I cannot judge colour aspects, the other things I do by visually
inpecting a test print.

In Adobe Acrobat DC, use File / Print / Actual size / Print.

It is the same since Acrobat v3, just the dialogue looks a bit
different but the functionality is the same. It has too many options
with sizes, you just have to choose what you want.

Ok, regarding line width I can go the route as outlined below which
is clearly batch oriented.

I sure I can do the same for font size and probably the other
things also if and when I can understand the terminology you use.

Since postscript is a programming language, I can add another
level of indirection, e.g.:

$ cat debug.ps
/str 20 string def

/numprint {
    count 0 gt { str cvs print } if
} bind def

/xyprint {

Subject: Failed update: texlive-scripts
Message-ID: <CAEgp3Vv2NGxTiDOCN2xBCPdtx959hC-gTSUDbCsnr4KZOBi2bA@mail.gmail.com>

I was updating TeX Live (on Windows 11 Home) but an error popped up
(sorry, I don't remember the exact text but it ended with "last
command `tlmgr update all`").
In the log there is:

[Sat Sep 24 08:11:37 2022] failed update: texlive-scripts (64457 -> 64460)

I tried again and these errors appeared:

no appropriate script or program found

The compilations of .tex file work, but the list of the repositories
doesn't appear in TLShell TeX Live Manager.

Logs attached.

Thank you!
Carla

Hi Carla,

> no appropriate script or program found

> Logs attached.

I think that this message means that the Windows wrapper program cannot
find either fmtutil or updmap. A few things that you can maybe check:

1. Do the following files exist on your system?

      C:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/fmtutil.pl
      C:/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/updmap.pl
      
   If they don't exist, then you can try redownloading them from:
   
      https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/
      
2. Does running:

      kpsewhich --format=texmfscripts fmtutil.pl
      kpsewhich --format=texmfscripts updmap.pl
      
   give the paths of the files above? If not, you can try running:
   
      mktexlsr
      
3. Is your Perl installation perhaps broken? I'm not really sure how to check
   this, but it would certainly cause problems.
   
I'm not too sure what else to check. Hopefully one of these ideas is of
some help.

After running mktexlsr, the paths are given.
Nonetheless, TLShell TeX Live Manager does not show me the possibility
to change repository.

Were those two files missing before you downloaded them? If they were
missing, then that probably means that a whole bunch of other files are
missing too, causing the problem with the TLShell. If that's the case,
then probably the easiest way to proceed would unfortunately be a full
reinstallation.

If that's not the case, then hopefully someone else comes by with
another solution.

Hi Karl,

your file does not solve the problem at all because it does not take
CTM into account and does not examine the the angle of the segments.
The important point is that if you set 0 setlinewidth, the display
postscript guarantees that the line segment will be displayed with the
thinest possible width and 30 years old PS office printers from HP do
the same (my PS printer died 10 years ago and spare parts are no
longer available). The phototypesetters and digital printing machines
do not guarantee that lines with a linewidth below a certain limit
will be printed, they may disappear. Now imagine that you include a
graphics while using 0.1 0.03 scale. It can thus happen that
horizontal lines will be printed but the vertical lines disappear. If
the graphics contains a sine curve, some segments will be missing. It
is the same with fonts. In addition, the findfont operator does not
inform you whether an embedded font is used or whether a system font
is used. It is again a problem of included graphics generated by
another tool where fonts need not be always embedded. It may look fine
in display postscript on your computer but a CTP will replace the font
with Courier which you certainly do not want to happen. If you do not
use \backgroundcolor, because you just want to have it while, and put
an object with the alpha channel, the tgransparent area will be white
on display postscript but black on CTP. It is therefore necessary to
detect all transparent objects (both vectors and bitmaps) and upon
request remove the alpha channel. LCMS for colorspace conversion can
in theory be implemented in postscript but it is not an easy task. It
would be easier to implement all these features in poppler and/or qpdf
but it is not available now.

Yes, I know that I didn't care about the current tranformation matrix
in this simple example.

Ok, I don't have experience of thoose kind of machines.
Anyhow, since the results of rendering such "zero-width" lines
are device dependent, their use is not recommended. Both PLRM2 and 3
says the same. So a user doing that is doing it on their own risk.

And, when working with things on the border of what it can accomplish
you always have to check the result.

No, it does not, I have to find that out in some other way.

Well, if the font isn't on the printer and you don't sent it to the
printer in some way, isn't that the same as cutting the branch you
are sitting on ?

I think it is possible to detect missing fonts and warn the user, if
it is that problem you are reffering to.

I havn't worked with this and I cannot find \backgroundcolor in PLRM,
but PLRM3 says (section 4.10.6 Masked Images):

In the graphic arts industry and page layout applications, however, it is common
to crop or ???mask out??? the background of an image and then place the masked im-
age on a different background, allowing the existing background to show through
the masked areas. A number of PostScript features are available for achieving
such masking effects:

Perhaps one could find a solution for this.

...

I havn't worked much with colour nor at the code level in poppler,
so I cannot comment much on this.

But all of the above is moot if people don't want to work with
postscript files.

 the TeX Hour

Hi

I write to warmly invite you to a one hour online meeting on TeX in STEM,
followed by an optional one-hour workshop. It will take place on Thursday
29 September at 6:30pm BST (UK time). Please forward this invitation to
others if you wish. Here are the most important links:

Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.

We are fortunate to have as main speakers Peter Williams, Dennis M?ller and
Martin Ruckert. All three have projects (Tectonic, sTeX and HINT) based on
rethinking TeX for our changed times. All three have spoken on this at the
annual TeX Conference organised by the TeX Users Group. For more
information see:

https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/

The world has moved on since the 1990s (and the invention of the
world-wide-web). Print and PDF no longer dominate as they did, even in the
world of STEM publishing. Here's an example, which surprised me, of just
how good HTML can be for heavily mathematical STEM content. Quality
technical typography is no longer confined to print media (and its digital
representation PDF):

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)
Lattices in Tate modules
Bjorn Poonena and Sergey Rybakov
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2113201118  # HTML
https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2113201118 # PDF

In late November or early December there will be another special TeX Hour,
this time focussed on LaTeX and Accessibility. We're pleased that Jonathan
Godfrey, a blind senior lecturer in Statistics and stalwart of the Blind
Math list, will be one of our special guests. For more details see:
https://texhour.github.io/access/

with kind regards

Jonathan

Do you have any suggestions for a substitute?

Open Source evangelist that believe there is only one god should show the
way.

There are many quarters of the software space where there is no OS
equivalent -- try pre-press, for example. There are no open source software
that can determine the color spaces of a PDF file.

Paulo, I thank you for your question.  Remember that since 2013, Gnu runs the computing needs of
the International Space Station.  When one is in unfamiliar territory, you can only progress
consciously by seeking the assistance of a local guide.  For one thing, calling us "Open Source 
Evangelists" show that you have no idea about the people you are talking about.  Saying that we 
are Open Source Evangelists is like saying that "Cows Have Wings" or "If my mother had wheels she 
would be a motorcycle".  Completely wrong.

You know what happened to Columbus when he went by himself?  He wanted to go to India and 
ended up in America.  Do you know how many thousands of sailors did not even manage to land
anywhere?  If you go somewhere without any guidance, this is what will happen.  I am not saying
you cannot do it by yourself, but we do not know how many lifetimes it will take by yourself.
Not that it is impossible, but 99% of the people will just get lost and washed away. 

There are Jitsi, BigBlueButton and Jami.

Jami is a peer-to-peer serverless system, which I like.  But if you are at a terrible
venue, they might have a firewall blocking non-web ports, you have a problem.  Jami is
able to punch through NATs if you stress it.

Jitsi also works well.  The Jitsi server is a heavyweight.

BigBlueBotton also works, but one needs an account somewhere. And again, BigBlueBotton is
also resource intensive.

Christopher

i have been a pretty heavy user of Jitsi <https://meet.jit.si/> since 
8x8 was free to use and i adore it. Sometimes, somebody cannot share 
their screen or sometimes my voice sounds robotic however most of the 
time, it just works fine.

I have used every tool available and there is one thing to say about Zoom:
It just doesn't work most of the time, it works all the time, while e.g.
Jitsi constantly had issues when you were just too many users in the call
or too many user had their video disabled.

I sometimes work with technically not-so-advanced people, here the "just
click, it will work" way of Zoom is a necessity.

Message-ID: <YzKRCplxb3NZ+Sv3@KCR9J032WQ>

Hi all,

can someone explain me why the following file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\begin{document}
Hello $\bigtriangleup$ World
\end{document}

compiled once on MacOS and once on Linux, both with uptodate TL2022,
I get a correct version on Linux, and on MacOS the
	\bigtriangleup
appears as
	4
in the pdf.

I have checked the embedded fonts and the agree.

I attach the pdf files.

Thanks for any enlighting comment!

Norbert

I cannot see it on macOS Monterey and up-to-date TL2022

bash-3.2$ luafindfont latinmodern

shows that all LM fonts are saved under TL

Adding missing information:

Compiler was xelatex (as can be seen from the pdfinfo), but same happens with
lualatex.

The Mac I use is a M1 (arm64, apple silicon).

Thanks

Hmmm, so a arm64 problem, one of the many ... how I hate Apple Silicon.

Subject to the laws of libel, you are, of course, free to express your 
opinions on any subject under the sun.? However, "technically capable 
people", as you refer to them, will be very familiar with the concept of 
references.? May I therefore respectfully suggest that if you wish your 
views to be taken seriously, rather than just more? misguided 
"proprietary software is evil" propaganda, you back up each of your 
assertions with a reference to a reliable and reputable source, the 
authority of which is beyond all reasonable doubt?

Can you show both log-files from the compilation with lualatex? And
also the pdf's?

Hmmm, strange, now I get on both systems the 4 instead of triangleup
which is also painful

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\let\bd\bigtriangleup
\begin{document}
Hello $\bd$ World
\end{document}


??

Attached the log files and pdf files for lualatex.

Seems to be a unicode-math problem, the moment I comment it out it
shows correct traingleup.

But I wanted to use lucida-otf and Lucida Math...

I will do more tests ... but not sitting next to my linux makes it
difficult.

Best

Norbert

\let\bd\bigtriangleup before \begin{document} is not a good idea.
unicode-math setups the math only a begin document. If you move the
the \let behind \begin{document} it will work again.

Hi Norbert,

I've tested the file on an M1 Mac Mini and compiled correctly on both 
xelatex and lualatex.

Using the following as a test file

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\begin{document}
Hello $\bigtriangleup$ World
\end{document}

Attached logs in case these might be helpful.

Hope this helps.

Haaa .. indeed!!! And now I understand why I couldn't reproduce it anymore
because I wanted a minimal test file and unravelled the let before sending.

Sorry for the noise.

And thanks!!

Yes, moving \let after \begin{document}, or changing it to \newcommand,
both work.

Again, sorry for the noise

I showed that you can without much problem extraxt information about
PostScript files by adding some code to it. I guess there is a long
way to make it solve the voiced pre-press problems, but:

. is there any interest in this ?
. should I just drop it ?
. if there is interest, should I move the discussion to texhax ?

Misusing the horror of the extermination camps to make a petty
argument against a software is inacceptable and disrespectful to the
victims of these camps.

This is where me disagree.  It is a valid contrarian view for the absolute requirement
of documented proof by what some decide to call authority.  Naturally, I am not here
to dictate how people run the event.  For one thing, this shows how computer science and
computer engineering departments today are not providing much innovation to their
community.  What people can do is to encourage their computer science and computer
engineering departments about the value of working on honest development of technology
that serves the best interests of those who use the software rather than some other entity.

I provided an explanation on valid reasons to thumb down the use of Zoom.  But some got really
offended.  I am used to the approach of individuals whose modus-operandi involve insults,
shame, guilt and the need to be right.  People whose education has educated them out of it.

I did not have more to say than the initial comments.  Yet I see quite a few starting freaking
out about it.  It is the latter part that has been unnecessary.  Who have I disrespected exactly.
The mathematical community has a reputation in the world that it can take criticism.  But perhaps
Grigori Perelman was right to reject the community's accolades.  So I shall continue to be his
friend and agree with him.

Christopher, this is not the forum to be talking about extermination 
camps in any circumstances. It is way off topic from the initial 
discussion on Zoom and free software alternatives. I do understand the 
point you are making in regards to the use of alternatives but not when 
it comes to the atrocities that happened at these camps.

I would ask that you apologise for your comments on this list and 
refrain from using these in the future

Yes, it will be helpful. I do not mind using close source commercial
SW but there is a lack of SW for Linux. Up to now pdffonts (from
poppler) can show whether the fonts in a PDF file are embedded.
ps2pdf13 from ghostscript solves the problem with transparencies and
embeds fonts using replacement. I need not be always what you wish but
it is not worse than commercial SW. Ghostscript can read not only PS
but also PDF hencd ps2pdf13 can downgrade PDF to 1.3 which is needed
by PDF/X. Nowadays you almost always need PDF/X thus I still think
that it is easier to solved in poppler, qpdf or similar library. There
are less features to patch because PDF is not a programming language.
It is possible to link these libraries with lcms hence the colorspace
problems can be solved more easily than by reimplementatin of lcms in
PS. The easiest thing to imlpement is the display of TrimBox and
BleedBox in the PDF viewers. Adobe Acrobat has such an option in its
config, the user selects whether these boxes should be marked
visually. A bit more difficult is the display of the separate CMYK
planes. In Adobe Acrobat a user can choose which planes should be
visible. It is useful when checking the proper setting of black
overprint.

I am sorry being off topic but I do not understand it well. The zoom
server which hosts my meetings is physically located in the Czech
Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, and is operated by the
best experts at network security. Can you explain me how exactly the
server is censored from China and how the personal data are leaked? I
will then forward it to the experts and they will certainly find a
solution and make it available to other hosts. Anyway, in both the
open source and closed source SW it is normal that people do not just
speak about vulnerabilities but they either fix them and publish the
patches or report them immediately to expert. Why you have not done
that? These vulnerabilities could have been fixed a long time ago if
you acted as you should.

In the open source world meritocracy is applied. Those who contribute
most have higher right to decide. Those who do not contribute can file
a feature request but they have no right to decide. I have good
experience with zoom, terrible experience with MS Teams and Jitsi is
difficult, it happened several times that other users were not able to
connect.

Anyway, if you develop an alternative to zoom which will be equally
stable and available at reasonable price, I will probably switch to
it.

Howdy,

I'm not seeing that with an M1 iMac, macOS 12.6 and a fully updated TeX Live 2022.

Does the Linux pdf display properly on the Mac and visa-versa?

Good Luck,

Remember that two years ago, work with New York State Attorney General 
Letitia James led to the launch of an inquiry into Zoom's privacy and
security practices, with Zoom continuing with its policy of not admitting
to any wrongdoing whatsoever.

I understand your point.  There would be benefits that would bring those
who currently refuse Zoom for them to speak or for them to listen to your 
meetings.  Still, many do contribute even though they do not get involved
in any such meetings.

The only people who would benefit from what I said in your community itself,
I do not gain much from it.  As you said, I have no rights or authority to
decide anything.  I leave the community to take the direction it wants.
You do it on your own and at your risk, and I will not be involved in it.  
In my community, you are welcome, but we do not use Zoom, that's all.

Thank you so very much
Kristof

Let me agree to disagree! i have used /Jitsi/ with my pupils and in 
Estonia the groups are large - 24 pupils. Sometimes people using /Mac/ 
have had issues but i /Mac/ really isn't a way to go as it's for people 
who have options to pay a lot.

As about /Zoom/, sometimes other parties don't hear me and i have to 
write in chat. i have even given up to use its desktop version as it 
seems to constantly have sound issues, so i always use /Zoom/ using a 
web browser. That way, it's probably also possible to record meetings on 
the client side on proprietary /Android/. /Zoom/ has limits: free usage 
for up to what was it - 45 minutes? /Jitsi/ has not time limit and is 
always free. /Jitsi/ also makes it possible to have rooms constantly 
open. Everyone can enter them anytime and leave anytime. One does not 
have to schedule meetings. Only sharing screen on /Android/ crashes the 
application which is a shame.

Does such a source or authority exist? May I therefore respectfully 
suggest that if you wish your views to be taken seriously, rather than 
just more? misguided "authorities always tell us the truth" propaganda, 
you back up each of your assertions with a reference to a reliable and 
reputable source, the authority of which is beyond all reasonable doubt?

i had my moments with /Google/ and started to avoid using /Google/'s 
software after these. i removed my account from so-to-speak countless 
number of groups in Facebook once it appeared that i cannot set my name 
on my account as i want to have it. my five cents on proprietary thingy 
is that our world has great inequalities in covering people's needs 
because of artificially limiting resources to some and not sharing if 
it's possible and necessary. tex-live is a good example of sharing. 
/Google/ is a contra-example with /Zoom/. If people would not be so 
eager to buy proprietary /Android/ we had high-quality fully functional 
phones working with FOSS-/Android /with no restrictions on call-recording/./

Using proprietary things can lead to further extermination camps as 
using proprietary things the user supports their owners who are there to 
gain profit and maximizing profit maximizes inequality as there are 
people who work non-profit. Furthermore, owners of proprietary things 
have resources to govern others. If the owner is just then also others 
can benefit from the owner's profit. If the owner is not just then the 
owner can suppress others up to extermination. Is /Zoom/'s owner just or 
not? On the contrary, if we use FOSS then we do not support someone's 
profit but people who create value for us. That brings to another 
question: Are we just or not?

i read from the conversation below that referencing was asked for 
reasoning the connection between using /Zoom/ and suppressing people in 
China. A rhetoric question was asked in reply whether referencing would 
also be asked for suppressing Jews. Of course, Adolf Hitler did not use 
/Zoom/ and we cannot find any reference for something that did not exist 
that time. Some people even doubt that /Holocaust/ ever took place 
regardless of many references from authorities. This brings to the 
further thought that an authority for someone is not an authority for 
someone else. Winners tend to write history. Now, a war is going on 
between proprietary and open-source software. If the former would win 
then we would need to dance according to the music of the owners of 
proprietary software and eventually get suppressed and exterminated if 
not needed anymore. If the latter would win we would dance according to 
the music chosen of our own and have access to resources we need 
regardless of the business plan of the owner. There is still a catch. 
Without electricity, none of it works. And electricity costs three times 
what it costed a year ago. This is because producing electricity is a 
proprietary thing. Would we live in a sharing society already if 
producing electricity would be open-source?

There is one more thing that just came to my mind regarding /Zoom/ 
versus /Jitsi/. The former does not allow everyone to share their screen 
at the same time. The latter allows it which makes it so much more 
useful than /Zoom/: nobody has to stop sharing so that anyone else can 
share their screen. Yes, it lags sometimes. Why do we not rather support 
developing /Jitsi/ instead of giving energy to /Zoom/?

Dear Community

This is about our online meetings. Since 2020 the online TeX Conference,
kindly organised by the TeX Users Group, has been widely recognized as a
good thing. I've certainly welcomed the opportunity to present and listen
to talks, and to watch and link to the video recordings afterwards. I thank
TUG and its volunteers for making this possible.

I have organised an online video meeting that brings together 3 past
speakers to the TeX Conference, on the theme of rethinking the role of TeX
in STEM subjects. I've made this a 2-hour meeting with presentations first
followed by small group workshop discussions. I think it is important that
we meet in small groups during the year, between the large TeX conferences
organised by TUG.

On Monday I sent an announcement of the TeX in STEM meeting to this list.
The response surprised and disappointed me.

Someone, I will mention no names, criticized the meeting in very strong
terms for using Zoom rather than an open source alternative. This is a
legitimate point of view. I contacted that person off-list inviting them to
discuss with me moving future such events to an open source platform. By
the way TUG has for 3 years used Zoom for its annual TeX Conference.

There then followed a mostly heated and often bad-tempered discussion of
video conferencing software and off-topic social and political issues.
There was no discussion at all of rethinking the role of TeX in STEM, in a
time when HTML rivals PDF even for technical material. [Not all of the
messages were sent to this list - see the PS.]

I kept out of that discussion. No-one seemed to notice that a thread
started for one purpose had been completely taken over by another purpose,
at best only peripherally related to TeX. This was detrimental to
discussion of topics presented by 3 speakers at TeX Conferences, including
this year's opening keynote Peter Williams.

It saddens me that this has happened. The health of your community requires
us as a group to discuss and understand present and future challenges, as
well as celebrate past successes. Details of the TeX in STEM meeting, which
happens tomorrow (Thursday), are at:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/

I do look forward to improved sharing of mathematical content in video
meetings. Surely we can do better than sending a video bitmap image of a
Beamer presentation.

wishing you happy TeXing

Jonathan

Did you read the following sentence: "Share computer audio is still 
available, but a participant must be viewing that shared screen to hear 
the computer audio."? Nice try but not enough! In /Jitsi/, i would not 
be limited to only hear the audio of the screen-sharer but of every 
participant.

In addition: can /Zoom/ beat /Jitsi/ by allowing participation with no 
account creation requirement? Can it even get close to it? Can it offer 
a public room without any credentials for anytime? i guess no because 
they might be interested of controlling what is going on. i would like 
you to prove me wrong. i am not a protector of /Jitsi/. you can offer a 
better alternative as long as any proprietary software is excluded and 
your offered software is FOSS.

Do you drive a car created by amateurs, Kalmer ?? Watch a television 
created by amateurs ?? Wear clothes created by amateurs ?? In fact, is 
there any aspect of your life other than software in which you prefer 
the efforts of amateurs to those of professionals ?? I think it's time 
that you woke up to the realities of life.

Philip, your comments constitute the typical response of critics and detractors that are mostly
ignorant of life around them.  Albert Einstein did not come up with his Theory of Relativity 
by being part of some professional entity.  Neither did Andrew Wiles or Grigori Perelman.
Charles Darwin did not care about the approval of his peers when he published his Theory of 
Evolution.  It was the professional community which was ignorant, and not the other way round. 

The problem with many who call themselves professionals is this.  They are simple humans who 
are incapable of saying "I do not know".  They are incapable of evolving to better being, but
have decided to take the path that returns them back to being monkeys.  Their existence is 
simply based upon imitation.

I am neither a critic nor a detractor, Kristof ? as I wrote in my 
signature, I use whatever works best for the task in hand, no matter 
whether created by individuals or by corporations.? Look at the list 
that I quoted ? 7 of the 9 names were those of individuals, only two 
were of corporations.? But what those corporations produce is /good/, as 
is that of the individuals named, and many many more besides, and it is 
only those who elect not to see the merits of the work of those 
corporations who seek to pretend otherwise.

People can make their own choices about what they want.  But certainly there exists a 
large cohort who are not at ease about how things are managed.  And thusly, will not
allow their genius to benefit the TUG Community.  Only the TUG Community is loosing.
As people get consciously aware about the technology they use, the situation will
only get worse.  I would not refuse using Zoom if certain conditions were met, but 
the company has decided to continue with its devious ways.

It is not about professionalism. It is about the system. As stated 
before, i really would prefer using FOSS-/Android/ instead of the 
proprietary version. Meritocracy that is used for creating FOSS means 
that functionalities would be implemented that are necessary to solve a 
problem or sometimes to have fun instead of getting likes from a 
majority and forcing them to use it for creating profit. Of course, i 
prefer if something has been done by a professional. Do i get you right 
that you call developers of /tex-live/ amateurs? On the other hand, how 
many discoveries have been made by amateurs if they are not limited by 
the rules of their employer? Usually, there are style, security, 
usability and other guidelines if FOSS is large. FOSS-development is a 
great example of a sharing society where i want to live. Therefore, i 
wish the same way to be implemented in every branch: also in producing 
cars and clothes. There have been made efforts for open-source hardware 
design. i do not accept the current reality which is FOS without the 
other /S/ or financial slavery system. It only works because so many 
people accept it. Once people stop accepting it the system can be 
replaced. Therefore, all the people who accept proprietary system are 
enemies of sharing society. i also think that people thriving for 
sharing society cannot change that as people are built so. Is the 
technical construct called human designed by an amateur or a professional?

Are you sure about it? i have read all of them since my email address 
has been a member of this list and not found any off-topic argument. 
Sometimes, in order to understand a problem we need to dig deeper and 
build a huge context around the spot for being able to see the spot from 
many different points of view. Sometimes, in order to make a point clear 
to others, one needs to present the point more thoroughly using extreme 
metaphors and examples if necessary. Feedback can sometimes help to 
understand other views. Every new piece of information can have an 
impact to a resolution. This is the way how to reach a consensus which 
is the base of happiness of every participant involved in the particular 
issue.

* Professional Work simply means Work for Money.  Has nothing to do about whether the work is 
valuable or not.  Many attorneys do Pro-Bono Publico Work.  Is their work of lesser value?  On
the contrary, it is usually the best and most respected work of their entire public life.  
It is the same with doctors, engineers and geologists.  What about the work of mathematicians?
Most times our work is inconsequential and of no value to our communities. 

* My best work has always been done when I get fully involved in it.  My worst work has been 
professional because its quality depends on a cost-benefit calculation.  If the monetary 
benefit is not at par with the effort, it just does not get done.

* Anybody worth his salt knows that Pro-Bono Publico Work is certainly not amateurish.  But work
that is done from the heart to the best of one's ability.  What we do for an employer is debatable,
what we do through our joyfulness is what makes each of us Super.

Try BigBlueButton.
https://bigbluebutton.org/

Free if you install it on your server (but you need a larger bandwidth 
than the usual one).

OpenSource project, I used it for my lessons during the lockdowns (this 
means somehow 16 months). And I teach in secondary school, so I do need 
a good working interface that can be used by young pupils.

Works better than Jitsi, because it is designed for large groups 
(protocol used by Jitsi divides the bandwiths amoung users, so the more 
users, the more problems). The only trouble is with safari, that doesn't 
implement well the protocol.

Just my two pennies, sorry if I missed something already said on this 
quite long thread.

Is it possible to use /BigBlueButton/ without having an account? Is it 
possible to keep rooms always open?

Is it possible that all the users in a room share their screens at the 
same time?

How does /BigBlueButton/ share bandwidth? It costs a lot to have at 
least 250 Mb / s bandwidth for the server machine. i only have 50 Mb / s 
which might not be sufficient for serving /BigBlueButton/.//

For /Jitsi/, one does not have to install anything although it is 
possible. we can just go to meet.jit.si/<room name>.

* Someone does need an account for BigBlueButton.  But others can join without accounts.
Yes, one can keep rooms open, and have them inform you where they are present by simply speaking.
