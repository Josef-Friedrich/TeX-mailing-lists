Subject: texdoc shows me German docs for some reason
Message-ID: <9341c5190a0d246d5830d04c5708ae48@forallx.net>

In TL2022, `texdoc` shows me the German version of documentation if it 
exists on the machine.  This is true even when the English version 
(which is what I want) is also on the machine.  E.g., `texdoc geometry` 
shows me 'geometry-de.pdf' even though 'geometry.pdf' is also sitting 
right there.

This strikes me as a bug, since:

* texdoc has never behaved this way up through and including TL2020.  
Testing reveals that this bug is present in TL2021 too.

* $LANG is en_US.UTF-8, which the texdoc manpage says should "influence" 
search results.

* I have zero `collection-lang*` packages installed (so 
`collection-langgerman` can't be interfering).

* My texdoc.cnf has nothing involving languages, but consists solely of 
`fuzzy_level = 0` and `viewer_pdf = open %s`.

* tlmgr and friends all talk to me in English, so it's not as though I 
accidentally tripped some global TL language switch.

However, I don't know whether the bug is in `texdoc` or in some other 
internal piece of TL.

Anybody got an idea?  Just to forestall any complaints about having a 
weird installation that's missing collection-lang*, I also tested after 
a `tlmgr install scheme-tetex` and the bug is still present.

Hi Jack,

LANG indeed influences the locale setting of Texdoc, but other settings such as LC_ALL also influence it. Unfortunately, it seems the locale setting for Texdoc in your machine is not set to English correctly. For a workaround, you can explicitly set the locale by adding the following to your texdoc.cnf:

	lang = en

Then you will get the English version of the package first.

Another solution is the --list (-l) option to list the found documents for a query.

Best,
Takuto

Indeed, I can confirm that
[~] texdoc -l geometry

That is indeed strange.

Hi Norbert, hi George,

thanks for providing the entire locale settings and the search results. We have some reported issues with the locale judgment feature:

- https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/issues/77
- https://github.com/TeX-Live/texdoc/issues/78

I hope fixing these issues will also solve the strange behaviors; we will use the provided cases for debugging.

I don't know if it's related but I've found that after upgrading Fedora 
I'm now getting ? and ? instead of ? and ? when using AltGr+V and 
AltGr+B so something may have gone wrong with the localisation settings 
that's affecting texdoc.

Changing the newcommand to

it builds. The last time I have built the full document was on may 31, 2022 (about two months ago).

Your use of \romannumeral is not properly terminated: this confuses the 
new case-changing code. Add a space to terminate:

     \newcommand{\RomanNumeralCaps}[1]{\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral #1 }}

I have the following ConTeXts installed:

1. TeX Live 2021 on Windows 10 x64
2. TeX Live 2022 on Windows 10 x64
3. TeX Live 2022 on Linux x64 (Fedora 36)
4. ConTeXt LMTX Standalone on Windows 10 x64
5. ConTeXt LMTX Standalone on Linux x64 (Fedora 36)

All of these are installed using the official installation scripts, and
all of these work just fine for me.

   https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/653913

this appears to be a packaging issue with Gentoo. 

However, I do agree with you that ConTeXt can be quite picky with
anything texmfcnf-related. See point 4 in my reply to you on the ConTeXt
list:

   https://mailman.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-context/2022/106453.html
   
The ConTeXt developers are best reached on the ntg-context mailing list,
so that would likely be the best place to discuss the texmfcnf issue
since a similar thread on this list:

was never really resolved.

From context I would guess more

   V.matching = true;

as otherwise the while loop will never execute ... or the while loop has
to be change into do { } while (V.matching) ...

TexLive ConTeXt works fine if it was installed by TexLive installer.

However, linux distributions bypass TexLive installer.

How can linux distributions override certain variables in texmfcnf.lua provided by TexLive?

Thanks Werner.  The source code will eventually get corrected but as the
utility function is not actually used by the m-tx app, it's not urgent.

Is there any documentation on the variables used in texmfcnf.lua?

I really don't know what the hell the variables in texmfcnf.lua mean.

Can there be any separate system-wide override file that can override certain variables in /usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmfcnf.lua?

They are very similar to the kpathsea texmf.cnf variables, so
the texinfo documentation of kpathsea should help.

> Can there be any separate system-wide override file that can override certain variables in /usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmfcnf.lua?

Unfortunately not as far as I can remember. For Debian I always patched
the values we need to have set into texmfcnf.lua. Other distributions
might have forgotten that, though.

It is a pity that texmfcnf.lua does not support layered configuration,
similar to updmap, fmtutil, and even texmf.cnf ...

After reading /usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf, I concluded that texmfcnf.lua should set TEXMFSYSVAR="selfautoparent:/var/lib/texmf", TEXMFSYSCONFIG="selfautoparent:/etc/texmf", TEXMFDIST="selfautodir:share/texmf-dist".

If people who use TexLive installer has no problem with texmf.cnf using the above values for TEXMFSYSVAR, TEXMFSYSCONFIG, and TEXMFDIST, then they wouldn't have a problem with texmfcnf.lua having those same values, either.

Arch Linux texlive-core's texmfcnf.lua sets TEXMFOS="selfautodir:share", but I don't know whether TEXMFOS="selfautodir:share" is necessary.

There are typos.

I tried to write TEXMFSYSCONFIG="selfautoparent:etc/texmf" and TEXMFSYSVAR="selfautoparent:var/lib/texmf"

For Arch based, yes.
For many distribution based TL installations, yes.
But not for TeX Live upstream as installed by our installer.

We do the very thing written above in Debian, but that doesn't mean
it can be done upstream.

Upstream TeX Live user **DO** have problems with the above settings.
If you install TeX Live to
	/usr/local/texlive/2022/
then
	TEXMFDIST=/usr/local/texlive/2022/texmf-dist
and nothing related to share or whatever.

The upstream installer has a different directory layout, namely all
under one directory, then most distributions.

That is in fact rubbish ;-) TEXMFOS doesn't really have a meaning
here. In fact, it is some ConTeXt only what-so-ever to make
ConTeXt developers able to work with files distributed by the OS.

In Debian we comment out this variable:
https://github.com/debian-tex/texlive-nonbin/blob/master/texlive-base/debian/patches/debian-texmfcnf.lua#L49

For other patches necessary, see what is done in Debian:
https://github.com/debian-tex/texlive-nonbin/blob/master/texlive-base/debian/patches/
in particular
	texmf.cnf-debian
and
	debian-texmfcnf.lua

Would it not be possible to support both upstream's portable installation and OS-level installation?

Something like TEXMFSYSVAR="selfautoparent:texmf-var;selfautoparent:/var/lib/texmf", TEXMFSYSCONFIG="selfautoparent:texmf-config;selfautoparent:/etc/texmf", and TEXMFDIST="selfautoparent:texmf-dist;selfautodir:share/texmf-dist"?

Do you mean in texmf.cnf? That will not work, kpathsea does not support
this notion.

Furthermore, having hard-coded paths like /var/lib/texmf or /etc/texmf
which might be different on different distributions (why not
/var/cache/texmf, or /etc/texlive/, ...) baked into upstream is not
a good idea.

I don't think it is soooo difficult for downstream distributions to
adjust the paths to the correct values. In Debian we are doing this
since 15+ years with practically unchanged patches.

Best regards

Norbert

I meant doing it in texmfcnf.lua.

I don't know whether gentoo developers will bother to fix it, though. They tend to not respond.

Ah, ok. I don't know whether this would work. And it is up to the
ConTeXt developers not us.

I discovered that

having

return {
    content = {
        variables = {
            TEXMFSYSVAR     = "selfautoparent:/var/lib/texmf",
            TEXMFDIST       = "selfautodir:share/texmf-dist",
            TEXMFSYSCONFIG  = "selfautoparent:/etc/texmf",
        }
    }
}

in /usr/share/texmf-local/web2c/texmfcnf.lua overrides those variables in /usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmfcnf.lua

However, `mtxrun --variables` prints

TEXMFSYSVAR
exp: selfautoparent:/var/lib/texmf
res: ./var/lib/texmf

What is "."? Does it mean the current working directory? Or, does it actually mean "/"?

Should it not resolve to `/`?

Did you ever consider to contact the author of this file?  As Norbert
already pointed out this file is not maintained by TeX Live but by the
ConTeXt team.  Even if a file shipped with TeX Live contains a bug,
this bug has to be fixed by its author.

If the TeX Live team would modify files provided by others you can be
assured that the modification gets lost at the next package update.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Certainly not, . is the current working directory while / is the root
directory of the file system

That doesn't make sense ... you want
	TEXMFSYSVAR = "/var/lib/texmf"
as I have shown you in the Debian patch.

When you use selfautoparent then it will be relative paths which leads
to:\

. is standard notation on all filesystems I know and indicates the
current working directory.

Norbert Preining pointed out that each operating system can use slightly different paths, so it's best for each operating system to have its own version of /usr/share/texmf-local/web2c/texmfcnf.lua that overrides certain variables in /usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c/texmfcnf.lua.

I suspect either mtxrun or texmfcnf.lua refuses to accept "/" as selfautoparent.

Since mtxrun of TexLive OS package is in /usr/bin, selfautodir should be /usr, and selfautoparent should be /.

selfautoparent is the parent directory of selfautodir.

You can easily check by
	kpsewhich -var-value SELFAUTOPARENT
asuming that kpsewhich and mtxrun are in the same directory.

But then, the semantics of texmfcnf.lua is complete unknown to me.
I don't know what Hans is doing there.

Interesting ? the installer claims not to be able to install 
"a2ping.win32", yet I, who run a Windows system, have no such file and 
yet no error was reported during the installation.

There is also no file with the extension "win32" in the TL repository.

   $ find . -iname '*.win32'

returns nothing.  The option -iname makes the search case-intensitive.

a2ping is a Perl script which is platform independent per se.  There
is no special version for Windows.

I have no clue what's going wrong here.

  Reinhard

`kpsewhich -var-value SELFAUTOPARENT` returns `/`.
However, mtxrun is separate from kpathsea.
mtxrun does its own thing.

It seems mtxrun refuses to accept '/' as SELFAUTOPARENT.

a2ping.win32 is a package name, not a filename (this package
contains only a wrapper for the actual script). There was probably a
hiccup with the mirror. You can probably install it later without
trouble.

Well, as already said a few times, please report it to the maintainers

It turned out fonts for old X applications have to be properly
installed in order for tlmgr to operate properly. I followed these
instructions:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fonts#Older_applications
After that everything started working as it should.

It surprised me that showhyphens was removed from Texlive 2022 during a
recent tlmgr update.

[  1/351] auto-remove: showhyphens ... done

Instead I got

[326/351, 01:04:03/01:04:57] auto-install: showhyphenation (63578) [62k] ... done

which seems to be a fine replacement, but still, is it really
intentional that packages are removed like that during an update of the
same release, causing some documents to stop working? (Unless there is
for example a security problem or a license problem.)

The showhyphens author Patrick Gundlach decided in June that showhyphens should
be moved to obsolete in CTAN. If a package gets moved to obsolete/ tree then it
will be removed from texlive.

Thanks for the explanation! Is that really a good policy, though? To me
it seems obviously good if a Texlive release is rather  stable, and it
would be better if obsoletion meant that the package isn't included in the
*next release* of Texlive.

I think this is worth contemplating. It would help with some nasty 
surprises (and even though one could still reinstall from CTAN) it seems 
a good policy that TL XX represents the software corpus that is on the 
TL XX DVD + bug fixes and additions that happened during the year XX but 
not suddenly dropping packages while XX is the current version.

I agree. Declaring a package obsolete is not the same as request of removal.

Hi Frank,
I fully agree with you in general.  But there are a few things to be
considered as well.

In an ideal world there wouldn't be different TeX Live releases at
all.  Some Linux distributors provide "rolling releases" already
(Gentoo, Arch Linux) where you install the system only once.  The
system can be updated any time later without the need to ever install
it again.

This would also be fine for TeX Live and a DVD would then would
provide just a snapshot taken at a particular time.  Because TeX Live
can only provide what's on CTAN, there is no dependeny of package
release numbers and TeX Live releases numbers.

The only reason there are distinct TeX Live releases is that many
people are involved when new binaries have to be compiled.  Many
platforms are to be supported and all of them have to behave equally.
There is absolutely no way to provide new binaries more often than
once a year.

As far as [La]TeX packages are concerned we can assume that TeX Live
already provides "rolling releases".  Most users install via the
network and update immediately afterwards, so they have a snapshot
rather than a distinct version of TeX Live.

I'm aware that the removal of packages is always problematic.  But all
TeX Live can do is to provide what is currently on CTAN.  TeX Live
only removes packages if their licenses are not appropriate.

Everything else is up to the package authors.  They are the only
persons who can make such decisions.  And both, TeX Live and CTAN,
take author's requests very serious for obvious reasons.  

In this particular case a package was removed because its author
thought that people should use the replacement instead.  It is
unfortunate if this breaks existing documents but this is quite
unrelated to TeX Live release numbers.  Keeping the removed package in
TeX Live 2022 only postpones the problem.

Another point to consider is that Linux distributors provide distinct
versions of TeX Live.  But if they provide updates too, their systems
cannot be in sync with a particular release of TeX Live anymore.

Frank, if you think that it's worthwhile to put the showhyphens
package back to CTAN, it's necessary to convince the author.

But then I don't see any reason to remove it again when TeX Live 2023
is released.  If we want to make sure that existing documents are not
broken by removed packages the release number of TeX Live shouldn't
matter at all.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Personally I like it like this. I 

I update regularly and always check first the changes with 
tlmgr update --list. 

A normal update shows 5-20 updates/autoinstalls/removals and it is
easy to skim and to decide if one of them could be a problem. 

This means that I get changes/removals slowly spread over the year
and don't get hit by all of them at once when I switch to a new
texlive version.

Obsolete packages should not be removed until at least a few months when
the
obsolete package and a replacement are both available.  There should be
some visible warning that an installed package has been obsoleted.   Maybe
(after the overlap period) a dummy replacement package could provide a
short note:
"the X package is obsolete. The recommended replacement is Y." with
some notes on the changes required to use Y in a document that was using X.

That is the correct fix. 

@Boris, can you please fix that in your repo and upload a new version to
CTAN, please.
You cannot rely on finding modules with use that are not in the default
search path unless you do it in the BEGIN block.

Thanks

Hi there,
under windows 11, during the installation of Texlive 2022 by the executable install-tl-windows.exe, the antivirus stops from the start, the installation by indicating to me that 3 files kpathsea.doc.tar, hyphen-base.tar and kpathsea.tar attempt to modify the encryption system (ransomware, see attachment). Has this happened to you? What should I do ?
Thanking you.

Hi Franck

Thank you for reporting this problem. I think you've done the right thing,
by sending in this report. I don't run Windows so might not be able to help
you directly. However the following information would be helpful.

1. How important and urgent is it for you that you have TeX installed on
your PC?
2. By what process did you obtain the files the anti-virus complained
about. For example, it might be a DVD, downloaded ISO or a network install.

For those who do run Windows, here's the URL for the antivirus you're using.
https://www.trendmicro.com/en_gb/forHome.html

with kind regards

Jonathan

Did you use elevated privileges for the installation?  Windows TeX Live
installation does not need elevated privileges.

You may want to read Section 1.4 Security considerations
<https://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-60001.4> and
proceed to install GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard) (without using tlmgr).  Gpg4win
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpg4win> is widely used, or
you can install GnuPG command-line tools for Windows from Msys2 or Cygwin64
or in a WSL linux distribution (if you have WSL you may find that TeX Live
in WSL is superior to the Windows CTAN version).

In addition to the current install-tl-windows.exe, CTAN mirrors should
provide install-tl-windows.exe.sha512 and install-tl-windows.exe.sha512.asc
needed to verify downloads using GnuPG.

For those who do run Windows, here's the URL for the antivirus you're using.

Checking downloads with GnuPG requires non-trivial extra work, but that is
the reality of the
internet we have today.

1) This has been the policy for 20 years. I don't see any overwhelming
reason to change it now. Sorry Per.

2) Delaying removal just delays the agony, so that anyone affected only
learns about as an unpleasant surprise at some random future point,
decoupled from when the package was obsoleted and people are more likely
to know/remember.

3) Anyone affected can reinstall the package for themselves. And then
you will have solved the problem for good, not just until some next
release.

4) In general, any idea of "stability" is chimerical nowadays, so far as
I've observed. It's pointless to pretend otherwise. Package removals are
very rare compared to package updates, plenty of which have a nontrivial
chance of breaking existing documents.  If you want stability, don't
update anything. --best, karl.

Antivirus programs commonly flag packages from TeX Live out of who knows
what reason. If you have used the normal installer, packages should be
verified and safe to install. We don't install anything outside the
installation directory besides some desktop integration, uninstall
registry entries, usual stuff.

Hi

The TeX Hour has left holiday mode. If you were on holiday I hope you had
some pleasant days. The next TeX Hour is back to normal.

Subject: The future of TeX (Don Knuth) and LaTeX Tagged PDF (Mittelbach and
Rowley)
Date and time: Thursday 1 September, 14, 21 July, 6:30 to 7:30pm BST (ie
UK) time.
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

About the future of TeX and Tagged PDF.

In 1990 Don Knuth announced that his work on developing TeX, METAFONT and
Computer Modern had come to an end. He also wrote:

Of course I do not claim to have found the best solution to every problem.
> I simply claim that it is a great advantage to have a fixed point as a
> building block. Improved macro packages can be added on the input side;
> improved device drivers can be added on the output side.
>

URL (PDF): https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf

Thirty years later, in 2020, Mittelbach and Rowley announced and described


> the start of a multi-year project to enhance LATEX to fully and naturally
> support the creation of structured document formats, in particular the
> ?tagged PDF? format as required by accessibility standards such as PDF/UA.
>

The LaTeX team seems to be in the second of the six phases in the project.
The first was preparing the ground, the second provides tagging of simple
documents (no math or tables or hyperlinks). Phase six is conformance to
standards "so far as this is possible ... without any post-processing of
the PDF file".

URL (PDF):
https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2020-FMi-TUB-tb129mitt-tagpdf.pdf

In the TeX Hour this Thursday (1 September) I will outline a Knuthian
approach to the problem of producing tagged PDF. More exactly, my approach
is to leave LaTeX (the macros) and pdfTeX (the typesetting engine) largely
unchanged. Somewhat optimistically, I believe that given equal resources
this approach can both overtake the LaTeX team and give a better result.

Finally, SAVE THE DATE, Thursday 29 September, 6:30 to 8:30pm BST (ie UK)
time. This is the date and time for a special TeX Hour "Rethinking TeX in
STEM". We have as special guests Dennis M?ller, (sTeX), Martin Ruckert
(HINT) and Peter Williams (Tectonic). All three have recently given talks
on these topics at the annual TeX Conference.

wishing you happy TeXing

Jonathan
