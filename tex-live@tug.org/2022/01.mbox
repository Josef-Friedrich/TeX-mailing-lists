Dear TUG Members,

Firstly, please let me wish you all a very happy and a prosperous New
Year....

I installed Texlive2021 fresh after deleting previous installations of
texlive packages. The installation went fine but the following file:

---- test LaTeX package---

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

test

\end{document}

----- end of test file---

gave the following output:

----pdflatex output----

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.23 (TeX Live 2021) (preloaded format=pdflatex) entering extended mode

I have installed all the packages except the packages for humanities,
social sciences, music, games and (European, Japanese, Chinese)
languages. A search for article.cls gave:

Maybe a stupid idea, but did you adjust the texlive-path in 
~/.bashrc ?

# TexLive
TL_DIR="/usr/local/texlive/2021"
export PATH=$TL_DIR/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH

Follow-up:

The following tlmgr command list all local installed packages containing
the file pattern "*article.cls*" 

~> # tlmgr search --file --word article.cls
latex:
        texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/article.cls
latex-base-dev:
        texmf-dist/tex/latex-dev/base/article.cls
~> # 

At least the command should list one package: latex.
I installed almost all texlive packages and got a list of 20 packages,
but only the packages shown above contain exactly a file named
"article.cls". As far as I know, the second package "latex-base-dev" is
not absolutely necessary.

The "article.cls" file in your list was found with the system command
locate. However, this is not a statement about a possibly successful
tex-internal file search.

I hope my explanation was understandable and helped you to fix the
problem.

I suggest doing

tlmgr conf

which would  show you whether your configuration allows article.cls to be
found by kpsewhich.  The configuration files should have the
form /usr/local/texlive/2021/...

Hi

Happy New Year. May you and those around you be safe and happy.

When a year ago I started the weekly TeX Hour video meetings, I had ideas
as to what would happen. I'm pleased to say that I paid some attention to
what was going on around me, and that I was able to let go of many of my
previous ideas. Experience, someone said, is knowledge you get just after
you needed it!

Therefore, please don't give my predictions for 2022 priority over your
wishes and opinions. And share with me and others if you wish. We'll all
benefit from that. At least for a while, we'll continue to meet at 6:30pm
UK time on Zoom. All are welcome. Here's the details.

Meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Last year, I introduced a monthly cycle of B, A, C, D, E. These letters
stand for

1st Thursday: Beginners
2nd Thursday: Accessibility
3rd Thursday: Conversions (and new for 2022 - Community)
4th Thursday: Durable Documents
5th Thursday: Experiments and Exploration

The New Year is a time for review and taking stock. And for new beginnings.
I hope this month to discuss the B, A, C, D, E topics starting from
scratch. In other words, in a way that helps us see what is habit, what is
new, what is essential and what is custom. Although our planet has returned
to its starting point for its annual orbit of our sun, much has changed for
the human (and other) beings living on the surface of our planet since last
we were here.

The appendix contains a New Year's message I sent to the members of UK TUG
just after Christmas. The context is that 2 months ago the Committee
persuaded the members of UK TUG to vote in favor of dissolving UK TUG. I've
been a member for about 30 years, and this is a sad event.

Happy TeXing and wishing you a safe and happy 2022.

APPENDIX: Community + James Webb Space Telescope + Desmond Tutu

Two international events last week have increased my optimism regarding the
support and promotion of TeX. They also shine some light on the way
forward. The first is the successful launch into orbit of the James Webb
Space Telescope,. The second is the widespread recognition and appreciation
of the public service made by Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

The Webb Telescope shows that what Newton set into motion over 300 years
ago with his Principia Mathematica still has internal vigor, and public
recognition and funding. It is also a triumph for international cooperation
for a common human purpose and need, to understand what there is and what
is possible. About 50 years ago similar forces created the environment in
which Don Knuth's creation of TeX was possible.

Desmond Tutu used his position and skills to help bring down racist,
undemocratic and inhuman apartheid in South Africa. His route was
non-violent opposition, as pioneered by Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for
Indian Independence and Martin Luther King in the Civil Rights Movement in
the USA. His relation to TeX requires some explanation.

In the 1990s Tutu was chair of the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which did much to bring about peaceful reconciliation and
restorative (instead of punitive) justice to South Africa. The Commission
helped transform South Africa into a "rainbow nation". Tutu's work relied
on an African world view that there is a universal bond of sharing that
connects all humanity, or more concisely that "I am because we are". It is
humanity to others.

In many of the Bantu languages, this world view is called "ubuntu". It has
a close match to the ideals of sharing, community and collaboration that
are central to open source software. Also in the 1990s Mark Shuttleworth in
South Africa developed both open source and proprietary software. In the
2000s he used proceeds from the latter to fund development of a Linux
distribution that was, at his request, called Ubuntu. Nelson Mandela
defined "ubuntu" on video as part of the launch of Ubuntu Linux.

Conditions exist for science and humanity to develop and grow in 2022. And
this includes the continuation of Don Knuth's work in Digital Typography.

Subject: "! Undefined control sequence. <argument> \fail" after update. But
 what package?
Message-ID: <CALeLr1=3U6ihzKqjP9XHnTKn7BonGnFp2QQyZxXu-yiRc+++bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

today I've updated my TeX Live 2021 distribution for the first time in
a couple of months. Of course, that update was massive- Afterwards, my
document stopped working. This is the error in the console, printed
while processing the preamble:

---
(/usr/local/texlive/2021-broken-update/texmf-dist/tex/latex/xpatch/xpatch.sty)
! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \fail

l.112   {}{\fail}

?
! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \fail

l.116   {}{\fail}

?
)
---

xpatch hasn't been updated for ages, so that package is unlikely the
culprit. I'm at a loss here.

I extracted the names of all the .sty files from the log. With that
list I diffed those names to the working installation of TeX Live 2021
that's in my backup. Thus it turned out that 26 packages differ
between the working installation (from before the update) and the
broken installation. But which one is broken?

I'm perfectly aware that this error description is far from ideal. I'm
sorry I can't provide an MWE here. Never the less: Is there someone
here who can point me towards a solution, or at least to a better
understanding of what's going on here? Thanks.

Best,

   Alexander

Providing a MWE is always possible. It's just a matter of effort. And without
any code shown, every answer would be speculation. Nevertheless I would
speculate that the lines 112 and 116 of one of your TeX files use xpatch to
patch some code of either LaTeX or a class or package and the patch fails
after the update, because the relevant code has changed in LaTeX or the class
or the package.

Hi,

as default, LaTeX does not trace the error, it just displays the line
number but not the file and does not show what triggered the error.
Add the following to the beginning of your main file:

\errorcontextlines=999

It will then show the complete trace of the expansion leading to the
undefined control sequence.

while that's true in general it isn't needed here as the undefined command
is already shown explicitly in the file at line  112 (the full log would
show which file)
so increasing errorcontextlines will not give any more information.

this is clearly an intentional cheap way to generate an error message by
the author of this file, intentionally using the undefined command \fail

The code will be something like

\xpatchcmd\something{\oldcode}{\newcode}
{}{\fail}


with the intended behaviour being that \oldcode is replaced by \newcode if
possible or the undefined command \fail raises an error.

For some reason (probably \something being updated and no longer having
\oldcode in its definition) the  patch failed so the last argument is
executed giving the error that \fail is undefined,
which is just shorthand to avoid writing out a full error message to say
the patch failed.

Maybe this may be useful in order to find the culprit (`rg` stands for
`ripgrep`):

  ?????
  ? $ rg -F "{\fail}" /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/
  ? /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/pdfmanagement-testphase/xcolor-patches-tmp-ltx.sty
  ? 52:%\pretocmd{\XC at col@rlet}   {\@expl at color@set@@ne{#2}{#4}}{}{\fail}
  ? 79:%\pretocmd{\XC at definec@lor}{\@expl at color@set@@nnn{#2}{#4}{#5}}{}{\fail}
  ? 
  ? /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tagpdf/tagpdfdocu-patches.sty
  ? 33: {}{\fail}
  ? 52: {}{\fail}
  ? 207:\xpatchcmd\enit at preset{\@firstofone}{\tag at enit@format at preset}{}{\fail}
  ? 209:\xpatchcmd\@item{\box\@labels}{\tagmcend \box\@labels \tagmcbegin{tag=P}}{}{\fail}
  ?????

As your document errors in the preamble, providing an MWE is really
easy. At least provide the full log until the error so that one has
at least a chance to identify the package.

It occurs to me that the means by which TeX identifies the location of an error is not so great when many input files are involved (especially with nested \input commands). Perhaps there should be a change to the output[1] of an error location from

> l.112   {}{\fail}

to 

> file.tex: l.112   {}{\fail}

We can do this by modifying s.313 so that it does:

> print(input_stack[base_ptr].name_field); print_nl(?l.?); print_int(line);

instead of 

> print_nl(?l.?); print_int(line);

Unless there?s some compelling reason not to, this seems like something that could/should have been done long ago.

1. I had originally thought that this would need to be an eTeX extension but I see that Knuth writes:

that is already available as --file-line-error  command line option in all

Subject: xecjk depends on ctex since v3.8.3
Message-ID: <f6dabc4e-2066-7f46-e1e3-b9f29ae95120@gmail.com>

Hi, Karl

xecjk once worked fine without ctex installed.
xecjk is a member of collection-xetex.

However, since xecjk v3.8.3, it requires ctexhook.sty.

Can you add a dependency on ctex to xecjk?

I see ctex has a dependency on xecjk among others.
Would such cyclic dependencies cause trouble in TeX Live?

Regards,
Akira

Actually trying this out, I see the problem. The feature is implemented to produce the output in the wrong place:

Without the flag, the output is, e.g.:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.16 \qognbo

With the flag the output is:

./xx.tex:16: Undefined control sequence.
l.16 \qognbo

This indicates that it was put into the definition of print_err (which has no indication that modifying it is a valid extension of TeX) instead of show_context (which does have that indication), and it really does belong in show_context just as a matter of logic and semantics.

Everybody,

thanks for the feedback! Once again, I must say.

It turned out that the "\fail" macro was buried deeply within my own
code. That part used to work, but apparently upstream changes in
another package caused this to fail now. It'll take some research on
my part to find out what the exact cause was. Sorry for taking up your
time.

It learned a couple of things today:

The importance of an MWE. Thanks to Markus and Ulrike for pointing
that out. The second thing is the command line option and
\errorcontextlines macro to narrow down the place where the error is.
These are very helpful hints for debugging situations like this in the
future.

Best regards

   Alexander

    xecjk is a member of collection-xetex.

By the way, does xecjk in fact still only work under XeTeX nowadays, or
does it also work under LuaTeX?

    Can you add a dependency on ctex to xecjk?

Ok, done.

     I see ctex has a dependency on xecjk among others.
     Would such cyclic dependencies cause trouble in TeX Live?

It works out ok, as far as I can tell, thanks to Norbert's
implementation of finding all the dependencies before installing packages.

We'll find out if there's a problem, but I highly doubt this is the
first circular dependency. --thanks, karl.

I'm just a casual user of xecjk, but in xeCJK.dtx
you can see the following code:

    % \pkg{xeCJK} ???? \XeTeX ??????
    %    \begin{macrocode}
    \msg_new:nnn { xeCJK } { Require-XeTeX }
      {
        The~xeCJK~package~requires~XeTeX~to~function.\\\\
        You~must~change~your~typesetting~engine~to~"xelatex" \\
        instead~of~plain~"latex"~or~"pdflatex"~or~"lualatex".\\
        Loading~xeCJK~will~abort!
      }

This means it still requires XeTeX to work.

Hi

Note: Next week Nelson Beebe will a TeX Hour special guest, talking about
TeX Live 2022.

First, there's a really valuable and important accessibility thread for us
on the Blind Math mailing list. It's deeply rooted in real-world problems
and solutions. Mainly it's Jonathan Godfrey's response to Brandon Bigg's
query: Tutorial on Using RMarkdown?
http://nfbnet.org/pipermail/blindmath_nfbnet.org/2022-January/010146.html

In tomorrow's (Thursday) TeX Hour I'll share my initial thoughts on an
architecture for accessible typesetting. This will be a technical session,
focused on having control over what happens whenever input text is added to
TeX's horizontal list for the current paragraph. Last year a similar TeX
Hour conversation led to the concept of a Portable TeX Document, so
finger's crossed for tomorrow. All welcome.

Meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Next week I'm delighted that Nelson Beebe has kindly agreed to be a special
guest, as a expert and long-standing participant in the annual process that
produces a new TeX Live distribution each year. Nelson tells me that the
current status of his work and the final result for 2021 are logged at
 http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2022/
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2021/

The TeX Hour continues to evolve. I hope at least once a month to have a
special guest to talk with us about an important topic. Nelson is the first
one this month (unless I immodestly count myself). I you'd like me to
invite someone, or volunteer yourself, just contact me.

 And we're enlarging the list of topics for the monthly cycle of B, A, C,
D, E. These letters now stand for

1st Thursday: Beginners (and new for 2022 - Basics)
2nd Thursday: Accessibility (and new for 2022 - Architecture)
3rd Thursday: Conversions (and new for 2022 - Community)
4th Thursday: Durable Documents
5th Thursday: Experiments and Exploration

Happy TeXing.

this package.

(pdf|xe|lua)latex-dev engines seem to bump into \@doc at describe which

Hello,

For this dev release, Frank has switched up doc from v2 to v3. I think 
he's busy for a day or so, but I'm sure he'll look at this.

It's not TL-specific, so ideally raise on LaTeX-L.

Regards,

Joseph

Subject: installation issue tex-live 2021: apa7
Message-ID: <a04cbccd-8404-7ff5-b50b-e95d2f3283e6@posteo.de>

Hi,

unfortunately installation of TeX Live 2021 'full-scheme' using 
install-tl fails because of a checksum error:
"TLPDB::_install_data: consistency checks failed for 
/media/cdrom0/texlive/archive/apa7.doc.r58121.tar.xz
TLUtils::install_packages: Failed to install apa7"

OS: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye), Version 11.2
media: DVD TeX Collection 2021

I'm a member of dante.

Is there anybody knowing how to circumvent this problem or where to find 
an update? Thank you.

G?nter Essers

Please, if you like, have a look at details of my last installation attempt:
(1) installation profile "texlive.profile"
(2) installation log file

Subject: Texlive Path Setup
Message-ID: <bf4afe0b-b2d0-8273-6ee6-824f6ce061a4@web.de>

Hey Everyone,

I ran into a problem setting up texlive on a new machine. I can't get
PATH setup correctly it seems.

Here is what i get when i try to run 'texdoc bibtex' this is the output
i get:


    warning: kpathsea: configuration file texmf.cnf not found in these
    directories:
    /usr/bin:/usr/bin/share/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/bin/share/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/bin/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/bin/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/bin/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/bin/texmf/web2c:/usr:/usr/share/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/share/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/share/texmf/web2c:/usr/texmf-local/web2c:/usr/texmf-dist/web2c:/usr/texmf/web2c://texmf-local/web2c:/://share/texmf-local/web2c://share/texmf-dist/web2c://share/texmf/web2c://texmf-local/web2c://texmf-dist/web2c://texmf/web2c.

     ?? ?no field package.preload['texdoclib']
     ?? ?[kpse lua searcher] file not found: 'texdoclib'
     ?? ?[kpse C searcher] file not found: 'texdoclib'


It's just looking through a bunch of standard directories. However i did
adjust PATH to include my texlive install
'/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux'

Here is the output of 'printenv PATH':


/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/lib/jvm/default/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl


Running latex itself doesn't work either. If i try to use it on a
example file ('latex /tmp/example.tex') i get this:


    latex /tmp/example.tex
    warning: kpathsea: configuration file texmf.cnf not found in these

    This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.23 (TeX Live 2021/Arch

    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at
    /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/mktexfmt line 25.
    I can't find the format file `latex.fmt'!



My gut feeling is that some other program i installed also came with the
standard texlive installation included in my linux distro (Manjaro).

When i run 'which latex' i get:


     ?/usr/bin/latex


Which is itself just a symlink to


    /usr/bin/pdftex


The setup was exactly the same i had on my old machine and everything
worked fine there. I'm honestly a little lost right now

Any tips on how i could resolve this?

Greetings

George

You should add the TeX-Live folder /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux at
the beginning of PATH before /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin and /bin not in the
middle after /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin and /bin. Otherwise the TeX binaries of
your linux distribution will be found instead of the binaries of TeX Live. But
if, e.g., /usr/bin/texdoc is used, it will not search for other files in the
TeX Live installation of /usr/local/texlive/2021.

Hello,
try to put the texlive path at the beginning of your PATH; in your setup 
/usr/bin/latex is found first.
Good luck

Thanks you Markus. That did solve the issue for me.

Now I'm curious though:

Is there any way to elegantly tell Linux which version of texlive to use?

I know that some folks out there have multiple versions running. Like
one for each release or stuff like that.

There has to be a better way then to just update your environment
variables every time....


Btw. how do i best reply to this mailinglist?

I just sent another mail to tex-live at tug.org for this one. I guess
that's probably not how it is intended?

I just noticed that the replies don't show up in thunderbird if i do it
this way.

As you can probably tell i'm new around here

Yes there is another way, which I think is more elegant: in
/usr/local/texlive you create a symlink named, e.g. "current", pointing to
the year you want to use; also, to be on the safe side, you  rename your
"texmf-local" folder to something corresponding to the texlive year, e.g.
"texlive-local-2021", and make "texmf-local" a symlink to that folder. Then
you put the "current" folder in your path.

Now, when you want to switch to another year, you just change the symlinks
to point to the other [year] and texmf-local-[year] folders respectively.
There is no need to change your path anymore and the switch is instant!

Hi,

there are many ways. My setup contains
/usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-linux almost at the beginning of
PATH (I have good reasons to override some binaries but it needs
caution). Here "current" is a symlink to a version which I want to
use. In addition, I have a script written in Tcl/Tk. It looks into
/usr/local/texlive/ and offers all directories representing years and
current. It then replaces the "current" element with the selected path
but for the current terminal only. Thus I have one version selected
for my general work but can switch to an older version or to a testing
version just in one terminal. And I can return to current if I like.
If a new version of TL comes and I want to switch to it as the

Hey Everyone,

 ?Thanks for the input. It sounds really neat. I will definitely try that.

@Zden?k Wagner:

I would love to take a look at it. Haven't used Tcl before, but i should
be able to translate it into a shellscript.


Greetings George

As you can see, I have a few additional directories with my own
development. They should not be recognized by the switching tool. The
tool contains two files, tl and tl.tk. Both must be in the same
directory which is listed in PATH. The mail file is tl and its
executable flag is unset intentionally. It is invoked this way:

. tl

Notice the space after the period. It is important, it guarantees that
it is called in the same shell, without it the PATH change will have
no effect. tl.tk does the job, a very simple dialogue is presented and
a user can select a version. Of course, a pure textual version can be
prepared but this tool can even work reasonably fast via X-forwarding.

Another approach to supporting multiple annual versions of TeX Live is
our approach at Utah:

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/SYS.texlive-2022.csh
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah/SYS.texlive-2022.sh

Once an annual release is official, we change internal symlinks 
so that commands

	source $prefix/skel/SYS.texlive.csh
	.      $prefix/skel/SYS.texlive.sh

in user acccount startup scripts point to the scripts for the new
version.  We support all years from 2003 to 2022, and the scripts
support many different CPU architectures and operating systems, and
those scripts are propagated to hundreds of systems in our test lab.

Subject: SyncTeX not working right with LuaLaTeX in TeX Live
Message-ID: <a6ccf2ca-168a-8928-06c0-14929e7a1e11@posteo.de>

Hello everyone,

I am experiencing an issue with SyncTeX and LuaLaTeX in TeX Live. When I 
run `lualatex` with `-synctex=1`, the synchronization between the PDF 
and the TeX file does not work correctly. For example, typesetting the 
attached example file and Ctrl + Clicking on the "1" in the resulting 
PDF in the TeXstudio previewer takes me to the `3` in the source. In 
real documents the difference can be much larger.

Searching online I found a matching bug report in TeXstudio's bug 
tracker from three years ago [1] but it has long been closed as the 
people there deemed it to be a bug in TeX Live. As I could not find 
anything else (but the issue is still present in an up to date TeX 
Live), I also asked a question about it on Stack Exchange with some more 
detail [2].

[1]: https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio/issues/590
[2]: https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/630528/48973

Here's the gist of what I know:

- The issue appears with `lualatex`, not with `pdflatex`.

- The issue appears with TeX Live on Windows, not with MiKTeX or MacTeX.

- I have confirmed the issue with both TeXstudio and TeXworks on my 
machine. One tex.sx user reported the issue _not_ appearing when using 
sumatra as the viewer and winedt as the editor.

I am unsure if SyncTeX is doing something wrong or if several PDF 
viewers are, but since the affected TeXshop is shipped with TeX Live I 
hope that this mailing list is the right place to turn to.

Thanks

Benedikt

That was a bug in lua[...]tex on Windows in TeX Live due to my mistake.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Here the bug is fixed. Please wait for the TeX Live 2022.

In the case of TeX Live 2021, try 64bit binaries at CTAN/systems/win32/TLW64.
It looks like the 64bit lualatex works OK.
You will need to recreate a format by fmtutil-sys --byfmt lualatex,
because the present expl3.lua seems to create different formats for 32bit/64bit luahbtex
on Windows.

Best,
Akira

Tlshell also tries to create a shortcut for a command-line which

I know, but I hesitate to burden the translators with translating
this menu, which will not be there anymore if and when we switch to
64-bit Windows for real.

Subject: Repeated Mac arm64 crashes of xdvi-xaw with "set_no_char: attempt to
 set character of unknown font, offset 42"
Message-ID: <YeySmXy5PH3R8bxl@loud-room.local>

Hi. I hope this is the correct place to report this bug, which I have found incredibly frustrating.

A few months ago I moved my work environment from an older x86_64 Mac to a new arm64 M1 Max running MacOS 12.1 and XQuartz 2.8.1, but still with Tex Live 2015, and immediately I began seeing crashes in xdvi when hitting shift-R to reload the current DVI file. Since I did not need to work on any major TeX projects, so I was able to ignore it. I figured these would finally go away when I upgraded to Tex Live 2021, but having done that, the problems remain (and of course now I have a looming deadline this weekend that makes this very annoying).

Crashes look like this:

jhawk at loud-room 2021 eoir ca1 % xdvi-xaw t2a
xdvi-xaw: set_no_char: attempt to set character of unknown font, offset 42
xdvi-xaw 22.87.04 (Xaw toolkit): ../../../texk/xdvik/dvi-draw.c:488: Shouldn't happen: I'll abort now, to help you debugging this.

They are always unknown font, offset 42.

MacOS 12.1 makes it extremely annoying to get a backtrace, because of security hardening and the lack of a debugging entitlement in xdvi-xaw. After hunting around, I found https://gist.github.com/talaviram/1f21e141a137744c89e81b58f73e23c3 which I used to rewrite the code signature and add entitlements that allow lldb to work. After so doing (binary is renamed from xdvi-xaw to xdvi-xaw2) I get this backtrace:

(lldb) bt

(I'm sorry there are not symbols. I'm not what the path of least resistance to get them would be?)

Although I can trigger this crash 100% of the time with the document I'm working on, reducing it to a minimum working example was surprisingly challenging and fragile. Changing almost any single line seems to at first make the problem go away, but oftentimes it simply makes the crash less reproducible, occuring on the 30th or 50th press of shift-R.  What I've attached seems far too complicated to be the minimum, but I was unable to easily reduce it any further.

Minimum working example that generates the crash follows below my email signature. latex it, xdvi it, and hit shift-R in xdvi and it should crash immediately.

Please run dvitype on your dvi file. If that fails then the dvi file is not
valid. Attaching the dvi file to your response would also help.

Thanks, Jonathan. dvitype produces nearly 1,000 lines of output and
appears to succeed. The actual .dvi file as well as the dvitype output
are attached here.
And, since I guess this list culture is good with MIME attachments,
the MWE .tex file from my original message for good measure, since its
size is dwarfed by the other two.

Here are the first few lines of the dvitype output:

Thank you for this John. I'm not a Mac or ARM person so I can't help much
directly. dvitype works for me on my linux machine.

As you have a deadline this weekend I suggest that you find a work-around.
Perhaps using pdflatex will help you, depending on the PS specials you are
using. Otherwise, perhaps use dvips + ps 2 pdf for preview.

I hope this helps with your deadline.

I didn't mean to suggest I had no workarounds -- as Jonathan suggests, pdflatex works, as does a "while :; xdvi file; sleep 1; done" wrapper.

I don't yet know if this is a Mac or an arm64 problem? -- I'd think the question would be what's going on at xdvik/dvi-draw.c:488 and to determine what state is invalid (and then why). I'd imagine we could get there with some platform-independent debugging in lldb, or perhaps some debugging printfs or tracing, but I'm not familiar with this code and could use some guidance.

I did ./Build --debug for xdvik-22.87.05 from source (with a configure patch from https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/kpathsea/configure?r1=55760&r2=55759&pathrev=55760) and I now have a better stack trace now, with symbols and function parameters:

Does this suggest any useful lines of inquiry?


[ Aside: What's the right way to run TeX tools from their build tree? If I just attempt to run xdvi-bin naively, I have all kinds of texmf.cnf issues that result in oodles of this sort of thing:

Setting TEXMFCNF=/usr/local/texlive/2021 doesn't seem to help, beyond resolving the texmf.cnf not found error.

The quick and dirty workaround was to copy xdvi-bin out of the build tree to /Library/TeX/texbin/ and run it from there. ]

John,

I'm the guy who compiles the Mac binaries, but this particular problem is way above my pay grade. Here are two additional data points.

a) The 2022 version of xdvi-xaw, compiled a week ago, has the same problem

b) If the 2022 xdvi-xaw universal binary is replaced by the 2022 x86_64 xdvi-xaw (containing no arm code), it still works, displaying your file in X11, but it also crashes the same way.

John,

One more data point. If the 2021 version of xdvi-xaw is run on an Intel machine running the latest Monterey, your source also crashes it in the same way. Therefore, the reference to Arm may be a red herring.

Note that there was a long period when XQuartz had no new releases, but after Apple introduced Arm machines, there was a period of intensive development leading to a new version and native Arm code. Both the Arm machine and the Intel machine used in my tests were running the latest macOS and the latest XQuartz.

John,

This is my final message. Maybe this is related to an XQuartz bug reported and eventually fixed in 2016. See

Thanks Richard. I didn't mean to indicate I thought it was necessarily an arm-specific problem, although it might be. I was trying to be very clear about the environment.

If I go back to my x86_64 machine, running TexLive 2015 (xdvik version 22.87, XQuartz 2.7.11, MacOS Sierra 10.12.6), then xdvi does not crash with the same t2a.dvi file. And that same x86_64 xdvi binary does crash when run on the arm64 machine under Rosetta emulation, just as the more recent native arm64 xdvi crashes.

I'm not really clear on what this suggests, other thans omething about the environment rather than the xdvi-xaw binary per se.

(Replying separately.)

    (I'm sorry there are not symbols. I'm not what the path of least
    resistance to get them would be?)

Good question. I wrote up the basic idea here:

https://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlbuild.html#Build-one-package

However, I suspect that for xdvi, especially on Macs, various things
will intervene to make it more difficult. If you give it a try, I'll be
curious how it comes out.

For completeness, let me mention a completely different path: some
distros provide symbol-full binaries as separate packages, so it would
be possible to "just" install the minimal distro packages and have a
debuggable binary.

I don't have a recipe, but that's my understanding, anyway.  I also
don't know if Homebrew or whatever other third-party Mac collections
provide such. (I mention this because evidently your present bug has
been around a while, so the exact source presumably does not matter.)

Hi John,

   crashes in xdvi when hitting shift-R to reload the current DVI

Fortunately or unfortunately, there is no problem reloading your dvi
with the x86_64-linux xdvi binary.

The xdvi maintainer is Paul Vojta. I don't know if he's able to debug a
problem that only manifests on Macs (so far as we know). Or if he's
reading this. I'll write him about it.

Re the debug-enabling entitlements you found at
  https://gist.github.com/talaviram/1f21e141a137744c89e81b58f73e23c3
I'm not sure if we should override Apple's defaults in this.
I leave it to Dick to decide. I agree it is annoying not to be able to
"just debug".

I'll reply separately on a couple other topics.

Thank you for all the debugging efforts, for sure. --thanks, karl.

Let me reply separately to this:

Unfortunately, it is necessary to set both TEXMFCNF and TEXMFROOT.

I often do that too. --happy debugging, karl.

John,

I'm not going to be much help debugging this. As an experiment, I tried a 120 page document of mine with lots of math and illustrations. It took a long time to get a crash this time. But eventually I did, and the following message appeared in Terminal:

XDvi 22.87.04 (Xaw toolkit): Failed assertion:
../../../texk/xdvik/dvi-draw.c:2187: "color_bot_size > 0": color_bot_size mustn't become negative!
Aborting now. Please report this as a bug to:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=23164&atid=377580

This on an Arm machine, but I don't believe Arm is related to the bug.

Folks,

Continuing to use my 120 page document, I now believe that shift-R is a red herring. I can open the document, and just scholl down the page number column rapidly back and forth, without ever calling shift-R, and create the crash. The terminal report is always similar to

?Dear Dr. Beebe,

Many thanks for your post re TeX Live 2021 and FreeBSD 13.0:
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2021-April/046779.html

Wondering if you can help me simplify install instructions for TeX Live 2021 on Windows and Mac?

I?m writing a book about the LaTeX markdown package and LaTeX typesetting for self-publishers called Publish Beautiful Books with Markdown: the Fast Track to LaTeX. 

Many of my prospective readers are devoted to MS Word and not a few are tech adverse. So I?m asking them to to step outside their comfort zone in the interest of publishing more trade-acceptable books.

So I need dead simple instructions on how to install TeX Live 2021 on Windows, Mac, and Linux. But the install instructions in the official TeX Live docs are so poorly written I hesitate to recommend them. 

I?m a Linux user so can work the recipe for Linux. But I don?t have access to Mac or Windows systems to install and test. So can you or one of your students provide fool-proof install instructions for Mac and Windows? I?d be happy to compensate for time and contribute the recipes back to public domain.

Vit Novotny suggests that I recommend a Docker package. But I fear that just adds one more layer of tech complexity.

You can see an example of my work here:

MacTeX is very easy to install, so I am surprised that you feel the 
instructions are unclear.

However, have you considered pointing to an online service in the first 
instance? Overleaf is the obvious one, though there are others.

Hello,

I am quite angry about your statement, that the installation documents 
are that bad, that you cannot recommend them. Feel free to improve them; 
if your suggestions are really better than the current state, I am quite 
sure that the maintainers will be happy.

If the existing instructions are too complicated for a user, I have 
serious doubts, that it would be a good idea to install any TeX 
distribution. (La)TeX has a rather steep learning curve and if someone 
fails to manage the first steps, it might be better to stay with Word.

Just my 2c

Lloyd R. Prentice,

I wrote the install instructions for TeX on the Mac. These instructions cover contingencies like "what to do if your internet connection is flaky." This makes them more complicated than necessary. Let me try to meet your goal.

Installing MacTeX:

MaxTeX requires macOS 10.14 or higher, and works on both Intel and Arm machines.

Download the install package by clocking on the link titled MacTeX.pkg at
https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html

After downloading, find the package in your downloads folder. It's icon looks like an
open cardboard box. Move this to the desktop or your home folder and double click
to run it.

The installer presents a Welcome page, a ReadMe page, a Software License page,
and a Final Page. Click "Install" on this last page to install. When asked for a password,
give the password used to log into your machine.

When installation ends, everything is configured and ready to use. Go to

/Applications/TeX/Docs and Spello Utilities

and read the document

READ ME FIRST

This document will lead you through the entry and typesetting of a short document.

Done.

Richard Koch

Hello,

the instalation instructions are complex because TeX Live can be
customized in many ways, it is possible to prepare a shared network
installation supporting many platforms from the same source etc.
However, the majority of users need just the default installation. So
what you need to recommend is the selection of the scheme to be
installed and all the rest can be left as default unless a user has
special needs.

Re GNU/Linux installation. For some people, the simplest is the previous
suggestion to install the distro packages.

For others, the preference is for our "native" TeX Live. In the first
line, either curl or wget or a regular browser can be used to download
the installer, of course.

curl https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip
unzip -q install-tl.zip
cd install-tl-*
perl install-tl
<plenty of intro text, just ignore it>
..
Enter command: i
<will take a while, but eventually ... done>

Follow instructions given at end to add the necessary directory to the
search path.

Above works for all platforms, including Macs and Windows, although
that's not likely to be of interest for your purposes.

I wrote a web page which goes into slightly more detail about the above
steps: https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

Hope this helps,
Karl

FYI, this bug has now been fixed in Ghostscript (Ghostscript still
cannot handle this when generating the ToUnicode CMap, but now, it
no longer generates a CMap in such a case, so that its generated
PDF file no longer contains an incorrect CMap), but there is still
an issue with (at least)

\pdfglyphtounicode{Scaron}{0160}

which Ghostscript doesn't handle correctly:

Unfortunately, workarounds yield other issues one day or another.
This has happened recently when using the acmart class, due to
incorrect glyph names in the libertine font. So the new workaround
is to have a glyphtounicode.tex file containing only

\pdfglyphtounicode{f}{0066}
\pdfglyphtounicode{i}{0069}
\pdfglyphtounicode{l}{006C}

Hi

For personal reasons there won't be a TeX Hour tomorrow. The next TeX Hour
will be on Thursday 3 February. The topic will be Basics, by which I mean
the fundamental concepts and technologies relating to TeX, Typography,
Written Language and Communication.

However, the next TeX Hour will be focussed on 2022 basics, not the basics
of 1978 (nearly 50 years ago). The basics are the forces that enable and
shape for success typesetting as a tool used for communication.

Meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Here's an example of rethinking Typography.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography*: *Typography is the art and
technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and
appealing when displayed.

Me, today: Modern Typography for the Blind is the art and technique of
audible, tactile and interaction conventions that make written language
legible, readable and appealing when rendered for a blind person.

In other words, Typography and User EXperience (UX) are roughly equal
partners. And "page" is a word that means both web page and printed page.
And MathJax is for many their first experience of TeX.

wishing you Happy TeXing

Nowadays, users expect a prominent Download button, either to the
actual download or to a simple Download page. As it stands, the
quickinstall page requires a bit of close reading, which is not
optimal.

Siep - specific suggestions for improvements to (hopefully, reductions in)
quickinstall.html are welcome.

Everything on quickinstall.html is there because it has caused users to
ask questions or be confused.

I agree that people want a download button. But what is it supposed to
be?  Of course we could make a "download button" to
https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip, but I am
doubtful it would benefit users. They click download, they get the zip
file ... then what.

Ok, likely they are smart enough to at least unpack it. Good. Then they
click "install-tl". It doesn't work because it's not executable due to
os overrides, or doesn't execute Perl on it, or doesn't execute the
right version of Perl. Now what?

Or, they click download, they get somewhere, but not very far.
Then they click download again, and have a half-installed tree.
That won't work well.

Worst of all, suppose they do the download, they run the installer, it
all works ... but they still have to adjust PATH. That is not a trivial
operation for some -- precisely those people who are most likely to
click "download" and expect everything else to be automatic. Of course
the installer says to do it when it finishes running, but anyone who
actually reads that text doesn't need a "download button" in order to
successfully do the download.

Or, people get the DVD from a user group. Then the whole "download"
concept is just confusion. Although I suppose hardly anyone installs
from the DVD any more, so maybe that's irrelevant now.

I could put the four lines into a section at the beginning of
quickinstall.html (tl;dr). The problem then is that people on Windows
and Macs don't, on the whole. want to run those four lines. They want to
do something different. And, on Unix, even choosing between curl and
wget has become a nightmare of its own, due to the certificate
expiration + os stupidity.

These are the kinds of scenarios I tried to address in
quickinstall.html, as briefly as possible (via references to other
documentation). I just don't know how to make it simpler without causing
confusion for all the people for whom the "one size fits all" download
doesn't work. Of whom there are many. --best, karl.

Message-ID: <CAM9mBUNWNKHSaCVFU_W9wzZhUzikTihNbbYhMR6aTi3qY5Tytw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there,

On line 406 in newpxtext.sty, the line:
\RequirePackage{amsmath,amsthm} % in case of theoremfont
has been uncommented. This breaks compilation of the kaobook class, and
possibly others. Removing the % fixes the issue.

Hi, this is my first post, actually the trigger to subscribing (again).

I'm not sure if this is a valid question for this list, but I hope for
some negligence if it isn't.

After some fiddling I managed to get TeXLive to find .sty files in a
local directory below ~/git/latex, making it think this is the local
texmf tree root.

After this "hello world" test I'll work on getting an earlier - pretty
complex - project set-up to work again on a new computer after my laptop
has been stolen. The compilation stops, not finding the document class
file :-( However, the class file is not in something as a texmf tree
(which I use to place manually installed or in-repository packages
into), but in the working tree of my project repository. So I would
either have to use the class through a relative path or declare a given
directory as a root that should be searched recursively to find files.

Any suggestions would be helpful. And again, sorry if the question is
inappropriate.

Best and thank you
Urs

Hi,

it is difficult to give any advice if you did not write what you did.
In such a case I do not know where is the error in your setup. Anyway,
it might be useful if I describe my setup. In the root directory of
the TeX Live installation you will find texmf.cnf which is basically
empty, it just contains information saying how to override defaults.
This is the place where you shoud add your modification.  My
definition of TEXMF says:

TEXMF = {!!$MYDEVEL,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

MYDEVEL then declares my development path which contains files which
should be prefered to the distribution versions. Yes, it may cause
problems and I am aware of that so if you are not sure, follow the
recommedation in the comments to set a safe order. Then you have to
insert the definition of MYDEVEL. I am afraid that it does not
understand the tilde, and, in addition, you must follow the directory
tree. Your definition should look as

MYDEVEL = /home/username/git

and the .sty files should be in /home/username/git/tex/latex

The !! mean that TL will not examine the directory but only the ls-R
files, you will have to call mktexlsr whenever you add or remove file
in your directory. If you do not want to use mktexlsr, remove !! in
front of $MYDEVEL in the definition of TEXMF.

Hello,
after your vague description of your setup it is hard to give any 
advice. It helps usually to consult the documentation, of course.
It seems, that you use some kind of Linux. How did you install TeXLive? 
Some distributions provide their own setup.
The usual setup for TeXLive is quite sophisticated and user-friendly: As 
soon, as some binary from TeXLive is executed, it looks into a 
reasonable list of places for its files. Only experienced users should 
therefore distribute the files arbritarily in their file system.
If for some good reason some input files lie somewhere else, one can use 
the environment variable TEXINPUTS to point there. Or you could move 
these into the local texmf tree, or use links to access them.
If that sounds too complicated, ask a local expert.
So maybe a short recipe:
Install a standard setup (either from your distribution or from the 
TeXLive repository).
Copy local class files to the appropriate places in the local texmf tree 
(usually texmf-local below the global texlive tree, there the style 
files should reside in the local tree tex/latex/...)
Make sure, your system finds your binaries (usually below 
texlive/<year>/bin/<system>)
Reread the introductory pages.
Good luck
Alois

Hi,

since the latest |tlmgr update| my TeXlive is broken.

I am getting

Is this a common problem?

Usually it happens if you have some stray local files: can you show us 
your .log?

Found a stackexchange discussion about this issue.

Checked that I had no duplicated formats around with `kpsewhich` and 
then used `fmtutil-sys --all`.

Everything seems to be OK now.

Sorry for the noise.

Hi,

this is not a problem of a format but of packages. As Joseph wrote,
you should put \filelist above \documentclass and your log file will
then contain the list of all files loaded. It will explain the reason
of the mismatch.

It is a format problem. If the format has been made with expl3 files
different to those now present in the system LaTeX will complain.
Typically remaking the format solves that. Sometimes you also have
to delete some stray local formats.
